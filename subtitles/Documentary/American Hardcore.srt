1
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,842
<i>When we first got started,</i>

2
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:20,216
<i>we were dealing with a bad economy,</i>
<i>inflation, change of administration.</i>

3
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:24,950
<i>Reagan was the kind of antithesis</i>
<i>or the reaction, a whole new...</i>

4
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,285
<i>Like a paradigm shift.</i>

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,123
<i>And there was a lot of concern over,</i>

6
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,891
<i>you know, what might that mean</i>
<i>in terms of all kinds of issues,</i>

7
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:36,664
<i>freedom of speech and repression</i>
<i>and civil liberties and...</i>

8
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,571
That was the... Sort of that era.

9
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:29,380
In the early '80s, there was this sense
of reestablishing the order.

10
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:32,721
<i>You know, the white man...</i>
<i>The Ronald-Reagan-White-Man order</i>

11
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:33,884
<i>is coming back.</i>

12
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,860
<i>You know, you'd had that wimp,</i>
<i>Jimmy Carter,</i>

13
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,864
<i>talking about peace and human rights</i>
<i>and all this other shit.</i>

14
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,868
<i>And you'd had, you know,</i>
<i>the feminists and the negroes and the...</i>

15
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,268
They're all getting uppity on us, right?

16
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:48,034
So we're going to
reinstitute order here, right?

17
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:53,808
And so the whole country goes into
this really puerile '50s fantasy

18
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,815
<i>where they're dressing</i>
<i>in these cardigan sweaters</i>

19
00:01:56,883 --> 00:02:01,877
and we were just like,
"Fuck you. Fuck you. Not us."

20
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,048
You know, "You can take that
and shove it up your ass."

21
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:18,659
We'd been going through one of
the worst periods in music possible.

22
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,330
<i>Disco was at its peak.</i>

23
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:23,000
<i>Rock bands were still big, like Foghat.</i>

24
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,509
Just crap.

25
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,679
Everybody was into this, like,
"Well, we've got a shiny brand-new car."

26
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:33,378
<i>And, "I just got my hair feathered."</i>
<i>And, "Oh, look at my clothes."</i>

27
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,081
<i>And "Oh, here, want some cocaine?"</i>

28
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:41,753
And "We're drinking wine coolers."
And just all that kind of crap.

29
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:45,558
For me, it was just...
So bored with what was going on.

30
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,090
I mean, in 1980 we're still listening
to the Doors and the Beatles

31
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,605
and we're supposed to be bowing down
to that music, and it just wasn't our music.

32
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:58,542
They were all like, formulaic bands, like
Journey and the Eagles and Fleetwood Mac.

33
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,806
They're all great bands for what they do.

34
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,906
It's just that when you hear it constantly,
over and over and over again,

35
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,884
you're gonna want to just vomit

36
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,189
or jump off the nearest cliff,

37
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:13,316
throw yourself out
in front of an oncoming bus.

38
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:18,057
As a boy, I'm coming up through the '60s,
so I thought, you know,

39
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:22,192
my late teens, early twenties, were gonna be
the most radical years of my life.

40
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:25,829
And I get there and it's, yeah,
Pete Frampton in a kimono, man.

41
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,474
Time was slow back then.

42
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:33,274
Things were barely moving
and this music just came along and just...

43
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,375
It was like an electrical charge.

44
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:40,112
It was like a fucking comet hitting
the fucking planet, you know what I mean.

45
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,416
It came out of left fucking field, dude.

46
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:46,481
I had never heard
nor seen anything like this.

47
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:03,733
The music that we were performing,
the lyrics that we were writing

48
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:07,279
had nothing to do with
about holding hands and smiling

49
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,611
and skipping off into the sunset.

50
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:12,480
I couldn't fucking resist
this incredible scene

51
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,385
being under my fucking doorstep,
you know,

52
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:19,323
full of hatred for mainstream normalcy,
just like I was.

53
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,622
I mean, it was just like,
"Fuck it, I'm diving in,

54
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,491
"I don't care if I ever come back up again."

55
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:24,757
And it took a good long while.

56
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:33,930
<i>We'd been made all these promises.</i>
<i>You go to school, you do your homework,</i>

57
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,875
<i>you go to college, you get a great job,</i>
<i>you make lots of money,</i>

58
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,572
<i>you get married, you have a couple of kids.</i>

59
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:45,983
Dog, cat, goldfish, two-car garage.
And that's just not the way that it is.

60
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,287
<i>Somebody's got to say, "This isn't right."</i>

61
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:51,915
<i>Because everybody else is saying,</i>
<i>"It's morning in America," you know.</i>

62
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,755
Somebody's got to say,
"It's fucking midnight, man!"

63
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,624
I'm working Monday through Friday.

64
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:59,187
Here comes Friday night
and I'm just gonna go off.

65
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:03,759
I hate my boss, I hate the people
that I work with, I hate my parents,

66
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:07,294
I hate all these authoritative figures,
I hate politicians,

67
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:10,604
I hate people in government,
I hate the police.

68
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,144
You know, everybody's kind of
pointing the finger at me.

69
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:16,704
Everybody's picking at me.
Everybody's poking at me.

70
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:20,844
And now I have a chance to be
with a bunch of my own type of people

71
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,321
and I have a chance to go off.
And that's basically what it was.

72
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,642
For me, punk was the portal.
It was the portal to the counterculture.

73
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,077
That's where I belonged.
That's where I lived. That's how I got there.

74
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,306
<i>But punk rock at that time</i>

75
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:52,215
<i>was becoming more associated</i>
<i>with just the Sex Pistols and Sid Vicious.</i>

76
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,549
<i>Now, Sid Vicious was, you know,</i>
<i>he was a junkie, a nihilistic junkie,</i>

77
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,781
and we were not.

78
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:01,088
So we really were trying
to carve out our own place.

79
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,995
And we said, "No, we're hardcore punk."
That's, you know, hardcore. Hardcore punk.

80
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,929
We started calling it hardcore, okay,
like, you know,

81
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,060
as far as being like hardcore porn.

82
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:14,265
It means it's like, it's right down to the core.
It's the real deal.

83
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,243
I could never be Gene Simmons or
Ace Frehely or in some band where,

84
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:22,281
you know, where you're spitting out fire
and there's explosions.

85
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,408
And I couldn't play like Eddie Van Halen.
I still can't.

86
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:29,979
And then this new sound comes along
and it's, you know, simple but aggressive.

87
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,427
<i>I guess the whole new wave thing</i>
<i>was going on</i>

88
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:50,067
and it was just kind of sickening,
to tell you the truth.

89
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,805
They started having, you know,
all these, like,

90
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,541
<i>what they used to call "skinny tie bands,"</i>
<i>all the "day-glo bands"</i>

91
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,276
<i>'cause they were all wearing</i>
<i>those neon colors.</i>

92
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,011
When hardcore came out I was a little kid

93
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,145
and I had missed out on,
you know, the '77 punk thing

94
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,655
and I wasn't around for the '70s rock thing.

95
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,589
So here was something
that was happening, that was new,

96
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,524
that we were making up as it went along.

97
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,222
We were making the rules up
and creating this sound.

98
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,925
And the bands and the people around,
when the scene was small enough,

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,126
it was exciting.

100
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,135
It was like you were on the cusp
of something that was just...

101
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,431
You didn't know where it was gonna go.

102
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:44,954
Normal people did not listen to hardcore.
And we liked it that way, right?

103
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,090
Because you can listen to that shit.

104
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,532
You can listen to Fleetwood Mac.
Go listen to that shit.

105
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:53,003
We are not gonna abide it.
We are about blowing all of that up.

106
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,267
We are about destroying everything in that.

107
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:59,573
And you can't live our way
unless you cross that divide.

108
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,213
I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear...

109
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:06,650
That I will faithfully execute the office
of President of the United States.

110
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:10,519
...that I will faithfully execute the office
of President of the United States.

111
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:15,084
- And will, to the best of my ability...
- And will, to the best of my ability...

112
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:20,531
...preserve, protect and defend...
...preserve, protect and defend...

113
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,037
...the Constitution of the United States.
...the Constitution of the United States.

114
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,902
- So help you, God.
- So help me, God.

115
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:31,338
Punk rockers loved
to hate Reagan worldwide.

116
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,937
<i>Songs were written, posters were made,</i>
<i>signs were raised,</i>

117
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,914
and oranges were hurled.

118
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:40,851
Every punk rock band of that era
must have had at least one or two posters

119
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,480
where they'd have that picture
of Ronald Reagan from <i>The Killers</i>

120
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,421
with the gun like this, right.

121
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,254
<i>You know, with that look</i>
<i>on his face, type thing,</i>

122
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,157
<i>like, "I'm going to kill you, motherfucker."</i>

123
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,372
As far as we knew,
we were the only people in Orange County

124
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,815
who listened to punk rock
or knew what it was.

125
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,115
<i>The original punk bands,</i>

126
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,779
<i>most of these people were musicians,</i>

127
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:20,519
<i>and they were into like,</i>
<i>glitter, glam, stuff like that.</i>

128
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,061
<i>And so they already knew how to play</i>

129
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,530
<i>and they just kind of adopted</i>
<i>punk rock as a style.</i>

130
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:31,094
We listened to the first punk rock records
and we learned to play.

131
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,333
<i>And we were doing it really primitively</i>
<i>because we didn't really know,</i>

132
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,500
<i>so we just put it all into energy.</i>

133
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,649
The whole thing with hardcore was that
it was people just picking up a guitar,

134
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:54,215
<i>learning three chords,</i>
<i>playing as fast as they could.</i>

135
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:57,285
The short fast songs, trim all the fat.

136
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,358
Later do the intro, later do the outro.

137
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,594
Cut the bridge in half and get on with it.

138
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:15,676
I will just say exactly what's on my mind,
and do it in 32 seconds.

139
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,425
The less it was a song, the more we loved it.

140
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,891
We're feeling this,
and we don't want to go slow.

141
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:33,660
We're not trying to be melodic.
We're not trying to be cool or digestible.

142
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,463
We're giving you all our angst
and all our feeling as hard as we can.

143
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,250
We don't know how to sing.
We weren't singing.

144
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,844
We were just screaming
against authority and our parents

145
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,446
and about everything
that was pissing us off in our life.

146
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:02,688
We were just kids
who refused to be sort of slotted

147
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:06,323
into this sort of generic kid role.

148
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,527
It was for kids, it was about kids,
it was by kids.

149
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,162
It was the manifestation of youth.

150
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:16,174
It was fast, it was loud,
it was angry, it was unpredictable.

151
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,473
That's what kids were. Like,
we were just kids going wild, you know.

152
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,173
And I felt like the music
perfectly represented that.

153
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,120
Lots of these kids were like 14.

154
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,927
<i>They were snorting methamphetamine</i>
<i>and fucking in the alley.</i>

155
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,360
It was considered an outcast thing.

156
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,700
It was considered something for losers.
It was considered something

157
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:53,908
that people felt sorry for you
for having to endure.

158
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,742
And all of a sudden we realized, "Wow,

159
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,943
"for being losers we've created something
that's so much better

160
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,247
"than the milieu
that we've been rejected by."

161
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:06,280
It was the only rock kind of music
that came out

162
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:10,954
that didn't feel like it was
totally ripping off black culture.

163
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,897
And it wasn't that it was white culture
versus black culture.

164
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:17,925
It was just that there wasn't that guilt
of listening to a Led Zeppelin song

165
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,733
and going, "Wait, that's like
this really old blues song."

166
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:24,207
You grow up in America
as a minority group,

167
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:29,043
you know that there are preconceptions
that people have of you

168
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,084
just because you are
part of a minority group.

169
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,412
Well, all of a sudden it dawned on me

170
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,852
that I had just become
part of another minority group.

171
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,479
I was a punk rocker.

172
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,870
People would assume, you're in a band,
you're trying to make it to the top.

173
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,572
And you'd go,
"You don't understand the scene I'm in.

174
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,274
"We're trying to level the top."

175
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:07,080
No one ever made a record and said,
"They're gonna play that on the radio."

176
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,518
It's like, "No, they're not."

177
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:09,815
You know, that's like a black guy saying,

178
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,754
"I'm gonna be elected
the president of the Ku Klux Klan."

179
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:12,984
"No, you're not."

180
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,526
I mean, no one would even think like that.
You know what I'm saying?

181
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,324
So none of these bands ever thought,
"I'm gonna be on the radio."

182
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:21,093
No, you're not. So why even think like that?

183
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,692
You're not accepted,
they're not gonna play you,

184
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,669
you're just doing this for the fun of it.

185
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,639
You're not gonna sell a ton of records,
you're not gonna make a bunch of money,

186
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,368
you're just doing this 'cause you love it.

187
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:34,105
It was totally living in the moment.
You didn't think about like, you know,

188
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,808
trying to build a fan base
or trying to have a career,

189
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,372
because that was absurd.

190
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,180
You weren't going to have a career
playing this music.

191
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,413
It just wasn't going to happen.

192
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:54,292
We would play wherever we could play
so people would know we existed as a band.

193
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,425
<i>There were no promoters</i>
<i>knocking on our door,</i>

194
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,164
<i>wanting us to come and play their clubs.</i>

195
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,802
We played at churches.
We played in basements.

196
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,341
<i>We played in living rooms.</i>

197
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:07,743
<i>Abandoned gas stations,</i>
<i>people's parties in their backyards.</i>

198
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,713
We did a show at this... It was at a dog...

199
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:15,884
It was at the canine dog college.
Basically it was like a dog training school.

200
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:19,284
Boogied all the way to Salt Lake City
and we got there

201
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,492
and the place was closed, locked up.

202
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,391
So we went to the kid's house,
pulled him out of bed

203
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,194
and we threatened him with a baseball bat,

204
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,064
and we would have kicked
the shit out of him.

205
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,000
We made him give us
all the money he had on him

206
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,370
and stole some other shit from him.
But when we got there, there wasn't a gig.

207
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,238
You just never knew
what you would walk into.

208
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,800
Would it be an arcade,
would it be a basement,

209
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,369
would it be like some guy's work?

210
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,974
When we found out
that somebody owned a shopping center

211
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:49,017
or somebody's apartment complex
or somebody's mom and dad was moving,

212
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,784
we would then rush to that place

213
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:54,587
and say, "Well, there's a show
going on tonight."

214
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,151
And, you know, "Everybody's invited."

215
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:03,229
The record industry is all about
getting big, getting coke, getting girls.

216
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,403
Right? And fuck everybody else.

217
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,967
And because our position was,
"We're against that.

218
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,906
"We're the opposite of that."

219
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:16,039
The industry trivializes music
because they want people to consume.

220
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:19,016
So there's like,
"Buy this, it doesn't mean nothing."

221
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,644
So in a way, if you have already, you know...

222
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,484
Once you buy into that kind of, that picture,
then it's sort of like,

223
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:28,458
artists are like, "Oh, well, you know,"
you know, "I'm just a fuck up."

224
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:31,257
And "I'm getting paid millions of dollars,"
you know. Whatever.

225
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,491
And it just becomes really dismissible.

226
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,659
There was no record companies
behind the bands.

227
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:40,728
There was no A and R interest in the bands.

228
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:45,106
So anything that grew,
grew at a very grassroots level.

229
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,508
You were in charge of everything.

230
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,081
<i>You know, putting on gigs.</i>
<i>Putting out zines.</i>

231
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,481
<i>It was more than just a look on stage.</i>

232
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:56,020
D.I.Y. Do it yourself.

233
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:01,849
If there's someplace you wanna be,
go there yourself.

234
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:05,624
If there's something you wanna create
that does not exist, do it yourself.

235
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:24,005
Recording is pretty much,
"Play the song. Okay, the song's done."

236
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,810
You know, it's not like,
"I don't know, you know.

237
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:29,979
"Maybe if you could lay back a little
behind the beat on that."

238
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:34,458
I mean, that never happened, you know.
It was just what you got is what it was.

239
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,721
<i>These records were done in, like, a day.</i>

240
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:40,060
<i>Like in, cut, and then out,</i>
<i>you know what I mean?</i>

241
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,796
Because it's like, you really didn't have time
to mull over the fact of like, crafting songs.

242
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,304
I mean, it's more or less like
if you had your energy right

243
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,773
and you played in those shows,
and you went into it,

244
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,935
you know what I mean,
with like, your head straight,

245
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,036
then that's, you know, what you got.

246
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:57,378
The group had to rely on creativity.

247
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:01,450
And the music had to come off live that way,

248
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:05,085
as soon as we delivered it
in our expression.

249
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,787
In the early days, that was it.

250
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,227
Our first records, we made ourselves.

251
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:15,556
<i>Pay to Cum,</i> the first single we did,
we paid for it.

252
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,133
A friend of ours
who worked at a printing company

253
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,296
printed this stuff off after hours,

254
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,603
and we sat down there and folded them
and inserted them lyrics in there

255
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:24,733
and did all that stuff ourselves.

256
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,211
It felt like it was a million damn records,
and we didn't even get through the first...

257
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,373
There's only a thousand
and we didn't even get to the thousand.

258
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:35,546
We only actually did inserts and covers
and everything for 500 of them.

259
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,454
We had some singles from England
that we liked,

260
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,084
so we just pulled them apart

261
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,221
to see how they were fabricated,
unfolded them.

262
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,390
So you had basically, this sort of like,

263
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,196
you know, seven inches
and then there was like little flaps.

264
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,999
You know, like, and you fold them up
and you fold the flaps inside.

265
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,131
You fold them together
and you glue them together.

266
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,333
So we said, "Okay, that's how you do it."

267
00:17:56,408 --> 00:18:00,708
So we just took that unfolded thing. We laid
it on an 11"by 14" piece of white paper.

268
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,476
We drew a line around it
and we laid the art within the lines.

269
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,419
<i>We took that to a printing press and said,</i>
<i>"Just print this 11" by 14"piece of paper."</i>

270
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:13,822
<i>And then, using scissors,</i>
<i>we cut out every fucking one,</i>

271
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,859
<i>and Elmer's glue and folded every one,</i>
<i>inserted every one.</i>

272
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:23,895
<i>We did that for 10,000 records easily.</i>
<i>Every seven-inch.</i>

273
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:27,370
We did it by hand.
Just sat there cutting and folding.

274
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,634
It's... We didn't know. We were learning.

275
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:39,341
<i>The first shows we played were parties,</i>
<i>free parties in the South Bay.</i>

276
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:43,081
Hermosa Beach and we played...
We did that for a long time

277
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:46,750
because we couldn't really find gigs.

278
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,852
This is where Black Flag's second gig
and our first gig was.

279
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,864
It's apartments now. These four little things.

280
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:58,494
It was the Teen Post here
and it was with the Alley Cats.

281
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:03,905
<i>And the Descendents' first gig,</i>
<i>they were like 14, 15 years old.</i>

282
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,436
<i>People would always hang out</i>
<i>whenever there was a show,</i>

283
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,675
and this kid came up to us and he's going,
"I've got a band, too, you know.

284
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:13,047
"We're really, like, hardcore,
like, just straight ahead,

285
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,152
"you know, fast punk rock. You know?"

286
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,281
And we were going, "Okay.
Yeah, that's great, what's the name of it?"

287
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,555
And he said, "Black Flag."
And it was Keith Morris.

288
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,755
And we were going,
"You mean, like the roach spray?"

289
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,630
Black Flag had this austere,

290
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,363
kind of very earnest, serious thing
about them

291
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:36,430
that made you kind of respect it,
be in awe of it.

292
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,477
<i>The band had a logo. The band had a look.</i>
<i>The four bars.</i>

293
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,105
<i>It was really all very overwhelming.</i>

294
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:46,807
<i>They just had this very intense take</i>
<i>on things. They had a political agenda.</i>

295
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:51,217
Those guys were operating at a very, like,
intellectual level, and then...

296
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,351
But the brute animal fucking strength of it
and the power and ferocity

297
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,486
was also like, off the map.

298
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:02,557
Black Flag brought the suburban element
into the punk rock

299
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:07,765
and helped define what punk rock
was gonna turn into during those times.

300
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:14,075
<i>The scene in Los Angeles</i>
<i>was spreading out</i>

301
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:18,014
<i>like if you were to spill a bucket of water.</i>

302
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,808
<i>All of a sudden it wasn't just</i>
<i>about Hollywood.</i>

303
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:26,222
<i>But it was more about Ventura County,</i>
<i>it was more about the Valley,</i>

304
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,883
<i>it was more about Orange County.</i>

305
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,589
<i>It was more about where we were from,</i>
<i>which is the South Bay,</i>

306
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:35,599
which is about 25 miles south
of Los Angeles.

307
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:39,569
Still part of LA County,
but it was the beach area.

308
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:43,072
<i>The Church was like a commune,</i>
<i>a hippie commune,</i>

309
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,371
<i>an arts and crafts center.</i>

310
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:49,346
<i>It was in Hermosa Beach.</i>
<i>It was about a block from the beach.</i>

311
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,975
<i>Beautiful building,</i>
<i>perfect for what we were doing,</i>

312
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:56,782
<i>throwing parties,</i>
<i>playing loud music late at night.</i>

313
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:03,961
That's where the whole, you know,
1980s LA Orange County sounds...

314
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,520
It all revolved around
these parties at The Church.

315
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,970
We're at the Black Hole.

316
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,701
And it's pretty much where, like,
the Fullerton punk scene

317
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,265
really kind of came together.

318
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,935
Everyone hung out here.

319
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,810
It's where you came to get away
from your parents and everything else.

320
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,542
<i>And this is where everyone came</i>
<i>and got drunk.</i>

321
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:29,280
We were frustrated. And we were trying
to find a way out of the normal,

322
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:34,621
just weird, basic, suburban normality.

323
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,854
<i>The Adolescents represented</i>
<i>everything that was LA.</i>

324
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:41,193
<i>Frustrated, suburban,</i>

325
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:44,292
<i>dissatisfied with getting up in the morning,</i>

326
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,564
and hating everything around you.

327
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:49,736
<i>I was making a record</i>

328
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:56,176
really to nullify

329
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,714
my Orange County existence.

330
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:05,518
You know, to really say to the...
What, you know, what was around me.

331
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:10,027
You know, it was...
You know, it was literally to lash out at that.

332
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,924
Tony was an amazing performer
right from the start, you know.

333
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,331
It was like putting a cat in a bag
and shaking it up

334
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,561
and throwing it out at the crowd.

335
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,575
Somehow we got to
the opening slot of a Germs show.

336
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:37,850
<i>And Eddie from the Subtitles,</i>
<i>who was really connected up in LA,</i>

337
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:41,359
<i>that night goes... You know, didn't ask,</i>
<i>told us he was our manager.</i>

338
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,623
And he was a great one,
because I mean, really he got us...

339
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,722
He got us in the door in LA,
got us hooked up there.

340
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:52,828
He got us all, you know, hopped up on pills.

341
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:01,401
For some reason,
real surfers have always been fucked up.

342
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,815
The HBs, we called them,
from Huntington Beach

343
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,975
who wore leather jackets
and leather engineer boots

344
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,746
<i>with chains and bandanas on them.</i>

345
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,811
They were the high school jock
who found punk rock.

346
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,983
So they still have that, like,
"What's up, dickhead?" mentality.

347
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,654
The music was just basically
a backdrop for being fucked.

348
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:23,599
Jack Grisham is like
the Iggy Pop of LA hardcore.

349
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,604
<i>He used to go up there onstage</i>

350
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:30,538
in full drag, a full face of makeup
and a dress,

351
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:35,012
and if anyone said anything to him,
he would kick the living crap out of them.

352
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,479
He was so tough.

353
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,175
You roll into somebody's house, you know,
and you start drinking,

354
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,371
and then, you know, you're throwing
the fucking potted plants at each other.

355
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,176
You know, somebody breaks
in the parents' room.

356
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,739
You know, you go in the closet,
you're pissing on the shoes.

357
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,285
You know, you're stealing shit,
you're going through...

358
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:15,842
You're getting the credit cards out.

359
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:19,084
You know, a fight breaks out in the kitchen,
everybody's jumping on.

360
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,751
You know, the house gets fucking wrecked,
the band plays,

361
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,352
the cops show up, you know,
and instead of running,

362
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,056
it's, "Let's get them, man."

363
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,122
You know, and it's...
And then you turn on the police.

364
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,828
Somebody came up
and wanted to get into the show

365
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:33,496
and didn't have any money
and gave me two pipe bombs.

366
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,803
I remember Mike being kind of a snot.
He goes, "Why should I get you in?"

367
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,275
You know, I'm just some guy, you know,
"Why should he get some guy in?"

368
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:43,007
And I go, "Well, 'cause I have a bomb.
Here, I have a bomb.

369
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,340
"I've got two.
You can have one if you get me in."

370
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,612
And he's like... He goes,
"How do I know it's even gonna even work?"

371
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:48,983
I go, "Well, okay, watch."

372
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,215
So I went down the street
and took one of them

373
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,484
and put them against this garage door
and lit it

374
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,583
<i>and just blew this fucking garage door off.</i>

375
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:02,499
And me being a violent, robbing,
grave-digging rapist

376
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:03,761
was part of my world.

377
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,996
I mean, that was like,
"Well, this is what we do, man.

378
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:10,235
"Yeah, that chick passed out
and I pissed in her face. What. So what?"

379
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,108
One of the first times
we went out of town at all,

380
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,243
we went up to San Francisco.

381
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,446
So we drove up, you know, us,
all of our friends

382
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,853
piled into everybody's cars,

383
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:28,552
maybe 20 or 30 kids from the scene from LA

384
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,492
and we played a show

385
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:33,861
with the Dead Kennedys,
at the Mabuhay Gardens.

386
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:39,102
<i>And we go on</i>
<i>and the kids totally took over the pit.</i>

387
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:43,103
It sounds like someone's exaggerating
when they tell you the story.

388
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,802
It sounds like, "Oh, yeah,
you're just making it up."

389
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,107
No. I've never seen anything like it.

390
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:51,808
Ask lan. Ask Hetson. Ask Keith Morris.

391
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:55,785
The Circle Jerks started playing,
and all you saw was fists

392
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,789
and San Francisco locals hitting the floor.

393
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:02,183
<i>They were still pogoing back then,</i>
<i>up there in San Francisco.</i>

394
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,991
So we came in with our people
and they just fucked up the whole thing.

395
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,224
The promoter was freaking out.

396
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,791
"What's this, you bring these crazy kids and
they're destroying shit and they're fighting."

397
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:13,599
It's like, "No, we're not fighting,
it's the way we do it in LA."

398
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:15,003
And they're stage diving.

399
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,735
Nobody had seen anything like that.
So that was kind of cool.

400
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:21,210
They're knocking guys out.
One bouncer gets cut open.

401
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,442
I mean, there's blood.
There's violence before the show.

402
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,882
They chased a guy underneath a car

403
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,852
and were trying to pull him out
and beat him.

404
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,252
I mean, I've never seen anything like this.

405
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:34,258
And like, they had the whole place
kind of terrified.

406
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:38,319
<i>It was a huge impact on us.</i>
<i>So we, of course, go back to the DC scene.</i>

407
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:40,762
When bands play the audience is like...

408
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,092
And we're like...

409
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,863
You know, mowing through people,
elbows into heads.

410
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,734
People were like, "What are you doing?"
We're like, "That's what we're doing!"

411
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,137
And it'd be like...

412
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,675
Because we...
All of a sudden it's all aggro.

413
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:56,237
Within two weeks,
every male hitting puberty is in that crowd,

414
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,782
and every bouncer's getting swung at.

415
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,384
So, me and my friends
used to call them Washifornians,

416
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:05,219
because they, like, totally imported
the West Coast style to DC.

417
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,815
<i>That influenced DC sound,</i>
<i>that and the Bad Brains.</i>

418
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:12,192
The combination of those elements kind of
contributed to creating the DC sound.

419
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:46,063
We had to come up with an angle

420
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:49,862
or some kind of approach

421
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:55,004
that would be very radical and creative,

422
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:58,504
but then at the same time kind of traditional.

423
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:02,876
And something that people
would be able to universally relate to.

424
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:07,614
It wasn't like, a musical thing. It wasn't like,
a fucking entertainment thing.

425
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:12,146
It was like, we figured out these riffs,
we had this message,

426
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,485
and we just had to drop the shit.

427
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:58,260
The Bad Brains were the band
that everybody feared to play with.

428
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,736
'Cause you knew you were going
to get your ass blown off stage!

429
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:03,501
They were tight and powerful and committed

430
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:09,070
and exhibiting an incredible emotional,
involving emotional vibe,

431
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:15,844
<i>while playing as technically challenging</i>
<i>as you can imagine.</i>

432
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,050
<i>I mean, stop-on-the-dime starts and stops,</i>

433
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:24,960
<i>and extreme precision, locking up of rhythm</i>

434
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:29,398
<i>and just innovative melodies,</i>

435
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,367
<i>and chord patterns,</i>

436
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,599
<i>and over it all, HR,</i>

437
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:37,368
<i>the maniac vocalist,</i>

438
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:41,811
<i>dancing across the stage</i>
<i>and screaming and whooping and hollering</i>

439
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,338
<i>and just slinging his soul out</i>
<i>into the microphone.</i>

440
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,941
<i>As a teenager I was into acrobats.</i>

441
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,611
<i>When I went onto stage,</i>

442
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:55,626
<i>the intensity of the music would sometimes</i>
<i>be so immense and so energetic,</i>

443
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:57,684
<i>that I would feel like jumping</i>
<i>into the audience</i>

444
00:29:57,762 --> 00:30:02,222
<i>or doing some kind of flips in the air,</i>

445
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,700
something like that, you know.
And that's what it came from,

446
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:07,897
just a feeling of exuberation,
of jubilee, you know.

447
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,736
It really was inspiring.
It made me realize, like, "Take it seriously.

448
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:17,510
"Like, don't just... Don't just be satisfied
with some shit. Push it."

449
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,516
They would come to our shows
and they were very young,

450
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,382
about 13, 14, 15 years old.

451
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:25,911
And they wanted to start a group
called Teen Idles.

452
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:35,289
<i>They were very enthusiastic</i>
<i>but couldn't perfect their instruments.</i>

453
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,260
You know, I was nervous, 'cause I was
playing in front of the Bad Brains.

454
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,497
I was having a hard time.
I was thinking like, "Well,

455
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:41,698
"that's some shitty bass,

456
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:45,231
"setting up a bad amp,
you know, bad equipment."

457
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:50,748
But then when I hand the shit to Darryl,
man, it was not the bass, it was not the amp,

458
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,305
it was definitely the player.

459
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:57,477
I was able to come up with some really
great plans for these undergraduates,

460
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:00,516
<i>is what I'd call them, or students or interns.</i>

461
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:03,186
<i>And their interest was immense.</i>

462
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:07,161
I referred them to the Bible,
and also to this great book

463
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:12,192
by an individual named Napoleon Hill.
And it's called <i>Think And Grow Rich.</i>

464
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:17,564
The "think and grow rich" concept
was just a positive influence.

465
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:23,503
And that was the catalyst
to just make us find God, still, you know.

466
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,310
So, it wasn't quite L. Ron Hubbard,

467
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,581
but it was concepts of power
of positive thinking.

468
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:32,312
I don't care what you say,
I don't care what you do,

469
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,153
we got our attitude.

470
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:39,658
I don't care what you may know.
I don't care. You can't touch us.

471
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,289
<i>You got that PMA</i>
<i>You got that PMA</i>

472
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:43,129
Like how we used to say, you know.

473
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,897
<i>Hey, we got that attitude</i>
<i>We got that attitude</i>

474
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,598
That was like a song that really, like,
said that, you know,

475
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,233
we're here on some punk rock shit.

476
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:10,123
<i>It's a self-loathing town.</i>
<i>It's a transient town.</i>

477
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:14,864
If you're of here, if you're from here,
and you're of here, you hold on tight.

478
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,463
You got to. 'Cause the currents
are just whipping on past.

479
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:21,972
<i>Every four years another President,</i>
<i>some other jackass comes through.</i>

480
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,500
Who are your parents
when you're living in Washington in 1980,

481
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:29,740
and you're a teenager?
Why are your parents here?

482
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:33,014
What do they do?
Well, there's a good chance

483
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:36,281
that they are involved
with the current administration,

484
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:40,085
<i>or perhaps they're involved</i>
<i>with one of the major colleges here</i>

485
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,922
<i>or they're involved in the news media</i>
<i>in some way.</i>

486
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:45,360
<i>My father is a United States Senator.</i>

487
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,024
He's the Senator from the state of Hawaii.

488
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:51,330
<i>Georgetown Day School is a private school.</i>
<i>It was a hippie school.</i>

489
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:54,929
You didn't have to wear shoes.
You could bring your dog to school.

490
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,406
You called your teachers
by their first names.

491
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,239
I happened to be at the right school
at the right time,

492
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,007
and that's how I got into Minor Threat.

493
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:07,950
Our first show is going to be at a party
at 1929 Calvert Street,

494
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,087
and we're going to open for the Bad Brains,

495
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:15,520
who I have never seen play,
who are the biggest thing in the world.

496
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,845
<i>All right.</i>

497
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:43,182
I understand a lot of people, they're like,
"Well, Minor Threat's such a simple band."

498
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:45,688
Minor Threat was not a simple band.
That music was good.

499
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,817
Those guys could play.
That was a good band.

500
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,656
<i>And for guys who were 16 years old,</i>
<i>17 years old, they were knocking it out.</i>

501
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,063
<i>Their playing, it was unheard-of.</i>
<i>It was a really... It was a new form.</i>

502
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,579
I stand behind all my lyrics.

503
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,881
But I know that when I wrote
<i>Guilty Of Being White,</i>

504
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,922
I grew up in Washington, DC,
which is a black majority city.

505
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,684
I went to the public schools here,

506
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:58,195
and I know that when I wrote that song
I was writing an anti-racist song,

507
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,559
because I was singing a song
about being in a minority.

508
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:05,125
In my junior high school,
I was one of 10% white kids,

509
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:08,104
and in my senior high school,
I was one of 25% white kids.

510
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,936
And I know that when I wrote that song
I was saying,

511
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:14,774
"I'm only guilty of being white.
Don't judge me for the color of my skin."

512
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,246
It's anti-racist. It's so clear.

513
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:22,116
How could I know that some, like,
nationalist Nazi guy in Poland

514
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:27,089
would listen to that song 15 years later
and then say to me, like,

515
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:30,559
"It is so good you speak for the white man."
How could I know?

516
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,819
And here I thought I was like
Mr. Joe Punk Rock,

517
00:35:55,887 --> 00:36:01,052
and I went down to DC one day to go see
SOA and I think the Untouchables.

518
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:03,218
It was a total hardcore show.
I had never been to one before.

519
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:06,855
I just walked in, I was like, "Oh, my God!
These people are killing each other."

520
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,923
You know, it kind of frightened me
but it was kind of fun at the same time.

521
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,935
So I was like,
"I wanna be a part of that scene."

522
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,732
But, you know,
these guys were all from the DC area.

523
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:16,534
They all lived in... "Georgetown Punks"
is what they called themselves.

524
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:19,701
Lan MacKaye and his brother Alec
and that whole crew,

525
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:22,268
<i>and Henry Warfield</i>
<i>before he became Henry Rollins.</i>

526
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,779
<i>You know, I wanted to be just like them.</i>

527
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,817
<i>Georgetown is a fashionable</i>
<i>shopping district.</i>

528
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:30,650
<i>And when the person called us</i>
<i>Georgetown Punks,</i>

529
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:33,013
<i>they meant it as a really deep insult.</i>

530
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,890
We, of course, took it as, like,
"All right, well, we're Georgetown Punks."

531
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,690
So then we referred to ourselves
as Georgetown Punks.

532
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,225
<i>The Circle Jerks and Black Flag would tour.</i>

533
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:22,830
<i>So they're pollinating</i>
<i>with this influence and with this music.</i>

534
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,240
<i>So every scene they're going through,</i>
<i>all of a sudden bands are springing up.</i>

535
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,675
And bands are starting to network.

536
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,613
Where we first met Henry Rollins
was in New York

537
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,950
where he came up from DC

538
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:38,045
to one of our shows there.

539
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:43,925
And then when we came back
to New York a second time,

540
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:47,260
he was there again
and he came and talked to us.

541
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:50,390
We just thought he was a nice guy

542
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:54,234
and interested in what we were doing
and that kind of thing.

543
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,705
I said, "Hey, can you guys play <i>Clocked In,"</i>

544
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,470
a song about going to work,
"Because I gotta go to work now?"

545
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:02,239
And Dez goes, "All right, this is for Henry."
'Cause I was like right there.

546
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,213
"This is for Henry
because he's got to go to work."

547
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,740
And I kind of looked, you know,
wantingly at the microphone and he went,

548
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,718
"And Henry's going to sing it."

549
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:13,089
Henry Rollins ended up jumping up
and singing <i>Clocked In.</i>

550
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,717
And all of a sudden it was like
they called him the next day and like,

551
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,284
"You want to be the singer for Black Flag?"
And... He moved to LA.

552
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,159
That was it.
That was history right there. And we saw it.

553
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:23,632
We had the day off,
so I was, like, hanging out in bars,

554
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,800
goofing off, being a jerk. You know?

555
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:31,633
And I see the guys and they're like,

556
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:35,475
"Well, we want you to ask this guy Henry
to join the band."

557
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,772
About a day later,
Greg Ginn called me at the store.

558
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,945
Said, "Hey, we're auditioning singers.

559
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,012
"Dez doesn't want to sing.
He wants to play guitar.

560
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,287
"We saw you sing the other night.
We liked your 45.

561
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:53,890
"Your SOA record. Would you come
up here and audition to be in Black Flag?"

562
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:57,764
I was like, "Yes." I mean, I was terrified.

563
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:01,568
But what did I have to lose?
I had a job that paid me $3.50 an hour,

564
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,903
<i>and here's an opportunity. So I said yeah.</i>

565
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:07,137
<i>So I took the Amtrak up there,</i>
<i>did two sets with the band,</i>

566
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:09,702
and they took a little vote
and I was in the band.

567
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,238
And it was pretty astounding news
to tell a young guy.

568
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:14,909
I was still on the fence
about the whole thing.

569
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:18,648
It was a huge step to take.
So I called lan. I told him what happened.

570
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:19,712
I go, "What do you think?"

571
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,850
He says, "Are you kidding?
You're gonna be great. Get out there."

572
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:27,591
And that's what I needed to hear,
lan MacKaye give me the green light.

573
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,976
I don't care what anybody says.

574
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:23,848
When Black Flag got Henry Rollins,
that was a fucking mold, a melding of.

575
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:25,546
What a band.

576
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:31,289
At that juncture, with Rollins,
and Dez playing rhythm guitar,

577
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:33,590
they were unstoppable.

578
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:37,392
<i>They were in a fucking frustrated</i>

579
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:39,962
<i>sweat...</i>

580
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:43,529
I mean this is what
your mind imagines, you know.

581
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:47,543
A basement of fucking frustration, man.

582
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:51,206
And fucking... They were fucking howling.

583
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:54,347
Henry being the face of the band

584
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:57,012
and being the front man,
took a lot more of the abuse.

585
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:58,145
No question about it.

586
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:02,249
The first gig with Black Flag
and he fucking gets up there...

587
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,496
And fucking Tony Chuco
just walks up and goes...

588
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:10,261
Fucking smacks him right in the face.
His nose breaks. Blood everywhere.

589
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:13,861
He goes, "Welcome to San Diego."
It was fucking mayhem.

590
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:18,068
He was dealing face to face with
people's conception of what punk rock was

591
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:23,136
which included violence and nastiness,
and he took the brunt of that.

592
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,382
Some people thought
he wanted to have his ass kicked.

593
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:56,245
In hardcore you have a map.
And every city is a band.

594
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,981
<i>San Diego, I don't think of a zoo.</i>

595
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,012
<i>I think of one thing.</i>
<i>I think of Battalion of Saints.</i>

596
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:06,182
<i>Reno, Nevada. I don't think of a casino.</i>
<i>I think of 7 Seconds.</i>

597
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,421
<i>Portland, Oregon,</i>
<i>I don't even know what's there.</i>

598
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:12,428
<i>Gus Van Sant? I think of Poison Idea.</i>

599
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:17,024
In the Black Flag days,
you stayed on a series of floors.

600
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:19,661
No, there was no hotel,
no money for a hotel,

601
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,968
and we'd stay with The Effigies,
we'd stay with Hsker D.

602
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,339
<i>We would stay with, you know,</i>
<i>whoever in Seattle.</i>

603
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,868
<i>You know, and there's</i>
<i>all of these kind of alliances.</i>

604
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:33,773
<i>You know, you knew the SS Decontrol guys,</i>
<i>you could always borrow their gear.</i>

605
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:37,446
In DC, of course, any band will help you
out because, you know,

606
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:40,513
I was on tour with Black Flag, I'm a DC guy.

607
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:44,152
We have, you know, allies in New York.

608
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:46,419
We've got them in San Francisco.

609
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:49,796
In Vancouver,
you stay at Joey Shithead's house.

610
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,899
We always had friends everywhere.

611
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,937
I mean, these guys were going places

612
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,568
that there were no punks.

613
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,939
They were just basically saying,
"We're gonna play

614
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:03,673
"and we expect everyone within 200 miles
to show up who's interested."

615
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:07,274
So we're gonna sleep not only on the floor
but under the sink.

616
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,646
Black Flag rented rehearsal time

617
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:13,019
for 8:00 a.m.

618
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,991
On Christmas morning 1981.

619
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:19,086
8:00 a.m.? Christmas morning?

620
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,088
They wanna rehearse?

621
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:25,396
I said, you know, "Hey, they're Black Flag,
I'm not gonna argue."

622
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:27,903
Well, that was typical Black Flag.

623
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:30,973
Load in at bright and early and practice,

624
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:33,908
because we hadn't done a show
in three days.

625
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:39,239
And that was the way of Black Flag.
Just practice. Live it.

626
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:54,721
I am the Reverend Hank Peirce,

627
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,823
and this is the
Unitarian Universalist Church of Medford.

628
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,391
Here, the church I serve
as its called minister.

629
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,166
You know, whenever I see people
who are like rock 'n' roll ministers,

630
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,173
they're all like,
"Oh, and that's when I was a sinner,

631
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:05,230
"and then I found the Lord."

632
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:09,541
And that's not what I believe.
I'm, you know, a bit more settled down.

633
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:13,174
But I'm still the same, you know,
jackass I always was.

634
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,083
The first time I ever went to a, you know,
a really big hardcore show,

635
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,644
I kind of walked in, it was crazy.
The Circle Jerks were playing.

636
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:21,816
I just walked in and I was like,
"Oh, my God. This is crazy."

637
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:23,086
And yet at the same time having this like,

638
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,153
inner calm sweep over me
and sort of saying, "This is my tribe."

639
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:58,259
<i>There is no shortage of people out there</i>
<i>saying like, "Get high."</i>

640
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:00,922
I mean, they're everywhere.
On every kind of music.

641
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,990
Everybody was just saying,
"Get high, get high, get high."

642
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:06,798
You know, whether it was like
Eric Clapton singing about cocaine

643
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,566
or Lou Reed singing about heroin.
Or anybody.

644
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,336
Everything was just about getting high.
Have a good time, get high.

645
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:13,808
But a lot of kids were like...

646
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,505
I think they were looking for someone
to not say that.

647
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:20,573
<i>Straight Edge</i> was once again a great feeling

648
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:23,279
of, "I'm not going to make
those same mistakes other people made."

649
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:24,684
Or at least, "I'm not going to be..."

650
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:26,222
You know,
"I hate the people around me so much

651
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,417
"that I'm going to be
the exact opposite of who they are."

652
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:33,222
It spoke to a whole generation
of kids who had just seen the '70s.

653
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,465
You know,
and they'd seen kids in high school

654
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,194
getting stoned three times a day

655
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:43,069
and, you know, just becoming wasties
at a very, you know, tragically early age.

656
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:46,242
To find out that across the country
there's these kids

657
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,778
who didn't drink, didn't do drugs

658
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:51,440
and didn't really think
that was a cool thing to do,

659
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:56,782
and actually made a point of mentioning it
a lot in the music, we identified with that.

660
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,823
We were kids and we were fucking pricks.

661
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:03,556
Smart, hostile and sober.

662
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:06,425
See, I remember seeing the Bad Brains,
and HR took me aside.

663
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:10,263
He said,
"lan, man, we just went out on tour, man,

664
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:13,531
"and there are kids all over the country,
man, they want to know.

665
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,162
"You gotta go out and tell them.

666
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,867
"They're asking me about you guys, man,
you gotta go out there."

667
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:21,001
Said, "You opened this up, man,
you gotta finish it."

668
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:22,841
It was like the straight-edge thing.

669
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:25,609
I was like, "God damn, well, fuck.
That's heavy."

670
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:35,554
The influence of Minor Threat
carried onto Boston, SSD.

671
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,527
I think what Boston did
to Minor Threat, like...

672
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:40,062
Minor Threat had a very...

673
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:45,659
It was a kind of a safe way
of, you know, telling people not to drink.

674
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,531
But when it got filtered up north to Boston,

675
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,472
it got a little eviler.

676
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,874
I figured out that, you know,
was about time to get something going.

677
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:58,437
The city, it's like, it's just become too dry

678
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:04,511
and all the new-wave faggots
and all the new-romantic bullshit

679
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:08,991
was going on, and whereas like the scene
we have built now and created,

680
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:13,928
is an underground and is based...
As far as its base,

681
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,022
we built, there is no partying.

682
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:20,001
I mean, no one drinks
and no one smokes at the shows.

683
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,738
If they do,
they better do it behind our backs.

684
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:27,800
It doesn't hurt that we had, like, Al Barile
as our, you know, master of ceremonies,

685
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:30,645
you know, and he's a freaking tank.

686
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:33,774
He was like a quarterback.
You know, he was the one calling the shots.

687
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:37,912
Calling, you know, like,
"Okay, you guys, you drinking over there?

688
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:41,424
"You from Norwood. You're okay.
Come on in. You're welcome, all right."

689
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:44,187
I have a lot of pride in Boston.
I like, you know, the sports thing.

690
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:48,095
That comes back to my jock...
Whatever that thing said in that thing.

691
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:50,429
- Hockey jock.
- The hockey jock mentality.

692
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:53,868
Al's a hockey player.

693
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:56,303
He put down his hockey stick,
he picked up a guitar.

694
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,341
And that's it.

695
00:47:58,408 --> 00:47:59,670
- You know?
- Go, team, go!

696
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,768
And he approaches guitar that way

697
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:05,042
and I always thought I would see him
in front of his Marshall going...

698
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:07,276
You remember this. He'd be going...

699
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:10,242
"Do you think this speaker's broken?

700
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:14,084
"I think it's this one."
And he'd have his head in the fucking...

701
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:18,457
And we'd be on the other side of the room,
like, "Al, shut up! Shut up!"

702
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:21,861
And I'm sure it's because he worked at GE
all day in the machine shop

703
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:25,993
with like grinders and buffing wheels
and milling machines going,

704
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,560
and, you know,
he was probably used to that sound.

705
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,573
And to me, that's what his guitar was like.

706
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:45,678
Al was always having equipment problems
and the PA was always shutting down.

707
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,782
But when you're a young kid,
I mean, that was cool.

708
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:54,553
It was like, "The fucking equipment
is malfunctioning. They're too powerful.

709
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:57,327
"They can't handle the great SSD."

710
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:43,112
I think there's a tone of seriousness

711
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,308
with that band that didn't exist
with a lot of other punk rock bands.

712
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,476
It wasn't a fun band.

713
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,450
SSD was a movement.
They were more than a band.

714
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:52,818
They were definitely a movement.

715
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:57,588
<i>They had an aura about them</i>
<i>and an image about them.</i>

716
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:00,454
<i>The fans were dedicated.</i>

717
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:07,493
Now we had music in our area.
We had Boston hardcore punk rock.

718
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:10,204
<i>It was almost like a call to arms, you know.</i>

719
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:15,506
<i>He went on that radio program and said,</i>
<i>"We're starting a scene."</i>

720
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,740
If they're starting a scene,
I want to be in that scene.

721
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,838
- Who is it?
- Springer.

722
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,040
Oh, my goodness.

723
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,055
This suddenly becomes very interesting.

724
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:30,584
James J? Lethal?

725
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,995
I think we should open with <i>Decontrol.</i>

726
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:38,591
Then into the <i>Drug Fools</i> then the <i>Police.</i>

727
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:42,604
Not <i>Police Beat</i> but <i>Police.</i>
That's the first set list right there. Ever.

728
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:47,606
Okay, here it is, Hardcore Punk Gallery East.
There it is, this is the first show.

729
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:49,941
Let's go. That's the first one,
why don't you talk about that.

730
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:51,776
- That's the first one.
- Yeah, this is it.

731
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:53,338
That's the first one,
see it was called Hardcore Punk,

732
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:54,441
it wasn't even the name of a band.

733
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:57,646
Don't be wearing anybody else's.
We got our own shirt.

734
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:00,286
Fucking beautiful, isn't it?

735
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,155
Look at them all, look at them all.

736
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,822
- Holy shit.
- "Liberty or Give us Death."

737
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:13,866
That was a really good show.

738
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:17,532
Me and most of my friends
came from broken homes.

739
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:19,236
So we were pissed off,

740
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:21,903
but we didn't really know
what we were pissed off about.

741
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:24,606
Just that, you know, life sucks,
and we're stuck here

742
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:26,171
in Braintree, Massachusetts.

743
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,685
Some kids will write Gang Green
on the wall at school or something, and...

744
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,914
We'd appreciate it and shit.
And just when we'd get back...

745
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:35,321
And then underneath it, someone will write
"sucks" underneath it, right?

746
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,553
And then someone else
scratches out "sucks"

747
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:39,652
and puts "is excellent" or "is number one,"

748
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:41,629
and then someone puts two zeros
behind the one.

749
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:44,861
One hundred, you know.
It happens every time, you know.

750
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:08,622
The whole Gang Green experience for us
was this continuous... It was not an act.

751
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:12,992
You know, what you got on stage,
you pretty much got everywhere we went,

752
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:15,793
and imagine how tiring that gets.

753
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:21,065
Because you're drunk all the time,
and you're running from the law frequently,

754
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:23,668
'cause you're making trouble
everywhere you go.

755
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:27,005
I wanted to call the band Gang Green,
but no one else liked the name.

756
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:29,545
So, they liked Jerry's Kids better,
I don't know.

757
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:48,191
DYS was the Department Of Youth Services,

758
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:54,026
which is the organization in Massachusetts
which locks up the juvenile delinquents.

759
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:18,688
I think one of the classic clashes
of the generation was

760
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:22,459
the Negative FX show where they were
playing with Mission of Burma's final show.

761
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:25,296
So you've got in the same ballroom
in front of a thousand people,

762
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,496
you've got Choke and Negative FX
and the entire Boston crew

763
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:30,870
and you've got five hundred
Mission of Burma fans.

764
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:33,910
And within two songs,
it degenerates into a riot.

765
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:51,020
Might makes right. Might makes right.

766
00:53:58,301 --> 00:54:00,235
<i>We ain't gonna stop. Fuck you!</i>

767
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:52,414
<i>Negative FX's career was so short.</i>
<i>Six flyers, five shows, one album.</i>

768
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:54,286
Eighteen songs.

769
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:01,295
Boston and DC were always like this,
and didn't like New York.

770
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:03,696
And then, you know,
there we are in the middle

771
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:06,702
and they were always coming to our shows,
to the shows.

772
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,704
When we went to New York it was war.

773
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:12,333
It was like, pull up in front of
the Rock Hotel in Al's black van.

774
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,536
Everybody gets out.
You know, we've got black "X"s

775
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,101
on the back of our hands with Sharpies.

776
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:18,113
The first time they came down, we were like,

777
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:21,048
"Oh, cool, SSD, blah, blah,"
and they were all kind of nice.

778
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:23,142
They were all cool.
They were all timid, you know.

779
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:25,687
Second time they came down,
they tried to come down

780
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:30,249
with a little bit of hard rock attitude.
I guess they heard DC kind of did whatever.

781
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,425
Third time they came down,
they got housed.

782
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:37,626
And we sent them home fucking...
We sent them back to the suburbs fucking

783
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:39,726
rethinking their whole shit, like, you know,

784
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:41,634
"Don't fucking come to New York
and fuck with us man,

785
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:44,538
"we're used to fucking fighting
with, like, crazy fucking Puerto Ricans,

786
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:48,407
"who, like, stab people,
attack us with fucking guns, bats,

787
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:50,036
"fucking hockey sticks and everything else."

788
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:51,375
<i>It was the jungle.</i>

789
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:56,385
<i>And you were in Lower East Side,</i>
<i>and, you know, there were the Hells Angels,</i>

790
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:59,013
<i>there were the hippies,</i>
<i>and then there were these rockers,</i>

791
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:01,614
who just had to be acknowledged.

792
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,265
We weren't rich kids
pretending to be punks.

793
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:13,427
We were, like, real punks being punks.

794
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:15,801
<i>I fucking slept in fucking squats at nights</i>

795
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,238
with my fucking pit bull, Lucifer,
in bed with me

796
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:20,538
so the rats wouldn't fucking run across me,

797
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:23,807
you know, and my fucking door
was held up with a chain.

798
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:25,881
We were just doing what we were doing,
and didn't know...

799
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,507
I didn't know,
what the fuck was I documenting?

800
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:30,417
<i>Me getting fucking dusted at a show?</i>
<i>You know...</i>

801
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:34,650
The kids in New York were like,
"Wow, we suck!"

802
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:37,488
<i>"We don't have money. We're not smart.</i>

803
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,892
<i>"We're not good-looking.</i>
<i>We're hung up on everything.</i>

804
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:43,831
<i>"We're all fucked up on drugs."</i>
<i>You know, so it's kind of like,</i>

805
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,529
we really worked hard
to, like, put New York on the map

806
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:50,171
for New York, as a scene.

807
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:55,405
After doing intense research
and really going into the club scene,

808
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:59,380
we found out, from reliable sources,
that the best thing we should do

809
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:00,438
was go to New York.

810
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:06,315
When the Bad Brains came to town,
they changed the face of music overnight.

811
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:36,347
Jerry Williams, he invited us
to his rehearsal spot and recording studio,

812
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:39,047
and said, "You know, you cats can live here.

813
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:43,684
"If you need a place to record,
please feel free."

814
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,026
<i>171 Avenue A.</i>
<i>It was an abandoned glass shop.</i>

815
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:52,966
We cleaned out the glass store
and built a stage at one end,

816
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:56,062
and a glass-enclosed booth
at the other end,

817
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:59,336
and started rehearsing there,

818
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:02,867
and started having
illegal weekend gigs there.

819
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:07,645
That was like the beginning of the scene
in New York, kind of like, when we came.

820
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:11,284
You know, that was the haven.
That was the place.

821
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:13,288
And everybody would hang out
and we'd play music.

822
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:16,951
Sometimes there would even be concerts
that we would do, you know.

823
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:20,154
And I was there when the Bad Brains
recorded that whole first album.

824
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:24,030
I was up all night, till 5:00, 6:00
in the morning through all those sessions,

825
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,763
'cause I was living at 171 A
with the Bad Brains

826
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,532
while they were recording the album.

827
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:33,702
Being in the booth...
"The booth," it was a box.

828
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:37,837
In the box with Jerry and Harley
and John Joseph and the Bad Brains

829
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:41,577
when they first listened to
their final mixes of the ROIR cassette.

830
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:43,081
<i>Then it was even a big thing.</i>

831
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:45,245
And never mind the sound
that they got out of the room,

832
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:47,585
if you listen to that recording.

833
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:50,558
You know, bands spend how much,
$100,000 now on a recording

834
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:52,595
and they can't get it right on Pro Tools?

835
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:57,861
These guys were recording four tracks,
in, like, an empty storefront.

836
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,868
You know, and it came out amazing.

837
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:03,167
<i>The Big Takeover.</i>
The beginning of that song.

838
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:08,534
The intensity of that build-up.
That fucking quiet...

839
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:19,750
And just... And you just fucking...
You're just waiting for it to fucking...

840
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:25,050
Just let it go, you know,
just waiting for that, like...

841
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:29,491
And it's on!

842
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:26,149
This is a lost tape. LA '82.

843
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:28,986
We was with Greg and them,
they took us to this rehearsal spot

844
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:31,083
in the studio, that's where it was!

845
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,958
- Now you remember.
- And they took us to this studio, right,

846
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,827
and what tripped me out
about the shit was that

847
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:38,594
it was a lot of heavy metal
motherfuckers in there, right?

848
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:40,158
And they was like...

849
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:43,466
I was playing the pinball machine
in the spot and it was like, we just in LA,

850
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:46,770
you know, I was like, they said we
could record or practice in this spot, right.

851
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:50,335
So I remember, I was tripping because
the heavy metal dudes was coming out,

852
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:53,211
practicing their shit and their little
dances and their walks and shit.

853
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:57,685
Like it was really a metal workshop spot.
And I was tripping on that.

854
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:13,164
The Beastie Boys surfaced as a joke band.
They worshipped the Bad Brains,

855
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:17,605
<i>and they called themselves the Beastie Boys</i>
<i>because the initials were B.B.</i>

856
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:20,299
They, just like everyone else,

857
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:24,904
were as excited by the Bad Brains

858
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:28,041
and the emerging hardcore scene
as anyone else,

859
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:30,915
but they were kids.

860
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:36,857
They were 15, 16 years old at that time and
they didn't really have the musical chops

861
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:41,257
to imitate what they heard going on.

862
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:46,029
So they said, "Well, we're going to have fun,
we're going to have fun with it."

863
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:49,435
And they're still having fun with it,
you know,

864
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:51,973
they're having fun with music of all kinds.

865
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:54,009
But originally it was...

866
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:57,979
They wanted to have fun
with hardcore punk rock, you know.

867
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:00,977
I started Agnostic Front
about three years ago.

868
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:05,054
I wanted a band to speak of social unrest,

869
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,080
political aspects to it...

870
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:12,389
He is New York hardcore. Vinnie Stigma
is New York hardcore. Hands down.

871
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:15,659
You know, in a funny way,
Vinnie Stigma has an incredible mind.

872
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,996
All the out of town bands
used to stay at my house.

873
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:21,798
Because I was the only one with an
apartment down here near CBGB's.

874
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:23,702
You know, I was the only one with a phone.

875
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:26,173
- You know...
- The closest clean bathroom to CB's.

876
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:27,334
Yeah, right.

877
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:55,495
In a larger city,
where there's a scene going on,

878
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:58,540
it's like there's this
stream of energy going, right?

879
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:02,009
There is a bunch of other bands,
be they punk or whatever,

880
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:06,174
and all you have to kind of do
is jump into that stream and get wet.

881
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:10,150
In the middle of the Midwest,
you have to dig the fucking well.

882
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:11,686
There's no stream.

883
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:15,622
So you have to dig and you have to dig
and you have to dig until you find water.

884
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:19,092
And that's it, there's nobody,
absolutely nobody to help you.

885
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:23,164
There's nobody putting on shows.
There's no people managing bands.

886
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:28,833
Doing this stuff. So it is...
The work ethic had to be really high.

887
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:47,276
Really deep down I wanted
to be a part of it. You know what I mean?

888
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:50,951
It's a weird thing. Like you go
and listen to these records,

889
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:53,284
you get all pumped up about them
and you want to be in the scene

890
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:56,621
but you're like not in that,
you know, your band is not that band.

891
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,700
In Raleigh, we didn't
have that many places to play.

892
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:07,998
We'd run out of Kiwanis Clubs
and VFW halls,

893
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:13,064
but luckily, the one club in town,
The Brewery,

894
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:16,137
<i>would let us rent the place out for $200</i>

895
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:19,909
<i>on Sundays, and do these little</i>
<i>Sunday matinees. Sort of like CBGB's.</i>

896
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:21,278
Man, we had everybody.

897
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:24,342
We had Black Flag. We had Suicidal.
We had Cro-Mags.

898
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:27,150
We had Battalion of Saints. We had DOA.

899
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:30,249
Plus we could always do our, like,
local shows.

900
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:40,431
Austin, Texas was a great little scene.
It was 35 bands there.

901
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:43,768
And then there was a little scene
in Houston. And you're in like a vacuum.

902
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,171
It's like you're a thousand miles
from anywhere.

903
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:09,688
<i>MDC was a record...</i>
<i>When we brought that record home,</i>

904
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:12,819
these hairs on the back of your neck
just stood up.

905
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:18,026
It was so, so extreme.

906
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:21,400
That's what we did have in common with
the Minor Threats and the SS Decontrols

907
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:25,964
and the Zero Defects and the Articles
of Faiths and the DOAs and the Fears,

908
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:30,376
<i>was this pumped-up adrenalin</i>
<i>that we can't just sit back and go,</i>

909
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:34,910
<i>Hey, ho, let's go</i>
<i>Hey, ho, let's go</i>

910
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:37,817
And we were feeling
"Dead cops, dead cops, dead cops!"

911
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:42,756
You know, the adrenalin that was
in the hardcore movement was exciting.

912
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:44,452
We kind of, like, took it up a notch.

913
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:48,588
A lot of the skinheads on the East Coast
were like, "Oh, yeah, we're down with MDC.

914
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:52,100
"Yeah, we're fucking hardcore. Yeah,
fucking skinheads, hate the cops."

915
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:55,194
And then big Dave would be like
"Oh, yeah, really? Well, I'm a fag!"

916
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:58,763
And they would be like...
Just totally, totally blown away.

917
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:01,207
He was like, "Yeah, last night
the guitar player took a shit on me

918
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:02,301
"over at this guy's house."

919
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:03,572
Everyone's just like,

920
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:06,615
their hero just kind of, like,
wasn't a hero to them anymore.

921
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:09,981
I wore a dress everywhere,
with bad makeup, without shaving.

922
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:13,488
I played homocore shows.
There was just part of me that liked to say,

923
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:17,788
"I'm not trying to fit in.
I'm not trying to be one of the crew,

924
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:20,522
"you know, one of the boys in the pit."

925
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:24,059
My punk thing has gone beyond that.

926
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:27,000
I'm the queerest person here.
I'm the weirdest person here.

927
01:08:34,743 --> 01:08:36,904
At one point we thought
we would move to LA

928
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:38,674
because they had
a happening scene out there

929
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:42,114
and we thought maybe we could be
part of this, you know, out there.

930
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:45,745
We did a little tour out to the West Coast
and we stopped in LA

931
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:49,257
and we got out of the truck on Hollywood
and Vine and looked around and we're like,

932
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:54,058
"Man, let's get the hell out of here."
We actually went to San Francisco.

933
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:57,827
<i>There was a handful of bands in</i>
<i>San Francisco and a handful of bands in LA</i>

934
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,733
and those were the bands
that started this whole thing.

935
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:03,636
The Mabuhay Gardens was the clubhouse.

936
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:07,369
And everybody met at the clubhouse
every night, seven nights a week.

937
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:09,773
And there was always three bands playing.

938
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:12,609
<i>We all knew each other,</i>
<i>and we all played shows together,</i>

939
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:15,115
<i>and we were the San Francisco scene.</i>

940
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:18,311
There seemed to be two approaches
bands would take in hardcore.

941
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:22,289
One was, "What is the thing that the kids
are going to like,

942
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:25,418
"and how are they going to respond
positively to our band,

943
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:27,462
"and what can we do to make that happen?"

944
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:28,929
And then there was
the other school of thought,

945
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:32,297
which was just like, "Fuck with the crowd,
get them pissed off."

946
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:27,821
We were known as the band
that you loved to hate.

947
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:32,486
<i>The crowd hated us, really. I mean,</i>
<i>because we weren't doing what fit the mold.</i>

948
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:34,426
...really hated
about when punk rock first started

949
01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:35,929
and we were coming out being so slow.

950
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:38,330
They thought we were, like,
a fucking target or something.

951
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:42,234
You know, "Oh, these guys are..."
You know. I hated that at first.

952
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:44,431
Right in the face! Fuck that shit!

953
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:48,135
I was reading an <i>NME</i>
where there was this cat named Moby

954
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:52,938
who claimed he had been
an original singer in Flipper,

955
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:55,779
at least according to the article.
That's what it said.

956
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:59,446
I sang with Flipper when I was 16.
'Cause Will Shatter had been thrown in jail.

957
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:01,648
I knew the lyrics to all the songs,
so I said, "I'll..."

958
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:05,990
So for two days I was Flipper's,
you know, half Bruce Loose and myself.

959
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:44,727
This is really weird.
They've got punk rock in Canada.

960
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,132
Because people's impression
of Canada was like, well,

961
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:49,966
a lot of trees, a lot of mountains,
a lot of snow, lumberjacks.

962
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:51,370
That kind of thing. Snowmobiles.

963
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,601
<i>And, like, how could they have</i>
<i>punk rock from there?</i>

964
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:57,578
We had one big show up there.
It was us, Black Flag and 7 Seconds.

965
01:11:57,646 --> 01:12:01,377
<i>And it was called Hardcore '81. So that was</i>
<i>the first time anybody really used that term.</i>

966
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:04,044
They coined that term.
They started the music.

967
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:09,719
They were phenomenal.
Musically phenomenal, ideologically cool,

968
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:11,783
<i>and freaking Canadians!</i>

969
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:25,763
There wasn't a lot of small labels

970
01:12:26,575 --> 01:12:30,534
when we started putting out records,
so there wasn't much of a model for it.

971
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:33,740
SST had that quintessential

972
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:38,249
<i>LA hardcore, DIY aesthetic and ethic.</i>

973
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,788
SST Records originally

974
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:44,252
stood for Solid State Transmitters.

975
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:49,962
We had one storage place and it was where
Greg's electronic stuff was all thrown in.

976
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,561
And it was only $100 a month.

977
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:55,432
And it was one room
with a bathroom and a shower.

978
01:12:55,504 --> 01:12:57,699
<i>So we just took corners of the floor in there.</i>

979
01:12:57,773 --> 01:12:59,707
<i>I did all the mail order business at the time,</i>

980
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:05,145
<i>so I actually slept underneath my...</i>
<i>You know, my mail order stuff.</i>

981
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:08,342
So, you know,
it was basically just about work.

982
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:12,649
<i>We got $5 a day,</i>
<i>which we called "the dough,"</i>

983
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:16,987
which we distributed to everyone
and that's, basically, you would,

984
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:20,927
you know, this is what you would
buy your food with, this $5.

985
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:23,930
There got to be a point where, like,
you'd have, like, two quarters

986
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:25,466
and you'd go get a candy bar.

987
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:28,992
And you'd shop at 7-Eleven, like, "Okay,
a Three Musketeers has like

988
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:32,974
"half a gram more
than a Snickers bar does. Okay."

989
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,335
And you'd have to clean
the chocolate off your mouth,

990
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,572
'cause you'd walk into SST and, like,

991
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:39,748
"You've got, did you get food?"

992
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:42,045
And you're like, "Uh, yeah..."

993
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,548
I mean, we were broke!

994
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:51,418
<i>One day I get a call from Henry and he says,</i>
<i>"Black Flag is looking for a bass player,"</i>

995
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:54,929
<i>and I said, "That's cool."</i>

996
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,795
<i>You know, they were my favorite band</i>
<i>at the time, you know.</i>

997
01:13:57,866 --> 01:14:00,892
<i>Henry and I had had a little thing</i>
<i>and it was over, and like I said,</i>

998
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:03,335
<i>when he called to say,</i>
<i>"Do you wanna play?"</i>

999
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:05,032
<i>He was very clear</i>
<i>there was not going to be anything.</i>

1000
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:07,200
And I was like, "Yeah, I get it,
we're not going to be anything."

1001
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:11,007
So there was no... That was explicitly stated,

1002
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:14,412
which was fine, you know,
it was fine for both of us.

1003
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:20,250
<i>But I think there was a moment</i>
<i>when it got a little uncomfortable</i>

1004
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:23,917
<i>which was when I saw the cover</i>
<i>of the</i> Slip It In <i>record.</i>

1005
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:28,088
<i>We had done our first recording</i>
<i>and I saw the cover of the</i> Slip It In <i>record,</i>

1006
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:31,098
which was, in my opinion, sort of

1007
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:34,465
making fun of women
or putting women in a certain place,

1008
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:36,600
and I suddenly felt like...

1009
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:42,867
"But..." You know what I mean? It was like,
"What am I doing here?

1010
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:45,914
"I mean, if you guys hate women, why..."
You know what I mean?

1011
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:48,381
It wasn't like, "Goddamn it, how dare you?"

1012
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:53,046
It was like, "But if you don't like girls,
why am I here?" You know, it was like,

1013
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:57,990
I felt inadequate because I felt that
that reflected how they viewed women.

1014
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:27,951
I never really noticed that I
was a girl and everybody else was a guy.

1015
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:32,460
There were actually women in the scene.
They tended towards being

1016
01:15:32,895 --> 01:15:37,229
the record-keepers.
The women were generally behind a camera

1017
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:39,026
<i>or they were running a fanzine.</i>

1018
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:43,367
I'm going to say that
there weren't a lot of women onstage,

1019
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:46,305
but there were
a good chunk of women in the audience

1020
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,969
and you got to know each other
pretty quickly.

1021
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:51,478
And you certainly
hung out with all the guys.

1022
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:54,015
Nothing got you less respect
from these boys

1023
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:56,743
than, you know, showing your tits.

1024
01:15:57,419 --> 01:15:59,614
Which is not the case nowadays,
I don't think.

1025
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:01,747
I think all those boys would be happy
to see someone's tits.

1026
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,755
<i>Take off your panties, now!</i>

1027
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:13,357
<i>I want to see some cunt in there.</i>

1028
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:15,535
Oh, the Nig Heist.

1029
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:23,740
<i>Well, the Nig Heist is a name I came up with,</i>
<i>squatting, you know, on Hollywood Blvd.,</i>

1030
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:25,803
in rundown hotel rooms.

1031
01:16:26,114 --> 01:16:31,108
And one of my good friends
at the time was a black guy and...

1032
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:36,214
Eugene, and so, you know,
we smoked cigarettes, and then he would

1033
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:40,057
come up and steal one of my cigarettes
and he would say, "Nig Heist."

1034
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:44,795
<i>Now, we are the Nig Heist</i>
<i>and we wanna fuck your girlfriend.</i>

1035
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:51,605
<i>Last night we played DC and we had</i>
<i>live sex happen on stage.</i>

1036
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:56,269
<i>This little skinhead about 14</i>
<i>let me stick my fucking cock in his butt,</i>

1037
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:58,210
<i>and it was tremendous.</i>

1038
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,215
<i>You guys should give me a hand for that,</i>
<i>come on.</i>

1039
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:06,619
<i>A nice big round of applause for me</i>
<i>sticking it into a nice little skinhead's butt.</i>

1040
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:11,022
Mugger is an incredible guy.
Mugger's a runaway

1041
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:15,655
who ends up being a roadie for Black Flag.
Then the accountant for SST.

1042
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:18,791
Then puts himself through college,
he's a CPA now.

1043
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:21,135
It was all through working.

1044
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:25,799
Greg and Chuck gave me
a 25% membership

1045
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:27,967
in SST.

1046
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:30,840
I wanted a certain type of artist,

1047
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:35,110
and we disagreed about that
and they basically just bought me out.

1048
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:40,280
I took all the money that they gave me
and I invested in technology

1049
01:17:40,355 --> 01:17:43,882
and other types of ventures

1050
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:46,325
that was very productive for me.

1051
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:49,592
And basically, you know,
I'm independently wealthy at this time

1052
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:54,068
from that investment, from SST.
So, that's my story.

1053
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:09,474
The whole myth of California
being laid-back and mellow

1054
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:11,383
is pretty laughable.

1055
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:15,412
If you grew up in the punk scene
in Hollywood in the early '80s,

1056
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:17,219
it was anything but mellow.

1057
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:20,993
It was violent, you know,
there was always a fight, every night.

1058
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:22,462
There was some action going on.

1059
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:26,591
Just every fucking night we had to fucking
throw down with somebody, you know.

1060
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:31,537
In 1980 I wanted to get something together.

1061
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:36,773
So I came up with
Los Angeles Death Squad.

1062
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:38,846
Which is LADS.

1063
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:42,415
There was LADS, there was FFF,
there was Circle One.

1064
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:44,842
<i>With Tom Macias, rest in peace.</i>

1065
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:48,347
What are considered today
to be the punk rock gangs,

1066
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:50,391
pretty much were gangs,

1067
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:55,561
in the sense of Crips, Bloods,
White Fence, things like that.

1068
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:57,530
They weren't as well defined.

1069
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:02,102
You know, they weren't like
little drug cartels, or anything.

1070
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:05,697
Nobody carried Uzis, you know.
It wasn't that type of a gang,

1071
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:10,040
but it was definitely a social clique
of people who knew each other, hung out,

1072
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:11,704
and protected each other.

1073
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:14,943
<i>John Macias, singer of Circle One,</i>

1074
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:19,248
<i>who were contemporaries, really, at</i>
<i>the same time as Suicidal Tendencies.</i>

1075
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:21,255
<i>He had his gang, The Family.</i>

1076
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:24,815
<i>Here he is just about to, you know,</i>
<i>to take one up with this fellow here,</i>

1077
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:27,691
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>you can see the fear in this guy's eyes.</i>

1078
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:32,700
<i>And I mean, this guy was really scared.</i>
<i>Rollins was scared shitless of this guy.</i>

1079
01:19:42,577 --> 01:19:46,775
If a cop car drove by a punk show,
it was no big deal.

1080
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:50,012
And if one or two drove by, it was nothing.

1081
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:53,851
But when six pull up and park,
it would always turn into a riot.

1082
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:57,486
If there was a small incident
they'd come on strong

1083
01:19:57,559 --> 01:19:59,083
and they'd look to take control

1084
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:03,359
<i>with, you know, 30 or 40 squad cars</i>
<i>and a helicopter.</i>

1085
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:08,294
Hundreds of angry punk rockers rioted
in Huntington, California Saturday.

1086
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:12,670
<i>The rioters were angered at the overbooking</i>
<i>of a suburban Los Angeles concert hall</i>

1087
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:15,835
<i>designed to accommodate 450 people.</i>

1088
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:19,103
<i>As many as 200 people</i>
<i>were turned away from the hall.</i>

1089
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:22,412
<i>The punk rock fans</i>
<i>went on an hour-long rampage.</i>

1090
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:26,580
<i>The rioters are reported to have done</i>
<i>$25,000 damage to businesses</i>

1091
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:30,091
<i>and a church before officers managed</i>
<i>to quell the disturbance.</i>

1092
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:35,691
<i>Forty-one people, most of them juveniles,</i>
<i>were arrested and 10 law officers were hurt.</i>

1093
01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:37,322
The cops always started it.

1094
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:42,166
It's not like a bunch of kids go up to
armed, uniformed men and go, "Come on!"

1095
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:44,097
They know what happens.

1096
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:47,275
The cop... I mean,
they would try and pull me into it.

1097
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:50,778
I'll never forget some LA storm trooper
cop walking up to me and saying,

1098
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,814
"Did you just call me a motherfucker?"

1099
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:57,147
I'm like, "Oh," I was trembling,
because I just know that the guy,

1100
01:20:57,285 --> 01:21:00,743
cat and mouse, the guy can take me
into jail any time he wants,

1101
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:04,553
and I was like... And he's like, you know,

1102
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:07,595
"What's the matter, you a fucking faggot?"
I'm like, "No."

1103
01:21:07,662 --> 01:21:11,063
I'm like... This is a cop.
I don't know what to do.

1104
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:14,533
<i>Cops would just march in</i>
<i>and just shut the show down.</i>

1105
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:17,434
<i>They would literally form a line</i>
<i>at the front of the stage,</i>

1106
01:21:17,505 --> 01:21:22,772
I remember seeing kids lying on the floor
that had already been beaten up so badly

1107
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:25,108
they couldn't move, and I could just
remember cops standing over them

1108
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:26,943
swinging their batons,
beating the hell out of them.

1109
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:28,846
I mean, this was years before Rodney King.

1110
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:31,010
People were trying to walk to their cars,
they would beat you.

1111
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:32,883
And try and chase you down the street.

1112
01:21:32,954 --> 01:21:36,014
They'd smash... People were driving,
they'd bust the window,

1113
01:21:36,091 --> 01:21:39,618
and grab them out of the car
and start beating them. It was like a war.

1114
01:21:39,694 --> 01:21:44,097
It was an ass-kicking. Lining up
and then wading into kids and beating them.

1115
01:21:44,933 --> 01:21:47,902
It was fucked up. It was so fucked up.

1116
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:51,536
Our crime was that we seemed different.

1117
01:21:52,173 --> 01:21:55,802
And I think a police mentality

1118
01:21:55,877 --> 01:22:01,338
or you know, ultra-establishment mentality
is to stamp out something that's different.

1119
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:07,480
You don't analyze it and look
at why it's different, you just stamp it out.

1120
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:10,353
I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear...

1121
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,689
I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear...

1122
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:16,458
...that I will faithfully execute...
...that I will faithfully execute...

1123
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:19,091
...the office of President
of the United States.

1124
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:21,431
...the office of President
of the United States.

1125
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:25,735
- And will to the best of my ability...
- And will to the best of my ability...

1126
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:30,039
...preserve, protect and defend...
...preserve, protect and defend...

1127
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:33,569
...the Constitution of the United States.
...the Constitution of the United States.

1128
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:36,242
- So help you God.
- So help me God.

1129
01:22:36,318 --> 01:22:39,253
<i>When Reagan won the first time</i>
<i>was almost like unbelievable.</i>

1130
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:41,619
<i>Something could be... How could this be?</i>

1131
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:45,922
<i>Then the second time he won,</i>
<i>it was very disillusioning for myself.</i>

1132
01:22:46,161 --> 01:22:49,756
Those first four years of punk rock for me,
'80 to '84, was all this hope,

1133
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:53,358
and then after that, it got cynical,
and punk rock fragmented

1134
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,699
into many, many, many different scenes.

1135
01:22:55,804 --> 01:23:00,434
A lot of the people who
had started this local music scene

1136
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:04,274
in 1979 and '80,
had become a little bit disillusioned.

1137
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:06,507
You know, the baby was no longer cute.

1138
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:11,644
'85, '86 was a total decline
of the punk rock scene.

1139
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:16,848
And then everybody who started the scenes
all left it, one by one by one by one.

1140
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:19,792
I came in in August of '81.

1141
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:24,360
And I'd say by the end of '85,

1142
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:27,694
it was over.

1143
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:31,495
<i>These people were not like sheep.</i>

1144
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:38,478
<i>They were not like heavy metal sheep</i>
<i>that would go see their band,</i>

1145
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:42,942
<i>their spandex-pants band,</i>
<i>over and over again.</i>

1146
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:46,182
<i>If you... They could turn on you.</i>

1147
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:50,089
And chances are, in the three-year
period that you're into it,

1148
01:23:50,892 --> 01:23:52,655
they are going to get disinterested.

1149
01:23:52,727 --> 01:23:57,096
Or your time was up, whichever is first.

1150
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:02,363
So basically, the time was up.

1151
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:05,699
You might think like, "Well, yeah,
but you really checked out on hardcore."

1152
01:24:05,774 --> 01:24:09,676
I never fucking checked out.
Hardcore checked out, not me.

1153
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:12,876
<i>For me, the violence was stupid.</i>
<i>It just became stupid</i>

1154
01:24:12,947 --> 01:24:14,938
<i>and I saw my own role in the stupidity.</i>

1155
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:17,075
In 1984, I remember
it was a Minutemen show,

1156
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:19,643
it was the last time I've punched somebody.

1157
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:21,484
A guy hit my brother
and I punched him and I thought,

1158
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:24,150
"That's the end of that. I'm done."

1159
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:27,991
And I just didn't... I felt like
the violence had become too central.

1160
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:30,757
And it was clearly alienating to most people.

1161
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:35,291
It was ridiculous.
So I thought like, "I'm out. I'm out of this."

1162
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:37,700
And a lot of my friends were out of it, too.
They were like,

1163
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:40,104
"We're just not... This sucks."
It was a bummer.

1164
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:42,541
I think that was kind of the end

1165
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:46,102
of that era of hardcore.

1166
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:45,905
The last-ever Black Flag show
that I acknowledge

1167
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:49,569
happened in 1986 in Detroit
at Graystone, it's a hall.

1168
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:54,411
Weeks later, I'm in DC
visiting friends and family,

1169
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:57,341
and Greg called me at my mom's house,

1170
01:25:57,418 --> 01:26:00,683
where I was kind of camping out,
and he said,

1171
01:26:00,755 --> 01:26:03,519
"I'm just calling to tell you
that I quit Black Flag."

1172
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:06,151
I go, "But it's your band."

1173
01:26:06,961 --> 01:26:09,429
He goes, "Well, I quit." I went, "Okay."

1174
01:26:10,465 --> 01:26:13,400
And that was it.

1175
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:18,737
I decided in 1986, it's like,
"You know, it's a good time to stop now."

1176
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:21,036
Black Flag was left without

1177
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:24,906
the culture around it.

1178
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:30,280
It was back to where we started.

1179
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:55,039
The Bad Brains, who had also
recently become Rastafarians,

1180
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:58,071
hit their spiritual crisis.

1181
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:02,774
It's like, "Are we going to be real
Rastafarians and play reggae music,

1182
01:27:03,151 --> 01:27:04,778
"or are we gonna

1183
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:09,218
"follow out what we've been doing
for the past few years,

1184
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:12,953
"this incredible style of music
that we've created.

1185
01:27:13,027 --> 01:27:15,518
"Are we gonna swing with it?"

1186
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:21,930
And I don't think
they ever really answered that question.

1187
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:25,628
And all of a sudden there'd be
these four dudes up there playing reggae.

1188
01:27:25,707 --> 01:27:29,199
And I just remember a couple of times
just being like, "You know, that's cool

1189
01:27:29,277 --> 01:27:32,644
"but it's not what I paid for
and I'm done with it, you know."

1190
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:36,614
The Bad Brains, kind of, to me got
pigeonholed as that fireplug band

1191
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:38,276
that you can never trust them,

1192
01:27:38,353 --> 01:27:40,082
you know what I mean?
You can't do shows with them,

1193
01:27:40,154 --> 01:27:42,179
and so on and so on and so on.
And all the horror stories.

1194
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:44,987
And you know,
it's just once you disappoint people,

1195
01:27:45,059 --> 01:27:49,860
especially people that are really
short-attention-span people,

1196
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:52,365
then you're kind of at a loss for words.

1197
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:56,096
The thing that hangs over the band is,

1198
01:27:56,804 --> 01:27:59,068
is it has to do with HR, who he is,

1199
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:02,132
and his vision and his ability
to be as deep as he is

1200
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:06,977
and to be as engaging as he is,
and also there is a personal element to that,

1201
01:28:07,515 --> 01:28:12,179
that's totally self destructive.
He's like a Crowleyan character.

1202
01:28:12,253 --> 01:28:16,622
He's a real character in his generation.
He's a real somebody.

1203
01:28:16,691 --> 01:28:21,788
He's a myth. He's a living legend.
And he is. And he thinks that way.

1204
01:28:22,497 --> 01:28:24,021
I love the guy, you know.

1205
01:28:24,232 --> 01:28:27,531
I've seen him mess up a lot of deals.

1206
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:30,571
You know, this band really
could have been out there,

1207
01:28:31,239 --> 01:28:34,265
but I kind of understand his conflict.

1208
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:49,651
The first wave of Boston hardcore

1209
01:28:49,724 --> 01:28:52,989
as, like, the foundations,

1210
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:55,325
and the structure of the house...

1211
01:28:55,396 --> 01:28:58,422
And then all of a sudden, like '84 or '85,

1212
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:01,267
all of us started putting
pretty weird curtains on the house.

1213
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,600
And like, you know,

1214
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:06,401
it gave the house
a little bit of a different look.

1215
01:29:06,474 --> 01:29:11,377
The name of the band is DYS.
We've been together for about three years.

1216
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:16,139
And we used to be
a hardcore punk rock band,

1217
01:29:16,217 --> 01:29:18,549
now just a hard rock 'n' roll band.

1218
01:29:29,163 --> 01:29:31,927
So next year Gang Green is
on Roadrunner Records.

1219
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:33,762
They've got a new record coming out,
<i>You Got It,</i>

1220
01:29:33,835 --> 01:29:35,700
and it has a crossover sound into metal,

1221
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:37,965
and you know Gang Green's
is a big rock band

1222
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:41,008
and they're going to get
this big skateboard staging

1223
01:29:41,075 --> 01:29:43,339
<i>and they bought the amps</i>
<i>from Megadeth you know.</i>

1224
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:45,174
<i>They bought like 18 cabinets</i>
<i>from Megadeth,</i>

1225
01:29:45,246 --> 01:29:46,543
<i>you know, and six of them work.</i>

1226
01:29:46,614 --> 01:29:49,014
<i>But you wanted this big thing</i>
<i>and Gang Green was going to be</i>

1227
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:54,077
<i>this big, rock, skateboard, you know, entity.</i>

1228
01:29:54,155 --> 01:29:57,056
<i>Which they should be,</i>
<i>which they are, they're great.</i>

1229
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:59,184
It was like Spinal Tap, it was hilarious.

1230
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:01,751
I think we used the whole set
once on the tour.

1231
01:30:01,829 --> 01:30:03,626
But we carried it, you know.

1232
01:30:07,468 --> 01:30:10,960
We played in LA, and there was a kid
kneeling on the stage

1233
01:30:11,038 --> 01:30:13,871
with his shirt off and he was...
Tears were pouring down his face,

1234
01:30:13,941 --> 01:30:18,105
and he was going, "Play something fast.
Play something fast, please!"

1235
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:22,013
And, like, people were hurling shit at us.
And it was, you know,

1236
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:25,052
it was obvious that, you know,
the love affair was over.

1237
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:48,465
'84, '85, was really when...

1238
01:30:48,543 --> 01:30:52,570
New York,
being the late bloomers of hardcore,

1239
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:55,616
was when New York finally
got a voice of their own.

1240
01:31:07,428 --> 01:31:10,397
What the Cro-Mags did was

1241
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:13,298
present that Bad Brains approach

1242
01:31:15,002 --> 01:31:18,460
through the lifestyle

1243
01:31:18,539 --> 01:31:22,134
of the streets of New York, you know.

1244
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:25,873
And that's where the tattoos
and the rough edge come from.

1245
01:31:25,947 --> 01:31:28,381
I mean, they were street kids, basically.

1246
01:31:28,449 --> 01:31:32,783
People try to often give Cro-Mags credit
for being a definitive hardcore band,

1247
01:31:33,554 --> 01:31:37,957
and, you know, I graciously accept that,
but I don't 100% agree.

1248
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:41,328
In a way we were,
and in a way we weren't, because

1249
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:44,624
as far as I'm concerned, the Cro-Mags really

1250
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:48,500
came to be towards the end
of the first wave of hardcore.

1251
01:31:48,936 --> 01:31:52,394
So, in a way, we kind of wrapped

1252
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:57,171
all the most powerful aspects
of all of those early years.

1253
01:31:57,245 --> 01:32:02,683
Hardcore, definitely, it was like a pebble
that had a ripple effect.

1254
01:32:02,783 --> 01:32:05,650
But ironically, it never got recognized

1255
01:32:06,454 --> 01:32:11,448
by the mainstream world.
But it influenced it.

1256
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:17,561
You always say, "I wish I knew now
what I knew then." But not in this instance.

1257
01:32:17,632 --> 01:32:21,864
Because, like, it was so groundbreaking,
it was so new and fresh, you know.

1258
01:32:21,936 --> 01:32:28,398
And like, and when it ended, it just fucking
kind of went like... It just ended.

1259
01:32:28,476 --> 01:32:30,774
Like one day it was like
they turned the TV set off

1260
01:32:30,845 --> 01:32:34,212
and, like, you kind of just, you know,
walked through another door

1261
01:32:34,282 --> 01:32:36,842
and that door was never, ever, ever
going to be opened again.

1262
01:32:36,918 --> 01:32:38,681
<i>It was incredibly radical.</i>

1263
01:32:38,753 --> 01:32:43,486
<i>It was unbelievably exciting.</i>
<i>It was right from the start, super important.</i>

1264
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:45,822
Even though no one else
in the world thought it was important,

1265
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:50,830
you sort of knew it was as important as any
other musical movement that was going on.

1266
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:55,392
And this was at a young age, you know,
that you got a grip on, that this was it.

1267
01:32:55,469 --> 01:32:57,733
You know, we didn't really think
we were going to overthrow the world.

1268
01:32:57,805 --> 01:33:00,638
It wasn't like the hippies thinking
they were going to levitate the Pentagon.

1269
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:03,302
Or we certainly didn't think that
we were going to get Reagan out of office

1270
01:33:03,377 --> 01:33:04,639
or anything like that.

1271
01:33:04,712 --> 01:33:10,514
But you know, for what we were
it was kind of a united little scene.

1272
01:33:10,885 --> 01:33:13,149
What we did was great.

1273
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:16,485
Not like I'm saying it was qualitatively great,
that we were great.

1274
01:33:16,557 --> 01:33:18,252
What it was, was great.

1275
01:33:18,326 --> 01:33:22,695
<i>What all of the bands did.</i>
<i>New York, DC, you know, Detroit,</i>

1276
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:29,593
Chicago, you know, LA obviously,
you know, San Diego, OC, all those scenes.

1277
01:33:30,237 --> 01:33:35,231
It was great and it was hard to do
but everybody accomplished a lot,

1278
01:33:35,309 --> 01:33:39,006
considering the odds
were stacked against them so heavily

1279
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:42,675
<i>in a music and political and social world.</i>

1280
01:33:43,017 --> 01:33:46,316
There wasn't any organized Left
in the United States in the '80s.

1281
01:33:46,387 --> 01:33:47,979
There was hardcore.

1282
01:33:48,055 --> 01:33:52,253
And again, you know, as limited as it was

1283
01:33:52,326 --> 01:33:55,489
it was a manifestation
of a communalist aspect,

1284
01:33:55,563 --> 01:34:00,432
of openness to humanity,
of a disdain for authority,

1285
01:34:00,534 --> 01:34:04,493
that's in the best traditions of radicalism.

1286
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:09,699
So, if you're looking for radicalism
in the 1980s, you should look at hardcore.

1287
01:34:10,344 --> 01:34:14,280
There'll be another musical revolution,
and it will be intense and energetic

1288
01:34:14,348 --> 01:34:18,648
and the kids will go nuts over it,
but it won't be hardcore.

1289
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:23,622
I think every generation has their own way
of expressing themselves,

1290
01:34:24,025 --> 01:34:27,461
and each version of punk rock,

1291
01:34:27,528 --> 01:34:31,123
whether it be, you know,
spiky green mohawks

1292
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:35,760
or, you know, berets and cigarettes

1293
01:34:35,836 --> 01:34:39,829
such as the Beats during the '50s,
or hippies in the '60s,

1294
01:34:39,907 --> 01:34:44,173
each version of this kind of expression
will continue to manifest itself,

1295
01:34:44,245 --> 01:34:47,544
probably every 15 or 20 years
with every new generation.

1296
01:34:47,615 --> 01:34:49,344
Thank God.

1297
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:52,947
It was a great, wonderful,
almost innocent time.

1298
01:34:53,087 --> 01:34:58,115
And it's such a sad reflection
what I see going on now with punk rock.

1299
01:34:58,192 --> 01:35:02,458
But that's just because I'm jealous 'cause
they're all young and having all the fun.

1300
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:04,361
I'm old and bitter. Broken.

1301
01:35:04,432 --> 01:35:07,959
We looked forward to going on the road
because at least we got hospitality

1302
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:09,559
and we got fed

1303
01:35:09,637 --> 01:35:13,505
and we got to do shows and have
a great time, but it wasn't none of this shit,

1304
01:35:13,574 --> 01:35:18,273
all these fucking, like, spoiled
little fucking brats that are on MTV

1305
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:21,937
now with their fucking buses
and all this bullshit,

1306
01:35:22,016 --> 01:35:25,179
and they're calling that shit punk.
That ain't fucking punk.

1307
01:35:25,252 --> 01:35:27,186
You know,
they're driving their fucking tour bus

1308
01:35:27,254 --> 01:35:29,154
on the highway that we paved.

1309
01:35:29,323 --> 01:35:34,351
I will actually be the first punk, or whatever,
person that says, "Punk is dead!"

1310
01:35:35,496 --> 01:35:39,296
It was over a long time ago. It's over, okay?

1311
01:35:40,668 --> 01:35:43,364
Go home. Your cage is clean.
