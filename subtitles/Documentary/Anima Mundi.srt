00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,789
- THE TRUE STORY OF SABINA SPIELREIN
CAME TO LIGHT ONLY RECENTLY... -

2
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,037
...THANKS TO THE DEDICATION
OF SCHOLARS AND RESEARCHERS... -

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,355
...WORKING IN VARIOUS
PARTS OF THE WORLD. -

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,233
- THIS FILM IS IN MEMORY
OF AN EXCEPTIONAL WOMAN... -

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,635
...AND THOSE
WHO WANTED TO DO HER JUSTICE. -

6
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,635
Richard,
I haven't run away...

7
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,435
...but I wanted to be alone
for my last meeting with Sabina.

8
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,194
There's something
I haven't told you.

9
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,198
My real name
is Marie Franquin Spielrein.

10
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,919
I was born in France, but my family
originally came from Russia.

11
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,192
My great-grandparents managed
to get out when Stalin came to power.

12
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,717
For years I've been longing
to come to Russia...

13
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,032
...to learn all I could
about Sabina Spielrein.

14
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,429
You'll undoubtedly wonder, when you
hear this message, if we're related...

15
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,074
...since we have
the same family name.

16
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,552
Maybe we are,
but that's hardly important.

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,555
I feel by now...

18
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,957
...Sabina and I
are closely related in our souls.

19
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,674
- ZURICH, 1904-

20
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,634
My head! I've left my head
in the carriage!

21
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,069
We really don't know
what to do, Professor.

22
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,435
She's been like this
for a year now...

23
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,110
...ever since her little sister,
Irina, died from pneumonia.

24
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,397
She's getting worse every day.

25
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,835
We've come
all the way from Russia.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,595
We thought if we brought her here
to you, maybe you could help us.

27
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,679
I won't do it again!
I won't, I promise!

28
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,073
I won't do it again,
please believe me...

29
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,397
...but don't keep me here,
please don't keep me here!

30
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,878
No... no... no!

31
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,911
You filthy old pig!

32
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,592
Tell your slut
to get her hands off me!

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,672
You bastards!

34
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,358
I'm not your whore!

35
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,679
(Guardian angel... )

36
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,995
(... my mother and father have gone
back to Russia and left me here... )

37
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,799
(... frightened.
I don't want to be alone.)

38
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,833
(I shall stop eating... )

39
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,669
(... that way when they come back
all they'll find will be my clothes... )

40
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,989
(... to my shoes.)

41
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,959
(I'm sorry I shan't be here
to see their faces!)

42
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,157
(To my mother, I leave the notes
of Tumbalalaika, my favourite song.)

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,798
(To my father, I leave nothing.)

44
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,990
(What can grow without rain?)

45
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,034
(What can burn for years
without end?)

46
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,710
(A stone can grow without rain... )

47
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,156
(... but only love can burn
for years without end.)

48
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,111
So much has been written
and recorded...

49
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,748
...about Sabina's treatment
in Zurich.

50
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,189
But no-one's ever bothered
to find out what happened to her...

51
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,431
...after she returned to Russia.

52
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,833
That's why
I wanted to come to Moscow...

53
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,232
...to discover some facts
about the White Nursery...

54
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,153
...the infant school
where she was last seen.

55
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,590
I've often wondered
what fascinated you about Sabina.

56
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,188
Certainly I never imagined
that we'd meet...

57
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,231
...as a result of a theft.

58
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,157
(There are rabbits...
no, hares, in my room.)

59
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,876
(They're all black and they've got
long ears like sheep!)

60
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,516
(I get into bed and they're
already there waiting for me.)

61
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,434
(As soon as they see me,
they start laughing. I yell at them:)

62
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,553
(..."I'm tired, leave me alone!
I don't want to play any more!".)

63
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,798
Good morning, Miss Spielrein.

64
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,275
I'm Dr. Jung.

65
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,073
Professor Bleuler has put me
in charge of your case.

66
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,635
No, gently.

67
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,757
Go away! Let me die!

68
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,430
Leave us.

69
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,191
- Why do you want to die?
- Because I'm wicked!

70
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,192
That's hardly reason enough.

71
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,710
Anyway, I'm here to stop you.

72
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,710
So, which of us do you think
is going to win, Miss Spielrein?

73
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,069
I'd like to try
a new treatment with you.

74
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,430
Nothing forced.
No cold showers...

75
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,875
...no shackling you to the bed.

76
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,479
It consists essentially
in letting you talk.

77
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,039
Whatever comes into your head.
You talk, I listen.

78
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,509
Shall I tell you
what they do on Mars?

79
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,950
Please.

80
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,113
What do they do on Mars?

81
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,199
They don't have babies.

82
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,116
Why not?

83
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,715
Because no-one makes love on Mars!

84
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,473
How do you know that?

85
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,068
I've been there.

86
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,072
I wish I'd been to Mars.

87
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,071
No-one ever takes any notice
when I say things like that.

88
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,075
Do you like children,
Miss Spielrein?

89
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,750
Tell me...

90
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,594
...don't be afraid.

91
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,517
You can't cure me, Doctor.

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,750
Why not?

93
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,711
Because you are well,
and I am not.

94
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,589
- So?
- So...

95
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,116
So you can't understand me.

96
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,673
Do all Russian girls
read French newspapers?

97
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,957
Excusez-moi, je n'ai pas le temps!

98
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,438
- Sorry, what?
- Leave me alone!

99
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,788
I don't care if you're Russian
or you're French.

100
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,758
What you are is a thief!

101
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,072
Does the name Sabina Spielrein
mean anything to you?

102
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,679
Give it back!

103
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,319
My name's Richard Fraser...

104
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,789
...I teach history
at Glasgow University.

105
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,394
I think your acquisition
might be quite useful to me.

106
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,357
Can I at least have a look at it?

107
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,798
- And if not, you'll report me?
- Well, it's an idea.

108
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,031
Why don't we go and have a drink
somewhere and talk about that?

109
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,476
- Do I have a choice?
- Yes, tea or coffee!

110
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,792
I'm sorry if I came on a bit strong,
but I'm a historian.

111
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,758
Anytime a document is removed
from the official archives...

112
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,513
...it's lost forever.
- Monsieur Historian...

113
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,593
...here in Russia anytime a document is
consigned to the official archives...

114
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,352
...it is lost forever!

115
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,077
Look...

116
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,234
...I'm doing research
into the former Soviet Union.

117
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,756
I think the addition of psychoanalysis
could be very interesting.

118
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,119
I have an idea...

119
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,909
You speak Russian and English, and you
obviously know your way around.

120
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,229
- I need an interpreter...
- You want a thief to work for you?

121
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,597
Well, beggars can't be choosers.

122
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,673
Anyway, you can go on with your own
research. We can pool our resources.

123
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,999
It's a nice idea...

124
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,909
...but my research grant
was not exactly generous...

125
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,276
...and I've used it up.
I go back to Paris on Saturday.

126
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,552
Right, I'm not suggesting
you work for free. I'll pay you.

127
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,510
How much?

128
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,357
Board and lodging,
and six hundred dollars a week.

129
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,594
You sing beautifully.

130
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,116
I like sculpting myself, you know.

131
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,197
But I prefer stone to clay.

132
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,478
You're very talented.
Where did you learn?

133
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,479
My uncle taught me. In Russia.

134
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,953
- Is he a sculptor?
- No, he's an alchemist.

135
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,516
- He taught me how to make paper
out of rags. - Did he just?

136
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,115
I'm rather keen on doing
experiments that are somewhat...

137
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,669
...unorthodox.

138
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,398
- What kind of experiments? - I tend
to sense things before they happen.

139
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,756
Psychic intuition, if you like.

140
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,714
I've lost my legs.

141
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,152
Do you often fall like that?

142
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,311
- Who's that woman spying on us?
- What woman?

143
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,479
There's a woman at that window.
She's staring at me.

144
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,632
That's my apartment.
I don't see anyone there.

145
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,119
So, Miss Spielrein...

146
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,190
...have you ever
fallen like that before?

147
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,594
It happened once.

148
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,636
When?

149
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,918
My cat had some kittens.

150
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,431
I said I wanted to be like her...

151
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,637
...and my father lost his temper.

152
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,155
My mother said there was nothing wrong
with me wanting to have children.

153
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,755
After all,
I was a woman, wasn't I?

154
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,439
Don't be frightened.

155
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,554
I just wanted to show you
how I would have nursed my kittens.

156
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,713
Guardian angel...

157
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,754
...my doctor is fair-haired
and handsome...

158
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,274
...even more so
when he smokes his pipe.

159
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,474
Tomorrow I shall ask him
if he is married.

160
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,637
I saw you in the garden
this morning with your new patient.

161
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,914
- What's wrong with her?
- The clinical diagnosis is hysteria...

162
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,433
...but there's more to it.

163
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,557
Why don't you speak to Freud?

164
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,837
This is the first time
you've used his method, isn't it?

165
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,190
Yeah... Yes, I'll write to him.

166
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,036
Sometimes I feel
you allow your patients...

167
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,236
...to affect you rather too deeply.

168
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,954
It's the only way I know
how to heal.

169
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,356
Perhaps she doesn't want
to grow up.

170
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,752
Wants to be a child again.

171
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,436
I suspect there's
some unresolved Oedipal complex.

172
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,395
Makes her feel so guilty
she actually wants to be punished.

173
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,473
The two of you should get along
well together then.

174
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,190
I was thinking of you and Freud.

175
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,552
I mean, he's virtually
appointed you his son and heir...

176
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,352
...and you look upon him
as a father.

177
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,872
I wonder if you'll end up
trying to kill each other.

178
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,473
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

179
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,915
Professor Fraser
booked a room for me...

180
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,917
...Marie Franquin.
- Marie Franquin...

181
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,671
Yes, Room 122.

182
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,596
I'm sorry.

183
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,629
What's going on?

184
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,396
- Did you ask for communicating
rooms? - Of course not!

185
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,231
Okay...

186
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,672
- Well, we can get you another one.
- If you want...

187
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,708
I mean, I'm not dangerous.
Anyway, we can always keep it locked.

188
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,439
Listen, while you're here...

189
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,793
...could you translate
page 138 and 139?

190
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,914
- Yes, of course. - Thanks,
and can you not smoke here...

191
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,078
...because the smelI'll come through.
- Oh yes, I'm sorry.

192
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,596
- Thanks. See you later.
- See you.

193
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,272
Chair.

194
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,317
Chair?

195
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,036
Don't think, just respond.

196
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,232
- Chair.
- Table.

197
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,796
- Soft.
- Warm.

198
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,351
Lake.

199
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,836
Water.

200
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,311
- Snow.
- Purity.

201
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,599
- Dog.
- Cat.

202
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,071
You know, you look like
a wild cat sometimes, Dr. Jung.

203
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,996
- Russia.
- Home.

204
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,475
I didn't know
this could be so much fun.

205
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,319
Just one word, please.

206
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,799
- French.
- Wife!

207
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,949
Wouldn't it be funny if your wife
ran off with a Frenchman?

208
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,635
One word.

209
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,550
Sabina.

210
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,030
Dies.

211
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,830
Father.

212
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,675
Punishment.

213
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,916
Sister.

214
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,675
Cemetery.

215
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,235
It must be so cold in there!

216
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,791
My father used to beat us
when we were naughty.

217
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,831
Go on. Father.

218
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,597
Come on, Miss Spielrein.
Make the effort.

219
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,390
- Father. - Why should I tell you
anything about myself?

220
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,672
You never tell me anything
about yourself!

221
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,671
Well...

222
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,030
...do you think it's right
to bring the dead back to life?

223
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,270
Look me in the eye, Dr. Jung!

224
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,194
- What's wrong?
- I have to go.

225
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,470
- Why?
- The Russian girl.

226
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,073
I dreamt she ran away.

227
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,394
Darling, come back to bed,
it's only a dream!

228
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,148
There she is,
sleeping peacefully!

229
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,511
Here...

230
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,117
...the translation you wanted.
- Oh, thanks.

231
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,430
Why are you so interested
in this Sabina Spielrein?

232
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,352
In German,
Spielrein means "fair play".

233
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:33,957
So?

234
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,076
History has forgotten her,
and that's not fair.

235
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,074
Yes, but why
is it so important to you?

236
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,199
I suppose, in a way...

237
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,678
...that's what I'd like to be,
a woman who plays fair.

238
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,069
We can't go on feeding you this way.

239
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,197
Your veins can't stand it.

240
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,639
- It's gone on long enough.
- Do you want them to sack me?

241
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,836
Because that's what'll happen.

242
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,431
Why should they blame you?

243
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,917
They'd see your death
as proof of my failure...

244
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,236
...the failure of my method.

245
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,594
I don't want you to suffer
because of me.

246
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,515
Well then...

247
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,034
...we should go somewhere a little
more cheerful for our session today.

248
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,557
So why don't you get dressed...

249
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,919
...and come with me?

250
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,319
- Two hot chocolates and some cake
and pastries, please. - Yes, sir.

251
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,592
The other day you complained that I
never told you anything about myself.

252
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,872
Apart from my wife,
no-one has ever seen this.

253
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,873
I keep a diary, too.

254
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,671
I take it everywhere with me.

255
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,876
The first girl...

256
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,311
...I was ever attracted to
was young, Jewish.

257
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,314
She had a long dark braid
that hung down over her shoulder.

258
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,476
- I'm Jewish too, you know.
- I know.

259
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,915
Now I feel it's fate
that my first patient should be.

260
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,788
- Do you believe in premonitions?
- I don't believe, I know.

261
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,835
I wrote my doctoral thesis
on so called "occult phenomena".

262
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,157
Do you remember the other day
in the garden I was telling you...

263
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,515
Did I ever tell you
my grandfather was a rabbi?

264
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,238
He was an expert on the cabala.

265
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,398
He foretold the exact hour
and day of his death!

266
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,636
Well, my grandfather...

267
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,077
...had a special armchair
set aside for his dead wife...

268
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,794
...and every day he spent
at least an hour...

269
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,792
...talking to her spirit!

270
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,310
Really?

271
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,355
Do you really
care about me, Doctor?

272
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,514
If I didn't,
I couldn't treat you.

273
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,350
No, I mean...

274
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,115
...do you care about me from head
to toe? - From head to toe.

275
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,032
Do you love me, Doctor?

276
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,359
All clinical cases...

277
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,319
...in one way or another,
involve an element of love.

278
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,074
Can I tell you
one of my secrets, then?

279
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,273
Sometimes, when I'm alone...

280
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,759
...I touch myself.

281
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,598
I'm terribly ashamed.

282
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,953
There's really no reason to be.
Many people do.

283
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,630
You too?

284
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,999
Certainly. Me too. Sometimes.

285
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,068
Tiring day?

286
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,359
No more than usual.

287
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,030
Were you at the hospital
all afternoon?

288
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,078
No, I had to go
and see a colleague about a case.

289
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,510
He wants my advise
on a patient of his.

290
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,035
What about your Russian girl?
How's the treatment going?

291
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,357
Much better.
She's finally started to eat.

292
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,275
It just occurred to me
that we never buy any cakes.

293
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,478
And with all the cake shops
there are in Zurich...

294
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,192
Anyway, I'm pregnant...

295
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,232
...and we never indulge!

296
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,910
Sabina!

297
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,912
Go away!
I don't want to see anyone!

298
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,754
Open it, Sabina!

299
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,552
Sabina! Open the door!

300
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,274
- What's going on?
- She's blocked the door!

301
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,190
Open it!

302
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,112
Take her to the second floor!

303
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,670
So much for the Jung method!

304
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,911
What in God's name
were you thinking of?

305
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,276
- You've destroyed months of hard
work! - She tried to kill herself!

306
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,032
- Release her.
- Professor Bleuler said...

307
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,792
I said release her!

308
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,033
Stupidity!

309
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,116
I leave for a few weeks
and we return to the dark ages!

310
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,030
Leave us!

311
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,188
- Go away, traitor!
- Sabina, listen to me.

312
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,034
I am not responsible
for what happened over here.

313
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,759
No, I did not abandon you!

314
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,194
I was called up!

315
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,115
In Switzerland we have to do
military service once a year.

316
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,229
Why did you try to kill yourself?

317
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,799
No-one here loves me.

318
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,590
From now on, I, and I alone,
will look after you.

319
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,435
Swear to me!

320
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,196
I swear.

321
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,753
Then let go of me.

322
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,595
My will.

323
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,517
When I'm dead, I want
Dr. Jung to have my head.

324
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,428
Only he is to open and dissect it.

325
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,075
I want my body to be cremated...

326
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,558
...and the ashes to be scattered beneath
an oak tree on which is written:

327
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,036
..."I too was a human being".

328
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,715
What's that?

329
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,476
My soul.

330
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,195
Your soul?

331
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,356
I've had it since I was a child.

332
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,036
Primitive men used to think
that stones had souls, too.

333
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,077
I want you to be the keeper...

334
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,509
...of my soul.

335
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,957
The keeper of your soul?

336
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,439
Silence! Silence!

337
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,598
You see what your patient
is up to, Dr. Jung?

338
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,953
Tell her to stop!

339
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,268
Miss Spielrein, please...

340
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,558
With pleasure, Dr. Jung!

341
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,235
(I'm going
to be discharged today... )

342
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,271
(... after being in hospital
for almost a year.)

343
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,832
(I've started eating regularly... )

344
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,355
(... and even having periods again.)

345
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,995
(Dr. Jung said
it would be enough if I see him... )

346
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,116
(... twice a week from now on... )

347
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,274
(... though I'd like
to see him more often.)

348
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,754
Would you like to tell me
one of your dreams?

349
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,594
We're going to get bored
always talking about mine.

350
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,029
Why don't you
tell me one of yours?

351
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,913
I'm not sure I should,
as your doctor...

352
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,558
...but, as it's you,
I'll make an exception.

353
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,594
I'll tell you a dream
I had last night.

354
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,037
There was this great big horse,
a stallion.

355
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,238
It was kicking and bucking.

356
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,271
Some men were trying
to get him under control...

357
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,271
...but he was having none of it.

358
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,317
A little foal
trotted by all peacefully.

359
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,432
He suddenly calmed down.

360
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,150
Stallion.

361
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,069
Trainer.

362
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,156
Disciplined.

363
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:01,951
Disciple.

364
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,593
- Master.
- Freud.

365
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,158
Freud frightens you...

366
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,952
...and you feel you have to behave like
a good little foal when he's around.

367
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,916
Maybe.

368
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,675
It could be that your dream was
a symptom of your dissatisfaction.

369
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,836
You see?

370
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,075
Our roles have become reversed.

371
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,752
What kind of dissatisfaction
did you have in mind?

372
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,190
Your sexual dissatisfaction.

373
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,916
Have I made you cross, Dr. Jung?

374
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,309
You see love everywhere,
don't you?

375
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,636
It's the force
that drives the world.

376
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,391
You said yourself there could be
no cure without love.

377
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,476
Remember?

378
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,310
Time's up.

379
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,993
- Forgive me. Forgive me.
- For what?

380
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,514
At times
I can't quite control myself.

381
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,234
I am glad
it happens to doctors, too.

382
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,153
Why do you think
Judith killed Holofernes?

383
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,351
Surprised to see me here?

384
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,112
Because God ordered her to...

385
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,793
...to save her people.

386
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,037
First she seduces him,
then she cuts off his head.

387
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,398
Look at her expression.

388
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,313
Does she really look like someone
who's carrying out God's orders?

389
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,599
What are you suggesting,
Miss Spielrein?

390
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,437
Look carefully, Dr. Jung.

391
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,234
Her eyes, the sensuality
of her mouth...

392
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,557
Her exposed breasts...

393
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,113
Her bejewelled hand...

394
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,919
...which holds his head.

395
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:10,717
No...

396
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,594
...Judith did not kill Holofernes
to obey God.

397
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,276
Why then?

398
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,435
She killed him
because she loved him!

399
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,670
You know...

400
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,912
...sometimes you say things
that really rather shock me.

401
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,717
Do I?

402
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,792
As an explorer
of the unconscious...

403
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,713
...I shouldn't think
anything could shock you.

404
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,954
- What's it going to be?
- A trickster.

405
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,792
A mythological figure...

406
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,434
...bringer of light and chaos.
- What happened to that...

407
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,034
...Russian girl
you were so interested in?

408
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,713
She was discharged.

409
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,313
The treatment was a great success.
Bleuler asked me...

410
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,637
...to write a paper on the case
for the International Conference.

411
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,596
- Have you seen her since?
- No.

412
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,870
Why?

413
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,429
Doctor/patient bonds are difficult
to break sometimes, aren't they?

414
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,556
What have you done to your hair?

415
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,953
It's nice, isn't it?

416
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,149
Dr. Jung!

417
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,513
I hear you've enrolled
in the Faculty of Medicine.

418
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,993
Congratulations!

419
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,873
It's all thanks to you.

420
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,550
You suggested
I should study psychiatry...

421
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,796
...so I took you at your word.

422
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,113
Please, come in.

423
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,196
Oh, this is for you.
I thought you might be interested.

424
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,789
It's my study
of a young woman's dreams.

425
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,632
I'm sorry,
it's such a mess!

426
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,796
- This place is so...
- No, it's lovely!

427
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,319
Please, sit down.

428
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,110
You see...

429
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,995
...I keep your soul
with me always.

430
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,275
Am I the young woman
with the dreams?

431
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,479
- No, it isn't a patient of mine.
- Can I offer you something?

432
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,235
No, thank you, I just came round
to say hello, and...

433
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,599
You can't leave yet!
You've only just arrived.

434
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,793
Would you like to know
what I dreamt last night?

435
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,473
Please, tell me.

436
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,949
I think...

437
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,758
...I'd prefer to show you.

438
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,229
Show me?

439
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,835
A dream?

440
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,430
You know, you...

441
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,474
- You seem so...
...different?

442
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,119
Transformed.

443
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,475
Butterfly.

444
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,716
Beautiful.

445
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,749
Nature.

446
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,596
Nurture.

447
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:44,956
Kitten.

448
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,557
Kiss.

449
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,313
In my dream it wasn't
as beautiful as this.

450
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,078
You make me feel things.

451
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,436
Things I've never felt before.

452
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,759
You have to leave.

453
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,150
I know.

454
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,192
Will we ever get to spend
a whole night together?

455
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,635
How does one get to be so brave?

456
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,112
Your love has to be
stronger than your fear.

457
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,753
Bravo professor!

458
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:53,791
Yes.

459
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,279
- Please...
- Thanks.

460
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,153
This is the White House.

461
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,237
This is the Russian
Government Building.

462
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,197
This is not the White Nursery.

463
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,068
- Excuse me...
- What is it?

464
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,279
The White Nursery,
not the White House.

465
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,318
- Ah, the White Nursery?
- Yes.

466
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,073
Never heard of it.

467
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,593
He's never heard of it.

468
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,718
Come on! Sabina Spielrein's
White Nursery!

469
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,155
The International
Solidarity School!

470
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,471
It was the first infant school
in the world to use psychoanalysis!

471
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,993
You must have a record of it!

472
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,159
Here Moscow Archives,
and not British Museum.

473
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,034
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

474
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,118
- Now what?
- I have an idea. Fuck you.

475
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,515
Bye bye!

476
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,312
So, what's your idea?

477
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,310
If you can't find things via official
channels, you do it yourself!

478
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,235
Dr. Jung...

479
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,516
...there's a Russian gentleman
asking for you.

480
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,319
- Did he give a name?
- No, he just said it's urgent.

481
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,034
- Well, send him in.
- Please...

482
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,391
I don't think
I've had the pleasure.

483
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,518
Are you sure, Dr. Jung?

484
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,074
I didn't want
anyone to recognise me.

485
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,514
Maybe you don't like me
dressed like this?

486
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,997
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

487
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,590
Dr. Jung and Miss Spielrein.

488
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:43,392
- We booked two single rooms.
- No. A double room! Remember?

489
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,316
A double room with a double bed!

490
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,439
- Of course.
- A nice big double bed, please.

491
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,955
Yes, Madame.

492
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,715
You're so cold.

493
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,599
What's the matter?

494
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,474
I'm just so happy.

495
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,236
Then why are you crying?

496
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,553
Damned happiness!

497
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,031
That's what my mother used to say
when we were small.

498
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,310
She meant to say "blessed"...

499
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,352
...but I think she was right.

500
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,718
Damned happiness!

501
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,077
I want to have your baby!

502
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,832
Here, now.
I want to conceive a child!

503
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,834
What are you saying?

504
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,110
You're mad!

505
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,519
Of course I am!

506
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,468
It was you
who first diagnosed it!

507
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,592
But then you cured me...

508
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,950
...so now I'm not mad anymore!

509
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,757
(My dear Professor Freud... )

510
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,598
(... a former patient of mine... )

511
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,832
(... who I have always treated
with the greatest respect... )

512
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,038
(... is now threatening
to destroy my entire life... )

513
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,677
(... solely because I denied myself
the pleasure of giving her a child.)

514
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,154
(She has fallen in love with me.)

515
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,558
(I have become her father,
her lover, her husband.)

516
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,514
(What can I do?)

517
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,591
(Asking her to control herself
is hopeless!)

518
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,199
I know you'll say
it's my fault, Professor.

519
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,636
But logic and reason have never had
much effect on passion, have they?

520
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,153
I am guilty! Yes...

521
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,353
...guilty of having fallen victim...

522
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,352
...to my own desire!
But as you yourself said...

523
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,559
..."Iove is as close
as one can get to psychosis".

524
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,318
Love is madness!
Love is madness!

525
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,072
So someone sent
an anonymous letter...

526
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,599
...to Sabina's parents...

527
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,519
...telling them
about her affair with Jung.

528
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,311
Yes.

529
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,148
So, who was it?

530
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,756
- Emma.
- It had to be.

531
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,351
- She wanted to save her marriage.
- How did they react?

532
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,559
Papa Spielrein
wrote Jung a letter, saying:

533
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,432
..."My daughter made a God
out of you..."

534
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,557
"...and you have behaved
like a wretched mortal".

535
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,518
What did Jung do?

536
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,079
He wrote him a nasty letter,
saying, in essence...

537
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,398
...since he had treated Sabina for
nothing, he had no right to complain.

538
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,676
Nice...

539
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,390
Okay... What did Sabina do?

540
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,434
She wrote to Freud,
asking for advice.

541
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,874
What did he say?

542
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,556
He told her to break off
their relationship immediately.

543
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,795
Freud didn't care about Sabina.

544
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,635
Jung had behaved very badly...

545
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,959
...but, at that time,
he was still Freud's pupil, so...

546
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,151
Well, he was also a man!

547
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,518
Come in! Why are you
standing there like that?

548
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,432
I came here to tell you...

549
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,390
...we have to end
our relationship.

550
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,949
Sabina, be reasonable.

551
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,835
- My wife...
- Emma doesn't want to lose you!

552
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,508
For the good of all of us,
I beg you.

553
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,794
Please, try to repress
your emotions.

554
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,472
Please, try to understand.

555
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,155
- We can't have a scandal!
- You should try to understand!

556
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,198
You're rejecting
the best part of yourself!

557
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,595
Our love's the most beautiful
thing in the world.

558
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,035
You love me because I saved you.

559
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,034
- Now I need you to help me.
- Help you?

560
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,309
This passion...

561
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,832
It will destroy me!

562
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,113
- It will destroy both of us!
- But isn't that glorious?

563
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,272
No, no! No, it's not!

564
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,438
- Please, listen to me...
- I am listening.

565
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,269
We can still see each other.
Maybe you can come to my house...

566
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,154
...and become friends with Emma.
- What?

567
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,597
That's despicable!

568
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,758
Sometimes one must be
in order to survive!

569
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,077
Before I met you
I had my work, my family...

570
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,038
They didn't frighten me.

571
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,757
Now I'm ill, Sabina.

572
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,475
Give me some of the laugh,
the patience that I gave to you.

573
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,276
Don't punish me with your love!

574
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,717
You can't leave me!

575
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,076
You can't leave me!

576
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,431
What are we waiting for?

577
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,991
Something
that should interest you.

578
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,354
God, I hope they come.

579
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,557
Who?

580
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,555
You wait here.
I'll be right back.

581
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,192
So that's what historians do.

582
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,112
They run after receptionists!

583
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,356
Yeah.

584
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,070
What is it?

585
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,757
It's the names of all the children
who were in the White Nursery.

586
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,071
Listed by the OGPU
and inherited by the KGB.

587
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,438
It's a present for you!

588
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,710
Merci.

589
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,274
Merci beaucoup!

590
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,596
Come on.

591
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,791
The girl from the hotel...
her father was a KGB officer.

592
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,871
They're always
a good source of information...

593
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,712
...especially
if you're willing to pay.

594
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,359
Would you please tell Mrs. Jung...

595
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,476
...that Miss Spielrein
is here to see her?

596
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,193
- Come in, please.
- Thank you.

597
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,472
Repress my feelings...

598
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,435
...and become friendly
with his wife.

599
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:41,471
Repress my feelings
and become friendly with his wife.

600
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,799
What do you want?

601
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,316
I want him to love me still.

602
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,435
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

603
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,833
- Ivan Ionov?
- Yes.

604
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,876
My name's Marie Franquin.

605
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,635
This is Professor Richard Fraser,
from Glasgow University.

606
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,912
You knew Sabina Spielrein
in the White Nursery...

607
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:41,950
...didn't you?

608
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:43,751
Yes.

609
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,515
Come in, please.

610
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,716
What?

611
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,955
I should stop
pursuing you, Dr. Jung?

612
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,149
Just because
you're afraid of love?

613
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,273
How do you do?
I'm Dr. Jung's mistress.

614
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,038
We haven't met before,
I'm Dr. Jung's mistress.

615
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,830
I'm so glad you could come!
I'm Dr. Jung's mistress.

616
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,156
Hello, Dr. Jung's mistress.

617
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,558
I'm sleeping with doctor Jung,
I'm his mistress.

618
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:59,351
My name is Sabina Spielrein,
I'm Dr. Jung's mistress.

619
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,799
I came here
in order to humiliate you.

620
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,790
But now that I'm here,
all I want to do is reassure you...

621
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,714
...tell you
that I shall always love you...

622
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,756
...and that I wanted to die,
but now I am alive.

623
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,037
And that's your doing.
I shall never forget it!

624
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,309
Pardon me, I believe you've
mistaken me for someone else.

625
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,593
I must leave now.

626
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,189
And, really, don't worry,
I shall never bother you again.

627
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,359
I should like your wife to know...

628
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,193
...that I hold
absolutely nothing against her.

629
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,715
I'm sure
she's a wonderful person.

630
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,592
She must be, if you chose her.

631
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,719
Tell her that I wish her
every happiness.

632
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,197
As I do for you, too.

633
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,874
Miss Spielrein!

634
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,954
In the 1920s, Sabina Spielrein...

635
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,754
...qualified as a doctor
in Switzerland.

636
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,876
While Lenin was still alive...

637
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,709
...she had returned to Moscow with...

638
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:16,673
...her husband, Pawel Schaftel,
who was also a doctor...

639
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,997
...and their daughter, Renate.

640
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,317
Dr. Spielrein was very keen...

641
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,319
...to make a contribution to the great
dream of the Russian Revolution.

642
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:41,315
Moscow at that time was a city
electric with passion...

643
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:44,756
...with new ideas. People
took to the streets every day...

644
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,753
...to demonstrate
their desire for change.

645
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,991
What were they looking for?

646
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:53,391
"Heaven on Earth",
as Sabina used to say.

647
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:57,036
And she was the first
to believe it could be attained.

648
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,392
How beautiful Moscow is!

649
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,435
How it's changed!

650
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:20,753
Do re mi fa sol la si do...

651
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,552
After qualifying, Sabina
had specialized in psychotherapy.

652
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,755
And, as soon as she was settled
in Moscow, she started running...

653
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:35,635
...an infant school,
known as "The White Nursery".

654
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,919
It was called that because all the
furniture in it was painted white.

655
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,914
From the very beginning,
Dr. Spielrein...

656
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:50,715
...put all her theories about
infant education into practice...

657
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,474
...and they were very advanced
for those days!

658
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,673
Her cardinal rule
was to give the children...

659
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,075
...the maximum amount of freedom...

660
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:04,279
...and the curriculum consisted
largely of encouraging creativity...

661
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:08,951
...teaching music and exploring
the mysteries of the human body.

662
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,718
One of the pupils
was tremendously violent.

663
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,713
He was always
hitting the other children.

664
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,754
He'd been enrolled
under a false name.

665
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:31,838
Only years later did we find out
he was Stalin's son.

666
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:38,158
Not even Sabina had known
who he really was.

667
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,674
Is that the one who became
a general in the Red Army...

668
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,512
...and went on
to become an alcoholic?

669
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:48,997
Yes.

670
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:51,989
Poor Vasily...

671
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,510
...another of his father's victims.

672
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:00,670
Excuse me.

673
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,429
Pawel Schaftel and Sabina...

674
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,990
...got together a few years after
her break with Jung.

675
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,272
So much for eternal love!

676
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,552
She wanted to live with love,
not die of it!

677
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,431
But she never forgot Jung.

678
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,555
(Dear friend... )

679
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,634
(... when I left Russia
there was a Czar.)

680
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:31,593
(I've come back
to find a Revolution.)

681
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,756
(Lenin's going to have
his work cut out... )

682
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,070
(... transforming
this almost illiterate country... )

683
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,991
(... into a modern democracy!)

684
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,078
(But everyone seems
to be rolling up their sleeves... )

685
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,635
(... and I shall try
to do my bit too.)

686
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,038
(I think it's the first time... )

687
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:51,193
(... a psychoanalyst has ever been
put in charge of a nursery school.)

688
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,634
(What I'd like to prove... )

689
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,632
(... is that if you teach a child
freedom from the beginning... )

690
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,308
(... he will grow up
to be truly free.)

691
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,877
(It's asking a lot, I know,
and it won't be easy.)

692
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,754
(But I feel passionately about it.)

693
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:11,114
(A few nights ago,
I dreamt I was a horse... )

694
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,709
(... galloping
across an endless plain.)

695
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,596
(Perhaps that's what my life is:)

696
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,792
(... an endless plain.)

697
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:24,350
(It's getting late,
and I can't keep my eyes open.)

698
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:31,997
(Best wishes.
The keeper of your soul.)

699
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,952
Sabina Spielrein
was truly extraordinary.

700
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,794
She always had time for those
children with particular problems.

701
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,398
There was a little boy there...

702
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,750
...who would sit
under a table all day...

703
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,598
...with his eyes closed.

704
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,679
His hands were clasped so tight...

705
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:06,197
...it was as if his fingers
were glued together.

706
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,874
Every morning,
Sabina would think up some way...

707
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,594
...of coaxing him
out of his isolation.

708
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:33,671
She refused to give up,
but however hard she tried...

709
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,398
...it was impossible
to get those hands apart.

710
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,792
Then, one day Sabina
had a brainwave.

711
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,268
That little boy...

712
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:45,270
...was me.

713
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,753
I felt as if my hands were melting.

714
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,393
For the first time in my life,
I smiled.

715
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:52,037
I shall never forget
what Dr. Spielrein did for me.

716
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,398
Inside the White Nursery
we were all happy.

717
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,754
But outside,
after Lenin's death...

718
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,710
...the country started
to fall apart.

719
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,918
(My dear friend... )

720
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:27,028
(... I should be happy today because
it is my daughter's birthday... )

721
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,757
(... and because my book of essays
is being published.)

722
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,874
(But I hardly
feel like celebrating.)

723
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:37,359
(Our great poet Majakovskij
is dead.)

724
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,839
(Accident or assassination?)

725
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:45,038
(On the radio Stalin said
he committed suicide... )

726
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,953
(... and now this is
the official version.)

727
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,750
(Will we ever know the truth?)

728
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:56,510
(With every day that passes, the
darkness grows more overwhelming.)

729
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,270
(It creeps
into one's innermost being... )

730
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,596
(... and sows seeds of terror.)

731
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,516
(Last month
my parents were arrested... )

732
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,915
(... without ever being told why.)

733
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,668
(The truth is... )

734
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,389
(The truth is
that no-one dares say loud... )

735
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,632
(... that we are ruled
by man who is mentally ill.)

736
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,988
(Do you remember
that phrase of Arthur Schnitzler... )

737
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,274
(... the Austrian writer?)

738
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,155
("God created him to be a hero...")

739
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,597
("...but the course of events
turned him into a fool.")

740
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:34,109
(Poor God! Stalin is mad!)

741
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:38,593
(He was certified by his own doctor,
a colleague of my husband's... )

742
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:42,196
(... who died shortly after
having eaten a cake... )

743
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,869
(... in the cafeteria
at the Bolshoi.)

744
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:10,677
Comrade Spielrein,
this is yours I believe.

745
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,470
Sign here to say you disown it!

746
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:19,591
Why?

747
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:22,679
You published it without party
permission, and the party...

748
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:26,673
...does not like what you've written.
- What is it the party objects to?

749
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,518
Your theories
on freedom of thought...

750
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,318
...and sexual liberation
for children...

751
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:34,399
...are provocative and contrary
to Marxist Leninist principles!

752
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,752
Not to mention
what you've written about the car!

753
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,117
The car is the symbol
of capitalist decadence.

754
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,715
But even Majakovskij had a car.

755
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,956
If I had been Majakovskij...

756
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,390
...I would have been
much more careful...

757
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,830
...about having an accident!

758
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:03,435
I advise you
to do as you're told!

759
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:24,753
"Even if you kill me, even if
you bury me, I shall rise again."

760
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,710
Majakovskij, comrade Zorin.

761
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:29,668
Get on with it!

762
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,356
It hasn't all been forgotten.

763
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,191
You're the living proof.

764
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,952
Pasternak's poems.
I'm going to buy it for you.

765
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:36,073
It's very nice,
but I can't read them.

766
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,313
Because historians
don't read love poetry?

767
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:43,755
- No, because they're in Russian.
- I could read them to you...

768
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,269
...if you like.

769
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:00,310
Well...

770
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,838
I'm gonna go for a walk.

771
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,599
It helps me sleep.

772
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,351
I'll see you in the morning then.

773
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,831
Take care. Moscow can be
very dangerous at night.

774
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,118
You've never been to Glasgow!

775
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,115
- Bye.
- See you.

776
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:29,753
(Guardian angel... )

777
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:33,909
(... now psychoanalysis too
has been officially banned.)

778
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:38,149
(It's forbidden to treat patients,
write about the subject... )

779
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,391
(... even talk about it.)

780
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:46,590
(I've persuaded my husband to go back
to Switzerland to cure his chest.)

781
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:51,512
(Today my daughter and I are leaving
for Rostov, where I was born.)

782
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,832
(I hope to open
a clandestine nursery there.)

783
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,111
(There is no news on the radio... )

784
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:02,676
(... but everyone says that
the Germans have invaded Russia... )

785
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,269
(... and the Red Army
is retreating.)

786
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:10,354
(Please God that the Nazis
won't get as far as Rostov.)

787
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:14,516
(We Jews will be the first
to suffer if they do.)

788
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:18,312
(Nonetheless,
I have faith in the future.)

789
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,755
(I'm still the usual dreamer.)

790
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:26,238
(If I don't keep dreaming,
what sense would my life have?)

791
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,156
Marie!

792
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,396
Marie!

793
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:14,437
Richard, I looked in on you
before I left.

794
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:18,472
How strange,
we know everything about Sabina...

795
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,870
...but so little about each other.

796
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,629
There's a poem
by Pasternak that says:

797
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,876
..."When you can't see
into someone's soul..."

798
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,037
"...try going away
and then come back."

799
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,758
I haven't run away...

800
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:36,108
...but I wanted to be alone
for my last meeting with Sabina.

801
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,071
Renate!

802
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,434
My name was Sabina Spielrein.

803
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:34,115
When I am dead,
I want Dr. Jung to have my head.

804
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,479
Only he is to open
and dissect it.

805
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,756
I want my body to be cremated...

806
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,833
...and the ashes to be scattered
beneath an oak tree...

807
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:48,670
...on which is written:
"I too was a human being."

808
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,198
- SABINA SPIELREIN
AND HER DAUGHTER... -

809
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:20,835
...WERE MURDERED BY THE NAZIS
IN 1942 IN ROSTOV. -

810
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:25,317
- ONLY RECENTLY HAS THE VALUE
OF HER WORK BEEN RECOGNIZED... -

811
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:29,672
...AND ITS INFLUENCE ON BOTH
JUNG AND FREUD ACKNOWLEDGED. -

812
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,553
- IVAN IONOV
IS THE LAST SURVIVOR... -

813
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:35,752
...OF THE CHILDREN
IN THE WHITE NURSERY. -

814
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:38,075
- HE IS NOW 84 YEARS OLD... -

815
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:42,512
...AND ALWAYS KEEPS A PHOTOGRAPH
OF SABINA BY HIS BEDSIDE. -
