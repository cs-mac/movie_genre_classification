20
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,480
I told Zheng Hao, the parent-child identification test

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,030
is only to recognizing the mother and son relations, not for the lawsuit.

22
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,240
Not for the lawsuit?

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,090
Are you being innocent or are you pretending to be an idiot?

24
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,500
Xue Han Zhi has already handed this thing to the court. You're saying it's not for the lawsuit?

25
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,330
You have always told me,

26
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,570
that my child is gone, it was a stillborn. But he is here.

27
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:49,280
He is still alive. Zheng Hao is my son.

28
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,830
What? I can't acknowledge my own son?

29
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,840
Did I say you can't acknowledge your son? I said it before, I'll repeat it.

30
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,790
The problem is not the son, it's the agreement!

31
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,970
Fine, then as long as you promise you won't harm my son,

32
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,490
I can still follow your words for everything.

33
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,110
Then leave the country immediately. Go to England, France,

34
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,170
America, anywhere is fine. Choose somewhere.

35
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,550
Without a call from me, you're not allowed to come back.

36
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,930
Then what about the case of Zheng Hao suing me?

37
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,590
No way. I must still attend court.

38
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,420
I must confirm me and Zheng Hao's mother and son relationship in court.

39
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,080
Fine. You can attend court.

40
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,880
But you must listen to me.

41
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,680
Defendant Xia Yun, please take a seat on the Defendant's seat.

42
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,620
I have said, the Judge will tell her to sit on the Defendant's seat with me.

43
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,310
Your Honor.

44
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,610
May I ask the Defendant, the thirteenth piece of evidence from the Defendant,

45
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,580
have you seen the identification report affirming your mother and son relations with Zheng Hao?

46
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,320
I have seen it.

47
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,830
Then you are certain Zheng Hao is the biological son of you and Tang Ji Ye, right?

48
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,950
That's right.

49
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,830
Then, do you agree, according to the will written when Tang Ji Ye was alive,

50
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,720
that Zheng Hao should inherit all of Tang Ye Corporation's property and wealth?

51
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,960
This question is a bit complicated.

52
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,840
I need to think over it.

53
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,870
Complicated?

54
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,210
If Zheng Hao is your biological son, then obviously,

55
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,650
he should inherit all of Tang Ji Ye's inheritance.

56
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,720
Could it be that, you're doubtful of Tang Ji Ye's will?

57
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,190
Did our Attorney Zhong,

58
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,830
sitting next to you, makes you feel pressured?

59
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:19,140
Your Honor, I object the Plaintiff's Attorney asking suggestible questions.

60
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,290
In truth, I have no said a word.

61
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,780
Your Honor, it is true he did not say a word,

62
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,070
but any one of his gaze or hand gesture

63
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,370
could influence Miss Xia Yun.

64
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,340
What can be done about that?

65
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,870
Should I sit in the audience rows?

66
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,620
No need for that.

67
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:46,220
Your Honor, I advise to have Miss Xia Yun sit on the witness seat.

68
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,550
That way, her nervousness could at least be reduced.

69
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,240
I think that is possible.

70
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:17,500
Miss Xia Yun, did you go to get this parent-child identification report on the screen with Zheng Hao?

71
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,640
No. I gave my hair to Zheng Hao so that he could send it to be tested.

72
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,190
Then do you think this identification report is real?

73
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,980
Is Zheng Hao your biological son?

74
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,860
It's real, he is my son.

75
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:38,040
Do you agree to, according to your husband's will, let Zheng Hao inherit all of his property and wealth?

76
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,400
Your Honor, I'm sorry. Let us repeal this question for now.

77
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,890
Today, it was definitely not because Xia Yun was nervous.

78
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,220
She must have some kind of other reason.

79
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,010
Because of Zhong Ke Ming.

80
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,410
This has further proven my previous guesses.

81
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,270
Do you know why I stopped your question back then?

82
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,540
You're afraid that Xia Yun's reply might be disadvantageous to our party.

83
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,320
Not only just that, I suddenly realised we have a rift.

84
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,720
Also, we have disregarded a very important point.

85
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,860
What is it?

86
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,670
Look, since Xia Yun has already admitted that Zheng Hao is her son,

87
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:36,310
she didn't challenge the will either. According to common sense,

88
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:41,060
it could be said that this case...has already been won.

89
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:46,000
But, why is there no reconciliation and we must continue to fight?

90
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,150
Oh, I understand.

91
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,730
Xia Yun is actually not being self-contradictory.

92
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,740
Her position is clear. Although she has acknowledged Zheng Hao as her son,

93
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,640
she doesn't agree to let Zheng Hao inherit Tang Ye's property and wealth.

94
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,230
I have been too careless. I thought that once she acknowledged her son,

95
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,670
I thought she would definitely agree to let her son inherit the wealth and property.

96
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,950
This is what's difficult about being a lawyer, questioning needs to stop at a reasonable stage.

97
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,830
Asking too much may actually bring problems.

98
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,950
I'm glad you were able to stop me in time.

99
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,490
Otherwise, if her response was disadvantageous to us, I would have acted extra.

100
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,000
This Zhong Ke Ming is not easy to go against.

101
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,150
When the questioning resumes in the afternoon, he will definitely attack this point primarily.

102
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:48,600
The opposition will also become more difficult. I actually would like to see what ploys he will use

103
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,680
to prove that you can't inherit Tang Ye's wealth and property.

104
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:58,000
I think, they only have one ploy now.

105
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:06,660
Xia Yun, your response just now has made Attorney Xue really confused,

106
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,850
it has also made me very befuddled.

107
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,040
To let the court understand this case's truth better,

108
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,620
I would like to ask you a few questions again.

109
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,560
You only need to answer yes or no.

110
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,900
First question, you have been avoiding Zheng Hao recently,

111
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:33,730
it was because you didn't want to do the parent-child identification test with him. Yes or no?

112
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,150
Yes. But there is a reason for this.

113
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,950
You don't need to explain. You only need to reply yes.

114
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,530
At the end of last month, Zheng Hao found you. He asked you,

115
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,720
he told you that, he really hopes

116
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,990
to recognize this mother and son relationship again so you agreed with him

117
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,080
to do the parent-child identification test. But you proposed a condition,

118
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,220
it was that the parent-child identification report

119
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,930
can only be used to recognize the mother and son relationship,

120
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,950
it can't be used in the lawsuit. Is that right?

121
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,520
Yes.

122
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,930
After the parent-child identification report was released, Zheng Hao said to you again,

123
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,550
he hopes that you could attend court.

124
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,560
He said, because, to establish the mother and son relationship,

125
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,940
a confirmation letter must be received from the court. Is that right?

126
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,620
Yes.

127
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,790
Then can I generalize like this,

128
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,240
you were willing to do this parent-child identification test,

129
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,100
as well as willing to attend court as witness for Zheng Hao,

130
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,200
the only intention was to establish your mother and son relationship

131
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,050
and not to have Zheng Hao, according to the will,

132
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:43,230
to inherit Tang Ji Ye's wealth and property. Is that right?

133
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,030
Your Honor, my party opposes to this question.

134
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,710
Please state your reason.

135
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,410
Because we have already repealed this question previously.

136
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,370
Yes, Attorney Xue, you did repeal it.

137
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,420
But I am still interested to know.

138
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,210
I hope to hear Xia Yun's answer.

139
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,320
Yes. I have told Zheng Hao before.

140
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,690
Your Honor, my party still opposes to this question.

141
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,400
If Zheng Hao could be proven to be Xia Yun and Tang Ji Ye's child,

142
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,870
then no matter if Xia Yun is willing to or not,

143
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,290
it still would not affect Zheng Hao's rights to inherit the inheritance.

144
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,890
Attorney Xue is very correct. But don't forget, the word you said just now was "if"...

145
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,990
What does "if" mean?

146
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,480
That's right.

147
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,520
What does "if" mean?

148
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,740
"If" means that, you don't have sufficient evidence to prove,

149
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,240
that Zheng Hao is Tang Ji Ye's son.

150
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,260
Does Attorney Zhong believe that,

151
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,100
with just a parent-child identification report, it can't entirely prove that

152
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,840
Zheng Hao is Tang Ji Ye's inheritor?

153
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,470
That was what I meant.

154
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,670
Why can't it prove that?

155
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,120
You can't just give a conclusion and not a reason, right?

156
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,170
I have three reasons. One, it is that

157
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:11,340
this privately commissioned parent-child identification report has no legal effect.

158
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,830
It can definitely not be used in court to prove any truths.

159
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:19,840
Your Honor, Attorney Zhong is currently challenging this evidence's form.

160
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,600
We can entrust the court to have Zheng Hao and Xia Yun

161
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,790
do a legally commissioned identification test again.

162
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,260
These are words to save yourself, I have already said it.

163
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,890
These are latter words. The court can't use

164
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,620
evidence from tomorrow to prove today's truth.

165
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:45,350
Attorney Zhong, please continue. What are you remaining reasons?

166
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,920
Then please don't let Attorney Xue interrupt me.

167
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,230
Because the following two questions I'm about to ask,

168
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,900
Xia Yun will use the following two reasons

169
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,070
to reveal to the court clearly.

170
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,950
<i>Is this the only solution?</i>

171
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,960
<i>This is the only solution.</i>

172
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,010
<i>How should I live in the future?</i>

173
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,290
<i>Isn't this too cruel?</i>

174
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,850
<i>This is the only way for you to recognize your son</i>

175
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,900
<i>and not break our contract at the same time.</i>

176
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:39,040
<i>But this kind of thing...how do you want me to say something like this?</i>

177
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,420
<i>You don't need to say it. I'll ask you.</i>

178
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,700
<i>Your answer only needs to be "yes" or "no".</i>

179
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,750
Xia Yun, you told Attorney Xue just now,

180
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,400
you said you didn't personally go to the DNA testing centre,

181
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,630
you only gave a few hairs to Zheng Hao to do the test.

182
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,220
Is that right?

183
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,320
Yes.

184
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,300
Then that means, this identification report

185
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,300
does not only have problems with its process...

186
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,320
Your Honor, my party objects.

187
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,390
We object Attorney Zhong casually vilifying my litigant.

188
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,200
I am only letting the court know about a possibility.

189
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,470
You can deny that these hairs

190
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,580
didn't get contaminated in the process.

191
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,770
I think nothing in this could be fake.

192
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,680
I can guarantee that Zheng Hao is my son.

193
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,670
Sure. Since that is what you've said,

194
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,400
I'll put this question aside. I will ask you the second question.

195
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,320
You told Attorney Xue just now, you said Zheng Hao is

196
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,880
yours and Tang Ji Ye's son.

197
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:57,010
But actually, you can't confirm that, right?

198
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,480
Don't laugh, everyone. Why has

199
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,650
parent-child identification test become so popular recently?

200
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:20,320
It is because that a lot of children's fathers

201
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,100
are worth being suspicious of.

202
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,300
Silence! Quiet, everyone!

203
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,680
Attorney Zhong, can you change how you ask your questions?

204
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,150
Sure.

205
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,990
Xia Yun, let me ask you,

206
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,760
apart from giving a few hairs to Zheng Hao for testing,

207
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,290
did you give Tang Ji Ye's hair

208
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,900
or something like teeth to him?

209
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,750
No.

210
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,320
My husband has already died over ten years.

211
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,170
He has been cremated long ago. He didn't leave anything behind.

212
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:07,570
Then that means, you can confirm that Zheng Hao is your son,

213
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:13,270
but you can't confirm that he is Tang Ji Ye's son. Is that right?

214
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,840
Your Honor.

215
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,640
Even if Zheng Hao doesn't have any parent and child relations with Tang Ji Ye,

216
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,490
but Xia Yun is Tang Ji Ye's wife.

217
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,080
Zheng Hao and Xia Yun have familial relations,

218
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,360
so, Zheng Hao can be presumed as Tang Ji Ye's son.

219
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,620
This child was born from the mother's body.

220
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,080
The mother and child's relations can be determined

221
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,950
but the father and son or father and daughter relationships

222
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:48,110
must depend on presumptions. There are two prerequisites for presumptions. One,

223
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,930
the father must have the ability to reproduce.

224
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:57,400
Two, the mother may only have had one sexual partner,

225
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,490
who is the child's father.

226
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,530
Xia Yun, let me continue asking you,

227
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,370
when you got married with Tang Ji Ye, he was already sick.

228
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,190
Even if he was still not a vegetative person,

229
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:20,100
but did he have any sexual abilities or has he lived as husband and wife with you?

230
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,170
If not, how did you become pregnant with Zheng Hao?

231
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,690
Tang Ji Ye could.

232
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,450
I got pregnant with the child before I got married.

233
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,040
You were pregnant with him before you got married.

234
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,910
That means, you were pregnant first before getting married.

235
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,860
Then let me ask you, before you got married, did have a boyfriend?

236
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,610
You did. His name is Gao Huai Yi.

237
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,890
Is that right?

238
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:11,600
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by the Gone With The Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

239
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,260
Please say it. You need to say it loudly.

240
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,870
Because the court needs to record this in the case.

241
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,930
That's right, I had a boyfriend.

242
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,490
You boyfriend, you really love him.

243
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,950
Also, you two already had

244
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,940
that kind of intimate relationship. Is that right?

245
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,500
Yes.

246
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:55,320
So, when Tang Ji Ye chased after you,

247
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,030
you struggled between two people. During those few months,

248
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:05,110
you circulated between these two men. You liked Gao Huai Yi,

249
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,230
because you were looking for love.

250
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,580
But,

251
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,280
Tang Ji Ye could give you wealthiness.

252
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:19,800
Between love and wealthiness, you chose wealth.

253
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,220
But you couldn't forget Gao Huai Yi. In the end,

254
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,440
you even nearly sacrificed for him. Is that right?

255
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,290
Why did you have to mention him?

256
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,240
Didn't we agree we won't bring this up again?

257
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,780
Fine.

258
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,120
I won't mention this. I won't mention it.

259
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:46,920
But listen carefully, seriously answer my last two questions.

260
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,090
Therefore, before you got married,

261
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,290
you had two sexual partners in reality.

262
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,020
During that time, you became pregnant.

263
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,880
Nobody could not, including even yourself,

264
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,450
determine whether Zheng Hao's father is Gao Huai Yi

265
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,530
or Tang Ji Ye. Is that right?!

266
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,130
Yes!

267
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:17,120
Your Honor, my party opposes.

268
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,810
I have no more questions.

269
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,610
What the opposition's Attorney just said was not the truth.

270
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,900
With what basis could you say it wasn't the truth?

271
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,010
Even if it was the truth, you still can't ignore

272
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,390
the possibility that Zheng Hao is Tang Ji Ye's child.

273
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,340
I didn't ignore it.

274
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,400
But you also can't ignore that his father could be Gao Huai Yi.

275
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,280
If Zheng Hao wants to inherit Tang Ji Ye's inheritance,

276
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,020
he must prove their parent and child relationship 100%.

277
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,290
But he can't possibly do that anymore.

278
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,530
You can do that forever!

279
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,160
This case... We obviously held a strong card.

280
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,180
How did a Gao Huai Yi suddenly appear?

281
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,190
This is really just falling short of success at the last stage.

282
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,450
Who knew Zhong Ke Ming had this up his sleeve?

283
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,900
There's no use in regretting. Hurry and think of a strategy.

284
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,890
We're losing this case so badly. It's even the lead story in the newspaper.

285
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:01,880
It's all because we listened to your wise council.

286
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,360
You said the maternity test wouldn't get overruled, but then

287
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,410
we were utterly defeated by Zhong Ke Ming.

288
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,860
How could I know you guys would be dragged by Zhong Ke Ming?

289
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,240
Going where he wants you to go.

290
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,310
Wow, you're so sharp. How come you didn't even come to the trial?

291
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:21,310
You think I don't want to come? I really want to come. But these few days

292
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,180
I've been studying for the TOEFL to go to an American law school.

293
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,890
I'm not the Monkey King. I can't go to many things at once.

294
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,860
Oh, right.

295
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,390
It seems that Lu Zhi Qiang is trying to find our court.

296
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,800
He wants to investigate a case file.

297
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,750
Is it the Yu Fen Li relocation case?

298
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,120
Yes.

299
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,820
Why does he want to research this case?

300
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,970
I don't know. But I heard the presiding judge say that Lu Zhi Qiang was

301
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,050
the main judge for the Yu Fen Li relocation case.

302
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,320
Lu Zhi Qiang?

303
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,940
The administrator in the hospital's archives?

304
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,460
That's him.

305
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,950
What's wrong?

306
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,800
Wasn't the hearing yesterday very fulfilling?

307
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,820
Mother and son acknowledged each other. The law also did.

308
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,630
The problem is completely solved.

309
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,340
Yeah.

310
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,830
Everything was very fulfilling. The agreement between us

311
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,260
was able to be completed without any hindrances.

312
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,310
You'll soon be able to get what you have dreamed of,

313
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,870
full control of Tang Ye Corporation.

314
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,320
But have you thought about me?

315
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,150
Right now, gossip is all over the internet and newspapers.

316
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:04,840
I've become a bad woman who doesn't abide by female virtues.

317
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,300
How am I supposed to leave the house?

318
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,640
If you can't leave the house, leave the country. Isn't that the lifestyle you like?

319
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,470
Go out of the country. No one will care

320
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,740
or gossip about your affairs.

321
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:25,390
Zhong Ke Ming, I don't think this is fair.

322
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,130
It's especially unfair to my son.

323
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:31,710
A lot of things in life are unfair.

324
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,640
What do you want?

325
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,560
I want...

326
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,990
I want you to tell me Gao Huai Yi's new address in Hong Kong.

327
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:46,260
It's been about a year. Ever since Xiao Ning started her case,

328
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,480
Gao Huai Yi suddenly disappeared. I couldn't find him at all.

329
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,060
I asked you. You even said you didn't know.

330
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:59,180
But how do you not know?

331
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,530
Did you force him to leave?

332
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,730
You still don't want to give up your evil ways.

333
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,160
Why do you want to find him?

334
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,030
I want Zheng Hao and him to do a paternity test.

335
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,520
You want to use Gao Huai Yi and Zheng Hao's false

336
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,780
paternity test report

337
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,240
to reversely prove that Zheng Hao is Tang Ji Ye's son.

338
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,270
You're delusional!

339
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:49,390
No, that... Don't worry. Zheng Hao and I won't fight with you.

340
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:54,950
Tell me the address. Please.

341
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:11,690
Zhou Tong, you just said that we've been dragged around by Zhong Ke Ming.

342
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,250
Then do you have any suggestions that could reverse the situation?

343
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:21,340
Yesterday in court, Zhong Ke Ming

344
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,590
gave an irreversible reality.

345
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:30,140
It's that Tang Ji Ye is dead. You can't find him to do a paternity test.

346
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,370
At the same time, Gao Huai Yi appeared.

347
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:37,860
He used Gao Huai Yi to crush your last defense.

348
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,360
But I think this situation

349
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,560
might be a blessing in disguise.

350
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,630
If Gao Huai Yi is still living,

351
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:51,960
you can find him to do a paternity test to verify

352
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,610
that you have no blood relation to him.

353
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:59,060
If it's like that, the process of elimination

354
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,920
leaves only one person who can be your real father.

355
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,050
That would be Tang Ji Ye.

356
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:15,260
So, quickly call Xia Yun. Find Gao Huai Yi.

357
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:30,770
Can I still believe you? Can I still believe Zheng Hao?

358
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,570
Right now I can't trust anyone!

359
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,280
You guys have all betrayed me!

360
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,470
Let me tell you,

361
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,070
you'll never see Gao Huai Yi again.

362
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:59,120
It's impossible for him to do a paternity test with Zheng Hao.

363
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,780
Why?

364
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,070
He's dead.

365
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,090
He died in Hong Kong.

366
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,580
What?

367
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:21,280
H-he... He's dead?

368
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,820
Yes.

369
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,680
How did he die? Why didn't you tell me?

370
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:38,260
Tell you? Am I obligated to tell you?

371
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,890
Should I tell you so you can offer your condolences?

372
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:46,150
He has a wife and kids. Do you want to be thrown out by them?

373
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:54,030
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by the Gone With The Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

374
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,250
You're so malicious!

375
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:02,660
You knew he died and you didn't tell me! Why?

376
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,320
I know your goal.

377
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,480
You're afraid that if I knew Gao Huai Yi was dead, I would have nothing to fear!

378
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,950
I wouldn't keep being manipulated by you! I wouldn't keep accepting your threats! Right?

379
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:32,620
Are you sick? Are you?

380
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,910
Did I threaten you?

381
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,480
Did I manipulate you?

382
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,630
I used Gao Huai Yi to control you?

383
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,860
Do you have a problem?

384
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,820
Let me tell you,

385
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:57,230
you want to win this case with them? Impossible.

386
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,800
No one can take anything

387
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,390
from my grasp!

388
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:14,990
You can't find evidence. You can no longer

389
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,580
prove which one is Tang Ji Ye's son!

390
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,560
I've won.

391
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,250
I've won!

392
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,030
No one can fight with me!

393
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:40,040
No one can fight with me! Do you understand?

394
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,670
I've won! Do you understand?

395
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,970
Money... I can give it to you.

396
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,830
I can allow you to live a rich life,

397
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:14,180
but your son Zheng Hao cannot

398
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:18,130
take Tang Ye away from me!

399
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,100
No one can!

400
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,030
Not one person can!

401
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,480
Oh.

402
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,840
How is it?

403
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:34,540
Zhong Ke Ming told Xia Yun that Gao Huai Yi is already dead.

404
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,440
Dead?

405
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,520
He died half a year ago.

406
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,480
Don't worry. Don't worry.

407
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,750
If this is a dead end, then let's turn back and go another direction.

408
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:55,760
Zhou Tong, what happened to the Lu Zhi Qiang you mentioned last time?

409
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,590
I heard he's already done investigating.

410
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:03,530
At that time, he was transferred away because of the Tang Ye New City relocation case.

411
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:06,050
He's told me this.

412
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:09,500
He said that relocation case was very complex. It hurt

413
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,510
Xie Qing Ping.

414
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,350
Yes. I also heard the presiding judge say that Lu Zhi Qiang

415
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:19,990
was unyielding. He kept appealing for over 20 years. Finally, he

416
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:22,710
got the attention of the municipal party committee head.

417
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,090
A while back, he wanted me to help him find Zhong Ke Ming's diaries.

418
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,620
Can you ask him to meet us?

419
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,380
I want to see if he has any evidence that could help us.

420
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,170
I'll try. It's a bit difficult.

421
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,020
Doesn't he want to look into the relocation case? Tell him

422
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,410
we have important evidence.

423
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:22,030
Zheng Hao, you've gotten Zheng Yi Jian's diaries?

424
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,970
Was there any information inside?

425
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,290
There wasn't anything unusual.

426
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,700
The diaries have every year.

427
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,520
The only years missing are '87 and '88.

428
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,530
Huh? That even more so means that there's a problem.

429
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:42,130
It must be that relocation case. There must be something there.

430
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:45,210
Zheng Hao, keep looking carefully.

431
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,800
Find the diaries from those years.

432
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:54,510
Do you know why they attacked your father Zheng Yi Jian?

433
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,600
Isn't it just because of that Yu Fen Li case?

434
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,270
No.

435
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,750
It's not just that case.

436
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,570
The real reason behind it is because

437
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:08,360
Zheng Yi Jian

438
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,940
got evidence that Tang Ye Corporation was taking bribes.

439
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,800
<i>Bribing Xie Qing Ping.</i>

440
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,070
<i>He was Pujiang county's deputy secretary.</i>

441
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,970
So it's like that.

442
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:24,030
But my brother and I searched the entire house.

443
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:27,340
We just can't find these two diaries.

444
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,820
What about this. Keep looking for it carefully.

445
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:37,040
Believe that your father wouldn't just throw away such important things.

446
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,600
Okay?

447
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,440
<i>So it's like that.</i>

448
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,850
<i>That anonymous letter really was written by father.</i>

449
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:39,040
Hello? You're still not asleep?

450
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,150
Yeah, what are you doing?

451
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,620
I'm writing a statement.

452
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,660
I want to tell you something.

453
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,690
What is it? Say it.

454
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,100
I found evidence.

455
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,570
I know why my father wrote you that anonymous letter.

456
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,700
Why?

457
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,710
It's because of Zhong Ke Ming.

458
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,340
So Zheng Yi Jian wrote me that letter because of this.

459
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,460
Now the mystery behind the anonymous letter is solved.

460
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:35,100
But why did he have to switch us?

461
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:44,000
He didn't write exactly what happened when switching the babies.

462
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,990
But the diary clearly shows

463
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,610
that Zheng Yi Jian knows Tang Ning is Zhong Ke Ming's daughter.

464
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,750
How would he know?

465
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,770
He must know what really happened when you were switched.

466
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,070
This diary mentions Xue Han Zhi.

467
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:44,900
Good. Good, Zheng Hao.

468
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,650
Teacher Zheng's diaries

469
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,070
not only solved the question of Tang Ning's anonymous letter,

470
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:52,150
but also opened up a scar that I've had for many years.

471
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:56,640
Do you think that if I give these diaries to the court

472
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,910
that we would have a chance of winning?

473
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,210
This... Right now it's very difficult to say.

474
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,500
The next hearing is in a few days.

475
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:11,370
If the maternity test results between Xia Yun and I can't get support from the court,

476
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,530
then we can only rely on these diaries.

477
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:17,680
Right now, the most important thing is to verify the authenticity of these diaries.

478
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,660
Only this way would the court accept this as evidence.

479
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:09,410
We will now continue the court's investigation.

480
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:11,370
Honorable judge,

481
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:14,550
our side wishes to submit new evidence to the court.

482
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,140
- New evidence? 
 - Yes.

483
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,650
It's very important written evidence.

484
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:23,000
What kind of written evidence? What does it help prove?

485
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,250
Zheng Yi Jian's diaries.

486
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:30,990
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by the Gone With The Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

487
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:37,730
Honorable judge, Zhong Ke Ming and I are both Zheng Yi Jian's students. We've both been his assistant lawyers.

488
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:40,920
These are photocopies of Zheng Yi Jian's diaries.

489
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,560
We are very familiar with his handwriting.

490
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,650
As for the authenticity of Teacher Zheng's diaries,

491
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,690
Lawyer Zhong doesn't have any objections, right?

492
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,300
Alright.

493
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,120
Next, please look at page 233 in the diary. Teacher Zheng

494
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:07,090
wrote this entry on March 7, 2014.

495
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,230
The entry is written like this.

496
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:17,800
<i>♫ The difference between red and black is only one thin line ♫</i>

497
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:23,310
<i>♫ Blazing regret is better than freezing perfection ♫</i>

498
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:28,380
<i>♫ I take one step forward and stand on the periphery of blackness ♫</i>

499
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:34,460
<i>♫ A pile of gray stained the edges of my shoes ♫</i>

500
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:39,410
<i>♫ The difference between love and hate is only one thin line ♫</i>

501
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:44,890
<i>♫ A clear end is worse than false lies ♫</i>

502
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:49,930
<i>♫ I take one step backward and say my farewells to hate ♫</i>

503
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:55,930
<i>♫ The sound of the word “forever” stabbed my heart ♫</i>

504
00:43:55,930 --> 00:44:01,380
<i>♫ Never tell me “forever” ♫</i>

505
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:06,680
<i>♫ It is just a notion to fool people ♫</i>

506
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:11,410
<i>♫ Who can promise that they’ve never used this word before? ♫</i>

507
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:18,190
<i>♫ In the end, they blame the long night for never seeing the next day ♫</i>

508
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:24,270
<i>♫ Never believe anybody when they say “forever” ♫</i>

509
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:29,680
<i>♫ It is just an alluring mask ♫</i>

510
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,390
<i>♫ Who can promise that they’ve never heard this word before? ♫</i>

511
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:43,130
<i>♫ That is only a story found in legends ♫</i>

512
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:48,590
<i>♫ The world is constantly changing, as are the winds and clouds ♫</i>

513
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:54,990
<i>♫ I clearly know the danger, yet I’ve fallen for it once again ♫</i>

514
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,360
<i>♫ Never say “forever” ♫</i>
