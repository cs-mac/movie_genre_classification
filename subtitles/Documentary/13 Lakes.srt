1
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,644
Are you sure you want to
be on that side of the wall?

2
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,564
They begin to tear down the
walls on Monday.

3
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,650
At the end of the month open season
police and schools.

4
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,528
Dont make that face, it seems
you are not happy.

5
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,496
I only hope they meet
what they promised.

6
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:15,659
Listen, it's the law and the law always
Looking for a fool like me...

7
00:01:15,694 --> 00:01:18,370
...to make sure
these things are fulfilled.

8
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,876
Three years later,
the government has changed.

9
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,879
...the rest...

10
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:42,644
Sector 13 Ultimatum

11
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,844
Stop!

12
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,112
Stop!

13
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,925
Keep it! Keep it!

14
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:14,022
There he is! There he is!

15
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,398
What?

16
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,602
Over here.

17
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,069
Hey, man.
Now we bring cops?

18
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,905
Sorry.

19
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,492
I am not enough.
Do you think a musketeer?

20
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,744
- Yes, I am Dartagnan.
- Are you teasing?

21
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:10,454
Dudu, leave.

22
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,999
Dudu, I never understand.
Why dont you study anything?

23
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,171
- Say, you look like a child.
- I am a child.

24
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:23,217
You Take care of others.
See you.

25
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,154
Sit back,
What did you do now?

26
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:48,082
- This city is not a hotel.
- Sorry.

27
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:51,245
- I got tired.
- Not in the same situation.

28
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,124
You're free, you
the whole city for you.

29
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,398
They treat us like animals.

30
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:00,344
And so since we were born.

31
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,346
Three years ago that
we say the same thing.

32
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:05,843
A government that fails to meet
their promises? That's weird.

33
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,347
If we do something,
will ignore.

34
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:12,099
We take the latter.

35
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,274
Not your culture, dude.
To us this wall protects us...

36
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:22,484
...as a fortress.

37
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,363
And those who come to disturb us
of society, not to us.

38
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:28,330
We have our own.

39
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,332
And that is fine
in this way.

40
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,328
And frankly, I prefer to be
the king of this small kingdom...

41
00:07:33,363 --> 00:07:35,421
...than a pawn out there.

42
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,583
So it is nice and lets you bring
police our wall...

43
00:07:37,618 --> 00:07:40,377
...if not, we will
measures with you.

44
00:07:40,412 --> 00:07:42,379
Do you understand?

45
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,257
This is good.

46
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:02,483
Take this.
A gift.

47
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,200
Yeah, boss?

48
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:15,037
Yes, boss.

49
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:16,955
Come on.

50
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,588
¡Leave!

51
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,587
Come on.

52
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,841
Come on!

53
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:11,570
Your merchandise arrived.
Do I enter the first client?

54
00:10:11,605 --> 00:10:14,486
Rude, let me enjoy
a while.

55
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:17,367
Get him out, at least that.

56
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,748
Everybody out!

57
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,249
Not you.

58
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,337
Go see the boss.

59
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,048
Come on, dance a little.

60
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,529
Mr. Ou will receive
at a time.

61
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,942
Tell me that hurts the ass
of sitting here.

62
00:10:49,977 --> 00:10:51,819
Tell yourself, sir.

63
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,406
Come on, get on his knees.

64
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,493
If you want to win more
you should be more inclined.

65
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:06,625
Put on your knees, my man.
And with his hands on his head.

66
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,602
- Thief?
- Worse.

67
00:11:08,603 --> 00:11:09,836
Police.

68
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,734
Being arrested,
can be silent...

69
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,632
...until the present
the judge...

70
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,384
If you think that I a...

71
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,970
In French it means
shut up, okay?

72
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,609
No, it's a Ming vase
the twelfth century.

73
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:36,613
Do not worry, it is false,
long time ago that the monitors.

74
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:41,201
And the rest?
Are all fake?

75
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,245
Almost. Except for the Van Gogh.

76
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:51,670
Central, and I have the soap.
Again, I have soap.

77
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,756
Understood,
precise location.

78
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,845
- I am the soap?
- I feel more of a shampoo.

79
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:03,849
- In the fishing would be more appropriate.
- How, fishing?

80
00:12:03,884 --> 00:12:06,727
Do not worry.
You do not have to understand.

81
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,696
Mr Calma.
Health monitoring.

82
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,575
We would like to see the boss.

83
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,925
Lord, there is a control
at the door.

84
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,296
Two police officers and insurance
there are more hidden.

85
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,840
Here is why. Dale.

86
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:42,429
Dale.

87
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,859
- You bastard!
- You see, already beginning to fall.

88
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,939
Never leave here, this building
is monitored by all parties.

89
00:12:51,974 --> 00:12:54,191
If it were easy,
I have sent.

90
00:12:54,226 --> 00:12:55,741
What is that?

91
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,861
It's simple, if you talk
your cheeks explode.

92
00:12:57,896 --> 00:12:59,912
Want to try?
Okay.

93
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:02,908
I'll report
you are cooperative.

94
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,369
Central, I'm going fishing.

95
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,969
Mr Ou awaits.

96
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,151
They stay.

97
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,147
Stay here
okay.

98
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:40,779
Mr Ou,
gives me pleasure to see you.

99
00:13:40,814 --> 00:13:43,907
Do not move.
There.

100
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:45,993
Walk.

101
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,550
Gentlemen, after you.

102
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,598
I left the last or what?

103
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,600
Them first.

104
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,950
- Hugo.
- Do you know?

105
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:22,112
Yes, I have photos of yourself
all over my room.

106
00:14:22,147 --> 00:14:23,568
Shit!

107
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:24,955
Come on.

108
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,159
Raise the head.

109
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:31,080
- What is that?
- You know, it was you who invented it.

110
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,961
Gentlemen, follow me.

111
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,135
Is thumbing its nose at me.

112
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,679
And let it gives the same.

113
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,432
A week ago!
that fat...!

114
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:54,895
Come on, calm down.
Drink a margarita, you relax.

115
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:01,610
When you fuck with your margarita!

116
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:04,529
I'm sick of these guys!

117
00:15:04,564 --> 00:15:06,865
Outside, start
to despair.

118
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:17,835
Mr. Sam, just went looking for him.

119
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,174
Now I try this?
Do your best customer?

120
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:26,760
Since when
I leave for the final?

121
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,512
Always let the shit
for the final.

122
00:15:28,547 --> 00:15:30,264
Open arms.

123
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,979
What are you doing?

124
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,358
And that picture?

125
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,246
And this shit?

126
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,116
Do not you do anything?

127
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:54,079
I fell on it
when I was kid.

128
00:15:54,114 --> 00:15:56,123
Well, fix it.

129
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,218
It's nothing,
I fell Bucar.

130
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:15,058
Central Fisheries ended.
Sent to males.

131
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,811
I already did.

132
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:25,110
- Nobody move!
- ¡Todos al piso!

133
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:29,246
Hands on your head!

134
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:31,533
- Come on, come on!
- Leaving!

135
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,043
Come on!

136
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:00,479
Never leave live here
Police disgusting.

137
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,356
You do not have any
Chance!

138
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,149
Are you sure?

139
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,276
Let go! Let go!

140
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:14,535
- I guess I did not give the code.
- Fuck you.

141
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,745
No matter, I have the key.

142
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:41,103
¡Move!

143
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,321
- I head to the south.
- South?

144
00:17:51,356 --> 00:17:53,073
Send the rest.

145
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:58,162
Watch your feet!

146
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:15,387
Push!

147
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,272
Drop it!

148
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:21,018
Get out! Shit, get out!

149
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,189
The found it!

150
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:30,444
I told them I was cheating
everywhere.

151
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:44,291
What happened?
I will kill you.

152
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,963
Open up!

153
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,400
Crap.

154
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:20,369
- You okay?
- Yes, but try to open.

155
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,332
T move.

156
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:30,337
This picture is worth
200 million euros.

157
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:32,262
It's a Van Gogh.

158
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:35,592
A stray bullet, a scratch
and no longer worth anything.

159
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:37,297
Die motherfucker!

160
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:49,059
There he is! There he is!

161
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:19,339
Okay, I see the keyboard.

162
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,512
Do I have?

163
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,266
Nice to meet you.

164
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:39,109
Central, there is a bomb.

165
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:42,029
- A bomb?
- Any idea?

166
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:58,754
- Where is it?
- In the kitchen in the basement.

167
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:01,673
It's good,
we will send you the necessary.

168
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:19,608
Beware!

169
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,860
Well, since you sent it.

170
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:23,529
Fantastic!

171
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:09,783
Nice to see them.
Welcome.

172
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,051
- Do you have scratches?
- No, I do not think so.

173
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:23,922
- I was referring to you, Damian.
- I'm fine, Commander, thank you.

174
00:24:23,957 --> 00:24:25,973
Anyway,
not just these.

175
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:28,100
Go to rest,
make the report tomorrow.

176
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,929
I prefer to continue working
in what I have in my head.

177
00:24:30,964 --> 00:24:33,147
Tomorrow I'll go early,
If you do not mind.

178
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:36,018
No, I will see you in my office
at noon. Is an order.

179
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:37,936
Thank you.

180
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:45,736
- Good work.
- Thanks.

181
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:22,648
Everything is fine.

182
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,903
Is clear.

183
00:25:27,938 --> 00:25:29,822
Do come.

184
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:39,873
Gentlemen.

185
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:55,013
- How does the work?
- Superb.

186
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,809
How long does it take to
a tower like this?

187
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:01,895
That depends on the start
of work.

188
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:04,356
But more or less
eight years.

189
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:08,235
Good.

190
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:10,487
Yes

191
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:12,781
Get him out.

192
00:26:21,165 --> 00:26:23,298
As in the neighborhood
Chantier of...

193
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,378
...twice now, if we give the
guarantee that the constructed.

194
00:26:26,413 --> 00:26:28,380
The operation will begin
tonight.

195
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:29,923
Perfect.

196
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,239
- Well, thank you tomorrow.
- Goodbye, Damien.

197
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:00,662
Crap.

198
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,115
Damian ¿?

199
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:46,375
Have you forgotten me?

200
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:47,876
No.

201
00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:50,963
This only gave a time
to rest.

202
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:55,926
For eight hours I'm
resting, and I'm fantastic!

203
00:27:57,428 --> 00:28:00,145
Wait.
Soft, soft.

204
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,474
It hurts the whole body.

205
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:04,768
Does it hurt the whole body?

206
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:08,981
Almost.

207
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:11,150
Is that makeup?

208
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,610
Yes, it's for work.

209
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:15,661
It is the work.

210
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:18,532
You told me you spend
the day looking for pictures.

211
00:28:18,567 --> 00:28:20,701
I say it's my job.

212
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:24,288
Well, you better show me
that the wait was worth it.

213
00:28:26,457 --> 00:28:28,375
Speaking.

214
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:38,385
The suspect is
in the next seven.

215
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:41,680
What good music.

216
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:43,974
Excuse me.

217
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:55,527
Again, auto blue...

218
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:58,530
54, we are close.

219
00:28:58,565 --> 00:29:00,657
Well, received 54.

220
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,603
So, Salim
Is not it?

221
00:29:08,638 --> 00:29:11,154
- Yes, yes!
- Listen!

222
00:29:11,189 --> 00:29:13,635
Yes, hi.
Are you at home?

223
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,715
No, I'm in a palace
overlooking the Eiffel Tower.

224
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:22,387
- And where is your palace?
- On the Champs Elysees.

225
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:25,647
Beautiful direction.

226
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:28,435
Well, you listen,
Do you want to do?

227
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:30,444
Yes, it is Sofia.

228
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:34,274
Well, "Push the Air"
is for her.

229
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:38,278
Well, you know,
Coordinator...

230
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:48,414
- No!
- Shit!

231
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:53,502
What?

232
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:57,172
Everything will be fine.

233
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:01,510
- Sami.
- What?

234
00:30:01,545 --> 00:30:03,470
The police.

235
00:30:08,434 --> 00:30:10,811
- Download music.
- It's our music.

236
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:13,605
- It's nothing bad.
- I decided I did.

237
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,729
Come on, roles,
the two.

238
00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:17,818
- Come on, here.
- Grab.

239
00:30:20,446 --> 00:30:22,489
- Who owns the car?
- Of my father.

240
00:30:22,524 --> 00:30:24,199
¿Driving license?

241
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,159
I have not, take it away.

242
00:30:26,194 --> 00:30:27,668
What about your license?

243
00:30:27,703 --> 00:30:29,621
I'm 17 years,
I have no license!

244
00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:31,505
Not doing anything,
we hear music!

245
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,584
¡Since when is prohibited
listen to music?

246
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:35,541
We're not bothering
anyone.

247
00:30:35,576 --> 00:30:37,463
- Come out of that car.
- No.

248
00:30:37,498 --> 00:30:39,089
Hurry.

249
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:57,065
Shit! Again.

250
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:59,902
Go see what happened.

251
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:03,363
Okay.

252
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:11,371
- And what is this?
- I do not know, I do not know.

253
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:13,707
Shoot, shoot.

254
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:41,450
- What is it, officer?
- A routine check.

255
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:44,655
Some girls who listen
music is not so dangerous.

256
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,907
Why not search? Are
the girls carrying...

257
00:31:46,942 --> 00:31:48,749
...drugs in this neighborhood.

258
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:51,578
We'll give you a vote
confidence tonight.

259
00:31:51,613 --> 00:31:53,545
- Can you drive?
- Yes

260
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,040
- Get out.
- But I have no license.

261
00:31:55,075 --> 00:31:56,542
Get out!

262
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:04,800
Shit, they left.
But she has no license.

263
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:06,885
What do we do?
Do we continue?

264
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,602
- Come on.
- No, stay.

265
00:32:08,637 --> 00:32:10,722
- You keep shooting.
- I am.

266
00:32:10,757 --> 00:32:12,808
What service
are you exactly?

267
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:15,098
Secret Service.

268
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,354
Talk in your car.

269
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:28,914
Shit!

270
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:30,749
Do not move,
still filming!

271
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:33,495
- And what is this?
- You keep shooting.

272
00:32:40,836 --> 00:32:43,213
And what is this?

273
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:47,885
The registration, make him zoom
to enrollment.

274
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,727
Now I do.

275
00:32:49,762 --> 00:32:51,930
Shit, never
I had seen that.

276
00:32:51,965 --> 00:32:54,433
Give me here, and I do.

277
00:32:55,768 --> 00:32:56,942
- Samir.
- What?

278
00:32:56,977 --> 00:32:59,980
Policemen killed
police, is a bomb.

279
00:33:00,606 --> 00:33:04,818
Precisely, rather than see it explode
hear the official version.

280
00:33:04,853 --> 00:33:06,737
That will do.

281
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:42,571
What?

282
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:45,317
- A police here?
- What are you talking about?

283
00:33:45,352 --> 00:33:47,528
Are you crazy?

284
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:49,696
What are you doing?

285
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:52,574
Something wrong, I assure you.

286
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:54,875
Hey, you,
Are you lost the way?

287
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,871
- This is not a parking lot.
- Yes, you can be sure.

288
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:03,710
- Do you have framed?
- Yes

289
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:05,754
Perfect.

290
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:09,633
They're shooting!

291
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:11,385
Fire!

292
00:34:16,098 --> 00:34:19,143
Come on, abnormal
excédanse.

293
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:24,815
- The clock is well placed?
- Yes

294
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:27,693
Dale, collects and
we go home.

295
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,953
Diss.

296
00:35:14,073 --> 00:35:15,282
Where are you going?

297
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:19,036
Still asleep, I'm going to see a
film. Do not worry.

298
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:34,196
Get down, hands behind!

299
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:36,261
- I'm police!
- Get down!

300
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:38,888
¡Damien!

301
00:35:38,923 --> 00:35:40,390
What?

302
00:35:42,101 --> 00:35:45,104
Who is responsible for
the unit? I want to talk.

303
00:35:46,105 --> 00:35:47,815
I am.

304
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:52,159
I think they are wrong
person.

305
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:56,156
Damien Tomaso, captain
the armed forces 31 years.

306
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:03,121
What is the reason
of this record?

307
00:36:03,156 --> 00:36:06,041
Captain, we find
this in the kitchen.

308
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:10,254
Well here is why.
Come, collect a few things...

309
00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:12,589
...we go.

310
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:33,277
It is unbearable.

311
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:36,161
Georges, explain.

312
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:39,074
Six months ago we
gives good results.

313
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:43,162
Mr. President, we do not have the means to
reviewed every quarter, every season.

314
00:36:43,197 --> 00:36:45,956
Ahórreme story
the means, please.

315
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:49,146
There was a plan to
the periphery.

316
00:36:49,181 --> 00:36:52,045
So something had to
have improved.

317
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:55,215
How Explíqueme
Could we do this.

318
00:36:56,175 --> 00:36:59,094
I assure you that it is not
a generalized case.

319
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,098
- What is it then?
- Well this is...

320
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:06,059
...an isolated case.
No more.

321
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,895
I hope so.

322
00:37:08,187 --> 00:37:11,315
Meanwhile someone in póngame this
case. Someone seriously and effectively.

323
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:14,283
That Tomaso, for example.

324
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:16,201
It is your type of mission, huh?

325
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:19,239
I thought of him but was arrested this
morning for drug trafficking.

326
00:37:20,282 --> 00:37:22,284
Do you? Are you sure?

327
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:24,078
Unfortunately.

328
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:28,499
I would climb
next week.

329
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:32,336
I thought Gazmán, the head of Diss.
They are well informed about the industry.

330
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:36,965
Yes, very well. Okay.

331
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:52,439
Sir.

332
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,734
What? Already?

333
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,904
I guess they are
abreast of the situation.

334
00:37:58,939 --> 00:38:01,448
I had the time
to inform you, Chairman.

335
00:38:01,483 --> 00:38:02,373
Well.

336
00:38:02,408 --> 00:38:05,285
If this film is broadcast, we can
lose our credibility.

337
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,247
Put a civil car
in place.

338
00:38:09,415 --> 00:38:12,042
We have 48 hours.

339
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:16,296
It is exactly the time they have
to resolve this matter.

340
00:38:16,331 --> 00:38:17,881
- Under the utmost discretion.
- Yes, sir.

341
00:38:17,916 --> 00:38:20,092
We will, Mr. President.

342
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:34,523
This does not know that war is never
has been at odds with democracy.

343
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,528
Special Feature:
Last night in the 13...

344
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:43,323
...an altercation between a banda
and law enforcement...

345
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:09,266
- Wow!
- Look, it's an inner chamber.

346
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:16,523
That's bullshit!
That was not by chance!

347
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:22,453
Yes?
Why are you here?

348
00:39:22,488 --> 00:39:24,573
I was wrong place,
as the whole world.

349
00:39:24,608 --> 00:39:27,451
Is no reason to
we have here.

350
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:31,038
You did well,
so get out!

351
00:39:32,581 --> 00:39:34,500
I have rights!

352
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:49,598
Come on, go get your
colleagues and tell them to take care.

353
00:39:58,649 --> 00:40:00,067
Come on!

354
00:40:01,402 --> 00:40:03,654
- What industry?
- 13.

355
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:05,371
Perfect.

356
00:40:05,406 --> 00:40:08,033
Boss, can I show you something?

357
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:13,956
Sent us this.

358
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:23,590
Is the chamber that
passed yesterday.

359
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:27,719
But look at this.

360
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:33,559
Probably some boys who
attempting to get some girls.

361
00:40:35,561 --> 00:40:38,772
When I saw
I did a zoom...

362
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,236
...and saw this.

363
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:47,615
Shit, it filmed.

364
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:48,614
Yes

365
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:51,660
Encuéntrenme that number
Registration away.

366
00:40:51,695 --> 00:40:52,995
- I'm on it.
- Perfect.

367
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:11,472
Letto, I seek.

368
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:15,809
- I filmed everything and now I seek.
- What are you talking about?

369
00:41:15,844 --> 00:41:17,770
Car of television.

370
00:41:17,805 --> 00:41:19,605
Shit!

371
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:22,566
There!

372
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,780
Stop!

373
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:49,718
- This is Samir.
- Stop!

374
00:41:49,753 --> 00:41:51,887
¡Suéltenlo! ¡Suéltenlo!

375
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:54,014
Let go of my partner!

376
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:56,642
Estate calm
or you take yourself too.

377
00:41:57,684 --> 00:41:59,436
Let go of my partner!

378
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:13,659
Open the door 14.

379
00:42:15,786 --> 00:42:17,329
Come on.

380
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:21,708
- Can I borrow my cell phone?
- What else you want?

381
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:29,675
My cell phone.

382
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:34,221
Thank you.

383
00:42:38,142 --> 00:42:40,185
Come on up.

384
00:42:40,644 --> 00:42:43,772
Letto, I'm Damien, I'm fucked up,
partner, I need a hand...

385
00:42:44,815 --> 00:42:46,692
I am not at home.

386
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,194
...or maybe do not have the courage
to tell me in the face...

387
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:50,536
...left the message.

388
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:52,823
You gotta help me.
I'm Damien.

389
00:42:53,574 --> 00:42:56,535
I'm in the basement of the
Central Police Station.

390
00:42:56,827 --> 00:42:58,370
I lay a trap.

391
00:42:58,704 --> 00:43:00,706
I need to get out of here.

392
00:43:01,457 --> 00:43:03,709
I know I can count on you.

393
00:43:06,795 --> 00:43:09,465
Drop the phone!

394
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:22,060
Hey, guys!

395
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:27,399
The police are
everywhere, are you crazy?

396
00:43:27,434 --> 00:43:28,814
Yes, I know.

397
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:30,194
Are everywhere.

398
00:43:30,229 --> 00:43:31,904
Okay.

399
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:40,871
Leaving a minute.

400
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,251
Yes?

401
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:48,504
Called someone and told him.

402
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:51,965
- Who called?
- A one bed.

403
00:43:52,174 --> 00:43:53,557
Locate in sector 13.

404
00:43:53,592 --> 00:43:56,053
- Is aware of before?
- Yes, they were comrades.

405
00:43:56,929 --> 00:43:59,598
Tráiganme in that bed,
we do not risk it.

406
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:40,013
Has a new message.

407
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:47,062
Letto, I am calling
but never are. Okay, bye.

408
00:45:04,246 --> 00:45:06,039
Do not move!

409
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:18,385
- Do not pass.
- We ask you to think.

410
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:21,472
Think well.

411
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:26,685
Let's talk seriously.

412
00:45:26,977 --> 00:45:29,605
Some must die.
And you will be.

413
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:35,069
Up! Up!

414
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:44,912
Shit, they left.
But she has no license.

415
00:45:44,947 --> 00:45:47,039
And what do?
Do we continue?

416
00:45:47,074 --> 00:45:48,714
- Come on.
- No, stay.

417
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:51,050
- You keep shooting.
- I am.

418
00:45:51,085 --> 00:45:54,171
- What are they filming?
- Shoot, shoot.

419
00:45:57,925 --> 00:45:59,141
Shit!

420
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:01,143
Do not move,
still filming!

421
00:46:01,178 --> 00:46:03,931
- And what is this?
- You keep shooting.

422
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:06,106
And what is this?

423
00:46:06,141 --> 00:46:08,977
The registration, make him zoom
to enrollment.

424
00:46:09,012 --> 00:46:10,444
Now I do.

425
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:13,190
Crap,
never seen that.

426
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,328
Come on.

427
00:46:37,172 --> 00:46:40,676
You gotta help me.
Is Damian.

428
00:46:41,135 --> 00:46:44,471
I'm in the basement
Central Police Station.

429
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:46,974
I lay a trap.

430
00:46:47,182 --> 00:46:49,121
I need to get out of here.

431
00:46:49,156 --> 00:46:51,061
I know I can
count on you.

432
00:47:03,157 --> 00:47:06,083
You gotta help me.
I'm Damien.

433
00:47:06,118 --> 00:47:09,204
I'm in the basement
Central Police Station.

434
00:47:21,258 --> 00:47:23,093
I lay a trap.

435
00:47:48,243 --> 00:47:50,204
I need to get out of here.

436
00:47:50,454 --> 00:47:53,332
I know I can count
you.

437
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:31,286
What are you doing there?
Hurry!

438
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:39,336
Just disappear.
I look.

439
00:49:00,357 --> 00:49:02,025
Hurry! Hurry!

440
00:49:26,717 --> 00:49:28,552
Over here!

441
00:49:47,488 --> 00:49:48,947
There it goes!

442
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:10,135
We have to go to the other side!

443
00:50:44,545 --> 00:50:46,296
Wait! Wait!

444
00:50:46,505 --> 00:50:50,426
Come on! Come on!

445
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:11,697
Come on, shit! There he is!
Hurry!

446
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,330
Shit!

447
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:25,551
Were you shopping?

448
00:51:25,586 --> 00:51:27,755
- No, sir.
- Are you unable to catch...

449
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:29,513
...a guy with three
drives you?

450
00:51:29,548 --> 00:51:31,633
The individual is very clever, sir
I had never seen anything like this.

451
00:51:31,668 --> 00:51:34,011
Next time, ask
getting lessons.

452
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:36,805
Back to base, I will go
to see Mr. President.

453
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,646
Yes, sir.

454
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:39,412
And how are
things over there?

455
00:51:39,447 --> 00:51:41,143
I do not think it takes
to react.

456
00:51:55,616 --> 00:51:59,057
Do not kill the boy on purpose
I guarantee it.

457
00:51:59,092 --> 00:52:02,498
Tried to leave alone.
What is going to do?

458
00:52:03,665 --> 00:52:05,918
Explain to his mother.

459
00:52:07,628 --> 00:52:09,463
¡Move!

460
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:22,601
Right in the middle!

461
00:52:24,812 --> 00:52:25,646
Go, go!

462
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:54,633
Can I help you?

463
00:52:54,883 --> 00:52:57,219
Can I see the head,
please?

464
00:52:58,303 --> 00:53:00,764
Head, a young man who wants
talk to the manager.

465
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:03,308
- Do come.
- Come on, come on.

466
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,106
- What is it?
- It is a room, please.

467
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:11,692
Are you teasing?
This is not a hotel.

468
00:53:12,151 --> 00:53:14,319
Outside says
"hotel of the police. "

469
00:53:14,354 --> 00:53:16,697
Get out before they
bother me.

470
00:53:16,732 --> 00:53:18,330
Go, go!

471
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:21,743
Listen, you better be
locked up because I am a criminal...

472
00:53:21,778 --> 00:53:25,122
in power... and if I stay outside,
I do some nonsense.

473
00:53:25,157 --> 00:53:27,499
Have you committed any crime?

474
00:53:27,534 --> 00:53:28,674
No.

475
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:31,920
¿Well, you know what? Return to us
when you've committed any.

476
00:53:31,955 --> 00:53:34,631
I'll give you a good cell
Okay?

477
00:53:34,666 --> 00:53:36,049
Okay.

478
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,017
Get down! Get down!

479
00:53:39,052 --> 00:53:41,472
Do not move!
Do not move!

480
00:53:42,723 --> 00:53:44,600
Open the door 14.

481
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:49,987
You're lucky, only
a room.

482
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:52,983
- But there is no cover or food.
- What?

483
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:55,194
What do you expect?

484
00:54:02,826 --> 00:54:04,703
Drop it!

485
00:54:04,953 --> 00:54:06,914
You say you drop!

486
00:54:16,173 --> 00:54:18,258
Security.

487
00:54:18,717 --> 00:54:20,719
Security doors
are blocked.

488
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:29,436
You take your time.

489
00:54:29,978 --> 00:54:32,815
Want to return later
when you're in a good mood?

490
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:34,525
No, okay.

491
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:37,903
- Good to see you.
- Me too.

492
00:54:38,904 --> 00:54:40,948
Out there is shit,
Are you sure you want to leave?

493
00:54:40,983 --> 00:54:42,675
Yes, I have accounts
to fix.

494
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:44,368
Come on, do you have a plan?

495
00:54:44,403 --> 00:54:46,001
Why not have a plan?

496
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:48,956
I thought we had come as
so easy, you'll have one.

497
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:52,960
Sign was not so hard.

498
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:56,755
Exit will be a little more
complicated.

499
00:55:05,597 --> 00:55:07,182
You are well trained.

500
00:55:07,217 --> 00:55:08,732
Yes, more or less.

501
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:11,061
Come on, I know a shortcut.

502
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:20,362
Is this your shortcut?

503
00:55:32,249 --> 00:55:34,835
Run! Run!

504
00:55:48,307 --> 00:55:50,267
Tomaso escaped
of his cell.

505
00:55:50,302 --> 00:55:52,025
Have you been?

506
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,104
No, it is still
on the inside.

507
00:55:54,563 --> 00:55:57,024
- Find it.
- Yes

508
00:55:57,059 --> 00:55:58,407
And fast.

509
00:55:58,442 --> 00:56:01,028
...in the 13...

510
00:56:01,063 --> 00:56:03,120
Gentlemen.

511
00:56:03,155 --> 00:56:05,115
Already started?

512
00:56:05,574 --> 00:56:07,805
...of law enforcement...

513
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,037
and incidents...
multiply.

514
00:56:11,205 --> 00:56:14,083
Among the wounded are
many officers.

515
00:56:16,168 --> 00:56:18,962
Well, commander,
How can we?

516
00:56:18,997 --> 00:56:21,722
Sector 13
is out of control.

517
00:56:21,757 --> 00:56:25,010
And the risk in the next few hours is that
Nearby areas join him.

518
00:56:25,045 --> 00:56:28,222
The entire country may be
alarm in 24 hours.

519
00:56:28,597 --> 00:56:33,102
Overall, how a military intervention is
still advisable as a preventive measure?

520
00:56:33,137 --> 00:56:35,110
Yet. But the army...

521
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:38,065
...is not ready to
an internal invasion yet.

522
00:56:38,816 --> 00:56:42,111
Unfortunately, time
which is a luxury not available.

523
00:56:45,197 --> 00:56:48,033
Mr. Gazmán,
its recommendation.

524
00:56:48,992 --> 00:56:51,210
When the gangrene spreads,
need to be cut.

525
00:56:51,245 --> 00:56:57,209
Well, I was not elected because
my tolerance for metaphors.

526
00:56:57,584 --> 00:57:00,129
When I request a recommendation
I want a recommendation.

527
00:57:00,164 --> 00:57:02,297
Well, Mr. President,
I will be more direct.

528
00:57:02,332 --> 00:57:05,099
Evacuate area 13
in twelve hours.

529
00:57:05,134 --> 00:57:08,846
Tomorrow morning we fly across
the place and nobody can go back there.

530
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:11,181
And there are more advantages.

531
00:57:11,216 --> 00:57:13,107
This will create new jobs.

532
00:57:13,142 --> 00:57:15,609
Building a new
neighborhood full of middle class...

533
00:57:15,644 --> 00:57:18,188
...which will probably vote
for you in the upcoming elections.

534
00:57:20,315 --> 00:57:22,985
Could not be clearer.

535
00:57:23,402 --> 00:57:24,778
Gentlemen.

536
00:57:25,654 --> 00:57:27,406
That inspires them something?

537
00:57:27,698 --> 00:57:31,034
Politically, such a solution
would be extremely serious.

538
00:57:31,285 --> 00:57:33,620
What is your solution?

539
00:57:38,959 --> 00:57:40,377
Well.

540
00:57:41,086 --> 00:57:44,506
I note that none of you
have any specific proposal...

541
00:57:44,541 --> 00:57:46,508
do to defend that...
our democracy.

542
00:57:46,543 --> 00:57:47,766
Very interesting.

543
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:50,471
I remember that our function
first is to protect the French...

544
00:57:50,506 --> 00:57:52,062
...and look after their interests.

545
00:57:52,097 --> 00:57:55,309
And so do the values of
freedom, equality, and fraternity...

546
00:57:55,344 --> 00:57:59,028
...is still respected
in this country.

547
00:57:59,063 --> 00:58:03,067
Is somewhat, how do I say?
The foundation of our republic.

548
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:07,529
And the only proposal that I made
is to exploit the site, a nasty.

549
00:58:08,322 --> 00:58:09,371
Thank you.

550
00:58:09,406 --> 00:58:11,909
Mr. President,
the idea is appalling...

551
00:58:11,944 --> 00:58:14,251
...but we have priorities.

552
00:58:14,286 --> 00:58:18,040
Perhaps in two hours
the situation becomes uncontrollable.

553
00:58:18,075 --> 00:58:22,419
Perhaps not the best idea,
but believe me...

554
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:24,588
...is the least worst.

555
00:58:24,922 --> 00:58:26,465
General...

556
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:29,885
...Is that we can evacuate one million
of civilians in less than twelve hours?

557
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,061
If you give the order now,
may be possible.

558
00:58:32,096 --> 00:58:35,849
I suppose that some heads of clans
not so easily be evacuated.

559
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:38,102
Who will mourn?

560
00:58:50,406 --> 00:58:52,032
General.

561
00:58:52,908 --> 00:58:55,125
Proceed to the evacuation.

562
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,956
We will plan
tomorrow morning.

563
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:04,920
Mr. Gazmán, I demand that all
the inhabitants of that neighborhood...

564
00:59:04,955 --> 00:59:08,257
...are treated with respect
and dignity, and that means...

565
00:59:08,292 --> 00:59:09,758
...all.

566
00:59:10,008 --> 00:59:12,928
I will give the order personally,
Sir.

567
00:59:13,345 --> 00:59:14,680
Can go.

568
00:59:22,479 --> 00:59:24,148
Go there!

569
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,193
Keep looking!

570
00:59:38,078 --> 00:59:40,164
Here we are.

571
00:59:42,624 --> 00:59:47,045
- Do not you were a cop?
- They found drugs in my kitchen.

572
00:59:48,005 --> 00:59:49,673
Do not you know to save your stuff?

573
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:52,676
It was not mine.
I planted.

574
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,435
A classic.

575
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:56,597
Police want to fuck
other policemen.

576
00:59:56,632 --> 00:59:57,688
It is not common.

577
00:59:57,723 --> 00:59:59,398
Above all,
I wonder why.

578
00:59:59,433 --> 01:00:01,652
Sure to impedirte
you went somewhere.

579
01:00:01,653 --> 01:00:02,594
You are very sociable.

580
01:00:02,596 --> 01:00:03,527
I do not know.

581
01:00:03,562 --> 01:00:05,856
Surely something is
they do not want you goals.

582
01:00:06,148 --> 01:00:08,615
Super police
are not good for everything.

583
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:10,986
I had been given a holiday
or I would have graduated.

584
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:12,738
You would go on vacation?

585
01:00:14,281 --> 01:00:16,033
No, of course not.

586
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:23,123
You know what happens
out there?

587
01:00:23,158 --> 01:00:24,548
What's out there?

588
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:27,669
There is a recording that offers a
banda sector shot 13...

589
01:00:27,704 --> 01:00:29,046
...a patrol.

590
01:00:30,172 --> 01:00:32,591
But there is one in which
Moreover banda police...

591
01:00:32,626 --> 01:00:35,594
...is what you shoot
the patrol.

592
01:00:36,553 --> 01:00:38,388
And what was in the 13?

593
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:40,349
May have carried.

594
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:41,523
And then?

595
01:00:41,558 --> 01:00:45,104
After I gave the second
operates a portion of the building.

596
01:00:45,854 --> 01:00:48,524
It was the police.

597
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:53,320
But I managed to escape before.

598
01:00:56,615 --> 01:00:58,415
They are not policemen.

599
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:00,911
They must be criminals
posing as policemen.

600
01:01:00,946 --> 01:01:03,295
Why?
For pleasure?

601
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,833
It is a strategy for
end the sector 13.

602
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:08,085
And then build on it.

603
01:01:14,425 --> 01:01:16,343
Remember tuition?

604
01:01:18,554 --> 01:01:21,056
All have the same
Registration No: DISS.

605
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:25,561
DISS not think so.

606
01:01:25,596 --> 01:01:27,146
What is it?

607
01:01:27,688 --> 01:01:30,441
Internal Division Secret
Security.

608
01:01:30,733 --> 01:01:32,074
Well, that is.

609
01:01:32,109 --> 01:01:35,779
Receive direct orders
President of the Republic.

610
01:01:37,531 --> 01:01:40,117
The head of the DISS
Gazmán is fine.

611
01:01:40,152 --> 01:01:42,703
- Did you know?
- No, not really.

612
01:01:43,412 --> 01:01:46,582
No, I wanted to move there
six months ago and I refused.

613
01:01:46,617 --> 01:01:49,752
Well, there it is. Have mobile
crime and the offender.

614
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:54,256
Before we need
evidence.

615
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:56,550
How about this?

616
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:03,807
The images are not
sufficient.

617
01:02:04,433 --> 01:02:06,810
Something is necessary
the mind.

618
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:15,319
- What are you doing?
- Reflection.

619
01:02:15,611 --> 01:02:17,988
I do not like when
thinking.

620
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:21,700
- We must go to the office of Walter.
- That I feared.

621
01:02:21,735 --> 01:02:24,745
- Where is it?
- First floor, room 17.

622
01:02:27,122 --> 01:02:29,291
Do we do the former?

623
01:02:29,326 --> 01:02:31,460
Okay, the old one.

624
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:55,650
Can not be discreet
like me?

625
01:02:55,685 --> 01:02:58,445
You do not mind being discreet.

626
01:03:01,615 --> 01:03:03,409
And now what are you doing?

627
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:05,702
I'm thinking.

628
01:03:05,737 --> 01:03:07,586
There they are!

629
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:09,957
I say that I do not like.

630
01:03:36,984 --> 01:03:38,777
Do you have any idea?

631
01:03:39,653 --> 01:03:42,740
I will entertain you and
go to the office of Walter.

632
01:03:42,775 --> 01:03:44,873
Remember, first floor
in room 17.

633
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:46,910
Bring anything
that can serve as evidence.

634
01:03:47,161 --> 01:03:48,787
Are we seeing again?

635
01:03:48,996 --> 01:03:52,416
I do not think I move
far from here, quick, go!

636
01:04:08,891 --> 01:04:10,559
Now you'll see!

637
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:51,892
If you stay well, without saying anything,
no nothing will happen.

638
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:53,769
You have my word, okay?

639
01:04:55,854 --> 01:04:57,898
What is the computer
Mr. Garzo?

640
01:05:01,485 --> 01:05:02,986
Do not know
password?

641
01:05:14,915 --> 01:05:17,000
Good morning, some of you
have a computer...

642
01:05:17,035 --> 01:05:18,252
...that one moved?

643
01:05:18,287 --> 01:05:19,760
Yes, me.

644
01:05:19,795 --> 01:05:23,006
Service, it is I who
you install the new server.

645
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:28,011
I regret causing inconvenience.

646
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:34,393
I found it.

647
01:05:38,814 --> 01:05:40,607
Thanks, gentlemen.

648
01:06:18,854 --> 01:06:20,147
Damiano.

649
01:06:21,565 --> 01:06:25,110
It is more reasonable and let
justice address your problem.

650
01:06:29,573 --> 01:06:32,743
I did nothing,
and you know it well.

651
01:06:33,911 --> 01:06:37,289
Yes, I know. Prisons are
full of innocent people.

652
01:06:38,874 --> 01:06:41,543
However, the farms.

653
01:06:43,587 --> 01:06:45,380
Well, do we?

654
01:07:02,106 --> 01:07:03,440
What I do for you.

655
01:07:03,475 --> 01:07:04,775
I already pay.

656
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:08,153
Do not go!

657
01:07:12,116 --> 01:07:14,118
Shit!

658
01:07:15,035 --> 01:07:16,620
We can still walk, no?

659
01:07:17,913 --> 01:07:19,289
Put the belt.

660
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:42,104
- What are you doing?
- Well, go ahead.

661
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:00,831
Sorry.

662
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:06,211
I listen.

663
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,213
- Damian escaped.
- How to be escaped?

664
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:10,097
Letto what came to seek.

665
01:08:10,132 --> 01:08:12,384
He came to look for
and escaped.

666
01:08:12,419 --> 01:08:14,636
Can you explain
how they escaped?

667
01:08:15,179 --> 01:08:17,014
Go to your office.

668
01:08:17,264 --> 01:08:19,273
What do we do?
Do we pursue?

669
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:22,144
No, too, the military
are everywhere.

670
01:08:22,179 --> 01:08:24,354
More attentive
anyway.

671
01:08:24,389 --> 01:08:26,023
Understood.

672
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,741
Follow the instructions
that he was given.

673
01:08:44,124 --> 01:08:46,335
And where you lead us well?

674
01:09:17,324 --> 01:09:19,388
There is always a watchful
about the law.

675
01:09:19,423 --> 01:09:21,418
Yes, that I was you
promised to change.

676
01:09:21,453 --> 01:09:23,921
There will always be a fool
like you to apply.

677
01:09:23,956 --> 01:09:26,375
They are laws which are bad,
are the people that deliver them.

678
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:29,002
Yeah, like religion.
Incidentally, what's yours?

679
01:09:29,294 --> 01:09:32,381
I was baptized when he was a boy,
but my only goal...

680
01:09:32,416 --> 01:09:34,466
now...
is the civil code.

681
01:09:34,501 --> 01:09:35,974
What?

682
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:38,470
My only goal now
is the civil code.

683
01:09:38,505 --> 01:09:40,431
You're worse than a Mormon.

684
01:09:43,308 --> 01:09:45,602
Well, do we or do we
were to give us?

685
01:09:45,637 --> 01:09:47,146
We're going.

686
01:10:07,458 --> 01:10:09,376
- What do you want?
- Talking with Tao.

687
01:10:09,411 --> 01:10:10,551
About what?

688
01:10:10,586 --> 01:10:12,838
About the sector
and its inhabitants.

689
01:10:13,422 --> 01:10:16,216
Are you kidding.
Business.

690
01:10:31,607 --> 01:10:33,484
Let them pass.

691
01:10:52,836 --> 01:10:54,254
What are you doing here?

692
01:10:56,423 --> 01:10:59,468
They stole a team
national protection.

693
01:10:59,503 --> 01:11:01,220
Are good.

694
01:11:03,222 --> 01:11:04,355
Well?

695
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:07,643
They will, provided we
get some things that interest us.

696
01:11:08,352 --> 01:11:09,916
And what is this?

697
01:11:09,951 --> 01:11:11,480
A little catechism.

698
01:11:12,398 --> 01:11:14,615
You've always lived here
in sector 13.

699
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:16,735
Where do you think will live
when you destroy?

700
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:18,946
We must avoid that.

701
01:11:23,534 --> 01:11:25,661
ANIEL, get that.

702
01:11:53,647 --> 01:11:55,447
That's it.
Is open.

703
01:11:55,482 --> 01:11:57,609
- They are everywhere.
- Everywhere.

704
01:11:57,644 --> 01:11:59,528
Where did you learn that?

705
01:12:00,028 --> 01:12:01,739
Well, in books.

706
01:12:03,657 --> 01:12:05,743
Come on, do it.

707
01:12:09,621 --> 01:12:11,957
That interests me.

708
01:12:12,499 --> 01:12:15,461
- We are now on Iran.
- I too am interested.

709
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:17,636
Here it is, sector 13.

710
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:19,673
These are the goals,
five towers.

711
01:12:19,708 --> 01:12:21,925
There must be something else.

712
01:12:22,593 --> 01:12:25,436
Walter manages to
is angry with you.

713
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:27,681
The President ordered their destruction
and build everything new.

714
01:12:27,716 --> 01:12:29,679
- As in Iraq.
- Yes

715
01:12:29,714 --> 01:12:31,608
But now
the French.

716
01:12:31,643 --> 01:12:34,188
And how will destroy
towers?

717
01:12:37,357 --> 01:12:39,193
In position.

718
01:13:05,552 --> 01:13:08,555
Three helicopters.
They are up there.

719
01:13:09,765 --> 01:13:11,809
Shoot them with lasers.

720
01:13:12,101 --> 01:13:13,769
That sent the missiles.

721
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:19,823
How?

722
01:13:19,858 --> 01:13:22,451
Probably do
from a command post.

723
01:13:22,486 --> 01:13:24,780
Only the President can
have given an order like that.

724
01:13:24,815 --> 01:13:26,747
And what do
to prevent it?

725
01:13:26,782 --> 01:13:29,576
Go read the manual.
Because your head voice...

726
01:13:29,611 --> 01:13:32,503
...starts to sweat
a little.

727
01:13:32,538 --> 01:13:35,707
Bothers you because I do some
Ambivilent, is it?

728
01:13:37,918 --> 01:13:39,545
I apologize.

729
01:13:40,921 --> 01:13:43,549
If you call "lechuguita"
Does this do you prefer?

730
01:13:43,584 --> 01:13:46,844
- What if you call me by my name?
- Okay.

731
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:48,852
What is your name?

732
01:13:48,887 --> 01:13:51,890
Damien Tomaso, commander
French army.

733
01:13:53,726 --> 01:13:56,228
A police
if preferred.

734
01:13:58,272 --> 01:14:01,608
Now I believe I should
forget prejudices...

735
01:14:02,192 --> 01:14:04,737
...and let us hand.

736
01:14:16,081 --> 01:14:19,126
Tao delighted.

737
01:14:19,161 --> 01:14:20,836
Alike.

738
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:26,967
Now, what is your plan,
lechuguita?

739
01:14:50,824 --> 01:14:52,826
- Thanks for coming.
- What is it?

740
01:14:53,786 --> 01:14:55,537
You explain.

741
01:15:11,929 --> 01:15:13,305
Hello.

742
01:15:16,892 --> 01:15:19,353
Is there.

743
01:15:35,077 --> 01:15:37,246
Alika, guns.

744
01:15:38,914 --> 01:15:42,126
March specialist
in machetes.

745
01:15:43,877 --> 01:15:47,047
Carlos Skin,
specialist cars.

746
01:15:48,799 --> 01:15:51,844
Montana pumps.

747
01:15:53,053 --> 01:15:54,596
Sorry.

748
01:15:57,808 --> 01:15:59,935
Think you can
take place?

749
01:16:00,144 --> 01:16:02,855
Yes, not lose the opportunity
to show their skills.

750
01:16:08,902 --> 01:16:10,654
Gentlemen.

751
01:16:11,113 --> 01:16:13,574
Thanks to all
to come.

752
01:16:14,116 --> 01:16:17,244
For 19 hours,
Sector 13 was evacuated.

753
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:19,962
Their intention is to fly around.

754
01:16:19,997 --> 01:16:22,875
If you are in need,
I have everything they need.

755
01:16:23,751 --> 01:16:26,128
The idea is to avoid it.

756
01:16:29,006 --> 01:16:31,049
Who is in favor?

757
01:16:42,269 --> 01:16:45,189
Well, you pass the word a...

758
01:16:45,898 --> 01:16:49,026
Damien who...
will explain his plan.

759
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:59,161
We all have to agree
in the five hours we have left.

760
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:03,248
Then I need
of about thirty men.

761
01:17:03,999 --> 01:17:06,251
Trained in combat,
and care nothing about weapons.

762
01:17:06,286 --> 01:17:07,676
We will not hunt.

763
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:10,318
We broke in silence
the neutralized...

764
01:17:10,353 --> 01:17:12,925
...and let live
center operations.

765
01:17:13,926 --> 01:17:15,594
Questions?

766
01:17:16,136 --> 01:17:18,597
Where is
the command post?

767
01:17:19,723 --> 01:17:20,682
Here, in the Paris.

768
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:41,787
Over here, Mr. President.

769
01:17:49,294 --> 01:17:52,297
Strengthen security
around the building.

770
01:17:55,008 --> 01:17:57,052
Go to the signal.

771
01:18:05,102 --> 01:18:07,813
Remain in the air,
Over and out.

772
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:13,944
Good morning, gentlemen.
Sit down.

773
01:18:15,988 --> 01:18:18,247
So, General,
Where are we?

774
01:18:18,282 --> 01:18:21,250
The order is Jaguards
flying over the targets.

775
01:18:21,285 --> 01:18:24,329
Talked about the evacuation,
rather than destruction.

776
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,249
It is a priority, right?

777
01:18:27,666 --> 01:18:29,001
Yes, sir.

778
01:18:29,293 --> 01:18:30,919
Sir.

779
01:18:31,336 --> 01:18:34,882
We evacuated 1087310
people in less than two hours...

780
01:18:35,257 --> 01:18:37,634
...but there are persons who
We have not approached.

781
01:18:37,669 --> 01:18:40,436
It all
located here.

782
01:18:40,471 --> 01:18:42,389
We have tried
and there is already injured.

783
01:18:42,424 --> 01:18:44,975
This could be delayed.

784
01:18:46,393 --> 01:18:48,986
How many people do not
have been evacuated yet?

785
01:18:49,021 --> 01:18:51,190
Long time no
a census is done in that neighborhood...

786
01:18:51,225 --> 01:18:53,484
...but I think
a few thousand.

787
01:18:54,109 --> 01:18:57,112
Those few, are many.
Continue the evacuation.

788
01:19:03,202 --> 01:19:05,496
- We are sent here.
- To us too!

789
01:19:17,257 --> 01:19:19,468
Okay.

790
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,196
Turn both keys
at once.

791
01:19:32,231 --> 01:19:35,401
Five missiles, all will
at the same time.

792
01:20:22,489 --> 01:20:24,950
To tell you the truth,
Gentlemen...

793
01:20:25,325 --> 01:20:28,161
...I do not feel very well
with all this.

794
01:20:28,196 --> 01:20:30,998
- Can I give you some advice?
- Please.

795
01:20:31,457 --> 01:20:34,251
I know that guy
men.

796
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:37,254
They do not respect anything, not to
people and to the laws.

797
01:20:37,289 --> 01:20:40,340
Just kill and steal
for their benefit.

798
01:20:40,375 --> 01:20:42,307
And you are not
responsible.

799
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:44,053
They were there before
their arrival.

800
01:20:44,088 --> 01:20:46,388
And what can be
do with them?

801
01:20:46,423 --> 01:20:48,397
Are you?
No.

802
01:20:48,432 --> 01:20:51,518
Believe me, to get rid of them,
must be exterminated.

803
01:21:09,912 --> 01:21:11,371
¡Warning!

804
01:21:20,506 --> 01:21:23,467
Mr. Gazmán, find your
cynicism, in terror.

805
01:21:23,967 --> 01:21:26,643
No, Mr. President, just
I am being pragmatic.

806
01:21:26,678 --> 01:21:31,182
One of the causes of our
recession is the parallel economy...

807
01:21:31,217 --> 01:21:35,687
...with these guys that make you lose
million at the box state.

808
01:21:36,355 --> 01:21:38,447
With destruction
like that...

809
01:21:38,482 --> 01:21:42,403
...we can build a site
we make money again.

810
01:21:42,611 --> 01:21:45,614
So we are rid of this scourge
and we can build something more.

811
01:21:45,823 --> 01:21:49,660
Destroy to build,
Is that your solution?

812
01:21:50,077 --> 01:21:52,913
In any case,
what comes to mind.

813
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,091
Here.

814
01:22:06,635 --> 01:22:08,220
General.

815
01:22:08,554 --> 01:22:11,223
Do the helicopter assault
already in the air?

816
01:22:12,516 --> 01:22:13,976
Yeah.

817
01:22:14,011 --> 01:22:15,436
Landing.

818
01:22:16,562 --> 01:22:19,446
Do not get this key
in the lock...

819
01:22:19,481 --> 01:22:22,901
...until it is satisfied that there is no
civil strife in that neighborhood.

820
01:22:23,861 --> 01:22:25,821
- Understand?
- Well, sir.

821
01:23:01,732 --> 01:23:04,485
My General, a banda
entered the building.

822
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,909
Well, neutralícela.

823
01:23:05,944 --> 01:23:08,447
They are unarmed,
but many.

824
01:23:08,482 --> 01:23:10,324
To continue, I occupy.

825
01:23:14,912 --> 01:23:16,914
Go see what happens.

826
01:23:23,545 --> 01:23:26,048
Come, dear.

827
01:24:33,741 --> 01:24:36,201
Montana, said that
no injuries.

828
01:24:36,236 --> 01:24:38,662
It is only
my personal safety.

829
01:24:43,584 --> 01:24:45,043
What?

830
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:48,255
Do not worry, the building
is heavily equipped.

831
01:24:48,839 --> 01:24:50,299
Calm down.

832
01:24:57,139 --> 01:25:00,350
This is mine.

833
01:25:13,697 --> 01:25:16,492
So?
How prefer?

834
01:25:17,493 --> 01:25:20,704
Listen, you...

835
01:25:25,292 --> 01:25:27,669
The rules are
adhered to.

836
01:25:27,878 --> 01:25:30,380
But not with guys like you.

837
01:25:33,926 --> 01:25:37,096
We love to know
to guys like you.

838
01:25:39,431 --> 01:25:41,725
And these orejitas?

839
01:25:43,727 --> 01:25:44,812
You okay?

840
01:25:52,403 --> 01:25:54,405
No answer.

841
01:25:56,281 --> 01:25:57,616
Te llamo.

842
01:25:57,950 --> 01:26:00,911
Mr. President, I inform you that any
the sector is completely evacuated.

843
01:26:02,621 --> 01:26:05,269
I do not understand, one hour ago
risked...

844
01:26:05,304 --> 01:26:07,883
...you can not evacuate
those thousands.

845
01:26:07,918 --> 01:26:10,838
I do not know, maybe the message
had not come either.

846
01:26:10,873 --> 01:26:13,841
Anyway, everything is
vacuum, we guarantee it.

847
01:26:21,348 --> 01:26:22,975
In that case.

848
01:26:31,817 --> 01:26:34,653
Get in position.

849
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,866
Received signal,
attack in a minute.

850
01:26:39,074 --> 01:26:40,993
Are in position,
Sir.

851
01:26:58,135 --> 01:27:00,095
Do not move!
Come on!

852
01:27:00,130 --> 01:27:01,972
We say that...!

853
01:27:04,141 --> 01:27:07,186
This is the hand you get
in the throat if you do not shut up, okay?

854
01:27:12,441 --> 01:27:14,818
Gentlemen, I am the President
of the Republic.

855
01:27:15,194 --> 01:27:18,906
- On the television.
- I've seen on the Internet.

856
01:27:20,991 --> 01:27:23,619
Captain Tomaso,
Can you explain?

857
01:27:24,119 --> 01:27:27,247
The images speak higher
that the words, Mr. President.

858
01:27:38,092 --> 01:27:40,344
- Shoot, shoot.
- And what is that?

859
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:45,891
I do not know,
but still rolling.

860
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:49,812
Shit!

861
01:27:50,145 --> 01:27:51,362
What is that?

862
01:27:51,397 --> 01:27:53,072
The DISS in action.

863
01:27:53,107 --> 01:27:55,609
The police wanted
discredit the sector...

864
01:27:55,644 --> 01:27:58,112
...to destroy everything
and then build.

865
01:27:58,147 --> 01:28:00,739
It sure will
a commission for that.

866
01:28:01,949 --> 01:28:04,041
If the images
do not meet...

867
01:28:04,076 --> 01:28:07,246
...behold the disk of
special operations of DISS.

868
01:28:07,955 --> 01:28:10,541
Is it not true, Walter?

869
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:14,628
We have sent
vacation.

870
01:28:15,087 --> 01:28:16,470
Nobody move!

871
01:28:16,505 --> 01:28:18,632
What are you doing?

872
01:28:19,258 --> 01:28:21,218
Remove the key.

873
01:28:22,136 --> 01:28:24,972
Remove the key.
Fast.

874
01:28:25,472 --> 01:28:26,814
Come on!

875
01:28:26,849 --> 01:28:29,149
Remove the key.

876
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:33,313
Get the key,
do what I say!

877
01:28:34,773 --> 01:28:36,859
What?

878
01:28:38,902 --> 01:28:41,509
I think there will be
new elections.

879
01:28:41,544 --> 01:28:44,373
Come on, let the
artifices, ¡the key!

880
01:28:44,408 --> 01:28:47,202
¡Tomaso not move!
If you move, kill it.

881
01:28:47,911 --> 01:28:51,039
Come on, turn it
I tell you the key!

882
01:29:00,466 --> 01:29:03,218
¡Signal received!
Done!

883
01:29:03,469 --> 01:29:04,852
Come on.

884
01:29:04,887 --> 01:29:07,104
Pare, Gazmán,
not going anywhere.

885
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:09,266
A soldier goes to
the end of their mission.

886
01:29:09,301 --> 01:29:11,351
Even if that
it costs life.

887
01:29:11,386 --> 01:29:13,277
That is called honor.

888
01:29:13,312 --> 01:29:16,440
It is a notion that it is
strange in their neighborhoods, right?

889
01:29:18,233 --> 01:29:22,946
Yes, it is true, we prefer
another concept: the family.

890
01:29:23,155 --> 01:29:25,240
Which unites us
between us.

891
01:29:25,275 --> 01:29:27,117
Which protects us.

892
01:29:27,367 --> 01:29:28,584
Which we believe.

893
01:29:28,619 --> 01:29:31,413
Yes, will be joining.
I am going to mourn.

894
01:29:32,122 --> 01:29:33,464
And die together.

895
01:29:33,499 --> 01:29:36,175
Come on, just fuck!
And you, where are you?

896
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:41,382
Calm down, I just a... go, was
surely there would be a snuff.

897
01:29:42,341 --> 01:29:43,550
Leave it.

898
01:29:45,219 --> 01:29:46,887
Tomaso ¡!

899
01:29:49,306 --> 01:29:51,850
For my collection.

900
01:30:12,287 --> 01:30:15,082
This is a good wallpaper,
Sir.

901
01:30:15,582 --> 01:30:17,126
A gift.

902
01:30:21,171 --> 01:30:22,840
Gentlemen.

903
01:30:25,217 --> 01:30:27,302
Miss, excuse me.

904
01:30:28,095 --> 01:30:31,640
I do not know what to say.

905
01:30:33,267 --> 01:30:35,728
Thank you, thank you very much.

906
01:30:37,688 --> 01:30:40,114
I owe much.

907
01:30:40,149 --> 01:30:43,402
I think the whole france
owes much.

908
01:30:45,195 --> 01:30:48,741
Well, I guess you do not believe
much to the politicians but...

909
01:30:49,324 --> 01:30:52,376
I assure you that...
the next 48 hours...

910
01:30:52,411 --> 01:30:55,539
...I will do whatever it can to
unlock the previous laws...

911
01:30:56,415 --> 01:30:58,424
...for your sector
back to...

912
01:30:58,459 --> 01:31:02,379
...all his dignity and a place
prominent in our society.

913
01:31:05,257 --> 01:31:06,925
Thank you.

914
01:31:07,217 --> 01:31:10,512
- I have a question, Mr. President.
- Tell me.

915
01:31:11,263 --> 01:31:14,433
Instead of spending a fortune
hiding the rotten...

916
01:31:14,468 --> 01:31:16,643
...Why not
start again?

917
01:31:16,678 --> 01:31:18,704
What do you mean?

918
01:31:18,739 --> 01:31:20,731
A real neighborhood.

919
01:31:20,766 --> 01:31:22,364
A real city.

920
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:24,902
With green
and places to work.

921
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,327
I agree.

922
01:31:27,362 --> 01:31:32,326
Damian, appointed him responsible
this project through to implementation.

923
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:36,997
Well, Mr. President.

924
01:31:37,790 --> 01:31:41,168
You have my word, and
as the word of my government.

925
01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:43,712
And the word of man?

926
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:46,632
And my word of man.

927
01:31:48,008 --> 01:31:49,676
Sir?

928
01:31:50,302 --> 01:31:53,472
- It's OK for me.
- Me too.

929
01:31:53,847 --> 01:31:55,286
Too.

930
01:31:55,321 --> 01:31:56,398
Clear.

931
01:31:56,433 --> 01:31:57,476
Yes

932
01:31:59,645 --> 01:32:01,146
Well.

933
01:33:17,806 --> 01:33:20,768
Well, that's better
que las mías.

934
01:33:26,690 --> 01:33:29,651
Everything is for the better.

935
01:33:31,487 --> 01:33:37,034
