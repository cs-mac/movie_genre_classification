1
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,247
I was born in Berlin, Germany.

2
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,784
My father and mother had
a fur business in Germany.

3
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:36,754
And I have a brother
who was a year younger.

4
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:42,368
We lived very comfortable,
had a nice life in Germany.

5
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:46,337
I remembered that huge,
beautiful building...

6
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,636
with gardens all around
and a stream going through it.

7
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:53,940
I lived there with my grandmother.

8
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:59,442
I went to a Jewish school-
a private school.

9
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,020
Had a nice girlfriend there,
Anna-Marie...

10
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:06,058
whom I was very friendly with,
and we spent a lot of time together.

11
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,390
My sister went to another school.
She was older.

12
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:13,262
I had my dolls.
My mother made clothes for my dolls.

13
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:17,166
My father was a peddler in Germany
which meant basically...

14
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,171
he would go to a place
and buy textiles...

15
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,468
cut in three-yard length.

16
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:26,011
Then he’d go into villages
and sell them door-to-door.

17
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:29,548
Usually when my father would return,
if it was a successful trip...

18
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,449
he brought back toys from the various
villages, and that was exciting.

19
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:38,490
We used to go to the suburbs
of Breslau on picnics.

20
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:43,424
In the winter
we went to Czechoslovakia...

21
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,555
to a place called Spindleruv Mlyn...

22
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:51,135
where my parents went skiing
and I went sleigh riding.

23
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:54,764
Jews in Germany felt at home
and felt it was their vaterland...

24
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:59,277
where they could live forever, and
they felt at home with German culture.

25
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,506
They felt proud of
Germany's achievement...

26
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:04,174
and of Jewish contributions to Germany.

27
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:08,380
While on the one hand German Jews-
especially when Hitler rose-

28
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:13,152
started writing a spate of books
called Jewish Contributions to Germany...

29
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,057
Jewish Contributions to Civilizations-

30
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:19,962
were not aware of the fact that the
Germans looked at it quite differently.

31
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,794
Instead of saying,
look how much we contributed to law...

32
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:26,235
to journalism-
created a whole new genre-

33
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:29,638
to medicine and science...

34
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:32,176
the Germans said,
"You took over our science.

35
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:36,442
You took over our law.
You took over the newspapers. "

36
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:43,687
In 1933, Adolf Hitler and
the Nazi party rose to power in Germany.

37
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:49,790
They immediately acted on their ideology
of racial discrimination and violence.

38
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,691
I came home from school...

39
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,134
and the Nazi party
was marching on the street...

40
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,173
and everybody's standing
on the side and saluting.

41
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,569
Suddenly they said-

42
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,776
That means "Hit the Jews. " They grabbed
a few people and started beating them.

43
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,372
They were yelling,
"We are no Jews. We are no Jews. "

44
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:14,681
They kept on beating them
for the cameras that were set up.

45
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:18,723
Till one day,
in the usual ice cream parlor...

46
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,816
we couldn't go in anymore...

47
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,691
and we were just beginning
to learn how to read.

48
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,787
That's when
the signs came up all over.

49
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:29,629
"No Jews, no dogs" in the stores.
"No Jews, no dogs" on the benches.

50
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,170
Couldn't quite understand
what this was all about...

51
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,935
but I remember my grandmother taking
us by the hand and says, "Haroldchen. "

52
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,875
That's how she used to call me.
"We can't go in here anymore.

53
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,240
We'll get ice cream some other place. "

54
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,646
Yeah, this "Jews and dogs forbidden"
was all over.

55
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,413
I had non-Jewish boys to play with...

56
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,683
and then sometime-
I don't remember what year it was-

57
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,920
none of my non-Jewish friends...

58
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,928
would play with me, talk to me-

59
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,021
just disregard me.

60
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:14,508
My next memory actually was of
our doorbell ringing at midnight.

61
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,773
I imagine it was shortly thereafter.

62
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:21,786
My parents wondering who's ringing
the doorbell at midnight.

63
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:25,016
It was my uncle,
my mother's brother.

64
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:29,458
He says, "I've got my chauffeur
waiting downstairs.

65
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:32,497
I'm on my way to France
via Switzerland...

66
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,192
because it's the end
for the Jews in Germany.

67
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,098
I think you should come with us. "

68
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:41,435
He had always been a bit of
an eccentric, this particular brother...

69
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:45,033
so, when my father heard it, he says,
"The meshuggener Leo.

70
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,271
What a crazy idea he has.

71
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,477
This madman's not gonna last. Things like
that have happened before to the Jews.

72
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,782
Impossible. Besides,
I fought in the First World War...

73
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:58,356
and we've been German for generations.

74
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,484
We've lived here.
Let's wait and see. "

75
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,256
In July, 1938...

76
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,424
President Roosevelt
convened the Évian Conference...

77
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,559
to try and solve
the refugee problem in Germany.

78
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,636
But the conference ended
with no solutions.

79
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,269
The refugees had nowhere to go.

80
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,308
Every country was told
at the Évian Conference...

81
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:27,284
that they do not have to take
more than their usual quota.

82
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:33,315
Britain won out in that Palestine
was not mentioned as a haven.

83
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,326
Goebbels writes in his diary...

84
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,419
"They are shedding crocodile tears.

85
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,794
They want us to do
their job for them...

86
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,697
and they really don't want the Jews
as much as we don't. "

87
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,896
So the Évian Conference
showed Hitler...

88
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,973
that the world didn't give a damn.

89
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,568
In 1938, a young Jewish man...

90
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,305
enraged at the treatment
of his parents by the Nazis...

91
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,281
shot and killed
a German diplomat in Paris.

92
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:03,011
The Nazis used the incident as a pretext
to orchestrate violent riots against Jews.

93
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,362
Thousands of shops were looted
and destroyed...

94
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,796
and virtually all synagogues
in Germany were burned.

95
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,833
Ninety-one Jews died,
hundreds wounded.

96
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,540
The police were told
not to interfere.

97
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,269
This night was called Kristallnacht.

98
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,811
"The Night of the Shattered Glass. "

99
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,745
When the ninth
of November came along...

100
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,908
and the Nazis wanted to
get into our house...

101
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:36,717
the Hausmeister, who was
a big Communist before 1933-

102
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,314
After 1933, of course,
he became a big Nazi.

103
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:42,519
He was standing in front of
the building in his uniform...

104
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,189
and saying, "There are no Jews
in this building. Keep on going. "

105
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,035
That saved us at that time.

106
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:55,836
My father put on the radio,
and all he heard was martial music.

107
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,967
He went out.
He wasn’t sure.

108
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,307
He didn't like to see
what was happening.

109
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,345
He decided to go into hiding.

110
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,480
When we got out the next few days...

111
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,486
I saw the glass...

112
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,122
and the burning synagogues
and all that.

113
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,990
We walked over to my grandmother's
house to see if they were all right.

114
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:20,132
I remember the crunching glass
under my feet.

115
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:24,226
Even now, more than 60 years later,
I can still remember it.

116
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:29,001
The day after Kristallnacht, my parents
and I walked out of our house...

117
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:33,238
and the grocery store near us,
which was owned by a Jewish family-

118
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,577
The windows were shattered
and had "Dirty Jew" on it.

119
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,116
Then we walked to the synagogue
which we attended...

120
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:42,085
and as we walked by we saw
in the courtyard of the synagogue...

121
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,088
there was a mound of ashes.

122
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,283
It was clear
that these were prayer books.

123
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:51,657
Sticking out of the center of the mound
were the scrolls of the Torah.

124
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:55,200
I remember being terrified by that...

125
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,633
because I had just learned...

126
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:01,002
that if the Torah was dropped
in the synagogue, even by accident...

127
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:04,907
the whole congregation
would have to fast for 40 days.

128
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,579
And here I saw the Torah
is being burned.

129
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,581
Internally I said to myself...

130
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,913
"There's no safety for us anywhere. "

131
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,886
All of a sudden...

132
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:20,516
almost all Germans sought a way out.

133
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,254
"Where can we go?
Where can we find a haven?

134
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,262
Where can we get out?"

135
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:29,391
Of course, the lines on
all the embassies and consulates...

136
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:33,871
were blocks long
with the attempts to find a haven.

137
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,840
The American consulate
closed their doors...

138
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,241
and no visas were ever
given out again.

139
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,007
You couldn't get into America.
You couldn't get to England.

140
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:46,483
You couldn't get to any of these places
because we had no passports, no visas.

141
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,884
The quota numbers were very small.

142
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,957
Among non-Jewish people
that lived in our house...

143
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:56,017
one of the men was a very high officer
in the German air force...

144
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:59,723
who warned my father
not to stay in Europe.

145
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:02,266
He says, "We are going to
conquer all of Europe. "

146
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:06,099
My father fortunately felt the same way.
He was a peddler...

147
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,571
and arranged with 11 other people...

148
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:12,804
to pay someone to get him across
the border to Belgium.

149
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,478
They did make it across the border...

150
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,742
and they were picked up
by the Belgian authorities...

151
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,047
who turned them back to the Gestapo
who turned them over to Dachau.

152
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:27,956
One of the ways in which the Austrian Jews
were encouraged to leave...

153
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,585
was to arrest the men...

154
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:33,631
and incarcerate them...

155
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,433
in concentration camps...

156
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:41,802
and then saying, "The only way
you're going to get your men back-"

157
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,843
To these women who were left behind,
the families that were left behind.

158
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:50,314
"The only way you can get them
is if you leave within a month...

159
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:55,046
24 hours, two weeks, two months,"
or whatever they decided.

160
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,783
My father decided
to come out of hiding.

161
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:02,383
It seems the Christian landlord
told him, "Don't. "

162
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,191
He went to the friend's house
to pick me up.

163
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,323
It so happened
the Gestapo was in the same house.

164
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:13,201
He got picked up, and he was sent
to the Buchenwald concentration camp.

165
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,273
I was picked up on the street...

166
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:18,969
taken with all other Jews
to Sachsenhausen.

167
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,445
We were standing there,
and the command came out...

168
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:26,040
"Anybody below 14 and over 80,
step forward. "

169
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:29,383
So, I was 13.
I stepped forward.

170
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,252
They put us on a truck,
and they sent us back home.

171
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,460
I spent one day.

172
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,426
So, all of a sudden,
there developed-

173
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,759
first in Vienna-

174
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,665
a haven that nobody
dreamed of before.

175
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:48,672
There's a place you can go to
without a visa, without papers.

176
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,674
It was extraordinary.

177
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,404
How could there be such a thing?
It was hard to imagine.

178
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,242
Where are you going?
8,000 miles away.

179
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:04,880
Shanghai...

180
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,118
a sprawling port city
on the east coast of China...

181
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,253
was forced by the British
to trade with the West...

182
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:14,389
after the Opium Wars
of the 1840s.

183
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,761
Powerful and decadent...

184
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,067
tremendously wealthy
and miserably squalid...

185
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,235
voracious and corrupt...

186
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,871
it became
the commercial center of China.

187
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,615
To sustain their booming trade...

188
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:34,516
the West created a section
of the city where Western law ruled.

189
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,517
It was called
the International Settlement.

190
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:43,793
Later on, the French created their own
settlement called the French Concession.

191
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,523
The International Settlement...

192
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:51,330
had grown up,
since mid-19th century...

193
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,065
outside of the walled town
of Shanghai.

194
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,006
Shanghai was a town
with walls around it...

195
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,806
and the International Settlement
grew up outside of it.

196
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,609
They built up those ports.
They built up all of them-

197
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,742
not only Shanghai,
but that was the biggest one-

198
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,821
into a major world harbor...

199
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:14,325
where the settlement created
a tremendous boom.

200
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:19,729
There were two Jewish communities
in Shanghai.

201
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:23,996
The first group came following
the British during the late 19th century.

202
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:27,129
They were Baghdadi businessmen
and their families.

203
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:32,370
As British subjects, they were able to
take part in the booming Shanghai trade.

204
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,375
They were English-speaking.

205
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,981
They did business with the British.

206
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,314
They did very well
by doing business with the British.

207
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,015
Some of them
were enormously wealthy...

208
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,092
like the Kadoorie...

209
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,524
the Sassoon...

210
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,822
and the Hardoon families.

211
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:55,822
The second community
consisted of Russian Jews...

212
00:13:55,935 --> 00:14:01,134
who immigrated to China mostly to escape
the Communist revolution in 1917.

213
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:05,133
Although not as affluent
as the Baghdadi Jews...

214
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,644
they also had a rich community life.

215
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,144
The Russian Jewish community
which existed- the second one-

216
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:15,513
grew up parallel
but not identical...

217
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,689
or mixed with the Sephardim.

218
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,851
They were separate and unequal.

219
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,467
In 1937..

220
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,797
began the war to attack
the Chinese garrisons...

221
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,466
in the outskirts of China.

222
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,904
From that time began
the Sino-Japanese War.

223
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,743
In the Sino-Japanese War of 1937..

224
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,979
the Japanese conquered
large parts of China...

225
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,419
including Shanghai.

226
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,787
As it turned out,
that was the only avenue of escape-

227
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,797
Shanghai- without papers.

228
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,697
All you needed really
was passage on a ship.

229
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:06,703
What is not widely known, in '38,
before the beginning of the war...

230
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,296
you could get out of Dachau
if you could leave the country.

231
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,171
If he could have left the country...

232
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,472
he wouldn't have gotten
smuggled into Belgium.

233
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,548
So, he was in Dachau for about 20 days.

234
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,549
During that time
my mother found out...

235
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:22,280
that you could go to the Japanese-occupied
portion of Shanghai without a visa.

236
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,551
One did not need a visa
to come to Shanghai.

237
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:29,253
But that is wrong.
Because visas were indeed required...

238
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,852
in order to purchase a ship ticket.

239
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:36,266
Passport control, however...

240
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,529
after July, 1937...

241
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,832
was no longer in Chinese hands.

242
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,841
As a matter of fact,
nobody controlled passports...

243
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:48,937
because the foreign powers
did not want to control passports...

244
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:52,779
because then the Japanese would have
said, "We want to control passports"...

245
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,853
and the foreign powers...

246
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,151
did not want the Japanese
to control passports of foreigners...

247
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,282
and therefore
nobody controlled passports.

248
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:05,830
She decided to buy
steamship tickets for Shanghai.

249
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:09,433
How did she have the money?
It wasn't that easy either.

250
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,902
We had money,
but the bank accounts were frozen.

251
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:18,272
However, we were allowed to draw
household expenses from our own moneys.

252
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:23,405
So my mother inflated, as much as
she was able to, what she needed...

253
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,983
and was very frugal on spending it.

254
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,145
But she did go
and get the steamship tickets...

255
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:32,018
for leaving on the Hakozaki Maru...

256
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,251
a Japanese steamer...

257
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,158
the following February
from Naples, Italy.

258
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:41,297
My father was always
very careful with money.

259
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,300
He had money put aside.

260
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,199
Most of that went for...

261
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:50,037
bribing the NYK Line people
to give us tickets...

262
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,770
because if we hadn't
gotten out by the middle of May...

263
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,641
I wouldn't be sitting here today.

264
00:16:55,014 --> 00:17:00,577
I remember my grandfather- It's one
of those things that sits in your ear-

265
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,678
You hear it.
He used to say to her, "Fuffchen. "

266
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:07,054
He called her Fuffchen.

267
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:11,687
"Where you taking the kid to?"
"To the Chinesin. "

268
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,731
"No, no. Forget it. "

269
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,528
He said, "Yeah.
I'm taking my boy. I'm getting out. "

270
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:22,071
On my mother's birthday, which was
December 5, 6:00 in the morning...

271
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,402
the bell rang...

272
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,613
and at that time
if you heard a bell ring at any hour...

273
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,776
but particularly at an ungodly hour,
you might say...

274
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,613
it did not sound too good.

275
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:41,182
I remember all of us huddling
in the little hallway...

276
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,330
as my mother opened the door,
and there was my father.

277
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,456
He had come home from Buchenwald.

278
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,433
With much trepidation,
she told my father...

279
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,300
"We're not waiting for
a United States visa.

280
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,532
I got tickets to go to Shanghai. "

281
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,766
She expected him
to make a big fuss...

282
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,402
and all he said was...

283
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,606
in today's vernacular...

284
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,445
"If we had left yesterday,
it wouldn't be soon enough. "

285
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:11,046
We left Germany in...
1939 in May.

286
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,888
We said good-bye to my grandparents.

287
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,893
It was chaos.

288
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,020
My mother was screaming.
My aunt was screaming.

289
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,065
They were very volatile.

290
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,634
It was terrible. Awful.

291
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,706
And, you know, the Germans
never came out to say good-bye.

292
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,472
They watched from
behind the curtains.

293
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,910
We could see them,
and they didn't come out.

294
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:39,347
They knew my mother
since she was a little girl.

295
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:44,145
They didn't come out. They didn't say
anything. They were really terrified...

296
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,817
and also probably glad
to see us leave.

297
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,793
At the train station
there was the whole family there.

298
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,228
I see it like you’re sitting
in front of me.

299
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,991
I see it like
you're sitting in front of me.

300
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,262
Under Anhalter Bahnhofin Berlin.

301
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,164
Everybody.

302
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,762
Everybody. Bruno.

303
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,469
Omi-Sozia, Ada, Mietek.

304
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,443
The cousins-Judith, Margot.

305
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,844
All names today are-

306
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,715
It's a long time ago.
But a lot of people.

307
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,821
A lot of people.

308
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,788
And they're all gone.

309
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,953
I had to say good-bye to Anna-Marie,
my girlfriend...

310
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,964
and all of that.

311
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:30,159
I give talks in schools...

312
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:34,064
and I talk about Anna-Marie,
especially to the age group that-

313
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,334
the nine-year-olds,
the 10-year-olds.

314
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,076
I always talk about
Anna-Marie and say...

315
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,875
"If you ever hear about anyone
called Anna-Marie Wallenberg...

316
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:44,881
let me know. "

317
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,609
I get letters from them.

318
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,779
One little girl wrote
a letter back, and she said...

319
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,823
"Don't worry
if you don't find Anna-Marie.

320
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,257
When you go to heaven,
you'll find her there. "

321
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:00,520
When the train reached
the Italian border...

322
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,895
and the Gestapo came
on board the train...

323
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,598
and my mother telling me...

324
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:12,040
"I want you to be very quiet.
Don't say a word.

325
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:16,547
Don't look up. Don't move.
Don't ask for anything.

326
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,115
Just sit. "

327
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:24,215
Funny how kids sometimes know
that it's really serious business.

328
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,918
I was eight years old,
and I did just that.

329
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:33,589
So I remember the Gestapo coming
aboard the train to check papers...

330
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,532
but I didn't see faces
'cause I was looking down.

331
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,569
My mother told me
not to look up.

332
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,128
All I saw was black boots
marching back and forth...

333
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,971
and them saying "Papiere, "
you know, "papers. "

334
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:49,374
The passports and whatever else
was needed- the permission.

335
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,982
They went through the whole train...

336
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,917
and after they got it from everybody,
they left the train...

337
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,150
and the train started again
and crossed the border into Italy.

338
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,390
Everybody cheering and clapping.

339
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:09,433
They had champagne corks popping.
We were out of Germany.

340
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,262
Shanghai became a real option...

341
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,773
for those Jews who had no place to go.

342
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:22,311
They scrambled to buy
all the luxury ship tickets...

343
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,507
to go to Shanghai...

344
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,176
because that was the only way
you can go at that point.

345
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,084
Got on the ship.
That was the Kashima Maru.

346
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,719
It was weird because
it looked like a pleasure cruise...

347
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,658
with the streamers
and the music-

348
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:40,459
the orchestra-
a Japanese real snappy orchestra.

349
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,863
We thought we were on holiday,
my sister and me.

350
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,868
I was nine, and she was 11.

351
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,668
So we had fun. We had a stewardess
who was assigned to take care of us...

352
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,835
and they gave us little cakes
and little dolls.

353
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,379
We had tea parties.

354
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:01,512
We took a ship in Naples- a Japanese
ship by the name of Hakusan Maru.

355
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,745
It was a beautiful four-week trip.

356
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,687
Long, beautiful trip.
I enjoyed every moment of it.

357
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:11,354
I didn't realize really what was going on
in the world. We were too young for that.

358
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:14,489
My mother bought first-class passage.

359
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,327
So we had a relatively luxurious cabin...

360
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,200
and there was more food
than anyone could ever eat.

361
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:23,240
I remember vividly
throughout the trip...

362
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,038
my mother kept saying
I should eat everything in sight.

363
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:29,443
At that time we were kosher.
We basically ate the fruits...

364
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:33,040
and the vegetables
and much of the pastry.

365
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,419
In Port Said,
the ship actually anchored...

366
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:40,514
and I remember
those sand dunes on both sides.

367
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:46,525
They later told us
that a few young Jews-

368
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,927
German Jews, Polish Jews-
jumped the ship...

369
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,333
and actually tried
to make their way to Palestine.

370
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,337
What's Israel today.
I don't know.

371
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:58,500
There was a recurrent theme.
She was saying, "Eat, eat, eat"...

372
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,306
because who knows what will happen
when we get to Shanghai.

373
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,457
Got off the ship in Shanghai...

374
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,618
if I remember correctly...

375
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,430
that was the shock of a lifetime.

376
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:25,227
It was completely different
from anything you could imagine.

377
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:26,827
Absolutely different.

378
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:29,805
Nothing could prepare you
for what we saw there.

379
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,234
I actually remember feeling
very, very afraid.

380
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,313
I didn't know where I was.

381
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,380
I t was a whole different world...

382
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,780
in overnight from white to black
or from black to white.

383
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,683
In 1937, what was conquered
was not the International Settlement...

384
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,692
not the French Concession...

385
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,762
but the Chinese portion of the town.

386
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:55,559
The Japanese did not want to establish
a concession of their own...

387
00:23:55,667 --> 00:24:00,502
but they took a piece
of the International Settlement...

388
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:04,132
and that they said is under
our military control.

389
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:05,709
And that is Hongko.

390
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,204
Hongko- or Hongke was some called it-

391
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,383
was one of the poorest sections
of Shanghai.

392
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,745
Badly battered in the war
with the Japanese...

393
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:18,118
it was home to poor Chinese...

394
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:22,182
occupying Japanese
and many Jewish refugees...

395
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,421
who had little means
to support themselves.

396
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:29,193
We landed in Hongkew, which is
the place where all the ships landed-

397
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,531
particularly the refugee ships.

398
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,695
It was very dirty.

399
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,603
It was terribly hot
and very humid.

400
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,642
The heat is terrible there.

401
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:41,810
And crowded and smelly.

402
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:48,384
Thousands of people running around.
Chinese beggars with open sores.

403
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,045
It was just awful.

404
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:55,092
Shanghai was not prepared
for this kind of an influx-

405
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,093
for these waves and waves...

406
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:01,256
shiploads-
shipload after shipload.

407
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:07,336
One of my father's friends
who had gone there before us...

408
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,339
had rented us a room...

409
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,899
in one of the little lanes
that they have in Hongkew.

410
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,081
The room was fairly clean...

411
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,617
but it was just
one small room for our family...

412
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,914
another small one
for my uncle and my aunt.

413
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,656
No kitchen facilities.

414
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,485
very poor bathroom situation.

415
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:33,223
No what they called WC's
over there- water closet.

416
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,299
No flush toilets.

417
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,524
Buckets.

418
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,934
The first home
was also on Wayside Road.

419
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:44,634
Further down on Wayside Road
in a lane in an alley.

420
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,703
All of Shanghai was alleys and lanes.

421
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,575
Cars don't go through there. Bicycles.

422
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,352
With a wagon
you can pull through there.

423
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:58,286
Very narrow,
very crowded, very tight.

424
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,890
Not too much air.
Not too much light.

425
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,493
That's how people lived in those days.

426
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:08,791
So, a major problem arose already
in December at the very beginning:

427
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,664
How to support these people,
how to house these people...

428
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:16,502
how to feed these people
of already hundreds upon hundreds.

429
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,200
The Jewish Baghdadi families
stepped in to help.

430
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:24,946
They established soup kitchens
and temporary shelters called homes...

431
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,450
or Hei me in German.

432
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,781
We were picked up by
the Jewish Committee on trucks...

433
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,883
and they took us to a camp...

434
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:40,224
which was a converted school
and a Kinchow camp.

435
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:45,702
The camp was normal. We had a little
breakfast, a little lunch and no dinner.

436
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:49,467
We had to fend for ourselves.
We had a little money.

437
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:55,069
The first one to create what you call
the international committee-

438
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:59,244
or I CU-
was the COMA Committee...

439
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:02,377
which was subsidized by Sassoon.

440
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:04,580
victor Sassoon said...

441
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:07,749
that it was the cheapest place
in the world to support a refugee.

442
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:10,657
For five American cents
you could support a refugee.

443
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:15,631
But as more refugees were arriving
daily, more help was needed.

444
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:20,303
The JDC- the Joint Distribution
Committee- took action.

445
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,440
It was an overseeing organization
of Jewish-American communities...

446
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,976
uniting their philanthropic efforts.

447
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:31,242
The JDC was the main source
of hope and help for the refugees.

448
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,384
It financed the temporary shelters...

449
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,512
the soup kitchens
and the makeshift hospital.

450
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:43,251
Later, Laura Margolis,
an American professional social worker...

451
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:47,092
became the JDC's
head official in Shanghai.

452
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,132
Under her effective management...

453
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:54,001
the JDC was able to sustain
close to 10,000 refugees...

454
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,539
who had no means
to support themselves.

455
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,109
One morning...

456
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,647
the phone rang.

457
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:07,274
The boss at that time was Mo Levitt.

458
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,486
Moses Levitt.

459
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:14,890
He said, "Laura, how you doin'?"

460
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:18,952
Although "How you doin'?"
was not an expression in those years.

461
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,832
But he said, "How are you?"

462
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,068
I said, "Fine. "

463
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,562
"Busy?"
"Yeah, we’re very busy here. "

464
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,736
He said,
"How would you like to go to China?"

465
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,607
I have to laugh
when I think of it.

466
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,150
I said, "Where in China?"
"Shanghai. "

467
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,815
I said, "Sure. I'd like to go. "

468
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,290
I had no idea
what he was talking about.

469
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:55,264
She came in May, 1941.
She was a professional social worker...

470
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:58,392
who had worked in Cuba before that.

471
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:01,301
I found a news clipping
in the Joint archives...

472
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,772
describing "Laura Margolis from Cuba...

473
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,537
is coming to straighten out
the mess in Shanghai. "

474
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,874
Because you had
the local relief organizations...

475
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,447
by volunteers.

476
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,483
Laura Margolis,
a highly intelligent woman...

477
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:18,750
sent back weekly-
sometimes even daily reports...

478
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:22,452
describing precisely
the situation as she saw it.

479
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,394
The relief organizations
and how poorly they're managing...

480
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,234
and the refugee problem
and so on and so forth.

481
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:34,101
Now came the Polish Jews...

482
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:39,006
and the Lithuanian Jews
and the religious Jews and the yeshivot.

483
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:45,316
They wanted to be
taken care of separately...

484
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:48,874
because they were intellectuals...

485
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,683
and they had to have
their prayer books...

486
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,850
and they had to have
kosher food...

487
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,919
and chicken on Friday.

488
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:02,859
It was very, very difficult.

489
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,434
Very difficult.

490
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:10,372
Yet again, the Jewish communities
did try to accommodate them...

491
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,636
did respond.

492
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:16,370
"These are religious people.
They need to be treated differently. "

493
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:20,247
So we went to the camp kitchens...

494
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:23,684
for our first meals
like everybody else did.

495
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,055
They had set up
these homes- Heime-

496
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,828
which didn't look
much like Heim- or a home-

497
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,865
for people who had no place to go.

498
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:39,596
They had kitchens,
and they had a hospital.

499
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,006
Fortunately,
we didn't have to live there.

500
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,837
That was even worse
than living in the room- much worse.

501
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:48,003
It was kind of odd to see people there.

502
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:51,513
They all had these new German clothes
they had bought before they left...

503
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,516
if they had enough money left.

504
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:57,611
They were all decked out.
The men usually with hats and suits.

505
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,280
In that heat.

506
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:04,485
The women with nice suits
and heels and all that...

507
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:09,397
with a tin plate in their hand, waiting
for food from the communal kitchen.

508
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,100
The summers would get so hot...

509
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:17,834
that today you use a heat index
or humidity index.

510
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:22,345
Under those conditions,
the temperature could go up as much-

511
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:26,042
measured that way-
140 in the shade.

512
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:31,952
The sanitary conditions were about the
worst in the world that you can think of.

513
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,191
Every disease-

514
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,924
known or unknown to man-
was rampant in epidemic proportions.

515
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,498
Non-flushable toilet.

516
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:46,659
A Chinese woman would come
every morning...

517
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,762
pick that huge pot up...

518
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:52,570
take it down the stairs
and dump it into a wagon in the street.

519
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:57,080
So the street usually smelled
not like Chanel Number 5.

520
00:31:57,882 --> 00:31:59,782
You could not drink the water.

521
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:02,910
In Shanghai, at the time,
you could not drink.

522
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:07,219
You drank water, guaranteed to get sick.
The older generation.

523
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,589
But when you were young,
you do things.

524
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:13,687
I remember distinctly the first time
I drank the water from the tap.

525
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:15,732
You had to boil the water.

526
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,199
Eventually we were able-
most of the younger people-

527
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,134
to drink the water from the tap.

528
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,798
There was a way to do the rice
that I remembered...

529
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:25,034
and I usually tell that to people-

530
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,976
how my mother used to
put it out on the windowsill.

531
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,910
We had these wide windowsills.

532
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:32,482
If you left it sitting there
for four or five minutes...

533
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,517
the bugs would come crawling out.

534
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:38,655
My sister and I would count
who had the most.

535
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,358
In summertime...

536
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:46,429
the river would overflow
on a regular basis.

537
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:49,989
Everyday, at certain hours,
the streets were flooded.

538
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,566
You'd have swimming in there.

539
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,639
You name it,
and it was swimming in there.

540
00:32:55,807 --> 00:33:00,506
Most of the refugees
came almost penniless to Shanghai.

541
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,410
The German government had confiscated
most of their assets.

542
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:08,208
Many sold whatever
salable items they had-

543
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,843
clothes and furniture...

544
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:13,617
which they brought from Europe
in large crates called "lifts. "

545
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:19,329
The refugees now scrambled to find jobs
in Shanghai to sustain themselves...

546
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,866
although they did not know
for how long.

547
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:28,200
My father had studied to be a typewriter
mechanic before leaving Germany.

548
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:32,299
Also with the proceeds
of what my mother sold...

549
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:37,438
we established a typewriter business
in the British foreign settlement...

550
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,607
hiring a Chinese mechanic.

551
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:43,175
My mother stayed home.
She and my aunt knitted.

552
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:47,722
They opened up the old sweaters
and the old shawls...

553
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:51,090
and knitted for sale
to make a little money.

554
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:56,929
My father and my uncle went to
look for jobs in the city of Shanghai...

555
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,935
with Chinese companies.

556
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,870
My father got a job
with a chemical company...

557
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:06,273
knowing absolutely nothing- not a shred
of knowledge about chemicals.

558
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,845
But he learned.
He used to study every night.

559
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:12,712
She supported
her husband and myself...

560
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,251
with making hats.

561
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,344
She was an excellent hat maker.

562
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,023
Since the climate was cold,
people wore hats.

563
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,026
The hope was always...

564
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,256
create a temporary refuge
so they can get to America...

565
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,299
or elsewhere
in the western hemisphere-

566
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,300
Canada, South America.

567
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:35,566
Nobody expected Shanghai
to be a refuge for 10 years.

568
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:39,871
It was unintended to be
more than anything temporary.

569
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:43,435
As bad as were offin Shanghai...

570
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:48,576
we were still better off
than most of the Chinese around us.

571
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:52,087
The Chinese were very poor,
very hardworking...

572
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:56,422
and were under direct oppression
of the Japanese.

573
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:59,894
The poorer Chinese people...

574
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,589
lived even...

575
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:07,662
a poorer life
than the Jewish refugees, it seemed.

576
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:12,436
The relief organization
helped the refugees-

577
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:15,740
the Jewish refugees-
according to their standard.

578
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:20,606
The Chinese had this coexistence
with the refugees-

579
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,152
a sort of benign tolerance.

580
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:25,245
They had their own problems.

581
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,916
They kind of accepted us
in their midst there.

582
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:32,724
I never once
saw a sign of anti-Semitism...

583
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:37,959
or disgust or criticism.

584
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:41,004
I never saw it at all.

585
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,071
The lot of the Chinese people
was a very hard one to watch...

586
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,904
beginning with the coolies-

587
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:54,144
these poor guys
who were carrying all daylong...

588
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,152
and then the rickshaws.

589
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:02,119
A human being lugging
a little wagon with two wheels...

590
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:06,390
and rich people and running with them
through the streets for hours and days...

591
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,498
with the veins
popping out of their legs.

592
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,067
It's inhuman.

593
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:17,234
The wintertime,
there was no heating...

594
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,042
and some just froze to death.

595
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:23,375
Then you'd see
in the streets in the morning...

596
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,473
little packages wrapped up
where the children passed away...

597
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:29,747
and they wrapped them up
in a little straw mattress...

598
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,721
and when the garbage truck came,
they just picked them up.

599
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,487
Children play with other children.

600
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,530
It doesn't matter whether-

601
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,599
My sister writes in her diary...

602
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,693
"I gave the little Chinese girl next door
a piece of white bread. "

603
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,637
Big deal, you know.
That's the way this worked.

604
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,901
Her father gave me a pencil.

605
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:57,146
That's how these things evolved.

606
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:59,375
They didn't make
lifelong friendships out of this...

607
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:02,043
but they coexisted quite well.

608
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,053
So there was never-

609
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:08,091
We were lucky with that. After all,
we were sitting on their territory...

610
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,387
20,000 of us
Pushing 20,000 of them out...

611
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:13,395
because they were already there...

612
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:18,166
and overflowing,
living really in poverty, many of them.

613
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,737
Because that was
the poor section of town.

614
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:29,377
On the one hand, the white and the Chinese
were simply two different worlds.

615
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:33,639
very few understood Chinese
or spoke Chinese.

616
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,881
What refugees had a lot to do
with Chinese was in pidgin English.

617
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,480
They bought from them.
They bought the cheapest-

618
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,525
the last bit of vegetables...

619
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:45,221
and what was left in the stands
when nobody else would buy...

620
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,320
when they couldn't afford
anything else.

621
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,025
Sometimes the Chinese
were very good to the refugees.

622
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:53,570
They gave them credit,
or they let them buy on credit.

623
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,935
There was this
very sweet Chinese man...

624
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,033
who came with his bamboo stick with two
little baskets hanging on each side...

625
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,806
and became a real friendship
with my mother.

626
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:08,007
Used to come by-
I don't know about everyday-

627
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,282
but very often-
a good few times a week.

628
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,880
Then he'd be downstairs-
We lived on the second floor-

629
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:18,758
and he used to call, "Ufi. Ufi, "
and then my mother went down.

630
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,797
He had some vegetables...

631
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:23,867
or fish and some chicken.

632
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,960
He always had something
that she bought from him.

633
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:30,199
"Ufi. " She was his best customer.

634
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,333
In Shanghai...

635
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:36,038
there was a Russian newspaper...

636
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,081
for the Russian community.

637
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,441
And in this paper
there was a Yiddish page.

638
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:44,453
In that Yiddish page...

639
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:48,651
they recorded
their reaction to Shanghai.

640
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:54,595
It is the most beautiful,
heartwarming poetry that I've read.

641
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,667
I mean, it is just-

642
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,727
It's not self-pitying.

643
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:06,299
Some of the poems are sort of
reaching out to the Chinese population.

644
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:10,346
Like, "Oh, my God.

645
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,882
This is terrible
what is happening to you. "

646
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:16,077
This kind of sympathetic response.

647
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,917
So it comes straight from the heart.

648
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,890
Instead of saying, "Oy, poor me. "

649
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:25,018
You know,
" Gevalt! Who did this to me?"

650
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,592
They're saying,
"Oh, no. You poor Chinese. "

651
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,895
The utmost influence...

652
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:35,197
the Jews asserted...

653
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:39,640
on the Shanghai Chinese society...

654
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:46,945
was on music and on medicine.

655
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:51,420
The Chinese themselves, many of them
felt also sympathy for the Jews.

656
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,820
They're both being
oppressed by the Japanese.

657
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:57,359
The Chinese worse. When the Chinese
crossed a bridge they had to bow down...

658
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:00,692
and Japanese sometimes
stick 'em with a burning cigarette...

659
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,459
or jab them.

660
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,625
But the Chinese got
the better part of it.

661
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,635
They turned around and smiled.

662
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,397
And that killed the Japanese.

663
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:12,067
In other words, their smile-

664
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:15,577
In other words, they withstood
the torture and the embarrassment...

665
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,115
and said you-know-what to them
in that language.

666
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:22,845
That hurt the Japanese
more than anything else.

667
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:26,286
Every Chinese hated
the Japanese very much.

668
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:30,793
They killed 300,000 people...

669
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:33,622
when they occupied Nanjing.

670
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,097
I saw once...

671
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:41,601
a Chinese stealing
a canister of kerosene...

672
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,273
and he was caught.

673
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,469
Right on the spot
the Japanese tied up his hands...

674
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,478
and chopped them off.

675
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,911
And that's it.
I couldn’t watch.

676
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:54,985
I ran away.

677
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,212
But in my opinion,
man could never survive.

678
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:18,503
Although passport control was not
in anyone's hands after 1937...

679
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:21,811
the Japanese controlled
the Shanghai harbor.

680
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:25,345
In spite of their alliance
with Germany...

681
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:28,941
they let the Jewish refugees
into Shanghai.

682
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:35,522
I t is quite clear that they do not
wish to antagonize American Jews.

683
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,258
They do not wish
to antagonize world Jewry...

684
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:44,892
because this stereotype of the Jew,
which is still alive today in Japan...

685
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,902
was very much alive then.

686
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:50,132
Jews are rich,
Jews have power...

687
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:53,039
Jews control governments.

688
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:56,203
Jews are compared
to a blowfish or fugu.

689
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:59,146
If the skilled chef...

690
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:04,711
can know how to cut the little poisonous
sac out of the fish, it's a delicacy.

691
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,722
If not, it's a poisonous thing.

692
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:09,691
If we have such a great power
like the Jews...

693
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:12,421
we have to know how to
utilize them on behalf of Japan.

694
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,294
Japanese had to be very careful...

695
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:18,300
about being prejudiced against Jews...

696
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:21,428
because they had complained...

697
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,599
about German prejudice against Asians.

698
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:28,745
So, it was the Japanese,
Hitler's Axis partner...

699
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:32,646
that determined, based on their concept
of what the Jew was in the world-

700
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,945
on their control of the West...

701
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,350
and Western Jews
being synonymous in their ideas-

702
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:42,892
they thought, "If we are good to the Jews
in East Asia, they will be good to us. "

703
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:48,557
Meanwhile, war was raging in Europe.

704
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:52,727
In September, 1939,
Germany invaded Poland.

705
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:55,031
In 1940, Denmark.

706
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,334
Then the Netherlands, Belgium...

707
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:58,669
then France.

708
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:02,641
It seemed like
Hitler was unstoppable.

709
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:08,879
The beginning looked like total
devastation- we don't have a chance.

710
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:10,920
The Germans were
running across Europe...

711
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:15,549
and the Japanese were
storming all across Asia.

712
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:19,493
Till things started turning around, we
didn't really know. It looked hopeless.

713
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:23,490
We got once a postcard
from my grandfather.

714
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:27,001
We tried in Shanghai...

715
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:31,040
to get some of
my mother's family out...

716
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,336
or my father's,
but it was too late.

717
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:37,642
You had to go via Siberia,
and as I said to you...

718
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:41,115
the war was on already,
and you could not come anymore.

719
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:46,281
My other uncle, though-
Leo who had gone to Paris-

720
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:52,526
when he saw that it wasn't
that great in France...

721
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,030
he wrote my mother
he’d like to come to Shanghai.

722
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,896
My mother immediately got things moving.

723
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:04,731
The European part of HIAS
was called HICEM. H-I-C-E-M.

724
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,742
She went to the HICEM...

725
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:11,013
in Shanghai...

726
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:13,583
and sent papers.

727
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:15,845
At that particular time...

728
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,919
you needed-
it wasn't really sponsors...

729
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:22,720
but you needed somebody to write a letter
to say you wanted somebody to come.

730
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:26,489
It was very easy.
It was a semiofficial kind of thing.

731
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,030
There was no problem.

732
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:31,101
We did the same thing.
The HICEM took care of it.

733
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:34,635
And we got another letter
from my uncle...

734
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:38,606
that he was now interned
at Septfonds.

735
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,007
"Please get me out
as quickly as you can. "

736
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:43,909
My mother couldn't understand.
Why didn't he get the papers?

737
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:48,474
She went to the HICEM,
and he assured her the papers were sent.

738
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:52,620
Well, nothing happened,
and finally my mother got very upset...

739
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:55,021
and she went back
to the HICEM, and she says...

740
00:44:55,125 --> 00:45:01,030
"You know, it doesn't take that long
for papers to get to Europe.

741
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,402
Something must have happened. "

742
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:08,335
The man said, "No. We sent them. "
"I want the receipt...

743
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:11,636
because you said you sent them
registered mail.

744
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:14,176
I want the receipt that you sent them. "

745
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:18,803
They weren’t very nice to her,
but she wouldn’t leave the office.

746
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,043
Finally he took out his file...

747
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:24,814
and the way she said,
his face blanched.

748
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:28,449
She said, "What's the matter?"
He said, "The papers were never sent.

749
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:32,424
They're in this file. "

750
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:34,429
So, my mother says...

751
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:37,932
"I'm gonna take the papers,
and I will send them. "

752
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:42,230
She took the papers, 'cause they had to
go to the HICEM in Marseille...

753
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,807
and they he could have
gotten on a ship.

754
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,409
She took the papers...

755
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:50,776
and she immediately sent them out,
registered mail.

756
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:55,583
They got to the HICEM in Marseille
the day France fell.

757
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:59,354
They never reached my uncle.

758
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,354
To the day she died...

759
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:07,021
my mother said, "Leo's gonna think
his sister deserted him...

760
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,258
that his sister
didn't want him to come. "

761
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,500
She always spoke about that-
how she sent him these papers.

762
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,969
They were overworked,
I guess- the HICEM.

763
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:21,943
She always says, "Why didn't I ask
to see the file earlier? Why, why?"

764
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:23,945
Because he could have come.

765
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:33,646
There were various schools
available in Shanghai...

766
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:36,487
including French and British schools.

767
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:39,889
There was also
the Kadoorie school in Hongkew.

768
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:44,832
It was built and financed by the Kadoorie
and Sassoon families for the refugees...

769
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:47,563
and was staffed by refugee teachers.

770
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:50,969
There was also an existing school:

771
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:53,201
the Shanghai Jewish School...

772
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,643
which was administered
by these two families...

773
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,442
the Sassoon and Kadoories.

774
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:01,518
It was a private school.
You had to pay tuition

775
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:05,120
If you could not pay tuition,
you went for free.

776
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:11,591
It was a school run
under the British school system.

777
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:14,789
The curriculum was
made up in Cambridge, England...

778
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:18,797
was sent to Shanghai,
meticulously followed.

779
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:22,303
Examination papers were sent back
to Cambridge for marking...

780
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:25,432
and then returned to Shanghai.

781
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:28,377
There were kosher lunches...

782
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:32,437
and there was a big, beautiful Sephardic
synagogue, still in existence today...

783
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:36,212
on the grounds of
the Shanghai Jewish School.

784
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:41,314
Had a very, very lovely
English lady...

785
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,624
in our Shanghai Jewish School-

786
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,064
Mrs. Beresford-

787
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:53,400
who every weekend...

788
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:56,004
would take from her class...

789
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:04,044
one kid to her house.

790
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,220
I remember I was there twice.

791
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,982
Her son was a boy
named Maxwell Beresford.

792
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:20,120
That was in downtown Shanghai.

793
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,491
They were beautiful-
beautiful woman, beautiful people-

794
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:29,470
and for two days
you lived again in a different world.

795
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,131
When we kids had nothing to do...

796
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,539
in the afternoon, after school...

797
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:38,240
we got active
and we had athletic competitions.

798
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:42,785
We had a soccer league,
where we played soccer every weekend.

799
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:45,184
There also was
a small boxing club...

800
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:48,588
because there were
some Jews from Germany-

801
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:52,651
Some of them were champion of Germany.

802
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,196
They had a little time
on their hands...

803
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,904
and they started to teach us
to be boxers.

804
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,766
We had a very good boxing league.

805
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:07,310
I was pretty good.
I was very good at boxing.

806
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:12,674
I had a very strong right.
I won most of my fights by knockout.

807
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:16,043
Now as a man of72 years old...

808
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,451
it doesn't look the same
and it doesn't feel the same...

809
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:22,787
but I was very strong
and I was very good.

810
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:26,488
So were others in our group.
They were really good.

811
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:29,622
We had good trainers
and we trained very hard.

812
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:32,497
We took enormous pride to win.

813
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:36,003
All of us wore the Magen David,
which was important.

814
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:41,337
When you're always on the bottom,
and everybody spits and laughs at you...

815
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:46,379
you are finally on even keel-
It was important.

816
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,644
Here you have a community...

817
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:52,119
that despite these disadvantages
that I mentioned to you...

818
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:55,453
created a viable cultural life...

819
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:59,325
that would have done justice
to a city of 100,000.

820
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:02,421
Newspapers,
dailies, weeklies, monthlies-

821
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:04,523
An incredible array of newspapers.

822
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:06,101
Of course one person bought it...

823
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:09,468
then gave it out
to 10 other people to read.

824
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,776
These were read and read
and reread until they were torn.

825
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:16,971
From Vienna, the sausages and bakery
and other things-

826
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:21,483
The café house, which was a standard
in Vienna and Germany...

827
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:23,485
they brought to Shanghai.

828
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:27,182
Architects created
a whole new area...

829
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:31,351
where the bombed-out part of Hongkew
had been rebuilt...

830
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:35,830
to create apartments,
rooms for refugees.

831
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:41,199
They created a theater, and this included
a German theater and a Yiddish theater.

832
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:48,768
They had cabaret evenings
in these little restaurants...

833
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,973
that were fabulous.
We would go there-

834
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:54,983
Once in a great while
my father would come out...

835
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:57,485
with enough money
for us to go to one of these places.

836
00:50:57,587 --> 00:51:01,421
We would go there, and we'd listen
to them sing and make jokes.

837
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:06,963
People like Herbert Zernik
and Raya Zomina- she sang in Yiddish.

838
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,659
These two were so funny,
and they were so good.

839
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:13,167
There was a lot of that going on.

840
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:21,043
You have this attempt...

841
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:23,942
to bring some kind of cultural life.

842
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:26,675
It's not only the café houses.

843
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:30,082
It's not only recreating Little Vienna
or Little Berlin...

844
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:31,745
as some people have written.

845
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:33,413
It is much more.

846
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:37,653
Several newspapers-
The Gelb Reports, Shanghai Chronicle-

847
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:43,492
Many more that stopped and started.
Even books.

848
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:47,398
Poetry. People were writing
wonderful poetry in German...

849
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,772
not only in Yiddish.

850
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:55,140
It is that kind of thing
which I think is moving.

851
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:59,238
Among the squalor,
the poverty, the hunger...

852
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:06,846
and this feeling of,
"What's going to be with us?

853
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,926
Where will all this end?
Will it ever end?"...

854
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:14,261
there still is the human spirit
reasserting itself.

855
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,764
The Jewish refugees built...

856
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:20,463
an almost self-sufficient,
beautiful society.

857
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,561
There's sports clubs,
there's soccer clubs...

858
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:24,936
there are recreation clubs,
there are boxers.

859
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:29,568
It's an amazing story.

860
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:36,413
My father had
come out of Buchenwald...

861
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,650
where his war wound had acted up
and had not been treated.

862
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:45,257
He got sick,
then he got well, then he got sick.

863
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:48,126
He got checkups.
They didn't know what it was.

864
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:51,166
They pulled his teeth,
they thought it was that.

865
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:54,135
He kept getting fevers,
and it was called "Shanghai Fever. "

866
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:58,037
But he functioned and ran the business
with a Chinese mechanic.

867
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:02,407
My mother went knocking on doors
getting customers.

868
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:07,776
She did the bookkeeping, she did
the correspondence and appointments.

869
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:11,479
My father did the repairs
together with a Chinese mechanic.

870
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:16,023
Then he got sick again...

871
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:20,586
and he died, just like that.
He was 43years old.

872
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,733
They were never sure what it was...

873
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:28,793
but they presume it was
some kind of a parasite...

874
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:31,533
that he harbored from Buchenwald.

875
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:34,576
When he fought
in the First World War...

876
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:38,341
he was at the Battle of Verdun
in France...

877
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:41,975
which was a very big,
important battle.

878
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:45,748
I think it was in 1916.
He was born in 1897...

879
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,255
so he was about 19 years old.
He was a kid, really.

880
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:54,252
As he was standing with his gun...

881
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:57,128
he sees a young French soldier...

882
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,532
on the other side of him,
opposite him.

883
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:04,501
That's the enemy...

884
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:07,475
so naturally you shoot your enemy
or he's gonna shoot you.

885
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:12,542
My father tells the story.
He sees this French soldier...

886
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:15,277
and he raises his gun to shoot him.

887
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:19,947
At the same moment
that he's shooting the soldier...

888
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:23,287
the soldier shoots him.

889
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:28,160
And as my father fell-
He had a stomach wound, lying there-

890
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:32,258
he heard the young French soldier
say, "Shema Israel. "

891
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,762
That always affected him.

892
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:38,602
He killed a Jew.

893
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:42,743
All of a sudden, he wasn’t a German
soldier killing a French soldier...

894
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:45,406
it was a Jew killing a Jew.

895
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,179
It affected him all his life.

896
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,348
It must have,
because he always told that story...

897
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,085
and then my mother repeated it.

898
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:02,024
Although the situation
in Shanghai was bad...

899
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:06,828
it was far better than Europe,
where war was still raging.

900
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:16,640
The refugees felt relatively safe
in Shanghai under Japanese occupation.

901
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:19,649
That was about to change.

902
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:27,121
In December, 1941...

903
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:31,057
Japan attacked
the American naval base at Pearl Harbor.

904
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:40,528
The United States entered the war.

905
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:49,673
Pearl Harbor
was not only a major shock...

906
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:54,876
which verified to some that the Gestapo
had a long arm...

907
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:59,011
and it reached out to the Far East.

908
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:00,589
It was a double shock.

909
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:05,593
Here they thought, "We have difficulties,
but we're out of danger from Germany. "

910
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:09,563
All of a sudden, with Pearl Harbor
they find Germany and Japan are allies...

911
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,635
and Germans again
are involved in their affairs.

912
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:14,704
We got very frightened.

913
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:18,262
With America at war,
we're not going to get out of Shanghai.

914
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,935
Looked out the window...

915
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,774
and all the ships in the harbor
were burning.

916
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,974
Japanese had come
across the bridge...

917
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:33,750
marched into our hotel,
occupied the hotel.

918
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:35,119
We were at war.

919
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:39,055
The Japanese quickly took over
the International Settlement.

920
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:44,259
The British and the Americans
were now enemies of Japan...

921
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:46,699
and were regarded as
prisoners of war.

922
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,294
The Japanese imprisoned them...

923
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,068
in internment camps
at the outskirts of Shanghai.

924
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:57,913
That group included the Baghdadi Jews
who were also British subjects.

925
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:01,544
The Sephardic community,
which had been helping the refugees...

926
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:06,315
was no longer in the elite position
that they were before.

927
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,890
They themselves were reduced...

928
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:10,289
as to how much money
they could take out of the bank.

929
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:11,860
Most of their money was confiscated.

930
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:16,090
Within three quarters of a year or so-

931
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,895
certainly by the end of the year-
all the enemy aliens-

932
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:24,235
meaning American, British and Dutch
nationals- were interned.

933
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:27,332
I remember when they locked
all the British up.

934
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:37,545
A few of our guys- I was with them-
knew where the camp was.

935
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:41,855
Long way to walk,
the way I remember it today.

936
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,691
We gathered whatever we could steal-

937
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,154
some cans, some this, some that.

938
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:51,859
We walked for kilometers,
the way I remember it.

939
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:55,670
We brought them some. They were
all locked up in the British camp.

940
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:03,912
We paid back.

941
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:07,005
With America at war with Japan...

942
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:11,815
all lines of communication between
Shanghai and the US were suddenly cut.

943
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:14,580
Laura Margolis was cut off...

944
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:18,127
without money coming from America
to support the soup kitchens...

945
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:21,629
the local shelters
and the makeshift hospital.

946
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:25,599
Foreseeing such a problem, she had already
obtained permission from the JDC...

947
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:28,170
to borrow money
from local businessmen...

948
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:31,206
who were confident that they would be
repaid by the JDC...

949
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:34,242
at the end of the war,
as indeed they were.

950
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:38,337
But without the Japanese
approving the operation...

951
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,848
everything could fall apart...

952
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:46,047
leaving thousands of refugees with
no means to support themselves.

953
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:48,487
So I phoned up Captain Inuzuka.

954
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,659
He remembered me...

955
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,957
because we had
been to social affairs together...

956
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:55,860
and received me very nicely.

957
00:58:55,965 --> 00:59:00,766
Made the tea ceremony, very nice,
very cordial.

958
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:06,031
Then we got to
the nitty-gritty of what I came for.

959
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,709
It's true that I'm an enemy alien.

960
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:12,808
I don't know what’s going to
happen with me next.

961
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:18,578
But for the foreseeable future,
apparently I'm free.

962
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:24,024
I would be able to take over
the whole operation in Shanghai...

963
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:27,657
and keep feeding the people...

964
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:31,256
if he would give me permission
to raise the money.

965
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,202
I said...

966
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:38,036
"You, as an occupying power...

967
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:42,704
can not afford
to have hungry people riot.

968
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:47,041
You're responsible for them.
On the other hand...

969
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:49,516
I can help you so they won't riot...

970
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:52,248
if you’ll give me an okay...

971
00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:56,291
to raise the money. "

972
00:59:58,294 --> 00:59:59,761
And he did.

973
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:02,761
The war years
were very difficult years...

974
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:06,028
in the sense that
there wasn't enough food...

975
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:10,567
and everybody had dysentery.

976
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,369
Having diarrhea was just usual.

977
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:19,146
Food got to be very difficult
in '43, '44, '45.

978
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:20,909
There wasn't a lot of food.

979
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:25,852
Lot of people were clearly
suffering from malnutrition.

980
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,946
You had a sense-
As a young kid, I remember...

981
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:30,491
the people were shrinking
into their clothes.

982
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:33,255
They looked gaunt and shabby.

983
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:36,730
Little Chinese boys
would be chasing grocery trucks.

984
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:39,301
They'd have a knife.
They'd cut a hole in the sack.

985
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:42,132
The noodles would fall
into the gutter.

986
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:45,571
They'd sweep them up,
and they would be sold very cheaply.

987
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:48,735
Then my mother and I
would sit around the kerosene lamp...

988
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:52,008
or whatever was available
in the way of light...

989
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:55,516
and we’d separate
the noodles from the debris.

990
01:00:55,618 --> 01:01:01,113
Debris being
broken glass, rusty nails, stones-

991
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:03,215
whatever is swept up from a gutter.

992
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,022
I remember we were sitting
on the balcony once-

993
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:10,225
Werner, my second father, and I-
Tiny little balcony.

994
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,496
My mother was in the streets.
She had just bought bread.

995
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:16,197
And we saw
some young kid came up...

996
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:18,637
grabbed the bread from her arm
and started running.

997
01:01:19,575 --> 01:01:23,671
When she came up, she said, "He must have
been even hungrier than we are. "

998
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,270
Those were-

999
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:28,216
There wasn't much of anything.

1000
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:32,777
Since the Baghdadi Jews were imprisoned
in internment camps with the British...

1001
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:38,055
Laura Margolis called upon
the Russian Jews to help the refugees.

1002
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:42,359
The responsibility
for the refugees...

1003
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:45,161
fell now on the Russian Jews.

1004
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:47,259
And I would say-

1005
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:50,829
They had no choice,
but we accept the responsibility.

1006
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,908
But also they did their best.

1007
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,476
They cannot be faulted.

1008
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:58,980
After that, they simply had to do
whatever was possible.

1009
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:04,275
My parents
and quite a few other people...

1010
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:07,185
had their kids go
to a Catholic school.

1011
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:12,455
Saint Francis Xavier's College-
SFX- which was an all-boys school.

1012
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,530
Discipline extremely strict.

1013
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:18,463
If I learned anything at all,
that's where I learned it.

1014
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:23,896
It was a Catholic school. All brothers,
with the long black gowns.

1015
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,606
Religious Catholics
from all over the world-

1016
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:29,371
Brother Leo,
Brother Ladislaus from Hungary.

1017
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:34,576
There was one big redhead,
Brother John.

1018
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:37,110
I'll never forget...

1019
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,279
every morning
when we walked into school...

1020
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,723
Brother John would give us...

1021
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:46,257
a little insight
into what the political situation was.

1022
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:49,727
He was very, very anti-Allies.

1023
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:54,030
He was very much pro-German
and pro-Japanese.

1024
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:58,301
He was a real nice guy. He was very nice,
especially to us Jewish kids...

1025
01:02:58,407 --> 01:02:59,874
and yet...

1026
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:05,147
his actions showed different and the words
that came out of his mouth were different.

1027
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:06,909
After the war was over...

1028
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:10,474
it came out that Brother John was actually
a very high officer in the British army.

1029
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:12,654
He was no brother.

1030
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:16,783
Not a religious man,
but set up in there.

1031
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:19,888
Apparently he was one of those...

1032
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:24,859
that gave a lot of information
of what was going on in Shanghai...

1033
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:28,900
as far as the Japanese army
was concerned, to the Allied forces.

1034
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:35,467
The refugee community was very worried
what was happening...

1035
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:41,448
because after all the enemy aliens
of Japan and Germany were interned...

1036
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:43,917
what was gonna happen to us?

1037
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,454
Knowing that Jews
were always first in line...

1038
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:50,492
when it came to bad things
happening to good people, so to speak...

1039
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:53,357
what did they have in store for us?

1040
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,155
On February 18, 1943...

1041
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,429
the Japanese issued a proclamation...

1042
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:05,235
ordering all stateless refugees
who came to Shanghai after 1937..

1043
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:08,941
to move to a segregated area
in Hongkew.

1044
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:15,515
That's when the German influence
became much more crucial.

1045
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:20,612
German influence pressured
the Japanese into creating a ghetto.

1046
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:25,217
This was the tendency of
the Japanese in ruling.

1047
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:30,789
Here this whole puppet-state concept
comes into play.

1048
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,165
If you have them nice and compact
all together...

1049
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:37,398
you can watch them
and you know what they're doing.

1050
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:39,474
Then what you do
is you give them...

1051
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:45,312
someone to watch over them.
No direct rule.

1052
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:49,407
That's the puppet government
that watches over them.

1053
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:52,385
It's exactly what they did
in Shanghai.

1054
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:55,286
It wasn't a real ghetto.

1055
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:59,521
It wasn't a ghetto that we know
from Europe. It wasn't that.

1056
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:03,895
It was a different concept.
It was a very Japanese concept.

1057
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,733
And yes, all foreigners
need to be watched.

1058
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:11,102
The ghetto didn't have
any walls around.

1059
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:13,402
It didn't have to...

1060
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:16,034
because if you saw a European face
in downtown Shanghai...

1061
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:18,739
and they were not German or Russian,
they had to be one of us...

1062
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:22,978
because all the Americans and all the
British were put into internment camps.

1063
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:26,411
So we moved into that ghetto area.

1064
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:30,925
My mother sold a bunch of the possessions
we had just to make room.

1065
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:35,830
We had a very tiny room.

1066
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,900
There were at the end-

1067
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,903
three, four, six-
ten people in this house.

1068
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:46,463
We lived in a Chinese house
owned by a Jew...

1069
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:49,135
but there were five families
in a ghetto...

1070
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:51,440
and we had the attic
which was like this.

1071
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:57,810
We were not able to stand straight,
only in the middle of the attic.

1072
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,218
On the side it went all the way down.

1073
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:05,420
The major problem we had was
my brother contracted polio in China...

1074
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:13,467
which was a disaster.

1075
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:17,163
Food was scarce.

1076
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:22,472
Eventually we couldn't get out
from the ghetto anymore...

1077
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:24,307
so I started a job.

1078
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:27,849
I worked in the kitchen.
The school had a kitchen.

1079
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:31,442
We all had to move into one room
to 51 Chusan Road...

1080
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:34,682
which was right smack
in the middle of the ghetto.

1081
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:37,486
They never called it a ghetto.
They called it a segregated area...

1082
01:06:37,593 --> 01:06:39,322
but it was a ghetto.

1083
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:43,024
I went back there too...

1084
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:45,430
and took a look.

1085
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:49,370
Yes.

1086
01:06:51,874 --> 01:06:53,967
- We lived upstairs, you know?
- There you go.

1087
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:55,543
Take care.

1088
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,777
- Be careful on the steps.
- Take care.

1089
01:06:59,882 --> 01:07:02,180
Yes, on the steps.

1090
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:05,412
It all comes back.
It all comes back.

1091
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:08,553
The roof looks the same.

1092
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:12,358
It's amazing how it didn't change.
I can't believe it.

1093
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,755
We used to have the rice
on this windowsill...

1094
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,389
and take the bugs out of the rice-

1095
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:19,968
my sister and me.

1096
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:22,899
There was another window
and we had a little kitchen...

1097
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:25,801
where there's now a wall here...

1098
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:31,310
with one little stove,
two rings of gas.

1099
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:33,814
We never used it
because we didn't have enough gas.

1100
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:38,884
And a little sink
with cold water running.

1101
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:41,389
We put a curtain across it...

1102
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:44,084
so that nobody
would come in when we washed ourselves.

1103
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:46,627
Never took a bath during the war,
just sponge bath...

1104
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:50,190
'cause the bathroom down the hall
was so dirty.

1105
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:52,199
Everything comes back.

1106
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:55,729
We did everything in this room.
We lived here...

1107
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:58,705
we slept here, we argued here.

1108
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:02,141
I learned to dance in this room
with my father...

1109
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:04,312
to the radio.

1110
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:08,608
Voice of America. We tried to get it,
but it was forbidden...

1111
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:10,844
so we had to be very careful.

1112
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:17,489
My mother always had flowers on the table.
You could buy flowers.

1113
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:21,225
All the time we were wondering
what happened in Germany.

1114
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:23,230
We didn't know
what was going on...

1115
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:26,100
all during the war.

1116
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:29,563
It's just amazing
how it all comes back.

1117
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:35,407
To exit the ghetto
for jobs or school...

1118
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:37,741
the refugees
had to get special passes.

1119
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:42,542
The Japanese authorities
were represented by two officials;

1120
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:45,319
Akura and Goya.

1121
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:51,092
Goya- They called him "Meshuggener Goya"
or "Paranoid Goya"-

1122
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:52,717
who had a-

1123
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:56,724
He was really schizophrenic
in many ways.

1124
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:59,960
I'm giving you
not a professional evaluation.

1125
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:03,800
He could be very good to the children.
He'd give out candies to children.

1126
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:06,602
He loved to play music,
even though he was a lousy musician.

1127
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:09,200
He always forced the refugees
to play with him.

1128
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:12,542
He liked to be called "King of the Jews. "
He was a short, ugly fellow.

1129
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:16,880
He would stand on the desk
and yell at some Jews.

1130
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,784
There was one Jew
who really caught his psychology.

1131
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:22,551
A brilliant idea.

1132
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:26,150
He saw the kind of person he was.

1133
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:30,096
He had a silk top hat he'd put on.
He gambled.

1134
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:31,962
He'd say, "You're making fun of me?"

1135
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:35,298
He wore a silk hat when
he went down the line to get a pass.

1136
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:37,304
He said, "No, I only wear it...

1137
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:41,343
when I meet royalty
and important people. "

1138
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:44,435
He caught onto
the psychology of that person...

1139
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:46,208
and he was always put
in front of the line.

1140
01:09:46,315 --> 01:09:49,284
Anytime he came,
he got his pass immediately.

1141
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:51,410
Mr. Goya was a very short,
little man...

1142
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:55,613
and my stepfather Werner
was a very tall man.

1143
01:09:57,626 --> 01:09:59,856
He was about 6 foot 2, 6 foot 3.

1144
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:03,428
The little Japanese man
didn't like that.

1145
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:07,834
So he pulled out his gloves...

1146
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:12,465
and he slapped my father
across the face.

1147
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:15,271
He jumped on the table
and slapped him across the face...

1148
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:19,380
and yelled at him to get out
and "no pass. "

1149
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:23,178
I remember
Werner coming home that day...

1150
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:26,618
and he was a shattered, broken man.

1151
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:30,719
So now
my mother's typewriter business...

1152
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:32,885
definitely was
down the drain altogether...

1153
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:37,091
because many refugees now
were not just dying of disease...

1154
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:40,134
they were dying of starvation, because
there was so little food around.

1155
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:44,104
And what she decided was a ruse.

1156
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:49,570
She wrote to one of her customers in
the French Concession, a French lady...

1157
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:51,441
and asked her to send a letter...

1158
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:54,880
saying that she was still
servicing her typewriter.

1159
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:57,976
The lady wrote that letter.
Armed with that letter...

1160
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:01,284
she made an application
for a special pass with Mr. Goya.

1161
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:05,292
She stood in front of Goya,
and Goya said, "You repair typewriters?"

1162
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:07,259
She says, "Yes, I was in business.

1163
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:10,457
My husband died here,
but it was his business originally.

1164
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:12,761
I still know how to repair them. "

1165
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:16,429
She got a pass,
and armed with that pass...

1166
01:11:16,538 --> 01:11:19,507
she decided what she was gonna do.

1167
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:23,135
She had no intention of
servicing typewriters.

1168
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:25,839
She got a pass
to go to the French Concession.

1169
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,314
What she did that was not legal...

1170
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:31,853
she got off the tram
before she got to the French Concession.

1171
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:35,583
She went to the parts of the city...

1172
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:38,785
where Westerners did not go,
the Chinese parts.

1173
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:42,853
She bought up sundries
like sunglasses...

1174
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:46,992
nylon stockings, belts, scarves,
stuff like that.

1175
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:51,866
She would put them under the toolbox
that she carried with her...

1176
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:53,908
and bring them
back to the ghetto area...

1177
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:59,037
and then give them to the peddlers
on consignment in the ghetto.

1178
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,582
Even though it didn't
bring in much money...

1179
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:04,813
it brought in just enough...

1180
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:09,881
to keep us slightly above
the starvation level.

1181
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,222
One night when my parents
thought I was asleep...

1182
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,193
they were talking to one another...

1183
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:17,823
and my mother said that
there were only $17 left.

1184
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:22,033
I had no idea what 17-
It was a fair amount of money...

1185
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:24,799
but it was clear that
when that was gone...

1186
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:26,534
we would be in terrible shape.

1187
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:29,270
We had what they called
a "paocha"...

1188
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:31,243
so the Japanese
didn't have to do it...

1189
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,440
and we were happy
they didn't have to do it.

1190
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:37,246
Everybody was assigned
a couple of hours a week...

1191
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:41,483
where you got an official armband
and a stick...

1192
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:44,286
and you were standing
and controlling...

1193
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:48,159
that the people
don't go out without a pass-

1194
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:51,357
out of the ghetto without a pass-

1195
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:53,162
and that they came in on time.

1196
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:56,760
But as I said to you,
I worked for Russians...

1197
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,362
and there was a Russian club.

1198
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:02,342
The Jews that had Soviet passports
could live outside the ghetto.

1199
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:04,537
They had the radio and everything...

1200
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:08,980
and they got movies of the war
going on with Germany.

1201
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:11,985
The way to get back into the ghetto
after the hour-

1202
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:14,522
What I did is-

1203
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:17,353
The ghetto
did not have a wall around it.

1204
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:21,725
This side of the street was the ghetto,
the other side was not the ghetto.

1205
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:25,664
So I walked on the other side
of the street which was not the ghetto.

1206
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:28,996
There was one street
where the police station was.

1207
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:31,402
Just as I came
to the police station...

1208
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:34,840
I walked across the street
and into the police station.

1209
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:37,939
If anybody would ask,
I'm going in to the police...

1210
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:41,106
but then I looked around,
said, "I think I'm in the wrong place"...

1211
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:42,683
and I walked out again.

1212
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:44,685
This was maybe 10:00 at night.

1213
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:47,381
Anywhere else I walked...

1214
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:49,855
they would have caught me going into
the ghetto at 10:00.

1215
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:51,858
I was supposed to be home by 6:00.

1216
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,588
There was this White Russian boy.

1217
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:56,857
He was good friends
with the Japanese kids there.

1218
01:13:57,666 --> 01:14:00,658
Whenever he got a hold of me,
I got my daily-

1219
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:02,930
If I couldn't run fast enough,
I got my daily beating.

1220
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:06,230
I remember one time I came home,
my mother almost fainted.

1221
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:10,111
A black eye and bleeding,
no shirt, one shoe missing-

1222
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:13,238
I took a bad beating.

1223
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:17,911
George was his name.
Family name's not important.

1224
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:21,683
George and his gang, always two
or three guys. They get you.

1225
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:24,816
I used to go to bed at night,
I remember that vividly...

1226
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:29,690
and I’d say, "Someday, I don't know,
I will get even.

1227
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:32,667
I have to get even.
This can't go on. "

1228
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:35,259
I took a beating
maybe three or four times a week.

1229
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:37,338
They'd catch you, you'd get it.

1230
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:41,132
Butter was very valuable,
very expensive.

1231
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:44,239
I recall that my parents-

1232
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:47,907
Later on there wasn't any butter,
but my parents in '43, '44...

1233
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:50,917
would buy half a quarter of butter,
two ounces...

1234
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:53,180
and they would watch
and make sure that I ate it.

1235
01:14:53,956 --> 01:14:56,049
I remember once, vividly...

1236
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:59,787
walking out where my mother
was washing the dishes.

1237
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:02,523
I noticed that she licked
the last bit of butter off the plate.

1238
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:08,368
Till we moved into our-

1239
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:11,639
Can't say a flat-

1240
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:13,935
Till we moved into a room
of a larger flat...

1241
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:15,532
which was shared...

1242
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:20,846
by probably four or five families-
11, 12 people all in all.

1243
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:22,644
We had one room in there.

1244
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:29,489
Bathroom facilities,
if you can call it that...

1245
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:32,690
shared by about 11, 12 people,
if I remember correctly.

1246
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,430
In that one room,
my mother made hats...

1247
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:42,368
and that's where we lived
and slept and worked.

1248
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:45,399
I can't explain.
I don't think people today...

1249
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:47,475
will understand what this is all about
unless you see it.

1250
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:01,887
Here we had
our windows painted black...

1251
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,151
and if a little light
would shine out...

1252
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:06,124
the Japanese
would be cursing from the streets.

1253
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:09,254
I don’t want to tell you what they cursed.
I could repeat it if I wanted to.

1254
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:12,162
They used to yell from down there,
Bagero!

1255
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:17,003
If a little light shone out,
they'd come smashing the doors in.

1256
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:20,506
So we made sure
the windows were all blacked...

1257
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:25,109
with shmattes covering
so nothing would shine out.

1258
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:28,642
Werner and Fufi would lie
under the blanket at night.

1259
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,719
They had a tiny little radio- I don't
know where they got that one from-

1260
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,685
and all covered up,
they'd listen to the news.

1261
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:35,484
Fufi understood a little Russian...

1262
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:40,221
so they used to listen to the news in
Russian- what happened in World War II.

1263
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:43,855
We'd hear from the Soviet Union...

1264
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:47,163
that the Russian armies had started
turning things around...

1265
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:48,998
and pushing the Germans back.

1266
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:51,072
That gave us a little bit of hope-

1267
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:54,740
gave us a little bit of hope
for the future.

1268
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:57,141
It didn't all seem that bleak
in those days.

1269
01:16:58,180 --> 01:16:59,647
Otherwise, that's about it.

1270
01:16:59,748 --> 01:17:03,240
From here we went to school,
here we came home after we got beat up.

1271
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:07,854
This room has a lot of history.
My mother was a very fine lady.

1272
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:16,519
She made big pots of soup
with all sorts of things inside...

1273
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,623
and then she fed
another three or four people...

1274
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:20,429
who came for lunch
on a steady basis.

1275
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:22,867
There was a painter,
Kurt Frankenstein.

1276
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:26,668
There was a Mr. Rouget who in turn
taught me Russian for the food he ate.

1277
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:29,806
There was another gentleman
whose name I forget right now.

1278
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:32,175
We always had three people...

1279
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,647
eating the same soup every day
for lunch. I remember them.

1280
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:39,744
Yeah, my mom was a nice lady.
She was a good gal.

1281
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:45,819
In the place where we worked,
we had a map...

1282
01:17:45,928 --> 01:17:47,395
and every day...

1283
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:52,832
we put pins in for
the advances of the Russian army...

1284
01:17:52,935 --> 01:17:54,869
or the German-

1285
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:58,872
We had the news
through the Russian club.

1286
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:04,334
We had the newspaper in the ghetto,
in German.

1287
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:07,313
And the official news came through.

1288
01:18:08,951 --> 01:18:12,546
The victorious German army
withdrew from Harkoff.

1289
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:15,487
We knew they got
kicked out of Harkoff.

1290
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:18,954
Shanghai,
apart of the Japanese empire...

1291
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:23,395
was under attack by American forces,
mostly by air.

1292
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,594
So far up to this point...

1293
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,035
Shanghai itself had not been bombed.

1294
01:18:30,772 --> 01:18:32,239
There were strafings.

1295
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:35,572
We'd see Japanese and American
fighter planes up in the sky.

1296
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:38,737
Kids have no fear.
We’d be up on the roof.

1297
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:42,142
We'd bet with marbles
who would shoot down whom...

1298
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:45,482
as shrapnel was
falling all around us.

1299
01:18:45,587 --> 01:18:48,886
When I think of it now, how foolish.
We could have gotten killed.

1300
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:50,925
But nobody ever got hurt by that.

1301
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:53,017
I don't know.
We must have been immune.

1302
01:18:53,795 --> 01:18:56,730
They would push
the dining room tables together...

1303
01:18:56,832 --> 01:18:59,164
and put mattresses on top
and we would crawl underneath...

1304
01:18:59,268 --> 01:19:01,429
and that was
supposed to be a shelter.

1305
01:19:01,536 --> 01:19:04,403
It was July 17, 1945.

1306
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:08,567
My mother was on one of
her illegal forays in the city.

1307
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:13,848
I was on my way to see Sue and Chaya,
who were living together.

1308
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:17,976
They lived on the exact opposite
end of the ghetto from where I lived.

1309
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,915
It was a very, very hot summer day...

1310
01:19:21,023 --> 01:19:23,491
and in Shanghai
the clouds used to hang...

1311
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:26,459
just a couple hundred meters
above your head. You would choke.

1312
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:32,828
There was an air raid alarm
in the morning...

1313
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:34,402
and then it was called off.

1314
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:38,504
I think two or three times
and called off.

1315
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:41,002
I remember I went to a haircut.

1316
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:43,509
I'm walking down the road...

1317
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:45,813
and I stopped-

1318
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:49,774
Next to the prison was a hospital.

1319
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:53,919
And that hospital
had become a prison hospital...

1320
01:19:54,022 --> 01:19:58,356
for American and British POWs.

1321
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:02,927
They always had them out on a balcony
on a top floor...

1322
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:05,397
which was maybe the fifth
or sixth floor.

1323
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,560
We used to stop there
and wave to them.

1324
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:11,002
Sure they must have been wondering
who we were.

1325
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:13,040
They used to wave back
and we'd wave to them.

1326
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:15,234
Suddenly you thought
the world was coming to an end.

1327
01:20:16,845 --> 01:20:21,612
Absolutely the world- Afterwards
they said it was about a hundred B-29s...

1328
01:20:21,717 --> 01:20:24,652
over Shanghai,
just over the clouds.

1329
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:26,220
That's a-

1330
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:31,219
That's a ear-cracking noise.
It is unbearable.

1331
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:37,026
Just as I'm starting to continue
to walk over there...

1332
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:40,932
the dreaded siren went off
that the city was under attack.

1333
01:20:41,036 --> 01:20:43,095
No bomb shelter, but a trench.

1334
01:20:43,205 --> 01:20:46,538
Jumped into a trench
with some other people...

1335
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:50,099
and within a split second
the bombs were flying.

1336
01:20:50,212 --> 01:20:51,645
And then the bombs started flying.

1337
01:20:51,747 --> 01:20:54,045
The bombs,
when they go down, they go-

1338
01:20:54,816 --> 01:20:57,307
You hear that whistle.
I'll never forget that whistle...

1339
01:20:57,419 --> 01:20:58,886
right before the thud.

1340
01:20:58,987 --> 01:21:01,285
We were always taught
when the bombs start falling...

1341
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:04,257
you take an inside post
of the building.

1342
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:05,826
Never stand in the middle.

1343
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:10,988
So everybody ran, grabbed some
inside post of a building.

1344
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:15,195
People screaming, and then you heard
the sirens of the ambulances.

1345
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:17,669
It was over very, very quickly.

1346
01:21:17,773 --> 01:21:19,468
Then we started running home.

1347
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:24,406
Thirty-one refugees died,
as well as hundreds of Chinese...

1348
01:21:24,513 --> 01:21:26,481
in an attack by American forces...

1349
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:30,039
trying to hit
a Japanese radio station in Hongkew.

1350
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:33,912
The Japanese were terrific.

1351
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:36,957
They had supplied
the ghetto hospital...

1352
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:40,290
with medications
and emergency equipment...

1353
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:44,560
in the event
there would be a disaster.

1354
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:46,361
They had the ambulances.

1355
01:21:46,468 --> 01:21:50,404
They came and they
took care of everything immediately.

1356
01:21:50,505 --> 01:21:54,532
Didn't matter whether you were Chinese
or white or green or yellow.

1357
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:58,340
We had shrapnel coming into
the window of the room where we lived...

1358
01:21:58,447 --> 01:22:00,074
on my sister's bed, actually.

1359
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:02,349
On her pillow.

1360
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:06,645
And I kept that piece
for many, many years.

1361
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,918
You could see the evidence
of the destruction all over the place.

1362
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:11,492
There were shells of houses...

1363
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:15,962
and you could see that only walls
had remained where houses had been.

1364
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:18,396
and there was rubble
strewn everywhere.

1365
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:22,062
I n the afternoon
we went for a walk around the district...

1366
01:22:22,838 --> 01:22:27,537
and that was devastating.

1367
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:30,806
Dead bodies, blood, this, that-

1368
01:22:30,912 --> 01:22:33,107
I remember I couldn't fall asleep
for a whole month.

1369
01:22:33,215 --> 01:22:37,413
I used to sit in bed
all night long with nightmares...

1370
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:40,283
and I couldn't fall asleep.
I couldn't do my schoolwork.

1371
01:22:40,388 --> 01:22:42,515
My head was just not there anymore.

1372
01:22:59,774 --> 01:23:03,608
Then we heard about
the first atomic bomb...

1373
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:06,203
on Hiroshima, then on Nagasaki.

1374
01:23:06,314 --> 01:23:10,876
We said, "Oh, my God. They're now
going to drop it on Shanghai. "

1375
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:12,453
It was a terrible fear for us...

1376
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:16,520
because we knew Shanghai
was a military target.

1377
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:20,459
Otherwise, why would there be
strafings on the outskirts?

1378
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:24,931
After the war was over,
it suddenly got very quiet on the streets.

1379
01:23:25,634 --> 01:23:29,832
That was in August
when that part of the war was over.

1380
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:33,998
It got very quiet out there
and the Japanese soldiers were gone.

1381
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:36,100
We looked out
through the blackout curtains...

1382
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:37,701
and there was nobody out there.

1383
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:41,344
We waited a while
to see if it was safe...

1384
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:43,713
and then we went out
and there was nothing.

1385
01:23:44,419 --> 01:23:48,378
They were gone from the check posts
around the ghetto.

1386
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:49,980
They were out of there.

1387
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,725
That's when we found out
that it was over.

1388
01:23:53,828 --> 01:23:55,796
And when the war was over...

1389
01:23:57,265 --> 01:24:01,668
we were in good shape.
We're strong kids, played a lot of soccer.

1390
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:03,328
I went out to the streets.

1391
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:06,703
Everybody was running wild. The Jews-
Suddenly, everything opened up.

1392
01:24:07,676 --> 01:24:10,167
I went out
and two buddies came with me.

1393
01:24:10,278 --> 01:24:12,439
I went to look
for George Bremen.

1394
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:17,481
George Bremen
saw me from a block away...

1395
01:24:19,521 --> 01:24:22,183
and he knew this was the end,
and he started running.

1396
01:24:24,326 --> 01:24:25,918
But I ran like a wild animal...

1397
01:24:26,027 --> 01:24:29,554
so he couldn't have gotten away
from me, no way.

1398
01:24:29,664 --> 01:24:33,031
I got a hold of George Bremen,
and I was never a violent kid.

1399
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:36,593
If those two guys
would not have been with me-

1400
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:40,205
I probably lost my mind.
I probably would have killed him.

1401
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:44,876
I let out
three, four years of anger...

1402
01:24:46,114 --> 01:24:47,581
lots of pain.

1403
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:51,416
I hit him with everything I could...

1404
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:54,420
and if those two boys weren't there,
I probably would have killed him...

1405
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:59,553
because I lost all humanity
at that time too.

1406
01:24:59,794 --> 01:25:01,386
After the war was over...

1407
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:05,660
the Red Cross released lists of
surviving family members in Europe.

1408
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:09,901
The refugees rushed to see
who survived.

1409
01:25:11,706 --> 01:25:13,173
Few did.

1410
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:19,175
Soon after, news of what happened
in Europe reached the refugees.

1411
01:25:52,113 --> 01:25:55,480
I remember we got a few letters...

1412
01:25:56,751 --> 01:25:58,946
from the Warsaw ghetto,
which I have...

1413
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:01,779
where my Uncle Mietek...

1414
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:13,031
wrote to his sister, my mother...

1415
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:18,905
if there’s anything she can do
to help us get out of the Warsaw ghetto...

1416
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:22,408
and of course there was nothing to do.
There was nothing to do.

1417
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:26,506
I have some of the letters
in Polish, in German.

1418
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:35,689
They're very sad letters...

1419
01:26:36,624 --> 01:26:40,526
of „Help us get out of here,"
but there was nothing my mother could do.

1420
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:43,791
A completely lost situation.

1421
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:47,665
And those were the last letters.

1422
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:18,532
I always admired
the people that resisted.

1423
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,961
I've taught my children that.

1424
01:27:23,104 --> 01:27:27,973
I thought by being an athlete,
showing a different way of a Jew...

1425
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:30,237
that I contributed something...

1426
01:27:30,345 --> 01:27:33,508
that we Jews are different
and it can never happen again.

1427
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:36,644
It won’t happen again.

1428
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:40,448
I will have nothing to do
with Germany.

1429
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:43,490
Germany decimated my whole family.

1430
01:27:44,325 --> 01:27:46,589
Germany changed my whole life.

1431
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:49,588
My father
who fought for the country-

1432
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:52,632
In my mind, they murdered him.

1433
01:27:53,668 --> 01:27:57,365
I have no aunts and uncles
that I know of.

1434
01:27:57,472 --> 01:27:59,463
I grew up without cousins.

1435
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:02,338
My mother had a very difficult life.

1436
01:28:02,444 --> 01:28:04,344
Everything was taken away from her.

1437
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:06,707
I can't forget that.

1438
01:28:06,815 --> 01:28:08,282
Jewish life continues...

1439
01:28:09,217 --> 01:28:11,208
which is not guaranteed,
unfortunately.

1440
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:16,552
I always say that if my grandchildren
don't grow up Jewish...

1441
01:28:16,658 --> 01:28:18,125
Hitler won the war.

1442
01:28:19,327 --> 01:28:20,794
And it's a problem.

1443
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:26,495
Anti-Semitism never bothered me
as much as assimilation.

1444
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,228
Most of the rest of the family...

1445
01:28:28,336 --> 01:28:30,930
that I'd gotten to know
from our yearly visits-

1446
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:34,372
I spent a month or two in Poland
every summer- did not survive.

1447
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:37,934
When we heard about
the concentration camps...

1448
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:40,537
I remember vividly...

1449
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:48,051
that my only recollection of some of
the people that did not survive...

1450
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:51,091
were things that I was
very unhappy about.

1451
01:28:51,192 --> 01:28:53,854
That was long before
I learned about survivor guilt...

1452
01:28:53,962 --> 01:28:57,489
because there was the feeling
of we had survived and they had not.

1453
01:28:57,599 --> 01:29:00,033
I remember the last time I saw-

1454
01:29:00,134 --> 01:29:02,398
One of my cousins
who lived in Dembitz...

1455
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:05,962
and his mother and I understand
his father survived-

1456
01:29:07,075 --> 01:29:08,906
I was always very jealous of him.

1457
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:10,875
He was clearly the brightest
of all the cousins.

1458
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:12,446
We must have had eight, nine cousins.

1459
01:29:12,547 --> 01:29:16,210
When we get together, he could
solve any puzzle and stump the rest of us.

1460
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:19,315
But he was physically
somewhat more awkward than I...

1461
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:22,150
and I remember vividly
that the last time we got together...

1462
01:29:22,257 --> 01:29:24,316
I had a big fight with him...

1463
01:29:25,159 --> 01:29:27,320
and his eyeglasses were broken.

1464
01:29:27,428 --> 01:29:30,761
I remember when I heard after the war
that he had not survived...

1465
01:29:31,733 --> 01:29:33,928
that was the only memory
that kept coming back to me.

1466
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:37,664
How could I possibly have fought with him
the last time I saw him?

1467
01:29:42,744 --> 01:29:44,905
But on the whole they didn't know
what was happening...

1468
01:29:45,013 --> 01:29:49,382
so they focused on their own life
and on the misery of life in Shanghai.

1469
01:29:49,484 --> 01:29:52,476
Lo and behold, after the war they
found out they're living in paradise...

1470
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:55,382
compared to what happened
to their brethren in Europe.

1471
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:57,617
That's what it was.
It's all a relative thing.

1472
01:29:58,626 --> 01:30:01,459
You don't know you’re living in paradise
until you're kicked out.

1473
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:30,281
After American liberation...

1474
01:30:30,391 --> 01:30:33,189
the living conditions in Shanghai
improved greatly.

1475
01:30:34,028 --> 01:30:35,928
In the following years...

1476
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:39,193
all the refugees
left Shanghai and China...

1477
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,063
and spread around the world.

1478
01:30:44,472 --> 01:30:48,431
The Israeli government had chartered
three small Greek ships.

1479
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:54,504
These three ships sailed
up the Yangtze River, the Whangpoo...

1480
01:30:54,616 --> 01:30:56,208
with Israeli flags...

1481
01:30:57,318 --> 01:31:01,584
which is still a very moving
moment to me...

1482
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:05,648
because obviously
if there were an Israel...

1483
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,227
there wouldn't have been
a Holocaust.

1484
01:31:07,328 --> 01:31:09,888
It's as simple as that.

1485
01:31:09,998 --> 01:31:14,901
Of course, anybody who wanted to
was welcome to go aboard the ship.

1486
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:20,832
And no one-
These are still moving moments for me.

1487
01:31:21,743 --> 01:31:26,476
No one was ever asked for a visa
or for a ship's passage...

1488
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:29,209
and if that had been true
we wouldn't have been in Shanghai...

1489
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:33,048
and there wouldn’t have been six million
Jews killed during the Second World War.

1490
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:37,750
Many of the Jews in Shanghai
did go to Israel...

1491
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:43,092
and others- most came
to the United States, some to Australia.

1492
01:31:43,197 --> 01:31:46,064
We came to the United States
on a US troop transport-

1493
01:31:47,268 --> 01:31:48,735
the SS Marine Lynx...

1494
01:31:48,836 --> 01:31:53,796
which was a beautiful ship
for transporting the US Army.

1495
01:31:53,908 --> 01:31:56,809
Beautiful ship that took us
from Shanghai...

1496
01:31:56,911 --> 01:32:00,540
through Yokohama and Hawaii
to San Francisco.

1497
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:04,209
Couple thousand Jewish refugees
on the ship.

1498
01:32:05,086 --> 01:32:07,350
Ship got into San Francisco
3:00 in the morning.

1499
01:32:16,664 --> 01:32:21,124
I thought the ocean would overflow
with all the tears of the refugees...

1500
01:32:21,235 --> 01:32:23,203
when they see San Francisco
at 3:00 in the morning.

1501
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:36,278
But on the transcontinental train
from San Francisco to New York...

1502
01:32:37,285 --> 01:32:41,187
I happened to be on the train
with two black soldiers.

1503
01:32:41,289 --> 01:32:43,086
And usually
as soon as the train would stop...

1504
01:32:43,191 --> 01:32:46,456
we'd get off just to stretch our legs,
get a different environment.

1505
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:49,359
We got off at Albuquerque,
the black soldiers didn't get off.

1506
01:32:49,464 --> 01:32:50,931
I didn't understand why.

1507
01:32:51,032 --> 01:32:55,560
Then I walked into the station...

1508
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:59,470
and there's a sign,
"White Men" and "Colored Men. "

1509
01:33:00,842 --> 01:33:05,142
I remember vividly
I felt as if I had been slapped.

1510
01:33:06,314 --> 01:33:09,875
I also felt that I couldn't face
the black soldiers.

1511
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:15,483
It's not that I was that
racially conscious at the time.

1512
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:18,525
Of course I knew about discrimination.
It wasn’t anything new to me.

1513
01:33:18,626 --> 01:33:21,789
But I'd never encountered it firsthand
since we left Germany.

1514
01:33:23,397 --> 01:33:24,864
And the one thing I learned...

1515
01:33:24,966 --> 01:33:29,232
having lived among
Japanese and Chinese people...

1516
01:33:31,506 --> 01:33:36,136
is that I can't find it in myself
to hate a nation...

1517
01:33:36,244 --> 01:33:37,711
or a people.
