00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,619
The painted maple bread originally
developed by Magic Bakery was copied

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,340
and is being sold by
Shinhwa Bakery with their capital strength.

[Final Episode]

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,969
After the story went public,

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,699
it's raised questions about the
high-handedness of big corporations.

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,779
How do you estimate your damage from it?

9
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,969
We used to have customers
in here like packs of dogs,

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,659
but now, as you can see,
there isn't so much as a fly.

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,660
Huh?

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,419
What are you doing, you fool?

13
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,280
It’s itchy.
I’m talking now.

14
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,469
Oops, I’m sorry.

15
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,109
I didn’t mean to be
rude to the viewers.

16
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,079
You can edit that part out, right?

17
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,579
Ah, yes.

18
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,179
- Please speak comfortably.
- Sure.

19
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,040
Good.

20
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,019
The decrease in sales is an issue,

21
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,909
but the biggest problem is that
Shinhwa Bakery claimed we copied them

22
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,459
so we’ve lost our credibility
with our customers.

23
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,039
Then do you have solid evidence that

24
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,300
Magic Bakery developed and launched
the painted maple bread first?

25
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:58,830
Yes.

26
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,219
Our painted maple bread was
featured in Gourmet Guide

27
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,809
before Shinhwa Bakery launched theirs.

28
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,339
So it was the bread featured
in Gourmet Guide.

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,329
If Shinhwa Bakery copied
and launched it,

30
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,879
they should have expected
this level of controversy.

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,819
I don't think that
they care much because

32
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,020
they believe small business owners
like us can't do much about it.

33
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,099
The first daughter of
Shinhwa Group said,

34
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,999
"You don’t have power,
money or a backer."

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,430
"Go ahead and try to do
whatever you want about it."

36
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,689
Ah, yes.

37
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,479
The next question is a little different.

38
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,319
I heard that the employees
of Magic Bakery

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,070
have a special background.

40
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,440
Can you tell me about it?

41
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,009
We met as cellmates
at Korea Women's Penitentiary.

42
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,959
We’ve lived together
like a family since then

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,539
and now we run Magic Bakery together.

44
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,799
It must be hard for you
to make that public.

45
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,650
Thank you for being honest with us.

- You’re so mean!
- Jeez.

It’s only the bread we copied.

59
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,689
How could they turn it into arrogation?

60
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,539
How would they like to learn
what arrogation really is, huh?

61

Jeez.

First of all,

98
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,749
I would like to say that
everything concerning

99
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,030
the painted maple bread
issue was my sole decision.

100

Since the entirety of this incident
was the result of my negligence,

101

When we studied abroad,

whenever I used to cry,

114
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,329
you would always comfort me
and say, "You'll be alright."

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,349
to hire professional executives

164
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,749
and change our current management

165
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,620
in order to embrace Geobuk Bakery’s
corporate philosophy.

166
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,860
Do Jin came back to Shinhwa too.

167
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,989
How dare he?

168
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,909
Shinhwa Group isn’t
Shinhwa Group anymore.

169
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,150
I’m the only one of the Ma family

170
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,270
left in Shinhwa.

[The Fall of Shinhwa Group]

172
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,089
<i>For thirty years,</i>

173
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,779
<i>I've lived only for the sake of revenge.</i>

174
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,100
<i>Now, after it's all over,</i>

175
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,180
<i>I finally regret wasting my life on it.</i>

176
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,360
<i>Sang Woo.</i>

177
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,180
<i>Do I look pathetic to you, too?</i>

178
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,050
<i>Is that why you never
appear in my dreams?</i>

179
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,950
I’ll forget about the past

180
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,780
and I’ll live well with the children,

181
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,570
so you can stop worrying about me now

182
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,030
and rest in peace.

183
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,849
Thank you.

184
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,339
Please come again.

185
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,940
Please come again.

186
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,710
It's true there are always
ups and downs in life,

187
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,459
but when I first found out that
Shinhwa Bakery copied our bread,

188
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,419
I felt like I'd been blindsided.

189
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,749
I never would have imagined

190
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,569
such a crisis would make us so famous

191
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,290
that we'd sell out of bread every day.

192
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,209
You can't even read.

193
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,700
I had no idea you could be so eloquent.

194
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,570
Customers can hear you.

195
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,829
Oops.
Sorry.

196
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,910
We need to bake more
painted maple bread.

197
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,040
- Do we have dough left, *<i>Unni</i>?
- [*<i>Unni</i>: Older sister or older female]

198
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,209
Mi O asked you how much
painted maple bread

199
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,610
dough we have left.

200
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,989
Oh, I can bake two more batches.

201
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,990
Okay.

202
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,619
Just stop worrying.

203
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,490
Go tell him not to go.

204
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,000
I’m talking about Byeol’s father.

205
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,900
He's leaving for Paris.

206
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,869
Can you live without him?

207
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,060
I should go back to kitchen
and bake more bread.

208
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,059
Leave her alone.

209
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,239
She's already beside herself.

210
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,310
I don’t think she can handle it
if Byeol’s father’s leaves.

211
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,829
She'll make it.

212
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,820
You don’t need to worry at all.

213
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,589
What if they really break up?

214
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,219
If they’re meant to be,

215
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,549
they’ll meet again anyway.

216
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,469
Don’t worry too much.

217
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,200
I’m a philosopher.

218
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,130
<i>My heart is</i>

219
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,350
<i>with you like this,</i>

220
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,700
<i>so put this ring on my finger</i>

221
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,870
<i>when you want to come back to me.</i>

222
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,259
Young Wok and others couldn’t
come out to see you off

223
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,289
because the store's too busy.

224
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,880
They asked me to tell you sorry.

225
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,980
Is Soo In alright?

226
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,690
She's taking it pretty hard.

227
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,320
I feel so sorry for her.

228
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,759
Since you’re about to leave,

229
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,720
there must be a lot worrying you, huh?

230
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,620
Yes.

231
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,100
Please take care of mother and Byeol.

232
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,360
Don’t worry.

233
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,750
My Byeol.

234
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,049
Even if dad isn’t with you, you should
listen to grandma and grandpa

235
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,180
and get along well with your friends.

236
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,240
I’ll call you and
send you letters every day.

237
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,050
Promise me you'll reply.

238
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,189
Byeol, stop.

239
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,190
Don't cry.

240
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,280
Jeez, you're incredible.

241
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,050
Why didn’t you go see him off?

242
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,420
If you let him leave like this,
you’ll regret it a lot later.

243
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:04,590
If you ask me

244
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,999
what love is,

245
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,879
I say it’s

246
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,340
a seed of tears...

247
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,610
Don't sing that song.
It makes me want to drink.

248
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,450
Huh?

249
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,010
Why are you crying?

250
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,650
I don’t know.

251
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:28,120
I just can’t stop it.

252
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,230
Huh?

253
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,789
Are you back already?

254
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,430
Byeol’s father went early.

255
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,510
He left safely.

256
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,239
He said he’ll be back safely too,

257
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,600
so he wants you to take care
in the meantime.

258
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,820
I…

259
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,460
I'm going to go out for a walk.

260
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,590
<i>It’s me, Soo In.</i>

261
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,330
<i>I just finished packing up
and I'm having a beer.</i>

262
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,929
<i>I thought about leaving you a voicemail,</i>

263
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,389
<i>but we won't be able
to see each other for a while.</i>

264
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,740
<i>I'm afraid you'll forget my face,
so I'm sending you a video instead.</i>

265
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,710
<i>I'm leaving for now because I thought
you'd be more comfortable</i>

266
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,760
<i>without having me near you,</i>

267
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,380
<i>but I’m not sure it’s
the right decision.</i>

268
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,960
<i>I'll look pathetic if
I change my mind now,</i>

269
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,280
<i>so I'm leaving.</i>

270
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,389
<i>But if you call me,</i>

271
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,460
<i>I’ll fly back to you right away.</i>

272
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,689
<i>So…</i>

273
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,309
<i>Don’t cry</i>

274
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,949
<i>and don’t get sick.</i>

275
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,780
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

276
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,260
<i>Even though I'm not physically near you,</i>

277
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:04,450
<i>don’t forget that I
left my heart with you.</i>

278
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,460
<i>I love you, Soo In.</i>

279
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,119
Why does the table look so empty?

280
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,000
Where is everyone?

281
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,490
Do Hyun...
Where is my Do Hyun?

282
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,130
Do Hyun…

283
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,430
He went to study abroad
for his doctorate.

284
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,190
Where’s Joo Hee?

285
00:16:57,191 --> 00:17:01,300
Joo Hee resigned and went to New York.
She'll be back in a few years.

286
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,799
What about your father?

287
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,960
Father?

288
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,260
Father is…

289
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,149
How long

290
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,589
are you going to make him stay
in that cold place?

291
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,019
What does our corporate legal team do?

292
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,620
They just sit around and get paid.

293
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,350
They’re working on it day
and night to figure something out.

294
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,719
No matter how they work hard,
it’s pointless.

295
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,589
Father has been suffering
for a few months now.

296
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,690
The situation is bad.

297
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,560
Who is it this early?

298
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,860
I’ll go out to see who it is.

299
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,619
Whenever I think about father,
it drives me crazy.

300
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,139
He’s an old man in his seventies
and he's being confined like this.

301
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,319
Oh my.

302
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,550
No one could have dreamed his
later years would be like this.

303
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,880
You should come out.

304
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,819
Why?

305
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,620
They're from Jongro Police Station's
Criminal Department.

306
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,870
What?

307
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,260
Why are criminal
detectives at our house?

308
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,329
Did you make trouble again?

309
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,259
No, I didn’t do anything wrong.

310
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,610
What are you talking about?

311
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,370
I mean it.

312
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,149
- Come here.
- Get off me.

313
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,670
Get off me.

314
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,609
Are you Ms. Ma Joo Ran?

315
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,460
Yes?

316
00:18:21,461 --> 00:18:22,909
Yes, I am.

317
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,330
You're under arrest for auto theft,
vandalism and obstruction of business.

318
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,489
What are they saying?

319
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,549
We've discovered that Ma Joo Ran hired

320
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,550
a detective agency to steal
and destroy a food truck.

321
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,159
A food truck?

322
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,419
I’ve… I've never done such a thing.

323
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,229
Don’t accuse the innocent.

324
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:43,230
If you cooperate with us, we can determine
if you're really innocent or not.

325
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,580
Wait.
Wait.

326
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,470
- Ms. Ma Joo Ran.
- What's this?

327
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,529
You have the right to remain silent.

328
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,409
Anything you say can
be used against you.

329
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,939
You have the right to an attorney.

330
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,940
Uncuff me right now.

331
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:56,609
I’m innocent.
How could you do this?

332
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,330
All of you!
I’ll sue you for defamation.

333
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,200
Oh my.

334
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:02,389
- Oh my.
- Honey.

335
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,310
- Honey.
- Honey.

336
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:04,999
- Honey, help me!
- Honey.

337
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,820
Mother!

338
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:06,959
Mother, save me!

339
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,990
Mother!

340
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,349
Do we have a guest?

341
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,059
What's all this noise?

342
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,139
Oh my!

343
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,100
What did she do this time?

344
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,150
Yes, Lawyer Park.

345
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,529
Come to Jongro Police Station now.

346
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,530
Hurry up.

347
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,229
Are you saying that
you’ve never been to

348
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,740
Mori Detective Agency?

349
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,020
Yes.

350
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:35,369
I’ve never been there.

351
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,749
Mo... Mori?

352
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,680
I've never heard of it.

353
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,640
Come in and sit.

354
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,379
Ms. Ma Joo Ran said she
doesn’t know you.

355
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,529
What’s going on here?

356
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,059
She said she doesn't know us?

357
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,069
We took care of her
requests a few times.

358
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,849
Hey, hey.
You know her, right?

359
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,370
You really don't remember us?

360
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,419
What are you talking about?

361
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,349
I don’t remember you.

362
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,460
Do you know me?

363
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,619
<i>This… is a truck.</i>

364
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,239
<i>I don’t care whatever you do,</i>

365
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,699
<i>just get rid of the truck.</i>

366
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,739
<i>I want it to disappear forever.</i>

367
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,489
<i>That's a piece of cake for us.</i>

368
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,819
<i>You know that we’re really good
at what we do.</i>

369
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,690
<i>Wait!</i>

370
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:29,430
<i>You should never let them know
that I was involved in this.</i>

371
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,729
We’ve already confirmed that

372
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,929
you've had dealings with Lee Geun Ho
through his bank account.

373
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,140
Why don’t you stop denying it
and admit your crimes?

374
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,509
I’ll call my husband and a lawyer.

375
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,429
Let me use the phone,

376
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,430
please.

377
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,380
What… What’s going on?

378
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:55,189
Why are they here now?

379
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,289
I’m Moon Soo In.
You called me.

380
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,459
I called you because I found the truck
you reported was stolen.

381
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,680
Is this the truck you lost?

382
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,500
- Wow.
- Oh.

383
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,899
Yes, this is our truck.

384
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,349
Yes. this is the one.

385
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,509
Where is the truck now?

386
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,179
Ms. Ma Joo Ran here hired

387
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,289
a detective agency to steal
and destroy your truck.

388
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,910
It's already been scrapped.

389
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,819
My, my, my!

390
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,249
You tall nut.

391
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,080
I got you now.

392
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:24,890
Soo In.

393
00:21:24,891 --> 00:21:26,539
It’s my fault.

394
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,870
I’m so sorry.

395
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,629
I must have been out of my mind.

396
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,509
I’ll compensate you ten times…

397
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,519
No, a hundred times
what the truck was worth.

398
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,309
Please… Please forgive me this once.

399
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,310
Please?

400
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,429
How dare you brag about your money now?

401
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,629
I’m not bragging.

402
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,639
I’m just saying that I want
to make it up to her.

403
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,789
Enough!

404
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,799
Officer.

405
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,929
We’ll never make a
settlement with her,

406
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,380
so let the law handle her.

407
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,179
Ms. Yoko.

408
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,669
Please save me.

409
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,049
I’m so sorry.

410
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,390
- *<i>Sumimasen</i>.
- [* "I'm sorry" in Japanese]

411
00:21:56,393 --> 00:21:57,809
<i>Sumimasen</i>.

412
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,329
Yoko isn’t willing

413
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,329
to make a settlement at all.

414
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,330
<i>Sumimasen</i>.

415
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,319
Soo In.

416
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,499
We used to be family once.

417
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,119
I liked you a lot.

418
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,170
Please forgive me.

419
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,939
What will happen to her if we settle?

420
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,399
For the theft charges,

421
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,209
she'll still need to be punished
whether or not you settle.

422
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,039
In Ma Joo Ran’s case,

423
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,809
we have solid evidence
to prove her crime,

424
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,349
so she can’t avoid prosecution.

425
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,499
I’m the first daughter
of Shinhwa Group.

426
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,299
I'm the woman who donated $4 million!

427
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,550
Why are you doing this to me?

428
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,860
She’s really driving me crazy.

429
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,789
Forgive me, please.

430
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,430
Please.

431
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,190
It’s daddy.

432
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,199
You practically just went to work.

433
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,710
Why are you calling already?

434
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,449
Can you not work because you
miss your son so much?

435
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,789
That’s not why I’m calling you.

436
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,980
We have a problem, mother.

437
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,550
What?

438
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:05,979
Is it something at work?

439
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,519
Joo Ran was arrested for theft
and business obstruction.

440
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,659
Her case is being sent
to the prosecutor’s office.

441
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,739
Theft and business obstruction?

442
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,229
How was she involved in that?

443
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,030
She hired a private detective
to steal and destroy Soo In’s food truck.

444
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,810
What?

445
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,190
Dan Shim.

446
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,439
The weather is cold.

447
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,120
Why are you sitting out here?

448
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,789
Welcome back, lady.

449
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,570
It’s been a long time.

450
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,289
You seemed to have
aged while I was away.

451
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,660
Have you been sick?

452
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,430
I missed you.

453
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,210
I did miss you.

454
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:05,680
I missed you a lot, too.

455
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,350
He’s so cute.

456
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,450
He’s Do Jin’s son.

457
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,489
I hope my Do Hyun…

458
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,860
would hurry and have a son too.

459
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,290
He’s studying abroad now.

460
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:30,169
If you stay out here,
you'll catch a cold.

461
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,920
Let’s go in.

462
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,169
Even if I go in, there’s
no one at home.

463
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:39,110
They left me alone in this big house.

464
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,279
If I stay in all day long,

465
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,650
I don’t have a chance
to talk to anyone.

466
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,469
Why are you alone?

467
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,549
There are plenty of employees here.

468
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,099
They are busy with their own work.

469
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,510
They can’t play with me,
so I have to play alone.

470
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,300
I… want to be with you.

471
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,089
Can you take me with you?

472
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,090
Please?

473
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,770
Okay.

474
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,310
Come to my house with me.

475
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:16,339
I’ll take care of you from now on.

476
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,940
Yes, yes.

477
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,229
People say that there’s
always an ending to evil,

478
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,000
and this is how things will end.

479
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,570
You've suffered so much, my daughter.

480
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,870
You’re the one who had a hard time.

481
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,989
Let’s forget our grudges

482
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,450
and live comfortably from now on, okay?

483
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,930
Yes, mother.

484
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,940
<i>Father,</i>

485
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,490
<i>you have no conscience</i>

486
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,330
<i>and no shame as a human being.</i>

487
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,420
<i>Your whole life, you've built up
a tower of avarice</i>

488
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,200
<i>you call success.</i>

489
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,719
<i>You're just a watchdog to protect
the house and eat dung.</i>

00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:34,849
Also, if you get in serious trouble,

658
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:37,819
there’s a prison officer
named Kim Yoo Jin.

659
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,219
I’m close with her.

660
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,509
Tell her about me
and she'll take care of you.

661
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,420
My real name is Kim Young Wok.

662
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,050
Stop being silly.

663
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,109
How is she?

664
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,469
Who are you talking about?

665
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,789
- You know, the one making bread.
- Ahh...

666
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:52,820
Soo In?

667
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,849
She's the new baking
instructor around here

668
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,899
for vocational training.

669
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,570
I came with Soo In.

670
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,790
Ha!

671
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,940
Soo In?
Volunteer work?

672
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,480
Jeez.

673
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,880
Hey.

674
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:10,759
Even the daughter of a millionaire looks

675
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,699
clumsy and dirty in a prison uniform.

676
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:18,130
You’re like a cat having hemorrhoids.

677
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,819
A cat having hemorrhoids?

678
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,899
I’m the first daughter
of Shinhwa Group.

679
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,659
I donated $4 million.

680
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,279
Who do you think you’re talking to?

681
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,289
How dare you?

682
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,100
Hemorrhoids?

683
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:31,769
Did you say hemorrhoids?

684
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,279
Stop it.
You'll get in trouble.

685
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,779
Shut up!

686
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,829
If you scream like this,
they'll drag you off to be punished.

687
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,959
I'm serious.
That means solitary confinement.

688
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,950
Whatever.

689
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:43,099
- They'll really do that to you.
- I’m done!

690
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,100
Are you?

691
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,670
Are you sure that you won’t appeal?

692
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,849
It can reduce the sentence…

693
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:51,970
It’s okay.

694
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,000
You don’t need to worry anymore.

695
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,919
So… How’s Joo Ran?

696
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,809
It's just like in the detention center.

697
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:05,980
She doesn't seem to be
handling prison very well.

698
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,230
You know her temper, father.

699
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,539
According to the prison officer,
she's healthy

700
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,190
and living relatively well,

701
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,110
so don’t worry too much.

702
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,600
Please visit her often.

703
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,520
She has no one else left but you now.

704
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,510
Yes.

705
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:34,560
Don’t worry and take good care
of your health.

706
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,250
What is this place?

707
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,420
We came to see Do Hyun’s father.

708
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,820
How could you come here?

709
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,560
She wanted to see you.

710
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,359
Why are you in there?

711
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,100
Come out quickly.

712
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,989
I can't leave now.

713
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:29,510
I have to stay here a little longer.

714
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,050
Thank you.

715
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,270
It must be difficult
to take care of a sick person.

716
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,190
I don’t know what to say.

717
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,090
The sins

718
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:47,650
I’ve committed against
her and Do Hyun…

719
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,600
I'm grateful I can pay
them back this way.

720
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,030
No.

721
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,879
You did nothing wrong.

722
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,440
It was all my fault.

723
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,780
Yes.

724
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,810
I only rushed forward

725
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,480
like I was deaf and blind.

726
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,539
After coming here,

727
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,650
I've finally opened my eyes
and ears to things.

728
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,360
I've committed a grave sin to you.

729
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:23,429
If I hadn't done such a thing,

730
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:26,930
you'd be living happily
with Do Jin's father now.

731
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,829
I've done the unforgivable

732
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:32,240
to you and Do Jin.

733
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,640
Mr. Chairman.

734
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,290
Yes.

735
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,500
Tell Jin Woo’s mother.

736
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,749
I’ll attend her retrial

737
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:48,220
and testify that I'm the one
who killed Jae Sub.

738
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,220
Are you serious?

739
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,290
I have nothing more to hide now.

740
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,470
Honey.

741
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:20,379
Your job is to eat, sleep and pee.

742
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,589
My job is to feed you, put you sleep
and do the laundry.

743
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,510
Right?

744
00:40:24,511 --> 00:40:26,720
Yes, yes, yes.

745
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,009
I'll go get some diapers
and be right back to hug you.

746
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,020
Just wait for a moment.

747
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,230
My twins, father is home!

748
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,239
- My twins.
- Poong Geum!

749
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,429
Oh my...
Oh my God.

750
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:41,199
You didn’t tell me you were coming.
What brings you here?

751
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,069
We have something to tell

752
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,440
you and our brother.

753
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,370
Did something happen?

754
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,610
I have no idea.

755
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,699
Bow to brother and sister-in-law.

756
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,720
- Bow!
- Bow!

757
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,860
That's enough.

758
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:03,090
- Sit!
- Sit!

759
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,019
Why are you suddenly
visiting and bowing?

760
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,130
What’s going on?

761
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Huh?

762
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,060
What is it?

763
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,550
One, two, three, four… A grand?

764
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,810
This is a lot of money.
How could you…

765
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,129
All three of us chipped in.

766
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,159
You still don't have a house

767
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,739
because you’ve supported us.

768
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,379
You have twins now.

769
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,930
You should at least stop
renting a room, okay?

770
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,129
He’s right.

771
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:46,200
We never knew you were living
in a residence hall.

772
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,489
When I was talking to
the sisters-in-law,

773
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:51,130
I mistakenly said…

774
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,570
- *<i>Hyung</i>! Being the first son isn’t a sin.
- [*<i>Hyung</i>: Older brother or older male]

775
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,439
You’ve sacrificed yourself to support
your siblings until now.

776
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,679
You should give us a chance
to return your kindness.

777
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,149
- Yes.
- Yes.

778
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:05,150
Please… Please accept it, <i>Hyung</i>.

779
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,750
You’re making me cry.

780
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,959
Thank you.

781
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,579
You don’t need to thank us.

782
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:16,219
It’s what we have to do.

783
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,930
- Everyone, stand up again.
- Stand up!

784
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,559
Let's bow again to our big brother
and sister-in-law

785
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,339
who have lived such hard
lives for our sake!

786
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,340
Bow!

787
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,310
You guys…

788
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,170
Really…

789
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,920
Thank you, brother!

790
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,230
Is he sick?

791
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,620
Why are you out here?

792
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:06,509
Why are you sighing so deeply?

793
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,840
Is something bothering you?

794
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,129
The more I think about it,

795
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,320
the more and more pathetic I feel.

796
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,390
Why do you feel pathetic?

797
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,719
I did raise my brothers well.

798
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,770
I agree.

799
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:26,600
Let’s look for a house tomorrow.

800
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,400
Don’t even think about it.

801
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,829
Huh?
Do you want to keep renting a room?

802
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:33,579
The house isn’t our priority now.

803
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,140
Hand in your resignation tomorrow.

804
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:36,970
Resignation?

805
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,979
Learn baking from Soo In

806
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,909
and open a bakery shop
with the money your brothers gave us.

807
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:44,910
Magic Bakery Number Two!

808
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,379
Magic Bakery Number Two?

809
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,259
You know how popular
our bakery is these days.

810
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,990
Reporters came to cover
our bakery a few days ago.

811
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,689
I’m not sure I can do it well.

812
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:57,579
For me and our twins,

813
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:00,000
you should do your best.

814
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:02,160
Yes.
Okay!

815
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:06,160
Let’s talk to Soo In first.

816
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:07,990
Huh?

817
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:09,570
It’s mother and father.

818
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,810
They seem very serious.

819
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:18,110
How many years it has been
since you were released?

820
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,839
Can you imagine how I feel

821
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,420
when I have to just
look at a woman I love?

822
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,980
I’m sorry.

823
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,679
Because of Soo In and Woo Seok…

824
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,919
I can’t do it first.

825
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,890
You and I aren’t young, Bok Nyeo.

826
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:34,609
If you keep delaying us for them,

827
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:38,500
we'll end up dead before we're married.

828
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,500
How could you say that?

829
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,510
I feel differently from last year.

830
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:46,899
I even get tired just
doing ironing lately.

831
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,510
There’s no guarantee that

832
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,110
I'll be healthy forever.

833
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:55,379
Don't be so childish.

834
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,320
I can’t control my anger.

835
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,320
I think it'll make me sick soon.

836
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,590
Even if I eat,

837
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,990
I can’t taste it.

838
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:09,660
Even if I see something good,
I don't feel anything.

839
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,680
You'll fuss and say I'm too greedy,

840
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,760
but that's who I am.

841
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:19,619
Mr. Park.

842
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,800
Mr. Park!

843
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,640
Byeol's grandfather
could really get sick.

844
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:26,210
I know.

845
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,480
We should do something.

846
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:30,150
Huh?

847
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,069
What do you want to say?

848
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:34,789
I went to Cheongju today.
I’m so tired.

849
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:37,069
Soo In went there to have a class.

850
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,819
Why did you go there, Young Wok?

851
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,479
I went to see the tall nut.

852
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,600
I deposited $50 for her.

853
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,230
Is she alright?

854
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,269
Hey.

855
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:49,929
She went berserk like a mad wild boar.

856
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:51,960
She looked just like one too.

857
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,309
It must've been quite a scene.
I should’ve gone with you.

858
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:57,980
By the way, why did
you call us all here?

859
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,080
Oh, that's right!
I forgot.

860
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,709
Mr. Chairman, please speak.

861
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:04,050
Mr. Chairman?

862
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:08,449
I'm the chairman of Park Yi Moon

863
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:11,059
and Shim Bok Nyeo’s wedding
promotion committee.

864
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:15,089
Park Yi Moon and Shim Bok Nyeo’s
wedding promotion committee?

865
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:16,060
Yes.

866
00:46:16,061 --> 00:46:17,409
We should do something.

867
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:20,109
Father could fall ill from stress.

868
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,869
Let’s help them get married.

869
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,339
Darn it!

870
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,400
You bastard!

871
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,909
You bastard!

872
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:32,409
You only care about Shim Bok Nyeo
and not me?

873
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:35,559
I can't even sleep at night
because I'm so lonely.

874
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,810
Don't you pity me?

875
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:39,979
Jeez, you´re so silly!

876
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,299
Why am I silly?

877
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,519
I’m still young!

878
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,689
Young Wok, you have the man
with a hearing aid.

879
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:48,519
Even Mr. Hearing Aid got married
two weeks ago!

880
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,079
Calm down, Young Wok.

881
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,560
Yes.

882
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,309
After mother and father's wedding,

883
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,870
I promise that we’ll
get you married too.

884
00:46:58,510 --> 00:46:59,539
Really?

885
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,350
Yes, of course.
Don’t worry.

886

887
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:04,730
Sit down now.

Continue.

889
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,070
Oh, sure.

890
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:11,529
If we tell them to get married,

891
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:14,579
it’s too obvious that Byeol’s grandmother
would disagree.

892
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,790
That means we have to prepare
a surprise wedding.

893
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,779
- A surprise wedding?
- A surprise wedding?

894
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:19,650
Yes.

895
00:47:19,651 --> 00:47:22,320
Let's make it a secret wedding.

896
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:23,589
Is that possible?

897
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:27,349
We'll lie to them and say we're taking
a family trip to Jeju Island

898
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:30,099
and we’ll make them get married there.

899
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,829
- That’s a good idea.
- I know.

900
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:33,899
What should I do with our twins?

901
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,470
It'll be too hard to take them too.

902
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:40,480
I can ask my mother to take care
of them for a couple of days.

903
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,179
Can you?

904
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,080
Yes, of course.

905
00:47:43,081 --> 00:47:45,459
My mother loves babies.

906
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,350
Thank you.

907
00:47:46,351 --> 00:47:47,819
Wait, just wait a moment.

908
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:51,650
Is it really okay to have a wedding
without Byeol's father?

909
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,269
I didn’t say anything wrong.

910
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:00,690
A son should attend
his mother's wedding.

911
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:04,330
We’re all their sons and daughters.

912
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:05,959
That’s right.

913
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,270
Byeol’s father will understand.

914
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,020
Yes, I think so.

The air is great too!
It’s awesome.

The weather isn’t great.

It’s too cold.

Let's hurry to the hotel.

921
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:37,309
You've only complained
since we got on the plane.

922
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:39,319
This is our first family trip together.

923

Let’s have fun.

924
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:42,879
Family trip?
Yeah, right.

925
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,900
That's what you think this is?

926
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:20,040
The scenery on the way here was amazing.

927
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,769
Isn’t this too expensive?

928
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:23,119
It's our first family vacation.

929
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,040
We should spend at least this much.

930

Oh, yes.
Don't worry.

931

Do Jin helped out a lot too,
so there's no need to worry.

Don't you know I quit Shinhwa Group?

937

00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:52,800
inconsequential to me now.

My husband called him last night,
but he didn’t answer the phone.

Why didn’t he answer the phone?

I don’t know.

944

He's probably on a trip or something.

Jeez, you're making such
a big deal out of it.
