1
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,430
I found him!

2
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,400
Ko Dongjun!

3
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,130
Ko Dongjun!

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,230
Ko Dongjun!

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,160
Ko Dongjun!

6
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,070
Stop right there!

7
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,260
Hey!

8
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,430
Dad, I'm going to find you.

9
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,160
So please be alive.

10
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,160
What do you think of Chunsik?

11
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,270
He's a good person.

12
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,600
Isn't that Ko Dongjun?

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,060
Stop the bus!

14
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,630
Hey!

15
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,360
This is all his fault.

16
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,960
If he hadn't died like that...

17
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,660
I wouldn't have to lie to my family.

18
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,660
What's wrong with being a loan shark?

19
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,770
I thought they'd be hiding,

20
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,000
but they were in Seoul?

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,010
Hey...
but they were in Seoul?

22
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:54,400
but they were in Seoul?

23
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,000
Where's your husband?

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,630
I saw him with my own two eyes.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,400
Husband

26
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,170
This is the Yeongdeungpo police.

27
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,470
Are you Ko Dongjun's wife?

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,160
Is this your husband?

29
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,960
Where did you see my husband?

30
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,900
At the alley full of used book stores

31
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,630
in Cheonggyecheon.

32
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,000
Dongjun used to go there often.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,200
Did he really see my husband?
Dongjun used to go there often.

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,460
Did he really see my husband?

35
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,460
Have you seen this man?

36
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,560
I heard he was here earlier.

37
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,130
He bought books here a few days ago.

38
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,330
Why do you ask?

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,800
Episode 17

40
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,760
Were you alive this whole time?

41
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,700
Then why didn't you come back?

42
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,570
- Have a nice day. / - Thank you.

43
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,300
Choi Suhui?

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,360
This is our new roast.

45
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,430
Would you like to try it?

46
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,300
You got a package.

47
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,660
A package for me?

48
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,630
Yes.

49
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,630
Take it.

50
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,200
Sure.

51
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,960
Who is it from?

52
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,660
Is it from your wife?

53
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,000
No, I don't know who this is.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,300
You don't know who it's from?
No, I don't know who this is.

55
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,370
You don't know who it's from?

56
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,660
Maybe there's been a mistake.

57
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:13,670
Look.

58
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,830
It has your name on it. Kim Chunsik.

59
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,460
See?

60
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,470
But I don't know who it's from.

61
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,430
Well, open it first.

62
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,430
See what it is.

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Oh!

64
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,460
Who'd do such a thing?

65
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,470
Are you sure you don't know who it is?

66
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,000
I really don't.

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,400
That's strange.
I really don't.

68
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,430
That's strange.

69
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,960
Jieun.

70
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,070
The package probably arrived by now.

71
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,930
Thanks.

72
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,200
I got $5 off the delivery fee, so it was $15.

73
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,600
You can keep the rest.

74
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,330
Thanks.

75
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,330
If you need any more help,

76
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,260
just let me know.

77
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,260
Okay, bye.

78
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,460
Okay.

79
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,030
Hey, Jieun.

80
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,730
What?

81
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,740
That guy's been staring at you for a while.

82
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,600
I think he likes you.

83
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,100
Wipe it.

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What's up with him?

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,010
Oh...

86
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,860
It's yours.

87
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,160
Wipe your face off.

88
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,000
Do you like me?

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,500
What?
Do you like me?

90
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:34,870
What?

91
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,360
If you like me, then stop.

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,770
Why?

93
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,160
Because I can't help you in any way.

94
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,500
I'm fine with that.

95
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,060
I still can't?

96
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,070
You can't.

97
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,330
Did you meet with the informant?

98
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,030
Yeah.

99
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,000
Did you find him?

100
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,100
It was a false tip.
Did you find him?

101
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,800
It was a false tip.

102
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,900
Again?

103
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,230
We keep getting tips

104
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,000
from anyone with the slightest suspicions.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,100
I'm not sure if that's such a good thing.
from anyone with the slightest suspicions.

106
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,630
I'm not sure if that's such a good thing.

107
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,460
Well, the reward is quite substantial.

108
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,470
This happened with Jeong Jinuk too.

109
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,000
We got a lot of tips then too.

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,400
I thought it'd help us find him sooner.
We got a lot of tips then too.

111
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,300
I thought it'd help us find him sooner.

112
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,330
Me too.

113
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,960
Seongil hasn't come in yet?

114
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,330
He just comes in whenever he pleases.

115
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,660
He only comes in when he feels like it.

116
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,660
Let him be.

117
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,000
He's not very useful anyhow.

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,200
Don't let him distract you from your work.
He's not very useful anyhow.

119
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,360
Don't let him distract you from your work.

120
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,030
Fine.

121
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,430
Will you make me some coffee?

122
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,760
We're out of coffee.

123
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,000
Then get me some water.

124
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,030
Okay.

125
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,060
Just get it yourself.

126
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,600
That's not fair!

127
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
Chiwung and I already planned everything.

128
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,910
I told you, not Jeju-do.

129
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,000
Shoot it in the studio!

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,500
Why are you being so stubborn?
Shoot it in the studio!

131
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,170
Why are you being so stubborn?

132
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,000
Did you have a honeymoon planned?

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,500
What?
Did you have a honeymoon planned?

134
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,100
What?

135
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,830
That's not even funny.

136
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,860
We wanted to go abroad,

137
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,730
but we settled for Jeju-do.

138
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,560
This isn't fair.

139
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,530
You went to Jeju-do last year.

140
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,800
That's because Jeju-do is awesome.

141
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,000
Let's do something different this time.

142
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,200
Thrifty vacations, that kind of thing.
Let's do something different this time.

143
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,430
Thrifty vacations, that kind of thing.

144
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,800
That's Yangsun's specialty.

145
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,260
Keep your mouth shut.

146
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,000
Yangsun, cover it with Chiwung.

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,300
What? What did you say?
Yangsun, cover it with Chiwung.

148
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,730
What? What did you say?

149
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,030
I don't want to.

150
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,660
Can't you two work it out?

151
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,600
How can you do this to us?

152
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
I'm your boss.

153
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,130
Suri, you're out.

154
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,000
Yangsun, you're in.

155
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,670
Did you put her up to this?

156
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,000
Why would I do that? Are you insane?

157
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,200
I'm being tossed around back and forth.
Why would I do that? Are you insane?

158
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,860
I'm being tossed around back and forth.

159
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,630
If we were partners, there'd be no problems.

160
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,800
Right?

161
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,260
I'm not so sure.

162
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,000
In any case, those are your assignments.

163
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,010
Dismissed.
In any case, those are your assignments.

164
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:10,100
In any case, those are your assignments.

165
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,330
What's with that look?

166
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,330
I hate your guts.

167
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,030
Suri!

168
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,000
What did I do?

169
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,500
Maybe they're really dating.
What did I do?

170
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,010
Maybe they're really dating.

171
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't want to work with Yangsun, either.

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,200
Is that true?
I don't want to work with Yangsun, either.

173
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,460
Is that true?

174
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,660
Of course.

175
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,770
After working with someone as nice as you,

176
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,000
when I think about working with Yangsun,

177
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,100
my head already starts to ache.
when I think about working with Yangsun,

178
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,530
my head already starts to ache.

179
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,600
I know!

180
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,830
It's so stressful to work

181
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,000
with someone you hate.

182
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,300
What if you get cancer?
with someone you hate.

183
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,170
What if you get cancer?

184
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,630
I don't think it'll come to that.

185
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,960
You don't know her like I do.

186
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,230
You don't know what you're in for.

187
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,560
Is she that bad?

188
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,430
Yes.

189
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,600
When are our models coming?

190
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,800
Soon.

191
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,730
Are those all the props we have?

192
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,560
No, there's more.

193
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,060
Have you done a shoot before?

194
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,800
This is my first time.

195
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,660
I've done so many shoots over the years.

196
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,660
Swimwear, too.

197
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,000
We're doing a vacation shoot.

198
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,100
Is this the right place?
We're doing a vacation shoot.

199
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,000
Is this the right place?

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,010
Are you here for the shoot?

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,960
Yes.

202
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,230
This is the spot.

203
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,360
Follow me.

204
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,540
What?

205
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,560
Why take vacation photos here?

206
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,860
It's a backyard summer party concept.

207
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,630
Just take the shots the way I explained.

208
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,630
I'm the photographer.

209
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,640
I don't have to take orders from you.

210
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,660
I know you're the photographer.

211
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,530
It's not like you're a judge.

212
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,900
If you don't like it, go study for the bar.

213
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,870
Now you're not going to take the shots?

214
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,030
No. I'll take the shots.

215
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,160
But I'm going to do it my way.

216
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,170
I get what you mean now.

217
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,770
Fine.

218
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,960
The models are here.

219
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,900
You again?

220
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,900
Are you a model now?

221
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,860
Yeah, so?

222
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,000
What is it that you do exactly?

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,200
That's none of your business.
What is it that you do exactly?

224
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,400
That's none of your business.

225
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,630
Why is this set so lousy?

226
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,900
Who hired you for this job?

227
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,630
I did.

228
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,570
Suri, it was you?

229
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah.

230
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,300
I'm trying to be a good neighbor.
Yeah.

231
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,970
I'm trying to be a good neighbor.

232
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,930
I thought I'd be working with Suri.

233
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,460
Do I have to work with her then?

234
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,400
Yes.

235
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,600
But what brings you here?

236
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,930
I was checking to see how it was going.

237
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,730
It figures.

238
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,160
Yangsun, this is totally your style.

239
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
We're going to start right away,

240
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,270
so go get changed.

241
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,670
Where do I get changed?

242
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,930
Do you see our car?

243
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,030
You can change in there.

244
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,800
Oh come on. This is embarrassing.

245
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,330
Isn't it hot today?

246
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,230
Take some.

247
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,060
Don't you need to prepare?

248
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,430
I will.

249
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,000
You're busy. Go ahead.

250
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,060
I'll be fine on my own.

251
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,630
Okay then.

252
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,460
Did you hire that guy

253
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,630
just to mess with me?

254
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,060
Of course not.

255
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,600
He's trying to become a star.

256
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
He even studied modeling.

257
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,960
What's your problem?

258
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,000
The weather's already getting on my nerves.

259
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,100
Why are you fanning the flames?
The weather's already getting on my nerves.

260
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,500
Why are you fanning the flames?

261
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Now I have two issues to deal with!

262
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,660
You're right about one thing,

263
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,430
but you're wrong about the other.

264
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,430
Stop acting like a little kid.

265
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,660
I'm not interested in that guy.

266
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,670
He's not interested in you, either.

267
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,000
So why are you doing this to me?

268
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I didn't volunteer for this job.

269
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,170
Because it's hot.

270
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,000
What?

271
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,500
Can't you see I'm fuming?
What?

272
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,100
Can't you see I'm fuming?

273
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Hey!

274
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,700
What?

275
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,330
They want a new elevator?

276
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,000
And the bathrooms fixed?

277
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,030
A full remodeling of the building?

278
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,340
Are they insane?

279
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,940
I can't. Tell them that I can't!

280
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,130
The building's forty years old,

281
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,260
so we have to do something.

282
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,600
Or else, everyone's going to leave.

283
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,330
Let them leave!

284
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,340
But if they all leave,

285
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,240
we won't get any new tenants.

286
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,660
Who'd want to move into this building?

287
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,960
Decide whether you'll do the repairs or not.

288
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,830
The tenants are waiting for you.

289
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,860
Fine.

290
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm already in the red.

291
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,430
They're out to ruin me.

292
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,130
Ugh.

293
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,430
Where did Hwangtae go?

294
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,760
Just when I need him the most...

295
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,060
I should've been more intimidating.

296
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,630
I was too weak.

297
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,630
Next time, I'll have

298
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,830
them shaking in their boots.

299
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,370
Scrooge

300
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,900
He was the one who asked me to leave.

301
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,000
Why does he keep calling me?

302
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,100
He should've been nicer to me back then.
Why does he keep calling me?

303
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,430
He should've been nicer to me back then.

304
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,360
So he wants to cut all ties with me now?

305
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,630
Good afternoon, boss.

306
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,930
What brings you here?

307
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,930
Where's Hwangtae?

308
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,000
Why do you ask?

309
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,300
I can't reach him.
Why do you ask?

310
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,370
I can't reach him.

311
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,000
He quit.

312
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,200
I knew it.
He quit.

313
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,030
I knew it.

314
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,860
Is he in trouble?

315
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,930
Yeah.

316
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:14,960
How deep?

317
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,630
$20,000.

318
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:20,160
That's why he...

319
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,170
Are you in contact with him?

320
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,730
I need him for a job,

321
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,740
but he won't pick up my calls.

322
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,960
That little...

323
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,700
He's a gambling addict.

324
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,700
Why would you give him money?

325
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,330
I know, right?

326
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,060
That little...

327
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,430
If you don't call me back,

328
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,860
I'm going meet with your mother.

329
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,330
What am I going to do?

330
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,360
I found a way to get some money.

331
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,430
Give me time.

332
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,430
I'll pay you back for sure.

333
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,000
What did he say?

334
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,300
He told me to wait.
What did he say?

335
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,670
He told me to wait.

336
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,060
He found a way to make money.

337
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,300
A way to make money?

338
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,460
You did a shoot for a magazine?

339
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,330
Yes.

340
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,600
My phone's been ringing off the hook.

341
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
I guess I've just got that look.

342
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,830
But I do have other important work to do.

343
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,060
Other work?

344
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,640
I'll explain later.

345
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,540
About Chunsik.

346
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,600
I'm going to invite him

347
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,530
for dinner on his day off.

348
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,560
You don't have to do that.

349
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,560
There's a lot that I owe him for.

350
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,960
It's just dinner, what's the big deal?

351
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,460
Wouldn't it be awkward?

352
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,000
Of course not.

353
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,200
He's living on his own,
Of course not.

354
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,000
He's living on his own,

355
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,030
if we invite him over, it'll make him happy.

356
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,860
Doesn't he have any family?

357
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,600
I'm not sure.

358
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,330
He doesn't have a wife or kids?

359
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,800
He doesn't talk about himself.

360
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,730
So I don't know either.

361
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,160
Who's Chunsik?

362
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,030
The guy who works at mom's cafe.

363
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,000
Chunsik must be a common name.

364
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,500
Sherlock is looking for a missing person
Chunsik must be a common name.

365
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,000
Sherlock is looking for a missing person

366
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,330
named Chunsik, Kim Chunsik.

367
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,900
That man's name is also Kim Chunsik?

368
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,130
Yeah.

369
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,330
How did that man go missing?

370
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,330
He has Alzheimer's.

371
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,530
He looked about the same age as Mr. Kim.

372
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,900
He's young. It's sad.

373
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,630
Does Chunsik have Alzheimer's?

374
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,160
What do you mean?

375
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,930
Do you know anything about his past?

376
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,160
No, you don't.

377
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,830
That's because he won't tell us.

378
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,000
Maybe he can't talk about it.

379
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,500
Because he lost his memory.
Maybe he can't talk about it.

380
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,570
Because he lost his memory.

381
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,600
Jieun may be on to something.

382
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,230
There's no way.

383
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,130
In any case, he's suspicious.

384
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,430
Don't say that.

385
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,960
Just eat your food.

386
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,830
Maybe there's been a mistake.

387
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:18,730
Look.

388
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,740
It has your name on it. Kim Chunsik.

389
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,900
See?

390
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,460
But I don't know who it's from.

391
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,760
Is Jieun right?

392
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,530
No, there's no way.

393
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,030
What are you doing?

394
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,630
I was just thinking about something.

395
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,530
No, it can't be.

396
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,560
I'm home.

397
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,000
Hey.

398
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,100
Do you know what this is?
Hey.

399
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,560
Do you know what this is?

400
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,060
What?

401
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,700
Coffee mugs.

402
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,830
Aren't they pretty?

403
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,200
You bought new ones?

404
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,710
I always have to buy cute coffee mugs.

405
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:34,000
It'd be so nice to have coffee with that man.

406
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,400
How much did you save up for your wedding?
It'd be so nice to have coffee with that man.

407
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,010
How much did you save up for your wedding?

408
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Why do you ask?

409
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,960
I was just wondering.

410
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,170
I can't.

411
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,470
I can't give away that money.

412
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,370
I worked so hard to save up.

413
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,070
Don't even think about it.

414
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,370
Do you understand?

415
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,100
I didn't say anything.

416
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,030
I wonder who took it.

417
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,260
I'm sure it would have won the grand prize

418
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,270
if it had just made it through the first round.

419
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,870
Are you working?

420
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
Yeah.

421
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,130
What is it?

422
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,460
Yangsun.

423
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,430
Do you have any money saved up?

424
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,600
I haven't saved anything.

425
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,430
I'm busy paying off our debts.

426
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,130
I know. I shouldn't have asked.

427
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,230
But, why did you ask?

428
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:53,030
Do you think we can take out a loan?

429
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:56,930
Probably not another one.

430
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,960
What's up? Did something happen?

431
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,730
No, it's nothing.

432
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:02,860
Nothing?

433
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,000
You're asking for money. What's up?

434
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,500
It's no big deal.
You're asking for money. What's up?

435
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,130
It's no big deal.

436
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,600
Forget about what I said.

437
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,660
I'm sorry if I interrupted you.

438
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,300
Get back to work.

439
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,670
What is it this time?

440
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,000
What's all that?

441
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,500
I don't know.
What's all that?

442
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,010
I don't know.

443
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,670
It came from Yeonggwang-gun.

444
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,070
Oh, it's a package from my folks.

445
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,030
Your folks?

446
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,000
Yeah, we live in Yeonggwang-gun.

447
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,400
It's croaker fish.
Yeah, we live in Yeonggwang-gun.

448
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,170
It's croaker fish.

449
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,760
This is all croaker fish?

450
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,630
Yes.

451
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,000
I told my mom I'm living at a friend's house

452
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,200
so she sent this to us.
I told my mom I'm living at a friend's house

453
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,530
so she sent this to us.

454
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,740
She said she'll keep sending more to us

455
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,360
so please eat to your heart's content.

456
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,530
Your mother is so generous!

457
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:00,000
Everyone in our family has a big appetite.

458
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,500
You all have big appetites?
Everyone in our family has a big appetite.

459
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,930
You all have big appetites?

460
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,000
I told them to send rice too.

461
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,400
So don't worry.
I told them to send rice too.

462
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,130
So don't worry.

463
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,000
My family runs a rice field.

464
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,300
You don't have to do that.
My family runs a rice field.

465
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,330
You don't have to do that.

466
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,130
Can I put this in the kitchen?

467
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,900
Sure.

468
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,930
Mom, we can eat croaker fish now?

469
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,000
Yes, he said we could eat it too.

470
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,400
We'll get free rice and croaker fish.
Yes, he said we could eat it too.

471
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,830
We'll get free rice and croaker fish.

472
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,560
He's not just a renter.

473
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,570
He's a blessing!

474
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,800
Croaker fish?

475
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So stop nagging Segi about his eating habits.

476
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,770
He brought his own food...

477
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,000
He brought enough food for the whole family.

478
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,500
Does he really eat that much?
He brought enough food for the whole family.

479
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,230
Does he really eat that much?

480
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,730
They had to send us a box of croaker fish?

481
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,000
In any case...

482
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,400
In any case, Segi must have felt guilty
In any case...

483
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,030
In any case, Segi must have felt guilty

484
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,130
about all the food he was eating.

485
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,060
That's probably why he called his folks.

486
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,430
I guess he's got a conscience after all.

487
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,460
Thanks to him,

488
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:09,930
our family can eat all the croaker fish we want.

489
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:16,940
Ask him if they grow peppers or beans.

490
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,700
Why?

491
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,830
So we can get those for free too.

492
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,240
What's wrong with you?

493
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,930
I told you, I'm not doing it.

494
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:32,330
Don't be like that. Do it for my sake.

495
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,700
I'm not doing any interviews.

496
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,260
Ms. Choe's pressuring me so hard.

497
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,260
Just help me out this one time.

498
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,000
How is she pressuring you?

499
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,300
She's making me partner up with Yangsun.
How is she pressuring you?

500
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,270
She's making me partner up with Yangsun.

501
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,000
She's only doing it to punish me.

502
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,260
Do you hate that girl that much?

503
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,000
She's scary.

504
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,130
I thought she was pretty cute.

505
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,230
What's wrong with your eyesight?

506
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,000
You think she's cute?

507
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,100
She looked cute to me.
You think she's cute?

508
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,930
She looked cute to me.

509
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:03,060
In any case, help a friend in need.

510
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,960
Do the interview.

511
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,000
Is it that bad?

512
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,400
Yeah.
Is it that bad?

513
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,370
Yeah.

514
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,770
Good morning.

515
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,060
Sure.

516
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,130
I guess nobody's here yet.

517
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,130
Yup.

518
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,770
I printed the pictures.

519
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,430
They're better than I expected.

520
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,130
That's why you should do as I say.

521
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,060
My experience is valuable.

522
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,000
I wasn't trying to ignore you.

523
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,400
I was just upset that our plans had changed.
I wasn't trying to ignore you.

524
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,670
I was just upset that our plans had changed.

525
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,030
I know you don't like working with me.

526
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,430
But we have to work.

527
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,430
So let's not burden each other.

528
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,530
You said it yourself.

529
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,060
Let's try to get along.

530
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,070
Sure.

531
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,230
I was going to get some coffee.

532
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,030
Do you want some?

533
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,330
Sure, if you want.

534
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,330
Hold on.

535
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,700
I had to try so hard not to yell at him.

536
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,570
Why is she being so nice all of a sudden?

537
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,200
That's even more terrifying.

538
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,000
Ms. Choe, you're here!

539
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,300
Yeah.
Ms. Choe, you're here!

540
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,670
Yeah.

541
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,000
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

542
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,200
No. I don't drink vending machine coffee.
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

543
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,000
No. I don't drink vending machine coffee.

544
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I see.

545
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,470
Oh, right! I think it'll work out.

546
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:24,770
What will?

547
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,000
Segi's interview.

548
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,500
Are you serious?
Segi's interview.

549
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,570
Are you serious?

550
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,130
I begged him and so he changed his mind.

551
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,710
Really?

552
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,000
Yes.

553
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,100
I think you can go ahead with it now.
Yes.

554
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,800
I think you can go ahead with it now.

555
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,530
Okay. Thank you.

556
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,960
It was nothing.

557
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,230
Should I make an appointment now?

558
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,430
No.

559
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,000
If I go now,

560
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,300
it'll make me look desperate.
If I go now,

561
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,730
it'll make me look desperate.

562
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,660
I'll let him wait.

563
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,160
Has she come in yet?

564
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,660
What are you doing?

565
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,830
Oh, you're here.

566
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,830
Thanks to you, the shoot went well.

567
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,060
Well, if you say so.

568
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,930
I wanted to buy you a meal to thank you.

569
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,930
When are you free?

570
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,140
That's okay. You don't have to do that.

571
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,030
Oh, but I insist.

572
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,010
If that's the case, buy a meal for him.

573
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,260
I didn't take the photos, he did.

574
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,560
What?

575
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,830
What were you talking about?

576
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,000
Forget about it.

577
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,300
I think she asked you to buy me a meal.
Forget about it.

578
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,530
I think she asked you to buy me a meal.

579
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,960
I told you to forget about it.

580
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,060
He's so rude.

581
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,070
She's not easy.

582
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,430
How can I make her my baby?

583
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Why didn't you come in yesterday?

584
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,010
I had other work to do.

585
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,700
I told you I'd be wandering about.

586
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,430
But you should show your face at least.

587
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:07,030
Or call in and say you can't make it.

588
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,930
Does he have a crush on me?

589
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,360
Am I wrong?

590
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,000
Fine.

591
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,700
How's work coming along?

592
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,230
Why isn't she studying?

593
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,060
Don't worry. Get back to your studies.

594
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:35,030
Fine. I better act like I'm working.

595
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,800
Do you want something cold to drink?

596
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,360
Oh, that's all right.

597
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,000
Why is this place so empty?

598
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,300
When it gets busy, it gets really busy.
Why is this place so empty?

599
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,470
When it gets busy, it gets really busy.

600
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,700
I know you're doing this as a hobby,

601
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,830
but still, you're running a business.

602
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,900
It's fine. We're not in the red.

603
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,130
I'm not going to get greedy.

604
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:26,330
I don't know how you became such a softy.

605
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,830
It must be nice to have free time.

606
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,840
Oh, you're here.

607
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,000
There aren't any customers.

608
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,200
Just come outside.
There aren't any customers.

609
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,430
Just come outside.

610
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,800
Why are you hiding back there?

611
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,760
I feel more comfortable here.

612
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,230
You're a unique fella.

613
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:55,000
What do you do on your days off?

614
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,500
I do the chores that I've been putting off.
What do you do on your days off?

615
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,300
I do the chores that I've been putting off.

616
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,930
I head to the saunas.

617
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,760
I read.

618
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,770
It makes time go by rather quickly.

619
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,730
Really?

620
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:10,030
We should go to the sauna together.

621
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,000
That sounds good.

622
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,500
Okay.
That sounds good.

623
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,370
Okay.

624
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,630
Oh that reminds me.

625
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,640
Come over for dinner on Sunday.

626
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,540
Oh, that's all right.

627
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,860
It doesn't have to be awkward.

628
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,600
We've known each other for a while now.

629
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,000
It doesn't seem like you have a family.

630
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,100
Just come over and we'll treat you like family.
It doesn't seem like you have a family.

631
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:40,130
Just come over and we'll treat you like family.

632
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:44,260
Thank you for being so kind.

633
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,000
I've been living alone for a long time,

634
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,500
so I totally understand how you feel.
I've been living alone for a long time,

so I totally understand how you feel.

636
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,960
Where are you?

637
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,000
If you're alive, why won't you come back?

638
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,100
Did you hate me that much?
If you're alive, why won't you come back?

639
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,760
Did you hate me that much?

640
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,600
Even if you did,

641
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,760
what about Yangsun?

642
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,770
Yangsun misses you so much.

643
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,200
Did you leave me for a woman?

644
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,230
What are you doing in the dark?

645
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,700
Are you drinking?

646
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,030
Do you want some?

647
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,900
No.

648
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,860
Did something happen?

649
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,800
You've been acting strange lately.

650
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,960
I told you, I'm fine.

651
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,000
She's acting strange.

652
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,200
There's definitely something going on.
She's acting strange.

653
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,010
There's definitely something going on.

654
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,970
What's eating at you?

655
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,900
Tell me.

656
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,960
Yeongsuk!

657
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,760
Eunsuk.

658
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,630
What?

659
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:52,060
I know I shouldn't ask you this

660
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,530
but can I borrow

661
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:01,460
the money you saved for your wedding?

662
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,000
What?

663
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,100
I know I shouldn't be asking.
What?

664
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,000
I know I shouldn't be asking.

665
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,770
But please.

666
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:14,160
Will you please help me one last time?

667
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,000
How could you?

668
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,100
Eunsuk.
How could you?

669
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,700
Eunsuk.

670
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,760
I gave up on my education and

671
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,700
opened a clothing store to pay off your debts.

672
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,360
I couldn't make ends meet as a teacher,

673
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,360
so I gave up my dream

674
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,430
of becoming a professor.

675
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,860
I know that.

676
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,800
But I never blamed you for it.

677
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,630
Because Dongjun paid for my college tuition.

678
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,000
I knew I had to pay for Yangsun's education.

679
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,500
So I worked like a dog
I knew I had to pay for Yangsun's education.

680
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,010
So I worked like a dog

681
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,800
to pay off all those expenses.

682
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,860
I know all that.

683
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,000
So how can you ask me for more?

684
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,230
You know how much I gave up.

685
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,060
How can you ask me for more?

686
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,300
How can you do this to me?

687
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,230
I don't know what's going on, but...

688
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,460
At this point, I don't even want to know.

689
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,860
It's my turn to live my life.

690
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,130
I'm not asking you because I want to.

691
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,600
This is killing me inside.

692
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,160
Will you stop saying that?

693
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,430
You haven't changed one bit!

694
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,240
What is it?

695
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,170
What's going on?

696
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,330
Ask your mother.

697
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,900
I don't know anymore.

698
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,630
Tell me the truth.

699
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,700
Is something going on?

700
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,730
Yangsun.

701
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,130
Yeah?

702
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,830
Mom.

703
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,000
Let's move out.

704
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,400
Move out?
Let's move out.

705
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,670
Move out?

706
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,230
Let's sell this house

707
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,200
and start a new life somewhere else.

708
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,330
Do you get it?

709
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,160
You have to earn money.

710
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,170
Don't you dare try to mooch off your brother.

711
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,000
I can party too.

712
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,500
And I can be sexy.
I can party too.

713
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,130
And I can be sexy.

714
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,000
Back off.

715
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,500
What?
Back off.

716
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,000
What?

717
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,970
When we first met,

718
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,460
you were trying to kill yourself.

719
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,800
Why were you doing that?

720
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,000
I thought it was all over.

721
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,760
But it never seems to end.

722
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,000
Then how much do you need?

723
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,400
Mom, you can't deal with a guy like that.
Then how much do you need?

724
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,000
Mom, you can't deal with a guy like that.

725
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I'll meet him and figure this out.
