1
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:52,551
Magic is the word
that comes to mind for me

2
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,020
when I think of Muscle Shoals.

3
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:59,058
It's about alchemy,
it's about turning metal,

4
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,095
the iron in the ground,
the rust, into gold.

5
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:04,496
You just have to listen.

6
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,298
And you will be transported.

7
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,233
You will be changed.

8
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,702
You're gonna hear
some of the greatest voices

9
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,271
that ever were.

10
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:16,642
One, two, three!

11
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:21,747
One, two, three.

12
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,582
Ow!

13
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:24,616

All right!

15
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:27,352

♪ Ohh, help me

42
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:38,557
We started to hear
this sound coming out.

43
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,893
There was an amazing feel.

44
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:46,365
Kind of, uh, magnetic,
I suppose in a way, sound wise.

45
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:50,569
And then after a while,
this word, "Muscle Shoals"

46
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:53,972
comes into the picture,
and you put two and two together

47
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:57,142
and that was when I said,
"If we get the chance,

48
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,611
we got to go down there,"
you know.

49
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,853
People now still ask me,
"What is it about

50
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,088
Muscle Shoals?"

51
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,659
It's just a little village
on the Alabama border.

52
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:17,930
Why does that music
come out of there?

53
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:21,166
It's an enigma.

54
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:25,637
How did so much music
take place

55
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,342
in such an undescript
little town?

56
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,878
There was just something
about that place,

57
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,216
something that still
to this day nobody can explain.

58
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:42,754
At different points in time,
on this planet,

59
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:47,859
there are certain places

60
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:51,930
where there is a field
of energy.

61
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:56,101
At this certain point in time
for this number of years,

62
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,503
there was Muscle Shoals.

63
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:05,444
It's a unique thing,
rooms and record-making

64
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:08,280
like that, it doesn't happen
very often.

65
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:12,184
It's usually somebody like
Rick Hall that's like

66
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:15,454
a type of maniac.

67
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:19,124
With the drive and the foresight
to do it, you know,

68
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,860
and he's a tough guy.

69
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,283
This area here is where
my roots are.

70
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:49,154
And it's helped me develop
into whatever I am today.

71
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,990
My father was a sawmiller

72
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:55,260
and we lived way out
in the Freedom Hills.

73
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,362
No houses, no neighbors.

74
00:04:57,364 --> 00:05:00,499
No kids to play with.

75
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:03,368
The floor in our house
was dirt.

76
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,905
The heater was made
out of an oil drum.

77
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,841
We slept on straw beds
made out of straw

78
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:14,780
that we pulled up
in the fields.

79
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:19,718
We had no bathing facilities,
no toilets, nothing.

80
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,590
And we just kind of grew up
like animals.

81
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:35,734
That made me a little bitter.

82
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,937
Somewhat driven.

83
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,907
I wanted to be special.

84
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:44,409
I wanted to be somebody.

85
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:02,627
♪ Can you slip away,
slip away ♪

86
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:06,098
♪ Slip away, yeah

87
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,701
♪ Oh, I need you so

88
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,906
The first record I cut
in this studio

89
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:18,043
was a record called
"Steal Away" by Jimmy Hughes.

90
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,611
Brand new building.

91
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,446
And I was hoping it had
the magic.

92
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:22,781
I didn't know.

93
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,850
So I brought my band in,
and I went up

94
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:27,319
in the control room
and sat down.

95
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,754
Okay, all set?

96
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:31,423
I turned on the microphones
and nervously hit

97
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:32,991
the talk-back button
to the musicians

98
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:37,662
and said with a slight crackle
in my voice, "Rolling."

99
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:42,667
One, two, one, two,
three, four.

100
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,205
When they kicked off
"Steal Away,"

101
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:52,711
I sat behind the console
and wept.

102
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:56,181
I just had huge chill bumps
come up on my arms.

103
00:06:56,183 --> 00:07:00,819
And the hair on the back
of my neck actually stood up.

104
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:04,222
And of course,
this was the birth

105
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:07,159
of the Muscle Shoals sound.

112
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:37,889
I've heard entertainers
and producers tell me

113
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,858
that we got some kind
of sound here

114
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,127
that they can't get
anywhere else.

115
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,862
They have to come here.

116
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:47,933
It's that oh, deep down
into your stomach,

117
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,701
coming up out of your gut,

118
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,636
coming up out of your heart.

119
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,573
There's that
Muscle Shoals sound.

125
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,669
That sound made it through
to even Ireland

126
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,905
and Britain.

127
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,908
And we felt the blood in that.

128
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,778
We felt the...
the sort of pulse of it.

129
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,048
And we wanted some, you know?

130
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,855
You gotta understand
that Muscle Shoals

131
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,757
had its own kind of R&B.

132
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,660
Different from Memphis,
different from Detroit,

133
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,129
different from New York,
different from L.A.

134
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,764
How did it happen
in this little town

135
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:56,067
of 8,000 people,
to start this whole style

136
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,136
of music?

137
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,375
It always seems
to come out of the river.

138
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,877
You know, even in Liverpool,

139
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,647
you know, the Mersey sound.

140
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,516
And then of course,
Mississippi.

141
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:14,886
And here you have
the Tennessee River.

142
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,789
It's like the songs
come out of the mud.

143
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,216
We're at a place
called Ishatae.

144
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,786
It means it's a special place,
a holy place.

145
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,889
It's a place of music.

146
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,658
And it's a place of people.

147
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,860
I've been working on it
for 32 years.

148
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:59,598
There's over eight million
pounds of stones here.

149
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,102
It's a memorial to
my great-great-grandmother.

150
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:09,174
She was an American Indian,
and her people were Euchee.

151
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:11,009
My grandmother's people
called this river

152
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:13,111
that we call the Tennessee
today, they called it

153
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,880
Nunnuhsae, the river
that sings.

154
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,482
They believed a young woman
lived in the river,

155
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:20,118
sang songs to 'em,
and protected 'em.

156
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,993
In the year 1839,
my great-great-grandmother

157
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:31,296
was removed from right here
in Muscle Shoals.

158
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,964
She was taken to
the Indian Nations,

159
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,968
what is now present-day
Muskogee, Oklahoma.

160
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,870
When Grandmother got out there
to Oklahoma,

161
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,438
she said there were no songs.

162
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,674
She went and listened to all
the streams she could find

163
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:45,844
and there were no songs.

164
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:48,213
They couldn't sing,
they couldn't dance.

165
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:51,750
They couldn't hold
their ceremonies.

166
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:55,220
And they got to be
very sad people.

167
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,856
So, she started
to come back home.

168
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:00,592
She walked all the way back.

169
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:03,161
It took her roughly five years.

170
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,868
She had to come back
to this river.

171
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,671
The river that sings.

172
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:16,241
The great dams have softened
the woman in the river's songs,

173
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:18,710
but if you go to very quiet
places and listen,

174
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:20,578
you can still hear her songs.

175
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,049
I know; I hear her songs
nearly every day.

176
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,924
When I was a young man, starting
out in the music business,

177
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,827
Billy Sherrill and I,
who were writing partners,

178
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,996
got a phone call from
a guy that wanted

179
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,298
to start a publishing
company with us,

180
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,936
and had the sum of $500
to spend on us,

181
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:48,139
which we thought was
a gold mine.

182
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:52,977
So, Tom Stafford
was a dream come true.

183
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:56,181
We went in business
and we had a little bitty studio

184
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:59,350
over Tom's father's drugstore.

185
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,422
We got a few cuts,
made a few bucks,

186
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,192
and one day, I was called in
to a meeting with Billy and Tom

187
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:09,094
and they advised me that
they were not happy

188
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:11,196
with the way things
were going and thought

189
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:14,766
that I was a little too much
of a workaholic.

190
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,936
And said that they wanted
to have fun

191
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,871
while they were having
hit records,

192
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,673
and that I was just too adamant

193
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:24,576
and too, uh,
strong-willed

194
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,844
and too pushy.

195
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:29,414
So, they decided to...
to let me go.

196
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,919
So, I obviously went home,
began to lick my wounds,

197
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,289
and was very bitter.

198
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,663
During this time,
I worked at a place called

199
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:49,134
Reynolds Metals Company
in Muscle Shoals, Alabama.

200
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:53,037
And I married my first wife,
Faye Marie, there.

201
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,074
She and I had been married
about 18 months

202
00:12:56,076 --> 00:13:01,913
and we went to Hamilton
to see Benny Martin in concert.

203
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:05,016
It was about sundown,
and I met a car

204
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,785
who was traveling very fast.

205
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,953
I swerved to go around
that car.

206
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,689
I hit some loose gravels
on the side of the road

207
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:14,192
and went into a spin,
a tailspin.

208
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:17,495
The car turned end over end
a couple, three times,

209
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,364
and landed on its top.

210
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,833
I didn't know if she was out
or in, but couldn't find her

211
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:24,102
in the car, it was
total darkness.

212
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:28,039
I began to yell for her
and couldn't hear any noise,

213
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,775
except I could hear
gasoline running out

214
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:33,812
of the gas tank
into the car somewhere.

215
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,848
And I thought, of course,
it's gonna be my death

216
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,850
because the car's
gonna catch fire

217
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:42,253
and I can't get out.

218
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,756
I got out of the car
and searched around

219
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:49,160
in kudzu vines up to here.

220
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,696
Finally, some people stopped
with a flashlight

221
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,331
and we found her.

222
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,967
I nursed her on the way
to Hamilton Hospital.

223
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,468
About two o'clock
in the morning,

224
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,172
the doctor came to me and said,
"Your wife has passed on."

225
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:08,112
And, of course, I freaked out.

226
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:11,316
I became a drunk, a vagabond.

227
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,551
A tramp.

228
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:21,092
That changed my whole life.

229
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,567
It was hard times
and all I had to cling to

230
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,002
was my music.

231
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,971
I slept in my car.

232
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:35,073
I ate in my car.

233
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,775
And I wrote songs in my car.

234
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:40,879
But I continued playing music
and it was the only love I had

235
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:44,349
at that time, and, so...

236
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:49,287
I joined a little
local band in Hamilton.

237
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,122
From that time on,
for five years,

238
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:57,762
I wrote songs, played music,

239
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,164
and chased the women.

240
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:07,972
♪ Somebody loan me a dime ♪

241
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:15,113
♪ I need to call my
old time, used to be ♪

242
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:19,083
All this gravitated towards,
what am I gonna do

243
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,119
with the rest of my life
and I decided

244
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,520
to come back to Muscle Shoals,

245
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,523
but this time I came back
with a vengeance.

246
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:28,126
I came back with a determination
that I was gonna

247
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,428
kick some ass
and take some names.

248
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:36,200
And I was going to make it
in the music business.

249
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:41,472
And so I set up shop in a little
candy and tobacco warehouse.

250
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,574
I closed the doors,
I hid my car.

251
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,376
I didn't talk to girls,
I didn't make dates,

252
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:48,646
I didn't do anything
except write songs

253
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:51,716
and I was totally obsessed
with the business.

254
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:55,320
And so shortly after that,
I ran into Arthur Alexander,

255
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,756
who was a local bellhop
at the Sheffield Hotel.

256
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:01,426
And he played me a song
and said, "What do you think?"

257
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:05,330
And I said,
"I think it's a hit."

258
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:06,464
So he said, "What are we gonna
do about it?"

259
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,932
And I said, "We're gonna
cut it."

260
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,268
He said, "When,"
I said, "Tomorrow."

261
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,204
I brought my band in.

262
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,440
Norbert Putnam, David Briggs,

263
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,709
Jerry Carrigan,
Peanut Montgomery,

264
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:20,478
and Terry Thompson were
the first rhythm section

265
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,114
to be in the studio
and to cut a hit record.

266
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:25,950
Now, you gotta realize
Rick Hall is this older man.

267
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:28,219
We're all 18, 19 years old.

268
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,588
Rick's what, 28, 29?

269
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,890
He had the vision
for the recording.

270
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:37,562
Rick made records with
a group of teenage kids, okay,

271
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:41,399
that became hit records,
world-class records.

274
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,982
The very first record,
"You Better Move On"

275
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,550
by Arthur Alexander
that I produced,

276
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,285
I had anything to do
with was a hit.

277
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,254
Not the second or third,
but the first session we cut

278
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,622
was a hit record.

279
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:07,458
I know Rick was determined
to cut that hit

280
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,293
and he did it,
but if he hadn't,

281
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,562
I'm of the opinion
that none of this

282
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,932
Muscle Shoals movement
would have ever happened.

288
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,051
We're gonna do a slow one now,
it's called, uh,

00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,253
"You Better Move On."

290
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,155
It was the only thing
we did like that.

291
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,991
And the girls really adored
this song.

292
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:41,559
It was a big hit for us
in England.

293
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,127
It was our
number-one record.

298
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:56,307
You know, they cut "Anna"
and I think we cut

299
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,709
"Better Move On"
maybe a month later.

300

304
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:14,392
but it's interesting to know

305
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:17,161
one of the first things
that we cut was

306

we all go to Nashville.

317
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:51,496
We were the only game
in town for him to get.

318
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,435
They took the ball
that we started rolling,

319
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,704
and they rolled it
and made it bigger.

320
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:04,408
Individually, I never really
thought we were great players.

321
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,011
But together, we were
great players.

322
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:09,547
We had the magic together.

323
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,653
We liked playing funky.

324
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,822
All funky was was that
we didn't know

325
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,390
how to make it smooth.

326
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,626
We're rock 'n' roll
players, okay?

327
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:24,562
You just didn't expect them
to be as funky

328
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,898
or as greasy as they were.

329
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:32,270
♪ I know a place

330
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,538
♪ Ain't nobody cryin'

331
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,107
The grooves that we set up
came from

332
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,808
rhythm and blues music.

333
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,179
I remember when Paul Simon
called Stax Records,

334
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,880
talked to Al Bell.

335
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:45,616
And said, "Hey, man,
I want those same black players"

336
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:48,553
that played on
'I'll Take You There.'"

337
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,421
He said, "That can happen,
but these guys"

338
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:51,989

339

00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,793

♪ You got to, got to,

342
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,266
A lot of people could not
believe

343
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:05,169
that my whole band
was white guys that played

344
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:06,437
behind me.

345
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,506
People have arrived
at Muscle Shoals

346
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:11,242
expecting to meet
these black dudes,

347
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:12,944
and they're a bunch
of white guys

348
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:15,012
that look like they worked
in the supermarket

349
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,948
around the corner.

350
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:21,285
Muscle Shoals rhythm section:
David Hood, bass player.

351
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,123
Jimmy Johnson, guitar.

352
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,093
Roger Hawkins, drums.

353
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,262
Barry Beckett, keyboard player.

354
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,470
Later on, became known
as the Swampers.

355
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,442
A strong rhythm section
made the difference

356
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:46,877
when you went in the studio
every day with the same pickers

357
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:50,414
and the same players,
and they became a team,

358
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,517
and it was hard to beat that.

359
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,788
We began to bring in
songwriters and musicians,

360
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,325
anybody that wanted
to be in the music business.

361
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:25,916
I guess during high school,
I started going over

362
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,818
to FAME studio.

363
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,922
That was like a melting pot
for songwriters, musicians.

364
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:36,594
I was, as a teenager,
really impressed with all that.

365
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:39,430
I came up here
and I'm just a kid, really.

366
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:42,266
And all these people here
were kids, too.

367
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:44,635
I mean, nobody knew anything.

368
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:55,346
We're just doing our best
to learn how to make records

369
00:21:55,348 --> 00:22:00,985
and learn how to write songs
and learn how to play music.

370
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,235
Most of these guys
around here, including myself,

371
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:20,771
are country people.

372
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,773
We come from the country.

373
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:24,542
Arthur Alexander, Jimmy Hughes,

374
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:27,411
they were the pioneers
as far as the artist goes

375
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:29,213
down here, Percy Sledge.

376
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:33,017
These are just local people.

377
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:36,120
I'm from a small town
called Leighton, right outside

378
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:38,956
of Muscle Shoals.

379
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,858
I was a little guy
working in the field,

380
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,594
choppin' cotton,
singing to the older people

381
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:45,963
in the field that always said
that one day,

382
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:47,965
my voice would be heard
all over the world,

383
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:52,503
but I never thought
that would happen.

384
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:57,041
Percy worked at
the local hospital.

385
00:22:57,043 --> 00:23:00,578
I was a orderly working
with the sick people.

386
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,346
I'd sing a song for 'em,
you know,

387
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:03,914
and they'd go to sleep.

388
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,584
I got such a big kick
out of that, you know,

389
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:09,153
and I could see my patient
layin' up there,

390
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:13,090
smilin', you know,
and feelin' better.

391
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:16,560
So one day I was invited to
sing at the Elks Club

392
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,662
here in Sheffield.

393
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,798
And it just so happened
Quin Ivy,

394
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,000
who was a disc jockey at WLAY,

395
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:24,935
and he heard me sing this song.

396
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:28,305
He loved the melody
and the feel.

397
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:30,708
He said, "Percy Sledge,
have you ever been interested"

398
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,010
in cuttin' a record?"

399
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:34,945
I remember the day
I got the call.

400
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:37,815
"Will you come do keyboards
on this recording session?

401
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:41,519
Be the first recording
this artist has ever done."

402
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:43,654
When I came in to the studio,

403
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:45,356
I was shakin' like a leaf.

404
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:46,557
I was scared.

405
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,695

408
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,072
Every time that he sang
the song,

409
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:05,242
he had different levels
for different parts

410
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:06,911
of the song.

411
00:24:06,913 --> 00:24:09,346
And everything had to be
in your wrist.

412
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:11,282
Bring the level up and down.

413
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,551
All I had was a voice,
I didn't know anything

414
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:16,086
about no singing, you know.

415
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:20,658
Somehow, I got one down,
and Percy was on time with me

416
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,027
with a great vocal.

420
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:40,344
All this was just so new
to me and these guys

421
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:41,979
made me feel like hey, man,

422
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,415
you can do it,
you've got it, you know.

423
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:46,617
I used to call them my family.

424
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:49,153
Donna Thatcher,
all of them, you know.

425
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:53,958
My first wonderful experience
was singing on

426
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,160
"When a Man Loves a Woman"
with Percy Sledge

427
00:24:56,162 --> 00:25:01,065
and you'd never know
when you're making history.

428

♪ Baby, please don't
treat me bad ♪

429
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,108
Quin called me
one Sunday afternoon

430
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,444
and said, "Do you know
of a place we can get a deal?"

431
00:25:13,446 --> 00:25:15,579
And I said, "I think so,"
and I picked up the phone

432
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:17,815
and called Jerry Wexler
in New York.

433
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:21,585
Jerry Wexler was probably
the biggest record company guru

434
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:23,821
in the world.

435
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:27,391
It was a man named Rick Hall
who had a studio

436
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:29,093
in Muscle Shoals.

437
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:31,128
I said, "You told me
if I've heard something"

438
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,630
I thought was a big hit

439
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:34,265
"to call you,
and I'm callin' you."

440
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:36,667
Play a little bit
of this thing here.

441
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:40,304
And I heard some music
coming from there,

442
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:43,307
and it was fabulous.

443
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,608
What do you think?

444
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,577
We pressed and distributed
the record,

445
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:47,878
and that was a big hit.

446

♪ When a man loves a woman ♪

447
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:56,086
That began a great relationship
between Jerry Wexler,

448
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:58,088
Atlantic Records,
and Rick Hall.

449
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,691
And of course, the record's
still one of the most

I, George C. Wallace...

459
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:32,156
During that era of recording
basically all-black acts,

460
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:34,158
you gotta remember that
George Wallace

461
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,859
was standing in
the schoolhouse door

462
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:37,861
at the University of Alabama,

463
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:40,764
making sure that no black people
came to school there.

464
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:45,502
And I say segregation now,
segregation tomorrow,

465
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:47,972
and segregation forever.

466
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:53,110
This was a politics
that could not see

467
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,913
past the color of your skin.

468
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,352
It's the kind of thing
that I know people

469
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:05,823
of this era, they wouldn't want
to believe what it used to be.

470
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:09,026
I think of all the times
when we used to take a break

471
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:11,295
from the studio
to go out and to eat.

472
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:14,331
I was somewhat frightened
from time to time

473
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:18,636
when we'd go and buy dinner
for half a dozen black people.

474
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:23,941
That's where you saw,
like, what are you...

475
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:27,778
what are y'all doin'
sitting there?

476
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,114
Even though the civil rights
movement was already

477
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:33,651
in effect, it still hadn't
dawned on people

478
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:36,220
that this is the new era.

479
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:43,394
I have a dream that one day,

480
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:49,933
down in Alabama
with its vicious racists,

481
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:52,069
one day right there in Alabama,

482
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:54,571
little black boys
and black girls

483
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:57,207
will be able to join hands
with little white boys

484
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:59,643
and white girls
as sisters and brothers.

485
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:01,945
I have a dream today.

486
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,020
When I was a young boy,

487
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:13,123
it was always, uh,
if I met a white boy,

488
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:17,895
I had to say,
"This is Mr. Robert

489
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:20,864
or, uh, Mr. Jimmy."

490
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,701
But... but in the studio,
we got away from that,

491
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:27,538
it was Jimmy, it was Robert,
it was Clarence, you know.

492
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,639
Go that way.

493
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:29,807
♪ On the go

494

496
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,979
You just work together,
you never thought about

497
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:39,983
who was white
and who was black.

498
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,952
You thought about
the common thing

499
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:44,121
and it was the music.

500
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:48,525
We were color blind.

501
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,794
There was never
any situation that came up

502
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:53,864
in the studio here ever

503
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:56,600
about, "You're black
and I'm white."

504
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:58,302
And you think about the South.

505
00:28:58,304 --> 00:28:59,937
They didn't believe
that black and white people

506
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:01,672
could live together.

507
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:05,109
And here are vinyl records

508
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:08,345
that prove that not only
can they live together,

509
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:13,083
you might not know
who's black and who's white.

510
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:17,154
At the time,
this was revolutionary stuff.

511
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:24,461
Music played a big part
in changing the thoughts

512
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:28,432
of people, especially
in the South, about race.

513
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:34,438
By us being in Muscle Shoals
and puttin'

514
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,273
music together,

515
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,710
I think it went a long ways
to help people understand

516
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:43,814
that we all were just humans.

517
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:46,083
My stock went sky-high
with Wexler after

518
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:50,053
the Percy Sledge single went
number one worldwide,

519
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:52,489
and he said, "Rick,
I have a little bit of a dispute"

520
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:55,325
with Jim Stewart at Stax
and he don't want me to cut

521
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,394
"any more records over
at his studio."

522
00:29:57,396 --> 00:30:02,299
The welcoming mat for me
at Memphis was cold.

523
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,268
So I got the idea
of calling Rick Hall

524
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,870
and saying, "Hey, can I bring
Wilson Pickett down here"

525
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:09,706
and, uh, make some records
with you guys?"

526
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:11,074
Which we did.

527
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,950
I gets off the plane,
southern airlines,

528
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:23,487
and here, this long, tall
white man,

529
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,155
we call 'em peckerwoods.

530
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,392
I met Wilson Pickett,
picked him up at the airport.

531
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:32,563
He looked like, to me,
a dangerous man.

532
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:35,265
He walked up like
he'd known me for 500 years.

533
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:36,567
"Hey, Wilson, come on, come on.

534
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:38,168
We gon' cut
some fuckin' records."

535
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,636
Why, we gon' really cut
some records.

536
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:41,205
Come on, Wilson, come on,"
I said, "Wait, wait,"

537
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:43,073
I'm nervous,
you know what I mean?

538
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:45,609
Now what this white man know
about producin'

539
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:49,046
a Wilson Pickett?

540
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:50,480
And on the way to the studio,

541
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:52,216
I'll look at him
and he'll look at me,

542
00:30:52,218 --> 00:30:53,884
and I could see it
in his eyes, he was thinkin',

543
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:55,185
"What am I doin'
with this cracker

544
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,821
down here in Alabama?"

545
00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:59,356
We went through
the cotton patch,

546
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,491
people still pickin' cotton.

547
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:04,928
I said, "Is that what
I think it is?"

548
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,364
"Yeah, Wilson, they're still
picking cotton down here."

549
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:10,267
You can see his studio
from the cotton patch.

550
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:17,007
Pickett had a very
quick temper.

551
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:19,610
I was there to make it work,
period.

552
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:22,145
You know what I mean?

553
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:24,081
On session, if he didn't like
what was goin' on

554
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,449
and didn't like the attitude,

555
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:27,818
he's just liable
to whip the drummer.

556
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,320
Say, "Come out, son,
I'm gonna beat your ass."

557
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:33,290
I was nervous,
I was sittin' behind the drums

558
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:36,059
and I was gettin' things
together, like drummers do,

559
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,628
checkin' things.

560
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,831
Our band was super nervous
the first time we worked

561
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:42,165
for Jerry Wexler.

562
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:44,701
We had this feeling that
if we couldn't play

563
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:47,037
what he asked us to play,
we'd probably be fired

564
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,472
on the spot.

565
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:50,941
I was apprehensive, very leery,

566
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:53,243
because it was
entirely different

567
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:56,513
from what we had been
doing in New York,

568
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:59,583
which was recording
with written arrangements,

569
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:03,420
arrangers, and studio players
who read the charts.

570
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,489
We would get in the studio
and would add a little bit

571
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:07,224
of this, a little bit of that,

572
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:08,892
and then we'll go to lunch,
come back,

573
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:10,294
and we didn't like that,
take it away,

574
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:11,929
you know, that kind of stuff.

575
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:14,665
We would sit there and we'd
make that record together.

576
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,571
Those guys are sittin' there
in the studio,

577
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:23,740
and just find the groove,
you know?

578
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,642
And I'd be right there
with 'em, singing along

579
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,945
and we'd all
work it out together.

580
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:31,214
Rick Hall, he stood there
every minute.

581
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:32,749
Rick Hall was his own engineer.

582
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,217
He built the studio.

583
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:38,021
He knew all the electrical
wiring in there.

584
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:39,990
And that drummer they had
was fantastic.

585
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:41,725
He was a funky drummer,
but he wasn't

586
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:45,128
wearing himself out
all over the place.

587
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,098
He was just...
he was just there.

588
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,535
We was cookin' away
on the thing

589
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:53,470
and Wexler was in
the control room.

590
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,906
He said, "Baby, it's working."

591
00:32:55,908 --> 00:32:58,008
Hey, baby,
it's funky."

592
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:09,553
Rick Hall had a rhythm section
of exceptional players.

593
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:17,127
This was very inspirational
to me.

594
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:20,130
Jerry came out
at the end of the first day,

595
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:24,067
we had just cut
"Land of 1,000 Dances,"

596
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:26,136
and he walks out
in front of Roger,

597
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:30,941
and Roger's ears had never heard
anything like this.

598
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:32,109
He said, "Roger."

599
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:33,377
I said, "Yes, sir?"

600
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:37,214
He said, "Roger,
you're a great drummer."

601
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:38,715
And all of a sudden,
it just-

602
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:42,919
I just kind of relaxed
and became a great drummer,

603
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:46,556
just like he said I was.

604
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:48,892
After my first night
in that studio with them,

605
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:52,729
I was convinced that that could
be a recording home for me.

I call it the sonority

628
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:01,465
and loved to go.

629
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:14,010
I grew up north of Florence.

630
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:15,979
It really wasn't a town,

631
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:18,281
just a dirt road.

632
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:23,019
The only way to get
to Florence, at that time,

633
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,454
we had no car.

634
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,690
My mom and I would walk

635
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:30,026
from the dirt road down
to the highway

636
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:32,829
to catch a bus
to go into Florence,

637
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:36,333
which was five miles away.

638
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:38,335
I was born in Sheffield,
Alabama,

639
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:41,738
and graduated from
Sheffield High School.

640
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,040
While in high school,
I would see

641
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,775
Hollis Dixon and the Keynotes.

642
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:48,211
Was the first rock 'n' roll
band around here,

643
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:49,746
and I just fell in love
with that.

644
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:52,816
I thought, "I've gotta learn
how to do that."

645
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,587
You got Roger Hawkins
in a group called

646
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:58,622
The Del Rays.

647
00:35:58,624 --> 00:36:00,457
Jimmy Johnson was playing
guitar.

648
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:01,825
I remember hearing the Del Rays

649
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:04,227
when I was going to
University of Alabama.

650
00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:05,996
And I remember,
I could not get into

651
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:07,664
the fraternity house.

652
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,699
So I had to stay outside
and listen to it.

653
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:12,969
I mean, the ground
was rumbling, okay?

654
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:15,572
It was such a great band.

655
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:18,542
We met each other
when we started playing

656
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:20,377
at the Tuscumbia
National Guard Armory

657
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:23,213
at the square dance.

658
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:25,215
Half the night
was rock 'n' roll,

659
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:29,119
and then after that
it was all square dance.

660
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:31,888
We made $10 each for that.

661
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:44,134
After Wilson Pickett, I became
Jerry's right hand man.

662
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:48,104
And so he said, "I'm thinkin'

She's on CBS Records

successful either.

673

No one knew
what to do with her,

I don't know yet.

I'm trying to find the answer.

I wasn't exactly hoping
that she wouldn't have

any hits on Columbia Records,

681

but the way it went, they
dropped her after five years.

We did what we called head
sessions at that time,

00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:41,718
and there was no real music
written for it.

"Never Loved a Man

They'd been drinkin'
from the same jug,

"I want the trumpet player
fired."

I looked at Wexler and I said,

I felt a certain spirituality
about the black man's music.

singing in the fields

rumbling through

1098
00:58:18,963 --> 00:58:23,165
He would take
a thousand takes of something

1099
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:24,433
till he was satisfied.

1100
00:58:24,435 --> 00:58:26,502
And sometimes he would not know

1101
00:58:26,504 --> 00:58:27,736
what he was looking for,

1102
00:58:27,738 --> 00:58:29,938
but he would keep
working until he got it.

1103
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,507
I'm talking about...
it's too bright.

1104
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:33,775
Oh, okay, I thought you were...
wanted it to be bright.

1105
00:58:33,777 --> 00:58:35,577
Well, I did want it bright
until I heard it,

1106
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:37,946
when you hear it with the track
it's a whole different thing.

1107
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:39,481
You gotta listen
to it in perspective.

1108
00:58:39,483 --> 00:58:42,150
That was very frustrating
and hard on the musicians

1109
00:58:42,152 --> 00:58:44,086
because you think,
"Well, I already did that."

1110
00:58:44,088 --> 00:58:46,688
Nobody ever worked
in the music business

1111
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,024
without getting
their ass kicked.

1112
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,792
If they did, they're out
on the street somewhere

pushin' a wheelbarrow
of concrete.

He was kind of like
a task master,

1115
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:57,332
and I don't fault him for that

1116
00:58:57,334 --> 00:59:01,570
because he is
an imperfect perfectionist.

1117

That's what made him
great though.

horseback riding with me

'cause we weren't
doing anything.

He couldn't play.

1159

his house for about six weeks.

a year and 18 days older.

of country song,

1407
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:46,327
and I remember
we used Jim Dickinson,

1408
01:12:46,329 --> 01:12:48,629
he played tack piano.

1409
01:12:48,631 --> 01:12:53,101

♪ We'll ride them someday

1416
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:43,184
I thought it was
one of the easiest

1417
01:13:43,186 --> 01:13:46,187
and rockingest sessions
that we'd ever done.

1418
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:49,857
I don't think we'd been
quite so prolific ever.

1419
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:52,193
I mean, we cut three
or four tracks in two days,

1420
01:13:52,195 --> 01:13:56,164
and that, for the Stones,
is going some...

1421
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:03,905
We left on a high
with "Brown Sugar."

1422
01:14:03,907 --> 01:14:07,942
We knew we had one of the best
things we'd ever done.

1423
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:09,744
The thing about "Brown Sugar,"
it had this sound,

1424
01:14:09,746 --> 01:14:11,546
it was quite distorted.

1425
01:14:11,548 --> 01:14:13,014
It was pretty funky, you know.

1426
01:14:13,016 --> 01:14:17,618
That was the whole idea of it.

1427
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:20,788
I always wanted to go
back there and cut more,

1428
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,990
then shit happened,
so we ended up in France

1429
01:14:22,992 --> 01:14:25,159
in a basement doing
"Exile on Main St." there,

1430
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:28,062
but otherwise, "Exile"
would probably have been cut

1431
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:29,464
in Muscle Shoals,

1432
01:14:29,466 --> 01:14:31,032
but politically,
it wasn't possible.

1433
01:14:31,034 --> 01:14:33,401
I wasn't allowed
in the country at the time.

1434
01:14:33,403 --> 01:14:36,537
So, there's that, you know.

1435
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:38,239
♪ Brown sugar

1436
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:44,111
♪ How come you taste so good ♪

1437
01:14:44,113 --> 01:14:45,680

♪ Just like
a young girl should ♪

1439
01:14:48,418 --> 01:14:51,118
Those sessions
were as vital to me

1440
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,488
as any I ever done.

1441
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:55,857
I mean, all this other stuff,

1442
01:14:55,859 --> 01:14:59,060
"Beggars Banquet"
and the other stuff we did,

1443
01:14:59,062 --> 01:15:01,696
"Gimme Shelter,"
"Street Fighting Man,"

1444
01:15:01,698 --> 01:15:03,798
"Jumpin' Jack Flash," you know,

1445
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:07,101
but I've always wondered

1446
01:15:07,103 --> 01:15:09,036
that if we'd have cut
them in Muscle Shoals,

1447
01:15:09,038 --> 01:15:11,472
if they might not have
been a little bit funkier.

1453
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:50,177
So, I got this great new
deal with Capitol Records,

1454
01:15:50,179 --> 01:15:51,779
but I've had this
feud with Wexler,

1455
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:53,814
and he's taking my musicians

1456
01:15:53,816 --> 01:15:55,783
and going across town
and going to put me

1457
01:15:55,785 --> 01:15:57,952
out of business, so he says.

1458
01:15:57,954 --> 01:15:59,754
I imagine Rick was pissed.

1459
01:15:59,756 --> 01:16:01,556
Hey, I got this deal,

1460
01:16:01,558 --> 01:16:04,125
and I don't have
a rhythm section.

1461
01:16:04,127 --> 01:16:06,861
But if Jerry thinks
these are the only guys

1462
01:16:06,863 --> 01:16:08,696
left in the world that you
can cut hit records on,

1463
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:10,464
then he's mistaken
because I believed

1464
01:16:10,466 --> 01:16:16,203
that I could cut hit records
with any group of musicians.

1465
01:16:16,205 --> 01:16:18,806
We began to call
every musician we knew

1466
01:16:18,808 --> 01:16:21,342
and put them under contract.

1467
01:16:25,213 --> 01:16:27,949
So, that's why he calls me,
get me up there real quick,

1468
01:16:27,951 --> 01:16:29,317
and he said,
"Do you know a bass player?"

1469
01:16:29,319 --> 01:16:31,652
I said, "I know
a great bass player."

1470
01:16:31,654 --> 01:16:33,120
So, I started playing,
and he said,

1471
01:16:33,122 --> 01:16:35,590
"Do you know of any
other rhythm guys?"

1472
01:16:35,592 --> 01:16:38,326
I said, "Yeah, Freeman Brown,"

1473
01:16:38,328 --> 01:16:40,861
who became one of the best
fat back drummers

1474
01:16:40,863 --> 01:16:44,699
for Muscle Shoals.

1475
01:16:44,701 --> 01:16:46,834
He said, "And I also
need a horn section,"

1476
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:48,402
and I said, "Yeah,
there's some guys"

1477
01:16:48,404 --> 01:16:51,105
that I met
out of Nashville."

1478
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:53,608
Rick Hall wanted
to put a band together

1479
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:55,109
and called it the "Fame Gang,"

1480
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:59,146
and I ended up
being part of that.

1481
01:16:59,148 --> 01:17:02,116
For me to surround myself with
the strongest people I could

1482
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:05,219
made me a better producer.

1483
01:17:05,221 --> 01:17:07,888
Now, here's what we're going
to do, we're going to let him

1484
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:09,724
play back the tape
four or five times

1485
01:17:09,726 --> 01:17:11,626
in succession, I want
to work with the horns.

1486
01:17:11,628 --> 01:17:14,295
This is a sad song,

1487
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:17,832
you know, so don't
jazz it up too much...

1488
01:17:17,834 --> 01:17:19,133
and take away from the lyrics

1489
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:21,135
so it sounds
like a dance record.

1490
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:22,937
The truth is
after Barry Beckett

1491
01:17:22,939 --> 01:17:24,739
and Jimmy Johnson,
Roger Hawkins, David Hood

1492
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:26,173
left and bought
their own studio,

1493
01:17:26,175 --> 01:17:28,142
we come in here with this
new rhythm section

1494
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:30,578
who was not a real
studio band yet,

1495
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:33,447
but 1971, Rick Hall's
the producer of the year.

1496
01:17:33,449 --> 01:17:35,616
He didn't have that
with the other guys.

1497
01:17:35,618 --> 01:17:36,951
I started over again,

1498
01:17:36,953 --> 01:17:38,986
and I believed I was
as good as anybody.

1499
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,588
Here's Candi Staton

1500
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:43,024
to sing her big,
big hit on FAME.

1501
01:17:43,026 --> 01:17:45,993
At FAME, we experienced
a lot of great artists,

1502
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:49,997
starting with Candi Staton.

1503
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,332
We started to explode.

1504
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:53,601

when Donny Osmond,

1516
01:18:19,762 --> 01:18:21,862
the Osmond Brothers, in 1971,

1517
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:23,197
I think they sold something
in the neighborhood

1518
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,499
of 23 million records
in one year.

Clarence Carter,
Wilson Pickett, Bobby Womack.

1522
01:18:33,076 --> 01:18:34,742
I had one of the biggest

1523
01:18:34,744 --> 01:18:36,010
in the world behind me,

1524
01:18:36,012 --> 01:18:38,212
I was getting twice

1530
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:56,430
We were forming
a production company

1531
01:18:56,432 --> 01:18:59,400
in about '69 or '70,

1532
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:01,936
and our friend, Alan Walden,

1533
01:19:01,938 --> 01:19:05,539
found this band in Jacksonville
called Lynyrd Skynyrd.

1534
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:10,411
I was a sucker to want
to cut that band immediately,

1535
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:12,213
so we signed them.

1536
01:19:12,215 --> 01:19:14,582
When I first joined
Lynyrd Skynyrd,

1537
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:17,485
Ronnie had always talked
about the guys in Muscle Shoals.

1538
01:19:17,487 --> 01:19:20,354
Apparently they had
gone up there and recorded

1539
01:19:20,356 --> 01:19:24,391
an entire album
with Jimmy Johnson producing.

1540
01:19:24,393 --> 01:19:26,293
They had no money,

1541
01:19:26,295 --> 01:19:28,329
and I remember they
would come up here

1542
01:19:28,331 --> 01:19:30,664
and they'd check
in a truck stop

1543
01:19:30,666 --> 01:19:33,134
where they'd get in fights
with the truckers

1544
01:19:33,136 --> 01:19:36,070
'cause their long hair,
and basically,

1545
01:19:36,072 --> 01:19:39,440
all they had to eat
was peanut butter sandwiches

1546
01:19:39,442 --> 01:19:41,909
the whole time,

1547
01:19:41,911 --> 01:19:44,345
but I loved this band.

1548
01:19:44,347 --> 01:19:46,013
I didn't know if it'd be a hit,

1549
01:19:46,015 --> 01:19:47,114
but I'll tell you one thing,

1550
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:49,350
if you listen to those songs,

1551
01:19:49,352 --> 01:19:51,585
some of the best
rock and roll songs

1552
01:19:51,587 --> 01:19:53,687
I've ever heard,

1553
01:19:53,689 --> 01:19:55,923
especially one.

1554
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:00,628
At the time we were
cutting "Free Bird,"

1555
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:02,263
we took a little lunch break,

1556
01:20:02,265 --> 01:20:06,267
we walk in, the engineer
had started playing the tape.

1557
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:08,502
Billy Powell, who's the roadie,

1558
01:20:08,504 --> 01:20:11,872
he was sitting there
playing this concert piano

1559
01:20:11,874 --> 01:20:13,774
that was so unbelievable

1560
01:20:13,776 --> 01:20:17,578
that we walked in
just in, like... awe,

1561
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:20,247
with our mouth open.

1562
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:22,149
And I look at Ronnie
and he looks at me,

1563
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:24,218
and I say, "I gotta go
and record with that."

1564
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:25,319
I don't know
about you."

1565
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:26,921
And he said,
"You got it."

1566
01:20:26,923 --> 01:20:29,456
We put him on the record,
and then he became

1567
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:32,259
a band member
within a few months.

1568
01:20:32,261 --> 01:20:34,728
He was a concert pianist,

1569
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:38,032
and nobody knew it,
not anybody.

1570
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:43,704
I think he thought
they wouldn't like that,

1571
01:20:43,706 --> 01:20:46,040
you know, that he had studied,

1572
01:20:46,042 --> 01:20:50,044
but what a great thing
he added to their records.

1573
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:58,152
But there was something
different about this band.

1574
01:20:58,154 --> 01:21:02,389
I mean, on this album,
I had a nine-minute single,

1575
01:21:02,391 --> 01:21:05,192
and I'm gonna go and try
to sell it to a record company

1576
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:08,829
that's never had a single
over three and a half minutes.

"You got to be the best
at whatever you do,"

from all over the world.

1714
01:29:15,384 --> 01:29:17,551
Sure, people go
to New York to record.

1715
01:29:17,553 --> 01:29:18,819
You know, big deal.

You know,
go to Muscle Shoals where

1717
01:29:20,456 --> 01:29:22,055
you can actually get
lunch at a meat and three

1718
01:29:22,057 --> 01:29:24,491
and really experience
the Southern way of life.

I mean, there's
nothing like it.

01:29:30,431 --> 01:29:31,898
When I went
to Muscle Shoals to record,

1721
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:35,302
for me, it was more
like going to my village

1722
01:29:35,304 --> 01:29:37,871
in Somerton in Jamaica.

1723
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:41,675

feel I'm at home.

Jimmy had a very definite
Jamaican songwriting style,

01:29:52,087 --> 01:29:53,820
and this was
pre-Bob Marley,

1728
01:29:53,822 --> 01:29:58,191
so nobody was really hip
to the Jamaican sound that much.

had the idea

When we were going
through our formative years,

1757
01:31:15,571 --> 01:31:18,705
I started hearing
this Southern soul music,

1758
01:31:18,707 --> 01:31:22,309
and of course, I didn't
really have any concept

1759
01:31:22,311 --> 01:31:26,179
of Muscle Shoals
or the musicians

hearing this music,

I just knew that the music had
something very special for me,

1763
01:31:34,256 --> 01:31:36,690
so when we actually
got to work with them,

1764
01:31:36,692 --> 01:31:39,459

01:31:47,803 --> 01:31:51,104
It was... to me,
it was strange.

1768
01:31:51,106 --> 01:31:55,542
Of course, Traffic weren't
a mainstream band at all.

1769
01:31:55,544 --> 01:31:58,278
We would try and take elements

1770
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:02,749
of rock, jazz, folk music,

1771

They didn't go about recording
the way that we were used to.

1775
01:32:18,734 --> 01:32:21,801
At that time, I was
trying to be real precise.

1776
01:32:21,803 --> 01:32:23,703
Traffic was the exact opposite.

good, but let's play it.

It wasn't an immediate,
easy marriage.

I was forced to learn
how to jam again.

1783
01:32:44,025 --> 01:32:47,594
The song that stands out
for me off that album

1784
01:32:47,596 --> 01:32:50,196
is "(Sometimes I Feel So)
Uninspired."

1785

What Muscle Shoals
did to that song

1786
01:32:52,768 --> 01:32:56,036
was truly spectacular,
they brought

1787
01:32:56,038 --> 01:32:59,105
these rhythmic elements
and harmonic elements

1788
01:32:59,107 --> 01:33:03,376

would get together

say, "Are we corrupting
these guys' minds?"

1801

a lot of rejection,

and to be honest with you,
I think rejection

1883
01:38:18,994 --> 01:38:23,596
played a big role
in my life because

1884

I thrived on it.

I was rejected by my mother.

I was rejected by schoolmates

He was our mentor.

He gave all of us

that we would have
never gotten without him.

We all got our start

Because they played on so many

01:40:10,205 --> 01:40:11,904
they will take their place

Everything that

it came from their heart,

and that's what makes
Muscle Shoals so powerful.

1919

What music built there

In fact, if you look
at the recording studios,

1922
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:37,463
they were humble shells,

1923
01:40:37,465 --> 01:40:41,401
but what they contained
was an empire

1924
01:40:41,403 --> 01:40:45,371
that crossed race
and creed, ethnicity.

1925
01:40:45,373 --> 01:40:47,640
It was revolutionary.

When you hear musicians,

2066
01:50:22,550 --> 01:50:24,950
five or six of 'em in a room,

2067
01:50:24,952 --> 01:50:26,852
and you hear the imperfections,

2068
01:50:26,854 --> 01:50:29,388
that's the human element.

2069

If a guy falls off of the stool

2070
01:50:31,459 --> 01:50:34,627
who's playing the drums,
I really don't give a shit,

2071
01:50:34,629 --> 01:50:36,862
as long as he don't
miss a beat.

2072
01:50:36,864 --> 01:50:38,230
He can get back up
and climb back up,

2073
01:50:38,232 --> 01:50:40,933
and most people,
including myself,

2074
01:50:40,935 --> 01:50:42,901
think that's great.

2075
01:50:42,903 --> 01:50:45,437
That's the human element,
there's faults.

2076
01:50:45,439 --> 01:50:48,307
So, the imperfections
gives it the human element,

2077
01:50:48,309 --> 01:50:51,810
which I believe is what
we need today more of,

2078
01:50:51,812 --> 01:50:55,180
and that's how you make
magic and great records.

2079
01:50:55,182 --> 01:50:57,650
Amen.
