1
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,971
You must've forgot who I am!

2
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,300
I'm the fool.

3
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,820
I'm the one who has to pretend
not to notice when you come home

4
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,860
after three days smelling
like cheap women and moonshine.

5
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,700
I'm the one who has to lie
to the boys when you pretend

6
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,220
when they ask where their daddy is.

7
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,220
You lie to them, too,
when he come around here?

8
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,900
He has no problem like you.

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,740
You don't talk to me like that.

10
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,602
Ever.

11
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,220
What are you going
to do without me next year?

12
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,940
I can ask you the same question.

13
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,580
You know there's a mill
down the road from the seminary.

14
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,940
I heard they're hiring.

15
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,660
And when me and Maggie get a house

16
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,660
maybe you could take a room.

17
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,220
I don't need your charity, Pete.

18
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,700
Besides, I think I might join the Army.

19
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,860
With this whole
communist thing going on,

20
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,531
who knows what'll happen tomorrow.

21
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,860
I think it's a good idea.

22
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,928
You go to class as much as you can.

23
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,060
Just ignore him. He's harmless.

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,130
- What's your bit, Leemaster?
- No, Pete, don't.

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,340
Thanks.

26
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,441
Hey.

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,500
- Did you miss me?
- Always.

28
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,001
I can't wait until tonight.

29
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,220
I got six more votes for you, Pete,

30
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,100
and seven more for you, Maggie.

31
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,380
You two lovers should
have it made in the shade.

32
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,881
We just hope to have
a good time tonight.

33
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,526
Well, well, look what
the cat dragged in.

34
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,481
Button?

35
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,500
It's sad how bad you want this.

36
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,500
What's sad is to see a cheap
leather jacket on a nosebleed.

37
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,260
What, you pick up some
old fashion tips from the city jail?

38
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,020
Upset you can't buy enough votes?

39
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,260
No.

40
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,300
He's going to win this
like he always does.

41
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,300
I mean I know
you hate him for it, but...

42
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,460
you don't have
to take it out on poor old me.

43
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,020
Well, Andy...

44
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,980
maybe I hate you both.

45
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,860
You know this little contest doesn't
mean a damn thing to Pete, right?

46
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,460
If that were true, then he'd cut out.
Maggie's already royalty in this town.

47
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,940
It's only fitting I'd be
standing beside her tonight.

48
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,980
Just like it always should've been.

49
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,900
Not some poor orphan cracker
from the back woods.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,260
Any problem here, gentlemen?

51
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,580
No, sir.

52
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,060
Mr. Goodwynn?

53
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,380
Is there a problem?

54
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,220
Now, you listen to me,
you rude little miscreant.

55
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,260
When you're asked
a question, you answer.

56
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,140
It's called respect.

57
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,300
You know, you could take
a lesson from your brother.

58
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,660
It really is a scientific anomaly that
you're the twin brother of Peter Goodwynn.

59
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,525
Now, I'm going to ask you one more time.

60
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,847
Is there a problem?

61
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,420
I supposed there isn't, Principal Evers.

62
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,100
You better stop digging.

63
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,282
You're already at rock bottom with me.

64
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,768
Now, you two boys get to class.

65
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,900
Better run along now, Andy,
and get to, what is it, shop class?

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,300
What you making today?

67
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,164
I hope it's an ashtray.

68
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,620
You think I'm funny?

69
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,300
Keep laughing.

70
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,367
What?

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,420
Not so funny now, am I?

72
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,900
What's wrong with you, Goodwynn?

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,002
We weren't even talking about you.

74
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,601
Be careful driving.

75
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,420
You know my whole life is in this car.

76
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,340
Well, ain't that apple butter?

77
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,010
I'm always careful.

78
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,180
You know I wouldn't stand
a chance without you.

79
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,900
Don't be afraid.

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,241
True love has no room for fear.

81
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,540
I thank God every day for my true love.

82
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,404
See you tonight.

83
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,500
Oh, yeah.

84
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,420
Now we're talking.

85
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,900
It's too small.

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,100
No, no, no, no.

87
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,380
It fits you like a glove.

88
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,940
It looks tailored to your body.

89
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,740
No, I tried, Pete.

90
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,940
This just ain't me.

91
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,100
I'm not going to that stupid prom.

92
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,220
You're going.

93
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,380
And we're going to be
the best looking twin brothers

94
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,780
Bainbridge High has ever seen.

95
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,940
You'll find a nice girl
in two seconds flat.

96
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,900
Nope.

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,220
No more fast girls for my brother here.

98
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,740
Fine.

99
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,729
But I'm not walking home in this.

100
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,180
Gentlemen...

101
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,660
I want to thank you for meeting me
on such short notice.

102
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,410
But I venture a guess...

103
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,100
that this...

104
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,328
will make your trips...

105
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,020
worthwhile.

106
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,780
Hold on there a minute, Herbert.

107
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,460
I'd like to hear a little more
about this development

108
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,900
you plan to build.

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,580
I for one, not sure
I'm ready to sign off

110
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,260
on some harebrained scheme.

111
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,420
Scheme?

112
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,060
This is not a scheme.

113
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,700
Would I have invested
my entire fortune in this project

114
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,620
if it was a scheme?

115
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,180
Now, I can assure you
that this is the real deal

116
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,420
and that this is only
a taste of what's to come.

117
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,780
Well, I think we deserve
at the very least to...

118
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,460
I don't have a lot of time, you see.

119
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,620
Now, I've shown good faith
by delivering a proper incentive.

120
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,802
Now, if you want to hear
the details of the plan,

121
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,620
you can come out to the press conference

122
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,860
they got scheduled in ten minutes.

123
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,180
But I'm going to need
the documents from you all...

124
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,930
now.

125
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,882
Thank you. Thank you.

126
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,100
Thank you.

127
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,860
I just need to be
a little more certain is all.

128
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,300
Certain? You want certain, huh?

129
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,020
You play ball with me...

130
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,682
and we'll make
Mr. Rockefeller himself jealous.

131
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,580
Or not.

132
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,980
But I think it's important to note
that certain photographs

133
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,700
featuring certain people
with certain mistresses

134
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,260
has a way of leaking out when people

135
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,328
don't play ball with me.

136
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,980
Thank you, George.

137
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,540
Good afternoon.

138
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,980
I want to thank y'all
for being here today.

139
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,100
In the next few months
we are going to break ground

140
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,488
on a new project that
will change this city forever.

141
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,700
Better jobs,

142
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,620
a better standard of living,

143
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,848
and a better future for our children.

144
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,660
Masterville homes.

145
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,482
Contemporary housing made
affordable for the common family.

146
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,940
Isn't this kind of opposite,
isn't the guy supposed

147
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,610
to pick up the girl?

148
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,260
Aren't you supposed
to take a date to the prom?

149
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:44,900
There's my girl.

150
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,940
I'll get the door.

151
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,407
You better do something about that hair.

152
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,780
- Hey.
- Wow, Maggie, you look beautiful.

153
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,006
Thank you.

154
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,580
Definitely too beautiful
for a backwoods fisherman's boy.

155
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,780
Yeah, but I'm sure you know that, right?

156
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,620
Just having fun getting
your kicks with a poor boy?

157
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,460
Come on, Andy, you know
my heart belongs to your brother.

158
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,300
Yeah.

159
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,900
That sounds fine now, but...

160
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,140
when you look around,

161
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,900
realize that this is your future,

162
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,401
I'm sure you'll be giving up
more than just your heart

163
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,330
to the nearest richie rich
like Gordon Leemaster.

164
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,860
I'm sorry.

165
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,450
I shouldn't have.

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,780
What's going on?

167
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,660
Nothing. You got yourself
a real fine girl here.

168
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,886
I'm sick of you.

169
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,260
Why do you always ruin everything?

170
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,620
You're ruining your life.

171
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,100
You're trying to ruin mine, too?

172
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,740
Yeah, that's right.

173
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,940
I ruined everything.

174
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,500
I'm the screw up
and you're the perfect one.

175
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,180
Maybe I should find God
and be more like you.

176
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,100
Dear God, please help me
be more like Pete.

177
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,380
That's not the point, Andy.

178
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,960
Then, what is the point?

179
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,809
Have fun at the prom!

180
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,251
You okay?

181
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,691
I'm fine.

182
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,860
Let's try an have a good time tonight.

183
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,220
Okay?

184
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,651
Sure.

185
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,900
Should we tell them?

186
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,100
I need some air.

187
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,168
Come with me outside?

188
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,620
You must be cold.

189
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,860
No, I'm fine, thank you.

190
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,220
It's beautiful out tonight.

191
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,561
It's perfect.

192
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,047
I can't wait to marry you, Maggie.

193
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,681
I need to talk to you, Pete.

194
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,660
Listen to me.

195
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,287
I love you, and I want to marry you,

196
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,722
but just not right now.

197
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,340
Is this because of what happened
with Andy tonight?

198
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,900
Of course not.

199
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,900
Well, is it cause of your father?

200
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,220
What? No.

201
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,620
He doesn't want to see his daughter
end up with a Goodwynn.

202
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,660
- No.
- I'm not my brother.

203
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,580
I know that, Pete,
and my daddy knows that.

204
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,860
This doesn't have anything to do
with my father or Andy.

205
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,460
I love you.

206
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,420
This is just moving
a little fast is all.

207
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,820
What about moving to Reedsville?

208
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,060
What happens when I go
to seminary in the fall?

209
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,404
You'll still do all of that,
and we'll still be together.

210
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,729
I just don't want to feel like
we're rushing into all of this.

211
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,700
I guess I don't see it as rushing.

212
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,406
I see waiting
as delaying the inevitable.

213
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,660
I love you.

214
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,860
That will never change.

215
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,486
I just want to wait a little bit.

216
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,380
You can understand that?

217
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,811
Sure I can.

218
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,166
I'll wait as long as you need me to.

219
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,690
Come on, snake, let's rattle.

220
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,129
I think we all need to thank our...

221
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,700
your wonderful Bainbridge High
prom committee for assembling

222
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,580
such a wonderful end-of-the-year dance.

223
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,300
So, thank you. And...

224
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,020
And you'll be happy to know
that we have tallied all the votes

225
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,980
and we'll be announcing
prom king and queen

226
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,260
in about 15 minutes.

227
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,322
Thank you, and please continue
to behave yourselves and respectfully.

228
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,980
What if we don't win?

229
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,260
I'll still be
the happiest guy in the room.

230
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,660
Maybe I should go freshen up,
you know, just in case.

231
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,649
I'll be waiting.

232
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,820
You really do look beautiful.

233
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,260
Thank you. I love your dress.

234
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,660
I just love that color on you.

235
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,660
It's supposed to be wine,
I guess it faded a bit.

236
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,980
No, it's lovely.

237
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,801
I'd kill to have a dress like yours.

238
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,161
Good luck tonight, Maggie.

239
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,260
Gordon, what are you doing in here?

240
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,060
You can't be in here.

241
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,020
You look beautiful tonight, Maggie.

242
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,044
Gordon, you've been drinking.

243
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,780
You always look beautiful, don't you?

244
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,940
Thank you, but you really
shouldn't be in here.

245
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,565
You'll get into trouble.

246
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,300
Hey, you remember
that time in the fifth grade?

247
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,220
During that bad storm,
we were under our desks

248
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,180
and I held your hand
so you wouldn't be afraid?

249
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,540
You remember that?

250
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,611
Yes, that was a long time ago, Gordon.

251
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,540
I fell in love with you then, Maggie.

252
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,723
And I've been
in love with you ever since.

253
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,860
That should be me and you tonight.

254
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,405
You should be my girl.

255
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,980
Now, I heard you and Pete talking and...

256
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,900
and I knew you weren't
right for each other.

257
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,740
Is that what this is about?

258
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,325
Maggie. I love you. Don't you hear me?

259
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,820
Gordon, you are very sweet,

260
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,740
but I love Pete.

261
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,900
Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete.

262
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,740
What does Pete have
that I don't have, huh?

263
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,580
I could give you everything.

264
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,300
I don't need anything.

265
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,980
Pete's love is everything
I could ever want.

266
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,420
Listen, Maggie.

267
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,940
I'm a Leemaster.

268
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,260
And I always get what I want.

269
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,604
Now, come to your senses
and stop being so difficult.

270
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,846
Hey.

271
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,409
Maggie?

272
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,647
Maggie.

273
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,801
No, no, no.

274
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,446
Get some help!

275
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,820
No, no, no.

276
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,020
No, Maggie.

277
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,740
Please, God.

278
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,649
Maggie, don't.

279
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,531
No. No!

280
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,100
What's going on?

281
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,020
Maggie Maloye, she's dead.

282
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,561
What? What are you talking about?
What happened? Where's Pete?

283
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,940
She was mine. It's all your fault.

284
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,220
What did you do it for?

285
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,890
How could you?

286
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,211
Pete!

287
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,329
Pete, are you all right?

288
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,740
Maggie.

289
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,900
I know.

290
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,780
He killed her.

291
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,644
He killed Maggie. She's gone.

292
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,540
I'm sorry, Pete.
I'm sorry for everything.

293
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,300
I wish I could take back
what I said to her.

294
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,700
I should've killed him.

295
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,420
He killed my girl, my Maggie,
and all I could do

296
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,140
was punch him in the face.

297
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,940
Don't let him take
anything else from you.

298
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,700
He deserves to be where he is right now,

299
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,260
and he deserves what's coming to him.

300
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,020
- Now, you better get going.
- Why? I want to stay.

301
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,980
I want to watch when
they handcuff her killer.

302
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,300
Pete... you know those sirens,
they're coming for you.

303
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,860
- You know that, right?
- For me? What are you talking about?

304
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,140
He killed Maggie.

305
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,340
It doesn't matter. That's Gordon Leemaster
lying unconscious right there.

306
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,700
That's all they're going to see.

307
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,340
Until this is cleared up,
they're going to lock you up for this.

308
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,780
They're not going to listen
to a single word you have to say.

309
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,860
Now, you don't have much time.

310
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,220
I'm staying.

311
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,860
No, Pete, listen to me.

312
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,180
Do you want to be behind bars
for Maggie's funeral?

313
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,443
Now, go home. Take off.
Let me figure something out. Go.

314
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,340
I've got someone over here!

315
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,805
Get a medic!

316
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,580
He's still alive.

317
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,260
You better call Chief.

318
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,647
That's Leemaster's boy.

319
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,484
Skin out.

320
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,300
I did it.

321
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,448
You are under arrest
for the assault and battery

322
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,540
of Gordon Leemaster
and the murder of Maggie Maloye.

323
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,620
Wait, what? I didn't kill Maggie.

324
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,780
I didn't kill Maggie.

325
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,530
You just confessed, kid.

326
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,205
All right.

327
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,140
Now, let's make this fast and easy.

328
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,891
Write down everything
you remember from last night.

329
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,140
How you killed the girl, beat up Gordon,

330
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,340
and anything else you can remember,
just jot it down. That'd be good.

331
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,300
And then give me
your John Hancock and we'll be all set.

332
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,700
Yeah, I only fought with Gordon,
but I did not kill Maggie.

333
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,820
Gordon did.

334
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,660
I see.

335
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,980
Well, I just happen to have
five officers that remember

336
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,780
you giving a confession.

337
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,940
You're going to have to stop
blaming everybody else

338
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,566
for all the stuff you do.

339
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,380
Now, I've known you boys
for a long time,

340
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,100
watched you grow up,
know a lot about you, a lot of secrets.

341
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,180
And you know what else?

342
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,740
It's always bothered me
that you could never stick

343
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,100
to the straight
and narrow like your brother.

344
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,300
Remember that night
when your mama and daddy died?

345
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,620
Of course you do, you were there.

346
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,540
I remember like it was yesterday.

347
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,521
That was a black stain
on this community, I tell you that.

348
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,780
Now, a beautiful young lady,

349
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,900
laying cold on the bathroom floor,

350
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,460
never grow up to be a mommy,

351
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,180
it's all because of you.

352
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,700
That's right.

353
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,087
I'm going to ask you to do something.

354
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,770
It's called, the right thing.

355
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,321
Write down how you killed Maggie.

356
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,369
And sign that paper.

357
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,980
I did not kill Maggie,
and I know for a fact that

358
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,940
you ain't going to find
anything to link me to it.

359
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,567
So you want to do this
the hard way, do you?

360
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,340
I am going to find out everything
that happened out there

361
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,660
yesterday night.

362
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,940
If I find out you been lying to me...

363
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,724
you'll be mine.

364
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,729
Come on, do the right thing.

365
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,460
The news of the violence has shaken
the small town of Bainbridge.

366
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,220
Police have arrested Andy Goodwynn
after he surrendered himself

367
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,380
early this morning and have charged him
in the beating of Gordon Leemaster.

368
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,900
Circumstances surrounding
the death of Maggie Maloye

369
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,924
remain unclear.
The police have begun an investigation.

370
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,140
We're gathered here to lay
to rest the body of Maggie Maloye,

371
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,529
who was removed from the walks
of life far too soon.

372
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,460
Would you join me in prayer?

373
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,043
Heavenly Father, hear our prayer
and comfort these who mourn

374
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,420
the death of Maggie.

375
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,888
Grant them peace
with the assurance that Maggie

376
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,140
and all who are committed to Christ,
the one who took their place,

377
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,260
will be raised from the dead.

378
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,340
We ask these things in Jesus' name.

379
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,940
Amen.

380
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,940
It is our sad duty to commit
her body to the grave.

381
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:29,001
Earth to earth, and ashes
to ashes, and dust to dust,

382
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,860
and our inspiring privilege
to commit her soul to our Maker,

383
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,420
Father and Redeemer,
in the confident hope of coming again...

384
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,620
Jesus Christ, resurrection of the body

385
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,123
from the grave and the joyous life
in this Earth.

386
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,441
You got any good news for me, chief?

387
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,805
Afraid not.

388
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,660
My boys ain't been able
to find one thing with even

389
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,660
a scent of Goodwynn on it.

390
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,020
I don't think we're going
to be able to prove anything.

391
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,045
Mostly likely, we're going
to have to turn them loose soon.

392
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,660
The unsolved murders
aren't really the type of thing

393
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,491
that draws people into a town.

394
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,900
You know what I'm saying, chief?

395
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,721
Unsolved murders are bad for business.

396
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,260
Nobody wants to move
to a community where girls go dead

397
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,820
and killers go free.

398
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,460
Well...

399
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,700
got my best men on it.

400
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,848
Find some better ones.

401
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,980
What's this?

402
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,220
- It's my eye witness account.
- Account of what?

403
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,529
Prom night when I saw
Gordon Leemaster kill Maggie.

404
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,169
I'll look it over.

405
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,060
It proves that Gordon did it.

406
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,500
I said I'd review it.

407
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,328
There's nothing to review.
Go arrest Gordon. He's the murderer.

408
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,368
That is enough of that.

409
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,980
I know you came here
to help save your brother,

410
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,180
but there is no way Gordon
would ever do this kind of thing.

411
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,964
Boy wouldn't hurt a fly.

412
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,420
I thought the police was supposed
to serve and protect,

413
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,206
but you're in Leemaster's pocket
just like everyone else in this town.

414
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,121
I think the lion cage
is around the corner.

415
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,260
Hey, old man, this isn't the zoo.

416
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,900
I don't do tricks.

417
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,900
No, you're the prom night killer.

418
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,562
Oh, excuse me,
the alleged prom night killer.

419
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,300
Yeah, I've heard of you.

420
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,340
No, I'm not that either.

421
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,260
They're going to try and pin it on me.

422
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,850
Oh, yeah, right.

423
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,645
I've heard that, too.

424
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,300
Here.

425
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,802
Take a break from sharpening
those claws for a while, okay?

426
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,442
And by the way, we serve food in here.

427
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,287
You don't have to eat those.

428
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,362
Welcome to the pen.

429
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,420
Please, dear God,

430
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,820
help me to understand
your intentions are for my life.

431
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,220
You said you would
never leave us orphans,

432
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,130
but you're taking everyone from me.

433
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,524
Help them to see the truth.

434
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,970
Pete?

435
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,700
- Pete, don't...
- It was me.

436
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,700
Don't do this. Don't do this to me.

437
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,820
- This is how it's supposed to be.
- It wasn't you.

438
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,060
It should've been.

439
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,260
It can't be you.

440
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,805
I need this.

441
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,780
What am I going to do now?

442
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,282
We have to do what's right.

443
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,964
What is it?

444
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,447
- I can come back.
- No, just be quick about it. What is it?

445
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,100
I just want to talk with you a minute.

446
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,620
You're going to hem and haw
and keep me waiting?

447
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,370
Or are you going to come out with it?

448
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,689
It's about the trial.

449
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,484
It wasn't Goodwynn.

450
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,971
So?

451
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,124
I just thought you should know.

452
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,860
What are you saying, Gordon?

453
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,882
- I just want to tell you that.
- It wasn't the Goodwynn boy?

454
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,140
No.

455
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,686
Well, then, Gordon, who was it then?

456
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,660
Gordon?

457
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,091
Tell me.

458
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,540
- It was an accident, Dad.
- Don't.

459
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,880
It was me.

460
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,420
You think I don't know that, Gordon?

461
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,820
Don't you know what you could've done?

462
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,891
Ruin everything I built
for one stupid moment.

463
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,060
Get up.

464
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,180
Now, you listen to me.

465
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,180
You don't breathe a word
of this again, you hear me?

466
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,940
Not another soul,
not your mother, not me,

467
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,820
not anyone, do you understand me?

468
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,051
All right.

469
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,329
I can handle this.

470
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,740
In a dramatic turn of events
there's been a new development

471
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,900
in the case of the brutal beating
of Bainbridge's own Gordon Leemaster.

472
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,900
It was only a few weeks ago
when Andrew Goodwynn

473
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,740
surrendered himself to police
and confessed to the crime,

474
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,660
but early this week
Goodwynn's twin brother,

475
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,300
Peter Goodwynn, has provided
police with compelling evidence

476
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,449
indicating that he was
responsible for the crime.

477
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,940
Pete! Can you give us a quote, please?

478
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,180
Pete, just a line for the story.

479
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,740
Mr. Goodwynn, can you
tell us what happened, please?

480
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,001
Pete!

481
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,500
Still no word on Andy?

482
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,220
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
they out released him.

483
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,540
He's got to serve a minimum
of 30 days for obstruction of justice.

484
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,060
Oh, I just wish he could be here.

485
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,540
Well, there's good news, though.

486
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,008
They've moved him from state prison
down to Bainbridge City Jail.

487
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,180
Good.

488
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,486
That's good.

489
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,810
All rise.

490
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,660
This court is now in session.

491
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,020
The honorable Wade Dalimoore
presiding in the people

492
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,009
versus Peter Goodwynn.

493
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,340
Be seated.

494
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,660
Your honor, I'd like to make
a motion to have this case

495
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,460
dismissed on the grounds that
there has been no evidence

496
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,180
gathered so far that ties my client,

497
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,220
Mr. Peter Goodwynn,
to the murder of Maggie Maloye.

498
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,780
Now, as for the assault charges
against Mr. Leemaster,

499
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,540
my client readily admits his guilt
and he's prepared

500
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,060
to take the responsibility.

501
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,164
Does the state have anything to offer?

502
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,924
Oh, yes, we do, your honor.

503
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,780
We are prepared to exhibit
evidence to this court that

504
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,365
will indicate that the defendant,
Mr. Peter Goodwynn,

505
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,460
is responsible for the death
of Miss Maggie Maloye.

506
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,766
Proceed.

507
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,900
The prosecution would now like to call

508
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,580
Miss Guinevere Wonders to the stand.

509
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,580
Place your left hand on the Bible.

510
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,330
Now, raise your right hand.

511
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,020
Do you swear the whole truth
and nothing but the truth

512
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,700
so help you God?

513
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,860
Yes.

514
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,291
All right, be seated.

515
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,140
Miss Wonders, so nice to see you.

516
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,220
Where were you on the night of May 14th?

517
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,620
I was at the Bainbridge
High School prom.

518
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,700
Oh, lovely.

519
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,700
Did you see Peter Goodwynn
there that evening?

520
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,140
- Yes.
- Where'd you see him?

521
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,925
I saw him many times
throughout the night

522
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,100
in various different places
around the school.

523
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,420
Objection.

524
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,580
My client does not deny
being at the high school prom.

525
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,540
However, his presence there
does not make him a killer.

526
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,260
Oh, your Honor, I'm not concluding that.

527
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,460
I'm merely establishing
that Miss Wonders

528
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,780
did indeed see Peter Goodwynn.

529
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,121
Overruled.

530
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,260
Now, did you see Maggie Maloye?

531
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,420
Yes.

532
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,820
Where'd you see her?

533
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,780
We were in the girl's powder room.

534
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,500
We were freshening up.

535
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,887
Oh, and what happened next?

536
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,100
Told her how beautiful she looked

537
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,780
and then I left to go back to the dance

538
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,300
but on my back I realized that I forgot

539
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,220
my bag so I walked back to get it.

540
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,688
And what happened
when you reentered the bathroom?

541
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,300
I saw...

542
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,180
Peter Goodwynn
crouching over Maggie's body

543
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,285
his hands around her throat.

544
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,008
I saw Peter kill Maggie.

545
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,820
Now, you saw the defendant...

546
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,605
Mr. Peter Goodwynn...

547
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,220
kill Maggie Maloye?

548
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,260
Yes.

549
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,125
He killed Maggie, he did it.

550
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,500
Thank you.

551
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,020
You're very brave.

552
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,849
You may step down.

553
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,048
The prosecution would now like
to call Gordon Leemaster to the stand.

554
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,220
Place your left hand on the Bible.

555
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,380
Raise your right hand.

556
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,340
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

557
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,100
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

558
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,260
I do.

559
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,361
Be seated.

560
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,260
Mr. Leemaster, did Peter Goodwynn
physically assault you

561
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,860
on the night of May 14th?

562
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,660
Objection, your honor, my client
has readily admitted to this.

563
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,445
Why are we dragging it out?

564
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,980
If I can continue in my line
of questioning, Your Honor,

565
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,287
I'm merely establishing motive.

566
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,940
Overruled.

567
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,620
Go ahead and answer.

568
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,660
Yes.

569
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,048
Now, would you tell the court
in your own words what happened

570
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,860
prior to the assault?

571
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,420
Pete discovered Maggie and I
in the girls bathroom together.

572
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,260
He discovered you and Maggie together?

573
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,302
Yes.

574
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,886
What did he discover you doing?

575
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,131
Slow dancing.

576
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,300
Slow dancing?

577
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,700
Now, forgive me, Mr. Leemaster,
I haven't had my coffee this morning.

578
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,860
I might be a bit slow.

579
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,251
Now, why were you and Maggie Maloye
slow dancing in the girls' bathroom?

580
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,860
Maggie and I were in love,

581
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,009
and she was planning on leaving Pete.

582
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,084
Until she did, we had
to keep our love a secret.

583
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,700
It was the only place we could go

584
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,370
where we could be together.

585
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,843
We were in love and we wanted
to dance at the prom.

586
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,180
Help! Somebody help!

587
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,380
So we were there slow dancing
in the girls' bathroom

588
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,687
when Pete walked in.

589
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,220
Let me do this, please.

590
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,560
I can't...

591
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,408
What did he do when he discovered you?

592
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,660
He was like a rabid dog.

593
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,046
He said, "I'm going to kill you."

594
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,100
And then he ripped us apart
and threw me to the ground.

595
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,601
He slapped Maggie
and then turned back to me.

596
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,971
Maggie?

597
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,451
Maggie?

598
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,129
Maggie, wake up.

599
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,490
Maggie?

600
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,684
And what did you do?

601
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,620
It was Pete Goodwynn.

602
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:37,380
He's the best athlete at our school,
and I knew he'd kill me.

603
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,448
And I was scared.

604
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,766
So I ran.

605
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,740
Ran.

606
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:54,050
And you left Maggie there, behind.

607
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,568
I was... I was scared.

608
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,460
I should've stayed.

609
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,289
I should've helped her.

610
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,323
Should've been me.

611
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,969
Bless your heart, son.

612
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,620
You may step down.

613
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,643
Your honor, I believe
that we have presented

614
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,220
sufficient evidence to indicate
the need for a trial.

615
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,526
I believe you're right.

616
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,540
However, in light of the witnesses'
recent testimony,

617
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,580
the people would like
to amend the charges

618
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,460
against Mr. Peter Goodwynn
from felonious assault

619
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,928
and battery to first degree murder.

620
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,980
Motion granted.

621
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,820
The people would also like to pursue...

622
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,720
the death penalty if convicted.

623
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,645
Granted.

624
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,650
Thank you, Your Honor.

625
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,125
Thank you.

626
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,020
We will reconvene on Monday...

627
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,805
where the trial will commence.

628
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,805
Adjourned.

629
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,260
She's lying. You got to do something.

630
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,100
Oh, it happens sometimes, son.

631
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,601
But we're going to put up
a good fight next week.

632
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,380
This is Frank Mills reporting
from WVAP Decatur County.

633
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,220
The fate of an 18-year-old
Bainbridge man

634
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,260
Accused of killing
his high school girlfriend

635
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,860
will soon be in the hands of a jury
as closing arguments

636
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,770
are being made today
in the six-week long trial.

637
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,570
The defendant will stand
and face the jury.

638
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,220
We the jury of Decatur County,

639
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,340
a division of the commonwealth
of Georgia,

640
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,660
do hereby find the defendant,
Peter Goodwynn,

641
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,401
guilty of the charge
of murder in the first degree.

642
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,780
Mr. Goodwynn...

643
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,169
the jury having returned
its verdict in proper form,

644
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,940
as head of this court,
I have the formidable burden

645
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,486
of determining your sentence.

646
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,580
Do you have anything to say
before I impose

647
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,489
the penalties upon you?

648
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,481
I didn't do it.

649
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,285
I didn't kill Maggie.

650
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,766
Mr. Goodwynn, the trial portion
of your case is over.

651
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,780
You have already been found
guilty of first degree murder.

652
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,803
Maggie was my life.

653
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,644
Why would I hurt her?

654
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,500
We had an eye witness
who testified under oath

655
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,940
that she saw you choke
Miss Mallory to death.

656
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,380
Then she's driving a shiny new car.

657
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,780
Wearing a shiny new watch.

658
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,360
And whatever else it is
the Leemasters bought her with.

659
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:49,011
Okay, Mr. Goodwynn,
do you have anything else to say?

660
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,891
Just that you have all made a mistake.

661
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,969
I loved Maggie.

662
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,924
She was my light.

663
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,500
Okay.

664
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,540
Mr. Goodwynn...

665
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,020
based upon your complete
and utter disrespect for law

666
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,860
and the institutions that enforce it,

667
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,820
your disregard for human life,

668
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,460
based upon the viciousness
and brutality of your crime,

669
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:28,246
I have no alternative
but to adopt the sentence

670
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,020
recommended by the state...

671
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,180
death by electrocution.

672
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,940
May God have mercy upon you.

673
00:50:38,158 --> 00:50:39,900
- Bailiff!
- No, Pete.

674
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,220
He didn't do it, he's innocent!

675
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,620
Innocent!

676
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,601
Please, Pete!

677
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,260
Mr. and Mrs. Leemaster,
I know you got to Jenny.

678
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,089
Everyone does.

679
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:04,180
Young man, I will excuse
your insinuation in light

680
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,220
of your unfortunate circumstance.

681
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,340
Now, be on your way.

682
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,460
Come on, Gordy.
Let's go wait in the car.

683
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,815
- Justice was served today.
- No, ma'am. Justice requires truth.

684
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,580
An innocent girl is dead.

685
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,604
And Gordon could have been killed,
and the disgrace you call

686
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,900
your brother is responsible.

687
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,300
Pete didn't do it.

688
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,820
If it wasn't for you,
he'd be free right now.

689
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,160
Come on.

690
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,580
You've got it wrong, Mrs. Leemaster!

691
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,940
This isn't justice,
it's dirty lies and greed.

692
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,327
- Macaire, please, now, let the boy be.
- Herbert, please.

693
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:45,340
Your brother is going to die,
and I'm going to be there

694
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,460
to watch him suffer.

695
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,220
And like you,
I'm going to be praying, too.

696
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:54,260
Praying that he burns in hell
for what he did to our son

697
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,727
and that poor girl.

698
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,243
You ought to be ashamed.

699
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,768
Opening cell 891!

700
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,820
Think your dad's going to kill me?

701
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,540
No.

702
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,247
You're too fast for him.

703
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,780
No, he's going to be proud of me,

704
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,327
I'm going to marry
a soon-to-be preacher.

705
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,121
I know they'll be real happy.

706
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:56,860
You think your parents
would have liked me?

707
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,246
Let me see.

708
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,690
They'd have loved you.

709
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,203
Especially my mama.

710
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,610
Boy, she wanted a girl so bad.

711
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,123
My pops said she cried after I was born.

712
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,500
After Andy was born
and the doctor told her

713
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,420
there was one more coming,
she just kept saying,

714
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,180
"Dear Lord, please let it be a girl."

715
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,260
Aw.

716
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,409
But, no, twin boys.

717
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,444
She really did cry.

718
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,122
I miss him, Maggie.

719
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,762
Sometimes I miss him.

720
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,320
God has plans for us.

721
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,620
Only He knows what they are.

722
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,802
But it's for us to prosper
and not to harm us.

723
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,964
Plans to give us a hope and a future.

724
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,580
Pick it up.

725
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,980
I'm not bothering anyone.

726
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,300
You're a new fish.
And you're bothering everyone.

727
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,980
The new fish are always cocksure punks.

728
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,940
But I'm the old fish.

729
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,487
The name's Carp, and I eat everything,

730
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,540
especially new fish.

731
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,563
Look, I just want to go back
to reading my Bible.

732
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,500
You don't worry about your Bible.

733
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,540
The only words you need
to hold safe in here are mine.

734
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,260
I don't want any trouble.
Please, just leave me alone.

735
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,408
You just committed blasphemy.

736
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,700
Hey, this ain't got
nothing to do with you.

737
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,260
I'm just breaking the new fish.

738
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,140
You're not breaking this one.

739
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,100
And you better be
real careful here, Carp.

740
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,340
Because you're on a real slippery slope.

741
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,284
Wouldn't want you to fall again.

742
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,721
Not everybody's a believer, son.

743
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,205
Thanks.

744
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,328
Thought you might like
some of your things.

745
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,620
I'm going to try and find a way to get you
out of here, Pete. I promise.

746
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,883
I'm working real hard trying
to figure something out.

747
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,690
I don't know.

748
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,180
I think the only way
I'm getting out of here

749
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,442
is after my visit to old Sparky.

750
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,845
Well, I better get going.

751
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,048
See ya next week, maybe.

752
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,170
I'll keep letters coming.

753
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,889
What are you staring at?

754
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,082
Never seen anyone pray before?

755
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,247
Hi, God.

756
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,020
My name is Andy.

757
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,088
I don't think we've been introduced.

758
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,420
I'm pretty sure you know my brother.

759
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:03,420
I've never asked
for anything in my life...

760
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,060
from anybody.

761
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,288
I'm asking you now.

762
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,764
I'm asking.

763
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,980
You know, all I hear is...

764
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,980
"You're done.

765
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,580
You're finished, Andy.

766
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,126
Nothing more you can do here."

767
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,300
But you know what?

768
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,970
I don't give up.

769
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,767
You'd think they'd
figure that out by now.

770
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,488
So, where to next?

771
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:02,980
Think I should be a football player
or a fighter pilot when I grow up?

772
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,220
- Fighter pilot.
- Really?

773
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,740
Yeah. Because you'd be
the slowest football player

774
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:10,740
- that ever carried the ball.
- I would not. I'm faster than you.

775
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,180
Fine, I'll race you home.

776
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,580
Okay.

777
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,140
On "go."

778
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,740
Mark, set...

779
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,365
Go.

780
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,780
Goodwynn.

781
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,689
You got a visitor.

782
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,500
I figured it out.

783
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,940
I know how I'm going to help you.

784
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,780
What are you talking about?

785
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,900
I'm going to go into the seminary.

786
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,380
I talked to a minister.

787
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,580
He said he can do it.

788
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,060
He can get me in.

789
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,605
The seminary?

790
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,100
I don't know.

791
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,980
Don't think that's
the best idea, do you?

792
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,260
Well, at first I didn't.

793
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:03,728
But then I got to thinking
that it might actually be okay.

794
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,740
Things kept falling into place and...

795
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,500
anyway, it's all figured out.

796
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,887
You sure you can do this?

797
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,046
Let's think about this for a minute.

798
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,980
I mean, you aren't
that great of a student.

799
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,820
You never liked to go to class or study.

800
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:24,700
And you aren't even religious.

801
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,380
I just don't understand why
you want to do something like this.

802
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,580
- I just figured I'd do it for you.
- For me? How is this going to help me?

803
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:35,380
Well, I guess you're just
going to have to trust me.

804
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,131
Have a little faith, right, Pete?

805
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,900
Well, it's what I wanted
to come by and tell you.

806
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,300
And let you know that
I'm still going to visit.

807
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,980
Maybe not as much, but as much as I can.

808
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,660
But I'm going to write...

809
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,380
I'm going to write you great letters.

810
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,086
It's going to seem like
you're with me the whole time.

811
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,580
Okay, Andy.

812
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,603
I guess I understand.

813
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:14,740
Hey, Pete, I know it's hard in here,

814
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,081
but everything is going to be okay.

815
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,524
You'll see.

816
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:37,380
Andy came to us a broken man
filled with anger and doubt in this life.

817
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:40,940
But this year, through God's grace,

818
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,460
he's found forgiveness
and peace in his life.

819
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,244
This is a moment of death.

820
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,420
Death of a life filled with sin.

821
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:54,220
Let God's light shine upon you,
so it can then shine through you.

822
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:59,700
Andy, upon your public profession
of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ,

823
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,420
I baptize thee as my brother.

824
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,620
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit,

825
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,530
you are buried with Christ.

826
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,020
Good night, Andy.

827
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,260
Good night.

828
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,660
"Dear Pete,
sorry if my handwriting is messy.

829
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,940
John, my roommate, he's going to sleep.

830
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:34,362
He doesn't like the light on
so it's pretty dark in here.

831
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,260
I get up before the sun every morning.

832
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,900
Can you imagine?

833
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,980
Remember the days when you would
have to drag me out of bed for school?

834
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,580
I know it's only been
less than a year, but it feels

835
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:50,526
like a whole different life,
a whole different time.

836
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,420
I think you'd like John.

837
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,740
He's a real character
and a pretty good singer.

838
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,888
He helps pass the time here.

839
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,962
We have chapel at seven
every morning for morning prayer.

840
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,500
Because it's so early,
I sit in the front row.

841
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,660
It helps me to stay awake,
because all the ministers

842
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:21,161
can see if you fall asleep.

843
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,100
The woman who runs the kitchen
and cooks all our food,

844
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,700
her name is Rita.

845
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,460
She's got snow white hair and kind eyes.

846
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:33,689
She reminds me of Gram.

847
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,220
I miss Gram.

848
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,500
I'm sure you do, too.

849
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,660
I got a letter from Aunt Susan.

850
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,180
She said Gram really likes it
over there in Birmingham with her.

851
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,700
I know she worries about you, though.

852
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,700
Maybe you could write her a letter.

853
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,500
Let her know how you're doing.

854
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,140
Let her know that you're okay.

855
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,208
The nights are the hardest here.

856
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,020
It's so quiet that it's loud.

857
01:06:56,120 --> 01:07:00,380
No crickets, no snoring, just quiet.

858
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,860
Sometimes I'll cough
or shift to squeak my bed,

859
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,928
just to make sure I haven't gone deaf.

860
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,500
That's when I think about you, Pete.

861
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,180
I miss you, brother.

862
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,020
I think that's why I'm doing so well
during the days,

863
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:15,260
because I hate the nights.

864
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,420
Either the prayers
and the classes just distract me

865
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,060
from thinking about
the situation that we're in,

866
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,580
or God's really starting
to shine His light

867
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,740
because I feel comforted
throughout the day.

868
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,300
I don't feel as sad in prayer.

869
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,051
I don't feel so alone."

870
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,900
Hey, this isn't my cell.

871
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,220
What am I doing in here?

872
01:07:55,320 --> 01:08:00,326
Hey, I asked you a question!

873
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:21,283
What are you doing here?

874
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,211
I came...

875
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,020
Meg, she...

876
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,441
Don't you even mention her name.

877
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:34,580
I loved her.

878
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,940
Then, why?

879
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:39,780
- It was an accident.
- An accident?

880
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:43,940
How do you accidentally
suffocate someone?

881
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,644
Why, Gordon?

882
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,606
I'm sorry, Pete.
I wish things could be different.

883
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,620
They still can be.

884
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,380
You tell them what happened.

885
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:02,723
Gordon, you can still make this right.

886
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,721
Tell them what happened.

887
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,170
Gordon!

888
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,340
What will Old Herb and Macaire do now?

889
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:23,740
I'm already convicted.

890
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:24,980
What more do they want?

891
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,660
They want you dead...

892
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:27,860
now.

893
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:28,940
What?

894
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:34,060
Hey, execution date's been set
for June the 27th.

895
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:38,140
That gives you about 40 days.

896
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,700
Forty days?

897
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,940
But I was told that my date
would be years away.

898
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,300
It's only been less than a year.

899
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,980
Yeah, it's the strangest thing.

900
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,970
I've been warden here
for 15 years and...

901
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,140
I've never seen a family petition
for immediate execution.

902
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,420
Never.

903
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,900
They'd like to get me off
this Earth as quickly as possible.

904
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,048
Make sure that no one sees the truth.

905
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,960
So there it is, huh?
Maintaining your innocence.

906
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:08,700
Son, let me give you a little advice,
you need to make it easy on yourself.

907
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,540
I've never seen a man
in your position escape his fate yet

908
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,220
and I probably never will.

909
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:19,140
All right, I suppose we ought
to get the paperwork started.

910
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:22,244
Now, you want us to notify your family?

911
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,460
Just my brother, but I'll tell him.

912
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,220
All right.

913
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,580
Visiting privileges will remain the same

914
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:33,180
up until seven days
before the execution.

915
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:36,380
Now, at that point you can
request up to five visitors

916
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,980
at a time, plus a member of the clergy.

917
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:44,300
A facility chaplain, upon request,
will be available continuously

918
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,780
during the final 24-hour period.

919
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:52,300
And your wife, if you have one, she...

920
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,260
you're not married, are you?

921
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,620
No.

922
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:58,326
I didn't think so.

923
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:02,525
Now, the press can be
present at the executions.

924
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:10,925
Goodwynn.

925
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,441
You need to work
on your letter writing skills, brother.

926
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,580
How are you holding up?

927
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:53,001
Fine.

928
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:56,020
I was thinking I might
go see the house today,

929
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,660
maybe go check on our old fishing spot.

930
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:58,980
What do you think?

931
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:02,687
You can do whatever you want, clearly.

932
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,820
Okay.

933
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:09,060
So...

934
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,571
Nothing to talk about.

935
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,050
You know why?

936
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,980
Because I sit in a hole all day long,

937
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,460
and you've already given me
an itemized list of everything

938
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:23,220
you've done for the past two weeks.

939
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:27,980
Oh, don't forget to write
this little gem of an entry down.

940
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:32,085
I stared at my convict brother
for 35 minutes.

941
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,089
It was sad.

942
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,340
He was wearing a drab prison uniform

943
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,580
and shiny silvery handcuffs.

944
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,260
His hobbies include sitting in his cell

945
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,380
and the occasional
mouse sighting in the corridor.

946
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,100
Okay, so you don't like my letters.

947
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,725
No, Andy, I don't.

948
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,300
I don't care about when you wake up

949
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,820
or the stupid people you get to meet.

950
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:57,380
What are you trying to do, rub it in?

951
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:00,140
Here, Pete, read about my great life.

952
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,700
It could have been yours.

953
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,540
I'm having a great time.

954
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,860
Too bad you're going
to die in a few days.

955
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:11,340
Too bad your girlfriend got killed
and you got blamed for it

956
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,860
because you love it here.

957
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,780
I just wanted to share with you, Pete.

958
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,500
You're my brother.

959
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,860
I'm not used to being apart from you.

960
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:23,220
I just wanted to make it seem like
you were experiencing everything with me.

961
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:24,940
Well, I'm not.

962
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:28,442
I'm sitting in a cage waiting to die.

963
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,420
They gave me my date.

964
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:37,060
- When is it?
- June 27th.

965
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,940
June 27th, 1958?

966
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,900
- Yeah, June 27th, 1958.
- That's in a few weeks.

967
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,140
I know. The Leemasters petitioned
for an immediate execution.

968
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,780
- But they can't.
- They did and it's done.

969
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:50,326
The warden already
started the process with me.

970
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:58,500
Remember when all this started...

971
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,001
and you said the Leemasters
were the most terrible people

972
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,724
you ever knew?

973
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,900
Well, I've been thinking.

974
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,420
I think that nothing really matters.

975
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,921
Like being good or being evil.

976
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,060
I think that things just happen.

977
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:20,100
Bad things happen to good people
and good things happen to bad people.

978
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,260
It's not like that.

979
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,805
Then, why am I here?

980
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:25,966
I don't deserve this.

981
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:31,500
I was a good person.
She was a good person.

982
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,568
There's a plan, Pete.

983
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:40,242
God doesn't have a plan for me.

984
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,929
He never did.

985
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,460
What you reading there, boy?

986
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,460
He ain't going to help you in here.

987
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,005
Keep walking.

988
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,561
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop.

989
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,020
I don't need it anymore.

990
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,980
It doesn't work.

991
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:23,004
All right. I'll take it.

992
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,690
I'll take it.

993
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,980
This day is perfect.

994
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,940
I'd choose sunshine every day.

995
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,740
I like the sun fine.

996
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,365
Something about the rain...

997
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,900
makes me feel God's presence.

998
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,700
Rolling clouds and cleansing rain,
I don't know,

999
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,020
feels comforting.

1000
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:11,020
You are definitely
born to be a preacher.

1001
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:14,408
I love how you can
find God in all things.

1002
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:30,580
You're nearing the end
of your seminary experience here.

1003
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:33,860
Some of you have worked very hard.

1004
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,900
God is not finished with you.

1005
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,420
He's just getting started.

1006
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,900
So I encourage you,

1007
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,500
as you exit through these doors,

1008
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:47,300
listen to him, stay focused upon him,

1009
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:50,500
and he will never,
never leave your side.

1010
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,809
And as we come to a close at this time,

1011
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,020
I want to pray for you.

1012
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:58,260
Let us pray.

1013
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:01,060
Heavenly Father...

1014
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:04,660
we so much thank You for Your presence,

1015
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:08,180
for who You are, for what You've done

1016
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:10,740
in these young men's lives.

1017
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:13,100
Father, may You continue
to watch over them.

1018
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:17,540
May You continue to help them
to grow stronger in the work,

1019
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:21,020
Lord, You have prepared them for.

1020
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,088
Father, these are Your servants.

1021
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:27,900
Give them daily the food that
is needed and the message

1022
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,820
in their hearts as they go to share

1023
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:33,500
and minister to those that
you place before them

1024
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,860
every day of their lives.

1025
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,980
Our Father in heaven,
we thank you for your love

1026
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,980
and your guidance.

1027
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:45,220
And we ask all these things
to your son, Jesus Christ,

1028
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,890
amen.

1029
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:54,020
"Dear Andy, I'm feeling really lousy

1030
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,740
thinking about how you're
probably feeling right now.

1031
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,580
I'm sorry.

1032
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:01,500
I know that you only wanted
to try and make this easier for me,

1033
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,660
but I don't think anything
can make this easier.

1034
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,220
You have to understand that it's dark.

1035
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,660
There is no light.

1036
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:14,060
Seeing you and reading your letters
is like seeing the light when it's gone.

1037
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:17,420
It's even darker than before.

1038
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,660
You're a good brother.

1039
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,620
Sometimes I have dreams
about when we were kids.

1040
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:25,980
Sometimes I cry when I wake up
from those dreams.

1041
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,900
When I'm beside the river
fishing with you,

1042
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,740
those are the dreams
that are the most real,

1043
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,860
the most brilliant.

1044
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:33,860
Now it's me that got caught.

1045
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,700
I'm just like one of those fish.

1046
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,980
Like the fish on the bank
just gasping for air,

1047
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:41,420
knowing that he's done for
and how it seemed like forever

1048
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:44,740
until he would take the last breath.

1049
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,968
That's how I feel now."

1050
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:21,140
I hear you got 80 stitches,

1051
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:23,607
40 in each arm.

1052
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:29,380
Well, don't worry about
what it looks like under there.

1053
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:32,340
A spotted pig's dark at night.

1054
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:35,649
More advice from the Georgia
State penitentiary sage.

1055
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:39,940
So, what, you've been here
so long, everyone's just

1056
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,580
given you a free pass?

1057
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:44,020
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.
- I would.

1058
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:46,580
Out in the yard when
you tripped that big Carp.

1059
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,620
I think that if it was anyone else
that would have a similar fate as him.

1060
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,580
Well, I guess if there was
some benefit to being

1061
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:55,700
in prison for 30 years,

1062
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:58,260
yeah, there just might be one.

1063
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:00,220
Thirty years?

1064
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,500
Nearly.

1065
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,681
What for?

1066
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:09,100
I killed a man.

1067
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,884
I was 18 years old.

1068
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:17,244
I guess my brain hadn't quite
caught up with my body yet.

1069
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:21,300
So we're in the same boat.

1070
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,980
We both stopped living at 18.

1071
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,420
Oh, I'm not dead.

1072
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,820
You might as well be.

1073
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:31,260
Oh, wait a minute. I get it.

1074
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,900
See, comments like that,
that's what made you think

1075
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,300
you could check out of here early, huh?

1076
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,700
Let me tell you something,
son, you're wrong.

1077
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:42,620
As long as you can
pull air into your lungs...

1078
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:45,340
you've got potential.

1079
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:49,100
Potential to help somebody.

1080
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,780
Right up to the very end.

1081
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,540
I read, one time about...

1082
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:58,420
the charm of fishing is that even though

1083
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,940
you are in pursuit
of something that's elusive,

1084
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,020
it's obtainable.

1085
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:09,740
It's like perpetual series
of occasions for hope.

1086
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:14,780
And you don't ever know
when hope's gonna spring up.

1087
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,885
Or redemption.

1088
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:24,380
Yeah, but I'm not a fisherman.

1089
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,460
I'm sitting in a hole waiting
for someone to start

1090
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,660
throwing the dirt in on top of me.

1091
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,500
When's the hope
gonna spring up in there?

1092
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,260
You know something?

1093
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,840
You might just be surprised.

1094
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,529
I forgive you, Pop.

1095
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,690
I forgive you.

1096
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:05,180
Busted windpipe.

1097
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:09,620
By the way, I found this on you
when you came in here.

1098
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:13,020
It was in your pocket.

1099
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:16,203
I guess if the warden
had found it, it'd be his,

1100
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:19,860
but that's only if you kicked.

1101
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:23,089
Since you decided
to stay with us for a while,

1102
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:29,260
that selfish, self-pitying,
most of the time,

1103
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:33,900
not even well written
excuse for a goodbye note?

1104
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,641
Well, that ended up with me
for my reading enjoyment.

1105
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:48,580
"Those in the darkness
have seen a great light.

1106
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:52,740
For those who walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

1107
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:55,844
a new light has dawned."

1108
01:24:55,960 --> 01:25:01,091
Did you ever think about the fact
you might be your brother's light?

1109
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:08,481
Maybe that your dying doesn't
have to be so horrible for him.

1110
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,486
What do I know?

1111
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:19,300
It's funny, though, I was
thinking about the fact that

1112
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:23,740
the two of you started out
as just a couple of little fishermen.

1113
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,260
There's a story in that book
I've seen you carry around

1114
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:30,260
about a couple of fishermen,
Andrew and Peter.

1115
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,780
Remember that one?

1116
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:38,570
Do you know it was Andrew
that led Peter to Jesus?

1117
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:47,100
I've never done this before.

1118
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,820
I knew you seemed
the type to forge new paths.

1119
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,420
Oh, look at you, kid,
you're green as grass.

1120
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:56,700
This being your brother and all,
I just think it's ill advised.

1121
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,220
No, I don't have the experience
with this, but I'd imagine

1122
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,380
that no matter how many times
a person goes through

1123
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:06,220
something like this,
it never really gets much easier.

1124
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:09,483
I don't know. It's unprecedented.

1125
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,060
Well, when you think about it,
there's really no reason

1126
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:13,300
for you to stop this.

1127
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,700
Well, I just worry
that you're not fit for it.

1128
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,326
I'm a man of the cloth, Warden.

1129
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,380
God gives me strength.

1130
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,165
He does not put us in situations
that we cannot handle.

1131
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,980
All right, I'll agree to it.

1132
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,700
Now, usually with the execution
being tomorrow, we use today

1133
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:32,340
to introduce the Chaplain.

1134
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:34,820
Of course in this case,
it's not necessary but we still

1135
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:37,220
got arrangements to be made.

1136
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:40,767
Now, tonight he'll be shackled,
but tomorrow he won't be.

1137
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,820
So, are you comfortable with that?

1138
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:44,420
Yes.

1139
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,330
All right, let's get you
on back there, then.

1140
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:57,881
Good to see you.

1141
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,940
How are you feeling?

1142
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,700
I'm okay.

1143
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,580
There're gonna let me
come see you tomorrow.

1144
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,180
Good.

1145
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:08,328
Listen, Andy, I'm sorry.

1146
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,528
I'm sorry I wasn't better for you.

1147
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:15,620
- I'm sorry that I'm in...
- No.

1148
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:18,140
Try and get some sleep tonight, okay?

1149
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:21,260
Everything's gonna be all right.

1150
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,249
Don't worry so much.

1151
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,820
Pop?

1152
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,520
Last visit.

1153
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:45,260
How you doing, brother?

1154
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:48,020
I know you probably
don't want me saying too much,

1155
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:50,260
but I was thinking outside
right now that if anyone

1156
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:54,380
says I love God yet hates
his brother, then he's a liar.

1157
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:58,140
For anyone who does not love
his brother, whom he has seen,

1158
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:02,006
cannot love God, whom he has not seen.

1159
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,900
Then I did it.

1160
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,780
I forgave Gordon and the Leemasters

1161
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,980
for what they have done.

1162
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:12,660
And it has brought me peace.

1163
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:15,860
Forgiveness is
a transforming gift from God.

1164
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:17,883
It heals, Pete.

1165
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:20,540
I just want to tell you that.

1166
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:22,608
I just want to share that with you.

1167
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:31,500
This one's for Eddie Waters.

1168
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,180
An inmate.

1169
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,780
A friend of mine in here.

1170
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:38,740
- Can you make sure to give it to him?
- Sure.

1171
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:41,969
And this one's for you.

1172
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:46,688
Don't open it until, you know, later.

1173
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,740
Greater love has no man

1174
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:55,320
than he would not give
his life for a friend.

1175
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:29,805
Guard!

1176
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,609
My brother fainted.
He just couldn't take it.

1177
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,891
Someone get a medic!

1178
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,460
I knew it.

1179
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,340
I knew he couldn't handle it.

1180
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:48,540
Get him out of here.

1181
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:51,580
Let's go.

1182
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:53,409
Take care of him.

1183
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,420
What's this for?

1184
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,760
So you won't suffer.

1185
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,290
Anything?

1186
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:27,500
Very well.

1187
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,683
There has been no stay of execution.

1188
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:42,500
Peter Goodwynn.

1189
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:46,340
You have been sentenced
to death by electrocution.

1190
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:52,780
Said sentence to be carried out
today, June the 27th, 1958

1191
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,860
at 12:01 a.m.

1192
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:58,020
Son, do you have any last words?

1193
01:35:58,120 --> 01:35:59,246
I do.

1194
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:06,940
Sin and injustice exist in this world.

1195
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:11,740
Maggie's death and now my own,
it's all a product of sin

1196
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:14,900
and injustice.

1197
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,780
But we are not powerless to sin.

1198
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:22,220
We can confront it
with forgiveness and compassion.

1199
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:25,220
Herbert and Macaire.

1200
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:28,780
By God's amazing grace and love,

1201
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:35,260
I do love you both
and I wholeheartedly forgive you.

1202
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:39,968
I hope my death
may help you in some way.

1203
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:46,300
I am wrongfully here tonight
because of what you did,

1204
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:49,780
but I do forgive you
and more importantly,

1205
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:52,121
I ask God to forgive you,

1206
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:55,540
because in your sinful condition,

1207
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:57,688
you do not know what you are doing.

1208
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:03,802
May God help us all.

1209
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:09,164
I'm ready.

1210
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:14,444
May God have mercy on your soul.

1211
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:21,924
He already has.

1212
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:35,691
Wait.

1213
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:57,100
Hey, hey, take it easy there.

1214
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:59,540
- I've got to get to my brother.
- It's over.

1215
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,020
No, I need to see him.

1216
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:04,020
It's already over.

1217
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:05,326
He's gone.

1218
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:38,140
This is a special report.

1219
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:40,220
We just received a signal
from outside the prison

1220
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:42,482
that Peter Goodwynn
was awaiting the electric chair.

1221
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,180
Ladies and gentleman, just moments ago,

1222
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:47,020
the Georgia State Penitentiary
convicted murderer

1223
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:48,820
Peter Goodwynn
was executed for the death

1224
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:51,241
of 18-year-old Maggie Maloye.

1225
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:22,365
Come on, dear.

1226
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,850
Dear?

1227
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:29,180
I burnt him.

1228
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,500
Had him cremated.

1229
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,523
What a horrible mistake.

1230
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:00,450
I'm sorry.

1231
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:51,042
"Pete, we've been looking
after each other

1232
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:53,300
since we were boys and some time ago

1233
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:56,020
I realized that this was not the end.

1234
01:43:56,120 --> 01:44:00,842
I knew that I could still save you
and in return be saved.

1235
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:04,169
I know in time you will realize
that this was the only way.

1236
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:05,460
Study my journal.

1237
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:08,060
It has everything you'll need
to know about my life.

1238
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:09,780
It's yours now.

1239
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:13,487
You've always shined brighter
than me and people need your light.

1240
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:15,780
On Sunday, you're scheduled
to do the sermon

1241
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:17,700
at the church down the road.

1242
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:20,980
You were always better than me
at public speaking and you'll do fine.

1243
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:24,140
Remember, people will understand
why you're out of sorts

1244
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:27,460
so you don't have to worry
if you appear to act strangely.

1245
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:30,900
Still, I would get in and out,
that way you don't have too hard

1246
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,820
of a test remembering everything
your first day on the job.

1247
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:37,100
And, Pete, remember...

1248
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:41,967
forgiveness is a transforming gift
from God and it heals."

1249
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:44,725
Hello.

1250
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:47,127
I'm Pete and I'll...

1251
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:50,360
Andy.

1252
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:56,580
I'm Andy and I'll be giving
my sermon to y'all today.

1253
01:44:56,680 --> 01:45:01,607
It's about what I want to focus on.

1254
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:05,885
I got nothing.

1255
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:42,220
Hi, Andy.

1256
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:43,940
How are you feeling?

1257
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:45,820
You doing okay?

1258
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:47,580
Yeah, I'm fine.

1259
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:50,460
I know you've been through a lot.
Are you sure you're up to this?

1260
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:51,980
Really, I'm fine.

1261
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:55,482
I need to do this, David.

1262
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:58,100
I understand.

1263
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:00,680
You'll do well, son. You'll do well.

1264
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:14,044
As you all probably know,
my brother is dead.

1265
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:21,401
We have all lost
loved ones in our lives.

1266
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:28,100
The pain of grief
is not an unfamiliar feeling

1267
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:30,567
and taking an aspirin offers no relief.

1268
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:37,684
They say that time heals all wounds.

1269
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:42,127
But I don't completely agree with that.

1270
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:49,721
I think that love is the answer.

1271
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:54,164
Love can fill that
empty void left by loss.

1272
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:11,900
When a man is sentenced to death,

1273
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,927
he goes into a dark place,
as you can imagine.

1274
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:23,330
He strayed.

1275
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:27,740
The love of his life taken from him,

1276
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,980
locked up and removed from his family.

1277
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:33,100
He lost his future, condemned to death,

1278
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:39,060
living every day in a small box
waiting for someone to kill him.

1279
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:44,690
He was angry.
No, he was consumed with hate.

1280
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:51,246
But then something changed.

1281
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:55,780
Pete met a man who changed everything,

1282
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:58,380
who ultimately saved Pete.

1283
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:03,340
Although he knew
he couldn't save Pete's life,

1284
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:04,930
he knew Pete could be saved.

1285
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:08,540
Pete's eternal soul could be saved.

1286
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:13,820
Here's a letter Pete wrote
to this man, Eddie Waters,

1287
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:16,420
who although had spent nearly
the last 30 years in state prison

1288
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:19,020
was able to take Pete
from his dark place

1289
01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:24,860
and show him the light
of eternal love and salvation

1290
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,769
of forgiveness.

1291
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:29,320
Eddie...

1292
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:35,842
when I tried to kill myself,
I was in despair.

1293
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:42,380
I would've died empty,
but I lived and met you

1294
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:48,362
and that meeting changed my life,
what little there was left of it.

1295
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:55,446
You helped me recover my faith
in God and ultimately saved me.

1296
01:48:56,680 --> 01:49:02,140
You made me realize
I wasn't feeling unloved.

1297
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:07,963
I was feeling the inability
to love and to forgive.

1298
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:11,900
You never knew
if I was guilty or innocent.

1299
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:16,050
You never asked
because it didn't matter.

1300
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:22,180
It was your wisdom that saved me.

1301
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:26,260
You made me realize
the only way to truly feel loved

1302
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:29,887
and truly love others...

1303
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,445
is to forgive.

1304
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:38,460
I have been wronged in life,

1305
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:42,940
and there has been unfairness,

1306
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:48,940
but I know it is not for me
to right the wrongs.

1307
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:51,771
I think these passages say it best.

1308
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:59,451
Do not repay any one evil for evil.

1309
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:03,980
Be careful you do what
is right in the eyes of everyone.

1310
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:05,740
If your enemy's hungry, feed him.

1311
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:10,289
If he's thirsty,
give him something to drink.

1312
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:25,300
But never doubt that
there will be justice,

1313
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:27,620
for the good book also says
do not be deceived.

1314
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:30,780
God is not mocked.

1315
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:34,282
For whatsoever a man sows,
that shall he also reap.

1316
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:41,561
So let us all sow with great care,

1317
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:44,606
with great love.

1318
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:50,140
Remember that each of us
has become a new being,

1319
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:55,007
created in God's likeness,
righteous, holy, and true.

1320
01:50:56,080 --> 01:51:00,608
So put away all falsehood
and speak truth

1321
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:07,100
because we are all members
of one another.

1322
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:11,762
Do not be overcome by evil,
but overcome evil with good.

1323
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:18,204
Seek God's love.

1324
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:32,686
Forgive and receive God's love
and reflect it back into the world.

1325
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:57,806
<i>Can you hear Amazing Grace?</i>

1326
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:05,086
<i>How sweet the sound</i>

1327
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:12,686
<i>It saved a wretch like me</i>

1328
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:18,846
<i>I was lost but now I'm found</i>

1329
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:30,886
<i>We've been here 10,000 years</i>

1330
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:44,560
<i>We've no less days to sing God's praise</i>

1331
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:26,971
<i>Can you hear Amazing Grace?</i>

1332
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:33,526
<i>Oh, how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me</i>

1333
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:47,686
<i>I was lost but now I'm found</i>

1334
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:55,120
<i>Can you hear Amazing Grace?</i>

1335
01:54:56,960 --> 01:55:02,091
<i>Oh, how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me</i>

1336
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:16,166
<i>I was lost but now I'm found</i>

1337
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:23,486
<i>I was lost but now I'm found</i>

1338
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:46,323
<i>When all that's left is to surrender</i>

1339
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:52,762
<i>Sleep will finally come tonight</i>

1340
01:55:56,120 --> 01:55:59,806
<i>And if you dream you will remember</i>

1341
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:08,660
<i>There's nothing left for you to hide</i>

1342
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:12,900
<i>Within your faith</i>

1343
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:16,300
<i>You can come to the conclusion</i>

1344
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:22,700
<i>That your life is just
illusion in your mind</i>

1345
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:26,930
<i>Down in your soul</i>

1346
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:31,660
<i>You can make renewed decision of the way</i>

1347
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:37,927
<i>That you've been living in your life</i>

1348
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:43,325
<i>Peace will finally come and find you</i>

1349
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:50,371
<i>And His love will set you free</i>

1350
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:57,962
<i>Stand by him and he will guide you</i>

1351
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:05,361
<i>And lead you to your destiny</i>

1352
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:09,402
<i>And with your faith</i>

1353
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:13,420
<i>There can be a new beginning</i>

1354
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:20,420
<i>And an end to all
the sinning in your life</i>

1355
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:24,380
<i>And this embrace</i>

1356
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:27,900
<i>You can make renewed decision</i>

1357
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:35,805
<i>Of the way that
you've been living in your life</i>

1358
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:38,940
<i>Yours alone</i>

1359
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:42,123
<i>And you never know</i>

1360
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:48,327
<i>About the magic
that's been missing in your life</i>

1361
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:52,940
<i>And there you go</i>

1362
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:56,420
<i>And you're losing all control</i>

1363
01:57:56,520 --> 01:58:03,244
<i>But you got to get it back
while there's still time</i>

1364
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:14,128
<i>A two-legged highway
and the wings of a dove</i>

1365
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:20,406
<i>Am I headed the right way
if I'm looking for love?</i>

1366
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:25,848
<i>St. Chris on my mirror
like a map from above</i>

1367
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:32,726
<i>Am I headed the right way
if I'm looking for love?</i>

1368
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:39,100
<i>If we go as far as your eyes can see</i>

1369
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:44,020
<i>When you close them now,
do you look to find me?</i>

1370
01:58:44,120 --> 01:58:46,820
<i>Now I'm moving about as forward</i>

1371
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:51,448
<i>As a dead blackbird flies</i>

1372
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:58,286
<i>I'm beginning to think
we won't see the sunrise</i>

1373
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:04,720
<i>I've given this loving
the best that I can</i>

1374
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:12,008
<i>10,000 times now I've held out my hand</i>

1375
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:17,490
<i>Now it's broken and bleeding
and being dragged through the sand</i>

1376
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:23,841
<i>At 10,000 times now
I've held out my hand</i>

1377
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:30,326
<i>But you never took hold
of that guilty blow</i>

1378
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:35,401
<i>And did what I felt
until you fell in love</i>

1379
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:41,482
<i>Now I'm moving about as forward
as a dead blackbird flies</i>

1380
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:49,366
<i>I'm beginning to think
we won't see the sunrise</i>

1381
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:58,329
<i>You once loved me, I know</i>

1382
01:59:59,480 --> 02:00:03,300
<i>And my love for you somehow still goes</i>

1383
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:08,964
<i>But I don't hear my name
in your voice anymore</i>
