1
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:07,614
I've got you now.

2
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,129
That's it,
my little misunderstood friend.

3
00:01:23,196 --> 00:01:25,391
Nibble the powdery cinnamon bliss.

4
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:31,794
No! Your path ends in death!

5
00:02:24,024 --> 00:02:27,118
No-o-o-o-!...

6
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:42,971
You have been saved.
No charge.

7
00:02:46,346 --> 00:02:47,813
Aaargh!

8
00:02:48,715 --> 00:02:52,515
This is certainly an ironic situation,

9
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:55,054
with an apex predator there
and me over here,

10
00:02:55,122 --> 00:02:58,319
holding this little guy
at the bottom of the food chain and all.

11
00:02:58,392 --> 00:03:00,883
Hey, Mom!
Look what I found.

12
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:03,890
Ace Irwin Ventura,
get outta that habitat...

13
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:06,491
and away from that man-eating
alligator this instant!

14
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:08,559
OK.

15
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:10,296
Stay!

16
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,769
Aaaaargh!

17
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,605
- How many times have I told you?
- A million.

18
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:20,942
- Visiting me...
- is a privilege.

19
00:03:21,014 --> 00:03:22,242
And this is the last time...

20
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,543
- I get to come here if I behave...
- you gonna behave this way.

21
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:28,044
- I'm serious, Ace.
- You're alway s serious, Mom.

22
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:29,053
And do you know why?

23
00:03:29,054 --> 00:03:31,854
Because you're not gonna loose me
like you lost Dad.

24
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:38,796
I'm sorry, Mom. I don't know why
I had to save him, I just did.

25
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,494
It's a mouse, Ace.

26
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,628
That's why we have traps here.

27
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:48,640
You are not, I repeat, not... responsible
for every stray animal...

28
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,199
in every corner of this planet.

29
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:57,241
- I'm not?
- No!

30
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:00,950
Now give me the mouse.

31
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:07,792
And the hedgehog.

32
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:12,692
And the guinea pig.

33
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:14,893
And the ferret.

34
00:04:16,102 --> 00:04:17,763
And the toad.

35
00:04:17,838 --> 00:04:20,398
Oh! There we go.

36
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:23,671
What?

37
00:04:23,743 --> 00:04:26,644
- Baby gator.
- What baby gator?

38
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:31,116
Fine. Here.

39
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:33,883
Now you're late for school.
Let's go.

40
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:35,945
- Hey, what's that?
- Ace!

41
00:04:36,022 --> 00:04:39,753
- What's going on over here?
- Honey. Honey, come back here.

42
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:41,817
- Ace. OK, look...
- Pong Ping?

43
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:43,357
The Chinese government
has loaned us...

44
00:04:43,358 --> 00:04:46,858
Pong Ping and Ting Tang,
the world's most famous pandas.

45
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,734
There's gonna be an unveiling
next week. Now...

46
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:52,067
I know. I promise.

47
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:56,768
No trying to find missing pets
or helping animals or any thing.

48
00:04:56,843 --> 00:05:02,475
- Even if they're about to get run over.
- OK, that's not what I mean.

49
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:05,643
And I will try to be normal.

50
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:10,588
Thank you, A.J.
Now will you please go to school?

51
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:12,284
OK.

52
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,193
Normal.

53
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:20,790
Normal.

54
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:25,133
Must be normal.

55
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:27,730
Tara, is it true
what happened to your pet?

56
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:32,904
Yeah. I woke up this morning
and my pet rabbit Mimzy was totally gone.

57
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:36,680
Rabbit. Mimzy. Lost!

58
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,948
- Of course we're depressed.
- Our skunk's been missing two weeks.

59
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:43,319
We're emotional wrecks about it.

60
00:05:44,257 --> 00:05:47,715
I will be normal.

61
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:52,131
- My friend can't find her chinchilla.
- This is really weird.

62
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:55,065
It's an animal-nabbing epidemic!

63
00:05:55,135 --> 00:05:58,229
- Laura, what about you?
- You think that's bad?

64
00:05:58,305 --> 00:06:02,070
The other day, Greeny, my
incredibly rare emerald-green koi fish,

65
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,471
vanished out of the aquarium.

66
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:06,171
Aargh!

67
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:14,520
Your attention, please.
I have some sad news.

68
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:17,955
Mr. Chompers, our beloved
swim-team mascot, has gone missing.

69
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:19,457
Awww.

70
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:21,226
Any student
with information...

71
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:24,727
is requested to report
to the pool immediately.

72
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:32,871
Well, he's gone.

73
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:35,203
Do you know
where our mascot is or not?

74
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:40,679
- Well, I wouldn't say I know where he is.
- But you know who took him?

75
00:06:40,747 --> 00:06:43,682
- Not exactly.
- But you have some kind of lead?

76
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,083
- Define "lead".
- Forget this loser.

77
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:49,485
No. Wait!
I can find him.

78
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:53,925
- What makes you think that?
- I just... know I can.

79
00:06:53,994 --> 00:06:57,088
Ooh, what are you?
Some kind of pet...

80
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,931
finder guy?

81
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:12,904
Just give me four days.
What have you got to lose?

82
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:15,174
You got 72 hours.

83
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:18,477
OK. 72 hours.

84
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:21,213
That's like... two weeks.

85
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:22,777
That's great!

86
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:29,888
I know what Mom said, but this
is important, she won't find out.

87
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:37,160
Cowboy up, dog, because we're not
just gonna go find Mr. Chompers.

88
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:40,434
I hear a whole lot of lost pets
calling my name.

89
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:51,774
That'll do it.

90
00:07:51,851 --> 00:07:54,181
This is the busiest intersection
in town, Ox.

91
00:07:56,056 --> 00:07:58,650
Thousands of people will see this.

92
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:04,562
Recognize your Mimzy?

93
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:07,464
- No.
- Number three, hop to the right.

94
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:10,025
Uh-oh.
Number one just went number two.

95
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:12,628
Number four,
stop doing that to number three!

96
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:15,402
Would you guys stop multiplying?

97
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:18,943
Well, how about now?

98
00:08:19,012 --> 00:08:21,446
Lost hamster.
Milk for Milton.

99
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:24,574
Help find Milton.
Runaway rodent.

100
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:27,677
Do a brother a solid.
Milk for Milton.

101
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:29,688
Please, help find Milton.

102
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,087
- I found Milton!
- No. Uh-uh.

103
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:36,017
I didn't find Milton.

104
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:42,592
Offensive action!
Three, two, one.

105
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:51,307
Now, that's offensive.

106
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:55,643
- Stop toying with our emotions.
- That's not Breezy, moron!

107
00:08:55,715 --> 00:08:58,047
Skunk!

108
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:08,183
Waaaaah!

109
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:11,924
It's called "papering the town,"
Oxnard.

110
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,195
Avery effective method
for disseminating information.

111
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:33,782
That's not true. I treat every one
of my missing pets exactly the same,

112
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:36,283
no matter who they belong to.

113
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:39,553
Well, here we are, Ox.

114
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:41,787
Casa de Laura Wilson's house.

115
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:44,824
The scene of the crime.

116
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:50,293
Sorry, old friend. Now's not the time
to tell Laura how I feel.

117
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,804
I am not scared to talk to her.

118
00:09:55,074 --> 00:10:00,205
Oh, you think so, huh?
Yeah, well, watch and learn, Puppy Chow.

119
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,410
We'll find her pet, and then I'll find
time to express how I really feel.

120
00:10:04,484 --> 00:10:08,147
- Hi, Ace.
- Oh, my God, you're pretty!

121
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:11,953
What?

122
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:13,219
Um...

123
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:15,557
Your koi fish.

124
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:18,620
She's itty-bitty.

125
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:20,757
Yeah, she sure is.

126
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:24,193
Much like a grunion.

127
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,535
Stand aside, ma'am.
Clues don't find themselves, you know.

128
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:30,167
Oxnard, while I'm young?

129
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,738
Crime scene is secure.
No sign of forced entries.

130
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:38,477
Initial suspects include the scuba man
and the treasure chest.

131
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:49,284
Remember when I brought her into school
as part of my report on unusual animals?

132
00:10:49,362 --> 00:10:52,229
The next morning when I woke up,
Greeny was gone.

133
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:54,289
Really?

134
00:10:56,636 --> 00:11:00,470
Case number 349A49320451.

135
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,633
Neptune-Alpha-Charlie-Horse.

136
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:06,008
Missing green koi fish.
Answers to Greeny.

137
00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:09,772
Question.
Have you tried calling her?

138
00:11:09,849 --> 00:11:12,511
- Calling her? She's a fish.
- Uh-uh-uh.

139
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,455
- May I?
- Sure.

140
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:26,829
Greeny!

141
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,392
Greeny! Greeny!

142
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:34,538
Greeny!

143
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:36,598
Yoo-hoo!

144
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:41,507
- Well, she's gone.
- Yeah.

145
00:11:42,282 --> 00:11:44,273
Owner is one Laura Wilson.

146
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,081
Smart, funny, great listener.

147
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:50,952
Excellent personal hy gene,

148
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:53,754
a smile that'll make you feel
like pudding inside

149
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:56,420
and skin like peaches and cream.

150
00:11:57,163 --> 00:12:00,963
Except for may be this one spot
on her perfectly formed chin.

151
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:04,697
- Possibly a pimple?
- A pimple? Where?!

152
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:07,399
Oh, I'm such an idiot.

153
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:09,941
No one asked you. Um...

154
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:12,034
Oxnard and I must be going now.

155
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:14,648
Anyway, your collection
of aquatic friends...

156
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:17,049
will have their emerald
companion back in, um...

157
00:12:19,252 --> 00:12:20,617
three days.

158
00:12:20,687 --> 00:12:23,087
- Really?
- I promise.

159
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:26,924
You broke your promise.
What did I tell you?

160
00:12:26,993 --> 00:12:29,996
That I'm not responsible for
the well-being of every stray animal...

161
00:12:29,997 --> 00:12:31,697
in every corner of the planet.

162
00:12:31,865 --> 00:12:32,934
But, Mom, I had to.

163
00:12:32,935 --> 00:12:36,435
Do you think I like scooping
poop all day? I don't.

164
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:41,534
I got this job so you could see animals
as much as you want, when you want,

165
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:43,939
safely and with complete supervision.

166
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,410
Yeah, but it's not the same, OK?

167
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:50,313
I want to find lost animals.
I love it.

168
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:54,342
OK, I tried every other extracurricular
activity you wanted me to...

169
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,445
and I mastered them all.

170
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:02,955
What?

171
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:04,826
Aaaaaaaaaah!

172
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:11,200
Next.

173
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:17,743
Bananas.

174
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,302
P- r-e-t-t-y.
Pretty.

175
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:23,781
That is correct.

176
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,480
Your word is
"antidisestablishmentarianism".

177
00:13:29,655 --> 00:13:31,850
P- r-e-t-t-y.

178
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:34,017
Pretty.

179
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:50,668
This was a dumb idea!

180
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:57,706
Aaaaaargh! Argh!

181
00:13:57,784 --> 00:14:01,311
OK, may be I didn't
master all of them,

182
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:04,686
but may be athletics
aren't my calling.

183
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,820
W... wait,
was Dad an athlete?

184
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:10,055
A good speller?
An entertainer?

185
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:13,929
This is not about your dad.
We'll talk about him another time.

186
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,096
- Mom, you always say that.
- I'm not ready for that talk yet.

187
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:20,471
We can have it when you're older.

188
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,043
I am older, Mom.
I'm 12 years old...

189
00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:25,044
and I'm starting to have
all these weird feelings...

190
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:27,136
and I don't have a dad for...

191
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:29,272
"that talk".

192
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:34,310
Honey, everybody your age
has those feelings.

193
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:36,446
No, Mom.

194
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:42,292
Not these feelings.

195
00:14:45,465 --> 00:14:48,698
That's it! You are not eating
out of a dog bowl,

196
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:50,699
you are not sticking your head
out of a car window...

197
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,164
and you're gonna use the toilet
for something other than drinking.

198
00:14:53,165 --> 00:14:55,265
And you're gonna be
like other kids!

199
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:58,208
- But, Mom, this is who I am.
- No, it's not.

200
00:14:58,277 --> 00:15:00,541
It's who you're acting like.

201
00:15:39,152 --> 00:15:41,643
Huh?!

202
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:55,460
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mom.

203
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:58,622
- Hey, what's with that hat on?
- What hat?

204
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:02,361
- Ace.
- It's what all the kids are doing.

205
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:06,804
You said you wanted me to be like them,
so here you go.

206
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:10,605
Not at the table.

207
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:25,487
Mom.
Mom, the cereal!

208
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:27,822
- Oh, my God.
- What?

209
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:30,191
- It's happening.
- What is it?

210
00:17:30,263 --> 00:17:32,527
Put your hands up!

211
00:17:36,302 --> 00:17:38,463
Stay still!

212
00:17:40,273 --> 00:17:42,434
Don't move!

213
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:46,104
- Melissa Ventura?
- Yeah.

214
00:17:46,178 --> 00:17:49,944
Oh, wow. One more punch
and you get a free yogurt.

215
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,544
What? "The Cinnamon Hippo"?
Is that like Chuck E Cheese?

216
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,953
Never mind that.
Russell Hollander, NBFW.

217
00:17:58,024 --> 00:18:03,087
- National Bureau of Fish and Wildlife.
- Smart kid. I'm in charge here.

218
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:06,723
Do you have any idea how often
they let a member of Fish and Wildlife...

219
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:08,624
lead a SWAT team?

220
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:13,365
Yeah. Never. You guys don't even
get badges. You wear patches.

221
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:17,136
Give me that. I'll have you arrested
for assaulting a federal officer.

222
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:20,975
OK, fine. Jeez.
But, technically, police dogs outrank you.

223
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:22,448
Ranger Hollander?

224
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:24,449
- They're towing your car, sir.
- Again?

225
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:27,714
Wait. Can't you just tell us
what you're looking for?

226
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:29,424
Your case is the biggest thing
in service history.

227
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:31,725
They will be calling guys back
from Alaska for this.

228
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:34,125
Playing dumb isn't gonna work.

229
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:36,730
You left a lotta evidence
at the scene, Mrs. Ventura.

230
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:39,131
We found your shoeprints
all over the place.

231
00:18:39,198 --> 00:18:43,157
- In English, Ranger Smith.
- Ting Tang has been stolen.

232
00:18:44,003 --> 00:18:46,801
My mom works for the zoo.
Of course her footprints are there.

233
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:50,171
And your bank accounts show
you've been living paycheck-to-paycheck.

234
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:53,177
I suspect a panda cub
brings big bucks on the black market.

235
00:18:53,245 --> 00:18:55,736
We've found something, sir!

236
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:00,809
What is this?

237
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,223
Your ransom note?

238
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:09,524
Somebody sent that to us.
I don't even know what that means.

239
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:13,326
- And this.
- A tranquilizer gun.

240
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:17,301
- Sir, your finger... prints.
- Recently fired.

241
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,931
They give us all tranquilizer guns.
I used it to sedate a chimpanzee.

242
00:19:21,006 --> 00:19:22,842
That was actually very funny.

243
00:19:22,843 --> 00:19:24,943
He grabbed a hold of this
tourist's leg and started...

244
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,841
That's enough, Ace.

245
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:29,437
Melissa Ventura,

246
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:31,676
you're under arrest.

247
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:33,878
- What?
- Whoa, whoa!

248
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:36,183
Down, boy! Down, boy!
Down, boy! Down! Down!

249
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:39,317
It's all been a mistake.
It's all been a mistake.

250
00:19:39,318 --> 00:19:42,518
Now there you go. There you go.
We'll sort it all out.

251
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:46,554
That's so good. It's like chocolate.
Mm. They're so addictive.

252
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:51,541
Come on.

253
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:56,442
Not until I can make a call
for someone to stay with my son.

254
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,543
Give her the cellphone.

255
00:19:58,544 --> 00:20:00,544
It'll be alright Mom,
I'll find Ting Tang.

256
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:04,845
No. You promised.
I don't want you to do any thing, Ace.

257
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:07,811
One call.

258
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:13,087
- OK, while you walk. Come on.
- I'm gonna call his grandfather.

259
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:16,890
But, Mom, Grandpa's gonna be
on a cruise for another four weeks.

260
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:20,193
- I'm calling your other grandpa.
- What other grandpa?

261
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:22,131
Grandpa...

262
00:20:24,203 --> 00:20:26,967
- Ventura.
- Huh?

263
00:20:28,073 --> 00:20:30,541
Rex? It's Melissa.

264
00:20:51,263 --> 00:20:54,699
Come on, Spark.
Come on, Spark.

265
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:57,133
Sorry about that.

266
00:21:01,106 --> 00:21:03,540
Hello, Ace.

267
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:05,236
Grandpa?

268
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:08,474
First thing, your mom is fine.

269
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:12,677
She's gonna have a bail hearing on Friday.
You can see her then.

270
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:22,761
Darn hairballs.
What can you do?

271
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:24,853
My cat's on his eighth life.

272
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,899
There are some spots
he's simply too old to lick himself.

273
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:32,333
Too much information.

274
00:21:32,634 --> 00:21:37,534
Well, Ace, I haven't seen you
since you were a baby.

275
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,272
What're you now?
84?

276
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:43,281
- Grandpa, I'm 12.
- Right. Dog years.

277
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:45,681
84 years old.

278
00:21:46,185 --> 00:21:49,211
I'll bet you're helping animals by now,
aren't you?

279
00:21:49,288 --> 00:21:51,688
Come on,
show me your office.

280
00:21:52,658 --> 00:21:57,027
Come on, Sparky.
Come on, Sparky. Here we go.

281
00:21:57,096 --> 00:21:58,791
Attaboy.

282
00:21:58,864 --> 00:22:02,391
So, these are the animals
you're trying to find, huh?

283
00:22:02,468 --> 00:22:06,097
Well, I was,
but then Mom said it was too dangerous.

284
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:08,901
Re-he-eally?

285
00:22:15,848 --> 00:22:18,646
Hi, Ace.

286
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:23,382
- You obsess much?
- What? About Laura? No, not really.

287
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:26,515
Sometimes.
May be. Yeah, I do.

288
00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:30,961
- Hey, Grandpa, can I ask you a question?
- Sure thing.

289
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,828
What was my dad like?

290
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:37,233
Well, what did your mom
tell you about him?

291
00:22:37,303 --> 00:22:41,672
Nothing. She says that he disappeared
on a business trip when I was a baby

292
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,935
and that I'm too young
to know the rest.

293
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:48,275
Yeah, well, your mom's got good reasons
why she doesn't want to talk about him.

294
00:22:48,347 --> 00:22:50,338
But can I ask you this?

295
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:54,853
Have you ever wondered
why you keep looking for lost animals?

296
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,219
- Because...
- Because why?

297
00:22:59,358 --> 00:23:02,885
- I don't know.
- Because you're a Ventura!

298
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:05,889
A Ventura.

299
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:12,696
Now, although it took a long time
for our ancestors to develop a kinship

300
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:14,898
with the animal world,

301
00:23:14,974 --> 00:23:17,408
eventually,
we won them over.

302
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:20,036
Even the carnivores.

303
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:23,447
Down through history,
the Ventura line continued,

304
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:26,814
including Charles Ventura Darwin.

305
00:23:26,885 --> 00:23:29,410
You know who he was, don't you?

306
00:23:29,488 --> 00:23:31,547
He was the evolution guy, right?

307
00:23:31,624 --> 00:23:37,927
Survival of the least
loo-hoo-hoo-oser-est.

308
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:42,690
Did you know
a Ventura would never harm an animal?

309
00:23:42,768 --> 00:23:45,902
One of your ancestors,
the great Antarctic explorer...

310
00:23:45,903 --> 00:23:48,503
Sir Ernest Ventura Shackleton.

311
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:50,804
Although he and his crew
were starving to death,

312
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:53,205
they would not eat a penguin.

313
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:56,372
Jacques Ventura Cousteau,

314
00:23:56,448 --> 00:23:58,882
who invented the scuba suit...

315
00:23:58,951 --> 00:24:03,149
so that finally man could commune
with his watery brethren.

316
00:24:03,222 --> 00:24:05,782
Fit like a glove.

317
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:11,524
So, you see, Ace Jr. the Ventura line
has a long and storied career...

318
00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:13,588
of animal advocacy,

319
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:17,830
communion
and search and search and rescue.

320
00:24:17,903 --> 00:24:21,566
Well, was my dad
like the other Venturas?

321
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:26,139
I've probably said too much already,

322
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:30,238
but your mom was in trouble
and I thought you needed to know.

323
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:34,945
So, what you're saying is that I should
go out and try to find Ting Tang?

324
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,456
I'm not saying anything.

325
00:24:39,324 --> 00:24:41,588
I'm just saying.

326
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,254
Saying what?

327
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,496
Your Y chromosome
has the Ventura mutation.

328
00:24:49,568 --> 00:24:53,060
You're one of us.

329
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,205
- Come on, Sparky.
- Um... Grandpa, I'm...

330
00:24:58,277 --> 00:25:01,007
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

331
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:05,716
He's not dead.
He's sleeping.

332
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:08,981
Come on.
Did you hear what he said? My goodness.

333
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:11,488
My goodness!

334
00:25:29,408 --> 00:25:31,475
Hey, if I say over the wall,
it's over the wall.

335
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:34,176
Don't be a maverick.
Let's go.

336
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:35,338
Aaaargh!

337
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:41,875
Jeez! I didn't know
the lunch lady had a night job.

338
00:25:43,822 --> 00:25:47,349
"Russell Hollander,
NBFW CSI: Orlando".

339
00:25:48,427 --> 00:25:53,455
I like the way that sounds. I left no
stone unturned, no clue undiscovered.

340
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:56,194
Case closed,
Melissa Ventura.

341
00:25:56,835 --> 00:25:58,168
You are guilty.

342
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:01,569
That guy is one
big-time sick monkey, my friend.

343
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:24,487
Case number 349A49320452.
Alpha-Beta-Delta-Airlines.

344
00:26:24,563 --> 00:26:27,396
Missing panda cub.
Answers to Ting Tang.

345
00:26:27,466 --> 00:26:31,095
Or, if you speak Panda, "Grrrrr".

346
00:26:31,637 --> 00:26:34,367
On loan from national government.

347
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,464
Country: China.

348
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:40,000
Crime scene
shows no sign of disturbance.

349
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:42,911
As expected,
my mom's shoeprints are everyw where.

350
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:45,313
And the only other prints are panda...

351
00:26:46,185 --> 00:26:48,244
Or are they?

352
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:53,189
Holy roly-poly!

353
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:58,260
I knew it.

354
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:01,661
Uh-oh.

355
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:07,605
Hey, look, Pong Ping,
I'm a family friend.

356
00:27:07,673 --> 00:27:11,268
I knew your uncle when he was here.
Chan Chin, or...

357
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:16,739
Uh, Bing Bang, or...

358
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:20,342
Hong Kong?
Wang Chung?

359
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,290
You miss your cub?

360
00:27:29,161 --> 00:27:31,152
Yeah, I miss my mom, too.

361
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:38,002
But I found some really important clues
while I was here.

362
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:44,801
I'm not the world's greatest, uh...

363
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:48,106
pet sleuth?

364
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:52,914
Finder? Investigator?
I don't know.

365
00:27:52,985 --> 00:27:55,010
But...

366
00:27:55,087 --> 00:27:56,816
but I'll try.

367
00:27:56,889 --> 00:27:59,084
I promise.

368
00:28:16,241 --> 00:28:19,142
Hey, kid!
Are you Arnold Plushinski?

369
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:21,543
Yeah, but call me A~Plus.
Aargh!

370
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:24,741
You're dead, Plushinski!
I mean it!

371
00:28:24,816 --> 00:28:26,613
Move!

372
00:28:26,685 --> 00:28:28,744
Uh-oh.
That can't be good.

373
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:37,428
Proximity alert.
Proximity alert. Prox...

374
00:28:37,496 --> 00:28:41,364
Just give up the gummies, Plushinski,
and the horrorwill end!

375
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:43,401
Never!

376
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,362
Excuse me.

377
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:49,073
Move!

378
00:28:55,447 --> 00:28:58,109
Argh! Aaargh!

379
00:29:01,386 --> 00:29:04,844
Move it!
Get out of the way!

380
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:09,656
Where is he? You can't hide
the gummies forever, Plushinski!

381
00:29:13,498 --> 00:29:15,295
Where'd he go?

382
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,173
Hello?

383
00:29:30,248 --> 00:29:33,012
A- Plus?

384
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:35,553
Why are you talking to me?

385
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:37,921
Who just said that?

386
00:29:37,922 --> 00:29:40,922
No one ever talks to me,
except bullies.

387
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:44,054
You're not gonna beat me up, are you?

388
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:47,257
No. I need your help.

389
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:50,628
Oh. In here.

390
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:08,483
What the...

391
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:09,952
Awesome!

392
00:30:13,925 --> 00:30:16,223
Awesome.

393
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:35,976
Holy cellar-dweller, Batman!

394
00:30:36,048 --> 00:30:39,381
This place is...
How did you build this?

395
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:43,785
This whole place was forgotten about
during a renovation, but I found a way in.

396
00:30:43,855 --> 00:30:46,323
Made my lab.

397
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:48,689
I can't believe I have a friend

398
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,196
and I didn't even
have to grow him in a petri dish.

399
00:30:52,631 --> 00:30:55,998
Oh, my God,
those are giant gummy worms.

400
00:30:56,068 --> 00:30:58,332
Hey! Uh, st...

401
00:30:58,403 --> 00:31:00,564
- That's a bully-tracking device.
- Huh?

402
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:03,540
They transmit to my GPS here.

403
00:31:03,608 --> 00:31:07,601
A bully eats a harmless-looking candy
and it gets into his digestive tract.

404
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,477
I can track him
for up to 18 hours.

405
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:13,040
- 12 if he eats chili.
- Ugh!

406
00:31:13,118 --> 00:31:15,143
So, how can I help you...

407
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,347
friend?

408
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:21,756
Um... I have some measurements
that I need analyzed.

409
00:31:21,827 --> 00:31:24,457
These prints are
1.5 mm deep,

410
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:27,858
as differentiated from these,
which are 2.3 mm...

411
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:30,026
and these,
which are 5 mm.

412
00:31:30,102 --> 00:31:31,165
Fascinating, Captain.

413
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:35,666
These measurements clearly indicate
prints made by 3 very different organisms,

414
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,573
weighing approximately 125 pounds,

415
00:31:38,643 --> 00:31:41,111
183.253 pounds...

416
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:44,114
and 390 pounds respectively.

417
00:31:45,617 --> 00:31:48,313
So, any thing else?

418
00:31:48,386 --> 00:31:51,152
How long would it take for you
to hack into a website called...

419
00:31:51,153 --> 00:31:54,553
"www. pandafanatic. com"?

420
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:58,357
We're in like Tolkien. Here's a picture
of the guy who runs the site.

421
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:03,333
His e-mail address is
m. sickinger@penningtoncorp. net.

422
00:32:04,202 --> 00:32:08,832
Pennington Corporation.
That's Pennington Jr's father's company.

423
00:32:08,907 --> 00:32:10,134
Oh, he's so cool.

424
00:32:10,135 --> 00:32:12,935
Isn't that the kid who rides to school
in a limousine everyday?

425
00:32:13,011 --> 00:32:16,139
Yes, and he's
extraordinarily popular.

426
00:32:16,214 --> 00:32:20,617
Of all the tables in the cafeteria,
his is the furthest away from mine.

427
00:32:22,821 --> 00:32:25,756
- Do you mind if I keep one of these?
- Of course.

428
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:28,793
OK. I'll just...
I'll just, um...

429
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,919
be on my way.

430
00:32:31,796 --> 00:32:34,629
I'll be on my way.
I will talk to you later.

431
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:38,658
Really? And you won't even pretend
like I'm not there or give me a swirly?

432
00:32:38,737 --> 00:32:41,501
- No, no.
- Awesome!

433
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:48,912
- Grandpa,
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

434
00:32:49,113 --> 00:32:50,513
No!...

435
00:32:50,582 --> 00:32:53,176
He's just a good actor.

436
00:32:53,251 --> 00:32:55,310
Dead dogs don't get dinner.

437
00:32:57,689 --> 00:32:59,816
Huh. All right.

438
00:33:07,365 --> 00:33:10,027
Hard day at the office?

439
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:13,400
It's just that I found all these clues
to help Mom's case,

440
00:33:13,471 --> 00:33:17,134
but to do that,
I had to break my promise to her.

441
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:20,576
So, you're working on a case?

442
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:22,311
Yeah.

443
00:33:22,312 --> 00:33:24,312
You know what they call those
working on cases, don't you?

444
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:27,317
Yeah. Cops.

445
00:33:27,385 --> 00:33:32,345
Face it, Grandpa. I'm just a kid who lied
to his mom, I don't know what to do.

446
00:33:32,424 --> 00:33:36,383
Well, you can start
by being who you are.

447
00:33:37,662 --> 00:33:39,857
Who you were born to be.

448
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:45,967
Now, lying to your mom is one thing,

449
00:33:46,037 --> 00:33:48,403
butlying to yourself, Ace Jr...

450
00:33:49,641 --> 00:33:53,236
Son, that leads to
a life of disappointment.

451
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:12,790
That's not normal.

452
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:16,356
I will be normal.

453
00:34:17,936 --> 00:34:19,369
Hah!

454
00:34:19,437 --> 00:34:24,204
Hi, this is Pennington Jr.
With a very special message just for you.

455
00:34:24,276 --> 00:34:27,404
You're invited to my birthday party.
Lucky you.

456
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:30,039
Yes, I'm invited.
I'm invited.

457
00:34:30,115 --> 00:34:33,573
I'm invited!

458
00:34:33,652 --> 00:34:36,382
Uh-uh-uh-uh. Press.

459
00:34:36,454 --> 00:34:40,220
Perez Ventura.
I'm here to interview Pennington Jr.

460
00:34:40,292 --> 00:34:41,687
No, not on the list.

461
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:43,888
List? What list? I don't care
about no stinking list!

462
00:34:43,962 --> 00:34:47,261
I'm with the, uh...
the Daily Rumor Mill.

463
00:34:47,332 --> 00:34:50,733
School paper.
Familiar with freedom of the press?

464
00:34:50,802 --> 00:34:54,829
It's in something called the Constitution.
You should read it sometime.

465
00:34:55,273 --> 00:34:58,936
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't Taser me, bro.
First-Amendment violation.

466
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,103
Let him through.

467
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:03,409
Put him down, boys.

468
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:06,112
Now that's admissible evidence.

469
00:35:06,113 --> 00:35:07,913
I haven't been
humiliated like this...

470
00:35:07,914 --> 00:35:11,814
since they started making us
shower after P.E. Ugh!

471
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,786
We're on a tight schedule.
You got three minutes.

472
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:24,331
Is that a forest up there?
Man, you gotta clip those nose hairs.

473
00:35:24,402 --> 00:35:26,700
You could make
a teddy bear out of that.

474
00:35:26,771 --> 00:35:29,103
Wow.

475
00:35:30,075 --> 00:35:31,376
You cleaned up
Big Foot here real nice.

476
00:35:31,377 --> 00:35:34,877
We Penningtons pride ourselves
on good relations with the press.

477
00:35:34,946 --> 00:35:38,814
But the invitations have been recorded.
There's really nothing I can do.

478
00:35:38,883 --> 00:35:42,478
- Waiter, lunch.
- Please, take this pass.

479
00:35:42,554 --> 00:35:45,056
It will get you into the school
gymnasium on the day of the party,

480
00:35:45,057 --> 00:35:47,857
where we'll be webcasting
the whole thing.

481
00:35:47,926 --> 00:35:49,025
It'll make headlines.

482
00:35:49,026 --> 00:35:52,626
Oh, that's terrific, sport.
Here's a few for you.

483
00:35:52,697 --> 00:35:56,098
"Billionaire Boy
In Liposuction Incident".

484
00:35:56,167 --> 00:36:00,328
Or... "I Had Pennington Jr's
Alien Love Baby".

485
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:02,129
I'm great with Photoshop.

486
00:36:02,207 --> 00:36:04,137
You're threatening
to invade my privacy...

487
00:36:04,138 --> 00:36:06,338
and blackmail me
unless I give you information.

488
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:08,971
I'm a paparazzi.
It's what I do.

489
00:36:09,047 --> 00:36:13,484
But I will get off your back
if you tell me about this guy.

490
00:36:16,621 --> 00:36:19,320
Dr. Michael Sickinger.
A... a brilliant scientist...

491
00:36:19,321 --> 00:36:21,821
who worked for our
animal-genetics laboratory.

492
00:36:21,893 --> 00:36:24,623
- It's one of the finest.
- Indubitably.

493
00:36:24,696 --> 00:36:27,665
Unfortunately, he's quite insane.

494
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:31,227
- Incontinently.
- He harbors a bizarre hatred for pandas.

495
00:36:31,302 --> 00:36:34,396
Incomprehensibly.
Does he still work for your father?

496
00:36:34,472 --> 00:36:36,940
Oh, no.
We fired him just a few weeks ago.

497
00:36:37,008 --> 00:36:40,274
I believe he's now the chief
of non-telegenic species research...

498
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:42,875
at the Dinosaur Fossils Foundation.

499
00:36:46,384 --> 00:36:47,351
What?

500
00:36:47,852 --> 00:36:51,252
I don't know what it means either.
You'll have to ask him yourself.

501
00:36:51,322 --> 00:36:53,222
Oh, I will.

502
00:36:55,493 --> 00:36:58,894
Bye-bye, then.
Every shot I take, a Picasso.

503
00:37:00,565 --> 00:37:02,556
No touching the camera!

504
00:37:04,636 --> 00:37:07,833
- Where is my rabbit, loser?
- Nice to see you too, Tara.

505
00:37:07,906 --> 00:37:10,374
You were supposed
to find Breezy a week ago.

506
00:37:10,442 --> 00:37:12,580
You owe us for the extra
therapy session.

507
00:37:12,581 --> 00:37:15,881
I can't comment on an
ongoing investigation.

508
00:37:15,947 --> 00:37:20,008
Argh! Holy magenta!
You guys look like a box of crayons.

509
00:37:20,084 --> 00:37:21,381
Uh-oh!

510
00:37:21,453 --> 00:37:23,444
Why do you
always travel in a flock?

511
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:25,084
Ladies, is this really necessary?

512
00:37:25,085 --> 00:37:27,385
Can't we talk this over
like civilized adults?

513
00:37:27,386 --> 00:37:30,086
You can, uh... I-M me
and I'll text you back.

514
00:37:30,562 --> 00:37:33,292
You said I had 72 hours!

515
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,599
- You've had eight days.
- Two kinds of people, people.

516
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,799
People that pee in the pool
and people who lie about it.

517
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,200
Find Mr. Chompers or you going
swimming again tomorrow.

518
00:37:55,019 --> 00:37:58,352
- What?
- Get to class, Ventura.

519
00:38:01,326 --> 00:38:05,456
I gotta break into Dr. Sickinger's office
so you can upload his hard drive.

520
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:08,966
Oh,
I can only do that in my lab.

521
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:13,769
Would you get out of there?
Come on, the coast is clear.

522
00:38:14,772 --> 00:38:19,072
Sounds like a three-man job.
Hey, why are you all we...

523
00:38:19,143 --> 00:38:21,771
with the wet, OK?

524
00:38:22,347 --> 00:38:24,679
About the three-man job.

525
00:38:24,749 --> 00:38:28,981
I know someone. But it's gonna take
all my power of persuasion...

526
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:33,490
to convince this beautiful animal-lover
to commit a level-five felony.

527
00:38:34,058 --> 00:38:37,255
Please help me break into
the Dinosaur Fossil Foundation...

528
00:38:37,328 --> 00:38:39,028
so we can stop the guy
who stole Ting Tang...

529
00:38:39,029 --> 00:38:43,529
and save my mom
before she's sent to prison!

530
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:45,569
Um... OK.

531
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:48,529
- Really?
- Yeah.

532
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:53,900
- Are those from my mom's garden?
- Nah.

533
00:38:53,978 --> 00:38:55,809
Shut up.

534
00:38:57,815 --> 00:39:01,012
Right this way, folks.
Stick together.

535
00:39:06,157 --> 00:39:07,590
OK.

536
00:39:07,659 --> 00:39:10,059
You are all in
for a very special treat -

537
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:14,292
the rarest, most complete
tyrannosaur skeleton in existence.

538
00:39:14,365 --> 00:39:18,461
It has an estimated value
of $100 million.

539
00:39:18,536 --> 00:39:20,470
Uh-huh.

540
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:24,873
Do not touch it.

541
00:39:26,744 --> 00:39:29,372
- $100 million?
- You want your fish back, you're hot?

542
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:31,915
"Or not?"
Don't worry, this plan is gravy.

543
00:39:33,418 --> 00:39:37,445
everybody, stay close.
We're on a tight schedule.

544
00:39:40,825 --> 00:39:45,660
- Oh, a T. Rex. Cool.
- I'm sorry, sir. No pets allowed.

545
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,721
He's my Seeing Eye dog.

546
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:50,097
He's facing backwards.

547
00:39:50,168 --> 00:39:52,830
And you're not blind.

548
00:39:52,904 --> 00:39:55,065
I can see again! I can see!

549
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:57,664
It's a miracle! It's a miracle!

550
00:39:57,742 --> 00:40:01,735
- Sir. I mean it, you...
- Fine. I'll take him off.

551
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,474
I'm so sorry about all this.

552
00:40:11,422 --> 00:40:15,859
- Make him stop doing that!
- He's a dog, it's a bone. Do the math.

553
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:17,588
Wha...

554
00:40:17,662 --> 00:40:21,832
Oh. Oh, jeez. Oxnard Hueneme
Carpinteria Ventura,

555
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:23,033
you get back here right now!

556
00:40:23,101 --> 00:40:26,593
Sir, that is a priceless skeleton
unearthed in the Bad Lands...

557
00:40:26,671 --> 00:40:29,162
Please!
This thing's lasted millions of years.

558
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,676
It's going to survive
a little doggy love nibble.

559
00:40:40,618 --> 00:40:42,552
May be not.

560
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,248
Oh!

561
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:52,825
OK. OK. I told you it would work. Now go.
I'll meet you in the dinosaur cavern. Go.

562
00:41:00,738 --> 00:41:02,205
Security!

563
00:41:10,882 --> 00:41:12,410
Have you seen a little kid
run past here?

564
00:41:12,411 --> 00:41:15,011
- Hurry up, let's go!
- Come on, let's go.

565
00:41:52,623 --> 00:41:53,628
A~Plus, are you there?

566
00:41:53,629 --> 00:41:58,529
Affirmative. Oh, this is so cool.
Now I have two friends.

567
00:41:58,596 --> 00:42:00,826
Let's start a band.
Do you play an instrument?

568
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:04,800
I used to play the bagpipes,
but my legs are too skinny for a kilt.

569
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:08,703
Come on! I'm in the office and it's really
freaky in here. Tell me what to do.

570
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:18,880
Ohhh! Argh!

571
00:42:20,218 --> 00:42:23,381
Don't let him get away!
He went this way!

572
00:42:23,454 --> 00:42:26,423
That's him!

573
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:30,624
Aaargh! Oh!

574
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:38,492
OK. Your program's running.

575
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:41,766
- Oh, one other thing.
- What?

576
00:42:42,507 --> 00:42:48,173
In my instant messenger, can I move you
from "Contacts" to "Buddies"?

577
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:50,237
- No.
- Can I put you on my fave five?

578
00:42:50,314 --> 00:42:51,679
- No.
- My Space add?

579
00:42:51,749 --> 00:42:53,239
Denied.

580
00:42:53,317 --> 00:42:55,751
But we're friends now, right?

581
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,084
Sure, A~Plus. We're friends.

582
00:42:58,156 --> 00:43:00,750
And you're a girl, right?

583
00:43:00,825 --> 00:43:02,554
Duh.

584
00:43:02,627 --> 00:43:06,222
So I can call you my girlfriend, right?

585
00:43:06,764 --> 00:43:08,732
Ewww! Not!

586
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,859
Fine, be that way.

587
00:43:10,935 --> 00:43:12,131
There he goes!
There he goes!

588
00:43:12,432 --> 00:43:13,632
Get outta my way!
Get outta my way!

589
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,233
No, I'm going first!

590
00:43:18,743 --> 00:43:20,005
You...

591
00:43:27,151 --> 00:43:29,415
OK, it's finished.

592
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:38,418
He's over there!

593
00:43:44,202 --> 00:43:45,669
Beep beep!

594
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,771
- Copy that.
- Come here, kid!

595
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:04,979
Come here!

596
00:44:09,427 --> 00:44:11,418
Owwwww!

597
00:44:15,933 --> 00:44:17,093
Argh!

598
00:44:17,168 --> 00:44:20,069
Jeez! With the sneaking up on me, OK?

599
00:44:20,137 --> 00:44:24,506
- Mission accomplished. Where's Ox?
- Well, I don't know. He's a lone wolf.

600
00:44:24,575 --> 00:44:26,634
- You're putting that bone back.
- Fine.

601
00:44:26,711 --> 00:44:32,707
All right, he's in the tunnel!
Give me a flashlight. Let's go! This way!

602
00:44:44,262 --> 00:44:45,422
Whoa!

603
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,368
Stay where you are!

604
00:44:51,435 --> 00:44:53,096
Fan out.

605
00:44:53,638 --> 00:44:55,902
Do you Heely?

606
00:45:01,078 --> 00:45:03,444
- Shall we?
- Let's do.

607
00:45:05,716 --> 00:45:08,082
Fun time's over.

608
00:45:26,304 --> 00:45:28,295
Go!

609
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:32,436
Hey, that's my girl!

610
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,410
Got you!

611
00:45:38,783 --> 00:45:40,580
Got you!

612
00:45:43,821 --> 00:45:45,982
Vámonos!

613
00:45:47,758 --> 00:45:49,252
You're not gonna let him
keep that, are you?

614
00:45:49,853 --> 00:45:52,753
I'll put it back later.
Hey, good job, Ox.

615
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:55,025
Where are the kids?

616
00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:57,659
Where did they go?
Which way?

617
00:45:58,703 --> 00:46:00,864
Bunch of idiots!
Oh, man.

618
00:46:02,273 --> 00:46:06,369
Herfinancial situation is dire
and, as the bears' keeper,

619
00:46:06,444 --> 00:46:09,709
she has ready access
to the panda house at any time.

620
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,408
The agency's skilled forensics team
has concluded...

621
00:46:12,483 --> 00:46:16,749
that the only fresh footprints at the
crime scene belong to Mrs. Ventura.

622
00:46:16,821 --> 00:46:19,153
I object!

623
00:46:27,164 --> 00:46:30,622
Excuse me.
Who are you?

624
00:46:30,701 --> 00:46:33,761
Ace Ventura Darrow Hutz Junior, Esquire,

625
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:36,773

00:46:41,912 --> 00:46:45,177
Imontha, Take & Lovitt,
Ben, Dover & Grunt,

629
00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:48,741
and the non-profit Mater Innocentus.

630
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:53,779
My mom is innocent.
Your Honor, I represent the defendant.

631
00:46:54,592 --> 00:46:56,753
Your Honor, this is ridiculous.

632
00:46:56,827 --> 00:47:00,126
He's a 12-year-old behavioral case
and the defendant's son.

633
00:47:00,197 --> 00:47:03,291
This is a bail hearing.
Character is pertinent.

634
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:05,301
Continue, young man.

635
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:11,103
Ow, that must have hurt, and it's only
gonna get worse. Pay attention.

636
00:47:18,182 --> 00:47:21,982
- Thank you, paralegal Laura.
- You're very welcome.

637
00:47:32,263 --> 00:47:36,825
- Come on, Your Honor!
- Pardon me, Your Honor. My bad.

638
00:47:46,777 --> 00:47:50,543
- Thank you, pretty paralegal Laura.
- You're very welcome, Mr. Esquire.

639
00:47:50,614 --> 00:47:52,605
Come on, boys.

640
00:48:01,325 --> 00:48:04,351
Drop it.
OK, I'm good, I'm good.

641
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:09,726
The only footprints the Agent
Hollander and his personal CSI,

642
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,227
"Complete Stupid Idiots"...

643
00:48:11,302 --> 00:48:13,361
found at the scene were...

644
00:48:13,437 --> 00:48:17,634
OK, ok, a little help. It's getting
really heavy, bailiffs. Please!

645
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:22,105
And let me remind you,
you're under oath!

646
00:48:22,179 --> 00:48:23,814
- Actualy I'm not.
- I want the truth!

647
00:48:23,815 --> 00:48:25,115
You can't handle the truth!

648
00:48:25,182 --> 00:48:28,485
Be seated, you maggot,
immediately, if not sooner!

649
00:48:30,588 --> 00:48:35,184
Anyway, the only footprints that
Ranger Blockhead found in the habitat,

650
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:39,252
besides my mom's shoeprints,
were panda prints.

651
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:43,926
The average panda weighs 352 pounds,
with a body mass index of 21.34.

652
00:48:44,001 --> 00:48:48,097
At over five feet in length, the panda
has slightly offset weight distribution.

653
00:48:48,172 --> 00:48:50,697
They use a thumb-like
sesamoid bone for stability,

654
00:48:50,774 --> 00:48:53,368
and would create
a 5mm-deep footprint.

655
00:48:53,444 --> 00:48:56,971
But, as you can see,
these are 2.3mm-deep footprints,

656
00:48:57,047 --> 00:49:00,642
that I just created
by adding 75 pounds to my weight.

657
00:49:00,718 --> 00:49:06,657
A man weighing 183 pounds would
indeed establish a print depth of 2.3mm.

658
00:49:06,724 --> 00:49:10,956
We are looking for a 183 pound man,
not a... Mom, how much do you weigh?

659
00:49:11,028 --> 00:49:13,496
- 110.
- You wanna be free or not?

660
00:49:13,564 --> 00:49:17,056
- 135.
- 135 pound woman.

661
00:49:17,134 --> 00:49:20,501
If the footprints don't fit,
you must acquit.

662
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,208
- Order! Order!
- Thank you, thank you!

663
00:49:25,276 --> 00:49:28,074
That's Ventura with a V,
as in victory.

664
00:49:28,145 --> 00:49:30,477
I plead for acquittal, Your Honor.

665
00:49:30,548 --> 00:49:35,349
Game, set, match.
Cut, print, moving on, and scene.

666
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:41,682
Let me get this straight.
You trespassed on a federal crime scene.

667
00:49:41,759 --> 00:49:44,227
Or you're just making all this up.

668
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:50,793
Um... Well...

669
00:49:50,868 --> 00:49:55,168
It's a hypothesis.
A theory, if you will.

670
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,272
That's terrific, tiger.
But, listen, right now,

671
00:49:59,273 --> 00:50:01,773
the grown-ups have to send
your mommy to jail...

672
00:50:01,845 --> 00:50:05,405
unless, uh... someone else wants to
put on a Halloween costume..

673
00:50:05,406 --> 00:50:06,806
and vandalize the courtroom?

674
00:50:10,621 --> 00:50:13,313
Order!
I'm sorry, young man.

675
00:50:13,391 --> 00:50:14,452
It's an interesting theory,

676
00:50:14,453 --> 00:50:17,753
but this case involves
an endangered species,

677
00:50:17,754 --> 00:50:19,654
international relations.

678
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:22,995
Bail is set
at 500,000 dollars.

679
00:50:23,067 --> 00:50:29,063
Melissa Ventura, you're remanded
to the custody of the state of Florida.

680
00:50:30,074 --> 00:50:33,441
Ace, where did you get
all that information?

681
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:36,104
- You promised you wouldn't...
- But Grandpa said...

682
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:40,344
- He carries around a dead dog, Ace.
- It's not dead, it's just sleeping.

683
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:44,012
I thought I could help you solve the case
by finding Ting Tang or something,

684
00:50:44,088 --> 00:50:46,283
but no one believes me,
not even you.

685
00:50:46,357 --> 00:50:49,724
Of course I do.
I just don't want to lose you.

686
00:50:49,793 --> 00:50:53,957
- Like you lost Dad?
- Yeah, like I lost Dad.

687
00:50:55,332 --> 00:50:59,666
I realize now that no matterwhat I say,
you're gonna be who you are.

688
00:50:59,737 --> 00:51:02,570
I want you to know the truth
about your dad.

689
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:07,441
I just didn't talk about him
or what he did because I...

690
00:51:07,511 --> 00:51:10,071
I didn't want you
to follow in his footsteps.

691
00:51:10,147 --> 00:51:12,138
What happened to him?

692
00:51:14,351 --> 00:51:16,342
He was on a case.

693
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:21,255
Using an ultralight plane, he was leading
a flock of disabled Canadian snow geese...

694
00:51:21,325 --> 00:51:25,386
back to their winter
breeding ground in Miami.

695
00:51:25,462 --> 00:51:28,295
They said that he got disoriented,

696
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:33,736
and he vanished from radar
somewhere over the Bermuda Triangle.

697
00:51:33,804 --> 00:51:35,465
Oh, Ace.

698
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:40,539
Time is up.
Gotta get you on the bus.

699
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:42,875
I've been saving something for you.

700
00:51:45,316 --> 00:51:47,307
Yourfather bought this.

701
00:51:47,384 --> 00:51:52,981
He wanted you to have it
when you were old enough, and now you are.

702
00:51:53,057 --> 00:51:55,651
Look up in the attic.
You'll find it there.

703
00:51:55,726 --> 00:51:58,957
- No, Mom, I promise, I'll be normal.
- Be who you are, Ace!

704
00:51:59,029 --> 00:52:02,226
Hollander will find the pandanapper
and we'll be a family again.

705
00:52:02,299 --> 00:52:05,496
- I love you, Ace!
- I love you, Mom.

706
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:18,170
Ace, I'm so sorry.

707
00:52:18,248 --> 00:52:20,842
So what do we do now?

708
00:52:20,918 --> 00:52:23,910
Nothing. I'm a loser.
It's over.

709
00:52:24,688 --> 00:52:27,282
Sorry about your koi fish.

710
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:29,758
Come on, Ox.

711
00:52:29,827 --> 00:52:32,887
Hey, Laura,
where the heck is Bermuda?

712
00:52:32,963 --> 00:52:34,954
I have no idea.

713
00:52:50,781 --> 00:52:53,682
That's not what I think it is, is it?

714
00:52:53,751 --> 00:52:55,651
I guess.

715
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:57,880
Your mom gave that to you?

716
00:52:58,756 --> 00:53:01,247
Yeah, but it's not important.

717
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,851
What about the animals?

718
00:53:04,928 --> 00:53:07,761
Animals have never brought me
any thing but trouble.

719
00:53:07,831 --> 00:53:10,197
I gotta be like every one else, Grandpa.

720
00:53:10,267 --> 00:53:14,328
- You can't.
- Well, I will if it kills me.

721
00:53:14,405 --> 00:53:18,569
You'll never be like every one else,
'cause you're one in a million.

722
00:53:18,642 --> 00:53:21,110
Just like your ancestors.

723
00:53:21,178 --> 00:53:23,169
Just like your father.

724
00:53:23,847 --> 00:53:26,179
Eat your own food, Ox.

725
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:29,686
I've been trying to get you
to figure this out,

726
00:53:29,753 --> 00:53:33,553
but I guess I'm just
gonna have to come out and say it.

727
00:53:33,624 --> 00:53:36,616
- Say what?
- The magic word.

728
00:53:40,697 --> 00:53:42,961
Don't you know what you are?

729
00:53:44,635 --> 00:53:47,126
I'm a kid, right?

730
00:53:47,204 --> 00:53:50,503
You're more than that.

731
00:53:50,574 --> 00:53:53,134
You're a pet...

732
00:53:55,646 --> 00:53:57,307
detective.

733
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,920
- Like my dad?
- Yeah.

734
00:54:06,523 --> 00:54:09,720
- What was he like?
- Just like you.

735
00:54:12,996 --> 00:54:15,760
And you know,

736
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:18,495
this thing you threw away,

737
00:54:19,736 --> 00:54:23,228
this is the key
to your future.

738
00:55:18,662 --> 00:55:20,789
Alrighty, then.

739
00:55:57,834 --> 00:56:01,235
- Nice outfiit.
- Let's talk fashion.

740
00:56:01,305 --> 00:56:04,069
Tara's wearing the latest in the
"Spoiled and Shallow" collection.

741
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,970
Love the shoes.
Hate you!

742
00:56:06,043 --> 00:56:08,378
Ventura, our therapist said
for us to order you...

743
00:56:08,379 --> 00:56:10,779
to stop inflicting
emotional damage on us.

744
00:56:10,848 --> 00:56:11,884
Franken Berry called.

745
00:56:11,885 --> 00:56:14,885
Count Chocula wants his
wardrobe back. And the sun's out.

746
00:56:14,952 --> 00:56:18,683
Get back in your caskets.
Is there a veterinarian in the house?

747
00:56:18,755 --> 00:56:21,656
Because these are some sick puppies.

748
00:56:21,725 --> 00:56:26,719
Hey, watch the hair!
Oxnard, I need you!

749
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:43,779
Time for another
motivational dunking, dork!

750
00:56:43,847 --> 00:56:46,941
No, but you don't underst...

751
00:56:49,252 --> 00:56:53,052
Jeez, next time you're late like that,
I'm buying a cat.

752
00:56:57,761 --> 00:57:00,355
Tell your dog to back off, Ventura!

753
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:03,957
Are you crazy?
I'm not going near him! He looks rabid.

754
00:57:04,034 --> 00:57:06,628
And he can smell your fear.

755
00:57:08,138 --> 00:57:11,665
You are Spartan!

756
00:57:23,453 --> 00:57:27,947
- What about our alligator?
- I told you I'd find him, and I will.

757
00:57:28,025 --> 00:57:32,189
But right now,
I've got bigger fish to fry.

758
00:57:32,262 --> 00:57:35,891
Oxnard!
Allons-y, muchacho!

759
00:57:35,966 --> 00:57:39,697
Oh, and sorry about that
whole buying a cat thing.

760
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:41,761
Ace?

761
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:44,402
Ventura...

762
00:57:44,474 --> 00:57:46,669
Junior.

763
00:57:46,743 --> 00:57:48,734
Pet Detective.

764
00:57:48,812 --> 00:57:51,212
Um... OK.

765
00:57:51,948 --> 00:57:52,975
What's wrong?

766
00:57:53,576 --> 00:57:55,976
The question, young Laura is,
what is right?

767
00:57:56,053 --> 00:57:59,113
The answer...
everything.

768
00:57:59,189 --> 00:58:03,649
- So you feel like solving that case?
- I thought you gave up.

769
00:58:03,727 --> 00:58:06,423
Even Tiger Woods shanks one
from time to time.

770
00:58:06,496 --> 00:58:08,623
But the past is past.

771
00:58:08,699 --> 00:58:12,795
- Now, A~Plus.
- Wow! This table is great.

772
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:17,028
I looked through Sickinger's hard drive.
He's a biological researcher...

773
00:58:17,107 --> 00:58:22,101
specializing in non-telegenic
endangered organisms.

774
00:58:22,179 --> 00:58:26,115
- In English, Mr. Spock.
- He advocates for ugly animals.

775
00:58:26,183 --> 00:58:27,584
He planned a demonstration...

776
00:58:27,585 --> 00:58:32,885
for like-minded activists at a
publicity stop for a famous feline.

777
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:38,225
OK, I didn't understand
a word you just said,

778
00:58:38,295 --> 00:58:40,525
exceptfor "ugly animals"
and "Sickinger".

779
00:58:40,597 --> 00:58:43,896
He's organizing a protest at Tabby's
the Tabby autograph session...

780
00:58:43,967 --> 00:58:48,063
at the Animal Actors Studio
at Universal, Orlando.

781
00:58:48,138 --> 00:58:50,402
Itlooks like we're going
on a field trip.

782
00:58:50,474 --> 00:58:52,032
L'chaim!

783
00:58:54,044 --> 00:58:57,411
I'll take a few of these for the road.
2% next time.

784
00:58:57,481 --> 00:58:59,314
Field trip? Wait, do I need
a permission slip?

785
00:58:59,315 --> 00:59:00,815
No, you don't!

786
00:59:00,884 --> 00:59:05,082
Have a meow-tastic day.
Thanks for coming.

787
00:59:05,155 --> 00:59:07,885
Tabby says,
"Have a meow-tastic day".

788
00:59:09,259 --> 00:59:13,093
Thanks for coming.
Tabby says, "Have a meow-tastic day!"

789
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:16,822
Thanks for coming.
Tabby says, "Have a meow-tastic day!"

790
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:20,764
Thanks for coming.
Tabby says, "Have a meow-tastic day!"

791
00:59:20,837 --> 00:59:23,067
There's Sickinger!

792
00:59:27,778 --> 00:59:31,976
No justice, no peace!
Equal treatment for ugly species!

793
00:59:32,215 --> 00:59:35,946
No justice, no peace!
Equal treatment for ugly species!

794
00:59:36,019 --> 00:59:38,078
Take him down!
He's an ecoterrorist!

795
00:59:38,155 --> 00:59:42,216
Cease and desist immediately,
or I'll be forced to use this!

796
00:59:42,292 --> 00:59:45,056
Don't even think about moving!
Slow down! Just stop!

797
00:59:47,297 --> 00:59:49,527
- Don't Tase me, bro!
- Get him!

798
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,091
No justice, no peace!
No justice, no...

799
00:59:58,809 --> 01:00:02,245
- We shall not be silenced!
- Be quiet!

800
01:00:02,312 --> 01:00:05,247
Ugly animals of the world, unite!

801
01:00:05,315 --> 01:00:08,682
- You have nothing to lose...
- This guy is crazy.

802
01:00:08,752 --> 01:00:10,947
...but your leashes!

803
01:00:11,021 --> 01:00:13,353
We shall not be silenced!

804
01:00:13,423 --> 01:00:15,254
Ow!

805
01:00:15,325 --> 01:00:17,793
Tabby is gone!

806
01:00:17,861 --> 01:00:20,022
Find Tabby! Tabby's gone!

807
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:22,723
Yikes! Tabby's been nabbied.

808
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,233
- Tabby!
- This is bigger than I thought.

809
01:00:25,302 --> 01:00:29,033
Sickinger must be running some
sort of criminal animal-napping network.

810
01:00:29,105 --> 01:00:31,903
Oh, the humanity! Tabby!

811
01:00:31,975 --> 01:00:36,275
I know you don't want to, Ace,
but you better talk to Hollander.

812
01:00:36,346 --> 01:00:38,871
Now he'll listen to you.

813
01:00:38,949 --> 01:00:41,884
- You're not listening!
- I'm sorry, what?

814
01:00:41,952 --> 01:00:43,618
Dr. Sickinger, we saw...

815
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:46,219
he was creating a distraction
at the Animal Actors stadium...

816
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:47,620
when Tabby the Tabby vanished!

817
01:00:47,691 --> 01:00:50,785
This is a major criminal network.
We have evidence.

818
01:00:50,861 --> 01:00:52,920
- Tabby the Tabby.
- Catnapped.

819
01:00:52,996 --> 01:00:55,260
- Ting Tang.
- You know what happened to him.

820
01:00:55,332 --> 01:00:57,732
- Princess.
- Championship West Highland terrier.

821
01:00:57,801 --> 01:01:01,760
Her Majesty was stolen from a meaningless
international dog show last week!

822
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:02,771
Freedom the Hawk.

823
01:01:02,772 --> 01:01:05,172
Mascot for Stars and Stripes
Burger Company.

824
01:01:05,242 --> 01:01:08,803
His freedom was taken when he was stolen
from the Jacksonville veterinarian!

825
01:01:08,879 --> 01:01:11,643
They even took Snuggles,
the fabric softening bear.

826
01:01:11,715 --> 01:01:13,842
- They took Snuggles?
- Yes!

827
01:01:13,917 --> 01:01:15,509
And?

828
01:01:15,585 --> 01:01:20,147
Sickinger's organization
is stealing famous animals!

829
01:01:20,223 --> 01:01:23,454
Jeez! You're welcome for solving
the case, doing your job!

830
01:01:23,526 --> 01:01:26,586
Need me to wipe your butt for you?
I just did!

831
01:01:27,364 --> 01:01:30,094
So when can I get my mom back?

832
01:01:30,834 --> 01:01:33,029
Ten, 20 years, I'd say.

833
01:01:33,103 --> 01:01:34,695
What?!

834
01:01:34,771 --> 01:01:39,868
You see, doorstop, a major investigation
like this takes on a life all of its own.

835
01:01:39,943 --> 01:01:44,642
I think your mom's guilty, and I spent
all morning on CNN saying she is.

836
01:01:44,714 --> 01:01:47,979
Her case is putting this agency
on the map. Look at what they gave us.

837
01:01:48,051 --> 01:01:51,214
And that's just the beginning.
Get this.

838
01:01:51,288 --> 01:01:54,553
CSI: Fish and Wildlife.

839
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:57,519
Guess who's gonna play me?

840
01:01:57,594 --> 01:01:59,255
Gumby.

841
01:01:59,329 --> 01:02:03,356
I didn't want it to have to come
to this, Russell, but now it's on.

842
01:02:04,434 --> 01:02:06,425
Ha!

843
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:08,264
Ha!

844
01:02:08,338 --> 01:02:10,806
- Out.
- With the pushing!

845
01:02:10,874 --> 01:02:14,275
I am gonna get Sickinger,
solve this case, prove my mom's innocent,

846
01:02:14,344 --> 01:02:17,177
and show the world
what an idiot you are!

847
01:02:17,247 --> 01:02:19,613
Nice hair.

848
01:02:25,555 --> 01:02:31,050
This used to be the most pristine
Tyrannosaurus skeleton on Earth,

849
01:02:31,127 --> 01:02:34,995
formerly valued at $100 million.

850
01:02:35,065 --> 01:02:37,431
How much is it worth now?

851
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,991
Substantially less.

852
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:43,699
Please do not touch it.

853
01:02:44,708 --> 01:02:48,303
Let's move very carefully
to the gift shop.

854
01:02:54,517 --> 01:02:57,577
I don't think it looks that bad.
Here, you put it back.

855
01:02:57,654 --> 01:02:59,645
You put it back.

856
01:03:29,919 --> 01:03:33,650
- Yes?
- Dr. Sickinger, I presume?

857
01:03:34,624 --> 01:03:36,785
Wait!

858
01:03:37,927 --> 01:03:39,952
Who are you?

859
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:43,693
Ace Ventura Jr.
Pet Detective.

860
01:03:44,634 --> 01:03:48,468
- You're kidding me, right?
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

861
01:03:51,674 --> 01:03:56,270
I get it!
Young supporters of the cause, yes!

862
01:03:56,346 --> 01:04:01,010
Oh, it's brilliant! Yes, yes. You're never
too young for political mobilization.

863
01:04:01,084 --> 01:04:03,348
We don't want to join your movement.

864
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:07,015
Look, buddy, my mom's in jail
because of you,

865
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:10,992
so tell us where the panda is
so we can get him back to the zoo.

866
01:04:11,995 --> 01:04:15,089
If I were going to steal
an animal from the zoo,

867
01:04:16,066 --> 01:04:18,660
the panda is the last one I'd take.

868
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:22,804
I don't think you understand.

869
01:04:24,974 --> 01:04:28,569
- This is the Madagascan Aye-aye.
- Ugh!

870
01:04:29,612 --> 01:04:33,571
- The Proboscis Monkey.
- Big nose.

871
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:35,242
Ugh!

872
01:04:35,318 --> 01:04:37,843
The Chinese paddlefish.

873
01:04:41,091 --> 01:04:43,753
The Marabou Stork.

874
01:04:45,495 --> 01:04:48,896
All of them endangered,
yet no one's ever heard of them.

875
01:04:48,965 --> 01:04:51,798
- You know why?
- No.

876
01:04:53,403 --> 01:04:55,894
They're hideous.

877
01:04:55,972 --> 01:04:58,236
Ugly.

878
01:04:58,308 --> 01:05:01,072
- Butt-ugly, actually.
- You got it there.

879
01:05:01,144 --> 01:05:02,702
Whoops!

880
01:05:02,779 --> 01:05:05,247
Sorry, that one's from vacation.

881
01:05:05,315 --> 01:05:07,579
Ace, shoot me now.

882
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:09,641
Lights, lights.

883
01:05:11,788 --> 01:05:15,280
And this has what to do with the panda?

884
01:05:16,126 --> 01:05:18,117
Well, everything!

885
01:05:18,194 --> 01:05:21,789
We put all of these cute creatures
in zoos,

886
01:05:21,865 --> 01:05:27,030
and then we spend insane amounts of money
to protect them.

887
01:05:27,103 --> 01:05:29,435
And forwhat?

888
01:05:30,874 --> 01:05:37,677
I started the Panda fanatic website
to get attention for my cause.

889
01:05:38,248 --> 01:05:40,239
That's all.

890
01:05:41,518 --> 01:05:44,817
I didn't kidnap Ting Tang,

891
01:05:44,888 --> 01:05:47,880
or any of those other animals.

892
01:05:47,957 --> 01:05:51,017
All species of animals,
including the ugly ones,

893
01:05:51,094 --> 01:05:56,361
should be treated with the same
respect as the cute ones, like pandas.

894
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,533
I think I just busted this case wide open.

895
01:06:02,372 --> 01:06:05,273
Amigos, vámonos!

896
01:06:08,845 --> 01:06:10,437
I have a car.

897
01:06:12,015 --> 01:06:14,347
Ace! So what's going on?

898
01:06:14,417 --> 01:06:16,977
Well, here's the plot up until now.

899
01:06:17,053 --> 01:06:19,920
Our perpetrator
is stealing famous animals.

900
01:06:19,989 --> 01:06:22,321
And there's none more famous
than Calypso.

901
01:06:22,392 --> 01:06:26,089
He played the hero unicorn in the epic
trilogy that they shot in New Zealand.

902
01:06:26,162 --> 01:06:28,926
His owners are doing
a benefit magic performance today,

903
01:06:28,998 --> 01:06:32,126
and I got a feeling our thief
is gonna try and steal him there.

904
01:06:32,202 --> 01:06:34,193
Punch it.

905
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,432
Here's the plan.
Doc, you watch the exits.

906
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:42,501
Ox.

907
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:46,578
You watch Doc.
Let's go.

908
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:48,940
Hi.

909
01:06:49,018 --> 01:06:53,955
OK, when we get past this,
A- Plus, Laura, split up.

910
01:06:54,023 --> 01:06:56,014
Whoever finds Calypso, call in.

911
01:06:56,092 --> 01:07:00,153
We'll stake out the perpetrators
and wait for them to reveal themselves.

912
01:07:05,501 --> 01:07:07,492
I've been looking around here all day.

913
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:10,937
- I can't find Calypso.
- He's right over there.

914
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:13,237
For my next illusion...

915
01:07:13,309 --> 01:07:15,470
- Magic show.
- I need a volunteer.

916
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,016
- A volunteer? Anyone?
- Me! Here!

917
01:07:19,017 --> 01:07:21,817
- Who wants to be in the show?
- Pick me! Me!

918
01:07:22,785 --> 01:07:24,646
You!
How about you?

919
01:07:24,721 --> 01:07:27,119
No, no, no, please!
I wanna be magic man.

920
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,120
- Anyone else?
- No, me! Me, me, me, me.

921
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:31,326
Sure, son.
Okay, go inspect the box.

922
01:07:31,394 --> 01:07:35,353
You'll see that there are no mirrors.
There are no strings.

923
01:07:35,431 --> 01:07:37,422
There are no trap doors.

924
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,230
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

925
01:07:40,303 --> 01:07:43,602
Ace Irwin Ventura Jr.
At your service.

926
01:07:43,673 --> 01:07:48,406
- Don't worry, you'll be OK.
- This is what I do.

927
01:07:48,478 --> 01:07:51,174
- Are there any back doors?
- There are no back doors.

928
01:07:51,247 --> 01:07:54,182
- Are there any mirrors?
- No mirrors!

929
01:07:54,951 --> 01:07:57,385
- All right, go on.
- Stranger danger.

930
01:07:57,453 --> 01:07:59,683
Give him a big hand.

931
01:07:59,756 --> 01:08:04,193
Raise the box. You won't believe
what you're about to see.

932
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:06,421
Every one, remain calm.

933
01:08:07,563 --> 01:08:10,293
One, two, three!

934
01:08:21,911 --> 01:08:24,709
And now...
Close the box.

935
01:08:24,781 --> 01:08:26,241
Raise the box, gentlemen,
raise the box.

936
01:08:26,242 --> 01:08:29,242
I'm a professional,
so nobody try this at home.

937
01:08:29,319 --> 01:08:32,618
And now... Calypso!

938
01:08:40,596 --> 01:08:42,826
What the...?!

939
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:47,667
- What happened?
- Where's my horse?

940
01:08:47,737 --> 01:08:50,535
Where's Calypso?
That horse gets six million a picture.

941
01:08:50,606 --> 01:08:52,801
- Where's Calypso?
- Houdini, I want him back.

942
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:56,140
That kid right there. The volunteer.
He must know something.

943
01:08:56,212 --> 01:08:59,511
What, me? No. Where would I be
keeping a horse that big? In my pocket?

944
01:08:59,582 --> 01:09:03,109
- Where's Calypso?
- Why don't you check your mother's house?

945
01:09:03,186 --> 01:09:05,484
- He's just joking.
- Come on!

946
01:09:05,555 --> 01:09:07,750
- Just get him!
- Hey, kid!

947
01:09:09,058 --> 01:09:11,083
- Stop!
- Slow down, Simba!

948
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:14,357
- Calypso's really gone?
- My plan worked!

949
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:17,163
- What plan?
- I fed him one of your homing devices.

950
01:09:17,233 --> 01:09:18,769
Strawberry gummy,
he loved it.

951
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:21,770
Now he's gonna lead us to
whoever's behind all this treachery.

952
01:09:22,739 --> 01:09:25,572
- Get him!
- Stop!

953
01:09:25,641 --> 01:09:28,701
Sickinger, start the car!
I think they have rabies!

954
01:09:30,046 --> 01:09:33,038
Here. Dog.
Car, car!

955
01:09:34,817 --> 01:09:35,845
Seatbelts!

956
01:09:35,846 --> 01:09:39,246
Seatbelts?
What're you kidding me? Let's go!

957
01:09:40,123 --> 01:09:42,523
Where's my horse?!

958
01:09:45,128 --> 01:09:47,460
They're getting off the highway
at Palm Grove.

959
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:52,194
That's where all the rich kids from
our school live, but where exactly?

960
01:09:52,268 --> 01:09:55,704
- My invitation!
- My invitation.

961
01:09:57,473 --> 01:10:00,738
You're invited to my birthday partyy
this Saturday,

962
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:03,745
at 3421 Tropicana Avenue.

963
01:10:05,281 --> 01:10:08,614
OK, party people.
Suit up!

964
01:10:09,352 --> 01:10:11,411
Party?
I haven't partied since '99.

965
01:10:11,487 --> 01:10:13,387
Ox, vámonos!

966
01:10:18,094 --> 01:10:23,589
No, up there. No, wait!
Wait, stop, stop! Stop right here!

967
01:10:23,666 --> 01:10:28,000
- No, stop here! Stop!
- I'm stopping, backseat driver!

968
01:10:35,511 --> 01:10:37,877
All right, Laura and I
are going inside.

969
01:10:37,947 --> 01:10:42,077
If we're not back by three o'clock,
implement...

970
01:10:44,654 --> 01:10:46,485
plan B.

971
01:10:46,556 --> 01:10:48,624
Synchronize watches.

972
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:49,584
Let's go.

973
01:10:52,261 --> 01:10:54,822
A red carpet? What is this,
an awards show?

974
01:10:54,823 --> 01:10:56,423
Where's Joan Rivers
when you need her?

975
01:10:56,499 --> 01:10:59,058
Hey, you, make sure
no weirdos get in here.

976
01:10:59,059 --> 01:11:00,459
Talk about filthy stinking rich.

977
01:11:00,536 --> 01:11:02,902
Do you know where the back of the line is?

978
01:11:02,972 --> 01:11:05,941
How's the wife and kids?
What's the word I'm looking for?

979
01:11:06,008 --> 01:11:09,637
- It's very regal.
- Exactly. Egomaniacal.

980
01:11:09,712 --> 01:11:11,577
- Thank you.
- Holy Shaq!

981
01:11:11,647 --> 01:11:15,105
How many puberties
have you gone through?!

982
01:11:15,184 --> 01:11:17,243
- All right.
- Thank you.

983
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,811
Wear the wristband at all times.

984
01:11:20,723 --> 01:11:23,453
Whoa. Invite only, kid.

985
01:11:23,526 --> 01:11:26,984
- He's my date.
- What, did you lose a bet?

986
01:11:27,063 --> 01:11:29,554
Ha ha! You're killing me, Smalls.

987
01:11:29,632 --> 01:11:33,830
How about you pick on somebody
your own size? Like Sasquatch.

988
01:11:33,903 --> 01:11:36,565
Now band me.

989
01:11:36,639 --> 01:11:39,665
- Gray areas are offlimits.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

990
01:11:42,678 --> 01:11:45,476
- Electronic device.
- Here.

991
01:11:45,548 --> 01:11:46,782
Don't touch the hair!

992
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:49,783
I haven't been treated this badly
since I got sick in a country...

993
01:11:49,784 --> 01:11:51,284
with socialized medicine.

994
01:12:02,231 --> 01:12:07,635
- 10,000 shares of Exxon stock! Awesome!
- I got a Rolex.

995
01:12:09,505 --> 01:12:12,872
- Didn't you bring him a gift?
- I got him the one thing he doesn't have.

996
01:12:12,942 --> 01:12:15,001
- What?
- Nothing.

997
01:12:15,578 --> 01:12:17,637
Holy real estate!

998
01:12:22,018 --> 01:12:24,077
This place probably has its own zip code.

999
01:12:24,153 --> 01:12:26,587
I bet you we need an exit visa
to get out of here.

1000
01:12:26,656 --> 01:12:29,454
Best party ever!
Bananas!

1001
01:12:31,661 --> 01:12:34,323
Get out of the way.
Make room for Mr. Pennington.

1002
01:12:34,397 --> 01:12:36,888
Ooh, it's Mr. Big Scary Billionaire Man.

1003
01:12:39,335 --> 01:12:43,294
"Pirates of the Caribbean"
is the other side of town, sport.

1004
01:12:43,372 --> 01:12:44,468
Don't touch me.

1005
01:12:44,469 --> 01:12:47,469
Stay back, people. Thank you.
Out of the way, please.

1006
01:12:47,543 --> 01:12:49,534
He's mean.

1007
01:12:50,246 --> 01:12:53,215
Young ladies and gentlemen,

1008
01:12:53,282 --> 01:12:56,445
may I direct your attention to the sky!

1009
01:13:03,626 --> 01:13:07,926
The Pennington Estate now proudly presents
the moment we've all been waiting for.

1010
01:13:07,997 --> 01:13:11,626
Put your hands together
and welcome my son,

1011
01:13:11,701 --> 01:13:14,397
Pennington, Jr.!

1012
01:13:21,644 --> 01:13:23,874
- Wow!
- Big deal.

1013
01:13:24,747 --> 01:13:30,845
Hi, how are you?
Great to see you. Thanks for coming.

1014
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:34,014
- How are we gonna get inside?
- Oh, I know.

1015
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:37,526
Let's crash into the door
in our million-dollar personal helicopter.

1016
01:13:37,593 --> 01:13:40,357
- Ace.
- I'm working on it.

1017
01:13:40,997 --> 01:13:43,625
Hey, Laura,
glad you could make it.

1018
01:13:43,699 --> 01:13:46,224
Hi, how are you?

1019
01:13:47,169 --> 01:13:52,038
Well, I asked my father for the best
party ever, and, as you can see,

1020
01:13:52,108 --> 01:13:56,204
what a Pennington wants,
a Pennington gets.

1021
01:13:56,278 --> 01:13:59,907
- So please do not embarrass yourselves...
- I got it. Let's go.

1022
01:13:59,982 --> 01:14:04,419
...by breaking any of the following rules.
Dad?

1023
01:14:05,321 --> 01:14:09,553
Gifts in the party bags
are not tax deductible.

1024
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:12,753
Do not take any photos.

1025
01:14:13,262 --> 01:14:15,856
Any one found to be outside
of the designated areas

1026
01:14:15,931 --> 01:14:19,833
will be prosecuted
to the fullest extent of the law.

1027
01:14:20,603 --> 01:14:23,834
Have fun, kids!

1028
01:14:24,373 --> 01:14:29,970
We'll cut the cake in 45 minutes.
Until then, happy birthday to me!

1029
01:14:37,386 --> 01:14:40,355
- Ace!
- I'm thinking.

1030
01:14:41,357 --> 01:14:43,348
- Down here.
- Yeah.

1031
01:14:46,162 --> 01:14:48,460
Ow! Watch the hair!

1032
01:15:08,551 --> 01:15:11,019
Will you stop spinning? I'm dizzy!

1033
01:15:11,087 --> 01:15:14,318
Let's go.
The tunnel of love.

1034
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:17,553
- In your dreams, Ace.
- How did you know about that?

1035
01:15:17,626 --> 01:15:19,651
Oxnard. Big mouth!

1036
01:15:29,972 --> 01:15:32,133
Follow me.

1037
01:15:44,353 --> 01:15:46,344
Who's the man?

1038
01:15:51,994 --> 01:15:54,258
They could have seen you!

1039
01:16:06,242 --> 01:16:09,575
- Why do you keep doing that?
- That's just how I roll, baby.

1040
01:16:16,252 --> 01:16:17,620
If Scooby-Doo
has taught me anything,

1041
01:16:17,621 --> 01:16:20,721
is that one of these books
will activate a secret door.

1042
01:16:28,297 --> 01:16:34,964
Earthy, sweet, a strong bouquet of bamboo
with a slight infusion of crocus.

1043
01:16:35,037 --> 01:16:37,505
Just a touch of wild grass and... butt!

1044
01:16:40,543 --> 01:16:42,534
I smell panda poop.

1045
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:45,670
Excellenty ear.

1046
01:17:00,429 --> 01:17:03,694
- How did you know that?
- I'm a meddling kid.

1047
01:17:12,241 --> 01:17:16,200
Dookie marks the spot.
Must be Poo-mas.

1048
01:17:16,278 --> 01:17:18,678
Or Jimmy Poo.

1049
01:17:18,747 --> 01:17:21,841
The Penningtons think they're smart,
but they're poo-pid.

1050
01:17:21,917 --> 01:17:26,013
We've caught them brown-footed.
They really stepped in it.

1051
01:17:26,088 --> 01:17:28,579
OK, Ace, enough of this crap.

1052
01:17:30,292 --> 01:17:33,125
You said "crap".
You did. OK, fine, fine.

1053
01:17:36,732 --> 01:17:39,963
National Bureau of Fish
and Wildlife, how can I direct you?

1054
01:17:40,035 --> 01:17:43,368
Yes, I have an anonymous tip
for Agent Hollander.

1055
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:46,840
Is he currently on... duty?

1056
01:17:48,944 --> 01:17:51,742
- Gum! I need a piece of gum.
- Here.

1057
01:18:05,594 --> 01:18:08,654
We received an anonymous tip
instructing us to come here.

1058
01:18:08,731 --> 01:18:10,926
From whom?

1059
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,831
Anonymous.

1060
01:18:12,902 --> 01:18:17,430
The tip said that the case of the missing
panda cub has been solved!

1061
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:19,436
You're the one
who called in the tip?

1062
01:18:19,637 --> 01:18:22,637
That's it, short stack.
Now you're in big trouble.

1063
01:18:22,711 --> 01:18:28,274
No. He's in big trouble!
We found these shoes in his closet!

1064
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:32,980
It proves that my mom
didn't steal the panda.

1065
01:18:35,157 --> 01:18:37,250
I think I understand.

1066
01:18:37,326 --> 01:18:42,263
This cartoon has taken advantage
of my son's hospitality.

1067
01:18:42,331 --> 01:18:45,164
He's found some cheap
costume store haberdashery,

1068
01:18:45,234 --> 01:18:48,863
snuck it in as a birthday gift,
and planted it in my home.

1069
01:18:48,938 --> 01:18:52,302
And now he expects you to believe
that I used these ridiculous things...

1070
01:18:52,303 --> 01:18:55,003
in the commission of a crime?

1071
01:18:55,077 --> 01:18:59,741
Yes! Can you believe this guy?!
I mean, he's pathetic!

1072
01:18:59,815 --> 01:19:02,909
I'm glad I'm not in his shoes!
No pun intended.

1073
01:19:02,985 --> 01:19:06,421
He's been trying to save his mom
with all sorts of crazy theories.

1074
01:19:06,488 --> 01:19:11,221
Get rid of these. He came by the NBFW
command center just the other day.

1075
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:13,693
- National Bureau of Fish and Wildlife?
- Yeah.

1076
01:19:13,762 --> 01:19:15,256
I play golf with your director.

1077
01:19:15,257 --> 01:19:18,257
I hope you'll join us for dinner
next time he's in Florida, Agent...?

1078
01:19:18,334 --> 01:19:20,632
Russell Hollander.
That would be great.

1079
01:19:20,703 --> 01:19:23,137
How's the panda investigation coming?
I read...

1080
01:19:23,205 --> 01:19:26,641
Hey, Hometown!
You're not here to be interviewed!

1081
01:19:26,709 --> 01:19:29,701
Arrest this guy,
and let my mom out!

1082
01:19:29,778 --> 01:19:32,838
Would you excuse me for one second,
Mr. Pennington?

1083
01:19:32,915 --> 01:19:35,247
Call me Pennington.

1084
01:19:36,051 --> 01:19:37,379
Don't you worry, Ventura.

1085
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:38,680
I'm gonna make
an arrest, alright.

1086
01:19:38,681 --> 01:19:40,981
Two of 'em, in fact.
Because you're outta control!

1087
01:19:41,056 --> 01:19:45,422
Oh, you wanna see out of control?
Let's go, right now! Ha!

1088
01:19:45,494 --> 01:19:48,622
Ha! I win, bedhead.
Take these two in!

1089
01:19:48,697 --> 01:19:51,029
Ex-squeeze me?

1090
01:19:51,834 --> 01:19:53,271
I'm gonna make sure
you're both locked up...

1091
01:19:53,272 --> 01:19:54,772
until the panda case
is completed.

1092
01:19:54,872 --> 01:19:56,772
We don't need
anymore distractions.

1093
01:19:58,774 --> 01:20:00,674
Three o'clock!

1094
01:20:00,743 --> 01:20:03,576
- What the hell is that?
- Plan B.

1095
01:20:04,747 --> 01:20:07,272
Sorry! Sorry!

1096
01:20:07,349 --> 01:20:10,375
- Ah, panda song.
- Here we go.

1097
01:20:10,953 --> 01:20:12,682
Uh-oh. Hello!

1098
01:20:12,755 --> 01:20:16,384
The sweet sound of a mother panda
calling her young.

1099
01:20:16,992 --> 01:20:19,153
Oops! We're out of power!

1100
01:20:19,228 --> 01:20:22,686
The house is clean!

1101
01:20:22,765 --> 01:20:25,199
- Check around back!
- OK.

1102
01:20:27,569 --> 01:20:30,265
They're small.
Why did you let them go?

1103
01:20:30,339 --> 01:20:34,969
Turn it up! Go!
Ting Tang will hear his mom calling him!

1104
01:20:37,513 --> 01:20:41,005
- Let's go!
- Get the guy with the boom box!

1105
01:20:46,588 --> 01:20:49,216
Over there,
point it over there!

1106
01:21:03,806 --> 01:21:07,867
Congratulations.
You found my horse stalls.

1107
01:21:07,943 --> 01:21:09,412
Sir, I apologize
for the misunderstanding.

1108
01:21:09,413 --> 01:21:12,313
Just get him off my property!

1109
01:21:12,381 --> 01:21:15,145
Silence!
They're all here.

1110
01:21:15,217 --> 01:21:17,981
Come on, half pint,
I'm getting tired of this.

1111
01:21:18,053 --> 01:21:20,180
Ha!

1112
01:21:23,392 --> 01:21:26,156
Don't go near those doors!

1113
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:32,930
Princess! Tabby!

1114
01:21:37,906 --> 01:21:39,771
Otter! Piggy!

1115
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:48,411
Tortoise! Freedom the Hawk!
Be free!

1116
01:21:48,484 --> 01:21:50,645
Possum!

1117
01:22:06,835 --> 01:22:09,599
Ting Tang, I found you!
Touchdown!

1118
01:22:10,439 --> 01:22:13,431
Go to the hay stack!
I'll be right back!

1119
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:16,501
Oh, no, you don't.

1120
01:22:22,985 --> 01:22:25,852
Come to me, my jungle friends!

1121
01:22:50,078 --> 01:22:52,546
Vámonos, amigos.

1122
01:22:55,017 --> 01:22:58,145
You had everything, sir.
Why did you do this?

1123
01:22:59,421 --> 01:23:02,720
I decided to start
an animal collection.

1124
01:23:03,292 --> 01:23:05,852
I wanted only the most famous pieces.

1125
01:23:05,928 --> 01:23:08,453
Smooth ride for stolen property,
Pennington.

1126
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:11,727
And what a Pennington wants,

1127
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,132
a Pennington gets.

1128
01:23:14,469 --> 01:23:18,371
Mr. Pennington, Sr. sir,
you're under arrest.

1129
01:23:23,645 --> 01:23:26,512
Whack!

1130
01:23:27,182 --> 01:23:29,116
Yahtzee!

1131
01:23:29,184 --> 01:23:31,516
What's that on your tie?

1132
01:23:33,021 --> 01:23:35,319
I win.

1133
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:38,518
- Exit stage left.
- Come on.

1134
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:43,990
He's going to jail,
he's going to jail!

1135
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:47,365
Ace, you're a really great pet detective.

1136
01:23:48,837 --> 01:23:51,465
What can I say?

1137
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:53,770
Like father, like son.

1138
01:23:55,544 --> 01:23:57,842
I'm good, I'm good.
Let's go.

1139
01:23:58,647 --> 01:24:01,548
So when are you gonna find my koi fish?

1140
01:24:01,617 --> 01:24:06,179
I just solved a huge case!
I'm working on it.

1141
01:24:14,663 --> 01:24:17,496
Nothing to see here.
Just one of your fellow classmates...

1142
01:24:17,566 --> 01:24:21,229
taking down a powerful billionaire
for stealing celebrity animals.

1143
01:24:21,303 --> 01:24:25,069
Hey, I know where you're going, and
my future license plate is gonna be...

1144
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:27,438
"ACE JR".

1145
01:24:32,247 --> 01:24:34,909
Where's he going?

1146
01:24:34,983 --> 01:24:37,144
Like father, like son.

1147
01:24:44,259 --> 01:24:47,387
Like father, like son!
Come on!

1148
01:24:48,163 --> 01:24:51,291
You guys want your pets or not?
Come on!

1149
01:25:08,150 --> 01:25:12,109
Mr. Chompers!
You stole our pets?

1150
01:25:12,187 --> 01:25:15,486
I'm the pet detective here.
He stole your pets.

1151
01:25:15,557 --> 01:25:17,752
He wants to be just like his dad.

1152
01:25:17,993 --> 01:25:19,984
He wants to be just like his dad.

1153
01:25:20,062 --> 01:25:22,496
Cruel, shallow, and selfish.

1154
01:25:22,564 --> 01:25:25,328
You forgot filthy rich and egomaniacal.

1155
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,732
We're Penningtons.
We can have what we want!

1156
01:25:27,803 --> 01:25:31,102
Oh, you're quite a pair.
But this time an Ace trumps a pair!

1157
01:25:32,541 --> 01:25:34,571
You did not just make that lame joke.

1158
01:25:34,643 --> 01:25:36,575
Oh, I did, sir! And you
and your dad...

1159
01:25:36,576 --> 01:25:40,276
are going to look great
in matching orange jumpsuits.

1160
01:25:41,049 --> 01:25:43,517
You think you're a good detective?

1161
01:25:43,585 --> 01:25:46,486
Solve this.

1162
01:25:50,425 --> 01:25:52,950
The fish...

1163
01:25:53,028 --> 01:25:55,519
is about to disappear.

1164
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:01,528
- Greeny!
- No!

1165
01:26:01,603 --> 01:26:04,436
Come on, I need help!

1166
01:26:04,506 --> 01:26:06,667
Open his mouth, I'm going in.

1167
01:26:06,742 --> 01:26:09,506
- No!
- 5 of you are going on a mission.

1168
01:26:09,578 --> 01:26:13,173
Couple of you
probably aren't coming back.

1169
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:17,416
Ace, be careful!

1170
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:21,621
What the...? Mazel tov.

1171
01:26:21,690 --> 01:26:24,523
Easy, Mr. Chompers.

1172
01:26:24,593 --> 01:26:27,153
That's where my hairdryer went.

1173
01:26:29,564 --> 01:26:33,330
His mouth is closing!
People, his mouth is closing!

1174
01:26:33,402 --> 01:26:35,529
I think I got him! I got him!

1175
01:26:36,471 --> 01:26:38,029
Careful!

1176
01:26:38,106 --> 01:26:42,406
Ewww! I think I just squeezed his liver!
That's disgusting!

1177
01:26:45,747 --> 01:26:47,738
Greeny!

1178
01:26:55,991 --> 01:26:57,458
No!

1179
01:27:10,872 --> 01:27:13,238
Way to go, Sparky!

1180
01:27:14,075 --> 01:27:16,236
Grandpa, what are you doing here?

1181
01:27:16,311 --> 01:27:21,271
I'm taking ten minutes off from retirement
to help you wrap up your first case.

1182
01:27:21,349 --> 01:27:25,786
- Thanks, Grandpa.
- Hey, Sparky, good going! Good Sparky!

1183
01:27:25,854 --> 01:27:29,290
I told you.
I told you he was sleeping.

1184
01:27:30,592 --> 01:27:35,291
Who had the hamster?
And the snake, and the turtle...

1185
01:27:35,363 --> 01:27:38,161
- Thanks, Ace.
- It's what I do.

1186
01:27:38,233 --> 01:27:42,567
Now, Laura,
since I solved your case...

1187
01:27:43,805 --> 01:27:46,740
there was something
I kind of wanted to tell you.

1188
01:27:47,275 --> 01:27:49,266
What?

1189
01:27:50,979 --> 01:27:55,848
Well, it all kind of started
when I met you in third grade...

1190
01:27:55,917 --> 01:27:57,976
Don't be shy, Ace.

1191
01:27:58,053 --> 01:28:02,012
You like me.
You have a crush on me.

1192
01:28:02,824 --> 01:28:04,621
No.

1193
01:28:04,693 --> 01:28:06,684
I have a huge crush on you!

1194
01:28:07,929 --> 01:28:10,420
That's what I just said.

1195
01:28:18,974 --> 01:28:23,434
I'm good, I'm good now. Alright,
let me just get my sealegs. This way.

1196
01:28:29,351 --> 01:28:33,412
I am Ace Ventura Jr.
Pet Detective.

1197
01:28:34,155 --> 01:28:37,056
And I declare all of your cases...

1198
01:28:37,125 --> 01:28:40,253
closed!

1199
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:48,858
Ace! Ace! Ace!

1200
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:10,155
Ace Jr... you're the man!

1201
01:29:10,225 --> 01:29:15,424
Actually, you know what, Grandpa?
You're right! I am the man!

1202
01:29:15,497 --> 01:29:17,488
Get over here, Laura.

1203
01:29:37,986 --> 01:29:41,786
- I am so proud of you, Ace.
- Ventura!

1204
01:29:41,856 --> 01:29:44,086
- Thank you, honey.
- I love you, too, Mom.

1205
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:46,354
Alrighty, then!
