81
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:36,116
heard you're having
dog problems.

00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,750
Good news travels fast.

83
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:38,952
Still got a few friends.

84
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,553
I know.

85
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,388
That's why I'm here.

86
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:44,056
I was wondering and thinking

87
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,692
that maybe you could
talk to Al Strauss for me.

88
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,927
I know he's retired,
but his son Mikey

89
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:50,562
is a union lawyer now.

90
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,197
I think Mike would listen
to Al.

91
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,466
Mikey's a pisser
like the old man.

92
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,900
They're both of them
stubborn as hell.

93
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,870
He won't back down.
Can you just talk to Al for me?

94
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:02,207
I've gotta go
meet Mike at Hoffmans.

95
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:05,845
You handle it.

96
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,646

97
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,015
Don't even think
about going to your partners.

98
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,285
Don't... don't start, pop.

99
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,687
I don't have partners.

100
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:15,255
The Miramar is mine.

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,892

103
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:21,161
And what brought him down
from Chicago all of a sudden?

104
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:22,963
He likes Sinatra.
How the hell do I know?

105
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:24,865
You know.

106

107
00:09:26,668 --> 00:09:29,570

00:13:43,261 --> 00:13:45,228
But we had two goddamn
hurricanes this fall

168
00:13:45,263 --> 00:13:46,763
that cost me the high holidays.

169
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:48,732
I blew Christmas thanks to you.

170
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:51,736
Now if I don't make good
on Frank's new year's run,

171
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,737
it's over.

172
00:13:52,771 --> 00:13:54,905
You shut me down, Mike,
then what?

173
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:57,173
Then maybe the next guy
runs an open shop, Ike.

174
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,646
My people are happy, all right?

175
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,382
I pay them better
than any hotel on the beach.

176
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,317
They don't want it,
and I don't want it.

177
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:10,219
I killed myself getting
my own place,

178
00:14:10,253 --> 00:14:11,453
and now I'm gonna
make you--

179
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:13,189
Make the union my partner?

180
00:14:13,223 --> 00:14:14,824
Let you tell me
what I'm supposed to pay?

181
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:16,492
How to run my hotel?

182
00:14:16,526 --> 00:14:18,694
I'll be out of business
by summer.

183
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:25,168
So who do you like
in the orange bowl?

184
00:14:25,203 --> 00:14:29,306
We are talking about
my goddamn survival, Mike.

185
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,710
My hotel. My family.

186
00:14:32,744 --> 00:14:36,014
I will do whatever
I have to do to stay alive.

187
00:14:36,048 --> 00:14:38,282
Do you hear me?

188
00:14:38,317 --> 00:14:40,518
You know what? Fine. Fine.

189
00:14:40,553 --> 00:14:42,553
I'll pull my guys
off the line till midnight,

190
00:14:42,588 --> 00:14:44,589
- okay? That gives you the day.
- Okay?

191
00:14:44,623 --> 00:14:47,058
That's the best I can do.
Midnight?

192
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:49,026
It's goddamn
new year's eve, Mike.

193
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:51,830
Sinatra starts
his second show at midnight.

194
00:14:51,864 --> 00:14:53,965
What the fuck am I
supposed to do in a day?

195
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:56,367
Unionize.

196
00:15:01,673 --> 00:15:04,642
This could get ugly, Mike.

197
00:15:04,676 --> 00:15:07,244
It <i>will</i> get ugly.

198
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,514
Give Vera a squeeze for me.

199
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:31,568
Victor.

200
00:15:35,106 --> 00:15:37,140
Get Ricki. Have her do
something with the cabanas--

201
00:15:37,175 --> 00:15:39,009
A fashion show, bikini contest.

202
00:15:39,043 --> 00:15:40,677
Comp 'em the shit champagne,
screwdrivers.

203
00:15:40,712 --> 00:15:43,314
Let's keep the lobby clear
in case our friends come back.

204
00:15:43,348 --> 00:15:45,316
Wait a minute. The strike--
They're coming back?

205
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,054
No. I don't know.

206
00:15:49,088 --> 00:15:50,088
Stevie?

207
00:16:15,012 --> 00:16:16,246
You look like shit.

208
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:19,216
Well, as grandpa always said...

209
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,651
"You only go around
once in life,

210
00:16:20,685 --> 00:16:23,221
and sometimes,
not even then."

211
00:16:23,255 --> 00:16:26,258
You do know that
your grandfather's insane?

212
00:16:35,335 --> 00:16:37,336
You starting new year's
a little early?

213
00:16:40,774 --> 00:16:43,042
I always hated new year's.

214
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:45,110
Even as a kid.

215
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:47,012
Seemed like the only people
having a good time

216
00:16:47,046 --> 00:16:48,613
were the tourists.

217
00:16:48,647 --> 00:16:52,217
Just couldn't
compete with that.

218
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:55,386
I guess I had my nose
to the glass.

219
00:16:59,258 --> 00:17:02,027
They're back on at midnight.

220
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:03,896
Can we stall?

221
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,899
Tell 'em we'll vote
in the new year?

222
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:08,734
It may get us through the night.
Mike's too smart.

223
00:17:08,768 --> 00:17:10,836
He wants to hit us.
Make an example.

224
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:12,705
The whole town's
watching the Miramar tonight.

225
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:15,274
He wants to shut us down.

226
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:19,545
How 'bout this--
How 'bout no fucking way?

227
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:22,714
Not tonight.
Not in my joint.

228
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:25,184
You know who's upstairs
in my goddamn hotel?

229
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:26,618
Mr. Frank Sinatra.

230
00:17:26,653 --> 00:17:28,453
Francis Albert Sinatra,

231
00:17:28,488 --> 00:17:30,222
in my presidential suite.

232
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:32,991
And tonight he's walking out
onto my stage,

233
00:17:33,026 --> 00:17:34,893
in my hotel,

234
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:37,529
and he's ringing in
my goddamn new year.

235
00:17:37,563 --> 00:17:39,364
That sounds like a lot of fun.

236
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:42,234
It sounds like a hell
of a lot of fun.

237
00:17:44,004 --> 00:17:45,671
So basically, you got
a warehouse full of booze

238
00:17:45,705 --> 00:17:46,672
sitting in Fort Lauderdale

239
00:17:46,706 --> 00:17:48,507
and no way to get it in here.

240
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:49,575
Not until now.

241
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,711
How you gonna find guys
crazy enough

242
00:17:51,745 --> 00:17:52,912
to fuck with the union?

243
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,582
Not crazy. Hungry.

244
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:56,583
Champ.

245
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,620
Thunder and lightning.

246
00:18:00,654 --> 00:18:03,055
Grady, tell my boy here
what you told me.

247
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,323
Some of the fellas...

248
00:18:04,357 --> 00:18:07,059
You know, the boxers
at the Sir John...

249
00:18:07,094 --> 00:18:09,362
If I ask them,
they'll drive for y'all.

250
00:18:09,396 --> 00:18:10,730
It could get messy.

251
00:18:10,764 --> 00:18:13,466
You pay cash...

252
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,702
These guys will park
your whiskey in the lot.

253
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,606
I'll be waiting for you.

254
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,141
All right. Let's go, champ.

255
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:26,044
Stevie...
Mm?

256
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:28,513
Miramar doesn't hire
dopers or felons.

257
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:30,749
I'll do my best.

258
00:18:46,232 --> 00:18:48,166
It's your fault, kid.

259
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:49,234
Sounds good.

260
00:18:49,268 --> 00:18:51,803
The card room?
Yeah, right off the lobby,

261
00:18:51,837 --> 00:18:54,006
but we got a $1,000 limit
on that game.

262
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,208
Bel? It's Ike.

263
00:18:56,242 --> 00:18:58,677
Sure, but if you got
the juice you say,

264
00:18:58,711 --> 00:19:00,178
there's the cabana game tonight.

265
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:03,148
Cabana one,
next to the ice machine.

266
00:19:03,182 --> 00:19:06,451
Yeah. All night.
That game's no limit.

267
00:19:06,485 --> 00:19:10,822
Sure. Right. Okay, fine.
You let me know.

268
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:12,691
If that mobster's got
two nickels to rub together,

269
00:19:12,725 --> 00:19:14,426
I'm a rockette.

270
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,095
Hey. Ike. I'm dying here.

271
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,898
It's like a morgue.
I had to let Iggy go.

272
00:19:19,932 --> 00:19:22,935
Dead. No action. And it's
the season, for Christ sakes.

273
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:26,305
I got ponies, dogs, jai alai.

274
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:27,907
I got bubkes.

275
00:19:30,777 --> 00:19:32,312
What would you like me
to do, Belvin?

276
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:33,780
You know what you gotta do.

277
00:19:33,814 --> 00:19:37,483
You gotta talk to our friend.

278
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:39,651
You gotta cut
the head off this thing.

279
00:19:39,686 --> 00:19:41,019
You can't ask Francis Albert

280
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:42,420
to walk through
that circus tonight.

281
00:19:42,455 --> 00:19:45,290
Somebody's gonna get hurt.

282
00:19:45,324 --> 00:19:47,192
I heard they killed Vera's pup.

283
00:19:47,226 --> 00:19:49,994
Come on, now.
That's just wrong.

284
00:19:52,631 --> 00:19:53,631
Ugly.

285
00:19:57,937 --> 00:20:00,105
All right. Where is he?

286
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,106
Now you're thinking.

287
00:20:01,141 --> 00:20:03,542
He just got back
from his honeymoon.

288
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,977
Ben divorced Doris?

289
00:20:05,012 --> 00:20:07,447
Well, kind of.
She died in childbirth.

290
00:20:07,481 --> 00:20:10,550
Didn't... didn't Ben's first
wife die in childbirth, too?

291
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:13,254
Yeah. What are the odds?

292
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:17,391
This new kid's
a real beauty. Whoo.

293
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,793
Legs to here,
like Cyd Charisse.

294
00:20:19,828 --> 00:20:22,497
Benny's smiling. Now's the time to get him.

295
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:25,332
Good luck, kid.

296
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:27,768
Thanks, Bel.
Sea breeze lingerie.

297
00:20:27,802 --> 00:20:29,236
Fat Tony!

298
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,172
It's a goddamn fruit salad.
How can it take 40 minutes?

299
00:20:33,207 --> 00:20:35,509
This meat loaf is ice cold.
Please.

300
00:20:35,543 --> 00:20:36,810
Give me that.

301
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:38,778
What's going on?
I don't know.

302
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:45,085
What the fresh hell is this?

303
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:48,289
Honey, honey,
all of the help is gone.

304
00:20:48,324 --> 00:20:49,891
Please do something.

305
00:21:02,707 --> 00:21:05,442
<i>Oye,</i> people! What the hell?

306
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:10,281
Che has taken Santa Clara.

307
00:21:10,315 --> 00:21:11,282
Havana will be next.

308
00:21:11,316 --> 00:21:15,587
Maria is there.
My Maria is there.

309
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:17,789
Batista will never
let Havana fall.

310
00:21:17,824 --> 00:21:18,890
It'll never happen.

311
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:21,059
We'll get Maria
on a plane tomorrow.

312
00:21:21,094 --> 00:21:23,395
I promise.
We'll get her home.

313
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:27,199
Victor, I need your help
out here. Come on.

314
00:21:39,446 --> 00:21:40,880
Mr. James.

315
00:21:40,914 --> 00:21:43,515
It's grady James.
Hey, champ!

316
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:47,185
Grady James! Can I get
your autograph, please?

317
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:48,686
Here you go.

318
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:53,056
Can you sign this for me
right here? Yeah.

319
00:22:12,378 --> 00:22:14,814
Hey, Stevie,
why don't you look around?

320
00:22:14,848 --> 00:22:17,149
Give me five minutes
with the fellas, okay?

321
00:22:32,065 --> 00:22:34,466
Just follow me
right through here.

Thank work for you, doll?

344
00:24:29,783 --> 00:24:34,087
Not bad, Miss E.
For a first pass.

345
00:24:40,427 --> 00:24:43,529
I'm Stevie.

346
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:46,498
Stevie Evans.

347
00:24:51,036 --> 00:24:53,337
Lily.

348
00:24:53,371 --> 00:24:56,540
So...

349
00:24:56,574 --> 00:24:59,042
What's a rich white boy

350
00:24:59,077 --> 00:25:01,878
doing in overtown
on new year's eve day?

351
00:25:01,913 --> 00:25:04,815
You waiting for
the ball to drop?

352
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:07,818
Yeah.

353
00:25:07,852 --> 00:25:10,054
Exactly.

354
00:25:17,496 --> 00:25:18,996
And?

355
00:25:23,135 --> 00:25:25,303
Has it?

356
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,946
Four...

357
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,049
Three...

358
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:38,217
Two...

359
00:25:48,596 --> 00:25:49,597
One.

360
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,284
Hey, did you guys see a really,
really pretty white girl

361
00:26:12,318 --> 00:26:13,352
come through here?

362
00:26:13,386 --> 00:26:15,220
Not since Elizabeth Taylor

363
00:26:15,255 --> 00:26:16,622
was doggin' Nat King Cole.

364
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:19,559
Forget about the girl, junior.

365
00:26:19,593 --> 00:26:21,628
You just
tell us where and when.

366
00:26:21,662 --> 00:26:23,797
The cavalry has arrived.

367
00:26:23,831 --> 00:26:25,332
You can't have
the McGuire sisters

368
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:26,333
sitting all together.

369
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:28,035
All right, fine,
then put Phyllis

370
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,670
between Danny Kaye
and Jack Carter.

371
00:26:29,705 --> 00:26:31,840
Daddy, I want Frankie Avalon.

372
00:26:31,874 --> 00:26:33,141
Who doesn't, kid?

373
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:36,044
Jodi Segal had Frankie Avalon
for <i>her</i> bat mitzvah.

374
00:26:36,078 --> 00:26:37,945
Lauren, honey,
let's leave daddy alone.

375
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,814
He's working.
Forget it.

376
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:41,016
You know, just forget
the whole thing.

377
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,317
I hate you.

378
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:43,785
You know, I don't even want
a damn bat mitzvah.

379
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,754
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What'd you just say?

380
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:48,090
Hey! Hey,
did she just fucking curse?

381
00:26:48,124 --> 00:26:49,458
Get back here
and apologize to your mother!

382
00:26:49,493 --> 00:26:51,060
She's not my mother!
Lauren!

383
00:26:51,094 --> 00:26:52,729
Honey, it's okay.

384
00:26:52,763 --> 00:26:53,829
It's okay.
She's just anxious.

385
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:55,298
Oh, she's anxious?

386
00:26:55,332 --> 00:26:57,667
Well, they pick up
on our stress.

387
00:26:59,837 --> 00:27:01,371
Stress...

388
00:27:07,545 --> 00:27:09,312
Lose Jack Kennedy
and the Lawfords.

389
00:27:09,347 --> 00:27:12,082
Why? They'll love
sitting with Kim Novak.

390
00:27:12,116 --> 00:27:13,984
Lose Novak, too.

391
00:27:14,018 --> 00:27:15,652
What? That's a great table.

392
00:27:15,686 --> 00:27:17,787
It took us two weeks to get a--
They canceled.

393
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:19,622
All right? The strike's
all over the news.

394
00:27:19,656 --> 00:27:23,058
We're bleeding here.

395
00:27:23,093 --> 00:27:24,093
Ugh!

396
00:27:29,298 --> 00:27:31,332
We'll be fine.
Yeah, you say so.

397
00:27:31,366 --> 00:27:34,802
I do. I'm not worried
about one night,

398
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:36,771
about some party.

399
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:40,475
Six years ago, this was
all just sand and mosquitoes.

400
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:42,711
Now it's the Miramar Playa.

401
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:44,313
You did that.

402
00:27:44,347 --> 00:27:45,881
Marry me.

403
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:48,117
We're already married.

404
00:27:48,152 --> 00:27:50,453
Right. Okay.

405
00:27:50,488 --> 00:27:51,454
Again.

406
00:27:51,488 --> 00:27:53,556
We'll see how tonight goes.

407
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:56,459
Shit. I gotta go.

408
00:27:56,494 --> 00:27:57,760
What-- what about lunch?

409
00:27:57,795 --> 00:27:59,062
I'll grab something.

410
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:02,965
Hey, who do you want
at your table tonight?

411
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,533
Um, Cary Grant

412
00:28:04,568 --> 00:28:06,468
and Sal Mineo.

413
00:28:06,503 --> 00:28:07,602
You get Georgie Jessel.

414
00:28:07,637 --> 00:28:09,004
Jerk.

415
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:10,539
Beauty.

416
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:14,509
Look at her, honey.
She's acting so weird.

417
00:28:16,145 --> 00:28:18,513
Won't come out when I call her.

418
00:28:18,547 --> 00:28:21,716
They pick up on our stress.

419
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:46,508
Everything all right?

420
00:28:46,543 --> 00:28:48,010
Yeah. Why?

421
00:28:48,044 --> 00:28:51,047
Why? You on the beach?

422
00:28:51,081 --> 00:28:54,284
Is Bel's cabana game
set for tonight?

423
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:55,518
Yeah, I'm seeing him
at 4:00.

424
00:28:55,552 --> 00:28:56,519
Good.

425
00:29:00,925 --> 00:29:05,595
Ugh. Sand.

426
00:29:05,629 --> 00:29:07,130
A necklace of bubbies.

427
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:09,965
That's what mom used to call 'em.
Yep.

428
00:29:17,473 --> 00:29:20,575
When you met mom,

429
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,477
saw her for the first time,

430
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,213
did you...

431
00:29:25,248 --> 00:29:27,583
I mean, was it--
was it like that thing,

432
00:29:27,617 --> 00:29:30,085
you know, like in the movies,
when you just know--

433
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,486
Bang-- she's the one?

434
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:37,660
No.

435
00:29:41,131 --> 00:29:44,133
That came after.
But it did happen.

436
00:29:44,168 --> 00:29:48,670
Your mother-- Stevie,
she was the love of my life,

437
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:52,675
but not like that.
Not that way.

438
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:55,878
What you're talking about...

439
00:29:55,912 --> 00:29:57,947
That only happened with Vera.

440
00:29:57,981 --> 00:30:03,219
You know, the first time
I saw Vee...

441
00:30:03,253 --> 00:30:05,788
I actually forgot
how to breathe.

442
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,527
You know that feeling?

443
00:30:17,434 --> 00:30:19,668
Congratulations.

444
00:30:19,703 --> 00:30:21,837
You poor son of a bitch.

445
00:30:21,872 --> 00:30:25,274
Hey, Stevie...

446
00:30:25,308 --> 00:30:27,777
Vera's everything to me.

447
00:30:27,811 --> 00:30:30,546
Look, it's been crazy--

448
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,214
Make it work with her.

449
00:30:33,851 --> 00:30:36,552
After we get through tonight,
everything will be cool.

450
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:42,257
Call me if you talk to Cuda.

451
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:43,458
Will do.

452
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:51,498
Okay, here's the drill--

453
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:54,601
On stage-- No flowers,
no perfume.

454
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:56,336
Jack and water on the piano.

455
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:59,406
Shecky does a tight 15 to open,
not a second more.

456
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,642
Stick all the blondes
in the front.

457
00:31:01,677 --> 00:31:04,178
Keep the air on high.
He likes it cold. Done.

458
00:31:04,213 --> 00:31:05,580
Send him something light
for dinner--

459
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,449
Spaghetti marinara, no meat,

460
00:31:07,483 --> 00:31:09,117
like around 6:00, okay?

461
00:31:09,151 --> 00:31:11,720
And I'll, uh, send somebody up
with our list in about an hour.

462
00:31:11,755 --> 00:31:12,755
Okay.

463
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,092
Are we okay tonight?

464
00:31:16,127 --> 00:31:18,128
Okay? We are... magic.

465
00:31:18,162 --> 00:31:19,129
Pure magic.

466
00:31:19,163 --> 00:31:20,964
'Cause if he sees any empties,

467
00:31:20,998 --> 00:31:23,100
one empty seat, he walks.

468
00:31:23,134 --> 00:31:24,101
Square business, Ike.

469
00:31:24,135 --> 00:31:27,505
Frank is gone,
and you are done.

470
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:30,976
You tell Frank
there are no empties.

471
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,044
We are standing room only.

472
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,046
You'd better be.

473
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,682
Thanks, Jilly.

474
00:31:45,292 --> 00:31:47,559
Get Mike Strauss for me. Now.

475
00:32:05,747 --> 00:32:06,714
Mike.

476
00:32:06,748 --> 00:32:08,549
So did you come to your senses?

477
00:32:08,584 --> 00:32:11,286
You have to call off your strike
till after Sinatra's run.

478
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,788
Oh, I have to?

479
00:32:12,822 --> 00:32:16,024
I will revisit
the union vote in a week.

480
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,126
One week. I promise.

481
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,328
You guys come back
at midnight tonight,

482
00:32:20,363 --> 00:32:21,696
and I am finished.

483
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:22,697
That's the whole point, Ike.

484
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,866
We strike
when it hurts the most.

485
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,234
I will lose everything.

486
00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:29,871
You know me, Mike.
I'm not gonna let that happen.

487
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,340
I will not let you do this.

488
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:34,576
You know, that sounds
distinctly like a threat.

489
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,144
It's the truth.

490
00:32:36,178 --> 00:32:38,479
Well, then, my friend,

491
00:32:38,514 --> 00:32:42,350
I guess we both do what
our conscience tells us to do.

492
00:33:18,254 --> 00:33:20,355
Thank you.

493
00:33:36,238 --> 00:33:41,342
Sorry. I soaked your shoes.

494
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,310
Cooled me off.

495
00:33:43,345 --> 00:33:44,311
Ike Evans.

496
00:33:44,345 --> 00:33:47,281
Lily Augustine... Diamond.

497
00:33:47,315 --> 00:33:49,884
It's a pleasure, Mrs. Diamond.

498
00:33:49,918 --> 00:33:51,919
Mr. Evans.

499
00:33:51,954 --> 00:33:55,189
Of course. From the Miramar.
You have a son, right?

500
00:33:55,224 --> 00:33:57,125
Two, actually--
Danny and Stevie.

501
00:33:57,159 --> 00:33:59,761
I hope I'll be seeing you
at our Sinatra show tonight.

502
00:33:59,795 --> 00:34:02,997
Absolutely.
Wouldn't miss it.

503
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:08,569
Put your eyes
back in your head.

504
00:34:10,305 --> 00:34:11,272
Come here.

505
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,313
Ben.

506
00:34:19,347 --> 00:34:23,217
Ike. Sit down.

507
00:34:23,251 --> 00:34:25,886
Catch a few rays.

508
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,421
Relax.

509
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:46,640
So, Ben, I was sorry
to hear about Doris.

510
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,611
I'm still in mourning.

511
00:34:54,382 --> 00:34:58,452
Remember the day that you, me,
and do went out to the glades?

512
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:00,054
Out to your quarry?

513
00:35:00,088 --> 00:35:02,156
And she looked into that hole

514
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,891
where you were digging out
all that coral...

515
00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:05,993
Limestone.
Limestone, right.

516
00:35:06,028 --> 00:35:08,662
Yeah, for your hotel lobby.

517
00:35:08,697 --> 00:35:10,498
And she asked you how deep
the water was,

518
00:35:10,532 --> 00:35:13,734
and you said...

519
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:15,069
Bottomless.

520
00:35:15,103 --> 00:35:17,071
Bottomless.

521
00:35:17,105 --> 00:35:19,107
Bottomless.

522
00:35:21,977 --> 00:35:24,979
Parked a lot of cars
down there, kid.

523
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:31,252
Limestone, coral, marble...

524
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:33,688
You spent a lot
on that palace of yours, huh?

525
00:35:33,723 --> 00:35:35,023
What's-- what's your monthly nut
over there?

526
00:35:35,057 --> 00:35:35,990
What do you owe?

527
00:35:36,025 --> 00:35:38,426
You know what I owe, Ben.

528
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:40,028
Humor me.

529
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,332
$65,000.

530
00:35:43,366 --> 00:35:46,802
A month? Every month?

531
00:35:49,172 --> 00:35:50,405
And you come up with that?

532
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,508
How about this month?
How about right now?

533
00:35:53,543 --> 00:35:55,877
Have you got 65 G's
on you right now?

534
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:01,349
I'm back two days,

535
00:36:01,384 --> 00:36:04,219
and already I hear
you've got union problems.

536
00:36:04,253 --> 00:36:06,788
I need your help tonight.

537
00:36:09,624 --> 00:36:12,526
I'd like you to talk
to Mike Strauss.

538
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,028
I'm not in the fucking union.
So what do you want from me?

539
00:36:15,063 --> 00:36:16,597
Right.

540
00:36:16,631 --> 00:36:19,567
What'll it take?
What do you want?

541
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:20,568
The rest.

542
00:36:20,602 --> 00:36:22,636
I got half.
I want the rest.

543
00:36:22,671 --> 00:36:25,440
No.

544
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,441
What did you say?

545
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,642
I said no.

546
00:36:27,676 --> 00:36:29,010
The Miramar is--
Mine!

547
00:36:35,351 --> 00:36:36,351
Mine.

548
00:36:44,261 --> 00:36:46,962
Fine.

549
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:48,431
You take it.

550
00:36:48,465 --> 00:36:51,701
You know what the Miramar is
worth without me running it?

551
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:56,071
It's a pile of sand,
silverware, and towels.

552
00:36:56,106 --> 00:36:57,673
You'd get half of what
you put in,

553
00:36:57,707 --> 00:37:01,176
but you take it.

554
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,845
You fucking choke on it.

555
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,085
Hey.

556
00:37:12,055 --> 00:37:14,689
Hey.

557
00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:17,759
Come here.

558
00:37:17,793 --> 00:37:18,793
You cut yourself.

559
00:37:27,102 --> 00:37:28,803
Jesus.

560
00:37:28,837 --> 00:37:32,272
You're very, very
highly strung these days.

561
00:37:32,307 --> 00:37:34,641
You ought to relax.

562
00:37:34,675 --> 00:37:35,809
I'm serious.

563
00:37:35,843 --> 00:37:38,812
Why don't you go home?

564
00:37:39,981 --> 00:37:42,917
Kiss that pretty shiksa wife
of yours for me.

565
00:37:42,951 --> 00:37:45,453
Have a drink.

566
00:37:45,487 --> 00:37:46,988
I'll see you later.

567
00:37:50,192 --> 00:37:51,225
Isaac!

568
00:37:53,762 --> 00:37:58,033
You ever hear the story
about the frog and the scorpion?

569
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,835
No, Ben.

570
00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:04,840
The scorpion begs the frog
to carry it across the river.

571
00:38:04,874 --> 00:38:08,244
The frog says, "No. No.

572
00:38:08,278 --> 00:38:11,380
If I carry you,
y-you'll sting me to death."

573
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:14,784
And the scorpion says,
"Oh, come on, froggy.

574
00:38:14,818 --> 00:38:17,686
If I sting you,
we'll both drown."

575
00:38:17,721 --> 00:38:21,724
So the frog lets the scorpion
hop on its back.

576
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:24,427
Halfway across the river,

577
00:38:24,462 --> 00:38:28,565
the scorpion whips his stinger
into the frog's ass.

578
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:31,935
Now while the frog is sinking,
and they're both gonna drown,

579
00:38:31,969 --> 00:38:36,740
the frog says,
"But why? Why?"

580
00:38:36,774 --> 00:38:39,210
You know
what the scorpion says?

581
00:38:39,244 --> 00:38:40,211
What?

582
00:38:40,245 --> 00:38:42,080
"It's in my nature."

583
00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:46,886
In the end, Ike,
we are who we are,

584
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,954
and I want more.

585
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:53,226
That's what I've always wanted.
I've always wanted... more.

586
00:38:58,264 --> 00:39:00,098
Think about that

587
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:04,536
as we swim across
the river of life together.

588
00:39:19,383 --> 00:39:21,484
Hi, Stevie.

589
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:24,955
Ladies.
Welcome to the Miramar.

590
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:26,623
Thank you.
Hi.

591
00:39:26,657 --> 00:39:29,292
You ready to meet the richest,

592
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:32,795
best-looking,
most famous guys in the world?

593
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,530
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

594
00:39:34,565 --> 00:39:37,400
You ready to meet
millionaires and movie stars?

595
00:39:37,434 --> 00:39:39,101
Yeah.

596
00:39:39,136 --> 00:39:42,705
You ladies are beauty.

597
00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:46,275
You're sex.
You're every man's dream.

598
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:51,548
And you're the Miramar Playa's
gift to 1959.

599
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,584
You make us proud, girls.

600
00:39:54,618 --> 00:39:55,752
Yes, sir.

601
00:39:55,786 --> 00:39:56,786
- All right.
- Definitely.

602
00:39:56,821 --> 00:39:59,690
Oh. Make us rich.

603
00:39:59,724 --> 00:40:00,958
Bye, Stevie.

604
00:40:09,669 --> 00:40:11,470
Look what the cash dragged in.

605
00:40:11,504 --> 00:40:13,405
Granny.

606
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,407
Judi. Babe.

607
00:40:14,441 --> 00:40:15,574
Mmm.

608
00:40:15,608 --> 00:40:18,010
"Oh, Judi. Babe."

609
00:40:18,044 --> 00:40:21,613
Behave, or you're working
at fun fair.

610
00:40:23,383 --> 00:40:26,117
Miss silver, you kill me.

611
00:40:26,151 --> 00:40:27,918
Mm. Prove it, lover.

612
00:40:27,953 --> 00:40:30,988
"Never ride the working stock,"
Ike Evans.

613
00:40:31,022 --> 00:40:31,989
Oh, yes.

614
00:40:32,023 --> 00:40:33,223
Cuda.

615
00:40:33,257 --> 00:40:36,226
Get Miss Silver a very dry,
very cold gin Martini

616
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,595
with two pearl onions.

617
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,532
He remembers.

618
00:40:41,566 --> 00:40:43,133
Stevie?

619
00:40:43,168 --> 00:40:45,603
I'm gonna need you
for the night.

620
00:40:45,637 --> 00:40:49,507
I've been waiting my whole life
to hear <i>you</i> say that.

621
00:42:00,111 --> 00:42:03,381
How is everything?
Are we okay?

622
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:06,017
Mrs. Evans...

623
00:42:06,052 --> 00:42:09,188
We are beautiful.

624
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,791
<i>Por favor.</i>

625
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,327
Mm.

626
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:16,830
Ugh. Cut it out.

627
00:42:16,864 --> 00:42:18,798
Can somebody get Fluffy
off my sweater?

628
00:42:18,832 --> 00:42:19,799
She's getting it all--

629
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:20,900
Fluffy?

630
00:42:20,934 --> 00:42:22,601
I'm not kidding.
She keeps growling at me.

631
00:42:22,636 --> 00:42:26,438
Now she's really acting weird,
honey. Come, babe.

632
00:42:27,473 --> 00:42:28,773
Hey, Lauren.

633
00:42:28,808 --> 00:42:30,475
If you're gonna keep
wearing skirts that short,

634
00:42:30,509 --> 00:42:32,177
you'd better start
shaving your legs.

635
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:34,212
Dad!

636
00:43:34,107 --> 00:43:36,742
Do you like that?

637
00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:51,223
Aah! Don't!

638
00:43:51,257 --> 00:43:56,762
Don't! No! No, get it off me!
Aah! Can somebody help?!

639
00:43:56,796 --> 00:43:59,998
No! No! Aah!

640
00:44:00,033 --> 00:44:02,501
No! Aah! No!

641
00:44:02,535 --> 00:44:06,204
Aah! Can somebody help?!
Aah! No!

642
00:44:54,789 --> 00:44:57,590
Fact or fiction?

643
00:44:59,093 --> 00:45:02,896
Somebody once told me
that whatever you're doing

644
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,433
at the stroke of midnight
on new year's eve

645
00:45:05,467 --> 00:45:09,003
tells you what your whole year
will be like.

646
00:45:09,038 --> 00:45:11,072
It's just 10:00.

647
00:45:11,107 --> 00:45:16,612
Well, it's midnight somewhere.

648
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:54,150
Who are you?

649
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,256
The wrong woman.

650
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:01,992
<i>Now</i> you tell me.

651
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:31,487
Are we good?

652
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,189
Oh, yeah.

653
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:35,925
Rousted a few local pickpockets

654
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:39,695
and a couple of working girls
from the causeway.

655
00:46:39,729 --> 00:46:42,431
Our, uh, friends
from the justice department

656
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:43,932
are here to count heads.

657
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:49,872
