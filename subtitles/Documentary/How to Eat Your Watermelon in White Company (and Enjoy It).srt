first we buy 1 house|not costly just 1 lac $
[01:20:37]

[01:21:07]
and we get a loan from bank.
[01:21:08]

[01:21:20]
and after soem month we are selling.
[01:21:23]

[01:21:33]
you sold this house to zin in 2 lac dollars.
[01:21:36]

[01:21:36]
how come money for buy.
[01:21:37]

[01:21:40]
Relax excatly from there|where coem before.
[01:21:43]

[01:21:43]
1 more loan from bank.
[01:21:45]

[01:21:55]
there is no problem in bank loan.
[01:21:56]

[01:21:56]
becase bank manager get his share.
[01:22:00]

[01:22:03]

[01:22:16]
like that we are|but one day we must paid money to bank.
[01:22:21]

[01:22:25]
not to be paid.
[01:22:26]

Chapter 1 1 bank have procedure|if no body paid then he get his property.
[01:22:33]

[01:22:33]
and one person are less|and bank didnt have any option.
[01:22:40]
