2
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,554
My grand-grand father
and my grandfather were keeping bees,

3
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,675
and my father, too.

4
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,916
First I was not interested in bees,
I was afraid of bee stings.

5
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,718
When my father got older
he said to me:

6
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,710
"If you keep on avoiding bees,
I will sell them."

7
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,560
I did not like the idea.

8
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,668
I told myself:

9
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,671
"If my parents could stand the bee stings,
I can stand them, too."

10
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,678
After all I am not a softie.

11
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,879
My family used to be bee farmers

12
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
My grandfather had a tin can factory

13
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,081
He had a garden with fruit trees
and berries

14
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:54,282
and bee hives

15
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:05,583
I liked my grandfather also because
he had many animals, like dogs and horses

16
00:05:10,684 --> 00:05:13,684
The bees were the favourite animals
of grandpa

17
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:18,285
He owned 150 bee hives

18
00:05:31,986 --> 00:05:35,986
Lying in the grass of his garden,
I used to listen to the bees.

19
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:44,787
My father explained to me how the bees are necessary
for the fertilisation of the flowers

20
00:05:56,388 --> 00:06:01,188
To attract the bees, the flowers
produce sweet honey.

21
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:08,889
By moving from one flower to the next
the bees also transport pollen.

22
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:17,390
By collecting honey, the bees also fertilize flowers

23
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:27,491
My grandpa was a manager over gardens
machines and people.

24
00:06:27,492 --> 00:06:31,192
He was fascinated how everything
worked together

25
00:06:37,393 --> 00:06:42,593
But nowadays the bees have a hard time.
Since a few years many bees are dying

26
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:46,994
Not only in Switzerland.
Bees are dying worldwide.

27
00:06:46,995 --> 00:06:51,095
It's in the news all over.
But the cause is still a mystery

28
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:55,496
I start my journey
trying to solve this mystery

29
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,556
It's almost full bloom now.

30
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,549
It's such a gorgeous time of year
to be out here

31
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,592
It is just beautiful

32
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,118
And no one sees this.

33
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,637
Only the beekeeper sees this,
and the farmer sees this.

34
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,155
Listen.

35
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,914
Can you hear that?

36
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,636
That's the sound of money.

37
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,718
Fresh printed money.

38
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,159
Bees and trees.

39
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,959
Nice.

40
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,953
Ladies,

41
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,277
how are you today?

42
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,193
Are you busy?

43
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,110
It's warm, it's sunny.

44
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,754
An old maid.

45
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,158
That's a nut that didn't get shaken
and then got hold.

46
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,719
And right there.

47
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,669
Yummy, delicious.

48
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:32,070
One third of all we are eating
would not exist without bees

49
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:35,071
Grandpa told me how it works

50
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:38,072
All colourful and good-smelling flowers and plants
get fertilized by insects

51
00:08:38,073 --> 00:08:42,873
All other plants are fertilized by the wind.

52
00:08:48,674 --> 00:08:54,074
Grandpa was drawing the labels for
the jam jars himself

53
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:59,075
But the competitors were more efficient
and imported the fruits by railway

54
00:08:59,076 --> 00:09:05,076
Grandpa went bankruptcy
In the end he only had the bees.

55
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:10,577
They still kept bringing him honey
but apples were growing in the lawns he lost

56
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,913
It's sort of a deal that we made with
the almond growers

57
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,469
We know going in.
There are risks and opportunities.

58
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,796
The almond orchards,
they pay a lot of money.

59
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,632
I mean. It's no mystery.
We've got 4000 bee hives here

60
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,310
With 150 Dollars a hive
that's 600'000 dollars.

61
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,192
To me that's real money.

62
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,558
That might be Joe Black.

63
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,192
He might be flying down
to Bakersfield today.

64
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,637
I think California produces 80%

65
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,639
of the world production in almonds.

66
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,708
In terms of the almonds that are
actually in the market in the world,

67
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,833
it's higher than that.
It may be close to 90%.

68
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,552
It is not commercial to grow almonds
on a very small scale.

69
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,595
I know of no reason why that system will not
be sustainable for the long term.

70
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,510
There is nothing that I have seen in my 35 years
in the industry that will lead me to think

71
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:51,035
that this concentration of almonds in one area is
self-defeating in one way.

72
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,313
That it will somehow crash
as a result of being concentrated.

73
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,319
I have seen nothing that
would indicate that.

74
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,630
We would not have a business
without the bees.

75
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,631
Without some type of insect pollinator
almonds would not have any crop.

76
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,956
We have proven that again and again.

77
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,791
Our business relies entirely on pollination
by the bees.

78
00:11:52,092 --> 00:11:57,992
Apposite to bumblebees or butterflies
bees always stick to one type of flower.

79
00:11:57,993 --> 00:12:01,993
One bee always flies to the apple tree
an other bee always flys to another colourful flower.

80
00:12:01,994 --> 00:12:07,994
Only when the whole job with one type of flower
is finished a bee will change to an other type.

81
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:10,995
But here they do not have a choice.

82
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:16,596
There is nothing but almonds.

83
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:47,997
Inside the bee hive the bees
transfer the collected nektar to their sisters.

84
00:12:47,998 --> 00:12:50,998
They keep on chewing
until it turns into honey,

85
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:56,599
then they store the honey into honey combs.

86
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,900
They pack the pollen into small lumbs,

87
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:26,901
and store it as protein reserves.

88
00:13:26,902 --> 00:13:30,902
But the bees also bring home
information about the surrounding.

89
00:13:30,903 --> 00:13:34,903
As a first-grade student I saw a silent movie about bees

90
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:37,904
The title of the movie was "the dances of the bees".

91
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:40,905
The director of the movie was
Karl von Frisch, a scientist.

92
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:48,906
He received a Nobel Price for his studies
especially for the discovery of "the dances of the bees".

93
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:57,907
As he noticed, the bees tell their sisters in the hive
where and how far away from hive the nektar is located.

94
00:13:57,908 --> 00:14:05,908
The closer to the hive
the faster they shake their tails.

95
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:10,909
As a kid in the cinema, I was annoyed
by the smart bees with their complicated geometry.

96
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,910
The bees a so terribly smart and complicated.

97
00:14:15,911 --> 00:14:25,911
"Please count yourself!"

98
00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:32,912
At the "Freie Universität Berlin" professor Menzel
studies the question if bees can make free decisions.

99
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,913
His experimental setup leads the bees
into a dilemma.

100
00:14:35,914 --> 00:14:38,914
They already know one place with nektar.

101
00:14:38,915 --> 00:14:43,915
An other bee then gives them information
about a second equally good place with nektar.

102
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:54,916
What will the bee do?

103
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:59,917
"Bee takes off"

104
00:14:59,918 --> 00:15:07,918
Constantin, please switch on the radar.
I will walk to the receiver.

105
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,919
We can see here that the bee decided to fly
to the old nektar place.

106
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,920
She arrives there. There used to be
a place with nektar.

107
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:21,921
But now there is no more nektar.
We have removed the nektar.

108
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:28,022
Now she flies around in circles
searching the nektar.

109
00:15:28,023 --> 00:15:31,023
Now she is not flying back to the hive.

110
00:15:31,024 --> 00:15:33,924
She is flying towards East.

111
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:40,925
Eastwards is the second nektar place,
which was told her by the tail-shaking in the hive.

112
00:15:40,926 --> 00:15:44,926
Here is the second nektar place.
And here she is!

113
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:48,927
Ok, I can announce
the landing of red bee number 23.

114
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:52,928
Now she carries the nektar.

115
00:15:52,929 --> 00:16:09,929
Now she has to fly back to the hive.
She calculated the best route to fly back.

116
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:14,930
Here she arrives at the hive.

117
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:22,731
We can assume that even the small brain of a bee
is capable to make a decision between two possible options.

118
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,511
She is a lovely little insect.
Very tolerant.

119
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,793
Not very smart, but really tolerant.

120
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,637
Two weeks from today
The place here looks like an orchard to us,

121
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,390
but to them it looks like a desert.
There is nothing to eat.

122
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,195
The almond grower will call me saying:
"The bloom is over you may now go."

123
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,029
So we do go. Because if we would leave
the bees here, they would starve.

124
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,031
We are about to be run over.

125
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,992
This ribbon?
- I will do this ribbon, then that.

126
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,869
Okay.

127
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,635
Thank you.

128
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,790
He is starting from the other ribbon.

129
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,279
So maybe we will go a little away.

130
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,235
If he would just not spray the bees,
that would be great.

131
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,958
That's great.

132
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,999
Because it is really ...

133
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,631
You know, ideally they would spray at night.
When the bees are in.

134
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,151
By the time the material is dry,
and isn't so lethal. It is the next day.

135
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,476
If they would just spray at night.

136
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,479
But. You know. You can't see at night.

137
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,674
They don't know where they are at night.
These fields are massive. They get lost.

138
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,830
They are going to do what they are going to do.

139
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,391
It does not kill the bees.
But it repels the bees.

140
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,150
If after this material has dried on the bloom.

141
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
The bees bring that material back to the colony
and feed it to the babies.

142
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,514
19 days later we see an impact on the brood

143
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,677
We see brood die off.

144
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,670
And it is the fungicide at work.
Pretty much everyone knows it.

145
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,119
That's the only two motivations in life:
Greed and fear.

146
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:09,036
I don't know how to shrink a business
or a life style.

147
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,074
I would not be happy.
That is not in my DNA.

148
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,272
We are capitalists. We want to grow.

149
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,354
Total global domination.

150
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,157
Here the bees are feeling good.

151
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,709
They are having Sunday today.

152
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,949
No wonder they are making
such a clear honey.

153
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,751
Pure nature, no fungicide, no poison, anywhere.

154
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,634
This will be a wonderful honey.

155
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,554
I'm already looking forward to serve this honey.

156
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,519
Our bees are from an old rural breed.

157
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,357
The have accustomed themselves
to the surroundings since centuries.

158
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,269
If I would bring bees
from the middle land up here,

159
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,279
These bees would have a hard time
to survive the winter.

160
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,235
My bees need to survive
a winter longer than half a year.

161
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,514
And my bees are now used to that.

162
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,711
That's why it works well now.

163
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,713
Look at that ...

164
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,272
You don't belong here
with your yellow tail. Get away!

165
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,756
There, behind that mountain,
someone has bees.

166
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,160
I have no idea what breed he is having.
But occasionally his bees fly over here.

167
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:19,961
The strange bee with the yellow tail
is living in another bee hive.

168
00:21:19,962 --> 00:21:25,962
Her virgin queen was flying over the mountain
during swarming and was inseminated here by male bees.

169
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,795
This insemination happens somewhere in the air.

170
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,517
The queen finds a swarm of drones.

171
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,715
Drones (male bees) from another colony.
From another beekeeper.

172
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,470
A queen gets inseminated by up to 10 drones.

173
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,035
Like this a mixing can occur.

174
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,033
What kind of breed this is?
- Carnica.

175
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:03,150
I am a bit disappointed because
the old rural breed slowly disappears.

176
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,030
Yes, they are having this yellow tail.

177
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,639
I used to have the rural breed.
My father too.

178
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,669
Why did you change to Carnica?

179
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,115
To tell the truth. Now I don't
need a ladder anymore.

180
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,960
No more searching and collecting swarms.
- Really?

181
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,712
Of my 70 colonies only three of them
flew around for swarming.

182
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,468
Really?
- Yes, indeed.

183
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,031
Also, I get bitten only very seldom
by Carnica bees.

184
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,399
So, you are saying these bees bite less
than bees from my rural breed? - For sure.

185
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,116
Sometimes I work with friends having the rural breed.

186
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,352
If I would have to do beekeeping
with the rural breed again, I would stop.

187
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,677
I would not be able to have 70 colonies.
- Really?

188
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,838
I don't need a protecting net.

189
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,433
I never use it anymore.

190
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,430
Don't you want to change as well?
- I think I am too old for it.

191
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,429
You are not that old yet, aren't you.
- I am, I'm getting weaker.

192
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:14,930
The fact that the insemination
happens in the air by other drones,

193
00:23:14,931 --> 00:23:17,931
not inside the own hive by the own brothers,

194
00:23:17,932 --> 00:23:21,932
is a natural protection against incest.

195
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:25,033
The queen is the mother of all
the 50'000 bees in the hive

196
00:23:25,034 --> 00:23:27,934
She is laying up to 2'000 eggs per day,

197
00:23:27,935 --> 00:23:31,935
which corresponds to the weight
of her own body.

198
00:23:31,936 --> 00:23:35,036
The other bees in the hive take
very good care of the queen.

199
00:23:35,037 --> 00:23:42,937
They feed her. They clean her.

200
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:46,938
When the queen dies, the bees have to
raise a new queen.

201
00:23:46,939 --> 00:23:51,939
This risky period takes one month

202
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:57,940
The queen can also lay not inseminated eggs.
These eggs will develop into drones.

203
00:23:57,941 --> 00:24:02,941
The eggs which were inseminated by drones
will develop into working bees.

204
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:06,042
The egg first develops into a larva

205
00:24:06,043 --> 00:24:08,943
The bees feed the larva with nectar and pollen

206
00:24:08,944 --> 00:24:11,944
Then they close the lid.

207
00:24:11,945 --> 00:24:15,045
The larva pupate,

208
00:24:15,046 --> 00:24:20,646
and three weeks later a bee emerges.

209
00:24:30,047 --> 00:24:34,047
The bigger male drones need three days
longer to hatch out.

210
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:38,948
The drones must be fed by the bees,

211
00:24:38,949 --> 00:24:42,949
such that they have enough strength
for their daily flight in the afternoon,

212
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:48,050
hoping to find a princess in the air.

213
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:54,651
In autumn, at the end of the mating season
the remaining drones are killed by the bees.

214
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,230
If I find the new queen,
I will have to kill her.

215
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,634
Here she is.

216
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,476
You were having fun with foreign drones.

217
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:37,310
That's the penalty for it.

218
00:25:55,011 --> 00:26:00,911
Actually honey is not meant for us humans.

219
00:26:00,912 --> 00:26:04,912
Grandpa had to steal the honey from the bees,

220
00:26:04,913 --> 00:26:08,013
and gave them cheap sugar to compensate.

221
00:26:08,014 --> 00:26:11,914
Like trading glass pearls for gold
with the native Americans 300 years ago.

222
00:26:11,915 --> 00:26:18,915
We even increased their honey yield
by breeding.

223
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:22,016
More yield, less bites.

224
00:26:22,017 --> 00:26:25,917
Breeding bees means controlling their queen.

225
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:33,918
She is the key figure.

226
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,919
The colony decides when they need a new queen.

227
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,020
Then they start building a special cell.

228
00:26:41,021 --> 00:26:45,921
Before the new princess hatches out,
the old queen leaves the hive with most of the bees,

229
00:26:45,922 --> 00:26:49,922
to leave the hive for the new generation.

230
00:26:49,923 --> 00:26:53,923
Starting with one colony, suddenly there are two colonies.

231
00:26:53,924 --> 00:26:56,924
Beekeepers control and manipulate this natural process.

232
00:26:56,925 --> 00:26:59,925
They take away the queen from the colony,

233
00:26:59,926 --> 00:27:05,926
forcing the colony to breed new queens.

234
00:27:15,027 --> 00:27:19,927
I put a fertilized egg into this cell.

235
00:27:19,928 --> 00:27:29,928
Three days later there will be a larva.

236
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:36,229
I put this larva here to the big cells.

237
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:52,930
Here the bees raise new queens, with special nectar.

238
00:27:52,931 --> 00:27:59,031
By marking the larva with a special royal jelly

239
00:27:59,032 --> 00:28:07,932
the bees decide to raise a new queen
instead of raising an ordinary working bee.

240
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:12,033
Now I but this special larva
to the nursing colony

241
00:28:12,034 --> 00:28:18,934
I want to get 51 new queens from you!

242
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:27,135
Please take good care of them,
my bees.

243
00:28:27,136 --> 00:28:31,036
The nursing colony is under stress,

244
00:28:31,037 --> 00:28:34,037
manipulated by the beekeeper.

245
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:37,138
Not having a queen yet,
not having any breed yet.

246
00:28:37,139 --> 00:28:40,039
The colony urgently need
a new queen,

247
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:46,940
Else the colony dies.

248
00:28:46,941 --> 00:28:50,041
Actually they just need one queen.

249
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:57,342
But in their misery they raise
all the 51 queens.

250
00:29:28,043 --> 00:29:32,943
The first queen to hatch out
would kill all the 50 others queens.

251
00:29:32,944 --> 00:29:37,944
One colony can only have one queen.

252
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:42,945
Therefore the developing queens
have to be harvested in time

253
00:29:42,946 --> 00:29:47,946
to be distributed and separated
each to a small colony to hatch out

254
00:29:47,947 --> 00:29:54,947
Here you can see a queen moving her legs.
She will hatch out in a few hours.

255
00:29:54,948 --> 00:30:01,448
So I put her here to this small
group of bees.

256
00:31:14,949 --> 00:31:19,949
After sex with the queen the drone dies.

257
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:24,950
Coming back from the maiden flight,
the queen has received five million sperms.

258
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:29,751
This will last for eight years.

259
00:31:33,052 --> 00:31:43,052
As soon as the queen starts laying eggs
we take her out. Now we can sell her.

260
00:31:43,053 --> 00:31:47,953
This is a permanent marker.

261
00:31:47,954 --> 00:31:51,954
Each year we use another colour.

262
00:31:51,955 --> 00:31:55,455
With the marker,
the queen can be found easily in the hive,

263
00:31:55,456 --> 00:32:00,956
and we can know how old she is.

264
00:32:00,957 --> 00:32:04,757
The queen will be send to any place
in the world.

265
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:07,858
We send her in this little box,
together with a few working bees.

266
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:11,059
They form a small colony already.

267
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,960
Now we apply a bit of smoke.

268
00:32:14,961 --> 00:32:18,061
The queen is still smelly from the marker,

269
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:21,062
therefore we use a bit of water, too.

270
00:32:21,063 --> 00:32:26,563
Now they clean each other,
and now they accept her as the new queen.

271
00:32:34,864 --> 00:32:40,364
So, that's another 60 Euro.
- Thank you.

272
00:33:05,065 --> 00:33:09,965
Singer queens are sold worldwide,

273
00:33:09,966 --> 00:33:15,566
either in a little box,
or else in a bigger box.

274
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:32,767
This one goes to Innsbruck.

275
00:33:32,768 --> 00:33:38,368
Should arrive by tomorrow.

276
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:24,669
European settlers brought the honey bee to the USA.

277
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:30,070
The settlers cultivated the land with
fruits and vegetables.

278
00:34:30,071 --> 00:34:36,171
Therefore they needed the bees.

279
00:34:36,172 --> 00:34:42,172
Continuously new breeds are being
imported to the USA.

280
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,469
I am a migrant beekeeper.

281
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,671
In practice this means we go where the bees
have the most opportunities to fly.

282
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,997
That takes us across America

283
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,354
In the course of a year we go from California,
where the almonds and the cherries begin the season

284
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,950
in early spring, in February.

285
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,912
We then go to Washington State
for apple, apricot and cherry pollination

286
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,551
in late March and April.

287
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,471
We move the entire outfit to North Dakota
for summer.

288
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,196
All the bees go for honey production in the summer.

289
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,554
By October first we begun to close the circle

290
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,389
moving the colonies back west before Winter.

291
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,592
So the course of a year is one big circle.

292
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,031
From California to North Dakota its 1700 miles.

293
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,790
We try to transport the bees in two days

294
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,911
and spend one night on the road.

295
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,868
The less time the bees spend on the truck
the healthier they will be.

296
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:05,513
The bees can't fly outside their hive when we are
trucking them and cannot go to the bathroom.

297
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:11,830
The longer they have to stay inside their box,
in all their dirt

298
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,196
the unhealthier they will be.
It's stressful.

299
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,160
It's not natural for the bees
to be on the truck.

300
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,354
The sooner we get them of the truck,
the better it's going to be.

301
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:14,055
The resting stops are short

302
00:38:14,056 --> 00:38:20,256
Without the wind from driving,
it's getting to hot inside the boxes.

303
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:54,957
On the big fields 1.5 million bee colonies
are mingling,

304
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:58,958
which is two third of all the bees of the States.

305
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:02,959
There they also transfer diseases and parasites
among each other.

306
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:14,960
Like this a disease can spread
around the country very fast.

307
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:18,961
Nosemo is an intestinal parasite
killing the bee from within.

308
00:39:18,962 --> 00:39:22,962
Wax maggots can destroy a hive.

309
00:39:22,963 --> 00:39:28,063
Another parasite kills larva.

310
00:39:28,064 --> 00:39:35,964
The most dangerous parasite of all is
a mite with the name Varroa destructor.

311
00:39:35,965 --> 00:39:39,965
This mite breeds inside the bee hive.

312
00:39:39,966 --> 00:39:44,066
Young mites attack the larva,
and even attack the bees.

313
00:39:44,067 --> 00:39:47,167
They can bite through the carapace of the bee,

314
00:39:47,168 --> 00:39:56,768
and suck their fluids.

315
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:01,969
Where they bite the bees, viral
infections can occur.

316
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:07,570
The bees will lose their wings.

317
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,469
There is very few bees here.
This is trouble.

318
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,399
So let's have a look.

319
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,319
There are no bees.

320
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,751
This is what we don't like.

321
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,633
Classic colony collapse disorder.

322
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,474
A queen ...

323
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,679
Twenty friends ...

324
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,153
and nothing else.

325
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,350
This is a total loss.
And we don't know why.

326
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,669
Just ...

327
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,994
just gone!

328
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,754
Plenty of pollen.

329
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,068
Plenty of nectar.

330
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,277
No evidence of brood.

331
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,198
I am getting real comfortable
with death on an epic scale.

332
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,399
I don't like it.

333
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,435
I doesn't burn and it doesn't sting
like it used to.

334
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,716
You know, it used to
"oh good it's like a death in the family".

335
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,518
And now it's just something we have
got to fix. It's just ...

336
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,196
You know, I got to fix it.

337
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,792
I don't have time to take it personally.
I know this hive didn't mean to die.

338
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:49,756
I don't know why it died.
But I can't fix it. I just got to move on.

339
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,035
I can't mourn the loss of this hive.
It's just part of the game.

340
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:02,316
We have got 365 out of 456.

341
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,116
456?
- 456 end up.

342
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,272
It's 20%.

343
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,709
That's our worst load.
- Yea, the worst so far.

344
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,391
But the ones that are here are ok.

345
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,111
Hopefully the next are better.

346
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,550
90 dugs.

347
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,875
I am backed into a corner.
And I fight back with what I have:

348
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,275
Chemicals.

349
00:44:13,676 --> 00:44:19,876
After the stressful journey the bees
are fed with sugar water.

350
00:44:19,877 --> 00:44:23,177
Mixed with antibiotics.

351
00:44:23,178 --> 00:44:33,678
Everywhere in Europe, North America and China
nowadays bees can't survive anymore without medicines.

352
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,979
Ok. Let's start the program.

353
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:11,280
This yellow neuron
not only tells the message "reward".

354
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:19,981
It also contains the information:
"it was good".

355
00:45:19,982 --> 00:45:26,082
There are other neuron responsible for
fear, or defence.

356
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:34,983
The 50'000 little brains are in a network together
forming a super organism.

357
00:45:34,984 --> 00:45:39,884
A huge family with 50'000 family members.

358
00:45:39,885 --> 00:45:45,985
Each family member carries out his duties.

359
00:45:45,986 --> 00:45:49,986
No one is in command. Everyone works.

360
00:45:49,987 --> 00:45:58,687
Even the larva form a part
of this information network.

361
00:46:07,788 --> 00:46:12,988
Each tentacle of the bees contains
about 60'000 aroma sensors.

362
00:46:12,989 --> 00:46:18,089
Sensing the aromas around, the bees know
everything what's going on in the hive.

363
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:24,990
Even their legs contain aroma sensors.

364
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:35,791
Like this they know everything like: "Where is the queen"
or "are there enough eggs" or "are there enough reserves".

365
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:39,992
Without a colony a single bee cannot survive.

366
00:46:39,993 --> 00:46:45,993
She gives up her individual freedom
for the wellbeing of the colony.

367
00:46:45,994 --> 00:46:54,294
Each day about 2000 bees die,
and about 2000 new-born bees hatch out.

368
00:47:07,995 --> 00:47:13,995
The interesting question is:
Is the colony a regulated system ?

369
00:47:24,096 --> 00:47:29,796
The answer is: yes, the colony as a whole
can have its own feelings

370
00:48:40,797 --> 00:48:44,897
When swarming one colony can duplicate into two colonies

371
00:48:44,898 --> 00:48:50,998
In industrial beekeeping this process is manipulated
to make four colonies out of one.

372
00:48:50,999 --> 00:48:54,599
Like this the beekeeper can compensate
the dead colonies.

373
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,355
Brood.

374
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,395
Honey.

375
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,635
Eggs.

376
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:07,279
Everybody needs somebody
that they can talk to.

377
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,879
Someone to open up their ears
and let that trouble through.

378
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,073
Now you don't have to sympathize
or care what they may do

379
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,311
But everybody needs somebody
that they can talk to

380
00:49:23,012 --> 00:49:26,012
Each colony gets split

381
00:49:26,013 --> 00:49:29,913
Brood, honey, and eggs get separated
to different boxes like spare parts.

382
00:49:29,914 --> 00:49:33,014
Mixed with other colonies.

383
00:49:33,015 --> 00:49:36,915
Most of the queens do not survive this process.

384
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:42,516
New queens are delivered by FEDEX.

385
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,115
Things have changed rapidly.
We don't keep bees the way my dad did.

386
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:59,234
My grandfather would probably
walk away from this property. Disturbed.

387
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,795
If he saw the way we keep bees today.

388
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,998
He'd think: "My God, you have lost your soul,

389
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,070
the husbandry of the hive and the care
and the compassion in the keeping of the hive."

390
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:15,115
He'd say we have sacrificed
our relationship with the colony.

391
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:20,394
But it was probably easier
to maintain that relationship with the hive.

392
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,478
He was probably running 1500 hives.

393
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,435
We are running ten times that.
We have 10x the employees,

394
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:32,794
we have 10x the property,
we have 10x of square foot of plants and equipment.

395
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,439
We have 10x the trucks, 10x the power, 10x the cost.

396
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:29,940
The colony with the black rural breed
made a new queen without the yellow tail.

397
00:51:29,941 --> 00:51:34,041
On her maiden flight
the queen did not leave the narrow valley

398
00:51:34,042 --> 00:51:40,842
So the colony is a true bred rural breed.

399
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,556
At first sight it looks ok.

400
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,155
But there is not much brood.

401
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,754
Oh no, Fred.

402
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,758
What do you see?

403
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,591
Doesn't look good.

404
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,397
Look here, that's typical, very extreme.

405
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,349
This is a typical foulbrood disease.

406
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,709
Let's hope it is the only one.

407
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,196
Unfortunately this colony is also ill.

408
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,672
I don't like what I see.

409
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,672
The bees did not clean the hive anymore.

410
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:34,272
It's a bad sign when the bees stop cleaning.
- Shit! Dammed!

411
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,196
Do you see it?

412
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,317
This colony is lost, Fred.

413
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:50,195
I can be smelled.
- Once you can smell it, it's very bad already.

414
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,672
Should we start using the sulphur gas already?

415
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:09,832
Where does foulbrood come from?
- It is a bacterial disease. Very contagious.

416
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,794
Maybe other drones brought it to the hive.

417
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,271
I feel very sorry for you.

418
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:33,072
We drive by car to the south,
to the province Shanxi.

419
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,912
The drive is 2000 km long.

420
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:44,516
It takes two days. Two drivers take turns.

421
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,032
It is really a long drive.

422
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,832
When arrived in the South,

423
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:03,669
we rent there a big storage room,
where we dry the pollen of the flowers.

424
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:09,670
When the apply bloom begins,
we buy the apple flowers from the farmers.

425
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:15,513
Then we start to process the flowers.

426
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,991
We also transport a fridge in our car.

427
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,918
Driving back North

428
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,318
we use local electricity for the fridge
when we make a rest.

429
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:33,357
With the fridge we keep the pollen fertile.

430
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:40,353
As soon the apple trees
start blooming here in the North,

431
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,916
we sell the pollen to the local farmers.

432
00:57:52,017 --> 00:57:56,017
Mao Tse Tung wanted
to get rid of all the sparrows.

433
00:57:56,018 --> 00:57:59,018
He said
the sparrows steal the crop from the people.

434
00:57:59,019 --> 00:58:02,019
Billions of sparrows were eliminated.

435
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,920
As a result there were
lots and lots of insects and bugs.

436
00:58:04,921 --> 00:58:08,021
The insects were then killed
using pesticides.

437
00:58:08,022 --> 00:58:13,122
Also the bees died.

438
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:31,038
Is 50 gram enough?
This year there was not so much pollen.

439
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,709
That's all I'm having now.

440
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,275
When I have sold them
I will contact you again.

441
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:41,236
I take 4 Yuan per gram,
you can sell it for 5 Yuan.

442
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,599
One package, 50 lots, please count.

443
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,995
You can give me the money,
when you have it.

444
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:01,917
For sure you can sell them easily.
- 15, 16, 17, ...

445
00:59:05,918 --> 00:59:09,918
Einstein said
when the bees die

446
00:59:09,919 --> 00:59:14,819
four years later also the humans die.

447
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:18,020
I travel in time to the future:

448
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:22,021
amazingly in China there are regions
without bees.

449
00:59:22,022 --> 00:59:27,422
Only reluctantly I am allowed to film.

450
01:00:22,023 --> 01:00:26,023
At a University in Beijing
people study the question

451
01:00:26,024 --> 01:00:32,924
who is the better pollinator?
Humans or bees.

452
01:00:32,925 --> 01:00:38,925
But the result of the researchers
is clear: bees are the better pollinators.

453
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,318
Here is what we have worked for
all summer long.

454
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,399
We see this abundance of honey.

455
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:12,351
Beautiful summer honey.

456
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,595
Off.

457
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:17,869
This is mine.

458
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,878
They don't like sharing too much.

459
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,397
My thought was, taste it.

460
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,513
Yea, that's good. That's real good,
that's straight out from the hive.

461
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:38,194
It's traumatic. It's hard on them.
They don't understand it.

462
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:42,959
'Cause they have been flying
in the fields for months undisturbed,

463
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:46,710
and now suddenly someone came
and put the smoke in their face,

464
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:51,238
and put the boxes off
strip their comb bars,

465
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,511
and handle them roughly,

466
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:59,079
and now the lids are back on them
and the hive is a lot smaller than it used to be.

467
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,980
In the three to four weeks of her life

468
01:03:25,981 --> 01:03:29,081
a bee can produce about one teaspoon of honey.

469
01:03:29,282 --> 01:03:34,982
For 1 kg of honey the total flying distance
of a bee is about 3x around the globe.

470
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:37,983
Any chemicals the bee filters out into
her own body.

471
01:03:37,984 --> 01:03:41,084
They sacrifice themselves for the offspring.

472
01:03:41,085 --> 01:03:43,985
The larva should only eat clean honey.

473
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:47,786
But there stay some leftovers of pesticides.

474
01:04:46,987 --> 01:04:51,987
To replace the bees here,
it would need many Chinese farmers.

475
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:58,988
For this abundance of almonds
four billions of bees had to work for 1 month.

476
01:04:58,989 --> 01:05:07,089
Even a vegetarian person is dependent on
industrialized beekeeping.

477
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:10,090
I am still searching a cause
for the worldwide dying of bees.

478
01:05:10,091 --> 01:05:19,991
In the bible there is written:
People, go to the world and be prosperous!

479
01:05:19,992 --> 01:05:23,992
There might lay the cause for
the problems of the bees.

480
01:05:23,993 --> 01:05:28,993
They don't die from just pesticides,
parasites, or antibiotics, incest or stress.

481
01:05:28,994 --> 01:05:33,994
It is the sum of all these problems,
which is too much for the bees.

482
01:05:33,995 --> 01:05:38,995
The bees are dying because of the
dominance of human civilization.

483
01:05:38,996 --> 01:05:44,996
Humans transformed wild bees into
harmless domesticated bees.

484
01:05:44,997 --> 01:05:51,697
But why the bees are putting up with it.
Don't they want to fight back?

485
01:06:17,998 --> 01:06:24,998
For this movie we travelled a lot.

486
01:06:25,099 --> 01:06:30,999
The narrator tells a story from
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

487
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:36,900
The Red Queen's race is an incident
where the Red Queen,

488
01:06:36,901 --> 01:06:43,001
and Alice constantly running
but remaining in the same spot.

489
01:06:43,002 --> 01:06:49,002
"Well, in our country," said Alice,
"you'd generally get to somewhere else

490
01:06:49,003 --> 01:06:55,103
if you run very fast for a long time,
as we've been doing."

491
01:06:55,104 --> 01:07:01,004
"A slow sort of country!"
said the Queen.

492
01:07:01,005 --> 01:07:10,105
"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running
you can do, to keep in the same place."

493
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:25,509
One of the first persons to come to the scene
the Lakeville fire fighter chief

494
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:30,191
couldn't figure out why there was a cloud
around the accident, while there was nothing on fire.

495
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:35,549
There was a black haze around the whole scene.
I have never seen quite anything like that.

496
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:40,119
He didn't know he drove
right into a swarm of bees

497
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,439
Stung in the face a few times

498
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,400
immediately he ordered
his crews to wear full gears for protection.

499
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,830
14 people have died in the US since 2004

500
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,277
after being attacked
by swarms of killer bees.

501
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:57,632
Killer bees first escaped from a
Brazilian breeding expert.

502
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,388
then migrated through Central America
and Mexico.

503
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:05,595
Along the way getting a deadly reputation
allegedly killing hundreds of people.

504
01:08:05,596 --> 01:08:09,996
Killer bees are a cross-breeding from
European and African bees.

505
01:08:09,997 --> 01:08:14,997
Their correct name is
Africanized honey bee.

506
01:08:14,998 --> 01:08:21,098
26 swarms could escape
from a laboratory in Sao Paolo.

507
01:08:21,099 --> 01:08:26,599
Is this the time where
the bees finally start fighting back?

508
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,268
I came to get your bees.

509
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,399
We have to take off the stuff here.

510
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,912
I will get a suit, right?
- Yea, you get a suit.

511
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,918
Fred, you are my friend!

512
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:53,673
In 1992 a local minister
called me to his home.

513
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,594
He said, I want you to get my bees,

514
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:03,319
because his neighbour had put in
an exercise ring for horses.

515
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:10,069
The bees on his property were stinging
the horses, and the people on the horses,

516
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:15,992
because the horses were making a lot
of noise and vibrating the earth,

517
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,953
and of course bees don't like that.

518
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:24,640
I went over dressed like this, with
no protection, just a short-sleeve shirt,

519
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:29,072
because I was used working
with the European bees,

520
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:32,272
and I thought this won't be a big problem.

521
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,152
I went over there, and of course it was a problem.

522
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:38,479
The bees were much more ferocious than
any bees I have ever seen previously.

523
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,110
I was not sure exactly what they were,

524
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:45,791
I thought, I just find the queens
and put in nice new queens,

525
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,753
because these bees were just too mean.

526
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,237
I put in a nice queen

527
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:57,594
and the bees killed her immediately,
and then raise their own queens.

528
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,035
It's always a good idea to pee first.

529
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,949
Before we get the bees excited.

530
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,834
So if you need to go, now it's the time.

531
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:12,390
No, I am pretty good.
- You are pretty good? - Yea, I think so.

532
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,032
Ready Fred?
- Ready!

533
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,952
Be careful.

534
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,279
A beautiful nest.

535
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:43,117
Perfect rows. Filled with cavities.

536
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,755
Rebo, these are your killer bees.

537
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,870
The honey flows.

538
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,639
This row is fresh.

539
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,992
The stuff further back are brood combs?
- Yea.

540
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,119
Look at it!

541
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,833
It's beautiful.

542
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,198
Looks good, even in the bucket.

543
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,951
You know, Rebo, when we lived in Tucson,
15 years ago,

544
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:17,319
it probably would have cost you
1000$, to take this out.

545
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,557
At that time I had parasitic mites.

546
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:28,473
So I thought, these really vicious hives,
I won't treat them with chemicals,

547
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,955
and so the mites will kill them.

548
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,511
The mites did not kill them.

549
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:39,399
These hives thrived with now treatment,

550
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:45,318
whereas my gently treated hives
did not do very well at all.

551
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:50,955
So I began to think,
maybe there is something to these bees.

552
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:55,028
At that time I was thinking,
maybe these bees were African bees.

553
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,356
I didn't tell anyone,

554
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:03,478
because I was afraid of
what might happen if I did.

555
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:10,791
It's a nice brood.
- Yea, in the yellow combs.

556
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,559
Where is our box?

557
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,876
Now I see, what the string is for.

558
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:21,397
That's what the bears
are getting the hive for.

559
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,797
Not looking for the honey,
but looking for the brood.

560
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,079
Here we go.

561
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,790
For your hive?
- Yea.

562
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,833
The queen will be somewhere here.

563
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,439
Lid on.

564
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,949
It's quite a bit heavier
than just the honey.

565
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,356
It's amazing how much
a few bees weigh.

566
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,835
Let's put it on the edge here.

567
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:03,716
I want to make sure ...
- You are looking on the bottom?

568
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,912
Are there any bees on the bottom?
- Not many.

569
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,679
I think we are in good shape.

570
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:37,155
All American are always
afraid of being invaded.

571
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:42,271
If not by illegal immigrants
then by killer bees.

572
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,233
I do have to wear a bee suit now.

573
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:43,435
I do have to have to work
my bees much more carefully.

574
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,351
But it's easily worth it. I do know
that they make more honey,

575
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,552
and they make honey that doesn't
have any chemicals in it.

576
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,197
That means an awful lot to me.

577
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,909
Looking good! Lots of drones.

578
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:12,194
The honey bees are not native in Australia.

579
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,675
They arrived with the first settlers.

580
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:19,954
And over time some of them escaped.
And they got established.

581
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:24,674
Honey bees can't survive
without human help.

582
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:29,397
This is different from Europe, China,
or North America.

583
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:40,436
If we collect males, that's what
is Rodolfo doing up there at the moment,

584
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:43,109
we can basically study the queen genes,

585
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,631
because the drones a clone variants
of the queen.

586
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:51,710
I always refer to our feral bees
in Australia as a big bank account,

587
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:57,275
with no money on it, but
genetic variations of genes.

588
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:02,915
With the work which we do here at the moment
we try to withdraw some of our assets,

589
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:06,471
and use them for future bee breeding.

590
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:11,312
Well done! Can we have a look.
- Yea.

591
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,991
Look at this. It's really nice.

592
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,193
They are very lively.

593
01:16:28,994 --> 01:16:31,994
My family still is interested in bees.

594
01:16:31,995 --> 01:16:36,995
Nowadays my nephews are fascinated by them.

595
01:16:36,996 --> 01:16:48,596
Will there still be bees around,
when they themselves are going to be grandfathers?

596
01:16:48,597 --> 01:16:55,997
My daughter and my son-in-law are studying bees
at the university of Western Australia in Perth.

597
01:16:55,998 --> 01:17:00,098
They are studying the immune system of bees.

598
01:17:00,099 --> 01:17:08,099
When I arrived, I had to burn my bee suit.
There might have been germs in it from my travels.

599
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:10,800
In Australia the last healthy bees
of the world are living.

600
01:17:10,801 --> 01:17:13,501
A continent without Varroa mites.

601
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:18,350
You can touch them. They are male drones.
They cannot bite.

602
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:24,514
Is this Mother bee?
- No, this is farther bee.

603
01:17:36,815 --> 01:17:45,015
Queens of honey bees are being artificially
cross-inseminated here with Australian wild feral bees.

604
01:17:45,016 --> 01:17:58,016
To avoid a risky incident like the one in Brazil,
the cross-breed bees are brought to a small island.

605
01:17:58,017 --> 01:18:02,017
There they will have to survive a stress test.

606
01:18:02,018 --> 01:18:05,018
If they survive there will be further breeding.

607
01:18:05,019 --> 01:18:08,919
For the world market.

608
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:17,920
If there will emerge new killer bees,
they can do no harm on this lonely island.

609
01:18:17,921 --> 01:18:22,021
On the other hand if all the mainland bees
die of diseases in future,

610
00:18:22,022 --> 01:18:28,622
these healthy bees on the lonely island
will be very useful for us humans.

611
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:35,550
We think the genetic diversity among
these island bees is crucial.

612
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:40,755
We should not try to concentrate on
one special breed only

613
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:45,158
and loose genetic diversity by this,

614
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:50,434
instead we try to bring in
new genes into this island bee population.

615
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,393
Killer bees certainly have a superior immunity system,

616
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:57,672
but they are as dangerous as wolves,
which is not acceptable.

617
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,997
We humans want to live together with the bee.

618
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:04,192
Thus we have to look for

619
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:08,473
a compromise between killer bees

620
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:12,878
and domesticated honey bees.

621
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:59,433
We seem to be afraid of foreigners
coming into the country,

622
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:02,678
even though we are all immigrants here.

623
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:07,392
The African bees came,
they didn't have papers

624
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:12,510
they didn't have permission,
nor visa nor passports.

625
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,679
There was nothing we could do
to stop theses wild creatures.

626
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:22,159
They have not been domesticated,
they are as they have always been.

627
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,836
And people were very frightened.

628
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:32,595
When I went to Brazil in 1995,

629
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:39,073
I found that the country had completely
embraced the African bee.

630
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,674
That what we have been told
about the African bee,

631
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:48,238
that they didn't make honey,
that they were not good pollinators,

632
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,750
that they were impossible to manage,

633
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:54,032
I found that all those things
were completely false.

634
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,993
They can survive on very scarce resources.

635
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,190
If I were a gambling person,

636
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:06,478
I would bet on the survival of the African bee
over just about any other species.

637
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:15,518
I think they will be here
after we are gone.

638
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:18,835
The bees that I took out from the roof
did not like their new nest

639
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,236
so they left, they swarmed.

640
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,679
They will find a limb on a tree
or something

641
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:34,112
where they can cluster
to take care of the queen.

642
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:39,714
From that cluster the bees will send out
scout bees to look for a suitable nest site.

643
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,513
If a scout bee finds a suitable nest site,

644
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:27,275
she will come back to this cluster of bees

645
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:31,269
and she will tell her nest mates
about her very good site.

646
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:41,309
When they reach a consensus

647
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,273
then they will all leave together.

648
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,830
Not even a bear could get to those bees.

649
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:09,830
