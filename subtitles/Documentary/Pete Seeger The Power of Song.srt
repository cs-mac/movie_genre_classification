when sex had to be violent.

3
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,356
I was desperate to feel something real,.

4
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,896
Nothing felt real.

5
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:40,545

of what it should be.

A dog walker.

127
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,582
I thought we could just roll and tumble.

128
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,525
Live from song to song.

141
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,083
How well do you know this guy?

142
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,088
And how come he's letting you
stay at his place?

143
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,618
You shouldn't trust him.

144
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,282
Why not?

145
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,863
I just think you should be careful.

146
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,777
Ladies and gentlemen...

147
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:38,809
He said, "Trust me."

148
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,551
- We should make a record together.
- And I did.

149
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,735
I know you do the live music thing
and everything else,

150
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,484
but don't you wanna make some money?

151
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,115
Whatever I wanted,
he'd make it happen.

152
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,651
You've got talent.

153
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:07,567
You want one of those?

154
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:09,906
You wanna be me?

155
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,910
Where do you get a jacket like this?

156
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,583
Makes you walk different.

157
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,148
Get you a hundred jackets like that.

158
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,590
How long you lived here?

159
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,152
About two weeks.

160
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,825
I don't like it.

161
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,626
It's all for sale.

162
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:30,492
All of it...

163
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,169
honors, titles.

164
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,035

165

166
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:53,813
Pool?

167
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,154
It's a stage show.

168
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,336
It's all just free fall.

169
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,324
You have too much pride.

170
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:39,936
I thought pride was a good thing.

171
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,202
People aren't proud enough.

172
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,504
Selfish!

173
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,568
Arrogant! Conceited!

174
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,707
If you know what's good for you,

175
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,910
you will stay as far away

176
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,213
from this man as you possibly can!

177
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,948
People changed around him.

178
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:03,716
They did things.

179
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,088
So did I.

180
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,792
He leaves us alone this way.

181
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,470
Because he wants to be free.

182
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,633
All his life, he's tried to get free.

183
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,739
He doesn't know how.

184
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,254
You aren't who you think you are.

185
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,911
He doesn't love you.

186
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,753
I like you this way.

187
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,296
I wanted to be free the way he was.

188
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,369
I went on seeing him.

189
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,674
I Let myself be smashed.

190
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,218
You can't?

191
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,058
Well, why can't you?

192
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,900
Do you trust me to stick
your finger in here?

193
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:55,994
He did everything.

194
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:00,906
He exhausted every poison.

195
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:08,917
He knew every form of love,
suffering, madness.

196
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:15,057
Learn all the rules when you're young,

197
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,093
'cause that makes Mom and Dad happy.

198
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,390
And then throw the fucking
lot of them out the window.

199
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,396
And they want you to!
They want you to!

200
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:25,162
So that he could reach the unknown.

201
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,007
He experimented.

202
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,716
They scare you with names.

203
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,884
Like wickedness.

204
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:04,072
You liked it; that I did what I liked.

205
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,715
I pulled you down in the car.

206
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,096
You realize that, um...

207
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:30,566
you know, it's like the sea.

208
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,623
Things come in and out.

209
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,261
We feel happy and ecstatic.

210
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,896
And then, you know, hours later,

211
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,407
you know, we feel
the deepest sorrows, or...

212
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,239
I didn't believe enough in love.

213
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,447
Afraid it would burn me up.

214
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,424
Be ready to suffer.

215
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,792
Don't be afraid.

216
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:01,798
I saw my husband.

217
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:04,460
I saw this boy across the room.

218
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,500
And I loved... I...

219
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,203
I just...

220
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:12,174
loved him the first moment I saw him.

221
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:13,870
And we had a life.

222
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,307
And it was beautiful,
and it was difficult.

223
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,845
And I thought I would be
with him for the rest of my life.

224
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:23,812
But he died.

225
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:53,212
I wanted to escape from every tie.

226
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:56,513
Every hold.

227
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,751
To have fife at any price.

228
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,220
Not to settle.

229
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:09,721
To go up...

230
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:12,657

231
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:17,095

How long have you known Faye?

00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,123
She's a receptionist for me.

How long?

260
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:39,266
I guess she came to work for me...

261
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,325
when she was 17.

262

16, maybe.

- No.

Yes.

- I have a condition.
- Yes'?

292
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:24,244
Uh, I can't be left alone...

293
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,253
for more than five minutes.

294
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,089
Can I get you something else?

295
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:31,060
I'd like to hear you sing.

296
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,262
- Okay, I gotta...
- Elephant...

297
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,265
- I gotta check another table.
- Why'? Why?

298
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,932
- 'Cause my boss is watching.
- Which other table?

299
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,934
- You're gonna get me fired.
- Yep, that's the plan.

300
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:40,959
You...

301
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,732
What do you like to do'?

302
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:44,930
Well...

303
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:50,004
I was a teacher, but there's
not many jobs around here.

304
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:51,739
- What do you teach?
- Kindergarten.

305
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,803
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

306
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:55,340
You like kids?

307
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,246
Yes, I do. It wouldn't be a very good job

308
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,983
- if I didn't like kids, would it'?
- No.

309
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,596
So you like physical things?

310
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:08,920
Yes.

311
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:26,137
I was shy.

312
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:46,798
This concert.

313
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,235
Who's on first?

314
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,567
This concert! It's insane.

315
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:54,542
No, I said, I do a better Mick Jagger
than I do Iggy Pop.

316
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:55,475
'Okay!
'Okay?

317
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:56,535
I misunderstood.

318
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:58,706
I don't know
how I didn't hear you.

319
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,214
You don't listen to me.

320
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,606
I'll listen to everything.

321
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,352
The record companies would sort of...

322
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,157
They did... they believed in artistry...

323
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:16,756
It's something they put in a
film to tweak the heartstrings

324
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:19,233
or to raise the adrenaline, you know.

325
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:20,860
Desperate to fuckin'...

326
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,832
drain the fuckin' chord and go, "Waah!"

327
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,170
And, "Fuck me!"

328
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:30,445
"Gimme!"
- Yeah.

329
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,742
You know, uh, "Love me."

330
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:34,009
You know, these things.

331
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,848
Lived very near Claridge's, and, uh...

332
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,046
- Nice. Swanky.
- The latest.

333
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,180
I lived on Upper Brook Street,
and I had...

334
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,795
After Dad left...

335
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,796
you thought you were a failure.

336
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,293
Mama...

337
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:59,107
you gave us so much.

338
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,314
Your hands are so beautiful.
You should be wearing gloves.

339
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,809
I wanted you
to have so much more.

340
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,547
I don't know where else we can go.

341
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,649
Remember, we have nothing.

342
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,290
Well, you need money for a lawyer.

343
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,221
The law's no help
for people who are ruined.

♪ Ahh ♪

345

You do?

350
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,117
Were you ever a cheerleader?

351
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,050
Scare me. Come closer.

Marry me.

No.

354
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,401
You gave Mother a new house.

355
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,505
You said I could get out
whenever I wanted,

356
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,078
keep all you'd given us.

357
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,345
You wanted me to be free.

358
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:46,929
Why do I owe you a Coke?

359
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,593
You said I couldn't climb the tree.

360
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,274
Don't have to.
What're you gonna do?

361
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:54,470
You're all the way up there.

362
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,975
How strong do you think you are?

363
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,819
One, two, three, go.

364
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,182
To the tree. Don't! You're running.
You're running. You're running.

365
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:16,626
I went along
like someone in a dream.

366
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,072
I knew I had to tell you.

367
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,013
Come clean.

368
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,197
I didn't know how.

369
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:13,686
Hove you, Hove you, Hove you...

370
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,452
Say it like you mean it.

371
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:17,583
Say it like you mean it.

372
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:20,561
Say it like you mean it.

Say it like you mean...

00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:34,968
Do you lie to me?

377
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,108
I know you always wanna
know the truth, but...

378
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,206
but I don't.

379
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,416
Sometimes the truth
isn't the right thing to say.

380
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:50,324
- Mm-hmm.
- You can hurt someone more

381
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:51,415
' Saying it.

382

385
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:14,678
"The life you live again.
Happy birthday.“

386
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,615
Do you ever think about leaving here?

387
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:25,183
I don't know.

388
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:30,459
Are you a good liar?

389
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:37,362
Do you love me?

390
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:40,277
Why do you ask that?

391
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:42,871
I like to hear it.

392
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:44,704
You don't like to say it.

393
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:46,838
I love you.

394
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:50,510
I'm so scared sometimes.

395
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,286
We're Wanderers, you and I.

396
00:41:58,549 --> 00:41:59,994
Like birds.

397
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:04,126
So you're saying
you wanna produce it as well.

398
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,465
So I'm suddenly feeling
a little bit out in the cold here.

399
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,005
- You know what I'm saying?
- Well, you wanna help produce it'?

400
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:12,936
I just feel like you're...

401
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:15,136
you're going ahead
on this thing by yourself.

402
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,645
Well, just look at the facts.
Take it out of your hands.

403
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,807
Why do you think it
can't work as a country song?

404
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:20,747
- It can.
- Maybe you...

405
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,511
As a... as a country...

406
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:24,785
Take your finger outta your ear.
Put it back up your ass.

407
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:26,489
You think you're better
than me, don't you?

408
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:28,883
You look down on me.

409
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:31,692
I gave you everything, man.

410
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,460
You sit on your high horse
looking down on me.

411
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:36,055
Look at your fingernails, man.
Where's the dirt?

412
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:41,032
You think you can get here
without getting your hands dirty at least?

413
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:46,835
Look at my batting average.

414
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,043
Look at it. Look at yours.

415
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,413
Who's helping who here?

416
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,855
I wrote those songs.

417
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,248
I did the work.

418
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:07,423
How many people do you think
in this city alone are writing songs?

419
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:08,360
Huh?

420
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,796
Think your songs are that good?

421
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:11,730
Yeah, what is it, morals...

422
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,735
Taking credit for someone else's work.

423
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,065
I told you about that shit.

424
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,702
50-50. Equals.

425
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:19,968
Brothers.

426
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:26,780
- Get outta here.
- Come on.

427
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:28,711
- You got a weird way of showing it.
- Come on.

428
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,480
- What'?
- We partners? Are we brothers?

429
00:43:30,575 --> 00:43:32,486
Why'd you put the copyrights to my songs

430
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:34,318
in your name and your name only?

431
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,060
Or did you think I didn't know about that?

432
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,561
No, maybe you thought,
"This guy's so stup..."

433
00:43:40,585 --> 00:43:42,724
Don't put your hands on...
Don't put your hands on me.

434
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:44,461
Don't put your hands on me.

435
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:46,964
Maybe you thought, "This guy's so stupid,

436
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:48,298
he doesn't want a lawyer,

437
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:49,462
he trusted me."

438
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,408
Should we make a scene? Huh?

439
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,683
I'll give you a record contract.

440
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,497
How's that make you feel?

441
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,343
That's what you want, right?

442
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,818
I love the pain.

443
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:44,358
It feels like life,.

444
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:54,631
Sometimes I admire what a hypocrite I am.

445
00:44:56,227 --> 00:44:57,227
On!

446
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:02,374
Strange what you get used to.

447
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:13,076
You're skinny.

448
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,721
You ever think
about coming home?

449
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:19,559
Okay.

450
00:45:21,152 --> 00:45:22,358
Feel like I just got out.

451
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,090
Place felt like it was on fire.

452
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,562
Come and help put it out.

453
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,394
- I did my best.
- Did you?

454
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:32,735
You sound like Dad.

455
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,568
It's hard at home with Mom.

456
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:39,102
'Cause...

457
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:40,910
you don't wanna be there.

458
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,749
I just feel like I keep...

459
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:47,884
sinking lower, and lower, and lower...

460
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:51,382
I think I'm just tired.

461
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:53,730
I wanted all that pain
to be for something.

462
00:45:54,352 --> 00:45:55,352
I'm okay.

463
00:45:56,187 --> 00:45:58,394
Ma, you're healthy, right?

464
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,425
You're a stone cold fox.

465
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,005
Turn it into something.

you got it in the bag.

I don't think that... I don't think
that takes care of everything, darling.

Have you seen your father?

469
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:17,317
- Have I seen him?
- Mm-hmm.

470
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:18,409
No.

471

No, I don't.

00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,987
Why not? I mean,
this is... that's a good...

502
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:12,996
That's a good opportunity for you.

503
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:18,232
I mean, you know how I feel
about him, but that...

504
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,601
that shouldn't affect your...

505
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:27,044
that shouldn't affect you.

506
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:42,085
You gotta do it.

507
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:20,758
Why are you crying?

508
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:28,003
Because I'm happy.

509
00:50:14,545 --> 00:50:15,705
Your old girlfriend...

510
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:18,888
she asked you to go off with her.

511
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:26,301
Why didn't you?

512
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:31,064
Was it for me?

513
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,198
Do you ever
think of me when I'm not here?

514
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:37,411
- Sure.
- Well, what do you think?

515
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:44,251
Why wake up next to someone
you don't even know

516
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,252
if you don't even know yourself anymore?

517
00:50:48,012 --> 00:50:50,754
What happens then?
Do you think she'll be happy...

518
00:50:52,016 --> 00:50:54,326
living with ghosts, sadder?

519
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,922
- It's more complicated than that.
- No, it's not.

520
00:51:00,024 --> 00:51:01,935
What's it feel like to be a girl?

521
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:03,664
Like I have special powers.

522
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,535
What don't I know?

523
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:18,546
How to feel.

524
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,754
How to be sick to your bones.

525
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,356
How to yearn.

526
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:34,629
Stay.

527
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:38,637
You're casting spells.

528
00:51:40,064 --> 00:51:41,064
Does it work?

529
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:43,302
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah'?

530
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:47,656
I don't even think
you know you're doing it.

531
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:49,138
I may.

532
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:51,685

I dream about it and stuff, and...

00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,032

I could follow you around.

You'd give it all up?

554
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,219
I would.

555
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:10,660
If you'd ask me.

556
00:53:13,991 --> 00:53:15,334

You know?

565
00:53:57,935 --> 00:53:59,380
Can you have, uh... you think...

566
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:01,839
have it all?

567
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:06,711
That's one thing I know.
You can't have it all.

568
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,519
- You gonna miss me?

569
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:13,593
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

570

Are you gonna miss me?

571
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,538
Do you want me to stay?

572
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:32,479
I can't ask you that.

573
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:41,720
Well, then I gotta go.

574
00:54:58,495 --> 00:54:59,803
Foolish me.

575
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:07,642
Devil.

576
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:14,686
I need to talk to you.

577
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:18,418
I know.

578
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:33,968
I love him.

579
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:36,603
Of course you do.

580
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:46,543
Say it again.

581
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:48,549
Say what again?

582
00:55:59,156 --> 00:56:00,863
I don't wanna do this anymore.

583
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:22,551
I want out.

584
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:26,884

00:57:24,241 --> 00:57:25,720

How long have you known?

602
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,852
I don't know, um...

603
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:45,298
I was a receptionist there
before I met you.

604
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:48,864
You know, I...

605
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,960
He's after you.

606
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:52,906
I dreamed of having him help me
the same way he helped you.

607
00:58:58,135 --> 00:58:59,637
You don't have to, uh...

608
00:59:04,174 --> 00:59:05,676
you know, hide anything.

609
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:13,760
We don't have to have
any secrets between us.

610
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:30,573
Why is he after you
if he's not attracted to you?

611
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:54,201
Did you ever sleep with him?

612
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:09,940
Yes.

613
01:00:15,879 --> 01:00:16,880
You did?

614
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:22,218
Once.

615
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:26,433
How come you never told me?

616
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:40,179
Tell me about the teacher.

617
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:47,080
Just tell me.

618
01:00:48,678 --> 01:00:50,988
- Tell me what you did.
- I don't remember.

619
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:52,253
Try and remember.

620
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,683
- I can't
- Try and remember.

621
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:57,028
It was dark. I don't know.

622
01:00:57,687 --> 01:00:59,132
He told us what to do.

623
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:01,758
Did you do it?

624
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:03,434
Yes.

625
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,200
You did what he told you to do?

626
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:27,859
I wanna live a good life.

627
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:36,800
Hmm? How many times?

628
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:42,866
We had...

629
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:45,374
a sort of a romance, I guess.

630
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:50,478
No, it was more than once.
It was several times.

631
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:55,687
Why'd you just do that?

632
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:00,150
Do what?

633
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,722
Change your story.

634
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:06,098
I was trying it out to see how you'd do.

635
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:18,301
I'm a beast.

636
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,402
Still not unhappy about it.

637
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:36,354
I don't seem to bring people
happiness anymore.

638
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,599
I wasted your love.

639
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:13,889
I was wrong.

640
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:20,899
Will you forgive me?

641
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:29,669
We broke up.

642
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,186
I tried to be kind.

643
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:45,884
It only made me colder.

644
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:34,271
What part of me do you want?

645
01:05:38,368 --> 01:05:40,279
Take what you want from me.

646
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:50,747
Let me untie them.

647
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:55,828
Untie mine.

648
01:06:11,835 --> 01:06:14,509
In our state
and even across our border.

649
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:31,322
We would express that generosity

650
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:34,630
not just in this moment or on this campus,

651
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:37,103
but as we have opportunity every day

652
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,162
throughout our community and our city,

653
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:42,141
around our state, even across our borders.

654
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:45,509
And we will be known as a generous people.

655
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:48,708
And we bless even as we have been blessed.

656
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:51,718
For we ask this in Your Son's name.

657
01:06:51,808 --> 01:06:52,808
Amen.

658
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:23,713
Gives you life.

659
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:29,178
Eat it.

660
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:32,988
I've tasted it.

661
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:35,251
Tried it.

662
01:07:43,326 --> 01:07:44,999
This is dipped in God.

663
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:05,120
They've never been where we've been.

664
01:08:20,797 --> 01:08:22,208
Open your eyes.

665
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:30,740
Right here you know.

666
01:08:32,976 --> 01:08:34,478
You won't die.

667
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:50,766
Here I reign.

668
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:55,298
Kins?'

669
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:09,851
Who sees us?

670
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,497
The world wants to be deceived.

671
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:40,875
Think you'll be able to drive?

672
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,886
- Taking that as a no.
- Our friend will pick us up.

673
01:09:44,981 --> 01:09:46,324
All right. You need to move on.

674
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,385
We have a little fun right here.

675
01:09:49,052 --> 01:09:51,830
Quite frankly, I don't know if you're
gonna come back. Careful with that.

676
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,299
You know that river?

677
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:55,029
This is a ticket around the world.

678
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:56,324
Last call...

679
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:07,243
Now leaving on track twelve.

680
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:08,971
Board!

681
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:11,917
Whoa!

682
01:10:26,022 --> 01:10:27,222
What are you afraid of?

683
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:36,871
What do you wanna do'?

684
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:54,854
Are you afraid of me?

685
01:11:06,796 --> 01:11:08,707
I was once like you.

686
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:15,042
I didn't know what I know now,.

687
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:35,603
To think what I once was...

688
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:40,835
what I am now.

689
01:11:50,106 --> 01:11:51,642
- Ls this your dog?
- Yeah.

690
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:53,243
- Can I say hi?
- Yeah, of course.

691
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:55,982
- Hi there.
- Say hello.

692
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:57,445
What's your name?

693
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:00,348
Look at you.

694
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:01,918
Stuff like that.

695
01:12:03,286 --> 01:12:04,321
You what? What?

696
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:07,299
- Like, uh, uh, house-sit.
- House-sit? Oh.

697
01:12:18,134 --> 01:12:19,135
Hi.

698
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:22,056
Very tired with the weather.

699
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:24,381
So I decided to move here.

700
01:12:25,775 --> 01:12:28,381
I don't know if I would
move here from Paris.

701
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,785
I wanted to experience it.

702
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:36,058
Just let me know when I can
come over and take him out or...

703
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:39,164
- Anything. If you need me to feed him.
- Tomorrow... if fine?

704
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,068
- Where are you from?
- From here.

705
01:12:41,891 --> 01:12:44,167
Yeah, it's like the, um...

706
01:12:44,227 --> 01:12:47,140
the skin, I like this idea of, um...

707
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,574
you know, losing your... your-your skin.

708
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:51,804
- And, like, the phoenix.
- Yeah.

709
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:52,869
You know, like...

710
01:12:53,636 --> 01:12:55,912
- Starting over'?
- Start... starting over.

711
01:12:56,005 --> 01:12:58,042
Dying and being reborn...

712
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:00,182
The light is so beautiful on your face.

713
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:04,657
You have one part of your face
in the shadows

714
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:06,853
and one part in the light.

715
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:55,766
- Are you scared?
- Mm-mm.

716
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:17,626
You kissed me in public.

717
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,827
You held my hand.

718
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:40,201
Stay.

719
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:59,065
Volunteer their time to make it so.

720
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:02,058
The very traditions
of the Bachelors of Austin

721
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:04,069
are the result of years of service

722
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,597
by dedicated individuals

723
01:16:06,695 --> 01:16:08,936
and a solid and loyal membership.

724
01:16:09,532 --> 01:16:13,605
This year, to help us usher in
and host a great social season,

725
01:16:14,537 --> 01:16:16,847
I would especially like
to thank Layne Cricket

726
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:18,715
and his wife Susan for serving.-...

727
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:20,378
You get used to drifting.

728
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:23,712
Waiting.

729
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:32,532
They say follow the light.

730
01:16:32,955 --> 01:16:34,901
So happy to meet you.

731
01:16:40,463 --> 01:16:41,806
Where do you find it?

732
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:48,274
When you're young, it's not always
easy to know what is the light.

733
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:49,948
- I don't understand either.
- Except for you.

734
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:51,383
- It's different.
- Sweet of you to say.

735
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:55,913
I hear you have songs on the radio
and you're meant for better things.

736
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:59,448
It'd be awful to have these
good times and not have life itself.

737
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:01,494
I wanna meet you before you move on

738
01:17:01,584 --> 01:17:03,424
- and leave us behind.
- Mm-hmm. No, thank you.

739
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:06,566
Uh, she was mixed up with a guy back East.

740
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,465
He was a very nice man, I understand.

741
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:10,969
Divorced, four kids, but...

742
01:17:20,603 --> 01:17:21,946
I heard you just moved here.

743
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:25,112
Yeah, I've been back a couple of months.

744
01:17:27,176 --> 01:17:28,348
Mind me asking why?

745
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:30,312
I was, uh, wondering.

746
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:33,118
I grew up there.

747
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:34,984
Oh, yeah?

748
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:39,532
No, I went... I went away to school.

749
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:41,123
Back East.

750
01:17:46,929 --> 01:17:49,136
I think you've got a secret
you're not telling me.

751
01:18:00,776 --> 01:18:02,119
What is that?

752
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:03,178
It's a chicken.

753
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:07,016
Hold on, you gotta...

754
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:13,458

They make it cheap,.

879
01:28:47,856 --> 01:28:49,961
I revolted against goodness.

880
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:57,305
Thought it had deceived me.

881
01:28:57,365 --> 01:28:58,469
Careful, Matthew.

882
01:29:01,269 --> 01:29:03,044
Thought!
Could do better than others.

883
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:11,216
Didn't need what made life sweet for them.

884
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:20,322
Look at me.

885
01:29:28,129 --> 01:29:29,130
I'm sor...

886
01:29:32,801 --> 01:29:35,179
I'm sorry that you're not
as proud of me...

887
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:37,204
as you are...

888
01:29:37,839 --> 01:29:39,341
with my sisters.

889
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:41,650
I'm not who I thought I was.

890
01:29:45,814 --> 01:29:47,225
Am I a good person?

891
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:50,556
You made so many...

892
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:54,330
so many sacrifices for me.

893
01:29:55,757 --> 01:29:58,738
So that I could have a chance
to do the things that you couldn't do...

894
01:29:58,827 --> 01:30:00,033
Even want to be?

895
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:03,239
And I failed you.

896
01:30:03,331 --> 01:30:04,833

01:30:05,767 --> 01:30:07,269

I guess not.

922
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:15,813
- Is this a joke?
- She's kidding, ma.

923
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:17,339
- Oh.
- Oh, it was a joke.

924
01:31:19,007 --> 01:31:20,008
Not very funny.

925

Cheers.

Excuse me for a second.

You're unhappy-

928
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:49,971
I can see it.

929
01:31:50,772 --> 01:31:51,842
Sorry about that.

930
01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:15,463
What'd you do?

931
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:18,477
She's the wrong person for you.

932
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:19,534
I'm sorry?

933
01:32:20,502 --> 01:32:21,503
It's wrong.

934
01:32:22,804 --> 01:32:25,546
Come on, honey. It's okay.

935
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:27,381
I don't understand it, but...

936
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:38,193
- Can I walk with you?
- No.

937
01:32:40,255 --> 01:32:41,859
I don't know how to change.

938
01:32:43,525 --> 01:32:44,526
I want to,.

939
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:47,562
How do you?

940
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:50,068
Will you take me somewhere?

941
01:32:50,665 --> 01:32:51,905
How do you get better?

942
01:32:58,373 --> 01:33:00,080
Gotta sacrifice something.

943
01:33:04,279 --> 01:33:06,384
How do you know
when you're lying to yourself?

944
01:33:18,393 --> 01:33:19,993
When you give somebody your word...

945
01:33:22,964 --> 01:33:24,307
does it mean anything?

946
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:26,477
You can just take it back,.

947
01:33:40,949 --> 01:33:42,826
I told her that Fm gonna do my best.

948
01:33:43,918 --> 01:33:46,125
Do my best not to say things I don't mean.

949
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:26,469
The world built
a fence around you.

950
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:32,543
How do you get through?

951
01:34:37,038 --> 01:34:38,039
Connect?

952
01:34:47,782 --> 01:34:49,284
There's something else.

953
01:34:54,289 --> 01:34:56,394
Something that wants us to find it,.

954
01:35:15,977 --> 01:35:17,684
You're the part
that I don't know...

955
01:35:19,314 --> 01:35:20,987
that you don't know yourself.

956
01:35:31,025 --> 01:35:32,436
I swear.

957
01:35:35,096 --> 01:35:36,674
How long have
you been doing this?

958
01:35:36,698 --> 01:35:38,905
My dream was to be a teacher,

959
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,344
but this is kind of something I just...

960
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:43,746
I fell into after my fiancé passed.

961
01:35:43,838 --> 01:35:45,511
In memory for him, but...

962
01:35:46,241 --> 01:35:51,247
like, this is not something
that people just choose to do,

963
01:35:51,346 --> 01:35:54,054
so I'm trying... this is just
a means to an end for me.

964
01:35:54,115 --> 01:35:56,396
It was
so much better when he was around.

965
01:35:57,452 --> 01:35:59,591
But, you know...

966
01:36:00,888 --> 01:36:02,390
God has a plan, and...

967
01:36:02,457 --> 01:36:04,903
and I guess this is part of his plan.

968
01:36:04,959 --> 01:36:07,906
You know, Shawn being gone
and me being in this situation

969
01:36:07,962 --> 01:36:10,806
where I have no choice
but to do what I do, so...

970
01:36:11,532 --> 01:36:15,605
Eventually, maybe he'll hear
my prayers and I'll be able to...

971
01:36:15,703 --> 01:36:17,649
you know, move forward and do something...

972
01:36:18,906 --> 01:36:19,816
valued with my life.

973
01:36:19,907 --> 01:36:21,909
Something my dad
can be proud of, you know.

974
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:25,086
Make the money.
Don't let the money make you.

975
01:36:26,214 --> 01:36:27,420
Create the illusion,

976
01:36:27,982 --> 01:36:30,553
but don't let yourself
believe that illusion.

977
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:32,256
Only make him believe it.

978
01:36:34,489 --> 01:36:36,298
Don't let yourself get caught up in it.

979
01:36:39,494 --> 01:36:41,565
I sell a fantasy, not my body.

980
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:43,131
I sell an illusion.

981
01:36:43,231 --> 01:36:45,404
I sell, you know...

982
01:36:46,567 --> 01:36:48,444
a daydream to these guys.

983
01:36:48,903 --> 01:36:54,319
And I try to keep the cookie jar closed.

984
01:36:54,409 --> 01:36:55,410
Is that me?

985
01:36:59,614 --> 01:37:02,117
The cookie jar closed.

986
01:37:08,489 --> 01:37:09,490
You burn me.

987
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:16,973
Who are you?

988
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:24,513
I can't take this world straight.

989
01:37:44,826 --> 01:37:46,703
Big candy store out there.

990
01:37:47,462 --> 01:37:50,207
- I think I get a little insecure
- What do you like to drink?

991
01:37:50,231 --> 01:37:52,209
And... you know,
I just... I look for comfort...

992
01:37:52,233 --> 01:37:53,877
- in places I shouldn't.
- You like to get high?

993
01:37:53,901 --> 01:37:54,743
I don't know...

994
01:37:54,836 --> 01:37:55,836
It's kind of...

995
01:37:56,471 --> 01:37:57,472
I'm weird,.

996
01:37:57,538 --> 01:37:59,538
- I'm just...
- What's your fantasy?

997
01:38:02,477 --> 01:38:03,478
What turns you on?

998
01:38:04,979 --> 01:38:06,856
I think just
being wanted turns me on.

999
01:38:07,515 --> 01:38:08,755
Tell me what scares you.

1000
01:38:10,585 --> 01:38:12,064
I'm really scared of spiders.

1001
01:38:13,388 --> 01:38:15,834
Um, but most things don't scare me.

1002
01:38:16,924 --> 01:38:18,528
I think I have a thick skin.

1003
01:38:18,593 --> 01:38:19,936
I think I'm pretty strong.

1004
01:38:27,201 --> 01:38:28,942
No, but what really scares you?

1005
01:38:31,372 --> 01:38:32,680
I don't know my family.

1006
01:38:36,511 --> 01:38:38,184
No one's ever been there for me but me,.

1007
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:40,089
You like those girls, don't you?

1008
01:38:49,791 --> 01:38:51,099
They know what you are.

1009
01:39:01,402 --> 01:39:02,642
When I was a girl,

1010
01:39:04,539 --> 01:39:06,041
I loved everyone.

1011
01:39:13,648 --> 01:39:15,093
You killed my love.

1012
01:39:41,909 --> 01:39:43,252
What did I say?

1013
01:39:47,014 --> 01:39:48,015
Do?

1014
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:55,497
Mom, I'm afraid of myself.

1015
01:40:01,295 --> 01:40:02,638
A hatred in me.

1016
01:40:10,438 --> 01:40:12,440
Everything I could do to get free...

1017
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,383
goes through my mind.

1018
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:20,152
Makes me evil.

1019
01:40:20,548 --> 01:40:22,653
I used to think I could never be wicked,.

1020
01:40:23,518 --> 01:40:24,792
Wicked before.

1021
01:40:26,153 --> 01:40:27,655
A long way out for me.

1022
01:40:27,722 --> 01:40:29,998
So much to seek to be consoled

1023
01:40:30,057 --> 01:40:31,297
as to understand,

1024
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:33,965
to be loved as to love.

1025
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:37,066
For it is in giving that we receive.

1026
01:40:37,164 --> 01:40:38,164
It is in pardoning...

1027
01:40:38,666 --> 01:40:40,202
Bang.
Bang.

1028
01:40:40,301 --> 01:40:42,372
Bang, may the blessings
of all those that you love

1029
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:43,505
and those who love you...

1030
01:41:40,194 --> 01:41:41,195
Mama.

1031
01:41:44,398 --> 01:41:45,570
Where am I now?

1032
01:41:49,604 --> 01:41:50,947
Where are we?

1033
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:12,168
I knew how destroyed... I was.

1034
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:37,985
Forgive me.

1035
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:54,771
In that time, did she have

1036
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:57,145
any medical history or medication?

1037
01:43:01,375 --> 01:43:04,015
About her mental health issues?

1038
01:43:04,111 --> 01:43:07,786
Had she ever had any Bang.

1039
01:43:07,848 --> 01:43:10,488
Or expressed any depression to you?

1040
01:45:58,853 --> 01:46:00,389
You got food all over you.

1041
01:46:34,889 --> 01:46:36,689
I just wanted to come...

1042
01:46:37,725 --> 01:46:39,500
come and sit next to you.

1043
01:46:48,669 --> 01:46:52,412
Things turned out a little different
than we thought they would, didn't they?

1044
01:47:06,287 --> 01:47:07,698
They like carrots and apples.

1045
01:47:07,755 --> 01:47:09,701
Every now and then,
I'll bring them one, but...

1046
01:47:10,291 --> 01:47:11,531
They're spoiled now.

1047
01:47:16,030 --> 01:47:20,536
These old guitars seem to have
a song ready-made for you.

1048
01:47:20,601 --> 01:47:22,205
They always have old songs...

1049
01:47:24,038 --> 01:47:26,644
loan... I can go on
for hours with one chord.

1050
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:38,092
It's just one chord hammering.

1051
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:46,635
♪ Glory of a good man ♪

1052
01:47:46,727 --> 01:47:50,800
♪ Come on and they carry him home... ♪

1053
01:47:54,268 --> 01:47:55,338
Can you see?

1054
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:59,076
Yeah, she has a face... a face like yours.

1055
01:48:17,591 --> 01:48:20,511
I do... f don't know... I didn't know
why I was coming to this party.

1056
01:48:20,995 --> 01:48:22,975
Then I saw you,
and I thought, "That's why."

1057
01:48:26,033 --> 01:48:27,205
You got a boyfriend?

1058
01:48:29,136 --> 01:48:30,206
No.

1059
01:48:31,972 --> 01:48:34,145
I don't think so. Did we meet before?

1060
01:48:36,977 --> 01:48:38,513
- Did we?
- I've seen you before.

1061
01:48:38,612 --> 01:48:40,888
- Where?
- Lots of times.

1062
01:48:41,815 --> 01:48:44,455
But I mean, I'm...
I'm not doing anything wrong, am I?

1063
01:48:46,053 --> 01:48:48,124
- By talking to you?
- No.

1064
01:48:49,823 --> 01:48:51,166
There's something on your face.

1065
01:48:53,394 --> 01:48:54,532
Did you get it?

1066
01:48:54,628 --> 01:48:55,629
- Huh?
- Did you get it?

1067
01:48:55,696 --> 01:48:56,697
Mm-mm.

1068
01:48:57,398 --> 01:48:58,399
Gotta come closer.

1069
01:49:03,704 --> 01:49:04,704
I got it.

1070
01:49:04,738 --> 01:49:05,842
Thank you.

1071
01:49:12,246 --> 01:49:13,247
Here we go.

1072
01:49:13,347 --> 01:49:14,947
- Okay, start from the beginning.
- Okay.

1073
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:18,161
Does it start right there,
or does it have an intro'?

1074
01:49:18,185 --> 01:49:19,185
Do you want it to...?

1075
01:49:24,858 --> 01:49:25,996
But slower.

1076
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:27,368
It's a love story.

1077
01:50:17,945 --> 01:50:19,219
Excuse... excuse me.

1078
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:24,551
Hey.

1079
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:26,619
Hi.

1080
01:50:27,254 --> 01:50:28,494
Is this happening?

1081
01:50:29,223 --> 01:50:31,760
Who was that girl
I saw you with at the hotel?

1082
01:50:38,165 --> 01:50:39,166
Just a girl.

1083
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:41,301
A woman.

1084
01:50:43,637 --> 01:50:44,911
Why you smiling?

1085
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:46,576
I don't know.

1086
01:50:50,577 --> 01:50:51,419
Wow.

1087
01:50:51,478 --> 01:50:53,480
I don't have to tell you
that kind of thing.

1088
01:50:55,949 --> 01:50:58,293
Oh, I didn't realize there
was something not to tell.

1089
01:51:05,325 --> 01:51:06,827
She was your girlfriend?

1090
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:14,700
Mm-hmm.

1091
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:18,505
What happened?

1092
01:51:20,874 --> 01:51:21,978
I went out with her,

1093
01:51:23,143 --> 01:51:24,713
and I never called her again.

1094
01:51:29,383 --> 01:51:30,521
Did you love her?

1095
01:51:32,853 --> 01:51:34,457
I didn't realize it at the time.

1096
01:51:37,691 --> 01:51:38,829
Mm-hmm.

1097
01:51:39,326 --> 01:51:40,326
Don't smile.

1098
01:51:40,961 --> 01:51:41,961
Well...

1099
01:51:44,131 --> 01:51:45,132
- You ready?
- Okay.

1100
01:51:54,474 --> 01:51:56,147
You gotta try harder than that.

1101
01:51:57,711 --> 01:51:59,987
I wish I could
take back every wound.

1102
01:52:00,047 --> 01:52:01,390
Guess that blue bug is back.

1103
01:52:03,217 --> 01:52:04,321
Every doubt.

1104
01:52:21,268 --> 01:52:22,542
You found me,.

1105
01:52:37,884 --> 01:52:39,693
You held out your hand.

1106
01:53:04,144 --> 01:53:05,418
I took sex.

1107
01:53:08,615 --> 01:53:09,616
A gift.

1108
01:53:14,888 --> 01:53:16,128
I played with it.

1109
01:53:24,998 --> 01:53:27,410
I played with the flame of life.

1110
01:53:39,646 --> 01:53:41,592
I was married in 1980,

1111
01:53:41,648 --> 01:53:43,650
and I've been a widow since...

1112
01:53:44,618 --> 01:53:46,461
1994, but...

1113
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:50,795
I still wear my ring
'cause he's still my husband.

1114
01:53:50,857 --> 01:53:53,098
You know, we didn't get divorced, so...

1115
01:53:53,427 --> 01:53:55,703
This is... this is my wedding ring,

1116
01:53:56,196 --> 01:53:59,143
and this I bought
for myself after he died.

1117
01:53:59,833 --> 01:54:03,110
It's what they gave runners
who didn't win a marathon

1118
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:04,672
but finished the race.

1119
01:54:05,505 --> 01:54:07,750
Be an artist.
I never thought I would live long.

1120
01:54:07,774 --> 01:54:11,517
You know, I'd be an artist
and die young of tuberculosis or something

1121
01:54:11,611 --> 01:54:13,089
like Charlotte Bronté, but, uh...

1122
01:54:13,113 --> 01:54:14,713
What bad thing did you do?

1123
01:54:15,515 --> 01:54:16,789
Just...

1124
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:18,352
got involved with...

1125
01:54:19,453 --> 01:54:21,831
this man who I thought
could help me and...

1126
01:54:21,888 --> 01:54:25,233
You made a mistake, you know?
Do you look at it...

1127
01:54:25,325 --> 01:54:26,497
You'll do fine.

1128
01:54:28,862 --> 01:54:29,897
I love you.

1129
01:54:30,897 --> 01:54:32,069
Thank you.

1130
01:54:34,701 --> 01:54:36,021
Is that your fella?

1131
01:54:37,838 --> 01:54:38,976
Fight for him.

1132
01:54:40,474 --> 01:54:42,151
Really love him.

1133
01:54:42,175 --> 01:54:43,347
Don't let him get away.

01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:41,521
BV...

1160
01:57:41,588 --> 01:57:42,588
It's complicated.

1161
01:57:45,325 --> 01:57:46,395
There you are.

1162
01:58:08,048 --> 01:58:10,221
I gotta go back and start over.

1163
01:58:12,953 --> 01:58:14,125
Like a kid.

1164
01:58:18,625 --> 01:58:20,627
I didn't have the right heart in me,.

1165
01:58:41,615 --> 01:58:43,219
You're the only one I love.

1166
01:58:48,321 --> 01:58:50,392
Even after all we've been through.

1167
01:59:19,352 --> 01:59:20,956
Mercy was a word.

1168
01:59:24,024 --> 01:59:25,833
I never thought I needed it.

1169
01:59:29,663 --> 01:59:31,609
Or not as much as other people do.

1170
01:59:59,159 --> 02:00:01,730
You asked me if I wanted to come out, too.

1171
02:00:05,365 --> 02:00:07,367
I've never been out West before.

1172
02:00:11,538 --> 02:00:13,017
I'll come find you.

1173
02:00:14,741 --> 02:00:16,721
Gonna have to pick your feet up.

1174
02:00:16,810 --> 02:00:19,347
If you don't, we will have
somebody to replace you.

1175
02:00:19,412 --> 02:00:20,914
I'm-I'm just tired of this.

1176
02:00:21,014 --> 02:00:22,857
So let's get up there
and lend a hand.

1177
02:01:05,859 --> 02:01:08,362
You wanna go back to a simple life.

1178
02:01:10,964 --> 02:01:12,466
I want the same,.

1179
02:01:31,317 --> 02:01:33,263
Let nothing come between us.

1180
02:01:36,055 --> 02:01:37,056
Ever.

1181
02:02:27,207 --> 02:02:28,311
This.

1182
02:02:38,718 --> 02:02:39,992
Only this.

1183
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:16,926
You should do it like this.
The drums should...

1184
02:04:16,950 --> 02:04:18,896
If we just build up so the third...

1185
02:04:18,952 --> 02:04:21,626
The third verse is a build.
Like, it's-It's on top.
