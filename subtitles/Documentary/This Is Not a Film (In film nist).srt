00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:31,999
Hello?

3
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:34,520
Hello, hi.

4
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:36,370
Hi. How's it going?

5
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,409
Fine. How are you?

6
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,290
Thanks. What's up?

7
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,669
Not much.
l'm having breakfast.

8
00:01:44,169 --> 00:01:44,939
Bon Appetite!

9
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:46,920
Are you outside office?

10
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:51,990
Yes. Somehow l'm making an effort.

11
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:53,940
So you're busy.

12
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:56,290
Kind of.

13
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:00,209
Listen...

14
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:04,819
l'm stuck in a problem.

15
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:10,849
What did you do about that thing?

16
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,938
l'm about to find out more

17
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,870
and l'm trying to talk
with a couple of guys.

18
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:21,429
ActualIy, l'm waiting
for the right moment to start.

19
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,330
Then it hasn't started yet?

20
00:02:26,809 --> 00:02:30,289
l'm taking a chance here and there.

21
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,650
l mean l haven't started
serious production yet.

22
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,059
Just doing some things for now.

23
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,870
Listen. l...

24
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,800
l can't say much on the phone.
Can you come to my place?

25
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:47,069
What is it?
Anything happened?

26
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:49,020
No, don't get worried.

27
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,630
Just come over. l have a few ideas
l want to tell you about.

28
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:59,520
Come here and we'll see what can be done.

29
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,628
All right. l'm somewhere
but l'll try to get there quickIy.

30
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:07,599
So you'll be here
in about half an hour, right?

31
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,839
l hope so.
There's the traffic, but l'll try.

32
00:03:11,369 --> 00:03:12,378
l'll see you then.

33
00:03:12,688 --> 00:03:13,210
Sure.

34
00:03:13,529 --> 00:03:16,479
Just don't tell anyone
you're coming here, OK?

35
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:18,908
ls there a problem?

36
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:21,170
No. Don't be worried.
Just come over.

37
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:22,599
Bye.

38
00:03:23,809 --> 00:03:24,650
See you.

39
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:25,670
See you.

40
00:03:49,249 --> 00:03:53,289
THIS IS NOT A FILM

41
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,309
Hello, Jafar?

42
00:04:08,968 --> 00:04:10,649
Are you awake?

43
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,319
l wanted to say that Panah and l
are going to your mum's.

44
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:21,830
and we'll give her New Year present,
and then maybe...

45
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,239
we'll go together to your sister's
to give her present too.

46
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,729
You want to talk to dad?
Hold on...

47
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,710
Dad, listen. l turned the camera on
and placed it on the chair.

48
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,900
l just think there isn't much charge
Ieft in it. The battery might run out.

49
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:44,830
Bye.

50
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:50,039
Don't get worried
if we're home late.

51
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,000
l'll try and call you again.

52
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:54,940
Oh, by the way,
don't forget Igi's food.

53
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:57,229
Get out of bed right now.

54
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,548
lgi's food is on the balcony.
Just wash it well.

55
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:05,380
Our daughter will kill us
if her lgi gets sick.

56
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:07,928
Make sure to water the flowers.

57
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:11,520
Don't get worried
if l call you late...

58
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:13,400
or if l don't call at all.

59
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,488
The city is real busy today,

60
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,289
and the lines
will probabIy get disconnected.

61
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,439
We'll come home late tonight.
l'll call you if l can.

62
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,529
l love you. Bye.

63
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,739
Here.
Eat and let's make up.

64
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:09,869
Stubborn boy.

65
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:22,710
Have some cheese.

66
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,799
Up here...
There...

67
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:40,369
Hello?

68
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,881
Hello Ms. Gheyrat.

69
00:07:42,811 --> 00:07:43,651
Hello sir.
How are you?

70
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:46,810
This is Panahi. Very well.
How are you doing?

71
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:48,278
Fine, thank you.

72
00:07:48,608 --> 00:07:50,679
Any news, Ms. Gheyrat?

73
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,209
Nothing new.
The appeals court hasn't decided yet.

74
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:56,770
So where do l stand right now?

75
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,279
l mean is it going to be clear
by the New Year?

76
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,428
lt all depends.
If there is some influence,

77
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:06,520
then they may issue
a verdict immediateIy.

78
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,468
But recent verdicts
have all taken long.

79
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,560
Do you think...

80
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,469
the appeals judge...

81
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:22,479
will confirm the verdict or not?

82
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:24,349
l need to know.

83
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:29,249
l believe that
the complementary punishment...

84
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:30,960
What's that?

85
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,470
l mean the 30-year ban.

86
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:34,950
Yes, 20-year ban.

87
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,280
Oh yes.
The 20-year.

88
00:08:36,609 --> 00:08:39,489
l believe the
20-year will be taken back...

89
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:44,639
and the 6-year imprisonment
will perhaps be reduced somewhat.

90
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,628
This is my guess.

91
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:49,629
That means
l'll definitely go to prison.

92
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:55,160
Yes, the prison is certain.
They're not going to acquit you.

93
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,169
unless there is some
very strong order, a strong decision,

94
00:08:59,728 --> 00:09:00,638
or some pressure.

95
00:09:00,968 --> 00:09:05,320
They never completeIy
over-rule the punishment.

96
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,459
What do you mean by ''pressure''?

97
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,969
Are you talking
about international reactions?

98
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:17,420
Yes, and the internal pressure, too.

99
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,739
The internal demand
can make a major influence.

100
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,570
Rakhshan (Banietemad)
talked to me, too.

101
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:24,680
l see.

102
00:09:24,969 --> 00:09:26,129
l told her all this.

103
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:29,509
l don't know what effort
recommendation, attention...

104
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:33,290
these things
do make a difference, you know.

105
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,259
The domestic cinema community
isn't in a position right now

106
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:39,260
to be of much help.

107
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,780
l mean if they make the slightest move,

108
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,819
they'll be banned from working as well.

109
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,940
l really don't expect any reaction from...

110
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,098
l fulIy understand.

111
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:56,669
l recentIy managed
to reduce a 4 months old case...

112
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:01,349
in the same court, from 2-year sentence
to a 1-year sentence.

113
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,200
So you see?

114
00:10:03,489 --> 00:10:04,540
Yes, but...

115
00:10:04,878 --> 00:10:07,410
But l haven't seen a case
in which the appeals judge

116
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:10,109
will completeIy
over-rule the sentence.

117
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:13,199
They either confirm or reduce it a bit.

118
00:10:13,638 --> 00:10:14,200
So l...

119
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,160
But your verdict...
my guess is that the judge

120
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,219
will definiteIy take
the 20-year ban away,

121
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:24,349
and might give a
discount on the 6-year term.

122
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,330
So from what you're saying,
l should pack my sack

123
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,550
and put it by the front door.

124
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:33,320
l hope it won't be that way.
What can l say?

125
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:37,711
l'm realIy ashamed on my own behalf.

126
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:41,680
Since we don't know
what's going to happen either.

127
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,660
Since the rulings
aren't legal rulings at all, unfortunateIy.

128
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:51,410
That's why our legal arguments
were not heard.

129
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,248
l should say this plain and simple
that the rulings are...

130
00:10:55,848 --> 00:10:58,800
one hundred percent political
and not legal at all,

131
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:01,859
not judicial at all.

132
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:03,159
100% political.

133
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:06,790
lt all depends
on the current social conditions

134
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,479
and the pressures and reactions.

135
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,030
Thank you very much.

136
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,570
l'm really ashamed
for bothering you so much.

137
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,889
Oh, no.
Please don't say that.

138
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:19,930
Goodbye.

139
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,060
Goodbye.

140
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:36,910
l think l should remove this cast
and throw it away.

141
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:40,239
Do you remember the film ''Mirror''?

142
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,409
''Mirror'' was my second film.

143
00:11:46,848 --> 00:11:52,959
lt was about a little girl
whose mother hasn't shown up...

144
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:58,369
to pick her up from school,
and she tries to go home on her own,

145
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,629
and to find the way.
She gets on the bus, and as the bus goes,

146
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:07,410
she realises
that she's going the wrong way.

147
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:10,219
Eventually
the girl can't take it any more.

148
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,330
She takes out the cast
and throws it away.

149
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:16,590
She says that she wants to be herself.

150
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,840
''What you've done is a lie.

151
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,570
l do know my way home.

152
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,531
l don't understand
what you want from me.''

153
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,019
Don't look at the camera, Mina.

154
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,180
- l'm not acting anymore!
- Cut.

155
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,099
Mina...

156
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:42,539
l want to get off!

157
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:44,628
What's the matter?

158
00:12:45,008 --> 00:12:46,590
l'm not acting anymore!

159
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,649
Has somebody bothered you?

160
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:53,108
Open the door!
Let me off!

161
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,460
- What should l do?
- Stop the bus.

162
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,789
Open up!

163
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,419
Mina, won't you say?

164
00:13:07,968 --> 00:13:08,910
No, l won't.

165
00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:10,550
Let her get off.

166
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,849
l'm not sure about the outcome, but...

167
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:23,950
Bring the camera closer.

168
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:26,940
- You want to shoot this?
- Yes.

169
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,791
- Shall we block off the sidewalk?
- No. Never mind that.

170
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,330
She might touch the microphone.

171
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,498
Do we have her voice?

172
00:13:43,008 --> 00:13:43,638
Yes.

173
00:13:44,248 --> 00:13:45,479
Ready to shoot?

174
00:13:46,369 --> 00:13:47,420
Let's go then.

175
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,488
Check the sound.

176
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:50,728
Recording.

177
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,930
So l was saying.

178
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:58,289
l think right now l'm in
exactly a similar position as Mina.

179
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:03,840
Somehow l must remove my cast
and throw it away.

180
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,739
This morning
after we talked on the phone,

181
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:12,479
l sat down and reviewed the shots
l had filmed earlier.

182
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:16,570
l realised it seems like pretending
in a sense.

183
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,620
lt is turning out to be a lie
and that it is somehow not me.

184
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,160
l remembered you
were going to make a film...

185
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:27,509
about such problems.

186
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:28,520
What was it exactly?

187
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:31,969
Behind the scenes
of Iranian filmmakers not making films.

188
00:14:32,609 --> 00:14:33,940
l see.

189
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:37,180
That's why l asked you to come over.

190
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:40,789
Perhaps we could achieve something

191
00:14:41,728 --> 00:14:43,239
inside this house.

192
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:45,050
l'll tell you now.

193
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,079
Just a moment, let me get this.

194
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:51,359
By the way, l don't know
much about technical problems.

195
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,118
Now do we need
additional light for the ambience?

196
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,030
Right now
the problem is over-saturation.

197
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,859
The problem is over-exposure.

198
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:05,249
But there is too much light
coming through the windows.

199
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:08,810
So l don't need
to fetch additional light?

200
00:15:09,249 --> 00:15:10,899
Good. Let's go into the kitchen.

201
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:14,729
What are you going to do?

202
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,811
Let's drink our tea
and think about what to do.

203
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,490
The reason l took
this screenplay is that...

204
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:28,460
Wait a moment.

205
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,999
Let me change my view.

206
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,240
l don't know if you remember
this screenplay or not.

207
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,569
This is the last film
that l was going to make.

208
00:15:38,128 --> 00:15:41,219
l sent it for approval,
which unfortunately they didn't approve.

209
00:15:41,849 --> 00:15:45,429
They told me to make
some changes to the screenplay...

210
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:48,840
and to mellow it down a little
and it might get permission,

211
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:55,210
but still it didn't get the approval,
and l wasn't allowed to work.

212
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:02,160
Now l thought perhaps
l could read out the screenplay.

213
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:08,479
Now that l'm not allowed
to make the film

214
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:12,840
perhaps by reading and explaining,

215
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:19,639
l might create an image of it.

216
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,540
Perhaps the viewer will see

217
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,849
the film that wasn't made.

218
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,989
The film is about a girl
who has been admitted

219
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:34,339
to university in the field of arts.

220
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:37,069
But since she comes
from a traditional family,

221
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:39,889
her family does not let her...

222
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:45,218
... to study in that field.

223
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:48,210
Particularly after she passes...

224
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:50,868
the university entrance exam,

225
00:16:51,368 --> 00:16:55,060
and her name is printed in newspapers.

226
00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:00,479
Her father finds out
and the family makes restrictions for her.

227
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,750
- Do you want me to warm up your tea?
- No, thanks.

228
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,300
Then the parents leave on a trip
and lock the girl inside the house.

229
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,609
From now on, with all doors locked

230
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,290
the girl tries to find

231
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,291
some way out of the house.

232
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:26,500
lf she cannot get to Tehran
in time for registration,

233
00:17:28,609 --> 00:17:31,100
she will be denied
the chance to go to university.

234
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,339
The film was supposed to take place

235
00:17:34,848 --> 00:17:37,800
within the interior of the house
and l tried to do it

236
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:39,780
but l couldn't.

237
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:43,398
That's why l asked you
to come over and help me

238
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,609
in this location
to be able to tell the screenplay.

239
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:50,148
With the camera following me

240
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,439
rather than being placed on tripod,

241
00:17:53,970 --> 00:18:00,050
l can tell the screenplay more easily.

242
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,540
So you are about to tell

243
00:18:05,128 --> 00:18:07,619
your last screenplay that wasn't made?

244
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:12,449
Yes, but not in here.

245
00:18:12,971 --> 00:18:15,389
lf l sit here and read

246
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,849
it will bore everyone.

247
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,420
But if we go to that area over there,

248
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,820
we can construct the conditions

249
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:27,189
to explain more easily.

250
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,619
Good.
So let's go over to the other side.

251
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,520
Very well. Cut.

252
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:40,469
Cut?

253
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:41,668
Go on. Cut.

254
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,750
You are not directing.
It's an offence.

255
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,819
You just read the screenplay.

256
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:52,270
So l'm not a director any more.

257
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:57,340
Ok. If you are going to describe,
then leave the rest to me.

258
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,560
Just tell us your screenplay
and l'll follow you.

259
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,310
l hope it works.

260
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:06,270
By the way,
acting and reading screenplay by me

261
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,629
are not going to be counted
as offence, are they?

262
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:09,820
l hope not.

263
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,109
No, they aren't.

264
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:17,379
So far it says...
20 years ban from film-making,

265
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,270
20 years ban
from writing screenplays,

266
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,659
20 years ban
from leaving the country,

267
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,459
20 years ban
from having interviews.

268
00:19:24,849 --> 00:19:27,200
Acting and reading screenplays
were not mentioned.

269
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:28,530
Thanks God.

270
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,969
l think this space here

271
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:42,599
should be enough for our story.

272
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:46,388
This location does not match

273
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:49,599
our main character, Maryam...

274
00:19:50,129 --> 00:19:52,199
since she's from a lower class.

275
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:55,520
We can only recreate the location here

276
00:19:56,129 --> 00:20:00,590
so we can get a feel of her situation...

277
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,490
Just a moment.

278
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:22,409
Let's imagine this rug is the girl's home.

279
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:26,050
We suppose the girl's entire, house
to be this area here

280
00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:28,999
and l'll start from here...

281
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:32,599
and these lines that l draw...

282
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:38,330
are the walls of the girl's room.

283
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:56,780
This is her room.

284
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:01,889
Let's say this is her bed
and she's lying here.

285
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,590
There's a window here.

286
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,840
The opening shot will be of this window.

287
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,159
This shot will last about 6

288
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,260
and we'll only be seeing the alley.

289
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,628
Then the entrance to the room will be here.

290
00:21:28,249 --> 00:21:31,369
Here's the entrance to the girl's room.

291
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:36,510
And here's the entrance to the house.

292
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,609
They enter through here.

293
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:48,530
The living room is here.

294
00:21:48,888 --> 00:21:52,149
A few stairs and we enter...

295
00:21:53,449 --> 00:21:54,849
the girl's room.

296
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:57,368
Take these to be the stairs.

297
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,080
Here's the alley.

298
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,189
Here's the house next-door.

299
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,449
The boy always stands here.

300
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:13,889
l'll tell of some events

301
00:22:14,689 --> 00:22:17,010
that take place inside this house.

302
00:22:20,571 --> 00:22:23,520
This is the location l found
on my trip to Isfahan.

303
00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:30,539
The window had to be altered
to match my idea.

304
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:34,050
Here's the girl's room
and it's in a mess right now,

305
00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:36,720
and we had to change the arrangements.

306
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:40,098
These are the stairs

307
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,750
that lead to the girl's room.

308
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:52,389
Here's the living room
that l talked about.

309
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:57,169
Here's the entrance to the house
that we're going to need.

310
00:22:58,409 --> 00:22:59,320
ln my last five films,

311
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:01,790
events have always taken, place
out on the streets

312
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,800
and, due to limitations that exist
concerning the veil for actresses,

313
00:23:06,449 --> 00:23:08,409
l have never shot inside homes.

314
00:23:10,251 --> 00:23:13,970
Then l submitted a screenplay
titled ''Return'' to the Ministry,

315
00:23:14,689 --> 00:23:16,939
but they didn't grant permission
for making.

316
00:23:17,449 --> 00:23:19,620
l pursued that for a couple of years.

317
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,550
''Return'' was about
the last day of the (lran-lraq) war,

318
00:23:23,128 --> 00:23:26,780
based on a short story
by a writer who had himself spent

319
00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:30,638
the whole duration of the war
in the war zone.

320
00:23:31,128 --> 00:23:35,030
lran has finally accepted
the resolution to end the war.

321
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,759
And the soldiers are returning
to their hometowns.

322
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:42,109
Now there aren't enough vehicles
for them to return.

323
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:45,138
Eventually, some of the soldiers

324
00:23:45,688 --> 00:23:48,500
lie on railroad tracks

325
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,459
and force a train to stop,
so they can get on.

326
00:23:53,128 --> 00:23:56,179
lt is only after they get on the train
that we begin to see

327
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,280
the problems of war.

328
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:01,990
Well, after they didn't grant
permission to make,

329
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:05,250
l started thinking what to do.
l sketched out other subjects,

330
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:07,780
and they all took place
in single locations.

331
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,899
Then l decided
to use the interior as location.

332
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:12,470
My next screenplay titled ''Sea'' took place

333
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,790
inside a holiday home by the sea.

334
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,970
There were only 3 or 4 characters,

335
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,299
so that it could be made
inside the home...

336
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:25,580
in case they didn't grant
permission to make.

337
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,138
Unfortunately, that didn't work either.

338
00:24:28,608 --> 00:24:31,629
My next film was being made together
with Mr. Rasoulof...

339
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,269
inside this house
and we had shot 30% of the film...

340
00:24:36,848 --> 00:24:40,399
when all of a sudden
they stormed in and took us away...

341
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,138
with all the footage,
and the problems started.

342
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,750
Let's put that aside.

343
00:24:46,209 --> 00:24:48,240
Opening shot.
Here's our frame...

344
00:24:49,609 --> 00:24:51,118
showing the alley.

345
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:54,090
There's a boy standing at the far end.

346
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:59,349
An old woman turns into the alley
and walks up to the middle of the alley.

347
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:04,740
The boy comes to help her
with a heavy load she's carrying.

348
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,980
They pass underneath our frame

349
00:25:09,689 --> 00:25:13,480
as we continue to see the alley
through a fixed shot.

350
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,899
We hear the door bell ring,
and after a moment the boy returns.

351
00:25:18,689 --> 00:25:21,639
The old woman enters the house

352
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,580
comes up the stairs,

353
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:28,659
opens this door and enters the room.

354
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,459
She sees that the girl is sleeping.

355
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,358
We can tell all this from the sounds.

356
00:25:35,249 --> 00:25:37,709
''Hi Granny.
Did you get me the mobile SIM card?''

357
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,619
Not in this tone, of course.

358
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,679
We should be able to tell
she's just woken up

359
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,689
and she's a little sleepy.

360
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:48,809
''Your father told me not to buy you one.
Did you tell him?''

361
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,590
''What do you think?
l shouldn't have?''

362
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,480
''Oh, granny!''

363
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:57,560
We hear the old woman...
''Get up, get up.''

364
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:02,369
The old woman whines
about her physical weakness,

365
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:09,599
and says that she's unable
to visit her every day.

366
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:13,390
And we learn that she's alone at home

367
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,949
no one other
than the old woman visits her

368
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,099
and that she is in fact

369
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:23,299
the girl's paternal grandmother.

370
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:28,449
The old woman gives the girl
her last words and talks of the boy

371
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,348
and says that he is a nice boy.

372
00:26:31,848 --> 00:26:32,759
She says that

373
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:36,599
she thinks the boy might in fact
be the next-door girl's suitor.

374
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,349
Once again the old woman
gives the girl her last word,

375
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,310
and says that
she won't visit the girl for a week.

376
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,639
We hear her footsteps

377
00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:51,240
as she goes back
the way she had come in.

378
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,470
We hear the door
open to the alley and...

379
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,599
and through this same frame...

380
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:01,609
we see the old woman.

381
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,290
As we hear the door
we also see the boy

382
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,129
leave his standing position
at the top of the alley.

383
00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:10,251
The old woman
who has entered the frame...

384
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:14,040
walks to the end of the alley
and turns right.

385
00:27:14,689 --> 00:27:19,429
After a moment
the boy takes up his position again.

386
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:22,848
and stares at this window.

387
00:27:23,368 --> 00:27:24,490
This was the opening shot.

388
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:29,759
Second shot
take this place to be the bathroom,

389
00:27:31,368 --> 00:27:33,470
and the camera
is behind the bathroom door.

390
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,799
We hear the usual sounds
from inside the bathroom.

391
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:42,139
Then the door opens
and for the first time

392
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,128
we see the girl
who has a shaven head.

393
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:48,929
She goes to the bed,
and sits on the edge of the bed.

394
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,599
And the bed is here
as we said before.

395
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,699
Then she lies on the bed
for a moment

396
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:58,720
and touches her face.

397
00:27:59,129 --> 00:28:00,571
The phone rings.

398
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:05,550
She goes toward the phone,
which is located here.

399
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:09,669
Suppose this is the phone on the table.

400
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:14,980
She answers the phone,

401
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,899
but no one talks.

402
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,219
She slams the receiver to the floor.

403
00:28:19,688 --> 00:28:21,579
She throws herself on the bed...

404
00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:29,168
and as her face is buried
in the mattress, she cries.

405
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:30,730
After a while

406
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,169
she turns and stares at the ceiling
for a few moments.

407
00:28:36,489 --> 00:28:38,909
There is a strong rope
hanging from the ceiling.

408
00:28:39,449 --> 00:28:42,779
The camera tilts down

409
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:48,020
There is a chair right here.

410
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:54,909
The girl is sitting on the chair and...

411
00:28:57,449 --> 00:28:58,500
stares intently,

412
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,990
as if deciding to do the last thing...

413
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:04,280
that she must do
before committing suicide.

414
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:07,200
ln the previous shot,
when no one answered the phone,

415
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:09,050
she had slammed
the phone to the ground

416
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:11,909
and it was shattered
with its pieces all over the floor.

417
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:15,740
Now she is looking
at the phone in pieces.

418
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:17,918
Next shot. Cut.

419
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:23,599
The handset that she slammed
is in pieces here.

420
00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:32,240
This shot is in fact
the P.O.V. of the girl.

421
00:29:33,089 --> 00:29:37,369
She starts putting together
the pieces when...

422
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:40,230
the phone suddenly rings.

423
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:44,669
She mechanically puts
the handset to her ear.

424
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,580
''Hello?''

425
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,230
She hears the ringing again.

426
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:53,379
She goes toward the base...

427
00:29:53,889 --> 00:29:54,760
and pushes...

428
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:01,189
What is it?
Why don't you continue?

429
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:02,409
ln a moment...

430
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:12,730
We hear the end-of-call tone.

431
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,148
Maryam thinks for a moment.

432
00:30:15,928 --> 00:30:17,579
Although she is upset...

433
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,579
If we could tell a film
then why make a film?

434
00:31:49,169 --> 00:31:50,290
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

435
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:52,270
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

436
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,129
How much is that?

437
00:31:56,449 --> 00:31:57,389
Be our guest.

438
00:31:59,889 --> 00:32:01,120
What's going on outside?

439
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:04,340
Nothing yet. It has just started.
It'll soon get intense.

440
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:05,730
Why do you ask?

441
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:06,959
Just asking.

442
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:08,741
Here you are.

443
00:32:09,051 --> 00:32:09,989
ls that right?

444
00:32:11,249 --> 00:32:12,789
Yes. Thanks.

445
00:32:13,448 --> 00:32:14,500
Keep the change.

446
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:15,859
Thank you.

447
00:32:16,209 --> 00:32:17,080
Bye.

448
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:22,669
Food is here.

449
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:02,619
l'm looking for the sequence

450
00:33:03,209 --> 00:33:05,670
in which Hossein goes to the jeweller's

451
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,378
and the jeweller humiliates him.

452
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:12,479
He acted in such a way
that was beyond my control...

453
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:14,909
Just a moment...

454
00:33:15,449 --> 00:33:16,848
This... Not here.

455
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,409
Here... Just look at this.

456
00:35:08,248 --> 00:35:12,458
When you are telling,
you must tell a bunch of details.

457
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:16,200
But with an amateur actor
like Hossein

458
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,249
the details won't be predictable
in advance at all.

459
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,148
You write some things,

460
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:24,300
but when you go on location,

461
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,689
and the amateur enters

462
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:31,629
he does the directing on you.

463
00:35:32,649 --> 00:35:35,459
He leads you
to how you explain the film.

464
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,370
What l mean is that
the film must first be made

465
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,680
for us to be able to explain it later.

466
00:35:41,129 --> 00:35:44,109
How could l explain
before making the film...

467
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,760
Hossein should lean against the wall,
do the thing

468
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:51,350
that he did with his eyes,
and that l had never seen before?

469
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,289
l mean when l told him to act
he did all that by himself.

470
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,240
l don't know.

471
00:35:56,609 --> 00:35:58,780
Maybe l'm...

472
00:36:00,891 --> 00:36:03,208
marking time somehow.

473
00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:07,030
l feel what we are doing here
is also a lie.

474
00:36:07,689 --> 00:36:09,829
like the first sequence that we saw.

475
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:13,108
The rest will certainly
turn out to be lies...

476
00:36:13,728 --> 00:36:15,379
no matter how it proceeds.

477
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,248
Let's take the film ''Circle''
for example...

478
00:36:18,799 --> 00:36:20,549
Where was it?

479
00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:30,609
But you can't make
a film now anyhow, can you?

480
00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:33,769
So what l can't make film?
That means l ask you...

481
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:35,910
to take a film of me?

482
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,209
Do you think it will turn
into some major work of art?

483
00:36:38,689 --> 00:36:41,079
- That's what you said, right?
- What did l say?

484
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:44,309
You asked me to come here.
You said you had tried a couple of shots,

485
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,709
they hadn't worked out,
they seemed phony...

486
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:51,250
Jafar, You are now waiting
for the confirmation of the verdict...

487
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:54,459
for the film that you were making before.

488
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,661
You have a 20-year ban on all activities
in addition to a 6-year prison term.

489
00:36:59,371 --> 00:36:59,959
So...

490
00:37:00,209 --> 00:37:02,529
Well this is an activity
related to cinema, anyhow.

491
00:37:03,049 --> 00:37:05,300
What you're doing now,
and later l'll be doing.

492
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,850
- What is?
- This film being made.

493
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:11,089
- You call this a film?
- It beats me. You should say.

494
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,999
OK, come and look.
You see this sequence?

495
00:37:16,608 --> 00:37:21,320
ln that film
if the actress was directing...

496
00:37:22,169 --> 00:37:23,749
Shoot the screen...

497
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:32,938
OK. Look.

498
00:37:33,248 --> 00:37:35,950
Here location is doing the directing.

499
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:40,399
This actress didn't need to make
any certain face to show her anxiety.

500
00:37:41,129 --> 00:37:44,890
Those vertical lines in the location...

501
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:47,010
Those lines...

502
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,510
supplement her mental state.

503
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,269
lt all works out perfectly.

504
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:55,810
Now how can l really express myself
inside that boundary

505
00:37:56,371 --> 00:37:58,090
with the lines l drew?

506
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:02,029
How can l tell the sense and feeling
in this kind of film?

507
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,030
Not possible

508
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:09,038
Let's go on now,
maybe my feeling improves...

509
00:38:10,169 --> 00:38:13,499
We'll see what we can do later.

510
00:39:20,648 --> 00:39:21,808
What do you want?

511
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,829
Wherever you go, it's blocked.

512
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:03,898
Most websites are filtered.
The rest don't saying anything.

513
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,899
Your nails are too sharp.

514
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,379
Go Igi... Go up.

515
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,039
Your nails are hurting me.

516
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,930
lt says here..
''We're glad to have caused

517
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:48,260
the House of Cinema
to be concerned about the revolution.''

518
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:51,101
The Cinema Deputy
of the Ministry indicates

519
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:54,559
that they are happy that
for the first time the concern

520
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:57,519
about execution of policies
with revolutionary goals have become

521
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:00,498
the focal point of the current directors
of the House of Cinema.

522
00:41:02,009 --> 00:41:06,720
He says..
''We directed the Berlin Film Festival''.

523
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:02,280
Hi Rakhshan.

524
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:03,519
Hi, how are you?

525
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,569
Fine. How are you?

526
00:43:05,969 --> 00:43:07,199
How about you?

527
00:43:07,609 --> 00:43:09,820
l'm fine. Not bad.
Just so-so.

528
00:43:11,169 --> 00:43:12,109
Anything new?

529
00:43:12,409 --> 00:43:16,550
l was talking to my lawyer earlier.

530
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,669
Apparently she spoke with you.

531
00:43:20,169 --> 00:43:21,819
Yes. l have spoken with her.

532
00:43:22,249 --> 00:43:23,160
What did she say?

533
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:28,180
l wanted to make sure about
the court district number and details.

534
00:43:28,969 --> 00:43:32,970
l thought the least we could do
was to recirculate

535
00:43:33,729 --> 00:43:37,870
the original appeal made
by the 12 prominent filmmakers,

536
00:43:38,689 --> 00:43:41,530
and send it to the appeals court.

537
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:44,011
Do you have anything new?

538
00:43:44,451 --> 00:43:48,309
No. l talked with Gheyrat.
She wasn't too hopeful...

539
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:53,609
She said perhaps
the reactions and protests...

540
00:43:55,608 --> 00:43:59,999
by world artists
could affect the decision.

541
00:44:02,328 --> 00:44:05,809
The same voices that are heard
particularly within the country.

542
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:10,389
l told her that l didn't wish
to put the Iranian colleagues in trouble.

543
00:44:11,128 --> 00:44:14,749
There are problems for all of us
that everyone knows about.

544
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:16,249
But...

545
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:19,328
Well, problems there are plenty.

546
00:44:19,808 --> 00:44:23,809
The thing is that
everyone is getting scared off.

547
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,430
l mean l don't know...

548
00:44:26,889 --> 00:44:28,890
You know the conditions well.

549
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:32,280
Turning every little instance

550
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:38,300
into a big deal for everyone...

551
00:44:39,649 --> 00:44:42,980
has caused everyone
to arrive at a certain numbness.

552
00:44:43,649 --> 00:44:47,090
Just last night l was thinking
of talking with you and saying

553
00:44:47,809 --> 00:44:51,430
that the case is now in the appeals court,

554
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:56,649
and the same appeal by the filmmakers
and this time more extended

555
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:00,639
and then to follow up
in the Judiciary Branch directIy.

556
00:45:01,728 --> 00:45:02,958
OK. Thank you.

557
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:04,479
Bye.

558
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:05,820
Bye.

559
00:45:10,489 --> 00:45:11,720
lt's OK. Let's go on.

560
00:45:12,809 --> 00:45:14,320
l gave the Cut again!

561
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:18,559
What?
l don't know what can be done really.

562
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:25,700
Let me try and tell
another part of the screenplay.

563
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:29,660
l know it can't be compared
with a film or a real work. But...

564
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:34,129
l'd like to tell another sequence.
We'll see how it turns out.

565
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,510
The sequence in which the girl...

566
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:39,559
Oh, by the way,
l never showed you the girl.

567
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:45,979
Yes... Here.

568
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:49,839
These 2 girls spoke with Isfahani accent.

569
00:45:50,369 --> 00:45:52,619
We tested a number...
30 or 40 girls,

570
00:45:53,128 --> 00:45:56,359
but these two were the closest
to what l was after

571
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,748
Particularly if they shaved their heads.

572
00:46:00,328 --> 00:46:02,189
This one with those hollow eyes,

573
00:46:02,689 --> 00:46:05,600
it looked like she'd had a life

574
00:46:07,328 --> 00:46:10,209
full of hardships and problems.

575
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:12,740
l felt that the role would suit her

576
00:46:13,169 --> 00:46:15,589
and she had
a very nice Isfahani accent, too.

577
00:46:16,128 --> 00:46:16,689
Now...

578
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:21,249
Oh, by the way, let me say, that
within the whole film

579
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:26,579
she developed
a very intense relationship with the boy

580
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:30,951
who stands at the end of the alley,

581
00:46:31,609 --> 00:46:33,289
and within the 4 - 5 days...

582
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:37,180
she feels that she's falling in love
with the boy.

583
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:40,649
And it causes her
to gradually lose interest in

584
00:46:41,209 --> 00:46:45,460
going to Tehran,
and there's a relationship forming.

585
00:46:46,729 --> 00:46:49,819
Toward the end of the film
we begin to learn that

586
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,219
as in the original story...

587
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:56,788
Since this story is based
on a 1-page work,

588
00:46:57,529 --> 00:47:00,269
by Chekhov titled ''A Girl's Notes''

589
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:03,620
that Kambozia (Partovi)
and l worked together on...

590
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:10,160
we begin to learn
that the boy didn't come there...

591
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:13,639
because he was in love

592
00:47:14,209 --> 00:47:17,999
but that he had adverse intention, and...

593
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:21,179
he was in fact an agent.

594
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:24,269
Anyway, one sequence l like

595
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:27,100
is when her sister comes to the door...

596
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,390
Why do l keep crossing here?
It's by habit.

597
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,340
The other time
l left the phone behind the line.

598
00:47:33,609 --> 00:47:36,630
The sister comes to the door
and we later learn that...

599
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:41,729
she has left her husband in a sulk
and has nowhere to go.

600
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:46,529
Door is locked
and only the grandmother has the key.

601
00:47:48,569 --> 00:47:51,829
The girl tries to talk with her sister
through the window,

602
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:53,329
but she can't.

603
00:47:53,649 --> 00:47:57,339
So she comes over here
and goes down these stairs,

604
00:47:59,249 --> 00:48:02,409
and arrives behind the entrance.

605
00:48:03,648 --> 00:48:07,019
She has tried before to open the door,
but couldn't

606
00:48:07,689 --> 00:48:10,430
so she just sits there behind the door,

607
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:14,320
like this, and talks with her sister.

608
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:16,820
We never see the sister.

609
00:48:17,289 --> 00:48:19,179
We have a closed frame.

610
00:48:19,649 --> 00:48:23,410
We only hear the sister talk
from behind the door.

611
00:48:24,129 --> 00:48:26,059
The sister talks
of her own problems,

612
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:29,620
and Maryam talks of her own problems,
and it turns out...

613
00:48:30,609 --> 00:48:32,890
that they both have
serious problems.

614
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,729
The sister, who is behind the door

615
00:48:36,209 --> 00:48:37,959
notices the boy's presence.

616
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,780
ln one of my favourite dialogues,

617
00:48:41,249 --> 00:48:44,438
she says..
''Listen, go with him.''

618
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:32,809
Since last year which was actualIy
the first 'fireworks Wednesday'

619
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:35,800
since the protests following
the presidential elections,

620
00:50:36,329 --> 00:50:37,940
lran's leader for the first time

621
00:50:38,371 --> 00:50:41,418
denounced fireworks Wednesday
as unreligious,

622
00:50:42,049 --> 00:50:45,809
and said there's no religious basis
for fireworks Wednesday.

623
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:48,739
Therefore practicalIy since last year...

624
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:50,599
Hello.

625
00:50:51,728 --> 00:50:54,570
- Is Aunt Tahereh home?
- No, she's gone out.

626
00:50:55,169 --> 00:50:55,970
How about Panah?

627
00:50:56,288 --> 00:51:00,289
Panah has gone with Tahereh
to give his grandma's New Year present.

628
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:04,489
- Do you know when they'll come home?
- Late at night, l think.

629
00:51:05,168 --> 00:51:06,850
Can l ask a favour?

630
00:51:07,649 --> 00:51:09,050
Just don't ask me to keep this.

631
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:11,309
Please.
There's no one to keep Micky.

632
00:51:11,809 --> 00:51:14,999
l'm going out with Shahrzad
for the Fireworks. l have promised her.

633
00:51:15,649 --> 00:51:17,399
Why don't you
take him to the 8th floor?

634
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:19,499
But Shahrzad
has left her cat with them.

635
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:22,729
Just for an hour please.
l promise l'll be back soon.

636
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:26,260
- But what am l supposed to do with it?
- l'll be back soon.

637
00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:28,591
- When will you be back?
- In one hour.

638
00:51:29,011 --> 00:51:30,019
Well, come on in.

639
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:33,019
l'll really be back soon.

640
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,841
Go Micky.

641
00:51:40,929 --> 00:51:42,608
l'll come soon. Thanks a lot.

642
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:44,169
OK. Bye.

643
00:51:49,328 --> 00:51:50,410
Come. Come here.

644
00:52:02,849 --> 00:52:03,858
Shima...

645
00:52:09,249 --> 00:52:11,108
Take this out, Shima. Igi is scared.

646
00:52:11,608 --> 00:52:12,200
But he's safe.

647
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:15,910
Sorry, l can't.
Take him to the 6th floor.

648
00:52:29,169 --> 00:52:29,970
Hello?

649
00:52:32,169 --> 00:52:32,899
Hi.

650
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:34,290
Hello, sir.
How is it going?

651
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:36,539
Thanks. What's up?

652
00:52:37,288 --> 00:52:38,478
Where are you?

653
00:52:38,849 --> 00:52:40,709
Just sitting at home.

654
00:52:42,249 --> 00:52:43,759
Where are Tahereh and Panah?

655
00:52:44,168 --> 00:52:48,740
They've gone to give my mother
her New Year present.

656
00:52:51,289 --> 00:52:54,099
You should see outside.
Shall l come and pick you up?

657
00:52:56,609 --> 00:52:57,939
No. l can't come.

658
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:02,148
The guys have asked me to call
as in ask you to come if you like.

659
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:04,840
No, thanks.
l'm waiting for Tahereh and Panah.

660
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:06,910
l'll have to see what they're up to.

661
00:53:07,329 --> 00:53:09,119
There's amazing traffic outside.

662
00:53:09,529 --> 00:53:13,039
The crowd is in the middle of street
and armed men are standing around.

663
00:53:13,729 --> 00:53:14,289
Where?

664
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:16,149
There's a weird atmosphere outside.

665
00:53:16,609 --> 00:53:18,709
l feel armed men
are helping light up the fires!

666
00:53:19,209 --> 00:53:20,189
Where are you?

667
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:24,701
l'm returning from office.
But don't get worried.

668
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:29,269
Would you like me to pick up Tahereh,
and bring her home?

669
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:34,959
No. l asked them to wait
until the streets are quiet.

670
00:53:36,369 --> 00:53:38,509
Excuse me... sorry.
l'll call you.

671
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,559
Police stopped me.

672
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:41,949
What happened?

673
00:53:43,409 --> 00:53:44,208
Hello?

674
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:19,510
Can you see the fireworks at all?

675
00:55:29,371 --> 00:55:29,930
Hello?

676
00:55:30,169 --> 00:55:32,269
Let me turn down the TV.

677
00:55:33,889 --> 00:55:35,890
l called to say don't worry.

678
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:38,969
They were checking my camera.

679
00:55:39,529 --> 00:55:41,739
Don't worry.
l'm through the checkpoint now.

680
00:55:42,249 --> 00:55:44,140
But who were they that stopped you?

681
00:55:44,729 --> 00:55:46,728
They've got checkpoints.
They stop cars.

682
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:49,879
They'll ask you to pull over
and they'll start searching.

683
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:51,930
lt was just a random check.

684
00:55:52,769 --> 00:55:56,139
They saw my camera on the seat.
They asked me to pull over.

685
00:55:56,809 --> 00:55:58,669
He asked me
why l was carrying a camera.

686
00:55:59,129 --> 00:56:01,379
l said it's for my work.
l'm returning from my office.

687
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:04,840
He took a look
at my camera and he let me go.

688
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:08,649
Listen. Be careful.

689
00:56:10,769 --> 00:56:11,820
Sure.

690
00:56:12,809 --> 00:56:16,600
Sir... If you are worried,
l can go and pick up Tahereh and Panah.

691
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:19,189
lt's unbelievable traffic out here

692
00:56:19,649 --> 00:56:22,280
and l see a lot of police on the streets.

693
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:24,950
You don't need to do anything.

694
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,170
You just look after yourself.

695
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:29,160
Don't cause any trouble.

696
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:30,820
Ok. l'm going directIy home.

697
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:33,559
Don't cause any problem. Just go.

698
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,898
Yes, sir. l was in the office
and now l'm going home.

699
00:56:37,529 --> 00:56:38,159
OK.

700
00:56:38,489 --> 00:56:39,498
Thanks. Bye.

701
00:56:39,849 --> 00:56:40,550
Bye.

702
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:07,280
What are you doing?

703
00:57:09,209 --> 00:57:11,070
l got bored, l'm taking a film.

704
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:13,919
We aren't able to make our film
so at least...

705
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:16,630
l want to see if l can do anything
with the cell phone.

706
00:57:18,649 --> 00:57:21,070
They say,
''when hairdressers have nothing to do,

707
00:57:21,609 --> 00:57:23,329
they cut each other's hair.''

708
00:57:24,931 --> 00:57:26,539
Fine. You shoot, too.

709
00:57:27,289 --> 00:57:29,849
But what good can it do?
The quality is too low.

710
00:57:31,769 --> 00:57:34,049
Listen, Jafar. l believe what matters
is that it is documented.

711
00:57:34,569 --> 00:57:36,708
Since the day
those things happened to you,

712
00:57:37,248 --> 00:57:39,070
and after you left the prison...

713
00:57:39,649 --> 00:57:43,339
if you had turned on
your cell-phone's camera,

714
00:57:45,089 --> 00:57:47,720
you would have recorded
a lot of important moments.

715
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:51,599
We won't know if they can be turned
into a film or not...

716
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:53,709
Even the things we've been doing
so far today.

717
00:57:54,129 --> 00:57:56,550
If you want to turn it into a film,
l doubt it, but...

718
00:57:57,689 --> 00:58:00,390
if you're documenting the days,
then go ahead.

719
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:05,100
l don't know
what we've been doing.

720
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:10,229
But l thought l might hear
about my verdict any time...

721
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:15,590
and l've got tired of sitting home
the past few months,

722
00:58:16,609 --> 00:58:18,499
l thought l might as well do something.

723
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:20,160
That's quite natural.

724
00:58:22,371 --> 00:58:23,210
Don't cut, Jafar.

725
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:24,899
- Why?
- Keep it on.

726
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:27,740
And shoot what?

727
00:58:30,169 --> 00:58:33,049
Take a shot of me in case l'm arrested...

728
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:36,239
there will be some images left.

729
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:42,239
Nothing can be seen from this side.
Can't see outside.

730
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:47,249
Don't count much
on what l have taken

731
00:58:47,809 --> 00:58:49,458
since l'm not a photographer.

732
00:58:50,489 --> 00:58:51,999
At least you know some things.

733
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,689
l really don't know anything technical.

734
00:58:57,889 --> 00:58:59,680
Do you really want us to continue,
or what?

735
00:59:00,129 --> 00:59:01,600
l don't know.

736
00:59:02,729 --> 00:59:05,850
Can't you stay longer tonight,
so we see how it goes?

737
00:59:07,329 --> 00:59:10,809
You want us to sit like this
Iooking at each other all night?

738
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:12,681
and we can't do anything.

739
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:16,240
l think l should be going.
l'm worried about my son, Yasna.

740
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:20,221
He was going to Fireworks Wednesday
with a lot of ammunition.

741
00:59:21,329 --> 00:59:23,499
lt's late already.

742
00:59:24,689 --> 00:59:26,340
We can meet again tomorrow.

743
00:59:26,768 --> 00:59:29,719
Now l'm going to leave
the camera with you...

744
00:59:30,529 --> 00:59:32,418
exactly the way
l took it from you..

745
00:59:32,849 --> 00:59:34,148
Do you think
l will shoot anything?

746
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:38,489
No, but it matters
that the cameras stay ON.

747
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:47,259
lt's important
that the cameras are ON.

748
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:51,439
Let me make it stable.

749
00:59:52,609 --> 00:59:54,748
How do you make it level?
With a lighter?

750
00:59:55,489 --> 00:59:57,379
A lighter as a tripod.

751
01:00:00,209 --> 01:00:02,169
Pass your cigarette pack.

752
01:00:08,729 --> 01:00:11,470
After l leave, you just sit down
and talk to this camera.

753
01:00:12,649 --> 01:00:14,820
Perhaps we can watch
this footage later,

754
01:00:15,329 --> 01:00:17,609
and edit them and see how it looks.

755
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:22,370
Right. l think the main thing
is to document.

756
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:25,180
- So you're really leaving?
- If you don't mind, yes.

757
01:00:25,729 --> 01:00:29,349
Let me see you to the door,
and record your leaving.

758
01:00:30,648 --> 01:00:32,228
l have my cell phone, too.

759
01:00:32,649 --> 01:00:34,789
Are you leaving?
Give my best to your wife.

760
01:00:35,329 --> 01:00:35,819
Sure.

761
01:00:36,089 --> 01:00:38,159
Forgive me for all the troubles.

762
01:00:38,608 --> 01:00:42,680
Tell her a couple of idle men
were filming one another.

763
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:44,139
No, that's OK.

764
01:00:44,449 --> 01:00:46,128
Oh, by the way, Rakhshan...

765
01:00:48,329 --> 01:00:50,609
Once we were talking
and we had nothing to do.

766
01:00:51,169 --> 01:00:53,909
Rakhshan suggested
starting a mobile kitchen.

767
01:00:54,809 --> 01:00:56,320
We asked how do you mean ''kitchen''?

768
01:00:56,729 --> 01:00:59,220
She said, we rent a van
and write a sign on it..

769
01:00:59,809 --> 01:01:02,720
''ldle Filmmakers' Mobile Kitchen''.

770
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:06,600
Then we agreed
that each of us cook some dish.

771
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:10,729
She asked me what l could cook.
l said l don't know how to cook at all.

772
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:15,450
Then l thought a little and l said
my mother cooks very nice meatballs.

773
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:19,999
She suggested we write in the menu..
''Jafar's mother's meatballs''!

774
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:22,959
- Hello, Mr. Panahi.
- Hello.

775
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:24,800
Do l know you?

776
01:01:25,129 --> 01:01:27,299
Hassan... Nasrin's brother...

777
01:01:28,128 --> 01:01:29,599
Akbar's brother-in-law...
the custodian.

778
01:01:29,969 --> 01:01:32,359
- Well?
- l'm here to pick up your trash.

779
01:01:33,769 --> 01:01:35,349
Oh, to pick up the trash.

780
01:01:36,369 --> 01:01:37,979
l'm leaving if you don't mind.

781
01:01:38,769 --> 01:01:40,910
Just a moment. All right. Go pick it up.

782
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:43,549
lt's in the kitchen, under the sink.

783
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:47,600
No, don't take off your shoes.

784
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:48,570
Are you leaving?

785
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:50,849
Yeah. Call me
and we'll arrange for tomorrow.

786
01:01:51,288 --> 01:01:53,499
Sir, please let me remove the trash
from the elevator.

787
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:55,510
- No problem. Let it stay.
- But it's messy.

788
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:57,019
Don't worry.

789
01:01:58,090 --> 01:01:58,609
Bye.

790
01:01:58,889 --> 01:02:00,220
Give my regards to your Mrs.

791
01:02:00,609 --> 01:02:04,090
Listen...
What time shall we meet tomorrow?

792
01:02:04,769 --> 01:02:06,701
Will you call?

793
01:02:07,169 --> 01:02:09,200
Call me tomorrow when you wake up.

794
01:02:09,689 --> 01:02:11,550
We'll arrange to meet and review...

795
01:02:13,729 --> 01:02:16,499
- Where's the trash?
- Over there, under the sink.

796
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:18,720
- This is it?
- That's all.

797
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:21,230
- Anything on the balcony?
- No, nothing.

798
01:02:24,009 --> 01:02:25,938
So l'll wait for your call...

799
01:02:26,529 --> 01:02:29,160
l'll be awake...

800
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:32,659
Your camera is ON, Mr. Panahi.

801
01:02:33,089 --> 01:02:34,349
No problem.

802
01:02:34,969 --> 01:02:38,019
Let me go first.
You go later. That stinks.

803
01:02:38,689 --> 01:02:40,019
Then let me take that out.

804
01:02:40,409 --> 01:02:41,418
No need.
There's a lead on it.

805
01:02:41,768 --> 01:02:42,288
Bye.

806
01:02:42,569 --> 01:02:44,530
Please press
the button to return to floor 9.

807
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:47,919
Thanks a lot.
Is this also trash, Mr. Panahi?

808
01:02:48,569 --> 01:02:53,070
No, that's a music player
for someone to pick up.

809
01:02:54,329 --> 01:02:56,149
Are you shooting, Mr. Panahi?

810
01:02:56,608 --> 01:03:00,399
Let me put on a decent shirt at least.

811
01:03:04,609 --> 01:03:06,609
Are you filling in for the custodian?

812
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:11,870
Yes. My sister,
Nasrin is going to have a baby...

813
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:15,780
- Oh, yes. They've gone to Isfahan.
- Yes.

814
01:03:16,329 --> 01:03:19,520
They like their child to be from Isfahan.

815
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:24,099
But what do you do here in Tehran?
Are you a custodian somewhere else?

816
01:03:24,849 --> 01:03:27,309
No, l'm only filling in
for Akbar for a few days.

817
01:03:28,729 --> 01:03:30,938
l mean what's your job?

818
01:03:31,409 --> 01:03:34,640
ln fact, l do all kinds of things,
but l study on the side, too.

819
01:03:35,609 --> 01:03:36,590
- Study?
- Yes.

820
01:03:38,409 --> 01:03:39,458
Where at?

821
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:42,780
Art University.

822
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:44,609
Are you a university student?

823
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:46,299
- Yes.
- Good.

824
01:03:46,688 --> 01:03:47,389
Thanks a lot.

825
01:03:47,688 --> 01:03:48,850
What field?

826
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:51,430
l study Arts Research.

827
01:03:52,169 --> 01:03:53,249
Research...

828
01:03:54,329 --> 01:03:54,989
Arts Research.

829
01:03:55,288 --> 01:03:57,570
- So you're studying for master's?
- Yes.

830
01:03:58,249 --> 01:03:59,050
Good.

831
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:04,669
l don't look like it in these clothes.
This is my work dress.

832
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:08,280
l'm here to pick up the trash,
so l thought they might get dirty.

833
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:11,640
l guess he forgot...

834
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:14,070
His face looked familiar to me.

835
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:17,169
lsn't he the same guy
who acted in ''Red-Hat''?

836
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:18,810
No way.

837
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:20,858
He looked quite similar...

838
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:23,328
l thought it was him,
but without mustache.

839
01:04:23,808 --> 01:04:26,129
He's a friend...

840
01:04:27,929 --> 01:04:29,469
and a documentary filmmaker.

841
01:04:29,889 --> 01:04:32,939
He's Mr. Mirtahmasb
who makes documentary films.

842
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,919
He has a few good documentaries too.

843
01:04:36,409 --> 01:04:38,199
We were just talking.

844
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:40,649
No, we were not working.

845
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:44,059
Oh, l thought he was here to audition.

846
01:04:44,728 --> 01:04:47,329
l thought l jumped in your film
all of a sudden...

847
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:50,379
By the way,
there's a high quality camera over there,

848
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,719
and you're shooting with this?

849
01:04:53,168 --> 01:04:54,149
What's wrong with this?

850
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:55,499
The professional camera
is over there.

851
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,320
You mean you don't like this one?

852
01:04:57,729 --> 01:04:59,519
l have one in my pocket, too.
Here it is.

853
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:01,789
Do you think
l can make a film with this?

854
01:05:02,249 --> 01:05:04,809
You can certainly make
a film with it, of course.

855
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:07,899
OK then. Just a moment...

856
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:09,870
Let me get the other one.

857
01:05:12,769 --> 01:05:14,519
Shall l take the trash downstairs?

858
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:16,201
Wait. l'll come, too.

859
01:05:17,728 --> 01:05:19,058
Wait...

860
01:05:20,369 --> 01:05:22,328
Let me take the trash downstairs.

861
01:05:23,729 --> 01:05:24,499
And what to do next?

862
01:05:24,809 --> 01:05:27,268
Wow... My God!
That's awesome.

863
01:05:27,808 --> 01:05:30,059
Let's go. Take those as well.
l'm coming with you.

864
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:31,370
Let me go in first.

865
01:05:31,689 --> 01:05:34,078
- Let me take them out. They stink.
- No, that's OK.

866
01:05:34,648 --> 01:05:37,769
You're making an actor out of me.
But one of those who will get embarrassed.

867
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:39,640
No, don't say that.

868
01:05:40,010 --> 01:05:40,780
Excuse me.

869
01:05:43,969 --> 01:05:45,970
Well, l had never seen you here before.

870
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:47,850
Why? l come here a lot.

871
01:05:49,729 --> 01:05:53,729
l've come here at least
20 or 25 times so far.

872
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:58,499
At least.

873
01:05:58,849 --> 01:06:00,919
Don't you have anything else to do?

874
01:06:01,809 --> 01:06:02,579
Excuse me.

875
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:06,420
Yes, l do have other things to do.
But this is part of what l do.

876
01:06:07,051 --> 01:06:08,169
My sister needs...

877
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:09,859
Do you get paid for this?

878
01:06:10,249 --> 01:06:13,269
No, this is just helping Akbar and Nasrin.
You know...

879
01:06:13,851 --> 01:06:15,809
How do you pay for your education?

880
01:06:16,248 --> 01:06:16,949
l work.

881
01:06:17,248 --> 01:06:18,188
What work?

882
01:06:18,529 --> 01:06:19,469
All kinds of work.

883
01:06:20,049 --> 01:06:20,820
For example...

884
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:22,890
l'll be right back and tell

885
01:06:25,449 --> 01:06:28,499
The trash will stink
if it stays inside the building.

886
01:06:29,169 --> 01:06:32,998
Different jobs, like distributing fliers,
working in a textile factory.

887
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:35,200
We're on 7th, going to 6th.

888
01:06:35,609 --> 01:06:40,109
l work in a textile factory,
as a courier on bike, on taxi,...

889
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:43,850
l was designing commercial ads
for a while, too.

890
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:49,159
Any idea what it's like
to work in a textile factory?

891
01:06:49,729 --> 01:06:53,840
lt means you spend away your lungs,
you waste your ears,

892
01:06:54,609 --> 01:06:57,280
that's how noisy it is.
l didn't last 6 months there.

893
01:06:57,809 --> 01:07:01,879
Why don't you work in the same field
as you are studying?

894
01:07:05,249 --> 01:07:08,059
There's no trash on this floor...
l do work in my field of study, too.

895
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:09,280
Well...

896
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:11,741
But it all depends, you know.

897
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:13,760
Sometimes there is work

898
01:07:14,129 --> 01:07:16,869
and they need ads,
and other times they don't need.

899
01:07:17,449 --> 01:07:21,169
lt's not like a full-time job.

900
01:07:21,889 --> 01:07:23,538
Nothing is sure about it.

901
01:07:31,489 --> 01:07:34,510
l don't understand
why there's no trash tonight.

902
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:37,539
We're on 5th, going to 4th.

903
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:40,919
lt feels like l went on a trip with you,
Mr. Panahi...

904
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,459
a trip with a bad smell.

905
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:49,169
The night they stormed in here,
l was here too.

906
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:51,240
- Really?
- l swear to God.

907
01:07:51,649 --> 01:07:52,519
You were here?

908
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:57,010
l come here often to take a bath
that's why.

909
01:07:57,689 --> 01:07:59,970
There's no bathroom in our dorm.

910
01:08:02,209 --> 01:08:04,950
l come here to my sister's place
to take a bath.

911
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:08,820
Then all of a sudden they knocked and...

912
01:08:10,371 --> 01:08:13,528
l went to the door instead of Akbar...

913
01:08:15,009 --> 01:08:15,878
Excuse me.

914
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:20,368
Knock on their door.
Maybe they have trash inside.

915
01:08:20,849 --> 01:08:22,708
But l know, Mr. Panahi...

916
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:28,469
They'll leave it outside if they have any.

917
01:08:29,248 --> 01:08:31,600
Otherwise they won't leave
anything outside.

918
01:08:32,129 --> 01:08:36,269
This means they are all gone
for Fireworks tonight.

919
01:08:37,408 --> 01:08:38,919
Let me see...

920
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:41,829
Oh, no!
The people on the second floor!

921
01:08:42,329 --> 01:08:42,890
Why?

922
01:08:43,129 --> 01:08:44,668
Now they're going to have
20 boxes of pizza.

923
01:08:45,089 --> 01:08:46,350
l used to work for delivery service

924
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:48,239
and l used to deliver pizza for them
every 10 minutes.

925
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:50,819
l don't understand
how they eat all that pizza.

926
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:54,140
Wait a second.

927
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:00,811
These guys always have trash.

928
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:10,529
Hello.

929
01:09:12,089 --> 01:09:13,318
l'll call you in a minute.

930
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:15,239
Bring over your trash.

931
01:09:16,249 --> 01:09:16,949
Trash?

932
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:20,618
Are you staying home tonight?

933
01:09:21,408 --> 01:09:22,350
l must stay home.

934
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:24,550
No, l mean you aren't
going anywhere tonight?

935
01:09:25,249 --> 01:09:29,009
No, l'll be here almost all night.

936
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:35,128
Could l ask you to keep
Micky for a couple of hours?

937
01:09:35,809 --> 01:09:38,720
Oh my God!
Forget it for God's sake.

938
01:09:39,329 --> 01:09:41,499
Last time you left him with us
for a week.

939
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:42,698
Look at him!

940
01:09:43,009 --> 01:09:44,239
He won't trouble you at all.

941
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:45,959
No, wait for Akbar
to come back.

942
01:09:46,369 --> 01:09:48,690
But there's no one here tonight.
Akbar isn't here either.

943
01:09:49,249 --> 01:09:50,480
Leave him with Mr. Panahi.

944
01:09:50,809 --> 01:09:53,020
l did leave him with Mr. Panahi.

945
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:56,289
He didn't last more than 2 minutes.

946
01:09:57,890 --> 01:09:59,819
Look. l must go now...

947
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:03,340
He won't bother you at all.

948
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:05,159
God knows if there was a way...

949
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:08,289
Either l'm going to die
till morning, or Micky will!

950
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:10,748
l'll be back in 2 hours.

951
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,489
Bring your trash out please.

952
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,559
Then you'll keep him?

953
01:10:15,929 --> 01:10:17,998

957
01:10:24,089 --> 01:10:24,998
Thanks a lot.

958
01:10:28,610 --> 01:10:32,259
- Did you see the dog?
- Why did you mention me?

959
01:10:34,208 --> 01:10:37,789
He'll be nice subject for you.

960
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,140
She's asking me to go inside

961
01:10:48,769 --> 01:10:49,709
and pick it up!

962
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:57,510
Please don't throw any cans in the bag.

963
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:00,919
- Last time they cut my hand.
- Sure. l apologise.

964
01:11:01,369 --> 01:11:02,140

So l'll bring him in the lobby.

01:11:04,521 --> 01:11:05,390
OK.

967
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:08,389
Some dog it is!

968
01:11:08,769 --> 01:11:11,680
So, you were here
when they came that night?

969
01:11:13,129 --> 01:11:14,708
Yes, they knocked...

970
01:11:16,288 --> 01:11:19,550
and l went to the door for Akbar...

971
01:11:20,249 --> 01:11:22,318
Excuse me,
Iet me pick this up.

972
01:11:30,809 --> 01:11:32,909
l arrived at the door...

973
01:11:33,409 --> 01:11:35,060
Wait a second...

974
01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:43,090
l arrived there that night...

975
01:11:47,128 --> 01:11:50,459
l think it was between 8 and 10 o'clock.
l don't remember exactly.

976
01:11:51,169 --> 01:11:54,360
l only remember
l was just out of the bath and l was wet.

977
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:59,430
They were knocking,
and l went to the door.

978
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:06,449
Excuse me, Mr. Panahi.

979
01:12:08,849 --> 01:12:12,748
This story is a distraction.

980
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:15,059
OK. Never mind that now.

981
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:17,329
lt's not just one or 2 floors.

982
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:19,590
When l opened the door...

983
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:21,859
OK, When are you going
to finish your studies?

984
01:12:22,889 --> 01:12:24,329
l'm in second term.

985
01:12:30,248 --> 01:12:31,970
You step outside,
so you don't get dirty.

986
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:33,810
No, you go first. l'll follow you.

987
01:12:34,209 --> 01:12:35,050
Excuse me.

988
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:41,249
What are you going to do
when you finish school?

989
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:44,260
After l finish school
l have lots of things to do.

990
01:12:45,128 --> 01:12:47,020
You know what l'll do first thing?

991
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:52,340
First, l'll be looking
to find a place to have peace.

992
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:55,289
l'll go in nature for a month.

993
01:12:56,730 --> 01:13:00,380
l'll get away from the motorbikes,
pollution, traffic, trash...

994
01:13:01,091 --> 01:13:02,459
and Micky...

995
01:13:03,090 --> 01:13:04,319
l'll get away from all that.

996
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:07,220
But do you know what's the worst of all?

997
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:11,528
The worst thing is that you graduate
with a master's degree and...

998
01:13:12,208 --> 01:13:14,350
then there's no job for you.

999
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:27,958
Mr. Panahi, please don't come outside.
They'll see you with the camera.

1000
01:14:04,689 --> 01:14:07,809
THIS IS NOT A FILM

1001
01:14:09,328 --> 01:14:14,600
