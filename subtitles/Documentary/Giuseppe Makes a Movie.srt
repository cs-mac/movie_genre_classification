Let me go!

3
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,379
Let go, you sons of bitches.

4
00:01:14,723 --> 00:01:16,390
Stop!

5
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:06,071
ROUGH CUT

7
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:38,800
Boss.

8
00:03:42,037 --> 00:03:44,865
Boss, where have you been?
I've called you many times.

9
00:03:45,707 --> 00:03:46,931
Let's go.

10
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:52,313
Is it true that you hit him?

11
00:03:52,314 --> 00:03:54,549
He committed no violent act.
Please step aside.

12
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,385
Did your counterpart actor
really fall down the stairs?

13
00:03:56,386 --> 00:04:00,690
Please make a comment, Mr. Jang!

14
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:02,825
No, no!
Please step aside.

15
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,091
Tell us what exactly happened.

16
00:04:06,795 --> 00:04:10,500
Your face is what makes you money,
so stop spitting on it.

17
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,760
Know how much it cost
to shut people up?

18
00:04:14,803 --> 00:04:17,369
An article not going out
isn't the end.

19
00:04:18,006 --> 00:04:21,539
If bad rumors get out,
people will turn on you.

20
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:26,082
We'd have to stop shooting
if Sung-min hadn't agreed to act.

21
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,945
That's why I have you, right?

22
00:04:31,253 --> 00:04:33,444
You despiteful bastard.

23
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:36,248
Who were you with this time?

24
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:40,521
Anyway, there weren't
that many reporters.

25
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:43,359
Is that all I'm worth?

26
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,198
We're not made for each other.

27
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:50,872
Watch how you drive, idiot.

28
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,064
You think an agent
only drives and takes calls?

29
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:56,537
This job isn't a hobby.
Put some heart into it.

30
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:04,814
If I add up all the shares,
it will come out 23.08%%%.

31
00:05:07,823 --> 00:05:10,514
Why are you looking at me like that?

32
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:16,299
- 23.08%% %? Are you sure?
- What are you talking about?

33
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,659
Is what you're saying true?

34
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:20,970
Don't play around
with the Chairman's money.

35
00:05:20,971 --> 00:05:23,471
I'm sorry.

36
00:05:23,472 --> 00:05:26,106
You manage Sungwoo Development.

37
00:05:26,408 --> 00:05:28,337
And I manage you.

38
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,136
Don't forget that.

39
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:55,560
- Step aside.
- Yes, sir.

40
00:05:57,673 --> 00:05:59,008
- Hello, boss.
- Hello, sir.

41
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:00,266
Hello, sir.

42
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,672
Where have I seen her before?

43
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:04,579
Is she a new girl?

44
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,408
Don't you know the actress,
Kang Mi-na?

45
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:10,820
- Actress?
- Yes, she's going to be in a new movie.

46
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:12,886
She's with the director and actor now.

47
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:15,155
Actor Jang Soo-ta is inside.

48
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,221
Don't you like Soo-ta, sir?

49
00:06:19,027 --> 00:06:21,464
- Shall I bring him here?
- Will he listen to you?

50
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:22,430
Well...

51
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:24,365
Don't be stupid and just drink.

52
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:26,864
If I go,
I bet I could bring him here.

53
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:30,360
Then go.

54
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,909
- Sir?
- Go get his autograph.

55
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,739
Autograph?
I can get 10 autographs if you want.

56
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:43,110
He's a real man.

57
00:06:48,156 --> 00:06:49,789
He told you to come in person.

58
00:06:50,158 --> 00:06:51,916
I knew he'd fail.

59
00:06:52,894 --> 00:06:54,789
Tell them to bring in the girls.

60
00:06:57,766 --> 00:06:59,126
You go instead.

61
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:01,233
Sir?

62
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:05,074
Please stop, Mr. Bong.

63
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:06,807
Like this.

64
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:09,228
Really aggressive,

65
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,222
like a dog fight.

66
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,147
Please stop Mr. Bong.

67
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:15,217
Then shall I hit him for real?

68
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:16,611
That would be nice.

69
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:20,344
You take me too seriously.

70
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,917
I heard you know how to fight.

71
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:25,921
Is what the paper said true?

72
00:07:26,828 --> 00:07:30,700
People said that he didn't just fall
down the stairs, but you had hit him.

73
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:34,302
Then why'd you agree
to take this role?

74
00:07:35,704 --> 00:07:39,135
To be honest, I don't care.

75
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:42,611
- You can't go inside.
- Move.

76
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:43,937
You're here again?

77
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:51,443
Sign this.

78
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:56,186
- Are you my fan?
- Not me.

79
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,528
Then tell him to come in person.

80
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:00,888
He's got no legs?

81
00:08:08,804 --> 00:08:11,404
You're a fucking big shot.

82
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:20,712
He seemed to be a real gangster.
Shall we change rooms?

83
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:24,053
Why? Did we do something wrong?

84
00:08:24,054 --> 00:08:26,188
You sure do have diverse fans.

85
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:28,455
Just pick out the seeds, idiot.

86
00:08:31,126 --> 00:08:33,329
Mr. Bong, I'm tired,
so I'll be going home now.

87
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,757
See you at the set.

88
00:08:37,632 --> 00:08:39,666
Shall I go kick some ass?

89
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,833
Kick whose ass, idiot?

90
00:08:42,337 --> 00:08:46,166
- You just stay put.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:08:51,413 --> 00:08:53,080
Mr. Bong, what are you doing?
Give it to me.

92
00:08:53,081 --> 00:08:56,018
Leave it to me.
I'm an expert at this.

93
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:58,243
But you're drunk.

94
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,978
What's the meaning of this?

95
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:12,363
Wow.

96
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:17,864
You look exactly like you do
in the movies.

97
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:22,067
I've seen all your movies.

98
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:31,680
Please sign your autograph.

99
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,791
You must like movies a lot.

100
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:40,393
Well, I dreamed of becoming
an actor once.

101
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:43,397
But life had its up and downs.

102
00:09:43,398 --> 00:09:45,896
- Actor?
- I played a role in a movie once.

103
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,836
An actor isn't for everyone.

104
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:52,061
Name?

105
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:54,165
Gang-pae.

106
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:58,171
Gang-pae?
Not 'Gang-ster'?

107
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:01,115
Why?

108
00:10:02,617 --> 00:10:04,045
Is my name weird?

109
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:09,582
Why waste your short life like that?

110
00:10:13,528 --> 00:10:15,764
Wouldn't it be embarrassing
to your kids later?

111
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:17,565
Watch your mouth.

112
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:20,599
Just because he jokes with you
doesn't mean you can joke back.

113
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:36,282
You got the appearance down.

114
00:10:37,352 --> 00:10:41,147
But you should do it
in front of the camera.

115
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,090
Isn't acting all fake anyway?

116
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:54,570
Do you even know what acting is?

117
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,370
What's there to it?

118
00:10:56,371 --> 00:11:01,372
You get lucky in life
and then comfortably imitate people.

119
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:07,307
How about a handshake?

120
00:11:10,218 --> 00:11:12,682
This place really sucks.

121
00:11:29,538 --> 00:11:32,969
Soo-ta, you definitely have charisma.

122
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,565
I'm getting sober.

123
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:38,913
Those bastards talk tough,

124
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:40,741
but they're nothing
when it's one on one.

125
00:11:41,349 --> 00:11:43,676
But I liked that guy's image.

126
00:11:50,992 --> 00:11:53,963
You bastards,
who do you fucking think you are?

127
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:54,862
What now?

128
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:57,531
Now that you're famous you think
you can do anything you want?

129
00:11:57,933 --> 00:12:00,727
Don't laugh asshole.
Otherwise, I'll rip your jaw out.

130
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:02,666
Morons.

131
00:12:03,405 --> 00:12:05,873
What did you say?

132
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:07,837
Leave before I call the police.

133
00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:13,642
You guys need to get hit
to register things.

134
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:15,147
You bastard.

135
00:12:16,017 --> 00:12:17,343
Screw this.

136
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:28,295
Ruining an actor's face
means the end for him.

137
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,726
But he kept...

138
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,699
That's why you hear people
call you trash.

139
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:23,540
Use this for your friend's
medical bills.

140
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:28,416
You don't trust a gangster's money?

141
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,202
Apologize.

142
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,477
- You fucking asshole!
- Wait!

143
00:13:53,982 --> 00:13:56,085
- Please don't do this!
- Let go!

144
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,218
Don't.

145
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:03,486
That was very real.

146
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,388
It sent chills down my spine.

147
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,533
We will escort you home, sir.

148
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:19,700
Boss, you don't trust us?

149
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:33,852
Hey.

150
00:14:34,422 --> 00:14:35,486
Fucking idiot.

151
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,183
You think you're worth
talking to the boss?

152
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:02,108
'You rotten assholes! '

153
00:15:03,785 --> 00:15:05,953
I'm not getting my lines right.

154
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:19,525
'That's why you hear people
call you trash. '

155
00:15:23,538 --> 00:15:25,831
'That's why you hear people
call you trash! '

156
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:09,081
'Why waste your short life like that? '

157
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:21,964
I've collected what I could.

158
00:16:21,965 --> 00:16:25,224
What's your religion?

159
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:27,826
I don't have one.

160
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:36,876
Does it make sense
that you don't have a religion?

161
00:16:40,315 --> 00:16:43,575
Tell me what you believe in.

162
00:16:44,485 --> 00:16:46,550
I believe in you, Mr. Park.

163
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:56,286
I want Chairman Baek to get released
quickly more than anyone.

164
00:16:56,731 --> 00:16:59,559
We've known each other
for a long time.

165
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:05,597
Please help us until the trial.

166
00:17:06,307 --> 00:17:09,670
Take that with you.

167
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:12,341
You need to believe in something.

168
00:17:21,856 --> 00:17:24,293
I've been troublesome
whenever you come visit.

169
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,687
Not at all, sir.

170
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:27,761
Did you meet Mr. Park?

171
00:17:27,762 --> 00:17:31,333
Yes, but I couldn't sound him out.

172
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:33,800
Don't worry.

173
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:36,697
He doesn't have any concrete evidence.

174
00:17:37,138 --> 00:17:39,738
- Is it my turn?
- Yes, sir.

175
00:17:43,745 --> 00:17:45,071
Here.

176
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:55,112
Just do whatever he wants.

177
00:17:56,925 --> 00:17:59,061
Money isn't the problem now.

178
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:00,694
Yes, sir.

179
00:18:06,534 --> 00:18:07,928
I caught this one.

180
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:15,544
Don't cause any trouble
until the trial.

181
00:18:15,545 --> 00:18:16,576
Yes, sir.

182
00:18:16,577 --> 00:18:20,736
Don't trust your boys
too much, either.

183
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,677
I want to see your face.

184
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,038
Stop!

185
00:19:07,962 --> 00:19:09,254
Are you crazy?

186
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:12,032
What if somebody sees us?

187
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:15,168
Are you that afraid
of someone seeing?

188
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:20,397
What's wrong with you?

189
00:19:20,842 --> 00:19:23,010
I can't even see your face.
What is this?

190
00:19:24,445 --> 00:19:25,907
You know how things are.

191
00:19:26,314 --> 00:19:31,076
Have you thought about things
from my perspective?

192
00:19:32,086 --> 00:19:39,249
I can't even have coffee with you
at a café like other couples.

193
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:44,681
Are you embarrassed of me?

194
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:46,231
What are you talking about?

195
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:49,161
Come here. I missed you.

196
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:51,902
I'm not a prostitute.

197
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:55,599
It's been a year already.

198
00:19:57,545 --> 00:19:59,542
I've been patient long enough.

199
00:20:00,014 --> 00:20:01,494
So what do you want me
to do about it?

200
00:20:02,016 --> 00:20:06,119
You know how much reporters
like to exaggerate rumors?

201
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,414
If your face gets out,
you'll never be able to get married.

202
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:12,191
Selfish bastard.

203
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:14,894
Don't be so indecent.

204
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:20,257
Isn't what we're doing more indecent?

205
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,970
Then just go.

206
00:21:00,408 --> 00:21:01,575
Cut!

207
00:21:02,944 --> 00:21:04,133
Damn!

208
00:21:05,813 --> 00:21:08,582
Come on, that looked too fake.

209
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:12,654
How could you fall before he hits you?

210
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:14,287
Then, Sung-min.

211
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:17,116
Your punches need to be closer
for it to look real.

212
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:22,030
Don't punch the air.
You need to aim accurately.

213
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,891
Do it more realistically.

214
00:21:24,132 --> 00:21:25,856
- Sound!
- Speed.

215
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:28,992
Camera!
Action!

216
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,572
Cut!
Are you okay?

217
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:42,746
God damn!

218
00:21:46,921 --> 00:21:50,181
Sorry, I got too absorbed into it.

219
00:21:51,392 --> 00:21:52,752
Let's do it again.

220
00:21:53,227 --> 00:21:54,519
Ready!

221
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,155
Try to be careful.

222
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,089
Action!

223
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:11,976
Cut!

224
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:16,742
Are you okay?

225
00:22:17,718 --> 00:22:19,487
Soo-ta, what's wrong?

226
00:22:19,488 --> 00:22:20,711
Are you okay?

227
00:22:21,422 --> 00:22:24,489
I must've been too nervous.

228
00:22:24,992 --> 00:22:26,750
Let's not screw up this take.

229
00:22:28,162 --> 00:22:30,114
- Let's go again.
- Okay.

230
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,998
Sorry, but don't get upset

231
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:35,337
whether you get hit once or twice.

232
00:22:35,338 --> 00:22:36,527
Step aside!

233
00:22:37,738 --> 00:22:39,206
You'll lose weight if you keep this up.

234
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:41,943
For the sake of this movie,
nothing's a waste to me.

235
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,977
Doesn't seem so wasteful to me.

236
00:22:43,978 --> 00:22:47,011
It's not even your shoot today,
so why are you here?

237
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:52,246
Mi-na, do you like me by any chance?

238
00:22:54,755 --> 00:22:55,655
Ready.

239
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:58,950
Don't mind the director.
Just don't overdo it.

240
00:23:00,061 --> 00:23:01,421
I'm sorry.

241
00:23:02,997 --> 00:23:04,164
Action!

242
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:20,037
I told you not to overdo it!

243
00:23:20,715 --> 00:23:22,644
Yes, I like the expression.

244
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,823
Is it that hard not to overdo it?

245
00:23:33,824 --> 00:23:35,518
Don't you know what overdo means?

246
00:23:42,536 --> 00:23:44,170
Hurry up!
Save him!

247
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:46,669
Get the first-aid kit!
No, call an ambulance!

248
00:23:52,613 --> 00:23:54,949
How could you hit him for real?

249
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,377
This is a movie!

250
00:23:56,817 --> 00:23:58,484
This is so frustrating.

251
00:24:00,388 --> 00:24:02,385
Jang Soo-ta Assaults
Actor During Shoot!

252
00:24:14,302 --> 00:24:15,435
No Visitors

253
00:24:15,436 --> 00:24:18,503
Take care of yourself.
No, please don't get up.

254
00:24:21,942 --> 00:24:26,101
You're lucky he didn't press charges.
What the hell's wrong with you?

255
00:24:27,748 --> 00:24:28,972
I don't know, either.

256
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:33,510
There are a few reporters
and Sung-min's fans outside.

257
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:36,586
You call this a 'few'?

258
00:24:39,026 --> 00:24:40,060
There he is!

259
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,661
Is the movie called off?

260
00:24:41,662 --> 00:24:44,353
Please make a statement.
Was it deliberate?

261
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:49,502
Apologize! Apologize!

262
00:24:49,503 --> 00:24:50,704
How do you feel now?

263
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:54,923
I am deeply sorry for upsetting

264
00:24:54,924 --> 00:24:59,274
Sung-min and Sung-min's fans.

265
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:05,810
- Show your sincere apology!
- You trash!

266
00:25:07,922 --> 00:25:13,693
Apologize! Apologize!

267
00:25:13,694 --> 00:25:16,431
Fuck.
Which bitch threw the flour?

268
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,622
Soo-ta! Soo-ta!

269
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:21,127
Please make a statement.

270
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:24,283
Apologize! Apologize!

271
00:25:24,284 --> 00:25:26,530
I won't apologize!

272
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:30,104
Edit that! Call me later!

273
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,218
Where are you going?

274
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:40,121
The meeting for the commercial shoot.

275
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,084
Forget already?

276
00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:45,588
You don't need to go today.

277
00:25:48,796 --> 00:25:49,963
Why not?

278
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:53,089
They changed the actor.

279
00:25:56,704 --> 00:25:58,269
Wear a hat if you're going outside.

280
00:25:59,607 --> 00:26:01,087
Did I commit some crime or something?

281
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:03,506
You ignorant bastard.

282
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,675
Hey, I told you to put on a hat.

283
00:26:23,397 --> 00:26:25,121
You're lucky to be alive.

284
00:26:25,466 --> 00:26:26,690
None.

285
00:26:27,902 --> 00:26:29,694
No actor wants to join us.

286
00:26:30,938 --> 00:26:32,799
Please don't take pictures.

287
00:26:37,445 --> 00:26:41,748
People say that
you can't transform your acting.

288
00:26:41,749 --> 00:26:46,120
They say you live out your characters,
but I disagree.

289
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:48,413
I think you have great potential.

290
00:26:48,923 --> 00:26:50,715
What bastard said that?

291
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,658
First time you've heard that?
Just ignore it.

292
00:26:57,765 --> 00:26:59,133
I told you not to take pictures!

293
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:02,001
What an asshole.

294
00:27:02,002 --> 00:27:04,488
Yeah, I'm an asshole, so what?

295
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,906
Stop it or else he'll hit you.

296
00:27:06,907 --> 00:27:10,873
Damn it, it took me six years
to prepare for this movie.

297
00:27:12,546 --> 00:27:15,250
If I can finish this,
I'll dance naked in the street.

298
00:27:15,251 --> 00:27:17,250
Stay on schedule.

299
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:19,018
But I don't have an actor.

300
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:21,517
I'll promise to bring one
to you myself.

301
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:27,087
Delicious.

302
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:30,988
Fuck.

303
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:33,088
It's me.

304
00:27:33,801 --> 00:27:38,233
Remember you said you wanted to be
in a movie with me before?

305
00:27:39,006 --> 00:27:40,195
Yeah.

306
00:27:40,774 --> 00:27:41,963
No?

307
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,478
It's no big deal.

308
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:48,147
Okay, talk to you later.

309
00:27:49,817 --> 00:27:51,541
Son of a bitch!

310
00:27:52,353 --> 00:27:54,851
I know he's not working,
so how could he be busy!

311
00:27:55,756 --> 00:27:58,273
Bastard's gotten really big now.

312
00:27:58,274 --> 00:28:00,923
Yeah, see you later.
Goodbye.

313
00:28:02,963 --> 00:28:04,528
There's no one to act.

314
00:28:11,906 --> 00:28:13,130
Hey.

315
00:28:14,675 --> 00:28:16,911
There's one actor.

316
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:18,066
Who?

317
00:28:19,513 --> 00:28:26,321
Rumors have it that his acting
is always the same and he's pompous.

318
00:28:26,322 --> 00:28:28,114
He can't transform his acting.

319
00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:31,291
He's always prone to beat up people.

320
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,825
What an asshole.
How can you act with a bastard like that?

321
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:39,490
Who do you think he is?

322
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:43,458
Never mind.

323
00:28:45,506 --> 00:28:48,107
Just go buy some beer.

324
00:28:48,108 --> 00:28:51,175
But I don't have any money.

325
00:28:53,213 --> 00:28:55,108
You broke bastard.

326
00:29:08,596 --> 00:29:09,820
But this is a check.

327
00:29:16,537 --> 00:29:19,297
Isn't this my money?

328
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,473
It's the money for my medical bills.

329
00:29:22,576 --> 00:29:25,210
Have you lost your mind?

00:29:43,597 --> 00:29:45,162
How'd you know my number?

332
00:29:46,467 --> 00:29:48,018
You wrote it down for me.

333
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,701
You came to return that?

334
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:54,639
No, I changed my mind.

335
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,383
Want to act in a movie?

336
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,282
Movie?

337
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:05,417
I thought you wanted to act in one.

338
00:30:05,986 --> 00:30:07,983
Why? Now you don't?

339
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:13,157
It's a gangster movie
with some fight scenes between us.

340
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:16,964
I lose a few times at first,
but then I win later.

341
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:19,799
Of course that's a given
since I'm the lead actor.

342
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:26,305
Do I look that free to you?

343
00:30:28,242 --> 00:30:29,602
Forget it if you don't want to.

344
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:45,886
Is that convertible your car?

345
00:30:46,894 --> 00:30:48,425
Convertible car?

346
00:30:49,263 --> 00:30:52,159
Yes.
Is that important now?

347
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,331
Nice car.

348
00:30:55,869 --> 00:30:57,331
You're getting a ticket.

349
00:30:59,139 --> 00:31:00,237
What?

350
00:31:02,676 --> 00:31:05,504
Does that bastard know how much
that windshield costs?

351
00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:08,138
Take that ticket off, you bastard!

352
00:31:09,116 --> 00:31:11,511
I told that asshole to stick
next to the car.

353
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:16,781
But why me,
when you have so many actors?

354
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,360
What?

355
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,055
The concept for this movie is realism.

356
00:31:28,368 --> 00:31:29,899
What's the real reason?

357
00:31:33,373 --> 00:31:36,007
I told you that
the movie's concept is realism.

358
00:31:46,153 --> 00:31:48,412
I sent two actors to the hospital.

359
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,685
So no one wants to play against me.

360
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:00,832
You hit them for real?

361
00:32:07,474 --> 00:32:11,075
Then how about we do it for real, too?

362
00:32:11,578 --> 00:32:12,710
What?

363
00:32:13,747 --> 00:32:16,882
Let's do the action scenes for real.

364
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,938
You can't shoot movies like that.

365
00:32:22,939 --> 00:32:25,989
Then go if you're scared to do so.

366
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:28,628
Then...

367
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:34,466
Go with the script for the last scene.

368
00:32:37,404 --> 00:32:39,504
Then all you need to do is win.

369
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,532
I can't fake things.

370
00:32:42,142 --> 00:32:43,969
That's your expertise.

371
00:32:55,856 --> 00:32:58,081
You're smart enough to
memorize the lines, right?

372
00:33:08,335 --> 00:33:11,163
'Why waste your short life like that? '

373
00:33:11,905 --> 00:33:13,697
'Wouldn't it be embarrassing... '

374
00:33:19,146 --> 00:33:22,406
Wait, his lines were in the script.

375
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,210
Funny bastard.

376
00:33:27,221 --> 00:33:30,686
Please step aside.
A little bit more.

377
00:33:36,363 --> 00:33:39,465
Are you out of your mind?

378
00:33:39,466 --> 00:33:42,396
You call this your promise?
Movies aren't a joke.

379
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:44,871
But you liked his image before.

380
00:33:44,872 --> 00:33:49,210
I liked him as a gangster
but not as an actor.

381
00:33:49,211 --> 00:33:51,742
You said you wanted some real action.

382
00:33:56,016 --> 00:33:58,119
Make a decision
after you shoot him.

383
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,513
I give up.

384
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,560
- Why is that guy here?
- 'Do I look funny to you? '

385
00:34:09,529 --> 00:34:11,720
'Does my life look easy to you? '

386
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,439
How about saying it
in a different tone?

387
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:27,173
'Do I look funny to you? '

388
00:34:28,615 --> 00:34:30,476
'Does my life look easy to you? '

389
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,343
I see you've practiced a lot.

390
00:34:34,888 --> 00:34:36,578
What about the ending?

391
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,349
Will the ending be okay?

392
00:34:41,561 --> 00:34:43,092
Just trust him and let's shoot.

393
00:34:45,198 --> 00:34:47,889
- Mr. Bong, I'm leaving now.
- Okay.

394
00:34:54,174 --> 00:34:55,898
What are you doing?

395
00:35:00,647 --> 00:35:03,611
I tried out scene 87.

396
00:35:10,857 --> 00:35:13,321
I tried out scene 87 as well.

397
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:18,156
Don't know whether
this is all acting or for real.

398
00:35:24,037 --> 00:35:25,499
Ready.

399
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,012
How's my hair?

400
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:32,110
Action!

401
00:35:35,215 --> 00:35:36,313
Cut!

402
00:35:38,018 --> 00:35:39,116
Cut!

403
00:35:40,821 --> 00:35:41,787
Cut!

404
00:35:41,788 --> 00:35:42,955
Do it again.

405
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,558
Can't you go any faster?

406
00:35:48,261 --> 00:35:50,361
You're in worse shape than I thought.

407
00:35:56,036 --> 00:35:57,100
Action!

408
00:35:58,939 --> 00:36:00,231
Cut! Cut!

409
00:36:01,274 --> 00:36:02,441
Do it again.

410
00:36:05,312 --> 00:36:07,605
What idiot would run ahead of him?

411
00:36:09,249 --> 00:36:10,969
Let's maintain the distance
and start again.

412
00:36:22,863 --> 00:36:26,300
You're supposed to have spasms
by the scarred eye.

413
00:36:26,301 --> 00:36:29,060
That's the character's trademark.

414
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:36,674
Cut.

415
00:36:41,014 --> 00:36:42,078
Cut.

416
00:36:43,183 --> 00:36:44,247
Cut.

417
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,245
Cut. Do it again.

418
00:36:49,489 --> 00:36:50,689
What now?

419
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:54,849
I'd like your eyes to be more vicious.

420
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,431
Hey, director.

421
00:36:58,432 --> 00:37:00,623
Are you mad at me or something?

422
00:37:01,134 --> 00:37:02,701
Isn't this enough?

423
00:37:02,702 --> 00:37:05,234
Your eyes are perfect now.

424
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:08,231
Shall we stop?

425
00:37:14,147 --> 00:37:15,814
Acting is a piece of cake, right?

426
00:37:16,683 --> 00:37:19,078
Look at the camera and not me.

427
00:37:28,562 --> 00:37:29,694
Cut.

428
00:37:32,532 --> 00:37:33,664
How was he?

429
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:36,161
Not so bad.

430
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:39,634
But wouldn't you be the one
who suffers later?

431
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:44,138
Doesn't seem like it to me.

432
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:48,347
- Where's my right hand man?
- I think he had to leave, sir.

433
00:37:49,816 --> 00:37:52,520
You can't stand movie shoots, too?

434
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:55,849
No, sir, but are you okay?

435
00:37:56,923 --> 00:38:01,389
Don't know whether this is a movie shoot
or some track race.

436
00:38:03,797 --> 00:38:05,931
Man, I'm exhausted.

437
00:38:32,626 --> 00:38:34,316
There will be no problem, sir.

438
00:38:41,868 --> 00:38:47,028
The law is a pain in the ass.
Too many things to check.

439
00:38:50,777 --> 00:38:52,376
Don't worry too much, sir.

440
00:38:52,846 --> 00:38:56,682
You'll be able to come out
once the trial is over.

441
00:38:56,683 --> 00:39:00,910
I don't like the fact
that I'm in the hands of a young boy.

442
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:04,356
But I heard he's very competent
for his age.

443
00:39:04,357 --> 00:39:08,493
All he did was stud law.
What would he know about the world outside?

444
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:20,237
Cut!

445
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,503
Can't you do it more passionately?

446
00:39:25,045 --> 00:39:26,143
Again!

447
00:39:26,546 --> 00:39:28,213
Feels like old times.

448
00:39:29,182 --> 00:39:30,906
Am I supposed to answer that?

449
00:39:33,553 --> 00:39:35,050
Ready!

450
00:39:36,756 --> 00:39:37,945
Action!

451
00:39:57,611 --> 00:39:58,971
I love you.

452
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:13,273
Ki-su released from prison
comes to find Tae-sung.

453
00:40:13,274 --> 00:40:17,289
This is the first fight
so it needs to feel sudden.

454
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:20,499
But are you really doing it for real?

455
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:23,936
Yes.

456
00:40:24,571 --> 00:40:28,642
You have to stop right
after I yell cut.

457
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:29,775
Now, let's shoot.

458
00:40:29,776 --> 00:40:35,447
Don't I need make-up and clothes, too?

459
00:40:35,448 --> 00:40:41,086
We gave you that scar by your eye.
And your clothes look fine.

460
00:40:43,156 --> 00:40:45,688
I've never seen that actor before.

461
00:40:46,593 --> 00:40:48,427
He's not an actor.

462
00:40:48,428 --> 00:40:49,822
What are you talking about?

463
00:40:55,068 --> 00:40:56,462
Ready.

464
00:41:02,609 --> 00:41:03,776
Action!

465
00:41:06,479 --> 00:41:07,839
Are you nervous?

466
00:41:08,415 --> 00:41:09,912
I'll go easy on you.

467
00:41:18,358 --> 00:41:19,658
Cut!

468
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:21,694
Why aren't you fighting?

469
00:41:21,695 --> 00:41:25,132
Soo-ta, you getting scared
comes out directly on the screen.

470
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:26,098
Let's go again.

471
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:28,699
What's wrong? Scared?

472
00:41:29,803 --> 00:41:31,305
Does it look that way?

473
00:41:31,306 --> 00:41:32,738
What if he gets hurt?

474
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:34,640
I don't know.
This is my first time, too.

475
00:41:34,641 --> 00:41:38,902
What will happen to our movie
if the lead actor dies?

476
00:41:40,213 --> 00:41:42,176
You have such a way with words.

477
00:41:43,516 --> 00:41:44,774
Ready.

478
00:41:48,588 --> 00:41:49,755
Action!

479
00:42:08,508 --> 00:42:09,572
Excellent expressions.

480
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,327
More. More.

481
00:42:35,034 --> 00:42:36,132
Cut.

482
00:42:38,638 --> 00:42:39,896
Soo-ta, are you okay?

483
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,838
Get up.

484
00:42:44,244 --> 00:42:45,536
Soo-ta, are you okay?

485
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,481
What about the camera?
Did it look okay?

486
00:42:49,482 --> 00:42:53,550
It looked good because it's real,
but are you able to keep this up?

487
00:42:55,355 --> 00:42:57,921
- I'm okay.
- Okay, then.

488
00:43:01,961 --> 00:43:04,652
- Sound!
- Speed.

489
00:43:05,131 --> 00:43:06,298
Camera!

490
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:08,422
Action!

491
00:43:17,744 --> 00:43:18,808
Cut!

492
00:43:26,786 --> 00:43:29,188
Soo-ta, are you okay?

493
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,790
What the hell is this?
Bring a towel!

494
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:35,927
I told you to stop
right after I yell cut!

495
00:43:36,329 --> 00:43:38,065
I'll talk to you later.

496
00:43:38,066 --> 00:43:40,199
Is this dog shit?

497
00:43:43,036 --> 00:43:47,070
Are you trying to kill somebody
or make a movie?

498
00:43:47,373 --> 00:43:49,541
That's what he wanted.

499
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:52,212
What?
You like beating people up?

500
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,382
Then beat me up!

501
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:56,482
Get up and hit me!

502
00:43:56,483 --> 00:43:58,068
What are you waiting for?

503
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:59,945
- Stop it.
- Let go of me!

504
00:43:59,946 --> 00:44:01,617
Is this guy some thug or what?

505
00:44:01,618 --> 00:44:03,421
Stop!
You're embarrassing me!

506
00:44:04,657 --> 00:44:06,950
What the hell
is in that head of yours?

507
00:44:12,932 --> 00:44:16,499
Worry about me and not the camera.

508
00:44:16,936 --> 00:44:20,765
That's why you're one tempo late.

509
00:44:28,414 --> 00:44:31,674
Does this make any sense?
The director should've stopped him!

510
00:44:32,185 --> 00:44:35,656
But you're the one
who first agreed to do it.

511
00:44:35,657 --> 00:44:36,880
What, you bastard?

512
00:44:38,558 --> 00:44:39,782
Holy shit!

513
00:44:40,593 --> 00:44:44,285
That fucking gangster!

514
00:44:44,731 --> 00:44:47,627
Wouldn't the actors you hit
have felt the same way?

515
00:44:48,601 --> 00:44:49,825
What did you say?

516
00:44:52,372 --> 00:44:54,439
Who'd you ask to see me
all of a sudden?

517
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:00,078
We have to rest a few days anyway
because of your face.

518
00:45:00,847 --> 00:45:04,067
So how's you like getting hit?

519
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:07,419
All I did was go by the script.

520
00:45:08,321 --> 00:45:09,613
Sure.

521
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:14,152
So do you think
you can win in the end?

522
00:45:14,594 --> 00:45:15,818
Of course.

523
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:19,655
If I hadn't become an actor,
I would've fought like you.

524
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:22,101
Really?

525
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:27,331
Real gangsters like us
hear people call us trash.

526
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:33,680
And those like you who can't act at all
hear people call them real actors.

527
00:45:33,681 --> 00:45:35,279
Isn't that funny?

528
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,719
If gangsters were the main characters
of this world,

529
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,910
wouldn't reality be very sad?

530
00:45:41,454 --> 00:45:42,586
Don't you think?

531
00:45:43,189 --> 00:45:47,120
Regular guys are the main characters
of this world.

532
00:45:47,694 --> 00:45:52,922
But if we beat them up in a warehouse,

533
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:56,036
the all piss and shit in their pants.

534
00:45:56,037 --> 00:45:57,704
You think you won't do the same?

535
00:45:57,705 --> 00:45:59,337
Are you threatening me?

536
00:46:03,476 --> 00:46:07,481
You two like drinking with an actor?

537
00:46:07,482 --> 00:46:08,671
Yes!

538
00:46:09,115 --> 00:46:10,543
Then you all pay for the drinks.

539
00:46:11,517 --> 00:46:13,150
- Hey!
- Yes?

540
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:16,750
- Take good care of him tonight.
- Okay.

541
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:21,517
- I don't need it.
- You're so grand.

542
00:46:38,478 --> 00:46:39,576
Who is it?

543
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:41,780
Who?

544
00:46:42,882 --> 00:46:44,106
Yes, Mi-na.

545
00:46:45,184 --> 00:46:46,316
Where?

546
00:46:48,021 --> 00:46:49,119
What?

547
00:46:54,494 --> 00:46:55,922
Mi-na.

548
00:46:57,497 --> 00:46:58,664
Mi-na?

549
00:46:59,732 --> 00:47:00,921
Mi-na?

550
00:47:03,836 --> 00:47:06,334
Let's have a look at your face.

551
00:47:09,442 --> 00:47:12,110
What the hell?

552
00:47:12,111 --> 00:47:16,111
Who the hell are you, asshole?

553
00:47:18,251 --> 00:47:19,584
What was that?

554
00:47:19,585 --> 00:47:22,686
I thought you were tougher,
but that was lame.

555
00:47:22,922 --> 00:47:25,058
We're different from ordinary people.

556
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:26,213
What?

557
00:47:27,827 --> 00:47:30,530
It's a big headache for us
if we beat up anybody.

558
00:47:30,531 --> 00:47:31,993
What were you doing before?

559
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,224
I was on my way to a hotel
with a girl.

560
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,932
I must've intruded.

561
00:47:38,071 --> 00:47:40,102
Well, yes.

562
00:47:53,953 --> 00:47:55,177
Hye-ran, hi.

563
00:47:55,722 --> 00:47:57,622
Were you sleeping?

564
00:47:57,623 --> 00:48:01,094
Su-jung, I just wanted
to drink with you.

565
00:48:01,095 --> 00:48:04,378
No, just go back to sleep.

566
00:48:04,379 --> 00:48:07,793
Don't wake up, damn it.

567
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,333
You must've had a bad day.

568
00:48:14,874 --> 00:48:18,703
There are some things
I can't understand.

569
00:48:20,379 --> 00:48:23,781
He knows nothing and he thinks

570
00:48:23,782 --> 00:48:27,315
he's an actor after a few shoots.

571
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,451
Tell me what you think.

572
00:48:32,258 --> 00:48:35,495
You think a gangster is an actor?

573
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,492
Sorry, I don't understand.

574
00:48:44,737 --> 00:48:46,063
Hello?

575
00:48:48,207 --> 00:48:49,465
Eun-sun?

576
00:48:51,277 --> 00:48:55,675
I just suddenly thought of you.

577
00:48:58,217 --> 00:48:59,577
Want to meet?

578
00:49:00,553 --> 00:49:01,777
No.

579
00:49:04,557 --> 00:49:06,884
I just needed someone to talk to.

580
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:17,703
Hold on.

581
00:49:32,585 --> 00:49:33,717
That was strange.

582
00:49:34,587 --> 00:49:36,345
I thought I heard someone outside.

583
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,092
You really called me out
because you wanted to talk?

584
00:49:45,331 --> 00:49:47,897
What did you want to talk about?

585
00:49:50,469 --> 00:49:53,365
You don't need to know.

586
00:49:54,841 --> 00:49:56,643
You haven't changed at all.

587
00:49:56,644 --> 00:49:58,367
Fuck, what now?

588
00:50:00,279 --> 00:50:01,813
Don't say a word today.

589
00:50:01,814 --> 00:50:03,948
I got enough to deal with besides you.

590
00:50:05,818 --> 00:50:10,785
I wish you'd get ruined.

591
00:50:12,225 --> 00:50:13,824
You're scary.

592
00:50:34,847 --> 00:50:36,071
Isn't that my chair?

593
00:50:37,016 --> 00:50:39,081
Don't you see all these chairs?

594
00:50:39,652 --> 00:50:42,088
I don't like it
when someone sits on my chair.

595
00:50:42,089 --> 00:50:44,347
I wish you'd show a little respect.

596
00:50:53,532 --> 00:50:55,669
This is how far we'll go
in this scene.

597
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:59,254
Soo-ta says 'You want to die? '

598
00:50:59,255 --> 00:51:02,970
And then he puts out his cigarette

599
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,378
in this shot glass.

600
00:51:05,379 --> 00:51:06,511
Action!

601
00:51:12,618 --> 00:51:16,879
Here's the compensation
for your time in jail.

602
00:51:17,823 --> 00:51:19,251
Is this all?

603
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,286
What else do you want?

604
00:51:23,596 --> 00:51:25,263
Everything that's yours.

605
00:51:26,198 --> 00:51:29,526
Even your woman
used to be mine though

606
00:51:30,836 --> 00:51:33,163
How dare you.

607
00:51:42,181 --> 00:51:44,076
You filthy bastard.

608
00:52:04,603 --> 00:52:06,293
Be careful.

609
00:52:06,672 --> 00:52:07,930
Tae-sung.

610
00:52:10,009 --> 00:52:12,302
Cut! You scared me.

611
00:52:14,613 --> 00:52:16,781
Isn't this a real bottle?

612
00:52:16,782 --> 00:52:18,883
Look at the blood on your hand.

613
00:52:18,884 --> 00:52:21,575
Why'd you improvise
something so dangerous?

614
00:52:21,988 --> 00:52:23,989
I thought it would make me
feel better.

615
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:27,887
No, your acting was fantastic.
Better than any good actor.

616
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,989
Soo-ta, you were, uh, good.

617
00:52:33,966 --> 00:52:37,369
Put some medicine on his hand
this instant!

618
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:40,300
Ok! Enough for this scene.
Hurry up for the next take!

619
00:52:55,421 --> 00:52:56,988
Who are you?

620
00:52:56,989 --> 00:52:58,755
What are you doing with my van?

621
00:52:58,756 --> 00:53:00,654
Hello, it's not what you think.

622
00:53:02,495 --> 00:53:04,681
- Why is your van so dirty?
- Who are you?

623
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,833
- Why'd you spit?
- Why are you doing this?

624
00:53:06,834 --> 00:53:09,729
Do what?
You messed with my van.

625
00:53:10,803 --> 00:53:12,163
I caught you red-handed.

626
00:53:18,177 --> 00:53:21,312
We can rent a van
when we make more money.

627
00:53:21,714 --> 00:53:23,541
Drive your car for a while.

628
00:53:26,085 --> 00:53:29,254
You should've told me before
about the situation we were in.

629
00:53:29,822 --> 00:53:31,284
Are you even interested?

630
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:34,626
Do you even know how much

631
00:53:34,627 --> 00:53:37,455
you pay for rent
and your phone bills?

632
00:53:42,101 --> 00:53:45,538
Soo-ta is hard to deal with,
but try to understand him.

633
00:53:45,539 --> 00:53:49,663
He's got a lot of pride
as an actor, though.

634
00:53:50,943 --> 00:53:52,906
You two must've known each other.

635
00:53:54,447 --> 00:53:58,048
We used to date long ago.

636
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:04,252
When I was a first-time actress
a while back.

637
00:54:05,124 --> 00:54:09,158
Don't you feel uncomfortable
when you shoot a movie together?

638
00:54:10,663 --> 00:54:12,228
Not really.

639
00:54:23,642 --> 00:54:27,676
I have something
I'm curious about, too.

640
00:54:29,548 --> 00:54:33,047
Why do you do what you do?

641
00:54:33,452 --> 00:54:34,988
Because I've been doing it
for a while.

642
00:54:34,989 --> 00:54:38,715
Is that all?

643
00:54:41,827 --> 00:54:44,313
You're not going to do it
for real, right?

644
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:49,068
- Do what?
- You know, our scene together.

645
00:54:49,069 --> 00:54:52,499
What exactly?

646
00:54:58,978 --> 00:55:00,145
Who is it?

647
00:55:00,913 --> 00:55:02,603
What problem?

648
00:55:05,484 --> 00:55:08,016
- There's nothing.
- This sucks.

649
00:55:09,288 --> 00:55:10,716
Who called the police?

650
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:15,028
Chairman Baek's wife reported
that her diamond ring was stolen.

651
00:55:15,029 --> 00:55:18,652
The account book and secondary contract
had disappeared.

652
00:55:18,998 --> 00:55:21,699
I should've gotten
rid of them earlier.

653
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:25,918
If it was a real thief,
he wouldn't have stolen them.

654
00:55:25,919 --> 00:55:30,268
If they're used as evidence,
the trial is no use.

655
00:55:30,843 --> 00:55:34,279
That plant-watering,
antique-polishing

656
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,675
bastard betrays me?

657
00:55:39,218 --> 00:55:40,803
Take care of him immediately.

658
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:42,355
It's not a good time now, sir.

659
00:55:42,356 --> 00:55:43,488
Are you scared?

660
00:55:44,757 --> 00:55:48,361
You'd know what to do long ago
just by looking at my eyes.

661
00:55:48,362 --> 00:55:51,519
There's no time to waste.
Do it now.

662
00:55:57,603 --> 00:55:58,701
Hey.

663
00:56:03,409 --> 00:56:04,576
Who the hell are you?

664
00:56:39,445 --> 00:56:40,634
Where's Mr. Park?

665
00:56:42,681 --> 00:56:44,007
Do you like him?

666
00:56:46,185 --> 00:56:48,114
He doesn't seem like a bad person.

667
00:56:51,056 --> 00:56:52,689
How do you know that?

668
00:56:54,593 --> 00:56:56,658
Aren't you misjudging him?

669
00:56:57,630 --> 00:56:59,297
A gangster is nothing but a gangster.

670
00:56:59,298 --> 00:57:01,523
You can't predict
what guys like him will do.

671
00:57:02,768 --> 00:57:04,868
Don't judge people so easily.

672
00:57:10,576 --> 00:57:15,248
We're going to do a long take
with one cut.

673
00:57:15,249 --> 00:57:17,575
And be careful with the sound.

674
00:57:26,592 --> 00:57:29,283
We're not like before, so move aside.

675
00:57:29,795 --> 00:57:31,758
You must be on your way home.

676
00:57:33,232 --> 00:57:35,093
You were with him last night?

677
00:57:35,534 --> 00:57:37,258
Don't be so childish.

678
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:41,708
Then I'll check
what you did last night myself.

679
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:43,493
Let go of me!

680
00:57:43,494 --> 00:57:45,209
Shut the hell up!

681
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:48,345
- Stop it!
- You fucking bitch!

682
00:57:49,415 --> 00:57:50,604
Let go!

683
00:57:52,718 --> 00:57:53,907
Damn it.

684
00:58:08,534 --> 00:58:10,292
Help!

685
00:58:16,475 --> 00:58:17,733
Crazy bastard.

686
00:58:19,645 --> 00:58:21,107
Get out of there!

687
00:58:21,814 --> 00:58:23,481
You rotten filth.

688
00:58:23,749 --> 00:58:25,109
Cut, what's going on?

689
00:58:25,217 --> 00:58:28,648
This isn't acting!
He's doing it for real!

690
00:58:31,056 --> 00:58:33,315
Don't cry and wipe your tears.

691
00:58:39,064 --> 00:58:40,959
Did you do it for real?

692
00:58:42,668 --> 00:58:44,631
Rotten filth?

693
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:11,626
Where is the book and contract?

694
00:59:13,699 --> 00:59:18,427
Did Chairman Baek say he'd spare me
if I tell you?

695
00:59:18,937 --> 00:59:22,629
I promise nothing will happen to you.

696
00:59:23,642 --> 00:59:26,003
You expect me to believe that?

697
01:00:07,723 --> 01:00:08,981
Fuck, give it to me.

698
01:00:12,461 --> 01:00:14,424
What do you want to be later?

699
01:00:15,564 --> 01:00:17,734
Why don't you have something
you're good at?

700
01:00:17,735 --> 01:00:21,035
How can you live without any goals?

701
01:00:21,036 --> 01:00:23,406
What does youth mean
without an ambition?

702
01:00:23,407 --> 01:00:26,439
Again, your bull shit philosophy.

703
01:00:30,346 --> 01:00:32,207
Something good happen to you?

704
01:00:33,849 --> 01:00:36,643
It's you who's had something
good happen.

705
01:00:38,354 --> 01:00:41,387
Since you had a big role
for an extra.

706
01:00:44,293 --> 01:00:45,983
I had a good time watching your movie.

707
01:00:49,498 --> 01:00:52,861
What are you two doing
standing there?

708
01:00:54,003 --> 01:00:55,864
Soo-ta, get ready.

709
01:00:57,906 --> 01:00:59,596
Your acting has gotten a lot better.

710
01:01:01,043 --> 01:01:02,938
You seem like a real actor now.

711
01:01:08,117 --> 01:01:09,341
Action.

712
01:01:10,052 --> 01:01:15,622
Have you ever dreamed once
of something you can't have?

713
01:01:16,558 --> 01:01:19,818
You never wanted to become
someone else?

714
01:01:23,399 --> 01:01:28,764
If I could be you,
I wanted to steal your girl.

715
01:01:32,207 --> 01:01:34,034
Then you'd go off
to a far away place,

716
01:01:35,911 --> 01:01:37,874
and live as if you were dead.

717
01:01:46,555 --> 01:01:49,849
Didn't you say that you'd spare me?

718
01:01:58,801 --> 01:02:01,231
Here's some traveling expenses
on your way.

719
01:02:09,411 --> 01:02:11,602
Then you'd go off
to a far away place,

720
01:02:12,548 --> 01:02:15,945
and live as if you were dead.

721
01:02:16,385 --> 01:02:17,449
Sir.

722
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:19,009
Free him.

723
01:02:19,588 --> 01:02:21,380
If Chairman Baek
finds out about this...

724
01:02:22,591 --> 01:02:24,019
Keep this a secret.

725
01:02:29,832 --> 01:02:31,294
I took care of everything, sir.

726
01:02:31,667 --> 01:02:37,100
Seeing that Mr. Park betrayed me,
I have no one to trust.

727
01:02:43,479 --> 01:02:45,374
How far away is the trial?

728
01:02:47,249 --> 01:02:49,007
Two weeks, sir.

729
01:02:55,891 --> 01:02:57,285
And Mr. Park?

730
01:02:57,793 --> 01:02:59,654
I sent him abroad
without anyone knowing.

731
01:03:00,529 --> 01:03:03,630
We aren't in good circumstances,
so please stop acting.

732
01:03:05,334 --> 01:03:06,694
Is there a problem?

733
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:09,598
Everything's been solved.

734
01:03:11,773 --> 01:03:13,600
You seemed to have changed, sir.

735
01:03:14,843 --> 01:03:16,135
Go.

736
01:03:23,051 --> 01:03:24,843
Why are you so serious?

737
01:03:27,422 --> 01:03:29,817
You have to set up the car like that?

738
01:03:31,093 --> 01:03:33,145
It's safe that way.

739
01:03:33,146 --> 01:03:35,129
Why? Can't stand it?

740
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:39,302
It always seemed strange that the car
is higher than other cars in movies.

741
01:03:39,303 --> 01:03:41,231
Why don't you just direct
the movie yourself?

742
01:03:45,741 --> 01:03:47,208
Here.

743
01:03:47,209 --> 01:03:50,144
I can't trust my agent with it.

744
01:03:50,145 --> 01:03:52,506
Be gentle to it,
it's sensitive like a woman.

745
01:04:09,031 --> 01:04:10,255
Cut! What is this!

746
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:12,832
My car!

747
01:04:14,336 --> 01:04:15,525
My damn car.

748
01:04:16,305 --> 01:04:18,268
That gangster bastard!

749
01:05:21,503 --> 01:05:22,635
Mi-na!

750
01:05:23,372 --> 01:05:24,732
Cut! What is this!

751
01:05:29,511 --> 01:05:31,347
- Sound!
- Speed.

752
01:05:31,348 --> 01:05:32,445
Camera!

753
01:05:33,682 --> 01:05:34,940
Action!

754
01:05:36,551 --> 01:05:39,845
Open your eyes! Open your eyes!

755
01:05:55,537 --> 01:05:57,102
Today is your last day, right?

756
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,633
Yes, I died just now.

757
01:06:01,977 --> 01:06:03,576
I'll come visit the set often.

758
01:06:06,281 --> 01:06:11,919
I'm sorry about being
so rough last time.

759
01:06:14,756 --> 01:06:19,586
Did you really jump in
to save me on purpose?

760
01:06:23,665 --> 01:06:25,127
I didn't see the camera.

761
01:07:17,185 --> 01:07:18,352
Smile.

762
01:07:23,225 --> 01:07:24,619
Do you live here?

763
01:07:25,961 --> 01:07:27,150
I move around.

764
01:07:29,931 --> 01:07:31,792
What happened here?

765
01:07:34,503 --> 01:07:36,034
Don't say anything.

766
01:07:39,441 --> 01:07:45,637
I thought I could understand anyone
when I was young.

767
01:07:48,049 --> 01:07:50,809
But I've lost confidence in it
the more I've gotten older.

768
01:07:59,928 --> 01:08:02,119
Hey, aren't you overdoing it?

769
01:08:04,132 --> 01:08:05,924
You're not even listening to me.

770
01:08:15,277 --> 01:08:16,444
Hey, Soo-ta.

771
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:19,904
Soo-ta!

772
01:08:23,552 --> 01:08:24,650
What?

773
01:08:28,089 --> 01:08:29,290
What's this all about?

774
01:08:29,291 --> 01:08:31,823
If you have a mouth,
then tell me what this is.

775
01:08:34,196 --> 01:08:35,454
I don't know.

776
01:08:37,632 --> 01:08:38,799
You don't know?

777
01:08:40,502 --> 01:08:42,870
Who the hell is this girl?

778
01:08:42,871 --> 01:08:44,595
Just because you don't know
that's it?

779
01:08:44,706 --> 01:08:46,707
Stop it! I'm going nuts, too!

780
01:08:46,708 --> 01:08:49,144
How long do I have
to clean up your mess?

781
01:08:49,145 --> 01:08:51,547
Know how hard it is
working with you?

782
01:08:51,548 --> 01:08:53,180
Then quit!

783
01:08:53,448 --> 01:08:55,932
- Are you done talking?
- I'm done.

784
01:08:55,933 --> 01:08:58,548
You live off me,
so stop complaining.

785
01:08:58,887 --> 01:09:00,054
What?

786
01:09:00,922 --> 01:09:02,419
What's so special about your life?

787
01:09:24,179 --> 01:09:26,643
Did you do it?

788
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:30,553
You and I were the only one there.

789
01:09:30,554 --> 01:09:32,846
Tell me! Did you do it?

790
01:09:33,989 --> 01:09:37,022
Say something!

791
01:09:37,626 --> 01:09:40,659
Let go.
I don't want to say anything.

792
01:09:42,364 --> 01:09:44,429
If it wasn't you, then who sent it?

793
01:09:51,506 --> 01:09:52,940
- Hello?
- It's me.

794
01:09:52,941 --> 01:09:56,011
They called me.
What they want is money.

795
01:09:56,012 --> 01:09:57,804
Wait at home for now.

796
01:09:58,246 --> 01:09:59,538
Okay.

797
01:10:05,654 --> 01:10:08,982
Why the hell are you
doing this to me?

798
01:10:42,057 --> 01:10:45,021
What happened?

799
01:10:48,363 --> 01:10:51,467
I think those bastards
are hoodlums from that area.

800
01:10:51,468 --> 01:10:52,964
They want to raise the money.

801
01:10:54,302 --> 01:10:56,337
It's a lot.

802
01:10:56,338 --> 01:10:59,598
I think they know that
if we call the police

803
01:11:00,041 --> 01:11:01,944
then it'll get publicized.

804
01:11:01,945 --> 01:11:03,978
Sons of bitches.

805
01:11:03,979 --> 01:11:06,670
Where do we get
that kind of money so quickly?

806
01:11:09,818 --> 01:11:12,853
Even if it's a celebrity's car,

807
01:11:12,854 --> 01:11:16,080
I can't buy it at that price
since it's used.

808
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:21,360
Can I ask for your autograph
while you're here?

809
01:11:41,316 --> 01:11:42,574
What's the reason?

810
01:11:43,885 --> 01:11:45,211
You don't need to know.

811
01:11:46,421 --> 01:11:47,918
It's not petty cash.

812
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:01,364
Keep it a secret.
I'll retrieve my car later.

813
01:12:07,509 --> 01:12:09,945
Why do you trust him with our money?

814
01:12:09,946 --> 01:12:13,342
Do a job for me, quietly.

815
01:13:02,564 --> 01:13:03,731
Follow that car.

816
01:13:22,884 --> 01:13:23,884
What?

817
01:13:23,885 --> 01:13:26,787
We caught them, but one got away.

818
01:13:26,788 --> 01:13:29,456
What if that bastard
blows the whistle?

819
01:13:30,692 --> 01:13:31,950
Hurry and find him.

820
01:13:32,861 --> 01:13:34,695
When he calls again,

821
01:13:34,696 --> 01:13:38,696
I'll go get the tape
so you wait here.

822
01:13:46,541 --> 01:13:47,639
Hello?

823
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:50,506
That wasn't us.

824
01:13:51,146 --> 01:13:52,481
I said that wasn't us!

825
01:13:52,482 --> 01:13:54,911
Hello? Hello?

826
01:13:56,885 --> 01:13:58,814
Some gangsters attacked them.

827
01:13:59,721 --> 01:14:01,657
They're really pissed off.

828
01:14:01,658 --> 01:14:03,017
Did you hire them?

829
01:14:06,861 --> 01:14:08,392
Don't you get what I'm saying?

830
01:14:09,564 --> 01:14:12,426
Want people to hear
that I hired some gangsters?

831
01:14:14,536 --> 01:14:16,135
Don't interfere any more.

832
01:14:23,611 --> 01:14:25,676
Sorry about getting mad last time.

833
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:30,110
You know how I really feel, right?

834
01:14:46,868 --> 01:14:48,057
I'll go.

835
01:14:48,803 --> 01:14:51,301
No, I want to solve this myself.

836
01:15:09,457 --> 01:15:10,692
And the tape?

837
01:15:10,693 --> 01:15:11,984
Not now.

838
01:15:12,627 --> 01:15:14,830
I'll give it to you
when you return my boys.

839
01:15:14,831 --> 01:15:17,132
You should've stuck with the rules.

840
01:15:17,133 --> 01:15:19,596
- You bastard!
- Let go!

841
01:15:32,981 --> 01:15:34,148
Stop the car!

842
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:53,392
Was it him?

843
01:15:55,169 --> 01:15:56,734
The tape and the video are in here.

844
01:15:57,338 --> 01:15:58,505
Yes, it is.

845
01:16:02,644 --> 01:16:03,776
What's going on?

846
01:16:06,347 --> 01:16:10,506
In the end,
you and I live no differently.

847
01:16:12,854 --> 01:16:14,919
Take it before the cops arrive.

848
01:16:20,428 --> 01:16:23,730
No, you're the one who should leave.

849
01:16:23,731 --> 01:16:26,735
I'm handing him over to the cops.
And everyone who's involved.

850
01:16:26,736 --> 01:16:28,403
If that goes in their hands,
you're in jeopardy.

851
01:16:28,404 --> 01:16:30,662
But I can't handle things like you.

852
01:16:33,875 --> 01:16:36,134
What's so different
between him and you all?

853
01:16:37,045 --> 01:16:38,940
To be honest, I don't know.

854
01:16:40,014 --> 01:16:43,012
You ungrateful son of a bitch.

855
01:16:49,257 --> 01:16:50,592
What are you doing?

856
01:16:50,593 --> 01:16:51,858
No, not like this.

857
01:16:51,859 --> 01:16:54,425
If this gets out, you're done for.
Don't you get it?

858
01:17:05,974 --> 01:17:07,835
I've lost.

859
01:17:08,743 --> 01:17:10,205
I'm sorry, sir.

860
01:17:11,813 --> 01:17:14,777
You've gotten a lot better.

861
01:17:15,616 --> 01:17:18,120
But what's wrong
with your expression?

862
01:17:18,121 --> 01:17:19,988
Is there any problem?

863
01:17:19,989 --> 01:17:21,348
No, sir.

864
01:17:21,756 --> 01:17:23,557
There's nothing to worry about.

865
01:17:23,558 --> 01:17:28,195
Of course there shouldn't be.
Only one week left until the trial.

866
01:17:31,332 --> 01:17:34,831
I heard you're acting in a movie.

867
01:17:36,871 --> 01:17:40,131
I have a lot of eyes and ears
out there that you don't know.

868
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:43,534
I'm sorry, sir.

869
01:17:44,012 --> 01:17:47,739
Sometimes I don't know
what's in that head of yours.

870
01:18:05,133 --> 01:18:06,322
Damn it.

871
01:18:15,276 --> 01:18:16,568
Right here!

872
01:18:20,014 --> 01:18:21,647
You little...

873
01:18:24,318 --> 01:18:25,683
Damn it.

874
01:18:25,684 --> 01:18:27,181
Hello?

875
01:18:29,223 --> 01:18:31,550
I'm busy so don't call.

876
01:18:32,427 --> 01:18:34,428
You asshole.

877
01:18:34,429 --> 01:18:37,496
I'm not cursing at you.
I'm hanging up.

878
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:45,937
- Why'd you answer the phone like that?
- It's nothing, sir.

879
01:18:46,307 --> 01:18:47,405
Who was it?

880
01:18:48,776 --> 01:18:49,943
My mother.

881
01:18:50,445 --> 01:18:54,206
Her birthday is in a few days.
She asked when I'm coming to visit.

882
01:19:01,889 --> 01:19:03,056
Go visit her.

883
01:19:03,591 --> 01:19:05,053
That's okay, sir.

884
01:19:07,929 --> 01:19:09,153
Thank you, sir.

885
01:19:11,299 --> 01:19:12,864
I'll be back soon.

886
01:19:17,805 --> 01:19:19,063
What did I say wrong, sir?

887
01:19:21,843 --> 01:19:24,034
- Let's shoot a movie.
- Sir?

888
01:19:37,625 --> 01:19:38,792
Come on.

889
01:20:19,901 --> 01:20:20,965
Boss!

890
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:23,632
Mr. Park...

891
01:20:32,914 --> 01:20:34,809
What will you do?

892
01:20:47,228 --> 01:20:50,056
Mr. Kim, let's have lunch later.

893
01:21:01,042 --> 01:21:02,800
You look very surprised.

894
01:21:03,444 --> 01:21:06,815
You're not supposed to be alive.
Have you forgotten?

895
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:09,381
How can a living person
act as if he's dead?

896
01:21:10,918 --> 01:21:14,281
Wouldn't Chairman Baek
know that I'm alive?

897
01:21:16,123 --> 01:21:20,495
You seem to be in a very tight spot.

898
01:21:20,496 --> 01:21:22,219
Let me ask you one thing.

899
01:21:23,164 --> 01:21:25,491
Why'd you let me live?

900
01:21:27,969 --> 01:21:30,865
Why'd you spare me?

901
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:48,189
I heard he might testify
for the other party.

902
01:21:48,190 --> 01:21:49,791
We should take care of him now.

903
01:21:49,792 --> 01:21:51,858
It's not that easy now.

904
01:21:51,859 --> 01:21:53,924
I have to meet Chairman Baek for now.

905
01:21:54,762 --> 01:21:57,931
Follow him
and don't do anything hasty.

906
01:22:00,234 --> 01:22:03,597
Go back.
He declined your request to see him.

907
01:23:00,828 --> 01:23:03,398
Who are you?
What bastard sent you?

908
01:23:03,399 --> 01:23:05,998
I got the wrong room.

909
01:23:46,474 --> 01:23:48,369
Eun-sun

910
01:24:13,467 --> 01:24:14,759
They said he died from a fall.

911
01:24:15,536 --> 01:24:18,500
The police will determine
that it was a suicide.

912
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:47,500
Sir...

913
01:24:55,843 --> 01:24:57,374
It's not a suicide.

914
01:25:12,293 --> 01:25:14,427
Sir, we don't have time for this.

915
01:25:15,062 --> 01:25:18,199
If you don't do something,
it's dangerous.

916
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,389
Cut.

917
01:25:22,269 --> 01:25:24,403
- Put some more blood on him.
- Sir.

918
01:25:28,909 --> 01:25:30,599
Who are they back there?

919
01:25:31,879 --> 01:25:33,842
I brought two more just in case.

920
01:25:35,483 --> 01:25:36,877
Chicken shits.

921
01:25:38,586 --> 01:25:40,811
It's not the time to relax.

922
01:25:43,157 --> 01:25:45,222
Don't you know
that Chairman Baek abandoned us?

923
01:25:47,094 --> 01:25:50,231
You say you quit,
but what does that leave me?

924
01:25:50,232 --> 01:25:51,965
What is it that you want?

925
01:25:51,966 --> 01:25:55,101
Did you plan all this?
Because I mocked you in the beginning?

926
01:25:57,671 --> 01:25:59,361
Think whatever you like.

927
01:26:05,346 --> 01:26:07,115
If you just go, then that's it?

928
01:26:07,116 --> 01:26:09,313
Gang-pae! Gang-pae!

929
01:26:09,314 --> 01:26:11,642
Movies aren't a joke!

930
01:26:12,987 --> 01:26:15,657
Let go of me, you bastard!

931
01:26:15,658 --> 01:26:17,620
Gang-pae! Gang-pae!

932
01:26:18,692 --> 01:26:21,827
I don't know your reasons,
but you can't do this.

933
01:26:38,646 --> 01:26:41,838
Yeah, you don't fit here.

934
01:26:42,616 --> 01:26:44,083
Go, you bastard!

935
01:26:44,084 --> 01:26:46,377
Go live like filth
for the rest of your life!

936
01:26:47,388 --> 01:26:49,078
Pitiful bastard.

937
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:52,390
- Watch your mouth.
- What's it with you?

938
01:26:52,893 --> 01:26:53,957
You don't know shit.

939
01:26:55,095 --> 01:26:56,489
You worthless thug.

940
01:27:02,069 --> 01:27:07,502
I let you slide since he liked you,
but you have no respect.

941
01:27:08,709 --> 01:27:10,706
Look down, asshole.

942
01:27:16,417 --> 01:27:18,414
Feel humiliated in front
of everyone, huh?

943
01:27:19,253 --> 01:27:21,853
Then look down
or else it'll get worse.

944
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:27,722
You son of a bitch!
Come on and fight!

945
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:31,164
Hurts like hell, doesn't it?

946
01:27:31,165 --> 01:27:34,502
I'll make you look down
before I hit you ten times.

947
01:27:34,503 --> 01:27:35,965
Look down.

948
01:27:39,473 --> 01:27:40,662
One!

949
01:27:43,811 --> 01:27:44,978
Two!

950
01:27:47,448 --> 01:27:48,615
Three!

951
01:27:50,451 --> 01:27:56,089
Can't you differentiate
movies from real life?

952
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:00,752
Let's go.

953
01:28:03,831 --> 01:28:05,328
Fine.

954
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:08,595
Let's see who will win.

955
01:28:09,837 --> 01:28:11,004
Four!

956
01:28:12,873 --> 01:28:14,097
Five!

957
01:28:15,876 --> 01:28:17,168
Six!

958
01:28:25,552 --> 01:28:27,185
Pitiful bastard.

959
01:28:28,722 --> 01:28:30,719
Just remember one thing.

960
01:28:31,392 --> 01:28:35,187
This is all because of you.

961
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:24,136
Let's do it for real this time.

962
01:29:29,149 --> 01:29:30,229
- Sir!
- Sir!

963
01:29:30,230 --> 01:29:31,441
You bastards!

964
01:29:52,506 --> 01:29:54,606
Why are you calling so late?

965
01:29:55,409 --> 01:29:58,679
Shouldn't you be next to me
at a time like this?

966
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:01,916
Is this Jang Soo-ta?
This is the police calling.

967
01:30:01,917 --> 01:30:03,208
The police?

968
01:30:08,322 --> 01:30:10,251
Get rid of that frown.

969
01:30:11,658 --> 01:30:14,554
Think you're at home?
Sit right, you bastard.

970
01:30:18,866 --> 01:30:21,967
- Damn it.
- You're here already.

971
01:30:22,603 --> 01:30:24,737
What happened to you?
I couldn't reach you.

972
01:30:32,479 --> 01:30:33,668
What's this?

973
01:30:34,414 --> 01:30:35,706
Why do you have this on you?

974
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:41,882
You did it?

975
01:30:44,358 --> 01:30:46,494
You did this from the beginning?

976
01:30:46,495 --> 01:30:48,127
I don't think so.

977
01:30:48,829 --> 01:30:52,965
He seemed to have raised the amount
during the transaction.

978
01:30:53,967 --> 01:30:58,873
He had some gambling debt,
so that could be why he did it.

979
01:30:58,874 --> 01:31:01,132
You broke the tape because of that?

980
01:31:07,114 --> 01:31:09,248
That was some really good acting.

981
01:31:11,518 --> 01:31:13,447
What have you done for me?

982
01:31:15,923 --> 01:31:17,825
How could you say that to me?

983
01:31:17,826 --> 01:31:19,611
How could you of all people?

984
01:31:19,612 --> 01:31:22,406
- Hey, calm down.
- Let me!

985
01:31:22,407 --> 01:31:25,004
Please stop it. It's over now.

986
01:31:25,005 --> 01:31:27,568
- It's not over!
- That's enough!

987
01:31:27,569 --> 01:31:30,066
Are you fucking human?

988
01:31:30,404 --> 01:31:31,737
Let go!

989
01:31:31,738 --> 01:31:33,428
Are you human?

990
01:31:34,708 --> 01:31:36,842
How could you do that to me?

991
01:32:03,036 --> 01:32:05,238
Hi, it's me.

992
01:32:05,239 --> 01:32:07,600
I wish you wouldn't call me anymore.

993
01:32:09,710 --> 01:32:15,815
I was calling someone else,
but I must've pressed the wrong button.

994
01:32:16,516 --> 01:32:18,916
I'm busy so if you don't have
anything to say I'm hanging up.

995
01:32:21,154 --> 01:32:22,719
Okay, talk to you later.

996
01:32:47,981 --> 01:32:52,117
Being dead or alive
can't be left in someone's hands.

997
01:32:57,424 --> 01:33:01,219
Chairman Baek and you all
are now done for.

998
01:33:03,630 --> 01:33:06,628
How about working under me?

999
01:33:20,981 --> 01:33:22,273
Use it for traveling expenses.

1000
01:33:24,084 --> 01:33:26,184
I have to return the favor.

1001
01:34:22,843 --> 01:34:25,671
Or pay back the production costs!

1002
01:34:28,482 --> 01:34:29,876
Say something.

1003
01:34:30,150 --> 01:34:33,421
You bring a gangster to this movie
and ruin everything!

1004
01:34:33,422 --> 01:34:35,953
Now you don't want
to be responsible for it?

1005
01:34:49,836 --> 01:34:53,639
Let's shoot again.

1006
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:55,637
Are you fucking playing games?

1007
01:34:57,677 --> 01:34:59,174
What happened to your face?

1008
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:01,547
Then why'd you go in the first place?

1009
01:35:02,416 --> 01:35:04,318
Shall I just go?

1010
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:06,076
Go where?

1011
01:35:06,853 --> 01:35:08,543
You probably had your reasons.

1012
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:15,123
You don't make the decisions
around here.

1013
01:35:15,629 --> 01:35:17,387
Get lost, you son of a bitch.

1014
01:35:37,918 --> 01:35:39,985
You bragged about being an actor,

1015
01:35:39,986 --> 01:35:44,088
but now you don't care about
what happens to the movie?

1016
01:35:45,559 --> 01:35:46,919
Get lost, you bastard.

1017
01:35:57,871 --> 01:35:59,238
Punch me.

1018
01:35:59,239 --> 01:36:00,701
Crazy bastard.

1019
01:36:02,075 --> 01:36:05,574
You don't care about
what happens to the movie anyway.

1020
01:36:06,746 --> 01:36:08,277
I don't care of course.

1021
01:36:16,456 --> 01:36:17,816
What the...

1022
01:36:18,091 --> 01:36:19,724
What the hell are you doing?

1023
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:22,955
Let's fight now.

1024
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:25,054
Punch me.

1025
01:36:27,167 --> 01:36:29,995
Why?
Don't have the confidence to win?

1026
01:36:31,771 --> 01:36:33,802
There's no camera here.

1027
01:36:34,274 --> 01:36:37,136
Don't be conscious of people
and fight freely.

1028
01:36:39,779 --> 01:36:42,004
Why are you doing this?

1029
01:36:46,086 --> 01:36:48,151
If you want it that bad,
then let's do it for real.

1030
01:36:49,789 --> 01:36:51,616
But this isn't the place.

1031
01:37:05,205 --> 01:37:08,772
My play starts next weekend.
You're coming, right?

1032
01:37:10,110 --> 01:37:11,641
Do I have to go?

1033
01:37:12,846 --> 01:37:14,843
Of course you do.

1034
01:37:24,024 --> 01:37:26,215
Your face is full of scars.

1035
01:37:30,931 --> 01:37:34,191
Why do you keep kissing me?

1036
01:37:36,937 --> 01:37:38,968
So that you won't feel any pain.

1037
01:37:40,507 --> 01:37:42,766
So that no one will hurt you.

1038
01:37:52,118 --> 01:37:57,756
I feel like a different person
when I'm with you.

1039
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:02,293
What kind of person?

1040
01:38:43,770 --> 01:38:47,502
Ice caramel macchiato
and a parfait please.

1041
01:38:47,503 --> 01:38:51,366
Are you the actor Jang Soo-ta
by any chance?

1042
01:38:52,112 --> 01:38:55,577
No, you've gotten the wrong person.

1043
01:38:56,249 --> 01:38:59,384
I like your movies.
Have a good time.

1044
01:39:10,864 --> 01:39:12,361
I didn't think you'd come.

1045
01:39:18,004 --> 01:39:21,640
Don't you feel uncomfortable here?

1046
01:39:25,178 --> 01:39:26,402
Well, no...

1047
01:39:29,249 --> 01:39:30,848
How's the coffee?

1048
01:39:33,219 --> 01:39:34,579
Not bad.

1049
01:40:11,324 --> 01:40:12,491
Cut!

1050
01:40:18,064 --> 01:40:20,960
This is the very end.

1051
01:40:21,668 --> 01:40:23,704
Are you really going to fight?

1052
01:40:23,705 --> 01:40:24,894
Yes.

1053
01:40:27,841 --> 01:40:29,235
You have the confidence, right?

1054
01:40:30,543 --> 01:40:32,713
Just make sure we get filmed.

1055
01:40:32,714 --> 01:40:35,182
Okay, let's do it.

1056
01:40:35,183 --> 01:40:36,965
You can win.

1057
01:40:36,966 --> 01:40:38,880
Okay, get ready.

1058
01:40:39,319 --> 01:40:41,453
Get ready for the last take!

1059
01:40:42,889 --> 01:40:44,691
Everyone get ready!

1060
01:40:44,692 --> 01:40:46,425
Bring me some socks.

1061
01:40:46,426 --> 01:40:48,761
Camera A, go with a full shot!

1062
01:40:48,762 --> 01:40:53,399
Camera B and Camera C,
shoot the actors with close ups.

1063
01:40:55,268 --> 01:40:58,335
- Will it come out like in the script?
- I don't know either.

1064
01:40:58,705 --> 01:41:00,429
The director doesn't know everything.

1065
01:41:01,174 --> 01:41:02,898
Then what do you know?

1066
01:41:03,376 --> 01:41:05,737
That the director should trust
his actors till the very end.

1067
01:41:23,062 --> 01:41:24,630
I'll be gentle.

1068
01:41:24,631 --> 01:41:25,991
Give me all that you got.

1069
01:41:26,866 --> 01:41:29,261
- Ready!
- Shoot.

1070
01:41:29,402 --> 01:41:31,438
- Sound!
- OK.

1071
01:41:31,439 --> 01:41:33,299
Camera!

1072
01:41:33,573 --> 01:41:34,967
Action!

1073
01:43:34,894 --> 01:43:36,220
Is that all that you got?

1074
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,719
Cut!

1075
01:45:46,325 --> 01:45:47,994
Did all the cameras get everything?

1076
01:45:47,995 --> 01:45:49,957
They fucking did it.

1077
01:45:51,798 --> 01:45:53,329
You two were wonderful.

1078
01:45:54,934 --> 01:45:56,601
Absolutely wonderful.

1079
01:45:56,602 --> 01:45:59,396
Don't cry. You look like a loser.

1080
01:46:45,451 --> 01:46:46,743
Where are you going?

1081
01:46:47,453 --> 01:46:50,747
Now that the shoot's over,
the director wanted to have a drink.

1082
01:46:52,058 --> 01:46:55,318
Now you seem like a real actor.

1083
01:47:37,170 --> 01:47:38,928
Where are you going in such a rush?

1084
01:47:39,405 --> 01:47:41,072
To shoot a movie.

1085
01:47:41,073 --> 01:47:43,867
What? Without a camera?

1086
01:47:44,811 --> 01:47:46,730
You're the camera.

1087
01:47:46,731 --> 01:47:48,270
Don't be silly.

1088
01:47:48,271 --> 01:47:49,941
Film it right.

1089
01:48:12,004 --> 01:48:13,535
I'll carry it for you.

1090
01:48:15,641 --> 01:48:16,967
Sure.

1091
01:48:19,145 --> 01:48:22,405
Be careful carrying it.
It's precious.

1092
01:49:40,226 --> 01:49:41,586
You bastard!

1093
01:49:42,828 --> 01:49:46,156
Son of bitch!
Don't move!

1094
01:49:47,733 --> 01:49:48,957
Come here!

1095
01:49:52,538 --> 01:49:53,727
Step aside.
