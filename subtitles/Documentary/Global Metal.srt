come to camp out on the fields of the northern Germany

this is me, my name is Sam Dunn

10
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,659
and as you can see,
I'm one of the die-hard Metal fans...

11
00:01:27,624 --> 00:01:31,274
ever since I was 12 years old
I've been obessed with all things Metal

12
00:01:31,928 --> 00:01:35,281
and although my parents hoped it was a phase,
it wasn't...

13
00:01:35,757 --> 00:01:39,402
I grew up, got my graduate degree in Anthropology

14
00:01:39,407 --> 00:01:42,926
and then decided to make a documentary
about Heavy Metal culture

15
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:48,999
in the film I traced the music back to its working class roots
in the factory towns of England and America

16
00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:54,960
and the showed how Early Metal bands
like Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and Blue Cheer

17
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:58,962
layed the foundation for crazy number of Metal subgenres

18
00:01:58,964 --> 00:02:02,420
along the way, I met some of my childhood heroes

19
00:02:02,525 --> 00:02:06,651
and spoke to the tons of musicians
about the controversy surrounding this music...

20
00:02:06,655 --> 00:02:08,182
Satan !

21
00:02:08,287 --> 00:02:11,415
I also heard from hundreds of Metal fans
about what this music means to them...

22
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:15,302
from the time I was 12 years old
Metal was just a constant...

23
00:02:15,656 --> 00:02:19,866
and what I discovered is this underground movement
is even bigger than I first thought...

24
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,950
and for Metalhead its about more than just music...

25
00:02:24,135 --> 00:02:26,220
it's an identity...

26
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:29,661
after the film was released

27
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:35,313
I got a flood of emails from Metal fans thanking me
for giving this community the respect it deserves...

28
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:39,997
but what surprised me,
was how many different countries the e-mails came from

29
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:43,690
many were from places I had no idea Metal even existed

30
00:02:44,257 --> 00:02:47,874
I mean I knew there was Metal outside of
Europe and North America

31
00:02:48,428 --> 00:02:50,487
one of my favorite bands is Sepultura from Brazil

32
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:54,415
I also have Metal albums recorded live in Japan...

33
00:02:54,684 --> 00:02:57,985
but the stories in these e-mails got me thinking

34
00:02:57,986 --> 00:03:01,886
for years anthropologists have studied
the effects of Globalization

35
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:05,087
but I've never considered Heavy Metal's role in this process

36
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,786
as Metal has spreaded across the globe

37
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,415
what new meanings is it taking on
for fans and countries...

38
00:03:11,415 --> 00:03:15,907
...with such vastly different cultural,
political and religious backgrounds?

39
00:03:16,578 --> 00:03:20,619
clearly, there's whole world of Metal out there
I know nothing about...

40
00:03:22,592 --> 00:03:25,818
but I'm not gonna find answers
on the fields of northen Germany

41
00:03:25,962 --> 00:03:28,763
so I am taking my anthropology studies on the road

42
00:03:29,253 --> 00:03:32,186
to understand how Metal has gone Global...

with beaches, soccer and Samba

that it's also known for its massive Metal scene

00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,944
so what happened to make Metal so huge in this country?

[Carlos Lopes / Dorsal Atlantica]
the people in the 70's lived under a dictatorship in Brazil

58
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:41,730
we had this dictatorship for almost 25 years

59
00:05:42,434 --> 00:05:49,531
during this dictatorship there was not a lot of freedom
and it wasn't easy to access information

60
00:05:50,522 --> 00:05:52,493
[Rafael Bittencourt/Angra]
on that period, when we were teenagers,

61
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,470
it was very hard to find good instruments

62
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:58,706
the market was very closed,
for everything then comes from abroad

63
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:03,397
the Brazilian dictatorship ended in 1985

64
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:11,519
at that moment the bands were starting to
release their first albums of Brazilian Heavy Metal

65
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:16,221
and what that means is that
Heavy Metal came along with democracy

I think the organizers of Rock In Rio fell to the momentum

68
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:36,755
and they organized this festival which was huge...

69
00:06:37,337 --> 00:06:42,182
there were 1.380.000 people during ten days

70
00:06:42,826 --> 00:06:47,975
and it was the first time, you know,

74

it's a little ridiculous, but seeing Whitesnake,
Ozzy Osbourne, Scorpions and Iron Maiden

75
00:07:18,364 --> 00:07:22,534
was overwhelming for a Brazilian in 1985

I wouldn't say that Metal came to free us
but...

77
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,572
I would say that it was something that we were begging for...

coming up in the air...

rising off the bodies, off the crowd...

we felt like we were part of a big family...
of a religion...

88

Metal actually coming out of Brazil

to starting out as an Extreme Metal band in Brazil

100
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,430
[Max Cavalera]
well, the thing was the struggle actually

101
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:55,336
from our own struggle, we didn't know how to play
but we wanted to a have a band

they had bullet-belts...

well, let's get some bunch of AA batteries,
glue them together,

he was like "yeah it'll work"

and then they looked perfect, they looked great...

traditional Brazilian instruments into their music

why they wanna go with a bunch of naked Indians
in the middle of the Amazon...?

dude, that is a huge subway system...

151
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:31,611
I saw in Brazil how a country's culture
can be incorporated into Metal music

152
00:15:32,145 --> 00:15:36,882
but wut about Japan?
a placed stereotyped for its obsession for western culture

153
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:44,275
its also known for its hard-working salary men
conformity, and extreme organization

154
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:46,704
none of which seems very Metal to me...

155
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,788
so what happens to Metal's rebellious spirit
when it mixes with Japanese culture?

156
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:58,835
hopefully I'll find out at Loud Park,
the biggest Metal festival in Asia

[LAMB OF GOD - Walk with me in Hell]

- is it the first time you came to Japan

159
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:45,887
[Tom Araya / SLAYER] :
we played at a theater, it had like 3000 seaters at theater

160
00:16:49,728 --> 00:16:55,450
and they were all... everybody was sitting in their seats
and they had ushers and every ail...

161
00:16:56,025 --> 00:17:00,450
[Kerry King / SLAYER] : so we came here,
not having any idea what was gonna happen

162
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:02,725
not believing they were gonna sit down,

163
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:05,005
somehow there's no way you can sit down
and watch a Slayer show...

164
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,250
it just ain't gonna happen...

165
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:12,235
and the minute we started playing,
they got up and rushed to the front...

166
00:17:12,444 --> 00:17:13,803
and the promoter at the time, freaked out !

167
00:17:14,124 --> 00:17:17,124
they had never seen an audience
just get off their seat and rush...

168
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:22,453
we stood there playin' and all of a sudden while we were
playin', you could see all the ushers were like doing this...

169
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:24,621
and made everybody have back in their seats...

170
00:17:24,731 --> 00:17:25,731
and everbody is told for the rest of the show
they sat in their seats... they did this...

171
00:17:29,663 --> 00:17:33,104
now the Japanese are moshing,
now the Japanese are body-surfing, so...

172
00:17:33,105 --> 00:17:35,608
we've seen that complete evolution from when

173
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:39,362
it wasn't loud at all, to now it's kinda like common place

[Masa Itoh - Rock City TV] : I think Japanese Metal fans way of
thinking is different from western people's way of thinking

180
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:13,598
for example if you ask them
if Metal expresses their feelings of...

181
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:20,004
oppression and dissatisfaction...
most of them would probably say "No"

182
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:25,687
in the West, if you're looking for rebellion
or feel isolated in society

183
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,930
you would be drawn to Metal music

184
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,020
this is not the case in Japan

185
00:18:33,142 --> 00:18:37,780
[Katsuya Minamida : Kabe University]
for example, fans at Rock festivals are very couteous

186
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:46,363
if they throw down their garbage,
later they'll pick it up and perhaps bring it home with them

187
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:50,831
if you're a Metal fan, you'll maintain your demonic image

188
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:55,430
during the concert you will appear very demonic...

189
00:18:56,018 --> 00:19:00,372
but once outside the concert,
you go back to your couteous self

[Lars Ulrich : Metallica]
sometimes Japans gets a little bit of a bad rap from people

196

because of the way people kind of interact at the shows

197
00:19:45,563 --> 00:19:47,563
or the lack of inner action or whatever...

198
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:52,217
to me that's horseshit ! I mean it's just
a different way of expressing themselves

if there was anything...

...we had bad dental hygene or bad breath of whatever...

203

it's their way of showing love...

204
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:14,667
here, have a tooth brush with some
Japanese teddy bear on it or whatever...

at Loud Park I found a new generation of Japanese Metal fans

210
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:58,692
but now I'm on the hunt for some of the old guard
to discover how Metal arrived in this country

211
00:20:58,844 --> 00:21:01,271
rumor has it, they hang out at Blackmore's

212
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:05,763
a small bar named after Deep Purple legendary guitarist
"Richie Blackmore"

213
00:21:17,771 --> 00:21:20,992
Deep Purple arrived in Japan in August 1972

214
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:28,349
before that I thought that Deep Purple
had an organized and structured way of playing...

215
00:21:28,564 --> 00:21:30,927
but it wasn't like that,

216
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:34,020
they were bringing more and more
improvisation into their performance

217
00:21:34,057 --> 00:21:38,624
the finale was crazy...
we had never seen that before

218
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:43,315
everyone rushed to the front of the Budokan stage

219
00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:47,174
Richie Blackmore was turning the guitar upside down

220
00:21:47,277 --> 00:21:51,448
that was the night Deep Purple became a legend

221
00:22:03,437 --> 00:22:07,547
there is a current trend among men in their 50's...

222
00:22:07,584 --> 00:22:11,801
they reunite with old band members from
university or high school and play together

223
00:22:11,837 --> 00:22:17,976
and what they always play in the studio is "Highway Star"

224
00:22:18,013 --> 00:22:21,234
everyone wants to be the guitarist
and only play the solo...

225
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,869
but I heard the vocalists have a
hard timebecause the key is too high

226
00:22:33,673 --> 00:22:39,250
"Kiss" arrived a few years later

227
00:22:45,872 --> 00:22:50,568
when they came off the plane
they were in full makeup and costume

228
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:54,275
the problem was that they couldn't
pass through immigration like this

229
00:22:54,312 --> 00:22:57,909
so they had to take the makeup off
in order to pass through immigration

230
00:22:57,946 --> 00:23:03,044
afterwards they re-applied all their makeup
and changed back into their costumes

231
00:23:03,097 --> 00:23:07,170
then they came out of immigration
in full stage costume...

232
00:23:07,275 --> 00:23:09,838
thousands of fans flooded them

233
00:23:09,874 --> 00:23:14,139
if you see the videos of when
they arrived in 70's you might faint

234
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:32,706
[Yoshiyuri Ohno - Journalist] : the bang of the pyro
and their use of fire was the biggest shock to us

235
00:23:33,743 --> 00:23:38,627
but wearing make up on stage
was pretty well accepted

236
00:23:42,411 --> 00:23:47,031
In Japan because of the makeup
Kiss also reminds us of Kabuki theatre

237
00:23:47,068 --> 00:23:51,129
because of that I think a lot of Japanese
people felt a certain intimacy with them

[KISS : Rock and Roll All Nite]

after spending some time in Japan

240
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:27,110
I realized there's a lot more going on
than just obsession with Western culture

241
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:31,453
this place is unlike anywhere I've ever experienced

242
00:24:31,489 --> 00:24:36,306

have done anything unique with Heavy Metal music

[Marty Friedman]
I'm a multi-platinium artist from a major band called Megadeth

00:24:55,408 --> 00:24:59,155
that has rocked Japan so many times
rocked the whole world...

246
00:24:59,295 --> 00:25:04,748
and yet I choose to live in Japan
and play Japanese pop music

247
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:07,499
and be on Japanese variety TV shows

248
00:25:08,189 --> 00:25:10,637
In Japan Taboos are off

249
00:25:11,132 --> 00:25:13,289
I mean there's all kinds of mixes and...

250
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:17,692
for example, i'm about to do this project that
was telling you about before called Death Panda

251
00:25:18,345 --> 00:25:20,391
where I'm playing this full-on Metal music

252
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:24,452
but it's gonna be sung by 48 teenage girls...

253
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:42,188
that could never happen in America, in other countries
or you know where or the way I grew up

254

every single culture has something really cool to offer

255

America and England... you know what I mean?

256
00:25:52,668 --> 00:25:54,988
and then other countries did their own stant on it

257
00:25:55,107 --> 00:26:00,715
and Japan, my favorite kind of Japanese Metal
is Visual K music

[SEX MACHINEGUNS]

259
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:21,410
Visual K is a Phenomenon
it's unbelievable...

260
00:26:22,057 --> 00:26:30,869
it's guys that are dressed up in gorgeous, I guess kind of
"Glam meets Goth, meets really extravagant Heavy Metal"

261
00:26:31,287 --> 00:26:36,501
not Twisted Sister guys wearing their moms
clothes kind of feminine... the makeup, it's beautiful...

262
00:26:43,276 --> 00:26:47,300
of all the bands that were doing Visual music
X-Japan became the biggest

263
00:26:48,676 --> 00:26:50,980
and by far the most versatile musically

264
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:58,061
[Yoshiki / X-Japan] : I started playing the piano
when I was 4... the classical piano...

265
00:26:58,473 --> 00:27:01,473
the first concert I saw was Kiss

266
00:27:02,415 --> 00:27:07,377
I think I was 9 or 10 years old,
I went to see Kiss with my mother

267
00:27:08,508 --> 00:27:10,492
so that put a lot of changes in my life...

268
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,147
at the beginning, the music industry hated us

269
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,715
we were like black sheep of the family, completely...

270
00:27:41,046 --> 00:27:44,152
nobody wanted to interview us...

271
00:27:44,153 --> 00:27:50,095
but eventually we sold twenty million albums,
so they had no choice...

272
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:56,989
X- Japan is probably the first thing that
really got me into Japanese Rock music

273
00:27:57,093 --> 00:28:04,129
and why? because it's got the fastest heaviest music
next to the sappy sappy ballads

274
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:06,306
and I happen to love sappy ballads

275
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,313
but like I would never as an American have the guts

276
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:11,712
to put out an album next a song
that sounds like "Fight Fight With Fire"

277
00:28:13,116 --> 00:28:14,510
you know, they got songs that sound like Barry Manilow

278
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:18,910
they come right after like these full-on Metal epics,
and i'm like: "how can they do this?"

279
00:28:38,172 --> 00:28:42,663
and the people who listen to the Japanese
domestic Rock and heavy sounding music

280
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:46,608
they don't even know really that
the international Heavy Metal bands exist

281
00:28:46,967 --> 00:28:50,058
it is very like that they've never heard of Metallica

282
00:28:50,267 --> 00:28:57,266
so it is very interesting how these two genres
can exist and they don't like each other

283
00:28:57,303 --> 00:28:58,816
and they sound so similar...

they don't think the Japanese stuff is very cool...

286
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:09,211
so what is Visual K?
I guess what makes it "Not Metal" in your opinion?

[Mirai Kawashima / Sigh] : because Metal is something cool...

and it wasn't until I moved to China for first time in 1988

437
00:44:14,731 --> 00:44:16,474
then I started playing in a pure Metal band

438
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,600
that band was called Tang Dynasty

439
00:44:31,756 --> 00:44:39,802
the real story of my coming here deciding to play Rock
starts with a little shitty Roland cube 60 amp and a guitar

440
00:44:39,905 --> 00:44:43,807
I came out here just sure
I was gonna find some Metal musicians

441
00:44:43,843 --> 00:44:47,589
when I got here, the first thing that happens,
I ran into this guy named Dingu

442
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:52,269
Dingu, who's got some fuckin' Blues chops, and he was
like vanning strings as he's sliding off down on them..

443
00:44:53,192 --> 00:44:56,203
but one thing he didn't know how to do really
was to make a guitar really overdrive...

444
00:44:56,438 --> 00:44:57,203
he didn't really know... I mean he didn't have
the *** box and anything like that... so anyway...

445
00:44:59,108 --> 00:45:00,944
then the lessons began,

446
00:45:00,944 --> 00:45:07,139
where I did my whole through Jack Black, you know,
School of Rock, history of Rock lessons... the family trees

447
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,519
and I said: Dingu, you are a Metal guy... I mean...

448
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:14,519
it's clear to me that you are a Metal...
you should be a fuckin' headbanger... I mean you ARE...

449
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,889
he can sing like a goddamn banshee,
and he had like this bewitching charisma

450
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,261
I mean just a beautiful stage presence

451
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:30,499
eyes new dude, man we're gonna make
the greatest band that China will ever see..

452
00:45:51,509 --> 00:45:56,164
a phenomenon like Tang Dynasty, we did it all well
and we packed stadiums...

453
00:45:56,201 --> 00:45:58,846
most of the people that came were not Metal fans,

454
00:45:59,127 --> 00:46:03,902
they were just sort of interested in this phenomenon,
they thought it was, you know, a curiosity...

455
00:46:04,438 --> 00:46:11,108
when we used to tour, people would just sit there
sort of slap-jobs, not knowing what the fuck we were...

456
00:46:11,528 --> 00:46:13,829
I'd hear people cussing on each other : [in Chinese...]

457
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:18,319
which means: hey, buddy is that hair real...?

458
00:46:21,536 --> 00:46:25,107
the Metal look works for Chinese males

459
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:29,812
this shit spreads out of our heads quite naturally
and it looks pretty good

460
00:46:29,877 --> 00:46:34,585
that echoes also with Naluvu great warriors at ancient times...

461
00:46:34,674 --> 00:46:39,831
sometimes they'd tie it up like this or whatever
but it's long hair... and that *** for sure

462
00:46:42,597 --> 00:46:46,679
long hair means sort of martial powers...

463
00:46:55,734 --> 00:46:59,280
Tang Dynasty is how most people heard about Metal in China

464
00:46:59,487 --> 00:47:01,480
but how did they find out all about Western Metal?

465
00:47:01,532 --> 00:47:09,453
prior to say 1994 all stemming bit of music
that came into China that was of the Metal ilk

466
00:47:09,557 --> 00:47:17,331
was from students or children of diplomats,
or children of like multi-national corporations

467
00:47:17,421 --> 00:47:22,534
who made tapes or made copies or whatever...
and that stuff circulated...

468
00:47:23,143 --> 00:47:30,957
what really turned on the tap here,
was the advent of what had called CD catalog cutouts

469
00:47:30,994 --> 00:47:33,439
when an artist is cut out of *** from record company

470
00:47:33,657 --> 00:47:36,938
to realize some tax saving, they destroy inventory,

471
00:47:36,952 --> 00:47:38,622
and of course they don't actually destroy it,

472
00:47:38,562 --> 00:47:46,102
they call, you know like Toni Fezuchi's trucking company
and comes and take 'em straight to the shipping yard

473
00:47:46,289 --> 00:47:49,587
and hauls away to China...

474
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:52,069
you could find millions of these CDs
from any genre of music

475
00:47:52,243 --> 00:47:56,530
Jazz, Blues, Classical, Metal music... everything

476
00:47:57,311 --> 00:48:02,130
suddenly all the stuff was available,
dirt cheap and really affordable for Chinese people

477
00:48:02,518 --> 00:48:07,224
most of it was shit, I mean there's a reason
why these artists were cut out from the ***

478
00:48:08,073 --> 00:48:12,112
but there are always diamonds in there as well...

479
00:48:15,703 --> 00:48:21,488
Heavy Metal in China is has come a long way since
Tang Dynasty and illegal Glam Metal CDs...

480
00:48:21,533 --> 00:48:24,669
In Beijing I discovered a growing underground music scene

481
00:48:25,072 --> 00:48:30,118
a scene that's producing the darkest most extreme Metal
I've heard on my journey so far

482
00:48:45,313 --> 00:48:46,922
[Nong Yong / Ritual Day] :
my name is Nong Yong.

483
00:48:47,022 --> 00:48:49,336
I am now 34 years old

484
00:48:50,406 --> 00:48:58,305
I have always been very interested in music
since childhood, but in Metal since 1998

485
00:48:58,341 --> 00:49:03,956
I was very shocked that music
could be played in a such way

486
00:49:03,993 --> 00:49:07,386
so I organized a band and started to play Metal music

487
00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:12,606
at that time I was a part of the first wave
of people playing this type of music

488
00:49:12,642 --> 00:49:20,425
I possess a certain kind of emotion,
whenever I face trials in my life I feel very dark

489
00:49:21,707 --> 00:49:26,363
how do I express these dark feelings?
I choose to use Metal music

490
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:39,463
The most important thing about Metal
is that it gives young people a tool...

491
00:49:39,645 --> 00:49:42,741
...to express their emotions
in a very frank and direct way

492
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:50,166
they long to express their own hatred and emotions

493
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:54,830
I grew up during the tail end of the
Chinese Cultural Revolution

494
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,996
in my childhood if youngsters
had hatred for each other...

495
00:49:58,631 --> 00:50:06,187
...they would get together at the front gate
of the school and have these brutal fights

496
00:50:06,367 --> 00:50:13,484
so I think that Metal has helped the Chinese
government solve some social problems...

497
00:50:14,152 --> 00:50:19,165
...because youngsters can express
their hatred and emotions through Metal

498
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:27,201
the music of Chinese Metal groups
reflects "injustice"

499
00:50:27,621 --> 00:50:32,177
...political inadequacy
and corruption in government

500
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:40,456
it also reflects the low standard of
living, poverty and unfair treatment

501
00:51:16,388 --> 00:51:19,800
I think that we're coming into a time
now where China is finding its footing

502
00:51:20,485 --> 00:51:25,624
it can be something that it's at once distinctly modern
and unashamedly modern

503
00:51:26,248 --> 00:51:29,691
and distinctly and unabashedly Chinese...

504
00:51:30,985 --> 00:51:34,331
that's the movement I wanna be a part of...

505
00:52:39,693 --> 00:52:43,300
so I just traveled to two of the world's most populist countries,

506
00:52:43,752 --> 00:52:47,697
India and China,
where no major Metal bands have ever toured...

507
00:52:48,034 --> 00:52:50,206
and yet in the middle of the Pacific Ocean

508
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,945
an impoverish nation with the
largest Muslim population in the world

509
00:52:54,395 --> 00:52:56,854
Has had big several Metal concerts

510
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:59,341
even while under an oppressive dictatorship...

511
00:53:00,705 --> 00:53:05,192
[Jakarta, Indonesia]
"It's like a mass demonstration..."

512
00:53:05,434 --> 00:53:11,598
we're now facing the fifth or fourth
the biggest population in the world

513
00:53:11,767 --> 00:53:15,734
[Wendi Putranto - Rolling Stone, Indonesia] :
we're nearly 300 million people living in Indonesia...

514
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:19,030
unemployment here is staggeringly
how bad unemployment is,

515
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,381
[Jason Tedjasukmana - Time Magazine, Indonesia] :
I mean officially it's only like 10% or 11%

516
00:53:21,955 --> 00:53:24,841
but unofficially it's probably more like 40%

517
00:53:25,047 --> 00:53:27,631
and that's a lot of people... it's a big country

518
00:53:28,126 --> 00:53:33,532
[Barney Greenway / NAPALM DEATH] :
you could be in like the most plush copra high rise area

519
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,274
and then right next to it there's
all shanties right there on the street

520
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:40,409
I mean people are litterally living in the gutter

521
00:53:41,241 --> 00:53:46,737
[Andre Tiranda / Siksakubur] :
and it's ironic to see so many poor people in the country...

522
00:53:48,021 --> 00:53:52,676
who has a mountain of diamonds, sea of gold...

523
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,290
that's ironic, huh?
that's Indonesia...

524
00:53:59,916 --> 00:54:05,432
"nonconformity in my inner self..."

525
00:54:06,816 --> 00:54:11,816
[SEPULTURA : Inner Self]
[Surabaya, Indonesia / July 11, 1992]

526
00:54:18,533 --> 00:54:20,513
( walking these dirty streets )

527
00:54:21,378 --> 00:54:23,344
( with hate in my mind... )

528
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:25,634
( feeling scorn of world, )

529
00:54:26,392 --> 00:54:27,592
(I won't follow your rules... )

530
00:54:29,024 --> 00:54:30,912
( blame and lies... )

531
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:33,005
( contradications arise... )

532
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:38,828
I think there's a whole thing connected to Brazil,
and where I'm from

533
00:54:38,864 --> 00:54:42,908
that's connects to Third World lyrics,
'cause this is their lyrics...

534
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:47,906
when I'm singing about Inner Self,
of growing up in this fucked up streets and shit...

535
00:54:48,255 --> 00:54:53,617
the Indonesian fans reading some of those lyrics,
they'd feel onnected to it...

536
00:54:53,814 --> 00:54:56,115
Sepultura are coming from a Third [World] country as well

537
00:54:54,820 --> 00:55:03,053
and Indonesia with poor, injustice, everywhere starving people,
you know, the corruption...

538
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:06,123
the're singing about that too in their lyrics

539
00:55:06,863 --> 00:55:13,444
it so matches with happened in this country
all over years...

540
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:21,389
halfway to the show, the kids got so crazy,
fuckin' place in chaos, Hell broke loose, you know, mosh-pits...

541
00:55:21,426 --> 00:55:25,768
couple of minutes after that they stopped the entire show
and had these huge bamboo sticks...

542
00:55:25,828 --> 00:55:29,302
and they were like kinda beating up the first row of kids

543
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:34,609
and they made 20000 people sit down on the floor
without making one sound...

544
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:38,594
I've never seen anything like that in my life, you know

545
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:44,091
none of us, man...
I feel we were like "holy shit"...

546
00:55:44,757 --> 00:55:46,827
we played for the first time ever here,

547
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,424
we're so fuckin' proud to be playing in front of you,

548
00:55:49,748 --> 00:55:51,748
I'm sorry for anything that happened here tonight...

549
00:55:53,158 --> 00:55:57,485
it's a lot similar, the kids in Brazil or India or Eastern Europe

550
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:02,617
Rebellion... fuckin' pissed off,
real pissed about the shit,

551
00:56:02,705 --> 00:56:09,013
the way their life is...
it's how they had to grow in this shithole

552
00:56:09,511 --> 00:56:12,304
and it's pretty much they're gonna die in this shithole,

553
00:56:12,655 --> 00:56:16,250
so what do you do about it?
so you know, Metal comes in...

554
00:56:17,301 --> 00:56:22,301
[METALLICA / Jakarta, Indonesia / April 10, 1993]

555
00:56:35,846 --> 00:56:41,619
people were coming from everywhere
From Donggala, from Surabaya, even from Dahli

556
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:45,058
Arian 13 / Seringai]
everyone from median people come just to see Metallica

557
00:56:45,588 --> 00:56:51,661
I had to sell my father's shoes,
so I can afford the tickets

558
00:56:52,186 --> 00:56:55,889
yes, I had my father angry at me...

559
00:56:56,177 --> 00:57:01,866
I remember driving to the gig,
there were a fuck lot of people outside

560
00:57:02,879 --> 00:57:06,078
and the stadium was in a very rich part of Jakarta

561
00:57:06,569 --> 00:57:10,569
where a lot of the politicians
and a lot of the old money family lives

562
00:57:11,912 --> 00:57:18,354
so here were thousands and thousands of young kids
and a lot of kind of adolescent

563
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:23,735
when Metallica was on the other side of the stadium walls,

564
00:57:24,595 --> 00:57:27,735
and we were playing and bunch of people couldn't get in so on

565
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:33,047
and obviously pretty much all hell broke loose out there

566
00:58:00,289 --> 00:58:02,358
we're standing up on stage, playing, doing our thing

567
00:58:02,358 --> 00:58:09,905
and you can see like fires and smoke
and all the police sirens and all that crap...

568
00:58:10,579 --> 00:58:14,361
and it was just...
they basically just fuckin' tore the whole neighborhood up

569
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:21,776
army chased us, and they were like... I was yelling
"sir, I got tickets, I want to get into stadium"

570
00:58:21,812 --> 00:58:22,605
"you can't get into stadium..."

571
00:58:22,952 --> 00:58:32,827
and he was like "your black T-shirts fucks!
you are all communists!" and then starts swaying everthing...

572
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:34,471
...and we just ran way

573
00:58:35,985 --> 00:58:40,116
yeah, I got hit in my head too,
even though I got the ticket...

574
00:58:40,438 --> 00:58:45,989
they just hit everything... no matter...
whether you got ticket or not.. they just hit everything...

575
00:58:59,206 --> 00:59:05,702
after the Metallica's concert, they banned all the Metal shows
they banned all the Rock concerts

576
00:59:06,244 --> 00:59:08,972
from the international acts of course,

577
00:59:09,008 --> 00:59:13,149
cause they said that, it kind of brings
a bad impact for Indonesian youth

578
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:20,660
'cause you know, it's like a mass demonstration...
just like what we had in 1998

579
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:26,221
the Mei revolution, while Suharto stepped down
by the students movement

580
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:33,882
[Franki Raden . Professor] : after Suharto stepped down,
there was some sort of leads of this

581
00:59:33,919 --> 00:59:39,991
like holding back anarchy, that during the Suharto era
you cannot [couldnot] really express...

582
00:59:40,099 --> 00:59:45,324
so everywhere people saw themselves sort of
liberated from all this oppression...

583
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,126
like 52 years is not a short period

584
00:59:48,189 --> 00:59:51,086
so they feel like "now I can do almost anything"...

585
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:57,537
not long after Suharto stepped down
we have very a political underground scene here

[Jasad]

589
01:00:29,661 --> 01:00:34,274
in Jakarta most Metal bands sing
about social and political issues...

590
01:00:34,703 --> 01:00:37,627
something I associate more with Punk Rock than Metal,

591
01:00:39,116 --> 01:00:41,774
but Indonesia's most popular Metal band
"Tengkorak",

592
01:00:41,863 --> 01:00:46,074
has started to incorporate more controvesial ideas...

593
01:00:46,596 --> 01:00:50,465
what are you trying to say through Tengkorak's music?

594
01:00:50,502 --> 01:00:55,592
we have some themes about our
disagreement with the Capitalist countries...

595
01:00:56,533 --> 01:01:01,938
...as they always push
Third World countries into a corner

596
01:01:02,537 --> 01:01:06,668
[Ombat Masution / Tengkorak] :
as you know the majority of Indonesians are Muslims...

597
01:01:07,744 --> 01:01:14,006
...and because of this they say
we are a "terrorist country"

598
01:01:14,618 --> 01:01:18,440
... and we do not agree with or respect that statement.

599
01:01:22,773 --> 01:01:26,772
most of the song have a very strong
poiltical or social commentary

600
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:31,857
but there is one song which is called I think "Destroy Zionism"
what do you look past through that song?

601
01:01:31,894 --> 01:01:36,043
Zionism is a system made by the Jews

602
01:01:38,477 --> 01:01:43,950
these Jewish people have this system which is not good...

603
01:01:44,518 --> 01:01:51,323
because they have this goal
to this destroy Islamic people

604
01:01:53,326 --> 01:01:56,831
Zionists must be destroyed

605
01:01:57,612 --> 01:02:00,176
They should be no more

606
01:02:00,327 --> 01:02:03,889
if necessary, Israel must be
eliminated from the global map

607
01:02:05,313 --> 01:02:06,777
people who would hear that song and then...

608
01:02:07,936 --> 01:02:10,672
...see your jacket with a Swastika and a slash through it

609
01:02:11,088 --> 01:02:14,470
you think they might see that as a bit of a contradiction?

610
01:02:15,147 --> 01:02:19,521
it is not the Jewish people that we are against...

611
01:02:20,426 --> 01:02:23,457
...only their system

612
01:02:23,777 --> 01:02:26,949
the right wing politics and their religious leader

613
01:02:27,468 --> 01:02:31,738
they're kind of more to fitch people of Indonesia

614
01:02:32,663 --> 01:02:36,501
You got to live in Islam way

615
01:02:37,634 --> 01:02:43,150
me, I was born in Islam, but I don't trust that religion anymore

616
01:02:43,545 --> 01:02:46,789
'cause for me, religion is "individual"

617
01:02:47,245 --> 01:02:49,030
it's only between you and God...

618
01:02:49,728 --> 01:02:54,456
Muslims teach about peace,
every religion teaches about peace

619
01:02:54,689 --> 01:02:58,915
they don't teach to make enemies
or to make war with others

620
01:03:00,183 --> 01:03:04,085
those are the people who
impose their will on others

621
01:03:04,122 --> 01:03:07,083
and they are not good people,
no matter which religion...

622
01:03:07,187 --> 01:03:12,666
they could be Muslims, Christians or whoever,
and they are not good people in my opinion...

623
01:03:19,215 --> 01:03:22,300
- there you go
- I'm ready !

624
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:39,261
I'm in a mosque in Indonesia

625
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:43,302
and it's the end of Ramadan

626
01:03:43,617 --> 01:03:46,214
so it's Friday, so it's the big pray day

627
01:03:47,036 --> 01:03:51,460
and we're going in with our new friend Rudi,

628
01:03:51,496 --> 01:03:54,884
it's the first foot-bath I had in a long time...!

629
01:03:59,166 --> 01:04:04,630
Muslims ideally should be like me
or like the other people you see

630
01:04:05,262 --> 01:04:10,211
very common, they pray, they go to work,
like me...

632

They're the Muslims...

Metal is for my life, Metal is for life

634

Make relationship with friends
just hear the music and take the spirit

635

it's only for life...

636
01:04:51,537 --> 01:04:57,255
but religion is my relation
particularly with my God

637

"More scared of the Living..."

639
01:05:29,666 --> 01:05:33,030
Metal music has never shied away from controversy

640
01:05:33,066 --> 01:05:37,753
it has always rebelled against authority
and stood up against mainstream religion

641
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:43,048
but as I was reminded in Indonesia,
in rare cases in can be a voice of hatred

642
01:05:43,323 --> 01:05:46,556
well there's one place that had
a history of dealing with hatred

643
01:05:46,865 --> 01:05:47,865
it's Israel

644
01:05:48,607 --> 01:05:53,224
so I'm curious to know how this has
affected the Metal being created here

645
01:05:55,059 --> 01:05:59,126
I think there isn't any other place special as Jerusalem

646
01:05:59,127 --> 01:06:03,858
[Kobi Farhi / Orphaned Land]
the culture of this place, this land, it's very complicated

647
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:08,256
it's very ancient on one hand,
and it's very mixed on ther other hand

648
01:06:09,063 --> 01:06:10,357
we have here a Jewish cemetery

649
01:06:10,514 --> 01:06:11,907
we have a church over here

650
01:06:11,937 --> 01:06:12,966
and we have a mosque over there...

651
01:06:13,155 --> 01:06:17,638
all Jerusalem is like this, it's some kind
of a harmony of colors, of prayings...

652
01:06:18,209 --> 01:06:22,706
everyone was here,
Abraham, Jesus, Mohammed...

653
01:06:47,091 --> 01:06:53,019
well I think this it's important for an artist
to reflect his place, his culture

654
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:57,229
the fact that we live in probably
one of the most controvesial places on earth...

655
01:06:57,938 --> 01:07:00,487
[Eran Segal / "Whorecore" / 'Evil' Haim] :
...and probably one of the more hostile places on earth

656
01:07:01,312 --> 01:07:07,442
it gets in, there's a fact of
violence everywhere and inbalance, stuff like that...

657
01:07:07,668 --> 01:07:14,308

than other bands in other places of the world

Black Metal, mostly listened to Norwegian Black Metal

659
01:07:18,344 --> 01:07:20,957
I loved them very much
and I really connected with them

660
01:07:21,018 --> 01:07:26,091
in retrospect they were singing about stories
that were told to them...

... mother, to mother, to mother

handed down for generations, but...

663

then we started to see with our own eyes,
what they were writing about in their books

you song will be more real than someone
who just read about it in history lessons...

668
01:07:58,419 --> 01:08:05,460
because we live in a country
where insanity became closer to reality

here in Jerusalem, here in Kottel and the
enitire region...

01:08:09,263 --> 01:08:13,187
the three large religions: Islam, Judaism and
Christianity are responsible for all of these wars

671
01:08:13,436 --> 01:08:17,965
always... the Jews slaughtered Christians,
Christians slaughtered Muslims,

672
01:08:18,033 --> 01:08:22,258
Muslims slaughtered the Jews,
and the cycle keeps repeating itself...

673
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:25,536
when kids in Israel turn 18,
they have to go to the army

that's one of the things that Jew may most play extreme music

our country will be destroyed

don't step forward...

with the Holocaust...

that do promote Nazi ideas...

724
01:12:39,243 --> 01:12:44,873
Varg Vikernes otherwise known as Kahn Grishnackh,
was in prison for church burning and murder in Norway

725
01:12:44,874 --> 01:12:48,443
and is known for his Fascist and racist ideas...

726
01:12:48,629 --> 01:12:52,590
I was surprised to find out that there's
also an Israeli connection to this story

727
01:12:54,260 --> 01:13:00,412
the year was 1990, Salem was just after releasing
the live demo called "Millions Slaughtered"

728
01:13:01,413 --> 01:13:05,491
it was time of the tape-trading
and the Norwegian Black Metal was just started

729
01:13:05,829 --> 01:13:07,607
that's how Grishnackh heard us...

730
01:13:07,608 --> 01:13:11,825
the title song "Millions Slaughtered"
talks about the Holocaust...

731
01:13:12,301 --> 01:13:19,117
so I guess being whoever he was, he wrote us back
"that the music was great but those lyrics are stupid"

732
01:13:19,451 --> 01:13:21,895
"it's too bad that Hitler didn't finish the job that he started"

733
01:13:21,896 --> 01:13:24,898
and it was just before the Gulf War,

734
01:13:25,632 --> 01:13:27,632
"may Saddam finish you all..."

735
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:34,950
and again, you know, this was not just lyrics
that were written and were dettached from it

736
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,520
it's a part of us...

737
01:13:36,605 --> 01:13:41,811
so obviously he we were getting angrier...

738
01:13:42,812 --> 01:13:48,532
so we got a very angry reply,

739
01:13:48,793 --> 01:13:53,074
using some cuss words,
I'm not sure you want me to repeat here...

740
01:13:54,075 --> 01:13:59,788
and about a couple of months later,
police knocks on lead singers door and goes :

741
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,435
"who hates you in Norway?"

742
01:14:01,792 --> 01:14:04,075
we had just got a bomb in the mail...!

743
01:14:28,527 --> 01:14:32,009
anywhere that we go
everybody only knows the bad news

744
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:34,339
the war and stuff like that...

745
01:14:34,389 --> 01:14:39,295
and we try to show or to be
some kind of a good news coming out of Israel

746
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:45,046
when we played in Turkey,
you'd always see people in the crowd...

747
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:49,771
they sing with us together
and they do like this with their hands

748
01:14:50,365 --> 01:14:53,478
this is what usually the Muslims are doing when they pray...

749
01:14:53,536 --> 01:14:56,094
it's like they are holding the Quran book...

750
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:59,391
it's amazing,
it's Metal people...

751
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:02,819
all these wars between religions,

752
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:06,302
all these massacres in the name of God,

753
01:15:06,382 --> 01:15:07,570
this is a big confusion...

754
01:15:08,229 --> 01:15:09,934
we all believe in same God

755
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:14,106
and we can stop all this bloodshed and confusion and war...

756
01:15:19,415 --> 01:15:22,611
I mean if we think about the Dark, we did nothing,

757
01:15:22,837 --> 01:15:25,361
there is plenty of darkness in this world...

758
01:15:25,574 --> 01:15:27,419
I think this is why we should speak about the Light...

759
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:13,760
of all the Metal fans that contacted me from around the world

760
01:16:13,827 --> 01:16:16,526
I was most shocked to hear from people in Iran

761
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:21,861
but because of the increased tensions in the area
my visa application was denied

762
01:16:21,932 --> 01:16:23,808
and I couldn't get into their country...

763
01:16:24,805 --> 01:16:27,490
so instead we're meeting the Iranians in Dubai

764
01:16:27,614 --> 01:16:31,205
where Metalheads from throughout
the region are gathering for Desert Rock.

765
01:16:31,241 --> 01:16:33,345
the only Metal festival in the Middle East...

766
01:16:33,924 --> 01:16:35,933
[Dubai, United Arab Emirates]

767
01:16:36,603 --> 01:16:39,949
"They consider it anti-moralistic"

768
01:17:14,995 --> 01:17:19,868
my name is Armin,
and I'm 28, turned 29 two days ago...

769
01:17:20,025 --> 01:17:23,380
[Armin - Fan, Iran] :
and I'm an engineer, a mechincal engineer...

770
01:17:23,728 --> 01:17:25,108
that's what I do for living...

771
01:17:25,117 --> 01:17:29,741
but Metal has been with me since my teenage era

772
01:17:30,266 --> 01:17:31,642
and I truely love it...

773
01:17:31,677 --> 01:17:38,828
can you tell me about some of the restrictions
that had been placed on getting access to Metal in Iran?

774
01:17:39,508 --> 01:17:43,024
you don't have any CDs sold,
this is the biggest restriction

775
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:45,834
the music cannot go on

776
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,238
you cannot sell Metal T-shirts

777
01:17:47,789 --> 01:17:50,185
before that even jeans were forbidden,

778
01:17:50,259 --> 01:17:54,221
long hair... I was just caught up
for just having long hair by the police

779
01:17:54,614 --> 01:17:57,659
[Ali - Musician, Iran] :
they took me to the police office

780
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:01,323
"why do you have long hair like that?"
and...

781
01:18:01,557 --> 01:18:07,900
"are you worshipping Satan?!"
or "are you in those kind of bad Metal bands?!"

782
01:18:08,347 --> 01:18:11,494
[Maher - Musician, Saudi Arabia] :
I got caught by the religious police

783
01:18:12,115 --> 01:18:14,372
for wearing a Slayer T-shirt and having long hair...

784
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:19,902
I was just back from Slayer concert in Turkey

785
01:18:20,006 --> 01:18:23,832
I almost forgot how restricted this thing is...

786
01:18:24,119 --> 01:18:26,300
[Abed - Fan, Lebanon]
I know a couple of friends who were put in jail

787
01:18:26,515 --> 01:18:28,407
they had their heads shaved
and they were beaten up,

788
01:18:28,515 --> 01:18:32,358
because the authorities really thought
they were Satanists... and they were not,

789
01:18:32,497 --> 01:18:34,197
they just looked Metal...

790
01:18:34,485 --> 01:18:37,805
they consider it anti-moralistic

791
01:18:38,184 --> 01:18:42,271
and they say that it's bringing a lot of excitement,

792
01:18:42,722 --> 01:18:45,746
which is not good for a music,
like in Islamic context...

793
01:18:50,071 --> 01:18:54,071
[SDS / Tehran, Iran - 2004]

794
01:19:00,624 --> 01:19:04,925
there had been some limited gigs
like two ro three years ago...

795
01:19:04,994 --> 01:19:07,935
there was this gig and a band called SDS

796
01:19:08,158 --> 01:19:13,279
they were covering live like from Morbid Angel and Slayer,

797
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:18,485
but no vocals was [were] allowed,
they said vocals are too harsh and aggressive...

798
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:22,477
and we had to be sitted !

799
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:24,832
later on they cancelled all the show...

800
01:19:26,365 --> 01:19:31,961
with the system that we have right now
we cannot perform Western music,

801
01:19:32,136 --> 01:19:33,419
not only Metal...

802
01:19:33,523 --> 01:19:39,918
and so, the Metal community in Iran has grown
really isolated from what had been in the real world...

803
01:19:39,955 --> 01:19:42,942
someone that we knew has sent us a picture,

804
01:19:43,047 --> 01:19:46,503
they had gone to Iran, to go visit family...

805
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:52,801
and they took a picture of Slayer
spray painted on the wall in Iran,

806
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:58,223
and they took a picture standing next to it,
so to identify that...

807
01:19:58,223 --> 01:20:02,165
they were there and this was there and this is Iran...

808
01:20:02,716 --> 01:20:08,602
and I just kinda looked at that and I thought :
wow, Slayer in a Muslim country...

809
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,040
you know what I mean?

810
01:20:10,893 --> 01:20:13,893
that had to be is just, screams "death" !

811
01:20:16,933 --> 01:20:19,076
we met with Tom in Japan

812
01:20:19,354 --> 01:20:25,750
and he described a photograph of a Slayer logo
that had been spray painted on the wall...

813
01:20:26,038 --> 01:20:28,807
wow... yeah, we got lots of that, yeah...

814
01:20:29,964 --> 01:20:32,154
have you ever seen something like that in your country?

815
01:20:32,258 --> 01:20:35,533
I have done something like that in my country... ok?

816
01:20:47,168 --> 01:20:48,958
In a lot of the Middle East,

817
01:20:49,024 --> 01:20:54,157
conservative governments and religious authorities
repeatedly censor and restrict Metal music

818
01:20:54,787 --> 01:20:58,390
but the city of Dubai seems completely
open to anything Western...

819
01:20:58,865 --> 01:21:02,188
and it's one of the fastest growing
tourist destinations in the world...

820
01:21:02,393 --> 01:21:05,970
so I am going to talk to some Metal fans
who were born and raised here,

821
01:21:06,074 --> 01:21:09,193
to get their thoughts on the spread of Metal
throughout the region...

822
01:21:09,846 --> 01:21:14,275
my full name like in Arabi tradition is
"Omar Abdula Aziz Mohammed Khan Abdula"

823
01:21:14,312 --> 01:21:16,793
our licenses are like this wide,
driver's license...

824
01:21:16,986 --> 01:21:24,614
basically this is called Qandora
or a lot of the experts call it a Dish-Dash...

825
01:21:25,427 --> 01:21:26,427
and this is a Qatran...

826
01:21:26,474 --> 01:21:28,731
basically it's not a Ku Klux Klan outfit,

827
01:21:28,768 --> 01:21:35,259
it's basically mostly white to reflect the heat of the sun,
'cause it's really hot here and gets really uncomfortable

828
01:21:35,276 --> 01:21:40,615
they do come in different colors and they're extremely
comfortable and they have a very good ventilation...

829
01:21:40,758 --> 01:21:43,245
good for playing Metal too, keeps the air flowing...

830
01:21:43,468 --> 01:21:49,032
actually, in high-school I played "Purple Haze"
on stage with a black one of these and a bandana...

831
01:21:50,141 --> 01:21:52,070
Metal is generally coming from the West,

832
01:21:52,150 --> 01:21:54,945
and I guess in a way it's a part of process of Globalization

833
01:21:55,493 --> 01:21:58,782
what's your opinion on Metal and it's spread around the world?

834
01:21:59,003 --> 01:22:01,490
if you say Globalization I know a lot of...

835
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:10,048
... like a 1500 years ago a lot of the ideas from the East
during Dark Ages crept from the East to the West,

836
01:22:10,084 --> 01:22:12,907
and I think it's just a cycle,

837
01:22:12,943 --> 01:22:17,894
you guys discovered something cool, ok, bring it over
ok, that's a nice instrument the Arabs play, their uod...

838
01:22:17,894 --> 01:22:18,894
ok, let's use that one in my song

839
01:22:19,821 --> 01:22:22,506
the Indian have the Sitar, ok let's mix that...

840
01:22:23,331 --> 01:22:27,089
I don't think it's a bad idea when it naturally happens,

841
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:31,099
so when we talk about the IMF and the World Bank,
then we can discuss...

842
01:22:33,201 --> 01:22:38,484
with the help of Internet,
obviously Internet was the main driver for Globalization

843
01:22:38,632 --> 01:22:41,284
because it's just easy to reach information,
to reach anywhere...

844
01:22:41,334 --> 01:22:46,182
I don't think anyone in the world benefitted
from MP3 downloading as much as we did...

845
01:22:46,218 --> 01:22:48,907
[Ahmid - Musician, Saudi Arabia] :
because we start discovering new bands through the Internet

846
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:50,766
downloading their music and listening to it

847
01:22:51,067 --> 01:22:54,164
specially that we couldn't get it,
we didn't have any access to it

848
01:22:54,263 --> 01:22:58,716
I apologize to all the bands, but we had to do this,
that's the only way we could discover them...

849
01:22:58,753 --> 01:23:02,591
so Lars you know, most of the fans
we're meeting around the world

850
01:23:02,611 --> 01:23:06,128
the only way they can get music is
by downloading it, the Internet...

851
01:23:06,498 --> 01:23:08,113
how do you feel about that?

852
01:23:08,157 --> 01:23:10,706
I think it great to get, I think it's great,
I mean...

853
01:23:12,156 --> 01:23:16,565
obviously it's the way to share the stuff
and I think it's awesome...

854
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:26,842
I think that we were somewhat flabbergasted at some
early Internet things that were going on a few years ago...

855
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:31,189
but we sort of, were appeased with that
and we stood champion like everybody else

856
01:23:31,865 --> 01:23:33,598
what the Internet had done, you know

857
01:23:33,844 --> 01:23:40,445
which is a great thing of bringing everything and
making everything available and global and so on...

858
01:23:40,475 --> 01:23:41,820
I mean it's just awesome...

859
01:23:43,243 --> 01:23:48,777
listen, at this point if kids can get their hands
on the music, then it's a great thing...

860
01:23:48,896 --> 01:23:52,090
[Al-Sharif - Musician, Egypt] :
Now you can download music, you can access everthing

861
01:23:52,858 --> 01:23:57,325
so it's easy for most of the people
around the Middle East to listen to Metal,

862
01:23:57,326 --> 01:23:59,766
it's gonna grow,
it's fuckin' gonna grow...

863
01:24:03,179 --> 01:24:08,825
the Desert Rock festival is like a
yearly Anniversary to Metal, basically...

864
01:24:09,122 --> 01:24:16,517
Libanon, Kuweit, Bahrain, Oman, Duha,
Saudi-Arabia, you can name every middle eastern country

865
01:24:16,553 --> 01:24:20,007
there're people out here tonight...

866
01:25:11,992 --> 01:25:14,422
it was my first show ever

867
01:25:14,501 --> 01:25:19,801
it was the day after my birthday,
best birthday party I could have...

868
01:25:20,801 --> 01:25:25,006
when you have tough times,
which in our country is not so scarce,

869
01:25:25,849 --> 01:25:27,491
it's a relief for you...

870
01:25:27,943 --> 01:25:32,824
you truely put all your ambitions, thoughts and dreams into it

871
01:25:32,931 --> 01:25:38,729
you wanna speak out and there aren't
as many outlets there should be to do this...

872
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:41,332
we found this in Metal,
it's speaking to us...

873
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:46,598
it's talking about our problems, it's talking about our wars,
about our aggression, about our oppression...

874
01:25:46,711 --> 01:25:52,405
it's giving us a chance to release all this
bottled-up anger in a positive way

875
01:25:52,724 --> 01:25:56,262
so we don't have to go and do it in a negative way

876
01:25:59,431 --> 01:26:06,582
a chance to be together and enjoy their time,
free of political shit outside...

877
01:26:07,270 --> 01:26:10,259
so this is something more than important...

878
01:26:10,587 --> 01:26:13,848
- it's essentieel.
- yeah, it's essential...

[IRON MAIDEN - Hallowed Be Thy Name]

880
01:26:26,018 --> 01:26:29,436
the stories I have heard from fans here have made me realize...

881
01:26:29,436 --> 01:26:33,272
...just how much is at stake for Metalheads
in this part of the world...

882
01:26:34,187 --> 01:26:40,564
for some of these fans, Desert Rock is the only place
where they can safely show their devotion to Heavy Metal...

883
01:26:41,487 --> 01:26:46,808
and that's far beyond anything that I have had to deal
as a Metalhead growing up in Canada

884
01:26:47,913 --> 01:26:53,126
so I traveled over 40000 kilometers
since the Wacken festival in Germany

885
01:26:53,162 --> 01:26:56,217
but there's one last stop I have to make

886
01:26:56,254 --> 01:26:59,392
I'm heading back to India, to the city of Bangalore,

887
01:26:59,741 --> 01:27:02,100
where something historic is about to happen...

888
01:27:02,742 --> 01:27:09,483
my favorite band of all time, Iron Maiden is playing
the first major Metal show is this country's history...

889
01:27:09,519 --> 01:27:12,524
and with 30000 Indian Metalhead lining up at the gates,

890
01:27:12,734 --> 01:27:16,017
this is one concert that I have to be a part of...

891
01:27:33,996 --> 01:27:38,046
this is the biggest show India will ever have,
it's gonna be great...

892
01:27:38,082 --> 01:27:41,911
I don't think you'll hear a louder crowd
anywhere in the world, because...

893
01:27:42,622 --> 01:27:45,202
I mean we haven't experienced shows like this...

894
01:27:45,349 --> 01:27:50,039
so you know, it's like 20 years of
these panned-off feelings are all gonna come out...

895

[IRON MAIDEN - Fear Of the Dark]

897
01:28:40,515 --> 01:28:46,824
aren't you surprised that your music is deeply connected
with people from so many different cultures?

[Bruce Dickinson / IRON MAIDEN]

899
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:55,268
I suppose I should, but after
years and years of traveling around the world...

900
01:28:55,871 --> 01:28:57,964
kids are kids...

901
01:28:58,371 --> 01:29:00,829
doesn't matter what culture you're come from,

902
01:29:01,132 --> 01:29:04,652
at least a certain proportion of kids
in whatever cultural society

903
01:29:04,687 --> 01:29:07,310
wanna get up and just go "arrrrrghhh", like that...

904
01:29:08,917 --> 01:29:12,879
and we kind of provide their soundtrack...

905
01:29:55,674 --> 01:29:58,764
( have you run your fingers down the wall? )

906

( Have you felt your neck skin crawl? )

907
01:30:01,239 --> 01:30:03,739
( when you're searching for the light… )

908

standing here with India's new generation of Metalheads

913
01:30:22,669 --> 01:30:25,402
I can feel the excitement in the air

914
01:30:26,264 --> 01:30:29,740
it's like I'm 13 and I'm back at my first Metal show...

915
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:36,501
I realized on this journey that although Heavy Metal
may be part of the process of Globalization

916
01:30:36,711 --> 01:30:38,617
something unique is happening...

917
01:30:38,775 --> 01:30:45,034
Metal connects with people, regadless of their
cultural, political, or religious backgrounds...

918
01:30:45,629 --> 01:30:48,818
and these people aren't just absorbing Metal from the West

919
01:30:49,333 --> 01:30:54,685
they're transforming it, creating a new outlet
they can find in their traditional cultures...

920
01:30:54,721 --> 01:31:01,822
a voice to express their discontent with chaos and uncertainty
that surrounds them in their rapidly changing societies...

921
01:31:02,103 --> 01:31:04,823
and for Metalheads all across the globe,

922
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:06,450
Metal is more than music,

923
01:31:07,056 --> 01:31:09,141
more than an identity

01:31:09,402 --> 01:31:11,010
