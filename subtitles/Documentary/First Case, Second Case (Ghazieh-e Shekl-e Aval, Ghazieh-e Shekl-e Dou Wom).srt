1
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,300
Stole the woman
of my dreams, Dave.

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,000
I ever tell you at, Brenda?

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,800
What? What's it matter now?
I said it. Anyway.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,800
Brenda and Dave-- giving
the rest of us idiots hope.

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,300
Say something nice?

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,200
David turned me down,

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,700
even after I took
my clothes off.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,700
But we've all grown up, right?

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,500
Bren, your turn.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,900
Say something to you and Dave
30 years from now,

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,700
when you're old
and shriveled

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,500
and watching this

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,600
on your Craftmatic
Adjustable Bed.

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,800
Hey, you and me,
um, 30 years from now.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
I guess...

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,600
maybe I'll think I'm crazy
for saying this,

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,200
but I can't wait
until we're old... and happy

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,400
and grandchildren
piled 'round us

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,100
on our Craftmatic
Adjustable Bed.

20
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,500
Listen up!

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,100
Who's the Einstein
that left their lights on?

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,400
Volv G3D-7L3B

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
Oh, that's me.

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,800
Uh, babe.

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,200
Give me your keys.
I'll go.

26
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,000
I forgot something
in the car anyway.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,100
A surprise.

28
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,700
Ugh, no more surprises,
please.

29
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,000
No, this is a good one,

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,600
so you don't have to tell
the proposal story all night.

31
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,700
Long as you're not
running out on me.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,900
Prevailing wisdom
is that I don't deserve you.

33
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,000
You don't.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,100
Brenda.

35
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,200
Brenda!

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,900
There's no way
she'd just disappear.

37
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,900
She probably went
to get something.

38
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,600
If she went somewhere,
she would have taken her car.

39
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,500
Brenda!

40
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,300
What is that?

41
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,000
No.

42
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,600
I really don't remember,

43
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,000
but if you say I was there,
I guess I was.

44
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,700
Her fiancé must be
real broken up.

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,700
Bet he misses her.

46
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,200
Ted Huffard, deputy sheriff

47
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,700
in Ripley, West Virginia,
sent it.

48
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,300
Pulled him over
for an illegal turn,

49
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,700
finds the plates in the trunk.

50
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,700
Car is not only stolen,
it's in felony vehicle status.

51
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,500
What for?
Seen leaving a restaurant

52
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,000
parking lot in Chestnut Hill

53
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,000
the night
Brenda MacDowell was abducted.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,700
August 12, '07.

55
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,600
Car's a late-model
gold Honda Accord.

56
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,000
Driver's side dent.

57
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,800
Reported stolen
in Grays Ferry

58
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,500
two days
before Brenda disappears.

59
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,300
Hmm, the night of
her engagement party,

60
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,700
guy lures her
out of the restaurant

61
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,500
by turning
on her Volvo's headlights,

62
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,200
then calls the plates
into the restaurant.

63
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,500
Smart trick.

64
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,300
Presumed homicide--
investigation

65
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,600
never turned up the body.

66
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,500
Looks like a happy girl.

67
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,100
There's a ribbon bouquet found
at the scene, lots of blood.

68
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,200
No matches,

69
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,400
not even hers.

70
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,500
Till now.
DNA matched this guy's?

71
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,600
Huffard offered him
a cigarette,

72
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,100
got a match off his saliva.

73
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,300
His blood.

74
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,800
So she fought back.

75
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,400
Lot of good it did her.

76
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,100
This nutjob got a name?

77
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
He calls himself John
Smith, but the number

78
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,800
on the Florida license
he was carrying

79
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,700
doesn't exist.
No match on the prints

80
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,900
and DNA's not in CODIS.

81
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,800
More like a John Doe.
We need a body

82
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,200
and a confession before he gets
to Philly and lawyers up.

83
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Tonight.

84
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,900
Who's going to take the ride?

85
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,700
Toni's making casserole.

86
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,100
You gonna play the
casserole card again?

87
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,100
I'll go.

88
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Going to need you
on call, Nick,

89
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,700
in case we get anything.

90
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,600
Chasing a bag of bones, boss.

91
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,400
Tell that to her fiancé.

92
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,400
You found Brenda?

93
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,400
You know him?

94
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,500
No, if I did,
I'd kill him myself.

95
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,100
Could be the guy

96
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,100
who reads your meter or
the grocery store clerk.

97
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,100
Never seen him before
in my life.

98
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,300
Well, thanks for taking a look,
David.

99
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,100
We'll keep you posted.

100
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,300
You know, everyone keeps telling
me I need to, uh, move on.

101
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,400
But how am I supposed
to do that?

102
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,600
I need you
to find her this time.

103
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,500
I need to bury her.

104
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,100
See what we can do.

105
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,900
I'll walk you out.

106
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,400
Take a ride?

107
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,800
West Virginia
is more than a ride.

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,300
You're talking
all night here.

109
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,900
You got something
else going on?

110
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,000
Was planning on washing my hair,
actually.

111
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,400
Still having trouble sleeping,
huh?

112
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,300
Look, you coming or not?

113
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,200
Yeah.

114
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,100
But I'm driving.
Then let's go.

115
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,100
John Smith's waiting.

116
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,100
You folks drive all night,
did you?

117
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,500
About four hours.

118
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,900
From Philly, that's flying.

119
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,200
Well, my partner's got
a lead foot.

120
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,400
Judge took care of the
extradition papers.

121
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,900
Hope y'all have better luck
getting a body out of him.

122
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,300
Plan on taking our time
getting back.

123
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,800
Give us a chance to talk.

124
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,700
He's polite, good manners.

125
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,200
Wouldn't have picked him
out of a crowd.

126
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,600
He was going nuts in his cell,
so I put him over here instead.

127
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,100
Get up now, John.

128
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,000
Detectives Rush and Valens
taking you back to Philly.

129
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,400
Man said get up.

130
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,700
Sorry, all right.
Things make it hard to stand.

131
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,800
Not meant to be comfortable.

132
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,900
I never met a female detective.

133
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,900
Certainly hope they appreciate
everything you've given up

134
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,400
to do what you do.

135
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,700
You got a real name

136
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,500
or we part of this
John Smith charade?

137
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,500
You want to talk to me.

138
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,200
Blood, DNA.

139
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,900
Already got enough
to put you away.

140
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,500
Don't need you saying jack.

141
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,600
Then why are we taking
the scenic route,

142
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,700
unless you want
to find her body?

143
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,400
Give you a chance to
help yourself, cooperate.

144
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,700
We'll talk to the DA,
see what we can do.

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,100
You a Kenso?

146
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
You sound like you're
from Kensington.

147
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,900
Port Richmond maybe.

148
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,600
I'll ask the questions.

149
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,900
Kensington.

150
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,200
There's no place to stop
for food this way, bathroom.

151
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,000
Guess you'll have
to hold it.

152
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,100
Your perfume.

153
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,800
It's flowery.

154
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,100
Not what I'd expect
from someone in your position.

155
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,700
Don't wear it.

156
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,000
Cologne then.

157
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,100
It's aftershave.

158
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,400
There's nothing flowery
about it.

159
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,200
So how'd you do it, John?

160
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Taking a child's one thing.

161
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,900
Woman like Brenda
would have screamed.

162
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,200
You see the world
in a certain way,

163
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,600
the way you want it to work.

164
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,500
You don't know that.
Are you saying

165
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,800
you two had some kind of...
relationship?

166
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,300
I'm saying

167
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,600
sometimes the pieces
of the puzzle don't fit.

168
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,000
'Cause she fought back.

169
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,400
Your blood
at the scene.

170
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,900
You get your ass
handed to you

171
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,600
by a woman, Johnny boy?

172
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm not the guy you look at
and think "rapist."

173
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,700
I'm more like the guy you see
at the dentist's office.

174
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,000
No reason to fight me.

175
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,300
So you wanted

176
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,100
to be important,

177
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,700
stand out.

178
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,300
'Cause women

179
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,300
like Brenda don't notice losers
like you.

180
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,300
A well-mannered woman like that?

181
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,700
She notices.

182
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,400
All you got to do is ask.

183
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,200
Excuse me.

184
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,900
Sorry, over here.

185
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,500
I pick up take-out
for my wife--

186
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,100
she's six months along,
craving chili fries--

187
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,000
and my car won't start.

188
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Murphy's Law, right?

189
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,900
Uh, mind if I use

190
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,400
your cell phone to call AAA?

191
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,500
Mine just died.

192
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,000
You can use
the phone inside.

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,500
Hey,

194
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,000
Brenda MacDowell, right?

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,700
I'm John Smith.

196
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,300
We ran the marathon
for Hart-Fitzgerald together.

197
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,600
You're at the firm?

198
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,800
Paralegal,
getting my degree at night.

199
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,500
Right.

200
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,400
John Smith.

201
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,100
Hey, don't worry about it.
I work in the basement.

202
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,800
You're in litigation,
right?

203
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,800
Didn't think that
WestTech case was winnable.

204
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,000
Thanks.

205
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,400
If you could, um,
you know, hurry.

206
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,200
That party in there
is for me.

207
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,300
I'm getting married.

208
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,500
Oh, congratulations.

209
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,200
Best decision
I ever made.

210
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,600
Hi, John Smith again.

211
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,800
We got cut off.

212
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,200
Right, '96 Accord.

213
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,800
Do you mind giving it a try?

214
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,400
I might have done
the trick there.

215
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,700
Hey.

216
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,300
Hey, it worked.

217
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,900
Real stunt you pulled there
at the end of the marathon.

218
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,400
Never seen a girl
so pleased

219
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,000
with her damn self.

220
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,200
Just gave us abduction,
brain trust.

221
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,200
Well, don't say

222
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,600
I never gave you anything.

223
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,700
Oh, impressive, John.

224
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,600
Any ape can hold a gun.

225
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,200
You talked to her,
roped her in.

226
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,800
You got her when she
least expected it

227
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,700
in some parking lot going
to turn off her lights.

228
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,600
She saw the world
a certain way.

229
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,300
The way she wanted it to work.

230
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,400
Makes a person

231
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,000
weak, vulnerable.

232
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,400
And that's how you work.

233
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,100
Finding their soft spot.

234
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,100
Kind of like you, Detective.

235
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,400
Well, read me well.

236
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,800
Just like you read her.

237
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,500
You a runner, John?

238
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,300
No.
What were you doing

239
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,500
at the marathon?

240
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,900
Not a paralegal,

241
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,100
are you, John?

242
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,400
<i>No John Smith</i>

243
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,600
at your fiancée's law firm,
nobody who matches

244
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,100
his description.

245
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,200
We think he was stalking her.

246
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,800
Following her routine,
knew where she worked.

247
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
We ran the marathon
together last year.

248
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,200
You see anyone suspicious?

249
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,300
Showing a real interest
in Brenda there?

250
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,200
No.

251
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,800
I just had eyes
for her.

252
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,300
<i>Oh! We did it!</i>

253
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,300
We... did it.

254
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,300
What's our time?

255
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,600
Four hours, 23 minutes,
and 13 seconds.

256
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,300
So, if I ever had any doubts

257
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,900
about what we're capable
of doing... together...

258
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,600
I mean, everything
in front of us...

259
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,100
Are you...? Bren!

260
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,200
Will you?

261
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,200
Marry me?

262
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,500
I-I'm supposed to ask!

263
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,800
I was gonna ask you!

264
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,900
So, is... is that...?

265
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,600
Yes! Yes!

266
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,200
Let's get married!

267
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,200
We'll have to check
that footage, David.

268
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,300
Give you a few minutes.

269
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,200
You meet a lot of people
like me, don't you?

270
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,100
Does it ever get any easier?

271
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,700
I'll be outside
when you're finished.

272
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,600
You can do it, Brenda.

273
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,000
That's it!

274
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,600
You okay, honey?
You all right?

275
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,100
I'm okay.

276
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,700
You scraped your knee.

277
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,000
I can do it, Daddy.

278
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,400
I want to try again.

279
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,200
Go, sweetie!
Go, Brenda!

280
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,600
Never let go, do they?

281
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,000
Ones that don't get the bodies.

282
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,500
Vera found the owner
of that gold Honda.

283
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,100
<i>Draggin' my ass</i>

284
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,300
out of bed in middle
of the night, and for what?

285
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,500
I reported that car stolen
eight months ago.

286
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,900
We need your help finding
the man who took it.

287
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,400
Have you seen this guy?

288
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,900
He the SOB who got me
my parking tickets?

289
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,100
Parking tickets?

290
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,000
Four of 'em since it's stolen.

291
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,000
Newark, all of 'em.

292
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,600
Parking guy got the VIN number
through the windshield.

293
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,700
Same cross street's on all four.

294
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,000
He's going back
to the same place,

295
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,800
staying long enough
to get ticketed.

296
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,700
His neighborhood?

297
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,000
Or where he dumped the body.

298
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,100
Thank you, Mrs. Phillips.

299
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,700
What about my damn car?

300
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,500
Don't know him.

301
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,500
Great idea, Miller:
knocking on doors

302
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,000
in the middle of the night.

303
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,000
None of these mopes
has seen the guy.

304
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,200
Memory serves, it was
your great idea, Mr. Casserole.

305
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,500
Philly PD.

306
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,700
You seen this guy?

307
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,900
Live over there,
the brown door,

308
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,200
about a year back.

309
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,700
Only cracker on the block.

310
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,900
This cracker got a name?

311
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,500
Keep to himself.

312
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Drove an old gold thing.

313
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,200
Honda?

314
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,500
Sound about right.

315
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,800
PPD! Open up!

316
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,600
Do you hear something inside?

317
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,200
I don't hear nothin'.

318
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,000
Neither do I.

319
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,100
What the hell?

320
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,300
I think we found her.

321
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,900
That smell's coming
from down here.

322
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,200
What the hell?

323
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,000
The place belongs
to a John Smith.

324
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,200
Bought it with $6,000 cash.

325
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,300
John Smith? He buys
a house with an alias?

326
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,000
I find a buyer in
this neighborhood,

327
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I ain't asking
questions,

328
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,600
either.

329
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,900
Yeah, he's ready for us.

330
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,600
Couldn't hide her forever.

331
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,100
Toilet, sink.

332
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,900
You could keep someone
alive for however long

333
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,700
you wanted.

334
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,500
How long?

335
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,500
Long enough to do this.

336
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,000
This is like a POW camp.

337
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,500
Your mind on the wall,

338
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,800
all you got.

339
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,600
Must have taken her weeks.

340
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,500
Months.

341
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
She didn't just die
in this dungeon.

342
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,800
She lived here, too.

343
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,600
We found her, John.

344
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,100
Game over.

345
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,700
You found Brenda?

346
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,100
Kept her in that

347
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,300
Newark dungeon for months

348
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,000
before you killed her.
What the hell

349
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,800
you doing with her
all that time?

350
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,100
Newark?

351
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,800
You mind opening a window?

352
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,900
Yeah, I do mind.

353
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,200
I can't breathe.

354
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,500
You didn't like

355
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,800
your cell back in
West Virginia.

356
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,400
Don't like to feel crowded.

357
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,300
You spend time in lockup, John?

358
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,700
You showing her what it feels like?
No.

359
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,300
'Cause that's where you're headed.

360
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,700
Rest of your days in a cage.

361
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,100
Yeah, pretty girl, Brenda.

362
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,800
Yes, she was.

363
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,400
Oh, so what?

364
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,500
You can't pitch a tent, Johnny?

365
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,700
That your problem?

366
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,700
You think it was about sex?

367
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,200
Power.
You can't imagine

368
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,700
a man wants to keep a woman
around without hurting her,

369
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,600
can you?

370
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,500
Not locked
in his basement, homes.

371
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,100
If I wanted to have sex,
I could pay for women

372
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,900
off the streets, in bars.

373
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,500
Common as road kill,
filth like that.

374
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Nice tail on this one.

375
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,400
Sure you didn't get
a piece of that?

376
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,500
You get a piece of that?

377
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,600
Bet you think about it,
time to time?

378
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,900
Oh, if you weren't having
your way with her,

379
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,600
why did you keep her
for so long?

380
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,300
Tell me something first.

381
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,400
What gets you out of bed

382
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
in the morning?

383
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,700
Everyone's got something

384
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,200
they hold onto.

385
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,400
Keeps them tethered
to this world.

386
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,900
No wedding ring.

387
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,100
A boyfriend, perhaps?

388
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
So what was Brenda
holding onto?

389
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,700
Love.

390
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,200
What are you doing?

391
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,500
Where am I?

392
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
You were sleeping.
You woke up.

393
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,200
You stay away from me!

394
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,300
David!

395
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
David!

396
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,600
David's not here.

397
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,700
Help!

398
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,400
Someone help me!

399
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,100
Help!

400
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,400
No one can hear you.

401
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,400
Who are you?

402
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,000
What do you want?

403
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Nothing.

404
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,100
They'll find me.

405
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,100
They won't stop
until they find me!

406
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,000
They might be looking

407
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
for you,

408
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,000
but no one's looking for me.

409
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,100
How long do you think
it'll be

410
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,800
till there's a red Mustang
in his driveway?

411
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,100
Everyone's going
to tell him to move on.

412
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,700
That's a guarantee.

413
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,500
How do you know
about David's ex-girlfriend?

414
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,100
Who are you?

415
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,900
That look on your face.

416
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,500
It's just like
little Brenda on her bike.

417
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,900
Red lips.

418
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,500
Red knee.

419
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,800
Any other kid would have run
to Mommy.

420
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,000
Not you.

421
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,600
Determined.

422
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,700
Always.

423
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,700
You don't know me.

424
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,000
I know you.

425
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm just waiting
for you to catch up.

426
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,800
That get you off, huh?

427
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,600
The mind games?

428
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
I told you once:
it wasn't about sex.

429
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,100
You wanted something.

430
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,800
Drive her nuts?

431
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,300
The chicken scrawl on the walls.

432
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,500
She tried to keep her sanity

433
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,000
for a while
by marking off the days,

434
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,700
but there was
no point to that.

435
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,300
Little Brenda.

436
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,900
You knew her
when she was a kid?

437
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,000
You're the detective.

438
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,400
Figure it out.

439
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,300
He said she was
marking off the days.

440
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,300
No windows, no lights
coming into that room.

441
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,100
So how did she know
what day it was?

442
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,800
Will, it's Rush.

443
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,700
Brenda on her bike.

444
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,400
A fall, um,
skinned knee maybe?

445
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,900
That mean
something to you?

446
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
<i>The part of the movie
where Brenda</i>

447
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,300
learned to ride her bike,
skinned her knee--

448
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,000
he must have seen it.

449
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,000
Did you show it
to anyone else?

450
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,300
No.

451
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,200
Brenda was going to show it
at the engagement party.

452
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,500
Uh, it was still in her car
when she disappeared.

453
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,600
She make it herself?

454
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,700
Or give it to one
of those places

455
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,600
that edits your
home video for you?

456
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,100
She gave it to, uh,
some company.

457
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,300
She got the movies
from our families

458
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,100
and gave them to some place.

459
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,400
She mention the name?

460
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,600
Your Best Angle.

461
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,900
Something like that?

462
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,000
It was, uh...
It was near her office.

463
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,400
John, just talked to
the owner of Best Angle.

464
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,600
Place Brenda brought
her home videos?

465
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,000
Turns out John Smith
worked there.

466
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,500
Owner says
he was their best editor.

467
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,600
Worked there for a year,

468
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,800
paid in cash,
before quitting four days ago.

469
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
Owner says he's on his way
to Marion, Illinois

470
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,900
for his next gig.
Till his bad turn in Ripley.

471
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,700
Four previous employers
since '02:

472
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,000
Life Videos in Newark,

473
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,400
Edit Right in Detroit.

474
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,800
Two more in Atlanta and Queens.
All editing houses.

475
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,600
So?

476
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,500
One client from each

477
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,600
of his jobs matches
a missing woman

478
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,800
from the same city,

479
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,400
same year.
Boss.

480
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,100
ME's preliminary report
is back.

481
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,200
Dental records on
the Newark body didn't match

482
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,400
Brenda MacDowell's.

483
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,900
Wasn't Brenda in that basement.
Newark?

484
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,800
Colleen Legarth.

485
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,700
Missing since November '06.

486
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,000
They find a cause of death?

487
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,800
No strangulation, no ligatures,

488
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,900
no broken bones.
Tox report's clean.

489
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,300
How's he killing them?

490
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,400
Five women.

491
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,300
Five cities.

492
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,800
Five basements.

493
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,100
Let Lil and Scotty know.

494
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,900
This guy is not
just a serial killer.

495
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,700
He's a collector.

496
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:38,500
Notice

497
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,000
you never use your signal.

498
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,800
Cops drive however they want.

499
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,600
Gotta have some perks

500
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,800
with the job.

501
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,100
Body in Newark wasn't Brenda.

502
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You lied.

503
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,000
I never lied.

504
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,500
You made an assumption.

505
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,700
The way you wanted
to see it.

506
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,000
Four other women locked up
out there somewhere.

507
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,500
You wanted us to know
about 'em.

508
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,200
Why?

509
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,800
How did you kill them?
Your fancy labs

510
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,600
can't tell you?

511
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,500
You watched their tapes,

512
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,800
picked them for a reason.
Somethin' you liked

513
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,300
about 'em.

514
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,600
Or hated.
You still haven't

515
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,500
told me what gets you
out of bed, Detective.

516
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,600
Tell me where Brenda is

517
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,200
and I'll make sure
you don't get the needle.

518
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,800
Is it the rush you get
from seeing dead people?

519
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,700
Has to be a reason
you became a homicide cop.

520
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,200
That what happens to you?
When you kill 'em?

521
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,700
Death's the only thing

522
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,700
that's real.

523
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,200
It's the purest thing
you'll ever see.

524
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,500
You God now?

525
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,700
Question is,

526
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,000
what's that rush covering
for you?

527
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,000
You seem to know
a lot about it.

528
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,400
Why don't you tell us?

529
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,600
When there's one thing
you hold onto,

530
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,300
it takes on

531
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,000
a special significance.

532
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,800
And when that's taken away,

533
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,200
you're left with nothing.

534
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,300
<i>Like that woman from Newark.</i>

535
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,400
<i>Colleen.</i>

536
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,900
What'd you say?

537
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,100
What'd you say?

538
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,200
That's right.

539
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm right here.

540
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,300
Look at that smile.

541
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,000
Honey!

542
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,600
She just smiled at me!

543
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,000
She smiled!

544
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,600
Look at you.

545
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,700
Beautiful as the sun.

546
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,400
Please.

547
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,100
Pretty little girl.

548
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,100
Maybe she'd like it here, too,
someday.

549
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,200
Such fragile things
they hold onto.

550
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
And when they're gone,
they just...

551
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,700
float away.

552
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:15,600
That's

553
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,700
how you kill them?
Kill them.

554
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,100
That's a funny way to put it,
really.

555
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,300
Talk about Brenda.

556
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,400
You got nothin'

557
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,800
to lose, right?
Where'd you put her body?

558
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,200
We've been talking
about that one all night.

559
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,200
Boring.

560
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,500
But not the end.

561
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,700
Not how you crushed her.

562
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,900
No, you don't talk
about that.

563
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,900
Why not?

564
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,700
It takes

565
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,500
a lot of discipline keeping
a woman locked up for months.

566
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,100
No one hearing her screams.

567
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,400
Must be a reason
you got caught now.

568
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
And made that bad turn.

569
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,700
Meticulous guy

570
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,300
like you.
Something rattled you.

571
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,500
No. You're wrong.

572
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,000
Got under your skin.
For you to make

573
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,900
a mistake like that.

574
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,900
I don't make mistakes!

575
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Brenda's still alive,
isn't she?

576
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,500
You know, I think
I'm done talking.

577
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,400
<i>He left Philly</i>

578
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,500
four days ago.
If she's still alive,

579
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,000
we don't have much time.
I dug up all the victims.

580
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,800
Newark's the only city
where you have

581
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,700
both the abduction site
and the dump site.

582
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,100
The abduction took place here.

583
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,000
Here's the basement.

584
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,200
Less than a 20-minute drive.

585
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,400
He gets them inside before
the chloroform wears off.

586
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,500
He's finding basements
in poor neighborhoods

587
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,000
where no one sees anything,
says anything.

588
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,800
Here's the restaurant

589
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,900
where Brenda was abducted.

590
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,800
Searching a 20-minute radius,

591
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,800
three low-income

592
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,000
neighborhoods fall inside.

593
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,300
Our contact at the recorder's
office is looking for properties

594
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,400
bought in cash for less

595
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,900
than ten grand by John Smith.

596
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,600
I'll see how's Miller doing
on the videos?

597
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,300
Got Tech Support

598
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,100
out of bed,

599
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,300
downloaded the movies
John Smith made of his victims.

600
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
What's the common thread?

601
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,900
We know that, we find Brenda.

602
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,700
We dreamed about this day
for so long.

603
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,500
And here you are.

604
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,100
Different classes,
different ages.

605
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,100
Some had families;
some didn't.

606
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,400
Only thing

607
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,100
in common is...

608
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
they all had something
to live for.

609
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Fiancé,

610
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,400
kid, God.

611
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,900
Wide net there.

612
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,200
Maybe not so wide.

613
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,300
Monica had God.

614
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,400
Colleen had her baby.

615
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,300
And Brenda had David.

616
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,100
Chose women with something
to live for.

617
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,800
Someone they loved.

618
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,900
Not something
you'd know about.

619
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,600
Must have driven you crazy.

620
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,500
All the things they had.

621
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,400
Not you, though.

622
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,000
I edited their sloppy lives
into something beautiful.

623
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,800
I gave them a way
to believe the delusions

624
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,000
they were hanging onto.

625
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,600
Delusions? Look who's talking.

626
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,500
What's on those videos
isn't who they are.

627
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,800
It's a charade.

628
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,700
To give their lives meaning.

629
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,200
Like the job gives your life

630
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,100
meaning.
I've had it with your BS.

631
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,000
Where's Brenda?

632
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,500
Don't pretend you don't know
what I mean, Detective.

633
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,100
Where'd you put
her body, you freak?

634
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,400
No, I, I do.

635
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,300
I know what you mean.

636
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,900
Who are you
when it's taken away?

637
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,400
The job.

638
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,700
No one.

639
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,100
Like them.

640
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,000
Even the one who had God.

641
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,400
Monica.

642
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,100
The singer.

643
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,800
She gave up the easiest.

644
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,300
She couldn't understand

645
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,000
how God could leave her
in that room so alone.

646
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,000
<i>I saw it in her eyes.</i>

647
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,100
<i>The moment she realized
there was no God.</i>

648
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,000
<i>That if God was anything,</i>

649
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,500
<i>he was the greatest
con man of all.</i>

650
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,600
Once hope is gone,

651
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,100
dying is just a formality.

652
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,100
You sealed her in there alive?

653
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,100
First, I took the door
off its hinges.

654
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,200
She was free to go, run.

655
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,800
I wouldn't have stopped her.

656
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,100
But she wasn't looking
for a way out anymore.

657
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,800
Sounds like you're...

658
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,800
familiar, Detective.

659
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Son of a...

660
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
Where's Brenda?

661
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,100
Hmm?

662
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,100
Where is she?

663
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,500
Scotty!
Hmm?

664
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,600
Hey! Stop!

665
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,800
She's here.

666
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,500
In these woods.

667
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,100
A mile further,
there's a blinking yellow light.

668
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,600
Path to the right
heads into the woods.

669
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,800
A quarter mile in,
there's a clearing.

670
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,700
Put him in the car.

671
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,500
I'll drive.

672
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,500
I'm going in.

673
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,500
The guy's got
an endgame, Lil.

674
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,900
Who knows what he's got
waiting in those woods?

675
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,000
We're running out of time.

676
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
But we know his pattern.

677
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,300
Houses, basements.

678
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,000
Not woods.
What if we're wrong

679
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,500
and she's in there right now?

680
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
No service.

681
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,500
We don't have time
to wait for backup.

682
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,000
We're armed. He's not.

683
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,900
You ready to pull the trigger?

684
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,800
Let's go.

685
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,000
Try anything,
I'll blow your head off.

686
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,100
You get Lil or Scotty
on the line yet?

687
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,800
Cell phone keeps
dumping to voice mail.

688
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,500
Last time they called
was Waynesburg.

689
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,300
Nothing between here
and there but lumber.

690
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,000
The hell are they doing?

691
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Going renegade.
With a psychopath in custody.

692
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,900
Almost there.

693
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:39,900
Keep moving.

694
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,400
Know these woods
pretty good.

695
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,800
This where you're from,
you sick bastard?

696
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,300
What's that?

697
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,200
Got something.

698
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,200
If only you had

699
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,600
videos of your own.

700
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,900
Of course, there'd be
no one in them.

701
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,900
No one to show them to.
Shut up.

702
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,800
I'm taking a look.

703
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,600
Scotty...

704
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,700
I got it.

705
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,100
What do you got?
Nothing.

706
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,700
It's a dried-up well.

707
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,500
You said you wanted to know
what happened

708
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,300
to Brenda.
Well, Brenda's not in there.

709
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,800
No, but someone else is.

710
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,600
So cold.

711
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,600
So cold...

712
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,100
So cold...

713
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,300
Please help me!

714
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,200
It was the most beautiful thing
I ever saw.

715
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,500
Watching a woman die?

716
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,200
Watching her give up.

717
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,800
The rest is just a formality.

718
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,900
We understand each other
finally.

719
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,400
Dungeons like this well.

720
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,900
You were trying
to recreate this, hmm?

721
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,800
Who was she?
Nobody.

722
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,300
I came here.

723
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,200
I listened to your story.

724
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,400
Now tell me where Brenda is.

725
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,700
You're just like them,

726
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,100
trying to hold on
to something make-believe.

727
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,100
Because there will
always be another

728
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,100
Brenda out there, another me.

729
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,800
Maybe it's time you see,
detective,

730
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,300
how false your God is.

731
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,000
Tell me where she is.

732
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,300
Looks like
we've run out of time.

733
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,400
Where is she?!

734
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,200
She's dead.

735
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,300
No.

736
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,700
Pull the trigger!

737
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,700
You son of a...

738
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,400
Lil, it's what he wants.

739
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,400
Can't spend his life

740
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,700
in a cell like his
victims did.

741
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,400
That's why he brought us
out here.

742
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,900
She was weak.

743
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,000
Like you.

744
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Brenda's alive.

745
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,300
I know she is.

746
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,300
She wasn't like that woman
in the well; she was strong.

747
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,400
You need to believe that,
but you're wrong.

748
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,100
No.

749
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,200
She broke in that dark, lonely,

750
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,200
little room.

751
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Just like one day
you will, too.

752
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,400
You can't tread water
forever.

753
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,700
Eventually,
you'll get tired

754
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,900
just like Brenda.
No, that song.

755
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,300
She was humming
that song.

756
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,400
"Chasing far all gloom
and terror,

757
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,700
"brightening all the path

758
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,700
we tread."

759
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,900
The bells at Ascension Church
in Kensington

760
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,900
have been playing that song

761
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,600
every morning
since I was a kid.

762
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,500
That's how Brenda knew
what day it was.

763
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,200
That's how she held on.

764
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,100
I told you, she's dead.

765
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,100
Even in the ugliness
of Kensington,

766
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,600
she found something to cling to,
something beautiful.

767
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,600
She didn't break,
did she, John?

768
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,500
She never gave up.

769
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,500
Because when it was all taken
away in the end,

770
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,100
she still had herself.

771
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,200
I know where that church is.

772
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,400
I know that neighborhood.

773
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,400
Find her, Lil.

774
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,900
Don't walk away from me!

775
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,200
Don't you leave!
