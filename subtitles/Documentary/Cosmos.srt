00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,687
An espresso, please.

3
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,332
Hi.

4
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,002
Hi.

5
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:24,707
Another.

00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,589

Another.

10
00:02:58,645 --> 00:02:59,577
Morille...

11
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,110
don't blame me if you explode.
- Fine.

12
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,289
Another.

13
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,511
Planning to fuck a gorilla?

14
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,022
Worse.

ROLE OF JULIETTE

18
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,117
Getting violent won't help.

19
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,123
I don't know what's wrong.

20
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,758
I parked it here,
and now it won't start.

21
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,228
I absolutely have
to get it running.

22
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,525
I bought it just for today.

23
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,664
It's gotta start. It's gotta.

24
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:10,205
It must be the cold. It's hard
on cars, especially old cars.

25
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,271
It ran fine yesterday.

26
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:16,207
Cars are like women.
Yesterday, yes. Today, no.

27
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:20,716
It's ok, all it needs is boost.
I can do it.

28
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,532
Don't worry, there's
solution to every problem.

29
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:43,208
And if it won't run,
I'll drive you in my cab.

30
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,910
No, it's not that.

31
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,873
The car's a surprise.

32
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,845
For a friend,
to boost his morale.

33
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,145
Know how this works?

34
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,012
It's simple.
A question of contact.

35
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,722
Positive with positive.

36
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,752
Negative with

37
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,050
negative.

38
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,660
Careful,
you'll short the system.

39
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:07,989
Red is positive. It's dangerous,
it carries the current.

40
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,962
Connected to positive

41
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,671
on the battery, no problem.

42
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,866
Got it?

43
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,313
So, your friend is feeling low?

44
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:23,876
Did he lose his mother?

45
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,241
Did he lose his job?

46
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,353
Ok, now start your car.

47
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,803
You saved my life!

48
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,479
Now, something
very important...

49
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:59,284
Keep driving long enough
to recharge the battery, ok?

50
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,148
If you stop too soon,
it may conk out again.

51
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,750
How long should I drive?

52
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,184
An hour.

53
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,363
Just an hour? You sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

54
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:17,674
Sorry.

55
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,145
MISSING

56
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,824
You're a lousy bastard!

57
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,598
One, it's my only vacation
all year.

58
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,359
Two, I'm supposed to defend
your client

59
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,595
who has absolutely
no chance of winning.

60
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,536
Ever won against
a handicapped woman?

61
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,676
Shut up! Shut up!

62
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,705
Three, and above all,

63
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,507
you're going
on our ski trip without me.

64
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,513
Shut up, I said.

65
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,213
Bring me the trial papers
in person at my hotel.

66
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:02,791
Simon, you're a goddamn rat.

67
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,540
No, that's alright.

68
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,711
Could you wait one second?

69
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,420
Hello, this is
Fanny Grandmaison.

70
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,359
Alas, I'm away from the phone
at the moment, so please

71
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:40,759
leave me a message after
the following little beep.

72
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,142
That's not why I was calling.

73
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,815
We received the new collection.

74
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,976
Yeah, gorgeous.

75
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,048
No, spring.

76
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,746
Tops, skirts...

77
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,220
Yeah, short. Very short.

78
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,160
You better have nice legs.

79
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,093
Yeah, it's really beautiful.

80
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,332
I bought myself a few things.

81
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,672
No, a sort of top.

82
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,507
In fake fur. Black and white.

83
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,439
Like zebra skin. Amazing.

84
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,715
Better hurry, it's going fast.

85
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,749
Hold on a second, ok?

86
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,500
Can I help you?

87
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,834
No, thanks, I'm just looking.

88
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,307
If you need anything,
I'm right over there.

89
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,790
Sorry.

90
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,318
I can't this weekend.

91
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,386
I have to work.

92
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,197
Bummer!

93
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,997
I told this friend a while ago
I'd fill in for her.

94
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,001
No, I can't.

95
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,179
An eclipse Saturday night?

96
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,945
No, two eclipses in a row,
I prefer to stay home.

97
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,449
You have another call?

98
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,025
Yeah, hurry, I'll wait.

99
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,707
Is it a present?

100
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,842
Yeah, I'll take this one.

101
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,171
Sorry, I thought...

102
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,905
Forget it.

103
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,446
A very good choice.

104
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,215
$49.95 with tax.

105
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,160
When you came last week

106
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:12,097
I didn't know this one
would be vacant.

107
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:16,331
A young couple, and, well,
they're splitting up...

108
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,510
It'll go fast,
it's a great location...

109
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:22,179
it's bright,
it's got everything.

110
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:26,441
And, if you want to repaint,
we'll supply the paint.

111
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:30,143
We prefer pastel colors,
but it's up to you.

112
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:34,553
The carpeting was changed
last year. It's very clean.

113
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:38,456
I think it's perfect.
You don't have to touch it.

114
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,858
It's very soundproof.
Because...

115
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,797
An older lady lives next door,
she's very nice.

116
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:48,529
No complaints.
Also two students, very quiet.

117
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,241
Yes, the bedroom...

118
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,871
You see, behind here, a closet.
Very practical.

119
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,913
The bed's not very
practical there. You could...

120
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,745
God, I almost forgot.
Here there's a spot

121
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,150
for an air conditioner.

122
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,894
It's practical
because the sun comes in...

123
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,150
Well, that's it.

124
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,354
You're so pale.
Are you feeling alright?

125
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,424
Yes, I'm fine. I'll take it.

126
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,960
Great!
You've made a good choice.

127
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,959
Is a parking space included?
- Yes.

128
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,334
Is it possible to see it?

129
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:03,136
It's so handy, not to have
to worry about parking.

130
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,247
I'll show you your locker.

131
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:08,920
It's easy to remember, P-2...
What am I saying?

132
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:10,815
I mean, P-3.

133
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,849
Excuse me.
- Bless you.

134
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,977
Pine and St Urban.

135
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,133
<i>Montreal police arrested</i>

136
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:14,038
<i>a suspect earlier today in the rape</i>
<i>and murder of Julie Dumouchel</i>

137
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,043
<i>who disappeared last week</i>
<i>and whose body...</i>

138
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:36,462
<i>All three women were found</i>
<i>with a flower in their hands</i>.

139
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,671
<i>A man, whose identity</i>
<i>cannot be released</i>

140
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,135
<i>will be questioned shortly</i>.

141
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,569
They should cut off his balls!

142
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,910
Did I wake you?

143
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,912
What's that?
- Surprise!

144
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,487
I thought we should do
something special.

145
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,486
What for?

146
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,585
The clinic at 2:00...

147
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,097
Changed your mind?

148
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,133
Would you prefer to be alone?

149
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,843
No, it's not that.
- Wait a sec.

150
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,577
Take a good look.

151
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,027
It's the same!

152
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:15,696
It's not an Austin Healy,
but I repainted it.

153
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,967
I'll get dressed.

154
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,870
Quite the spicmobile!

155
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,082
Spicmobile? Joel Cadieux!

156
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,716
If Antonio were here,
he'd blast you!

157
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:37,649
Come off it, no one would
dare blast a homosexual.

158
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:39,948
We're a protected race, too.

159
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,659
Some privilege!

160
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,085
You said it.

161
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:50,497
It's just like my little car.

162
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,369
How'd you remember?

163
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,507
You only mentioned it
a million times.

164
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,337
Don't exaggerate.

165
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:00,602
It's true.

166
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,371
So what? It was my lucky charm.

167
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,452
Well, where to?

168
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,319
Yannie, it's getting late.

169
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,529
Joel, hand me your watch.

170
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,023
We have time, ok?

171
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,841
We have plenty of time.

172
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,447
Excuse me,
I think I'm going to be sick.

173
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:23,149
Could you?
I think I'm going to throw up.

174
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,928
Too much booze, huh?

175
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,968
A good coffee
and you'll be set for the day.

176
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,684
No, it's not booze.

177
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:54,985
I don't know what it is.

178
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,356
My nerves, maybe.

179
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,158
Ok, let's go.
- Feeling better?

180
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:02,525
Yeah, thanks.

181
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:03,961
If you're ok...

182
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,402
Can I ask you
why you're so nervous?

183
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,501
I'm going to be interviewed.
- Interviewed?

184
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,305
Like on TV?

185
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:15,837
Yeah, on TV.

186
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,844
It's about a film I made.

187
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,050
A film?

188
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,651
You mean, with a big camera
and beautiful women?

189
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:27,682
No, a small camera and...
well, one beautiful woman.

190
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,253
That's good, I like films.

191
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,893
What's it about?

192
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,141
A guy and his girlfriend

193
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,039
who are trapped
by fighting in Cambodia.

194
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,373
Yeah, and they find
themselves...

195
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,913
Well, not really
find themselves...

196
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:56,678
They get taken...
taken hostage, and then...

197
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,116
No, not hostage,
it's more like...

198
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:04,019
No, it sounds complicated,
but it's simple.

199
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:08,164
They're forced, to escape,
to take some of the rebels...

200
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,926
So the hostages
take their guard hostage.

201
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,267
Yeah, exactly.

202
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:18,674
The hostages' hostage.
Great idea.

203
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,538
Kaputt the fascists!

204
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,781
Not much bang-bang in my film.

205
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,583
Then what's it about?

206
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,149
It's about vulnerability...

207
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:36,226
fear and...

208
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,862
time stretching out.

209
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,191
Oh. Vulnerability
and time stretching...

210
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,696
Like an elastic?

211
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,266
HOSTAGE OF HOSTAGES

212
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:46,970
Sounds good.

213
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,767
But why do a film about that?

214
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,943
Well, it's because

215
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,174
something similar
happened with my ex.

216
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,441
It's more about her
than anything else.

217
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:02,584
I see.

218
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:06,584
Once my brother and I
were shot at by the militia.

219
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,122
When you're young

220
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,955
is the time to get shot at.
Later you're too old.

221
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,225
Were you scared?

222
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,067
Very scared. Many bullets.

223
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:22,770
We had to find a solution,
the right solution.

224
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,875
It went on for... for...

225
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,510
It seemed like...

226
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,873
How do you say...

227
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,605
the time it takes
a tree to grow?

228
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:33,742
An eternity.

229
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,782
Right, an eternity.

230
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:37,612
Eternity.

231
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,719
Fear, elastics...

232
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,756
I like it. You have good ideas.

233
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,854
Brings back memories
of my youth.

234
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,827
That's the point.
- Listen...

235
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,770
I have good idea. I like you...

236
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,934
If you're going to be on TV,
you need better hair.

237
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:01,407
So, for you, $15.

238
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:02,874
Everyone else, $25.

239
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,274
But for you, $15.

240
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,381
Thanks, but...
- Listen, for TV...

241
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:10,611
For TV you need good hair.
It's very important for TV.

242
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,018
Believe me, with good hair,
you're less nervous.

243
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:18,695
It's not that. I'm not nervous
because of my hair.

244
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,093
I don't know if
what I say makes sense.

245
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,134
It takes many cents
to make a film.

246
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,463
That's true.

247
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,004
Here we are.

248
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,337
<i>Hair Shop</i>

249
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,708
It's for hair, not TV.

250
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,709
It has to be here.
- Ok.

251
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,248
You'll do fine.
- Thanks.

252
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:40,610
Good luck.

253
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,587
Can I help you?

254
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,584
Can I help you?

255
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,458
Yes, I'm...
- Morille Zootrovski?

256
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,632
I'm the show's researcher.
I told Marie to invite you.

257
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,132
<i>Today we talk painting,</i>
<i>film, music...</i>

<i>Of course, for hair,</i>
<i>Madrid is really huge</i>.

259
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:40,137
<i>Body painting:</i>
<i>Michael will focus on armpits</i>.

260
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:44,906
<i>And a huge surprise, you can feel</i>
<i>it, everyone here's super pumped</i>.

261
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,947
The Cyberdogs!

262
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,115
Ok, cool. An in-depth
2-minute interview.

263
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,324
Your film, prizes in Berlin,

264
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,958
background, friends,
and your look.

265
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,855
I'll take you to Tekno.

266
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,326
Ok, Smooth, hurt me!

267
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,464
In art what's important is

268
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:38,226
to look convincing.
Hesitation kills you.

269
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:43,664
Take you, you look really
convincing. You an actress?

270
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,274
Which bar?

271
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,675
I love the smell of this gel.

272
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,514
It smells like...

273
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,743
I can't describe it.

274
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,816
It smells like...

275
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,693
like L.A.
- Exactly!

276
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:08,661
Tekno, this is Morille,
our third guest.

277
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:10,599
Hi, Morille.

278
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:14,464
Ok, Maurice, I'll take care
of you. Who are you?

279
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:15,936
I'm lost.

280
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,766
Morille makes films.

281
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,281
Ok, ok, that inspires me.

282
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:26,540
Trust me.
Leave everything to Tekno.

283
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,785
David Bowie changed
his hair color.

284
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,790
Technitium copper 45.

285
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,228
It was excellent.

286
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:51,074
Gilbert, bring me
the atomic gloves please.

287
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,971
I'm Nadja,
I'll be interviewing you.

288
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,907
I'm Morille.
- Hi, Maurice!

289
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,946
I haven't seen your film.
Do you do videos?

290
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:01,947
No, I think...

291
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:05,053
We don't have much time.
Know the net?

292
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,452
Perfect!

293
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,125
Questions will come from me,
on the web...

294
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,294
Callers will have questions...

295
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,794
in Tokyo, Paris, N Y. You'll be
bouncing off satellites.

296
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,159
Ready for this?

297
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:17,466
I guess.

298
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:20,466
You're lucky cause
the Cyberdogs

299
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,832
are on just before you.
Know them?

300
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,908
Geniuses!

301
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:28,044
They're post-hallucinatory,
it's so cool!

302
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,213
I can introduce you after.

303
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,947
Keep cool, Tekno's doing you.

304
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:39,184
She's a babe.
You do videos, Maurice?

305
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,526
Do you really have to?

306
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,092

00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,921
<i>He's amazing! Thanks, Gilles!</i>

327
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:02,595
Perfect, cool. Your turn.

328
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,160
Great, Tekno. It's perfect.

329
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:09,634
I could stick a feather up my ass.
- There isn't time.

330
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,834
Five, four, three...

331
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:46,942
Ok, Maurice is here to talk about
his film. It's very special.

332
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,169
Hi, Maurice. Things ok?

333
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:53,008
Before we talk about your film
and upcoming videos

334
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:56,550
I want to ask Tekno
what he did with your hair.

335
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:57,981
Hey, baby.

336
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,452
Ok, one big job for Tekno...

337
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:04,225
It's hip, fashionable,
totally too much.

338
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,329
For the director,
Tekno created a concept...

339
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:10,557
We used Asa for more light,
more sheen.

340
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:14,603
Look at the shaping
around his ear.

341
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,045
Move and I shave her!

342
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,483
Keep cool, Maurice.

343
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:34,057
Relax, everything's fine.

344
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,016
We're your friends.

345
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:30,638
Your hair!
What did TV do to your hair?

346
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:38,871
Antoine! Antoine!

347
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,877
I don't have time!

348
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,255
I have to tell you my dream!

349
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,293
Your dream?

350
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:57,467
Not now.
- The worst yet, with those atoms.

351
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:58,532
Atoms?

352
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:02,933
100 years ago we discovered
what makes up atoms.

353
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,143
Now we're seeing it's not true.
- Oh yeah?

354
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,902
Atoms aren't made up of matter.

355
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,909
They're made up of energy.
Matter doesn't exist.

356
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,881
We're made up of nothing.
It's completely absurd.

357
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:20,113
Yeah, it sure is absurd.
What was your dream?

358
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,952
I'm being chased by 30 hit-men.

359
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:24,353
I'm exhausted.

360
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,495
I fall, and a plane hits me.

361
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,096
A plane? Not bad.

362
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:32,200
I open my eyes. I can't see
or hear or smell anything.

363
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:33,733
Like atoms...

364
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,201
So you're...
- I'm dead.

365
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,136
But then I realize
only my body is dead.

366
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,572
My conscience
is still alive, see?

367
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:46,078
So I'm stuck with myself and my
bloody ideas for all eternity.

368
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,784
It's hell, huh?

369
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:49,945
Not bad.

370
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:53,351
I'll do some research.
See you, ok?

371
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:54,389
Ok, thanks.

372
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,460
Bye, Antoine.
- Bye, Julien.

373
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:59,460
Part one is the fear of others.

374
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,766
Part two is the fear
of yourself. Hi, Julien.

375
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:09,735
Jules. You only called me Julien
when I got on your nerves.

376
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:10,998
That's true.

377
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,142
Or when I wanted to fuck.

378
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,747
How are you?
You haven't changed a bit.

379
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:17,879
I haven't?

380
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:20,606
Yeah, I'm fine.
You've changed.

381
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,546
Think so? Funny.

382
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:27,080
Haven't smoked in 3 years.
- It's been 3 years?

383
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,019
Hold on, 5 years.

384
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:31,692
I left you on my 25th birthday.

385
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,397
Yeah, you said
we'd stay friends.

386
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:37,499
You answered:
Like brother and sister.

387
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:43,071
But you, there's something
different about you.

388
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:44,296
I'm older.

389
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,238
No, it's...
you're not so granola.

390
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,579
Your zits are gone.
- Zits?

391
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:52,510
Not zits,
but you had skin trouble.

392
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,741
Now your skin looks good.

393
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:57,078
I got new breasts.
- What?

394
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,446
Three months ago.

395
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,056
Go on, look.

396
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,118
May I?

397
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:07,788
Sure.

398
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:14,862
Like, I always look
at women's breasts.

399
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:17,164
Always, with every woman.

400
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,899
But I wait
for the right moment.

401
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:24,404
When they're not looking,
or when I have on sunglasses.

402
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:28,982
When they sneeze... you always
close your eyes when you sneeze.

403
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,154
You haven't changed, Jules.

404
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,618
You're exactly the same,
but worse.

405
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:34,620
Worse?

406
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:38,693
Don't feel embarrassed.
I'm the same with men's butts.

407
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:39,827
You are?

408
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:52,170
You're embarrassed to look
because you know I'll see you.

409
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,570
Staying on, Mme Grandmaison?

410
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,302
Did you get married?

411
00:41:56,547 --> 00:42:00,039
I changed my name.
Stéphanie Little didn't cut it.

412
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:04,152
Yes, I'm staying. But my
luggage is with the concierge.

413
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,446
But I did get married.

414
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,454
Antoine,
bring Mme Grandmaison's bags.

415
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,287
I'm afraid we're fully booked,
Madame.

416
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,792
Shit!

417
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:16,992
There's a king-sized bed
in my room.

418
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,230
I mean, if it's of any help.

419
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:23,634
Sorry, but several floors
are being renovated

420
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,741
and with the hearing-impaired
convention...

421
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:31,004
Deaf, not hearing impaired.
Even the deaf say deaf.

422
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,874
Take them to this
gentleman's room, please.

423
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,150
See you later.

424
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:42,314
Jules...

425
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:47,023
I need an office where I can
work all night, not a bed.

426
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:49,357
Is that clear?
No sex, got it?

427
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,832
What do you think I am?
- The same old guy.

428
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,339
What are you up to?

429
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,270
I read.
I study languages, I read.

430
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,102
I mean, professionally.

431
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:05,247
I'm an interpreter. My client's
here, she's very nice.

432
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:07,313
May I see your breasts?

433
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:09,319
What?

434
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:11,681
Your breasts.

435
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:18,650
Look me in the eyes
and repeat your question.

436
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:23,224
May I see
your breasts... naked?

437
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,603
No way.
- No?

438
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,999
As a friend.
- What do you mean?

439
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,176
I haven't seen you in 5 years.
It may be a while again.

440
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:36,504
Your renovated breasts
are amazing.

441
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,647
Amazing! You exaggerate.

442
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:42,113
I just want to see them, that's all.
- That's all?

443
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:45,447
As a present. Just an innocent,
teeny-weeny peek.

444
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:48,783
Like that,
with no ulterior motives.

445
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:53,757
You must want them
to be admired, if they're new.

446
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,623
I mean, for the price you paid.

447
00:43:56,867 --> 00:44:00,826
It wasn't just for yourself
that you bought... had them...

448
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,403
Enlarged.
Blown up, if you prefer.

449
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,767
Silicone?

450
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:09,772
I'm old enough to know it's
impossible for a 30-year-old man

451
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:14,383
to have just a teeny-weeny peek
at an old girlfriend's breasts

452
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:16,643
especially in a hotel room.

453
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:17,943
Why?

454
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,521
Oh, Simone.

455
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27,864
Simone, this is...

456
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,564
Fanny, this is my client,
Simone Leduc.

457
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,202
Simone Leduc?

458
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:36,664
Hello.

459
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,150
She's charming.

460
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,090
What exactly is your job, Joe?

461
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:56,292
Joe!

462
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,424
I'm interpreting
for her in court.

463
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:03,099
Tomorrow at 10:30,
room 24, at the courthouse.

464
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,595
You know her?

465
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:09,498
Your client is my rival. She's
the reason I'm not going skiing.

466
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:13,775
I have to work through the
night to make sure she loses.

467
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:17,503
We'll be seeing a lot
of each other this week.

468
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:24,151
No, wait, conflict of interest.
I can't do this.

469
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,288
If my client finds out...

470
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,187
There's no conflict.

471
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,894
We won't mix work and pleasure.

472
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:33,991
Pleasure, Jules?

473
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:38,264
Coming?
- If you insist.

474
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,427
I insist.

475
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:45,935
Hold my hand. I've become
claustrophobic in elevators.

476
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,637
Poor guy.
- No, it's true, I swear.

477
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:54,341
I liked your breasts. I mean...

478
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:59,613
they weren't big, but they were
nice. They had guts, character.

479
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,948
They were well-proportioned

480
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:04,524
soft, round...

481
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:06,994
pointed, too, sometimes.

482
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:10,132
Why are you scared
to show me them now?

483
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:13,234
I'm not scared.
I just don't feel like it.

484
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:16,098
Feeling...
a word you don't know.

485
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:19,767
All that drives you
is your pseudo-brain

486
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:23,309
your little ego.
You've no instincts, Jules.

487
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:27,415
You're lost in your head,
in your world of theories.

488
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:30,552
Ah, nostalgia!
Sweet memories flood back.

489
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:34,952
Your body's going to rot! When's
the last time you exercised?

490
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:36,819
You don't like my body?

491
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,894
At least it's mine.
I didn't have my dick enlarged.

492
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,621
Maybe you should.

493
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:47,804
What's with this incredible
fad in society today?

494
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:51,605
Is it because we're
approaching the year 2000?

495
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,003
Everything's fake, Stéphanie!

496
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:55,211
Stéphanie?

497
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:57,413
Athletes take steroids.

498
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,879
We manipulate genes
to create the perfect human.

499
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:04,554
Fashion's replaced politics.
Machines think for us.

500
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:08,280
Our value system disappeared
along with religion.

501
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:12,256
The result: An enlarged risk
of breast cancer.

502
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:15,765
To think I used to
listen to you.

503
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,900
Good thing I saw the light
after a few months.

504
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:21,900
No, we left each other,
after a year.

505
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:26,132
A year? Incredible what you'll
put up with for a lay.

506
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:29,976
May I see your breasts?

507
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:31,647
What's the point?

508
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:35,409
I mean, I've seen your body.
I've seen you naked.

509
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,984
How many times? 200? 250?

510
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:39,746
No, correction!

511
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:43,955
The student will remind
her master of his teachings.

512
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,889
With recycling...

513
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:49,326
our atoms, our dear atoms,
are replaced...

514
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:53,559
The conclusion: You never saw
this body. It's a new model.

515
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:56,602
And new models are expensive.

516
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,807
Expensive! My God,
how can I have been so dense?

517
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:04,603
I see, expensive.

518
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:07,976
How much?

519
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:15,747
I reveal my precious jewels
in exchange for

520
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:19,628
a tiny little favor,
quite harmless.

521
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,420
Broken telephone.

522
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,165
Broken telephone?

523
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:34,136
Tomorrow, in court...

524
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:38,942
you're your client's
only means of communication.

525
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:41,446
You become
Simone Leduc's voice,

526
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:44,017
so you can manipulate
her answers

527
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,449
and make her lose, like that.

528
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,415
She'll lose
her case - tomorrow.

529
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,458
I can prove she's guilty
in a few days

530
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:55,790
but why waste our time,
and the judge's?

531
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:04,840
You'd do that?

532
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,200
Relish, mustard
and lots of ketchup.

533
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:40,539
It's been a while.
On vacation?

534
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,643
No. Five hotdogs, please.

535
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:45,638
Coming up!

536
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:09,798
What do you want on them?

537
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:01,424
Thanks.

538
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:11,298
Shit! Would you pass me
the cloth from the back?

539
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,066
Thanks.

540
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:30,846
The Santa Claus parade
was here.

541
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,821
I was so excited,
I wet my pants.

542
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:41,421
Parades are so dumb.

543
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:47,436
I caught my dick
in my snowsuit once.

544
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:52,608
It was during a parade.
Dad took me aside to pee.

545
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,378
It was freezing out.

546
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:59,875
I tried to hurry, so I pulled
hard to do up my suit and...

547
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:02,045
in the zipper!

548
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,881
I cried so hard.

549
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,830
I am, Yannie.

550
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:53,898
I'm certain I am.

551
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:04,077
No, Yannie, don't!

552
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:06,441
Yannie, don't!

553
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:09,215
Don't do it!

554
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:33,740
What'll it be?

555
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,346
Ok, to recapitulate
the situation.

556
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:41,415
I make my client lose her case
and in exchange...

557
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:44,944
in exchange you show me
your breasts, right?

558
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:46,348
Right away.

559
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:49,989
Just give me the signal.

560
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:54,430
What are you looking at?

561
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:01,762
You've changed, so much.

562
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:05,338
Being a lawyer is a way
of life, not just a job.

563
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:09,978
Did your class vote you Bitch
of the Year? It's unethical!

564
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:11,737
Ethyl alcohol?
- Unethical!

565
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:16,146
It's completely ethical,
since your client's guilty.

566
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:18,115
Says who?
- Trust me.

567
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:21,654
Last time I trusted you
you screwed my best friend.

568
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:25,622
Fuck off! You don't want
to see my tits, you won't.

569
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,755
You're such a pain!

570
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:57,719
Ok, I accept.

571
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:00,587
I accept.

572
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:04,625
You accept?

573
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:13,968
Mr. Ethics accepts to double-cross
his handicapped client?

574
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:19,838
You pig! Think I'd ever
sell my body for that?

575
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:23,575
I'd never ever
accept that kind of deal.

576
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:27,888
You're the one who's changed.

577
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:30,951
Anyway, I know your game.

578
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:34,254
You're not interested
in seeing my breasts.

579
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,796
What you really want
is for me to reveal them.

580
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:40,493
Pardon me?
- To reveal them.

581
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:44,764
You want to see me strip,
not what's underneath.

582
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,636
Only natural,
that's the turn-on.

583
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:49,572
That's what you want.

584
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:52,281
That's what we all want.

585
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:57,108
If you could prove
it's my breasts

586
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,982
you're after,
and not that thrill

587
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:02,885
I'd show them to you gladly.

588
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,425
Reveal them.

589
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:10,565
Quite a theory.

590
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:12,459
Yes sirree.

591
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,203
Hi, how's it going?

592
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:22,434
Hi, Antoine.
Bliss is near, I feel it.

593
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:23,904
And my dream?

594
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:26,581
Is it linked
to the death of matter

595
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:29,512
at the dawn
of the second millennium?

596
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,047
I dunno.

597
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:38,854
Here, for your girlfriend.

598
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:41,990
My girlfriend says thanks.

599
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,431
Oh, by the way...

600
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,096
Would you

601
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,164
happen to have a condom?

602
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,635
Be right back.

603
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,025
Fanny?

604
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,091
What?

605
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:16,765
In art nudity is completely
respectable, is it not?

606
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,828
No, I mean, if...

607
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:23,027
if you show me a photo of your
breasts, and I admire it

608
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,400
as a work of art,
then your problem

609
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:29,442
of supposedly sacred revelation
is eliminated, right?

610
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:32,872
Jules?

611
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,113
Do you want to fuck me?

612
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:38,411
Make love?
Never crossed my mind.

613
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:41,317
I don't know,
unconsciously perhaps.

614
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:42,616
Julien!

615
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:45,060
Jules.

616
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:51,663
All I want now
is to see your breasts.

617
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:55,098
The rest is the future,
beyond our grasp.

618
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,406
Thanks for being so frank.

619
00:57:57,841 --> 00:57:59,604
If you were me, would you?

620
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:01,140
Yes, definitely.

621
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,968
Then you go first.

622
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:06,047
If you mean it.
I'll follow you.

623
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:10,276
Shit!

624
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:01,461
Fanny...

625
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,945
Jules!

626
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:21,252
Be right there.

627
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:23,354
I'm here, you can...

628
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,685
I have to go. It's urgent.

629
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:29,421
My partner sent a plane ticket,
not the trial papers.

630
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,191
He felt so guilty,
he's taking the case.

631
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:34,903
I fly from Quebec City tonight.

632
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:37,102
Fanny?
- What, Julot?

633
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:40,642
Nothing, nothing...

634
00:59:49,552 --> 00:59:50,678
You're going?

635
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:55,616
You want to see
my breasts, huh?

636
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:59,726
No, I don't. This breast thing
is dumb. Dumb.

637
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:02,824
Ok. It's up to you.

638
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:05,733
Here.

639
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:07,960
My cellular number.

640
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,073
Join me skiing,
after the trial.

641
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,509
I have a condo,
and Simon won't bother us.

642
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:15,540
Simon?

643
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,542
My partner,
and future ex-husband.

644
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:22,984
Let's stay friends.

645
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:26,918
Don't ever change, Julot.

646
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:44,905
Jules... it's for you.

647
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,477
Take my bags
to the lobby, please.

648
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:49,837
In a moment.

649
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:55,814
I've interpreted your dream.

650
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:57,174
I think...

651
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:01,882
The plane crash represents
an intellectual situation

652
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:05,458
in conflict with
your material aspirations.

653
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:08,889
But you don't die,
so near death is a condition

654
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:11,464
of reaching
a higher life plane.

655
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:17,598
Another time.
- Another time.

656
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:20,809
Thanks, huh.
- Sure.

657
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:25,205
Bye, Jules.
- Bye, Antoine.

658
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:27,614
Thanks.

659
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,917
Vacation time...

660
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:45,217
Gimme that skin cancer.

661
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:14,053
Think we'll tan?

662
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,557
Am I tanning?

663
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:32,141
I don't wanna know, Yannie.

664
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:33,667
Not now.

665
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,237
Ok, fine.

666
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:41,777
We won't go. We won't, ok?

667
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:43,719
Sure.

668
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,688
We won't go.
- We won't go.

669
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:49,184
I don't need to know.

670
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:39,464
I bit my tongue.

671
01:04:48,684 --> 01:04:50,379
What're we doing here?

672
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,349
What am I doing here?

673
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:57,159
If I am, I am right now.

674
01:04:57,493 --> 01:05:00,462
Not as of 2 o'clock.
I am right now!

675
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:07,099
Think positive, pal,
maybe you're negative.

676
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:13,402
Why pretend life is beautiful?

677
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:15,042
We're not pretending.

678
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:17,803
Wake up, for Christ sake!

679
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:20,442
What if you're not?

680
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:22,283
What if you're not?

681
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:35,055
Come on, I'm getting
on your nerves.

682
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:38,062
C'mon, might as well find out.

683
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:34,854
Yannie

684
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:38,859
I prefer to go by myself.

685
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:02,909
It's for you.

686
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:07,044
Thanks for the day.

687
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,424
When will we do this again?

688
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,029
I'll wait for you.

689
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:28,888
Go on in.

690
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:47,939
It's 8. I'm freezing.
What the fuck are you doing?

691
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,446
Where are you?

692
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:54,117
It's starting.

693
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,222
Shit!

694
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,521
Well, have a nice evening.

695
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:54,107
Still there?

696
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:58,411
We used to call it
being stood up.

697
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:03,753
You're not missing anything.
It's terrible.

698
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:05,961
Give the actors a chance.

699
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:09,528
If it's a disaster,
you know right away.

700
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:11,993
Seen the play?

701
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:14,301
I acted in it.

702
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:17,638
Actress!

703
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:21,439
No, for an audition
at the Theater School.

704
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:27,742
I wanted to see Sylvie Drapeau.

705
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:29,915
Everyone says she's great.

706
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:31,312
Everyone...

707
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:35,185
You should have seen Delphine.

708
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:47,892
The magic of seeing the <i>Shrew</i>
that first time, in Paris in 53.

709
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:52,370
Her Katharina was so beautiful,
so timid.

710
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:54,865
And I married her.

711
01:11:58,414 --> 01:11:59,938
Did you tame her?

712
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:04,745
Not really.

713
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:10,614
But you're cold.
- It's ok.

714
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:15,558
I cannot accept a woman
having cold feet. Come with me.

715
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:37,515
Did you see a girl
waiting for someone?

716
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:40,585
You sure?

717
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:47,160
A brunette was waiting
a while ago, but she left.

718
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:50,354
Has it been long?

719
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:55,432
What direction did she go in?

720
01:12:56,905 --> 01:12:58,463
Next time, be on time.

721
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,800
To avoid all these questions.

722
01:13:14,022 --> 01:13:16,286
You'll feel better in these.

723
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:22,954
My wife's stage fright
went to her feet.

724
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:26,429
Every night before a show
I massaged her.

725
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:29,262
After the show I did it again.

726
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:34,801
She'd become completely relaxed
and fall asleep like a baby.

727
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,004
How long were you together?

728
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,646
How old are you?

729
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:41,739
Nineteen. Well...

730
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:45,312
I'm turning 20.
It's my birthday.

731
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:48,113
Ah, your birthday.

732
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:50,383
So the play was..?

733
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:51,650
A present.

734
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:53,723
Perfect, huh?

735
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:00,932
Allow me...

736
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:07,976
She was your age
when I married her. Twenty.

737
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:09,871
Transparent as rain.

738
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:13,504
Happy birthday...

739
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:15,049
Dawn.

740
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:18,683
Beautiful.

741
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:20,413
And you are?

742
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:22,053
Dusk.

743
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:26,751
Dawn and Dusk,
like in the poem.

744
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:10,329
Play out the play!

745
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,754
It's a bad night.

746
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:38,460
Not just a bad night.

747
01:15:45,407 --> 01:15:47,967
I'd have liked to live
in your day.

748
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:53,375
It was harder for some,
better for others.

749
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:55,947
Like today
nothing has changed.

750
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:59,120
No, I think a lot has changed.

751
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:03,150
I knew I was born
at the wrong time.

752
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:12,092
Speed, competitiveness
aren't for me.

753
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:16,636
Yet, your game
is ferociously combative.

754
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:24,606
Yeah, my game.

755
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:29,250
But in life I'd like
a bit more...

756
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:33,114
Don't know,
but it's not coming.

757
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:35,784
Even on my birthday.

758
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:43,291
I wonder if I still love him.

759
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:50,939
You're delightful, Dawn.

760
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:52,970
My shot. Won't be long.

761
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:01,647
There!

762
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:05,810
If I'm still with him at 70

763
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:08,648
I'll think of you
on my birthday.

764
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,170
Has she been dead long?

765
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:31,536
She's not dead, she left me.

766
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,307
She was right. It was time.

767
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:36,677
I'd never have done it.

768
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:38,852
I don't know if I'll stay.

769
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:40,315
Of course.

770
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:44,149
Adolescent dawn,
who dreams of the golden sun.

771
01:17:44,526 --> 01:17:47,586
A winter sun,
rays without fire.

772
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:51,492
Adolescent dawn,
who rises slowly, so softly

773
01:17:51,733 --> 01:17:54,167
that one can see her shiver

774
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:55,961
and begin to blush.

775
01:17:56,705 --> 01:18:00,197
Never will dusk
defeat the dawn.

776
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,740
Let evening surprise us, but

777
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:06,174
bring on the morning.

778
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:09,947
Apollinaire was right.

779
01:18:10,552 --> 01:18:14,818
Never will dusk
defeat the dawn.

780
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:24,194
Marriage, you know

781
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:26,630
is an association.

782
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:28,866
Association?

783
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:31,603
That's romantic.

784
01:18:32,107 --> 01:18:34,667
With time,
that's what it becomes.

785
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:39,179
You don't believe in it?
- Some associations

786
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:41,177
are very enriching.

787
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:47,216
We all wait for the miracle.

788
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:53,725
I always thought there'd be
someone, maybe far away

789
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:56,021
I could make my life with.

790
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:58,791
Very far or very near.

791
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:02,733
Maybe it's my boyfriend.

792
01:19:03,705 --> 01:19:05,570
If I decide it's him.

793
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:12,678
You must've decided,
it lasted 50 years.

794
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:15,079
Yes.

795
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:17,845
And I never

796
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:19,747
went back on the choice.

797
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:22,912
You're handsome.

798
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:28,095
You could've had
several associations.

799
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:33,333
Don't tempt the devil.

800
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:03,824
Chance is strange.

801
01:21:04,459 --> 01:21:06,120
Life is strange.

802
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:17,866
Always work nights?

803
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:21,638
Night, day, sometimes
round the clock.

804
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:25,145
There's less traffic at night.

805
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:35,846
You must meet
some strange ones.

806
01:21:36,591 --> 01:21:38,218
All kinds of people.

807
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:42,055
One guy today vomited,
he was so nervous.

808
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:46,658
Lots of things,
you can't imagine.

809
01:21:47,636 --> 01:21:49,501
Tonight I met a wise man.

810
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,035
A wise man.

811
01:21:51,873 --> 01:21:56,037
That's not wise. Those guys
always have something in mind.

812
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:59,338
Probably.

813
01:22:00,148 --> 01:22:03,140
Was he young or old,
your wise man?

814
01:22:07,522 --> 01:22:09,683
It was as if he had no age.

815
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:13,852
I think he was 20 with me.

816
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:18,989
We met 'cause of my birthday.

817
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:20,428
Your birthday?

818
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:21,961
That's great.

819
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:24,335
Happy birthday!

820
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:27,604
What is it in your language?

821
01:22:27,842 --> 01:22:29,139
Happy birthday?

822
01:22:29,377 --> 01:22:33,245
We say several things,
but I prefer, <i>Dolgie lieta!</i>

823
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:35,842
It means, many years.

824
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:41,853
Many years.

825
01:24:15,116 --> 01:24:16,947
A sandwich and coffee.

826
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:18,544
Chicken?

827
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:21,486
Chicken's good.

828
01:24:28,997 --> 01:24:31,830
Good morning, coffee, please.
Cosmos!

829
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:33,159
Janvier!

830
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:36,129
Wake up without any problem?

831
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:38,339
Almost. You done?

832
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:40,939
So?

833
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:42,506
$83.

834
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:43,768
<i>Cheap</i>.

835
01:24:45,513 --> 01:24:47,606
Anyway...
- Anyway, what?

836
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:49,612
Anyway, winter's the pits.

837
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:53,048
For sure. Big disadvantage
of this country.

838
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:55,222
Huge disadvantage.
- Well...

839
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:57,721
winter's the price
of the advantages.

840
01:24:58,026 --> 01:24:59,254
Huge price!

841
01:25:03,064 --> 01:25:07,501
Happiness doesn't depend
on the season, or the weather.

842
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:10,363
It's all here,
a matter of altitude.

843
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:12,632
Of attitude.

844
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:16,741
Yeah, but in winter
people are less open.

845
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:19,970
Very conservative.
They don't even look up.

846
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:23,912
No one talks, no one smiles.
It's depressing.

847
01:25:24,152 --> 01:25:25,380
I'm depressed!

848
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:28,783
Don't get depressed.
Spring's coming.

849
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:33,020
Anyway, people tip less
in winter. That's serious.

850
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:03,381
Summer's what I like.

851
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:08,460
Right on. Me too.
None of this crap in summer.

852
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:11,923
People are much more open,
you know.

853
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:15,568
They tip like civilized people.

854
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:31,415
The problem with society today
is that people...

855
01:26:31,653 --> 01:26:33,518
You know how people are?

856
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:35,814
I have no idea.

857
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:39,185
Let me tell you...
People are alone.

858
01:26:39,494 --> 01:26:42,429
Lonely, very lonely.

859
01:26:43,164 --> 01:26:45,029
It's true, you're right.

860
01:26:45,266 --> 01:26:46,699
I read a book on it.

861
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:50,334
The author said it all started
with one thing.

862
01:26:50,572 --> 01:26:52,472
Can you guess what?
- What?

863
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:53,435
Guess.

864
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:57,177
The industrial revolution.
- No.

865
01:26:57,478 --> 01:26:58,945
Come on!
- Not that.

866
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:00,670
Women's liberation!

867
01:27:00,982 --> 01:27:02,040
No, before.

868
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:04,717
I don't know. TV? Plastic?

869
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:09,718
No, pal.
All our problems started

870
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:12,483
with agriculture.

871
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:19,866
What do you mean?
Are you crazy?

872
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:23,494
Agriculture is good.
It gives us food.

873
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:26,136
It gives us...
gives us everything.

874
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:27,833
Agriculture's

875
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:29,976
great. I'm not against it.

876
01:27:30,211 --> 01:27:32,577
It depends on how
you look at it.

877
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:34,975
You're talking nonsense again.

878
01:27:36,718 --> 01:27:39,118
The problem
isn't agriculture per se.

879
01:27:39,354 --> 01:27:42,187
The wheat and tomatoes
aren't to blame.

880
01:27:42,457 --> 01:27:45,654
It's the consequences
of agriculture.

881
01:28:18,559 --> 01:28:22,461
Agriculture has resulted
in an abundance of food.

882
01:28:22,697 --> 01:28:26,030
Without that,
no population growth.

883
01:28:26,267 --> 01:28:28,132
Without it, no big cities.

884
01:28:28,369 --> 01:28:30,337
Without big cities, pal...

885
01:28:30,672 --> 01:28:32,037
Where's your car?

886
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,704
Yeah, where's my car?

887
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:37,541
I don't get it. It was...

888
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:44,340
Maybe you loaned it.

889
01:28:44,585 --> 01:28:47,918
Don't you see, they stole it!

890
01:28:53,194 --> 01:28:55,754
Hey, there it is. Look.

891
01:28:57,065 --> 01:28:58,589
Isn't that your car?

892
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:04,168
Let's follow them!

893
01:29:04,405 --> 01:29:06,805
Not just follow them.
Catch them.

894
01:29:07,041 --> 01:29:10,340
We're gonna kill them.
Massacre the dogs!

895
01:29:12,914 --> 01:29:17,977
I'll strangle them
one at a time. Got a rope?

896
01:29:18,386 --> 01:29:20,513
Put on your seat belt, ok?

897
01:29:22,256 --> 01:29:23,518
What're you doing?

898
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:24,986
Can't get too close.

899
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:26,716
How'll we catch them?

900
01:29:26,961 --> 01:29:28,155
If I stay back

901
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:32,222
they won't know
we're following them.

902
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:33,795
Are you stupid?

903
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:36,697
You finished?
Don't call me stupid.

904
01:29:36,938 --> 01:29:39,634
Have I ever called you stupid?

905
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:41,432
Never, not once.

906
01:29:42,243 --> 01:29:43,540
I respect you.

907
01:29:44,979 --> 01:29:47,777
They might be dangerous,
never know.

908
01:30:04,832 --> 01:30:06,766
I think they have guns.
- What?

909
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:09,196
Can't you see it in their eyes?

910
01:30:09,437 --> 01:30:12,429
Their eyes say "guns".
Never seen that?

911
01:30:17,278 --> 01:30:18,905
Not much of a driver.

912
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:22,410
Like Dionysius fleeing
Hermes's garden.

913
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:24,208
What? Who?
- What? Who?

914
01:30:24,452 --> 01:30:26,283
You're Greek.
- Only part.

915
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:29,319
You should know
your own mythology.

916
01:30:29,557 --> 01:30:32,924
Fine, but right now
all I want is to kill them.

917
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:34,628
There you go again.

918
01:30:34,862 --> 01:30:37,422
Kill, kill.
You're out of control.

919
01:30:37,665 --> 01:30:40,930
Know what? I don't want
to follow those guys.

920
01:30:41,169 --> 01:30:43,535
I'm scared, I'll admit it.

921
01:30:44,806 --> 01:30:45,864
Got insurance?

922
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:48,268
No, I don't.
- You're lying.

923
01:30:48,509 --> 01:30:52,104
You mentioned the payments.
Let's call the police.

924
01:30:52,346 --> 01:30:55,213
No, they're right
in front of us.

925
01:30:58,419 --> 01:30:59,909
God, see that?

926
01:31:00,221 --> 01:31:01,518
See that money?

927
01:31:02,056 --> 01:31:05,492
I just wanted an easy start
to my day, and see?

928
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:08,994
It's getting more
and more strange.

929
01:32:56,971 --> 01:32:58,529
Isn't that your car?

930
01:32:59,307 --> 01:33:00,171
That?

931
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:02,869
It's my car?

932
01:33:03,444 --> 01:33:04,433
That?

933
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:49,883
You ok, pal?

934
01:33:51,559 --> 01:33:53,220
Want a closer look?

935
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:54,689
One last time?

936
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:59,156
No, not a last time.

937
01:34:00,434 --> 01:34:01,366
And them?

938
01:34:02,069 --> 01:34:03,661
Still want to kill 'em?

939
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:08,234
No, not kill.

940
01:34:09,877 --> 01:34:11,071
Not kill.

941
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:19,620
Agriculture invented cars,
you know.

942
01:34:19,854 --> 01:34:23,085
And it's the reason
they stole your car.

943
01:34:23,324 --> 01:34:27,124
I told you. Everything
started with agriculture.

944
01:34:27,695 --> 01:34:30,129
Everything bad.
- You got it, pal.

945
01:34:30,364 --> 01:34:32,628
Even what's good is bad.

946
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:34,458
Yeah, it's ironic.

947
01:34:36,437 --> 01:34:38,735
Why me? What did I do?

948
01:34:39,774 --> 01:34:43,938
You nibbled on a carrot or some
broccoli, and the devil smiled.

949
01:34:44,178 --> 01:34:45,008
Oh.

950
01:34:49,016 --> 01:34:50,005
You know

951
01:34:50,785 --> 01:34:52,150
in some ways

952
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,611
agriculture maybe isn't so bad.

953
01:34:55,856 --> 01:34:57,551
It's bad all the way.

954
01:34:58,492 --> 01:34:59,459
Yeah.

955
01:35:00,094 --> 01:35:01,254
It's ironic.

956
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:05,188
It's as if everything was

957
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:07,128
meaningless.

958
01:35:14,608 --> 01:35:17,304
I forgot to tell you
what happened.

959
01:35:17,611 --> 01:35:20,842
A woman came out
of a hotel. Seemed upset.

960
01:35:21,082 --> 01:35:24,449
She looked at me
and she bared her breasts.

961
01:35:24,685 --> 01:35:26,778
No way.
- I swear, pal.

962
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:29,287
Can you imagine?
