2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,888
If someone says, "I can't watch
a Bruce Lee film," I can't talk to 'em.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,167
Bruce Lee is a worldwide fighting icon.

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,447
He was a 130-something-pound
lethal weapon.

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,490
Bruce and his fighting style
changed the game.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,720
In the beginning I had no intention
that what I was practising,

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,361
and what I am still practising now,
would lead to this.

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,331
(man) Bruce Lee, Bob Dylan, Ali,
Jay-Z, Tiger, Kobe, Jordan,

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,970
they all have the same spirit.

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,249
No stunt coordinator coordinated
his shit. He did it himself.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,609
The guy you see in Bruce's films
is the way Bruce was in person.

12
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,887
He could lose his temper.

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,566
Bruce Lee is my idol. Wha-aa!

14
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,969
He was directing, writing, acting.

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,923
(man) I don't even look at him
as being Asian. He's my idol.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,368
When you think of Bruce Lee, you don't
think about the Asian karate guy.

17
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,965
You think about a legacy.

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,810
The moves that he could do,

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,487
you were wondering
if they were speeding up the camera.

20
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,806
(man) Bruce Lee was like the superhero
of the Asian community.

21
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,962
You had Muhammad Ali.
You had Malcolm X.

22
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,566
Bruce Lee represented
that same kind of radicalism.

23
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,007
Technically brilliant choreography.

24
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,205
You get mysticism, hyper-masculinity.
This guy is like, bang!

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,487
He's put balls on Chinese men.

26
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,571
There's some cool stuff.

27
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,725
You're like, "Wow.
That supercool guy is my dad."

28
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,963
- There'll never be another Bruce Lee.
- Baby, here I am, man.

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,120
How does a small Chinese guy become
the greatest martial artist of all time?

30
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,729
(man) Production 263-05-224-10.
Test X1, take 1.

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,406
(interviewer) Bruce,
just look right into the camera

32
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,723
and tell us your name,
your age and where you were born.

33
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,087
My last name is Lee, Bruce Lee.

34
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,006
I was born in San Francisco
in 1940. I'm 24 right now.

35
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,321
There was controversy about me
taking him back to the United States.

36
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,691
But he loved his time that he lived
in Seattle before all of this.

37
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,769
It was important for my children
to know where their father was.

38
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,770
I just intimately just started crying.

39
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,562
I think I literally cried after
the funeral all the way from Seattle,

40
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,281
all the way to the California border,
all the way up to Sacramento.

41
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,321
That was a very difficult time
to leave Hong Kong

42
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,327
and... take their favourite son away.

43
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,486
Bruce's childhood
is interesting to look at

44
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,801
from the standpoint
of where he ended up.

45
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,724
First of all, Hong Kong
in the early '40s

46
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,963
was occupied by Japan
during World War ll,

47
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,725
and this had an influence on Bruce.

48
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:02,604
It was very important to him as a child
from the get-go to be self-sufficient,

49
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,924
and in doing that, you have to shoulder
a lot of personal responsibility.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,482
There's bad blood historically
between China and Hong Kong and Japan.

51
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,044
His mother used to tell me how Bruce
would hang over the side of the balcony

52
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,126
and shake his fist at the Japanese
planes coming to land in Hong Kong.

53
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,931
If anyone said a word against
the Chinese, he would rebel.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,402
(interviewer) And you work
in motion pictures in Hong Kong?

55
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,211
Yes, since I was around six years old.

56
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,648
Bruce became a child actor
under his father's influence,

57
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,361
his father being an actor
in the Chinese opera

58
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,681
and then in Cantonese films as well.

59
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,606
(interviewer) Tell the crew what time
they shoot the pictures in Hong Kong.

60
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,765
Well, it's mostly in the morning
because it's kind of noisy in Hong Kong,

61
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,083
you know,
around three million people there,

62
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,640
so every time when you have a picture,

63
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,011
it's mostly, say, around
12am to 5am in the morning.

64
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,082
(man) A lot of people
don't touch on this,

65
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,801
but he was the biggest childhood star
in Hong Kong.

66
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,885
He made 20, 20-something movies
as a child star.

67
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,203
(David) He was like
the Macaulay Culkin of that era.

68
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,046
And then you have the fact that
Hong Kong was governed by the British.

69
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,088
(Dan) They targeted the British.

70
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,968
You are crazy.

71
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,965
But there's a lot of competition
between the British people living there

72
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,849
and the Chinese living there.

73
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,924
(Shannon) He's also part Caucasian.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,607
I think he saw
a lot of adversity racially,

75
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,287
not only around him but within himself.

76
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,126
(Linda) And he had run-ins with English
schoolboys and that kind of thing,

77
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,090
so there was always
that feeling of resentment

78
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,209
of others dictating his future.

79
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,569
Then, of course, when he was 13,
he went to study with Yip Man.

80
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,164
As human beings, fighting's in our DNA.
We get it and we like it.

81
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,164
Yip Man trained Bruce in wing chun,

82
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,891
and Yip Man
was a fabulous kung fu master.

83
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,167
(David) Bruce had many run-ins
with the law

84
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,369
and other teenagers in Hong Kong,
and he had fights.

85
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,889
He loved the street fights. He loved
other people who can street-fight.

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,163
Bruce's style
is made for street survival.

87
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,323
He grew up fighting fights
in Hong Kong on the rooftop.

88
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,927
Bruce had some of the films, 8mm,
that he used to show us,

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,367
where they get
into the old traditional stance

90
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,762
and one guy would come in
and throw a couple of punches

91
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,528
and the other guy would back up
and fall down over the plant pot.

92
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,410
There were two clans usually,
the choy li fut clan

93
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,050
and the wing chun clan

94
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,169
by Yip Man and his students,
and they would have battles.

95
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,086
Although this stuff about the choy
li fut and wing chun rooftop fights

96
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,969
is the stuff of legend, it is true.

97
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,804
I was in Hong Kong.

98
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,521
The sentiment, the animosity between
wing chun and choy li fut still exists.

99
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,649
(Linda) So Yip Man
was a great influence on Bruce

100
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,007
and leaned him in the direction
of philosophy.

101
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,562
Yip Man would not be a legend
without Bruce Lee.

102
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,964
Wing chun was
a very, very minor martial art style,

103
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,965
and now it's global,
and that's all because of Bruce Lee.

104
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,887
Ultimately, martial art means
honestly expressing yourself.

105
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,645
Now, it is very difficult to do.

106
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,610
A lot of that warrior spirit,
to me, it's really honourable.

107
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,761
It's really pure.

108
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,084
It breaks through to every culture,
every language, every colour.

109
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,687
It's all about getting respect back,
you know.

110
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,048
If you're gonna hurt me, you're gonna
have to earn it, motherfucker.

111
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,327
(Stephan) I was the youngest
of three boys.

112
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,846
I got obsessed
with Bruce Lee and martial arts.

113
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,322
I wanted to kick my brothers' asses
and prove my worthiness.

114
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,609
When a good fight breaks out,
you can't help but be excited.

115
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,489
You can't help but show emotion.

116
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,407
It took a while, but as many times
as each of my brothers beat me up,

117
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,610
each one of them got one ass-kicking
from me and that was it.

118
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,762
I didn't do so well talking shit back,

119
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,923
so I don't see the point in talking
about it. Let's just go there.

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,846
But then you feel bad and embarrassed
afterwards, "That was childish."

121
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,810
"I could have handled that better."
But you also feel good.

122
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,247
If you couldn't get laid,
you got in a fight.

123
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,368
Let me punch this ugly motherfucker.

124
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,330
In Youngstown.
It was a nice place to live.

125
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,051
(man) Fighting has taken over
my mind and my being.

126
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,690
It's not what I do. It's who I am.

127
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,084
My father told me fighters are born,
not made. Bruce Lee was a born fighter.

128
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,891
When you do punch,
now I'm leaning forward a little bit,

129
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,043
hoping not to hurt any camera angle.

130
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,011
I mean, you gotta put the whole hip
into it and snap it

131
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,971
and get all your energy in there,
and make this into a weapon.

132
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,321
When Bruce Lee was a young boy,
maybe 13 or 14, training in wing chun,

133
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,085
they found out that Bruce Lee
had Caucasian blood.

134
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,640
- I believe it's one fourth German.
- Well?

135
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,281
The other students said he shouldn't
be allowed to learn wing chun

136
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,567
because he wasn't purely Chinese.

137
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,450
When you're by yourself
and no one wants to be there

138
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,206
because they didn't wanna get beat up,
it's the loneliest feeling in the world.

139
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,045
(Bruce) One thing I have
definitely learned in my life

140
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,849
is that I do have a bad temper.

141
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,922
A violent temper, in fact.

142
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,602
(Shannon) His whole life is sort of
this play between East and West.

143
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,571
He hated the oppression
of little people

144
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,325
which he saw everywhere,
in the Japanese occupation,

145
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,880
the Boxer Rebellion,

146
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,167
the foreign powers going into China.

147
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,083
He just thought all of that was wrong.

148
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,687
(Shannon) To live the life he wanted
to live, he had to fight for it.

149
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,810
He really had to put it out there
and really walk the walk.

150
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,009
I mean, it is easy for me
to put on a show

151
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,527
and be cocky
and be flooded with a cocky feeling

152
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,410
and then feel like pretty cool
and all that.

153
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,280
Or I can make all kinds
of phoney things, you see what I mean?

154
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,684
Blinded by it. Or I can show you
some really fancy movement.

155
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,971
But to express oneself honestly,
not lying to oneself,

156
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,088
and to express myself honestly,

157
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,891
that, my friend, is...

158
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,645
In some ways
it's the total opposite of anger.

159
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,566
It's beauty, it's passion, it's art.

160
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,849
It's... It's painting a picture
without tools.

161
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,569
(man) It was a surprise,
but an understandable one,

162
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,211
when I found out that Bruce Lee
was a cha-cha champion,

163
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,284
because you could see that reflected
in his fighting style.

164
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,887
(man) He was the 1957
Hong Kong cha-cha champion.

165
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,965
People don't know that. His footwork
was impeccable. Incredible samba dancer.

166
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,487
He didn't move like anybody else.
He moved like himself.

167
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,882
In a fight you have footwork
and you have form

168
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,486
and you have stance and power
that you interject,

169
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,803
and that's the way that dancing
and martial arts go hand in hand.

170
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,489
For him to be steeped into that rhythm
reinforced why black people

171
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,361
have always identified with Bruce
and his fighting style.

172
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,046
So what I got from Bruce
as a performer is...

173
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,364
You know, most performers
perform like this, right? Straight up.

174
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,445
Me, perform from the side,

175
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,888
sort of like how Bruce
used to always, you know,

176
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,564
be ready for combat like this.

177
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,440
Honestly expressing yourself,
like me being a dancer,

178
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,329
that's what it's all about.

179
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,644
That's another big, big philosophy from
him that I take with me to this day.

180
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,724
So I'll be performing like,
"Bah, bah! Bah, bah, bah, bah!"

181
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,364
(Jose) I keep trying to dig deeper
and deeper within myself

182
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,922
and find that fluidity
that no one can replicate.

183
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,687
That's the vibe
that Bruce Lee taught me.

184
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,091
It's to always bring it.

185
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,924
That's what I get from Bruce.

186
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,245
- And when did you leave Hong Kong?
- 1959, when I was 18.

187
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,688
(Shannon) It had gotten a little
difficult with the police on one side

188
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,967
and with gangs on the other side.

189
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,646
He beat this kid up,
but he didn't know that the kid

190
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,724
was the son of a high-ranking
police officer in Hong Kong.

191
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,168
He got into so many street fights
that by 18, his father gave him $100

192
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,402
and sent him off to America.

193
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,326
(Shannon) If he wanted
his immigration status to be US citizen,

194
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,721
then he had to return
by the time he was 18.

195
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,531
(David) To go when you're still a star
is very strange,

196
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,571
because he could have kept doing films,
but they wanted him to go,

197
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,406
to make the right decision
of where he's going next.

198
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,208
(Shannon) In Seattle, my father
started teaching martial arts.

199
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,002
He didn't ever look at people because of
their race or their stature in life.

200
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,243
If you had a sincere interest
in martial arts, he would teach you.

201
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,800
Taky Kimura was really his best friend.

202
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,487
Taky became his first assistant
instructor in his first school,

203
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,723
the Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute,
in Seattle, Washington.

204
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,724
(Linda) Bruce used to come
to my high school

205
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,724
and he used to teach
in the Chinese philosophy class.

206
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,044
He was five years older than we were
and I do remember my heart going,

207
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,930
"Pah, pah, pah", you know,
"He is sure cute."

208
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,721
It wasn't long after that that I started
taking gung fu lessons from him,

209
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,761
and my relationship with him
changed more from just a student

210
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,687
to actually feeling that maybe, maybe
there could be a connection between us.

211
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,081
We both attended
the University of Washington.

212
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,766
We would get together on campus

213
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,888
and attend our classes,

214
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,169
occasionally, when we weren't doing
gung fu or something else.

215
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,607
And then when we were both done
with our classes,

216
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,444
we would rush back to his studio,

217
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,888
which was just right there
in the university district,

218
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,850
and we'd turn on the TV
and watch General Hospital every day.

219
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,050
And it was like, "We have to get there.
It's almost three o'clock!"

220
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,409
(woman) In the '60s,
marriages were happening in California.

221
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,530
In the rest of the country there were no
interracial marriages. It was difficult.

222
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,161
(Linda) My mother was not thrilled
when we decided to get married

223
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,087
and didn't want her daughter to have to
suffer any negativity from others.

224
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,004
(Diana) The ban on interracial marriage
was lifted in 1968.

225
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,526
That didn't mean
the ban lifted in people's hearts.

226
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,683
(Linda) Bruce was very strong in saying,

227
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,482
"I want to marry Linda.
I know that we are a good match."

228
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,724
And so we did get married.
It was really hard on my mother.

229
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,565
But it wasn't long
before she came to love Bruce very much.

230
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,884
It's so important to know that it was
his wife Linda that grounded him.

231
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,689
She was his rock.

232
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,688
(Linda) As a couple, we really did not
suffer any prejudice from outsiders,

233
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,845
and I think this had a great deal to do
with Bruce's overwhelming personality.

234
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,681
I absolutely recognise
that my uncle was a gorgeous man.

235
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,650
He's got swagger. We love his style.

236
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,088
He had style the way
Muhammad Ali had style in the ring.

237
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,282
He was like the Elvis of martial arts.
He looked like a movie star.

238
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,604
(Linda) He was always
such a snappy dresser and so handsome.

239
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,570
I've heard the term
that he's put balls on Chinese men.

240
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,966
He's shown that the Chinese man can be,
you know, sexy and hot and enticing.

241
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,805
I'm trying to copy his hair.

242
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,690
That's why my hair is long.

243
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,480
After Bruce Lee, my God, Chinese men,
they're a force to be reckoned with.

244
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,769
They're invincible.
So that's an amazing transformation.

245
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,323
He's one of a kind
and extremely attractive.

246
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,371
That would be for both straight women
and a lot of gay men that I know too.

247
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,805
Let's just put it this way.

248
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,204
I think the one thing that's missing
in my life right now is Bruce Lee.

249
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,124
A man like Bruce Lee.

250
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,291
(Dan) The first internationals
were in Long Beach.

251
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,204
I was instructed to take out Bruce Lee.
He was the guest.

252
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,806
So I was sort of like
the tour guide for him.

253
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,929
He demonstrated his art
before he even demonstrated

254
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,809
in front of the black-belt audience.

255
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,282
In the hotel room he says, "You can
use everything, you can side-kick,

256
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,330
you can round-kick,
and I'll just use my jab."

257
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,483
When he knocked me out,
it was more like a hook.

258
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,211
It sort of came off the side like that.
The ease in which he did it,

259
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,250
and explaining
while he was doing it to me,

260
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,810
that was mind-boggling for me.

261
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,724
It was like a bad dream,
like the dreams where you can't run.

262
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,805
When Bruce Lee came up
and did his performance of his gung fu,

263
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,042
it was something
I had never seen before.

264
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,329
He said, "The individual is more
important in any style or system."

265
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,721
I said,
"I need to train with a man like this."

266
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,007
He was just so ahead of the times.

267
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:08,962
He'd go to Ed Parker's events in Long
Beach and they treated him like a god.

268
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,489
When he did his one-thumb push-ups,
you could hear a pin drop.

269
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,211
(Dan) He showed his speed,
showed his power,

270
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,567
showed his one-inch punch.

271
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,689
People say, "Bruce Lee
is the fastest person on earth."

272
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,047
(Gene) He did these things
so realistically

273
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,727
that people didn't know if it was
show business or the real McCoy.

274
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,804
(Linda) When Bruce
did the demonstration in 1964,

275
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,204
before he had even come back to Oakland
where we lived at the time,

276
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,762
I had received a phone call
from William Dozier's office.

277
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,482
(Shannon) Jay Sebring, the famous
hair stylist, happened to see my father

278
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,042
at the Long Beach internationals,
and he cut the hair of William Dozier.

279
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,487
He said, "You have to see this guy.
He's amazing."

280
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,801
When Bruce came home, I said to him,

281
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,281
"You need to call this guy back,
William Dozier."

282
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,842
"He's a producer in Hollywood
and he wants to see you."

283
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,730
That was the first inkling that,

284
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,169
"Wow, I might be able to do something
in Hollywood."

285
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,004
(interviewer)
Look directly into the camera.

286
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,085
Very dapper. He's got the suit
and the tie, you know, white shirt.

287
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,084
He's so elegant.

288
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,322
But he feels like a coiled cobra.

289
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,880
- You've just had a baby boy?
- Yeah.

290
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,406
And you've lost a little sleep over it,
have you?

291
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,891
Three nights.

292
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,089
He was 24,
and he went in there, it's almost like,

293
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,766
"You're lucky that I'm here
auditioning for you."

294
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,889
There is the finger jab
There is the punch.

295
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,884
Just the poise he had said it all.

296
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,928
There is the back fist and elbow.

297
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,891
Even in conversation,
you could feel his explosive nature.

298
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,203
Of course, then they use legs,
straight to the groin or come up.

299
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,647
That's a special kind of star power.

300
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,200
Or, if I can back up a little bit,

301
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,681
we stop at the...
and then come back.

302
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,324
- Alright.
- This kind of works.

303
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,483
(Linda) He never had any intention
of going into show business.

304
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,164
His passion was his martial arts,

305
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,847
so he had a school in Seattle
and a second school in Oakland.

306
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,968
His plan was to open many, many schools
all over the county.

307
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,886
Obviously he started with the classical
Chinese arts, which is wing chun.

308
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,363
And then everyone knows about the fight
in 1964 in Oakland.

309
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,283
(Shannon) There's the famous story
about how he was challenged

310
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,125
by the Chinese community in Oakland,

311
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,762
and he had to defend the right
to teach his art to non-Chinese people.

312
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,765
You and this entire society are useless
in this country. You are archaic.

313
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,844
And you're a fool to think
that you can break away from us

314
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,570
merely because you choose to.

315
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,803
To prove Bruce Lee was wrong,
he was a fake and a fraud,

316
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,282
the Chinese traditionalists
sent somebody over to fight him.

317
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,842
(Teri) The Chinese sent someone
to shut down the school.

318
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,810
Shut down or thrown down,
and Bruce chose throw down.

319
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,281
The fight was to be held
at Bruce's school.

320
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,571
If Bruce lost the fight, he would have
to stop teaching non-Chinese people.

321
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,567
Anything that forces you
to review your dogmas,

322
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,166
most people don't respond
too well to it.

323
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,971
(Linda) I was there,
eight months pregnant with Brandon,

324
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,448
and these elders arrived
from San Francisco,

325
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,128
led by Wong Jack Man, who was going
to be the opponent in this challenge.

326
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,567
They came and they had this big match.

327
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,123
I didn't have a shred of a doubt
about how this would come out.

328
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,728
Wong Jack Man started to run around
the room trying to get away from Bruce,

329
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,408
and it took three minutes for Bruce
to get him down on the ground

330
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,084
and say, "Do you give UP?"

331
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,083
So Wong Jack Man
and those people all left.

332
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,369
And I remember so clearly
in my mind's eye

333
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,331
Bruce sitting on the steps
in the back of the studio

334
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,641
with his head in his hands.

335
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,688
And she said, "What's the matter?"

336
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,084
That was the fight that he realised the
classical arts were not working for him.

337
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,128
He should have
put that guy down sooner.

338
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,171
Bruce Lee doesn't beat him fast enough,
so he goes off to rethink it all,

339
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,926
and these tales all had the structure
of myth and fantasy.

340
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,650
Little parables about the master.

341
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,929
(Shannon) He said, "My training
in wing chun, my classical art,

342
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,083
didn't prepare me
for this kind of a battle."

343
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,165
That was the beginning of the evolution
of his own way of martial arts.

344
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,208
If you read the notes that he left
behind, 1965 he starts to write,

345
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,169
"My style is Western fencing,

346
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,969
Western boxing and wing chun."

347
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,203
He said he owe our knowledge
to the wing chun,

348
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,886
but we're gonna go beyond the wing chun.

349
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,485
Bruce Lee took a lot from boxing.

350
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,043
He felt boxing was more realistic
in that you were trading blows.

351
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,921
He likes the boxing footwork.
It's alive, it's moving and it changes.

352
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,288
(Linda) He was totally invested
in watching boxing films,

353
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,764
going way back to Jack Johnson,
Gene Tunney, Dempsey.

354
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,810
(Teri) What he took from Dempsey
was the kinetic chain,

355
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,724
how to generate power,
the importance of a good jab.

356
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,201
There's a lot about the alignment
of the body.

357
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,411
Bruce had a huge collection
of boxing films

358
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,211
and he thought the world
of Muhammad Ali.

359
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,762
What he would do was very unique.
I once came in, lights were all out.

360
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,526
And he's watching this 8mm film
and he's watching it backwards.

361
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,161
(Linda) Ali had a left-foot forward
stance and Bruce a right foot forward.

362
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,846
So he would run the films backward
in the film editor

363
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,446
and study them meticulously.

364
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,727
He would stretch and read

365
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,930
and review on 8mm film of a boxer
at the same time.

366
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,322
According to John Saxon,
his co-star on Enter the Dragon,

367
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,449
John asked him, "Why do you have
all these boxing films on Ali?"

368
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,444
And Bruce said,
"Because one day I'm gonna fight him."

369
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,606
If I was to fight Bruce Lee,
Bruce Lee was so quick, so smooth,

370
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,048
but the one thing that negates speed
on a fighter is pressure,

371
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,441
and I was a pressure fighter.

372
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,285
(Mickey) With Bruce Lee,
you gotta go inside, smother him

373
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,569
and outmuscle him. But you can't fight
a dude like that outside.

374
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,167
I see Bruce leading off
with some long-ass kicks

375
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,006
and Boom Boom gets pissed off
and tries to give him some body punches.

376
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,606
And when you get close,
then Bruce, I'm sure,

377
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,524
would be trying to bring knees
and high head kicks,

378
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,444
and I'd throw an upper cut,
bring the elbow across.

379
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,208
And he's gonna be trying to counter me,
so I have to bob and weave inside.

380
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,001
Bruce gets it to the ground
and arm-bars him or guillotines him.

381
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,444
It would have been a good time.

382
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,524
People are watching this going,
"He took more shots than we thought."

383
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,329
"He absolutely has lost his mind

384
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,801
thinking he can do that
against Bruce Lee."

385
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,880
Ray was good to the body. Then
he'd eventually get that hook on you.

386
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,169
Bruce wouldn't know how to stop it.
Why? Because he never did it.

387
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,050
(Bruce Lee)

388
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,930
People bring up the question:
Was Bruce Lee a real fighter?

389
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,602
Bruce was a brilliant fighter. I saw him
beat up a guy on Enter the Dragon.

390
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,968
It was a gang banger, a tong member,
who started giving him a bad time.

391
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,089
Pound for pound, I think
he's probably one of the best fighters.

392
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,084
He had tons of street fights
and with that speed and footwork,

393
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,889
he'd be a hell of a 135-pounder.

394
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,327
He was a 130-something-pound
lethal weapon.

395
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,689
(man) He has all the attributes
that make a good fighter:

396
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,969
The agility, the balance,
the coordination, the dexterity.

397
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,088
(Gene) People say was he
the toughest man that ever lived?

398
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,527
He was 130, 135 pounds.

399
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,047
You'd grab him
and, you know, out the window.

400
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,600
And that isn't to put him down.

401
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,604
He was an entertainer, and the best.

402
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,286
If he wanted to become
an MMA fighter today,

403
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,649
he would easily have been
that fighter that everyone fears.

404
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,121
His technique was beautiful,
perfect technique.

405
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,362
I don't care how good you are,
135lb wrestler,

406
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,523
you fight Brock Lesnar,
you're gonna lose.

407
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,650
The bigger guy equally trained
is always gonna beat the littler guy.

408
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,688
But the fact is, it wasn't about mass.

409
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,411
He would just put it down
no matter how big you were.

410
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,007
But, then again,
everybody's chin is different, you know?

411
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,006
Whether Bruce Lee was a great fighter
or wasn't a great fighter

412
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,971
doesn't make any difference to
his cultural and historical importance,

413
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,725
because his films changed the world.

414
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,201
You got the job on The Green Hornet,
where you played Kato, the chauffeur,

415
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,806
mainly because
you're the only Chinese-looking guy

416
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,521
who could pronounce the name
of the leading character, Britt Reid.

417
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,080
I made that as a joke, of course.

418
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,884
And it's a heck of a name, man.

419
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,442
Every time I said it at that time,
I was superconscious.

420
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,444
Mr Reid's residence.

421
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,091
As a kid,
we watched Green Hornet for him.

422
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,247
We could care less about Green Hornet.

423
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,800
He had a fly car,
I'll give him props for the car,

424
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,723
but Kato was incredible.

425
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,724
Everybody in the neighbourhood
was fighting to be Bruce Lee,

426
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,847
not the Green Hornet.

427
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,685
A lot of stunt guys
didn't know how to react.

428
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,810
You do the old John Wayne,
you throw a punch and the guy goes down.

429
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,089
With him, it's boom, boom, boom, boom,
lightning fast.

430
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,084
There's a shot of Bruce
and he's doing a kick,

431
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,801
and his thigh, his inner thigh,
is flat against his chest.

432
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,362
And we would just look at that kick
like, "Are you kidding me?"

433
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,841
"Look how incredible this guy can kick."

434
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,564
(Shannon) I think about what my dad said
about his first foray into Hollywood.

435
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,803
There were all these seasoned actors
doing their thing,

436
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,531
and he felt like
the only robot in the room.

437
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,082
That's something I can really relate to
in my life, back when I was acting,

438
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,404
and I was trying so hard
to impress the right people.

439
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,245
(Bruce) When I did The Green Hornet,
I was not being myself

440
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,881
and I'm trying to accumulate
external security,

441
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,689
external technique,

442
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,731
but never to ask
what Bruce Lee would have done.

443
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,282
The beauty was that he immediately said,
"I'm not gonna do that any more."

444
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,125
Sort of an awakening moment for him.

445
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,124
By the way, I did a really terrible job
in that, I have to say.

446
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,010
Really? You didn't like yourself?
I didn't see it.

447
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,164
He was always trying to be
a holistic person,

448
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,926
the fight, the philosophy,
the better human being.

449
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,006
Martial art has a very, very deep
meaning as far as my life is concerned.

450
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,525
And he was a very literate guy.

451
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,170
He really did read

452
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,481
and really did study
and really did think.

453
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,565
All type of knowledge
ultimately means self-knowledge.

454
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,726
He had a huge library of books in
his den from the ceiling to the floor.

455
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,929
Any book I'd pick up, there were
notations about what was good,

456
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,002
what was functional, what was no good.

457
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,927
As an actor, as a martial artist,
as a human being,

458
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,721
all these I have learned
from martial art.

459
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,850
(Teri) Most of the writings in the Tao
of Jeet Kune Do are Western influenced

460
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,447
and they come directly
from fencing and boxing books.

461
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,921
And you can take
most of the passages in that book

462
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,526
and trace them to their roots, verbatim.

463
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,889
He might have changed "fighter" from
"fencer", but pretty much it's intact.

464
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,725
People will say,
"Hey, that's not Bruce's philosophy."

465
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,643
"That was this author or that author."

466
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,485
That doesn't matter.
These people are missing the point.

467
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,689
Bruce Lee's writings are very fun
to read, but they were notes.

468
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,206
You get these quotes
where he may change one word

469
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,931
and substitute jeet kune do for tao.

470
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,642
So therefore it's not pure naturalness
or unnaturalness.

471
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,647
The ideal is unnatural naturalness
or natural unnaturalness.

472
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,041
- Yin yang.
- You're right, man, that's it.

473
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,647
Because of Bruce Lee,
now I read up on Alan Watts.

474
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,088
JD Krishnamurti, of course Lao Tsu,

475
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,924
Tao Te Ching.

476
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,367
Bruce Lee dissected those philosophies,

477
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,966
making them straight and direct
and to the point.

478
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,883
That's what real philosophy's about,

479
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,566
something that you can apply
to day-to-day living.

480
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,971
That's what Bruce Lee did.

481
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,769
This is where he was a genius.

482
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,729
It might sound too philosophical,

483
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,283
but it's unacting acting
or acting unacting if you...

484
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,045
- You've lost me.
- I have, huh?

485
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,251
So Bruce Lee as a philosopher
introduces nothing new

486
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,006
but introduces a radicalism
into martial art.

487
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,050
He's speaking the ideology
of the counterculture.

488
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,804
He speaks the zeitgeist.

489
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,204
So you get an interest in Buddhism,
in yoga, in all things Eastern.

490
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,806
Bruce Lee shows you
meditation in movement.

491
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,044
You set up a school in Hollywood

492
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,408
for people like James Garner,
Steve McQueen and the others.

493
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,883
Why would they want to learn Chinese
martial art? Because of a movie role?

494
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,291
Not really.

495
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,842
Most of them, you see, they are coming
in to ask me to teach them

496
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,207
not so much how to defend themselves,

497
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,647
they want to learn to express themselves

498
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,644
through some movement, be it anger,

499
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,927
be it determination or whatsoever.

500
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,085
He is paying me to show him
in combative form

501
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,606
the art of expressing the human body.

502
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,970
(Linda) Our back yard was always
a back yard school,

503
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,202
so for Jim Coburn to come over

504
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,805
or Steve McQueen to come over

505
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,609
was like not that big a deal.

506
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,763
Of all your students, famous,
James Garner, Steve McQueen,

507
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,286
James Coburn, Roman Polanski,
which was the best?

508
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:42,003
Depending, OK? Now, as a fighter,
Steve McQueen, that son of a gun,

509
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,128
got the toughness in him.

510
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,487
Now, James Coburn is a peace-loving man.

511
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,961
- (interviewer) I've met him.
- You've met him.

512
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,769
He's really, really nice.

513
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,287
Super mellow and all that,
you know what I mean?

514
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,170
Now, he appreciates
the philosophical part of it,

515
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,130
therefore his understanding of it
is deeper than Steve's.

516
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,646
He often told me,
"I would like to see Steve McQueen

517
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,370
be a little bit more like Coburn

518
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,091
and Coburn to be
a little bit more like Steve McQueen."

519
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,891
Actually, you see,
it's a combination of both.

520
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,443
I mean, here is the natural instinct
and here is control.

521
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,922
You are to combine the two in harmony.

522
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,685
Not if you have one to the extreme,

523
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,922
you will be very unscientific.

524
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,082
If you have another to the extreme,

525
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,448
you become all of a sudden
a mechanical man.

526
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,210
All the big, big names
in tournament fighting came to Bruce

527
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,487
because they wanted
to refine their skills.

528
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,881
Joe Lewis, Bob Wall, Chuck Norris.

529
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,407
(Robert) Chuck Norris was probably
the greatest kicker I've ever seen.

530
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,007
- Chuck Norris is unbelievable.
- Bruce didn't want to teach beginners.

531
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,969
He did have some in his own schools.

532
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,487
But he took the top martial artists
and he felt he could make them better.

533
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,404
"One more time. You don't get it,
we move to something else."

534
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,642
"You gonna get it?"
That's how he would teach.

535
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,927
He knew a lot. He taught me gung fu.

536
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,810
(Dan) Joe Lewis
was highly influenced by Bruce Lee.

537
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,167
Joe Lewis was a world champion
when he met Bruce,

538
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,323
but it was a lot more of Bruce
being the instructor to Joe.

539
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,961
(Dan) I don't think he had boxing hands
until he met Bruce Lee,

540
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,804
but his side kick was phenomenal.

541
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,848
Joe would throw 1,000 side kicks a day.

542
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,970
Listen, Joe Lewis, in today's world,
he would have learned all that shit

543
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,647
and been just as bad as he was
back in the day.

544
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,088
Bruce didn't think point karate,
point martial arts competition,

545
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,811
was valuable at all,
and I totally disagreed with him.

546
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,087
Bruce watched it
but didn't believe in it.

547
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,561
He always advocated
full-contact sparring.

548
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,849
Bruce Lee looked at all of that
and said, "This is not martial arts."

549
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,287
"This is nonsense.
Let's get rid of these rules."

550
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,204
I respect that he didn't feel like
he wanted to compete

551
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,805
because it wasn't real combat.

552
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,487
He says you're not fighting
for yourself or expressing yourself.

553
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,404
You're fighting for the judges,
the referee, the rules.

554
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,371
What's the reality of combat? There's
someone who wants to beat you down.

555
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,808
He said to learn to swim,
you cannot swim on land.

556
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,166
You gotta get in the water.

557
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,129
To learn to fight, you gotta fight.

558
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,209
Can you break five or six pieces of wood
with your hand or your foot?

559
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,045
Boards don't hit back.

560
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,248
I'll probably break my hand and foot.

561
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,130
He had high regard
for those martial artists of the day

562
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,770
that were winning tournaments.

563
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:22,244
He just had a different philosophy
about martial arts and actual fighting.

564
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,211
I do not believe in styles any more.

565
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,046
I mean, I do not believe
that there is such thing

566
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,771
as like a Chinese way of fighting

567
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,731
or the Japanese way of fighting
or whatever way of fighting.

568
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,928
Because if you don't have styles,

569
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,800
if you just say, "Well, here I am,
you know, as a human being,

570
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,169
how can I express myself
totally and completely?"

571
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:55,122
Now, that way, you won't create a style,
because style is a crystallisation.

572
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,410
I mean, that way it's a process
of continuing growth.

573
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,881
He called his institute
Jun Fan Gung Fu.

574
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,090
We were riding in a car and he mentioned
what he enjoyed in fencing

575
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,571
was the stop hit.

576
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,362
Bruce didn't have any passive blocks.
His blocks were a strike.

577
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,968
Bruce took the stances from the stances
that you see in Western fencing.

578
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,921
Instead of just block and then hit,
it's done simultaneously.

579
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,769
He says we wanna intercept
his physical motion and his thought.

580
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,367
It's almost like fencing. You see
this capture? That's the capture.

581
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:36,041
And that's why he said, "I'm gonna call
my new method the intercepting way

582
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,043
or the intercepting fist."

583
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,521
Come on, touch me. Any way you can.

584
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,049
To reach me, you must move to me.

585
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,124
Your attack offers me an opportunity
to intercept you.

586
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,123
And they said, "What do you call that?"

587
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,771
He says, "We call thatjeet kune do."

588
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,842
In Cantonese, jeet kune do.

589
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,720
Then it was Dan who says,
"Acronym would be JKD."

590
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,529
And Bruce Lee said, "I like that."

591
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,002
- The way of the intercepting fist.
- Intercepting fist?

592
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,607
It sounds Chinese, but it's very much
an American martial art.

593
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,045
Jeet kune do

594
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,124
was how can I most efficiently

595
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,409
directly end a moment of combat?

596
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,721
(Ed) The philosophy
Bruce Lee had was:

597
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,849
The simpler the better,
the most effective, the direct line.

598
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,321
- The other stuff was Hollywood.
- It can be taught.

599
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,244
- Do you understand?
- But it cannot really be standardised.

600
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,726
And that's not to say
that it can't be passed on.

601
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,882
But it was very personal to him.

602
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,804
All the wannabes, all the imposters

603
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,565
who put up jeet kune do signs
on their school building,

604
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,371
and they have no idea
whatjeet kune do is.

605
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,726
They think it's a style.

606
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,566
I don't know if he'd be dojo-busting
in his days, but that would upset Bruce.

607
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,642
(Bruce Lee)

608
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,644
Bruce Lee has the big middle finger
raised toward any form of authority.

609
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,121
All kinds of dogmas,
all kinds of traditions.

610
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,328
He's saying a big "screw you"
to all of them.

611
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,166
This guy was preaching back in the '60s
you shouldn't stay to one style.

612
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,766
No one style is the best.
Have a piece of everything.

613
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,322
In 1968 he says,
"JKD in '69 will be different."

614
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,051
I said, "This is really good stuff
we're doing now."

615
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,489
He says, "JKD in '69 will be different.
JKD in 1970 will be different."

616
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,882
Martial arts has evolved more
in the last ten years

617
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,361
than it has in the last 10,000 years,

618
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,284
because all the stuff
that Bruce Lee talked about

619
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,682
and his philosophies and things
that he believed were finally proven

620
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,481
and now this new martial art
was able to start to grow and evolve.

621
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,408
(announcer) Our main event,
for the light heavyweight title,

622
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,766
here we go!

623
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:51,243
You talk about Chinese boxing. How does
it differ from, say, our kind of boxing?

624
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,607
Well, first we use the feet.

625
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,930
(commentator) Second to none.

626
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,604
And then we use the elbow.

627
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,761
(commentator) Oh! Beautiful elbow!

628
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,571
- Do you use the thumb too?
- You name it, man, we use it.

629
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,404
- You use it all.
- You have to.

630
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,007
Because that is the expression
of the human body.

631
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,323
I mean, the... everything,
I mean, not just the hand.

632
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,604
The crazy thing about martial arts is
people debate and fight over this stuff.

633
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,806
There's no debate.

634
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,202
Bruce Lee is definitely the father
of mixed martial arts.

635
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,203
I do think there's a correlation there,

636
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,886
but it's not that jeet kune do
is the same thing as MMA.

637
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,043
If Dana White says Bruce Lee
is the father of mixed martial arts,

638
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,248
I would say
he's one of the earliest ones,

639
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,846
but Gene LeBell
is the father of mixed martial arts.

640
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,447
In 1963 you'll see Gene defeating
Milo Savage, a professional boxer.

641
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,126
Well, Bruce wasn't into
mixed martial arts in 1963.

642
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,807
(Gene) As I was choking him,
he grabbed my hand and started to bite,

643
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,805
and I said, "Milo, you bite my hand,
I'm gonna take your eye out."

644
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,724
He opened his mouth,
I pulled my hand out and I choked him.

645
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,009
And he was out, like, for 22 minutes.

646
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,526
Gene LeBell taught Bruce Lee
grappling moves.

647
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,286
I'd throw him and flip him
and he'd land on his feet.

648
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,330
Then he'd spin,
do a crescent kick on me

649
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,562
or do a judo throw.

650
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,450
And he was a magnificent athlete.

651
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,922
If you're gonna say father
of mixed martial... it's gotta be Bruce.

652
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,411
He's before anyone else.

653
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,131
He's the first one who decided
to put it all together.

654
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,884
He had the little shorts on, too.

655
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,329
That's as close as he could get to what
the UFC and the MMA was 25 years later.

656
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,529
(Richard) In 1947,
kajukenbo was the first

657
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,570
to put all these different martial arts
in one title:

658
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,849
Karate, judo, kenpo, boxing.

659
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,810
Like Bruce Lee, they put
all these practical things together

660
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,928
but kajukenbo had it first.

661
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,445
I agree with Dana White.

662
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,727
He is one of the pioneers
of mixed martial art.

663
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,043
The reality is, everybody has been
a part of this evolution,

664
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,203
from Benny "the Jet" Urquidez
to Joe Lewis to all these guys,

665
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,443
to Joe Lewis the boxer, too,
and the list goes on and on and on.

666
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,844
When the UFC came in,
they weren't talking about Bruce Lee.

667
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,402
- They were talking about Royce Gracie.
- (Commentator) Royce Gracie!

668
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,808
The Gracies were a piece of that too, a
piece of the history of not only the UFC

669
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,087
but of the martial arts evolving.

670
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,482
For a while
they owned those competitions.

671
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,730
(commentator) There's the tag.

672
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,407
What the Gracies did was they took
the ground game, the submission game,

673
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,290
and really refined it
to a whole other level.

674
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,522
Bruce would have loved
Brazilian jiujitsu.

675
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,080
I think if he saw the Gracies,
he would have studied.

676
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,006
He really embraced wrestling
and he really embraced judo.

677
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,447
The difference
between the Gracies and Bruce Lee

678
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,205
is Bruce Lee was never
stuck and married to one thing.

679
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,204
I think once everybody
started to learn jiujitsu

680
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,126
and then people started to do
more stand-up in there...

681
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,447
(commentator) My goodness!

682
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,205
Then I think they started talking
about Bruce Lee.

683
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,489
(commentator) Oh, man.
That is the Karate Kid.

684
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,767
And when you're talking about combat...

685
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,481
Well, I mean, if it is a sport,
now you're talking about something else.

686
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,369
You have regulations. You have rules.

687
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,011
But when you're talking about fighting
as it is...

688
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,491
- No rules?
- With no rules.

689
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,561
Real fighting.

690
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,803
Well, then, baby, you'd better train
every part of your body.

691
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,843
Mixed martial art in the cage
is for a contest. It's a sport.

692
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,606
I don't know that I would call him
exactly the father of mixed martial arts

693
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,843
because, again, it is still sport,
there are still rules.

694
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,130
Bruce Lee was strictly for the street,
taking guys out, not for competition.

695
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,000
When they had these Vale Tudo fights
in Brazil, there were barely any rules.

696
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,562
You could head-butt, you could kick
in the groin, all kinds of things.

697
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,803
Bruce's favourite weapon
in the street fight was the fingerjab.

698
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,089
This hand would block the vision,
so when he came up, like that.

699
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,448
If you do that, it could be very serious
damage to his vision for life.

700
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,763
Mixed martial art
is the purest form of combat

701
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,162
that you can possibly have
in civilisation.

702
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,971
(commentator) Oh! With a kick.

703
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,045
I just always felt like it was
such a real raw sport

704
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,646
and that it was gonna
overtake boxing one day.

705
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,165
It seems like that day's here.

706
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,287
Let's fight!

707
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:11,526
It's the most hardcore real form of
competition and honesty I could find,

708
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,329
and that's the kind of thing I crave.

709
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,449
(commentator)
Carano, a big-time puncher.

710
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,046
There is fear.
Sometimes you don't wanna go in there.

711
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,963
It just teaches you to face the music,

712
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,407
that fear's something
that needs to be devoured.

713
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,529
My biggest fear
is not that I'm gonna get hurt.

714
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,206
(commentator) Carano getting pounded!

715
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,489
My biggest fear is that I'm not going
to be able to make it authentic

716
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,289
and honestly express myself.

717
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,570
You're not trying to express yourself in
real fighting. You're trying to survive.

718
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,202
(Bruce) And you ask yourself
how can you honestly express yourself

719
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,486
at that moment?

720
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,609
If I want to punch, I'm gonna do it,
man, and I'm gonna do it.

721
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,366
Not you want to punch because
you're trying to avoid getting hit

722
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,444
but to really be in with it
and express yourself.

723
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,888
So that is the type of thing
you have to train yourself into it,

724
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,123
to become one with the...

725
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,565
This might sound different.

726
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,610
I feel as if I'm helping people
as I'm punching them in the face.

727
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,524
- (commentator) Shogun's badly hurt.
- Jon Jones!

728
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,649
I'm beating weakness out of them,
making them a better person.

729
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,166
In my opinion
it's the highest art of expression

730
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,686
and that's what
honestly expressing yourself is.

731
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,250
(commentator) To the body.

732
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,402
And it is all over!

733
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,006
(Ed) Jon Jones, look, guys like this,

734
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,562
it's important for them
to have this kind of confidence.

735
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,008
I don't look at it
as if I'm hurting my opponent, my enemy.

736
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,050
It's like we're brothers
painting this picture together.

737
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:37,125
It helps them,
until, of course, it doesn't,

738
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,682
which, as we know historically,
always happens,

739
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,287
where they run into that guy
where, "Oh, this isn't fun."

740
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,569
"This is reality.
You can get hurt in there."

741
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,008
What happens
is after several years of that,

742
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,811
it takes its effect, you know?

743
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,882
Like when I had to go take
my neurological

744
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,200
and my hands were going,

745
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,171
and I couldn't remember
where I parked my car in the morning.

746
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,245
It should be regulated. There should be
judges and medical staff there.

747
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,607
You don't wanna see people get injured.

748
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,446
I think my father,
from a pure martial arts interest

749
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,081
and combat interest standpoint,
would have loved to watch the UFC.

750
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,322
I believe that Bruce Lee
was a huge fight fan.

751
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,722
He'd have been jumping out of his seat,
getting as excited as any of us.

752
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,361
I think he'd have been proud to be
called the father of mixed martial arts.

753
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,444
OK, there's people out there,
they got it.

754
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,564
They say that Bruce Lee
was the father of mixed martial arts.

755
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,483
That bothers me.

756
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,528
If he's the father
of mixed martial arts,

757
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,285
I'm the grandfather
of mixed martial arts,

758
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,331
And if you don't believe me,
I'll choke you,

759
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,404
cos you got a nice neck for choking.

760
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,801
When you get into
this whole martial arts thing

761
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,168
and you start talking about Bruce Lee,
a lot of people get offended.

762
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,244
People get pissed off and bombed out
and everything else.

763
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:03,723
But Bruce Lee is 100 percent
the father of mixed martial arts.

764
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:15,530
He was so directed and so concrete
about his thoughts and his beliefs

765
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,604
that he actually went out
and had his friend George

766
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,286
make a little miniature tombstone.

767
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,842
It's really heavy and it says,
"In memory of a once fluid man

768
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,161
crammed and distorted
by the classical mess."

769
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:32,770
The classical mess meant that all these
traditions were a classical mess.

770
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,049
"Right punch comes.
I'll move out to a 30-degree angle."

771
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,885
"Then I'll bend my..."
It's too complicated.

772
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,530
It's not gonna work in real life.

773
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,171
(Shannon) So here was
this tombstone he created

774
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,881
to essentially remind himself
to go back to fluidity.

775
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,325
(Linda) Bruce had a vast library
of motivational books

776
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,971
and wrote motivational thoughts
every day

777
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,646
and had a little diary
that he kept every day.

778
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,167
Always they would say you've got to
have the plan and work the plan

779
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,766
and write down your goals,
which he did.

780
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,606
You know, his famous paper he wrote,
My Definite Chief Aim.

781
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,763
1969 was a very difficult time for him.

782
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,286
A lot of things
were going through his life.

783
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,204
As I recall, money was short.

784
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,444
Bruce was very traditionalist and very
ashamed that I had to go to work.

785
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,524
This was not in his way of thinking.

786
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,650
He contemplated maybe going back
to Hong Kong at that time period.

787
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:04,169
And then in the summer of '69
these horrific murders happened.

788
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,250
We have a weird homicide.

789
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:13,406
When the Manson murders happened,
it was horrible, it was horrifying.

790
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,086
(reporter) The scene described
by one investigator

791
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,640
as reminiscent
of a weird religious rite.

792
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,406
Bruce was a very good friend
of Jay Sebring and of Sharon Tate.

793
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,007
(reporter) Five persons, including
actress Sharon Tate, were found dead

794
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,721
at the home of Miss Tate and her
husband, screen director Roman Polanski.

795
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,122
My father worked with Sharon Tate
the summer before the murders

796
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,770
on the film The Wrecking Crew.

797
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,684
(reporter) Miss Tate
was eight months pregnant.

798
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,242
Among the other victims were
Hollywood hair stylist Jay Sebring...

799
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,529
Jay Sebring introduced my father
to William Dozier,

800
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,491
who was the producer of Batman
and also produced The Green Hornet.

801
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,122
The murders were then followed up
the very next night by more murders.

802
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,445
It was just a nightmare
and very scary for Bruce, too,

803
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:03,401
because Bruce's whole mentality
was protection, to take care of us.

804
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,926
(reporter)
One officer summed up the murders:

805
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,528
"In all my years I have never seen
anything like this before."

806
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,882
(Shannon) Those were tough times,
going out of the '60s and into the '70s.

807
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,045
And every day, I practise martial arts.

808
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,964
We were really struggling financially
to make it,

809
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,250
and we had bought our first house which
we ended up not being able to afford.

810
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,891
And right in the middle of that
he hurt his back.

811
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,601
He was doing a good morning stretch
exercise which can be very dangerous.

812
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,728
Chiropractors like that exercise.

813
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,290
- You see?
- Watch out.

814
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,443
For whatever reason, he did not warm up
and just... that was it.

815
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,284
He was in excruciating pain.

816
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,967
I said, "Where's Bruce?" They never
wanted to say he hurt his back,

817
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,611
because I knew he was working
on the screen scripts.

818
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,082
They told him that he was never
going to walk properly,

819
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,845
and forget doing any gung fu.

820
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,561
On the back of his business card
he wrote the words "Walk on".

821
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:06,806
He used to put the card on his bathroom
mirror and his doors and walls,

822
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,770
so everywhere he went in his room,
he'd see "Walk on".

823
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,207
So he'd get down
and start doing his stretching.

824
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:16,205
Bruce brought himself back
through rigorous rehabilitation.

825
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,566
I had a similar expression

826
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,440
when I would drive down to Torrance
to do my jiujitsu class every week.

827
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,650
His expression was "Walk on"
and mine was "Walk in the front door".

828
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,166
I had every excuse on the way down
to go back.

829
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,210
My stomach hurts. My arm hurts.
My knee's aching.

830
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,205
And I used to say, "Walk in
the front door. Walk in the front door."

831
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,604
The end result of walking in that front
door 16 years was I got my black belt,

832
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,843
which I consider
the greatest achievement of my life,

833
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,127
apart from my children.

834
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,124
The back problem
was a constant problem in his filming

835
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,009
from day one after the injury.

836
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,128
Something he had to be careful about

837
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:56,489
and nurse each day
when he finished working.

838
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,610
And you push it out, but all the time
you are keeping the continuity going.

839
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,650
Bending, stretching.

840
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,848
He worked extremely hard.

841
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,005
Most of us, I think, don't know
what it is to work that hard.

842
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,962
(Shannon) My father went to India

843
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,123
with James Coburn
and the writer Stirling Silliphant.

844
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,249
They were scouting locations for a film,
The Silent Flute,

845
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,448
that my father had written
the treatment for

846
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,649
that he was really hoping
would come together,

847
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,088
because he was struggling at that point
in time to get a project going.

848
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,324
The Silent Flute could have
blasted Bruce into Hollywood big time.

849
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,563
This was going to be
the big breakthrough project.

850
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,042
This was going to put money in the bank
to pay the mortgage and all that.

851
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,169
But they couldn't find
the locations that they wanted.

852
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,562
(Linda) Stirling and Jim
came back to Warner Bros

853
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:51,486
and said, "This is just not
what we're looking for in location."

854
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,483
And then it all came crashing down.

855
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,047
That was such a disappointment to Bruce

856
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:02,841
because we were
banking on it, literally.

857
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,809
(Bruce Lee)

858
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,645
(Linda) Bruce took a trip
back to Hong Kong to help his mom

859
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,848
with immigration into the United States.

860
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,764
He took Brandon took with him.
Brandon was five years old.

861
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,049
(Richard) He wasn't working,
had no money. He dropped everything.

862
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,327
Closed his schools.
"I'm going to Hong Kong."

863
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,041
The Green Hornet was at that time
showing on TV in Hong Kong,

864
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,327
only the people were calling it
The Kato Show.

865
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,688
They didn't care about Van Williams.
He was the biggest thing there.

866
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,685
He was greeted there
as a returning star.

867
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,242
That was the first time he thought,
"Wow. People recognise me here."

868
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,731
"They remember me."

869
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,371
He did a couple of interviews
on television shows.

870
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,330
Oh, yeah, that kid.
Now he's a big star in Hollywood.

871
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,089
So that was the first inkling

872
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,767
that maybe there would be
a future there in Hong Kong.

873
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,286
But he wasn't quite ready
to follow up on that.

874
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:13,851
Bruce Lee had a bit part,
or a supporting role,

875
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,922
in the Longstreet series.

876
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,163
And this had an enormous effect
on the audience. What was it?

877
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:23,040
I think the successful ingredient in it

878
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,567
was because I was being Bruce Lee.

879
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,563
- Yourself?
- Myself, right.

880
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,928
And did that part,
just expressed myself, like I say,

881
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,082
honestly expressed myself at that time.

882
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,562
He was very proud of Longstreet,
and it was very much from him

883
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,483
and his art and his thoughts.

884
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,928
Can you remember the lines
by Stirling Silliphant to...

885
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,809
- He's one of my students.
- Was he, too?

886
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,248
- Yes.
- You've had everybody as your student.

887
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,641
But some lines there
expressed your philosophy.

888
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,007
- I don't know if you remember them.
- I remember.

889
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,765
I said... This is what it is, OK?

890
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,525
If you try to remember, you will lose.

891
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,331
I said empty your mind.

892
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,926
Be formless, shapeless.

893
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,650
Like water.

894
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,330
Now, you put water into a cup,

895
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,528
it becomes the cup.

896
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,841
Put water into a bottle,
it becomes the bottle.

897
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,651
You put it in a teapot,
it becomes the teapot.

898
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:20,806
Now, water can flow or creep
or drip or crash.

899
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,087
Be water, my friend.

900
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,401
- Like that. You see?
- I see. I get the idea.

901
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,051
- A-ha.
- I get the power behind it.

902
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,726
The thing that I
got off him the most is the trust,

903
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,885
being able to trust your abilities
in each situation.

904
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,964
A lot of times
the game becomes too scripted.

905
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,485
When it's too scripted

906
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,325
and you start planning
for certain things to take place,

907
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,370
that's when I believe you're weak.

908
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,602
What he's saying
is that you have to adapt

909
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,728
to your surroundings, your environment.

910
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,724
James Coburn said,
"Look, man, the best thing you can do,

911
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,725
go back to Hong Kong, do what you do
best, come back, rock the world."

912
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:02,011
James Coburn did tell Bruce
that he shouldn't keep doing TV,

913
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:05,050
that it would eat up his genius.

914
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:09,489
He had much more to offer the world and
he should hold out for starring roles.

915
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:13,406
Jimi Hendrix had to break away
and go to England to be recognised

916
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,369
as the rock star that he was.

917
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,761
Clint Eastwood,
he had a career out of Rawhide,

918
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,764
but it was the Italian Westerns
that really made his career.

919
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,571
Bruce ultimately had to go back
to Hong Kong

920
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,847
to be recognised
as the movie star he was.

921
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,130
Here's a plane ticket. Just go back
to Hong Kong for a few years.

922
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,124
You wouldn't want any trouble, huh?

923
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,487
That's one of the things
I admire most about him.

924
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,211
He said, "OK, the institution's
not gonna work for me."

925
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,964
"I'll figure something else out."

926
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,407
He just went to through back door.

927
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,562
Bruce made the first two pictures with
independent producer Raymond Chow

928
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,608
for $15,000 each.

929
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:03,242
That was... It was made in Thailand
in a small village in Thailand.

930
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,290
Bruce Lee plays a working-class hero.

931
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,328
He's from the land.
He's one of the folk.

932
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,688
But at the same time as that,
he's never one of the guys.

933
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,765
And this is why it was so successful,
as well as the brilliant choreography.

934
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,771
Bruce Lee completely changed the way
action scenes look today in cinema.

935
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,047
It's about making violence
look beautiful,

936
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,441
which may sound like a paradox,
it probably is,

937
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:30,241
but a director like John Woo,
he shoots a gunfight like martial arts.

938
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:35,850
It's a ballet. In terms of the craft
of filmmaking, that's a huge change.

939
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,926
But the Western movies really piss me
off. They chop 'em up so much.

940
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,004
Most of the scenes overzoom,
so you can't see what's going on.

941
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,606
Those guys have to go back
and watch Bruce Lee movies.

942
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,843
You can see these awesome moves
he's doing in their entirety.

943
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,561
You can have a shot that doesn't
have to last only a half-second long.

944
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,530
I never even thought about it
until I did this movie Haywire.

945
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,490
Now every time I see a movie, I'm like,
"Stop cutting away."

946
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,130
"Oh, that's a stunt double."

947
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,410
(Ray) They were wonderful to watch.
No wires, no gimmicks, no quick cuts.

948
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,723
You get an actor to portray that,
you're gonna have to do quick cuts.

949
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,882
(Paul)
Bruce Lee set a new baseline.

950
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,124
Every piece of film fight choreography
has been influenced by Bruce Lee,

951
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,487
whether the people involved
know it or not.

952
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,767
- A motion picture is motion.
- Yeah.

953
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:23,287
I mean, you gotta keep
the dialogue down.

954
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,561
(Linda) We came over to Hong Kong

955
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,769
and that was when they showed
the premiere of The Big Boss.

956
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,765
The theatre was packed.

957
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,922
Bruce and I sat there towards the back.

958
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,603
(Richard) When Bruce Lee's first movie
showed in Hollywood,

959
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,762
I was so elated, I was so emotional,

960
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,081
seeing my friend, my teacher,
on the screen.

961
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,566
When the movie finishes,
it is so quiet...

962
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,203
you could hear a pin drop.

963
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,124
And Bruce is like,
"Oh, no. They hate it." You know.

964
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,202
And all of a sudden...

965
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,882
a huge roar goes up.

966
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:12,126
And they're cheering and laughing
and clapping. It was wonderful.

967
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,966
(Richard) Every time he came on and did
his fight scene, everybody applauded.

968
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:20,284
That's when we knew
he was a movie star now.

969
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,250
And then they started to spot Bruce
in the audience.

970
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,646
They carried him out on their shoulders.

971
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,520
Oh, it was thrilling.
It was thrilling to him.

972
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,843
"Finally I have been appreciated
in my work."

973
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,849
It was wonderful,
a very high moment in his life.

974
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,922
(announcer) It's The Pierre Berton Show,

975
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,402
the programme that comes to you
from the major capitals of the world.

976
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,689
This edition comes to you
from Hong Kong.

977
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,923
And Pierre's guest,
the newest Mandarin superstar.

978
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,369
His name is Bruce Lee
and he doesn't even speak Mandarin.

979
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,090
Here's Pierre.

980
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,844
There's a pretty good chance

981
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,764
that you'll get a TV series
in the States called The Warrior

982
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:11,323
in which you use, what,
the martial arts in a Western setting?

983
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,129
That was the original idea.

984
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,726
Bruce Lee had an idea for a TV show
called The Warrior,

985
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,282
which later became the series Kung Fu,
which we all know and love.

986
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,850
David Carradine did a good job,

987
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,129
but Kung Fu, the TV series,
was Bruce Lee's role.

988
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,249
The better guy doesn't always
get the job in the movie business.

989
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,288
There's a lot of politics involved.

990
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,647
Have people come up in the industry
and said,

991
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,327
"We don't know how the audience
are going to take a non-American?"

992
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,044
Well, such question has been raised.

993
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,282
In fact, it is being discussed,

994
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,967
and that is why The Warrior
probably is not gonna be on.

995
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,121
- I see.
- You see?

996
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:53,560
Because unfortunately
such thing does exist in this world.

997
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,849
Bruce Lee was a bigger star,
both in Asia and America.

998
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,400
He was a world-class martial artist.

999
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,608
He had already done The Green Hornet.

1000
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,570
And then he did not get the role
for being too Asian.

1001
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,247
He had such disdain for Hollywood

1002
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,129
and all those old movies

1003
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:14,922
having Caucasian people
play the parts of Chinese characters.

1004
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,966
I have already made up my mind

1005
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:26,045
that in the United States
I think something about the Oriental,

1006
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:30,569
I mean, the true Oriental,
should be shown.

1007
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,564
- Hollywood sure as heck hasn't.
- You better believe it, man.

1008
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,723
It's always the pigtail
and bouncing around, chop-chop,

1009
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,848
with the eyes slanted and all of that.

1010
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,527
(Reginald) There's nothing worse
in a movie than when all of a sudden

1011
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,409
some horrific stereotype shows up.

1012
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,290
You're like, "Why? Just leave us out.
Just leave us out."

1013
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,125
"We'd rather not exist in your world

1014
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,761
than exist in your world
in some buffoonery coonery."

1015
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,569
He had a lot of celebrity students

1016
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,450
and he was teaching them
philosophy and martial arts,

1017
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,726
so he sold them.

1018
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,486
But when it came down to it for Bruce
and Hollywood, they didn't get it.

1019
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,961
They didn't take the time
to know who Bruce was.

1020
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,530
This was his struggle.

1021
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,761
You want to get ahead?

1022
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,481
Here you have a bright future,
if you apply yourself.

1023
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,641
I will, sir.

1024
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,485
Hollywood was
a terrible disappointment to him,

1025
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:20,849
especially because then you throw in
the racial factor as well,

1026
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,208
that studios did not want to back
a major Chinese star.

1027
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:28,171
Asian stereotypes for women
are pretty bad. For men it's much worse.

1028
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,323
And I think he was railing against that
his whole life.

1029
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:36,440
When that little thing of disrespect
crept into my life again,

1030
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,126
which was the movie business,
I got really angry.

1031
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:44,001
It is kind of shocking, isn't it,
that that much time, 40 years,

1032
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:50,122
has passed and there hasn't been
one Asian-American romantic lead,

1033
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:55,206
or even just a movie star on that scale,
an Asian-American movie star?

1034
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,482
Not one.

1035
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,401
I don't think

1036
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:07,849
I could name
an Asian romantic lead male.

1037
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:12,403
There hasn't really been anyone since my
uncle here, particularly in Hollywood.

1038
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,007
Obviously out of China you have Jet Li,
you have Donnie Yen.

1039
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:22,690
There have been no great Asian male
leads in Hollywood who are sexy.

1040
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,843
Er, a lead male, Asian-American?

1041
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,331
Erm...

1042
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:31,849
I don't even look at him as being Asian.
He's like Bruce Lee. He's like my idol.

1043
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,288
And that's something I guess I don't
think of so much, but I guess, yeah.

1044
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,805
(Paul) A Chinese nationalist

1045
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,645
watching Bruce Lee films
will see Chinese nationalism.

1046
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,530
A white Westerner
may not even notice the ethnicity.

1047
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,490
Maybe Dean Cain, right?

1048
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,403
Isn't he part Asian?

1049
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,008
(Richard) At certain times
there were prejudices against my skin,

1050
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:55,687
but I never let it bother me, because
in the back of my mind I used to think,

1051
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,082
"I'll take care out in the parking lot
and I'll beat your head in."

1052
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:04,121
(Reginald) Bruce Lee became a complete
star making films in his own country.

1053
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,202
40 years later, things haven't changed.

1054
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,521
So if you wanna see
another star like that,

1055
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,649
it has to happen
in films made outside of the system.

1056
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,769
My first memory of Bruce Lee
is in the movie Chinese Connection.

1057
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:22,322
The last scene in the movie
there's a firing squad.

1058
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,527
When he came out and ran up
and jumped and they froze it.

1059
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,725
I was like, "Mom, what happened?"

1060
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:37,441
And she said,
"He wanted to go that way."

1061
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:41,081
And that just...
that just stuck with me.

1062
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:44,209
If you look at Chinese Connection,

1063
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,443
it's a movie about cultural nationalism,

1064
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:52,686
as expressed through action sequences,
but that's no different than Swan Lake.

1065
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,242
There's no difference between a ballet
and a kung fu movie,

1066
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,403
expressing the ideas and the emotion
through movement.

1067
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:07,002
When the Japanese bring
the sick man of Asia framed picture,

1068
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:11,210
this is speaking to a long period
of Chinese suppression and subordination

1069
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,887
that was within living memory of those
1970s Hong Kong Bruce Lee films.

1070
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,727
If you play the film
with the dubbed English

1071
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,723
and then in the original Cantonese,

1072
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,485
you see that they're essentially
different films.

1073
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:28,724
So, for example, one of the characters
goes up to Mr Wu, the translator,

1074
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,167
and in the English dubbed version
he says:

1075
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,527
Look, here,
now what's the point of this?

1076
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:34,726
The translator goes:

1077
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,008
In the Cantonese version he says:

1078
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,041
So in the English version
he's not Chinese,

1079
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:57,286
but in the subtitled Cantonese version,
he says, "Yes, I'm Chinese,

1080
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,011
but I've chosen to go with the Japanese,
the powerful."

1081
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,969
So there's a world of difference.

1082
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,690
We're consuming different films

1083
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,003
depending on the nature of the decisions
they make in translating.

1084
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,481
Westerners have thought
that they're slapstick,

1085
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:13,451
but the Chinese audience are watching
highly politically charged films

1086
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,730
with quite recent history, animosities
and resentments coursing through them.

1087
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:22,681
Now, you listen to me,
and I'll only say it once.

1088
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,046
We are not sick men.

1089
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,202
(David)
What he gave was so real and so raw

1090
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,045
because he lived it
every day of his life.

1091
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:33,808
Bruce did not get along well with the
director of the first two films, Lo Wei.

1092
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,326
Lo Wei thought that
he could put his thumb on Bruce

1093
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,131
as one of his simple actors.

1094
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:43,649
Well, he was old school and wouldn't
listen to any ideas Bruce had.

1095
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:48,965
(David) The bottom line is Bruce still
didn't feel the freedom that he wanted.

1096
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,849
He said to Raymond Chow,

1097
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,844
"I want to make this film,
The Way of the Dragon."

1098
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,003
I want to write it, I want
to produce it, I want to direct it

1099
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,003
and I can do this and act in it.

1100
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,731
(Bruce) It's really a simple plot
of a country boy

1101
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,451
going to a place
where he cannot speak the language

1102
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,126
but somehow he came out on top.

1103
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,367
He goes to Italy
and the mafia can't beat him,

1104
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,410
so they call America
and America sends over Colt.

1105
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,960
We must call America for Colt.

1106
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:28,204
- Is this Colt good?
- Is Colt good?

1107
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,408
(Paul) And Colt is Chuck Norris.

1108
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,927
Bruce Lee is fighting a real American,
you know.

1109
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,607
He's strawberry blond.
He's got hair all over his body.

1110
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,569
In fact, he uses that hair against him.

1111
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,768
So when he fought Chuck Norris...

1112
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:48,649
He represented all people of colour
fighting the Western oppressor.

1113
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,324
(speaks Spanish)

1114
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:06,447
If you're a non-white viewer,
this is a big deal.

1115
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:10,844
The little guy is beating
the best that America can provide.

1116
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,048
I can tell you,
at the Fox Theatre in St Louis,

1117
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:17,444
which was 100 percent all black,
we cheered for him.

1118
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,966
Some of us were
more politically aware than others,

1119
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,280
but everyone got the joke.

1120
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,204
He was very appealing to anybody
who's ever been oppressed

1121
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,487
because of ethnic reasons
or other reason.

1122
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:35,531
That time when Bruce was on the rise, we
were looking for countercultural heroes

1123
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,250
to fight the establishment.

1124
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,722
(Teri) It's 40 years. Wouldn't have
people forgotten him by now?

1125
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:45,124
No, I think a lot of cultures have
picked him up as sort of their hero.

1126
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,409
You had Muhammad Ali. You had
Malcolm X. You had the Black Panthers.

1127
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,960
You had a lot of radicalism going on.

1128
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,646
Bruce Lee represented
that same kind of radicalism.

1129
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:57,361
Bruce Lee emerges when America
is having a very bad time in Vietnam

1130
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,205
and cannot beat the Viet Cong,

1131
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,681
these little yellow guys in pyjamas,

1132
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,161
so Bruce Lee speaks to that.

1133
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:09,723
Anywhere you go, everybody is
about Bruce Lee and rallies behind him.

1134
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,801
He's the underdog.

1135
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,089
(Paul) You don't have to
start shouting political declarations

1136
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,527
to be culturally
and politically significant.

1137
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:20,571
That Colosseum fight was very accurate.
Taking nothing away from Chuck Norris,

1138
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,642
but I think Bruce Lee
would be victorious.

1139
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,042
That fight scene gave Chuck Norris
pretty much a career.

1140
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,441
If they said Bruce
could have beat Chuck Norris,

1141
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:31,000
I'd say, "How much do you wanna bet?"

1142
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,890
I got a fistful of green backs
in my pocket.

1143
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:38,130
Chuck got chucked out
right there in that movie.

1144
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:42,205
That's one of my favourites. Boom.
Guillotine choke in the '70s. Hello.

1145
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,282
That's being ahead of your time.

1146
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,729
When Bruce started doing the film
Way of the Dragon

1147
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,962
and he was this huge star on the rise,

1148
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,168
things were changing.

1149
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:56,483
I think he started having a hard time
trusting people around him.

1150
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:58,483
You bastard!

1151
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:04,165
Fame is a killer, literally.

1152
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,447
Put money on top of that.

1153
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,808
Suddenly you distrust people's motives,
for very good reason.

1154
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:19,726
He had told me that he doesn't know
who his friends were.

1155
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:22,087
He says he doesn't know who to trust.

1156
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:26,882
It was eye-opening
to know what the price of fame was.

1157
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,008
(Bruce Lee)

1158
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,681
You can't go to school for it.
You deal with it on a day-to-day basis.

1159
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,762
(Bruce Lee)

1160
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,441
Fame took over my mind.

1161
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,807
It almost destroyed my career,
my family.

1162
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,484
I was caught up in my own hype.

1163
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:59,769
I thought the only way
to save myself from myself

1164
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:04,209
was to do something
where I could get hit and hit back.

1165
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,248
And I thought I'd made a healthy choice

1166
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:10,644
because it was better than a whisky
bottle or, you know, whatever the fuck.

1167
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,721
It got to the point

1168
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:15,361
where he could hardly go out of
the house without people following him.

1169
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,649
He craved on sort of a soul level

1170
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,564
to be a little bit more peaceful.

1171
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,642
(Bruce Lee)

1172
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,880
Well, you can't have a normal life

1173
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,564
or make normal mistakes

1174
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,167
because everybody's constantly,
you know, looking in.

1175
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:43,124
And it was just like a smorgasbord.

1176
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:46,249
He could have had ten at a time
if he even remotely wanted to.

1177
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:50,166
The word superstar really turned me off
and I'll tell you why.

1178
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:54,086
Because the word star, man,
it's an illusion.

1179
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,891
It's something
what the public calls you.

1180
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,521
I really loved... I might get

1181
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,763
a lot of crap for this,
but Game of Death,

1182
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:10,047
and to have like no way is the way.

1183
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:13,761
He's fighting each opponent that brings
a different problem to the table

1184
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,046
and he's gotta adapt.

1185
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:19,967
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar came to Hong Kong
to visit and Bruce had this great idea.

1186
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:24,329
"Let's do a scene together. It'll be
great, a great fighting sequence."

1187
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:27,563
I'd speak to Kareem about his sessions
with Bruce and he said,

1188
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,041
"I sparred with him
and like he was just so quick."

1189
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,851
"I'd turn this way
and then he's not there."

1190
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,082
"He's kicking you
in the back of the head."

1191
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,606
"Then I turn this way
and he's over here."

1192
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:41,890
He said he couldn't catch him. There was
just no way he could lock in on him.

1193
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,088
He was just like a rabbit.

1194
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:49,929
I really love the idea of the levels
and getting to the next level,

1195
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,571
and fighting different styles.

1196
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,725
As a dancer who battled other dancers,
that was like the whole mentality.

1197
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:01,010
And on the third level, it's supposed to
be a person who is trained in weaponry,

1198
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,321
and so he chose me to do the part.

1199
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,889
Dan lnosanto, being one of the freshest
Filipinos on the planet,

1200
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:10,043
was actually the person that brought
the nunchucks to Bruce Lee.

1201
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,681
1964, I introduced the nunchucks
to Bruce Lee.

1202
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:18,411
And at the time he thought
this was a worthless piece of junk.

1203
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,769
When he moved into the LA area,
I taught him how to use it.

1204
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,923
He said, "I'm gonna use this
on The Green Hornet."

1205
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:41,965
Nunchucks was always
some mother's broom getting sacrificed,

1206
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:45,487
which would then turn into
someone's groin being sacrificed.

1207
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:49,360
In three months he was swinging it like
he had been doing it for a lifetime.

1208
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,363
I was living in Miami
when they came out.

1209
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,842
Every gangster in town had nunchucks,
and couldn't use 'em worth a shit.

1210
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:59,369
I would spend hours whipping 'em around
and trying to learn the moves,

1211
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:02,569
trying to copy how he'd have it
under his shoulder right here

1212
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,687
and have the hand out.

1213
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,003
In a short time I think
almost every child is using this.

1214
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:10,562
It became like a household product.
It's outlawed now in California.

1215
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:16,207
After I watched this movie,
I used to use that.

1216
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,846
But I always hit my elbow.

1217
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,285
Whaaa!

1218
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,762
Right out of the gate I swung real hard
and I even made the Bruce Lee noise.

1219
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,650
I went, "Whoo!" and I hit my head

1220
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,803
and there was this big nut
that came out maybe an inch.

1221
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,928
And after that
I stopped making the noise

1222
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,401
and I stopped playing
with the nunchucks.

1223
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,202
I tried to make my parents buy me
some real ones. Thank God they didn't.

1224
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:43,170
I'm nunchucking,
I'm busting myself all in the head.

1225
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:45,049
I had the rubber ones, so I'm good.

1226
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:50,966
I got into it because I stopped carrying
a gun. I carried a gun for years.

1227
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,610
I'm not ashamed to admit it.

1228
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:56,480
I think I went into therapy and I
thought, "Let me carry something else."

1229
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,441
This one particularly
is sentimental for me.

1230
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,320
These are the same nunchucks
that we used in The Game of Death.

1231
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,049
He gave me these to keep in the house.

1232
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,521
It brings out
really fond memories for me.

1233
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,969
(David) Fred Weintraub,
who was an executive at Warner Bros,

1234
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:23,362
comes to visit him in Hong Kong
on the set of Game of Death,

1235
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,841
says, "Hey, man,
we've seen what you can do."

1236
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,403
"We wanna do a film with you and we
wanna do it with Warner Bros." Boom.

1237
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,882
It was a time
when Bruce had so much opportunity

1238
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:37,806
and he was so thrilled
to co-produce Enter the Dragon.

1239
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:42,363
He said, "This is my opening
back into Hollywood."

1240
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,050
They were all there in Hong Kong,

1241
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:55,488
the producers,
Fred Weintraub, Paul Heller.

1242
01:12:55,560 --> 01:13:00,407
They're ready to film, have all this
crew, Western crew, Chinese crew,

1243
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:04,565
which was
a very difficult situation in itself,

1244
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,803
and sets are built,
and Bruce won't come to work.

1245
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:14,369
He wants to put a little more Chinese
philosophy that fits in with the story.

1246
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,522
(Bob) Bruce knew
what he wanted Dragon to be,

1247
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,444
but had problems with folks
who didn't share his vision.

1248
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,046
(Linda) And he was adamant
he was not going to the set.

1249
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:27,160
It was kind of hard around our house
because was Bruce was so frustrated.

1250
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,730
He could lose his temper.

1251
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,451
If he didn't like anything you did,
he would tell you.

1252
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,761
Linda was that fabulous wife.

1253
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,047
She knew how to talk to him
and counsel him.

1254
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:40,489
I was talking behind the scenes
to Fred and Paul and the other people,

1255
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:46,249
saying, "You need to listen to what
he has to say because he is right."

1256
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,607
He was fighting for his career.

1257
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:54,084
It was a coming together, and, yes,
Bruce did get things in that film.

1258
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,447
Let me think.

1259
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,729
Don't think. Feel.

1260
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:03,009
And they're all better off,
the world is better off,

1261
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,526
for the stand that he took that time.

1262
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,207
Action.

1263
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,444
Enter the Dragon
was Hollywood's first dipping its toe

1264
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,761
into the water of the martial art genre.

1265
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,843
Bruce Lee is explosive in a way
that no one had seen before.

1266
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:30,641
The opening scene, Bruce Lee basically
put the mixed martial arts in his film.

1267
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,249
Fighting in the kenpo gloves.

1268
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:36,563
The mixed martial arts gloves
with the open fingers.

1269
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:37,641
And he used arm bars.

1270
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:41,645
(Ray) There's not a lot of charisma
in a straight arm bar.

1271
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:42,642
He was the man.

1272
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:48,209
When he stomps out Bob Wall
and kills him...

1273
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,845
you see a lot of complex emotions
all going on at once.

1274
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,003
I haven't seen any actor
in an action film

1275
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:01,369
match all those levels and nuances
in the middle of a fight scene.

1276
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:06,167
The mirror scene was just, you know,
when he's walking around

1277
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:11,406
and he's cut up and all of a sudden
he hears his master in his head

1278
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,642
saying if you destroy the image...

1279
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:17,520
(master) Destroy the image
and you will break the enemy.

1280
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,011
You defeat the enemy,

1281
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,923
he was just... It had a tension

1282
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,166
that to me resonates because
it's cutting through all illusions.

1283
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,447
This is the moment
that he was waiting for.

1284
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:31,000
This was Bruce Lee's film in Hollywood.

1285
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:38,050
Bruce was in a studio
doing dubbing for Enter the Dragon

1286
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:41,442
and he went to the restroom
and he collapsed.

1287
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,966
I was called and came to the hospital.

1288
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:49,410
And he was unconscious
and I was talking to him,

1289
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:54,088
and he told me later
that he was like in the bottom of a well

1290
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:57,960
and he could hear me calling him,
"Come back, come back."

1291
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:00,042
And he did recover from that.

1292
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:05,047
It was a cerebral oedema,
a pressing of fluid on the brain,

1293
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,009
but they never found the cause of it.

1294
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:10,971
Ted Wong used to always tell me,
"Bruce Lee was never afraid of anything,

1295
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,247
except one thing,
and that's getting older."

1296
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:16,369
(Linda) He came to the United States
and had a complete physical

1297
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:19,205
and they pronounced him
in perfect health

1298
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,089
with the body of an 18-year-old.

1299
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,970
The doctors were very reassuring.

1300
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:28,045
He had just had a collapse.
He didn't have frequent headaches.

1301
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,168
Of course, they didn't have MRls then

1302
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,766
to see what his brain tissue
was looking like.

1303
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,968
I had seen him in June.

1304
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:38,442
He told me that he'd had an OK from UCLA
that his body was fit.

1305
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:42,286
He was not worried about himself
and he was taking good care of himself.

1306
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:44,727
(Pierre) Bruce Lee faces a real dilemma.

1307
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,371
He's on the verge of stardom
in the United States,

1308
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:51,331
but he's just achieved superstardom
as a film actor here in Hong Kong.

1309
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,846
So what does he chose,
the East or the West?

1310
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:57,561
It's the kind of problem most
budding movie actors would welcome.

1311
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,130
I was called and told by Raymond Chow,
"You should get to the hospital."

1312
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,646
"They're taking Bruce to the hospital."

1313
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:13,361
And I was there
way before Bruce got there.

1314
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:19,004
So eventually the ambulance arrived.
It took a long time.

1315
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,969
Everything took too long a time.

1316
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:24,328
He got to the hospital
and I saw him laying there

1317
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:29,440
and I saw them do a big injection
of something right into his heart.

1318
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:39,121
And I remember turning to a medical
person standing there and saying...

1319
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,248
I couldn't say, "Is he dead?"

1320
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:44,403
I said, "Is he alive?

1321
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:48,087
And they shook their heads
and said, "No."

1322
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:52,802
And that was just unbelievable.

1323
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,805
It must be a mistake,
you know, it's not real.

1324
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,646
What can I say? It was.

1325
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:46,330
(Diana) You can see how
when he passed away, you know, how...

1326
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:52,851
how difficult that was and, you know,
how difficult that was for my dad.

1327
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:55,446
It's the first time
I saw my dad ever cry.

1328
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,522
Yeah, that's true.

1329
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,689
It was really rough.

1330
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,802
Well, yeah.

1331
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:13,328
I said, "Dan, is it true?
Ls Bruce Lee dead?"

1332
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:16,609
"I got a lot of calls."
And he says, "Yeah, Rich."

1333
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:19,206
Linda called him from Hong Kong,

1334
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:23,001
and he was in a trance on his own
and talking about Bruce Lee.

1335
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:26,402
He was so in grief,
so in mourning about Bruce's death.

1336
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:30,201
He was just really uniquely different
from everybody else.

1337
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:34,761
(Shannon) My memories,
they're more like glimpses.

1338
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:38,970
But I remember primarily
the funeral in Hong Kong,

1339
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:42,965
because it was so massive,
and sort of being dragged through that,

1340
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,691
because it was chaotic.

1341
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:50,926
And I remember my dad's mom
taking us to get candy

1342
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,561
and feeling really happy about that.

1343
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:00,890
(Mickey) I was in class, actually,
when Bruce Lee died.

1344
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,645
There were guys in there
crying, sobbing, just...

1345
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:05,882
I mean, Bruce Lee, you know...

1346
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,490
He was just... he was it.

1347
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:16,325
Will you tell me what Teacher died of?

1348
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:20,610
Forensic scientists from around
the world came up with the conclusion

1349
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:23,251
that he had had
a hypersensitive reaction

1350
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:26,688
to this medication
that he had been given for a headache

1351
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:30,651
and that that had caused
the fluid on his brain

1352
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:34,486
and that he had succumbed to that.

1353
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:39,404
It's still something
that people cannot believe.

1354
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:43,371
He was well. There was nothing wrong.
How could a healthy man die?

1355
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:47,889
And then there's all this stuff about,
you know, how he died,

1356
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,644
the sinister way in which he died.

1357
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:53,281
He had an aneurysm

1358
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:56,648
or the death hands got him
or, you know...

1359
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:57,721
He was murdered.

1360
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:00,724
They gave him the dim mak,
they gave him a death touch.

1361
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,410
There's absolutely positively
something a little shady

1362
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,164
about the way that it all went down.

1363
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:10,928
How he could pass away at that age,
you know, but it does happen,

1364
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,891
so I've learned to cope with it
and deal with it.

1365
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,530
But it always puzzled me.

1366
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,648
The fact that my family is cursed

1367
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:23,601
and the very sad and tragic circumstance
that my brother died,

1368
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,808
those are sort of the themes
that pop up.

1369
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:30,329
They wrote so many stupid stories, the
tong killing him and all that bullshit,

1370
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:33,051
and he died of drugs,
that sold magazines.

1371
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:37,282
He died in Betty Ting Pei's apartment,
so there's no denying that.

1372
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:42,207
The decision was made by the producers
to say that he had died at home.

1373
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:45,363
When that news got out
that he had not died at home,

1374
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:46,885
the tabloid press went crazy.

1375
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:51,170
But my mom knew he had been
at a meeting and doing his films.

1376
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:55,006
She was dealing with his death
and taking care of her kids,

1377
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,845
and all of that gossip
was just the tabloid press

1378
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:03,643
trying to make it bigger and crazier
than it needed to be.

1379
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:10,171
It is my wish that the newspapers
and the people of Hong Kong

1380
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:12,607
will stop speculating
on the circumstances

1381
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,444
surrounding my husband's death.

1382
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:17,524
Please remember him
for his genius, his art

1383
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,649
and the magic he brought
to every one of us.

1384
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:34,330
(Linda) Of course I was going to go
and see his film and applaud him

1385
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,926
and be with people who admired him.

1386
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:42,769
That was always my thought in my head,
is, "I need to do this for Bruce."

1387
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:45,286
She really is this incredible woman

1388
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:49,046
with just great dignity
and grace under fire.

1389
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,167
(Linda) It was great to see Bruce again,

1390
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:57,848
but only a month later my memories
were very fresh anyway, you know.

1391
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:03,363
It was more pain than joy at the time.

1392
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,722
Everybody said all these years,
you know,

1393
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:17,930
he had an allergic reaction
to marijuana, he had a brain aneurysm.

1394
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,083
The most important thing
is how he lived.

1395
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:25,570
Every time you see him,
it's still emotional.

1396
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:28,563
We miss the friend.

1397
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:32,281
I'm now 74, but there really
has not ever been a day

1398
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:36,410
that I haven't thought about him
at least once, maybe twice

1399
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:39,370
or three times or four times
or five times through the day.

1400
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:43,161
There's nobody who's gonna replace
Bruce Lee, not while you or I are alive.

1401
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,605
It just ain't gonna happen.

1402
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,729
This genius passes away
way before his time.

1403
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,928
We have to be thankful
we had him for 32 years.

1404
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,449
(Paul) Bruce Lee was just a symbol

1405
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,887
of everything
that every little boy wanted to be.

1406
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:59,328
You have offended my family
and you have...

1407
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:02,085
Disgraced the Shaolin temple.

1408
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:04,049
Whoo!

1409
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:07,969
(David) The most important thing
he's ever done and accomplished

1410
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:09,849
is bringing people together.

1411
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,810
Bruce brought...
he brought cultures together.

1412
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:16,248
(Jones) People remember him
for being powerful beyond measure,

1413
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,129
you know, for being limitless,

1414
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:21,522
for standing for things
when people crucified him.

1415
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,683
It didn't matter what colour you are,
what country you came from,

1416
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,091
you were a Bruce Lee fan.

1417
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,288
He's the man. He's the truth.

1418
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:31,891
And it was amazing
how he connected so many people.

1419
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:36,010
Not just martial arts,
but people from all walks of life.

1420
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,765
If Bruce was here today,
he'd be on Dancing with the Stars

1421
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,205
and he'd win it, hands down.

1422
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:43,090
(Bruce) Doggone it,
such is the basic need of a human being,

1423
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:46,243
I might as well enjoy it
before I kick the bucket,

1424
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,129
like that type of an attitude.

1425
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:52,364
We remember Bruce Lee today
because he was so much fun to watch.

1426
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:55,250
He was like a mythological hero.

1427
01:24:56,160 --> 01:25:00,051
My strength flowed
through Bruce to me, so...

1428
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:02,043
He left me with that gift.

1429
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:05,010
The idea is running water
never grows stale,

1430
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:08,289
so you gotta just keep on flowing.

1431
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,805
He didn't compromise.

1432
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:13,680
People really felt that presence about
him and felt that influence from him

1433
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:17,924
and they just wanna somehow
connect with him.

1434
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,446
When people try to relate to him,
they do say,

1435
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,569
"That's my Bruce Lee.
That's what I connect with."

1436
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:26,484
When I watch Bruce Lee, I am Bruce Lee.

1437
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,404
- Dragon whips his tail.
- Dragon whips his tail.

1438
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,882
I watch Bruce Lee, you watch Bruce Lee
and we're both being Bruce Lee.

1439
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:41,442
Bruce would want us to recognise

1440
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:45,241
that he honestly expressed himself,

1441
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:48,403
that he did not bow down
to any sacred cows.

1442
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:53,168
To express oneself honestly,
not lying to oneself,

1443
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:55,004
and to express myself honestly,

1444
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:58,926
that, my friend, is very hard to do.

1445
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,971
He would urge others
to examine your life, you know,

1446
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,283
see how things fit you personally,

1447
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:09,330
find your strength, take a stab at life,

1448
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:12,404
don't just sit back
and take it easy, you know?

1449
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,165
That's not what life is about.

1450
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:24,530
It's even more fun to see him now
when I look back, you know.

1451
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:28,047
Oh! What an amazing young man he was.

1452
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:42,766
(Pierre) Do you think of yourself
as Chinese or North American?

1453
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:45,571
You know what I want to think of myself?

1454
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:48,603
As a human being.

1455
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:52,571
Because, I mean, I don't wanna
sound like "as Confucius say",

1456
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:56,565
but under the sky, under the heaven,
man, there is but one family.

1457
01:26:56,640 --> 01:27:00,201
It just so happened, man,
that people are different.

1458
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,921
Empty your mind.
Be formless, shapeless.

1459
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,684
Like water.

1460
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,240
Now, you put water into a cup,

1461
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:47,526
it becomes the cup.

1462
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,887
Put water into a bottle,
it becomes the bottle.

1463
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:52,884
You put it in a teapot,
it becomes the teapot.

1464
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:56,851
Now, water can flow or it can crash.

1465
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:58,922
Be water, my friend.
