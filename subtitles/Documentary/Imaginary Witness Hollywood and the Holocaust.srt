1
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:11,099
<i>Who is it?</i>

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,778
<i>- What's going on?- My cat...
give her back.</i>

3
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:18,008
<i>If Bok Gil were really Haru, then I
think I could really sleep comfortably.</i>

4
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:20,878
<i>If we do a DNA test with Haru's fur and
Bok Gil's fur, we will be able to know.</i>

5
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:22,208
<i>Can I really do this?</i>

6
00:00:22,209 --> 00:00:25,168
If we do the DNA test, we can
find out if Bok Gil is Haru.

7
00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:27,488
<i>Don't appear in front of me ever again.</i>

8
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:30,448
<i>You submitted only your name to the
competition, and you have nothing to say?</i>

9
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,398
<i>Do you have proof? Do you have
proof that it's really yours?!</i>

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,238
<i>I don't need a friend like you.</i>

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,908
<i>The collar I made Haru is a one-of-a-kind.</i>

12
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:43,259
<i>The fact that Bok Gil has
it on doesn't make sense.</i>

13
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,438
You anticipated that. Why
don't we go check it out.

14
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,398
<i>The test results are out.
Bok Gil is not Haru.</i>

15
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,768
<i>I think I'll be able to
sleep really well tonight.</i>

16
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:57,889
<i>If Jong Hyeon knows that Bok Gil is
Haru, won't he probably hate me?</i>

17
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:07,398
<i>It looks as though Bok
Gil was Haru after all.</i>

18
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:10,458
<i>Do you want to see Bok Gil?</i>

19
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:13,748
<i>Episode 7</i>Bok Gil, open your eyes.

20
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:15,508
Listen to me carefully.

21
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,538
Bok Gil.

22
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:21,408
Bok Gil, you're listening to me, right?

23
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:26,508
You are... mmm... Bok Gil,
but Haru at the same time.

24
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:29,648
<i>Ah, I'm sleepy.</i>

25
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:32,788
I can't tell if this world has
really gotten better or not.

26
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:37,448
Even a cat can get a DNA test.

27
00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:40,768
You were too young, so you
probably don't remember.

28
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:43,858
The fact that you are Haru has
been proven scientifically.

29
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:46,648
<i>Stop talking nonsense and go away.</i>

30
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:51,838
After losing you, Na Woo has not been
able to have a comfortable night's sleep.

31
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:55,578
So, Na Woo will be coming to visit you
once in a while. Do you understand?

32
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:59,909
Okay? Why do you keep on calling me Haru?
Are you talking in your sleep?

33
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:04,239
She must be here.

34
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,729
Hi!

35
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:20,449
<i>What? She's here again?</i>

36
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:32,079
<i>♪13: The One in My Heart Is You.</i>

37
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:34,578
Bok Gil.

38
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:37,658
<i>Let me go. Let me go!</i>

39
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:41,218
You wanted to do this so badly?

40
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:43,818
Giving Haru a bath was my wish.

41
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:48,398
<i>I don't like taking baths! Don't touch me!</i>

42
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:50,308
Cover Bok Gil's ears.

43
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:54,708
Hey, Bok Gil hates bath,
so let's do it quickly.

44
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:56,838
No. You have to do it thoroughly.

45
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:59,698
<i>So, you both are going to
keep doing this? Move!</i>

46
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:02,249
Ah! Hurry! Hurry!

47
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:05,598
Bok Gil!

48
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,079
You're all wet!

49
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:13,559
Hey, you dry off first.

50
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,479
I'll bring you something to change into.

51
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:26,119
Ah, I-I'll do it.

52
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:33,979
Bok Gil, Unni brought you presents.

53
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:38,658
Hey, what's that?

54
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:42,248
What else? Presents for Bok Gil.

55
00:03:42,249 --> 00:03:45,798
Ah, that's enough. Enough, enough.

56
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:48,288
Why? Bok Gil likes it too.

57
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:52,398
We can only accept one item from that box.

58
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,249
Just one?

59
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,458
Why don't we take the rest
to the animal shelter.

60
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:01,488
I wanted to do all the things I
couldn't do during the past 7 years.

61
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:05,488
You don't have to do that. There's plenty
of time to do things in the future.

62
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:11,028
And, this may be Bok Gil's house,
but it's also my space as well.

63
00:04:11,029 --> 00:04:15,788
You're right. I can't just bring in anything
I want to someone else's home. Sorry.

64
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,868
- Especially, there.- The desk?

65
00:04:18,869 --> 00:04:24,258
When I'm working, never,
ever touch anything.

66
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:29,578
I didn't even think that things could get
uncomfortable because of me. Sorry for that too.

67
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:34,398
Haru. Bok Gil.

68
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,499
<i>Since you brought me toys,
I will let it slide.</i>

69
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:44,819
<i>Hold me as much as you want.</i>

70
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:50,698
Ah, please! Seriously!

71
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,858
Wait, you're saying Bok Gil
was really Na Woo's cat?

72
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:56,068
Yeah.

73
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:59,748
To think that Bok Gil had that
kind of a birth secret story.

74
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:02,189
It's so touching.

75
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:05,078
Hey, then, are you dating Na Woo now?

76
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,179
Ah, seriously!

77
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,559
Think however you want.

78
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:17,798
Well, anyway, it's not like
you have time to even date.

79
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:20,408
This is an important time in your life since it's
all about whether you get to make a debut or not.

80
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:26,228
It looks like it's going to be you anyway. Jin Seong
isn't good enough to be competition with you.

81
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:29,218
He got first place for our
bookstore's bestseller.

82
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:31,318
Really?

83
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,408
Forget it. Let's go to church.

84
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:34,888
Church? Why?

85
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:39,158
You only go during Christmas because the
pretty girls give you good food to eat.

86
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:42,089
We should pray in the name of the
Father, Son, and The Holy Spirit.

87
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:46,649
The company said they are
making their decision tomorrow.

88
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:49,668
My baby...

89
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:54,428
Editor Dokgo said that she'll be supporting
yours, so we have one supporter for sure.

90
00:05:54,429 --> 00:05:58,028
For the rest, we can just pray about it.

91
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:01,188
Hey, live nicely every day.

92
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:03,508
Don't get in trouble with God for going
to him only when you are like this.

93
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:06,758
This is not the time for
you to be so relaxed.

94
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,398
You don't want to lobby. You don't want
to pray. Then what are you going to do?

95
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:14,098
I better get to work.

96
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:16,968
Hey, how can you work in this situation?

97
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:21,788
You can't even debut, and you have tons of stacked up
drawings to do. Are you going to make origami or what?

98
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:23,958
Hey! Every time I am talking to you...

99
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:28,159
Am I a person that has to
always look at your back, huh?

100
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:42,399
Ah, they are still contacting me.
It's already so late...

101
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:44,578
Oh, oh!

102
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:47,438
What are you doing during work hours, Mr.
Part-Timer?

103
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,258
Manager, please give that back.

104
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,478
I'm supposed to get an
important call today. Please.

105
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,618
What is most important to you, Mr.
Part-Timer?

106
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:57,068
Customer Service.

107
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:00,988
No. It's your superior's command. Until
you get off I will be holding on to this.

108
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:02,619
Go on.

109
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:08,959
Princess Heo's number has
to be in here for sure.

110
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:13,658
I will try 100,00 times
and certainly find it.

111
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:15,719
100,000 times.

112
00:07:16,549 --> 00:07:19,659
7224, 7225

113
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:23,809
Bok Gil's flower has bloomed.

114
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:31,898
Bok Gil's flower has bloomed.
Bok Gil's flower has bloomed.

115
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:33,928
<i>You're playing well all by yourself.</i>

116
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:37,699
Bok Gil's flower has bloomed!

117
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:43,568
What... you don't feel
like playing right now?

118
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:47,768
<i>Human, send her away. She's annoying.</i>

119
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:50,529
Then, should I get you some snacks?

120
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:55,868
There's no water.

121
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:59,169
Jong Hyeon, do you have any water?

122
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,618
I'll go buy some.

123
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,658
<i>Where are you going?</i>

124
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:10,878
<i>Don't leave me alone with this girl.
I don't want it!</i>

125
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,969
Bok Gil. Play well.

126
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:18,418
Should we play, just the two of us?

127
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,678
<i>Ah! Don't come any closer.</i>

128
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:24,518
No! If you go up there,
Jong Hyeon will get mad!

129
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,618
<i>I'll do what I want.</i>

130
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:29,979
Aiyoo, seriously. Get down.

131
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:34,809
It looks fine.

132
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:44,378
Ooh, it's good.

133
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:48,359
<i>Oh. Hey, hey.</i>

134
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:01,058
What are you doing?

135
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:04,559
Oh, the thing is...

136
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,358
I told you not to touch my things!

137
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:09,838
I didn't look at it because I wanted to.

138
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,228
I went to get Bok Gil and saw it.
But, it was so interesting.

139
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:15,659
That's enough now. Leave.

140
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,248
Aren't you going?

141
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:23,928
What did I do that was so wrong? You said I
could come over to take care of Bok Gil.

142
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:26,828
I also told you not to touch my things!

143
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:28,668
Did I do it on purpose?

144
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:34,958
While you when to buy water, Bok Gil went on your desk.
I was trying to stop her and I saw your drawings.

145
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,108
Then, was I supposed to keep my eyes closed? Have
you been like this towards Bok Gil all these years?

146
00:09:39,109 --> 00:09:39,669
What?

147
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:46,569
You seem to be feeling extra sensitive because you
are working. I'll take Bok Gil with me to the cafe.

148
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:53,068
What the heck are you doing?

149
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:58,798
Lately, Bok Gil has not been eating well and she's
not doing well. But you want to take her with you?

150
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:04,919
Are you in your right mind? If you are
going to do this, don't ever come back!

151
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:09,069
You're really mean!

152
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,428
Yes, Editor.

153

Hey, hey, hey, hey. Sit down.
Ah, seriously.

Not all dreams come true.

167
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:44,828
Hey! You haven't even tried that long. Just
keep trying for a little longer. If you do...

168
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:51,418
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.
But I know myself too well.

169
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,389
I have no talent.

170
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:56,508
Are you confident you won't regret it?

171
00:11:56,509 --> 00:12:01,988
No, but is there anything in life
you can guarantee you won't regret?

172
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:08,659
Sometimes you give up, you regret
at times, and that's just life.

173
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:16,219
When I was in high school, I really
loved going to the art studio.

You were there, Soo In was there too.

175

178
00:12:37,609 --> 00:12:43,379
the other has given up. Now
there's just you left.

179

00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:12,169
Contract? Then your book should
be coming out in no time.

311
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:15,228
Well, I'm not sure...

312
00:24:15,229 --> 00:24:18,508
With Writer Park, the webtoon...

313
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:21,228
Once the webtoon is a hit, the
book comes out shortly thereafter.

314
00:24:21,229 --> 00:24:24,528
Yes, that usually is how things work.

315
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,488
Do you have any issues
working part-time here?

316
00:24:27,489 --> 00:24:31,468
Do you know why I've always spoken to
you with honorifics, Mr. Part Timer?

317
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:35,458
Ah! That's why you asked
for time off that time.

318
00:24:35,459 --> 00:24:40,018
Then you should have told me more clearly in
detail. I defintiely would have let you go.

319
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:41,618
- Oh, what is it?- My arm, my arm.

320
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:44,338
- Ah, this too.- Ah, this.

321
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:46,508
Would you like to take a vacation day?
A day? Two? Or indefinitely?

322
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:49,608
No... I mean, I can give you
as many days as you need.

323
00:24:49,609 --> 00:24:53,108
Well, that would be great for me.
I was needing more time to write.

324
00:24:53,109 --> 00:24:56,298
You know, I have an amazing item.

325
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:59,418
It is such an entertaining story.

326
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:01,158
A dog is the main character.

327
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:03,958
But the dog can speak it's thoughts.
What do you think?

328
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:06,028
Bok Gil, look.

329
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:09,808
It's not enough with just the grooming.
Cats need baths.

330
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,278
See, you have to take a bath!

331
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,778
<i>No, I hate taking a bath.</i>

332
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:17,078
Here.

333
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:19,958
Is this cats cafe's concept is camping?

334
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:21,638
You want to go?

335
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:23,398
<i>Yeah, it looks fun.</i>

336
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:25,978
- Wow, it looks nice.<i>- Ohhh.</i>

337
00:25:25,979 --> 00:25:27,248
<i>It looks nice.</i>

338
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:29,488
Ah, hey, let go, let go.

339
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:31,178
What are you going to buy me?

340
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:33,188
What? Buy what? You should pay.

341
00:25:33,189 --> 00:25:35,768
Wow you are something.

342
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:39,959
Noonim, give us two of your
most expensive coffee.

343
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:44,848
I don't see Na Woo today.

344
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:47,868
<i>Is she busy preparing for her exhibition?</i>

345
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:51,448
Have you told Na Woo? She
would be so excited for you.

346
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:54,648
Later. I can just tell her later.

347
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:59,569
Wow. If Soo In found out you
debuted, she would be ecstatic.

348
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:04,348
I wish I could have been there.

349
00:26:04,349 --> 00:26:07,908
What did Jin Seong's face look like?
He was totally frustrated, right?

350
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:10,628
Regardless, he always has
that frustrated look.

351
00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:13,048
He must have looked even more frustrated.

352
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:14,788
Tell me more specifically.

353
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:16,848
How many times do I need to
tell you that he just went out.

354
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:20,708
How can you lack descriptive
ability being a webtoon writer?

355
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:23,138
Look... He'd say, "No way, that can't
be"... with his nostrils flaring.

356
00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:25,849
Stop it. Stop it Yook Hae Gong.

357
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:30,778
Look like something really
exciting has happened.

358
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:35,058
Of course! It's the best day
for Writer Hyeon Jong Hyeon.

359
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:37,359
- Is that so?- Yes.

360
00:26:38,739 --> 00:26:42,858
I've tried to be patient, but
listen here Mr. Hyeon Jong Hyeon!

361
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:43,709
W-what?

362
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,309
Because she took care of you all night,
do you know she had to go to the ER?

363
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:51,658
The ER?

364
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,058
What? Sick?

365
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:55,968
Who? Na Woo took care of you?

366
00:26:55,969 --> 00:26:56,909
You were sick, punk?

367
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:00,158
You! Please shut your mouth.

368
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,238
Excuse me, is Na Woo really sick?

369
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:06,348
If you don't see someone, should you
be concerned about their health first?

370
00:27:06,349 --> 00:27:09,238
How can you be so cruel to someone
who took care of you all night!

371
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:11,688
I-I-I'm sorry.

372
00:27:11,689 --> 00:27:13,238
Is Na Woo at the hospital right now?

373
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:15,278
She was released.

374
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,358
Do you know that Na Woo used to be
very sick when she was a child?

375
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:21,038
I heard.

376
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,068
Can I perhaps meet with Na Woo now?

377
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:25,548
Forget it.

378
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:29,468
I should have stopped her when she was
following you around like a lost puppy.

379
00:27:29,469 --> 00:27:31,389
So upsetting.

380
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:38,649
What are we going to do? It looks
like Na Woo is really sick.

381
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,568
<i>What the heck are you doing?</i>

382
00:28:36,569 --> 00:28:41,658
<i>Lately, Bok Gil has not been eating well and she's
not doing well. But you want to take her with you?</i>

383
00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:44,658
<i>You. If you're going to be like
this, don't come here again.</i>

384
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:47,399
<i>You're really mean!</i>

385
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:54,629
<i>Because she took care of you all night,
do you know she had to go to the ER?</i>

386
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:02,598
<i>Oh Na Woo</i>

387
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:05,599
<i>Who are you thinking about?</i>

388
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:09,419
Soo In.

389
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:14,238
<i>I'm a little jealous.</i>

390

<i>Rather than me, you're
thinking of a different girl.</i>

391
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:25,138
It's not like that.

392
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:28,349
<i>You look good.</i>

393
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:31,438
Me?

394
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:36,809
<i>You laugh a lot more than before. And
you know how to care for someone.</i>

395
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:44,829
<i>It's a relief that you aren't alone now.</i>

396
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,289
I'm sorry.

397
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:56,018
For sending you off like that.

398
00:29:56,019 --> 00:30:02,689
<i>No, I'm sorry. For leaving like that.</i>
