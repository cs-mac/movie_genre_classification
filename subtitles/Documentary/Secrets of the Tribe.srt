1
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,191
I can't let you out, Hedwig.

2
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,750
I'm not allowed to use
magic outside of school.

3
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,909
Besides, if Uncle Vernon Harry Potter!

4
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,238
Now you've done it.

5
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,440
He's in there. Vernon?

6
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,309
I'm warning you, if you can't control
that bloody bird, it'll have to go.

7
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,193
But she's bored.

8
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,672
If I could only let her
out for an hour or two.

9
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,628
So you can send secret messages to
your freaky little friends? No, sir.

10
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,715
But I haven't had any messages
from any of my friends.

11
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,472
Not one

12
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,279
All summer.

13
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,557
Who would want to be friends with you?

14
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,075
I should think you'd be
a little more grateful.

15
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,596
We've raised you since you were a
baby, given you the food off our table

16
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,796
Even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom

17
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,394
Purely out of the
goodness of our hearts.

18
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,950
Not now. It's for
when the Masons arrive.

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,312
Which should be any minute.

20
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,679
Now, let's go over our
schedule once again, shall we?

21
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,671
Petunia, when the Masons
arrive, you will be...?

22
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,389
In the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

23
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,314
Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
I'll be waiting to open the door.

24
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,311
Excellent.

25
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,432
And you?

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,198
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise
and pretending that I don't exist.

27
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,998
Too right, you will.

28
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,516
With any luck, this could be the day
I make the biggest deal of my career

29
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,070
And you will not mess it up.

30
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,390
Harry Potter, such an honor it is.

31
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,870
Who are you? Dobby,
sir. Dobby the houseelf.

32
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,874
Not to be rude or anything

33
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,828
But this isn't a great time for me
to have a house elf in my bedroom.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,389
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.

35
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,552
It's just that Dobby
has come to tell you....

36
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,350
It is difficult, sir. Dobby
wonders where to begin.

37
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,072
Why don't you sit down?
Sit down? Sit down?

38
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,512
Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to offend you or anything.

39
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,750
Offend Dobby?

40
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,150
Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir

41
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,872
But never has he been asked to sit
down by a wizard, like an equal.

42
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,274
You can't have met many
decent wizards then.

43
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,749
No, I haven't.

44
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,559
That was an awful thing to say.

45
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,510
Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.

46
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,999
Dobby, please, stop.

47
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,834
Don't mind that. It's just the cat.

48
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,037
Bad Dobby. Stop! Stop,
Dobby. Please, be quiet.

49
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,395
Are you all right?

50
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,873
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.

51
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,112
Dobby almost spoke
ill of his family, sir.

52
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,068
Your family? The wizard
family Dobby serves, sir.

53
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,118
Dobby is bound to serve
one family forever.

54
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,714
If they ever knew Dobby was here....

55
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,832
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to
protect Harry Potter. To warn him.

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,195
Harry Potter must not go back

57
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,876
To Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry this year.

58
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,989
There is a plot, a plot to make
most terrible things happen.

59
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,357
What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?

60
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,555
Can't say.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,472
Okay, I understand. You
can't say. Don't make me talk.

62
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,991
Dobby. Dobby, put the
lamp down. Bad Dobby.

63
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,039
So when they arrive
at the ninth hole....

64
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,988
Give me the lamp.

65
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,949
Dobby, stop!

66
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,918
Let me go. Get in there and keep quiet.

67
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,959
What the devil are you
doing up here? I was just

68
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,759
You just ruined the punch line
of my Japanese golfer joke.

69
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,673
Sorry.

70
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,073
One more sound and you'll wish
you'd never been born, boy.

71
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,869
And fix that door. Yes, sir.

72
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,638
See why I've got to go back?

73
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,395
I don't belong here. I belong
in your world, at Hogwarts.

74
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,997
It's the only place I've got friends.
Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?

75
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,958
Well, I expect they've been....

76
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,591
Hang on. How do you know my
friends haven't been writing to me?

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,992
Harry Potter mustn't
be angry with Dobby.

78
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,199
Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought
his friends had forgotten him

79
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,875
Harry Potter might not want
to go back to school, sir.

80
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,231
Give me those. Now. No!

81
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,191
Dobby, get back here.

82
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,437
Dobby, please, no.

83
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,593
Harry Potter must say he's
not going back to school.

84
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,275
I can't. Hogwarts is my home.

85
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,278
Then Dobby must do it, sir,
for Harry Potter's own good.

86
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,230
It spread as far as the eye could see,
all over the floor of this building.

87
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,277
One plumber said,
Look at all that water.

88
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,318
The second plumber said, "Yes,
and that's just the top of it."

89
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,513
I'm so sorry. It's my
nephew. He's very disturbed.

90
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,832
Meeting strangers upsets him.
That's why I kept him upstairs.

91
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,435
You're never going back to that school.

92
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,435
You're never going to see those
freaky friends of yours again. Never!

93
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,789
Hiya, Harry.

94
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,118
Ron. Fred. George. What
are you all doing here?

95
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,989
Rescuing you, of course.
Now, come on, get your trunk.

96
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,076
You better stand back.

97
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,516
Let's go.

98
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,911
What was that? What was it?

99
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,236
Potter!

100
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,992
Dad, what's going on?

101
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,109
Go. Go. Go.

102
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,269
Dad, hurry up.

103
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,156
Come on. Come on, Harry, hurry up.

104
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,792
Petunia, he's escaping!

105
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,353
I've got you, Harry. Come here!

106
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,552
Let go of me! No, boy!

107
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,598
You and that bloody pigeon
aren't going anywhere.

108
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,318
Get off! Drive!

109
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,277
Right. Right!

110
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,032
No! No! No! No!

111
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,958
Dad!

112
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,153
Damn.

113
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,829
By the way, Harry, happy birthday.

114
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,798
Come on.

115
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,231
Okay, come on.

116
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,156
Okay, come on.

117
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,953
Think it'd be all right if we had
some? Yeah, Mum will never know.

118
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,032
It's not much, but it's home.

119
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,395
I think it's brilliant.

120
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,715
Where have you been?

121
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,032
Harry, how wonderful to see you, dear.

122
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,636
Beds empty. No note. Car gone.

123
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,678
You could have died.
You could have been seen.

124
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,754
Of course, I don't
blame you, Harry, dear.

125
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,832
They were starving him, Mum.
There were bars on his window.

126
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,551
Well, you best hope I don't put
bars on your window, Ronald Weasley.

127
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,756
Come on, Harry, time
for a spot of breakfast.

128
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,519
Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in.

129
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,116
That's it. There we go.

130
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,956
Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
Yes, dear, it was on the cat.

131
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,112
Hello.

132
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,599
What did I do?

133
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,151
Ginny. She's been talking about you
all summer. A bit annoying, really.

134
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,834
Morning, Weasleys. Morning, Dad.

135
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,355
What a night. Nine raids. Nine! Raids?

136
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,315
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in
the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.

137
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,677
Dad loves Muggles, thinks
they're fascinating.

138
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,956
Well, now.

139
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,949
And who are you?

140
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,110
Sorry, sir. I'm Harry,
sir. Harry Potter.

141
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,273
Good Lord. Are you really?

142
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,952
Well, Ron has told us all about
you, of course. When did he get here?

143
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,553
This morning.

144
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,715
Your sons flew that enchanted car of
yours to Surrey and back last night.

145
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,191
Did you really? How did it go?

146
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,990
I mean That was very wrong
indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.

147
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,955
Now, Harry, you must
know all about Muggles.

148
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,079
Tell me, what exactly is the
function of a rubber duck?

149
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,119
Well, that'll be Errol with the post.

150
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,313
Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?

151
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,712
Errol. He's always doing that.

152
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,108
Look, it's our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.

153
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,192
Dumbledore must know you' re here.
Doesn't miss a trick, that man.

154
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,237
No. This lot won't come cheap.

155
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,552
The spell books alone are
expensive. We'll manage.

156
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,313
There's only one place we're going
to get all of this. Diagon Alley.

157
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,839
Right.

158
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,036
Here we are, Harry. You go first, dear.

159
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,033
But Harry's never traveled
by Floo powder before, Mum.

160
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,189
Floo powder?

161
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,478
You go first, Ron, so that
Harry can see how it's done. Yes.

162
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,877
In you go.

163
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,833
That's it.

164
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,838
Diagon Alley.

165
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,996
You see? It's quite easy,
dear. Don't be afraid. Come on.

166
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,829
Come on.

167
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,072
In you go. That's it. Mind your head.

168
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,516
That's right. Now,
take your Floo powder.

169
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,355
That's it, very good.

170
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,672
Now, don't forget to
speak very, very clearly.

171
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,715
Diagonally.

172
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,229
What did he say, dear? Diagonally.

173
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,435
I thought he did.

174
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:02,990
Not lost, are you, my dear? I'm
fine, thank you. I was just going....

175
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,472
Come with us. We'll help
you find your way back.

176
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,230
No. Please Harry?

177
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,435
Hagrid!

178
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,478
What do you think you're
doing down here? Come on.

179
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:25,068
You're a mess, Harry. Skulking
around Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.

180
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,074
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you' re up to no good.

181
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,390
I was lost, l

182
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,393
Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?

183
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,475
Me? I was.... I was looking
for FleshEating Slug Repellent.

184
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,438
They're ruining all the school cabbages.

185
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,710
Harry. Hagrid.

186
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,273
Hello, Hermione.

187
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,154
It's so good to see you.
It's great to see you too.

188
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,268
What did you do to your glasses?

189
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,193
Oculus Reparo.

190
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,159
I definitely need to remember that one.

191
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,869
You'll be all right now then,
Harry? Right. I'll leave you to it.

192
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,439
Okay, bye. Thank you. Bye.

193
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,517
Come on, everyone's been so worried.

194
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,869
Harry.

195
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,112
Thank goodness. We'd hoped you'd
only gone one grate too far.

196
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,999
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.

197
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,355
Here he is.

198
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,758
Mum fancies him.

199
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,037
Make way there, please.
Let me by, madam. Thank you.

200
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,516
Excuse me, little girl. This
is for the Daily Prophet.

201
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,273
It can't be. Harry Potter?

202
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,557
Harry Potter!

203
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,869
Excuse me, madam.

204
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,475
Nice big smile, Harry. T ogether,
you and I rate the front page.

205
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,677
Ladies and gentlemen, what an
extraordinary moment this is.

206
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,117
When young Harry stepped into
Flourish and Blotts this morning

207
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,193
To purchase my autobiography, Magical Me

208
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,313
Which, incidentally,
is currently celebrating

209
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,110
Its 27th week atop the
Daily Prophet bestseller list

210
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,592
He had no idea that he
would, in fact, be leaving

211
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,430
With my entire collected works

212
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,116
Free of charge.

213
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,350
Now, ladies?

214
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,552
Harry, now you give me those,
and I'll get them signed.

215
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,076
All of you wait outside. That's it.

216
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,389
I'll bet you loved
that, didn't you, Potter?

217
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,872
Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a
bookshop without making the front page.

218
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,118
Leave him alone.

219
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,636
Look, Potter. You've got
yourself a girlfriend.

220
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,679
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.

221
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,229
Mr. Potter.

222
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,388
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.

223
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,676
Forgive me.

224
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,956
Your scar is legend.

225
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,630
As, of course, is the
wizard who gave it to you.

226
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,030
Voldemort killed my parents.

227
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,350
He was nothing more than a murderer.

228
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,158
You must be very brave
to mention his name.

229
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,074
Or very foolish.

230
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,870
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.

231
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,551
And you must be Miss Granger.

232
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,398
Yes, Draco has told me all
about you. And your parents.

233
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,150
Muggles, aren't they?

234
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,869
Let me see. Red hair, vacant expressions

235
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,437
Tatty, secondhand book.

236
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,837
You must be the Weasleys.

237
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,191
It's mad in here. Let's go outside.

238
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,909
Well, well, well.
Weasley senior. Lucius.

239
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,591
Busy time at the Ministry,
Arthur, all those extra raids?

240
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,990
I do hope they' re paying you overtime

241
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,197
But judging by the state
of this, I'd say not.

242
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,515
What's the use in being a
disgrace to the name of wizard

243
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,671
If they don't even pay you well for it?

244
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,750
We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

245
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,718
Clearly.

246
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,269
Associating with Muggles.

247
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,711
And I thought your family
could sink no lower.

248
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,553
I'll see you at work.

249
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,790
See you at school.

250
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,880
10:58, come on. The train
will be leaving any moment.

251
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,191
Fred, George, Percy, you first.

252
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,118
Okay.

253
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,592
After you, dear.

254
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,752
Come on, Ginny, we'll
get you a seat. Hurry.

255
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,991
Let's go.

256
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,397
What do you two think
you're doing? Sorry.

257
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,678
Lost control of the trolley.

258
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,190
Why can't we get through? I don't know.

259
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,591
The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.

260
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,674
The train leaves at exactly
11:00. We've missed it.

261
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,071
Harry, if we can't get through

262
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,920
Maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.

263
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,150
Maybe we should just
go and wait by the car.

264
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,434
The car.

265
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,550
Ron, I should tell you

266
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,349
Most Muggles aren't accustomed
to seeing a flying car.

267
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,555
Right.

268
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,829
Okay.

269
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,591
Oh, no! The lnvisibility
Booster must be faulty.

270
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,032
Come on, then. Let's go lower.
We need to find the train.

271
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,428
Okay.

272
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,876
All we need to do is
catch up with the train.

273
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,632
We can't be far behind.

274
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,154
Do you hear that? We
must be getting close.

275
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,590
Hold on.

276
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,910
Harry!

277
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,192
Hold on!

278
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,789
Take my hand!

279
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,074
Hold on!

280
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,676
I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.

281
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,911
I think we found the train. Yeah.

282
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,114
Welcome home.

283
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,749
Up! Up!

284
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,750
It's not working!

285
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,988
Up! Ron, mind that tree!

286
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,156
Stop! Stop! Stop!

287
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,757
My wand. Look at my wand. Be
thankful it's not your neck.

288
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,198
What's happening? I don't know.

289
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,236
Come on, go! Fast!

290
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,873
Scabbers, you're okay.

291
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,276
The car!

292
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,872
Dad's gonna kill me.

293
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,310
See you, Hedwig.

294
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,830
So a houseelf shows up in my bedroom

295
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,833
We can't get through the
barrier to platform 9 3/4

296
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,117
We almost get killed by a tree....

297
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,670
Clearly someone doesn't
want me here this year.

298
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,953
Well, take a good look, lads.

299
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,874
This night might well be the
last you spend in this castle.

300
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,916
Oh, dear, we are in trouble.

301
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,116
You were seen by no
less than seven Muggles.

302
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,199
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

303
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,555
You have risked the
exposure of our world.

304
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,998
Not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a Whomping Willow

305
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,197
That's been on these grounds
since before you were born.

306
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,030
Honestly, Professor Snape, I
think it did more damage to us.

307
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,315
Silence.

308
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,349
I assure you that were you in
Slytherin, and your fate rested with me

309
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,149
The both of you would be
on the train home tonight.

310
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,430
As it is They are not.

311
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,439
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.

312
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,233
Headmaster

313
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,996
These boys have flouted the Decree for
the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.

314
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,914
As such I am well aware of our bylaws

315
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,833
Having written quite
a few of them myself.

316
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,272
However, as head of Gryffindor house

317
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,230
It is for Professor McGonagall to
determine the appropriate action.

318
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,750
We'll go and get our stuff, then.

319
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,275
What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?

320
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,556
You' re going to expel us, aren't you?

321
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,032
Not today, Mr. Weasley

322
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,990
But I must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done.

323
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,957
I will be writing to your families tonight,
and you will both receive detention.

324
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,709
Morning, everyone.

325
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,794
Good morning, everyone. Good
morning, Professor Sprout.

326
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,078
Welcome to Greenhouse Three, second
years. Gather around, everyone.

327
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,959
T oday we' re going to repot Mandrakes.

328
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,954
Who here can tell me the
properties of the Mandrake root?

329
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,872
Yes, Miss Granger?

330
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,270
Mandrake, or Mandragora

331
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,230
Is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state.

332
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:41,190
It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

333
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,079
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.

334
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,800
As our Mandrakes are
still only seedlings

335
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,791
Their cries won't kill you yet.

336
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,589
But they could knock you out for hours,
which is why I have given you earmuffs

337
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,193
For auditory protection.

338
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,638
So could you please put
them on, right away? Quickly.

339
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,473
Flaps tight down, and watch me closely.

340
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,518
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.

341
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,558
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.

342
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,471
Got it? And

343
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,716
Now you dunk it down into the other pot

344
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,396
And pour a little sprinkling
of soil to keep him warm.

345
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,952
Longbottom's been
neglecting his earmuffs.

346
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,239
No, ma'am, he's just fainted.
Yes, well, just leave him there.

347
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,990
Right, on we go. Plenty
of pots to go around.

348
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,596
Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.

349
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,549
There's Nearly Headless Nick.
Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.

350
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,154
Hello, Sir Nicholas.

351
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,311
Say it. I'm doomed.

352
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,951
You're doomed. Hi, Harry.

353
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,714
I'm Colin Creevey.
I'm in Gryffindor too.

354
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,438
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.

355
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,712
Ron, is that your owl?

356
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,400
Bloody bird's a menace.

357
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,873
Oh, no.

358
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,350
Look, everyone. Weasley's
got himself a Howler.

359
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,788
Go on, Ron. I ignored one from
my gran once. It was horrible.

360
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,477
Ronald Weasley!

361
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,836
How dare you steal that car!
I am absolutely disgusted!

362
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,588
Your father's now
facing an inquiry at work

363
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,035
And it's entirely your fault!

364
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,189
If you put another toe out of line

365
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,477
We 'll bring you straight home!

366
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,596
And, Ginny, dear, congratulations
on making Gryffindor.

367
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,309
Your father and I are so proud.

368
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,995
Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

369
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,639
Me.

370
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,234
Gilderoy Lockhart

371
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,551
Order of Merlin, Third Class

372
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,917
Honorary member of the
Dark Force Defense League

373
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,878
And five times winner

374
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:17,832
Of Witch Weekly's
MostCharmingSmile Award.

375
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,633
But I don't talk about that.

376
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,157
I didn't get rid of the Bandon
Banshee by smiling at him.

377
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,479
Now, be warned.

378
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,716
It is my job to arm you

379
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:38,000
Against the foulest
creatures known to wizardkind.

380
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,236
You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.

381
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,279
Know only that no harm can
befall you whilst I am here.

382
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,238
I must ask you not to scream.

383
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,868
It might provoke them.

384
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,679
Cornish pixies?

385
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,752
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

386
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,556
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan

387
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,713
But pixies can be devilishly
tricky little blighters.

388
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,678
Let's see what you make of them.

389
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,957
Come on now, round them
up. They're only pixies.

390
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,039
You just stay there!
Please, get me down!

391
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,635
Get off me! Stop. Hold still!

392
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,272
Peskipiksi Pesternomi!

393
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,558
I'll ask you three to just nip the
rest of them back into their cage.

394
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,310
What do we do now?

395
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,153
Immobulus!

396
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,430
Why is it always me?

397
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,114
I spent the summer devising
a whole new Quidditch program.

398
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,795
We' re gonna train
earlier, harder and longer.

399
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,111
What? I don't believe it.

400
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,394
Where you think you're going,
Flint? Quidditch practice.

401
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,758
I booked the pitch for Gryffindor
today. Easy, Wood. I've got a note.

402
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,236
I smell trouble.

403
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,190
I, Professor Severus Snape, do
hereby give the Slytherin team

404
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,716
Permission to practice today, owing
to the need to train their new Seeker.

405
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,440
You've got a new Seeker. Who?

406
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,754
Malfoy? That's right.

407
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,593
And that's not all that's new this year.

408
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,676
Those are Nimbus 2001
s. How did you get those?

409
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,831
A gift from Draco's father.

410
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,595
You see, Weasley, unlike some,
my father can afford the best.

411
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,638
At least no one on the Gryffindor
team had to buy their way in.

412
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,598
They got in on pure talent.

413
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,389
No one asked your opinion,
you filthy little Mudblood.

414
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,110
You'll pay for that
one, Malfoy. Eat slugs!

415
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,157
You okay, Ron?

416
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,758
Say something.

417
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,072
Wow! Can you turn him around,
Harry? No, Colin, get out of the way.

418
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,916
Let's take him to Hagrid's.

419
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,116
He'll know what to do.

420
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,871
This calls for a specialist's equipment.

421
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,916
Nothing to do but wait
till it stops, I'm afraid.

422
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,597
Okay. Better out than in.

423
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:40,280
Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
Malfoy. He called Hermione....

424
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,716
Well, I don't know
exactly what it means.

425
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,636
He called me a Mudblood.

426
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,360
He did not. What's a Mudblood?

427
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:58,077
It means ""dirty blood. "" Mudblood's a
foul name for someone who's Muggleborn.

428
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,313
Someone with nonmagic
parents. Someone like me.

429
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,759
It's not a term one usually
hears in civilized conversation.

430
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,476
See, the thing is, Harry, there are
some wizards, like the Malfoy family

431
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,111
Who think they' re better than everyone
else because they' re pureblood.

432
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,838
That's horrible.

433
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,994
It's disgusting.

434
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,516
And it's codswallop
to boot. Dirty blood.

435
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,911
Why, there isn't a wizard alive
today that's not halfblood or less.

436
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:34,437
More to the point, they've yet to think
of a spell that our Hermione can't do.

437
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,716
Come here.

438
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:43,989
Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.

439
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,352
Harry, Harry, Harry.

440
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,670
Can you possibly imagine

441
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,912
A better way to serve detention

442
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,114
Than by helping me
to answer my fan mail?

443
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,633
Not really.

444
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,909
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.

445
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,911
Remember that.

446
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,590
Come.

447
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,796
Come

448
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,753
To me.

449
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,354
What? Sorry?

450
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,397
That voice.

451
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,039
Voice?

452
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,877
Didn't you hear it? What
are you talking about, Harry?

453
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,916
I think you' re getting a bit drowsy.

454
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,993
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.

455
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,511
Spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun.

456
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,714
Spooky.

457
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,676
Blood.

458
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,230
I smell blood.

459
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,358
Let me rip you.

460
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,956
Let me kill you.

461
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,119
Kill!

462
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,274
Kill!

463
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,791
Kill! Harry!

464
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,349
Did you hear it? Hear what?

465
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,796
That voice. Voice? What voice?

466
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,748
I heard it first in Lockhart's
office. And then again just

467
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,031
It's time.

468
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,272
It's moving. I think it's going to kill.

469
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,988
Kill? Harry, wait! Not so fast!

470
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,511
Strange.

471
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,312
I've never seen spiders act
like that. I don't like spiders.

472
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,236
What's that?

473
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,917
The Chamber of Secrets has been
opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware.

474
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,230
It's written in blood.

475
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,110
Oh, no.

476
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,835
It's Filch's cat.

477
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,515
It's Mrs. Norris.

478
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,514
Enemies of the Heir, beware.

479
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,235
You'll be next, Mudbloods.

480
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:14,349
What's going on here? Go
on. Make way, make way.

481
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,512
Potter?

482
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,716
What are you...?

483
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,115
Mrs. Norris?

484
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,553
You've murdered my cat. No. No.

485
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,148
I'll kill you.

486
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,119
I'll kill you! Argus!

487
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,510
Argus, l....

488
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,877
Everyone will proceed to
their dormitories immediately.

489
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,471
Everyone except

490
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,356
You three.

491
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,039
Ravenclaws, follow me.

492
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,549
She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.

493
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,439
Thought so. So unlucky I wasn't there.

494
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,672
I know exactly the countercurse
that could've spared her.

495
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,434
But how she has been
Petrified, I cannot say.

496
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,274
Ask him. It's him that's done it.

497
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,034
You saw what he wrote on the wall.

498
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,113
It's not true, sir. I swear.
I never touched Mrs. Norris.

499
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,558
Rubbish. If I might, headmaster?

500
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,596
Perhaps Potter and his friends were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

501
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,911
However

502
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,073
The circumstances are suspicious.

503
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,677
I, for one, don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.

504
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,990
I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.

505
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,436
You see, Harry was helping
me answer my fan mail.

506
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,751
That's why Ron and l went
looking for him, professor.

507
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,559
We'd just found him when he said....

508
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,395
Yes, Miss Granger? When
I said I wasn't hungry.

509
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,554
We were heading back to the common
room when we found Mrs. Norris.

510
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,113
Innocent until proven guilty,
Severus. My cat has been Petrified.

511
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,517
I want to see some punishment! We
will be able to cure her, Argus.

512
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,996
As I understand it, Madam Sprout has
a very healthy growth of Mandrake.

513
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:29,392
When matured, a potion will be
made which will revive Mrs. Norris.

514
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,358
And in the meantime

515
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,714
I strongly recommend caution

516
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,271
To all.

517
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,150
It's a bit strange, isn't it? Strange?

518
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,959
You hear this voice, a
voice only you can hear

519
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:59,636
And then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. It's just strange.

520
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,917
Do you think I should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, I mean?

521
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,479
Are you mad?

522
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:09,919
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding
world, hearing voices isn't a good sign.

523
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,195
She's right, you know.

524
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,590
Could I have your attention, please?

525
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:26,399
Right. Now, today, we will
be transforming animals

526
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,835
Into water goblets.

527
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,312
Like so.

528
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:36,190
One, two, three. Vera Verto.

529
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,354
Now it's your turn. Who
would like to go first?

530
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,675
Mr. Weasley. "One,
two, three. Vera Verto."

531
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,111
Vera Verto!

532
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,560
That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley.

533
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,910
Yes, Miss Granger? Professor

534
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:10,119
I was wondering if you could tell
us about the Chamber of Secrets.

535
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,234
Very well.

536
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,591
You all know, of course

537
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,469
That Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago

538
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,872
By the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age:

539
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,635
Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff

540
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,193
Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin.

541
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:44,597
Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.

542
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,672
One did not. Three guesses who.

543
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,715
Salazar Slytherin wished
to be more selective

544
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,917
About the students admitted to Hogwarts.

545
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:58,471
He believed magical learning should
be kept within allmagic families.

546
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,676
In other words, purebloods.

547
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,160
Unable to sway the others, he
decided to leave the school.

548
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,110
Now, according to legend

549
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,829
Slytherin had built a
hidden chamber in this castle

550
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,515
Known as the Chamber of Secrets.

551
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,912
Though, shortly before
departing, he sealed it

552
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:25,039
Until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.

553
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,475
The Heir alone

554
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,200
Would be able to open the Chamber

555
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,911
And unleash the horror
within, and by so doing

556
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,311
Purge the school of all those who

557
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,270
In Slytherin's view, were
unworthy to study magic.

558
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,916
Muggleborns.

559
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,390
Naturally, the school has
been searched many times.

560
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,870
No such chamber has been found.

561
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,911
Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?

562
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,188
The Chamber is said
to be home to something

563
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,796
That only the Heir of
Slytherin can control.

564
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,870
It is said to be the home

565
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,598
Of a monster.

566
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,635
Do you think it's true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

567
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,839
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All the teachers are.

568
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,675
If there really is a Chamber of Secrets,
and it has been opened, that means

569
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,628
The Heir of Slytherin has returned to
Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

570
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,998
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggleborns are scum?

571
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,720
If you' re talking about
Malfoy Of course. You heard him.

572
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,518
You'll be next, Mudbloods.

573
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,194
I heard him. But Malfoy,
the Heir of Slytherin?

574
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,397
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
I mean, look at his family.

575
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,233
The whole lot of them have
been in Slytherin for centuries.

576
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,676
Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe
we could trick them into telling.

577
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:58,113
Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.

578
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,032
Mind you, it would be difficult.

579
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,112
Not to mention we'd be
breaking about 50 school rules

580
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,558
And it'll be dangerous. Very dangerous.

581
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,475
Here it is. The Polyjuice Potion.

582
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,234
Properly brewed, the Polyjuice
Potion allows the drinker

583
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,473
To transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another.

584
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,269
You mean if Harry and I drink that
stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

585
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,671
Wicked! Malfoy will tell
us anything. Exactly.

586
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,549
But it's tricky. I've never
seen a more complicated potion.

587
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,678
How long will it take to make? A month.

588
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,439
A month?

589
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,275
But, Hermione, if Malfoy
is the Heir of Slytherin

590
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,512
He could attack half the
Muggleborns in the school by then.

591
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,511
I know.

592
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,399
But it's the only plan we've got.

593
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,634
Another goal for Slytherin!

594
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,151
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.

595
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,793
Yeah!

596
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,758
Yeah!

597
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,230
All right there, Scarhead?

598
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,509
Watch yourself, Harry!

599
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,598
Wood, look out!

600
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,439
Blimey! Harry's got
himself a rogue Bludger.

601
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,272
That's been tampered with, that has.

602
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,269
I'll stop it.

603
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,831
No! Even with a proper wand, it's
too risky. You could hit Harry.

604
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,348
Training for the ballet, Potter?

605
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,196
You'll never catch me, Potter.

606
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,315
Let's go.

607
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:22,474
Harry Potter has caught
the Snitch. Gryffindor wins!

608
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,476
Finite Incantatem!

609
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,554
Thank you. Are you okay?

610
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,711
No. I think my arm is broken.

611
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,509
Not to worry, Harry. I will fix
that arm of yours straightaway.

612
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,513
Not you. Boy doesn't
know what he's saying.

613
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,070
This won't hurt a bit.

614
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,798
Brackium Emendo!

615
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,478
Yes, well, that can sometimes happen

616
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,790
But the point is

617
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:18,079
You can no longer feel any pain, and,
very clearly, the bones are not broken.

618
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,800
Broken? There's no bones left.

619
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,317
Much more flexible, though.

620
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:30,434
Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a
fuss. You can go. Out of my way.

621
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,477
Should have been brought straight to me.

622
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,074
I can mend bones in a heartbeat,
but growing them back....

623
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,673
You will be able to, won't you?

624
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,832
I'll be able to, certainly.
But it'll be painful.

625
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:44,911
You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Regrowing bones is a nasty business.

626
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,598
What do you expect? Pumpkin juice?

627
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,632
Kill.

628
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,919
Kill.

629
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:09,152
Time to kill.

630
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,029
Hello.

631
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,749
Dobby?

632
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,150
Harry Potter should
have listened to Dobby.

633
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,149
Harry Potter should have gone
back home when he missed the train.

634
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:29,757
It was you. You stopped the barrier
from letting Ron and me through.

635
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,873
Indeed. Yes, sir.

636
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:38,675
You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
At least you would be away from here.

637
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,400
Harry Potter must go home.

638
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,996
Dobby thought his Bludger would
be enough to make Harry Potter see

639
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,391
Your Bludger? You made
that Bludger chase after me?

640
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,996
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.

641
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,630
Dobby had to iron his hands.

642
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,151
You better clear off before my bones
come back, or I might strangle you.

643
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,591
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.

644
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,672
Dobby gets them five
times a day at home.

645
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,513
I don't suppose you could tell
me why you' re trying to kill me?

646
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,509
Not kill you, sir. Never kill you.

647
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,877
Dobby remembers how it was
before Harry Potter triumphed

648
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,032
Over HeWhoMustNotBeNamed.

649
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,749
We houseelves were
treated like vermin, sir.

650
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:32,119
Of course, Dobby is
still treated like vermin.

651
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,594
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

652
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:48,675
This, sir? It is a mark of
the houseelf's enslavement.

653
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:53,755
Dobby can only be freed if his
master presents him with clothes.

654
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,119
Listen.

655
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,759
Listen!

656
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,469
Terrible things are about
to happen at Hogwarts.

657
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,435
Harry Potter must not stay here

658
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,957
Now that history is to repeat itself.

659
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:13,430
Repeat itself? You mean
this has happened before?

660
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,511
I shouldn't have said that.

661
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:22,117
Bad Dobby! Bad! Stop it!

662
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,872
Stop it, Dobby!

663
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:29,155
Tell me. When did this happen
before? Who's doing it now?

664
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:34,314
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only
wants Harry Potter to be safe.

665
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,278
No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?

666
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,675
Put him here.

667
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,878
What happened? There's
been another attack.

668
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:02,592
I think he's been
Petrified, Madam Pomfrey.

669
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:07,876
Look. Perhaps he managed to
take a picture of his attacker.

670
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,279
What can this mean, Albus?

671
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,317
It means

672
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,319
That our students are in great danger.

673
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,756
What should I tell the staff? The truth.

674
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,629
Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe.

675
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,793
It is as we feared, Minerva.

676
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:38,397
The Chamber of Secrets has
indeed been opened again.

677
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:45,079
Again? You mean the Chamber of
Secrets has been opened before?

678
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,879
Of course. Don't you see?

679
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,918
Lucius Malfoy must have opened
it when he was at school here.

680
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,988
Now he's taught Draco
how to do it. Maybe.

681
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,197
We'll have to wait for the
Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.

682
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:01,148
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing
this potion in broad daylight

683
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:05,108
In the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Don't you think we'll get caught?

684
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,520
No. No one ever comes in here.

685
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,754
Why? Moaning Myrtle.

686
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,797
Who?

687
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,872
Moaning Myrtle.

688
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,357
Who's Moaning Myrtle?
I'm Moaning Myrtle.

689
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,315
I wouldn't expect you to know me.

690
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,392
Who would ever talk
about ugly, miserable

691
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,791
Moping Moaning Myrtle?

692
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,756
She's a little sensitive.

693
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,957
Gather round!

694
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:54,070
Gather round. Can everybody see me?

695
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,232
Can you all hear me?

696
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,154
Excellent.

697
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:03,189
In light of the dark
events of recent weeks

698
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:07,831
Professor Dumbledore has granted me
permission to start this Dueling Club

699
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,471
To train you all up in case you
ever need to defend yourselves

700
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,154
As I myself have done
on countless occasions.

701
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:18,875
For full details, see
my published works.

702
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,392
Let me introduce my assistant

703
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,074
Professor Snape.

704
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,953
He has sportingly agreed to
help with a short demonstration.

705
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,076
I don't want any of
you youngsters to worry.

706
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:41,950
You'll still have your Potions master
when I'm through with him. Never fear.

707
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,518
One.

708
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:59,669
Two.

709
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,352
Three! Expelliarmus!

710
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,160
Do you think he's all right? Who cares?

711
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:17,153
An excellent idea to show
them that, Professor Snape

712
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:21,677
But if you don't mind me saying, it
was obvious what you were about to do.

713
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,957
If I had wanted to stop you, it
would have been only too easy.

714
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:28,430
Perhaps it would be prudent
to first teach the students

715
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,912
To block unfriendly spells, professor.

716
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,909
An excellent suggestion,
Professor Snape.

717
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:42,193
Let's have a volunteer pair.
Potter, Weasley, how about you?

718
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,716
Weasley's wand causes devastation
with the simplest spells.

719
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:49,669
We'll be sending Potter to the
hospital wing in a matchbox.

720
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:53,753
Might I suggest someone
from my own house?

721
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,349
Malfoy, perhaps?

722
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,949
Good luck, Potter. Thank you, sir.

723
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,511
Wands at the ready.

724
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,958
Scared, Potter? You wish.

725
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,598
On the count of three

726
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,912
Cast your charms to disarm
your opponent. Only to disarm.

727
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:39,470
We don't want any accidents here. One.

728
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,634
Two. Everte Statum!

729
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,950
Rictusempra!

730
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,198
I said disarm only.

731
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,271
Serpensortia!

732
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,273
Don't move, Potter. I'll
get rid of it for you.

733
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:27,639
Allow me, Professor
Snape. Alarte Ascendare!

734
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,240
Vipera Evanesca.

735
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,955
What are you playing at?

736
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,794
You' re a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?

737
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,110
I'm a what? You can talk to snakes.

738
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:42,400
I know. I accidentally set a python
on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.

739
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:46,348
Once. But so what? I bet
loads of people here can do it.

740
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:50,115
No, they can't. It's not
a very common gift, Harry.

741
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,238
This is bad.

742
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,995
What's bad? If I hadn't told
that snake not to attack Justin

743
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:59,470
That's what you said to it.
You were there. You heard me.

744
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:03,349
I heard you speaking
Parseltongue. Snake language.

745
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,273
I spoke a different language?

746
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,595
But I didn't realize

747
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,433
How can I speak a language
without knowing I can?

748
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:16,434
I don't know, but it sounded like you
were egging the snake on or something.

749
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,238
Harry, listen to me.

750
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,393
There's a reason the symbol of
Slytherin house is a serpent.

751
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:25,872
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
He could talk to snakes too.

752
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,109
Exactly.

753
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,511
Now the whole school's gonna think
you're his greatgreatgreat grandson.

754
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,591
But I'm not.

755
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,077
I can't be.

756
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,116
He lived a thousand years ago.

757
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:43,352
For all we know, you could be.

758
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,515
I'll see you back in the common room.

759
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:34,358
I want blood.

760
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:41,910
They all must die.

761
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,391
Kill.

762
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,031
Kill.

763
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,995
Kill.

764
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:54,199
Time to kill.

765
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,831
Caught in the act.

766
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,877
I'll have you out this time, Potter.

767
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,749
Mark my words.

768
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,993
No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand

769
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,517
Professor

770
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:06,999
I swear I didn't.

771
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,272
This is out of my hands, Potter.

772
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,080
Professor Dumbledore
will be waiting for you.

773
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,108
Sherbet Lemon.

774
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,716
Professor Dumbledore?

775
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,114
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?

776
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:33,237
I was just wondering if you
put me in the right house.

777
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:38,633
Yes. You were particularly
difficult to place.

778
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,190
But I stand by what I said last year.

779
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:45,591
You would have done well in Slytherin.

780
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,034
You're wrong.

781
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,473
Harry?

782
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,990
Professor.

783
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:22,789
Your bird.... There
was nothing I could do.

784
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:26,557
He just caught fire. And about time too.

785
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,590
He's been looking dreadful for days.

786
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,671
Pity you had to see
him on a burning day.

787
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,637
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.

788
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,997
They burst into flame when
it is time for them to die

789
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,196
And then they are

790
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:45,272
Reborn from the ashes.

791
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:55,834
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.

792
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:59,989
They can carry immensely heavy loads.

793
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,879
Their tears have healing powers.

794
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:08,312
Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen!

795
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,316
Professor Dumbledore,
sir, it wasn't Harry.

796
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:15,193
I'd be prepared to swear it in
front of the Ministry of Magic.

797
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,397
Relax.

798
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,997
I do not believe

799
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:24,516
That Harry attacked
anyone. Of course you don't.

800
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,588
Right. Well, I'll....

801
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:33,752
I'll just wait outside, then. Yes.

802
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:40,795
You don't think it was
me, professor? No, Harry.

803
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,349
I do not think it was you.

804
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,078
But I must ask you

805
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,553
Is there something you wish to tell me?

806
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:58,591
No, sir.

807
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,193
Nothing.

808
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,150
Very well, then.

809
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:07,038
Off you go.

810
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:46,830
Everything's set. We just need a
bit of who you're changing into.

811
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,638
Crabbe and Goyle.

812
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,473
We also need to make sure
that the real Crabbe and Goyle

813
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,712
Can't burst in on us while
we're interrogating Malfoy.

814
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:57,634
How? I've got it all worked out.

815
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,268
I filled these with a
simple Sleeping Draught.

816
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:03,079
Simple, but powerful.

817
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,350
Now, once they' re asleep

818
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,592
Hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs

819
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,557
And put on their uniforms.

820
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,871
Whose hair are you ripping out,
then? I've already got mine.

821
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:17,077
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.

822
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,310
I got this off her robes.

823
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,994
I'm going to go check
on the Polyjuice Potion.

824
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:24,754
Make sure that Crabbe
and Goyle find these.

825
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,675
Ron, maybe I should do it.

826
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,796
Yeah. Right.

827
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,672
Wingardium Leviosa.

828
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,958
Cool.

829
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,912
How thick could you get?

830
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,957
Come on, let's get them.

831
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:28,354
We'll have exactly one hour before
we change back into ourselves.

832
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,077
Add the hairs.

833
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,112
Essence of Crabbe.

834
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,077
Cheers.

835
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,749
I think I'm gonna be sick.

836
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:01,312
Me too.

837
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,032
Harry?

838
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:47,959
Ron.

839
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,750
Bloody hell!

840
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,715
We still sound like ourselves.

841
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,552
You need to sound more like Crabbe.

842
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,875
Bloody hell. Excellent.

843
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,589
But where's Hermione? L....

844
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,638
I don't think I'm going.
You go on without me.

845
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,438
Hermione, are you okay?

846
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,319
Just go. You're wasting time.

847
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,912
Come on.

848
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:19,477
I think the Slytherin
common room's this way.

849
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,715
Excuse me.

850
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,271
What are you doing d?

851
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,431
I mean, what are you doing down here?

852
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,874
I happen to be a school prefect.

853
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:39,318
You, on the other hand, have no business
wandering the corridors at night.

854
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,632
What are your names again?

855
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:45,634
I'm.... Crabbe, Goyle,
where have you been?

856
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,712
Pigging out in the
Great Hall all this time?

857
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,355
Why are you wearing glasses?

858
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,879
Reading. Reading?

859
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,195
I didn't know you could read.

860
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,951
And what are you doing
down here, Weasley?

861
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:06,076
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.

862
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,431
Well, sit down.

863
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,795
You'd never know the Weasleys were
purebloods, the way they behave.

864
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,675
They' re an embarrassment to
the wizarding world. All of them.

865
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,675
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?

866
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,472
Stomachache.

867
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:40,030
I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't
done a report on all these attacks.

868
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,555
I suppose Dumbledore is
trying to hush it all up.

869
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:45,115
Father always said
Dumbledore was the worst thing

870
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,909
That ever happened to
this place. You' re wrong!

871
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,235
What?

872
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:00,915
You think there's someone here
who's worse than Dumbledore?

873
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,389
Well? Do you?

874
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,717
Harry Potter?

875
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,353
Good one, Goyle.

876
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:14,999
You' re absolutely right.

877
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,392
Saint Potter.

878
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:21,033
And people actually think that
he's the Heir of Slytherin?

879
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:27,154
But then you must have some
idea who's behind it all.

880
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:30,835
You know I don't, Goyle.
I told you yesterday.

881
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,189
How many times do I have to tell you?

882
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,912
Is this yours?

883
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,475
But my father did say this:

884
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:46,638
It's been 50 years since
the Chamber was opened.

885
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,998
He wouldn't tell me who opened
it. Only that they were expelled.

886
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:55,751
The last time the Chamber of
Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died.

887
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:00,038
So it's only a matter of time before
one of them is killed this time.

888
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,352
As for me

889
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,590
I hope it's Granger.

890
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,876
What's the matter with you two?

891
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,429
You' re acting very odd.

892
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,716
It's his stomachache.

893
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,871
Calm down.

894
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:19,791
Scar.

895
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:24,593
Hair.

896
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,795
Hey! Where are you going?

897
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:36,908
That was close.

898
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:39,389
Hermione, come out. We've
got loads to tell you.

899
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,357
Go away.

900
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:45,549
Wait till you see. It's awful.

901
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,112
Hermione?

902
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,838
Are you okay?

903
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,518
Do you remember me telling you

904
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:57,717
That the Polyjuice Potion was
only for human transformations?

905
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:01,839
It was cat hair I plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes.

906
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,599
Look at my face.

907
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:09,035
Look at your tail.

908
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,719
Have you spoken to Hermione?

909
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,314
She should be out of
hospital in a few days

910
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:22,199
When she stops coughing up fur balls.

911
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,432
What's this?

912
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:33,875
Yuck!

913
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,713
Looks like Moaning Myrtle's
flooded the bathroom.

914
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:56,239
Come to throw something else at me?
Why would I throw something at you?

915
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:00,553
Don't ask me. Here I am,
minding my own business

916
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:04,190
And someone thinks it's
funny to throw a book at me.

917
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:07,153
But it can't hurt if someone
throws something at you.

918
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:09,629
I mean, it'll just go right through you.

919
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:14,838
Sure! Let's all throw books at
Myrtle because she can't feel it.

920
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,514
Ten points if you get
it through her stomach!

921
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:21,036
Fifty points if it
goes through her head!

922
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:25,752
But who threw it at you, anyway?
I don't know. I didn't see them.

923
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:30,153
I was just sitting in the
Ubend, thinking about death

924
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:33,875
And it fell through the top of my head.

925
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,189
Tom Marvolo Riddle.

926
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,070
My name

927
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:39,038
Is Harry

928
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,636
Potter.

929
01:24:55,320 --> 01:25:00,269
Do you know anything

930
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:07,474
About the Chamber of Secrets?

931
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,031
Can you

932
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,435
Tell me?

933
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:25,436
Excuse me. Could you tell
me what's going on here?

934
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:30,990
Are you T om Riddle?

935
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:32,878
Hello, can you hear me?

936
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,272
Riddle!

937
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,319
Come.

938
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,391
Professor Dumbledore.

939
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,550
Dumbledore?

940
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:07,156
It is not wise to be wandering
around this late hour, T om.

941
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:10,517
Yes, professor. I suppose l....

942
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:12,750
I had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.

943
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:16,118
I'm afraid they are,
T om. They are true.

944
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:18,999
About the school as well? I
don't have a home to go to.

945
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:21,879
They wouldn't really close
Hogwarts, would they, professor?

946
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:24,474
I understand, T om, but I'm afraid

947
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,038
Headmaster Dippet may have no choice.

948
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:32,512
Sir, if it all stopped, if the
person responsible was caught....

949
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:36,716
Is there something

950
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,511
You wish to tell me?

951
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:43,114
No, sir. Nothing.

952
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,512
Very well, then. Off you go.

953
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:54,477
Good night, sir.

954
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,918
Let's get you out of
there. Evening, Hagrid.

955
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:36,392
I'm going to have to turn you in. I don't
think you meant it to kill anyone....

956
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,755
You can't. You don't understand.

957
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,952
The dead girl's parents will be here
tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do

958
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:44,918
Is make sure the thing that killed
their daughter is slaughtered.

959
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:48,152
It wasn't him. Aragog
never killed no one. Never.

960
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,550
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.

961
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:52,278
Now, stand aside. No!

962
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,317
Stand aside, Hagrid. No!

963
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,038
Cistem Aperio!

964
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,950
Arania Exumai!

965
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,199
Aragog!

966
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,554
Aragog!

967
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:10,399
I can't let you go.

968
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:14,071
They'll have your wand for
this, Hagrid. You'll be expelled.

969
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,317
Hagrid!

970
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:51,079
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the
Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.

971
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:54,073
It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.

972
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:58,153
We don't even know this T om Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch.

973
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:01,676
The monster had killed somebody,
Ron. What would any of us have done?

974
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:05,748
Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't
we just go and ask him about it?

975
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:08,520
That would be a cheerful
visit. Hello, Hagrid.

976
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:12,355
Tell us, have you been setting anything
mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?

977
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:15,592
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be
talking about me, now, would you?

978
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:16,869
No.

979
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,758
What's that you've got, Hagrid?

980
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:27,557
It's FleshEating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes, you know.

981
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:31,235
Now, according to Professor Sprout,
they've still got a bit of growing to do.

982
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:34,756
But once their acne's cleared up,
we'll chop them up and stew them

983
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:38,071
And then we'll get those people
down at the hospital unPetrified.

984
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:42,233
In the meantime, though, you three

985
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,437
Had best be looking after
yourselves. All right?

986
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,831
Hello, Neville.

987
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:58,269
Harry, I don't know who did
it, but you'd better come.

988
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:00,278
Come on!

989
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:25,754
It had to be a Gryffindor.
Nobody else knows our password.

990
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:28,070
Unless it wasn't a student.

991
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:31,516
Whoever it was, they must have
been looking for something.

992
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:33,033
And they found it.

993
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:36,149
T om Riddle's diary is gone.

994
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:38,908
All right, listen up.

995
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:41,878
We play our game, Hufflepuff
doesn't stand a chance.

996
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:43,837
We're stronger, quicker and smarter.

997
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,878
Not to mention they're dead
scared that Harry will Petrify them

998
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:50,396
If they fly anywhere
near him. Well, that too.

999
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:53,039
Professor McGonagall.

1000
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:56,112
This match has been canceled.
We can't cancel Quidditch.

1001
01:31:56,280 --> 01:32:01,035
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates
will go to Gryffindor T ower. Now.

1002
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,760
Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley.

1003
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:06,554
There's something the
both of you have to see.

1004
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:11,996
I warn you. This could
be a wee bit of a shock.

1005
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,189
Hermione!

1006
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,078
She was found near the library

1007
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:26,236
Along with this.

1008
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:30,359
Does it mean anything to either of you?

1009
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:31,919
No.

1010
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,790
Could I have your attention, please?

1011
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:53,353
Because of recent events, these new
rules will be put into effect immediately:

1012
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:58,595
All students will return to their house
common rooms by 6:00 every evening.

1013
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:02,673
All students will be escorted
to each lesson by a teacher.

1014
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:05,718
No exceptions.

1015
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:08,316
I should tell you this:

1016
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:12,439
Unless the culprit behind
these attacks is caught

1017
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,997
It is likely the school will be closed.

1018
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:29,873
We've got to talk to Hagrid,
Ron. I can't believe it's him

1019
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,235
But if he did set the
monster loose last time

1020
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:35,437
He'll know how to get inside the
Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.

1021
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:36,794
But you heard McGonagall.

1022
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:40,111
We're not allowed to leave
the tower except for class.

1023
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,915
I think it's time to get my
dad's old cloak out again.

1024
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,638
Who's there?

1025
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:02,793
Hello?

1026
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:04,879
Hello?

1027
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,118
What's that for? Nothing.
I was expecting....

1028
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:13,989
It doesn't matter. Come on
in. I just made a pot of tea.

1029
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:18,835
Hagrid, are you okay?

1030
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,753
I'm fine. I'm all right.

1031
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:24,318
Did you hear about Hermione?

1032
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:28,315
Yeah. I heard about that, all right.

1033
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:32,155
Look, we have to ask you something.

1034
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:37,116
Do you know who's opened
the Chamber of Secrets?

1035
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,555
What you had to understand about that is

1036
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:44,673
Quick, under the cloak.

1037
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:48,278
Don't say a word. Be quiet, both of you.

1038
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:57,398
Professor Dumbledore,
sir. Good evening, Hagrid.

1039
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,869
I wonder, could we...?

1040
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:02,429
Of course. Come in. Come in.

1041
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:03,919
That's Dad's boss.

1042
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:07,516
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.

1043
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:11,878
Bad business, Hagrid, very
bad business. Had to come.

1044
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:15,157
Three attacks on Muggleborns.
Things have gone far enough.

1045
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:18,392
The Ministry's got to act. But I never

1046
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:20,318
You know I never, professor.

1047
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:23,438
I want it understood, Cornelius

1048
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,352
That Hagrid

1049
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,715
Has my full confidence.

1050
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:31,509
Albus, look, Hagrid's
record is against him.

1051
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:34,114
I've got to take him. Take me?

1052
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:36,475
Take me where? Not Azkaban prison.

1053
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:40,355
I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.

1054
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:42,791
Already here, Fudge?

1055
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,234
Good.

1056
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:47,759
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!

1057
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:49,879
Believe me

1058
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:54,199
I take absolutely no
pleasure being inside your....

1059
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,116
You call this a house?

1060
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:00,149
No.

1061
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:04,029
I simply called up the school and
was told the headmaster was here.

1062
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:08,113
Well, what exactly is
it that you want with me?

1063
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:13,191
The other governors and I have decided
it's time for you to step aside.

1064
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:17,558
This is an order of suspension.

1065
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:26,111
You'll find all 1 2 signatures on it.

1066
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:33,879
I'm afraid we feel you've
rather lost your touch.

1067
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,790
Well, what, with all these attacks

1068
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,633
There'll be no Muggleborns
left at Hogwarts.

1069
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:44,157
I can only imagine what an awful
loss that would be to the school.

1070
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,436
You can't take Professor
Dumbledore away.

1071
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:49,154
T ake him away and the
Muggleborns won't stand a chance.

1072
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:51,675
You mark my words,
there'll be killings next!

1073
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,432
You think so?

1074
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,989
Calm yourself, Hagrid.

1075
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,919
If the governors desire my removal

1076
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:03,629
I will, of course, step aside.

1077
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:07,310
However

1078
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:12,317
You will find that help will
always be given at Hogwarts

1079
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,277
To those who

1080
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:16,670
Ask for it.

1081
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,430
Admirable sentiments.

1082
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,352
Shall we?

1083
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,439
Fudge.

1084
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:43,832
Come, Hagrid.

1085
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:46,399
Well?

1086
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,075
If....

1087
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:50,914
If anybody was looking for some stuff

1088
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:55,756
Then all they'd have to do
would be to follow the spiders.

1089
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:58,388
Yep. That would lead them right.

1090
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,437
That's all I have to say.

1091
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:05,675
And someone will need to
feed Fang while I'm away.

1092
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:10,831
Good boy.

1093
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:18,756
Hagrid's right.

1094
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:21,753
With Dumbledore gone,
there'll be an attack a day.

1095
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:23,512
Look.

1096
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:31,038
Come on.

1097
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:36,556
Come on, Fang.

1098
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,399
Come on.

1099
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:56,788
What?

1100
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:00,077
You heard what Hagrid
said. "Follow the spiders."

1101
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:02,794
They're heading to the Dark Forest.

1102
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:09,038
Why spiders? Why couldn't it
be "follow the butterflies"?

1103
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:45,959
Harry, I don't like this.

1104
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:53,952
Harry, I don't like this at all. Shush!

1105
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,434
Can we go back now?

1106
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,272
Come on.

1107
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,599
Who is it?

1108
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:01,309
Don't panic.

1109
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:03,073
Hagrid?

1110
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:04,993
Is that you?

1111
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,391
We' re friends of Hagrid's.

1112
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:27,832
And you? You're Aragog, aren't you?

1113
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:29,668
Yes.

1114
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:33,469
Hagrid has never sent men
into our hollow before.

1115
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:36,632
He's in trouble. Up at the
school, there have been attacks.

1116
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:38,992
They think it's Hagrid.

1117
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:42,630
They think he opened the
Chamber of Secrets. Like before.

1118
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:45,070
That's a lie.

1119
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:48,318
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1120
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:51,673
Then you're not the monster? No.

1121
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,752
The monster was born in the castle.

1122
01:41:54,960 --> 01:42:00,034
I came to Hagrid from a distant
land in the pocket of a traveler.

1123
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:02,198
Harry.

1124
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:08,431
But if you' re not the monster, then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago?

1125
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:11,478
We do not speak of it.

1126
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:17,113
It is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others.

1127
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:18,998
But have you seen it?

1128
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:25,237
I never saw any part of the castle
but the box in which Hagrid kept me.

1129
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:28,437
The girl was discovered in a bathroom.

1130
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:32,912
When I was accused,
Hagrid brought me here.

1131
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:34,991
Harry! What?

1132
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:50,198
Well, thank you.

1133
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:53,190
We'll just go.

1134
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:55,312
Go?

1135
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:57,238
I think not.

1136
01:42:57,400 --> 01:43:02,633
My sons and daughters do not
harm Hagrid on my command.

1137
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,109
But I cannot deny them fresh meat

1138
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:09,432
When it wanders so
willingly into our midst.

1139
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:13,229
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.

1140
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:15,152
Can we panic now?

1141
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,271
Know any spells?

1142
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:30,477
One, but it's not powerful
enough for all of them.

1143
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:33,279
Where's Hermione when you need her?

1144
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:47,468
Let's go!

1145
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:54,391
Arania Exumai!

1146
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:00,754
Go!

1147
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,991
Glad we' re out of there.

1148
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:28,910
Arania Exumai!

1149
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:37,995
Thanks for that. Don't mention it.

1150
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:50,550
Get us out of here.

1151
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:52,632
Now!

1152
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:58,713
Come on! Come on, move faster!

1153
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:02,554
Come on! Go!

1154
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,316
Get us in the air.

1155
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:23,759
The flying gear's jammed!

1156
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:31,309
Come on! Pull! I'm trying!

1157
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:02,238
Follow the spiders. Follow the spiders.

1158
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:06,552
If Hagrid ever gets out
of Azkaban, I'll kill him.

1159
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,072
I mean, what was the point
of sending us in there?

1160
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:27,677
What have we found
out? We know one thing.

1161
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:31,071
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1162
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:33,191
He was innocent.

1163
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:50,395
Wish you were here, Hermione.

1164
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:53,115
We need you.

1165
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,991
Now more than ever.

1166
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:15,516
What's that? Ron....

1167
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:20,598
This is why Hermione was in the
library the day she was attacked.

1168
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:22,314
Come on.

1169
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:25,793
Of the many fearsome
beasts that roam our land

1170
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:30,397
None is more deadly than the basilisk.
Capable of living for hundreds of years

1171
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:34,189
Instant death awaits any who
meet this giant serpent's eye.

1172
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:37,238
Spiders flee before it. Ron, this is it.

1173
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:40,073
The monster in the Chamber
of Secrets is a basilisk.

1174
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:43,994
That's why I can hear
it speak. It's a snake.

1175
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:49,394
But if it kills by looking people
in the eye, why is it no one's dead?

1176
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:02,398
Because no one did look it in the eye.

1177
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:06,748
Not directly, at least.

1178
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:10,076
Colin saw it through his camera.

1179
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:14,119
Justin Justin must have seen the
basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.

1180
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:18,114
Nick got the full blast of it. But
he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.

1181
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:21,272
And Hermione had the mirror.

1182
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:24,671
I bet you she was using it to look
around corners in case it came along.

1183
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:26,068
And Mrs. Norris?

1184
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:29,596
I'm pretty sure she didn't have
a camera or a mirror, Harry.

1185
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:32,877
The water.

1186
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:38,678
There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk's reflection.

1187
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:46,391
Spiders flee before it.

1188
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:50,155
Lt all fits. How's a
basilisk been getting around?

1189
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:53,039
A dirty, great snake.
Someone would have seen it.

1190
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:58,638
Hermione's answered that too.
Pipes? It's using the plumbing.

1191
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:02,873
Remember what Aragog said
about that girl 50 years ago?

1192
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:07,113
She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?

1193
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,034
Moaning Myrtle.

1194
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:13,839
All students are to return to
their house dormitories at once.

1195
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,276
All teachers to the secondfloor
corridor immediately.

1196
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:27,677
As you can see, the Heir of
Slytherin has left another message.

1197
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:29,956
Our worst fear has been realized.

1198
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:34,511
A student has been taken by the
monster into the Chamber itself.

1199
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:40,958
The students must be sent home. I'
m afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.

1200
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:45,595
So sorry. Dozed off. What have I missed?

1201
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:49,912
A girl has been snatched by the monster,
Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.

1202
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:52,913
My moment? Weren't you
saying just last night

1203
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:57,437
That you've known all along where the
entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?

1204
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:03,999
That's settled. We'll leave you
to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.

1205
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:09,109
Your skills, after all,
are legend. Very well.

1206
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:12,352
I'll just be in my office getting....

1207
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:15,037
Getting ready.

1208
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:20,912
Who is it that the
monster's taken, Minerva?

1209
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:22,832
Ginny Weasley.

1210
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:36,718
Her skeleton will lie
in the Chamber forever

1211
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:42,318
Ginny.

1212
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:47,676
Lockhart may be useless, but he's
going to try and get into the Chamber.

1213
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:50,434
At least we can tell him what we know.

1214
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:54,188
Professor, we have some
information for you.

1215
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:57,757
Are you going somewhere?

1216
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:00,912
Well, yes. Urgent call.
Unavoidable. Got to go.

1217
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:04,152
What about my sister? Well....

1218
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:07,836
As to that, most unfortunate.
No one regrets more than l.

1219
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,834
You' re the Defense Against the
Dark Arts teacher. You can't go now.

1220
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,878
I must say, when I took the job,
there was nothing in the description

1221
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:16,155
You' re running away?

1222
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:18,993
After all you did in your
books? Books can be misleading.

1223
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:21,594
You wrote them. My dear
boy, use your common sense.

1224
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:25,992
My books wouldn't have sold as well if
people didn't think I'd done those things.

1225
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,073
You're a fraud.

1226
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:30,913
You've been taking credit for
what other wizards have done.

1227
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:32,957
Is there anything you can do?

1228
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:37,636
Yes, now you mention it. I'm
rather gifted with Memory Charms.

1229
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:40,189
Otherwise, all those wizards
would have gone blabbing.

1230
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:43,352
I'd never have sold another book.

1231
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:48,992
In fact, I'm going to
have to do the same to you.

1232
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:52,153
Don't even think about it.

1233
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:03,959
Who's there?

1234
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:08,236
Hello, Harry.

1235
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:14,069
What do you want? T o
ask you how you died.

1236
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:18,715
It was dreadful.

1237
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:22,395
It happened right here
in this very cubicle.

1238
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:26,439
I'd hidden because Olive Hornby
was teasing me about my glasses.

1239
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:31,310
I was crying, and then
I heard somebody come in.

1240
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:37,555
Who was it, Myrtle? I don't
know. I was distraught!

1241
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:42,076
But they said something funny,
a kind of madeup language.

1242
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:48,315
And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked
the door to tell him to go away and

1243
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:54,070
I died. Just like that? How?

1244
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:58,552
I just remember seeing a pair
of great, big, yellow eyes

1245
01:52:58,720 --> 01:53:02,395
Over there by that sink.

1246
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:28,436
This is it.

1247
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:33,910
This is it, Ron. I think this is the
entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.

1248
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:40,470
Say something. Harry, say
something in Parseltongue.

1249
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:33,833
Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Well, then, I'll just be....

1250
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,150
There's no need for me to stay.

1251
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:38,557
Yes, there is.

1252
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:43,278
You first. Now, boys,
what good will it do?

1253
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:44,714
Better you than us.

1254
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:48,678
But Obviously, yes.

1255
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:55,394
Sure you don't want to test it first?

1256
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:05,037
It's really quite filthy down here.

1257
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:09,837
All right. Let's go. Oh, Harry?

1258
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:14,950
If you die down there, you'
re welcome to share my toilet.

1259
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:19,277
Thanks, Myrtle.

1260
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:52,149
Now, remember: Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straightaway.

1261
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:54,672
Go on.

1262
01:55:58,240 --> 01:55:59,514
This way.

1263
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:11,268
What's this? Lt looks like a snake.

1264
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:14,955
It's a snakeskin. Bloody hell.

1265
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:20,672
Whatever shed this must
be 60 feet long. Or more.

1266
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:25,353
Heart of a lion, this one.

1267
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:33,391
The adventure ends here,
boys. But don't fret.

1268
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:40,473
The world will know our story. How
I was too late to save the girl.

1269
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:44,156
How you two tragically lost your minds

1270
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:47,198
At the sight of her mangled body.

1271
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,399
So....

1272
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:52,710
You first, Mr. Potter.

1273
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:55,997
Say goodbye to your memories.

1274
01:56:57,960 --> 01:56:59,837
Obliviate!

1275
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:35,352
Ron! Ron, are you okay? I'm fine.

1276
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:40,632
Hello.

1277
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:43,032
Who are you?

1278
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:46,920
Ron Weasley. Really?

1279
01:57:47,080 --> 01:57:49,833
And who am l?

1280
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:55,672
Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
He hasn't got a clue who he is.

1281
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:00,312
It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?

1282
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:02,516
Do you live here?

1283
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:05,589
No. Really?

1284
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,718
What do I do now? You wait here

1285
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:14,713
And try and shift some of this
rock so we can get back through.

1286
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:18,395
I'll go on and find Ginny. Okay.

1287
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:51,509
Ginny! Ginny, please don't
be dead. Wake up, wake up.

1288
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,991
Please wake up.

1289
01:59:54,240 --> 01:59:56,310
She won't wake.

1290
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:05,712
Tom. Tom Riddle. What do
you mean, she won't wake?

1291
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:09,111
She's not...? She's still
alive, but only just.

1292
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:12,275
Are you a ghost? A memory

1293
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:14,715
Preserved in a diary for 50 years.

1294
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:22,274
She's cold as ice. Ginny,
please don't be dead. Wake up.

1295
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:24,749
You've got to help me,
T om. There's a basilisk.

1296
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:27,388
It won't come until it's called.

1297
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:32,799
Give me my wand, Tom.
You won't be needing it.

1298
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:37,076
We've got to go. We've got to save
her. I'm afraid I can't do that.

1299
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:41,119
You see, as poor Ginny grows
weaker, I grow stronger.

1300
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:46,712
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

1301
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:49,110
No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.

1302
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:52,352
It was Ginny who set the basilisk
on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat

1303
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:54,875
Ginny who wrote the threatening
messages on the walls.

1304
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:58,191
But why? Because I told her to.

1305
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:03,115
You'll find I can be very persuasive.
Not that she knew what she was doing.

1306
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:06,477
She was, shall we say,
in a kind of trance.

1307
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,389
Still, the power of the
diary began to scare her.

1308
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:11,835
She tried to dispose of
it in the girls' bathroom.

1309
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:16,152
And then who should find it but you?

1310
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:19,312
The very person I was
most anxious to meet.

1311
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:21,871
And why did you want to meet me?

1312
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:25,471
I knew I had to talk to
you, meet you if I could.

1313
02:01:25,640 --> 02:01:28,791
So I decided to show you my
capture of that brainless oaf Hagrid

1314
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:31,997
To gain your trust. Hagrid's my friend.

1315
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:37,271
And you framed him, didn't you?
Lt was my word against Hagrid's.

1316
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:40,591
Only Dumbledore seemed
to think he was innocent.

1317
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:42,830
I'll bet Dumbledore
saw right through you.

1318
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:46,310
He certainly kept an annoyingly
close watch on me after that.

1319
02:01:46,480 --> 02:01:49,631
I knew it wouldn't be safe to open
the Chamber again while I was at school

1320
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:51,552
So I decided to leave behind a diary

1321
02:01:51,720 --> 02:01:53,756
Preserving my 1 6yearold
self in its pages

1322
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:56,480
So that one day I would
be able to lead another

1323
02:01:56,640 --> 02:01:59,359
To finish Salazar
Slytherin's noble work.

1324
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:01,670
Well, you haven't finished it this time.

1325
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:04,673
In a few hours, the Mandrake
Draught will be ready.

1326
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:07,479
And everyone who was Petrified
will be all right again.

1327
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:12,868
Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods
doesn't matter to me anymore.

1328
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:17,716
For many months now, my
new target has been you.

1329
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:22,556
How is it that a baby with no
extraordinary magical talent

1330
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:25,280
Was able to defeat the
greatest wizard of all time?

1331
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:28,433
How did you escape
with nothing but a scar

1332
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:30,875
While Lord Voldemort's
powers were destroyed?

1333
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:35,033
Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.

1334
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:41,435
Voldemort is my past,
present and future.

1335
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:04,310
You. You' re the Heir of Slytherin.

1336
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:10,796
You' re Voldemort.
Surely you didn't think

1337
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:15,272
I was going to keep my
filthy Muggle father's name?

1338
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:19,433
No. I fashioned myself a new name,
a name I knew wizards everywhere

1339
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:23,639
Would fear to speak when I became
the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1340
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:26,837
Albus Dumbledore is the
greatest sorcerer in the world.

1341
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,231
Dumbledore's been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of me.

1342
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:35,275
He'll never be gone. Not as long as
those who remain are loyal to him.

1343
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:42,389
Fawkes?

1344
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:01,436
So this is what Dumbledore
sends his great defender.

1345
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:05,115
A songbird and an old hat.

1346
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:22,237
Let's match the power of Lord
Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin

1347
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:26,234
Against the famous Harry Potter.

1348
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:43,192
Parseltongue won't save you
now, Potter. It only obeys me.

1349
02:05:12,160 --> 02:05:13,639
No!

1350
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:18,392
Your bird may have blinded the
basilisk, but it can still hear you.

1351
02:06:56,200 --> 02:06:59,351
Yes, Potter. The process
is nearly complete.

1352
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:04,230
In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead, and I will cease to be a memory.

1353
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:06,960
Lord Voldemort will return

1354
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:11,359
Very much alive.

1355
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:13,393
Ginny?

1356
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:25,673
Remarkable, isn't it

1357
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:29,674
How quickly the venom of the
basilisk penetrates the body?

1358
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:32,400
I'd guess you have little
more than a minute to live.

1359
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:36,599
You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry.

1360
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:44,915
Funny, the damage a
silly little book can do

1361
02:09:45,080 --> 02:09:49,915
Especially in the hands
of a silly little girl.

1362
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:54,392
What are you doing?

1363
02:09:57,120 --> 02:09:59,156
Stop. No!

1364
02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:58,874
It was me. But I
swear, I didn't mean to.

1365
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:02,396
Riddle made me, and....

1366
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:05,440
Harry, you're hurt.

1367
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:07,193
Don't worry.

1368
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:10,875
Ginny, you need to get yourself out.

1369
02:11:11,040 --> 02:11:14,157
Follow the Chamber and you'll find Ron.

1370
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:27,836
You were brilliant, Fawkes.

1371
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:31,229
I just wasn't quick enough.

1372
02:11:51,200 --> 02:11:52,838
Of course.

1373
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:55,839
Phoenix tears have healing powers.

1374
02:11:57,400 --> 02:11:59,118
Thanks.

1375
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:02,836
It's all right, Ginny.

1376
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:06,036
It's over.

1377
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,434
It's just a memory.

1378
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:17,320
Amazing! This is just like magic!

1379
02:12:28,160 --> 02:12:30,720
You both realize, of course

1380
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:36,159
That in the past few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules.

1381
02:12:36,760 --> 02:12:37,749
Yes, sir.

1382
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:40,992
There is sufficient evidence
to have you both expelled.

1383
02:12:41,160 --> 02:12:42,309
Yes, sir.

1384
02:12:42,480 --> 02:12:45,119
Therefore, it is only fitting

1385
02:12:46,600 --> 02:12:48,795
That you both receive

1386
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:53,193
Special Awards for
Services to the School.

1387
02:12:55,200 --> 02:12:56,952
Thanks, sir.

1388
02:12:57,520 --> 02:12:59,715
Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would

1389
02:12:59,880 --> 02:13:03,873
Have an owl deliver these
release papers to Azkaban.

1390
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:09,511
I believe we want our gamekeeper back.

1391
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:18,432
First, I want to thank you, Harry.

1392
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:22,396
You must have shown me real
loyalty down in the Chamber.

1393
02:13:23,240 --> 02:13:27,631
Nothing but that could
have called Fawkes to you.

1394
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:31,399
And

1395
02:13:31,960 --> 02:13:33,313
Second

1396
02:13:33,480 --> 02:13:38,076
I sense that something is troubling you.

1397
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:40,669
Am I right, Harry?

1398
02:13:42,440 --> 02:13:44,112
It's just....

1399
02:13:45,240 --> 02:13:49,756
You see, sir, I couldn't help but
notice certain things, certain....

1400
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:55,358
Certain similarities
between T om Riddle and me.

1401
02:13:55,880 --> 02:13:57,029
I see.

1402
02:13:57,200 --> 02:14:02,752
Well, you can speak
Parseltongue, Harry. Why?

1403
02:14:03,200 --> 02:14:08,479
Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parseltongue.

1404
02:14:09,640 --> 02:14:12,279
If I'm not mistaken, Harry

1405
02:14:12,640 --> 02:14:16,315
He transferred some of his powers to you

1406
02:14:16,480 --> 02:14:19,313
The night he gave you that scar.

1407
02:14:19,480 --> 02:14:23,189
Voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me?

1408
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:27,634
Not intentionally

1409
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:30,311
But yes.

1410
02:14:32,160 --> 02:14:35,357
So the Sorting Hat was right.
I should be in Slytherin.

1411
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:40,150
It's true. You possess many of the
qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.

1412
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:43,039
Determination, resourcefulness

1413
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:47,034
And if I may say so, a certain
disregard for the rules.

1414
02:14:47,720 --> 02:14:51,554
Why, then, did the Sorting
Hat place you in Gryffindor?

1415
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:55,875
Because I asked it to.
Exactly, Harry. Exactly.

1416
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:58,031
Which makes you
different from Voldemort.

1417
02:14:58,200 --> 02:15:01,909
It is not our abilities
that show what we truly are.

1418
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:04,236
It is our choices.

1419
02:15:07,760 --> 02:15:11,036
If you want proof why
you belong in Gryffindor

1420
02:15:11,200 --> 02:15:15,876
Then I suggest you look
more closely at this.

1421
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:18,432
Be careful.

1422
02:15:23,880 --> 02:15:26,440
Godric Gryffindor.

1423
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:30,513
It would take a true Gryffindor
to pull that out of the hat.

1424
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:40,359
Dobby.

1425
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:45,798
So this is your master. The
family you serve is the Malfoys.

1426
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:51,077
I'll deal with you later.

1427
02:15:56,680 --> 02:15:58,238
Out of my way, Potter.

1428
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:01,836
So it's true. You have returned.

1429
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:05,153
When the governors learned
that Arthur Weasley's daughter

1430
02:16:05,320 --> 02:16:09,313
Was taken into the Chamber,
they saw fit to summon me back.

1431
02:16:10,120 --> 02:16:14,033
Ridiculous. Curiously,
Lucius, several of them

1432
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:17,715
Were under the impression that
you would curse their family

1433
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:20,599
If they did not agree to
suspend me in the first place.

1434
02:16:21,040 --> 02:16:24,350
How dare you! Beg your pardon?

1435
02:16:24,520 --> 02:16:28,149
My sole concern has always
been and will always be

1436
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:31,039
The welfare of this school

1437
02:16:31,200 --> 02:16:35,318
And, of course, its students.

1438
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:43,239
The culprit has been
identified, I presume?

1439
02:16:43,600 --> 02:16:45,079
Yes.

1440
02:16:46,600 --> 02:16:48,352
And?

1441
02:16:49,480 --> 02:16:51,436
Who was it?

1442
02:16:57,600 --> 02:17:00,034
Voldemort.

1443
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:06,393
Only this time he chose to
act through somebody else

1444
02:17:06,920 --> 02:17:10,390
By means of this.

1445
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:14,439
I see.

1446
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:19,879
Fortunately, our young
Mr. Potter discovered it.

1447
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:23,715
One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort's old schoolthings

1448
02:17:23,880 --> 02:17:26,997
Should find their way
into innocent hands.

1449
02:17:27,320 --> 02:17:31,074
The consequences for the
one responsible would be

1450
02:17:31,440 --> 02:17:33,237
Severe.

1451
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:37,273
Well, let us hope

1452
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:42,753
That Mr. Potter will always
be around to save the day.

1453
02:17:43,480 --> 02:17:47,075
Don't worry. I will be.

1454
02:17:55,480 --> 02:17:57,436
Dumbledore.

1455
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:01,910
Come, Dobby. We're leaving.

1456
02:18:18,480 --> 02:18:22,758
Sir? I wonder if I could have that?

1457
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:30,433
Mr. Malfoy.

1458
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:32,716
Mr. Malfoy!

1459
02:18:33,160 --> 02:18:35,230
I have something of yours.

1460
02:18:36,840 --> 02:18:39,673
Mine? I don't know what
you' re talking about.

1461
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:41,319
I think you do, sir.

1462
02:18:41,480 --> 02:18:44,472
I think you slipped the diary
into Ginny Weasley's cauldron

1463
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:45,993
That day at Diagon Alley.

1464
02:18:46,680 --> 02:18:49,114
You do, do you?

1465
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:59,118
Why don't you prove it?

1466
02:19:05,120 --> 02:19:07,190
Come, Dobby.

1467
02:19:08,440 --> 02:19:10,396
Open it.

1468
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:15,239
Dobby.

1469
02:19:15,400 --> 02:19:18,437
Master has given Dobby a sock.

1470
02:19:18,720 --> 02:19:20,711
What? I didn't give

1471
02:19:20,880 --> 02:19:24,429
Master has presented Dobby with clothes.

1472
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:27,512
Dobby is free.

1473
02:19:33,800 --> 02:19:37,395
You lost me my servant!

1474
02:19:44,080 --> 02:19:47,914
You shall not harm Harry Potter.

1475
02:19:59,560 --> 02:20:03,109
Your parents were meddlesome fools too.

1476
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:06,317
Mark my words, Potter. One day soon

1477
02:20:06,480 --> 02:20:11,474
You are going to meet
the same sticky end.

1478
02:20:16,960 --> 02:20:22,592
Harry Potter freed Dobby.
How can Dobby ever repay him?

1479
02:20:22,960 --> 02:20:27,033
Just promise me
something. Anything, sir.

1480
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:31,275
Never try to save my life again.

1481
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:40,038
Welcome back, Sir Nicholas. Thank you.

1482
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:42,595
Good evening, Sir
Nicholas. Good evening.

1483
02:20:42,760 --> 02:20:45,558
Good to see you, Sir
Nicholas. Thank you.

1484
02:20:46,880 --> 02:20:48,996
Hello.

1485
02:20:50,640 --> 02:20:55,077
Hermione! Welcome back.
Thanks, Sir Nicholas.

1486
02:20:58,200 --> 02:21:01,397
Harry. It's Hermione.

1487
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:30,669
Welcome back, Hermione.
It's good to be back.

1488
02:21:30,840 --> 02:21:33,308
Congratulations. I can't
believe you solved it.

1489
02:21:33,480 --> 02:21:35,630
We had loads of help from you.

1490
02:21:35,800 --> 02:21:38,872
We couldn't have done
it without you. Thanks.

1491
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:43,473
Could I have your attention, please?

1492
02:21:47,480 --> 02:21:49,869
Before we begin the feast

1493
02:21:50,040 --> 02:21:56,036
Let us have a round of applause
for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey

1494
02:21:56,200 --> 02:22:00,159
Whose Mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered

1495
02:22:00,320 --> 02:22:02,880
To all who had been Petrified.

1496
02:22:12,960 --> 02:22:15,838
Also, in light of the recent events

1497
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,070
As a school treat

1498
02:22:18,240 --> 02:22:22,028
All exams have been canceled.

1499
02:22:24,600 --> 02:22:26,113
Oh, no.

1500
02:22:42,360 --> 02:22:44,316
Sorry I'm late.

1501
02:22:50,120 --> 02:22:54,352
The owl that delivered my release
papers got all lost and confused.

1502
02:22:54,680 --> 02:22:57,831
Some ruddy bird called Errol.

1503
02:23:12,960 --> 02:23:18,717
And I'd just like to say that if it
hadn't been for you, Harry and Ron

1504
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:21,753
And Hermione, of course

1505
02:23:22,400 --> 02:23:26,313
I would still be youknowwhere

1506
02:23:26,480 --> 02:23:29,916
So I'd just like to say thanks.

1507
02:23:38,920 --> 02:23:41,753
There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid.
