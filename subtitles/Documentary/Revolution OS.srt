1
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:05,483
I was at Agenda 2000

2
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:08,882
and uh, one of the people who
was there was Craig Mundie,

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:11,983
who is some kind of high
mucky muck at Microsoft,

4
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:15,982
I think uh, vice-president of consumer
products or something like that.

5
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:18,783
And uh, I hadn't actually met him

6
00:00:18,983 --> 00:00:22,683
I, I, I, uh, bumped in to him in an,
in an elevator... in an elevator

7
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:26,783
And uh, I looked at his badge and said,
"Oh, I see you work for Microsoft."

8
00:00:27,283 --> 00:00:30,782
And he looked back to me and said,
"Oh, yeah and what do you do?"

9
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:33,782
And I thought he seemed just
a sort of a tad dismissive

10
00:00:33,882 --> 00:00:36,982
I mean, here's the archetypal,
you know, guy in a suit

11
00:00:37,482 --> 00:00:38,982
looking at a scruffy hacker

12
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:42,181
And so I gave him the
thousand yard stare and said,

13
00:00:42,182 --> 00:00:44,082
"I'm your worst nightmare."

14
00:00:44,282 --> 00:00:47,881
Wonderview Productions PRESENTS

15
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:51,882
A J.T.S. Moore FILM

16
00:00:53,282 --> 00:00:58,182
REVOLUTION OS

17
00:00:59,882 --> 00:01:02,081
For most its short,
but colorful history,

18
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:04,081
the computer industry has been dominated

19
00:01:04,082 --> 00:01:05,981
by the Windows operating system.

20
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,981
But that could soon change,

21
00:01:07,982 --> 00:01:10,882
as Windows faces a strong
challenge from Linux

22
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:13,982
Silicon Valley has long been the place

23
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:15,982
to develop new technology,

24
00:01:16,282 --> 00:01:19,782
start new companies and get really rich.

25
00:01:19,882 --> 00:01:22,282
Now The Valley is the front
line in a revolution

26
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,182
fighting for that most
politically incorrect of ideas:

27
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:26,982
individual freedom

28
00:01:27,682 --> 00:01:29,282
Day and night, a loose
confederation of

29
00:01:29,482 --> 00:01:31,482
hackers and programmers
zaps bits pieces of

30
00:01:31,582 --> 00:01:34,282
computer code around the
world as it builds the tools

31
00:01:34,682 --> 00:01:36,482
to set computer users free

32
00:01:36,782 --> 00:01:39,082
using open information and the
free exchange of technology

33
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,481
to achieve its goals.

34
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:43,081
This revolution began in the 1980's with

35
00:01:43,082 --> 00:01:45,781
the Free Software
Movement and GNU project.

36
00:01:45,782 --> 00:01:47,482
And now is most commonly associated

37
00:01:47,782 --> 00:01:51,082
with Linux and the Open Source Movement.

38
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:54,081
What is Linux?

39
00:01:54,082 --> 00:01:56,481
We do have one sector
that taking off today.

40
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:58,581
It is the Linux-related sector.

41
00:01:58,582 --> 00:02:00,682
And I thought this might be
a good opportunity to say,

42
00:02:00,982 --> 00:02:02,682
"What is Linux?"

43
00:02:02,882 --> 00:02:03,882
And I'll answer this question for you.

44
00:02:03,982 --> 00:02:04,980
Many of you probably already know,

45
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:06,482
but There are 12 million
users out there

46
00:02:06,782 --> 00:02:10,081
A computer Operating System
developed by hundreds of

47
00:02:10,082 --> 00:02:11,980
programmers collaborating
on the Internet

48
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:13,882
A challenge to Microsoft Windows NT

49
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:15,482
Very popular for its speed

50
00:02:16,482 --> 00:02:17,782
and so this's what the craze is about

51
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:21,681
To kind of explain what
Linux is you have to

52
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:23,681
explain what an Operating System is

53
00:02:23,682 --> 00:02:26,181
And... the thing about Operating
System is you, I mean...

54
00:02:26,182 --> 00:02:28,880
you're never ever supposed to see it.

55
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:30,580
Because...

56
00:02:30,581 --> 00:02:32,781
nobody really uses an Operating System,

57
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:35,980
people use... programs...
on their computer

58
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:37,981
And the only mission in life

59
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:41,981
of an operating system is
to help those programs run.

60
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:45,581
So an operating system never
does anything on its own

61
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:48,180
It's only waiting for the programs to

62
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:50,481
ask for certain resources or,

63
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:54,081
or, ask for a certain file on the disk

64
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:55,980
or ask for the programs to

65
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:57,781
connect them to the outside world.

66
00:02:57,981 --> 00:03:00,580
And then the operating system
comes, steps in and then

67
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:04,180
tries to make it easy for
people to write programs

68
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:07,480
And, What is Open Source?

69
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:10,481
Open Source is a way for
people to collaborate

70
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:16,180
on software without being encumbered by all
of the problems of intellectual property,

71
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:20,681
having to negotiate contracts every
time you buy a piece of software,

72
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:23,280
have a lot of lawyers involved.

73
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:26,481
In general, we just wanna
get the software to work

74
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:28,281
and we want be able to have

75
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:31,381
people contribute fixes to that, etc..

76
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:34,480
So we sort of sacrifice some of

77
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,381
the intellectual property rights

78
00:03:36,481 --> 00:03:38,981
and just let the whole
world use the software

79
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:42,281
Before there could be Linux

80
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:45,681
There was Richard Stallman and
the Free Software Movement.

81
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:48,681
They think of Richard Stallman as the...

82
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:52,480
great philosopher, right.

83
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:54,281
And think of me as the engineer

84
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:58,881
Richard Stallman is the founding
father of the Free Software Movement.

85
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:02,481
Through his efforts to build
the GNU Operating System.

86
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:06,380
He created the legal, philosophical
and technological foundation

87
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:08,280
for the Free Software Movement.

88
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,880
Without these contributions,

89
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:12,380
it's unlikely that Linux and Open Source

90
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:14,481
would have evolved in to
their current forms today

91
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:19,181
I joined the MIT Artificial
Intelligence Lab in 1971,

92
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:23,481
I joined... a thriving
community of hackers,

93
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,481
people who loved programming,

94
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:28,780
loved exploring the what they
could do with computers.

95
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,179
And they had developed a
complete Operating System,

96
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,680
entirely written there.

97
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,280
And I became one of the team, that

98
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,879
continued to improve the Operating
System, adding new capabilities

99
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,880
That was my job, and I loved it, we all loved it.
That's why we were doing it.

100
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,579
And [clears throat] we called our system

101
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,080
"the Incompatible Time Sharing System"

102
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,080
which is an example of the

103
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:54,080
playful spirit

104
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,380
which defines a hacker.

105
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,680
Hackers are people who
enjoy playful cleverness.

106
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,979
Well, it first started going wrong

107
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,480
as the outside world started
pressuring us to have passwords.

108
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,780
We didn't have any
passwords on our computer.

109
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,979
And the reason was that the hackers

110
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,279
who'd originally designed the system

111
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,180
realized that passwords were a way the
administrators could control all the users.

112
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,680
And they didn't want to build tools

113
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,380
you know, locks and keys for the
administrators to control them,

114
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,780
so they just didn't do it.
They left that out

115
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,980
And we had the philosophy that
whoever sitting at the computer

116
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,480
should be able to do whatever he wants

117
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,979
and somebody else who was there yesterday
shouldn't be controlling what you do today

118
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,780
When they put passwords onto
one of the machines at MIT

119
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,979
I and bunch of other
hackers didn't like it,

120
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,980
I decided to try a subversive sort of hack.
[clears throat]

121
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,879
I figured out how to
decode the passwords,

122
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,279
so by looking at the database
of encoded passwords

123
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,780
I could figure out what each person
would actually type to login

124
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,680
And so I sent messages
to people, saying,

125
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,080
"Hello? I see that you've
chosen the password mumble,

126
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,480
whatever it was. How
about if you do as I do

127
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,979
just type Enter for your password

128
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,980
it's much shorter, much easier to type".

129
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,979
And... of course with this message I was

130
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,480
implicitly telling them the
security was really just a joke.

131
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,779
Anyway, but in addition I was
letting them in on this hack.

132
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,979
And eventually, A fifth of all the
users on that computer joined me

133
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,478
in using just Enter as their passwords.

134
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,579
[ Where did the ideas that lead to
what is now called Open Source world?

135
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:40,679
How did that begin? Who began that? ]

136
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:44,779
It actually began with the start
of computers because at that time

137
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:47,879
software was just passed
around between people

138
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:52,879
And I think it was only like in
the lates 70's or early 80's

139
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,978
That people started really
closing up their software,

140
00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:00,179
And saying, "No, you can never
get a look at the source code.

141
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,779
You can't change the software
even if it's necessary

142
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:06,779
for you to fix it, for
your own application"

143
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:11,479
And... um, you can actually blame
some of that on Microsoft,

144
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:15,679
They are one of the real pioneers
of the proprietary software model.

145
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,279
In the mid 1970's, a group of hackers

146
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:22,979
and computer hobbyist in Silicon Valley
formed the "Homebrew Computer Club".

147
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:26,978
In the club January 31, 1976 newsletter,

148
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,679
Bill Gates of the recently
formed Microsoft,

149
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:31,479
wrote an open letter to the community

150
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:38,079
where he made a point by point argument for the
relatively new concept of proprietary software

151
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,679
up to that point, the practice of computer
users had been to freely pass around software

152
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:45,479
with not much thought
given to its ownership

153
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:48,579
Known as An Open Letter to
Hobbyists, Bill Gates writes,

154
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:51,279
"To me the most critical thing
in the hobby market right now

155
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:54,379
is the lack of good software
courses, books and software itself.

156
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,579
Without good software and an owner
who understands programming,

157
00:07:57,779 --> 00:07:59,778
A hobby computer is wasted.

158
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,479
Will quality software be
written for the hobby market?

159
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,378
Gates goes on to write, "The
feedback we have gotten from

160
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:08,778
the hundreds of people who say they are
using BASIC has all been positive.

161
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,978
Two surprising things
are apparent, however.

162
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,978
1) Most of these "users"
never bought BASIC, and

163
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,978
2) The amount of royalties we have
received from sales to hobbyists

164
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,978
makes the time spent on of Altair BASIC
worth less than 2 dollars an hour

165
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:22,178
Why is this?

166
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:24,678
As the majority of
hobbyists must be aware,

167
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:26,778
most of you steal your software.

168
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:29,677
Hardware must be paid for but
software is something to share.

169
00:08:29,678 --> 00:08:31,978
Who cares if the people who
worked on it get paid?

170
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,377
Is this fair?

171
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:35,477
One thing you don't do
by stealing software

172
00:08:35,478 --> 00:08:37,977
is get back at MITS for some
problem you may have had

173
00:08:37,978 --> 00:08:40,077
MITS doesn't make money
selling software.

174
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:43,078
One thing you do do is prevent
good software from being written.

175
00:08:43,478 --> 00:08:45,778
Who can afford to do
professional work for nothing?

176
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:48,777
What hobbyist can put 3-man
years into programming,

177
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,377
finding all bugs, documenting his
product and distribute it for free?

178
00:08:52,378 --> 00:08:53,278
The fact is,

179
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,877
no one besides us has invested a
lot of money in hobby software.

180
00:08:56,878 --> 00:08:59,477
What about the guys who
resell Altair BASIC?

181
00:08:59,478 --> 00:09:01,777
Aren't they making money
on hobby software?

182
00:09:01,778 --> 00:09:05,277
Yes, but those who have been
reported to us may lose in the end.

183
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,377
They are the ones who give
hobbyists a bad name,

184
00:09:07,378 --> 00:09:10,777
and should be kicked out of any
club meeting they show up at.

185
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:13,677
I would appreciate letters from
anyone who wants to pay up,

186
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,477
or has a suggestion or comment.

187
00:09:15,478 --> 00:09:19,478
Signed Bill Gates, General
partner, Micro-Soft.

188
00:09:19,878 --> 00:09:23,577
In the late 70's and early
1980's, Richard Stallman was

189
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:26,877
doing Artificial Intelligence
research and coding

190
00:09:26,878 --> 00:09:29,477
at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab.

191
00:09:29,478 --> 00:09:31,777
Richard had a number of
negative experiences

192
00:09:31,778 --> 00:09:33,777
during that period which soured him

193
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:35,877
on the whole idea of
commercial software.

194
00:09:35,878 --> 00:09:37,477
[ such as? ]

195
00:09:37,478 --> 00:09:41,478
uh... some company wanted to work
on and wanted to fix was locked up.

196
00:09:42,178 --> 00:09:46,178
and he couldn't get the company that
owned on the code to let him fix it

197
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,978
even though it would have been
to their advantage to do so.

198
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:51,878
And that put me into a
moral dilemma, you see?

199
00:09:51,978 --> 00:09:57,578
Because to get one of the modern computers
of the day, which was the early 80's,

200
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:00,878
you would have to get a
proprietory operating system.

201
00:10:00,978 --> 00:10:03,878
The developers of those systems
didn't share with other people,

202
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,978
Instead they tried to control the users,

203
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:07,878
dominate the users, restrict them.

204
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:10,478
Say, if to get the system,

205
00:10:10,578 --> 00:10:13,978
you have to sign a promise you
won't share with anybody else.

206
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,877
And to me that was essentially
a promise to be a bad person,

207
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:19,578
to betray the rest of the world,

208
00:10:19,678 --> 00:10:23,578
cut myself off from society
from a cooperating community.

209
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:28,776
And I had already experienced what
happened when other people did that to us,

210
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:30,277
when they refused to share with us.

211
00:10:30,377 --> 00:10:32,977
because they had signed these contracts.

212
00:10:33,077 --> 00:10:34,877
And it hurt the whole lab,

213
00:10:34,977 --> 00:10:37,677
it kept us from doing
useful things before.

214
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:40,077
So I just wasn't going to do that.

215
00:10:40,177 --> 00:10:44,177
I thought,"This is wrong! I am
not going to live this way"

216
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:48,377
And from experiences like this he
developed a profound hostility

217
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:51,077
to the idea of intellectual
property and software.

218
00:10:51,177 --> 00:10:54,777
He eventually acted this out by
founding the Free Software Foundation.

219
00:10:54,877 --> 00:10:59,377
So, I looked for another
alternative and I realized:

220
00:10:59,477 --> 00:11:00,977
I was an operating system developer.

221
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,777
If I were to develop
another operating system.

222
00:11:04,977 --> 00:11:08,577
And then as the author,
encourage everyone to share it.

223
00:11:08,677 --> 00:11:12,377
Say, everyone, " You come and get
it, use this, form a new community"

224
00:11:13,377 --> 00:11:17,677
Not only could I gave myself a way
to keep using computers without

225
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,977
betraying other people, but I'd
give it to everybody else, too.

226
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:23,977
Everybody would have a way
out of that moral dilemma

227
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,777
And so I realized this was
what I had to do with my life.

228
00:11:29,177 --> 00:11:33,177
I actually began the project
in January of 1984.

229
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:35,977
That's when I resigned for my job at MIT

230
00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:39,877
to start developing the
GNU operating system.

231
00:11:40,877 --> 00:11:44,177
Now I should explain the
name GNU is a hack.

232
00:11:44,377 --> 00:11:47,177
Because it's a recursive acronym.

233
00:11:47,577 --> 00:11:50,577
It stands for "GNU's Not Unix".

234
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:53,776
You see so the "G" in
"GNU" stands for "GNU".

235
00:11:53,777 --> 00:11:55,876
And what the name means is

236
00:11:55,877 --> 00:12:00,376
I was developing a system that was
like the Unix operating system,

237
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:02,776
but was not the Unix operating system.

238
00:12:02,777 --> 00:12:04,276
This was a different system.

239
00:12:04,277 --> 00:12:06,677
We would have to write it
completely from scratch

240
00:12:06,678 --> 00:12:08,577
because Unix was proprietory.

241
00:12:08,677 --> 00:12:10,477
We were forbidden to share Unix,

242
00:12:10,577 --> 00:12:14,177
We couldn't use Unix. It was
useless for a community.

243
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:17,777
So we had to write a replacement for it.

244
00:12:19,377 --> 00:12:20,577
Throughout the 1980s,

245
00:12:20,677 --> 00:12:23,177
as Richard Stallman was
building the GNU project,

246
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:26,776
computer scientists from the
University of California at Berkeley

247
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:29,176
were developing their own
free operating system.

248
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:31,976
Known as Berkeley Unix, or BSD,

249
00:12:32,076 --> 00:12:35,976
it was based upon the Unix kernel
which had been licensed from AT&T.

250
00:12:36,076 --> 00:12:40,776
However, due to legal problems with AT&T
and fragmentation of the source code,

251
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:44,576
hackers and other non-institutional
users were slow to adopt it

252
00:12:44,776 --> 00:12:48,776
Well, Unix consisted of a large
number of separate programs

253
00:12:49,176 --> 00:12:50,876
that communicated with each other.

254
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:53,876
So we just had to replace
these programs one by one.

255
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:57,676
So what I started doing was writing
a replacement for one program,

256
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,576
and then another, and then another,

257
00:12:59,676 --> 00:13:01,376
and then people started joining me,

258
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:05,076
because I published an announcement
inviting other people to join me

259
00:13:05,176 --> 00:13:06,776
to help write these programs.

260
00:13:07,076 --> 00:13:14,476
And uh... and by around 1991, we had
replaced practically all of them.

261
00:13:14,976 --> 00:13:16,276
[ What were some of the
programs that you ... ]

262
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:19,476
Well... we had to... to
have a complete system,

263
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:23,176
you need to have a kernel,
which is the program that

264
00:13:23,276 --> 00:13:26,076
allocates resources to
all the other programs,

265
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:29,576
you need a compiler, which
translates a program

266
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:34,976
from readable source code that
programmers can understand into numbers,

267
00:13:35,076 --> 00:13:39,376
mysterious numbers that the
computer can actually run.

268
00:13:39,476 --> 00:13:41,975
you need other programs that go with
the compiler to help do this job.

269
00:13:41,976 --> 00:13:43,076
you need a debugger.

270
00:13:43,176 --> 00:13:44,776
you need a text editor.

271
00:13:44,876 --> 00:13:45,976
you need text formatters.

272
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,876
you need mailers...

273
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:49,276
you need lots and lots of things.

274
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:52,976
There are hundreds of programs
in a Unix-like operating system.

275
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:54,976
I saw Stallman's announcement.

276
00:13:55,076 --> 00:13:58,376
Actually I met him in February of 1987.

277
00:13:58,476 --> 00:14:02,976
He came to give a five-day
tutorial on Emacs at our company.

278
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,676
And during the day he would explain

279
00:14:05,776 --> 00:14:07,876
new ways to think about Emacs

280
00:14:07,976 --> 00:14:10,976
and ways to extend it, enhance it,
and to use the Emacs source code

281
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:12,876
uh, for better or worse.

282
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:16,176
But in the evening, he was
busily working on this compiler,

283
00:14:16,276 --> 00:14:18,576
and he had not yet
released it to the public,

284
00:14:18,676 --> 00:14:22,276
so he was uh, being a little
bit uh, careful about

285
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:24,776
who, who got to see the source code.

286
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:28,275
But I was very eager, and when
he first announced it in June,

287
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,975
I downloaded it immediately.

288
00:14:30,175 --> 00:14:31,575
I, I played with it.

289
00:14:31,675 --> 00:14:33,875
I got some, some pointers from him.

290
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:35,675
And when I sent the
source code back to him,

291
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,975
he was very,

292
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:41,775
uh, actually amazed that how quickly I
was able to ramp up on his technology.

293
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:42,775
Whenever we worked on something
at Stanford or in the university,

294
00:14:42,776 --> 00:14:46,775
Whenever we worked on something
at Stanford or in the university,

295
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,675
we would get, mostly at the time

296
00:14:48,775 --> 00:14:52,675
we were working off machines from
Digital Equipment or Sun, mostly Sun.

297
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,375
Whenever we would get a Sun machine,

298
00:14:54,575 --> 00:14:58,975
the first thing we would do is
we would spend literally days

299
00:14:59,075 --> 00:15:03,075
downloading GNU free
software from the Internet,

300
00:15:03,175 --> 00:15:05,575
building it and installing
it on that Sun machine.

301
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:09,275
The crucial thing about GNU
is that it's free software.

302
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:13,175
And Free Software refers not
to price, but to freedom.

303
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,675
So think of free speech, not free beer.

304
00:15:16,675 --> 00:15:18,974
The freedoms that I am talking about

305
00:15:18,975 --> 00:15:21,975
are the freedoms to make
changes if you want to,

306
00:15:22,075 --> 00:15:24,775
or hire somebody else
to make changes for you

307
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,975
if you're using a software
for your business,

308
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:30,775
to redistribute copies, to
share with other people,

309
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,975
and to make improvements
and publish them

310
00:15:34,075 --> 00:15:36,975
so that other people can get
the benefit of them, too.

311
00:15:37,075 --> 00:15:40,875
And those are the freedoms that distinguish
free software from non-free software.

312
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:44,975
These are the freedoms that enable
people to form a community.

313
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:46,575
If you don't have all these freedoms,

314
00:15:46,576 --> 00:15:49,375
you're being divided and
dominated by somebody.

315
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,474
My first experience
contributing to free software

316
00:15:53,475 --> 00:15:57,475
came in late 1989, early 1990.

317
00:15:57,675 --> 00:16:00,675
I was working as a graduate
student at Stanford University

318
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,075
on Computer Aided Design tools.

319
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:05,275
One of the pieces I needed was a tool

320
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,975
called a parser generator.

321
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:09,275
Well, the Free Software Foundation

322
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,775
under Richard Stallman created
a great tool called "bison".

323
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:16,875
I needed a tool that worked with C++.
Bison worked with C.

324
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:20,575
I modified bison to create
something called "bison++".

325
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:23,175
And it's a tremendous
feeling of empowerment

326
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:26,374
be able to take a piece of
software that was available

327
00:16:26,474 --> 00:16:30,974
and create what you needed in a very
short piece of time by modifying it.

328
00:16:31,174 --> 00:16:33,574
I put it back on the Internet

329
00:16:33,674 --> 00:16:35,374
and I was amazed at the number of people

330
00:16:35,474 --> 00:16:37,374
that picked it up and started using it.

331
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:41,474
In fact, I remember going
to, uh job interviews,

332
00:16:41,774 --> 00:16:44,574
I, at various times, considered
just going out getting a job.

333
00:16:44,774 --> 00:16:46,574
And I'd gone to a job interview.

334
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:48,074
And I was talking to one of the people,

335
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,974
and I started asking them
about what tools they used,

336
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:53,474
and they said, "Gee, we used bison++!"

337
00:16:53,574 --> 00:16:55,874
and I said, "Oh, I am
the author of bison++!"

338
00:16:56,074 --> 00:17:00,574
Free Software generally
does have a copyright.

339
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:03,274
It does have an owner.

340
00:17:03,374 --> 00:17:04,474
And it has a license.

341
00:17:04,574 --> 00:17:06,374
It is not public domain.

342
00:17:06,474 --> 00:17:09,074
If we put the software
in the public domain,

343
00:17:09,174 --> 00:17:12,374
somebody else would be able to
make a little bit of changes

344
00:17:12,474 --> 00:17:15,374
and turn that into a
proprietory software package,

345
00:17:15,474 --> 00:17:18,274
which means that the users
would be running our software,

346
00:17:18,374 --> 00:17:21,274
but they wouldn't have freedom
to cooperate and share.

347
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:25,674
To prevent that, we use a
technique called "Copyleft".

348
00:17:25,974 --> 00:17:29,174
The idea of Copyleft is that
it's "Copyright" flipped over.

349
00:17:29,974 --> 00:17:31,674
And what we do is, we say,

350
00:17:31,774 --> 00:17:33,674
this software is copyrighted

351
00:17:33,774 --> 00:17:38,074
and we, the authors give you
permission to redistribute copies,

352
00:17:38,174 --> 00:17:39,674
we give you permission to change,

353
00:17:39,774 --> 00:17:41,374
we give you permission to add to it.

354
00:17:41,474 --> 00:17:43,174
But when you redistribute it,

355
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:46,974
it has to be under these
terms, no more and no less.

356
00:17:47,074 --> 00:17:49,274
So that whoever gets it from you

357
00:17:49,374 --> 00:17:54,674
also gets the freedom to cooperate
with other people, if he wants to.

358
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:58,274
And then, in this way
everywhere the software goes,

359
00:17:58,374 --> 00:17:59,974
the freedom goes, too.

360
00:18:00,074 --> 00:18:02,374
And it becomes an inalienable right

361
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:06,074
to cooperate with other
people and form a community.

362
00:18:06,274 --> 00:18:09,574
[ And so, what is that? the license?
what was that... ]

363
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:11,674
Well, Copyleft being a general idea,

364
00:18:11,774 --> 00:18:14,774
in order to use it, you have
to have specific example.

365
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:18,574
The specific example we use for
most GNU software packages

366
00:18:18,674 --> 00:18:21,574
is the GNU General Public License,

367
00:18:21,674 --> 00:18:25,673
a particular document in legalese
which accomplishes this job.

368
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:28,673
A lot of other people use that
same license, for example,

369
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:32,173
Linus Torvalds uses that
license for Linux as well.

370
00:18:33,173 --> 00:18:36,673
Well, the license I use is the
GNU General Public License.

371
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:38,673
That's the one Richard Stallman wrote.

372
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:42,673
And I think it is really
astounding contribution.

373
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:46,773
Uh, it's one of the few software
licenses that was written

374
00:18:47,073 --> 00:18:50,473
from the standpoint of the
community rather than

375
00:18:50,573 --> 00:18:54,373
from the standpoint of
um, protecting a company

376
00:18:54,473 --> 00:18:59,973
or um, as is the case
with MIT and BSD license

377
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:03,873
performing the goals of a
government grant program.

378
00:19:03,973 --> 00:19:06,973
Uh, and the GPL is
really unique in that.

379
00:19:07,073 --> 00:19:10,473
It's not just a license. It's
a whole philosophy that,

380
00:19:10,573 --> 00:19:13,573
I think, motivated the
open source definition.

381
00:19:13,673 --> 00:19:17,973
I don't hide that a lot of
what I do came from Stallman.

382
00:19:22,373 --> 00:19:26,373
A crucial step in the growth of GNU/Linux
and the Free Software movement

383
00:19:26,473 --> 00:19:30,073
was the creation of businesses based
upon the software and philosophy.

384
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:32,773
Grown zero for the beginning
of the business phase

385
00:19:32,873 --> 00:19:35,973
was the Electronics Research
Lab at Stanford University.

386
00:19:36,273 --> 00:19:39,573
Known as ERL, the lab was
the place for the first GNU

387
00:19:39,673 --> 00:19:41,973
and Linux business founder inspiration.

388
00:19:42,073 --> 00:19:44,073
So right here was where ERL was.

389
00:19:44,573 --> 00:19:47,673
That would have been the entrance
over there next to the uh,

390
00:19:47,773 --> 00:19:50,073
electrical engineering
McCullough building.

391
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:53,973
As you walk in, you come in, you
walk down the hallway, down here.

392
00:19:54,973 --> 00:19:58,073
My office would have
been about, about here.

393
00:19:58,173 --> 00:20:01,473
and then right across the hall, from
that was Michael Tiemann's office.

394
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:06,172
Michael Tiemann took uh.. and
started a company, Cygnus Software

395
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:11,072
with the idea was to sell consulting and
services around the GNU Free Software

396
00:20:11,073 --> 00:20:13,472
and, well Michael's done
very well with Cygnus.

397
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:17,472
Well uh, I spend a lot
of time working out uh,

398
00:20:17,473 --> 00:20:19,472
how we were going to make money

399
00:20:19,473 --> 00:20:21,472
and in the original GNU manifesto

400
00:20:21,473 --> 00:20:24,471
which is the last chapter
of the GNU Emacs manual.

401
00:20:24,472 --> 00:20:26,471
Stallman proposed a number of different

402
00:20:26,472 --> 00:20:28,271
possible ways to make money.

403
00:20:28,272 --> 00:20:30,271
From the beginning of the
Free Software movement

404
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:31,472
I had the idea that there's

405
00:20:31,473 --> 00:20:33,472
room in it for business to be done.

406
00:20:33,473 --> 00:20:36,171
One of the advantages of Free
Software is that, there's

407
00:20:36,172 --> 00:20:39,471
a free market for any kind
of service or support.

408
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,471
So if you are using
software in your business,

409
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:43,471
and you want good support,

410
00:20:43,472 --> 00:20:46,471
you have a choice of
people to go to for it,

411
00:20:46,472 --> 00:20:48,471
you have a choice of businesses... that

412
00:20:48,472 --> 00:20:51,471
are in the business of
providing you with support.

413
00:20:51,472 --> 00:20:53,471
So they are going to have
to in general give you

414
00:20:53,472 --> 00:20:56,471
good support or you go to somebody else.

415
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:58,472
With proprietory software,

416
00:20:58,772 --> 00:21:01,471
support is a monopoly,
there is one company,

417
00:21:01,472 --> 00:21:04,071
typically, that has the source code

418
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:05,972
and only they can give you support

419
00:21:06,572 --> 00:21:09,771
so typically, you are at
the mercy of a monopoly.

420
00:21:09,772 --> 00:21:12,071
That's the case, for
example with Microsoft.

421
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:15,371
So no wonder the support is so bad.

422
00:21:15,372 --> 00:21:16,971
The benefits of Free Software were

423
00:21:16,972 --> 00:21:19,672
tremendous but the cost of
supporting it internally

424
00:21:20,272 --> 00:21:22,271
uh, and made managers
very very nervous and

425
00:21:22,272 --> 00:21:25,971
so the fundamental idea I had
was if we can build a model

426
00:21:25,972 --> 00:21:29,971
that could deliver two to
four times the support

427
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:33,471
and uh, and uh, and
hand holding capability

428
00:21:33,472 --> 00:21:35,571
that an internal engineer could provide.

429
00:21:35,572 --> 00:21:38,571
And we could do it at
1/2 to 1/4 of the cost

430
00:21:38,572 --> 00:21:40,771
that would meet the
test of whether or not

431
00:21:40,772 --> 00:21:42,371
people would actually buy.

432
00:21:42,372 --> 00:21:44,871
And by about the Fall
of that year, we had

433
00:21:44,872 --> 00:21:46,772
all the things worked out about who

434
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,371
needed on the technical team, what

435
00:21:48,372 --> 00:21:50,271
the terms the sale would be, what

436
00:21:50,272 --> 00:21:52,071
the key price point were, and we

437
00:21:52,072 --> 00:21:56,072
actually received our
incorporation in Nov of 1989.

438
00:21:56,672 --> 00:21:59,271
One of the most difficult
things in starting our company

439
00:21:59,272 --> 00:22:00,872
was actually finding a name for it.

440
00:22:00,873 --> 00:22:03,471
I explained this to one of my friends

441
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:04,872
"we're having difficulty"

442
00:22:04,873 --> 00:22:07,371
and he returned an e-mail message

443
00:22:07,372 --> 00:22:11,271
that basically just had a bunch of
words with the name "GNU" in it.

444
00:22:11,272 --> 00:22:16,072
And "Cygnus" was the one that looked
least obnoxious and least obscene.

445
00:22:16,572 --> 00:22:19,072
I can say very clearly that Cygnus

446
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:23,072
was the first business that
specialized in Free Software.

447
00:22:23,272 --> 00:22:26,570
Cygnus supported Free Software,

448
00:22:26,571 --> 00:22:30,570
filled a very essential niche
because we had this great software,

449
00:22:30,571 --> 00:22:34,571
you could get it for nothing but you
couldn't get support - they made their money

450
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,670
by charging for support.

451
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:40,370
The GNU project started
by building a toolkit,

452
00:22:40,371 --> 00:22:45,271
uh, basic development tools such as a C
compiler, a debugger, a text-editor,

453
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:48,970
and uh, other necessary apparatus.

454
00:22:48,971 --> 00:22:53,471
And their intention was eventually to
develop a kernel to sit underneath those

455
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:56,070
and be the center of
the operating system.

456
00:22:56,071 --> 00:22:59,870
By about 1990 they had successfully
developed that toolkit,

457
00:22:59,871 --> 00:23:03,871
and it was in wide use on
great many variants of Unix.

458
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:06,570
But there was still no free kernel.

459
00:23:06,571 --> 00:23:10,571
The kernel happened to be one of
the last things we started to do

460
00:23:10,871 --> 00:23:12,871
and we had started it not long before.

461
00:23:13,871 --> 00:23:16,870
And that's when Linus
Torvalds came along.

462
00:23:16,871 --> 00:23:20,171
"Lin-us" or "Line-us"? What's the
exact, do you prefer the pronunciation?

463
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:23,070
um.. When I speak
Swedish it's "Lee-nus";

464
00:23:23,071 --> 00:23:25,470
when I speak Finnish it's "Leen-ous";

465
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,271
when I speak English it's "Line-us".

466
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:30,070
And I really don't care how
people pronounce my name.

467
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:32,870
But "Linux" is always "Linux".

468
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:37,271
He developed a kernel, and got it working
faster than we got ours working,

469
00:23:37,871 --> 00:23:40,370
and got it to work very
nicely and solidly.

470
00:23:40,371 --> 00:23:42,271
His kernel is called "Linux".

471
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:45,970
The initial goal was
my very personal goal

472
00:23:45,971 --> 00:23:49,571
to be able to run a similar
environment on my computer

473
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:53,771
that I had grown used to at,
at the university computers.

474
00:23:54,371 --> 00:23:59,771
And I could not find anything
that suited me for that.

475
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:03,870
So having been doing computers
for all my life basically.

476
00:24:03,871 --> 00:24:06,971
At that point I decided
that I'll do my own.

477
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:11,471
Most of the inspiration early
on came from, from SunOS

478
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:16,370
which was what um, I was using
at the university at the time.

479
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,471
[ Which University? ]

480
00:24:17,472 --> 00:24:19,171
University of Helsinki in Finland.

481
00:24:20,071 --> 00:24:24,570
From 1991 to about 1993 was really

482
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,169
I guess the infancy period of Linux.

483
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,869
That was when it was still
only alpha or beta quality;

484
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:33,269
it was relatively unstable.

485
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,069
Although, even then it was
a good deal more stable

486
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:40,069
than a lot of what are now called
"production" operating systems.

487
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:44,070
Linus used the traditional tried-and-true
method of writing one program

488
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,970
that does the job,

489
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,269
and he got it to work.

490
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:52,969
quickly in fact faster than I
would have thought was possible.

491
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,969
The term for it is "monolithic",

492
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:03,870
which means that basically the OS
itself is one entity, indivisible.

493
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,869
uh, while in the microkernel,

494
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,370
the, the operating system
kernel is actually

495
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,169
uh, just a collection of servers that

496
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,969
do different things and then
they have a common protocol

497
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,170
for doing communication
between themselves.

498
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:26,269
[ So why is that... the GNU project that's had
so much lead-time, that's been doing this,

499
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,569
Why...Why is it that he was able to kinda
come in at the tail end so to speak ]

500
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:35,270
Well we actually started the GNU Hurd
not long before he started Linux.

501
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:40,170
And it happened though we chose a
design that's a very advanced design

502
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,769
in terms of the power gives you

503
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,370
but also turns out to
be very hard to debug.

504
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:51,769
We decided to divide up the kernel which
traditionally had been one program,

505
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,069
to divide it up into a
lot of smaller programs

506
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:58,070
that would send messages to each other
asynchronously to, to communicate.

507
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,969
The problem is that, that
style of programming

508
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,269
has a great deal of potential for bugs,

509
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,169
which are often very hard to figure
out because they depend on...

510
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:16,570
does this program send this message before
or after this one sends that message...

511
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:21,770
And the result was: it took us
years to get the thing to work.

512
00:26:22,769 --> 00:26:26,169
[ What is Linux's relationship
to the GNU project? ]

513
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:33,569
Well there's relationships to
GNU on kind of multiple levels.

514
00:26:34,069 --> 00:26:38,069
One is just the philosophical
level of thinking that

515
00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:41,169
"making your source
open is a good idea".

516
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:45,768
When Linus developed the kernel he
wasn't doing it for the GNU project.

517
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:47,268
He did it independently.

518
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:50,668
And he released it independently
and we didn't know about it.

519
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:52,968
But some of the people
who did know about it

520
00:26:52,969 --> 00:26:55,468
decided to look for what
else they could find

521
00:26:55,469 --> 00:26:58,768
to put together with that
kernel to make a whole system.

522
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:02,769
They looked around, and lo and behold
everything they needed was already available.

523
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:03,969
They looked around, and lo and behold
everything they needed was already available.

524
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:06,068
"What good fortune!" they thought.

525
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:08,368
But actually there was
no chance about it.

526
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:12,369
They had found all the pieces of the GNU
system which was missing just the kernel,

527
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:15,068
so when they put all that together

528
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:19,069
really they were fitting Linux
into the gap in the GNU system.

529
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:20,869
But they didn't know that.

530
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:25,269
There's a lot of these programs

531
00:27:25,969 --> 00:27:29,068
um, done by the Free
Softwares Foundation,

532
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:31,268
and done by other people like Linux.

533
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:35,269
And there's a symbiosis between
Linux and the programs

534
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:39,168
that the programs run on
Linux and at the same time

535
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:41,569
and they take the advantage
of Linux as a platform,

536
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,168
while Linux takes the
advantage of the programs

537
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:47,168
by just being able to use them.

538
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:48,769
[ What...What programs? ]

539
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:50,568
umm...

540
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:53,569
The main one is actually
the GNU C Compiler.

541
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:57,768
Which... Without a C compiler
it would not have been possible

542
00:27:57,769 --> 00:28:03,969
to make Linux or most of the
open progress available.

543
00:28:04,969 --> 00:28:07,168
Linux uses the GPL,

544
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:11,869
and I agree with a kind of
philosophy behind the GPL.

545
00:28:12,969 --> 00:28:17,668
That said the GPL itself is
not a very pretty document

546
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:22,268
which is probably just because no
lawyerese can ever be very pretty.

547
00:28:28,268 --> 00:28:32,268
I'd been playing around
with Linux for actually

548
00:28:32,468 --> 00:28:35,767
late '92 or early '93 for about a year.

549
00:28:35,768 --> 00:28:40,368
before I decided that it was to the point
where actually had everything that I needed

550
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:42,767
to really replace a Sun Workstation.

551
00:28:42,768 --> 00:28:46,768
And I was looking for a way to
have a Unix workstation at home

552
00:28:46,868 --> 00:28:50,868
at the time we used Sun Sparc
Stations in the office at Stanford.

553
00:28:52,368 --> 00:28:54,867
Those machines cost us
about 7,000 dollars.

554
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:57,367
Now I desperately wanted
a Unix machine at home!

555
00:28:57,368 --> 00:29:00,067
There's always a this thought
you get as a graduate student

556
00:29:00,068 --> 00:29:01,366
"Gee... if I could work at home!

557
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:03,268
Then I would be so much more productive,

558
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:06,368
I would graduate sooner because I
would finish my thesis sooner"

559
00:29:06,968 --> 00:29:10,467
Well, Well, is it true?
Well, you can judge.

560
00:29:10,468 --> 00:29:14,267
You know most people end up
spending a lot of their time

561
00:29:14,268 --> 00:29:15,767
becoming more productive so that

562
00:29:15,768 --> 00:29:18,967
they ever actually worked on their
thesis they'd finish it in a day.

563
00:29:18,968 --> 00:29:20,667
It takes a while sometimes.

564
00:29:20,668 --> 00:29:22,968
So I decided that I wanted
a Unix machine at home.

565
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:26,968
And I went out there I was able to
use Linux together with the PC.

566
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:30,967
For about 2,000 dollars,
I put together a system.

567
00:29:30,968 --> 00:29:33,867
That was one and a half
to two times faster

568
00:29:33,868 --> 00:29:36,567
than that 7,000 dollars
Sun Sparc Station.

569
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:38,267
It was absolutely amazing.

570
00:29:38,268 --> 00:29:41,267
I had one and a half to
two times the speed,

571
00:29:41,268 --> 00:29:43,967
at a third to fourth the price.

572
00:29:43,968 --> 00:29:45,267
Light bulbs went off.

573
00:29:45,268 --> 00:29:47,467
I knew there was an opportunity here.

574
00:29:47,468 --> 00:29:51,468
This was the chance to really do
something better than what Sun has done

575
00:29:51,568 --> 00:29:54,168
around Open Source and Linux.

576
00:29:54,568 --> 00:29:57,767
I called it Linux
originally as working name.

577
00:29:57,768 --> 00:30:01,267
And that was just because "Linus"

578
00:30:01,268 --> 00:30:02,468
and the "X" has to be there.

579
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:04,568
It's Unix. It's like a law.

580
00:30:05,868 --> 00:30:08,467
And...what happened was that...

581
00:30:08,468 --> 00:30:12,267
I initially thought that I
can't call it Linux publicly,

582
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,567
because it is just too egotistical.

583
00:30:14,568 --> 00:30:16,867
And that was before I had a big ego.
Right?

584
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:21,168
They thought they were taking a whole bunch
of components putting them around Linux

585
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:24,867
So they ended up calling the
whole thing "A Linux System"

586
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:27,566
and somehow that term caught on.

587
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:29,066
And the result is

588
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:33,066
there are now ten million people using

589
00:30:33,067 --> 00:30:34,566
this variant of the GNU system...

590
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:36,867
the GNU/Linux operating system.

591
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:38,967
And most of them don't know it.

592
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:43,267
[ Some people advocate it
be described as GNU/Linux.

593
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:46,766
I mean what's your thought on that?
I would say, justify or... ]

594
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:52,067
Well, I think it's justified but it is justified
if you actually make GNU distribution of Linux.

595
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:59,567
The same way that I think that Red Hat Linux
is fine or SuSE Linux, or Debian Linux.

596
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:03,466
Uh, because if you actually make
your own distribution of Linux

597
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:05,267
You get to name the thing.

598
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:09,367
But calling Linux in general "GNU
Linux" I think, is just ridiculous.

599
00:31:11,267 --> 00:31:13,067
I got involved in Fall '93.

600
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:19,566
Because I was sent a copy of the first
CD-ROM commercial Linux distribution,

601
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:22,967
which was called Yggdrasi
produced by Adam Richter.

602
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:25,066
And I got a copy because...

603
00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:28,966
I had been myself writing Free Software
for a long time since the early 80's.

604
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:31,567
I was actually one of the early
GNU contributors myself.

605
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:34,266
And I was absolutely astonished,

606
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,766
I was completely astonished.

607
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:39,767
Because I've been a software engineer
for nearly 15 years at that point.

608
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:42,666
And according to all the rules I knew...

609
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:46,366
about controlling complexity,
keeping a project group small,

610
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:49,166
having closely managed objectives.

611
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,466
Linux should have been a
disaster, and it wasn't.

612
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:53,566
Instead, it was something wonderful,

613
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:56,867
and I was determined to figure out how
they were getting a way with that.

614
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:02,366
In order for Linux to grow beyond the
world of the computer programmer

615
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:06,367
It needed a use, an application
that made it a must-have technology

616
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:08,367
That threshold was crossed

617
00:32:08,368 --> 00:32:12,167
with the development of a program
that made complex websites possible

618
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:15,067
That program is the Apache web server.

619
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,067
The killer app of Linux was
undoubtedly the Apache web server.

620
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:21,566
If you look at the history of Linux,

621
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:26,065
the adoption curve of Linux and the
adoption curve of the Internet

622
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:27,565
exactly track each other.

623
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:32,565
1993, which was when the Apache web
server project really got started,

624
00:32:32,566 --> 00:32:36,165
was also the beginnings of
the popular ISP explosion

625
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:39,965
when the Internet first became
a mass market commodity

626
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:42,365
and the idea of web-based
electronic commerce

627
00:32:42,366 --> 00:32:44,766
and, and mass communication became real.

628
00:32:45,366 --> 00:32:48,565
I think it was one of the first
applications that caused people to go

629
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,465
"Well, if I install Linux."

630
00:32:50,466 --> 00:32:53,466
I get some tangible benefit
from doing so, right?

631
00:32:53,966 --> 00:32:57,265
I mean, clearly there were a lot of
interesting applications on Linux

632
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,164
at, at the time, this being
maybe two or three years ago,

633
00:32:59,165 --> 00:33:01,066
when the root thing really
started to take off

634
00:33:01,067 --> 00:33:03,765
but there wasn't a driving, you know,

635
00:33:03,766 --> 00:33:05,066
you could almost say business case

636
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:07,965
for someone to use Linux versus using NT

637
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:11,265
until, I think, Apache and a lot of
the things that plugged into Apache

638
00:33:11,266 --> 00:33:12,765
enhanced Apache

639
00:33:12,766 --> 00:33:15,766
I mean, when you want to go out and build..
go out to build a server farm

640
00:33:16,266 --> 00:33:18,065
It was much more cost effective

641
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:18,666
cost effective

642
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:23,565
real dollar returns to build it on Linux and
Apache than was to build it on IIS and NT

643
00:33:23,566 --> 00:33:25,964
even if it meant that you have
to spend a little bit of money

644
00:33:25,965 --> 00:33:27,564
to train your staff to
learn how to use that or

645
00:33:27,565 --> 00:33:29,264
to find people who were knowledgeable.

646
00:33:29,265 --> 00:33:30,364
But the good news was that

647
00:33:30,365 --> 00:33:32,064
that knowledge wasn't very expensive

648
00:33:32,065 --> 00:33:33,766
because there were all those
college students out there

649
00:33:33,767 --> 00:33:37,165
who'd been using Linux for a long
time and were very familiar with it.

650
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:40,365
If you look at the trend
curves in web servers

651
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:44,065
Apache has steadily been gaining
a market share ever since

652
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:46,565
it's up to something like 66% now

653
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,765
It's steadily clobbered all of
the closed source competition

654
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:54,165
And that's because it's more reliable
it's more flexible, it's more extensible

655
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:57,466
It does what webmasters actually need

656
00:33:57,666 --> 00:34:00,465
and the combination of Apache and Linux

657
00:34:00,466 --> 00:34:02,766
found its way into a great
many commercial shops.

658
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:08,265
Essentially, Apache became the application
that motivated Internet service providers

659
00:34:08,266 --> 00:34:12,266
and e-commerce companies to choose
Linux over Microsoft's Windows.

660
00:34:13,466 --> 00:34:16,565
It would probably runs best
on Linux and on FreeBSD

661
00:34:16,566 --> 00:34:20,165
and the reason is the communities
around those operating systems

662
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:24,564
are also the communities that contribute
the most back to Apache, right?

663
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:28,564
And there were also the operating
systems that Internet service providers

664
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:30,365
started using very heavily as well

665
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:33,864
and Internet service providers
really liked Apache

666
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:35,265
because it allowed them to do

667
00:34:35,266 --> 00:34:38,564
a lot of different things that some
of the commercial web servers didn't

668
00:34:38,565 --> 00:34:42,565
such as the ability to host more than one
web site on a single box, which clearly

669
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:45,264
if you are an ISP and you
would have 40,000 users

670
00:34:45,265 --> 00:34:46,463
and they all want their web site,

671
00:34:46,464 --> 00:34:48,065
is gonna be pretty important to you.

672
00:34:49,365 --> 00:34:51,664
one of the key factors in
the growth of Linux was

673
00:34:51,665 --> 00:34:54,464
the creation of companies that
specialized in the distribution

674
00:34:54,465 --> 00:34:56,565
and support of the
Operating System itself

675
00:34:56,765 --> 00:35:00,164
Among these companies, Red Hat
Software is the best known.

676
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:03,564
Red Hat started as a
product of Marc Ewing

677
00:35:03,565 --> 00:35:05,164
while he was working at IBM.

678
00:35:05,165 --> 00:35:07,164
He wanted a little better
Linux distribution

679
00:35:07,165 --> 00:35:08,565
he started playing around,

680
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:12,565
found out he uh, he spent more time
maintaining his Linux distribution

681
00:35:12,765 --> 00:35:15,764
than he did uh, than he did
working on his new project.

682
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:19,464
So he uh, sort of started
the distribution himself

683
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:21,064
He met up with Bob Young,

684
00:35:21,065 --> 00:35:23,964
who at the time was running
company called ACC Bookstore

685
00:35:23,965 --> 00:35:27,364
which was a mail-order
PC Unix uh, catalog

686
00:35:27,365 --> 00:35:29,265
And Bob kind of knew
he wanted something,

687
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:31,364
you know, more his own to market,

688
00:35:31,365 --> 00:35:33,764
rather than reselling
other people's products

689
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:36,864
And he was fairly good
at marketing, and...

690
00:35:36,865 --> 00:35:38,265
Mark knew he needed some marketing help

691
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:41,265
because he was very good at the technical
parts, so they kinda got together

692
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:45,564
I started working with Red Hat in May of
1995, basically right out of NC State.

693
00:35:45,565 --> 00:35:50,565
along with Eric Troan who, me and him
combined make up employees #4 and #5.

694
00:35:51,465 --> 00:35:55,465
We actually reported to work in an
apartment that Mark Ewing used to live in

695
00:35:56,765 --> 00:36:00,664
We took it over as kind of the
development part of Red Hat software

696
00:36:00,665 --> 00:36:04,565
and stayed that way till about
November of 1995 when...

697
00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:07,364
a toilet we had in the
apartment kind of exploded,

698
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:08,765
flooded our downstairs neighbor

699
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,864
and she got little upset and...

700
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:14,065
the apartment folks found out we
were running a business there

701
00:36:14,066 --> 00:36:16,164
instead of actually living
there the same time

702
00:36:16,165 --> 00:36:17,565
So they decided to throw us out.

703
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:19,764
So at that point, we had
about a week to go find

704
00:36:19,765 --> 00:36:22,063
our first office, which we did

705
00:36:22,064 --> 00:36:24,064
and get ourselves moved in a hurry

706
00:36:34,564 --> 00:36:39,563
We started going in again '95 or
so to the venture capital firms,

707
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,463
asking, saying, there's
something happening here.

708
00:36:42,464 --> 00:36:44,563
There's a great business opportunity,

709
00:36:44,564 --> 00:36:48,564
to build the next Sun for open source.

710
00:36:48,764 --> 00:36:51,963
Well, the venture capitalists
looked at this and said

711
00:36:51,964 --> 00:36:54,463
"Gee, you are selling systems

712
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:56,563
the software is free.
This is kind of scary.

713
00:36:56,564 --> 00:36:59,063
We're not sure that we want
to put money in. And...

714
00:36:59,064 --> 00:37:02,463
by the way, we funded
other systems companies

715
00:37:02,464 --> 00:37:05,364
and it hasn't really panned out.
We are scared."

716
00:37:07,564 --> 00:37:10,663
I came to the US about 3 years ago,

717
00:37:10,664 --> 00:37:12,964
and the reason really was
that I'd been spending

718
00:37:14,264 --> 00:37:17,263
like 6 or 7 years at
Helsinki University.

719
00:37:17,264 --> 00:37:21,563
and decide it was time to see the real
world and not just university life.

720
00:37:21,564 --> 00:37:26,564
Especially this area had a lot of the
most interesting work being done.

721
00:37:28,064 --> 00:37:29,863
So I just decided that...

722
00:37:29,864 --> 00:37:33,864
let's try to move half
way across the world,

723
00:37:34,364 --> 00:37:35,564
and give this a try.

724
00:37:35,565 --> 00:37:37,563
And it's turned out pretty well.

725
00:37:37,564 --> 00:37:40,464
[ Ah...you see this as
temporary or long term? ]

726
00:37:40,964 --> 00:37:43,563
Well, we saw it as temporary at first.

727
00:37:43,564 --> 00:37:47,564
And I think it's certainly looking
like it's turning into long term.

728
00:37:47,864 --> 00:37:51,363
Our youngest daughter is
both US and Finnish citizen,

729
00:37:51,364 --> 00:37:52,864
because she was born here

730
00:37:53,464 --> 00:37:57,464
and the older one is speaking
both Swedish and English, so...

731
00:38:21,663 --> 00:38:25,663
The next major event was one
that I had directed hand in.

732
00:38:25,763 --> 00:38:28,562
I wrote a paper, called "The
Cathedral & the Bazaar".

733
00:38:28,563 --> 00:38:32,262
which was my observations,
my anthropological analysis

734
00:38:32,263 --> 00:38:34,563
of what it was that made the
open source world work.

735
00:38:34,564 --> 00:38:39,862
We didn't call it that then. We were still
using the term "Free Software" primarily.

736
00:38:39,863 --> 00:38:42,562
So it was my observation of what
made the Free Software world work

737
00:38:42,563 --> 00:38:46,863
and why we were able to produce
extremely high quality software

738
00:38:47,363 --> 00:38:51,363
in spite of constantly violating all of the
standard rules of software engineering

739
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,962
In that paper, I was
setting up a contrast

740
00:38:54,963 --> 00:38:57,162
between two different
styles of development,

741
00:38:57,163 --> 00:38:58,862
two opposed styles of development.

742
00:38:58,863 --> 00:39:04,462
One, which is the conventional
closed development style,

743
00:39:04,463 --> 00:39:06,962
which I called the "Cathedral" style.

744
00:39:06,963 --> 00:39:10,262
In that one, you have tight
specification of objectives.

745
00:39:10,263 --> 00:39:15,563
Small project groups which are run in a
fairly hierarchical authoritarian manner.

746
00:39:16,763 --> 00:39:19,263
And you have long release intervals

747
00:39:20,063 --> 00:39:22,962
On the other hand,what I identified
is happening in the Linux world

748
00:39:22,963 --> 00:39:28,563
was a much more peer to peer decentralized,
market or bazaar-like style,

749
00:39:28,963 --> 00:39:30,563
which has a very short release intervals

750
00:39:30,564 --> 00:39:35,562
and constant solicitation of feedback from
people who are formally outside of the project.

751
00:39:35,563 --> 00:39:39,563
A very intense peer review process.

752
00:39:39,863 --> 00:39:42,562
And the startling thing was
that the more I looked at this,

753
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:46,563
the more it seemed that trading
away all the supposed advantages

754
00:39:47,363 --> 00:39:49,462
of conventional closed development,

755
00:39:49,463 --> 00:39:53,462
for that one single advantage of
massive independent peer review

756
00:39:53,463 --> 00:39:57,463
actually seemed to win, actually
seemed to get you good results.

757
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:02,863
The reason Netscape is important is

758
00:40:02,864 --> 00:40:07,762
that they were the first large company
to participate in open source.

759
00:40:07,763 --> 00:40:09,562
We had Cygnus providing support,

760
00:40:09,563 --> 00:40:12,162
but we didn't really have much business.

761
00:40:12,163 --> 00:40:15,962
And Netscape went open source essentially
as a way to fight Microsoft,

762
00:40:15,963 --> 00:40:19,761
which was giving away Internet Explorer,

763
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:23,762
but not letting anyone else have the source
code, not letting companies collaborate.

764
00:40:24,762 --> 00:40:26,460
Working as part of the sales
force, I got a bit of,

765
00:40:26,461 --> 00:40:28,862
I got a good idea of.. of why
people bought our software

766
00:40:28,863 --> 00:40:32,862
and what it took to make our software successful
in the marketplace against competitive products.

767
00:40:34,262 --> 00:40:35,562
However, the problem was,

768
00:40:35,563 --> 00:40:39,161
we were seeing, as
that, as time went on,

769
00:40:39,162 --> 00:40:42,561
our software was uh,

770
00:40:42,562 --> 00:40:46,361
being competed against by other people's
software, particularly Microsoft's

771
00:40:46,362 --> 00:40:50,161
and as time went on, the price
of our software had to drop

772
00:40:50,162 --> 00:40:52,262
because other people were
giving their software away

773
00:40:52,263 --> 00:40:55,261
at no charge or at little charge.

774
00:40:55,262 --> 00:40:57,461
Now the real problem
was that they feared

775
00:40:57,462 --> 00:41:00,961
Microsoft would achieve a monopoly
lock on the browser market

776
00:41:00,962 --> 00:41:04,761
and they would then use
that monopoly lock to

777
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,361
pervert actually,

778
00:41:06,362 --> 00:41:10,361
the HTTP and HTML standards
that the web depends on.

779
00:41:10,362 --> 00:41:14,361
And once they had turned those
standards in to lock in devices,

780
00:41:14,362 --> 00:41:18,362
they could then use that control to drive
Netscape out of the server market,

781
00:41:18,762 --> 00:41:21,061
which was where it was
making its real money.

782
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,962
My concern was that as time went on,

783
00:41:25,462 --> 00:41:27,761
Netscape's business would be threatened,

784
00:41:27,762 --> 00:41:31,561
by the fact that we didn't have enough people
to do what we needed to do as a company

785
00:41:31,562 --> 00:41:35,462
in order to keep our software
viable in the marketplace.

786
00:41:35,962 --> 00:41:39,761
The Netscape release
happened in early 1998.

787
00:41:39,762 --> 00:41:43,762
And uh, I was told later, I
had no idea at the time,

788
00:41:44,762 --> 00:41:47,061
that it came about as a direct result of

789
00:41:47,062 --> 00:41:49,862
the right people having read
"The Cathedral and the Bazaar".

790
00:41:50,362 --> 00:41:54,061
"The Cathedral and the Bazaar",
the paper by Eric Raymond,

791
00:41:54,062 --> 00:41:59,662
was a significant influence on Netscape's
decision to release source code.

792
00:42:00,362 --> 00:42:02,561
It came as a complete shock to me.

793
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,761
I wasn't really ready for the thought

794
00:42:04,762 --> 00:42:06,962
that I was changing the
world even by accident.

795
00:42:07,662 --> 00:42:11,662
However he was not by any means the
only influence on that decision.

796
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,161
Uh, and not necessarily
the most important one,

797
00:42:14,162 --> 00:42:15,861
when all is said and done.

798
00:42:15,862 --> 00:42:18,061
As I said, Netscape,

799
00:42:18,062 --> 00:42:22,061
Netscape had already been talking about releasing
source code for quite some time before

800
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:24,661
anyone ever heard of Eric's paper.

801
00:42:25,061 --> 00:42:27,060
Linux Congress in early 1997,

802
00:42:27,061 --> 00:42:30,061
which was the first place
that I gave that paper.

803
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:34,361
And one of the people who heard it was
Tim O'Reilly of O'Reilly and Associates.

804
00:42:34,861 --> 00:42:37,760
And uh, he thought it
was pretty intriguing

805
00:42:37,761 --> 00:42:41,760
and he asked me to give it at his
first PERL conference, which was uh..

806
00:42:41,761 --> 00:42:44,361
later that year, in Fall of 97.

807
00:42:45,061 --> 00:42:46,961
And apparently what
happened, I was told later,

808
00:42:46,962 --> 00:42:49,461
although I had no idea that
this was happening at the time,

809
00:42:49,861 --> 00:42:55,960
uh is that some people from Netscape actually
heard the paper at the PERL conference

810
00:42:55,961 --> 00:42:59,961
and took those ideas back to Netscape
and they kind of lit a fire there.

811
00:43:00,061 --> 00:43:04,061
The role of my paper was essentially to
make the internal case at Netscape, uh

812
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:08,161
to make the business case for why
Netscape should release its source code.

813
00:43:08,361 --> 00:43:11,961
The paper was called "Netscape
Source Code As Netscape Product".

814
00:43:12,661 --> 00:43:16,661
uh.. a strange title, essentially
what the title meant was that

815
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,461
In my opinion we needed to

816
00:43:18,561 --> 00:43:22,360
think of source code not just as something
that was used in creating our products,

817
00:43:22,361 --> 00:43:24,561
but as something that was a
product in its own right.

818
00:43:24,961 --> 00:43:27,661
Something that customers might
use, other people might use.

819
00:43:28,161 --> 00:43:30,960
I then looked at what the
business models might be

820
00:43:30,961 --> 00:43:33,860
if we released source
code for our products.

821
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,560
How would we license them?

822
00:43:35,561 --> 00:43:39,561
How do we sell products
in this environment?

823
00:43:40,861 --> 00:43:44,060
Then I looked at the competition,
particularly Microsoft.

824
00:43:44,061 --> 00:43:46,660
What would they be likely to
do if we released source code?

825
00:43:46,661 --> 00:43:49,260
Was there some way they could
use our source code against us?

826
00:43:49,261 --> 00:43:53,261
I used Eric's paper as an example of how
distributed development could work,

827
00:43:54,061 --> 00:43:57,860
how a company could develop software
not just using their own people,

828
00:43:57,861 --> 00:44:00,661
but also working with
people on the Internet.

829
00:44:01,761 --> 00:44:05,361
And that's why I included a reference
to Eric's paper in my paper.

830
00:44:05,661 --> 00:44:07,160
Once my paper was circulated,

831
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:09,561
the people who read my paper
would naturally enough

832
00:44:09,562 --> 00:44:12,560
find a reference to Eric's
paper and read that as well.

833
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:15,161
[ And who was involved in making
that happen at Netscape? ]

834
00:44:16,161 --> 00:44:19,560
Primarily the person who made the
actual decision was Jim Barksdale.

835
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,459
And this turned out to
be important later.

836
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,259
That our big win, the big score

837
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,859
that gave us mainstream visibility
and credibility with investors

838
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:32,860
came not because of bottom up
evangelism from a bunch of engineers,

839
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,059
but because one strategist at the top

840
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,359
saw the potential power
of this method and

841
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,260
then essentially imposed that
vision on everyone underneath him.

842
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,559
When I completed the paper, I first
gave a copy to Mark Andreessen,

843
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,559
who was co-founder of Netscape
and was at the time one of,

844
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,360
on the senior management
team at Netscape.

845
00:44:51,361 --> 00:44:55,360
Mark then gave a copy of the paper to several
other people within Netscape management,

846
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,559
including Jim Barksdale.

847
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,659
I'm not sure exactly when Jim
and the other senior managers

848
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,760
made the actual decision,

849
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,760
I believe it was in
early January sometime.

850
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:10,360
Netscape actually announced that it was
gonna release the source code on Jan 22nd,

851
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:14,360
the same time it was going to
give Communicator away for free.

852
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,459
When Netscape decided to
release the source code,

853
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,859
people sort of got a
wake up notice and said

854
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:23,359
"Hey, maybe there is something to
this idea of releasing source code

855
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,860
and doing development with
people outside your company."

856
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:32,659
So Netscape's decision brought a lot of public
attention to the idea of Free Software,

857
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,959
what became known as Open Source,

858
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,459
and brought a lot of attention
to the Linux operating system,

859
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:41,460
which was one of the most prominent examples
of Open Source software at that time.

860
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,259
This is our first office,
Mountain View, California.

861
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,659
We moved here in early 1995.

862
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,559
This is 4,000 square feet.

863
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:01,159
It was an incredible leap of faith for us to
move out and take the company to our own office.

864
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,159
Now what's really important
about this place

865
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,759
is that this is the office where the
term "Open Source" was invented.

866
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,460
If you walk in to an executive's
office and say "Free Software",

867
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,559
OK, If you're lucky, the response
you'll get is something like,

868
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:23,058
"hmm, hmm, Free Software, must
be cheap, shoddy, worthless."

869
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:27,059
Uh, and if you're not lucky,
it has associations with, uh.

870
00:46:28,459 --> 00:46:32,459
with the Free Software Foundation's wholesale
attack on intellectual property rights,

871
00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:35,458
which regardless of what you
think about the ethics of that,

872
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:39,459
it's lousy marketing, it's not something
that businesses want to hear.

873
00:46:39,959 --> 00:46:42,358
So Eric Raymond knew
there was a problem.

874
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:44,558
We'd been calling this Free Software,

875
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,559
but people took the term "Free" and
associated with "Free of charge",

876
00:46:48,959 --> 00:46:51,658
they thought they couldn't
make money or couldn't sell,

877
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:53,559
which is exactly the wrong concept.

878
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:59,158
We wanted to get across the idea the software was
open and that the source code was available.

879
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:01,458
Very important pieces.

880
00:47:01,459 --> 00:47:05,158
We had this meeting at the VA offices
in Mountain View, where Eric,

881
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:11,658
myself, and Christine Peterson from Foresight
Institute joined us as well as some other people.

882
00:47:11,659 --> 00:47:14,559
Christine Peterson was
there by phone. uh..

883
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:20,059
Jon "Mad dog" Hall was
also there by phone. uh..

884
00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:24,758
And then Todd Anderson, who later
worked for SuSE for a while was there.

885
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:27,758
Sam Ockman who now runs
Penguin Computing was there.

886
00:47:27,759 --> 00:47:31,158
He was uh.. He was an
employee of VA at the time

887
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:34,058
Well, we came up with the
concept of Open Source,

888
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:37,358
we called Linus in fact and
asked Linus if he liked it.

889
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:40,558
He was interested, He liked it.

890
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,058
Eventually we came up with something
that replaced "Free Software".

891
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:44,659
That was the beginning of Open Source.

892
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,759
[ How did you chose
words "Open Source"? ]

893
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:51,559
You know, I think Christine Peterson was the
person who really came up with the idea.

894
00:47:51,959 --> 00:47:58,758
Uh, we wanted, again, the idea that the
source code was out there and it was open.

895
00:47:58,759 --> 00:48:00,159
There weren't many choices.

896
00:48:02,259 --> 00:48:06,259
Well, since the fist three recipients
have spoken for the Open Source movement,

897
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:10,758
I think I should speak about
the Free Software movement.

898
00:48:10,759 --> 00:48:14,258
The Open Source movement,
focuses on practical advantages

899
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:16,958
that you can get by having
a community of users

900
00:48:16,959 --> 00:48:20,958
who can cooperate on interchanging
and improving software.

901
00:48:21,058 --> 00:48:24,857
I agree completely with the
points they make about that.

902
00:48:24,858 --> 00:48:29,357
The reason why my views are different,
while I am in the Free Software movement

903
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:31,457
rather than the Open Source movement,

904
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:34,457
is that I believe there's something
more important at stake.

905
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:39,457
That freedom to cooperate with other
people, freedom to have a community...

906
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,657
is important for our quality of life.

907
00:48:41,658 --> 00:48:45,658
It's important for having a good
society that we can live in.

908
00:48:45,758 --> 00:48:51,758
And that that is in my view, even more important
than having powerful and reliable software.

909
00:48:52,258 --> 00:48:56,258
But I think some of the people
in the Free Software camp...

910
00:48:57,058 --> 00:49:00,458
are a little scared by
the commercialization.

911
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:06,458
And uh, you know, of course a
rebel is put off by success.

912
00:49:06,758 --> 00:49:10,357
uh.. I think that commercialization
is very important.

913
00:49:10,358 --> 00:49:13,157
We want to mainstream this software,

914
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:18,358
and I work with Richard Stallman who's
the gray haired man of Free Software,

915
00:49:19,858 --> 00:49:22,857
uh, on a regular basis, and I don't feel

916
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:26,357
I have any philosophical differences.

917
00:49:26,358 --> 00:49:29,457
me as author the Open
Source definition and

918
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:34,758
he is originator of free
software as an organized thing,

919
00:49:36,258 --> 00:49:39,257
except for one thing. Richard thinks
that all software should be free,

920
00:49:39,258 --> 00:49:43,957
and I think that free software and
non-free software should coexist.

921
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:45,658
That's the only difference we have.

922
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:49,257
Uh, we decided early on
that what we needed,

923
00:49:49,258 --> 00:49:53,258
a..a definition, we needed a kind of
meta-license to define the term "Open Source".

924
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:54,258
a, a definition, we needed a kind of
meta-license to define the term "Open Source".

925
00:49:54,259 --> 00:49:58,057
And what we came up with is a document
called "The Open Source Definition".

926
00:49:58,058 --> 00:50:03,258
It's derived from the Debian Free Software guidelines
that were originally written by Bruce Parens.

927
00:50:03,758 --> 00:50:07,057
I'd written the original
draft of that, uh,

928
00:50:07,058 --> 00:50:10,557
discussed it for a month
with the Debian developers

929
00:50:10,558 --> 00:50:13,257
Debian is a Linux distribution

930
00:50:13,258 --> 00:50:16,457
And made it their project policy

931
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:19,357
And Eric and I decided to relabel

932
00:50:20,157 --> 00:50:22,256
what we'd written for Debian

933
00:50:22,257 --> 00:50:23,557
as The Open Source definition

934
00:50:23,558 --> 00:50:25,857
and to say Open Source is a software

935
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:28,756
that gives you a list of nine rights

936
00:50:28,757 --> 00:50:31,057
which is in the Open Source definition.

937
00:50:32,057 --> 00:50:34,856
The first right is Free Redistribution

938
00:50:34,857 --> 00:50:37,256
This doesn't mean Free as in no price

939
00:50:37,257 --> 00:50:39,457
It means liberty

940
00:50:40,257 --> 00:50:43,056
Um, you have to be free to redistribute

941
00:50:43,057 --> 00:50:44,556
your software to someone else

942
00:50:44,557 --> 00:50:46,756
And actually no price is a side effect

943
00:50:46,757 --> 00:50:50,056
You can charge for that
redistribution or not

944
00:50:50,057 --> 00:50:52,257
It has to come with source code

945
00:50:52,557 --> 00:50:55,956
So that someone can maintain a program.

946
00:50:55,957 --> 00:50:58,657
If they go from a PC
to a Mac for example

947
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:02,056
they can change the software.

948
00:51:02,057 --> 00:51:04,456
Derived Works have to be possible

949
00:51:04,457 --> 00:51:07,156
If someone has to improve your program

950
00:51:07,157 --> 00:51:12,456
um, they should be able
to distribute the result

951
00:51:12,457 --> 00:51:15,956
uh, There is a provision about integrity

952
00:51:15,957 --> 00:51:17,257
of the author's source code

953
00:51:17,457 --> 00:51:22,356
which says that the author can
sort of maintain their honor

954
00:51:22,357 --> 00:51:24,157
and if you make a change

955
00:51:24,557 --> 00:51:26,856
you might have to change
the name of the program

956
00:51:26,857 --> 00:51:29,556
or mark out your change very clearly

957
00:51:29,557 --> 00:51:32,956
so that your change doesn't
reflect on the author

958
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:36,757
There is no discrimination
against people or groups.

959
00:51:36,857 --> 00:51:38,657
Uh, the example I usually use is

960
00:51:39,357 --> 00:51:41,856
You can't stop an abortion clinic

961
00:51:41,857 --> 00:51:45,056
or an anti-abortion activist
from using the software

962
00:51:45,057 --> 00:51:48,657
There is no discrimination
against fields of endeavor

963
00:51:49,057 --> 00:51:51,857
And that means the
software has to be usable

964
00:51:52,057 --> 00:51:55,356
in a business as well as in a school

965
00:51:55,357 --> 00:51:58,857
The license has to be distributable

966
00:51:58,957 --> 00:51:59,957
In other words

967
00:52:00,157 --> 00:52:03,356
I have to be able to give
that license to someone

968
00:52:03,357 --> 00:52:06,756
and that license then should work

969
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:09,456
if that someone gives it
to yet a third person

970
00:52:09,457 --> 00:52:13,256
The license can't be
specific to a product

971
00:52:13,257 --> 00:52:14,456
in other words

972
00:52:14,457 --> 00:52:19,655
if I distribute my software
on a Red Hat system

973
00:52:19,656 --> 00:52:21,255
the license can't say

974
00:52:21,256 --> 00:52:24,955
you can't distribute this
on a SuSE or Debian system

975
00:52:24,956 --> 00:52:28,455
The license can't
contaminate other software

976
00:52:28,456 --> 00:52:34,855
So if I distribute this on
a CD with another program

977
00:52:34,856 --> 00:52:38,055
It can't say that other
program must be free

978
00:52:38,056 --> 00:52:40,955
otherwise you can't
distribute my software

979
00:52:40,956 --> 00:52:43,655
And then the only other part of

980
00:52:43,656 --> 00:52:44,856
the Open Source definition

981
00:52:44,857 --> 00:52:47,655
is a list of licenses that were accepted

982
00:52:47,656 --> 00:52:51,555
And the ones that we
started with were the GPL

983
00:52:51,556 --> 00:52:54,655
which was actually the
example for a lot of

984
00:52:54,656 --> 00:52:58,155
what's in the Open Source
definition in the BSD license

985
00:52:58,156 --> 00:53:02,156
because software for BSD
system pre-existed Linux

986
00:53:07,956 --> 00:53:11,755
I think the next moment that
I thought was really pivotal

987
00:53:11,756 --> 00:53:13,955
was when the database
vendors flipped over

988
00:53:13,956 --> 00:53:15,955
which happened about three months sooner

989
00:53:15,956 --> 00:53:17,056
than I expected to

990
00:53:17,057 --> 00:53:19,455
and actually happened in
late July early August

991
00:53:19,456 --> 00:53:23,456
commitments to do one
ports from Oracle and

992
00:53:23,756 --> 00:53:26,555
and Sybase and the other
key database vendors.

993
00:53:26,556 --> 00:53:27,856
[ And why was that critical? ]

994
00:53:27,857 --> 00:53:29,955
because we knew that in order for

995
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:32,255
the open source story to be credible

996
00:53:32,256 --> 00:53:34,955
and especially in order for the
Linux story to be credible,

997
00:53:34,956 --> 00:53:37,955
we'd have to get commitments from
independent software vendors

998
00:53:37,956 --> 00:53:41,455
to do ports of their
applications to these platforms

999
00:53:41,456 --> 00:53:44,055
and I was actually kind of worried

1000
00:53:44,056 --> 00:53:46,456
I thought that we were in
a window of vulnerability

1001
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:49,855
between the time that we announced
the open source campaign

1002
00:53:49,856 --> 00:53:51,656
and the database vendors flipped over

1003
00:53:51,657 --> 00:53:54,255
that was the point at
which hostile action

1004
00:53:54,256 --> 00:53:57,955
by Microsoft or other
close-source software companies

1005
00:53:57,956 --> 00:53:59,256
that was the point in which

1006
00:53:59,257 --> 00:54:01,755
a serious marketing blitz
might have sunk us

1007
00:54:01,756 --> 00:54:05,755
but once the big database
vendors flipped over

1008
00:54:05,756 --> 00:54:08,255
that opened the way for other ISVs

1009
00:54:08,256 --> 00:54:10,156
that started the snow ball effect going

1010
00:54:10,157 --> 00:54:12,255
Every six months or so

1011
00:54:12,256 --> 00:54:13,856
I would come back to the
venture capitalists

1012
00:54:13,857 --> 00:54:15,554
I would show them the new numbers

1013
00:54:15,555 --> 00:54:17,654
showing more and more
people adopting Linux

1014
00:54:17,655 --> 00:54:19,454
and new people porting, new users

1015
00:54:19,455 --> 00:54:21,055
and I'd show them our customer list

1016
00:54:21,056 --> 00:54:24,354
And our customer list was
getting much more impressive

1017
00:54:24,355 --> 00:54:26,954
It was people like Cisco that
were beginning to appear

1018
00:54:26,955 --> 00:54:29,454
people like, you know,
those dot-com companies

1019
00:54:29,455 --> 00:54:31,854
were started to show up
on our customer list

1020
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:34,454
and eventually the venture capitalists

1021
00:54:34,455 --> 00:54:36,454
you know, they kept looking at it

1022
00:54:36,455 --> 00:54:38,255
they kept saying "Oh,
we can't quite do it"

1023
00:54:38,256 --> 00:54:41,454
Finally, Linus appeared
on the cover of Fortune

1024
00:54:41,455 --> 00:54:43,754
There was something
happening with Open Source

1025
00:54:43,755 --> 00:54:47,755
Well, at that point, the venture
capitalists couldn't ignore it

1026
00:54:48,155 --> 00:54:51,054
they just got sick of hearing
about Linux everywhere

1027
00:54:51,055 --> 00:54:52,955
and they got tired of me, just, you know

1028
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:56,354
showing it to them every, at that
point it was almost every week

1029
00:54:56,355 --> 00:54:58,954
So they uh, they decided
it was time to invest,

1030
00:54:58,955 --> 00:55:00,754
that there was something happening

1031
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:04,254
I announced Open Source to
the world on the Internet

1032
00:55:04,255 --> 00:55:07,654
I did a lot of the early...
administrative work of

1033
00:55:07,655 --> 00:55:11,154
starting the Open Source Initiative

1034
00:55:11,155 --> 00:55:12,954
and I think six months later

1035
00:55:12,955 --> 00:55:15,454
I was reading the words Open Source

1036
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:18,054
in the news all the time

1037
00:55:18,055 --> 00:55:20,354
and was totally astounded

1038
00:55:20,355 --> 00:55:21,555
And a year later, I believe

1039
00:55:21,556 --> 00:55:25,555
Microsoft was talking about
releasing some source code

1040
00:55:26,655 --> 00:55:28,854
And someone in the press
asked Steve Ballmer

1041
00:55:28,855 --> 00:55:31,454
if they were going to
open source their code

1042
00:55:31,455 --> 00:55:32,954
and Steve Ballmer said,

1043
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:36,955
"Well, Open Source means more than
just releasing the source code"

1044
00:55:37,255 --> 00:55:39,854
And I realized that he
had read my document

1045
00:55:39,855 --> 00:55:42,655
and understood it and was now
telling the press about this

1046
00:55:43,055 --> 00:55:46,054
Now if you are like
just a guy on the net

1047
00:55:46,055 --> 00:55:48,354
who's not doing this for a job at all

1048
00:55:48,355 --> 00:55:50,154
and you sort of write a manifesto

1049
00:55:50,155 --> 00:55:52,454
and it spreads out through the world

1050
00:55:52,455 --> 00:55:53,455
and a year later

1051
00:55:53,456 --> 00:55:56,554
the vice president of Microsoft
is talking about that

1052
00:55:56,555 --> 00:55:59,854
You'd think you were on
drugs, wouldn't you?

1053
00:55:59,855 --> 00:56:01,555
But that's what really happened

1054
00:56:07,455 --> 00:56:11,455
The Local Users Groups tend
to be more than an issue of

1055
00:56:13,355 --> 00:56:15,454
building a social network

1056
00:56:16,654 --> 00:56:22,254
especially getting people
familiarized with the issues

1057
00:56:23,854 --> 00:56:28,054
also just acting as a kind
of supporting network

1058
00:56:28,154 --> 00:56:33,353
for people who, who do not,
for example, have the ability

1059
00:56:33,354 --> 00:56:36,554
to pay for commercial support network

1060
00:56:36,754 --> 00:56:39,153
So one thing they're doing in this area

1061
00:56:39,154 --> 00:56:41,154
for example, is they're making these.

1062
00:56:41,354 --> 00:56:43,153
I think it's once a month

1063
00:56:43,154 --> 00:56:46,854
They're having install
fests, which means that

1064
00:56:47,054 --> 00:56:51,354
people who have problems getting
Linux installed on their machines

1065
00:56:51,554 --> 00:56:53,053
or have some issue, I mean

1066
00:56:53,054 --> 00:56:54,454
maybe they've installed Linux

1067
00:56:54,455 --> 00:56:57,053
but want to set up the
network in a specific way

1068
00:56:57,054 --> 00:56:59,153
can actually bring in their machines

1069
00:56:59,154 --> 00:57:00,254
to this users group meeting

1070
00:57:00,255 --> 00:57:03,853
And there's a lot of people
there willing to help

1071
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:07,854
who may have seen the
same problem before.

1072
00:57:16,854 --> 00:57:18,554
Well, actually things aren't so well.

1073
00:57:18,555 --> 00:57:21,753
I tried it earlier myself.
I had problems.

1074
00:57:21,754 --> 00:57:24,153
And so I came to this install fest where

1075
00:57:24,154 --> 00:57:25,853
all the gurus abound.

1076
00:57:25,854 --> 00:57:29,753
Hopefully I'll have better
luck getting it in.

1077
00:57:29,754 --> 00:57:32,553
Instead of having, uh,
sending e-mails, or

1078
00:57:32,554 --> 00:57:34,454
writing to news groups on the Internet

1079
00:57:34,455 --> 00:57:36,954
and waiting several days
for the answers sometimes

1080
00:57:36,955 --> 00:57:39,953
it's easy to come here
and find other people

1081
00:57:39,954 --> 00:57:41,154
who might know about your problem

1082
00:57:41,155 --> 00:57:43,053
and may be able to help you

1083
00:57:43,054 --> 00:57:44,154
And hopefully within a few hours

1084
00:57:44,155 --> 00:57:46,353
you have your machine installed

1085
00:57:46,354 --> 00:57:50,354
Originally I wanted to it
install on uh, my larger laptop

1086
00:57:50,554 --> 00:57:52,254
and so I just did a search on the net

1087
00:57:52,255 --> 00:57:56,254
and found where there were
resources to get help

1088
00:57:56,854 --> 00:57:58,553
And um, I'm here today

1089
00:57:58,554 --> 00:58:02,253
cause I'm trying to put Linux
on this little guy right here.

1090
00:58:02,254 --> 00:58:04,553
just a Toshiba Libretto

1091
00:58:04,554 --> 00:58:07,153
It's not a easiest thing
in the world to do

1092
00:58:07,154 --> 00:58:09,753
because it's a weird
piece of hardware, so...

1093
00:58:09,754 --> 00:58:11,754
Any chairs around here?

1094
00:58:23,653 --> 00:58:25,453
I think that Department of Justice case

1095
00:58:25,454 --> 00:58:27,453
has made people aware of the fact that

1096
00:58:27,454 --> 00:58:30,452
you should at least look for
alternatives to Microsoft.

1097
00:58:30,453 --> 00:58:34,453
and maybe Microsoft isn't the
American dream after all

1098
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:36,453
and that kind of shifting perception

1099
00:58:37,753 --> 00:58:39,552
you can very clearly see

1100
00:58:39,553 --> 00:58:43,553
that people just took
Microsoft for granted

1101
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:46,453
and maybe they're still
buying Microsoft but at least

1102
00:58:46,454 --> 00:58:49,352
they're kind of more aware
of the issue these days

1103
00:58:49,353 --> 00:58:52,052
Microsoft actually uses Linux as defense

1104
00:58:52,053 --> 00:58:53,451
They used Linux to ground a claim

1105
00:58:53,452 --> 00:58:54,453
that they don't have a monopoly

1106
00:58:54,454 --> 00:58:57,552
because Linux could essentially

1107
00:58:57,553 --> 00:58:59,453
push them off their
catbird seat at any time.

1108
00:58:59,454 --> 00:59:02,252
It was a very ingenious
argument, totally specious

1109
00:59:02,253 --> 00:59:04,052
because it didn't

1110
00:59:04,053 --> 00:59:06,252
do anything to answer the charge

1111
00:59:06,253 --> 00:59:07,853
that they had previously engaged in

1112
00:59:07,854 --> 00:59:10,552
bullying and various
anti-competitive practices.

1113
00:59:10,553 --> 00:59:12,152
but it was clever of them

1114
00:59:12,153 --> 00:59:14,653
And, in an event, the
judge didn't buy it

1115
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:19,552
While ordinarily we in the Linux
community are rather worried about

1116
00:59:19,553 --> 00:59:21,952
letting Microsoft become the issue,

1117
00:59:21,953 --> 00:59:27,152
but there was a Slashdot
article about December of '98

1118
00:59:27,153 --> 00:59:32,952
where a fellow named Matt at the
noodle had pointed out that...

1119
00:59:32,953 --> 00:59:35,952
the, a gentleman in Australia has
managed to receive a refund for

1120
00:59:35,953 --> 00:59:39,952
the unused copy of Windows
that came with his computer.

1121
00:59:39,953 --> 00:59:44,452
So he declared the 19th of
January, was it January?

1122
00:59:44,453 --> 00:59:46,853
err, no, It was February. It was February.
Oh, I'm sorry, the 19th of February...

1123
00:59:46,854 --> 00:59:48,952
he declared 19th of February
Windows Refund Day.

1124
00:59:48,953 --> 00:59:51,253
and he encouraged everyone to go
to the computer manufacturers,

1125
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:54,252
and return their unused
copies of Windows...

1126
00:59:54,253 --> 00:59:57,452
as it was specified in the Windows
End-User License Agreement.

1127
00:59:57,453 --> 01:00:00,552
It's important to remember that in
the License itself, it says that

1128
01:00:00,553 --> 01:00:05,452
you can receive a refund if
you don't use the software,

1129
01:00:05,453 --> 01:00:08,452
and that the manufacture is
bound by law to do this...

1130
01:00:08,453 --> 01:00:10,452
or it was bond by contract.

1131
01:00:10,453 --> 01:00:13,452
and we found if you called up these
manufactures, they basically said...

1132
01:00:13,453 --> 01:00:15,651
"Stop bothering me kid."
and hung up on you.

1133
01:00:15,652 --> 01:00:18,651
We didn't really wanna sort
of giving out our location,

1134
01:00:18,652 --> 01:00:21,851
or where we were going to meet, until...

1135
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:22,852
you know, the very last seconds.

1136
01:00:22,853 --> 01:00:26,251
What we did is, we have people meet
at the place where we could control

1137
01:00:26,252 --> 01:00:27,952
in the different towns around here.

1138
01:00:27,953 --> 01:00:31,451
So I was the San Jose marshal,
and I believe Nick you were...

1139
01:00:31,452 --> 01:00:33,851
I was..., Rick Moen and
I did San Francisco.

1140
01:00:33,852 --> 01:00:34,352
Right

1141
01:00:34,452 --> 01:00:38,451
and so we had maps there and we handed
them off everybody who was coming.

1142
01:00:38,452 --> 01:00:42,451
Well, we actually met at a Denny's That's
just outside the Foster City limits...

1143
01:00:42,452 --> 01:00:44,051
Foster City city limits,

1144
01:00:44,052 --> 01:00:47,451
which meant also just outside of
Foster City Police jurisdiction,

1145
01:00:47,452 --> 01:00:51,051
which meant any, any incidents
that happened at the meeting point

1146
01:00:51,052 --> 01:00:53,351
happened in the
jurisdiction of San Mateo,

1147
01:00:53,352 --> 01:00:56,951
and if they told us they get lost, we'd say,
"Fine, we are going to Foster city. Bye."

1148
01:00:56,952 --> 01:01:00,452
It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard
method of avoiding the cops, so...

1149
01:01:01,952 --> 01:01:05,451
Well actually, originally we marched
on the other side of this building.

1150
01:01:05,452 --> 01:01:09,451
We marched around and up onto the
parking structure that's up there,

1151
01:01:09,452 --> 01:01:12,351
and that's where Microsoft had a
reception laid out for us with

1152
01:01:12,352 --> 01:01:14,451
drinks and a big
sign that said...

1153
01:01:14,452 --> 01:01:16,851
"Microsoft Welcomes the
Open Source Community".

1154
01:01:16,852 --> 01:01:20,852
and the local news cameras got shots of
Eric Raymond and Microsoft representative.

1155
01:01:21,952 --> 01:01:24,852
Microsoft's story seems
to mostly be that...

1156
01:01:24,952 --> 01:01:29,451
...this was not an issue for
Microsoft, rather from the OEMs.

1157
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:32,751
So we all needed to go back to our
computer manufacturers and try yet again

1158
01:01:32,752 --> 01:01:34,851
to try and get refund from them.

1159
01:01:34,852 --> 01:01:36,552
We responded to them saying, you know,

1160
01:01:36,553 --> 01:01:40,552
that we tried that and it's not possible, we
need Microsoft to take action at this point.

1161
01:01:40,852 --> 01:01:43,451
And they just repeated the tag
line over and over again...

1162
01:01:43,452 --> 01:01:46,452
"you need to go to the OEMs and
manufacturers and get your refunds there."

1163
01:01:46,952 --> 01:01:52,452
We had about 150 people, probably half
of which had signs and such, so..

1164
01:01:52,952 --> 01:01:56,452
Well, we ended up actually
right in this courtyard here.

1165
01:01:56,952 --> 01:02:00,451
Basically we originally
met, gathered outside,

1166
01:02:00,452 --> 01:02:05,451
various people sent groups in, people from
FreeBSD camp sent a couple of folks in.

1167
01:02:05,452 --> 01:02:09,452
We had Eric Raymond and Chris
actually tried to go up eventually.

1168
01:02:09,752 --> 01:02:12,051
They had blocked the elevator off to us.

1169
01:02:12,052 --> 01:02:13,252
[ Where are the offices? ]

1170
01:02:13,253 --> 01:02:15,451
The offices are right up
here on the 9th floor.

1171
01:02:17,451 --> 01:02:19,551
We got some really nice press out of it.

1172
01:02:19,751 --> 01:02:20,951
and we think as a result

1173
01:02:20,952 --> 01:02:24,951
Toshiba made it possible for you to buy
laptop without the operating system on it.

1174
01:02:25,651 --> 01:02:27,451
So, it's a small victory, but...

1175
01:02:27,551 --> 01:02:31,551
Well, even now, companies
such as IBM and...

1176
01:02:31,651 --> 01:02:33,951
a lot of other computer
manufacturers are allowing you...

1177
01:02:33,952 --> 01:02:36,551
now to buy machines that
don't have Windows on them.

1178
01:02:45,451 --> 01:02:48,250
When I was a kid and I went to school,

1179
01:02:48,251 --> 01:02:50,550
the teachers were trying
to teach us to share.

1180
01:02:50,551 --> 01:02:52,550
They said if you bring some candy,

1181
01:02:52,551 --> 01:02:55,650
you can't eat it all yourself,
you gotta share with other kids.

1182
01:02:55,651 --> 01:03:01,250
But now the administration says teachers should
be teaching kids to say yes to licensing.

1183
01:03:01,251 --> 01:03:04,250
If you bring some software to school, "Oh!
No, don't share it...

1184
01:03:04,251 --> 01:03:08,251
...sharing means you're pirate,
sharing means you'll be put in jail."

1185
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:12,451
That's not the way society should work.
We need the good will,

1186
01:03:13,451 --> 01:03:17,451
the willingness to help other people
at least when it's not too hard,

1187
01:03:17,751 --> 01:03:19,950
because that's the basis of society,

1188
01:03:19,951 --> 01:03:22,450
that's the fundamental resource,

1189
01:03:22,451 --> 01:03:26,350
That gives us a society instead
of a dog-eat-dog jungle.

1190
01:03:26,351 --> 01:03:27,551
[ So what about people say if that if

1191
01:03:27,552 --> 01:03:30,650
you have rampant piracy and
eliminate the profit motive and...

1192
01:03:30,651 --> 01:03:32,451
...and creative works, software.
Will not... ]

1193
01:03:32,452 --> 01:03:35,450
Well, they were on both counts.
For one thing,

1194
01:03:35,451 --> 01:03:39,450
people are making a profit
from developing Free Software,

1195
01:03:39,451 --> 01:03:44,251
but for another, the freedom to
have a community is more important.

1196
01:03:44,451 --> 01:03:48,250
[ People that look at, casually look at
Open Source Free Software and think...

1197
01:03:48,251 --> 01:03:51,450
Well, because you are supposed to share
and do it for people's good will,

1198
01:03:51,451 --> 01:03:53,851
Doesn't that seem someone communist.
What's your response? ]

1199
01:03:53,852 --> 01:03:57,650
Absolutely nonsense, it makes me
really angry when people do that.

1200
01:03:57,651 --> 01:04:02,451
Well, back in, back in 1989, actually
communism would have been a compliment.

1201
01:04:02,651 --> 01:04:05,051
the word people were using
at that time was "crazy",

1202
01:04:05,052 --> 01:04:06,950
and I want them to use capitalism.

1203
01:04:06,951 --> 01:04:10,451
Communism is an ideology
that forces people to share.

1204
01:04:10,551 --> 01:04:14,150
If you don't share, you get
thrown in jail or killed.

1205
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:20,450
In 1990, we got a visit from a director
of an institute in uh, Moscow University,

1206
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:24,450
and actually I saw him in
Helsinki just 2 weeks ago,

1207
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:27,450
but in any event, he came by,

1208
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:31,449
and Richard Stallman had
suggested that he visit Cygnus,

1209
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:35,449
because he was interested in and
understanding how the Free Software model...

1210
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:40,550
might apply to stimulating entrepreneurial
innovation in Russia of all places,

1211
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:44,750
and we had been kind of secretive
about our business plan,

1212
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:47,649
because you know, we were'nt
really sure it's gonna work,

1213
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:50,449
we didn't want to look
too stupid if it failed.

1214
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:52,749
But I was very very open with him.

1215
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:56,650
The more I told him, the more he
started to shake his head like this,

1216
01:04:56,850 --> 01:05:00,449
and I finally said, you
know, "What's wrong?"

1217
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:05,450
And he said, "This sounds to much like
communism to be successful in Russia."

1218
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:11,449
You got to go a Gulag and end up in a mass
grave with a bullet in the back of your head.

1219
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:15,450
Open Source is not communism
because it does'nt force people.

1220
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:20,450
Carl Marx did not invent
helping your neighbor.

1221
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:26,250
It's not communist to have a commons,

1222
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:33,050
A commons existed long before communism
as a philosophy of government.

1223
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:35,949
there are many commons in our lives,

1224
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:38,049
For example, we drive on the highway,

1225
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:41,449
something that is maintained
for our common good.

1226
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:45,450
Actually labeling our business model...

1227
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:48,149
means that it misses the
point a little bit.

1228
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:49,250
whether it's communist, or
whether it's capitalist,

1229
01:05:49,251 --> 01:05:52,849
the label doesn't matter,
the real question is,

1230
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:56,449
how much value can you deliver,
how scalable is the business,

1231
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:59,749
what kind of problems, what kind of of
rate of innovation can you sustain.

1232
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:03,450
and then, however you want to label
that, it's really up to you.

1233
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:08,050
The Revolution goes Prime Time.

1234
01:06:32,049 --> 01:06:33,548
A lot of people described,

1235
01:06:33,549 --> 01:06:36,448
that August LinuxWorld as
"Linux's coming-out party",

1236
01:06:36,449 --> 01:06:40,449
Linus Torvalds was very funny about
this, he said, "What? Was Linux gay?"

1237
01:06:42,449 --> 01:06:45,449
But some people said "Yeah,
that was our debutante ball."

1238
01:06:46,049 --> 01:06:47,149
That was when the...

1239
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:51,149
Linux Gods, and the hardware hackers
really got it together with the suits.

1240
01:07:01,249 --> 01:07:04,248
At 3pm on August 10th 1999,

1241
01:07:04,249 --> 01:07:07,848
Linus Torvalds delivered the
keynote address at LinuxWorld.

1242
01:07:07,849 --> 01:07:12,349
The crowds of 6000 people
began lining up at 12 noon.

1243
01:07:31,949 --> 01:07:34,448
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome Larry Augustin...

1244
01:07:34,449 --> 01:07:40,249
LinuxWorld Conference Chair and
President and CEO of VA Linux Systems.

1245
01:07:48,449 --> 01:07:51,448
These guys have to clap, I pay them.

1246
01:07:51,449 --> 01:07:55,748
Thank you all for being here, looks
like it's been a great show so far.

1247
01:07:55,749 --> 01:08:02,049
If you'll indulge me for a moment, I'm going
to try to avoid the glare of the lights.

1248
01:08:02,249 --> 01:08:05,448
I still think there's lots of people,
even though this is the 2nd show,

1249
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:08,948
I still think there's lots of
people who don't quite get...

1250
01:08:08,949 --> 01:08:11,448
...what it is that's so
exciting about Linux.

1251
01:08:11,449 --> 01:08:13,448
So there is a great show
going on next door,

1252
01:08:13,449 --> 01:08:16,147
there's huge exhibits and everything,

1253
01:08:16,148 --> 01:08:21,047
but it's the people out here that are
real contributors, not those companies.

1254
01:08:21,048 --> 01:08:23,947
The person on next I know you all know,

1255
01:08:23,948 --> 01:08:26,847
so I don't have to give anything
in the way as introduction.

1256
01:08:26,848 --> 01:08:30,447
Ladies and gentlemen, I
give you, Linus Torvalds.

1257
01:08:30,448 --> 01:08:33,448
Linus

1258
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:39,448
Thanks.

1259
01:08:42,448 --> 01:08:44,448
Calm down.

1260
01:08:49,948 --> 01:08:51,947
Calm down.

1261
01:08:51,948 --> 01:08:53,447
Say "oooo".

1262
01:08:53,448 --> 01:08:54,448
yes.

1263
01:08:54,648 --> 01:08:58,047
I don't want to just give
one of my normal talks,

1264
01:08:58,048 --> 01:08:59,547
because I find them boring,

1265
01:08:59,548 --> 01:09:03,548
probably by now most of you find them boring
too because you've heard them like 10 times.

1266
01:09:04,448 --> 01:09:07,147
But after the technical updates,
we will actually try...

1267
01:09:07,148 --> 01:09:11,648
...whether we can do a question and
answer session with 5,000 people,

1268
01:09:11,748 --> 01:09:14,448
or how many of you there are there.

1269
01:09:15,448 --> 01:09:17,647
and it may not actually work out,

1270
01:09:17,648 --> 01:09:21,347
because one of the 5,000
people is really loud.

1271
01:09:21,348 --> 01:09:22,448
The one thing I will do,

1272
01:09:22,449 --> 01:09:26,448
which I always do in all my
talks is the gratitude thing,

1273
01:09:26,848 --> 01:09:29,947
I want to kind of acknowledge
the fact that...

1274
01:09:29,948 --> 01:09:32,447
...I'm obviously not been
alone in doing Linux.

1275
01:09:32,448 --> 01:09:34,447
RHAT IPO: On August 11, 1999

1276
01:09:34,448 --> 01:09:38,147
Red Hat Software became the first
Linux company to go public.

1277
01:09:38,148 --> 01:09:40,147
Red Hat, up 228%

1278
01:09:40,148 --> 01:09:43,247
this is the IPO that
everybody was waiting for.

1279
01:09:43,248 --> 01:09:45,748
They of course are behind the
Linux operating software.

1280
01:09:52,448 --> 01:09:56,448
R-H-A-T, I know

1281
01:09:57,448 --> 01:09:58,448
All I've gotten today,

1282
01:09:58,449 --> 01:10:01,847
are comments about what the
stock price is, all morning,

1283
01:10:01,848 --> 01:10:05,347
you know it was at 41, it
was at 42, it was at 47,

1284
01:10:05,348 --> 01:10:08,247
it was at 53, it was at 51...

1285
01:10:08,248 --> 01:10:12,046
Every machine as far as I
can tell on the show floor

1286
01:10:12,047 --> 01:10:16,047
is pointed to their e-trade accounts or their
broker accounts, they know the Red Hat's price

1287
01:10:16,847 --> 01:10:19,346
I can't believe this. 47

1288
01:10:19,347 --> 01:10:21,146
I just heard 53.

1289
01:10:21,147 --> 01:10:22,146
Oh, boy.

1290
01:10:22,147 --> 01:10:24,146
Hang on, I didn't buy it.

1291
01:10:24,147 --> 01:10:25,546
You didn't buy?

1292
01:10:25,547 --> 01:10:27,746
No, no, I didn't buy.

1293
01:10:27,747 --> 01:10:29,446
I should've bought, but uh...

1294
01:10:29,447 --> 01:10:31,046
No no, that's great.

1295
01:10:31,047 --> 01:10:32,546
If it's... if it's....

1296
01:10:32,547 --> 01:10:33,846
You guys don't know?

1297
01:10:33,847 --> 01:10:34,946
Well, you know

1298
01:10:34,947 --> 01:10:37,246
Red Hat being successful
as just means that

1299
01:10:37,247 --> 01:10:40,747
It legitimizes Linux So it's
much easier for us to go out

1300
01:10:57,447 --> 01:11:00,446
Rob Malda (CmdrTaco) ...
on the Red Hat IPO

1301
01:11:00,447 --> 01:11:02,446
It's kind of been a little bit divided.

1302
01:11:02,447 --> 01:11:03,445
You've got a lot of people

1303
01:11:03,446 --> 01:11:04,445
that are pretty hardcore and

1304
01:11:04,446 --> 01:11:05,747
And they're kind of offended by that

1305
01:11:05,748 --> 01:11:08,846
you know, cause they work really
hard, they are not really getting...

1306
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:11,346
maybe they fair share out of that.

1307
01:11:11,347 --> 01:11:12,545
Some people do get ticked.

1308
01:11:12,546 --> 01:11:13,645
and you know the thing

1309
01:11:13,646 --> 01:11:15,847
that you see that on a lot of mailing lists
or on Slashdot you'll read, you know

1310
01:11:15,848 --> 01:11:21,647
This guy is really mad because he didn't get
chance to, he's didn't get a chance to do...

1311
01:11:22,747 --> 01:11:24,147
to get stock from Red Hat

1312
01:11:24,148 --> 01:11:29,147
He didn't get a chance to get... to get a
job from this other company, you know.

1313
01:11:29,647 --> 01:11:33,146
But the, the kind of the
shocking secret there is that,

1314
01:11:33,147 --> 01:11:36,246
Most the really hardcore guys, you
know, they don't care so much.

1315
01:11:36,247 --> 01:11:38,045
The guys that are kind of
really down in trenches.

1316
01:11:38,046 --> 01:11:40,447
They're writing this code
because they need this code.

1317
01:11:40,747 --> 01:11:42,846
If we could invite Richard Stallman

1318
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:46,246
who's the founder of the
Free Software Association

1319
01:11:46,247 --> 01:11:48,147
and Tim Ney, who's the
managing director.

1320
01:11:48,148 --> 01:11:51,446
There we go.  Hahahahaha

1321
01:11:51,447 --> 01:11:53,647
Ah, here it is.

1322
01:11:54,447 --> 01:11:59,246
Now, Richard, I saw you playing your recorder
at, in Paris at that Linux conference

1323
01:11:59,247 --> 01:12:00,647
But I didn't have audio tracks.

1324
01:12:00,648 --> 01:12:02,846
So would you them to add
audio to their, uh...

1325
01:12:02,847 --> 01:12:04,846
Video downstream next time

1326
01:12:04,847 --> 01:12:07,046
Uh..I don't have any control over that

1327
01:12:07,047 --> 01:12:11,046
unfortunately those things can only
be done with non-free software.

1328
01:12:14,546 --> 01:12:17,845
We'll give you the award,
and before you say a word,

1329
01:12:17,846 --> 01:12:22,746
we'll have a Tim and yourself hold up a
little representation of the contribution

1330
01:12:22,946 --> 01:12:25,245
towards the Free Software Association.

1331
01:12:25,246 --> 01:12:29,246
So, very ironic things have happened,

1332
01:12:29,646 --> 01:12:32,445
but nothing to match this

1333
01:12:32,446 --> 01:12:36,045
Giving the Linus Tovarlds award
to the Free Software Foundation

1334
01:12:36,046 --> 01:12:40,046
is sort of like giving the Han
Solo award to the rebel fleet.

1335
01:12:44,646 --> 01:12:50,446
You see, some of you may not
realize how far that analogy goes.

1336
01:12:52,246 --> 01:12:55,745
But actually let me tell you
how this, how we got here.

1337
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:57,245
see what happened is,

1338
01:12:57,246 --> 01:12:59,845
15 years ago, if you
wanted to use a computer,

1339
01:12:59,846 --> 01:13:03,846
the only way you could do it was
to, was with proprietary software,

1340
01:13:04,746 --> 01:13:07,445
software that divides and
subjugates the users.

1341
01:13:07,446 --> 01:13:09,345
And most people just...

1342
01:13:09,346 --> 01:13:10,646
A lot of people didn't like it.

1343
01:13:10,647 --> 01:13:12,146
But they saw no alternative.

1344
01:13:12,147 --> 01:13:15,945
But some of us were determined
to make an alternative.

1345
01:13:15,946 --> 01:13:19,946
And we said we're gonna develop
a free operating system,

1346
01:13:20,046 --> 01:13:21,845
a free software operating system

1347
01:13:21,846 --> 01:13:27,546
that will give users the chance to have
freedom while they use their computers.

1348
01:13:28,146 --> 01:13:30,745
Now a lot of people said,
"Well, it's a nice idea

1349
01:13:30,746 --> 01:13:33,045
but it's so hard, you'll
never get it done,

1350
01:13:33,046 --> 01:13:36,945
so I don't wanna participate, I don't
believe you can ever get it done."

1351
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:39,745
But luckily not everybody said that.

1352
01:13:39,746 --> 01:13:43,645
And clearly, we knew we would
eventually get the kernel done.

1353
01:13:43,646 --> 01:13:44,945
But as it happens.

1354
01:13:44,946 --> 01:13:48,045
somebody else did a better
kernel before we did.

1355
01:13:48,046 --> 01:13:51,645
Now in the old days, we
had an overall strategy

1356
01:13:51,646 --> 01:13:55,245
from calling people's attention
to the importance of freedom

1357
01:13:55,246 --> 01:13:59,246
To the freedom they can have, or not
have, when they use a computer.

1358
01:13:59,946 --> 01:14:02,046
Well what can we do about it?
As far as I can tell,

1359
01:14:02,047 --> 01:14:08,046
the only workable way of trying to change
this make that strategy work again

1360
01:14:08,446 --> 01:14:14,245
is to, spread the word that the operating
system you're using is actually the GNU system.

1361
01:14:14,345 --> 01:14:16,545
Somewhat modified of course.

1362
01:14:17,645 --> 01:14:19,544
And when people know this,

1363
01:14:19,545 --> 01:14:23,044
they'll take a look at the reasons
we developed this system.

1364
01:14:23,045 --> 01:14:24,944
They'll think about these issues.

1365
01:14:24,945 --> 01:14:27,744
And some of them will decide they agree.

1366
01:14:27,745 --> 01:14:31,044
So I ask people, please tell the
people this is the GNU system.

1367
01:14:31,045 --> 01:14:35,045
It's the combination of GNU and
Linux so we can call it GNU/Linux

1368
01:14:41,045 --> 01:14:44,344
[ So Larry, when you were at Stanford
8, 9 years ago during your Ph.D

1369
01:14:44,345 --> 01:14:46,045
did you ever think you'd
be in this position? ]

1370
01:14:46,046 --> 01:14:46,944
No

1371
01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:48,344
[ All kidding aside. ]

1372
01:14:48,345 --> 01:14:50,244
No I had no idea honestly

1373
01:14:50,245 --> 01:14:53,043
[ What did you think you would be when
you were finished up with your Ph.D? ]

1374
01:14:53,044 --> 01:14:54,445
You know that's a good question,

1375
01:14:54,446 --> 01:14:56,744
I really didn't have
a good idea, I mean.

1376
01:14:56,745 --> 01:15:00,044
Here we are, on this huge show floor.

1377
01:15:00,045 --> 01:15:03,044
There are people just
going crazy about Linux.

1378
01:15:03,045 --> 01:15:06,444
We had 6,200 people crammed into a room

1379
01:15:06,445 --> 01:15:09,744
to see the Linux, Linus
speak last night.

1380
01:15:09,745 --> 01:15:11,344
Here we are, with, you know,

1381
01:15:11,345 --> 01:15:14,044
all of these huge venders
all over the show.

1382
01:15:14,045 --> 01:15:17,144
I..It's, just, you have no idea
that this is gonna happen.

1383
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:19,944
I mean this is just this little
operating system that we're happy with.

1384
01:15:19,945 --> 01:15:21,944
that a few people cared about, you know,

1385
01:15:21,945 --> 01:15:23,945
I thought I'd have a nice
little consulting business.

1386
01:15:23,946 --> 01:15:25,344
And here I am suddenly,

1387
01:15:25,345 --> 01:15:27,844
with all of this huge show going on.

1388
01:15:27,845 --> 01:15:28,845
It's just incredible.

1389
01:15:28,846 --> 01:15:32,044
I mean, a year ago, you could look and
say, you know, this is gonna be big

1390
01:15:32,045 --> 01:15:33,845
and everyone standing at the show going

1391
01:15:33,846 --> 01:15:36,244
"You know the show was big last year,

1392
01:15:36,245 --> 01:15:39,245
is it gonna, is it gonna
be as big as this year?"

1393
01:15:39,345 --> 01:15:40,545
The you remind them

1394
01:15:40,546 --> 01:15:42,745
"You know, last year
was only 6 month ago."

1395
01:15:42,845 --> 01:15:44,745
And then they go "Oh, , Linux time".

1396
01:16:11,444 --> 01:16:13,643
So leading up to the IPO, uh...

1397
01:16:13,644 --> 01:16:19,644
we had arrived actually in
San Diego on Tuesday night

1398
01:16:19,944 --> 01:16:23,944
We spent Wednesday morning
meeting investors in San Diego.

1399
01:16:24,344 --> 01:16:25,744
We flew up to San Francisco

1400
01:16:25,745 --> 01:16:29,643
spent Wednesday afternoon meeting
investment firms in San Francisco

1401
01:16:29,644 --> 01:16:30,544
VA Linux Selected December 9, 1999, as
the day for its stock to begin trading.

1402
01:16:30,545 --> 01:16:33,943
then on the Thursday
morning of the IPO is

1403
01:16:33,944 --> 01:16:36,443
when our stock would
be traded publically.

1404
01:16:36,444 --> 01:16:40,243
So it was nice we had ended
the tour in San Francisco

1405
01:16:40,244 --> 01:16:44,143
because we could go to the credit
suite's trading desk the next morning

1406
01:16:44,144 --> 01:16:46,043
to watch the public offering.

1407
01:16:46,044 --> 01:16:50,043
And in San Francisco being close enough
to the company, and to our families,

1408
01:16:50,044 --> 01:16:54,043
we could invite people up to
actually join us in the first trade.

1409
01:16:54,044 --> 01:16:57,143
So I invited my wife and
we invited Linus and Tove,

1410
01:16:57,144 --> 01:17:00,643
and a number of other friends and people
who worked in the company in to join us.

1411
01:17:00,644 --> 01:17:02,143
Whenever we invite Linus and Tove,

1412
01:17:02,144 --> 01:17:05,243
they have uh, two young children,

1413
01:17:05,244 --> 01:17:07,243
and I have a daughter, Andrea.

1414
01:17:07,244 --> 01:17:08,743
And we always bring the kids along

1415
01:17:08,744 --> 01:17:10,743
so we went in to the credit
suite's trading floor

1416
01:17:10,744 --> 01:17:13,142
with all these traders and there
are these 3 year old kids

1417
01:17:13,143 --> 01:17:15,442
running around and chasing each
other around the show floor,

1418
01:17:15,443 --> 01:17:16,444
around the trading floor.

1419
01:17:16,445 --> 01:17:21,644
So Linus and I walked in and we
walked up in to the trading floor

1420
01:17:21,744 --> 01:17:23,044
and everyone was very excited.

1421
01:17:23,045 --> 01:17:26,243
And we kept asking them, well "Hows it going?
Are things going ok?".

1422
01:17:26,244 --> 01:17:29,043
And they said, "Oh, it's..
uh, we're really excited,

1423
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:30,244
I think things are going well.

1424
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:33,843
We don't wanna, We don't wanna say,
We don't wanna jinx anything."

1425
01:17:33,844 --> 01:17:37,844
We walked in and it was a
big screen TV showing CNBC.

1426
01:17:38,444 --> 01:17:42,444
And it was amazing to us, but the
theme for the day was Linux.

1427
01:17:42,544 --> 01:17:44,943
Now we have an IPO
that's gonna go today.

1428
01:17:44,944 --> 01:17:47,143
And when I mean go, it is going to go.

1429
01:17:47,144 --> 01:17:49,143
The estimates I'm
hearing are staggering.

1430
01:17:49,144 --> 01:17:52,643
But watch VA Linux Systems.
It goes at 12:40 today.

1431
01:17:52,644 --> 01:17:54,343
The symbol is L-N-U-X.

1432
01:17:54,344 --> 01:17:57,943
A provider of large scale computer
servers and workstations,

1433
01:17:57,944 --> 01:18:00,144
specially designed for the
Linux operating system.

1434
01:18:00,145 --> 01:18:06,244
The original range on this IPO was 11 to
13 dollars, then 21 to 23, then 28 to 30.

1435
01:18:06,444 --> 01:18:09,742
Priced at 30, and the estimates
I'm hearing I don't wanna repeat

1436
01:18:09,743 --> 01:18:11,043
because I don't have a confirmation.

1437
01:18:11,044 --> 01:18:15,942
But if they're true, they will blow you're
mind when this stock takes off at 12:40.

1438
01:18:15,943 --> 01:18:18,343
I turned to Linus and I said
"Gee, did you ever think,

1439
01:18:18,344 --> 01:18:23,543
you know, you'd walk in here some day
and Linux would be THE theme on CNBC?".

1440
01:18:24,143 --> 01:18:26,843
and Linus said in his joking
way said "Oh Absolutely!".

1441
01:18:27,243 --> 01:18:30,742
So we walk in and they show us the
buy and sell orders coming in..

1442
01:18:30,743 --> 01:18:32,742
and it's incredible.

1443
01:18:32,743 --> 01:18:36,343
We're seeing numbers like 320
dollars, 340 dollars a share.

1444
01:18:36,943 --> 01:18:38,842
And I'm just in complete shock.

1445
01:18:38,843 --> 01:18:44,143
You know, this is over 10 times where we
priced the offering. It was incredible.

1446
01:18:44,443 --> 01:18:48,442
And I remember Linus just kind of, sort
of patting me on the back and saying,

1447
01:18:48,443 --> 01:18:52,442
you know "Relax..." and it was
pretty exciting to see that.

1448
01:18:52,443 --> 01:18:55,343
We were, it was just amazing.
We were stunned.

1449
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:58,742
We were lucky that we were able
to get back to the offices,

1450
01:18:58,743 --> 01:19:02,542
we'd been in San Francisco so we
could come back to VA's offices

1451
01:19:02,543 --> 01:19:05,042
to, to see everyone in
the office for the IPO.

1452
01:19:05,043 --> 01:19:09,943
When we got back, we had uh,
everyone was obviously very excited.

1453
01:19:10,543 --> 01:19:13,242
The IPO had done just tremendously well.

1454
01:19:13,243 --> 01:19:16,842
We had a little party
that we put together.

1455
01:19:16,843 --> 01:19:18,543
It was interesting, while
we were celebrating

1456
01:19:18,544 --> 01:19:21,043
there were plenty of people
that were still trying to work.

1457
01:19:21,044 --> 01:19:24,842
I recall cries of "Be quiet!", "We're
on the phone!", "We're Working!",

1458
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:28,542
Uh, as we uh, as we
went in to the offices.

1459
01:19:28,543 --> 01:19:32,342
One of the things I did was I
gave the road show presentation

1460
01:19:32,343 --> 01:19:34,143
for the employees back at the office,

1461
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:37,242
so they could have an idea of
what we'd been telling investors,

1462
01:19:37,243 --> 01:19:40,842
and understand exactly what
we'd uh, put together for them.

1463
01:19:40,843 --> 01:19:49,543
But again the story of the day is VA
Linux, now up 766% to 235 dollars to 265.

1464
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:52,142
Sue, the best performing IPO ever.

1465
01:19:52,143 --> 01:19:57,643
Here it goes, Sycamore Networks was uh,
priced at 38 dollars, surged to $270.

1466
01:19:57,943 --> 01:20:00,242
This has just beat it. And by the way..

1467
01:20:00,243 --> 01:20:04,243
[ How do you feel about potentially
billions of dollars of wealth being created

1468
01:20:04,443 --> 01:20:08,443
from your creation, that you're
not directly cashing out? ]

1469
01:20:09,043 --> 01:20:12,441
So, if I hadn't made
Linux available, I mean,

1470
01:20:12,442 --> 01:20:15,741
I wouldn't have gotten any
money that way either.

1471
01:20:15,742 --> 01:20:18,641
So I mean, It's a win-win situation.

1472
01:20:18,642 --> 01:20:25,442
Uh, just the fact that there are
a lot of commercial companies

1473
01:20:25,542 --> 01:20:31,442
means that there are a lot of Linux people who
used to work on Linux kind of on the side.

1474
01:20:31,942 --> 01:20:34,641
And now they get paid for
doing what they wanted to do.

1475
01:20:34,642 --> 01:20:39,242
And that helps me in the sense that I
wanted them to work on Linux anyway.

1476
01:21:00,842 --> 01:21:06,142
The whole GNU project
is really one big hack.

1477
01:21:06,642 --> 01:21:10,641
It's one big act of subversive
playful cleverness,

1478
01:21:10,642 --> 01:21:16,742
to change society for the better, because I'm
only interested in changing it for the better,

1479
01:21:16,842 --> 01:21:21,042
but in a clever way.

1480
01:21:21,242 --> 01:21:25,242
Hi, we're the GNU/Stallmans, and
this is "The Free Software Song"

1481
01:21:26,242 --> 01:21:29,841
Join us now and share the software;

1482

You'll be free, hackers, you'll be free.

1483
01:21:37,542 --> 01:21:38,342
You'll be free, hackers, you'll be free.

1484
01:21:46,042 --> 01:21:49,141
Hoarders may get piles of money,

1485
01:21:49,142 --> 01:21:56,542
That is true, hackers, that is true.

1486
01:21:58,342 --> 01:22:01,741
But they cannot help their neighbors;

1487
01:22:01,742 --> 01:22:09,741
That's ain't good, hackers,
that's ain't good.

1488
01:22:13,941 --> 01:22:16,940
When we have enough free software

1489
01:22:16,941 --> 01:22:24,241
At our call, hackers, at our call,

1490
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:29,540
We'll throw out those dirty licenses

1491
01:22:29,541 --> 01:22:37,341
Ever more, hackers, ever more.

1492
01:23:12,341 --> 01:23:15,640
Join us now and share the software;

1493
01:23:15,641 --> 01:23:22,841
You'll be free, hackers, you'll be free.

1494
01:23:24,741 --> 01:23:27,740
Join us now and share the software;

1495
01:23:27,741 --> 01:23:34,341
You'll be free, hackers, you'll be free.

1496
01:23:36,541 --> 01:23:39,340
Oh, you'll be free

1497
01:23:39,341 --> 01:23:41,040
I let you know.

1498
01:23:41,041 --> 01:23:43,940
That you'll be free. [ repeat ]

1499
01:23:43,941 --> 01:23:45,840
I let you know

1500
01:23:45,841 --> 01:23:49,841
That you'll be free. [ repeat ]

1501
01:23:52,941 --> 01:23:56,941
That you'll be free. [ repeat ]
