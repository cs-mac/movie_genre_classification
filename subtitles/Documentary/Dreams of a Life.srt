1
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,291
When the story of Joyce
was brought back to the office,

2
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,283
I think there was
a stunned silence for a minute.

3
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,959
I don't think anyone had really heard
a story like that before.

4
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,760
Reporters always get asked,
"What's the best story you've done?"

5
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,599
Or the strongest story
or the worst story or whatever.

6
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,559
And this is my like clutch of ones

7
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,483
that you would remember
through a lifetime.

8
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,403
'You wanted to write it
and tell other people.

9
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,202
'That's that's the power of it, really.

10
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,722
'Ali said to me, "You go down
to the inquest and cover it.“'

11
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,770
(Alison) 'We knew pretty quickly
that it was out of the ordinary.

12
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,361
'I worked at the paper for ten years
and there wasn't a story like it.

13
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,279
'There was such a remarkable lack
of information about Joyce Vincent.

14
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,199
'It was so hard
to find anything about her.'

15
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,964
(Knocking at door)

16
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,731
(Bailiff) Miss Vincent?

17
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,599
Miss Vincent,
we've a repossession order!

18
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,719
'It always struck me as strange

19
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,479
'how there's just swams of thousands
of people going around their business,

20
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,319
'getting their shopping,
meeting their friends

21
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,279
'and all this time
there was a woman in the ﬂats above

22
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,199
and nobody knew that she was there

23
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,039
(Man) Trying to let her know
there's somebody at the door.

(Door being forced)

26
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,722
'You really wanted
to find out more about this woman.'

27
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,399
It was a story that everyone wanted
but no one could get.

28
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,370
I Watch me fall from grace

29
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,124
I Disappear with no trace

I As I try to erase you

31
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,721
I Feel the pain and watch me bleed

32
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,408

(Dialling tone)

36
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,879
Hello, it's Carol here, Carol Morley,

37
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,006
phoning about Joyce.

38
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,719
I'll try your mobile.
I'll try you again. Bye.

39
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,611
I'm looking for any infomation,
no matter how minor,

40
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,444
about Joyce Vincent.

41
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,444
(Man) 'l was sitting at home one day
and I don't know if you do this,

42
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,399
'you just put someone's name
into Google.

43
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,079
'And I don't know what made me do it.
I just put Joyce's name in.

44
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,970
There was loads of links
lo all these news stories.

45
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,726
I thought, "Ooh, that's a coincidence.
Someone else with Joyce's name."

46
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,639
'Then I scrolled down
and I saw your advert

47
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,450
'and I thought, "Oh, crikey.
It must be the same person."'

48
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,361
I got your email on Friends Reunited
asking, “Did I know Joyce Vincent?"

49
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,199
And straight away it was just
hairs up on the back of my neck, arms

50
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,123
and it was quite a shock, actually.

51
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,719
When you called I was at work
and I'd had a couple of missed calls,

52
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,722
anonymous calls,
and I thought they were my mum,

53
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,406
so I was just ignoring them.

54
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,324
Then I thought, "That's the fourth call.
I'd better take this one.“

55
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,079
And the line broke a little bit,
so I was thinking,

56
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,923
"Did she just say Joyce is dead?"

57
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,719
(Carol) Lots of people I've met
that knew her read the story

58
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,767
and didn't realise it was Joyce.

59
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,607
Really?
- They couldn't...

60
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,680
They didn't identify the victim - dead,
lonely, sad - with the Joyce they knew'?

61
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,239
No.
- Isn't that interesting?

62
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,288
'It's even more interesting then.'

63
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,642
I was just amazed that
we'd not heard this from anybody

64
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,759
or nobody had realised.

65
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,604
How did they not know
from the electricity bills?

66
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,170
(Lynne Featherstone)
'l wrote to the utilities because I thought,

67
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,208
'normally if you don't pay your bill,
you get cut-off.

68
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,805
'I wrote to the local authority
because I thought,

69
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,759
"'Well, she must have had
council tax to pay.“

70
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,839
'They sort of didn't want to know.

71
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,650
'They washed their hands of it.
"Nothing to do with us."'

72
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,559
(Carol) 'I found friends...'
(Lynne) 'How did you find them?'

73
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,399
Because the police couldn't
and the authorities couldn't?

74
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,165
So how did you? Clever girl

75
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,959
I mean, you'd like to think
that everyone's got someone

76
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,883
who would kind of look out for them.

77
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,799
'And it just seemed remarkable,

78
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,723
'given all the information
we had about Joyce,

79
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,646
'although it was quite limited,

80
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,284
'it just seemed strange
and highly unusual

81
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,283
'that there was no one there for her.'

82
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,169
It's just tragic.

83
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,850
You know, and the fact
that she was left all alone.

84
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,691
They said it's 2003
when she died, yeah?

85
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,650
And then this is '06. Wow!

86
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,361
"Probably died of natural causes.“

87
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,279
"The only way she could be identified

88
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,248
"was by comparing dental records

89
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,199
"with a holiday photo of her smiling."

90
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,087
WOW!

91
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,848
Flies and a smell and nobody noticed.

92
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,759
“Skeleton of Joyce
found on the sofa with telly still on."

93
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,679
There's not even a picture
of her in there.

94
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,519
It's surprising they didn't put
a photo of her in the paper

95
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,285
because that would be one reason
to have the article in there.

96
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,328
There was nothing there
that would give it away.

97
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,162
You know, just the name Joyce,
"skeleton of Joyce".

98
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,970
I mean, that could be anyone.

99
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,679
Her bed-sit looks like a hovel as well,
doesn't it?

100
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,839
Have you been to the bed-sit'?

101
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,569
Is it as shitty as it looks?

102
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,399
It's bad enough reaching 40
let alone being 40 and alone.

103
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,243
It's awful, shocking!

104
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,367
It was so horrendous, you know,

105
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,199
that she was left,
found in front of her television

106
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,039
that was still on for so many years,

107
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,079
and nobody knows this.

108
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,759
(TV on)

109
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,839
Yeah, just gained access.

110
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,639
(Coughing)

111
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,441
No, it's horrible. It's annoying.

112
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,161
Can't believe it.

113
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,849
Just to be sad and...

114
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,411
I think it was an MP
who was absolutely disgusted

115
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,519
about the fact that we could just allow
someone to disappear off the radar.

116
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,320
I don't know what in the end
caused her die alone in her ﬂat.

117
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,039
She wasn't alcoholic, she didn't smoke,
she didn't take drugs.

118
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,010
I don't know what made her
the Joyce Vincent that I knew

119
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,919
and I don't know what took her
to the Joyce Vincent that died.

120
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,719
I remember the story.
I heard it on the news.

121
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,559
I remember the whole thing
Didn't recognise it as her.

122
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,439
I think that was
the terribly sad thing, really.

123
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,239
That, you know,
no one had reported her missing

124
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,006
Worst of all, her family
hadn't reported her missing

125
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,081
Four sisters!

126
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,919
Four sisters!

127
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,764
I don't know why
I'm always stuck on that significance

128
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,679
of three years
and nobody's come looking for you.

129
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,605
But it is that. I reckon
that says a lot for the beginning.

130
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,841
(Lynne) Some of the details
that ﬂoated around early on

131
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,519
were mysterious.

132
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,439
(Man) '“Ms Vincent's local MP
and members of her family said

133
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,279
"they want a full investigation
into how she died."'

134
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,239
The trouble with this is
that there was no...

135
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,242
You can't establish the cause of death
without a body.

136
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,919
I think somebody killed her.

137
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,888
It's a body melting into the carpet,
basically.

138
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,799
That's... That's just... It's grim.

139
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,643
There's nothing there for us now,

140
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,599
just a fair old mark on the carpet.

141
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,359
Oh, my God.

142
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,399
I think she was murdered, you know.

143
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,243
It's too clean cut.

144
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,010
If it's wet and ifs not yours,
you can't take any risks.

145
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,890
(Journalist) 'The police said
there was nothing suspicious,

146

'but unless you knew what happened,
you will always think

147
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,768
'there's a possibility
of some kind of foul play in there.'

00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,479
'You have this mystery that's thrown up
and you just want to know more.'

155
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,279
With all this DNA stuff,
testing and what have you,

156
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,171
I'm sure they can find some way
of finding out what really happened.

157
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,123
I think there's more to it
than meets the eye.

158
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,799
You'd probably never find out
the true story of it.

159
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,723
It'd be another JFK all the way.

160
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,679
'I was working late one evening.'

161
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,639
I was friendly with her
and she came round and said,

162
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,639
"Do you want to go out for a drink?"

163
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,529
And I said, "Yeah, all right, then."

164
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,239
She seemed very fond of him
but they were a very unlikely pairing.

165
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,239
Very unlikely.

166
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,919
I had no idea
she was attracted to me at all.

167
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,766
And...
And then I actually developed,

168
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,808
you know, a love for her.

169
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,649
'And one day I said,
'Would you like to go to this hunt ball?"

170
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,240
'She seemed a bit hesitant at first
and I thought, 'Well that's strange.

171
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,279
"'I thought she was attracted to me."

172
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,239
'I think it was something to do
with leaving the confines of London

173
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,999
'where she was quite happy.'

174
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,999
I think Martin rolled in in his car

175
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,765
that he'd completely written off
on the way down.

176
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,764
It was just...
He had a little cut on his head.

177
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,840
And she turned up
later than everybody else

178
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,369
wearing this dress,

179
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,239
this son of powder-blue rubber dress.

180
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,239
The one moment that will stick
in everybody's mind

181
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,119
was the first time everybody saw her
when Martin brought her out.

182
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,885
"I'm bringing this girl I work with."
We'd heard about her.

183
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,645
She turns up,
she's got a spray-on dress.

184
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,639
And you go, “You jammy bastard.“

185
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,719
And you go, “You jammy bastard.“

186
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,559
I If you should see me

187
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,484
I And I'm smiling

188
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,239
I Don't think my smile

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,527
'that Martin was going out
with someone quite so stunning.'

193

(Man) 'l was astounded.
Absolutely astounded.

194

We couldn't believe he could end up
with somebody like that.

195

(Martin) 'l was really chuffed
to go out with her.'

197

I know everyone liked her,
you know.

198
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,761
More than just liked. Fancied her.

(Man) 'Petite and yet, you know,
a good figure.'

202
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,087

'Some people are annoyingly happy.'

210

she always felt that she would.'

that she could have passed like that.'

'She might have been happy to pass.
Maybe she weren't happy with her life.'

education from the way she spoke.'

pleasant to go to, pleasant people.'

Happy times for everybody.

whether the weather be hot,

240
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,799
we'll be together,
whatever the weather,

(Martin) 'Joyce's mother
had elocution lessons for her

'I think when people met her,
they were a little bit taken aback.'

245
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,359
(Woman) 'I just suddenly started
to hear her voice.'

246
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,239
And the sound of it,
cos I'd actually forgotten.

247
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,129
Very soft.

248
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,879
Very clear, well spoken.

249
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,759
'Not common.' (Laughs)

250
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,799
'But not sort of posh.
It was just nice.'

251
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,639
(Man) 'They taught her to walk,
taught her to speak.

'Everything was very nice

'You didn't feel like
she was putting it on.'

254
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,130
She was relaxed in that position,
but she was very comfortable.

255
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,043
And she was striking in that way.

256
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,679
She definitely wanted
something more out of life,

257
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,648
whether it was to be somebody
or to have somebody.

258
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,559
I would imagine
she was coming from somewhere,

259
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,479
trying to get to somewhere.

260
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,439
The best way she knew how is,

261
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,199
"I need to look good.

262
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,119
"I have my features.
I have my brains.“

263
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,039
Joyce never let on how clever she was.

264
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,930
'I think she was a very bright girl,
but she just played it down.'

265
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,959
(Woman) 'French, grade three.'

266
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,799
Nature studies, grade five.

Social studies, grade four.

268

Grade E... So she didn't have
any GCSEs or A-Levels?

269
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,282
She gave the impression
she was very well educated, yeah

270
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,199
I'm not saying that
I had great conversations with her

271
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,807
about, you know,
what the meaning of life is

272
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,006
or anything like that.

she was any different to the rest of us.'

And Maths ungraded as well.

279
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,849
Maths is ungraded as well, yeah.

280
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,719
That's quite amazing.
- Considering the area of work.

281
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,679
I mean, that is quite
something else really.

282
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,559
(Woman)
'Maybe she wasn't good at exams.

283

'She never came across as somebody
that was not academically clever.'

284
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,119
I think she said
she was something in finance

285
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,090
and I just kind of thought,
"Oh, I thought you were a secretary."

'She had a really responsible job.'

in the treasury department

the company's money around, really,

small amounts.

We're talking about millions of pounds.'

292
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,683
She wasn't throwing money around.

293
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,519
'I mean, she liked to go out
and have a meal, buy a few clothes.

(Kim) She just reminded me
of somebody that...

300
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,759
I suppose somebody
that I would like to be, almost.

301
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Because I can be a bit scatty
in my dressing and getting myself ready

302
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,290
and everything about her
was just immaculate.

'Obviously she used to get
a lot of male attention.

460
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,839
'Why didn't they think,
"It's coming from next-door.

461
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,921
"'Let's kick the door in"'?'

to knock on the door a couple of times.

that she wasn't answering the door.'

00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,319
I For any love problem,
you just come to Kirk

474
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,319
I Cos I got the remedy

475
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,319
I And it always works

476
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,166
I One day this lady said
her man was such a bore

477
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,959
I That he made love
and her feel like a daily chore I

478
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,646
She came to Kirk's place to rent a room.

479
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,639
That's the first time I seen her,
when she moved in.

480
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,519
(Kirk) When people would call up
as I'm having to share a house,

481
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,359
'l would tell them, “I'm black."'

482
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,319
And she said,
"Yes, well I'm black, too."

483
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,199
I moved in April, May '88.

484
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,999
She would have moved in
about a month after that.

485
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,844
Well, she fitted in very good.

486
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,679
(Kirk) 'My house was kind of
people in and out, musicians.'

487
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,599
(Martin) 'He had a studio
at the bottom of his garden

488
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,444
He used to play the pan.
I used to love that sound.

489
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,279
'She told me Captain Sensible came
round to record something there.'

490
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,169
(Kirk) 'She'd up dress
in a French maid's outfit.

'Black stockings and a garter.
The whole works.

492
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,809
Risqué.

493
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,679
That little French outfit she had on.

494
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,759
She looked nice in that.

495
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,479
(Kirk) 'I didn't ask her.
She just suggested taking a day off work

496
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,559
'and being the maid for the day.'

497
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,359
(Woman) 'She was just happy-go-lucky.
We were just 24, 25.

'No responsibilities, no bills to pay.'

499
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,084
Just the rent.
There was nothing to be unhappy about.

500
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,919
'A lot of people that came to the house,

501
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,719
they did think that she was stuck-up
and that she didn't want to be black.

502
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,610
'She was trying
to be something that she wasn't.'

503
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,359
(Man) 'Every time I'd visit my uncle,
just playing, she'd be there.'

504
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,328
She was a really pretty girl
and when I was little,

505
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,200
I used to say to her...
I used to ask if I could brush her hair.

506
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,810
(Kirk) 'She was very comfortable
with my nieces and nephews.

507
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,839
I would have expected her
to have had children

508
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,799
because she did like children.

509
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,690
Don't know what I'm doing
but I'm just going like that.

510
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,599
I suppose she used to entertain me
because I was a little boy.

511
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,439
Seven, eight, nine...

512
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,119
(Woman) 'It was a really good time.
She was the perfect ﬂatmate.

513
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,199
'She was easy to get on with.
She was easy to live with.'

514
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,039
(Kirk) 'And I said,
'Well, I don't really want

515
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,839
'to live with people
that I have to moan at.'

516
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,719
She was a bit untidy

517
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,799
in the bathroom.

518
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,689
The ring around the tub.

519
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,439
Yes, like a Saturn ring. Yeah.

520
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,329
Some days you'd be thinking
Joyce was nice

521
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,323
but, hey, that bathroom was in a state.

522
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,159
It was black

523
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,999
with that kind of dirt
that's stuck to the sides black.

524
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,919
I touched it and said, "My goodness!
I wouldn't step into this with my ﬂip-ﬂops!"

525
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,679
She didn't do manual labour.

526
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,479
She just wasn't a hard worker.
She was lazy.

527
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,519
I'm thinking to myself,

528
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,285
"if she ever makes it,
she's going to have to get a maid

I Tell me

530
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,885

<i>I Tell me <i>I</i></i>

532
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,719
Hi, my name's Joyce
and that's nice.

533
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,719
No way!

534
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,404
Is that her voice?

535
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,250
God.

536
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,239
It's quite chilling, isn't ii?
But so playful as well.

537
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,130
Hi, my name's Joyce
and that's nice.

538
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,919
Well, that's extraordinary.

539
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,839
WOW!

540
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,759
Wow, that's like a blast from the past.

541
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,761
Yes, and that is Joyce.

542
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,642
Hi, my name's Joyce and that's nice.

543
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,359
Hi, I'm Joyce and that's nice.

544
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,279
She's putting a voice on.

545
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,124
That brings back
SO many memories HOW.

546
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,924
Hi, I'm Joyce and that's nice.

547
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,799
Where's that from?

548
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,567
Oh, yeah, these were some
of the people Kirk used to get

549
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,479
when he bought a nice studio.

550
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,559
He wanted a certain little sound
to come out.

551
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,450
Oh, I thought he had lost that tape
a long time ago.

552
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,359
Yeah, that was... That's her.

553
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,249
Flirtatious.

554
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,163
Sexy, wasn't she?
She was sexy.

555
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,039
The first time she says, "I'm Joyce,"
that sounds like her.

556
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,879
Not that beginning bit.

557
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,719
But as it got into it.
I know it's very short.

558
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,519
And then it sounds
like she's trying to be a bit more street,

559
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,559
but it doesn't really come across,
does it?

560
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,359
That is almost
a little bit unrecognisable

561
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:39,119
but the rest of it, you just catch
the essence of her voice there.

562
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,930
Hi, my name's Joyce and that's nice.

563
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,002
Hi, I'm Joyce and that's nice.

564
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,559
That's strange.
It doesn't sound like Joyce.

565
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,559
See, that's it!
It brings a person to life.

566
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,359
She's not...
She's not, you know...

567
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,364
You're not talking pathologists
any more, body ﬂuids,

568
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,079
stains on carpets or whatever,
all of that grim...

569
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,999
You're just talking about a human being
who's lived and sounds full of vibrancy.

570
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,999
WOW!

571
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,843

for her to go along and do a session.'

575
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,888
But, as much as I loved her,
Joyce was not a singer.

576
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,685
I told her
she could mime in the background.

Very, even at a young age.

with Shirley Bassey, Donna Summer.'

You wouldn't have to see her on TV.
You just know.

you know this woman's a star somehow.

That certain something, Joyce had that.

automatically
just crowding round Joyce

and just enjoying her entertaining you.

'But she wasn't a show-off.

I Hang if you can hang

608

<i>I No pain, no gain I</i>

609
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,130
OK, that was great. I'm going
to come round and see you now.

610
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,719
'Thank you very much.'

611
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,406
That was Joyce Carol Vincent
singing to you live.

612
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,399
I used to say she's got the package.

613
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,159
She's a good singer,
she's an attractive gilt.

614
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,079
Joyce Carol Vincent.

615
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,079
Boom.

616
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,081
Can I kiss you?

617
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,959
(Laughs)

618
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,724
What?

619
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,650
A lot of people said
she looked like Whitney Houston.

620
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,408
I thought she was
more attractive than that.

621
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,399
Sorry!
- Sorry. I'm sorry about that.

622
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,199
I got carried away
by the way you were looking at me.

623
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,079
It was just...
(Laughs) It was just a song!

624
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,039
She did play me
a tape that she had done.

625
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,679
I remember being absolutely amazed
because it sounded fantastic.

626
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,719
I Everybody needs love and affection I

627
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,399
(Martin) When she used to sing
around the house, I didn't like it.

628
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,319
'Maybe I've got a thing about people
just singing around the house.'

629
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,243
I think she did meet a few musos.

630
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,003
After I went outwith her.

631
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,839
She had the Sade thing, you know,

632
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,799
with tight trousers, high waistband,
hair tied back.

633
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,719
Very exotic, beautiful.

634
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,639
Everybody fancied her, you know.

635
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,559
And Sade was huge at the time as well.

636
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,319
I think she got that quite a lot.
"You look like Sade."

637
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,399
(I Iggy Pop: Ambition)

638
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,209
I I'm the kind of girl

639
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,999
I I want that whole wide world

640
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,999
I Nothing more, nothing less

I I don't want second bat I

642
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,799
(Man) 'She was stunning.

643
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,679
'She was the sort of girl
most girls would probably be jealous of

644
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,401
'But for fellas it was easy. As soon as
you looked at her, your jaw dropped.'

645
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,406
Because she was so friendly,

646
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,079
if we went to a nightclub or something
and I had to nip off to the loo,

647
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,999
you'd come out

648
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,919
and there’s be inevitably
someone talking to her.

649
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,879
And she'd go,
"Oh, he's a very nice chap.“

650
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,723
And I'd just go,
"Oh, my God. Here we go.

651
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,799
"'You don't understand."

652
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,407
'She just took them
as all being very friendly.'

653
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,439
(Woman) 'Underneath it all
I think she was a bit of a minx.

654
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,199
'I think she was a bit naughty.
You didn't see that much of it.

655
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,125
'But there were gaps in her personality
that you could see.

656
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,079
'She wasn't one of those people

657
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,687
'that made girls in a crowd
feel uncomfortable

658
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,839
'by ﬂirting with men.'

659
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:42,519
I think she was just very aware
of the fact that she was pretty.

660
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,319
She was full of life
and therefore attractive.

661
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,319
'She didn't need
to do any more than that.'

662
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,244
(Flatmate) 'l don't think there was
a man on earth that didn't tum his head.

663
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,199
She would attract attention
and just become the complete focus

664
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,043
and it was hard to get rid of men.

665
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,839
'They wouldn't take no for an answer.

666

'You just had to sit back
and watch it happen.'

667
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,599
(Man) 'She was the kind of person
that you would imagine

'ending up with Jay-Z,
Quincy Jones, a big, big name.'

669
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,439
(Martin) When I was going outwith her,

670
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,439
she told me

671
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,119
that the drummer
in Culture Club had asked her out.

672
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,039
She said, "I said no.“

673
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,119
She said, "I said no.“

674

better looking and younger than you

676
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,169
'were having a better time.'

677
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,039
You'd just see someone and think,

678
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,042
"I'll bet they're out all the time,
having a great life."

'She was quite mysterious.

680
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,679
'She could drift in and out
of situations and friendships

681
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,639
'Not easily,
but she would just not be there.

682
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,359
'Sometimes you wouldn't see her
for six months.'

683
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,442
(Woman) 'I always got the feeling
she was a bit of a drifter.

684
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,288
We didn't see her all the time.'

685
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,119
'l remember once we were supposed
to go off to some dinner.

686
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,879
'And she said, "Oh, I can't go.

'I thought she'd been out
with some other bloke, you know.

'But she said,
"Oh, no, it was nothing."'

690
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,679
I didn't fully believe it,
to tell you the truth.

691
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,439
(Woman) 'She was quite secretive.
I think she wasn't clear.

692
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,359
'She would say, “I'm off clubbing."
I don't think it was with Martin.

693
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,204
'So I'm not sure
who she was going with.'

(Man) 'I don't think
he was seeing anybody else

'but they didn't seem
to spend their whole time together.

696
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,679
'You'd ask Martin
if he was going out with her.

697
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,490
'He wouldn't answer you directly
so you wouldn't really know.'

698
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,210
If you're in a close-knit bunch of friends,

699
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,203
things are bound to happen

700
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,999
because you're all of the same...

701
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,999
You have similar
tastes and interests

702
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,879
and that often extends to girls as well

703
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,679
So if something happens,
something happens, doesn't it?

704
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,519
By Martin's own admission,
he's no oil painting.

705
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,522
'He's a nice bloke
but he's not the tallest of chaps.

706
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,359
'They were an odd couple.'

707
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,203
(Martin) 'William was
in Hemel Hempstead

708
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,199
and he'd split up with his girlfriend

709

'l said,
"Oh, it's no good moping around.

'Why don't you come up to London?"

711
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,680
"There'll be three girls there and me.
It will be a bit claustrophobic."

712
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,683
'I managed
to persuade him to come up.'

713
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,719
I think William did like her, yeah.

714
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,519
William had a series of girlfriends
and they were all good-looking

715
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,399
'because he was a good-looking lad
in his youth, you know.'

716
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,367
Probably still is.

717
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,319
Sunday lunch, lovely day.

718
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,119
The crescent is a gorgeous crescent.

719
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,964
I was surprised
that it was such a lovely place to live.

720
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,919
(Martin) 'A lot of alcohol drunk,
a lot of alcohol.

721
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,799
'And we all got quite drunk.'

722
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,679
I remember her not drinking much.

723
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,559
Maybe a couple of glasses of wine
and that was usually enough for her.

724
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,404
She got a little bit silly on more

725
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,328
I don't know if Joyce or William

726
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,079
went off to the loo or something.

727
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,079
(William) 'She was quite a head-turner.

728
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,959
Just very beautiful
and very unusual to look at.

729
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,691
I just thought, “Oh, blooming cheek!

730
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,719
“I'm inviting him up here
and he wants to snog her."

731
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,599
'I reckon I was a bit...
well, very jealous, shall we say,

732
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,490
'and well pissed off.'

733
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,204
I was shouting and he said, "Hit me.

734
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,046
"I realise I've done wrong. Hit me."
So I did, well and truly.

735
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,039
'My hand really did hurt.'

736
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,959
And I didn't realise
I'd hurt him a lot as well,

737
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,839
which I'm not exactly proud of.

738
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,684
And that was probably
the last time I saw her.

739
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,604
I don't think
Martin was going out with her then.

740
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,119
(Martin) "The following morning my face
was all swollen up and misshaped.

741
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,919
"My work colleagues were surprised
that little Marlin,

742
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,809
whom some of them had met,
had done it."

743
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,604
Oh, dear.

744
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,649
Dear oh dear. Terrible, isn't it?

745
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,559
And now we do the spice.

746
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,639
(William) 'l think they split up
a couple of times maybe.

747
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,479
'But I don't know the reasons
why they split up. I've no idea

748
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,239
'He wasn't particularly happy
that they had.

749
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,119
'But I got the impression
it was from his end rather than hers. '

750
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,839
I can't remember any specific day,
when we said, "Well, that's it."

751
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,919
It just sort of drifted apart really.

752
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,679
I think maybe he'd have liked it
to have worked properly.

753
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,603
I don't know why it didn't
We never discussed it.

754
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,448
'I do remember some occasions
of some black people saying,

755

'“What are you doing
going out with a white honky'?"'

756
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,159
She never went out
with black guys that I knew of

but I couldn't tell you
who she actually went out with.

758
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,930
Her interest was normally
in kind of office types,

759
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,799
sort of English guys.

760
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,719
Martin was the only one I met

761
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,566
and he wasn't what
I would have expected for Joyce.

762
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,406
'I would have expected somebody
taller, slimmer, really handsome.

'But then she was always
within this black-white...

at the beginning in the early days.'

777
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,319
When he first met her,
he saw this woman

778
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,199
and he thought,
'Wow, that is a babe of note!“

779
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,200
We slept together for almost a month
and I didn't touch her.

Alistair's one of those tenacious types.

783
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,639
And I remember afterwards

784
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,359
she told me
she'd said to one of her friends,

785
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,319

was late 1989

I was a kind of pop star in those days.

'I used to go to a lot of clubs because
I was trying to promote my music.'

796
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,119
So when I walked in the club
the DJ said,

797
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,879
'We have Alton Edwards in the house.“

And I'd phone him up and say,

800

"I'm coming down to the club
with 10 or 20 people.“

812

Joyce needed somebody
to care for her.

(Alistair) We were living together
about a year and a half.

had come over for dinner.

And she turned round
and she said to Gil,

825
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,802
"What's your definition of a pessimist?"

826
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:54,599
Gil's eyes brightened up, a wry smile
creased his face and he said,

"A pessimist is a guy
who's in possession of the full facts."

So when she went out with someone
she sort of became part of that person

Joyce was like a chameleon
in many ways,

in the room when he came in

913
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:07,044
'And I just thought to myself,
"How cruel life is."'

914
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,959
"I've been wanting
to meet this man all my life

"and Joyce got to meet him."

916

(Alton) 'It would have been the same
if she met, say, Princess Diana.

'more than the person.

920
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:28,039
That's why every time I think of Joyce
and I think about how she died,

921
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,088
or how she was found should I say,

922
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,006
it just boggles my brain.

923
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,879
How did she get herself
into that situation?

924
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,799
She was far too positive a person
to go down that route.

925
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,679
But then you don't really know people.

926
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:45,322
Joyce died alone
because she wanted to be alone.

927
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,286
I know people will tum around and say,

928
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,039
'Well, what happened
to her friends and family and so on?"

929
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,919

to take responsibility for a lot of that.

rather than confront the problem,

'she would just walk out of the job.'

1017

That's a strange way
of dealing with things,

up at John's place.'

1028

There were things
that used to make her uncomfortable.

1029
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,959
Talking about sex
made her feel uncomfortable.

1030
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,691
I think he probably thought

1031
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,679
she fancied him as well,
knowing him.

1032
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:56,359
(John) After a while she started
to feel comfortable around me,

1033
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:59,319
and she'd be walking around
in her underwear, which was just...

1034
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,321
I mean, she was gorgeous

1035
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:04,124
and you don't want some girl you fancy
walking around your house in underwear.

1036
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:09,919
'Over the few weeks before she left,
there was a tension developing.

1037
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,879
'Maybe men and women
see things differently.'

1038
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,799
But I saw it
as some son of sexual tension.

1039
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,559
There were times when I thought,
"Shall I, shan't I?"

1040
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:20,359
I'm sure there were occasions when
I may have been able to take advantage

1041
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,319
I think I may have been able
to take advantage.

1042
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,367
She gave that impression.

1043
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,119
Although I never did
and it never happened.

1044
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,999
And then it got to the point where...

1045
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,919
There was one day when it was
just becoming very uncomfortable.

1046
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,810
I came home and she was gone
and it was a relief to find she'd gone.

1047
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:45,519
(Kim) 'Pan of me wonders
whether there was sadness in her life.

(John) 'It did cross my mind that
something happened in her childhood

'that affected her.'

1051
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,644
One of the things I thought,

1052
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,679
initially, and it came back to mind,

1053
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,409
was that maybe she was abused.

1054
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,479
'She was almost the perfect example

1055

'of someone
that was interfered with as a child.

1056
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:16,004
'You think stuff like that
because of the way she was.'

1057
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:22,080
I often wondered if that was contributing
to her character of secrecy.

1058
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,799
Or maybe she...

1059
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,600
I was going to say she didn't trust people
but then she did trust people.

1060
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,559
That was one thing.
She did trust people.

1061
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,479
Maybe she was over-trusting.

1062
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:39,159
Maybe she got...
Later on maybe she was not so trusting.

1063
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,039
It's a funny contradiction.

1064
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,879
Does she trust people
and then she doesn't tell people?

1065
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,850
She kind of made relationships
but to a certain point.

1066
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,644
Because of maybe a trust issue.

1067
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,406
She didn't trust.
She had a problem trusting people.

1068
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,204
(Alison) 'It was said at the inquest

1069
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:05,280
'that she had been linked
into a battered woman's organisation.'

1070
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,999
(Journalist)
It was never settled satisfactorily

1071
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,959
'whether or not
she had been an abused woman

1072
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,719
(Alison) 'l think it's fair to say
she'd been in an abusive relationship.

1073
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,566
'I thought someone might have been
looking out for her because of that.

1074
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:21,479
'But she'd sort of moved
out of that system.'

1075
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:25,199
(Catherine) 'l think that when
Joyce was in the women's refuge

1076
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,239
'she was probably ashamed.

1077
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:30,079
The domestic violence
doesn't surprise me.

1078
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:33,919
'Guys were just so focussed
and so possessive with her.

1079
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,810
'That bit just didn't surprise me at all.'

1080
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,682
There was no evidence of it
when we lived together.

1081
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,559
There was nothing to say...

1082
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:45,439
She never said anything
about any other boyfriends

1083
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,279
being physical with her.

1084
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,170
It was just the emotional intensity.

1085
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,999
She seemed to make
all the wrong choices with men,

1086
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,889
which is sad really, very sad.

1087
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:00,719
It's sad that men could treat her badly
because she didn't deserve it.

1088
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:01,721
She wasn't that type of person.

1089
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,487
I feel quite sad

1090
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,328
that maybe she didn't feel
that she could share that with people

1091
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,246
that did really care about her

1092
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,008
and I think genuinely
would have helped her.

1093
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,801
(Alistair) 'She was always reticent
and reluctant to talk about her past.'

1094
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,479
(John) 'You get to know people
that tend to keep going back

1095
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,399
'to people that are violent.

1096
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,279
'They often had violent backgrounds
so they see that as normal.'

1097
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,204
And if you're nice to them,
they can't handle it. They don't like it.

1098
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:43,280
My only theory is that if she was
with a guy who used to beat her

1099
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,799
perhaps he isolated her
from the family.

1100
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:51,559
Because that's a classic thing to do
for anyone who is a bully,

1101
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,439
get them away
from their nearest and dearest.

1102
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,363
And then they've got total control.

1103
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:04,079
(Martin) 'I felt very upset
that anyone could be horrible

1104
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:07,039
'to someone who's so gentle,

1105
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:12,040
'someone who, as I said, hasn't got
a shred of nastiness about them.

1106
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:15,639
And then...

1107
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:19,440
for some guy to...

1108
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:25,359
...well, take advantage
of her niceness, if you like

1109
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:29,159
and just be horrible to her...

1110
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:33,927
She was the least deserving person
of that sort of treatment.

1111
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,599
(John) We've all made
stupid choices in our lives,

1112
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,439
'but hers were tragic.

1113
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,439
Why did she gravitate to bad people?

1114
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,330
Because she was a very bright girl
She was a very bright girl.

1115
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:52,199
'I'd like to know
what her problem was.'

1116
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,919
And I'd like to think that the people
that caused her that problem

1117
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,001
will get their comeuppance as well.

1118
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,679
(TV) This is BBC1.

1119
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,682
And now the ten o'clock news.

1120
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,279
(Dan) 'She was obviously
in a difficult relationship

1121
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,399
'They had come to a point
where they couldn't live together

1122
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,209
'but they couldn't move out.'

1123
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:17,999
They almost divided the house up.
- Yeah.

1124
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,999
(John) 'I didn't know much about them
other than she had to escape from them.

1125
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,759
'I don't know if it was the same person
or a load of different people.'

1126
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,759
Although two of them
were probably serious enough

1127
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,479
for her to need to disappear.

1128
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,439
'And the last one certainly was,
whoever he was.

'I think he should be...

1130

'absolutely ashamed of himself

'to make a girl disappear.'

1132
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,839
(Catherine) 'The last time I saw her
was up the West End somewhere.'

1133
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,759
I was walking down this street
and she was coming towards me,

1134
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:54,599
so I stopped and said, “Joyce!“

1135
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,479
She looked at me
and put her head down

1136
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,319
and kind of just scurried along.

1137
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,243
She picked up speed.
I was like, "Joyce!"

1138
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,999
'She just carried on
so I thought, 'Hm, OK

"if that's what you want."

1140
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,679
That would have been around 2001.

(Dan) 'They said she died
around December 2003.

'It makes you wonder what was going on
when she was working with us.

'Who was she seeing?
What sort of person was he?'

1145
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,039
And whether that had anything
to do with her leaving.

1146
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,008
She was hiding from somebody.
- Yeah.

1147
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:40,641
(Dan) 'She gave this impression
at work and when we socialised

1148

what was actually going on.

(Kim) 'She decided she was going
to go travelling or move on.

'She worked there for four years.'

She had a lovely leaving do

'that she had been head-hunted
by another company.'

to be a lot of conflicting stories

definitely is 100% sure

'that she was going travelling
with this group of 20 people.

'And I like to think
that that's what she did.'

1163
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:44,959
If you think about it,

1164
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,727
ifs like we just accepted
that we never heard from her again.

1165
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,559
And there's...
I don't know, there's a part of me

1166
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:56,479
that feels a little bit
uncomfortable about that.

1167
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,359
Because you like to think
that you keep in touch with people,

1168
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,279
or you make the effort.

1169
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,045
And I really just don't understand
what happened here.

01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,999
(Alistair) 'l got this call one day.
It just came out of the blue.

1171
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,759
'And I heard this voice say, "Al?"

1172

'l recognised the voice
but I was shocked.

And she said, "It's Joyce."'

1174
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:23,242
Awhole kaleidoscope of emotions
went coursing through my brain.

01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:28,079
'We met very close
to where she was working.

1176

'What she said to me was
that she'd kind of regretted

'the fact
that we were no longer together.'

1178

'She said that she'd realised
she'd made a mistake.'

1179
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:44,403
That was the onetime in her life
that she was truly happy.

1180
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:48,359
'She said, “Would we be able
to pick up the pieces?"

1181
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:53,079
And I just told her that
I didn't think that was possible.

1182
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:57,802
I'd moved on.
I didn't want to... go back.

'That was the last time
I ever spoke to her.'

1184
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,479
I think that's probably
the last thing she did say,

1185
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,404
apart from, you know,
a kiss on the cheek and goodbye.

(Martin) I know
it was August bank holiday 2001,

1187
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,199
when she came to phone me up
in the middle of the night

1188
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,204
and said, "Can I come over and stay,
just for a week or something?"

1189
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,047
I said, "Yeah. Sure. "

'And no, she was just...'

she was staying on his couch.'

to push her out or anything.

I said, “Yeah, no problem at all."

I think I asked him,
was he seeing her again?

1207
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,719
He said, no,
she was just staying on the couch

1208
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:42,479
and he was just helping her out.

1209
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:46,479
It was one new year
and Martin phoned me up

1210
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:51,239
and said, “Happy new year.
Someone here wants to talk to you."

1211
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,119
And he handed the phone
over to Joyce.

1212
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:56,010
It must have been into 2002
she was still there.

1213
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,679
'I was getting a bit anxious as to
how long exactly she was going to stay.

1214
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:03,684
'It ended up she was there
about six months in the end.'

1215
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,599
He must have said to me
that he said to her,

1216
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,444
“You have to go.
You can't stay on my couch anymore.“

1217
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:13,199
Which is fair enough.
ll is a really small one-bedroom ﬂat.

1218
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,239
'I even asked her
if she wanted to go outwith me again.

1219
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:18,079
'She said, "No, I don't want
to go back over old ground."'

1220
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,919
But I knew in my heart that wasn't
the reason she was staying with me.

1221
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:27,599
I feel really guilty now
because at that time

1222
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,647
I was wrapped up
doing other stuff.

1223
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,566
And I said, "Yeah,
I'll come and meet you."

1224
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,441
And I had things happen
so I never did.

1225
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,319
And month on month it went on.

1226
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:38,119
Maybe I should contact Martin
go and see Joyce."

1227
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:39,199
And I never did.

1228
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:43,046
She could have stayed longer
if she wanted to.

1229
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,684
I just wanted her to sort herself out.

1230
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,679
(Man) 'He obviously feels bad
about that,

1231
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,648
'That's probably
around the last time he saw her.'

1232
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:58,439
She told me
she was working in the City,

1233
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,329
but she didn't say where or doing what

1234
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,279
And when she went to work

1235
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:07,039
'she didn't look her well turned out,
highly polished style.

1236
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:11,759
'Her character seemed really different.
I think she was trying to be the same.

1237
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:16,607
'But you could tell there was something
that she wasn't talking about.'

1238
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:22,359
'l took the day off one day
and she went, apparently, out to work.

1239
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,159
'And then I went
to Shepherd's Bush Green.

1240
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,199
'And she probably thought
I'd gone to work

1241
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,999
'cos she was coming back
across the pedestrian crossing.

1242
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,839
'And I was going, "I thought
you'd gone to work, Joyce."'

1243
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,759
I'm not feeling very well, Martin

1244
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,759
I thought, "You're not going to work.
You haven't got a job.

1245
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,524
"She hasn't told me."

1246
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:45,444
'I think my offers of help
just turned into pressure on her, really.

1247
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:47,439
'There was clearly something going on.'

1248
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:52,440
And I just remember coming back
one day and she'd just gone.

1249
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,159
(Coughing)

1250
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:59,160
Joyce. Joyce, just breathe easily.

1251
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:01,767
(Wheezing)

1252
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,362
(Martin) 'l think of her constantly.
Constantly.'

1253
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,159
And I just...

1254
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,119
In fact, I sometimes lie in bed
talking to myself

1255
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:20,920
as if I'm talking to her,
you know, talking out loud.

1256
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:33,359
Yeah, I think about her a lot, really.

1257
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,169
Just holding her, actually.

1258
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:37,241
Holding her.

1259
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,723
Just breathe easily.

1260
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:55,519
I've spoken to people and they've said,
"That was the love of your life.“

1261
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:58,399
And I think they're right, definitely.

1262
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,164
Yeah.

1263
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:18,599
(Carol) 'She went in for a peptic ulcer,
which wasn't long before she died.

1264
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,489
'She put her next of kin
as her bank manager.'

1265
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,361
Is that right?
- Yeah.

1266
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,359
She was that removed,
I think, at that point.

1267
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,039
Gosh. That's incredible.
- Yeah.

1268
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,199
Oh.

1269
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,885
Oh, how sad. Yeah.

1270
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:37,639
That's sad,
cos obviously you've got family

1271
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,559
and you don't know what's happened.

1272
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:44,519
But surely there's got to be a friend
more than your bank manager.

1273
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,284
Oh, my God.

1274
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,202
That really sums it up, doesn't it'?

1275
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,439
(Martin) 'A letter turned up for her.

1276
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:11,239
'I thought maybe it would give me a clue
as to where she was living or something,

1277
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:12,359
'So I just opened it in the end.'

1278
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:15,250
It was a wages slip for a cleaning job.

1279
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:18,039
So I was really hurt when I saw that

1280
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:22,879
'She wasn't working in the City at all.
She was doing some cleaning job.

1281
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:26,719
'That's why she didn't look polished
in her usual attire.

1282
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,639
I thought,
"She didn't want me to know

1283
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:32,399
where she was going,
what she was doing."

1284
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,319
Again harbouring those secrets,

1285
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:37,290
which I found a bit heart-breaking
to tell you the truth.

1286
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,001
(Kim) 'Really? A cleaner?

1287
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,799
No, doesn't...

1288
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:50,679
I mean... I don't know.

1289
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:54,599
I'm just trying to picture her doing
that sort of work and I just can't do it,

1290
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:57,319
knowing the sort of person she was.

1291
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,399
I suppose I'm trying to picture her
doing it all dolled up

1292
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:03,199
and immaculately dressed
with her hair and...

1293
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,123
With a tight sort of skirt on.
- Pushing an umbrella.

1294
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,039
Not an umbrella.

1295
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,805
A Hoover around.
- An umbrella!

1296
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:15,679
(John) She didn't know
what life she wanted and the thing is,

1297
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:20,481
the life that she should have had
was staring her in the face all the time.

1298
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,199
(Woman) 'I think
she wanted to settle down.

1299
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,279
'That was very much the thing
of the crowd that we were in.

1300
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:30,039
'You get married by the time
you're 25, 26, so you have babies.'

1301
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,919
With this ring I wed.

1302
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:35,919
(Martin) 'That's the reason
for getting married, to have children.'

1303
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,799
'She asked me to once.'

1304
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:41,679
And I thought
maybe she meant like straight away.

1305
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:44,519
And I said, "Oh, no, no, no.“

1306
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:47,399
'When you're in your 20s
you don't think about these things.

1307
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,244
'The thought of getting married and
having children is off-putting

1308
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:53,999
'when you can go out and have
a few beers and have a good time

1309
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,002
'and you've got no responsibilities.'

1310
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:57,919
He said to me once...

1311
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,679
When I said, 'Well,
why don't you marry Joyce?

1312
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:01,759
'Why don't you get engaged?"

1313
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,559
<i>And he says, “It would be unfair.</i>

1314
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,679
"We'd have tinted children.
I don't want tinted children."

1315
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,519
He didn't mean that in a racist way.

1316
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,319
At the time
there was a lot of racism around

1317
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,324
and half-caste kids get
the worst of it, don't they'?

1318
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,079
(Martin) My dad said something like,

1319
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,919
I saw Martin coming off the train
with a young lady.

1320
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:20,879
"Is she black or something?"

1321
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,961
That made me laugh.

1322
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:26,599
When Martin's father died
a few years back

1323
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:30,599
maybe then he started thinking
"Well, I should have done."

1324
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:34,439
Because he wasn't there
to pass judgment, you know.

1325
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:39,199
Maybe that was one of the things
he was thinking.

1326
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:42,090
But you can always think
you could have done things differently.

1327
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:03,128
If she had married Alistair,

1328
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,999
I think that he would have made her
a good husband.

1329
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,759
Whether she would have made him
a good wife is another story.

1330
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:15,525
But he loved her, desperately.

1331
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:21,479
(Alistair) 'l did love her, intensely,
and I think she loved me very deeply.

1332
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:24,199
'And therein lay the problem.

1333
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:27,159
'I don't think she thought
she was capable of loving.

1334
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:30,084
'I don't think she thought
she was capable of being happy.'

1335
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,959
Maybe it was just too good for her

1336
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,803
in the sense that...

1337
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,523
"I want this but is it really me?"

1338
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,289
I think she was afraid to...

1339
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,124
...live the dream.

1340
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:01,639
'She always believed

1341
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:04,639
'that something would come
and mess it up.

1342
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:08,439
'There'd always be somebody there
to burst the bubble.

1343
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:10,399
'And I kept saying to her,

1344
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:14,239
"'Just enjoy it, just look at the light
shining on that bubble.

1345
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:16,129
The wonderful colours
that are thrown up.

1346
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:20,846
"'Deal with that first and when it bursts,
then deal with that.“

1347
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,679
'That was pan of her problem.

1348
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,569
'She had demons that haunted her.'

1349
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,804
OK.

1350
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:48,679
(John) 'It's really strange.
It's like she never really existed,

1351
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:51,599
'She was a figment of our imagination
and she was a story.

1352
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,599
'It was like someone
that we all just made up,

1353
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,399
'partly because we let someone
disappear off and die.'

1354
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,402
Someone we all knew
and thought we cared about.

1355
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,361
If you laid it out in a book form,

1356
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:03,199
you'd be thinking,

1357
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,119
"This has got to be fiction."

1358
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,043
But this is real life.

1359
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,919
The debate about living
in dislocated societies,

1360
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,759
not having communities any more,

1361
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:14,679
it's been banging on for ages
and it's just been a son of theory.

1362
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:16,639
And this is like the living reality of it.

1363
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:19,439
I often thought
about what she was doing

1364
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:23,359
and most of the time I actually thought
that she was already dead.

1365
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:26,239
We all have to think
about how we live our lives a bit more

1366
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:31,041
and stop this crazy existence where
we don't have time for friends or family.

1367
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,999
We only have time
to go shopping, ironically.

1368
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,799
Wood Green Shopping City!

1369
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,759
Even in this 21st century,

1370
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,728
you still can fall through the cracks.

1371
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:44,399
She may change the way people think
in a very tiny way.

1372
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,239
You know,
<i>"I'll go and check my neighbour."</i>

1373
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,288
Or, "Maybe I haven't seen
my friend for a year.

1374
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:52,162
"I'm going to go
and get in contact with them.“

1375
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,879
So I think
that's what she'll leave behind.

1376
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:59,719
Everybody I've spoken to from then,
they're like,

1377
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:01,688
"Joyce? You're kidding!"

1378
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,448
The only person
I think may have been...

1379
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:11,319
One of the closest people in her life
was probably Martin.

1380
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:13,199
I still wish...

1381
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:18,119
I still wish that
they'd got together and married.

1382
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:21,010
Because she'd still be here.
I'm sure she'd still be here.

1383
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:23,761
I wish you'd rung me.

1384
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,485
Cos I would have helped
cos I love you.

1385

(TV) And this is his 13th century
common discovery,

1386
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,079
which I think is a pretty good record.

1387

1388

I Surely this is not what I need

1393
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:45,284
I Shut out everyone

1394
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:50,085
I And watch me run

1395
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:54,919
I Lay me under the sun

1396

1397
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,640

(Mandela) Now we,
as people of South Africa,

1404
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:14,611
