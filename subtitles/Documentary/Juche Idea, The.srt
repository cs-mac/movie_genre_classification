<i>ANDREW MARR: Our planet
is in the middle of a mass extinction.</i>

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,356
<i>It's estimated that every hour
three species are lost forever.</i>

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,797
<i>That's 70 a day, 500 a week,</i>

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,390
<i>27,000 species every year,</i>

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,554
<i>which would make it the fastest rate
of extinction in the Earth's history.</i>

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,790
<i>And there's no doubt about the cause,</i>

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,154
<i>it's us.</i>

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,517
150 years ago, Charles Darwin
gave us the key to understanding

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,037
the intricate connections
between all life on Earth.

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,069
Remove or damage one part
of the delicate web of life,

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,789
and you can cause catastrophic
consequences elsewhere.

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,112
But we have been reluctant
to listen and slow to act.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,476
<i>In this programme,
I'm going to discover how Darwin</i>

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,758
<i>opened our eyes to the beautiful
but fragile relationship</i>

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,876
<i>between all life on Earth,</i>

16
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,992
<i>how we've struggled
to understand and accept</i>

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,594
<i>the full implications of his legacy,</i>

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,192
<i>and how Darwin has given us
the knowledge we need</i>

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,717
<i>to help avert one of the greatest
disasters in the history of our planet.</i>

20
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,869
We are causing mass extinctions,

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,589
including, perhaps, our own,
because we're not alone.

22
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,754
We are part of a great web of life,
and if we wreck that web, we go, too.

23
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,590
The answers to this challenge
aren't easy,

24
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,750
but they're not impossible either.

25
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,752
Just so long as we at last understand

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,233
the scale and the urgency
of Charles Darwin's dangerous idea.

27
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,673
<i>In 1832, aged just 23,
Charles Darwin arrived here in Argentina</i>

28
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,435
<i>on board the government survey ship,
H.M.S. Beagle.</i>

29
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,517
<i>In this wild, seemingly empty landscape,</i>

30
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,036
<i>he would make one of
his most significant discoveries.</i>

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,797
<i>When the Beagle dropped anchor</i>

32
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,917
near the small military outpost
of BahÃ­a Blanca,

33
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,998
Charles Darwin was deeply unimpressed.

34
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,234
He wrote in his diary, "I never saw
any place before so entirely destitute

35
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,436
"of living creatures."

36
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:06,436
But this admittedly rather bleak beach
had a surprise in store.

37
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,640
It would help Darwin unlock some
of the mysteries of the natural world.

38
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,317
And these clues came
not from the living, but from the dead.

39
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,159
<i>Strolling along
this battered cliff face,</i>

40
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,233
<i>Darwin came across
some gigantic fossilised bones.</i>

41
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,279
This was a big moment for Darwin.

42
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,952
The next morning, he came rushing back

43
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,156
to see if he could find
some more fossils,

44
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,710
and this time he really struck lucky.

45
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,394
He spotted something
much more impressive

46
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,995
and he spent three hours digging it out.

47
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,719
"To my great joy," he noted,

48
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:02,239
"I found the skull of some large animal
embedded in a soft rock."

49
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,033
It looked to him like
some kind of giant mammal,

50
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,395
but he wasn't entirely sure.

51
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,869
"As far as I can judge," he wrote,

52
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,679
"it is allied to the rhinoceros."

53
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,159
<i>But it was unlike
any rhinoceros living at the time.</i>

54
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,028
<i>Darwin was thrilled by the thought
that, just possibly,</i>

55
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,671
<i>the giant bones might belong
to an ancient, extinct species.</i>

56
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,589
<i>The idea of extinction was
still quite new.</i>

57
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,797
<i>Most people thought it was
the result of the great flood</i>

58
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,553
<i>sent by God to punish man,</i>

59
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,030
<i>as described in the Bible story
of Noah's Ark.</i>

60
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,476
<i>Darwin doubted this.</i>

61
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,995
<i>The evidence in the rocks suggested
that his fossil species</i>

62
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,516
<i>had not been killed
by a violent Biblical catastrophe.</i>

63
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,599
<i>They seemed to have died
during a state of tranquillity.</i>

64
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,959
<i>He was starting to think extinction
might be a regular fact of nature.</i>

65
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,429
And he found new evidence
everywhere he looked.

66
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,150
Mingled among the fossilised bones
of extinct mammals,

67
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,277
he found fossilised seashells.

68
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,796
And yet, they were
the same species of sea creature

69
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,429
he could see happily living
in the water nearby.

70
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,038
So, why did some animals become extinct
and others survive?

71
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,908
Big question, and Darwin would
chew it over for years to come.

72
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,637
<i>Heading out with the gauchos,</i>

73
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,395
<i>Darwin revelled in sleeping rough
and living off the land.</i>

74
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,949
<i>In a letter home, he said
that his experiences in Argentina</i>

75
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,318
<i>were giving him a most strange
assemblage of ideas.</i>

76
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,356
Out on the Argentine Pampas,

77
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,079
Darwin came into close contact
with the local wildlife,

78
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,551
and he was particularly fond
of the plucky little armadillo,

79
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,871
which, perhaps sadly,
was often served up for dinner.

80
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,669
One evening, picking through
the bones on his dinner plate,

81
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,991
Darwin realised
that they were uncannily similar

82
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,551
to the giant fossilised bones
he'd been digging out of the ground.

83
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,352
<i>Darwin now saw that he had
some kind of extinct armadillo</i>

84
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,476
<i>in his fossil collection.</i>

85
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,518
<i>Only, one the size of a small horse.</i>

86
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,914
<i>He also thought he had fossils
of giant llamas and sloths,</i>

87
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,753
<i>which would have stood
three metres tall.</i>

88
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,196
<i>Eureka! Darwin saw a clear link
between his ancient fossils</i>

89
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,033
<i>and the animals now living
on the Pampas.</i>

90
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,113
Darwin became increasingly excited
by what he called,

91
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,194
"This wonderful relationship
between the dead and the living."

92
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,429
Why were modern species
so similar to extinct ones?

93
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,756
What was the connection between
the still living and the long dead?

94
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,593
<i>Darwin would return
to these questions again and again.</i>

95
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,112
<i>During the rest of his five-year voyage
on the Beagle,</i>

96
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,988
<i>he saw many extraordinary things
that fuelled his curiosity</i>

97
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,514
<i>about the nature of life on Earth.</i>

98
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,678
<i>But it was his discoveries
here in Argentina</i>

99
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,230
<i>that first gave him the idea
that extinction was</i>

100
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,677
<i>a vital and necessary part
of the process of evolution.</i>

101
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,869
By the time he left Argentina,
Darwin was asking all sorts of questions

102
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,078
about life and death
and survival and extinction.

103
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,674
He always said
that what he discovered in South America

104
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,309
was crucial to his understanding of,
what was for him,

105
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,949
the mystery of mysteries.
The origin of species.

106
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,994
<i>There wasn't
a lot of space aboard the Beagle,</i>

107
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,756
<i>so Darwin sent his strange,
giant fossils home to England,</i>

108
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:55,472
<i>back to his former Cambridge tutor,
the reverend John Henslow.</i>

109
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,269
<i>"I trust they will be recognised,"
he wrote.</i>

110
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,157
<i>And they were.</i>

111
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,038
<i>Henslow was so excited
that in Darwin's absence</i>

112
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,588
<i>he arranged for them to go on show.</i>

113
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,512
Towards the end of his voyage,
Darwin got a letter from his sister

114
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,310
saying that his fossil discoveries
were already making him famous.

115
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,428
Now even great minds need a bit
of great PR, and Darwin had plenty.

116
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,513
Henslow was already whipping up
excitement among the Cambridge dons

117
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,592
by reading extracts
from Darwin's letters,

118
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,116
and a very famous geologist
called Adam Sedgwick

119
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,433
went to see his father to announce
that Charles was about to take his place

120
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,318
among the leading scientific figures.

121
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,190
<i>By the time Darwin returned
to England in October 1836,</i>

122
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,558
<i>his fossils had indeed
made him a scientific celebrity.</i>

123
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,278
<i>He rather liked the attention at first,</i>

124
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,070
<i>but burdened by his thoughts
about life, death and extinction,</i>

125
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,038
<i>he soon began to retreat
from the limelight.</i>

126
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,754
<i>He knew he had the seed
of a dangerous idea,</i>

127
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,469
<i>one that would undermine
the Bible and Christian teaching.</i>

128
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,713
The accepted belief was
that species were fixed,

129
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,238
unchanged and unchangeable
since their creation by God.

130
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,314
But ever since his time abroad,
Darwin was having vague doubts

131
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,914
about the permanence of species,

132
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,597
and he began to believe that one species
does change into another,

133
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,915
and that species which didn't change
would become extinct.

134
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,308
<i>At first, Darwin kept his most
provocative thoughts to himself,</i>

135
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,198
<i>but he couldn't quite keep
his mouth shut.</i>

136
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,673
<i>He needed help to develop his theory</i>

137
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,719
<i>and he turned to
the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker,</i>

138
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,679
<i>who later became director
of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew.</i>

139
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,517
Darwin was a cautious man

140
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,876
with a deep fear
of public humiliation and rejection,

141
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,996
but he felt to close Joseph Hooker,
comfortable with him,

142
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,108
and he began to give him
the first details of his dangerous idea.

143
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,556
There's a letter to Hooker,
in January 1844,

144
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,272
which reveals Darwin's deep dread
of the work he was engaged in.

145
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,511
"I am almost convinced," he wrote,

146
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,319
"quite contrary to the opinion
I first had,

147
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,836
"that species are not immutable.

148
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,070
"They do change."

149
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,798
And he confided,

150
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,988
"It is like confessing a murder."

151
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,470
<i>Darwin suspected
his theory of evolution would upset,</i>

152
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,873
<i>even enrage, many fellow Victorians,
and it was a tough message.</i>

153
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,828
<i>He saw that, in nature,
only a tiny fraction of those born</i>

154
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,832
<i>survived to produce
offspring themselves.</i>

155
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,436
<i>He thought the natural forces
limiting the chances of survival</i>

156
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,557
<i>might also drive species to change.</i>

157
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,109
Darwin saw that life
was a struggle for existence,

158
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,272
but that this struggle was
a fight not just between

159
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,828
individuals or even between species,

160
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,469
but with the physical
conditions of life.

161
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,311
The environment.

162
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,995
Those animals well-adapted
to their environment

163
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,992
would live and produce offspring

164
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,471
and pass on their useful adaptations
to the next generation.

165
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,869
Those not well-adapted would die.

166
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,279
<i>Darwin believed
he'd discovered the mechanism</i>

167
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,272
<i>which drove evolutionary change.</i>

168
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,477
<i>He had, and it gave him
a profound insight,</i>

169
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,074
<i>one that would later lead us
to a deeper understanding</i>

170
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,913
<i>of our relationship
with the environment.</i>

171
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,475
<i>He saw that all life is connected
through the struggle for survival.</i>

172
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,597
<i>Relationships exist
between members of the same species,</i>

173
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,557
<i>between predator and prey,</i>

174
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,270
<i>and between the living world
and the physical environment.</i>

175
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,319
<i>Darwin wrote that all living things
are bound together</i>

176
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,039
<i>by a web of complex relations.</i>

177
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,108
<i>But Darwin was a cautious man
and he spent the next 15 years</i>

178
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,953
<i>gathering evidence
to support his theory.</i>

179
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,193
<i>Unknown to Darwin,
thousands of miles away</i>

180
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,952
<i>in the jungles of Indonesia,</i>

181
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,397
<i>an explorer and naturalist
called Alfred Russel Wallace</i>

182
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,109
<i>was soon wrestling
with exactly the same ideas.</i>

183
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,158
<i>The two men could
hardly have been more different.</i>

184
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,550
<i>Darwin was a wealthy member
of the scientific Ã©lite.</i>

185
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,835
<i>Wallace struggled to make ends meet,</i>

186
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,832
<i>often paying his way
by collecting animals</i>

187
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,037
<i>to sell to rich naturalists like Darwin.</i>

188
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,198
<i>During one of his expeditions,
Wallace was struck down with malaria.</i>

189
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,754
In February 1858,
burning up with a malarial fever,

190
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,515
Wallace was facing his own mortality.

191
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,239
Stuck out in a little hut
in the middle of the jungle,

192
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,758
he also began to ask
why some die and some live,

193
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:20,597
and he came to the conclusion
that those animals capable of adapting

194
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,951
to the changing conditions
around them would survive,

195
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,352
while unmodified creatures
would die out and disappear.

196
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,194
Wallace recovered from his fever

197
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,034
and then he wrote a letter
to Charles Darwin.

198
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,552
<i>Darwin was horrified,
shaken to the core.</i>

199
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,918
<i>"All my originality will be smashed,"
he wrote.</i>

200
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,911
<i>Wallace had arrived
at the same conclusion</i>

201
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,310
<i>that Darwin had been sitting on
for nearly 20 years.</i>

202
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,197
<i>Darwin's friends and allies urged him</i>

203
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,589
<i>to finish his book
as quickly as possible.</i>

204
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,194
<i>Faced with the threat
of being pipped to the post,</i>

205
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,670
<i>at last he found
the courage to go public.</i>

206
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,558
<i>In November 1859, Darwin finally
published his earth-shaker,</i>

207
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,631
On the Origin of Species.

208
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,514
Darwin ensured his place
in world history

209
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,797
by presenting to the public
his laws of life,

210
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,189
what became known
as the theory of evolution

211
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,350
by natural selection.

212
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,389
And Wallace, poor guy,
became the forgotten man of evolution.

213
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,998
<i>Just as Darwin feared,
his book was greeted with outrage.</i>

214
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,594
<i>The uproar rested
almost entirely on the suggestion</i>

215
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,514
<i>that man is an animal,
and that we are related to apes.</i>

216
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,833
<i>At the time, Darwin's vital insight
into the intricate connections of life</i>

217
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,310
<i>on Earth was almost entirely overlooked.</i>

218
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,475
<i>One of his most fervent supporters,
a German scientist called Ernst Haeckel,</i>

219
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,950
<i>did see behind
the immediate shock headlines.</i>

220
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,194
<i>Darwin's ideas inspired him
to define a whole new science.</i>

221
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,750
<i>He called it ecology and described it</i>

222
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,355
<i>as the study of
all those complex interrelations</i>

223
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,116
<i>referred to by Darwin as the conditions
of the struggle for existence.</i>

224
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,594
<i>For many decades to come, the science
of ecology was hardly more than a word,</i>

225
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,150
<i>but working away
in the jungles of Indonesia,</i>

226
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,437
<i>Alfred Russel Wallace
was one of the first to witness</i>

227
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,674
<i>the ecological implications
of Darwin's web of interconnections.</i>

228
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,636
<i>Wallace agreed that extinction
was a natural part of evolution,</i>

229
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,473
<i>but as the Indonesian
rainforests were felled</i>

230
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,676
<i>to make way for tea plantations,</i>

231
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,672
<i>Wallace began to see
that extinction was something</i>

232
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,958
<i>that could also be brought about
when mankind interfered</i>

233
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,955
<i>with what he called
the nicely balanced relations of nature.</i>

234
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,032
Decades ahead of his time,
Alfred Russel Wallace warned

235
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,908
that if ever mankind
penetrated the recesses

236
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,877
of the virgin forest,

237
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,478
he would bring about the extinction
of numerous forms of life.

238
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:38,396
Humanity now had the power
to change the environment so fast

239
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,793
that many ancient species
would lose the struggle to survive.

240
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,278
<i>Charles Darwin's awareness</i>

241
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,828
<i>of the profound
and surprising connections</i>

242
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,392
<i>that exist between species was,
to start with, pushed to one side,</i>

243
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,316
<i>but for the rest of his life,</i>

244
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,757
<i>he continued to explore
these linkages in nature.</i>

245
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,912
<i>Darwin discovered that many species
depend on each other</i>

246
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,357
<i>with far-reaching implications
for our own survival.</i>

247
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,395
<i>At the age of 72,
just a year before his death,</i>

248
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,199
<i>Darwin published his final book.</i>

249
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,478
<i>Its subject matter had captivated him
for more than 40 years,</i>

250
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,712
<i>most of them spent working here
at Down House, his home in Kent.</i>

251
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,071
Darwin's last book was about worms.

252
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,674
He gave it a catchy little title,

253
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,517
<i>The Formation of Vegetable Mould
by the Action of Worms,</i>

254
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,956
<i>With Observations on Their Habits.</i>

255
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,549
Unlike Darwin's earlier work,

256
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,349
his worm book was
widely applauded and celebrated.

257
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,632
<i>During his lifetime,
it hugely outsold The Origin of Species.</i>

258
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,388
In it, he wrote that,
"The humble earthworm

259
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,314
"has played a more important part
in the history of the world

260
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,836
"than most persons would
at first suppose."

261
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,551
<i>Darwin conducted endless experiments
on his garden worms,</i>

262
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,474
<i>studying their anatomy and behaviour
with fascination.</i>

263
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,072
<i>He revealed how earthworms
carry out their stupendous work</i>

264
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,151
<i>as nature's ploughmen.</i>

265
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,035
<i>He saw that worms prepare the ground,
recycle nutrients</i>

266
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,554
<i>and help the germination of seeds.</i>

267
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,756
<i>Darwin traced the impact
of the humble earthworm</i>

268
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,752
<i>and concluded
that these little wrigglers</i>

269
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,593
<i>play a vital role in our lives.</i>

270
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,829
In his autobiography,
Charles Darwin wrote

271
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:13,712
that he was superior to
the common run of men in noticing things

272
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,031
which easily escape attention.

273
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,919
Even at the end of his life,
his astute observations

274
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,755
were giving us vital clues
about how our survival depends on

275
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,597
what he called
an invisible web of complex relations.

276
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:40,028
Even the loss of an organism
as apparently lowly as the earthworm

277
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,672
would make large parts of this planet
hostile to human survival.

278
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,356
<i>Darwin's dangerous idea contained
a vital insight</i>

279
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,069
<i>into mankind's relationship
with the world around us,</i>

280
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,795
<i>and it came at an important
moment in history.</i>

281
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,592
<i>Britain was changing very fast.</i>

282
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,593
<i>The look, sounds and smells
of much of the country</i>

283
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,229
<i>were being overwhelmed
by the development of the steam engine</i>

284
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,834
<i>and the rise of the factory system.</i>

285
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,117
<i>The Industrial Revolution
was literally casting</i>

286
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,670
<i>an ominous shadow over the environment.</i>

287
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,793
<i>By the 1880s,
voices of concern were being raised,</i>

288
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,189
<i>but not by scientists.</i>

289
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,552
<i>The artist, writer
and Utopian socialist William Morris</i>

290
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,837
<i>was among the leading Victorians
to publicly question</i>

291
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,354
<i>the benefits of industrialisation.</i>

292
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,839
William Morris was enraged

293
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,912
by the appalling living
and working conditions

294
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,436
being forced
on the industrial working classes.

295
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,193
But he also had grave concerns

296
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,955
about our changing relationship
with nature.

297
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,117
"The latest danger civilisation
is threatened with," he said,

298
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,829
"is a danger of her own breeding."

299
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,230
And in one of his famous
lectures, he said that,

300
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,073
"The beauty of the face of the Earth

301
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:31,076
"was disappearing beneath
a crust of unutterable grime."

302
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,513
<i>Morris campaigned to preserve
the beauty of the countryside</i>

303
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,592
<i>for the enjoyment
of the working classes.</i>

304
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,958
<i>At this stage, Darwin's insights
still hadn't been used to shed light</i>

305
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,793
<i>on the wider impact
of industrialisation.</i>

306
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:56,073
<i>Enter an amateur moth collector
called James W. Tutt.</i>

307
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,038
<i>He was about to apply
Darwin's ideas to solve</i>

308
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,194
<i>one of the great environmental mysteries
of the industrial age.</i>

309
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,274
James W. Tutt was
an enthusiastic Darwinist

310
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,674
who devoted his life
to the study of moths.

311
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:22,557
Devoted, enthusiastic,
more than 900 articles, mainly on moths.

312
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,871
Twenty books, moths again.

313
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:31,114
But he's remembered for just one thing
he noticed about one moth.

314
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,273
<i>Biston betularia, or the peppered moth.</i>

315
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,589
<i>Peppered moths had
excellent pale camouflage</i>

316
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,071
<i>and were almost invisible
on pale, lichen-covered trees.</i>

317
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,392
<i>But there was
also a dark form of the moth.</i>

318
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,675
<i>This was much rarer
than the pale variety,</i>

319
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,435
<i>as it was easily spotted
and eaten by birds.</i>

320
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,593
<i>By the mid-1800s, entomologists were
puzzled by something strange.</i>

321
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,195
<i>In areas pumping out foul, sooty smoke,</i>

322
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,796
<i>the darker form of the peppered moth
had dramatically increased in number.</i>

323
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,958
James Tutt noticed
that the pale peppered moth

324
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,271
stood out against the dark,
soot-blackened trees,

325
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,672
very conspicuous,
easy for birds to pick off.

326
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:32,198
But the darker version was
now very well camouflaged

327
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,317
and it thrived and multiplied.

328
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,234
Tutt suggested
that by polluting the environment,

329
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:45,919
humanity was now directly affecting
natural selection for the peppered moth.

330
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,034
<i>By 1896, when Tutt published
his book, British Moths,</i>

331
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:00,036
<i>98% of peppered moths in the polluted
industrial north were black.</i>

332
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,391
<i>His study remains
the classic textbook example</i>

333
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,869
<i>of Darwinian selection in action.</i>

334
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,159
<i>Tutt had shown that by radically
changing the environment,</i>

335
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,835
<i>humanity had the power
to change the course of evolution.</i>

336
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,953
Charles Darwin understood
that environmental change

337
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,589
was a significant motor
behind evolution.

338
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:32,112
"When a country undergoes
some physical change," he wrote,

339
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,354
"the original inhabitants must cease
to be as perfectly adapted

340
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,908
"to the changed conditions."

341
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,276
But he thought this happened slowly.

342
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,514
What James Tutt had witnessed
was a much faster process,

343
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,034
now driven by us.

(ENGINE REVVING)

345
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,679
<i>By the early 20th century,
we were just beginning to grasp</i>

346
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,117
<i>the wider implications of Darwin's
understanding of the web of life.</i>

347
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,872
<i>In the 1920s,
a rebellious young zoologist</i>

348
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,158
<i>called Charles Elton was one
of the first to study the relationship</i>

349
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,119
<i>between animal populations
and the environment.</i>

350
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,632
<i>The science of ecology was
at last about to come into its own.</i>

351
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,432
<i>In 1926, Elton set out
with three colleagues and 20 mousetraps</i>

352
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,830
<i>to begin a detailed study
of the rodent population</i>

353
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,155
<i>in Bagley Woods, near Oxford.</i>

354
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,835
When Charles Elton came
to check his traps

355
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,435
on the first morning of the study,
big disappointment.

356
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,394
Three mice, one vole.

357
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,400
But they were persistent fellows,
he and his team,

358
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,917
and over the next three years,
they set 70,000 such traps

359
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,073
and collected data on innumerable
thousands of specimens.

360
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,072
They called themselves
the Mouse Society.

361
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,550
<i>Elton discovered
that the size of the rodent population</i>

362
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,349
<i>fluctuated with astounding regularity.</i>

363
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,830
<i>He saw how changes in the environment,
such as weather,</i>

364
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,070
<i>food availability and disease</i>

365
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,199
<i>could directly affect the size
of animal populations,</i>

366
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:35,196
<i>and this could have highly disruptive
impacts on the local ecology.</i>

367
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,428
The rat is a public enemy.

368
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,308
He takes our food
and endangers our health.

369

<i>We can help you to rout the rat.</i>

372
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,039
During the Second World War,
the government turned to Elton

373
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,396
for his knowledge of animal populations.

374
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,553
Their problem was
that the huge food storage depots

375
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,316
essential to the war effort
were being overrun by rats and mice.

(SQUEAKING)

377
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,914
They were eating the equivalent
of a shipload of food every month.

378
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,037
Not what the ministry had planned for.

379
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,908
They drafted in Elton
to help control the pest problem,

380
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,917
and that set him thinking about
what he called ecological explosions.

(SQUEAKING)

382
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:42,749
<i>Elton pointed out that by gathering
so much food in one place,</i>

383
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,310
<i>humans had changed
the rats' normal environment,</i>

384
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,149
<i>in this case,
causing an explosion in numbers.</i>

385
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,552
<i>This wartime experience inspired
Charles Elton to study</i>

386
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,155
<i>population explosions around the world.</i>

387
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,872
<i>He saw that human activity
could alter local environments,</i>

388
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,112
<i>often with devastating
and unpredictable effects.</i>

389
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:16,473
<i>He was the first to grasp the scale
of man's impact on the web of life.</i>

390
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,549
Elton spelt out the consequences
of mankind's growing interference

391
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,119
in the natural world.

392
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,194
He issued
an early environmental warning cry.

393
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,875
"We are living in a period
in the world's history," he wrote,

394
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,270
"when the mingling of thousands
of kinds of organisms

395
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,194
"from different parts
of the world is setting up

396
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,317
"terrific dislocations in nature."

397
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,870
And our impact on the planet was
about to accelerate.

398
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,910
<i>To increase food production
after the Second World War,</i>

399
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,836
<i>there was a massive expansion
in intensive, mechanised farming.</i>

400
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,708
<i>This in turn caused
an explosion of pests.</i>

401
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,795
<i>Scientists thought they'd come up
with a fail-safe, high-tech answer.</i>

402
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,518
<i>Pesticide sprays!</i>

403
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,557
<i>But in our attempts
to manipulate nature,</i>

404
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,438
<i>we were finally forced to come to terms</i>

405
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,910
<i>with the full implications
of Darwin's web of life.</i>

406
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,993
<i>In 1956, the United States'
Department of Agriculture</i>

407
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:41,394
<i>began spraying millions of acres
with the chemical insecticide DDT.</i>

408
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,032
DDT was dropped indiscriminately

409
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,638
on ponds and waterways,
livestock, even on children.

410
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,636
There were reports that one beekeeper
lost 800 colonies of bees,

411
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,757
and a horse seen drinking
from its water trough

412
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,276
was found dead hours later.

413
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,796
The local wildlife was devastated.

414
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,000
One ecologist called it
"an amazing rain of death".

415
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,510
<i>In the small town
of West Southport, in Maine,</i>

416
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,549
<i>a biologist called Rachel Carson
received a letter from a friend</i>

417
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,757
<i>telling her that all the birds
in her garden had died</i>

418
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,513
<i>soon after the sprayers had flown over.</i>

419
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,548
<i>Carson started investigating.</i>

420
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,632
<i>She discovered that the indiscriminate
spraying of pesticides</i>

421
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,192
<i>was killing not just pests,
but insects beneficial to agriculture.</i>

422
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,671
<i>And that was
just the start of the story.</i>

423
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,472
<i>We poison the caddis flies
in the stream,</i>

424
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,439
<i>and the poison travels
from link to link of the food chain,</i>

425
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,229
<i>and soon the birds
of the lake margins become its victims,</i>

426
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,790
<i>and the following springs are
silent of robin song.</i>

427
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,631
Rachel Carson was ill at the time.

428
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,269
She was fighting breast cancer,
but she felt she had to do something

429
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,036
about what she saw
as an impending ecological catastrophe.

430
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,073
"I seem now to have, as writers should,

431
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,790
"a sense of urgency and passing time,"
she wrote,

432
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,711
"and so much to say."

433
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,233
In 1962, Rachel Carson published
one of the most influential books

434
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,517
<i>of the 20th century, Silent Spring.</i>

435
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,195
<i>Silent Spring was
a surprise bestseller.</i>

436
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,875
<i>In it, Carson used
Darwin's theory of evolution</i>

437
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,078
<i>to explain the far-reaching effects
of spraying DDT.</i>

438
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,148
<i>Using his key insight that animals adapt
to changing environments,</i>

439
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,674
<i>she came to a chilling conclusion.</i>

440
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,315
Carson dug up the fact
that the pest insects

441
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,188
were developing a resistance
to the insecticide,

442
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,158
something she described
as a triumphant vindication

443
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,028
of Darwin's principle
of survival of the fittest.

444
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,994
She pointed out that the insects
had evolved super races

445
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,153
immune to the particular
insecticide used,

446
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,995
so that a deadlier one has
always to be developed,

447
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,390
and then a deadlier one than that.

448
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:51,272
So this was an arms race against nature
that man could never win.

449
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,594
<i>Silent Spring triggered intense debate</i>

450
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,752
<i>about the indiscriminate use
of pesticides.</i>

451
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:05,516
<i>Many scientists from the chemical
industry briskly rejected her findings.</i>

452
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,389
<i>The major claims in Ms Rachel Carson's
book, Silent Spring,</i>

453
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,994
are gross distortions
of the actual facts.

454
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:20,469
<i>MARR: Carson was subjected
to a sustained and personal attack.</i>

455
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,836
<i>Struggling with her own illness,
she defended her discoveries</i>

456
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,956
<i>with steely determination.</i>

457
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,759
One U.S. Government
scientist accused her of

458
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,719
"reckless misinterpretation
of the scientific facts".

459
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,951
And in a sinister echo
of the McCarthy era,

460
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,079
a politician simply branded
her a communist.

461
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,152
The intensity of the attacks
on Rachel Carson

462
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,391
were compared directly
to the assault on Charles Darwin

463
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,950
<i>when he published The Origin of Species.</i>

464
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,318
<i>The New York Times
summed up the mood with a headline,</i>

465
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,631
<i>"Silent Spring Is Now Noisy Summer."</i>

466
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,312
<i>MARR: Not everyone rejected
Carson's claims.</i>

467
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,712
<i>When asked at a press conference
about the long-term effects of DDT,</i>

468
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,476
<i>President John F. Kennedy
referred to Rachel Carson's work.</i>

469
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,757
<i>The U.S. Government
then launched a full investigation.</i>

470
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,833
<i>Silent Spring was found
to be a disturbingly accurate</i>

471
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,754
<i>and, if anything,
understated account of the situation.</i>

472
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,993
<i>Our eyes were finally opened
to the urgency of Darwin's discoveries</i>

473
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,674
<i>about the interconnections in nature.</i>

474
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,192
<i>Two years after Silent Spring
was published,</i>

475
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,636
Rachel Carson died at the age of 56.

476
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,033
Decades on, her book is regarded
as the original battle cry

477
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,395
for the modern environmental movement.

478
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,032
<i>COMMENTATOR: The rocket is beginning
to rise agonisingly slowly,</i>

479

we're on our way into space.</i>

480
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,795
<i>MARR: At the dawn of the 1960s,</i>

<i>as we started to unlock
the secrets of the solar system,</i>

482
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:15,549
<i>Darwin's dangerous idea
was about to go far out.</i>

483
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,270
<i>(ON RADIO) Oh, that view is tremendous.</i>

484
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,437
<i>MARR: In the small Wiltshire village
of Bowerchalke,</i>

485
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,275
<i>a scientist called James Lovelock
was working freelance for NASA.</i>

486
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,828
<i>Studying data on the Martian atmosphere,</i>

487
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,913
<i>Lovelock was exploring the possibility
of life on the Red Planet.</i>

488
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,275
The more Lovelock learned

489
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,875
that Mars' atmosphere was
hostile to life,

490
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,830
the more amazed he became about
our planet's ability to sustain life.

491
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,998
Working away in this cottage,

492
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:09,232
what his bosses at NASA
called his thatched lab,

493
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,312
Lovelock began to wonder.

494
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,235
How was it that the Earth's
atmosphere was able to sustain

495
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,278
exactly the right composition of gasses

496
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:25,480
over so many millions of years
to allow life to flourish?

497
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,800
His answer would propel Charles Darwin's
ideas about life on Earth

498
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,598
into the space age.

499
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,830
<i>Darwin showed us how living organisms</i>

500
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,835
<i>are connected to their local environment
through the struggle for existence.</i>

501
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,435
<i>James Lovelock took this much further.</i>

502
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,389
<i>Describing his theory as an offshoot
of Darwin's great vision,</i>

503
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,789
<i>he believed that the vital connections</i>

504
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,316
<i>existed also on a huge scale,
right across the planet.</i>

505
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,634
Ever since his school days,

506
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,951
Lovelock had been inspired
by Charles Darwin,

507
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,350
but he was now uncovering
a much deeper relationship

508
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,749
between life and the planet

509
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,308
than anything Darwin
could have imagined.

510
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,916
Lovelock was developing a theory
that the Earth as a whole

511
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,755
was behaving like a self-regulating
living organism.

512
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,593
He was the first to describe
a global ecosystem.

513
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,508
<i>Lovelock believed
that plants and animals help regulate</i>

514
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,830
<i>the physical environment of the Earth.</i>

515
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,593
<i>He called this biological feedback,</i>

516
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,753
<i>and he suggested that the oceans,
the land, the atmosphere</i>

517
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,638
<i>and all living things form a vast,</i>

518
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,315
<i>delicately balanced system
of interconnections.</i>

519
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,749
<i>Lovelock was keen to share his ideas.</i>

520
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,877
<i>As it happened, one of his neighbours
was the author, William Golding,</i>

521
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,996
<i>who wrote Lord of the Flies.</i>

522
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,389
<i>The two men spent afternoons chatting</i>

523
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,472
<i>about space research
and science fiction.</i>

524
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,238
One winter morning in 1967,

525
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,630
James Lovelock was walking along
on his way to the post office

526
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,439
when he bumped into William Golding.

527
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,479
And he began excitedly
to tell the novelist about his ideas

528
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,836
of the Earth being
a self-regulating entity.

529
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,953
Golding was impressed
and he told Lovelock,

530
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,749
"If you're going to propagate
a large idea about the Earth,

531
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,400
"you'd better give it a proper name."

532
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,075
He thought back
to the Greek goddess of the Earth

533
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,628
and suggested "Gaia".

534
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,837
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

535
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,831
<i>Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis</i>

536
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,833
<i>was almost too much in keeping
with the spirit of the age.</i>

537
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,832
<i>As the hippy movement
swept through Europe and America,</i>

538
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,559
<i>its followers seized his ideas</i>

539
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,918
<i>and decided that the Earth
herself was a living thing.</i>

540
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:09,232
<i>Along with free love and flower power,
Gaia became a gospel of the hippy age,</i>

541
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,989
<i>and it wasn't long before the world
was to see Gaia in all her glory.</i>

542

<i>They read aloud the story of creation</i>

the pale blue dot
that is our home looked fragile.

563

This image of earthrise made people
look at the world in a new way.

564
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,631
It emphasised the Earth's vulnerability
and it helped to create

565
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:03,431
a new kind of politics, one which
put the environment at its heart.

566
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,990
<i>In the latter part of the 20th century,
Darwin's knowledge of the relationships</i>

<i>linking plants, animals
and the physical environment</i>

568

<i>we as a species are having
on the whole planet.</i>

570
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,595
<i>One of the habitats where this is
becoming most obvious is the coral reef.</i>

571
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,832
<i>And the first person to write
a scientific study on coral reefs?</i>

572
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,113
<i>Charles Darwin.</i>

573
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,870
Darwin was not a good swimmer,
but when he saw his first coral reefs,

574
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,428
he waded in to get a closer look,

575
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,355
and he described what he saw
as "mountains of stone",

576
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,718
much more impressive than the vast
dimensions of the pyramids,

577
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,989
and yet built by an infinite number
of minute architects.

578
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:31,756
By studying coral reefs,
Darwin would learn key lessons

579
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:36,152
about the relationship between
life and the rest of the planet.

580
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:50,796
<i>Darwin spent nearly two years
writing up a detailed paper</i>

581
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,236
<i>about how the various types
of coral reef are formed.</i>

582
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,991
<i>He concluded that corals
only flourish in shallow water,</i>

583
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,514
<i>building amazing reef structures</i>

584
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:08,799
<i>by growing on top of the rocky skeletons
of previous generations.</i>

585
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,156
Charles Darwin discovered
that coral reefs are intricate

586
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,708
and finely balanced living systems.

587
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,832
He recognised that sunlight,
temperature,

588
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,276
even the chemical composition
of the oceans

589
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,672
regulate the growth
of these dazzling underwater cities.

590
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,398
But he gave us this warning,

591
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,109
"Changes to the composition of the sea

592
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:48,389
"not obvious to our senses
may destroy the coral reefs."

593
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,554
Just sometimes, you wish he hadn't been
such a damned fine prophet.

594
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:03,512
<i>Coral reefs all over the world are
now facing an uncertain future.</i>

595
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,558
<i>With our knowledge
of the interconnected web of life,</i>

596
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,234
<i>we not only know why it's happening,</i>

597
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:14,678
<i>but also that their loss could have
dire effects on our planet as a whole.</i>

598
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,998
<i>Back in the 1950s,
here in the Caribbean,</i>

599
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,755
<i>the biologist Thomas F. Goreau
was the first to understand</i>

600
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:29,150
<i>that corals have evolved
an astonishing partnership.</i>

601
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,395
<i>Microscopic algae growing inside corals</i>

602
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,190
<i>provide them with energy
by converting the sunlight into sugars.</i>

603
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,319
<i>In turn, the corals give the algae
somewhere safe to live.</i>

604
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,951
<i>But Goreau observed that even
small changes in the ocean environment</i>

605
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,828
<i>cause the corals to expel
their algae helpers.</i>

606
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,912
<i>The coral then loses its colour
and begins a slow death,</i>

607
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,594
<i>a process called coral bleaching.</i>

608
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,552
<i>Thomas Goreau Jr continued
and expanded his father's work,</i>

609
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,108
<i>and he made an ominous discovery.</i>

610
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:13,069
<i>Fluctuations in ocean temperature
were causing coral bleaching</i>

611
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,196
<i>all over the world.</i>

612
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:22,070
Throughout the 1980s and the 1990s,
mass coral bleaching was occurring

613
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,835
everywhere where the ocean
temperature had been raised

614
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,956
for a considerable period.

615
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,158
Goreau's work showed
that the coral reefs

616
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,437
were the global warning system
for global warming.

617
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,829
<i>We're all too aware that global warming</i>

618
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,037
<i>is being caused by the accumulation
of greenhouse gases</i>

619
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,237
<i>like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</i>

620
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,756
<i>For millions of years,
coral reefs have played a vital role</i>

621
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:58,391
<i>in countering this effect,
absorbing carbon dioxide from the ocean</i>

622
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,438
<i>and locking it away
in their rocky skeletons.</i>

623
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,273
<i>Thomas Goreau Jr showed
that Darwin's prophecy</i>

624
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:09,194
<i>about the vulnerability of corals
to environmental change</i>

625
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,316
<i>is now established fact,</i>

626
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,473
<i>and their function as a regulator
of the Earth's surface temperature</i>

627
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,232
<i>is also being compromised.</i>

628
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,117
Of all the world's living systems,

629
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,555
coral reefs are
among the most sensitive,

630
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,269
and if the planet's temperatures
carry on rising,

631
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:34,037
they will be the first of the global
habitats to die out completely.

632
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,874
Now, if the planet cools,
they can regenerate,

633
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,157
but at the moment,
they're being simply overwhelmed.

634
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,073
And this is more than a pity,

635
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,836
because if we lose the corals,
we also lose their ability

636
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:53,357
to absorb and lock away carbon dioxide,

637
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,396
and we lose it forever.

638
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:05,630
<i>In the 150 years
since Darwin shared his dangerous idea,</i>

639
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:10,510
<i>scientists have made great progress
in grasping its wider implications</i>

640
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,558
<i>for life, death and extinction.</i>

641
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:17,872
<i>But while we've been struggling
to comprehend his insight,</i>

642
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:22,750
<i>our impact on the planet
has hugely increased.</i>

643
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:27,391
<i>In the tropical rainforests,
mankind's assault on nature</i>

644
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,074
<i>is having a catastrophic effect.</i>

645
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,750
<i>Rainforests cover just 6%
of our planet's surface,</i>

646
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:40,072
<i>but they're home to at least half
of all the species living on Earth.</i>

647
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,999
<i>There's the lush canopy above,</i>

648
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,630
<i>the shadowy forest floor below</i>

649
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:54,353
<i>and the dense, multilayered structure
of astounding complexity in between.</i>

650
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:03,717
When Charles Darwin first saw
a tropical rainforest, he was overcome.

651
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:10,073
He spoke afterwards of feelings
of wonder, astonishment and devotion.

652
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,073
Sounds almost as if he was having
a spiritual experience.

653
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,392
In time, his own work
on the interconnectedness of nature

654
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,076
would help unlock the secrets
of these extraordinary places.

655
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,039
They really are
the boiling cauldrons of evolution.

656
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,796
<i>For more than 100 million years,</i>

657
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,714
<i>rainforests have survived
geological upheavals</i>

658
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,075
<i>and severe climate change.</i>

659
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,754
<i>And throughout this time,
they've been home</i>

660
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,071
<i>to the fastest rate
of evolution on Earth.</i>

661
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,837
<i>But now rainforest plants
and animals face extinction.</i>

662
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:03,317
<i>In 1971, a Berkeley University
biology student called Norman Myers</i>

663
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,709
<i>was studying
the impact of human activity</i>

664
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,394
<i>on the rate of animal extinction.</i>

665
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,076
<i>The textbooks told him that
the estimated global rate of extinction</i>

666
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,072
<i>was around one species per year.</i>

667
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,836
<i>This was the level that Darwin
saw as a normal part</i>

668
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,150
<i>of the evolutionary process.</i>

669
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,992
<i>No cause for alarm.</i>

670
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,833
Lounging around outside one morning,
Norman Myers was going through

671
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:37,712
the statistics on extinctions,
and he noticed a ludicrous omission.

672
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:45,113
The extinction figures gave the rates
for mammals, plants and birds,

673
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,113
which you might have thought
was a pretty comprehensive group,

674
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:55,389
but together they comprise
just 4% of all known species.

675
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,358
The rest are insects
and other invertebrates.

676
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,513
The vast majority of species
on the planet,

677
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,955
and their fate had been forgotten.

678
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,034
<i>Myers investigated further.</i>

679
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,556
<i>He spent the rest of the day
rechecking the official estimates</i>

680
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,551
<i>of the extinction rate.</i>

681
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,191
<i>And then he made a new calculation,</i>

682
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:25,750
<i>this time including invertebrates.</i>

683
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,868
Myers' research tools, he said,

684
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:34,590
"were a pencil,
a pocket calculator and curiosity".

685
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,514
But in the right hands,
a pencil can be devastating.

686
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,593
Myers' calculations showed
that species weren't becoming extinct

687
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:48,550
at the rate of roughly one a year,
but more like the rate of one every day.

688
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,996
The Earth was going through
something terrible.

689
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:57,230
<i>Darwin proposed that there's
a fine balance between extinction</i>

690
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,118
<i>and the birth of new species.</i>

691
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,874
<i>But on five occasions
in the Earth's history,</i>

692
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,750
<i>the fossil record suggests the rate
of extinction increased so much,</i>

693
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,913
<i>it threatened the future
of life on Earth.</i>

694
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,915
<i>We call these catastrophic episodes
mass extinctions.</i>

695
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,709
<i>There are many theories about
what caused them, from global cooling,</i>

696
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:26,193
<i>incredible volcanic activity,
cataclysmic meteor strikes.</i>

697
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,953
<i>But whatever the reason,
each event resulted</i>

698
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:35,991
<i>in the extinction of between 65 and 95%
of all living species on Earth.</i>

699
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,232
Myers was now suggesting
that we are in the middle

700
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:46,839
of the sixth mass extinction,
and this one is being caused by us.

701
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,434
<i>Norman Myers estimated
that this new mass extinction</i>

702
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,399
<i>was the fastest loss of species
ever seen on the planet,</i>

703
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,632
<i>and the greatest number of casualties
was from tropical rainforests.</i>

704
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,914
<i>The rainforests were filled
with an abundance</i>

705
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,639
<i>of especially well-adapted species.</i>

706
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,110
<i>Myers knew from Darwin
that if the forests were destroyed,</i>

707
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,555
<i>these species would
then be poorly adapted</i>

708
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:20,270
<i>to their changed environment
and they'd face rapid extinction.</i>

709
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,912
(CHAINSAW WHIRRING)

710
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:29,275
<i>By the mid-1970s, nearly half
of the world's virgin rainforests</i>

711
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,237
<i>had already been destroyed.</i>

712
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,709
<i>Much of this was caused
by clearing forests</i>

713
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,917
<i>to raise cattle
for the fast-food industry.</i>

714
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,390
<i>What Myers called
the hamburger connection.</i>

715
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,677
<i>And the yearly rate of destruction
was increasing.</i>

716
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,114
<i>Darwin's legacy was
helping us to understand</i>

717
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:54,228
<i>the consequences of our actions,
but it was also giving the tools</i>

718
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,118
<i>to help save the planet
from the full impact</i>

719
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,589
<i>of this man-made mass extinction.</i>

720
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,515
<i>In 1988,
Norman Myers came up with a plan.</i>

721
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,392
Myers discovered that there are
some areas around the world

722
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:15,191
that contain super-high concentrations
of animal and plant species,

723
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,273
and he worked out
that if we could preserve those places,

724
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,397
we had a chance of saving up to a third

725
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,917
of the 10 million or so species
now alive on Earth.

726
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,996
In effect, he was proposing a little
fleet of Darwinian Noah's Arks.

727
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:40,272
<i>Myers called these areas
biodiversity hotspots.</i>

728
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,629
<i>He identified 25 of them
around the world,</i>

729
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,030
<i>including here,
across the islands of the Caribbean.</i>

730
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,474
<i>His hotspots conservation strategy</i>

731
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,518
<i>has attracted nearly
a billion dollars in funding,</i>

732
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,229
<i>but it will be many years
before we can judge its success.</i>

733
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,150
This visionary, optimistic experiment

734
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,710
is based absolutely
on Darwin's original work

735
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,439
on the interconnectedness of all life.

736
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,040
If we remove the rainforests,

737
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:17,750
we also lose their extraordinary,
supercharged ability

738
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,149
to produce new species.

739
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,912
One scientist put it like this,

740
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,915
"Death is one thing.
The end of birth is something else."

741
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,356
<i>Over the last 150 years,</i>

742
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,558
<i>the implications of Charles Darwin's
dangerous idea have slowly</i>

743
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:45,760
<i>but decisively transformed
our understanding of the living world.</i>

744
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,710
<i>His theory of evolution
first caused outrage</i>

745
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,189
<i>by challenging the belief in God.</i>

746
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,233
<i>His description
of the survival of the fittest</i>

747
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,949
<i>was then hijacked to attack
democratic ideals of equality.</i>

748
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:09,071
<i>But his ideas also highlighted
the connection and interdependence</i>

749
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:13,233
<i>between all living things
and the Earth's environment.</i>

750
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:17,108
<i>This vital part of his legacy
has been the most difficult</i>

751
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,794
<i>for us to accept and understand,</i>

752
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,077
<i>and now it is a matter
of life and death.</i>

753
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:30,195
It's taken 150 years for us to catch up
with the full significance

754
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:34,319
of Darwin's theory of evolution
by natural selection.

755
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:40,475
If we want to prolong our own existence,
we have to preserve the environment,

756
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:45,793
the natural world inside which we live.

757
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:50,476
And it's that, not equality
or the existence or not of God,

758
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:57,398
that is the most urgent message
from Darwin's essential idea.

759
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:02,349
We have to change
our behaviour as a species.

760
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:06,877
If we don't, we now know what follows.
