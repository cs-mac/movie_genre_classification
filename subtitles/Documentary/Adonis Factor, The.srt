1
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,167
These few years I keep
having the same dream.

2
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:48,792
I'm struggling in the water.

3
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:51,001
It's so cold.

4
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:55,917
But when I'm about to drown

5
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,417
an arm reaches to me

6
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:04,167
and pulls me up.

7
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:09,334
But I can never see who he is.

8
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:13,292
I only feel the arm and its power.

9
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:15,876
Somehow it feels close to my heart.

10
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:20,876
I need to know who he is.

26
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:27,167
This is our mission...
the target of this operation.

27
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:30,709
They have 5 cars,
bookended by military vehicles.

28
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:32,167
This is our first point of attack.

29
00:03:32,292 --> 00:03:33,917
There are other ambush points.

30
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:35,751
This car will be blown up here.

31
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:38,333
We will then immediately transfer.

32
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:40,334
Leave nothing behind.

33
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:41,876
Understand?

46
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:06,792
Base, confidential documents
have been found here.

57
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:44,042
Ram through it! Ram through it!

129
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:38,459
Son, what do you want to eat?
Mom will cook it for you.

130
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:41,834
No way.

157
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:44,334
Ice's ashes... have been sent back.

158
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:52,459
What happened between her and I...

159
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:56,417
Sorry.

160
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,751
I don't want to waste my time here.

161
00:20:13,876 --> 00:20:14,834
I want to go home.

162
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:47,751
Mrs. Wan has been so worried about you
these months

163
00:20:48,084 --> 00:20:50,292
that her sciatica has worsened.

164
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,334
Nurse Wang.

165
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:56,251
In two weeks,
I will be leaving on a long trip.

166
00:20:57,251 --> 00:20:59,167
But you've just come home.

167
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,876
Yes. I'll keep more money with you.

168
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:04,126
Please continue to take care of my mother.

169
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:07,042
Don't worry.
I'll stay and take care of her.

170
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,251
I didn't cook well today.

171
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:18,084
Mom's cooking always tastes so good.

172
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:35,667
What are you worried about?

173
00:21:36,376 --> 00:21:37,959
I've recovered.

174
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:42,167
I'm on leave,
so I can be with you every day.

175
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:43,834
Eat the food you cook.

176
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:54,334
To miss someone...

177
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:57,001
is a very painful thing.

178
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:03,751
Those months while you were
in the hospital,

179
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:07,042
I had the same dream almost every night.

180
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:11,334
Our whole family was at sea...

181
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:15,084
One by one you'd disappear

182
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,834
until only I was left.

183
00:22:23,251 --> 00:22:24,251
Jon,

184
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:30,917
I have to tell you this.

185
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:36,834
I've always told you your father
abandoned us

186
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:40,667
but the one who gave up on this family...

187
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:43,792
was me.

188
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:52,209
You're not my only son.

189
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:54,667
You have an elder brother.

190
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,417
I married your father when I was 20.

191
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:00,501
We enjoyed life.

192
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:03,876
I never thought about the future

193
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:09,417
until I gave birth to you two boys,

194
00:23:11,334 --> 00:23:13,042
but your father didn't.

195
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:15,459
He only cared about gambling.

196
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:19,709
He lost his job because of it

197
00:23:20,376 --> 00:23:21,834
but he just gambled more.

198
00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:27,959
When you were 2.

199
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:32,376
I thought I'd bring you both with me
then make other plans,

200
00:23:35,334 --> 00:23:36,876
but I didn't count on

201
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:38,834
your brother grasping my hand,
crying and

202
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,376
refusing to let us go.

203
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:45,834
I was desperate;
Afraid your father would come home.

204
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:49,834
In the end,

205
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:52,667
I carried you and left

206
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:55,376
and locked him in at home.

207
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:59,959
When I was downstairs
I heard him crying and screaming.

208
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:03,126
Mom! Don't go!

209
00:24:06,376 --> 00:24:07,709
Mom...

210
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:10,417
Don't be sad. It's in the past.

211
00:24:17,334 --> 00:24:18,959
I've carried this guilt

212
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,459
for over twenty years.

213
00:24:26,126 --> 00:24:26,917
Jon

214
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:29,709
I finally got news of them.

215
00:24:30,126 --> 00:24:33,834
I was thinking of how to get
in touch with them.

216
00:24:34,042 --> 00:24:38,292
But with your injury,
I was so afraid to lose...

217
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:50,667
I'll bring them back.

218
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:53,751
Okay?

219
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:39,917
The numerous crimes the Defendant
has committed over the years

220
00:25:40,084 --> 00:25:46,334
indicates that he is a danger
to society and its people.

221
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:49,751
Defendant Man Yeung,
On the charge of armed robbery

222
00:25:49,959 --> 00:26:00,501
of the Black Pearl Jewelry Shop
on February 5, 2008,

223
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:06,001
I find you guilty and sentence you
to ten years' imprisonment.

224
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:13,334
In addition, for resisting arrest and attacking
a police officer on November 1st, 2010,

225
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:17,876
three years' imprisonment;

226
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:22,917
Both sentences to be served concurrently.

227
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:32,001
Give me the keys!

228
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:57,208
Man Yeung, a 33 year old felon charged with
armed robbery and attacking a police officer,

229
00:27:57,209 --> 00:28:03,167
escaped from the court house after
his trial this afternoon

230
00:28:03,334 --> 00:28:06,251
by jumping off the fourth floor.

231
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:36,792
I found the guy who betrayed you.

232
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:38,209
You'll never guess who it is.

233
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:43,084
See?

234
00:28:47,376 --> 00:28:48,459
Yeung.

235
00:28:52,376 --> 00:28:54,833
You know how I am...

236
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:57,001
I did it only because I had no choice.

237
00:28:57,376 --> 00:28:59,667
10 years of brotherhood, worth how much?

238
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:01,084
30,000 bucks.

239
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:04,501
Yeung, I know I'm not loyal...

240
00:29:04,834 --> 00:29:07,334
I'll change, please give me a chance.

241
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:09,751
Just once...

242
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:14,001
Yeung, please, just one chance.

243
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:16,001
Spare me, please...

244
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:17,917
Yeung!

245
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:27,167
The un-loyal can't stick around.

246
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:34,334
Where are you hiding now?

247
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:40,959
You still don't trust me after so long?

248
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:44,334
I'm a cop.

249
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:46,251
You don't trust a cop?

250
00:29:49,251 --> 00:29:51,209
The pay is $200,000.

251
00:29:51,751 --> 00:29:53,126
After the job, you better disappear.

252
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,042
If you don't...

253
00:29:56,417 --> 00:30:00,001
it's not that you don't trust me,
it's me that can't trust you.

254
00:30:16,209 --> 00:30:17,834
Sir, I'm a doctor.

255
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:20,001
How is he?

256
00:30:20,126 --> 00:30:21,334
He's having a very severe headache.

257
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:23,251
I've already given him
a shot of painkillers.

258
00:30:23,334 --> 00:30:25,001
May I see your medication?

259
00:30:27,376 --> 00:30:29,001
Have you just had surgery?

260
00:30:29,292 --> 00:30:30,167
Yes.

261
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:34,000
Doctor, what is his condition?

262
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:35,334
I think it's the air pressure

263
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,167
that caused his headaches.

264
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:40,334
In any case, please lower the altitude
of the aircraft

265
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:41,876
or he may fall into a coma,

266
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:43,209
which will be very dangerous.

267
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:45,334
I'll try to contact the control tower.

268
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:47,917
Julian, please inform Lumpur.

269
00:30:58,167 --> 00:30:59,292
Feeling better?

270
00:31:01,251 --> 00:31:02,376
Yes, thanks.

271
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:05,334
You shouldn't fly right
after such a major surgery.

272
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:08,292
May I know what surgery you had?

273
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:12,001
I was shot in the head.
They couldn't remove the bullet.

274
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:15,292
Don't worry, I'm a cop.

275
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,917
I know a very reputable neurosurgeon.

276
00:31:20,001 --> 00:31:21,167
I can refer you.

277
00:31:21,334 --> 00:31:22,209
Sure.

278
00:31:30,251 --> 00:31:31,167
I'll meet you tomorrow.

279
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:32,876
Okay. Bye-bye.

280
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:36,751
Can you attend an appointment tomorrow?

281
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:38,042
Yes, thank you.

282
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:39,334
You're welcome.

283
00:31:46,834 --> 00:31:48,167
I have a ride,
may I give you a lift?

284
00:31:48,292 --> 00:31:49,834
That's all right. I'll take a taxi.

285
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:50,834
Dr. Kan.

286
00:31:50,835 --> 00:31:52,001
Hi.

287
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:54,334
Stay in touch.
See you tomorrow.

288
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:08,834
The guy at the airport
looked at me just now.

289
00:33:18,042 --> 00:33:19,376
Follow the white car ahead.

290
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:34,876
Pull over.

291
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,167
What happened?

292
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:12,292
Find a quiet place and finish him off.

293
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:44,292
Rachel...

294
00:35:59,126 --> 00:36:01,251
So the guy who messed up our gig

295
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:03,209
is your former teammate Jon Man.

296
00:36:04,334 --> 00:36:07,334
You almost killed him
and now running into him like this...

297
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:09,042
What a coincidence.

299
00:36:12,126 --> 00:36:13,292
Visiting family.

301
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:18,084
Tonight.

302
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:43,709
Stop, Man Tin!

303
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:50,917
Stand still!

304
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:00,251
You run fast for a limp.

305
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:09,459
Damn gimp, you're quite a handful.

306
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:13,001
My son always repaid my debts.

307
00:37:13,084 --> 00:37:15,167
Your son is in trouble himself.
How can he help you?

308
00:37:15,251 --> 00:37:16,167
Hey!

309
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:18,959
None of your business.

310
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:23,709
I'll be after you. Let's go.

311
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:30,042
Thank you.

312
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,334
I'm Jon Man.

313
00:37:57,334 --> 00:37:57,915
Chef Man, my buddy!

314
00:37:57,916 --> 00:37:58,334
Tin!

315
00:37:58,417 --> 00:38:01,001
Lend me your wok. My son is back.

316
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:02,501
Yeung is here?

317
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:04,000
God dammit!

318
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:05,959
My younger son, Jon.

319
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:07,417
You have a younger son?

320
00:38:08,042 --> 00:38:09,334
Help yourself. Don't be shy.

321
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:27,834
You're cooking, Grandpa?

322
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:29,459
Champ.

323
00:38:30,334 --> 00:38:32,501
Bring the dish to your uncle.

324
00:38:33,376 --> 00:38:34,709
I have an uncle?

325
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:36,001
Just bring it over.

326
00:38:36,126 --> 00:38:37,334
He's at the last table.

327
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:38,667
OKAY

328
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:41,459
Hello, Uncle.

329
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:44,209
Can you understand Mandarin?

330
00:38:44,834 --> 00:38:45,751
What's your name?

331
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:46,834
Champ.

332
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:49,084
It sounds like a boy's name.

333
00:38:50,126 --> 00:38:51,167
Grandpa named me.

334
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:53,917
He said it's suitable for a boy or girl.

335
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:57,667
In gambling as in life,
one must always win.

336
00:38:59,001 --> 00:39:01,334
Champ! Come back to eat!

337
00:39:01,501 --> 00:39:03,417
Coming!

338
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:09,834
Damn!

339
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:11,459
That was like a dream.

340
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:15,001
It's been 29 years.
I didn't think I'd see you again.

341
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:18,334
I'm sure your mother
doesn't feed you well.

342
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:21,251
She didn't even know how much water
to use to cook rice.

343
00:39:23,459 --> 00:39:26,001
She cooks... well now.

344
00:39:29,292 --> 00:39:32,334
Poor thing,
she has to cook for herself.

345
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:37,126
So, how is she doing?

346
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:41,292
She has sciatica.

347
00:39:41,751 --> 00:39:42,959
She can't walk well, needs a wheelchair.

348
00:39:43,126 --> 00:39:45,459
That's fate.

349
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:48,459
I'm lame, she's in a wheelchair.

350
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:52,209
God damn, even as a lame
she's better off than me.

351
00:39:54,001 --> 00:39:55,334
She wants to see you and brother.

352
00:39:56,251 --> 00:39:59,042
So we must go? Is she the queen?

353
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:01,751
Don't talk about her,
it makes me angry.

354
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:03,126
Come...

355
00:40:04,042 --> 00:40:05,667
Have a drink with your old man.

356
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:16,834
Thanks.

357
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:19,792
That's a lot of money.

358
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:22,126
Grandpa put me in charge of money.

359
00:40:22,209 --> 00:40:25,251
He said we'd starve if he held the cash.

360
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:32,667
Uncle, there's Grandpa's bed.

361
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:46,792
Champ.

362
00:40:47,292 --> 00:40:48,167
What are you doing?

363
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:50,792
They're all perfect scores.
Why are you burning them?

364
00:40:51,209 --> 00:40:52,792
They're useless.

365
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,251
What do you mean?

366
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:58,334
Three years ago, dad promised me

367
00:40:58,751 --> 00:41:01,251
if I got a 100%,

368
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,167
he'd give up being a bad guy

369
00:41:03,251 --> 00:41:04,917
and come back to live with us.

370
00:41:05,001 --> 00:41:06,251
I want him to come back

371
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:09,209
so I worked really hard.

372
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:11,917
I did everything he asked.

373
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:15,126
I just asked him to do one thing,
but he didn't.

374
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:21,792
Champ, your dad is a bad guy?

375
00:41:25,792 --> 00:41:27,042
Read this, Uncle.

376
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:31,834
Head Culprit of Armed Robbery Escapes.

377
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:41,334
What is your name? Where do you live?

378
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:43,667
Only you live in Kowloon City?

379
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,376
Why didn't you bring your I.D. card?

380
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:49,001
You know what to do.

381
00:41:51,084 --> 00:41:52,959
Grandpa is always like that.

382
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:10,167
Dr. Kan, Are you all right?

383
00:42:11,126 --> 00:42:13,084
I'm fine, it's just a scratch.

384
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:15,876
The research report for the mutated
smallpox came out today.

385
00:42:15,877 --> 00:42:18,751
It's confidential,
so I must give it to you in person.

386
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:23,292
This mutated strain is
many times more viral

387
00:42:23,376 --> 00:42:27,251
so we tried to adapt a new vaccine
from the old formula.

388
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:29,126
Progress is optimistic.

389
00:42:30,126 --> 00:42:31,917
And this virus...

390
00:42:32,084 --> 00:42:33,792
is definitely related to Kenner

391
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:36,042
but I don't understand.

392
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:37,667
What?

393
00:42:37,751 --> 00:42:40,209
If Kenner wanted to make a bio-weapon,

394
00:42:40,334 --> 00:42:43,417
why would he make this simple virus?

395
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:47,001
I'm worried that he's making something

396
00:42:47,334 --> 00:42:49,709
much more than a mutated smallpox.

397
00:42:54,209 --> 00:42:56,417
LBK is a first-class pharmaceutical plant.

398
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:59,833
I negotiated a million-dollar
contract for you

399
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:02,167
but you just turned Mr. Levinson down flat.

400
00:43:02,376 --> 00:43:03,792
I'm so embarrassed.

401
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:06,167
I love my current job.

402
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,417
You can help people
in a pharmaceutical plant.

403
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:10,334
Everyone in the world will benefit.

404
00:43:10,792 --> 00:43:12,167
I don't understand how you think.

405
00:43:12,168 --> 00:43:15,292
Mom, you told me all their tricks.

406
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:18,042
Not every pharmaceutical company is bad.

407
00:43:20,751 --> 00:43:23,834
How much conscience can
a multi-billion dollar business have?

408
00:43:27,459 --> 00:43:28,334
Forget it.

409
00:43:58,417 --> 00:43:59,959
You're full of excuses.

410
00:44:00,167 --> 00:44:02,084
Stop already, Mom.

411
00:44:02,751 --> 00:44:04,417
What is this? Rachel!

412
00:44:05,167 --> 00:44:06,126
Run!

413
00:44:14,876 --> 00:44:16,251
This is what I want.

414
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:20,251
Carnot sample?

415
00:44:20,376 --> 00:44:23,459
Go to ACDC tomorrow and get it for me
from the virus sample storage.

416
00:44:23,834 --> 00:44:27,292
I cannot remove any virus
samples from the lab.

417
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:28,834
Mom...

418
00:44:28,835 --> 00:44:31,167
Get it,
and nothing happens to your mother.

419
00:44:48,917 --> 00:44:51,167
This is Rachel Kan. Please leave a message.

420
00:44:51,251 --> 00:44:53,001
I will get back to you as soon as possible.

421
00:45:08,001 --> 00:45:10,751
Dr Kan, these are...

422
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:13,834
Reporters, here to interview me.

423
00:45:42,209 --> 00:45:44,959
Hand over your guns, on the floor!

424
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:50,376
All set here.

425
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:52,126
Good.

426
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:53,167
Get out.

427
00:46:15,459 --> 00:46:18,208
Sir, you cannot park here.

428
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:19,792
I'm waiting for someone.
I'll be leaving soon.

429
00:46:20,292 --> 00:46:21,709
Go as soon as you can.

430
00:48:08,376 --> 00:48:10,001
Dr.Kan, I need to examine
what's in your hands...

431
00:48:12,376 --> 00:48:13,084
Stop!

432
00:48:31,167 --> 00:48:32,834
Calling control room,
calling control room...

433
00:48:35,334 --> 00:48:36,167
Freeze!

434
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:32,999
If they get caught, we're in trouble.

435
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,126
Get rid of them.

437
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:21,751
Hello?0

438
00:50:21,834 --> 00:50:23,792
Dad, bring Champ to the
train station now.

439
00:50:23,876 --> 00:50:24,417
What's going on, Yeung?

440
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:25,959
Don't ask, just go now!

441
00:50:26,751 --> 00:50:28,792
Turn around. Go to the train station!

442
00:50:33,292 --> 00:50:36,209
Miss, can you hear me? Are you okay?.

443
00:50:36,417 --> 00:50:38,834
There are two injured civilians
outside the ACDC...

444
00:51:42,001 --> 00:51:43,001
Don't kill a cop!

445
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:45,001
I'm your younger brother!

446
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:53,167
Those cops are in on it!

447
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:26,334
Jon! Get in!

448
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,126
Sit tight!

449
00:53:46,417 --> 00:53:49,167
Police! Move! Move! Move!

450
00:54:04,959 --> 00:54:06,332
Yeung, we're at the train station.

451
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:07,167
Wait at the ticket office.

452
00:54:08,209 --> 00:54:09,376
Move! Police!

453
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:13,209
Find a vantage point.

454
00:54:21,834 --> 00:54:22,251
Speak.

455
00:54:22,334 --> 00:54:24,167
Man Tin is at the station
and made a phone call.

456
00:54:24,459 --> 00:54:27,250
Keep your eye on him.
Anything happens, take the girl.

457
00:54:27,251 --> 00:54:29,333
Don't come over.
Police are tailing you.

458
00:54:29,334 --> 00:54:30,167
What's going on?

459
00:54:30,251 --> 00:54:32,001
The police want to kill me.
I can't come out.

460
00:54:32,292 --> 00:54:34,376
I'll leave you tickets. Wait for my call.

461
00:55:33,251 --> 00:55:34,334
You see the electronic appliances booth?

462
00:55:34,417 --> 00:55:35,165
Yes.

463
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:36,042
Walk over there.

464
00:55:43,376 --> 00:55:44,376
Stop.

465
00:55:54,334 --> 00:55:55,334
Do you see his father?

466
00:55:57,251 --> 00:55:58,209
Do you see his father?

467
00:55:58,376 --> 00:55:59,417
Near the convenience store!

468
00:56:01,376 --> 00:56:03,167
Dad, board the train;
I'll come for you.

469
00:56:09,334 --> 00:56:10,376
Hurry! Hurry!

470
00:56:29,292 --> 00:56:30,167
Grandpa!

471
00:56:30,292 --> 00:56:31,417
Champ, go!

472
00:56:31,917 --> 00:56:32,834
Go!

473
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:37,667
Hurry.

474
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:48,709
Catch the train!

475
00:57:06,292 --> 00:57:10,917
The train to Gemas is about to depart.

476
00:57:11,001 --> 00:57:14,334
All passengers please abroad now.

477
00:57:24,709 --> 00:57:25,834
Go on!

478
00:57:37,126 --> 00:57:39,167
Call HQ, contact
the Railway Department!

479
00:57:49,834 --> 00:57:51,417
How's Yeung?

480
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:53,334
He couldn't get on?

481
00:57:56,751 --> 00:57:58,792
Look, Champ, it's Dad.

482
00:58:00,751 --> 00:58:01,501
Dad...

483
00:58:03,751 --> 00:58:04,792
Champ.

484
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:15,167
Yeung.
Dad.

485
00:58:15,834 --> 00:58:16,959
Sit.

486
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:25,959
Yeung, he's your younger brother.

487
00:58:37,834 --> 00:58:38,917
Turn yourself in.

488
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:42,376
Those cops are in on this.

489
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:44,042
Turning himself in would be suicide.

490
00:58:45,167 --> 00:58:46,417
You were once a cop too.

491
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:57,834
Have you thought about Champ?

492
00:58:58,834 --> 00:59:00,292
She can't lose you.

493
00:59:02,084 --> 00:59:04,917
Do you want her to spend her life
in hiding with you?

494
00:59:12,709 --> 00:59:13,876
Turn yourself in with me.

495
00:59:16,709 --> 00:59:18,208
Stop it! Get out! Get out!

496
00:59:18,209 --> 00:59:19,042
We're not going to see your mother!

497
00:59:19,126 --> 00:59:20,334
You're so selfish.

498
00:59:20,834 --> 00:59:22,790
Had you thought about your family,
you wouldn't be here now.

499
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:23,792
And you call yourself a father.

500
00:59:24,126 --> 00:59:25,334
That's not up to you to say!

501
00:59:31,792 --> 00:59:32,209
Yeung!

502
00:59:32,292 --> 00:59:33,834
Yeung, stop it!

503
00:59:34,042 --> 00:59:36,042
Yeung! Stop!

504
00:59:36,501 --> 00:59:38,417
Quit it, you two...

505
00:59:39,167 --> 00:59:40,459
Stop.

506
00:59:40,709 --> 00:59:43,417
Stop it...

507
00:59:49,042 --> 00:59:50,292
Stop it!

508
00:59:52,459 --> 00:59:56,126
It's my fault. I was never good enough.

509
00:59:56,334 --> 00:59:59,376
That's why your mom left Yeung and I.

510
01:00:00,167 --> 01:00:01,959
Did she ever consider...

511
01:00:02,459 --> 01:00:06,167
A broken mirror can never be whole again?

512
01:00:07,084 --> 01:00:10,376
Your brother and I chose the same path.

513
01:00:11,959 --> 01:00:13,251
He is a thief

514
01:00:13,751 --> 01:00:16,167
but he's a righteous thief

515
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:19,167
who takes good care of Champ and me.

516
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:23,251
I'm the one responsible for this.

517
01:00:23,751 --> 01:00:26,751
I took away decades of love between
you brothers.

518
01:00:27,084 --> 01:00:28,209
Jon...

519
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:31,751
You must forgive him.

520
01:00:34,209 --> 01:00:37,251
I can't. I'm a cop.

521
01:00:43,167 --> 01:00:44,334
Jon...

522
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:47,084
What's wrong, Jon?

523
01:00:52,792 --> 01:00:54,834
Evacuate the workers in the depot now.

524
01:00:54,959 --> 01:00:56,792
We'll arrest them when the train stops.

525
01:01:09,709 --> 01:01:11,167
Delay those cops!

526
01:01:21,001 --> 01:01:22,834
Dad, something's wrong.
We need to go.

527
01:01:30,792 --> 01:01:31,917
Take care.

528
01:02:02,876 --> 01:02:04,126
Police. Don't move!

529
01:02:04,834 --> 01:02:05,792
Take Champ and hide.

530
01:02:11,959 --> 01:02:13,751
Outlaws on the train...

531
01:02:13,959 --> 01:02:15,334
You are surrounded by police.

532
01:02:15,709 --> 01:02:18,167
Turn in your weapons and surrender now.

533
01:02:36,834 --> 01:02:37,834
Stop!

534
01:02:38,917 --> 01:02:40,042
Don't hurt my family!

535
01:02:51,917 --> 01:02:54,126
Yeung! Take Champ and run!

536
01:02:54,334 --> 01:02:56,334
Leave me behind. I can't get away.

537
01:02:57,126 --> 01:02:58,126
Hurry!

538
01:02:58,959 --> 01:03:00,084
Come out, Champ.

539
01:03:00,751 --> 01:03:01,376
Go!

540
01:03:01,501 --> 01:03:02,501
Cover your ears.

541
01:03:05,001 --> 01:03:06,334
Move! Move!

542
01:03:08,334 --> 01:03:09,459
Go!

543
01:03:14,001 --> 01:03:14,917
Champ, come down.

544
01:03:17,167 --> 01:03:17,792
Champ!

545
01:03:17,959 --> 01:03:19,167
Help...

546
01:03:19,917 --> 01:03:20,709
Champ!

547
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:40,334
Hands up!

548
01:04:57,834 --> 01:04:59,792
Man Yeung has many hideouts.
I'll go look for him.

549
01:05:00,251 --> 01:05:01,251
Hide the girl.

550
01:05:01,334 --> 01:05:01,959
Yes, sir.

551
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:02,876
Get in.

552
01:06:21,209 --> 01:06:24,459
In any case, you shouldn't have run away
with your brother.

553
01:06:25,834 --> 01:06:29,792
You are now a suspect in the ACDC case.

554
01:06:31,209 --> 01:06:32,959
I believe you'd never do this,

555
01:06:33,126 --> 01:06:35,166
but only I believe you.

556
01:06:35,167 --> 01:06:38,709
As long as your brother is at large,
you're implicated.

557
01:06:41,334 --> 01:06:44,792
Just don't let anything
happen to my brother.

558
01:06:45,792 --> 01:06:47,209
But he is a repeat felon.

559
01:06:47,334 --> 01:06:48,792
How can I help him?

560
01:06:57,001 --> 01:06:59,292
Damn, he's Yeung's brother.

561
01:06:59,417 --> 01:07:01,709
His oral statement
indicates our involvement.

562
01:07:03,001 --> 01:07:05,792
Don't worry,
we're halfway through this.

563
01:07:06,042 --> 01:07:09,209
When the hospital quiets down,
kill him.

564
01:07:10,084 --> 01:07:11,834
Sean, I want to talk to you

565
01:07:11,959 --> 01:07:13,959
about your former partner Jon Man.

566
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:39,876
Doctor, why so late?

567
01:09:06,209 --> 01:09:07,251
You want to kill me?

568
01:09:07,501 --> 01:09:10,084
Give me my daughter back.
I'll give you your stuff.

569
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:28,959
Quick. Where are you keeping her?

570
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:32,834
Speak!

571
01:09:34,834 --> 01:09:36,001
She's in the old building on Pudu Street.

572
01:09:43,709 --> 01:09:44,792
Where is my daughter?

573
01:09:45,667 --> 01:09:46,334
Where is my daughter?

574
01:09:46,417 --> 01:09:47,792
I'll kill your daughter...

575
01:09:49,334 --> 01:09:50,167
Where is my daughter?

576
01:09:50,168 --> 01:09:51,834
I'll take you there...

578
01:10:32,792 --> 01:10:34,376
Help!

579
01:10:35,167 --> 01:10:36,767
Help...

580
01:10:44,667 --> 01:10:47,167
Where is my daughter?

581
01:11:09,667 --> 01:11:11,834
Last night, someone tried to kill me
at the hospital.

582
01:11:12,292 --> 01:11:13,459
They were Russell's men.

586
01:11:21,834 --> 01:11:23,917
Not yet. I know where Champ is.

608
01:16:36,709 --> 01:16:37,917
Let us go now.

611
01:16:48,334 --> 01:16:49,334
What do you want?

612
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:56,834
Please don't hurt my mother...

613
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:58,917
I've given you everything you want...

615
01:17:08,126 --> 01:17:09,376
Hand over your guns!

618
01:17:21,334 --> 01:17:22,834
Take your jacket off.

624
01:17:48,167 --> 01:17:49,209
ever.

625
01:17:53,334 --> 01:17:56,001
We will rescue Champ. Don't let him go.

626
01:18:27,709 --> 01:18:28,876
Get down!

629
01:22:10,001 --> 01:22:11,126
Why did you do that?

630
01:22:11,292 --> 01:22:13,209
Ice was collateral damage.

631
01:22:13,876 --> 01:22:15,209
It's over.

632
01:22:15,459 --> 01:22:19,459
Only I have the antidote
in the whole world.

633
01:22:20,792 --> 01:22:22,126
Let me go

634
01:22:23,417 --> 01:22:25,042
or she will be the next collateral damage.

635
01:22:29,292 --> 01:22:32,709
Bring Dr. Kan for the girl. I'll call you.

637
01:23:03,084 --> 01:23:04,167
Get in.

638
01:23:15,167 --> 01:23:17,334
Do they still have Champ?

639
01:23:19,126 --> 01:23:20,667
You'll die if you don't go to the hospital.

640
01:23:20,751 --> 01:23:22,167
I won't go!

641
01:23:24,876 --> 01:23:26,001
Brother...

642
01:23:27,167 --> 01:23:28,417
Help me...

643
01:23:30,001 --> 01:23:31,292
Just this once.

644
01:25:06,334 --> 01:25:08,001
20-some years since
we've seen each other,

645
01:25:08,751 --> 01:25:12,042
I wouldn't have guessed
you'd see me like this.

646
01:25:20,126 --> 01:25:21,417
When we were kids...

647
01:25:22,376 --> 01:25:23,751
What were we like?

648
01:25:25,001 --> 01:25:28,167
You were two;
You were like a lump of tofu.

649
01:25:31,167 --> 01:25:33,209
Your nickname was Tofu.

650
01:25:34,334 --> 01:25:35,876
Mom told me.

651
01:25:36,834 --> 01:25:38,417
I've always loved eating her tofu soup.

652
01:25:42,167 --> 01:25:44,834
Brother, forgive mom.

653
01:25:46,417 --> 01:25:47,792
She feels so much guilt.

654
01:25:49,084 --> 01:25:50,792
We've been apart for so long.

655
01:25:52,126 --> 01:25:56,209
I have no feelings for her.
She's a stranger.

656
01:25:59,334 --> 01:26:02,876
I felt nothing for dad when I first came.

657
01:26:04,001 --> 01:26:05,709
I'd been fatherless for over 20 years...

658
01:26:09,834 --> 01:26:12,292
But when he fell in front of me,

659
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:14,376
I felt him return.

660
01:26:24,334 --> 01:26:28,167
What dad and I have 
is different from you.

661
01:26:29,709 --> 01:26:32,917
Dad brought me here when I was 12.

662
01:26:33,167 --> 01:26:34,792
He still loved to gamble.

663
01:26:35,709 --> 01:26:37,126
I hated him.

664
01:26:38,751 --> 01:26:40,165
I was determined to
make something of myself

665
01:26:40,166 --> 01:26:41,459
so no one would despise me.

666
01:26:41,792 --> 01:26:44,001
I chose this path when I was 16.

667
01:26:44,751 --> 01:26:47,792
A few years later, I
stole my boss' stock.

668
01:26:59,292 --> 01:27:01,334
No!

669
01:27:01,417 --> 01:27:04,375
$200,000... Thank you!

670
01:27:04,376 --> 01:27:06,959
Thank you Boss,
for sparing his life!

671
01:27:07,417 --> 01:27:09,876
You're lucky you got the money,
you degenerate gambler.

672
01:27:10,001 --> 01:27:12,334
He would have died here tonight.

673
01:27:12,417 --> 01:27:15,792
I guarantee my son
will never touch your stuff.

674
01:27:15,959 --> 01:27:17,042
Thank you.

675
01:27:17,126 --> 01:27:19,292
Not that way... this way.

676
01:27:20,292 --> 01:27:22,751
Gui said you would take it easy on us.

677
01:27:22,917 --> 01:27:24,001
He's right.

678
01:27:24,167 --> 01:27:26,042
Why else would I have taken your money?

679
01:27:26,167 --> 01:27:27,876
I have a reputation to uphold.

680
01:27:28,001 --> 01:27:29,876
This is only the 6th floor.

681
01:27:30,334 --> 01:27:32,251
If you both jump off,

682
01:27:32,376 --> 01:27:34,209
I'll leave this all behind.

683
01:27:45,834 --> 01:27:48,126
Son, be brave.

684
01:27:49,292 --> 01:27:51,042
We're both tough.

685
01:27:51,167 --> 01:27:52,292
Let's go!

686
01:28:00,792 --> 01:28:03,417
Don't die...

687
01:28:06,126 --> 01:28:08,834
Yeung, don't die.

688
01:28:11,834 --> 01:28:15,167
What I share with dad,
you'll never have.

689
01:28:23,042 --> 01:28:25,374
Dispatch,
there is a suspected fugitive vehicle.

690
01:28:25,375 --> 01:28:26,167
Requesting confirmation.

691
01:28:27,334 --> 01:28:28,834
I know dad was a bad cop.

692
01:28:29,834 --> 01:28:33,292
I became a cop so mom would forget him.

693
01:28:34,417 --> 01:28:36,167
But I never imagined...

694
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:39,167
Mom would miss you guys so much.

695
01:28:43,709 --> 01:28:44,959
Please go see her.

696
01:28:46,917 --> 01:28:48,751
How can I, with the way I am now?

697
01:28:56,459 --> 01:28:57,792
This is from mom.

698
01:29:02,167 --> 01:29:03,334
Don't make it worse for yourself.

700
01:29:18,709 --> 01:29:21,084
You took my daughter; what do you want?

704
01:29:45,667 --> 01:29:49,792
Yeung, I know you won't forgive me.

705
01:29:53,167 --> 01:29:55,334
Sean wants me in exchange for your niece?

706
01:29:55,834 --> 01:29:58,251
They can cultivate the
virus using her body.

707
01:29:58,834 --> 01:30:01,334
But they need you; there must be
unfinished business.

708
01:30:02,126 --> 01:30:03,209
I'm worried about Champ, too.

709
01:30:03,334 --> 01:30:05,834
The virus has been inside her for 24 hours.

710
01:30:06,001 --> 01:30:08,334
If she's not injected with
the antidote in 10 hours,

711
01:30:09,084 --> 01:30:10,001
she will die.

712
01:30:10,334 --> 01:30:13,791
IDC is taking me
to the Singapore Medical Authority

713
01:30:13,792 --> 01:30:15,917
so I can research and
manufacture an antidote,

714
01:30:16,126 --> 01:30:18,834
but we cannot finish the job in 10 hours.

715
01:30:19,001 --> 01:30:23,042
Then, I become an accomplice
in her murder.

716
01:30:25,792 --> 01:30:27,709
Dr Kan, we have to go. Come on.

719
01:30:30,917 --> 01:30:33,834
Sean still needs Rachel;
I can lure him out.

720
01:30:33,959 --> 01:30:35,001
Let me out first.

728
01:30:53,167 --> 01:30:54,167
I'm out of time.

729
01:30:54,376 --> 01:30:55,959
You know I don't have time!

732
01:32:26,376 --> 01:32:27,334
That's a very serious crime.

733
01:32:27,417 --> 01:32:28,334
I don't have a choice.

734
01:32:28,417 --> 01:32:29,751
You must help me.

735
01:32:30,834 --> 01:32:32,334
Only you can help me find Sean.

736
01:32:34,084 --> 01:32:35,001
Please.

737
01:33:21,959 --> 01:33:23,001
Get off!

739
01:33:27,667 --> 01:33:29,792
Jon escaped. He's coming here.

740
01:34:19,751 --> 01:34:21,126
What you just did,
there's no turning back.

745
01:34:47,667 --> 01:34:48,751
Sean wants me to hand
over the hostage there.

746
01:34:50,334 --> 01:34:52,959
Chopper 4 is over Bukit Bintang
heading towards Puchong.

760
01:37:07,001 --> 01:37:09,126
Put it on.
I can track you if anything happens.

761
01:37:16,876 --> 01:37:18,751
Sean, we're at Golden Triangle.

779
01:41:41,417 --> 01:41:43,876
Champ, Champ...

780
01:42:49,834 --> 01:42:50,876
Champ...

781
01:42:52,001 --> 01:42:53,126
Champ...

782
01:42:54,167 --> 01:42:55,167
Yeung!

784
01:43:25,834 --> 01:43:26,709
Don't open it.

785
01:43:27,042 --> 01:43:28,834
Sean has injected the virus into Champ.

786
01:43:36,667 --> 01:43:39,334
I heard them say Dr. Kan
is making the antidote.

787
01:43:41,667 --> 01:43:43,292
Hide Champ, I'll go find Rachel.

788
01:43:43,417 --> 01:43:45,126
Go to the engine room and keep them
from starting the ship.

789
01:43:48,001 --> 01:43:48,834
Be careful.

790
01:43:50,251 --> 01:43:51,167
Stay in touch.

794
01:45:19,126 --> 01:45:19,959
Rachel.

795
01:45:29,209 --> 01:45:30,376
The antidote formulas are all in here.

796
01:45:30,459 --> 01:45:31,417
Don't lose it. Go, quickly.

797
01:45:40,876 --> 01:45:41,667
Go!

798
01:45:47,209 --> 01:45:48,251
Are you ok?

799
01:45:51,667 --> 01:45:53,001
Shoot if anything happens.

800
01:46:34,042 --> 01:46:35,417
Catch it. Go.

801
01:47:14,334 --> 01:47:16,417
Yeung, Rachel fell under the deck.

802
01:47:16,792 --> 01:47:17,792
I'm going down now.

803
01:47:18,292 --> 01:47:19,167
I'll come over.

804
01:48:18,292 --> 01:48:20,001
It's alright...

805
01:48:21,209 --> 01:48:22,459
PDA...

806
01:48:23,334 --> 01:48:25,126
I dropped the PDA...

807
01:48:26,167 --> 01:48:27,709
I dropped the PDA...

808
01:48:27,876 --> 01:48:30,334
Don't worry, it's here.

809
01:48:33,209 --> 01:48:34,376
Hang in there.

814
01:50:33,001 --> 01:50:34,167
Hang in there, brother.

815
01:50:35,167 --> 01:50:36,417
We still have a chance.

816
01:50:48,709 --> 01:50:50,917
Yeung, Sean shoots too fast.

817
01:50:51,126 --> 01:50:53,959
The only way is, we both go out together.

818
01:50:54,167 --> 01:50:56,084
When he shoots one of us,

819
01:50:56,667 --> 01:50:59,001
the other will have a chance to shoot him.

820
01:51:01,751 --> 01:51:05,042
Remember, I told you, we're very tough.

821
01:51:15,167 --> 01:51:17,959
I've had the same dream almost every night.

822
01:51:18,167 --> 01:51:20,917
Our whole family was at sea...

823
01:51:21,001 --> 01:51:23,417
One by one you'd disappear.

824
01:51:23,876 --> 01:51:27,334
In the end, only I was left.

825
01:52:39,001 --> 01:52:39,959
Brother.

826
01:52:59,001 --> 01:53:02,042
That feeling is back.

827
01:53:02,917 --> 01:53:06,667
I finally know who reached out
and saved me in my dream.

828
01:53:09,042 --> 01:53:10,751
We've been apart for over two decades...

829
01:53:11,792 --> 01:53:13,834
But he never left me.

830
01:54:19,917 --> 01:54:20,917
Yeung

831
01:54:22,167 --> 01:54:24,251
I know you will not forgive me.

832
01:54:25,251 --> 01:54:28,251
I cannot forgive myself.

833
01:54:29,959 --> 01:54:33,209
I called your father selfish

834
01:54:33,959 --> 01:54:38,792
but in the end, so was I.

835
01:54:39,709 --> 01:54:45,292
if I had the chance to choose again,

836
01:54:48,001 --> 01:54:51,917
I would never leave you.

837
01:54:55,834 --> 01:54:58,084
It is right that you don't forgive me

838
01:54:58,667 --> 01:55:01,959
but I beg you to accept
your younger brother.

839
01:55:02,917 --> 01:55:05,876
Do you remember? When you were kids...

840
01:55:06,209 --> 01:55:08,001
You loved him very much.

841
01:55:08,334 --> 01:55:12,167
I didn't have the courage to tell him

842
01:55:13,042 --> 01:55:15,709
that it was me who
separated the two of you.

843
01:55:16,001 --> 01:55:19,417
I caused your father to lose a son.

844
01:55:24,792 --> 01:55:26,459
It's all my fault.

845
01:55:28,459 --> 01:55:29,917
I'm sorry.

846
01:55:33,209 --> 01:55:34,334
I am old.

847
01:55:36,209 --> 01:55:37,376
I may never

848
01:55:39,126 --> 01:55:41,334
have the chance to see you again.

849
01:55:43,251 --> 01:55:45,001
I just want you to know...

850
01:55:45,834 --> 01:55:48,084
Since you are now a father,

851
01:55:48,876 --> 01:55:53,417
I hope you will make plans for your child.

852
01:55:53,834 --> 01:55:56,167
You must take the path you
were meant to take.

853
01:55:56,334 --> 01:55:58,167
Don't be like me...

854
01:55:59,167 --> 01:56:01,334
Or you will regret it all your life.

855
01:56:05,709 --> 01:56:07,001
Take care of yourself.

856
01:56:22,917 --> 01:56:24,459
Mom...

857
01:56:59,834 --> 01:57:02,709
Champ, come.

858
01:57:07,292 --> 01:57:10,292
Dad has made mistakes which
I've never faced.

859
01:57:12,251 --> 01:57:15,167
I'm going to own up to them.
I'll be back soon.

860
01:57:19,209 --> 01:57:21,834
Stay with grandma from now on,
understand?

861
01:57:25,001 --> 01:57:26,167
Meet your grandma.

862
01:57:28,001 --> 01:57:29,001
Grandma.

863
01:57:29,251 --> 01:57:30,334
Good girl.

864
01:57:35,209 --> 01:57:36,667
Where's Jon?

865
01:57:47,251 --> 01:57:49,792
When you leave this world,

866
01:57:50,792 --> 01:57:52,292
the people in your heart

867
01:57:54,001 --> 01:57:55,709
will continue the journey with you.

868
01:57:57,709 --> 01:57:59,251
You will always have them,

869
01:58:00,917 --> 01:58:02,876
even though they may not be with you.

870
01:58:06,876 --> 01:58:10,501
If I can only choose
one kind of <i>"forever"</i>,"

871
01:58:14,251 --> 01:58:18,792
And, they are my <i>"forever"</i>.
