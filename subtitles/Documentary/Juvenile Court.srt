1
00:03:06,304 --> 00:03:11,606
This is the story of how the destiny
of a nation was changed by a birthmark.

2
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,560
A royal birthmark on the royal
posterior of a royal infant child.

3
00:03:18,252 --> 00:03:20,889
Here returning to his castle is King Roderick.

4
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:24,915
Roderick the tyrant, who some
months before seized the throne

5
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:27,798
by a massacre of the entire royal family.

6
00:03:28,572 --> 00:03:33,401
But uneasy lies Roderick's crown,
for rumor hath it that an infant,

7
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:36,699
the rightful heir to the thrown
had survived the massacre.

8
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,573
And even now is being cared
for by a group in the forest.

9
00:03:40,717 --> 00:03:44,985
A group led by an elusive dashing
outlaw known only as..

10
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,348
the Black Fox!

11
00:03:58,165 --> 00:04:01,781
The child lives! Death to
the tyrant! The Black Fox.

12
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:04,313
The Black Fox again!
To the castle, quick!

13
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,589
My kingdom seething with revolt,
cutthroats and assassins in every tree!

14
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:23,514
Why must I be surrounded by fools?
Ravenhurst! Ravenhurst!

15
00:04:23,627 --> 00:04:24,571
Sire!

16
00:04:24,596 --> 00:04:27,475
Could you have been so
incompetent, bungled so horribly,

17
00:04:27,504 --> 00:04:29,569
as to have permitted
that child to live?

18
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:30,444
Sire, there is no child.

19
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:33,377
My men assure me that none
of the royal family escaped alive.

20
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,204
Believe me, sire,
this is nonsense.

21
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,834
Nonsense? You call it nonsense, Ravenhurst!

22
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:40,315
Is it nonsense that I cannot
ride my own domain,

23
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,435
without being
murderously attacked.

24
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:45,540
My child, I came
within an inch of my life.

25
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:46,564
Oh, father.

26
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,714
Each day, some new insurrection.
Who is this Black Fox?

27
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:53,884
Oh just some ridiculous adventurer
with a handful of rabble.

28
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,572
Rabble today but
an army tomorrow!

29
00:04:55,605 --> 00:04:57,480
We need help to wipe
them out. Men and arms!

30
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:59,923
Aye, an alliance with our good
friend Griswold of the North!

31
00:04:59,963 --> 00:05:03,444
Aye, alliance, and quickly! He arrives
tomorrow for the great tournament.

32
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:04,495
Alliance with Griswold...

33
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,166
Sire, this rabble
can be crushed.

34
00:05:06,213 --> 00:05:08,158
Griswold has men and arms.

35
00:05:08,194 --> 00:05:10,379
We need no uncouth
interloper from the north.

36
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:13,250
Uncouth, yes, but
Griswold is strong.

37
00:05:13,283 --> 00:05:14,654
Perhaps too strong.

38
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:17,154
Perhaps our friend
Ravenhurst fears an alliance

39
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:19,762
would put Griswold and not
himself at the king's right hand!

40
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:20,930
You shall die for this!

41
00:05:20,973 --> 00:05:22,221
One of us will!

42
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:25,252
Stop! Stop! Stop, I say!

43
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:27,560
Put up your
sword, you fool.

44
00:05:29,353 --> 00:05:31,889
Sire! -Silence!  -But sire! -Silence!
-Your pardon, sire.

45
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:35,894
And you, too. Must we
quarrel amongst ourselves?

46
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,314
Do you think I
could make alliance?

47
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:42,310
Griswold is rich.
What could I offer him?

48
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,545
That which he desires most
in the world. Marriage, sire.

49
00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:47,519
With your daughter,
the fair Gwendolyn.

50
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:50,307
Marriage with
Griswold? Never!

51
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:51,607
What's that you say?

52
00:05:51,648 --> 00:05:53,529
He's a brute and a lout!

53
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:56,682
Brute or not, lout or not, if I
so decide, you'll marry Griswold.

54
00:05:56,865 --> 00:05:57,827
I will not.

55
00:05:57,973 --> 00:06:01,293
I am the king. If it pleases me,
you will marry Griswold.

56
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:04,468
If it pleases you so much,
you marry Griswold.

57
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:06,137
When I marry,
I marry for love.

58
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:08,213
Someone dashing
and romantic,

59
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:10,322
who will carry me off as a
princess should be carried off!

60
00:06:10,362 --> 00:06:13,916
Who fills your head with
this childish fiddle faddle.

61
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:16,805
Ah, I know... Griselda.

62
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,728
She of the evil eye. Take
the witch out and burn her!

63
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:25,274
Harm one hair of her head and I
throw myself from the highest turret.

64
00:06:25,276 --> 00:06:26,555
Gwendolyn, you go too far!

65
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:35,899
Dire news, sire! I've just come
from the forest. The child lives!

66
00:06:36,303 --> 00:06:37,709
The child lives?!

67
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:39,298
Aye, sire.

68
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,949
How know you that this is the royal
child and not some outrageous impostor?

69
00:06:43,476 --> 00:06:46,889
Because sire, disguised as a
member of their group, I saw him.

70
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:48,380
And I can assure you that
like his royal ancestors,

71
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:51,324
and on the same spot
as his royal ancestors,

72
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:53,641
he bears the royal birthmark.

73
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:57,399
The... purple pimpernel?

74
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,180
The purple pimpernel.

75
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:05,644
Oh... Then why stand you here,
you incompetent Jackalings?

76
00:07:05,644 --> 00:07:07,180
To  horse! To the forest!

77
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,588
Cut them down!

78
00:07:08,615 --> 00:07:12,221
Kill the infamous child who
claims to be the rightful king.

79
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:18,255
And destroy forever this traitorous
fiend who calls himself the Black Fox!

80
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:04,995
Hawkins! Hawkins! Come here!

81
00:10:08,903 --> 00:10:10,642
Hawkins, you hurted yourself ?

82
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,325
Are you all right, Hawkins?

83
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,379
Come here!

84
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:16,160
Sir.

85
00:10:16,455 --> 00:10:19,440
Hawkins, how many times have
I told you to stay out of my clothes?

86
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,581
And who are
these little people?

87
00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:22,159
Oh, these are
my friends, sir.

88
00:10:22,193 --> 00:10:23,726
They used to work
with me at the carnival.

89
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,701
They're the finest troupe of
acrobats and tumblers in all of England.

90
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,264
But why did you
bring them here?

91
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:30,437
Well they too would be
part of our group, sir.

92
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:33,860
They feel strongly as we
do about the tyranny,

93
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:35,308
and would join in
our worthy cause.

94
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,688
Sir.

95
00:10:41,722 --> 00:10:42,793
Well, captain?

96
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,269
The new recruits
are arriving, sir.

97
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:45,815
Good. Hawkins,

98
00:10:46,135 --> 00:10:48,590
I don't mean to be disparaging
to your little friends,

99
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,269
but weapons
are limited and...

100
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:51,469
Oh oh, I didn't intend
for them to fight, sir, I..

101
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,700
I merely thought that they would take
over my chores of entertaining the men.

102
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,789
Then perhaps I'd be free
to bear arms myself,sir,

103
00:10:58,183 --> 00:10:59,778
and come to grips
with the enemy.

104
00:10:59,956 --> 00:11:04,695
Face to face and steel to
steel. Fist to fist, sir.

105
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,799
Hmph.

106
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:09,279
Little friends, I'm sorry,

107
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,840
but food and weapons are
limited so you see, uh...

108
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:14,192
We'll do anything for Hawkins,
sir. He always was our friend.

109
00:11:14,352 --> 00:11:16,138
I'm sorry, there's no
time to discuss it.

110
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:18,133
Please go quickly
and without detection.

111
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:20,561
Well, if you ever
need us, call us!

112
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:21,668
Thank you, I shall.

113
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,206
Bye Hawkins!

114
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,831
Hawkins! The recruits will be
here in a moment. Get the child.

115
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:29,144
Child... er...

116
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:30,823
I hate to keep
mentioning this, sir...

117
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,297
Just get the child!

118
00:11:32,403 --> 00:11:34,426
Well, sir, you know I'd do
anything for his majesty, but,

119
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,942
don't you think it look
better if a woman were...

120
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,760
Tend to your duty!
And get out of my clothes!

121
00:11:38,802 --> 00:11:39,952
Yes sir.

122
00:11:57,827 --> 00:11:58,769
Majesty!

123
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:02,788
Your majesty.

124
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,542
Your majesty.

125
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:09,447
Your majesty.

126
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:10,634
Sir.

127
00:12:10,658 --> 00:12:12,283
Don't you think it
really would, look better

128
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,711
if this kind of thing
were done by a woman?

129
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:18,383
I've told you repeatedly, Hawkins.
Each one serves as best he can.

130
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:21,398
I know, sir, but when I ran away from
the carnival, sir, and joined your group,

131
00:12:21,486 --> 00:12:25,198
I thought I'd be in the thick of it.
Robbing the rich and giving to the poor.

132
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:29,466
Sir!

133
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:31,732
Our presence is known.
The king's men are on their way!

134
00:12:31,874 --> 00:12:33,691
We must disperse!
Maid Jean. - Yes, sir.

135
00:12:33,751 --> 00:12:36,376
You will see that the child is
transported to the abbey in Dover.

136
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:37,261
The usual method?

137
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,243
- The usual method.

138
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,309
Come, Hawkins.
- Yes, captain.

139
00:12:40,232 --> 00:12:42,217
The rest of you disperse!

140
00:12:42,937 --> 00:12:44,450
Hawkins, hurry!

141
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,206
I'm putting the last
touches on, right now.

142
00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:48,793
Don't just stand there,
man! Make haste!

143
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,258
There.

144
00:12:53,846 --> 00:12:55,392
Why do you stare?

145
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,379
I... Beg pardon,
captain, but, I'm...

146
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:02,461
I'm sorry, captain, but
I didn't mean to stare.

147
00:13:02,764 --> 00:13:04,854
Each time I see
you as a woman, sir,

148
00:13:04,886 --> 00:13:07,225
I mean with your
flowing hair...

149
00:13:07,268 --> 00:13:09,647
Conceal the child! Quickly!

150
00:13:09,668 --> 00:13:10,730
Yes, captain.

151
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:34,313
The king's men.

152
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,116
You know what
to do, Hawkins.

153
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:38,753
Yes, captain. I'll try.

154
00:13:40,307 --> 00:13:43,109
Ho there! Hold I say!

155
00:13:46,114 --> 00:13:48,511
Come down old man, we would
talk to you. You too, wench.

156
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:49,378
What's that?

157
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:51,549
Hurry along, this
is king's business!

158
00:13:51,645 --> 00:13:53,982
What's the meaning of this?
- Come on!

159
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,184
W...what's the meaning of this?
What do you want of us?

160
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,860
Where go you, ancient one?
Who are you?

161
00:14:00,886 --> 00:14:03,278
- What's that?
- Who are you?

162
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:04,995
What's... what's that?
- Who ARE YOU?

163
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:06,937
Fine, thank you.
- No! No, no. WHO?

164
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,893
Who! -Who, -who. -Who. -who.

165
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:13,368
I am Foltzingdale
uh the wine merchant,

166
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:16,177
and this is my
little granddaughter.

167
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,758
Uh poor child,
she's a mute,

168
00:14:17,865 --> 00:14:21,432
she neither speaks nor hears
except through my fingers.

169
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,822
Child, the... No,
no, here child,

170
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:29,240
these, these are the king's
men. Men of the king!

171
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,591
Eh.. she says long live
the king and down with his..

172
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,155
long live the kind
and down with his..

173
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:41,283
Long..

174
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,900
little harder, dear.

175
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,823
long live the king
and down with his..

176
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,567
not quite so hard... long live the
king and down with his enemies.

177
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,601
Enough!

178
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:56,578
Have you seen a group
in the forest with a child?

179
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,302
Uh what's that? What? What?
- A child! A child!

180
00:14:58,342 --> 00:15:01,465
A child. Child. Oh! Lovely child,
pretty little creature, isn't it?

181
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,381
But you stay
away from her!

182
00:15:03,414 --> 00:15:06,929
No, no no no, a child! So big!
Uh with a little mark on...

183
00:15:06,964 --> 00:15:10,822
You do and I'll break
every bone in your body!

184
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,548
Ask the... Ask the girl if she's
seen a group in the forest.

185
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,541
Uh what's that? what?

186
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:18,567
Ask the girl if she's seen
a group in the forest.

187
00:15:18,606 --> 00:15:20,172
Eh why didn't I what?

188
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,301
Ask the girl if she's seen
a group in the forest!

189
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:25,402
No need to holler, sir,
I hear very well indeed!

190
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:27,190
Well ask her!
- Ask her what?

191
00:15:27,308 --> 00:15:29,525
If she's seen a
group in the forest?

192
00:15:30,523 --> 00:15:33,866
Uh y-yes... child, have you
seen a group in the forest?

193
00:15:43,664 --> 00:15:45,299
Eh she says no.

194
00:15:45,489 --> 00:15:46,937
What took her so long?

195
00:15:46,995 --> 00:15:48,190
Stutters.

196
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,388
Tah, we waste time with these dolts.
On your way. Off with you!

197
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:14,981
Oh, he's quite all right.

198
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:18,134
You were excellent,
Hawkins.

199
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:22,905
You too, captain. We played our
parts extremely well, I thought.

200
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:27,445
You know, we should spend a lot more
time together. Uh, for rehearsal, I mean.

201
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:32,885
There's a storm brewing. We'll
spend the night in the woodman's hut.

202
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,405
Yes, captain.

203
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:51,788
I'll take you dreaming
through the rainy night

204
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:01,851
to a place behind the raindrops
where the stars are bright.

205
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:10,099
you may not find gold or
silver but a richer prize

206
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:20,345
waits for you behind the
raindrops if you'll close your eyes.

207
00:17:26,442 --> 00:17:32,141
tonight, tonight when
all the world's asleep.

208
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:41,340
we will tip toe home with a wondrous
star, a star you can always keep.

209
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:55,788
and years from now when you
go dreaming when you're very old,

210
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:04,830
though your crown be rich with
rubies, diamonds set in gold.

211
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:16,193
none will shine as bright
as the star we'll find

212
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:23,963
tonight.

213
00:18:50,335 --> 00:18:55,920
tonight, tonight when
all the world's asleep,

214
00:19:00,644 --> 00:19:06,569
we will find a star that
you can always keep.

215
00:19:19,971 --> 00:19:21,913
His majesty's asleep, now.

216
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:25,520
You better get some sleep, too.

217
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:28,102
Over there.

218
00:19:30,321 --> 00:19:33,651
Uh, there's only room for one...
I... I think you'd better take it.

219
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,920
We can both lie there.

220
00:19:36,112 --> 00:19:39,596
If you get wet and ill, you'll be
no use to his majesty at all.

221
00:19:40,526 --> 00:19:41,939
Lie down.

222
00:19:43,818 --> 00:19:45,232
Yes, captain.

223
00:19:58,758 --> 00:20:00,920
Wet.

224
00:20:00,849 --> 00:20:02,184
Very.

225
00:20:04,773 --> 00:20:07,652
There'd be more room if
you raised your arm.

226
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,615
The other one.

227
00:20:12,824 --> 00:20:13,987
Sorry.

228
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:23,765
Hawkins.

229
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,288
Yes, captain.

230
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:30,469
I'm sorry I... I spoke
in the manner I did.

231
00:20:31,255 --> 00:20:32,862
I was wrong.

232
00:20:33,652 --> 00:20:34,979
Y-yes, captain?

233
00:20:35,472 --> 00:20:37,523
There's something
else I'd like to say.

234
00:20:38,702 --> 00:20:39,618
Yes?

235
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:42,758
I am a woman.

236
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,882
And I do have feelings.

237
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,326
I... I find it hard
to believe that..

238
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:56,210
the captain could ever be fond
of a man who isn't a fighter.

239
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:06,549
Sometimes tenderness and
kindness can also make a man.

240
00:21:06,989 --> 00:21:08,566
A very rare man.

241
00:21:11,683 --> 00:21:13,650
Could the captain...

242
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:20,386
Could the captain ever entertain
thoughts of marriage with such a man?

243
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,713
Yes, Hawkins.

244
00:21:27,263 --> 00:21:30,112
I think she could, and would.

245
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,200
If things were different.

246
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:38,451
How di-different?

247
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:43,876
The infant on the throne and...
Our fight for freedom won.

248
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:50,346
Why does such a little girl
have to do such a big job?

249
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,298
It's the way I
was brought up.

250
00:21:54,321 --> 00:21:59,547
My father's influence. You see,
my father made me everything I am.

251
00:22:00,575 --> 00:22:02,257
He does beautiful work.

252
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,282
He taught me how to love
freedom and hate injustice.

253
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:14,798
The use of weapons
and how to fight.

254
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,566
In fact, I think he...

255
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,099
he really wanted
me to be a boy.

256
00:22:29,653 --> 00:22:32,190
Too bad. You'd've made
a wonderful girl.

257
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,698
No! We daren't think of
ourselves until our fight is won.

258
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,555
Yes, but that could take
twenty years or more.

259
00:22:39,594 --> 00:22:43,240
Or twenty hours. If only we could
put our plan into operation.

260
00:22:43,189 --> 00:22:44,470
Plan? Do we
have a p-plan?

261
00:22:44,525 --> 00:22:48,690
A handful of men could overthrow
the castle in a matter of hours.

262
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:48,897
Yes.

263
00:22:48,924 --> 00:22:51,949
You see, there's a secret
passage that starts in the forest,

264
00:22:51,973 --> 00:22:54,472
and tunnels underneath
the walls of the castle.

265
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:55,387
Secret passage.

266
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:58,547
But it's locked at both ends and
the key is in the king's possession.

267
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,844
The king's possession, yeah.

268
00:22:59,907 --> 00:23:02,786
If only we could have
someone inside the castle;

269
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,000
an intimate of the king,
with access to his chambers.

270
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,601
Mm-hmm, with access to his
chambers. But, but that's impossible.

271
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,964
Ah, good evening! A thousand
apologies for this uh intrusion,

272
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,309
but may I beg shelter and warmth
from this miserable storm?

273
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:24,278
Who are you?

274
00:23:24,415 --> 00:23:27,819
A stranger in this land,
young woman, but not for long.

275
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,409
I'm Giacomo of the continent,
the king's new jester.

276
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:33,405
The court jester.

277
00:23:33,493 --> 00:23:34,275
Giacomo?

278
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,646
Giacomo the incomparable!
King of jesters, and jester of kings.

279
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:40,414
Well where are you from?

280
00:23:40,448 --> 00:23:42,339
Most recently the Italian court.

281
00:23:42,805 --> 00:23:44,772
But I have entertained in
all the courts of Europe,

282
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:47,920
and speak a ready wit
in their every tongue.

283
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:52,471
Hawkins, we are indeed honored
that our humble hut will shelter one,

284
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:54,755
will tomorrow be an
intimate of the king.

285
00:23:54,786 --> 00:23:56,741
With access to his chambers.

286
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:58,578
But how will they know you?

287
00:23:58,626 --> 00:24:02,109
Are you sure that no one in the
castle has ever seen your face?

288
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,141
Not yet! But I assure you,

289
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,541
ere another sun has set,

290
00:24:05,576 --> 00:24:08,321
the entire court of England
will succumb to the charm,

291
00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:13,115
wit, and song of the incomparable
Giacomo, king of jesters..

292
00:24:15,423 --> 00:24:17,880
...And jester to the king!

293
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,336
I'll take the child
to the abbey.

294
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:23,169
You must go to the castle at once.
Quickly, into his clothes!

295
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:24,546
W-what are we going
to do about him?

296
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,753
I'll notify the fox,
he'll be taken care of.

297
00:24:26,983 --> 00:24:31,670
Now listen, listen carefully.
Once inside the castle,

298
00:24:31,106 --> 00:24:34,410
you must get to the king's chamber,
and find the key to the secret passage.

299
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:35,400
Key to the passage. Right.

300
00:24:35,438 --> 00:24:38,423
Then you must give it to the one man
inside the castle who's our confederate.

301
00:24:38,471 --> 00:24:39,547
- Confederate.

302
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:42,584
You mean we already have somebody
inside the castle? One of our own people?

303
00:24:42,643 --> 00:24:45,910
You will contact him by
whistling our secret call.

304
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,172
Whistle it, hum it, sing it.

305
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:49,670
But I don't understand,

306
00:24:49,742 --> 00:24:52,692
if we already have somebody inside
the castle, why doesn't he get the key?

307
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,973
You'll understand when you see him.
Now, he'll hear that and identify himself.

308
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:58,567
Why can't you just
tell me his name?

309
00:24:58,621 --> 00:25:00,990
Should they discover you, they
might force you to reveal his identity.

310
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,923
Okay, I'd like to ask
you one question.

311
00:25:02,923 --> 00:25:05,180
After months of pleading
for just this kind of action,

312
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:08,746
what makes you think that anybody ..anybody
could force me reveal the identity of my confederate?

313
00:25:08,782 --> 00:25:12,196
Because they'd put you on the rack,
crack your every bone, scald you with hot oil,

314
00:25:12,222 --> 00:25:15,145
and remove the nails off your
fingers with flaming hot pincers.

315
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:17,461
I'd... Like to withdraw the question.

316
00:25:17,895 --> 00:25:22,152
Hawkins, the future of England
depends on this; you cannot fail.

317
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:23,189
I will not.

318
00:25:23,219 --> 00:25:24,819
Oh heaven help you.

319
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:29,435
Now remember from this moment on,

320
00:25:29,468 --> 00:25:32,539
you're no longer Hubert
Hawkins the carnival entertainer;

321
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:37,864
You're the incomparable Giacomo,
king of jesters and jester to the king.

322
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,113
Jester to the king.
Jester to the king.

323
00:25:42,569 --> 00:25:43,657
To the king!?

324
00:25:43,797 --> 00:25:48,586
The child escapes. You hear that,
Ravenhurst? The child escapes.

325
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:51,135
Gwendolyn, dear, do
stop picking that thing.

326
00:25:51,469 --> 00:25:52,912
The revolt spreads.

327
00:25:53,142 --> 00:25:55,682
Brockhurst here says
alliance with Griswold,

328
00:25:55,758 --> 00:25:58,372
Finsdale says alliance,
Pertwee says alliance,

329
00:25:58,655 --> 00:26:01,619
and yet you, Ravenhurst,
you of all my ministers...

330
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:05,317
Sire. If my lords Brockhurst, Finsdale,
and Pertwee plead so strongly for alliance,

331
00:26:05,366 --> 00:26:07,740
then by all means let us have such alliance.

332
00:26:07,785 --> 00:26:10,900
A marriage between Sir Griswold
and the princess Gwendolyn.

333
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:11,469
You are quite right.

334
00:26:11,502 --> 00:26:13,791
Never! Never marriage with Griswold!

335
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,165
Be sensible. - Sensible!

336
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:21,099
I've seen this monster, and it's not for nothing
he's called the grim and gruesome grisly Griswold.

337
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,637
Grim, grisly or gruesome,
you'll marry Griswold!

338
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,962
I'll die first.

339
00:26:25,113 --> 00:26:26,938
Go to your chambers!

340
00:26:27,192 --> 00:26:28,929
Good, it is done.

341
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,269
Arrange for the wedding
directly after the tournament.

342
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:32,432
We'll make a show of this.

343
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:35,210
You there! Go hence.
Scour the countryside.

344
00:26:35,252 --> 00:26:37,118
Bring in the fairest
wenches in the land.

345
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,570
Mind you see that
they are the fairest.

346
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:41,259
Wenches, laughter, song,
that's what this court needs!

347
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:43,536
Indeed, sire! And the good
Giacomo will provide it.

348
00:26:43,674 --> 00:26:45,200
Giacomo? Who is Giacomo?

349
00:26:45,349 --> 00:26:46,776
He's the new
jester I've sent for.

350
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:49,273
By reputation the gayest and
wittiest entertainer in Europe.

351
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,857
Splendid! Ha ha! What
a festival this will be.

352
00:26:51,894 --> 00:26:54,794
Jousting by our boldest knights.
Wenches at our beck and call.

353
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:58,509
My daughter married to Griswold,
who will take her to a castle up north.

354
00:26:58,103 --> 00:27:02,894
Way up north! But gentle
lords, you make me very happy.

355
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,231
They have won.

356
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,792
For the moment, yes. The king is
guided by the last voice he hears,

357
00:27:11,826 --> 00:27:15,539
and that voice shall be mine.
Giacomo will see to that.

358
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,950
Giacomo? A mere jester?

359
00:27:17,144 --> 00:27:20,804
With one special talent for which
my agent has bargained dearly.

360
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:23,589
In addition to his brilliance
as an entertainer,

361
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,877
the jester Giacomo also happens
to be the world's most skillful,

362
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,933
devious, and subtle master
of the art of assassination.

363
00:27:36,518 --> 00:27:41,220
So as Hawkins becomes the incomparable
Giacomo and heads for the castle,

364
00:27:41,655 --> 00:27:45,599
while the maid Jean with the infant
king still hidden in the wine cask,

365
00:27:45,277 --> 00:27:49,578
journeys towards the abbey
and safety for the child.

366
00:27:50,575 --> 00:27:52,241
Their plan seems simple enough,

367
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,624
but the simplest plans so often go a miss.

368
00:27:56,165 --> 00:27:58,902
For at the very moment
Hawkins was delayed on the road,

369
00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:01,583
the maid Jean was to run
afoul of the king's men,

370
00:28:01,623 --> 00:28:05,854
who were scouring the countryside
for the fairest wenches in the land.

371
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,355
And so Jean and
the precious wine cart,

372
00:28:13,836 --> 00:28:19,333
were taken to the castle before Hawkins
had even finished repairing his wheel.

373
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:25,310
Ho there!

374
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:27,181
What's that?

375
00:28:29,646 --> 00:28:32,403
Welcome Giacomo! We have come
to escort you to the castle, w..

376
00:28:34,775 --> 00:28:35,983
Haven't we met before?

377
00:28:36,476 --> 00:28:38,484
Ah... it's not very likely,
my good man, you see,

378
00:28:38,526 --> 00:28:40,913
I'm on my way back
from the Italian court.

379
00:28:41,462 --> 00:28:44,576
How speak you the king's
English with no trace of accent?

380
00:28:44,652 --> 00:28:48,611
Ah my dear sir, Giacomo is a master
of many many tongues indeed.

381
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:52,550
French: Je le parle le fleur
ce magnifique, le romantique..

382
00:28:57,252 --> 00:28:59,256
Italian:

383
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:10,133
German: Was haben Sie ausgehšbn
in das Kneibinbabn? Das Schmerz...

384
00:29:17,775 --> 00:29:22,940
which means in any language,
why tarry? Let us off to the castle!

385
00:29:22,163 --> 00:29:24,388
Off to the castle!
- Off to the castle!

386
00:29:25,643 --> 00:29:26,967
To the castle.

387
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:55,317
Quick! The infant!

388
00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:57,579
The infant? Where?

389
00:29:57,105 --> 00:29:58,480
Off of the main!
Off of the main!

390
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:00,914
The child is in the cask.

391
00:30:01,189 --> 00:30:02,299
In the cask?

392
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:03,750
You must take him to the jester.

393
00:30:03,888 --> 00:30:05,481
But the jester
hasn't arrived, yet.

394
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:07,180
Something must
have gone wrong.

395
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:09,976
You look after the child,
I'll have to get the key myself.

396
00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:11,146
But how? - I don't...

397
00:30:11,234 --> 00:30:13,579
Come along there, wench!

398
00:30:25,473 --> 00:30:29,375
My heart knows a lovely song...

399
00:30:34,402 --> 00:30:39,415
So this is the incomparable Giacomo.
He looks not at all like what I expected.

400
00:30:39,557 --> 00:30:42,813
And this singing peacock will
still the voices of Brockhurst,

401
00:30:42,861 --> 00:30:44,261
Finsdale, and Pertwee?

402
00:30:44,298 --> 00:30:47,175
Before midnight, if
he fulfills his bargain.

403
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,415
You sent for me, my lady?

404
00:30:57,454 --> 00:30:59,769
Lock it.

405
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:02,131
What is it, child?
Something wrong, my lady?

406
00:31:02,853 --> 00:31:05,855
Drink! A brew of
your own concocting.

407
00:31:05,973 --> 00:31:09,599
Before I marry Griswold, I
will die, and so will you. Drink!

408
00:31:09,513 --> 00:31:12,833
No! Don't despair, child.
You will not marry Griswold.

409
00:31:12,876 --> 00:31:14,789
I've told you. It was
written in the stars.

410
00:31:14,826 --> 00:31:17,900
Your true love will come
yet, I promise you!

411
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,509
Drink! You lie.

412
00:31:18,553 --> 00:31:22,747
Would I lie to you, child? Your own
Griselda? Look at me! Look in my eyes!

413
00:31:22,788 --> 00:31:24,830
Try not your wiles on me, Witch!

414
00:31:24,992 --> 00:31:28,189
Too often have I seen people look in
those eyes and fall under your evil spell.

415
00:31:28,231 --> 00:31:30,759
You will die for your deceit!

416
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:33,445
Filling my head with fairy
stories of a romantic lover.

417
00:31:33,486 --> 00:31:36,521
A lover who would carry me away
from this monstrous castle!

418
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:39,253
And so he shall! He
comes, even now!

419
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:40,342
You lie!

420
00:31:40,405 --> 00:31:42,569
No, I swear it,
your highness, look!

421
00:31:42,348 --> 00:31:43,930
If this be another
one of your tricks...

422
00:31:43,962 --> 00:31:47,380
Trust me, look. Look,
near the drawbridge.

423
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,730
King of jesters, jester of kings.

424
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,990
He is most fair of countenance.

425
00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:01,390
Oh yes he is!

426
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:04,287
Handsome of bearing. -Like Apollo of
the Greeks! -A figure of romance.

427
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:06,263
Sent by the gods,
and for you alone!

428
00:32:06,403 --> 00:32:08,509
Now mark this, creature of evil.

429
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,907
If this be not my true love,

430
00:32:10,967 --> 00:32:12,796
and I am faced with
marriage to Griswold,

431
00:32:12,829 --> 00:32:15,686
you will die, and by my hand.

432
00:32:15,723 --> 00:32:19,340
Fear not, m'lady, your lover will
be here, in this room, within the hour.

433
00:32:19,373 --> 00:32:22,663
And he will prove that
his is a mission of love.

434
00:32:23,378 --> 00:32:26,717
For your sake, dear
Griselda, he had better.

435
00:32:35,374 --> 00:32:41,480
I am Giacomo, Giacomo,
my fame before me rings,

436
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:46,193
a king of jesters, and jester of kings!

437
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:55,692
my heart knows a
lovely song.. heh heh..

438
00:33:00,852 --> 00:33:05,279
it whistles it all day long

439
00:33:09,636 --> 00:33:13,392
Giacomo is my nom de plume,

440
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,885
I whistle and hum
but I hum to whom?

441
00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:22,391
To whom do I hum, to whom?

442
00:33:28,913 --> 00:33:33,270
My song of love let
the whole world hear

443
00:33:34,124 --> 00:33:36,961
until that sweet moment,

444
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:40,757
that moment when you appear,

445
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:47,349
I'll whisper it in your ear,

446
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:17,210
I bid you welcome!
I am Ravenhurst.

447
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:21,431
Ravenhurst Ravenhurst?
Uh the real Ravenhurst?

448
00:34:21,461 --> 00:34:22,353
What?

449
00:34:22,387 --> 00:34:25,278
Does the king know? I mean does the king
know about your being the real Ravenhurst?

450
00:34:25,322 --> 00:34:26,532
Keep your jests for the king.

451
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:27,992
Don't stand there gaping!

452
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:30,271
You, Fergus and the others,
get the jester's bags!

453
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,773
You arrived not a
moment too soon.

454
00:34:32,824 --> 00:34:34,440
When do we start?
- Tonight.

455
00:34:34,474 --> 00:34:37,362
Good. I'd like to get in, get on with it,
get it over with, and get out. Get it?

456
00:34:37,396 --> 00:34:39,289
Got it. - Good.

457
00:34:39,574 --> 00:34:41,621
That was an interesting
song you sing.

458
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:43,117
Thank you, I'm glad
you liked it, old man.

459
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,487
Did it go like this?

460
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:46,994
Ostle about your business!

461
00:34:48,278 --> 00:34:49,809
What is the first step?

462
00:34:50,311 --> 00:34:52,380
Get me to the king's chambers.

463
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,721
The king's chambers?
- Yes...

464
00:34:53,766 --> 00:34:54,775
Very well, if you say so.

465
00:34:54,807 --> 00:34:56,775
It may be the Key to
the whole plan, get it?

466
00:34:56,815 --> 00:34:58,155
Got it. - Good.

467
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,963
Yes, yes, I'll take
Griswold's emissaries,

468
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,527
but for the moment there
are other matters...

469
00:35:01,563 --> 00:35:04,494
I understand the wenches have
arrived. Where are they?

470
00:35:04,534 --> 00:35:05,400
What have we here?

471
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:07,449
Uh, Sire, may I present
the incomparable Giacomo.

472
00:35:07,483 --> 00:35:10,228
Uh, king of jesters,
and jester of kings.

473
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,532
Oh, yes! From Italy. I haven't
been there for years.

474
00:35:12,557 --> 00:35:14,672
Tell me, how go things
at the Italian court?

475
00:35:14,706 --> 00:35:15,735
Ah very well indeed, sire.

476
00:35:15,768 --> 00:35:19,699
Splendid, splendid. what about
all those stories we've heard?

477
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:21,195
Wasn't it awful about
the Duchess of Urber ?

478
00:35:21,231 --> 00:35:23,980
Oh, just. Uh, just awful, sire.

479
00:35:23,132 --> 00:35:25,103
I ask you, how could a
thing like that happen?

480
00:35:25,143 --> 00:35:29,130
Well, sire, you know the Italian court;
what better place to court Italians?

481
00:35:29,592 --> 00:35:32,182
Italian court? Court Italians!

482
00:35:33,322 --> 00:35:35,865
Ah, Ravenhurst, the fellow
has wit! Ah, I must say,

483
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,769
I was shocked to hear about the
Duchess. What did the Duke do?

484
00:35:40,487 --> 00:35:41,528
Pardon?

485
00:35:41,567 --> 00:35:43,900
The Duke. What did
the Duke do?

486
00:35:43,221 --> 00:35:44,420
Eh... the Duke do?

487
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,842
Yes. And what
about the Douge ?

488
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,503
Oh, the Douge!

489
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:49,202
Eh. Well what did
the Douge do?

490
00:35:49,737 --> 00:35:51,666
The Douge do?
- Yes, the Douge do.

491
00:35:51,748 --> 00:35:54,139
Well, uh, the Douge did what
the Douge does. Eh, uh,

492
00:35:54,172 --> 00:35:56,414
Oh, when the Douge does his
duty to the Duke, that is.

493
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,349
What? What's that?

494
00:35:57,384 --> 00:35:58,559
Oh, it's very simple, sire.

495
00:35:58,621 --> 00:36:00,512
When the Douge did his
duty and the Duke didn't,

496
00:36:00,547 --> 00:36:03,190
that's when the Duchess did the
dirt to the Duke with the Douge.

497
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,119
Who did what to what?

498
00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:06,780
Oh, they all did, sire. There
they were in the dark;

499
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,887
The Duke with his dagger, the Douge
with his dart, Duchess with her dirk.

500
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:10,213
Duchess with her dirk?
- Yes!

501
00:36:10,231 --> 00:36:12,750
The Duchess dove at the Duke just
when the Duke dove at the Douge.

502
00:36:12,786 --> 00:36:15,909
Now the Duke ducked, the Douge
dodged, and the Duchess didn't.

503
00:36:15,123 --> 00:36:18,367
So the Duke got the Duchess, the Duchess
got the Douge, and the Douge got the Duke!

504
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:22,282
Curious. I... I... hm?
What? What's that?

505
00:36:22,315 --> 00:36:25,710
All I heard was that the Duchess had a
siege of rheumatism. She's 83, you know.

506
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,693
Oh, come next summer, sire.

507
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:28,119
So's the Duke.
- So's the Duke.

508
00:36:28,148 --> 00:36:30,581
Remarkable, those Italians, what?

509
00:36:34,331 --> 00:36:37,251
Made the whole thing
up, didn't you? Ho ha.

510
00:36:37,286 --> 00:36:39,710
Very witty, very clever.
Just what this court needs

511
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:44,202
Laughter, gaiety, songs,
wenches... oh, yes. Wenches.

512
00:36:44,425 --> 00:36:46,329
I'm just on my way to
inspect the lot of them.

513
00:36:46,425 --> 00:36:48,362
Who knows, I may
find some luscious...

514
00:36:48,394 --> 00:36:49,494
Oh, sire.

515
00:36:49,903 --> 00:36:52,331
If I may suggest, it ill befits the
propriety of your high office

516
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:54,539
to be seen with these
unkempt wenches. - Wha...?

517
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:58,764
It is said the incomparable Giacomo
has a discerning eye for beauty.

518
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:02,487
Eh, why not let him select a
suitable companion for your majesty?

519
00:37:02,525 --> 00:37:04,300
Excellent! Excellent!

520
00:37:04,606 --> 00:37:09,750
I trust the jester's reputation is based
on many years of accomplishment?

521
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,510
Why do you think they call
me incomparable, sire? Get it?

522
00:37:12,655 --> 00:37:14,275
Got it. - Good.

523
00:37:15,773 --> 00:37:17,855
Bring her to my chambers.
Within the hour?

524
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,367
Within the hour.

525
00:37:20,402 --> 00:37:22,128
Finish with the king and
come to my chambers.

526
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,365
Within the hour.

527
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:25,268
Eh, about that song, sir...

528
00:37:25,317 --> 00:37:26,690
Some other time, my good man.

529
00:37:26,753 --> 00:37:28,456
Yes, Fergus, get on
with your work!

530
00:37:28,786 --> 00:37:31,726
The good captain will escort you
to your quarters. - Very well.

531
00:37:32,215 --> 00:37:34,398
Are you sure we
haven't met before?

532
00:37:34,612 --> 00:37:36,309
Quite sure.

533
00:37:36,503 --> 00:37:37,972
Within the hour.

534
00:37:41,235 --> 00:37:43,954
Your Giacomo seems more
the fool than the assassin.

535
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:46,791
Or perchance a brilliant
combination of both.

536
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:48,172
We shall see.

537
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:56,648
I'm Giacomo, Giacomo,
my fame before me rings,

538
00:37:56,943 --> 00:38:01,556
king of jesters,
and jester of kings!

539
00:38:02,175 --> 00:38:03,255
What are you doing here?

540
00:38:03,293 --> 00:38:04,670
I'm Fergus, the Ostler.

541
00:38:04,905 --> 00:38:06,880
Whobis the whatsler?

542
00:38:06,123 --> 00:38:09,710
Fergus the Ostler. It is I, not
Ravenhurst who is your friend.

543
00:38:09,822 --> 00:38:12,286
Look, my good man, you pick
your friends and I shall pick mine.

544
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:14,536
At the moment, I have a very
important mission with the king.

545
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:18,215
After all, I'm the incomparable Giacomo,
king of jesters and jester of kings.

546
00:38:18,405 --> 00:38:20,251
I have entertained in
all the courts of Europe

547
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:23,317
and speak a ready wit in their
every tongue. Uh who are you?

548
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:24,597
I am Griselda.

549
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,614
Gruhwhoolda?

550
00:38:25,648 --> 00:38:28,949
Griselda. I bring you a
message from the princess.

551
00:38:28,132 --> 00:38:29,271
Uh, the royal princess?

552
00:38:29,313 --> 00:38:31,527
She finds you most attractive
and would like to meet you.

553
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:32,617
M-m-me? - Yes.

554
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,661
She finds you passing
fair, passing graceful.

555
00:38:34,693 --> 00:38:37,574
Oh, uh, tell her thank you very
much but I'm just passing through.

556
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:40,179
One does not ordinarily
refuse princesses...

557
00:38:40,302 --> 00:38:42,389
Well, one doesn't
ordinarily, but you see...

558
00:38:42,849 --> 00:38:44,239
Is it possible there's someone
else of whom you are fond?

559
00:38:44,271 --> 00:38:46,336
Uh y-yes, as a matter
of fact there is.

560
00:38:46,378 --> 00:38:48,119
Giacomo, would you
look in my eye?

561
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,800
Eye?

562
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:50,938
Yes, it's been troubling me,

563
00:38:50,971 --> 00:38:54,219
and I thought that the great Giacomo
would have a knowledge of science.

564
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,306
Eh s-science. Well, yes,

565
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,664
as a matter of fact I have a
great deal of scientific knowledge.

566
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:58,998
We have b-b-which eye?

567
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:01,291
Both. Look at them both.

568
00:39:02,335 --> 00:39:05,210
Closer, closer. Deeper,

569
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,195
deeper. Deeper, deeper.

570
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,728
Tails of lizards, ears of swine,

571
00:39:11,762 --> 00:39:13,596
chicken gizzards soaked in brine,

572
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:16,614
now thine eyes and mine
entwine, thy will is broken,

573
00:39:16,675 --> 00:39:18,766
thou are mine!

574
00:39:19,128 --> 00:39:21,809
Repeat after me. I am
craven and thou art my master!

575
00:39:21,835 --> 00:39:23,204
I am craven and
thou art my master!

576
00:39:23,222 --> 00:39:24,376
Stand there, fool.
- Stand there, fool.

577
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:26,418
Silence! - Silence!

578
00:39:26,452 --> 00:39:28,543
You are in my power and
will obey my every command.

579
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:29,541
Every command...

580
00:39:29,572 --> 00:39:30,869
And remember,
any time I choose,

581
00:39:30,905 --> 00:39:33,981
a mere snap of my fingers can
bring you out of the spell like this!

582
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,469
And back like that!

583
00:39:35,594 --> 00:39:36,871
Do you understand, fool?

584
00:39:36,903 --> 00:39:39,914
Yes, master. You can snap
me in and snap me out.

585
00:39:39,951 --> 00:39:41,385
Now, listen closely.

586
00:39:43,344 --> 00:39:46,250
First and foremost, you must
convince the girl that this is a miracle,

587
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:47,672
that you have been
sent here by the gods.

588
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:50,820
To do that, you must go
to her room and make love!

589
00:39:50,132 --> 00:39:51,864
Go and make love
to the princess!

590
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,909
The princess...

591
00:39:52,949 --> 00:39:55,164
At once! Wait!
Not like that!

592
00:39:55,164 --> 00:39:56,639
You are a figure of romance;

593
00:39:56,675 --> 00:40:00,121
of spirit and action, but at the
same time humble and tender.

594
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:03,184
You are a man of iron
with the soul of a poet.

595
00:40:03,224 --> 00:40:07,610
You are adventurous, gay, but
with a lovers brooding melancholy,

596
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,983
and above all, you
must show passion!

597
00:40:09,297 --> 00:40:10,443
Show passion!

598
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:13,588
Not me, you fool!
Now go. Make love.

599
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,181
Climb the vine to the tower
where your love awaits you! Stop!

600
00:40:18,427 --> 00:40:21,103
Above all, remember you
must be cavalier, dashing!

601
00:40:21,195 --> 00:40:22,681
Fear not, master!

602
00:40:22,733 --> 00:40:26,387
Once I'm up the thorny vine,
the regal maiden shall be mine.

603
00:40:27,331 --> 00:40:28,936
Fear not, master!

604
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:02,340
Hawkins!

605
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,628
You got here!

606
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:08,766
Well of course I got
here, my silly little goose!

607
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,856
Thank heaven.

608
00:41:09,896 --> 00:41:12,764
Ah-cha-cha, you'll have to
wait your turn like the others!

609
00:41:12,798 --> 00:41:14,268
Good, good, you're doing it well.

610
00:41:14,297 --> 00:41:16,492
But have you heard the
change of plan? Here, take this.

611
00:41:16,525 --> 00:41:18,972
I just told you, dear, you'll
just have to wait your turn.

612
00:41:18,983 --> 00:41:21,445
Now don't overdo it.
Fergus will bring you the infant.

613
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:22,400
Huh?

614
00:41:22,434 --> 00:41:24,715
Well, well, Giacomo.

615
00:41:25,188 --> 00:41:26,811
Successful so soon?

616
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,753
Truly as dainty a dish as
ever was set before a king.

617
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:32,148
About your business, I would
have a word with the maid.

618
00:41:32,251 --> 00:41:33,672
Your majesty.

619
00:41:37,264 --> 00:41:39,170
What is your name, child?

620
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:40,389
Jean, sire.

621
00:41:40,114 --> 00:41:42,610
Jean. Lovely name.

622
00:41:42,688 --> 00:41:44,289
For a lovely face.

623
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:46,351
See that she is
jeweled and gowned.

624
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:48,608
She shall sit next to me
at the banquet, tonight.

625
00:42:12,568 --> 00:42:15,469
You! You've come!

626
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:20,146
At your service, my lady.

627
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,541
So this is Giacomo!

628
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:24,923
King of jesters
and jester of kings.

629
00:42:24,956 --> 00:42:26,413
Not today, m'lady.

630
00:42:26,452 --> 00:42:29,268
Today I am Giacomo,
a lover of beauty,

631
00:42:29,737 --> 00:42:31,557
and a beauty of a lover.

632
00:42:31,978 --> 00:42:34,490
Can this be true?
Or is it merely a dream?

633
00:42:34,614 --> 00:42:36,686
Dream? Is this a dream?

634
00:42:36,742 --> 00:42:38,784
Or this? Or this? Or this?

635
00:42:38,818 --> 00:42:40,429
Or this? Or this?

636
00:42:40,463 --> 00:42:42,516
No, no, no, we are
strangers, hardly met.

637
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:44,902
What manner of man
are you, Giacomo?

638
00:42:45,353 --> 00:42:47,938
What manner of man
is Giacomo? Ha ha!

639
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,925
I shall tell you what
manner of man is he.

640
00:42:49,963 --> 00:42:52,322
He lives for a sigh,
he dies for a kiss,

641
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:54,215
he lusts for the laugh, ha!

642
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,878
He never walks
when he can leap!

643
00:42:59,445 --> 00:43:01,405
he never flees
when he can fight.

644
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:05,751
He swoons at the
beauty of a rose.

645
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,164
And I offer myself
to you, all of me.

646
00:43:08,233 --> 00:43:11,434
My heart. My lips.
My legs. My calves.

647
00:43:11,449 --> 00:43:13,577
Do what you will..
my love endures.

648
00:43:16,206 --> 00:43:18,311
Beat me. Kick me.

649
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,170
I am yours.

650
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:23,806
Oh, Giacomo,
you are so ardent!

651
00:43:23,907 --> 00:43:25,548
With your permission, my lady,

652
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:26,990
I'd like to go 'round again.

653
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,853
Oh, no, Giacomo,
we must be discreet.

654
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,231
Ha! Discretion is for
fools and simpletons!

655
00:43:35,836 --> 00:43:38,856
This cannot be! Miracles
are things of fancy,

656
00:43:38,903 --> 00:43:40,733
and lovers are not
sent by the gods.

657
00:43:41,391 --> 00:43:42,878
Speak not too
lightly, my love.

658
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:46,117
Who are we to say
nay to miracles?

659
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,822
But one doesn't find love
in one moment, one kiss..

660
00:43:49,512 --> 00:43:51,170
that key? Where
did you find it?

661
00:43:51,204 --> 00:43:52,648
Key? - It is a miracle!

662
00:43:52,681 --> 00:43:55,809
The gods who sent you have also
provided a means for our escape.

663
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,239
This is the key to the
secret passageway.

664
00:43:57,579 --> 00:43:59,452
Grand. We leave at
midnight. Get it?

665
00:43:59,487 --> 00:44:00,844
Got it. - Good.

666
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:02,309
Very good.

667
00:44:02,335 --> 00:44:04,719
Oh no, my precious,
I'll keep it next to my heart;

668
00:44:04,753 --> 00:44:06,393
a sweet symbol of your love.

669
00:44:06,434 --> 00:44:08,952
And take this, a
sweet symbol of mine.

670
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:11,760
I'll wear it always
next to my heart.

671
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:13,512
Gwendolyn?

672
00:44:13,668 --> 00:44:15,753
Are you there? I would
have words with you?

673
00:44:15,856 --> 00:44:17,661
My father. You must hide!

674
00:44:17,695 --> 00:44:19,802
Hide? Giacomo
hides for no man!

675
00:44:19,844 --> 00:44:22,969
But you must! He'd kill any
man found in my chambers.

676
00:44:22,135 --> 00:44:25,414
Ah, be he king or peasant,
my ready blade will find its mark!

677
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:26,871
I'll... I'll..

678
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:30,231
I..I live for a sigh, I die for a
laugh, I lust for a laugh, ha ha!

679
00:44:30,284 --> 00:44:31,492
Please! - What?

680
00:44:31,532 --> 00:44:33,143
Or our lives aren't
worth that!

681
00:44:33,177 --> 00:44:34,353
What? Eh, eh? Eh?

682
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:41,815
Are you alone, my dear?
I thought I heard voices.

683
00:44:41,853 --> 00:44:43,730
Yes, I'm quite alone, father.

684
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:45,643
The king!

685
00:44:45,677 --> 00:44:47,179
Listen, my child. I've just
met Griswold's emissary,

686
00:44:47,215 --> 00:44:48,434
and the marriage is approved.

687
00:44:48,472 --> 00:44:49,811
You know very well, father,

688
00:44:49,846 --> 00:44:52,353
that when I marry,
I marry only for love.

689
00:44:52,385 --> 00:44:55,141
Heh, heh, I knew you'd say that.
Now, Gwendolyn, do be reasonable.

690
00:44:55,175 --> 00:44:57,701
Don't you realize that without
this alliance, our prestige,

691
00:44:57,737 --> 00:45:00,489
our power, our position
could go like that!

692
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,860
Well, then let it go like that!

693
00:45:02,161 --> 00:45:03,634
I wish you to marry Griswold.

694
00:45:03,677 --> 00:45:05,635
And suppose I do not
wish to marry Griswold?

695
00:45:05,668 --> 00:45:06,972
I don't give a fig
for your wishes!

696
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:08,818
And I don't give
a fig for yours!

697
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,349
No one snaps at the king!
Don't you dare snap at me!

698
00:45:11,387 --> 00:45:12,480
I'll snap if I choose!

699
00:45:12,516 --> 00:45:14,237
Don't snap at me!
- I will snap!

700
00:45:14,262 --> 00:45:16,478
You won't! Now
understand this, my child.

701
00:45:16,711 --> 00:45:18,800
This castle has walls
high and strong,

702
00:45:18,994 --> 00:45:21,487
with massive gates
under lock and key.

703
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,385
Whilst you remain within
those walls and I am king,

704
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,581
you will obey my command.

705
00:45:27,152 --> 00:45:31,353
Very well, father. Perhaps I have
been selfish and thoughtless.

706
00:45:31,391 --> 00:45:35,251
Oh, my child. I knew I
could depend upon you.

707
00:45:35,297 --> 00:45:37,103
Because you are a princess.

708
00:45:37,137 --> 00:45:40,126
A true princess.
Loyal to the crown.

709
00:45:40,146 --> 00:45:43,322
Sympathetic.
Sensitive. Faithful.

710
00:45:47,235 --> 00:45:48,597
The key to the
secret passage!

711
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:49,472
Father, let me have it...

712
00:45:49,505 --> 00:45:51,260
So, run away, would you!
Well, you trick me not.

713
00:45:51,293 --> 00:45:52,588
This key will never
leave my person.

714
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,347
You will marry Griswold
upon the morrow,

715
00:45:54,476 --> 00:45:56,891
and I promise you, daughter
or not, princess or not,

716
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:01,306
one move,  one false move,
and your neck will snap like a twig!

717
00:46:01,762 --> 00:46:03,757
Where is he? Giacomo
hides not behind drapes!

718
00:46:03,777 --> 00:46:04,902
No no no, you must go!

719
00:46:04,934 --> 00:46:06,789
I'll cut him to ribbons.

720
00:46:06,105 --> 00:46:07,815
No, we'll escape tonight
after the banquet.

721
00:46:07,987 --> 00:46:11,550
Very well, my sweet.
Until tonight. Very good.

722
00:46:11,536 --> 00:46:13,333
Do be cautious,
sweet Giacomo!

723
00:46:13,373 --> 00:46:16,242
Ha! Caution is for
popinjays and cockatoos

724
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:18,862
Begging your pardon.
Until tonight, my sweet.

725
00:46:18,896 --> 00:46:19,981
But you heard what
my father said.

726
00:46:20,139 --> 00:46:22,623
If caught, our necks
will snap like twigs!

727
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:26,862
Uh... like what?
- Twigs!

728
00:46:26,898 --> 00:46:29,963
Twigs? Speak not of twigs
when you look at an oak!

729
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,842
Until tonight,
my little sapling.

730
00:46:35,989 --> 00:46:38,567
If Giacomo says he will
be here within the hour,

731
00:46:38,608 --> 00:46:41,601
he will be here...
eh, within the hour!

732
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:45,130
At your service, m'lord!

733
00:46:45,858 --> 00:46:48,974
Your arrival, good Giacomo,
shows imagination and brilliance.

734
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,262
Did you expect less?

735
00:46:50,289 --> 00:46:53,099
Are you now prepared to fulfill
the bargain arranged by my agent,

736
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,905
Sir Burton of Allenburg?
- Quite.

737
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,974
Very well, then.
There are two plans.

738
00:46:57,239 --> 00:46:58,523
Two plans.
- Plan one.

739
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:02,760
The untimely demise of my lords
Brockhurst, Finsdale, and Pertwee.

740
00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:04,119
These three
will die tonight.

741
00:47:04,206 --> 00:47:05,840
Three for tonight. Proceed.

742
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,760
The method I leave to you.
But die they must.

743
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:12,175
Heh! They shall
drop like flies.

744
00:47:12,215 --> 00:47:14,206
Precisely. Like flies.

745
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:16,260
Do you have some
sort of twitch?

746
00:47:16,371 --> 00:47:18,838
Twitch? I twitch
only for action.

747
00:47:18,954 --> 00:47:20,949
I live for a sigh,
I die for a kiss.

748
00:47:20,983 --> 00:47:22,114
I like that very much.
- Thank you.

749
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,693
I lust for a laugh. Ha ha!

750
00:47:23,728 --> 00:47:26,371
I never leap when I can walk,
I never flee when I can fight!

751
00:47:26,407 --> 00:47:27,331
Yes, but, but...
- I... pardon?

752
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:30,760
Listen carefully! If plan one fails,
you must execute plan two.

753
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:31,541
Plan two?

754
00:47:31,577 --> 00:47:34,425
Take the princess from the
castle before midnight.

755
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,199
By whatever means
you may devise.

756
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:38,172
For murder or abduction,
I'm your man.

757
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:39,983
You've paid the price;
name your plan.

758
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:41,351
First, plan one.

759
00:47:41,393 --> 00:47:45,222
Are you sure you can dispose of my
lords Brockhurst, Finsdale, and Pertwee?

760
00:47:45,565 --> 00:47:46,356
Are they married?

761
00:47:46,556 --> 00:47:47,391
Yes...

762
00:47:47,425 --> 00:47:49,467
Order flowers for
the widows. Get it?

763
00:47:49,501 --> 00:47:51,800
Got it. - Good.

764
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:55,860
Tally ho! Ho ho!

765
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:02,148
Master, I am Back
- Well?

766
00:48:03,472 --> 00:48:06,961
I have climbed the thorny vine,
and the regal maiden is mine.

767
00:48:07,262 --> 00:48:08,490
Good.

768
00:48:08,914 --> 00:48:10,677
Now, when I release
you from the spell,

769
00:48:10,755 --> 00:48:13,416
you will fall into a deep sleep
and remember nothing.

770
00:48:13,454 --> 00:48:14,277
Nothing...

771
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:18,114
Look into my eye.
Deeper, deeper.

772
00:48:22,717 --> 00:48:24,784
Ah, my lords.
I understand the marriage

773
00:48:24,817 --> 00:48:27,833
of the princess Gwendolyn to Sir
Griswold will be announced tonight.

774
00:48:28,273 --> 00:48:29,893
My congratulations.

775
00:48:32,728 --> 00:48:36,485
There is something afoot.
He is far too confident.

776
00:48:36,554 --> 00:48:38,684
If this alliance
fails, we are lost.

777
00:48:38,722 --> 00:48:41,699
It must not fail. Let us solemnly
pledge that we will permit nothing,

778
00:48:41,735 --> 00:48:44,608
to interfere with the marriage of
Griswold to the princess Gwendolyn.

779
00:48:44,643 --> 00:48:46,407
I so pledge.
- And I.

780
00:48:46,449 --> 00:48:48,335
Though it cost
our very lives!

781
00:48:48,371 --> 00:48:49,679
Our very lives.

782
00:49:00,798 --> 00:49:03,240
Please, stop your picking and
fussing! I must breathe some air!

783
00:49:03,275 --> 00:49:04,519
But madam!

784
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,509
All afternoon without
a moment's peace!

785
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:12,420
I just learned of your
whereabouts. What happened...

786
00:49:12,454 --> 00:49:15,289
Never mind that. You must
take the child to the jester.

787
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:15,952
To the jester!

788
00:49:15,989 --> 00:49:17,195
Immediately. He has the key.

789
00:49:17,233 --> 00:49:18,300
But he's under
the spell of the...

790
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,139
Silence! Give him the child
at once! It is my command.

791
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,539
The jester! Where is the jester?
Summon him immediately!

792
00:49:27,572 --> 00:49:29,349
Very good, sire!

793
00:49:33,487 --> 00:49:35,239
Jester!
- Coming!

794
00:49:35,536 --> 00:49:37,547
Come quickly, man!
The king is waiting!

795
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:39,920
Yes, uh, ha ha, have you
seen Ravenhurst about?

796
00:49:39,126 --> 00:49:40,606
He's somewhere about, yes.

797
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:43,186
Well, I was supposed to see Ravenhurst
on some rather urgent business,

798
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:45,860
but I fell asleep... I don't
quite remember what I...

799
00:49:45,929 --> 00:49:50,469
Ahh, Giacomo. A striking costume,
indeed. From the Italian court, I presume.

800
00:49:50,528 --> 00:49:53,706
Yes, sire, Italian court. Ah, uh,
what better place to, uh...

801
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,315
...court Italians.

802
00:49:56,346 --> 00:49:57,867
Ah, this will be
a festive evening.

803
00:49:57,902 --> 00:50:00,579
Noble knights to joust at
my tournament. Come along.

804
00:50:00,655 --> 00:50:02,697
And by my side a
lovely little wench,

805
00:50:02,721 --> 00:50:06,219
who I'm sure will fulfill every
promise of your discerning eye.

806
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,541
Ah, look at her!

807
00:50:09,728 --> 00:50:13,297
Charming. Charming,
Giacomo, charming.

808
00:50:13,588 --> 00:50:15,532
A tribute to you,
my dear Giacomo.

809
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,945
Come here, my child.
Come.

810
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:22,440
Your majesty.

811
00:50:26,534 --> 00:50:30,976
Was there ever more beauty?
More radiant? Rise, child.

812
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:35,485
The sweetness of your smile
outshines the elegance of your gown.

813
00:50:36,219 --> 00:50:37,393
Thank you, sire.

814
00:50:37,572 --> 00:50:39,329
Would you attend me?

815
00:50:40,242 --> 00:50:42,208
You are most gracious, sire.

816
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:50,682
Quickly. Use the key.

817
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:51,768
Key?

818
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:54,317
Remember, plan one
Brockhurst, Finsdale, Pertwee.

819
00:50:54,644 --> 00:50:56,467
Brockhurst, Finsdale, Pertwee.

820
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,237
Midnight. Horses
at the north gate.

821
00:50:59,271 --> 00:51:00,753
Horses at the north gate...

822
00:51:04,956 --> 00:51:06,744
Summon the jester!

823
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:09,271
Where are you going?
Didn't you hear the king?

824
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:10,940
Ah, beh, beh...

825
00:51:10,132 --> 00:51:13,257
Cover your head!
Now get in there!

826
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:25,152
Come, come, Giacomo, let us
be gay! I would have a song.

827
00:51:25,195 --> 00:51:27,800
Eh. Song.
- Has the cat your tongue?

828
00:51:27,121 --> 00:51:28,347
Uh, no, I...

829
00:51:28,382 --> 00:51:30,246
What do you carry
there? Why the basket?

830
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:33,248
Beh, basket?
What basket, sire?

831
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:36,530
What basket, indeed!

832
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:39,326
Come, boy, come, show me
what you have in the basket.

833
00:51:39,389 --> 00:51:40,579
Wuh, I can... eh...

834
00:51:40,614 --> 00:51:42,490
Yes, come on, show me what
you have in the basket.

835
00:51:42,523 --> 00:51:43,353
Eh, beh basket? It-it's...

836
00:51:43,393 --> 00:51:45,500
Yes, and what about that song?

837
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,420
S-s-song, sire? Eh beh s-song.

838
00:51:47,862 --> 00:51:49,442
If your majesty doth ask it,

839
00:51:49,485 --> 00:51:53,309
I will tell about the basket with a
willo willo wailey and a nonny nonny

840
00:51:56,286 --> 00:51:57,528
What's that?
With a what?

841
00:51:57,565 --> 00:52:01,413
Uh with a willo willo wailey and
a nonny nonny loo loo loo

842
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:03,550
I'll loo loo loo loo...

843
00:52:06,391 --> 00:52:07,922
What are you
loo-loo-looing about?

844
00:52:07,969 --> 00:52:11,179
Oh, I'm not loo-loo-looing,
sire, I'm willo willo wailing.

845
00:52:11,235 --> 00:52:13,543
All right, all right,
willo away, willo away.

846
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:16,916
We will willo it away...

847
00:52:17,132 --> 00:52:20,630
we'll willo willo willo
we will willo it away!

848
00:52:20,682 --> 00:52:23,534
with a willo willo wailey,
we will sing about it gaily,

849
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:27,873
with a willo willo wailey
and a hey! nonny... no!

850
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,452
Come back here!
What have you there?

851
00:52:30,532 --> 00:52:32,880
What have you
in the basket?

852
00:52:32,126 --> 00:52:34,594
Eh beh basket? Oh,
b- sire, it's nothing, sire.

853
00:52:34,632 --> 00:52:38,235
Merely a jester's
bag of tricks, sire.

854
00:52:38,235 --> 00:52:39,387
It's a secret, sire.

855
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:42,568
Y-yes, a deep,
dark secret - beh -

856
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:47,612
which has never before been
revealed to anybody in the world, sire.

857
00:52:47,652 --> 00:52:49,208
But I...

858
00:52:49,871 --> 00:52:52,222
I am prepared
to make a statement.

859
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:56,902
I was a lad, I was gloomy and sad as
I was from the day I was born!

860
00:52:57,103 --> 00:53:00,434
When other babes giggled and gurgled
and wiggled I proudly was loudly forlorn!

861
00:53:00,498 --> 00:53:04,469
My friends and my family looked at me
clammily, thought there was something amiss!

862
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,331
When others found various antics
hilarious, all I could manage was this!

863
00:53:07,597 --> 00:53:08,384
or this!

864
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,317
or this!

865
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:10,489
or this!

866
00:53:11,193 --> 00:53:12,884
My father, he shouted
He needs to be clouted.

867
00:53:12,918 --> 00:53:14,528
His teeth on a
wreath I'll hand him!

868
00:53:14,563 --> 00:53:16,269
My mother she cried as
she rushed to my side.

869
00:53:16,315 --> 00:53:17,938
You're a brute! and you
don't understand him!

870
00:53:17,983 --> 00:53:19,719
So they sent for a witch
with a terrible twitch

871
00:53:19,777 --> 00:53:21,521
to ask how my
future impressed her.

872
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:24,175
She took one look
at me and cried he...

873
00:53:25,179 --> 00:53:27,722
hee hee hee.. he?

874
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,572
What else could he
be but a jester?

875
00:53:29,735 --> 00:53:33,581
A jester? A jester?
A funny idear a jester!

876
00:53:33,701 --> 00:53:35,630
No butcher, no baker,
no candlestick maker

877
00:53:35,695 --> 00:53:38,692
and me with the look of a fine
undertaker impressed her...

878
00:53:39,246 --> 00:53:40,786
as a jester?

879
00:53:40,925 --> 00:53:44,436
But where could I learn any comical
turn that was not in a book on the shelf?

880
00:53:44,474 --> 00:53:47,844
No teacher to take me to mold me
and make me a merry mad fool or an elf!

881
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,686
But I'm proud to recall that in no
time at all with no other recourses

882
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:54,681
but my own resources with firm
application and determination...

883
00:53:54,905 --> 00:53:57,414
I made a fool of myself!

884
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,822
I found a bow and arrow
and I learned to shoot.

885
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:05,117
I found a little horn
and I learned to too.

886
00:54:05,139 --> 00:54:07,458
Now I can shoot and
too, ain't I cute?

887
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:16,648
(no end of song)

888
00:55:42,786 --> 00:55:44,606
Tend to your duties!
Serve your drinks!

889
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,771
Hold it with that basket.
Let's have a look!

890
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:03,152
A toast! A toast!

891
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:05,538
A toast to his most
royal highness!

892
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:09,612
To Roderick the first, for all that he
has done for this great England of ours,

893
00:56:09,896 --> 00:56:13,335
may providence provide
a true and just reward!

894
00:56:13,588 --> 00:56:16,500
To the king!

895
00:56:25,579 --> 00:56:26,615
Brockhurst!

896
00:56:27,822 --> 00:56:28,802
Brilliant.

897
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:32,753
Finsdale!

898
00:56:33,784 --> 00:56:34,965
Magnificent!

899
00:56:36,744 --> 00:56:37,960
Pertwee!

900
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:40,532
Fantastic!

901
00:56:40,614 --> 00:56:42,875
Brockhurst, Finsdale, Pertwee...

902
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:44,900
They are all dead, sire!

903
00:56:45,297 --> 00:56:47,302
As you said, flowers
for the widows.

904
00:56:47,885 --> 00:56:49,407
Dead. Murdered.

905
00:56:49,445 --> 00:56:52,231
And by whose hand?
And who may be next?

906
00:56:54,969 --> 00:56:56,905
Sir Griswold of Mackalwane
is approaching the castle!

907
00:56:56,934 --> 00:56:59,668
And just in time. He comes
not a moment too soon.

908
00:56:59,717 --> 00:57:01,188
Bid Sir Griswold enter!

909
00:57:01,302 --> 00:57:02,367
Plan two.

910
00:57:05,521 --> 00:57:06,804
Plan two?

911
00:57:09,639 --> 00:57:10,275
Plan two.

912
00:57:12,681 --> 00:57:14,492
Get those bodies out of here!

913
00:57:23,878 --> 00:57:25,521
Quick, take him to safety.

914
00:57:26,612 --> 00:57:28,650
...And get those goblets away.

915
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:29,706
And... no! Not you, jester, not you.

916
00:57:29,769 --> 00:57:31,443
Come here, come here,
boy, come here.

917
00:57:35,204 --> 00:57:37,605
Sir Griswold of Mackalwane!

918
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:40,099
Approach, Sir Griswold.

919
00:57:40,389 --> 00:57:42,300
Lighten the mood,
jester, a note of...

920
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:48,711
My liege lord.

921
00:57:48,911 --> 00:57:51,900
Sir Griswold of Mackalwane,
I bid thee welcome.

922
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,956
Ehh, a-welcome, Sir Griswold,
your beard is full of hair,

923
00:57:55,992 --> 00:57:59,501
but do I say welcome
or do I say mehh!

924
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,889
Sire. My emissary did report.

925
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,657
And I proudly
accept your terms.

926
00:58:07,135 --> 00:58:09,304
Eh... th-the terms! the terms!

927
00:58:09,346 --> 00:58:12,501
He doth accept the terms.
He looks not smart, but in...

928
00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:15,132
Excellent, excellent!
Members of the court,

929
00:58:15,163 --> 00:58:18,514
know you that the crown would
make a most felicitous announcement,

930
00:58:18,527 --> 00:58:21,445
concerning the defense and
security of our great kingdom,

931
00:58:21,768 --> 00:58:25,639
I would have you know that
today was an alliance consummated,

932
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:28,190
between the crown and our
honored and valiant Baron,

933
00:58:28,251 --> 00:58:30,204
Sir Griswold of Mackalwane.

934
00:58:30,402 --> 00:58:32,182
Uh, the terms! the terms!

935
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,498
We've already had the terms.

936
00:58:33,538 --> 00:58:34,503
Sorry.

937
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,268
To cement this alliance,

938
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:37,795
I have decreed a royal marriage,

939
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:41,121
between Sir Griswold of Mackalwane,
and Gwendolyn the Fair.

940
00:58:41,896 --> 00:58:45,460
Eh, eh rejoice! rejoice!
Although his brain is brief,

941
00:58:45,494 --> 00:58:48,715
for when the larder's empty,
she'll have her ton of beef!

942
00:58:49,782 --> 00:58:51,972
Would you like to try
the other side, sire?

943
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:53,164
Thank you, sire.

944
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:54,744
What say our gallant Griswold?

945
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,106
Sire. Princess fair.
From this moment on,

946
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,885
this hand, this steel, this heart,

947
00:59:00,927 --> 00:59:03,574
will exist for naught
but the love of the lady...

948
00:59:03,577 --> 00:59:07,619
Save your breath, Griswold!
There will be no alliance and no marriage.

949
00:59:08,349 --> 00:59:09,639
What's that?

950
00:59:09,313 --> 00:59:12,514
I cannot marry Griswold,
father. I love another.

951
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:13,286
Another?

952
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,396
Another, another...

953
00:59:15,434 --> 00:59:17,827
What is this nonsense?
What do you mean you love another?

954
00:59:17,927 --> 00:59:22,849
Simply that, father. A miracle has
occurred to fulfill my every dream.

955
00:59:22,146 --> 00:59:25,157
I have found my love,
father. My true love.

956
00:59:25,286 --> 00:59:26,309
Who is this man?

957
00:59:26,347 --> 00:59:28,860
One to whom I have given
my heart and my hand.

958
00:59:28,905 --> 00:59:32,601
He who even now wears my silken
handkerchief next to his heart.

959
00:59:32,643 --> 00:59:33,858
What's that?
- What's that?

960
00:59:33,989 --> 00:59:37,523
Ah.. Her heart, her hand,
she holds for joy or grief,

961
00:59:37,596 --> 00:59:40,894
but he who holds her hand
holds her heart kerchief.

962
00:59:40,942 --> 00:59:43,713
eh handkerchief,
eh hand kerheart,

963
00:59:43,753 --> 00:59:45,438
heart ke he
che ha- hah,

964
00:59:45,472 --> 00:59:46,969
Who is this man? His name!

965
00:59:47,164 --> 00:59:50,141
The man I love is a simple
man, but noble of heart.

966
00:59:50,233 --> 00:59:52,360
My beloved Giacomo!
- What?!

967
00:59:52,396 --> 00:59:55,695
Uh. His name, his name,
and now his blood must flow.

968
00:59:55,751 --> 01:00:01,255
Light up the oil, this man must boil,
this man named Giaco- mo? oh! No!

969
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,126
Seize this wretch and search him!

970
01:00:03,181 --> 01:00:04,722
Eh... I- I'm- Th-th-this
is a little mistake, sire.

971
01:00:04,755 --> 01:00:07,576
I don't have  her heartkerchief,
uh, handkerheart. I don't have th..

972
01:00:08,572 --> 01:00:09,809
A handkerchief!

973
01:00:10,157 --> 01:00:11,664
G! Gwendolyn!

974
01:00:11,697 --> 01:00:13,838
Uh, n-n-no, sire.
Geh-Gee G-G-Giacomo!

975
01:00:13,887 --> 01:00:16,545
Shield me not, sweet Giacomo!
Our love makes me strong.

976
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:19,300
Love for a common jester.
Take the swine out and hang him!

977
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:23,809
Harm one hair of that majestic head and
I throw myself from the highest turret!

978
01:00:23,115 --> 01:00:24,880
Enough of this!

979
01:00:24,195 --> 01:00:26,782
How much insult must
I endure? Come, men.

980
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,931
Hold, Sir Griswold, your
honor will be avenged.

981
01:00:28,965 --> 01:00:29,927
How?

982
01:00:29,989 --> 01:00:33,295
Were that wretch of noble rank,
I would challenge him to combat mortal!

983
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:37,443
But I would not deign to soil my
blade with his miserable common blood!

984
01:00:37,492 --> 01:00:39,989
H-he's right, you know, sire.
Rules of chivalry, you know.

985
01:00:40,289 --> 01:00:42,324
Rules of chivalry be
hanged! And so will you.

986
01:00:42,358 --> 01:00:43,362
She'll jump...!

987
01:00:43,541 --> 01:00:44,472
Come, men.

988
01:00:44,514 --> 01:00:47,362
Hold, Sir Griswold. You will stay
until the morrow. It is my command.

989
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,188
'till the morrow, sire.
- You, Gwendolyn, to your chambers.

990
01:00:50,304 --> 01:00:52,699
Be brave, sweet Giacomo.

991
01:00:52,105 --> 01:00:54,230
Throw this blackguard in chains!

992
01:00:54,309 --> 01:00:55,315
Is he not fabulous?

993
01:00:55,393 --> 01:00:58,369
Go from plan one to plan
two without a moment's pause.

994
01:00:58,329 --> 01:01:00,387
The man is pure genius.

995
01:01:06,561 --> 01:01:08,777
Sir Griswold will never
tolerate this insult.

996
01:01:09,282 --> 01:01:11,744
M'lords, to your chambers.
Ponder this problem.

997
01:01:11,778 --> 01:01:14,269
A solution must be found ere
we meet in council, tomorrow.

998
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,487
Sire.

999
01:01:18,297 --> 01:01:21,507
Welcome, Sir Burton!
You saw the jester's performance?

1000
01:01:22,164 --> 01:01:23,994
When I sent you to
negotiate for Giacomo,

1001
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,914
I never expected results
like this! Was he not brilliant?

1002
01:01:27,106 --> 01:01:28,126
Indeed.

1003
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:30,610
With one slight discrepancy.

1004
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:32,126
This man is not Giacomo!

1005
01:01:32,784 --> 01:01:33,735
What?!

1006
01:01:33,768 --> 01:01:35,318
I know not this pretender,
but I assure you

1007
01:01:35,347 --> 01:01:38,177
he is not the Giacomo I met
and negotiated with in Europe!

1008
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:41,103
I tell you I've seen this man
before, and somehow that maid!

1009
01:01:41,146 --> 01:01:43,675
Did I tell you?
What plan now?

1010
01:01:45,318 --> 01:01:46,873
To my chambers, immediately!

1011
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:52,900
But if he's not Giacomo, who could
he be, and what does he want?

1012
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:53,534
Why would he do
our every bidding?

1013
01:01:53,568 --> 01:01:55,239
Why would he work to
destroy the alliance?

1014
01:01:55,284 --> 01:01:57,364
Why would he murder
with the cunning of a fox?

1015
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,123
A fox.

1016
01:01:59,568 --> 01:02:02,284
But of course, a fox!
A Black Fox!

1017
01:02:02,889 --> 01:02:03,826
But you don't think that...

1018
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:06,659
Why not? Who else
would oppose Griswold

1019
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:08,764
and want the alliance destroyed
but that rabble in the forest?

1020
01:02:08,824 --> 01:02:11,969
The forest. That's
where I saw him.

1021
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:12,771
Dressed as an old man,
riding out of the forest,

1022
01:02:12,806 --> 01:02:14,978
with the very wench who
sat beside the king, tonight!

1023
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:18,300
My lords... what a prize!
The Black Fox, himself!

1024
01:02:18,327 --> 01:02:19,360
Expose him! You'll
get all the credit!

1025
01:02:19,393 --> 01:02:20,936
Not so fast.

1026
01:02:22,331 --> 01:02:25,489
Not until the Fox pays
us one more service.

1027
01:02:25,222 --> 01:02:27,467
He'll rid us forever of
the barbaric Griswold!

1028
01:02:27,625 --> 01:02:29,929
Kill Griswold? But how?

1029
01:02:29,152 --> 01:02:30,804
Whose is the deadliest
blade in England?

1030
01:02:30,885 --> 01:02:33,347
Who is the only man alive who
can best Griswold in mortal combat?

1031
01:02:33,418 --> 01:02:34,208
Only the Black Fox!

1032
01:02:34,246 --> 01:02:36,414
But the Fox is a commoner
and cannot fight in tournament.

1033
01:02:36,458 --> 01:02:37,523
We shall see.

1034
01:02:38,869 --> 01:02:40,489
No, Ravenhurst,
I do not understand.

1035
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:42,978
What do you mean Griswold
himself suggested a solution?

1036
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:44,382
You yourself heard him, sire.

1037
01:02:44,414 --> 01:02:45,717
He said were the
jester of noble rank,

1038
01:02:45,757 --> 01:02:47,141
he would challenge
him to mortal combat.

1039
01:02:47,175 --> 01:02:49,737
But the jester cannot fight in
tournament! He's a commoner.

1040
01:02:49,778 --> 01:02:51,835
Then, sire,
knight the jester.

1041
01:02:52,641 --> 01:02:53,791
Knight the jester?!

1042
01:02:53,829 --> 01:02:56,228
Griswold can then challenge him for
the hand of the princess Gwendolyn,

1043
01:02:56,271 --> 01:03:00,800
and by the rules of chivalry,
she must wed the victor!

1044
01:03:00,751 --> 01:03:04,320
Knight the jester.
Sir Griswold will challenge him.

1045
01:03:04,382 --> 01:03:06,358
He dare not refuse.

1046
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:08,170
They meet at the
tournament, tomorrow,

1047
01:03:08,728 --> 01:03:11,376
Sir Griswold's  lance
runs the jester through,

1048
01:03:11,445 --> 01:03:13,688
and the marriage and
the alliance proceed.

1049
01:03:13,722 --> 01:03:16,519
Yea? Hm. Ha!
Ha! Magnificent!

1050
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:17,329
Thank you, sire.

1051
01:03:17,362 --> 01:03:20,181
But your majesty,
knighthood is an arduous ritual!

1052
01:03:20,215 --> 01:03:22,353
It will take three years
to knight the jester.

1053
01:03:22,387 --> 01:03:23,878
Three years? Nonsense!

1054
01:03:23,913 --> 01:03:25,826
Ravenhurst,
take that nincompoop,

1055
01:03:25,867 --> 01:03:28,429
and knight that nincompoop
by noon tomorrow!

1056
01:03:28,463 --> 01:03:29,737
Sire.

1057
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:33,610
By order of his
sovereign majesty,

1058
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:35,719
the jester Giacomo shall enter
upon a series of tests of manhood,

1059
01:03:35,755 --> 01:03:38,922
skill, and courage requisite to
his becoming a knight of the realm.

1060
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,538
M-me a knight? But why?

1061
01:03:40,574 --> 01:03:42,769
To make you eligible for the
hand of the princess Gwendolyn.

1062
01:03:43,239 --> 01:03:44,565
M-marry the princess? W-when?

1063
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:46,152
Upon your passing
each and every test.

1064
01:03:46,186 --> 01:03:47,309
Oh! Well that's different.

1065
01:03:47,344 --> 01:03:49,625
It takes four or five years
to become a knight, doesn't it?

1066
01:03:49,657 --> 01:03:51,351
We shall see.
Let the tests begin!

1067
01:03:51,623 --> 01:03:54,101
Uh, w-wait! What's
the hurry? I- b- ch-

1068
01:03:55,539 --> 01:03:58,266
He must scale a stone
wall in full armor!

1069
01:04:03,909 --> 01:04:05,420
Candidate passes!

1070
01:04:06,197 --> 01:04:07,333
Uh, b- buh... I didn't...!

1071
01:04:07,367 --> 01:04:09,637
With long bow, he must
slay a hawk in full flight!

1072
01:04:14,114 --> 01:04:14,989
He passes!

1073
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,153
But I didn't even shoot...

1074
01:04:16,181 --> 01:04:17,306
The candidate passes!

1075
01:04:17,342 --> 01:04:19,541
But I didn't even shoot
the arrow! The arrow...

1076
01:04:19,547 --> 01:04:20,813
I- I didn't pass...!

1077
01:04:21,831 --> 01:04:25,143
The candidate must conquer
a wild boar with his bare hands!

1078
01:04:25,309 --> 01:04:26,813
Release the boar!

1079
01:04:34,972 --> 01:04:36,306
He passes!

1080
01:04:42,853 --> 01:04:44,248
No one enters by
the king's command!

1081
01:04:45,309 --> 01:04:47,552
But this is the
king's command.

1082
01:04:56,188 --> 01:05:00,420
Ah, maid Jean. Welcome.
What brings you here at this hour?

1083
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,523
Concern for you, sire. - Mm?

1084
01:05:02,557 --> 01:05:04,838
You were so distressed last evening,

1085
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:07,786
that I thought perhaps
I could comfort you,

1086
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,505
ease the burdens of state.

1087
01:05:10,818 --> 01:05:13,715
Eh, don't tug it, idiot! Well that's
very considerate of you, my dear.

1088
01:05:13,728 --> 01:05:15,802
I shall take advantage
of your delightful offer...

1089
01:05:15,911 --> 01:05:17,409
perhaps this evening?

1090
01:05:17,456 --> 01:05:18,563
Why tarry, sire?

1091
01:05:18,701 --> 01:05:21,552
I am most accomplished
on matters of appearance,

1092
01:05:21,777 --> 01:05:26,978
and would gladly free these young men
for more important chores, elsewhere.

1093
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:29,490
Well that's very
kind of you, but...

1094
01:05:32,168 --> 01:05:34,349
oh, yes. Pages,

1095
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:37,737
I'm sure you have some very
important business to attend.

1096
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:42,853
Now, then, sire, we have to
get you ready for the ceremony!

1097
01:05:42,889 --> 01:05:44,760
Ah, but my dear...
- Now there.

1098
01:05:45,135 --> 01:05:47,795
You can't imagine my feelings,

1099
01:05:47,842 --> 01:05:52,387
when I touch the head of a man
who calles himself the king of England.

1100
01:05:52,762 --> 01:05:56,992
Who IS the King of England!
And very handsome, too, sire.

1101
01:05:57,152 --> 01:06:00,900
On the day of your first
tournament. There you are.

1102
01:06:00,994 --> 01:06:02,135
Where?

1103
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:03,139
Now I must go, sire.

1104
01:06:03,177 --> 01:06:04,869
Oh, now wait, dear, wait.

1105
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:05,853
Oh, no, you have to
get to your ceremony!

1106
01:06:05,891 --> 01:06:09,204
But there's no hurry. We can't
start until the jester's been made ready.

1107
01:06:09,268 --> 01:06:10,219
The jester?!

1108
01:06:10,253 --> 01:06:12,137
Yes, haven't you heard?
We're knighting the poor fool.

1109
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:13,489
Knighting the jester!

1110
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:14,922
Yes, you'd
never guess why.

1111
01:06:14,978 --> 01:06:16,449
So that he can
marry the princess.

1112
01:06:16,481 --> 01:06:18,730
Well, that's the fool thinks,
but the moment I dub him knight,

1113
01:06:18,773 --> 01:06:20,807
Griswold will challenge him
for the hand of my daughter.

1114
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:21,769
Mortal combat.

1115
01:06:21,809 --> 01:06:24,413
Yes, isn't it delicious?
He dare not refuse,

1116
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:27,873
they meet at lists, and Sir Griswold's
lance runs the jester through,

1117
01:06:27,916 --> 01:06:30,182
as a fitting climax
to a glorious day.

1118
01:06:30,262 --> 01:06:33,195
Oh, my dear, you are a
delicate, lovely creature.

1119
01:06:33,454 --> 01:06:36,496
Tell me, does it bother you that I
may be a few years your senior?

1120
01:06:36,543 --> 01:06:38,364
Oh, no, sire, not really.

1121
01:06:38,467 --> 01:06:43,179
In fact, you remind me so much of my
dear and recently departed father.

1122
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:43,927
Oh, your father, yes.

1123
01:06:43,961 --> 01:06:46,880
Well, was he a handsome figure
of a man? Dashing, effective...

1124
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:49,704
Oh, yes, sire, 'till the scourge
brought about his untimely end.

1125
01:06:49,769 --> 01:06:51,646
Eh, come here, my dear.
- What a horrible death!

1126
01:06:51,684 --> 01:06:52,666
A little closer...

1127
01:06:52,704 --> 01:06:55,777
I can see him now, writhing
on the floor in agony,

1128
01:06:55,813 --> 01:06:59,302
like so many of his brothers and
cousins and uncles and aunts...

1129
01:06:59,342 --> 01:07:00,889
Yes. Would you grant
the king a little kiss?

1130
01:07:00,931 --> 01:07:04,893
Oh, certainly, sire, and don't
worry. They say it isn't catching.

1131
01:07:04,931 --> 01:07:07,380
Oh, you are a little...

1132
01:07:08,219 --> 01:07:09,177
catching?

1133
01:07:09,469 --> 01:07:13,347
Just because it runs in the family
doesn't mean that everyone has it.

1134
01:07:13,385 --> 01:07:14,311
Kiss me sire!

1135
01:07:14,349 --> 01:07:15,849
Has it? Has what?

1136
01:07:15,894 --> 01:07:17,101
Don't I please you, sire?

1137
01:07:17,135 --> 01:07:20,135
Oh, yes, yes, but, eh, these
brothers and cousins and uncles...

1138
01:07:20,168 --> 01:07:24,425
And aunts. Let us not talk about
their swollen, twisted, pain ridden bodies.

1139
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:27,164
Hold me, take me in your
arms, tell me I am yours!

1140
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:29,289
But this, this uh
writhing on the floor...

1141
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:30,206
In agony.

1142
01:07:30,242 --> 01:07:32,356
Yes, wh-what's... how
does one catch this thing?

1143
01:07:32,409 --> 01:07:34,489
Oh, the touch of a hand,
the brush of a lip...

1144
01:07:34,521 --> 01:07:38,298
but let us not spoil this moment,
sire! Hold me, hold me close!

1145
01:07:38,355 --> 01:07:40,429
W-what's this
monstrous thing called?

1146
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:41,550
Breckenridge's scourge.

1147
01:07:41,907 --> 01:07:43,224
Who's Breckenridge?

1148
01:07:43,335 --> 01:07:44,570
My father.

1149
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:49,519
Excuse me, dear, I'm
feeling rather poorly.

1150
01:07:49,764 --> 01:07:51,202
Sire, the ceremony is ready.

1151
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:55,286
Oh, very well. Ah, I must go, now,
my dear, and so must- so must you.

1152
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:56,713
Quickly.

1153
01:07:56,954 --> 01:07:58,858
Dear... don't touch me.

1154
01:08:15,244 --> 01:08:16,163
Where's the jester?

1155
01:08:16,195 --> 01:08:17,755
Did you get the key?
- Yes, here it is.

1156
01:08:17,789 --> 01:08:19,725
It must be sent by pigeon
to the Black Fox at once!

1157
01:08:19,761 --> 01:08:22,371
Let the jester take it and
escape. They plan to kill him.

1158
01:08:22,405 --> 01:08:25,898
It'd never there in time.
The bird's our only chance.

1159
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:58,662
He who approacheth, deem you
him worthy of noble knighthood?

1160
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:02,125
Yea, verily, yea!

1161
01:09:03,234 --> 01:09:04,578
How many more
before the jester?

1162
01:09:04,636 --> 01:09:05,713
Just this one, sire.

1163
01:09:05,935 --> 01:09:11,288
...Fealty, loyalty, moisten his
lips with the vigorous wine.

1164
01:09:11,604 --> 01:09:17,262
Yea, verily, yea!

1165
01:09:19,926 --> 01:09:23,810
Now as the symbol
of honor and dignity,

1166
01:09:23,978 --> 01:09:28,229
let us beplume him
and helmet his brow.

1167
01:09:28,435 --> 01:09:31,402
Yea, verily, yea!

1168
01:09:33,105 --> 01:09:35,292
Sire, this storm bodes ill.

1169
01:09:35,328 --> 01:09:37,333
It might drench the field
and delay the tournament.

1170
01:09:37,365 --> 01:09:40,680
Fetch the jester and run him through
the ritual as quickly as possible.

1171
01:09:40,101 --> 01:09:41,106
But sire, custom...

1172
01:09:41,145 --> 01:09:43,865
Custom be hanged! Fetch
him and run him through!

1173
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:51,171
A message for the
jester. From the king.

1174
01:10:00,855 --> 01:10:03,600
He requests you
do this at once.

1175
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:04,724
At w-once.

1176
01:10:33,274 --> 01:10:39,279
He who approacheth, deem you
him ready for noble knighthood.

1177
01:10:39,426 --> 01:10:41,779
Yea! - Y-yea.

1178
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:45,273
Hath he passed all test of valor?

1179
01:10:45,809 --> 01:10:48,595
Yea, verily, yea!

1180
01:10:49,242 --> 01:10:52,831
Now doth he flower with true nobility?

1181
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:56,336
Yea, verily, yea!

1182
01:10:56,966 --> 01:11:00,859
Reveal him now to his sovereign liege.

1183
01:11:00,739 --> 01:11:04,145
Yea, verily, yea! Yea?

1184
01:11:04,181 --> 01:11:05,655
Faster. - Faster.
- Faster.

1185
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:10,395
B-but I!

1186
01:11:10,445 --> 01:11:12,784
...Fealty, loyalty, moisten his
lips with the vigorous wine.

1187
01:11:14,811 --> 01:11:16,603
Now  will he pledge to his
fealty, loyalty, courage,

1188
01:11:16,644 --> 01:11:18,368
and vigor and valor
and strength! - Yea!

1189
01:11:18,554 --> 01:11:21,453
Now as the symbol of honor and dignity,
let us beplume him and helmet his brow.

1190
01:11:21,649 --> 01:11:24,108
Yea, verily, yea!
Yea, verily, yea!

1191
01:11:24,323 --> 01:11:26,710
He who is girded and
plumed and helmeted,

1192
01:11:26,104 --> 01:11:27,847
Let him prepare...

1193
01:13:01,579 --> 01:13:03,373
Considering the virtuous
fidelity you have shown,

1194
01:13:03,408 --> 01:13:05,375
and the honorable exploits
that you have done,

1195
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:08,587
having given proof of that honor,
having given proof of that honor...

1196
01:13:08,791 --> 01:13:11,385
as always as is the part of
a good and faithful subject,

1197
01:13:11,418 --> 01:13:13,832
I hereby dub thee
knight of the realm,

1198
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:16,122
defender of the soil,
protector of the crown,

1199
01:13:16,175 --> 01:13:19,960
and a fit consort for the
princess Gwendolyn the fair.

1200
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:21,829
Arise, Sir Giacomo.

1201
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:25,250
Now, if  any knight present
objects to this marriage,

1202
01:13:25,283 --> 01:13:28,984
let him now step forward
or forever hold his tongue.

1203
01:13:30,797 --> 01:13:32,210
I.

1204
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:35,132
I, Griswold of Mackalwane
do so object.

1205
01:13:35,167 --> 01:13:36,869
Very good,
'dya hear that, sire?

1206
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:38,238
I too love the princess and
would fight for her heart.

1207
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,430
I hereby challenge in
mortal combat Giacomo!

1208
01:13:40,462 --> 01:13:44,932
Giacomo! Knight of the
realm! Defender of the soil!

1209
01:13:44,961 --> 01:13:46,805
And protector of the crown!

1210
01:13:46,838 --> 01:13:47,944
Woo!

1211
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,895
You won't have to fight,
I'll send a message,

1212
01:13:52,951 --> 01:13:54,729
the Black Fox will come
and fight in your place!

1213
01:13:54,769 --> 01:13:55,662
The Black Fox?

1214
01:13:55,713 --> 01:13:57,921
Get up, accept
the challenge!

1215
01:14:01,698 --> 01:14:04,944
Uh... Black Fox,
huh? Eh...

1216
01:14:04,978 --> 01:14:07,215
he'll come and fight
in my place? - Yes.

1217
01:14:08,676 --> 01:14:09,992
You're sure he'll come?

1218
01:14:12,328 --> 01:14:15,510
Well, if it's mortal combat you want,
then mortal combat you shall have,

1219
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:18,755
and at the hands of Giacomo,
knight of the realm,

1220
01:14:18,792 --> 01:14:21,261
defender of the soil,
protector of the crown...

1221
01:14:22,274 --> 01:14:23,782
protector of the crown!

1222
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:24,930
Oo, oh.

1223
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:29,929
Good stock.
Good battle. Good bye!

1224
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:35,400
Your escorts to see
you safely to the lists.

1225
01:14:36,324 --> 01:14:37,617
The the lists?

1226
01:14:42,314 --> 01:14:43,773
Very clever, father.

1227
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,591
Well, chivalry is
chivalry, you know.

1228
01:14:45,737 --> 01:14:47,479
Yes, I know.

1229
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:48,497
May the best man win.

1230
01:14:52,779 --> 01:14:56,317
Remember this..
if he dies, you die.

1231
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:05,591
To the Fox, at once!

1232
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:17,953
We have bigger game.

1233
01:15:22,462 --> 01:15:23,787
Get him!

1234
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:31,636
Griswold has challenged the
jester to mortal combat.

1235
01:15:31,670 --> 01:15:32,561
The jester! - Yes

1236
01:15:32,587 --> 01:15:35,295
The maid Jean requests that
you come and fight in his stead.

1237
01:15:37,753 --> 01:15:40,125
The timbers have fallen and
great rocks block the passage!

1238
01:15:40,181 --> 01:15:41,807
Can it be cleared?
- Impossible!

1239
01:15:41,842 --> 01:15:43,698
With no passage, we
can make no diversion,

1240
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:45,609
and with no
diversion, no attack!

1241
01:15:45,664 --> 01:15:47,899
Is there any opening?

1242
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:49,582
No more than that, sir.
Barely enough for a child!

1243
01:15:49,603 --> 01:15:51,811
A child, a child...

1244
01:15:51,846 --> 01:15:54,431
or perhaps...! My horse!

1245
01:15:54,436 --> 01:15:55,613
Where go you?
To save Hawkins?

1246
01:15:55,645 --> 01:15:56,904
No, to save England!

1247
01:15:56,945 --> 01:15:57,981
Then Hawkins must die!

1248
01:15:58,239 --> 01:15:59,804
Yes. But if my plan succeeds,

1249
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:03,630
I assure you, Hubert Hawkins
will not have died in vain!

1250
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:21,578
By order of his sovereign lord
highness, King Roderick the First,

1251
01:16:22,349 --> 01:16:25,260
this royal tournament
is officially begun!

1252
01:16:25,521 --> 01:16:27,399
Where's the Black Fox
What's delayed him?

1253
01:16:27,399 --> 01:16:29,797
There's rain in the hills,
perhaps the river is swollen.

1254
01:16:29,832 --> 01:16:32,695
He'll be taking the coast road.
You better have a look.

1255
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:38,676
Good stock.

1256
01:16:40,279 --> 01:16:42,836
The first contest will be
a battle to the death

1257
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:44,792
for the hand of
the fair Gwendolyn.

1258
01:16:44,815 --> 01:16:49,215
It will be fought by Sir Griswold of
Mackalwane and Sir Giacomo of Italy.

1259
01:16:49,773 --> 01:16:52,568
These two bold knights
will choose weapons,

1260
01:16:52,569 --> 01:16:54,408
and enter upon
the field of honor,

1261
01:16:54,545 --> 01:16:58,859
and fight in mortal combat
until one of them lies dead.

1262
01:16:58,896 --> 01:17:00,131
Run for your life.

1263
01:17:00,322 --> 01:17:03,819
No, they'd... they'd only
catch me and kill me.

1264
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:04,659
Can you ever forgive me?

1265
01:17:04,863 --> 01:17:06,542
There's nothing to forgive.

1266
01:17:07,305 --> 01:17:08,505
Dear Hawkins.

1267
01:17:08,538 --> 01:17:10,622
Sir Giacomo! You
should be in armor!

1268
01:17:10,688 --> 01:17:12,581
And you, maid
Jean, in the stands.

1269
01:17:12,698 --> 01:17:15,462
If I die, just pray
that I die bravely.

1270
01:17:15,494 --> 01:17:17,536
You'll not die, you'll
not have to fight him.

1271
01:17:17,537 --> 01:17:19,338
Griswold dies as
he drinks the toast.

1272
01:17:19,372 --> 01:17:20,377
What?

1273
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:23,479
Listen. I have put a pellet of
poison in one of the vessels.

1274
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:25,154
Which one? - The one with
the figure of a pestle.

1275
01:17:25,188 --> 01:17:26,439
The vessel with
the pestle? - Yes.

1276
01:17:26,502 --> 01:17:27,972
But you don't want the
vessel with the pestle,

1277
01:17:28,699 --> 01:17:29,564
you want the chalice
from the palace!

1278
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,753
I-I don't want the
vessel with the pestle,

1279
01:17:30,787 --> 01:17:31,792
I want the chalice
from the what?

1280
01:17:31,826 --> 01:17:32,960
The chalice from the palace!

1281
01:17:32,993 --> 01:17:35,177
It's a little crystal chalice
with a figure of a palace.

1282
01:17:35,216 --> 01:17:36,796
Th-the chalice from the palace
have the pellet with the poison?

1283
01:17:36,829 --> 01:17:38,533
No, the pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle.

1284
01:17:38,573 --> 01:17:39,529
Oh, oh, the pestle
with the vessel.

1285
01:17:39,564 --> 01:17:40,537
The vessel with the pestle.

1286
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:41,685
What about the palace
from the chalice?

1287
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:44,180
Not the palace from the chalice!
The chalice from the palace!

1288
01:17:44,215 --> 01:17:45,217
Where's the pellet
with the poison?

1289
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:46,354
In the vessel with the pestle!

1290
01:17:46,386 --> 01:17:48,960
Don't you see? The pellet with the
poison's in the vessel with the pestle.

1291
01:17:48,993 --> 01:17:51,170
The chalice from the palace
has the brew that is true!

1292
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:52,185
It's so easy, I can say it!

1293
01:17:52,225 --> 01:17:53,206
Well then you fight him!

1294
01:17:53,246 --> 01:17:54,503
Listen carefully.

1295
01:17:54,658 --> 01:17:56,564
The pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle,

1296
01:17:56,604 --> 01:17:58,796
the chalice from the palace
has the brew that is true.

1297
01:17:58,832 --> 01:18:00,878
Where the pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle,

1298
01:18:00,912 --> 01:18:02,639
the chalice from the palace
has the brew that is true.

1299
01:18:02,673 --> 01:18:04,359
Good man!
- Just remember that.

1300
01:18:04,451 --> 01:18:05,657
Sir Giacomo!

1301
01:18:05,670 --> 01:18:07,175
Sir Giacomo, into your armor!

1302
01:18:07,207 --> 01:18:08,729
And you, to your
place in the pavilion.

1303
01:18:12,627 --> 01:18:13,836
The pellet with the poison...

1304
01:18:14,408 --> 01:18:16,177
the pellet with the poison is
in the vessel with the pestle,

1305
01:18:16,212 --> 01:18:18,930
the chalice from the palace
has the true that is brew. Eh...

1306
01:18:19,123 --> 01:18:20,398
brew that is tru-

1307
01:18:20,965 --> 01:18:23,243
The pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle,

1308
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:26,659
the chalice from the palace
has the true that is brew.

1309
01:18:26,185 --> 01:18:27,829
Eh, brew that is true. Eh.

1310
01:18:27,863 --> 01:18:30,265
The chestle with the pal- eh,
eh, palace with the...

1311
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:31,447
Look out!

1312
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:39,556
Hurry, now, get
into your armor!

1313
01:18:40,448 --> 01:18:41,625
The pestle with t...

1314
01:18:41,935 --> 01:18:44,149
the pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle,

1315
01:18:44,208 --> 01:18:46,341
the palace from the chalice
has the brew that is blue.

1316
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:47,679
Eh, no...

1317
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:50,579
The pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle.

1318
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:53,908
The cha- eh, the
pellet with the plip...

1319
01:18:54,649 --> 01:18:56,654
the pellet with the poisle's in
the vessel with the plazzle.

1320
01:18:56,739 --> 01:18:59,640
Eh, the plazzle with the
vlessle. Eh, the the bless...

1321
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:02,351
The vessel with the plozle
is the plazzle with the...

1322
01:19:02,385 --> 01:19:03,824
Come along, Sir Giacomo.
His majesty is waiting.

1323
01:19:03,859 --> 01:19:05,207
The pestle with the poilet...

1324
01:19:05,229 --> 01:19:07,141
And take your helmet!

1325
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:09,252
Thank you.

1326
01:19:11,756 --> 01:19:15,409
The pellet with the poisley's
from chalice with the pazley.

1327
01:19:18,302 --> 01:19:20,298
Oh, hello, my dear,
it's nice to see y-

1328
01:19:26,619 --> 01:19:28,868
I've got it!
I've got it.

1329
01:19:28,898 --> 01:19:30,466
The pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle,

1330
01:19:30,501 --> 01:19:32,510
the chalice from the palace has
the brew that is true, right?

1331
01:19:32,554 --> 01:19:34,423
Right. But there's
been a change.

1332
01:19:34,461 --> 01:19:36,292
They broke the chalice
from the palace.

1333
01:19:36,386 --> 01:19:38,224
They broke the chalice
from the palace?

1334
01:19:38,261 --> 01:19:39,479
And replaced it with a flagon.

1335
01:19:39,523 --> 01:19:41,960
Flagon.
- With a figure of a dragon.

1336
01:19:41,103 --> 01:19:42,380
Flagon with a
dragon. - Right.

1337
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:44,862
Did you put the pellet with the
poison in the vessel with the pestle?

1338
01:19:44,902 --> 01:19:47,445
No! The pellet with the poison's
in the flagon with the dragon,

1339
01:19:47,479 --> 01:19:49,463
the vessel with the pestle
has the brew that is true!

1340
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:51,810
The pellet with the poison's
in the flagon with the dragon,

1341
01:19:51,115 --> 01:19:52,636
the vessel with the pestle
has the brew that is true.

1342
01:19:52,672 --> 01:19:53,573
Just remember that.

1343
01:19:53,618 --> 01:19:56,136
Yes, thank you very much.
The pellet with the chasley,

1344
01:19:56,282 --> 01:19:59,275
eh... the pellet with the poison is
in the pasley with the chazzle.

1345
01:19:59,328 --> 01:20:01,300
Eh, just remember that.

1346
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,614
Beware of the drinks.
One of them is poisoned.

1347
01:20:04,649 --> 01:20:05,831
Poisoned! Are you sure?

1348
01:20:05,864 --> 01:20:06,880
I heard the witch.

1349
01:20:06,918 --> 01:20:08,998
The poisel with the
plesley is the chaz... eh...

1350
01:20:09,329 --> 01:20:11,300
The pellet with the poison's
in the flagon with the dragon,

1351
01:20:11,332 --> 01:20:12,527
the pestle with the pizzle...

1352
01:20:12,578 --> 01:20:14,750
the pizzle with the f- the,
the, the viss... - No, no, no...

1353
01:20:14,783 --> 01:20:17,953
The pellet with the poisley
is the chalice with the... he he

1354
01:20:19,432 --> 01:20:20,457
...Vessel with the pestle.

1355
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:22,850
The vessel with the pestle
has the brew that is true.

1356
01:20:22,912 --> 01:20:24,378
Right. Don't forget it.

1357
01:20:24,596 --> 01:20:26,826
The palace with the
dragon... no, no, no.

1358
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:29,260
The knights will
approach each other!

1359
01:20:32,671 --> 01:20:35,542
The pellet with the poisle is
in the flaggle with the chalice.

1360
01:20:35,576 --> 01:20:37,613
The poison's in the
dragon with the pestle.

1361
01:20:37,654 --> 01:20:41,677
Eh, ah, the chazzle is in the poisley
with the plellice with the plan- eh, plaglice.

1362
01:20:41,715 --> 01:20:43,850
The pellet with the dragon's
in the pestle with the poi-

1363
01:20:43,885 --> 01:20:45,329
The pezley with the poisle is...

1364
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:46,962
The dragon with the
poisle's in the pestle...

1365
01:20:46,997 --> 01:20:47,967
Pazzle with the fleegle...

1366
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:49,921
The poisley with the plazzle
is the plazzle with the ploizle

1367
01:20:49,957 --> 01:20:52,106
The chalice with the pa...
the flagon with the cha...

1368
01:20:52,155 --> 01:20:54,559
the floizle with the flagon is
the chalice with the poison.

1369
01:20:54,628 --> 01:20:56,948
The knights will face the king!

1370
01:21:04,269 --> 01:21:06,747
They will approach
the royal pavilion!

1371
01:21:14,346 --> 01:21:17,387
The pellet with the poison's
in the flagon with the dragon!

1372
01:21:17,431 --> 01:21:20,761
The vessel with the pestle
has the brew that is true!

1373
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:22,569
Oh, no, pglk, you've
got the wrong one!

1374
01:21:23,569 --> 01:21:25,407
Stop this mockery!
There will be no toast!

1375
01:21:25,578 --> 01:21:28,497
Put them to horse, let them
choose weapons, and fight!

1376
01:21:28,998 --> 01:21:30,497
This is the Black Fox?

1377
01:21:30,667 --> 01:21:32,697
And still playing the fool.

1378
01:21:44,717 --> 01:21:47,417
Sir Griswold! Declare
a choice of weapon!

1379
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:49,699
Mace and chain!

1380
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:52,167
Sir Giacomo! Declare
a choice of weapon.

1381
01:21:54,253 --> 01:21:56,507
I'll take one of those,
one of those,

1382
01:21:56,606 --> 01:21:58,789
eh, a couple of
those.. and..

1383
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:02,155
I better take them all.

1384
01:22:02,730 --> 01:22:05,180
Mace and chain
for him, too!

1385
01:22:06,356 --> 01:22:07,842
Charge!

1386
01:22:19,457 --> 01:22:22,644
Take that horse and put
it back under that idiot!

1387
01:22:23,659 --> 01:22:25,122
Unfasten that perch!

1388
01:22:26,114 --> 01:22:27,702
Charge!

1389
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:56,823
All right, Sir Griswold,
prepare to die!

1390
01:23:56,859 --> 01:24:01,475
Go ahead, sir knight. Slay me!
You won in fair combat. Strike!

1391
01:24:01,515 --> 01:24:06,529
Let rivers of blood wash away
the stain of my disgrace! Go on!

1392
01:24:06,105 --> 01:24:08,737
Spew the field with
my dishonored guts!

1393
01:24:10,146 --> 01:24:11,314
No!

1394
01:24:12,721 --> 01:24:15,188
No, I cannot slay a
man whose only crime,

1395
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:18,322
is that he loved not
too wisely but too well.

1396
01:24:18,417 --> 01:24:22,229
I grant your life!
Take your men, and go!

1397
01:24:28,739 --> 01:24:29,344
Fergus is dead.

1398
01:24:29,407 --> 01:24:30,911
Did he talk?

1399
01:24:31,925 --> 01:24:34,154
The child?
In the castle?

1400
01:24:35,247 --> 01:24:37,331
Now listen carefully,
there's little time...

1401
01:24:52,377 --> 01:24:56,600
Sir Giacomo, I declare
you winner of this combat,

1402
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,569
and I hereby decree that you
shall marry the Princess Gwendolyn.

1403
01:25:00,608 --> 01:25:03,250
Hold, sire!
Seize this traitor!

1404
01:25:03,609 --> 01:25:05,135
Traitor? What's this?
How say you, Ravenhurst?

1405
01:25:05,172 --> 01:25:06,645
I say traitor, sire!

1406
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:08,984
And I shall prove to you that
this man who stands before us,

1407
01:25:09,189 --> 01:25:11,712
is neither Giacomo nor jester,
but your deadly enemy,

1408
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:14,180
the leader of the rabble who
have sworn to have your head,

1409
01:25:14,779 --> 01:25:15,176
the Black Fox himself!

1410
01:25:15,231 --> 01:25:16,595
The Black Fox?

1411
01:25:16,654 --> 01:25:20,411
And this demure maid
his foul accomplice!

1412
01:25:20,444 --> 01:25:23,135
Ravenhurst, are you mad? Have
you proof of this foul treachery?

1413
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:24,101
I have, sire.

1414
01:25:24,136 --> 01:25:26,354
Then repair to the court!
Summon the judges!

1415
01:25:26,394 --> 01:25:27,734
If what you say be true,

1416
01:25:27,783 --> 01:25:31,279
the headsman's axe will not only
rid us of this jabbering popinjay,

1417
01:25:31,551 --> 01:25:33,827
but will sever this
lovely little head,

1418
01:25:34,506 --> 01:25:36,409
from this delicate little neck..

1419
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,617
oh. To the castle!

1420
01:25:43,850 --> 01:25:45,695
Hurry along, little friends.

1421
01:25:46,457 --> 01:25:48,965
Hurry along!
Keep your heads down.

1422
01:25:49,988 --> 01:25:52,161
Come along, there,
men! All of you!

1423
01:25:52,215 --> 01:25:55,421
We'll take the coast road,
but stay close to the trees!

1424
01:25:58,891 --> 01:26:01,519
And I say again,
sire! Never, sire,

1425
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,528
never was there
such infamous treason.

1426
01:26:03,729 --> 01:26:05,725
Not only is this
man the Black Fox,

1427
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:09,868
but he and his despicable accomplice,
have the shameful effrontery,

1428
01:26:09,962 --> 01:26:12,713
to shelter in this castle,
the miserable child,

1429
01:26:12,752 --> 01:26:14,707
they would put on
your very throne!

1430
01:26:14,743 --> 01:26:17,899
What's this?
What say you, Ravenhurst?

1431
01:26:17,277 --> 01:26:20,161
I repeat, sire. The child they
would put on your throne.

1432
01:26:20,244 --> 01:26:22,131
The child...

1433
01:26:22,448 --> 01:26:23,797
with the purple pimpernel?

1434
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:27,190
The very same, sire.
Bring forth the basket!

1435
01:26:27,298 --> 01:26:29,556
Let me see this
fraud, this charlatan.

1436
01:26:30,190 --> 01:26:32,600
Hurry up, hurry up,
bring it here.

1437
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:33,796
In a moment, sire.

1438
01:26:33,831 --> 01:26:37,828
But first let me hear you pronounce
sentence on this unholy pair.

1439
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:42,309
I know how anxious you are to
dispose of this villainous scum,

1440
01:26:42,354 --> 01:26:45,890
so that you may proceed
with the feast and the revelry.

1441
01:26:45,136 --> 01:26:47,497
Sire, I accuse these impostors

1442
01:26:47,537 --> 01:26:50,485
of the foulest and most loathsome
crime against the crown,

1443
01:26:50,521 --> 01:26:51,988
and I demand,

1444
01:26:52,329 --> 01:26:54,596
that they be given the full
measure of your righteous wrath,

1445
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:57,828
and shall be disposed of
before another hour is past.

1446
01:26:58,167 --> 01:27:03,710
I tell you, sire, the headsman's axe is
too kind a fate for these foul traitors.

1447
01:27:03,198 --> 01:27:06,472
They should be put on a spit,
and roasted like yon boar!

1448
01:27:06,518 --> 01:27:08,569
Yes, yes, death
to both of them.

1449
01:27:08,676 --> 01:27:11,250
Father, I say
Ravenhurst lies.

1450
01:27:11,649 --> 01:27:14,435
This is Giacomo, king of jesters,
and never the Black Fox.

1451
01:27:14,671 --> 01:27:17,936
Nay, fair lady. For once,
Ravenhurst is right.

1452
01:27:17,981 --> 01:27:20,806
I am. I am the
Black Fox!

1453
01:27:33,345 --> 01:27:34,918
Seize that traitor!

1454
01:27:48,265 --> 01:27:51,583
Ravenhurst! Ravenhurst!
Do something! Do something!

1455
01:27:56,529 --> 01:27:58,923
Quickly, fetch Griswold!
Bring him back!

1456
01:28:37,622 --> 01:28:39,770
Take him to safety!

1457
01:29:09,782 --> 01:29:12,220
Arm him. I must
raise the gate!

1458
01:29:41,387 --> 01:29:42,983
Quick, Lower the gate!

1459
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:45,688
The gate is lowered!
- No it isn't! Look!

1460
01:30:52,122 --> 01:30:54,613
If he dies, you die.

1461
01:31:05,779 --> 01:31:08,376
Tails of lizards, ears of swine,
chicken gizzard soaked in brine,

1462
01:31:08,417 --> 01:31:12,506
on your feet, be not afraid,
you're the greatest with a blade!

1463
01:31:29,791 --> 01:31:31,595
Heh heh.

1464
01:31:34,130 --> 01:31:35,270
Hey!

1465
01:31:49,990 --> 01:31:52,296
Play games with the
Black Fox, will you?

1466
01:31:52,345 --> 01:31:54,403
At this very moment,
my dear Ravenhurst,

1467
01:31:54,445 --> 01:31:58,829
your life isn't worth that!

1468
01:32:11,529 --> 01:32:14,832
Now my gallant fox, we'll see
whose life isn't worth that!

1469
01:32:15,778 --> 01:32:17,594
We shall, indeed! Hey ya!

1470
01:32:33,224 --> 01:32:34,948
With your permission?

1471
01:32:34,983 --> 01:32:37,231
Why you swine...

1472
01:32:41,550 --> 01:32:42,497
Your health.

1473
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:44,679
Oo, you...

1474
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:51,356
And now, Ravenhurst,
you rat catcher!

1475
01:33:15,899 --> 01:33:18,912
Well, my dear Ravenhurst,
our little game draws to an end.

1476
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:22,806
I have toyed with you
long enough. You shall die.

1477
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:25,510
And die like that! Ehh!

1478
01:34:12,456 --> 01:34:14,608
Hurry! Help the Fox!

1479
01:34:15,801 --> 01:34:18,162
Jean. - Oh! Hawkins,
are you all right?

1480
01:34:18,195 --> 01:34:19,515
Never mind me.
Where's the child?

1481
01:34:19,556 --> 01:34:21,127
Safe. -Good.

1482
01:34:21,266 --> 01:34:23,439
You've been wonderful.

1483
01:34:23,601 --> 01:34:26,653
How convenient.
The Fox and his mate!

1484
01:34:26,712 --> 01:34:30,680
So my friends, the tables
have turned yet again.

1485
01:34:30,101 --> 01:34:31,929
But this time for
the last time,

1486
01:34:32,930 --> 01:34:36,597
and not only for one, but
for two! What a prize!

1487
01:34:50,117 --> 01:34:51,826
Griswold!

1488
01:34:52,939 --> 01:34:55,439
They'll cut us to
ribbons. We've lost.

1489
01:34:55,667 --> 01:34:57,551
Hold there! Hold!

1490
01:34:57,905 --> 01:35:02,449
Let no more English blood
be spilled! Victory is ours!

1491
01:35:03,451 --> 01:35:07,503
Not so fast! Unhand
the king, and surrender!

1492
01:35:07,608 --> 01:35:11,475
Never! - Then die as
traitors to the crown!

1493
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:16,618
Hold, Sir Griswold!
Hold your men!

1494
01:35:20,557 --> 01:35:23,668
Sir Griswold, I speak to
you as knight to knight.

1495
01:35:23,719 --> 01:35:25,572
When you were dubbed,
you pledged your hand,

1496
01:35:25,608 --> 01:35:29,630
your heart and your sword to
defend the true king of England.

1497
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,168
Is that right? - Well?

1498
01:35:31,636 --> 01:35:33,146
This man is not
the true king.

1499
01:35:33,284 --> 01:35:35,851
He has usurped the throne
from the legitimate heir.

1500
01:35:35,894 --> 01:35:37,431
Heir? What heir?

1501
01:35:37,457 --> 01:35:39,698
He who bears the mark
of the royal bloodline.

1502
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:41,279
The purple pimpernel!

1503
01:35:41,313 --> 01:35:42,597
- The purple pimpernel?

1504
01:35:42,622 --> 01:35:46,404
That's balderdash.
No such person exists!

1505
01:36:06,829 --> 01:36:07,761
Your majesty!

1506
01:36:12,578 --> 01:36:14,256
Your majesty!

1507
01:36:18,125 --> 01:36:19,853
Your majesty!

1508
01:36:21,510 --> 01:36:23,188
Your majesty!

1509
01:36:28,313 --> 01:36:33,528
The real king is on the throne,
Jean is my very own,

1510
01:36:34,844 --> 01:36:37,600
and life couldn't possibly,

1511
01:36:37,350 --> 01:36:39,649
not even probably,

1512
01:36:40,270 --> 01:36:45,944
life couldn't possibly better

1513
01:36:46,268 --> 01:36:48,720
be!
