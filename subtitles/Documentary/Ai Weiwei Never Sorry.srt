1
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:10,629
(Episode 99)

2
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:16,478
Is that how you greet your superior?

3
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:24,744
I'm sorry, sir.

4
00:00:25,744 --> 00:00:27,214
Hand me your phone.

5
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:34,644
My phone?

6
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:37,744
It'll let me know why you
really came to work here.

7
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:41,774
Going through my phone is
an invasion of privacy.

8
00:00:42,244 --> 00:00:43,844
I only need to check one thing.

9
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,414
I believe you have Jeon
Byung Soo's number...

10
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:50,414
and something else that I don't know about.

11
00:00:51,114 --> 00:00:53,950
If that's the case, I really
shouldn't show it to you.

12
00:00:53,974 --> 00:00:55,114
Is that so?

13
00:00:56,114 --> 00:00:57,574
Then my guess is true.

14
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:01,774
What do you think you're doing?

15
00:01:05,014 --> 00:01:06,714
How much do you know about me?

16
00:01:07,274 --> 00:01:09,114
Who sent you here?

17
00:01:10,474 --> 00:01:11,614
That's enough.

18
00:01:18,574 --> 00:01:21,074
Stop it. You look pathetic enough.

19
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:22,844
You're so nosy as usual.

20
00:01:23,444 --> 00:01:26,674
Leave already and stop
interfering with our work.

21
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:30,644
If that's the case, I shouldn't leave, sir.

22
00:01:35,844 --> 00:01:39,614
I can't stand by and watch
my supervisor be manhandled.

23
00:01:42,714 --> 00:01:43,814
(Kang Nam Koo)

24
00:01:44,114 --> 00:01:46,774
I'm Kang Nam Koo of the Office of Planning.

25
00:01:53,874 --> 00:01:58,144
Who on earth is pulling
strings to hire all of you?

26
00:01:59,314 --> 00:02:02,374
Your dad hired me. How's that?

27
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:05,214
What? The CEO?

28
00:02:08,914 --> 00:02:10,914
I made one heck of an entrance, didn't I?

29
00:02:14,244 --> 00:02:16,920
What do you mean you hired Nam Koo?

30
00:02:16,944 --> 00:02:19,674
He declined when I offered him the job,

31
00:02:20,144 --> 00:02:21,974
but this time, he asked me himself.

32
00:02:27,044 --> 00:02:28,444
What's going on?

33
00:02:28,674 --> 00:02:30,344
Why is Nam Koo working here?

34
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:32,674
Just let him be.

35
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:34,844
Why him of all people?

36
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:37,650
He's not even qualified
to work at our firm.

37
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:40,714
What would a mechanic
possibly have to offer?

38
00:02:40,814 --> 00:02:42,474
Weren't you the one...

39
00:02:42,974 --> 00:02:45,114
who said he was smart and talented?

40
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:50,044
Besides, who took care of Mo Ah
when you tried to get rid of her?

41
00:02:50,414 --> 00:02:51,944
It was Nam Koo.

42
00:02:52,644 --> 00:02:56,674
Dad, please reconsider this.
He makes me uncomfortable.

43
00:02:56,774 --> 00:03:00,044
That's enough. The CEO
has made up his mind.

44
00:03:10,244 --> 00:03:12,574
Nam Koo must be here as the bodyguard.

45
00:03:12,814 --> 00:03:14,914
We'll let him be though
since he's a low-rank.

46
00:03:15,644 --> 00:03:17,544
His rank isn't of the issue.

47
00:03:18,374 --> 00:03:20,244
It's the fact he's beside Mo Ah.

48
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:23,090
Once the home shopping project fails,

49
00:03:23,114 --> 00:03:25,574
we can use it to force Mo Ah's resignation.

50
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:27,674
Nam Koo will follow suit.

51
00:03:28,244 --> 00:03:30,774
Right now, our job is to
receive the CEO's shares.

52
00:03:33,374 --> 00:03:36,344
Did you find anything
odd in Mo Ah's office?

53
00:03:37,314 --> 00:03:40,114
No, there was nothing.

54
00:03:43,844 --> 00:03:46,514
I can do this alone, so
I don't need your help.

55
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:49,074
How can a low-rank
employee help a superior?

56
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:51,014
It's you who should help me.

57
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,474
Nam Koo, please.

58
00:03:52,844 --> 00:03:56,144
I'd like to live a life without
any more grease stains.

59
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,220
This is dangerous for you too.

60
00:03:58,244 --> 00:04:00,944
I'm certain that they made
you injure your hand.

61
00:04:01,544 --> 00:04:05,014
I couldn't sit by and watch you
take them all on yourself.

62
00:04:05,614 --> 00:04:06,744
Besides,

63
00:04:08,644 --> 00:04:10,474
I'd rather be hurt than let it be you.

64
00:04:15,614 --> 00:04:16,974
Let's go, ma'am.

65
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:19,214
Introduce me to the team.

66
00:04:22,744 --> 00:04:27,114
Where is Mo Ah? She's late for our meeting.

67
00:04:27,214 --> 00:04:31,614
I never imagined a day where
I'd be waiting for Mo Ah.

68
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:35,844
Refer to her appropriately,
or I'll tell on all of you.

69
00:04:36,914 --> 00:04:40,420
Hui Joo, don't you think you
take her side too much?

70
00:04:40,444 --> 00:04:45,074
As former sister-in-law,
shouldn't you hate each other?

71
00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:49,144
There she comes. Ma'am, please come in.

72
00:04:52,244 --> 00:04:54,114
Hold on, it's Nam Koo.

73
00:04:57,074 --> 00:04:58,514
You...

74
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:01,134
(Office of Planning, Kang Nam Koo)

75
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:03,914
Office of Planning, Kang Nam Koo?

76
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:06,444
Ma'am, please.

77
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:10,774
Our team isn't a base camp
for those with connections.

78
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,574
I look forward to working with you.
I'm Kang Nam Koo.

79
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,814
Let's all sit.

80
00:05:27,344 --> 00:05:31,344
Ma'am, here are the candidates
you asked for us to look for.

81
00:05:34,374 --> 00:05:37,814
Out of the orphans we supported,
they made the most of themselves.

82
00:05:40,244 --> 00:05:41,614
I'd like it to be him.

83
00:05:43,014 --> 00:05:47,374
A lawyer. What a great choice.
I'll contact him right away.

84
00:05:47,644 --> 00:05:48,944
I veto.

85
00:05:52,544 --> 00:05:54,514
There's no humanism.

86
00:05:55,544 --> 00:05:57,644
She'd be a better choice.

87
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:01,144
The female owner of a wig factory?

88
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,844
That is a good choice.

89
00:06:03,444 --> 00:06:07,244
Since this is a marketing
stunt, we need a humanist tale.

90
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:10,174
From an orphan to an
owner of a wig factory.

91
00:06:10,314 --> 00:06:12,374
My gosh. How awesome is that?

92
00:06:12,574 --> 00:06:14,714
What's awesome about it?

93
00:06:14,844 --> 00:06:18,544
Anyway, don't argue and go
with whoever she wants.

94
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:23,144
No, Nam Koo's right. We'll
choose her instead.

95
00:06:26,414 --> 00:06:29,314
I don't think Mo Ah will easily resign.

96
00:06:30,844 --> 00:06:34,220
Do Hoon said he'd have Mo Ah fired soon.

97
00:06:34,244 --> 00:06:36,244
So just be by his side and help him.

98
00:06:36,344 --> 00:06:39,220
Besides, I've handed all
of my shares to Do Hoon.

99
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:42,874
Once his dad's on board, he'll
have no trouble being CEO.

100
00:06:43,044 --> 00:06:46,114
That'll pave the way for my
grandchild to be one too.

101
00:06:47,944 --> 00:06:52,444
Could you perhaps talk to
Mo Ah's aunt about her?

102
00:06:54,074 --> 00:06:55,114
Me?

103
00:06:57,844 --> 00:07:00,914
Are you going to let Mo
Ah keep working there?

104
00:07:02,174 --> 00:07:03,814
No, of course not.

105
00:07:04,144 --> 00:07:06,314
It's awfully strange though.

106
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:10,674
Mo Hyuk seems to know something,
but he wouldn't say what.

107
00:07:18,174 --> 00:07:20,614
Ms. Hong, this is a surprise.

108
00:07:22,014 --> 00:07:24,144
Please have a seat first.

109
00:07:30,314 --> 00:07:33,814
It's been a while. I hope you've been well.

110
00:07:34,514 --> 00:07:35,914
Well?

111
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:39,350
Jae Min died, but you must be doing well...

112
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:42,050
since you have a new grandchild on the way.

113
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:45,214
Thanks to your family, we've
been doing great too.

114
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:49,614
I'm here to ask...

115
00:07:50,514 --> 00:07:52,914
if you could talk Mo Ah out of this.

116
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:57,444
It's not right of you to
encourage her this way.

117
00:07:57,974 --> 00:07:59,174
What are you talking about?

118
00:07:59,574 --> 00:08:01,674
We all know why she joined the company.

119
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,444
She wants to get revenge in someway,

120
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:06,874
but she's only wasting her time.

121
00:08:06,974 --> 00:08:10,674
She should remarry and find
a good place to work at.

122
00:08:10,774 --> 00:08:13,290
Encouraging her won't help her move on,

123
00:08:13,314 --> 00:08:15,214
so please put an end to it.

124
00:08:15,374 --> 00:08:16,520
Let her be.

125
00:08:16,544 --> 00:08:20,574
She can date someone at TMO and marry him.

126
00:08:21,314 --> 00:08:24,190
What tricks do you have up your sleeves?

127
00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:25,950
This won't end nicely for her.

128
00:08:25,974 --> 00:08:28,544
Hang on. Did you just threaten her?

129
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:32,044
Anyway, it's actually you and
Do Hoon who are in trouble.

130
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,150
If only you knew how much.

131
00:08:34,174 --> 00:08:37,244
Would Mo Ah have joined the
company without a plan?

132
00:08:38,844 --> 00:08:41,744
So she has a plan to take us down?

133
00:08:41,844 --> 00:08:43,174
Yes, of course.

134
00:08:43,674 --> 00:08:47,514
You'll be shocked to the core
once you hear what it is.

135
00:08:49,244 --> 00:08:50,544
My goodness.

136
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:54,414
Since when did you start bluffing?
I bet she has no plan.

137
00:08:54,514 --> 00:08:56,744
Do you want to know what it is?

138
00:08:57,014 --> 00:09:00,150
Fine, I'll tell you. Just
don't pass out on me.

139
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:03,650
Honey, I'm going to tell
her what Mo Ah has on her.

140
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:07,820
No, don't. We have to keep it to ourselves.

141
00:09:07,844 --> 00:09:10,344
Mo Ah said not to mention it to anyone.

142
00:09:10,514 --> 00:09:12,390
You'll only be ruining her plans.

143
00:09:12,414 --> 00:09:14,214
Honey, please.

144
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:20,514
If you really care about Mo Ah,

145
00:09:21,414 --> 00:09:23,814
I know you'll do the right thing.

146
00:09:24,144 --> 00:09:25,844
I'll get going then.

147
00:09:32,914 --> 00:09:36,290
Honey, do you really know
something that I don't?

148
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:38,044
No, of course not.

149
00:09:38,514 --> 00:09:40,444
I was just trying to play her.

150
00:09:40,544 --> 00:09:42,874
Now what can I do to stop Mo Ah?

151
00:09:49,374 --> 00:09:52,144
Can you check my receipts
and add the numbers?

152
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:54,774
My calculations don't add up.

153
00:09:55,984 --> 00:09:58,644
I'm not that good with numbers though.

154
00:09:59,174 --> 00:10:00,214
My gosh.

155
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:01,944
What are you two up to?

156
00:10:02,374 --> 00:10:05,520
Don't tell me that you
can't add and subtract.

157
00:10:05,544 --> 00:10:07,844
Let me help you with this.

158
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,814
No, stay out of it.

159
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:11,944
I can do this.

160
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:17,744
The store name is in English.

161
00:10:18,014 --> 00:10:19,514
How do I read it?

162
00:10:19,844 --> 00:10:22,174
Can't you even read a store sign?

163
00:10:22,314 --> 00:10:24,174
What kind of education did you receive?

164
00:10:24,314 --> 00:10:26,344
I dropped out of middle school.

165
00:10:26,644 --> 00:10:27,644
What?

166
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:30,844
Are you saying that you
didn't even finish it?

167
00:10:31,074 --> 00:10:34,550
Still, my brother got his GED and
finally finished high school.

168
00:10:34,574 --> 00:10:35,574
What?

169
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:39,984
Are you saying that he's a dropout as well?

170
00:10:40,114 --> 00:10:42,574
You've got to be kidding me.

171
00:10:43,174 --> 00:10:45,690
What good do academics do anyway?

172
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:48,850
Still, I'm second in terms
of education in our family.

173
00:10:48,874 --> 00:10:52,220
My mom went to work at a factory
straight out of elementary school.

174
00:10:52,244 --> 00:10:53,714
Her family needed the money.

175
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:56,244
Mom, you didn't attend any school.

176
00:10:56,514 --> 00:11:00,114
That was the norm when I was young.
It's not the case now.

177
00:11:00,644 --> 00:11:05,174
I want to like you, but
there's no way for me to.

178
00:11:06,774 --> 00:11:08,074
My gosh.

179
00:11:16,114 --> 00:11:18,974
You're probably embarrassed of me as well.

180
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:23,144
I'm not. I had to try three times
to get into college myself.

181
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:24,744
Don't sweat it.

182
00:11:24,874 --> 00:11:26,814
If I were a bit smarter,

183
00:11:27,244 --> 00:11:31,244
your mom wouldn't think
I'm good for nothing.

184
00:11:32,244 --> 00:11:33,744
Don't worry.

185
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:37,144
I know that you're a lot
smarter than my mom.

186
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:39,714
Why?

187
00:11:39,844 --> 00:11:42,714
I don't know if I should
tell you this, but...

188
00:11:43,944 --> 00:11:47,374
I'll tell you when I
absolutely need to, all right?

189
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:50,244
What is it? Can't you tell me now?

190
00:11:50,914 --> 00:11:53,474
I wouldn't be a good son if I did.

191
00:11:56,244 --> 00:11:58,674
It's time for our meeting with the model.

192
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:01,244
Ma'am, let's go.

193
00:12:01,544 --> 00:12:03,244
Nam Koo, you don't need to come.

194
00:12:04,044 --> 00:12:06,990
Why not? I brought him since
he's good with the ladies.

195
00:12:07,014 --> 00:12:08,074
Aren't I right?

196
00:12:10,014 --> 00:12:13,044
She has children, so I'd
rather he stay behind.

197
00:12:19,174 --> 00:12:20,544
Did you two argue?

198
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:22,714
You really should be nicer to her.

199
00:12:23,174 --> 00:12:24,374
Anyway, we won't be gone long.

200
00:12:34,344 --> 00:12:36,244
(TMO Group, Director Jung Mo Ah)

201
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,014
Let me get this straight.

202
00:12:40,514 --> 00:12:44,814
You want me to promote your products on TV?

203
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:47,720
Yes, but you won't be
promoting them directly.

204
00:12:47,744 --> 00:12:52,314
We just need you to tell your
life story during production.

205
00:12:52,744 --> 00:12:55,350
You'll also speak in an
interview afterwards,

206
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,114
and it'll be released online.

207
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:03,974
I'm grateful for TMO Group's support,

208
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:07,174
but I can't agree to this.

209
00:13:07,774 --> 00:13:08,914
Why not?

210
00:13:09,744 --> 00:13:11,374
My children...

211
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:15,214
don't know that I'm an orphan.

212
00:13:16,244 --> 00:13:18,344
I also don't want to be pitied for it.

213
00:13:20,114 --> 00:13:21,444
Please reconsider.

214
00:13:21,744 --> 00:13:24,144
Being an orphan is nothing
to be ashamed about.

215
00:13:24,314 --> 00:13:26,044
Have you been one yourself?

216
00:13:26,374 --> 00:13:27,474
Sorry?

217
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:32,044
Every mistake you make is
because you're an orphan.

218
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:36,314
Even compliments end in, "That
was good for an orphan."

219
00:13:36,474 --> 00:13:37,644
Moreover,

220
00:13:38,674 --> 00:13:43,314
I don't want my children to
be ridiculed in any way.

221
00:13:45,544 --> 00:13:49,344
You're very much like someone I know.

222
00:13:51,114 --> 00:13:52,114
What?

223
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:56,714
He was embarrassed that
he was an orphan too.

224
00:13:57,374 --> 00:14:00,544
Life wasn't at all easy for him.

225
00:14:00,744 --> 00:14:02,814
Go and ask him then.

226
00:14:02,914 --> 00:14:05,774
He'll know why I'm declining.

227
00:14:06,414 --> 00:14:09,874
I don't have to ask since
he's my ex-husband.

228
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:11,674
I'm also an orphan too.

229
00:14:15,614 --> 00:14:19,944
He divorced me because he was
ashamed that I am an orphan.

230
00:14:20,674 --> 00:14:24,774
Now he has met his rich parents
and is living in glory.

231
00:14:25,374 --> 00:14:31,114
Still, I've never once been
ashamed of being an orphan.

232
00:14:35,344 --> 00:14:37,714
Forget that we ever made you this offer.

233
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:41,290
You may not be a billionaire,

234
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:45,244
but I thought a leader in your
position would be different.

235
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:50,114
Just know that if I were you though,

236
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:55,014
I'd rather be true to my
children than be a liar.

237
00:14:58,174 --> 00:14:59,644
Hui Joo, let's go.

238
00:15:01,244 --> 00:15:02,374
Wait.

239
00:15:03,414 --> 00:15:04,644
Hold on a second.

240
00:15:08,844 --> 00:15:11,014
Why didn't you go with Mo
Ah to pitch to the model?

241
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:16,344
See? She's uncomfortable to
be around you here as well.

242
00:15:16,944 --> 00:15:20,244
Resign and make her do so too.

243
00:15:21,144 --> 00:15:23,374
I have no power being a low-rank employee.

244
00:15:27,974 --> 00:15:30,344
My uncle has his gun aiming at her.

245
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:32,244
Is that a threat?

246
00:15:33,074 --> 00:15:36,674
Of course not. Threats never work on you.

247
00:15:37,014 --> 00:15:38,844
You hate that she's here anyway.

248
00:15:39,974 --> 00:15:42,014
If this project fails,

249
00:15:42,514 --> 00:15:44,244
Mo Ah will be fired.

250
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,544
So don't help her if you
want to see her resign.

251
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:48,974
All right?

252
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:54,514
I can't believe Mo Ah's aunt!

253
00:15:56,944 --> 00:15:59,814
My goodness. Nam Koo,
what are you doing here?

254
00:16:05,544 --> 00:16:07,044
Are you here because of Mo Ah?

255
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:10,814
Actually, I'm glad that you're here.

256
00:16:11,214 --> 00:16:13,344
Who knew that I'd ever be happy to see you?

257
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:17,174
Can you make her resign? I'm
sick and tired of seeing her.

258
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,644
I'll get going then, sir.

259
00:16:29,574 --> 00:16:33,044
Hold on. Why is he suddenly
showing you respect?

260
00:16:33,174 --> 00:16:34,614
He works here now.

261
00:16:34,914 --> 00:16:37,174
What? What do you mean he works here?

262
00:16:38,574 --> 00:16:42,620
Mo Ah's connection must be powerful
to even get Nam Koo a job.

263
00:16:42,644 --> 00:16:45,120
Who is it? Have you not
found Jeon Byung Soo?

264
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:46,844
Dad gave him the job.

265
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,220
I can't believe your dad at times.

266
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,374
Having Mo Ah here is bad enough.

267
00:16:59,514 --> 00:17:00,974
How did it go with the model?

268
00:17:01,174 --> 00:17:03,944
She turned us down, but
Mo Ah changed her mind.

269
00:17:04,214 --> 00:17:05,243
How?

270
00:17:05,244 --> 00:17:08,344
The lady didn't want her children
to know she's an orphan,

271
00:17:08,874 --> 00:17:10,074
so Mo Ah said this.

272
00:17:10,774 --> 00:17:12,290
"Forget we ever made you this offer."

273
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:14,190
"Just know that if I were you though,"

274
00:17:14,214 --> 00:17:17,744
"I'd rather be true to my
children than be a liar."

275
00:17:17,974 --> 00:17:19,244
Her words, not mine.

276
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:21,444
That's impressive.

277
00:17:26,614 --> 00:17:29,074
(Director's Office)

278
00:17:29,774 --> 00:17:31,844
If this project fails,

279
00:17:32,374 --> 00:17:34,184
Mo Ah will be fired.

280
00:17:34,774 --> 00:17:38,244
So don't help her if you
want to see her resign.

281
00:17:52,714 --> 00:17:56,714
Since this is a marketing
stunt, we need a humanist tale.

282
00:17:56,974 --> 00:17:59,974
From an orphan to an
owner of a wig factory.

283
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:02,444
My gosh. How awesome is that?

284
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:15,314
Is Mo Ah really the director of TMO Group?

285
00:18:16,014 --> 00:18:17,314
Didn't you know?

286
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:20,344
Of course I didn't. How could I have known?

287
00:18:20,514 --> 00:18:22,844
Ms. Hong didn't tell me.

288
00:18:22,974 --> 00:18:24,684
I thought you knew.

289
00:18:24,814 --> 00:18:26,514
Anyway, how did you find out?

290
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:29,314
I know since I work with her now.

291
00:18:29,944 --> 00:18:31,590
How can you when...

292
00:18:31,614 --> 00:18:34,314
you work all day at the auto shop?

293
00:18:34,774 --> 00:18:37,720
Hold on. Did you get a job at TMO?

294
00:18:37,744 --> 00:18:39,114
Did CEO Shin...

295
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:41,644
(Kang Nam Koo)

296
00:18:41,944 --> 00:18:46,014
So it's true! My gosh,
I'm so happy for you.

297
00:18:46,114 --> 00:18:48,874
Finally, now I can rest.

298
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:51,644
I know you only joined
because you miss her.

299
00:18:52,614 --> 00:18:54,114
I'm upset though.

300
00:18:54,244 --> 00:18:57,314
How could CEO Shin hire you
as a low-rank employee?

301
00:18:57,414 --> 00:18:59,160
Mo Ah's a director,

302
00:18:59,184 --> 00:19:02,244
but you're a subordinate when your
friend is the general director.

303
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:08,344
What are you looking at?

304
00:19:09,374 --> 00:19:11,114
You when you were three.

305
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:13,114
I asked Mother for a photo.

306
00:19:16,414 --> 00:19:19,114
I don't see much of a resemblance though.

307
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:21,184
Would you like to see it?

308
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:26,544
What's wrong?

309
00:19:27,414 --> 00:19:31,074
I just think I looked ugly back then.

310
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:33,684
I think you were adorable.

311
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:36,744
I wish our baby would be just as cute.

312
00:19:41,144 --> 00:19:43,944
So when will you have Mo Ah fired?

313
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:45,444
Don't worry.

314
00:19:45,974 --> 00:19:48,244
She'll resign after this
home shopping project.

315
00:19:54,544 --> 00:19:56,244
My sources tell me...

316
00:19:56,974 --> 00:19:59,814
that they'll make you run point on
this upcoming home shopping project.

317
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,544
If you fail to deliver, you'll
be fired from the company...

318
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:05,574
and be on the outs with me.

319
00:20:16,144 --> 00:20:18,244
Is our home shopping
broadcast being aired today?

320
00:20:18,814 --> 00:20:20,574
The model should be ready.

321
00:20:21,114 --> 00:20:23,214
Of course. Mo Ah hired her herself.

322
00:20:23,944 --> 00:20:26,814
This would've been overwhelming for Mo Ah.

323
00:20:27,244 --> 00:20:29,244
I hope it all goes smoothly.

324
00:20:29,944 --> 00:20:31,590
I doubt all products will be sold,

325
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:34,214
but I'm sure we'll have
a fairly good response.

326
00:20:34,314 --> 00:20:36,414
You should watch with the board members.

327
00:20:36,514 --> 00:20:37,714
I should.

328
00:20:37,814 --> 00:20:40,184
I'll head over to the studio then.

329
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:47,774
The function should be promoted,

330
00:20:47,874 --> 00:20:49,414
- so we'll be zooming in.
- Sure.

331
00:20:49,684 --> 00:20:51,474
Read consumer reviews...

332
00:20:51,614 --> 00:20:54,214
and explain the components of the product.

333
00:20:55,774 --> 00:20:59,544
The show will air in 30 minutes.
Why isn't the model here?

334
00:20:59,944 --> 00:21:02,214
She'll be here, so don't worry.

335
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:04,874
Hui Joo, give her a call.

336
00:21:04,974 --> 00:21:07,414
We're responsible if she doesn't show up.

337
00:21:07,774 --> 00:21:08,814
I'm on it.

338
00:21:13,944 --> 00:21:16,044
If this project fails,

339
00:21:16,614 --> 00:21:18,244
Mo Ah will be fired.

340
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:20,914
So don't help her if you
want to see her resign.

341
00:21:22,644 --> 00:21:25,184
30 minutes until standby!

342
00:21:26,044 --> 00:21:29,914
I'd like to read the script
with the model beforehand.

343
00:21:30,684 --> 00:21:34,220
I gave her the script, so
you won't need much time.

344
00:21:34,244 --> 00:21:35,414
Sure.

345
00:21:36,444 --> 00:21:38,944
What do we do? She isn't answering.

346
00:21:39,374 --> 00:21:40,814
We're in trouble.

347
00:21:40,944 --> 00:21:43,444
Ma'am, we should call the head office.

348
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:52,214
I'd like to speak to the model.

349
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:02,574
You'll be our supplier.

350
00:22:06,344 --> 00:22:08,114
(Check for 10,000 dollars)

351
00:22:10,674 --> 00:22:13,244
Are you sure that I can take this?

352
00:22:13,844 --> 00:22:16,014
I don't want to cause the company trouble.

353
00:22:16,574 --> 00:22:20,674
I'm grateful for TMO Group's
support when I was an orphan,

354
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,974
so I'd like to return the favor.

355
00:22:24,474 --> 00:22:27,874
You're helping the company
by helping me now.

356
00:22:31,174 --> 00:22:33,014
10 minutes!

357
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:38,644
Ma'am, we can't air your products
without the model you promised.

358
00:22:40,074 --> 00:22:42,714
- What should we do now?
- Is this the best you can do?

359
00:22:43,814 --> 00:22:45,414
Don't you have a substitute?

360
00:22:46,374 --> 00:22:47,444
I don't.

361
00:22:49,644 --> 00:22:50,814
You don't?

362
00:22:51,574 --> 00:22:54,114
How can you be so reckless
and irresponsible?

363
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:57,814
Don't you know how important
this product launch is?

364
00:22:57,974 --> 00:23:01,544
The CEO and the board members
will be tuning in today,

365
00:23:01,644 --> 00:23:03,314
but you don't have a backup plan.

366
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:04,714
Five minutes!

367
00:23:04,844 --> 00:23:08,074
Darn. Your model should be here by now.

368
00:23:10,244 --> 00:23:11,514
She's here.

369
00:23:13,244 --> 00:23:15,844
Then bring her over. We don't have time.

370
00:23:17,474 --> 00:23:19,974
What do you mean? She's not here.

371
00:23:21,074 --> 00:23:23,944
Director Jung can do it.
She's an orphan too.

372
00:23:25,174 --> 00:23:26,774
Is this a joke to you?

373
00:23:27,244 --> 00:23:29,074
The future of our company is at stake.

374
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:33,314
She has experience modeling
for Young Hwa, remember?

375
00:23:34,844 --> 00:23:37,244
Really? Then this might actually work.

376
00:23:37,344 --> 00:23:39,044
Ma'am, you should do it.

377
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:42,914
She's not from the orphanage
our company supported.

378
00:23:43,144 --> 00:23:44,914
It's better than ruining the show.

379
00:23:45,014 --> 00:23:47,674
From a temporary worker
to a director of TMO.

380
00:23:47,774 --> 00:23:50,574
She has makeup on and is
dressed appropriately.

381
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,144
Sir, I think she's ready.

382
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:03,574
Have a seat.

383
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,644
Did you take care of the model Mo Ah hired?

384
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:16,790
Yes. Someone we hired will show up instead.

385
00:24:16,814 --> 00:24:17,944
I see.

386
00:24:19,514 --> 00:24:23,244
So all we have to do is now kick Mo Ah out.

387
00:24:25,074 --> 00:24:28,174
Hello, everyone. I'm
your host Kim Mi Jeong.

388
00:24:28,344 --> 00:24:33,574
Today, we'll be bringing you the
anticipated new product of TMO.

389
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:36,420
With high levels of dust in the air...

390
00:24:36,444 --> 00:24:38,874
What's going on? Why is Mo Ah on TV?

391
00:24:41,114 --> 00:24:43,244
It's the product you're looking at.

392
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,820
You all know that TMO Group
supports an orphanage.

393
00:24:47,844 --> 00:24:50,750
Next to me is someone from that orphanage.

394
00:24:50,774 --> 00:24:54,020
Despite all the hardships
she had to go through life,

395
00:24:54,044 --> 00:24:56,290
Ms. Jung Mo Ah was able to build a career.

396
00:24:56,314 --> 00:24:58,514
- Welcome.
- Hello.

397
00:24:59,944 --> 00:25:02,644
First, I'd like to get the facts straight.

398
00:25:02,844 --> 00:25:04,714
I am an orphan,

399
00:25:04,814 --> 00:25:07,514
but I'm not from the orphanage
TMO Group supports.

400
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:11,220
However, I wouldn't be here had
it not been for the group.

401
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:14,944
I'd like to take this chance
to express my gratitude.

402
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:17,114
Hold on.

403
00:25:17,814 --> 00:25:20,974
I'm hearing that we already
have too many calls.

404
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:25,214
I wonder if it's thanks to
you or actually the product.

405
00:25:25,844 --> 00:25:28,014
Of course it's the product.

406
00:25:29,574 --> 00:25:31,374
- I see.
- She's great, sir.

407
00:25:32,144 --> 00:25:33,614
You must be relieved.

408
00:25:34,874 --> 00:25:37,844
Director Jung sure knows what she's doing.

409
00:25:38,714 --> 00:25:41,650
Thanks to all of your
enthusiasm and interest,

410
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:43,690
we are nearly sold out.

411
00:25:43,714 --> 00:25:46,814
It's astonishing since
we're only 15 minutes in.

412
00:25:46,914 --> 00:25:49,444
We should take it easy for a second.

413
00:25:50,214 --> 00:25:54,514
I'm sure it wasn't easy
growing up as an orphan.

414
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:57,344
If it's all right, could
you share your story?

415
00:25:57,444 --> 00:25:58,944
Camera number two. Cut.

416
00:25:59,874 --> 00:26:02,914
Living in an orphanage
wasn't that hard for me.

417
00:26:03,644 --> 00:26:07,314
There was a boy I liked, and I
also had my younger brother.

418
00:26:07,444 --> 00:26:10,544
It's been harder for me to
make a living for myself.

419
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:12,514
Are you saying...

420
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:15,214
that you're unhappier now?

421
00:26:15,514 --> 00:26:16,774
That's absurd.

422
00:26:16,874 --> 00:26:19,874
How could you be when
you're now so successful?

423
00:26:20,614 --> 00:26:23,914
Anyway, would you like to say thank
you for those who helped you?

424
00:26:24,574 --> 00:26:25,644
Of course.

425
00:26:25,774 --> 00:26:29,814
There was a time when I
suffered from amnesia.

426
00:26:30,014 --> 00:26:34,374
I'd like to express my gratitude
to those who took me in.

427
00:26:36,444 --> 00:26:38,344
If I'm not overstepping,

428
00:26:38,874 --> 00:26:41,014
could I show the viewers a photo?

429
00:26:41,214 --> 00:26:43,244
Yes, of course. I'd like to see it too.

430
00:26:50,044 --> 00:26:51,644
It's them.

431
00:26:56,674 --> 00:26:59,544
Can you see them? These are the people.

432
00:26:59,944 --> 00:27:04,114
Come and find me anytime, and
I'll gladly treat you to a meal.

433
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:07,050
They might not actually be watching,

434
00:27:07,074 --> 00:27:09,774
so please call me if you know any of them.

435
00:27:12,574 --> 00:27:14,450
My gosh, you're such an angel.

436
00:27:14,474 --> 00:27:16,744
Now, please don't be alarmed.

437
00:27:16,914 --> 00:27:20,574
We're only 20 minutes in, but
we're completely sold out.

438
00:27:24,714 --> 00:27:28,814
You're the only one who has
managed to set such a record.

439
00:27:28,974 --> 00:27:30,914
Nice!

440
00:27:34,744 --> 00:27:36,574
How great is this?

441
00:27:38,744 --> 00:27:40,444
My goodness.

442
00:27:41,344 --> 00:27:44,514
I can't believe what Mo
Ah pulled off today.

443
00:27:44,614 --> 00:27:47,074
Did you see how she didn't even fluster?

444
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:51,220
She could have a career in home
shopping if she wanted to.

445
00:27:51,244 --> 00:27:52,890
Would we be receiving a bonus?

446
00:27:52,914 --> 00:27:56,414
Hui Joo, could you ask your dad for one?

447
00:28:01,744 --> 00:28:03,144
Greetings, sir.

448
00:28:05,344 --> 00:28:07,174
You all did a great job.

449
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:11,644
Our new product launch
is an absolute success.

450
00:28:12,444 --> 00:28:15,144
Sir, Mr. Ma would like a bonus.

451
00:28:15,644 --> 00:28:18,350
I never said that. It was him.

452
00:28:18,374 --> 00:28:20,974
Of course you should have one.

453
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,944
You're in for a treat.

454
00:28:23,044 --> 00:28:25,044
Sir, we love you!

455
00:28:28,844 --> 00:28:31,744
Why did you change models
at the last minute?

456
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,714
Was this your plan all along?

457
00:28:34,414 --> 00:28:37,844
Unfortunately, she changed
her mind at the last minute.

458
00:28:37,944 --> 00:28:40,944
Still, our products were practically
able to sell themselves.

459
00:28:41,514 --> 00:28:45,514
Mo Ah... I'm sorry. All
credit goes to Director Jung.

460
00:28:46,114 --> 00:28:48,674
Of course. You all did great too.

461
00:28:49,974 --> 00:28:52,214
So where exactly is Director Jung?

462
00:28:53,214 --> 00:28:55,444
I'm not sure. Nam Koo's gone too.

463
00:28:57,314 --> 00:29:01,944
Just like you said, Mr. Shin
Do Hoon came to see me.

464
00:29:05,014 --> 00:29:06,374
He also gave me this.

465
00:29:19,644 --> 00:29:21,574
Thank you so much.

466
00:29:23,544 --> 00:29:25,244
I don't need the money.

467
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:28,774
It isn't why I agreed to
this in the first place.

468
00:29:28,974 --> 00:29:32,074
Shin Do Hoon, the man I met.

469
00:29:32,874 --> 00:29:34,244
He's your ex-husband, isn't he?

470
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:41,974
You know how us orphans are
good at reading situations.

471
00:29:44,474 --> 00:29:48,514
Did you tell your children
that you're an orphan?

472
00:29:50,244 --> 00:29:51,344
I did.

473
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:55,314
You were right. I should've
told them years ago.

474
00:29:55,614 --> 00:29:59,314
I feel like there's been
something lifted off my chest.

475
00:30:00,074 --> 00:30:01,214
My children...

476
00:30:02,174 --> 00:30:04,244
hugged me and said they were proud.

477
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:12,074
I should get going. The
factory won't run itself.

478
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:20,114
Thank you so much. I'll come
by soon to see the kids.

479
00:30:36,944 --> 00:30:38,514
You sure are scary.

480
00:30:39,814 --> 00:30:42,574
Nam Koo, how did you know I was here?

481
00:30:43,314 --> 00:30:45,214
You can't fool me, you know.

482
00:30:45,514 --> 00:30:48,314
You were a good model but a poor actor.

483
00:30:49,574 --> 00:30:51,174
You need to step up your game.

484
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:53,214
How could you accept so easily?

485
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:55,874
You should've declined
at least a few times.

486
00:30:58,214 --> 00:31:01,344
Don't worry. Do Hoon's uncle is clueless.

487
00:31:04,244 --> 00:31:06,314
So what did your mom say?

488
00:31:06,744 --> 00:31:08,374
About your new job.

489
00:31:09,514 --> 00:31:12,774
You know how she is. She
told me to serve you well.

490
00:31:14,614 --> 00:31:15,944
So don't fire me.

491
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:24,914
I thought your plans always work.

492
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:29,874
What is this?

493
00:31:30,644 --> 00:31:32,914
We just helped Mo Ah put
herself on a pedestal.

494
00:31:33,714 --> 00:31:36,644
The women from the hostess bar
or the freezer truck driver...

495
00:31:37,244 --> 00:31:39,244
can ruin everything for us.

496
00:31:41,044 --> 00:31:42,614
She knew.

497
00:31:43,414 --> 00:31:44,474
What?

498
00:31:45,214 --> 00:31:49,244
She was prepared in case we
made a move on the model.

499
00:32:02,774 --> 00:32:04,674
Do you like the photos?

500
00:32:10,574 --> 00:32:12,444
Is this why you joined the company?

501
00:32:12,944 --> 00:32:14,944
Are you trying to burn it into the ground?

502
00:32:15,874 --> 00:32:17,114
What are you talking about?

503
00:32:17,214 --> 00:32:19,950
I sold all the products.
Employees have been praising me.

504
00:32:19,974 --> 00:32:21,774
So what if you find those people?

505
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:23,774
Will you threaten me with them?

506
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:25,544
You should be in prison.

507
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,114
This was a good opportunity for
me to gather evidence on you.

508
00:32:31,474 --> 00:32:33,974
Human trafficking, kidnapping,

509
00:32:34,874 --> 00:32:36,344
and attempted murder.

510
00:32:37,144 --> 00:32:42,044
If only I knew who deliberately
tried to ruin Nam Koo's hand.

511
00:32:42,914 --> 00:32:45,244
You're crossing a dangerous line here.

512
00:32:45,744 --> 00:32:47,374
I'll stop if I were you.

513
00:32:52,414 --> 00:32:53,674
Do your worst.

514
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:57,374
My life ended anyway when Jae Min died.

515
00:32:57,544 --> 00:33:01,474
So I'll do anything I can
to drag you down with me.

516
00:33:13,144 --> 00:33:17,574
Mo Ah rose to the occasion
and saved the day.

517
00:33:18,644 --> 00:33:20,050
Did you come over to tell me that?

518
00:33:20,074 --> 00:33:23,244
Of course. I know you worry for her.

519
00:33:24,714 --> 00:33:26,814
Do Hoon's a fake.

520
00:33:27,474 --> 00:33:29,514
He's Park Do Hoon, not Shin Do Hoon.

521
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,774
He's not the CEO's son.

522
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:36,644
Watch it online when you can.

523
00:33:36,744 --> 00:33:38,174
Sure. I will.

524
00:33:38,544 --> 00:33:41,090
Also, Mo Ah and I have grown closer.

525
00:33:41,114 --> 00:33:43,044
I actually came to tell you that.

526
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:46,544
Did your aunt see Mo Ah on TV too?

527
00:33:46,744 --> 00:33:48,314
I bet she's angry.

528
00:33:54,174 --> 00:33:57,020
She sold all the products? Unbelievable.

529
00:33:57,044 --> 00:34:01,774
First she works overtime for days,
and now she makes them money.

530
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:06,374
Aunt.

531
00:34:07,074 --> 00:34:09,214
Is this why you joined this company?

532
00:34:09,344 --> 00:34:12,344
You should at least try and
hurt or embarrass Do Hoon,

533
00:34:12,744 --> 00:34:14,544
not make money for his company.

534
00:34:18,314 --> 00:34:20,950
Aunt, let's go. Let's talk somewhere else.

535
00:34:20,974 --> 00:34:24,874
Save it. I'm actually here to see the CEO.

536
00:34:25,144 --> 00:34:26,544
Aunt, please.

537
00:34:32,044 --> 00:34:34,444
Can you at least hear me out?

538
00:34:45,244 --> 00:34:48,844
Why on earth did you join this company?

539
00:34:49,644 --> 00:34:51,914
Is it so that you could make them money?

540
00:34:52,244 --> 00:34:53,314
Aunt.

541
00:34:53,414 --> 00:34:57,244
You could've at least curse
them out on live television,

542
00:34:57,444 --> 00:34:58,814
but you're too much of a coward.

543
00:34:59,774 --> 00:35:04,374
I've had enough. I'm asking
the CEO to fire you.

544
00:35:04,874 --> 00:35:08,474
You're crazy. You've
completely lost your mind.

545
00:35:09,144 --> 00:35:11,120
Aunt, you don't know the full story.

546
00:35:11,144 --> 00:35:12,474
What full story?

547
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:16,244
Let's say that you're
here to get your revenge.

548
00:35:16,474 --> 00:35:18,244
How will you do it though?

549
00:35:19,344 --> 00:35:24,174
Being in their proximity will
only cause harm for you.

550
00:35:24,674 --> 00:35:27,084
Your life will definitely be over then.

551
00:35:27,644 --> 00:35:31,974
That's it. I'll beg the CEO
if that's what it takes.

552
00:35:32,474 --> 00:35:35,714
Aunt, I'm here for a reason.

553
00:35:36,214 --> 00:35:37,914
Move. Get out of my way.

554
00:35:38,144 --> 00:35:40,844
Can you keep a secret?

555
00:35:40,944 --> 00:35:42,044
A secret?

556
00:35:43,314 --> 00:35:47,544
You have to act the same
as if nothing has changed.

557
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:49,974
What is it?

558
00:35:51,814 --> 00:35:55,614
Do Hoon isn't CEO Shin's son.

559
00:35:57,974 --> 00:35:59,584
That's absurd.

560
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:02,020
What is he then?

561
00:36:02,044 --> 00:36:03,344
He's a fake.

562
00:36:03,814 --> 00:36:06,314
CEO Shin's brother fabricated
the DNA test result.

563
00:36:07,814 --> 00:36:09,914
What? A fake?

564
00:36:10,474 --> 00:36:13,644
Why haven't you yet told the CEO then?

565
00:36:14,114 --> 00:36:17,444
Because I'll only be doing them a favor.

566
00:36:18,144 --> 00:36:21,014
When things are a bliss, when
they'll suffer the most,

567
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:23,474
that's when I'll reveal the secret.

568
00:36:23,944 --> 00:36:27,114
So please don't worry about me anymore.

569
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,874
My heart's pounding.

570
00:36:30,944 --> 00:36:32,114
Okay, fine.

571
00:36:32,844 --> 00:36:36,044
I'll go home for now, but we'll talk later.

572
00:36:36,514 --> 00:36:37,674
All right?

573
00:36:38,444 --> 00:36:39,814
I'll see myself out.

574
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:48,974
Am I really not the son?

575
00:36:56,584 --> 00:36:57,774
Take a closer look...

576
00:36:58,714 --> 00:37:00,014
for I am real.

577
00:37:01,144 --> 00:37:02,744
I am the CEO's son.

578
00:37:06,014 --> 00:37:08,874
You're a fake from every possible angle.

579
00:37:09,174 --> 00:37:11,474
One that's of cheap quality as well.

580
00:37:11,614 --> 00:37:13,344
I finally know.

581
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:15,690
I now know why you're here.

582
00:37:15,714 --> 00:37:16,974
Didn't you know?

583
00:37:17,114 --> 00:37:20,244
I honestly thought that you already did.

584
00:37:20,374 --> 00:37:21,814
I should thank you...

585
00:37:22,244 --> 00:37:24,244
for not telling my dad about this.

586
00:37:24,844 --> 00:37:26,144
For whose sake?

587
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:31,620
I don't want to miss the fun of
seeing Mother dote on her fake son.

588
00:37:31,644 --> 00:37:34,314
It's why I told you to be nice to her.

589
00:37:34,714 --> 00:37:36,714
Do you remember us seeing a fortuneteller?

590
00:37:37,844 --> 00:37:39,414
Anyway, she said that...

591
00:37:40,014 --> 00:37:42,114
we have knives pointing at each other.

592
00:37:43,244 --> 00:37:45,614
One would have to die.

593
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:47,844
Really?

594
00:37:49,374 --> 00:37:53,744
That's too bad. I have so
much to do before I can rest.

595
00:37:54,944 --> 00:37:57,614
I guess that only leaves one of us then.

596
00:38:13,414 --> 00:38:16,114
(I Am Sorry, but I Love You)

597
00:38:16,374 --> 00:38:18,450
I'll be honest. I want to be the CEO.

598
00:38:18,474 --> 00:38:20,720
Is being CEO more important than your dad?

599
00:38:20,744 --> 00:38:22,720
Please don't tell my dad I'm a fake.

600
00:38:22,744 --> 00:38:23,914
You can be the next CEO.

601
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:26,944
You may be a family, but
in the end I'm a stranger.
