1
00:00:21,492 --> 00:00:22,503
Hae-chan!

2
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:25,727
Are you okay?

3
00:00:29,058 --> 00:00:31,573
Where am I...the hospital?

4
00:00:32,794 --> 00:00:34,266
You were in a car accident...

5
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,202
The doctor says you're fine.

6
00:00:37,202 --> 00:00:39,784
You can be released right now.

7
00:00:46,904 --> 00:00:50,321
Isn't today the day for the press
release of "Iris?"

8
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:51,828
What?

9
00:00:52,368 --> 00:00:56,375
That's good...we need to go to court
later anyway, we can go together.

10
00:00:58,416 --> 00:00:59,478
Hey, Hae-chan!

11
00:00:59,451 --> 00:01:01,304
I was on my way to court...I was

12
00:01:01,504 --> 00:01:04,017
trying to avoid a truck
that was coming towards me...

13
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,102
[ Final Episode ]

14
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,576
She did get her memory back...

15
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:09,036
But it seems she's lost her
most recent memories.

16
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:11,815
It'll come back slowly.

17
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,606
What? I had amnesia?
No way!

18
00:01:23,553 --> 00:01:25,156
How old was I?

19
00:01:25,517 --> 00:01:26,276
18...

20
00:01:26,977 --> 00:01:31,916
18?
I really wish I were 18.

21
00:01:32,746 --> 00:01:34,640
You really were...

22
00:01:35,781 --> 00:01:37,293
So, how was I?

23
00:01:38,355 --> 00:01:44,075
Well..you were cuter and livelier...
You really liked me.

24
00:01:45,587 --> 00:01:47,208
Stop talking nonsense.

25
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,196
How do you think I feel?

26
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:55,412
I've been cooking, cleaning and
getthing hit by you...

27
00:01:56,292 --> 00:01:57,944
And now you don't remember that?

28
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:00,720
Hey! Kang Sang-young!

29
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,767
Huh? You're not calling me
Kang-bong anymore?

30
00:02:05,357 --> 00:02:06,718
Yeah, right!

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,594
Regardless, I haven't changed my mind

32
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:11,405
so let's do the paperwork for
the divorce.

33
00:02:11,405 --> 00:02:12,986
Oh, really...

34
00:02:13,986 --> 00:02:17,101
But, aren't you working?

35
00:02:17,992 --> 00:02:18,723
Huh?

36
00:02:19,468 --> 00:02:22,659
Since when did you have time to
drive me around...

37
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,462
don't you have shoot?

38
00:02:24,462 --> 00:02:28,610
Hey, no matter how busy I am,
I must drive my princess around.

39
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:30,990
Are you sick?

40
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:46,068
<i>Hey, Hae-chan!</i>

41
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:06,595
Did Ji-young make you this?
It's so childish!

42
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:09,117
Hey, you made that.

43
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,401
You think I'm an idiot?

44
00:03:11,722 --> 00:03:13,203
You think I'm going to
believe that?

45
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:19,203
As you like, as you like...
Believe it or not...

46
00:03:21,765 --> 00:03:24,412
Where are we going?
This isn't the way to the courthouse.

47
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:25,730
Let's go home first!

48
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:27,276
Why would we go home?

49
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:30,093
I want to get this over with
and get out of here!

50
00:03:30,403 --> 00:03:34,107
Hae-won's getting married soon!
Just wait until that's over.

51
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,222
Hae-won's getting married?

52
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:43,922
Why isn't she answering the phone...
How can in-law's get married?

53
00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:46,658
Hae-chan...go inside and
get some rest...

54
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:48,130
You were in an accident.

55
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:52,087
Rest? what do you mean rest?

56
00:03:52,486 --> 00:03:53,476
I'm going to pack my things
and leave.

57
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,122
Leave? Leave where?
You really don't remember?

58
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:59,485
Do you know what I've been doing
for you lately?

59
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,364
I'm going to lose my mind!

60
00:04:06,618 --> 00:04:09,481
No, we can get the divorce later but

61
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,526
you're going to stay here until you
remember what has happened.

62
00:04:12,526 --> 00:04:14,788
There's no way, it's too unfair!!

63
00:04:18,844 --> 00:04:25,885
Oh, Yun-oh..okay,
I'll be right there...

64
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,490
Hey, I'll be right back,
so stay here, okay?

65
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,572
What is this...

66
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:48,749
<i>How can she forget that part
of her memory?</i>

67
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,774
<i>You really are unlucky!</i>

68
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:56,105
I used your wedding as an
excuse to keep her there for now

69
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,684
so go and talk to her.

70
00:05:58,175 --> 00:06:00,910
And because I had to leave so quickly,

71
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,122
I didn't get her anything to eat..

72
00:06:03,482 --> 00:06:05,370
Will you take are of it?

73
00:06:07,028 --> 00:06:07,940
Okay.

74
00:06:37,902 --> 00:06:42,439
Oh, how am I going to deal with
this...I caused quite a bit of trouble...

75
00:06:45,252 --> 00:06:49,405
I'm just going to pretend I don't remember.
You don't remember a thing...

76
00:06:50,524 --> 00:06:52,596
Are you really just going to
quit the film?

77
00:06:53,972 --> 00:06:55,725
I told you I would.

78
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,908
Ji-young finally persuaded
Director Kim to let you do this

79
00:06:59,908 --> 00:07:02,542
so stop being stubbon
and let's go.

80
00:07:03,112 --> 00:07:05,858
I'm sorry,
I want to rest for a while.

81
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:08,430
How are you going to make a living?

82
00:07:09,358 --> 00:07:11,423
Hae-chan's pregnant now too...

83
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:14,115
Are all of you going to starve to death?

84
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:18,886
That's why...when we lost
our first baby,

85
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:21,899
I felt like I had done
something wrong.

86
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,567
I didn't do anything right as a father...

87
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:29,632
So, for this one, I'm going to do
everything I can from now on.

88
00:07:30,647 --> 00:07:32,539
You're really the perfect husband!
The perfect husband!

89
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:35,255
But do you have to quit
all your work?

90
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:38,021
I'm going to look into another play.

91
00:07:38,775 --> 00:07:43,352
I feel like the stage is
where I belong.

92
00:07:43,836 --> 00:07:47,843
You make trouble for yourself.
Does Hae-chan know?

93
00:07:48,413 --> 00:07:51,338
I haven't told her yet.

94
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:59,469
Hey, that's fine for you...
What am I going to do?

95
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,076
Where am I going to find another
Kang Sang-young?

96
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:19,860
Before my sister lost her memory
the first time,

97
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,795
she told me to stop spending
so much time with you.

98
00:08:23,286 --> 00:08:26,361
She's going to have a fit when she
finds out I'm going to marry you.

99
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,154
The truth is, she once set me up
with another girl.

100
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:30,573
What? really?

101
00:08:31,123 --> 00:08:32,225
That sister...!!!

102
00:08:37,661 --> 00:08:40,088
Oh, it's good...

103
00:08:43,286 --> 00:08:47,512
But, you don't remember anything
that's recently happened?

104
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,862
Huh...no...

105
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:56,073
Then why aren't you mad about me
and Bong-gyu getting married?

106
00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:01,234
You've already decided to
get married, what can I do?

107
00:09:01,604 --> 00:09:03,187
I have to be happy for you.

108
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:09,060
Anyway, don't think about
leaving the house.

109
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,405
Because of Bong-gyu, it'll be a little
hard for you to stay at my house.

110
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:16,163
And even if you do go out,
there's nowhere for you to go.

111
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:19,757
So, you stay here until our
wedding, okay?

112
00:09:20,218 --> 00:09:22,253
Okay, I will.

113
00:09:23,113 --> 00:09:24,468
Oh, Sang-young, you're home?

114
00:09:24,908 --> 00:09:27,771
Sit down, I made your favorite stew.

115
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,430
Did you finish packing?

116
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,125
No...why would she pack?

117
00:09:39,093 --> 00:09:42,678
That's right...
Do you remember anything?

118
00:09:44,454 --> 00:09:46,073
N..no..

119
00:09:57,584 --> 00:10:01,379
This is art..
Hae-won, you're so lucky...

120
00:10:01,737 --> 00:10:04,482
It's much better that what you
made for Bong-man's birthday...

121
00:10:05,758 --> 00:10:06,737
When?

122
00:10:08,972 --> 00:10:12,394
Oh, last year...

123
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,463
I was abroad on a shoot last year.

124
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:19,665
Then was it the year before...

125
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:26,282
Oh, why does my stomach feel so bad?

126
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:28,253
Are you okay?

127
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:30,578
Yeah, I feel fine...

128
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:36,939
What's wrong with the two of you?
It tastes great...

129
00:10:40,537 --> 00:10:45,344
Hey, after we finish eating, let's go
watch a really interesting film...

130
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,253
<i>Why is he turning that on...</i>

131
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:08,333
Hey, that's great.
You look great in your uniform.

132
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:12,171
Hey, isn't that Noon?

133
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,943
This is good.

134
00:11:15,693 --> 00:11:17,565
Hey, you don't remember that,
do you?

135
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:19,582
What...what is it?

136
00:11:20,852 --> 00:11:23,525
You and Noon even did
things like that?

137
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:29,043
This is what your friend made you.
You even borrowed his gym shoes...

138
00:11:29,302 --> 00:11:31,849
What do you mean gym shoes...
It was his gym clothes...

139
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,947
Oh, I'm tired...

140
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,185
Oh, she remembers everything...

141
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:52,659
It must be because she
feels so baffled.

142
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:55,164
Well, I don't blame her.

143
00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:00,055
Anyway, it seems like our
wedding is going forward...

144
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:01,390
Of course...

145
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,347
Straight on...

146
00:12:11,215 --> 00:12:13,413
Thanks for coming out.

147
00:12:15,874 --> 00:12:19,460
So, did you think about it?

148
00:12:24,987 --> 00:12:26,648
I'm sorry.

149
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,339
I know...

150
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:36,506
He says that Grandpa
loves him too much

151
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:40,278
and that he'd very hurt
if he left him.

152
00:12:42,753 --> 00:12:48,280
I'm grateful to him for raising
you both so well...

153
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:54,581
You  must be busy getting ready
for the wedding...

154
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:56,594
Yes..

155
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:10,792
Will it be okay if I hugged my son
for the last time?

156
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,467
The realtor's office will be calling
this afternoon.

157
00:13:41,282 --> 00:13:43,400
Someone's coming to see the house.

158
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,768
When we sell the house,
I'll give you the money as alimony

159
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:47,881
so you can study abroad.

160
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:50,786
But, Bong-man, the truth is...

161
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:54,221
I know, you don't want to live
with me, right?

162
00:13:54,931 --> 00:13:58,587
You really disliked me a lot
before the accident.

163
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,886
And if you don't rememer
anything after that...

164
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,386
Well, that's too bad.

165
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:28,163
Yes, when can you deliver
what I ordered?

166
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:33,355
I should've just told him that
I remembered everything...

167
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:36,304
Is he really upset?

168
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:41,886
Oh, Hae-won..

169
00:14:42,134 --> 00:14:45,910
<i>Oh, you don't know this right?
Bong-gyu's mother...</i>

170
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,261
What about her?

171
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,782
<i>She went to grandpa's house and
asked if</i>

172
00:14:50,782 --> 00:14:53,357
<i>she could take Bong-gyu with her
and she got kicked out.</i>

173
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:56,222
<i>She's leaving in a few days...</i>

174
00:14:57,846 --> 00:15:00,167
I'm sorry about what happened.

175
00:15:00,507 --> 00:15:04,036
No, I expected too much...

176
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:10,292
Mother, I'm pregnant.

177
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,156
Dear...

178
00:15:22,574 --> 00:15:23,936
Is this okay?

179
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,973
Yes, please speak informally to me.

180
00:15:28,465 --> 00:15:30,137
When are you due?

181
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:32,450
January 1st.

182
00:15:38,323 --> 00:15:39,793
Give me your hand.

183
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:51,497
Thank you.
Thank you for loving Bong-man...

184
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,787
Mother...

185
00:15:55,598 --> 00:16:00,967
This is the ring you father-in-law
gave me.

186
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:07,635
I only dreamt of this moment...

187
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:15,579
Mother, in a few days, Bong-gyu will
be geting married...

188
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:17,991
Do you really have to leave?

189
00:16:19,523 --> 00:16:24,891
I'd be an univinted guest.
Bong-man wouldn't want that...

190
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:29,772
No, that's not how he really feels.

191
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,589
I had no right to expect so much.

192
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:39,606
I wanted to live with Bong-gyu...
even if it's late...

193
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:46,227
But their grandfather raised them well...

194
00:16:47,797 --> 00:16:50,655
Bong-gyu wants to stay with his
grandfather.

195
00:16:52,235 --> 00:16:53,490
Mother..

196
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,124
No, I'm grateful.

197
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,560
They were raised better than I
could have raised them

198
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,733
and I'm grateful for that.

199
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:06,720
Go on and eat.

200
00:17:46,585 --> 00:17:50,585
<i>Hae-chan, no matter what
anyone says...</i>

201
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:52,858
<i>Let's stay together...</i>

202
00:17:52,858 --> 00:17:55,262
<i>It's hard enough trying to
live together...</i>

203
00:17:57,094 --> 00:18:01,111
<i>How much harder will it be if you
and I tried to live separately.</i>

204
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:04,472
<i>And now it's the three of us.</i>

205
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:12,395
<i>In the future, we'll be happier
than we are now.</i>

206
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:24,125
Congratulations...

207
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:27,818
You knew?

208
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:29,048
Of course...

209
00:18:29,048 --> 00:18:31,202
You thinkg there's anything
I don't know?

210
00:18:32,254 --> 00:18:33,217
Then...

211
00:18:33,217 --> 00:18:34,808
Of course...

212
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,022
So why did you pretend you didn't
remember anything?

213
00:18:38,304 --> 00:18:39,727
You were driving me crazy...

214
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:48,434
It was such a shock for me too...
And I caused you so much trouble.

215
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:51,473
Oh, Hae-chan...
You do have some morals...

216
00:18:52,784 --> 00:18:55,305
But I wish I could go back
one more time...

217
00:18:55,144 --> 00:18:56,621
This time to the age of 10.

218
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:01,397
When I got into trouble, you came
and fixed it for me...

219
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,593
When I acted childish,
you just took it all...

220
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,216
When I left the house,you came looking for me...
Why did you do all that?

221
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:11,283
You're normally selfish and rude.

222
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,595
What?

223
00:19:14,268 --> 00:19:15,708
Was I really?

224
00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:17,474
Why did you do that...
It scared me...

225
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:19,199
It scares me too.

226
00:19:19,498 --> 00:19:21,679
How can your memory return like that?

227
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:27,086
Are you sure you haven't been
putting on a show this whole time?

228
00:19:27,616 --> 00:19:29,244
You never know...

229
00:19:29,244 --> 00:19:30,650
What!

230
00:19:34,786 --> 00:19:38,945
Oh, yeah...I met with your
mother earlier...

231
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,993
She gave me this.

232
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:47,813
Why would you accept it?

233
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:51,892
It's the ring your father gave her
when they got married...

234
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:04,212
But, there's something I really have
wanted to ask you...

235
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:11,112
You wrote in your diary that
you loved me

236
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:13,844
but why were you trying to
leave me?

237
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:21,196
I felt like I was getting in your way...

238
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:28,617
If I only hadn't lost my memory, you
wouldn't be having such a hard time...

239
00:20:29,984 --> 00:20:35,912
And I thought perhaps you were
living with me

240
00:20:35,912 --> 00:20:41,312
out of obligation and not love...

241
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:44,004
Oh, you dummy.

242
00:20:44,886 --> 00:20:50,917
From now on, tell me when you're
happy, unhappy, disappointed, joyful...

243
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,840
Tell me how you're feeling.

244
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:56,748
And don't ever try to
leave like that, okay?

245
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,058
Okay?

246
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,854
This is classy and pretty.

247
00:21:48,594 --> 00:21:51,408
They'll only be able to wear it
on their wedding day...

248
00:21:51,408 --> 00:21:55,645
It's simple so it can be wore often...

249
00:21:55,526 --> 00:21:57,075
Yeah, but it's got to be
at least like this

250
00:21:57,346 --> 00:21:58,897
for a special day like
their wedding...

251
00:21:58,897 --> 00:22:01,953
That's not true...
You don't even know...

252
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:05,679
Why are you two having such a fit?
We've got to be happy with it.

253
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,124
Bong-gyu, isn't this nice?
This is pretty, right?

254
00:22:09,124 --> 00:22:12,108
Look...does it compare to this?

255
00:22:14,174 --> 00:22:17,803
Oh, forget it, forget it!
We're going for our last battle...

256
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:23,812
Whether you fight over it or not,
just bring back something nice, okay?

257
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:25,054
Let's go Bong-gyu...

258
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,086
We'll be leaving first...
See you later!

259
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:30,234
You can't just leave...Hae-won!

260
00:22:30,234 --> 00:22:31,317
Hey, Bong-gyu...Hae-won...

261
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,662
They left because of this ring
you pulled out.

262
00:22:36,643 --> 00:22:38,703
That's the only way!

263
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:40,693
But it's a lie.

264
00:22:41,107 --> 00:22:45,475
There are different types of lies.
This is well-intentioned lie.

265
00:22:45,728 --> 00:22:47,437
Can you live without me?

266
00:22:48,238 --> 00:22:49,120
Right!

267
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,187
So, we are telling this lie
to save a person's life!

268
00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:57,151
You understand, right?
Let's go!

269
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:12,955
Oh, the color's so nice...

270
00:23:12,955 --> 00:23:18,094
So, you want your grandfather
to wear this to the wedding...

271
00:23:19,235 --> 00:23:20,548
Let's see...

272
00:23:24,012 --> 00:23:25,736
It looks good on you...

273
00:23:25,397 --> 00:23:26,701
Get that away from me!

274
00:23:28,664 --> 00:23:30,066
Oh, you like it...

275
00:23:30,517 --> 00:23:32,712
Don't make me repeat myself!

276
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,007
I won't permit this
so you two give it up!

277
00:23:38,747 --> 00:23:45,312
Grandpa...I was going to do that...
But I'm pregnant...

278
00:23:46,213 --> 00:23:47,646
What?!

279
00:23:49,044 --> 00:23:55,165
Pregnant?
Congratulations!!

280
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:58,293
What...

281
00:24:03,012 --> 00:24:05,111
Grandpa, we're here...

282
00:24:05,521 --> 00:24:07,199
What are you guys doing here?

283
00:24:09,973 --> 00:24:11,976
We have something to tell you.

284
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,892
Grandpa, a baby is...

285
00:24:15,892 --> 00:24:17,576
I know I know!!

286
00:24:18,203 --> 00:24:24,414
Is that something to be proud of?!!
Problems after problems...

287
00:24:25,224 --> 00:24:28,390
I thought you would be the
happiest about it...

288
00:24:29,105 --> 00:24:32,819
You kept pushing Hae-chan to get
pregnant, aren't you happy?

289
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:38,228
What...is Hae-chan really pregnant?

290
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:42,249
What?
A baby...so, that's...really?

291
00:24:42,486 --> 00:24:44,680
Yes, I'm 5 weeks pregnant.

292
00:24:45,382 --> 00:24:49,125
Oh, dear, it's you
double lucky day.

293
00:24:55,425 --> 00:24:57,958
Oh, you should've just been like
this from the start...

294
00:24:57,958 --> 00:25:00,842
So, Bong-gyu, where do you want
to go for your honeymoon?

295
00:25:00,842 --> 00:25:04,148
That's right...I'll send you
somewhere nice, so just tell me!

296
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,814
We've already decided.

297
00:25:07,814 --> 00:25:08,868
Where?

298
00:25:09,728 --> 00:25:10,908
America.

299
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,097
What?

300
00:25:16,861 --> 00:25:20,986
Are you planning to see your mother?

301
00:25:22,407 --> 00:25:25,600
Grandpa..
Please, don't hate her.

302
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,222
Okay, I know..

303
00:25:27,574 --> 00:25:31,472
If you insist on seeing her,
end your relationship with me!

304
00:25:32,612 --> 00:25:33,403
Please...

305
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:02,659
Grandpa.

306
00:26:02,935 --> 00:26:04,106
What?

307
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:11,922
After finding out I was pregnant,
all I can think about is

308
00:26:11,922 --> 00:26:15,979
what is good or bad for the baby...

309
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,553
That's expected out of a mother.

310
00:26:21,066 --> 00:26:26,000
Mother is leaving tomorrow.

311
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:29,800
What's that to me?

312
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,104
Grandpa, I don't know well but...

313
00:26:34,057 --> 00:26:36,890
I thought about how it would feel if

314
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,984
I couldn't see my children
for over 20 years...

315
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:47,676
I wish you would permit her
to come to

316
00:26:48,197 --> 00:26:52,725
Bong-gyu's wedding for
Bong-gyu's sake.

317
00:26:52,725 --> 00:26:57,625
She would be so happy and
so grateful to you...

318
00:27:12,605 --> 00:27:15,144
Why did you do that?
You know how he is.

319
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:26,002
The moment I saw her, I knew she
was my mother...

320
00:27:27,385 --> 00:27:33,363
It was strange because I felt like I
had just met her yesterday...

321
00:27:35,732 --> 00:27:38,318
Even though I don't have
any memory of seeing her...

322
00:27:42,565 --> 00:27:47,140
I want to leave her some
good memories...

323
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,066
Your mother's leaving tomorrow...

324
00:28:09,283 --> 00:28:11,037
Are you really not going to
see her off?

325
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:13,341
Why would I...

326
00:28:13,603 --> 00:28:14,814
Don't be like that...

327
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,655
Let's just go and at least say
goodbye, huh?

328
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:20,060
Forget it, I'm not going.

329
00:28:20,361 --> 00:28:22,903
Oh, you heart of stone!
Stubborn mule!

330
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:24,235
What?

331
00:28:25,388 --> 00:28:29,344
Then at least take me.

332
00:28:33,017 --> 00:28:34,381
I don't want to.

333
00:28:44,794 --> 00:28:47,349
Oh, my stomach keeps hurting.

334
00:28:48,755 --> 00:28:51,455
If it hurts, why would you go out
to the airport?

335
00:28:52,577 --> 00:28:55,590
If she leaves now, who knows
when she'll come back.

336
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:09,644
Go on.

337
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:11,748
You're really are not going in?

338
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:14,905
No.

339
00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:42,505
Are you waiting for Sang-young?

340
00:29:43,857 --> 00:29:45,455
Oh, no...

341
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:50,047
You really didn't have to come out.
It's just trouble for you.

342
00:29:50,047 --> 00:29:52,643
No, of course I would've taken you.

343
00:29:54,784 --> 00:29:59,190
Thanks.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

344
00:29:59,488 --> 00:30:01,356
Okay.

345
00:30:17,127 --> 00:30:18,496
Oh, you're here?

346
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,098
She went to the restroom...
Sang-young didn't come?

347
00:30:24,098 --> 00:30:26,093
Yeah, he had something to do...

348
00:30:29,336 --> 00:30:31,249
I know it's late but congratulations.

349
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:33,843
You look really happy!

350
00:30:36,438 --> 00:30:37,700
Thanks!

351
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,330
Bong-man...

352
00:31:30,194 --> 00:31:32,333
Thanks for coming out.

353
00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:40,602
I'll be going.

354
00:31:42,572 --> 00:31:43,773
Mom!

355
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:52,057
I wasn't mad about you coming.

356
00:31:53,118 --> 00:32:02,830
It was just that you were late...
That's why I was mad.

357
00:32:28,202 --> 00:32:32,559
Aren't you coming to Bong-gyu's wedding?

358
00:33:01,951 --> 00:33:03,494
<i>Dear Bong-gyu...</i>

359
00:33:03,662 --> 00:33:08,032
<i>You're already in junior high school,
but I just can't believe it.</i>

360
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:13,385
<i>How handsome must you look in
your uniform...</i>

361
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:18,314
<i>The Bong-gyu and Bong-man that is
in my heart has grown so much...</i>

362
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:21,246
<i>Do the two of you look like
each other?</i>

363
00:33:48,962 --> 00:33:52,035
You couldn't wait for the elevator.

364
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:56,834
Why waste time waiting for it.
Come up!

365
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:03,195
It was just yesterday you were
so against it but I guess

366
00:34:03,436 --> 00:34:06,891
you're really impatient to see
your new grand-daughter-in-law...

367
00:34:07,393 --> 00:34:09,123
There's still a lot of time...

368
00:34:11,569 --> 00:34:13,299
What's wrong with going early?

369
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:17,687
Anyway, the two of us are left now...

370
00:34:17,991 --> 00:34:19,214
What do you mean two?

371
00:34:19,426 --> 00:34:22,036
When Hae-chan has her baby,
they're going to move in!

372
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:24,064
What???

373
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:54,336
Hae-won...I can't recognize you.

374
00:34:54,617 --> 00:34:58,808
How's my make-up?
It's got to look good.

375
00:34:58,808 --> 00:35:00,718
You're beautiful.

376
00:35:01,243 --> 00:35:02,474
Really?

377
00:35:03,993 --> 00:35:05,406
You're going to live well, right?

378
00:35:06,357 --> 00:35:07,387
Of course...

379
00:35:07,387 --> 00:35:09,191
Do you know how hard it was
to get here?

380
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:13,147
But, I'm thirsty.

381
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:16,840
I guess you're nervouse...
Wait a little bit...

382
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:32,391
You're beautiful, Hae-won...
This is your last chance.

383
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:37,138
Even now, we can do what they
did in the movie "Graduation."

384
00:35:37,138 --> 00:35:40,993
Just do your job as the MC!

385
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:45,708
Fine...

386
00:36:09,096 --> 00:36:10,478
I'm sorry..

387
00:36:10,689 --> 00:36:13,073
I just wanted to see their faces...

388
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,450
You came all the way here,
why leave!

389
00:36:19,764 --> 00:36:21,517
Stay for the wedding.

390
00:36:21,766 --> 00:36:24,520
And when they go to visit,
take good care of them...

391
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:40,579
Mother, I'm glad you're here...

392
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,288
Grandma...

393
00:38:01,682 --> 00:38:03,386
Oh, you're here...

394
00:38:03,596 --> 00:38:05,230
Please give us some sausages...

395
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:06,041
Sure,

396
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:09,054
but what brings both
of you out here?

397
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:10,707
Come on in...

398
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:13,621
Here...

399
00:38:13,621 --> 00:38:15,313
Oh, it looks good...

400
00:38:19,216 --> 00:38:22,480
Grandma...I'm having a baby.

401
00:38:22,721 --> 00:38:26,116
What? really?

402
00:38:26,747 --> 00:38:31,544
Oh, I'm so proud, so proud...

403
00:38:34,558 --> 00:38:37,163
All this time you've been
having a fit about

404
00:38:37,163 --> 00:38:39,459
whether you were going to live
together or not...

405
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:41,672
but it seems you two still did
everything you needed...

406
00:38:44,775 --> 00:38:47,141
Oh, that's great.
This is just great.

407
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:53,991
Now that you're going to have a baby,
your loyalty to each other

408
00:38:53,991 --> 00:38:58,660
will grow stronger and you'll learn
how precious you are to each other...

409
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,565
And you'll think one more time
before you fight...

410
00:39:03,338 --> 00:39:04,810
Be good to Hae-chan.

411
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:06,565
Yes, Grandma!

412
00:39:13,276 --> 00:39:14,501
Sang-young!

413
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,543
You finished your class?

414
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:22,890
Noon, it's been a long time.

415
00:39:25,183 --> 00:39:28,862
Hae-chan, I have somewhere I need
to stop by, I'll wait for you at home.

416
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:32,204
Noon, will you take Hae-chan home?

417
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:36,242
See you later.

418
00:39:45,955 --> 00:39:48,571
So, are you 29 now?

419
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:57,717
Well...at first I couldn't believe I was
18 and I was a little embarrassed...

420
00:39:58,318 --> 00:40:02,211
But now, I miss it sometimes...

421
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:06,038
You had a hard time because of me.

422
00:40:06,038 --> 00:40:11,827
No..I saw the documentary we
made together.

423
00:40:13,067 --> 00:40:14,803
I didn't do anything.

424
00:40:14,803 --> 00:40:22,463
No...after the accident, I caused
a lot people trouble...

425
00:40:23,415 --> 00:40:26,449
But at least I made a friend!!

426
00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:35,621
I had lost my dream and confidence...

427
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:40,387
But you're the person who
helped me find it again.

428
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:45,937
I was able to go to film school
with you, make a documentary,

429
00:40:45,937 --> 00:40:48,649
and be the recipient
of passionate love...

430
00:40:50,976 --> 00:40:53,638
I borrowed money from Sang-young
when we were in Ahnmyun-do...

431
00:40:54,831 --> 00:40:57,767
It's okay..he's got a lot money...

432
00:40:58,268 --> 00:41:01,795
But, I remember you two
talking badly about me...

433
00:41:02,114 --> 00:41:05,208
I'm not that pretty and I don't have
that nice of a body?

434
00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:11,729
He started it...
But, it's a little strange...

435
00:41:12,118 --> 00:41:18,588
You're not like the old Hae-chan
that I knew, but an adult...

436
00:41:18,951 --> 00:41:21,996
Hey, that makes me sad...

437
00:41:22,425 --> 00:41:28,815
I don't know about anyone else but
you promised to always see me as 18!

438
00:41:29,575 --> 00:41:32,001
Just the way Howl was able to
recognize sophie!

439
00:41:35,378 --> 00:41:36,700
Let's go!

440
00:41:46,573 --> 00:41:49,024
<i>Hae-chan, who came to a
strange world,</i>

441
00:41:50,185 --> 00:41:52,749
<i>has returned to her own world.</i>

442
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:58,587
<i>But like that night we saw the
movie together...</i>

443
00:42:00,549 --> 00:42:03,686
<i>I'm going to always remember Hae-chan</i>

444
00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:08,791
<i>as the happy magic that I met in
my adolescence.</i>

445
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:29,151
Hey...this is our story..

446
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:34,158
I'm Bong-su and Hae-chan is
Hae-young?

447
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:39,467
Oh, she has no imagination...

448
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:48,811
Wait...this isn't our story...

449
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:58,326
What? I'm the patient waiting
for death.

450
00:43:00,976 --> 00:43:03,639
Scene No. 57

451
00:43:05,102 --> 00:43:09,464
<i>At the park...Hae-young waits for Bong-su...</i>

452
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:12,955
<i>For five hours she hasn't heard
from him and he hasn't come...</i>

453
00:43:13,996 --> 00:43:15,801
<i>What's going on?</i>

454
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,324
Scene 121...hallway of hospital.

455
00:43:20,779 --> 00:43:24,263
<i>After not hearing from Bong-su
in three months,</i>

456
00:43:24,263 --> 00:43:27,176
<i>she reaces to the hospital...</i>

457
00:43:28,055 --> 00:43:31,573
Bong-su!
You dummy!

458
00:43:31,573 --> 00:43:33,535
Why didn't you contact me?

459
00:43:33,747 --> 00:43:36,099
How can you go and die on me like this?

460
00:43:36,468 --> 00:43:38,493
Our relationship has ended?

461
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,913
What?

462
00:43:49,767 --> 00:44:07,488
l...l...Lo...Lo...Lo...

463
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:13,708
Bong-su...

464
00:44:14,448 --> 00:44:17,624
Why can't you say that
you love me...

465
00:44:18,264 --> 00:44:23,442
Is it harder than dying...

466
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:37,286
What?
Why would I die...?

467
00:44:43,337 --> 00:44:44,458
Hey, what are you doing?

468
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:49,545
What?
Are you crying?

469
00:44:49,574 --> 00:44:51,597
Who's crying...

470
00:44:53,247 --> 00:44:55,862
That's my screenplay.

471
00:44:56,475 --> 00:44:59,754
Hey...when did you write this?

472
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:10,806
Oh, while I was at Ahnmyun-do...
I wrote it while missing you.

473
00:45:11,447 --> 00:45:13,952
You hated me so much
you wanted to kill me off?

474
00:45:13,952 --> 00:45:15,265
You read it all?

475
00:45:15,834 --> 00:45:17,726
What do you think?
Was it good?

476
00:45:18,337 --> 00:45:21,132
It was okay...

477
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,569
But why couldnt the male lead

478
00:45:26,832 --> 00:45:30,026
not say he loved her even
as he was dying?

479
00:45:30,547 --> 00:45:34,863
Well...was it because I was thinking
of someone while writing it?

480
00:45:35,136 --> 00:45:39,819
You know men like that...
They'll regret it after they die...

481
00:45:49,129 --> 00:45:54,590
I Lo..... I lo.....

482
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:57,401
Hey, is that something that
has to be said...

483
00:46:00,527 --> 00:46:01,841
Who said that?

484
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:07,219
Anyway, I don't like the ending..
It's too dramatic...

485
00:46:08,981 --> 00:46:13,558
Yeah, I wasn't crazy about it either..
Move over.

486
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:25,119
Hey...let's go out and practice
Lamaze breathing...I learned it today.

487
00:46:25,054 --> 00:46:26,082
Forget it.
I'll do it later.

488
00:46:26,082 --> 00:46:27,815
I better finish this.

489
00:46:28,424 --> 00:46:30,267
Stop doing it and let's go out
and practice.

490
00:46:30,267 --> 00:46:32,911
What's more important,
the baby or work?

491
00:46:32,948 --> 00:46:36,095
Why are you being such a nag?
Stop nagging and go out!

492
00:46:40,644 --> 00:46:41,635
Hey!

493
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:44,419
How can you just turn it off!
I lost everything!

494
00:46:44,698 --> 00:46:46,940
It's because you don't listen to me!

495
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,424
You want something bad to
happen to the baby again?

496
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,042
Hey, how can you say that?

497
00:46:57,873 --> 00:46:59,519
No..it's just that..

498
00:46:59,807 --> 00:47:02,641
It's because you're being
so stubborn...

499
00:47:27,569 --> 00:47:31,377
Hae-chan..let's go out
for a minute.

500
00:47:32,075 --> 00:47:33,048
Where?

501
00:47:36,214 --> 00:47:37,614
It'll only be a minute.

502
00:47:37,835 --> 00:47:39,378
What's wrong with him?

503
00:47:42,138 --> 00:47:44,038
Why suddenly did you
want to come here?

504
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:49,159
Do you remember how you got
caught jumping the wall

505
00:47:49,962 --> 00:47:51,465
and had to do squat walks?

506
00:47:51,954 --> 00:47:53,897
You pulled that cord on purpose,
didn't you?

507
00:47:54,116 --> 00:47:55,718
No, it wasn't on purpose.

508
00:47:56,971 --> 00:47:58,963
But, I'm a little scared...

509
00:48:00,196 --> 00:48:02,601
What do you mean, I'm here...

510
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:04,512
What's wrong with you...

511
00:48:12,918 --> 00:48:14,801
That time when I went to
Ahnmyun-do looking for you...

512
00:48:15,095 --> 00:48:19,320
The tree we had buried our
time capsule udner was gone...

513
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,842
This has to buried for it
to take effect...

514
00:48:31,806 --> 00:48:36,690
If we do this, you'll be mine until
you become like dust, right?

515
00:48:39,675 --> 00:48:46,527
Well...if this tree doesn't get cut...
then maybe...

516
00:48:55,069 --> 00:49:02,027
Hae-chan, for you, I'm going to

517
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:06,068
reduce the number of times
I'll get mad...

518
00:49:06,845 --> 00:49:09,860
And I'll quit smoking for you...

519
00:49:10,742 --> 00:49:20,010
And for the first time, I told the
world that I, too, have a woman...

520
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:28,159
But is there still something left
that you want to hear from me?

521
00:49:30,413 --> 00:49:36,029
No...what' so important
about words.

522
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,165
It's more important to confirm it
once in a while.

523
00:49:39,996 --> 00:49:42,822
So, you made all that trouble to
confirm it, didn't you?

524
00:49:43,421 --> 00:49:44,924
You never know.

525
00:49:44,924 --> 00:49:48,379
That's a secret only the heavens
and earth will know.

526
00:49:50,401 --> 00:49:53,677
Are you sure you didn't
completely dupe me?

527
00:49:54,697 --> 00:49:56,080
How did you know?

528
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,438
What?
Come over here!

529
00:49:59,655 --> 00:50:01,391
Hey...stop where you are!

530
00:50:20,171 --> 00:50:21,133
<i>Bong-man...</i>

531
00:50:21,701 --> 00:50:26,229
<i>I think I was able ot
realize this only after</i>

532
00:50:27,001 --> 00:50:29,084
<i>I went back to being 18 years old...</i>

533
00:50:29,084 --> 00:50:31,609
<i>I could never leave you.</i>

534
00:50:32,088 --> 00:50:36,717
<i>And I thought I had given up
my dreams because of you...</i>

535
00:50:37,339 --> 00:50:42,045
<i>But the truth is,
it was only an excuse...</i>

536
00:50:44,396 --> 00:50:45,813
<i>Hae-chan...</i>

537
00:50:45,988 --> 00:50:49,896
<i>If you hadn't gone back to being 18,</i>

538
00:50:49,896 --> 00:50:56,264
<i>I wouldn't have ever found our
precious memories</i>

539
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,148
<i>of the past 11 years.</i>

540
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:03,014
<i>And I wouldn't have known that
you are that one person</i>

541
00:51:04,078 --> 00:51:06,119
<i> I could never exchange.</i>

542
00:52:20,635 --> 00:52:23,707
<i>Although everyone was happy that
Hae-young had her memory back,</i>

543
00:52:23,967 --> 00:52:29,575
<i>the truth is, it was Hae-young's
plot to test Bong-su's love.</i>

544
00:53:49,414 --> 00:53:53,189
Hello?
Yes?

545
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,287
I know what happened with the other
script was a little disgraceful...

546
00:53:59,287 --> 00:54:01,381
But this screenplay is really great.

547
00:54:01,695 --> 00:54:06,505
Director Jang Jin-ho really wants to start
shoot the film as soon as possible.

548
00:54:07,049 --> 00:54:10,776
Thank you...but have the
actors been chosen?

549
00:54:10,776 --> 00:54:14,240
I would really like Sang-young
to take the leading male role.

550
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,661
It's not because he's my husband..

551
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:17,783
The reason why we've decided to take
on this project is because we were

552
00:54:17,783 --> 00:54:22,234
interested in the screenplay, it has
nothing to do with Kang Sang-young.

553
00:54:22,952 --> 00:54:27,229
However, I wrote this screenplay
with Kang Sang-young as the model...

554
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:31,435
I understand what you mean...
Why don't we just think about it?

555
00:54:32,706 --> 00:54:37,273
Auntie, couldn't you give him just
one more chance?

556
00:54:38,768 --> 00:54:41,060
I read the screenplay
on my way here...

557
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:45,305
And I honestly believe he would be
the best person for the role...

558
00:54:59,992 --> 00:55:07,633
First, you wash the beans well
and lightly cook...

559
00:55:32,316 --> 00:55:34,943
Hey! how can you spill all this!

560
00:55:35,494 --> 00:55:38,496
Oh, you're home?
I was trying to make some beans.

561
00:55:40,328 --> 00:55:44,024
Bong-man, I got great news today.

562
00:55:44,266 --> 00:55:46,780
What is it?
Are we having a girl?

563
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:49,132
Is our baby a princess?

564
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:56,185
No...they're going to make my
screenplay into a movie!!

565
00:55:56,645 --> 00:56:00,127
Really?
That's great!

566
00:56:00,127 --> 00:56:01,815
Congratulations!

567
00:56:01,815 --> 00:56:04,647
But, do you know who the leading
male role will go to?

568
00:56:04,647 --> 00:56:05,677
Who?

569
00:56:05,677 --> 00:56:08,382
The top star Korea,
Kang Sang-young!

570
00:56:11,489 --> 00:56:14,821
Hey...no..
I'm going to start a new play soon.

571
00:56:15,482 --> 00:56:20,721
Hey, what are you talking about?
I told them it had to be you.

572
00:56:20,721 --> 00:56:25,416
Why did you do that?
Did I tell you I wanted to do a film?

573
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:30,912
No, but it's our story and I
fashioned it after you!

574
00:56:31,236 --> 00:56:32,998
Still, I don't want to.

575
00:56:36,027 --> 00:56:39,489
Well, then, we have no choice.

576
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:47,412
I better quit too...
Baby...mommy's sorry...

577
00:56:47,826 --> 00:56:51,077
With the money from the screenplay,
I was going to buy you

578
00:56:51,396 --> 00:56:56,814
lots of pretty clothes and
lots of yummy food...

579
00:57:02,143 --> 00:57:07,806
Hae-young...don't go...
I'm scared.

580
00:57:11,757 --> 00:57:13,171
Bong-su...

581
00:57:20,784 --> 00:57:22,073
Director!

582
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,242
yes, what is it?

583
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:27,922
Oh, Ji-young's expression
was a little off...

584
00:57:27,922 --> 00:57:31,282
When she turns around to
look at him, she needs to do it

585
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:33,730
with more emotion in her eyes.

586
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:37,357
Didn't it look emotional?
It was great...

587
00:57:38,161 --> 00:57:46,172
And, instead of kissing here...
Wouldn't a hug be more natural?

588
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,910
What are you talking about?

589
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:51,575
It says right here they should
kiss on the script...

590
00:57:53,394 --> 00:57:55,085
Let's go with the script.

591
00:57:55,708 --> 00:58:00,325
A script can be changed at anytime...

592
00:58:00,568 --> 00:58:01,807
Oh, it's okay...

593
00:58:01,807 --> 00:58:04,691
We'll go with the script...okay?

594
00:58:07,353 --> 00:58:11,644
Let's make it real, Sang-young!

595
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:17,668
Okay, standby...cue!

596
00:58:34,153 --> 00:58:36,098
Oh, my stomach.

597
00:58:37,071 --> 00:58:40,053
Is the baby coming?
Oh, my stomach...

598
00:58:41,265 --> 00:58:42,206
Hae-chan...

599
00:58:43,117 --> 00:58:45,090
Oh, it hurts...oh my stomach...

600
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:47,123
Oh, my stomach...

601
00:59:02,809 --> 00:59:04,537
Here, hold this...

602
00:59:04,537 --> 00:59:07,316
Play with it...
I'll be right back...

603
00:59:12,114 --> 00:59:14,366
Don't cry...dont' cry...baby..

604
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:25,511
Okay, okay...

605
00:59:33,793 --> 00:59:42,536
Oh, it's hot...
Don't cry...oh, it's hot...

606
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:58,182
Jin-sol, please help your mom and dad, huh?

607
01:00:03,628 --> 01:00:06,603
You can't take care of one baby?
Why are you making her cry?!

608
01:00:08,211 --> 01:00:08,855
What is it?

609
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:12,511
You burned the diapers?
Can't you do one thing right?!!

610
01:00:24,393 --> 01:00:25,893
I want to be a widow.
