A Dramatic Fantasy

"This entertainment, set on the eve
of the Second World War,

7
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,100
does not claim to be
a study of manners.

Its characters are purely fictitious."

Who shun love whither it does range

11
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:10,452
Cease to be so bitter

12
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,025
Is it a crime to change?

13
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:15,424
If Cupid was given wings

14
00:02:15,596 --> 00:02:19,396
Was it not to flitter?"

15
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,613
<i>You're listening to Radio-Cité.
It's exactly 10:00 p.m.</i>

16
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:36,773
We're here
at Le Bourget airfield,

17
00:02:37,118 --> 00:02:42,181
working our way through the crowd
that's turned out to welcome

18
00:02:42,357 --> 00:02:44,882
the famous aviator André Jurieu,

19
00:02:45,193 --> 00:02:48,356
who has just performed
a tremendous feat:

20
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:51,692
Crossing the Atlantic in 23 hours!

21
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:54,232
A record comparable...
Watch the cord!

22
00:02:54,402 --> 00:02:59,237
A record comparable only
to the one set a dozen years ago

23
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:00,840
by Charles Lindbergh.

24
00:03:01,008 --> 00:03:03,203
The crowd's moving!

25
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:14,587
Jurieu has arrived safe and sound,
executing a magnificent landing.

26
00:03:14,922 --> 00:03:19,222
The crowd is invading the airfield
and crashing the police cordon.

27
00:04:02,937 --> 00:04:07,431
The minister couldn't make it, but
he asked me to convey his admiration

28
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:09,906
and sincerest congratulations.

29
00:04:10,077 --> 00:04:12,011
It's really the plane's doing.

30
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,842
Not at all.
It's a fine achievement.

31
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:16,683
Octave!

32
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:23,552
André! Am I ever happy!
Not about your flight!

33
00:04:23,724 --> 00:04:26,454
It's you I'm glad to see!
It is you, isn't it?

34
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:29,790
Is she here?

35
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:33,627
She didn't come?

36
00:04:35,102 --> 00:04:37,070
- She didn't come?
- She couldn't make it.

37
00:04:37,405 --> 00:04:40,602
But I did this all for her!

38
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:41,799
I know.

39
00:04:42,143 --> 00:04:45,112
Mr. André Jurieu,
a few words for our listeners.

40
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:47,573
Just a few words.
- What can I say?

41
00:04:47,748 --> 00:04:50,717
You just flew solo over the Atlantic.

42
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:55,549
You must have something to say.
Anything. You must be happy.

43
00:04:57,225 --> 00:04:59,318
I'm very unhappy.

44
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:01,552
I've never been
so disappointed in my life.

45
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,627
I made this flight for a woman.

46
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,165
She's not here to welcome me.

47
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:10,031
She didn't even bother.

48
00:05:10,771 --> 00:05:13,103
I tell her this publicly:
She's disloyal!

49
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:18,675
<i>The great aviator has performed
a stunning feat.</i>

50
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:22,577
<i>But remember,
it's cost him a great deal of effort,</i>

51
00:05:22,783 --> 00:05:24,410
<i>and he's exhausted.</i>

52
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:26,047
My purse, Lisette.

53
00:05:26,387 --> 00:05:27,752
<i>He can't really talk.</i>

54
00:05:27,922 --> 00:05:31,358
<i>But we have here with us
an engineer from Caudron.</i>

55
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,258
Jurieu's aircraft
was manufactured by Caudron.

56
00:05:37,431 --> 00:05:41,527
It's a standard model with
a 200-horsepower Renault engine.

57
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:46,672
The copilot's seat was replaced
by an extra fuel tank.

58
00:05:48,809 --> 00:05:52,370
You're a hero, but you just behaved
like a spoiled kid.

59
00:05:52,547 --> 00:05:54,947
If Christine won't see you,
serves you right.

60
00:05:55,316 --> 00:05:58,615
- I couldn't face her now.
- Get some sleep first.

61
00:05:59,921 --> 00:06:02,947
Tell me, Lisette,
how long have you been married?

62
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:05,885
- Almost two years, Madame.
- That's true.

63
00:06:06,794 --> 00:06:09,820
How time flies! Are you happy?

64
00:06:09,997 --> 00:06:11,965
My husband's no trouble.

65
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:15,159
He's in service at the château
and I'm in Paris.

66
00:06:15,803 --> 00:06:17,395
With you, Madame, I'm very happy.

67
00:06:17,738 --> 00:06:20,605
- Do you have lovers?
- That's a big word.

68
00:06:20,775 --> 00:06:24,074
Of course you do.
Octave, for example.

69
00:06:25,112 --> 00:06:27,342
Give me my evening lipstick.

70
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:30,913
- I don't know where it is.
- Oh, yes, you do.

71
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,356
I don't like it. Too purple.

72
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,321
It doesn't look natural.

73
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:44,726
What's natural nowadays?

74
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,401
And your lovers...
What do they say to you?

75
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,696
Not much.

76
00:06:51,372 --> 00:06:53,806
- Do they kiss you?
- If I let them.

77
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:56,802
- Do they hold your hand?
- It depends.

78
00:06:57,578 --> 00:06:59,375
- And then what?
- Then what?

79
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:03,210
Same old story: The more you give,
the more they want.

80
00:07:04,852 --> 00:07:05,819
My scarf.

81
00:07:07,855 --> 00:07:10,619
Nothing doing.
Men are all the same.

82
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:15,554
What about friendship?

83
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:17,659
Friendship with a man?

84
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,193
When pigs have wings!

85
00:07:24,972 --> 00:07:27,998
- Good evening, Madame.
- Good evening, Lisette.

86
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:38,511
- Mitzi...
- Yes, Madame?

87
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:41,314
- Did you take the dogs out?
- Yes, Madame.

88
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:44,455
- Where is Monsieur?
- In his study.

89
00:07:46,494 --> 00:07:48,519
<i>Calm has returned
to Le Bourget airfield.</i>

90
00:07:48,696 --> 00:07:52,359
<i>The crowd is breaking up peacefully.</i>

91
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:54,831
<i>The victory reception is over.</i>

92
00:07:55,002 --> 00:07:58,096
<i>We've just witnessed an event
that will go down...</i>

93
00:07:59,607 --> 00:08:02,508
- We're late, my dear.
- As usual.

94
00:08:03,444 --> 00:08:05,207
A new one?
- I got it today.

95
00:08:05,446 --> 00:08:08,745
It's a romantic Negress.
In perfect working order.

96
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,588
I prefer it to the radio.

97
00:08:18,726 --> 00:08:21,854
So, you heard
what André Jurieu said?

98
00:08:23,964 --> 00:08:28,162
I can well imagine what he thought.
He'd risked his life.

99
00:08:29,837 --> 00:08:31,930
How could you have refused him

100
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:36,132
that small token of affection

101
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,143
he must have
pleaded for so touchingly?

102
00:08:39,814 --> 00:08:41,873
He mistook it for love.

103
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:43,873
Men are so naïve.

104
00:08:44,418 --> 00:08:46,283
How happy that makes me!

105
00:08:47,188 --> 00:08:48,815
Thank you.
- It's nothing.

106
00:08:52,226 --> 00:08:56,026
Telling lies is such
a heavy weight to bear.

107
00:08:56,197 --> 00:08:58,392
Lies... Don't exaggerate.

108
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,110
Would you call me a liar?

109
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:15,279
I trust you completely.

110
00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:17,172
Do you?

111
00:09:19,386 --> 00:09:21,286
Excuse me a minute, my dear.

112
00:09:39,006 --> 00:09:40,769
Madame de Marras, please.

113
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:44,842
Is that you, Geneviève?
I must see you.

114
00:09:45,746 --> 00:09:47,213
Then come over now.

115
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:49,879
You're going out with Christine?

116
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,950
In the morning, then.

117
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:56,681
Not at 10:00. Yes, 11:00.
Be realistic.

118
00:10:03,097 --> 00:10:04,962
<i>La Chesnaye must be in a state.</i>

119
00:10:05,132 --> 00:10:07,726
- So why does he have a wireless?
- Progress.

120
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:10,598
You call that progress?
I call it exhibitionism.

121
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:15,069
I feel sorry for Christine,
because she's a foreigner.

122
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:16,834
And because
you have a crush on her.

123
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:21,413
No, but it must be hard
to leave the life she had in Austria.

124
00:10:21,582 --> 00:10:25,040
An artist's life. Her father
was a famous conductor in Vienna.

125
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:29,219
And to move to Paris
where nobody speaks her language.

126
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,416
- Why did she marry? I didn't!
- Oh, you!

127
00:10:32,593 --> 00:10:34,356
What's on your mind?

128
00:10:35,229 --> 00:10:38,528
A maxim by Chamfort.
It could almost be a precept.

129
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:40,098
What does he say?

130
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:44,670
"Love as it exists in society
is merely the mingling of two whims

131
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,670
and the contact of two skins."

132
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:52,669
If I understand you right,
you want to leave me.

133
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:56,544
Last night I suddenly decided
to be worthy of my wife.

134
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:01,485
I see the family picture: Knitting,
the slippers and lots of children.

135
00:11:01,655 --> 00:11:05,751
Exactly. I sort of feel now
that I've had my fun.

136
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:09,428
All this because of the radio
and André Jurieu.

137
00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:11,394
How perceptive you are!

138
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:13,494
Let's say we do split up.

139
00:11:14,134 --> 00:11:16,602
What would change with Christine?

140
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,101
Why, everything.

141
00:11:20,007 --> 00:11:22,305
Nothing!
She's remained so Austrian.

142
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:25,377
A Parisian woman would understand.
Not her.

143
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:30,781
If she found out, it's not
our affair she'd hold against you,

144
00:11:31,218 --> 00:11:34,051
but the fact that you lied
from the start.

145
00:11:34,255 --> 00:11:36,246
She'd never forgive you.

146
00:11:36,657 --> 00:11:37,817
I know.

147
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,990
Believe it or not,
you mean a lot to me.

148
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,360
I don't know if it's love
or force of habit,

149
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,862
but if you leave me, I'll be very
unhappy, and I don't want to be.

150
00:11:51,138 --> 00:11:53,038
My dear, I'm so sorry.

151
00:11:53,574 --> 00:11:57,066
I didn't intend to hurt you,
but put yourself in my shoes.

152
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:01,537
A good thing you're weak.

153
00:12:02,383 --> 00:12:04,044
I take after my father.

154
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:07,449
The poor man
had such a complicated existence.

155
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:10,719
Let's go to lunch.
- With pleasure.

156
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,457
I don't know if it's
this sentimental talk,

157
00:12:13,794 --> 00:12:15,261
but I'm famished!

158
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,878
No, old man! Go on if you want,
but I'm walking home.

159
00:12:47,995 --> 00:12:50,361
- Don't leave me alone.
- Damn your problems!

160
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:54,831
Since you got back,
you haven't stopped bending my ear.

161
00:12:55,002 --> 00:12:57,163
And now you drive us into a ditch.

162
00:12:57,338 --> 00:12:59,067
Thanks, but no thanks!

163
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:00,263
Are you hurt?

164
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:05,071
I wonder if I'm not dead.
I hit the roof like a feather.

165
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,710
It's rattled my brains.

166
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:11,510
Want to kill yourself over Christine?
Go ahead, but without me.

167
00:13:11,852 --> 00:13:13,479
- Understand...
- I do. You're nuts!

168
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:16,451
- So I'm nuts!
- Get help and get off my back.

169
00:13:16,824 --> 00:13:19,725
You'd gladly see me put away.
You love her, too.

170
00:13:20,094 --> 00:13:21,959
Sure I do, in my own way.

171
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:25,121
So you can't have her
like a glass of wine.

172
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:29,134
Get this:
She's like a sister to me.

173
00:13:29,303 --> 00:13:30,964
We grew up together.

174
00:13:31,138 --> 00:13:35,006
Her father, old Stiller, wasn't just
the greatest of conductors.

175
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:37,507
He was also the best of men.

176
00:13:37,845 --> 00:13:41,804
When I went to study music
with him in Salzburg,

177
00:13:41,982 --> 00:13:44,075
he treated me like a son.

178
00:13:44,218 --> 00:13:46,186
I never got to show him my gratitude.

179
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,552
Now I can. He's not here to look
after his daughter anymore.

180
00:13:50,758 --> 00:13:54,319
So I can and will look after her.
She needs looking after.

181
00:13:54,495 --> 00:13:59,523
She's a foreigner among people
who don't speak her language.

182
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:03,567
If you want to make her happy,
let her come with me.

183
00:14:03,737 --> 00:14:05,466
Because I love her.

184
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:08,301
Seeing her with that idiot
La Chesnaye!

185
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:11,035
Him and his hunts,
château and mechanical birds!

186
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:12,974
A two-timing snob!

187
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,513
He may be a snob,
but he's got his feet on the ground.

188
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:18,480
Your head's in the clouds.

189
00:14:18,652 --> 00:14:21,450
You put your foot in your mouth,
like on the radio.

190
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:24,552
At Le Bourget when you got back.

191
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:29,094
You're back from America
after breaking all sorts of records.

192
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:33,760
You get a hero's welcome.
Ministers make speeches.

193
00:14:34,101 --> 00:14:38,697
But instead of modestly and calmly
playing your part as a national hero,

194
00:14:39,106 --> 00:14:42,269
instead of giving radio audiences
the twaddle they expect,

195
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:46,573
you start sounding off
about Christine. In public!

196
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:48,681
No wonder she won't see you!

197
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:52,283
But I did it for her,
for her alone, understand?

198
00:14:52,653 --> 00:14:55,884
She encouraged me.
So when she didn't show up...

199
00:14:56,156 --> 00:15:00,183
She's a society woman,
and society has strict rules.

200
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,191
I don't need lectures.

201
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,295
I need Christine.

202
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,564
I love her, you know.

203
00:15:10,838 --> 00:15:13,568
If I don't see her again, I'll die.

204
00:15:16,376 --> 00:15:17,468
You'll see her again.

205
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:20,138
- Think so?
- Sure you will.

206
00:15:20,614 --> 00:15:21,706
Leave it to me.

207
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:25,314
So, Mr. Octave!

208
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,851
No hello?

209
00:15:30,824 --> 00:15:32,189
Fresh as a rose.

210
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:35,556
But you look awful.
What's the matter?

211
00:15:35,963 --> 00:15:37,931
I bet it's your pilot friend again.

212
00:15:38,098 --> 00:15:41,124
What a nuisance!
Madame can't sleep at night.

213
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:43,792
Listen here. Do you trust me?

214
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:46,639
I'll settle it.
- Really?

215
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:48,775
Where have you been?

216
00:15:48,942 --> 00:15:50,671
I've been very busy.

217
00:15:50,844 --> 00:15:53,608
- Problems?
- I'll tell you later.

218
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,681
You came to see my wife?
Let me say good morning.

219
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,513
- What's that you got: A nightingale?
- A warbler.

220
00:16:00,721 --> 00:16:05,658
- Looks like the moths got to it.
- But it still sings every 20 seconds.

221
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:07,827
- I bet it does.
- Cynic.

222
00:16:08,962 --> 00:16:11,522
Where have you been all this time?

223
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,097
Were you away?

224
00:16:16,003 --> 00:16:17,231
May I?

225
00:16:18,705 --> 00:16:20,866
Good morning, my dear.
Sleep well?

226
00:16:21,642 --> 00:16:22,734
Say, Lisette.

227
00:16:26,413 --> 00:16:29,246
<i>- I got a letter from Shoemaker.
- Schumacher!</i>

228
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,918
Your husband. He says that
without her, my woods lack poetry,

229
00:16:34,688 --> 00:16:37,851
and his gamekeeper's job
seems utterly dreary.

230
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:40,687
He wants you to join him.

231
00:16:41,028 --> 00:16:45,522
And leave Madame?
Your lordship, I'd rather divorce.

232
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,129
Don't get melodramatic.

233
00:16:48,535 --> 00:16:51,095
Are you two done talking?

234
00:16:51,305 --> 00:16:53,967
Oh, yes,
you have a big secret for her.

235
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:55,039
You said it.

236
00:16:55,242 --> 00:16:57,176
- I'll leave you.
- About time, too.

237
00:16:57,344 --> 00:17:00,108
- Coming out to "La Colinière"?
- Maybe.

238
00:17:00,814 --> 00:17:02,679
What did I say?
Twenty seconds.

239
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:08,820
A cup of tea?

240
00:17:13,493 --> 00:17:16,053
A nice hot coffee
with bread and jam?

241
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,562
I'm not hungry.

242
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:20,359
Something's definitely out of order.

243
00:17:20,534 --> 00:17:23,594
I've never seen Mr. Octave
without an appetite.

244
00:17:24,137 --> 00:17:25,331
Won't you sit down?

245
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:29,108
Come now, tell me your secret.

246
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:31,869
- It's about André.
- Oh, no!

247
00:17:32,546 --> 00:17:34,810
- You know he wanted to die?
- That's just talk.

248
00:17:35,148 --> 00:17:36,706
Excuse me, but I was there.

249
00:17:37,884 --> 00:17:38,851
How could he?

250
00:17:39,186 --> 00:17:43,623
How? Why, in his car.
He tried to drive into a tree.

251
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,756
- And it's my fault?
- It sure is your fault.

252
00:17:47,127 --> 00:17:49,061
- I don't understand.
- Don't you?

253
00:17:49,363 --> 00:17:50,694
Listen, my dear.

254
00:17:51,164 --> 00:17:54,725
You throw yourself around people's
necks like a 12-year-old.

255
00:17:55,168 --> 00:17:57,295
You can do it with me.

256
00:17:57,471 --> 00:18:00,565
You'll always be
my little Salzburg girl.

257
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:04,277
But with others
it can be... awkward.

258
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:10,078
So, in Paris, you can't show a man
affection without...

259
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:14,719
So I'm to blame for everything?

260
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:17,584
Not everything. Just a few things.

261
00:18:18,592 --> 00:18:20,560
Must I apologize to your friend?

262
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:22,524
That's going a bit far.

263
00:18:22,696 --> 00:18:25,665
But you might...
invite him to "La Colinière."

264
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,867
You're so improper!

265
00:18:28,502 --> 00:18:30,527
In that case... I'm going.

266
00:18:30,704 --> 00:18:33,730
Good-bye. Or rather, farewell.

267
00:18:35,742 --> 00:18:37,733
- Where are you going?
- To see him.

268
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:41,404
You won't come out
to "La Colinière"?

269
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:43,276
I can't cut myself in two.

270
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:47,644
You silly thing!

271
00:18:48,322 --> 00:18:51,291
You foolish old dear!

272
00:18:52,592 --> 00:18:55,652
- So you'll invite him?
- I'll invite him.

273
00:18:55,829 --> 00:18:58,821
I don't want to be
the woman who drove to despair

274
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:02,058
the great hero,
the idol of the masses.

275
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:05,837
If his plane crashes,
they'll blame it on me.

276
00:19:06,206 --> 00:19:10,438
They'll call me a vamp,
public enemy, obstacle to progress.

277
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:13,905
They'll talk about "the foreigner."

278
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:16,913
And I hate martyrs.

279
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,480
And your husband...
what'll you do about him?

280
00:19:20,387 --> 00:19:22,252
That's your business.

281
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:25,949
I've done my part.
I wash my hands of the rest.

282
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:30,324
<i>- Christine, du bist ein Engel.
- An angel?</i>

283
00:19:31,365 --> 00:19:34,425
A dangerous angel,
but an angel nonetheless.

284
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:41,439
Cook me up two fried eggs,

285
00:19:41,608 --> 00:19:45,044
a big slice of ham and a glass
of white wine. I'm starved!

286
00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:48,906
- You'll put on weight.
- Don't worry. I'll deal with it.

287
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,356
All right, then.
I'll expect you at "La Colinière."

288
00:19:58,358 --> 00:20:00,349
You have your own car, fine.

289
00:20:01,395 --> 00:20:02,589
See you tomorrow.

290
00:20:05,098 --> 00:20:07,658
I'm in a terrible predicament.
- Geneviève.

291
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:11,429
- You know?
- Who doesn't? Sick and tired of her?

292
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:16,534
But you want to end it?
Leave it to me.

293
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,768
If you could.

294
00:20:17,944 --> 00:20:21,880
Easy enough. She's dying to get
married, so we'll get her hitched.

295
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:24,340
To whom? To you?

296
00:20:24,518 --> 00:20:28,010
Oh, me, you know,
I'm not the marrying kind.

297
00:20:28,188 --> 00:20:30,281
I'd be ready to sacrifice myself.

298
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:32,425
But only for Christine.
- I know.

299
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:35,127
But I need a favor in return.

300
00:20:35,662 --> 00:20:37,095
You need money?

301
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:42,928
You know you're a decent guy?

302
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,035
I take after my mother.

303
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,838
I want you to invite André Jurieu.

304
00:20:49,276 --> 00:20:50,641
To "La Colinière"?

305
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:53,502
That's a very serious request.

306
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:55,344
Serious?

307
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:58,575
I know what happened
between Christine and your friend.

308
00:20:58,819 --> 00:21:01,481
I'm not blind.
- Nothing happened.

309
00:21:02,122 --> 00:21:03,282
A good thing, too!

310
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:05,786
Then invite him.

311
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,228
I'd be taking a big risk.
I love Christine.

312
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:11,454
I'd never get over losing her.

313
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:16,730
You know what?
I feel like skedaddling.

314
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:21,072
I want to disappear down a hole.

315
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:22,333
What for?

316
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:26,946
So as not to have to figure out
what's right and what's wrong.

317
00:21:27,848 --> 00:21:32,581
The awful thing about life is this:
Everyone has their reasons.

318
00:21:32,853 --> 00:21:34,582
Of course they do.

319
00:21:34,754 --> 00:21:37,314
And I'm all
for their free expression.

320
00:21:37,657 --> 00:21:40,319
I'm against barriers and walls.

321
00:21:40,961 --> 00:21:43,122
And that's why I'll invite André.

322
00:21:43,597 --> 00:21:46,566
- Is it the right thing to do?
- I have faith in Christine.

323
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:49,795
If she loves Jurieu,
separating them won't stop her.

324
00:21:50,136 --> 00:21:53,264
They might as well
see each other and talk it over.

325
00:21:54,241 --> 00:21:58,610
You know, we could get Geneviève
together with André.

326
00:21:58,778 --> 00:22:00,837
You idiot!
That would be way too practical.

327
00:22:01,014 --> 00:22:03,482
I'll get dressed.
Staying for breakfast?

328
00:22:03,783 --> 00:22:05,182
Yes, I'm staying.

329
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,378
Your lordship,
about "La Colinière"...

330
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:10,216
See my secretary.

331
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,382
- Is Madame bringing her dogs?
- Ask Madame.

332
00:22:14,394 --> 00:22:15,793
My screw!

333
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:18,092
Move this bench away.

334
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,036
It's the screw for my warbler.
- I understand, sir.

335
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:27,400
My dear, put that on the table.

336
00:22:27,574 --> 00:22:29,474
I have some big news.

337
00:22:29,643 --> 00:22:33,841
"My pilot," as you call him,
will be with me at "La Colinière."

338
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,207
The things you dream up!

339
00:22:37,117 --> 00:22:40,917
The things I dream up?
Dream up!

340
00:22:54,901 --> 00:22:58,667
Excuse me! You know,
you're no fool, you're a poet.

341
00:22:58,872 --> 00:23:00,840
A dangerous poet.

342
00:23:31,104 --> 00:23:32,264
Your lordship.

343
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:41,413
Excuse me for bringing this up
while on duty.

344
00:23:41,748 --> 00:23:44,740
It's about my wife.
- You wrote me, my friend.

345
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:49,355
With my wife in Paris
and me out here, it's hardly a life.

346
00:23:49,656 --> 00:23:52,648
I feel like a widower.
What did his lordship decide?

347
00:23:52,826 --> 00:23:54,589
What's there to decide?

348
00:23:54,761 --> 00:23:58,595
If your wife wants to be with you,
it's her decision.

349
00:23:58,765 --> 00:24:00,232
Very good, your lordship.

350
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,664
- I'm so glad to be here.
- So am I.

351
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:08,265
I lit the stove
and stocked all the fireplaces.

352
00:24:08,441 --> 00:24:09,430
Inform Corneille.

353
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:12,578
- How is Gertrude?
- Just fine, your ladyship.

354
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,906
Was the coal delivered?

355
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:16,275
And the wood brought in?

356
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:17,609
Very good.

357
00:24:18,685 --> 00:24:20,710
- Hello, Lisette.
- Hello, Edouard.

358
00:24:21,655 --> 00:24:23,282
- Everything all right?
- Fine.

359
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,656
- Here you are, at last.
- Yes, here I am.

360
00:24:31,631 --> 00:24:32,996
What's that?

361
00:24:33,466 --> 00:24:36,697
It's Mr. Des Réaux's people.
They're shooting rabbits.

362
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,031
What keeps you from doing the same?

363
00:24:39,372 --> 00:24:42,864
We've already put up fences
at Epinereaux and Tixier.

364
00:24:43,576 --> 00:24:47,307
Along with what the gamekeepers
ferreted, we've killed about 250.

365
00:24:47,647 --> 00:24:48,579
Is that all?

366
00:24:48,748 --> 00:24:51,683
With the full moon,
we kill fewer than usual.

367
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:55,986
We need to put up wire fencing
to protect the plantation.

368
00:24:56,156 --> 00:24:58,420
- I don't want any fencing.
- Yes, your lordship.

369
00:24:58,591 --> 00:25:01,492
Nor do I want any rabbits.
Work it out.

370
00:25:01,661 --> 00:25:05,722
- May I continue my rounds?
- Of course, Schumacher.

371
00:25:09,469 --> 00:25:11,198
We'll head towards Foucherolle.

372
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,305
Musette! Here, girl!

373
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:22,746
What did the boss say?

374
00:25:23,683 --> 00:25:25,742
He doesn't want fencing or rabbits.

375
00:25:26,286 --> 00:25:28,083
How are we supposed
to work it out?

376
00:25:36,362 --> 00:25:38,592
It's that pest of a miller's cat.

377
00:25:38,832 --> 00:25:40,390
He's a real nuisance.

378
00:25:49,275 --> 00:25:50,606
He's no nuisance now.

379
00:25:50,777 --> 00:25:52,608
Marceau deserves the same treatment.

380
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:54,770
Marceau takes us for idiots.

381
00:25:54,948 --> 00:25:56,848
But it won't last much longer.

382
00:26:07,527 --> 00:26:10,189
- What'd you find, girl?
- A rabbit in a snare.

383
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:15,091
Marceau sets snares all over.
Leave them. Don't tip him off.

384
00:26:15,268 --> 00:26:17,065
- He won't be by today.
- At dawn?

385
00:26:17,237 --> 00:26:20,502
If he goes on a binge,
he won't be up early.

386
00:26:20,673 --> 00:26:23,198
That bum's got it too easy.
What do we do?

387
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,041
Watch out for him.

388
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,882
There's one!

389
00:27:19,365 --> 00:27:20,559
Hello, Marceau.

390
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:23,727
Hello, Schumacher. How are you?

391
00:27:25,972 --> 00:27:27,496
Want my rabbit?

392
00:27:35,181 --> 00:27:36,443
Give it here.

393
00:27:37,217 --> 00:27:38,343
Go on, walk.

394
00:27:56,369 --> 00:27:57,961
Get a move on!

395
00:27:58,137 --> 00:28:01,038
- What's going on?
- Marceau, your lordship.

396
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:04,267
- Marceau who?
- Marceau the poacher.

397
00:28:04,444 --> 00:28:05,411
Come here.

398
00:28:06,012 --> 00:28:08,708
- We caught him red-handed.
- Doing what?

399
00:28:09,148 --> 00:28:11,207
Setting snares at woods' edge.

400
00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:14,750
To destroy rabbits?
Why, the man's valuable! Let him go!

401
00:28:14,854 --> 00:28:17,755
- Is his lordship serious?
- He understands me.

402
00:28:17,924 --> 00:28:20,757
He's an intelligent guy,
not like this big bully!

403
00:28:20,927 --> 00:28:22,952
Bully?
I'll teach you manners.

404
00:28:23,129 --> 00:28:25,461
Scum like you should be shot.

405
00:28:25,632 --> 00:28:27,429
Just for a tiny little rabbit!

406
00:28:28,067 --> 00:28:30,126
- So your name is Marceau?
- Yes, your lordship.

407
00:28:30,303 --> 00:28:32,203
- You're a poacher?
- Actually, I mend chairs.

408
00:28:32,372 --> 00:28:36,672
But times are tough even in my line.
His lordship understands me.

409
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,308
So I try to keep busy.
- Call that busy?

410
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:41,879
Back in the war,
I had men shot for less.

411
00:28:42,048 --> 00:28:43,379
That's enough.

412
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:47,041
I like your face.
- His lordship's kind.

413
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,719
He's riffraff!

414
00:28:48,888 --> 00:28:49,946
Enough.

415
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:54,653
Rather than work as an amateur,
would you like to kill rabbits for me?

416
00:28:55,528 --> 00:28:57,496
His lordship wants to hire me?

417
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,061
I won't say no.

418
00:28:59,232 --> 00:29:02,565
If I poach, it's not out of spite.

419
00:29:03,036 --> 00:29:04,901
It's to feed my aging mother.

420
00:29:05,138 --> 00:29:06,400
He has none!

421
00:29:06,606 --> 00:29:10,042
What?
I don't have an aging mother?

422
00:29:10,843 --> 00:29:12,674
Continue your rounds.
Leave me alone.

423
00:29:15,715 --> 00:29:16,841
Say, Marceau.

424
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:23,586
You must have set other snares.
Will you show me one?

425
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:28,349
Being in your lordship's
service now, I can't refuse.

426
00:29:29,696 --> 00:29:30,663
This way.

427
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:39,298
Over here, your lordship.
Here's a snare.

428
00:29:39,706 --> 00:29:41,333
It's set in the wrong place.
- Why?

429
00:29:41,507 --> 00:29:45,068
This trail isn't used anymore.
I should've noticed.

430
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:47,974
- We all make mistakes.
- No, it's annoying.

431
00:29:48,147 --> 00:29:51,378
If Schumacher saw this,
I'd never hear the last of it.

432
00:29:51,551 --> 00:29:55,043
- You can count on my discretion.
- Thanks, your lordship.

433
00:29:56,656 --> 00:29:58,851
So, glad to be working for me?

434
00:29:59,025 --> 00:30:01,823
Sure, but I'd rather work
at the château.

435
00:30:01,995 --> 00:30:04,589
Why? Don't you like the woods,
Mother Nature?

436
00:30:04,797 --> 00:30:09,427
With Schumacher around, not really.
This is more his world than yours.

437
00:30:09,602 --> 00:30:12,264
At the château,
he'd have to leave me alone.

438
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:15,467
I always dreamed
of being a domestic.

439
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:18,542
- That's funny. Why?
- Because of the outfit.

440
00:30:19,078 --> 00:30:21,546
I've always dreamed
of wearing a uniform.

441
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,609
- Has it been raining long?
- A half hour. It was sunny at noon.

442
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:57,512
- Will it last?
- Last time it rained for two weeks.

443
00:30:57,683 --> 00:30:58,980
Charming!

444
00:31:00,219 --> 00:31:01,709
Her luggage.

445
00:31:02,688 --> 00:31:04,781
Every time I come out here it rains.

446
00:31:04,957 --> 00:31:07,187
It clears out the mind.

447
00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:08,317
Hello, La Bruyère.

448
00:31:10,063 --> 00:31:11,587
Will you allow me?

449
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:14,661
You're drenched.

450
00:31:16,436 --> 00:31:17,425
Your scarf.

451
00:31:19,005 --> 00:31:20,302
Where's your wife?

452
00:31:20,473 --> 00:31:22,805
With Christine,
discussing housekeeping.

453
00:31:22,975 --> 00:31:25,307
How interesting.
You came from Tourcoing?

454
00:31:25,478 --> 00:31:27,241
Is it raining there?
- Like everywhere else.

455
00:31:27,413 --> 00:31:31,747
It took eight hours to get here
via Paris. The roads are slippery.

456
00:31:31,918 --> 00:31:34,079
A record.
Hello, Jackie.

457
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,585
How you've grown!
- Think so?

458
00:31:35,755 --> 00:31:40,158
- You're studying Chinese, right?
- No, pre-Colombian art.

459
00:31:40,326 --> 00:31:41,691
Sounds thrilling!

460
00:31:41,861 --> 00:31:44,329
How are you, Charlotte?
- Hello, my dear.

461
00:31:44,664 --> 00:31:45,756
Have you lost weight?

462
00:31:45,932 --> 00:31:48,127
Watch out for yourself.
- I swear.

463
00:31:48,301 --> 00:31:50,394
What about these?
You can't fool me.

464
00:31:50,736 --> 00:31:52,829
- Are you playing?
- I'll be right in.

465
00:31:53,005 --> 00:31:55,269
Will you join us?
- Bridge bores me.

466
00:31:55,441 --> 00:31:57,341
Who mentioned bridge?
It's belote!

467
00:31:58,077 --> 00:32:00,102
Who does your hair, Geneviève?

468
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:11,386
- Did you really invite Jurieu?
- I did. Do you mind?

469
00:32:11,858 --> 00:32:13,018
On the contrary.

470
00:32:16,496 --> 00:32:20,762
- Isn't Jean here?
- He drove to Orleans for the fish.

471
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:24,266
Tell him about
Madame La Bruyère's diet.

472
00:32:24,704 --> 00:32:27,673
She eats everything. But no salt.

473
00:32:28,441 --> 00:32:33,378
On the contrary. But only sea salt.
And only once the food's cooked.

474
00:32:33,546 --> 00:32:36,515
It's simple.
Even a child would understand.

475
00:32:36,816 --> 00:32:40,047
- Do you have sea salt?
- No, but we'll see to it.

476
00:32:40,253 --> 00:32:42,517
Adolphe, for Madame La Plante...

477
00:32:42,688 --> 00:32:45,919
I almost forgot: No tea, just coffee.

478
00:32:46,092 --> 00:32:49,323
And for the general,
a slice of lemon in hot water.

479
00:32:50,396 --> 00:32:52,557
I know: Arthritis.

480
00:32:59,672 --> 00:33:01,469
And for André Jurieu?

481
00:33:12,652 --> 00:33:15,212
What do you think
of the diphtheria vaccine?

482
00:33:15,555 --> 00:33:17,045
I don't know.

483
00:33:17,223 --> 00:33:20,420
At the factory dispensary,
we've had very good results.

484
00:33:20,593 --> 00:33:21,560
Really?

485
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:29,127
Find your suitcase?

486
00:33:29,936 --> 00:33:32,769
My eldest had strep throat
and the youngest, measles.

487
00:33:32,939 --> 00:33:35,032
You can imagine how worried I...

488
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:37,566
Who's that?

489
00:33:38,277 --> 00:33:40,142
- André Jurieu.
- The aviator?

490
00:33:41,147 --> 00:33:42,307
What luck!

491
00:33:43,149 --> 00:33:45,583
I'll ask him for an autograph
for my eldest boy.

492
00:34:02,568 --> 00:34:05,594
- So nice of you to come.
- You're very kind.

493
00:34:05,905 --> 00:34:09,068
My dear André.
This is a pleasure.

494
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:12,543
It's an honor to have you.
You know everyone.

495
00:34:12,745 --> 00:34:15,373
You haven't met my wife.

496
00:34:15,481 --> 00:34:17,574
She'd like an autograph
for our eldest boy.

497
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,741
I hope we'll see you in Tourcoing.

498
00:34:19,986 --> 00:34:22,250
You were magnificent.

499
00:34:22,421 --> 00:34:25,618
My dear Jurieu,
I'm proud to shake your hand.

500
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:28,453
Very proud.
You're a man, a real man.

501
00:34:28,561 --> 00:34:30,222
It's a vanishing breed.

502
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:33,924
You didn't fly in? I must kiss you.
Glad to see you here.

503
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:35,700
May I kiss you, too?

504
00:34:36,602 --> 00:34:37,660
And me?

505
00:34:38,571 --> 00:34:39,435
And me?

506
00:34:40,072 --> 00:34:41,801
I'm entitled to.

507
00:34:52,485 --> 00:34:54,316
It stays in the family.

508
00:34:54,787 --> 00:34:58,484
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Jurieu and Christine.

509
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:00,585
What's it to you?

510
00:35:00,793 --> 00:35:03,990
We're here to hunt,
not to write our memoirs.

511
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,126
So, did they or didn't they?

512
00:35:08,134 --> 00:35:09,101
They did.

513
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:11,502
A pity. He's so elegant.

514
00:35:13,205 --> 00:35:14,297
Dear friends,

515
00:35:15,207 --> 00:35:20,270
I must confess something regarding
my relationship with André Jurieu.

516
00:35:21,514 --> 00:35:24,950
I had a small part to play
in his exploit.

517
00:35:25,351 --> 00:35:26,750
This is how...

518
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,078
While preparing for his flight,
André came to see me often.

519
00:35:32,058 --> 00:35:34,322
We spent long hours together.

520
00:35:35,328 --> 00:35:37,262
Very pleasant hours.

521
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:42,667
Hours marked by the rare sign
of friendship.

522
00:35:43,636 --> 00:35:46,605
He told me about his projects
and I listened.

523
00:35:46,972 --> 00:35:49,202
It's important to listen.

524
00:35:49,642 --> 00:35:52,110
In this case,
it wasn't a waste of time.

525
00:35:52,311 --> 00:35:56,645
I'm very proud,
and I wanted you all to know it.

526
00:35:57,717 --> 00:36:00,185
Aunt, I'm so happy.

527
00:36:00,353 --> 00:36:03,880
- We'll throw a big party for Jurieu.
- Excellent idea.

528
00:36:04,056 --> 00:36:06,581
We'll put on a show.
We'll masquerade!

529
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:08,522
Sure, we'll masquerade!

530
00:36:08,694 --> 00:36:11,094
We'll have as much fun as we can.

531
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,722
When, General?

532
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,194
- A week from now, after the hunt.
- Perfect!

533
00:36:18,104 --> 00:36:20,504
Christine, let's show him his room.

534
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:23,733
These young people are charming.

535
00:36:24,076 --> 00:36:26,670
Saint-Aubin, some billiards.
- Yes, sir.

536
00:36:26,846 --> 00:36:30,145
- Anyone for a game of ping-pong?
- Me.

537
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:31,641
Coming, Geneviève?

538
00:36:32,251 --> 00:36:33,548
A party for what?

539
00:36:34,887 --> 00:36:36,821
To raise funds for the dispensary.

540
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:41,683
- Your coat, madam.
- I'll take it off in my room.

541
00:36:42,228 --> 00:36:43,957
That Mr. Jurieu is charming.

542
00:36:46,232 --> 00:36:48,700
He must have a good position.
- Most likely.

543
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:53,731
- A perfect match for you, Jackie.
- André doesn't notice I exist.

544
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,399
I could arrange a little get-together
at my home in Tourcoing.

545
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:03,345
This Jurieu's handsome.
A pity the lady of the house...

546
00:37:03,516 --> 00:37:05,245
Did you know
she seated him at her right?

547
00:37:05,418 --> 00:37:07,545
- What right?
- At the table.

548
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:11,520
That's bad.
I'm all for doing as I like,

549
00:37:11,724 --> 00:37:13,954
but etiquette is etiquette.

550
00:37:14,193 --> 00:37:16,923
Madame can do without your advice.

551
00:37:17,596 --> 00:37:20,190
Asparagus?
- Never anything canned.

552
00:37:20,366 --> 00:37:22,561
Only fresh foods, for the vitamins.

553
00:37:22,902 --> 00:37:24,870
Pass the mustard?

554
00:37:27,173 --> 00:37:29,698
Did you get sea salt
for La Bruyère?

555
00:37:29,975 --> 00:37:32,739
She can eat like everybody else.

556
00:37:32,978 --> 00:37:36,277
Diets I can accept,
but not obsessions.

557
00:37:36,649 --> 00:37:38,844
Madame's gone too far
over her aviator.

558
00:37:39,018 --> 00:37:41,009
"Constraint spoils pleasure."

559
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:45,454
- And you, Mr. Corneille?
- None of your business.

560
00:37:45,624 --> 00:37:47,057
That's not very nice.

561
00:37:47,259 --> 00:37:48,658
Pass the mustard.

562
00:37:50,629 --> 00:37:53,223
Corneille, you spent 10 years
with Count de Vaudois...

563
00:37:53,399 --> 00:37:56,994
Twelve. I'd still be there
if he hadn't gone bankrupt.

564
00:37:57,336 --> 00:38:00,237
- Fine, but did the countess...
- She had no lovers.

565
00:38:00,473 --> 00:38:01,565
Of course not.

566
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,642
She was 85 years old
and confined to a wheelchair.

567
00:38:05,945 --> 00:38:08,436
You can't compare her to Madame.

568
00:38:08,848 --> 00:38:12,011
- The count wasn't a yid.
- Meaning what?

569
00:38:12,418 --> 00:38:16,787
Only that La Chesnaye's grandfather
was a Rosenthal from Frankfurt.

570
00:38:17,456 --> 00:38:19,583
I'm sure your husband agrees.

571
00:38:22,294 --> 00:38:23,556
Right, Schumacher?

572
00:38:23,896 --> 00:38:26,421
I don't know
what you're talking about.

573
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:31,332
Speaking of Jews, I used to work
for the Baron d'Epinay.

574
00:38:31,537 --> 00:38:33,129
There were no Jews there,

575
00:38:33,606 --> 00:38:36,200
but I can tell you
they ate like pigs.

576
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:38,206
That's why I quit.

577
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:41,971
- Will you be long, Lisette?
- Madame still needs me.

578
00:38:42,214 --> 00:38:44,079
La Chesnaye, yid as he may be,

579
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:47,651
chewed me out recently
over a potato salad.

580
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:51,688
You know - or maybe you don't -
that for it to be any good,

581
00:38:51,857 --> 00:38:53,984
you pour white wine
over the potatoes

582
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:56,719
when they're boiling hot.

583
00:38:56,896 --> 00:38:59,296
But Célestin was afraid
of getting burned.

584
00:39:00,032 --> 00:39:03,365
Well, the boss sensed
right off he hadn't done it.

585
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:07,370
Say what you like, but that's
what I call a real gentleman.

586
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:11,101
So there you are.

587
00:39:12,411 --> 00:39:14,003
Who do we have here?

588
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:17,247
- I'm looking for Mr. Corneille.
- Yes, my friend?

589
00:39:18,384 --> 00:39:22,115
I'm the new domestic.
His lordship must have told you.

590
00:39:22,288 --> 00:39:24,188
What do you do, my good man?

591
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,618
Oh, I dunno...
a bit of everything.

592
00:39:27,793 --> 00:39:30,523
- You shine shoes, my good man?
- Oh, sure.

593
00:39:30,696 --> 00:39:34,928
When it comes to cleaning,
I'm what you call a specialist.

594
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:38,996
Tomorrow morning you'll collect
the boots outside the guest rooms.

595
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:40,433
Will do, Mr. Corneille.

596
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,231
We eat here?
- Yes, my good man.

597
00:39:43,409 --> 00:39:45,070
I'm on duty now.

598
00:39:45,644 --> 00:39:47,202
Sit down here.

599
00:39:48,714 --> 00:39:50,341
Germaine, a plate.

600
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,344
What's your name?

601
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:54,247
Marceau. And you, mademoiselle?

602
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,981
Madame. My name's Lisette.
I'm Madame Schumacher.

603
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:02,352
Don't let that stop you
from sitting down.

604
00:40:04,697 --> 00:40:06,597
The game better be good.

605
00:40:06,765 --> 00:40:09,063
Last year, at the Cahens,

606
00:40:09,234 --> 00:40:12,567
we only bagged
60 pheasant the first day.

607
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:16,064
So long as I don't eat rabbit,
I don't care!

608
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:18,209
Anything but wild rabbit!

609
00:40:18,844 --> 00:40:20,971
Do I serve rabbit other than paté?

610
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,909
I'm not saying you do.

611
00:40:23,115 --> 00:40:25,845
Say, La Chesnaye,
enjoy driving your Delahaye?

612
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:28,616
Last month, Cannes-Paris:
10 hours and 35 minutes.

613
00:40:29,154 --> 00:40:30,314
With a lunch stop.

614
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:34,783
<i>So it's all set.</i>

615
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:36,360
A party after the hunt.

616
00:40:36,495 --> 00:40:38,190
- What party?
- Our party!

617
00:40:38,364 --> 00:40:41,390
- A masquerade?
- Of course. Off to bed now.

618
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:46,929
I'll come check
you have everything you need.

619
00:40:47,106 --> 00:40:50,473
As your guests,
we never lack for anything.

620
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,910
Such hospitality is dying out.

621
00:40:53,278 --> 00:40:55,405
Christine,
you're the perfect hostess.

622
00:40:55,581 --> 00:40:56,878
This way, General.

623
00:41:02,221 --> 00:41:04,655
Before you go,
I was meaning to ask you...

624
00:41:04,857 --> 00:41:07,417
What's this pre-Colombian art?
What are you studying?

625
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:10,357
American civilization
before Columbus's arrival.

626
00:41:10,529 --> 00:41:14,260
- Oh, Negroes!
- There weren't any Negroes yet.

627
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:16,401
- Who was there?
- The Indians.

628
00:41:16,568 --> 00:41:18,798
What a goose I am! Buffalo Bill!

629
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:29,976
- I forget where my room is.
- I'll show you.

630
00:41:30,149 --> 00:41:33,346
We must have a splendid view.
Too bad it's dark.

631
00:41:34,987 --> 00:41:37,455
A hunting horn!
You hunt on horseback?

632
00:41:37,623 --> 00:41:38,954
In my father's day.

633
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:41,183
Is Octave too noisy?
- Not at all.

634
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,818
At the party,
I'll do a fencing demonstration.

635
00:41:44,997 --> 00:41:46,897
I used to do a card trick.

636
00:41:47,066 --> 00:41:49,159
Whatever you do will be fine.

637
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:52,663
- You're a great musician.
- Have fun.

638
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:58,743
William,
I won't be needing you tonight.

639
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:02,078
- Good night.
- Sleep well.

640
00:42:03,515 --> 00:42:04,675
Good night. Sleep well.

641
00:42:05,384 --> 00:42:07,215
You two happy?
- Very.

642
00:42:07,853 --> 00:42:10,185
I adore you, Charlotte!

643
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:15,183
My dear, I'm so grateful to you.

644
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,352
- For what?
- For not making me look foolish.

645
00:42:18,964 --> 00:42:21,364
It was delicate,
in front of everyone.

646
00:42:21,533 --> 00:42:23,398
Jurieu handled it well too.

647
00:42:24,503 --> 00:42:28,633
It was a trying moment, and you were
admirable. My compliments.

648
00:42:39,518 --> 00:42:42,112
You can go now.
I won't be needing you now.

649
00:42:42,287 --> 00:42:44,187
Oh, no?
Good night, Madame.

650
00:42:52,664 --> 00:42:54,529
Don't you want children?

651
00:42:54,767 --> 00:42:56,234
Sure I do, Madame.

652
00:42:56,502 --> 00:42:58,367
But they demand a lot of time.

653
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:01,597
You have to keep after them.
Or else why bother?

654
00:43:02,241 --> 00:43:03,868
That's the beauty of it.

655
00:43:04,576 --> 00:43:06,407
It's your sole preoccupation.

656
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:10,246
Madame's heard about
the new servant? He's very nice.

657
00:43:11,016 --> 00:43:12,210
His name's Marceau.

658
00:43:12,651 --> 00:43:15,176
Watch out for your husband.
His name's Schumacher.

659
00:43:17,156 --> 00:43:20,592
And Mr. Octave's friend's name
is André Jurieu.

660
00:43:33,272 --> 00:43:35,536
So my aviator's not all that bad.

661
00:43:35,841 --> 00:43:38,503
You sure smell nice. Perfume?
- Leave me alone!

662
00:43:39,044 --> 00:43:40,773
Something's cooking!

663
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:46,977
Not in bed yet?

664
00:43:51,523 --> 00:43:52,922
- So that's it.
- That's what?

665
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:54,748
It's working out. Happy?

666
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:57,691
Delighted. Now we can
put our cards on the table.

667
00:43:57,863 --> 00:44:00,229
But you'd better hide your hand.

668
00:44:05,037 --> 00:44:08,438
My good man, I hadn't heard
about that radio business.

669
00:44:08,974 --> 00:44:13,035
It confirms my opinion
that our little Christine has class.

670
00:44:13,512 --> 00:44:16,345
And that's a rare thing nowadays.

671
00:44:16,548 --> 00:44:18,140
Sleep well, General.

672
00:44:22,754 --> 00:44:23,948
What do you say?

673
00:44:24,156 --> 00:44:27,125
- About what?
- Everything. It's going well.

674
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,484
I'm getting the hell out.

675
00:44:29,661 --> 00:44:32,391
Oh, no, not after
all the trouble I went to.

676
00:44:32,564 --> 00:44:34,691
You're here, you stay.

677
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,527
Do you like pillows?
I can't stand 'em.

678
00:44:38,203 --> 00:44:40,103
You finished bouncing around?

679
00:44:46,678 --> 00:44:49,875
Sorry, Saint-Aubin.
I shouldn't have shot that pheasant.

680
00:44:50,048 --> 00:44:52,608
I thought it was in my range,
but it was yours.

681
00:44:52,784 --> 00:44:54,718
No, it was clearly yours.

682
00:44:54,887 --> 00:44:59,017
- No, it was past the pine tree.
- It was yours, my dear fellow.

683
00:44:59,191 --> 00:45:00,158
You're too kind.

684
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:02,520
You'll have the seventh blind.

685
00:45:02,861 --> 00:45:05,887
It's a bit far,
but there are plenty of pheasant.

686
00:45:06,665 --> 00:45:10,260
Saint-Aubin, you're his neighbor.
- The beaters come from where?

687
00:45:10,435 --> 00:45:14,030
- From there.
- Then the game will come this way.

688
00:45:14,206 --> 00:45:16,231
At least we'll be upwind.

689
00:45:16,408 --> 00:45:20,242
Schumacher will show you
to your blinds.

690
00:45:21,813 --> 00:45:23,940
- Madame de Marras?
- I know where.

691
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:27,976
Mr. Jurieu,
you can go up that way.

692
00:45:28,687 --> 00:45:31,656
You have to get some height
ahead of the beaters.

693
00:45:31,823 --> 00:45:33,848
A lot of game
try to escape over the road.

694
00:45:35,894 --> 00:45:37,885
- You coming with me?
- There?

695
00:45:38,063 --> 00:45:41,123
They'll take us for rabbits.
- Don't be silly.

696
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,324
That's right, the last blind.

697
00:45:44,336 --> 00:45:46,065
Happy being out here?

698
00:45:46,238 --> 00:45:49,401
Very happy.
And far from the chatterers.

699
00:45:49,908 --> 00:45:50,875
Say, Octave...

700
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,574
did you see Christine
with La Chesnaye?

701
00:45:53,979 --> 00:45:58,006
- What'd they do now?
- Disgusting! They're overdoing it.

702
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,344
They have every right to.
They're married.

703
00:46:02,421 --> 00:46:03,854
I hate her.

704
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,890
You're going through a rough time,

705
00:46:11,463 --> 00:46:12,896
but you'll get over it.

706
00:46:13,165 --> 00:46:16,532
Trust my experience.
It'll take a while, but you will.

707
00:46:17,336 --> 00:46:18,564
One morning you'll wake up

708
00:46:18,737 --> 00:46:22,696
and you'll notice the concierge's
daughter has gorgeous eyes.

709
00:46:23,408 --> 00:46:24,568
There, you're cured.

710
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:29,570
To wake up I have to fall asleep.
But I can't sleep!

711
00:46:29,781 --> 00:46:33,615
So I've noticed.
You can really be a pain at night.

712
00:46:33,852 --> 00:46:35,114
Ready on the left?

713
00:46:36,355 --> 00:46:37,447
Let's go.

714
00:46:43,128 --> 00:46:45,790
Gentlemen, your positions!

715
00:46:49,568 --> 00:46:50,899
Move it on the left.

716
00:46:53,105 --> 00:46:54,163
Move ahead.

717
00:46:56,008 --> 00:46:57,100
Stay close.

718
00:46:58,043 --> 00:46:59,305
Flush 'em out.

719
00:48:03,475 --> 00:48:07,468
- Jackie, do you enjoy hunting?
- Yes, Aunt. Don't you?

720
00:50:16,715 --> 00:50:19,309
I missed them all.
I'm a poor shot today.

721
00:50:19,485 --> 00:50:23,615
- You two were talking too much.
- Anyway, I'm sick of hunting.

722
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:26,758
Simple enough.
We'll take up winter sports.

723
00:50:26,926 --> 00:50:28,894
Shall we display the kill?

724
00:50:29,061 --> 00:50:31,222
No. Do that at the château.

725
00:50:35,167 --> 00:50:38,102
That pheasant there on the left...

726
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:40,864
Sorry, sir, but this time it's mine.

727
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,531
You can't keep pulling this.

728
00:50:43,709 --> 00:50:45,734
Last time I didn't complain.

729
00:50:46,712 --> 00:50:48,202
Try to understand.

730
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,678
I get a bead on a pheasant,

731
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:53,511
and bang!
He shoots it down in front of me!

732
00:50:53,686 --> 00:50:54,983
That's a bit rich!

733
00:50:55,354 --> 00:50:58,653
They have a fine sport
in Austria: Hunting woodcock.

734
00:50:58,824 --> 00:51:00,223
- At night?
- At dawn.

735
00:51:00,392 --> 00:51:03,293
- I have something to tell you.
- Go ahead.

736
00:51:03,462 --> 00:51:06,056
It's a secret.
May I borrow him, General?

737
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:08,794
- If you give him back.
- Have no fear.

738
00:51:11,904 --> 00:51:13,462
None of that, Saint-Aubin.

739
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,740
Some people are really clumsy
with their guns.

740
00:51:19,678 --> 00:51:23,637
Know what happened to poor George
last year at the Malvoisies?

741
00:51:23,816 --> 00:51:26,842
He took his gun from his loader
in such a way

742
00:51:27,019 --> 00:51:29,852
that he blasted his thigh to pieces.

743
00:51:30,756 --> 00:51:32,417
He was dead in 20 minutes.

744
00:51:33,692 --> 00:51:35,455
Wasn't that a good one, Christine?

745
00:51:35,628 --> 00:51:40,088
Deyeux said, "Your day is done
with game bag full and empty gun."

746
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,594
- Jackie, it's yours!
- Where? I can't see a thing!

747
00:51:43,769 --> 00:51:47,170
But where?
- There! Aim at the rabbit, not me.

748
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:50,008
We lost him.

749
00:51:50,709 --> 00:51:53,644
You're the most
deliciously clumsy of women.

750
00:51:53,812 --> 00:51:54,779
Am I?

751
00:51:55,481 --> 00:51:57,915
- You are.
- I wish I were even clumsier.

752
00:51:58,217 --> 00:52:00,447
- Why?
- So you'd kiss me more often.

753
00:52:01,387 --> 00:52:02,376
Easy enough.

754
00:52:06,091 --> 00:52:07,353
You know, Jackie...

755
00:52:08,827 --> 00:52:10,055
I don't love you.

756
00:52:10,396 --> 00:52:11,658
I know.

757
00:52:11,764 --> 00:52:13,823
But you're wasting
your time with my aunt.

758
00:52:15,434 --> 00:52:16,560
So you know.

759
00:52:16,735 --> 00:52:19,727
It's no joke.
You're in pain and so am I.

760
00:52:22,975 --> 00:52:24,772
The field master was lousy.

761
00:52:24,943 --> 00:52:26,774
Mr. André shot poorly.

762
00:52:26,945 --> 00:52:29,709
His lordship is a better shot.

763
00:52:29,882 --> 00:52:31,281
You finished, kids?

764
00:52:35,888 --> 00:52:39,051
I had no luck despite my position.

765
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:40,620
It can happen.

766
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:43,259
- Are you cold, Madame?
- Not when I walk.

767
00:52:43,429 --> 00:52:46,489
When the sun goes down,
the temperatures plummet.

768
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:48,088
A squirrel!

769
00:52:48,334 --> 00:52:49,858
If I only had my gun...

770
00:52:50,069 --> 00:52:54,165
- Why? I'm fond of squirrels.
- They're charming but destructive.

771
00:52:54,406 --> 00:52:55,395
Take a look.

772
00:52:58,444 --> 00:52:59,911
How marvelous!

773
00:53:01,046 --> 00:53:03,207
It looks so close
I could almost touch it.

774
00:53:03,449 --> 00:53:06,475
Field glasses always come in handy.

775
00:53:06,585 --> 00:53:08,746
This one's small enough to carry.

776
00:53:09,254 --> 00:53:12,519
Their lenses are so fine
and their shape so practical

777
00:53:12,691 --> 00:53:14,955
that at a short distance

778
00:53:15,127 --> 00:53:19,496
you can watch that squirrel up close
without frightening it.

779
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:23,495
Fine. So you'll tell
Christine everything.

780
00:53:23,736 --> 00:53:25,761
To what end?
- To hurt you.

781
00:53:26,105 --> 00:53:27,094
Charming of you!

782
00:53:27,272 --> 00:53:31,003
I hate suffering alone.
Misery loves company.

783
00:53:31,744 --> 00:53:35,009
I want to see your face
when Christine leaves you.

784
00:53:35,814 --> 00:53:37,645
And she will if I tell her.

785
00:53:37,816 --> 00:53:39,716
I don't doubt it.

786
00:53:40,152 --> 00:53:41,710
You really love her.

787
00:53:42,154 --> 00:53:45,749
You've stopped loving me?
- Let's change the subject.

788
00:53:45,924 --> 00:53:50,020
I'm like the shepherd Paris
without the apple. It's grotesque.

789
00:53:50,262 --> 00:53:51,889
Please give me an answer.

790
00:53:52,798 --> 00:53:54,459
No, I don't love you anymore.

791
00:53:54,633 --> 00:53:57,534
I'm very fond of you, but...

792
00:53:57,903 --> 00:53:58,870
But I bore you.

793
00:53:59,037 --> 00:54:01,665
The words you come up with, my dear.

794
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,137
The right ones.

795
00:54:06,311 --> 00:54:10,714
I give up. You can fight hatred,
but not boredom.

796
00:54:15,821 --> 00:54:18,813
Well, the whole thing's
getting to me, too.

797
00:54:19,191 --> 00:54:22,490
Seeing you play shepherd
to your Viennese shepherdess

798
00:54:22,895 --> 00:54:24,487
makes me want to yawn.

799
00:54:26,098 --> 00:54:28,566
I'm leaving.
- That would be best.

800
00:54:29,935 --> 00:54:31,300
Yes, I'm leaving.

801
00:54:32,371 --> 00:54:34,669
But bid me a tender farewell.

802
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,740
Not farewell. Good-bye.

803
00:54:36,909 --> 00:54:38,433
No, farewell.

804
00:54:39,278 --> 00:54:41,143
But a beautiful farewell.

805
00:54:42,281 --> 00:54:45,444
For a moment, I want to go back
three years in time.

806
00:54:46,952 --> 00:54:48,977
When Christine didn't exist.

807
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:53,280
Take me in your arms as you did then.

808
00:54:54,927 --> 00:54:56,326
I'll close my eyes

809
00:54:57,796 --> 00:55:00,526
and believe in everything
I could desire.

810
00:55:00,699 --> 00:55:01,666
Come now, Geneviève.

811
00:55:01,834 --> 00:55:03,529
Don't say a thing.

812
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:07,495
Kiss me.
- My dear...

813
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,307
Extraordinary!

814
00:55:16,748 --> 00:55:19,581
A moorhen!
You could count its feathers.

815
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:22,219
- Still see it?
- No.

816
00:55:22,387 --> 00:55:25,288
Here, Madame.
Two feet away from the tree.

817
00:55:25,624 --> 00:55:27,751
Three if we use your feet.

818
00:55:28,794 --> 00:55:30,284
I want to see it, too.

819
00:55:30,496 --> 00:55:31,554
Isn't it sweet!

820
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:32,990
Let me see.

821
00:55:33,332 --> 00:55:34,594
It's my turn.

822
00:55:44,109 --> 00:55:47,203
Whatever you're looking at
seems damn interesting.

823
00:55:49,448 --> 00:55:50,915
Very interesting.

824
00:55:54,419 --> 00:55:56,114
'Morning, your ladyship.

825
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:14,234
- You're leaving?
- Yes, I am.

826
00:56:15,807 --> 00:56:19,072
- Not staying for our party?
- I'm expected in Paris.

827
00:56:20,345 --> 00:56:23,610
- You can phone.
- No, it's better if I go.

828
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:25,917
Better?

829
00:56:26,618 --> 00:56:27,744
For whom?

830
00:56:28,487 --> 00:56:29,545
For you?

831
00:56:30,956 --> 00:56:32,287
For me, then?

832
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,757
My dear Geneviève,

833
00:56:37,462 --> 00:56:39,987
can we speak frankly?

834
00:56:41,567 --> 00:56:44,593
Am I a troublesome wife?

835
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:47,129
How could you be
troublesome to me?

836
00:56:53,145 --> 00:56:57,844
Have I ever tried to hinder
your relationship with my husband?

837
00:56:59,585 --> 00:57:00,677
You know?

838
00:57:01,053 --> 00:57:02,452
Like everyone else.

839
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:07,515
Good old Robert.
He's so kind, so sensitive.

840
00:57:08,193 --> 00:57:11,993
But he's like a child.
He's incapable of hiding a thing.

841
00:57:12,264 --> 00:57:13,322
How true.

842
00:57:13,498 --> 00:57:16,399
When he tries to lie,
you can tell right away.

843
00:57:16,568 --> 00:57:18,627
He blushes before speaking.

844
00:57:19,071 --> 00:57:20,470
His nose almost starts growing.

845
00:57:20,973 --> 00:57:22,270
He has such tact.

846
00:57:23,942 --> 00:57:28,641
I only have one complaint:
His habit of smoking in bed.

847
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,973
Isn't it awful, though!
And the ashes!

848
00:57:31,149 --> 00:57:32,116
- The sheets!
- All burnt!

849
00:57:32,284 --> 00:57:34,309
- The holes!
- As if beds were for smoking!

850
00:57:34,486 --> 00:57:35,953
I ask you.

851
00:57:38,824 --> 00:57:40,849
So you'll stay?

852
00:57:42,394 --> 00:57:43,793
I don't know anymore.

853
00:57:45,163 --> 00:57:49,065
Women should help each other out
once in a while.

854
00:57:49,835 --> 00:57:52,133
If you stay,
my husband will look after you

855
00:57:53,271 --> 00:57:55,136
and a little less after me,

856
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,604
which would suit me fine
right now.

857
00:57:58,243 --> 00:57:59,005
André Jurieu?

858
00:58:00,646 --> 00:58:03,137
André's very kind and very decent,

859
00:58:04,182 --> 00:58:07,583
but too sincere.
Sincere people are such bores.

860
00:58:07,953 --> 00:58:09,477
It depends what for.

861
00:58:10,188 --> 00:58:12,088
What will you wear tonight?

862
00:58:12,658 --> 00:58:14,819
A Tyrolian outfit. And you?

863
00:58:14,993 --> 00:58:17,086
I didn't prepare anything.

864
00:58:17,362 --> 00:58:21,389
Come with me.
We'll find some fabric.

865
00:58:23,001 --> 00:58:24,901
Do you know any Tyrolian dances?

866
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:27,231
Wait, it must go like this.

867
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:30,933
No, like this.

868
00:58:35,847 --> 00:58:37,974
Unbelievable!
Our shoes have vanished.

869
00:58:42,154 --> 00:58:44,816
- My boots are missing.
- So are mine.

870
00:58:45,424 --> 00:58:47,255
My wife's shoes are gone.

871
00:58:47,426 --> 00:58:50,589
- Corneille will find them.
- I'll see to it.

872
00:58:51,997 --> 00:58:53,726
What will you wear tonight?

873
00:58:53,932 --> 00:58:55,729
I thought it over all night.

874
00:58:56,368 --> 00:58:58,928
I'm going to dress as a bear.

875
00:59:06,344 --> 00:59:08,403
Wait. I left the price tag on.

876
00:59:09,414 --> 00:59:12,440
It's a fine cape.
Warm and waterproof.

877
00:59:13,118 --> 00:59:14,983
But it's not flattering.

878
00:59:22,194 --> 00:59:26,460
"Some men require not
reputation's yoke.

879
00:59:26,631 --> 00:59:30,624
Their first sword's thrust
can be the master stroke.

880
00:59:31,269 --> 00:59:35,899
The eye was in the grave
and was watching Cain."

881
00:59:41,313 --> 00:59:43,338
Getting used to your new job?

882
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:45,914
She loves me.

883
00:59:46,084 --> 00:59:46,914
Loves me not.

884
00:59:47,085 --> 00:59:47,847
Loves me.

885
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:49,043
Loves me not.

886
00:59:49,221 --> 00:59:50,381
Loves me.

887
00:59:51,857 --> 00:59:52,551
Loves me.

888
00:59:52,724 --> 00:59:53,713
Loves me not.

889
00:59:53,892 --> 00:59:54,654
Loves me.

890
00:59:54,826 --> 00:59:55,850
Loves me not.

891
00:59:56,027 --> 00:59:57,255
Loves me.

892
00:59:58,096 --> 00:59:59,461
She loves me.

893
01:00:42,574 --> 01:00:44,041
I hurt you.

894
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:48,040
- On the contrary. I'm glad.
- Why?

895
01:00:48,446 --> 01:00:50,914
- You're close to me.
- Silly.

896
01:00:58,356 --> 01:01:02,122
Leave us alone or I'll tell Madame
and you'll be fired!

897
01:01:02,394 --> 01:01:05,090
- What are you doing here?
- I'm on duty.

898
01:01:05,263 --> 01:01:06,696
We're on duty.

899
01:01:07,866 --> 01:01:10,096
The boots, my good man!

900
01:01:10,268 --> 01:01:13,567
All the men are waiting.
There's a house revolution!

901
01:01:13,905 --> 01:01:16,965
Don't blame me.
Blame this big bully here.

902
01:01:17,676 --> 01:01:20,440
- Why are you here?
- I came to see my wife.

903
01:01:20,612 --> 01:01:25,140
This is hardly the moment.
Their party's tonight. Off you go.

904
01:01:27,786 --> 01:01:30,584
I catch you with her again,
I'll fill you full of lead!

905
01:01:30,922 --> 01:01:35,985
Stop bothering the staff.
We're busy enough as it is.

906
01:01:36,161 --> 01:01:38,391
See? You're bothering the staff.

907
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,997
We're a hit.

908
01:02:23,842 --> 01:02:24,809
Encore.

909
01:02:28,747 --> 01:02:30,612
She's so annoying! Come on...

910
01:02:36,187 --> 01:02:38,519
Author!

911
01:02:52,871 --> 01:02:56,068
<i>Feeling gay
we proudly made our way</i>

912
01:02:56,241 --> 01:02:59,472
<i>Out to the racetrack
our hearts unafraid</i>

913
01:02:59,744 --> 01:03:02,770
<i>Our step was brisk
We couldn't risk</i>

914
01:03:02,948 --> 01:03:06,111
<i>Missing the military parade</i>

915
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:13,457
All together now!

916
01:03:41,987 --> 01:03:42,885
Where'd she go?

917
01:03:43,054 --> 01:03:44,112
We must talk!

918
01:03:44,422 --> 01:03:45,650
- Where is she?
- Who?

919
01:03:45,824 --> 01:03:48,088
- Christine.
- Dunno. Help me out of this.

920
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:52,354
Berthelin.
- Don't bother me now.

921
01:05:18,516 --> 01:05:21,007
I drank too much.
I don't know what I'm doing.

922
01:05:21,186 --> 01:05:22,380
That's good.

923
01:06:01,459 --> 01:06:05,293
- Aren't we playing anymore?
- I've had enough of this show.

924
01:06:06,397 --> 01:06:08,388
Why'd I dress up like this, then?

925
01:06:08,566 --> 01:06:11,660
Help me out of this bearskin.
- We're busy.

926
01:06:11,836 --> 01:06:12,825
Busy!

927
01:06:18,042 --> 01:06:20,374
- Help me out of this.
- I'm busy.

928
01:06:20,912 --> 01:06:22,641
Have you seen my wife?

929
01:06:22,981 --> 01:06:24,073
I'm looking for her.

930
01:06:39,864 --> 01:06:43,129
For Christ's sake,
who'll help me out of this skin?

931
01:06:43,301 --> 01:06:46,270
- I'm dying to play belote.
- A two-hander?

932
01:06:51,843 --> 01:06:53,777
Ask the general.

933
01:06:57,482 --> 01:06:58,642
Have you seen Madame?

934
01:07:03,288 --> 01:07:07,190
I don't mean to be a nuisance,
but I can't manage.

935
01:07:07,425 --> 01:07:09,325
You're a nice fellow, but...

936
01:07:09,494 --> 01:07:13,487
- But I can't take it off by myself!
- Now's not the time.

937
01:07:13,665 --> 01:07:15,963
And Christine?
What've you done with her?

938
01:07:16,301 --> 01:07:18,201
You'll find out soon enough.

939
01:07:20,405 --> 01:07:23,499
Let me just get this off.
Then they'll see!

940
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:31,978
Come here.
I'll take your bearskin off.

941
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:33,344
About time!

942
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:45,726
If she still loved you,
she wouldn't be with Saint-Aubin.

943
01:07:45,897 --> 01:07:48,195
Let's leave together.

944
01:07:48,299 --> 01:07:50,290
I live here.
I can't just walk out.

945
01:07:50,435 --> 01:07:52,869
You and your sense of property!

946
01:07:53,037 --> 01:07:55,301
As if a house were that important!

947
01:07:56,708 --> 01:07:58,232
I must see Christine first.

948
01:07:58,710 --> 01:07:59,677
Pull!

949
01:08:14,259 --> 01:08:15,954
- You haven't seen me.
- Why?

950
01:08:16,127 --> 01:08:18,459
- Schumacher's after me.
- What for?

951
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:20,791
On account of his wife.

952
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:24,726
We were playing around.
He saw us and he's not happy.

953
01:08:25,503 --> 01:08:27,130
Oh, your lordship...

954
01:08:27,605 --> 01:08:30,301
women are charming.
I like them a lot.

955
01:08:30,808 --> 01:08:34,335
Too much, in fact.
But they spell trouble.

956
01:08:34,445 --> 01:08:35,673
You're telling me.

957
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:37,805
- You've got it bad, too?
- Somewhat.

958
01:08:38,483 --> 01:08:40,781
Ever wish you were an Arab?

959
01:08:40,952 --> 01:08:44,183
- No. What for?
- For the harem.

960
01:08:45,556 --> 01:08:48,218
Only Muslims show a little logic

961
01:08:48,459 --> 01:08:50,723
in matters of male-female relations.

962
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:54,260
They're made like us.
- If you say so.

963
01:08:54,432 --> 01:08:55,831
They always have a favorite.

964
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,333
But they don't kick the others out
and hurt their feelings.

965
01:08:59,504 --> 01:09:00,528
If you say so.

966
01:09:00,705 --> 01:09:04,869
I don't want to hurt anyone,
especially not a woman.

967
01:09:06,277 --> 01:09:09,440
It's the story of my life.
- But that takes money.

968
01:09:09,781 --> 01:09:12,341
Even with money,
I still hurt everybody:

969
01:09:12,517 --> 01:09:14,883
My wife, my mistress
and even myself.

970
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:19,916
Whether it's to have a woman,
leave her or hold on to her,

971
01:09:20,091 --> 01:09:21,718
first I make her laugh.

972
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:25,757
That way, her guard's down
and you have your way with her.

973
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:28,797
Why don't you give it a try?

974
01:09:29,133 --> 01:09:31,158
Because it takes talent.

975
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:33,237
Naturally.

976
01:09:33,604 --> 01:09:37,165
Would you mind doing me a favor?
- Gladly. What?

977
01:09:37,342 --> 01:09:39,867
Check if the coast is clear.

978
01:09:40,078 --> 01:09:43,536
If Schumacher's not at this end,
I'll slip out the kitchen.

979
01:09:44,315 --> 01:09:46,545
- Use the terrace.
- Too much light.

980
01:09:46,718 --> 01:09:49,710
- Stay here. I'll take a look.
- Thanks, your lordship.

981
01:10:04,102 --> 01:10:06,229
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.

982
01:10:06,571 --> 01:10:09,540
You're restricted
to the hallways tonight.

983
01:10:09,707 --> 01:10:11,265
Move into my bathroom!

984
01:10:12,143 --> 01:10:13,007
You're needed.

985
01:10:13,177 --> 01:10:14,371
- Is it time?
- Just about.

986
01:10:14,579 --> 01:10:17,070
Where's Mr. Saint-Aubin?

987
01:10:17,248 --> 01:10:19,512
I don't know, honestly.

988
01:10:24,655 --> 01:10:25,713
Excuse me!

989
01:10:30,128 --> 01:10:31,095
Where's André?

990
01:10:32,597 --> 01:10:36,158
You realize I've been looking for you
for the past half hour?

991
01:10:36,334 --> 01:10:38,598
By what right?

992
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:40,431
Yes, by what right?

993
01:10:41,038 --> 01:10:42,938
You're being indiscreet.

994
01:10:43,141 --> 01:10:46,440
Maybe so, but this time
I demand an explanation.

995
01:10:46,644 --> 01:10:48,111
I refuse to give one.

996
01:10:48,312 --> 01:10:52,214
- You can't order Christine around.
- Then you'll give me one.

997
01:10:52,383 --> 01:10:55,181
I'll box your ears, sir.
- Just try, sir.

998
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:56,948
André, please!

999
01:10:57,522 --> 01:10:59,183
My dear Christine, I'm sorry.

1000
01:10:59,357 --> 01:11:01,484
He'll receive my seconds
in the morning.

1001
01:11:01,659 --> 01:11:04,890
Mornings, I sleep.
I may have to throw them out.

1002
01:11:05,062 --> 01:11:07,087
- You won't duel?
- Not with you.

1003
01:11:07,265 --> 01:11:09,392
- You won't live it down.
- That's a laugh.

1004
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:13,594
In my opinion,
you're a most contemptible coward.

1005
01:11:18,176 --> 01:11:21,043
You're putting me
in an inferior position.

1006
01:11:21,245 --> 01:11:22,405
You mustn't fight.

1007
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:25,845
I'm going to break that clown's neck.

1008
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:26,914
Clown?

1009
01:11:29,987 --> 01:11:31,955
Stay out of this.

1010
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:40,827
So I'm a coward?

1011
01:11:59,183 --> 01:12:00,207
See to Saint-Aubin.

1012
01:12:06,891 --> 01:12:08,552
Why weren't you at Le Bourget?

1013
01:12:08,759 --> 01:12:09,691
Because...

1014
01:12:11,028 --> 01:12:12,290
I love you, André.

1015
01:12:13,331 --> 01:12:15,265
I never wanted to admit it.

1016
01:12:16,567 --> 01:12:18,592
But now I have a right to tell you.

1017
01:12:19,804 --> 01:12:20,736
I love you.

1018
01:12:21,973 --> 01:12:23,031
This is wonderful.

1019
01:12:25,977 --> 01:12:27,069
I'd given up hope.

1020
01:12:30,648 --> 01:12:31,945
What are we going to do?

1021
01:12:32,650 --> 01:12:34,447
We'll go away.

1022
01:12:34,619 --> 01:12:36,382
- Where?
- Anywhere.

1023
01:12:36,721 --> 01:12:38,621
- When?
- Right away.

1024
01:12:40,858 --> 01:12:42,257
I love you, Christine.

1025
01:12:43,327 --> 01:12:45,090
I think I can make you happy.

1026
01:12:46,063 --> 01:12:49,191
I've dreamed only
of the joy of being with you.

1027
01:12:51,068 --> 01:12:55,027
So I know...
this joy doesn't come as a surprise.

1028
01:12:56,541 --> 01:12:57,872
Are you afraid?

1029
01:13:01,812 --> 01:13:03,336
I must tell La Chesnaye.

1030
01:13:03,948 --> 01:13:05,210
What for?

1031
01:13:05,583 --> 01:13:07,346
It's only proper that I do.

1032
01:13:14,091 --> 01:13:15,319
Listen to me.

1033
01:13:16,594 --> 01:13:19,427
I can't run off
with the wife of a host

1034
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:22,497
who calls me friend
and shakes my hand

1035
01:13:22,667 --> 01:13:24,567
without an explanation.

1036
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:28,694
But since we're in love,
what difference can it make?

1037
01:13:28,873 --> 01:13:31,307
Even so, Christine,
there are still rules.

1038
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:42,815
<i>We went and kicked up our heels</i>

1039
01:13:42,987 --> 01:13:46,548
<i>Without drum or fife
we looked for thrills in life</i>

1040
01:13:46,724 --> 01:13:50,683
<i>We went and kicked up our heels</i>

1041
01:13:50,861 --> 01:13:54,319
<i>Though we each have a wife
we kicked up our heels</i>

1042
01:14:13,884 --> 01:14:18,480
Dear friends, I have the pleasure
of showing you my latest acquisition.

1043
01:14:18,823 --> 01:14:21,053
It's the high point of my career

1044
01:14:21,225 --> 01:14:24,388
as a collector of musical
and mechanical instruments.

1045
01:14:24,629 --> 01:14:27,996
I think you'll like it.
I'll let you decide.

1046
01:14:28,532 --> 01:14:29,362
One...

1047
01:14:31,936 --> 01:14:32,834
Two...

1048
01:14:33,871 --> 01:14:35,031
Music!

1049
01:15:19,684 --> 01:15:21,515
If he bothers you,
come and get me.

1050
01:15:21,686 --> 01:15:24,814
I'll put him in his place, and fast.

1051
01:15:36,967 --> 01:15:40,198
- What are you doing here?
- I came down for an apple.

1052
01:15:40,571 --> 01:15:44,405
- Where's Marceau?
- Am I his keeper?

1053
01:15:45,776 --> 01:15:48,609
- Where you going?
- Upstairs with the others.

1054
01:15:49,647 --> 01:15:51,080
Get me a drink.

1055
01:16:22,146 --> 01:16:25,240
I'm leaving tomorrow,
and you're coming with me.

1056
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:27,175
Whatever you say, Edouard.

1057
01:16:28,018 --> 01:16:29,349
I'll take you to Alsace.

1058
01:16:30,054 --> 01:16:34,650
Poachers, crooks, the likes of
Marceau we know how to handle.

1059
01:16:35,259 --> 01:16:36,692
A squeeze of the trigger

1060
01:16:36,861 --> 01:16:39,159
one night in the woods,
and that's settled.

1061
01:16:39,330 --> 01:16:40,558
Of course.

1062
01:16:41,398 --> 01:16:43,059
To hell with their money.

1063
01:16:43,667 --> 01:16:47,967
It's stupid to work for others
when you can be your own master.

1064
01:16:48,139 --> 01:16:50,607
And Alsace must be so beautiful,

1065
01:16:50,775 --> 01:16:54,939
with all those tall fir trees,
all that snow, and the storks.

1066
01:17:21,839 --> 01:17:24,364
Stop it! Do you hear me?

1067
01:17:25,342 --> 01:17:26,309
Let go!

1068
01:17:26,477 --> 01:17:27,466
Let go, Lisette!

1069
01:17:29,313 --> 01:17:30,644
For the last time!

1070
01:17:31,916 --> 01:17:35,079
Do you hear me?
I won't say it again!

1071
01:17:35,286 --> 01:17:39,416
No, André, I'll leave with you
right now or never.

1072
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:42,115
We must walk out
with our heads high.

1073
01:17:42,293 --> 01:17:43,817
You'll thank me later.

1074
01:17:44,728 --> 01:17:45,695
Sorry, Madame.

1075
01:17:47,464 --> 01:17:49,022
I'll murder you!

1076
01:17:53,971 --> 01:17:55,029
Well, now...

1077
01:17:55,906 --> 01:17:56,873
Mr. Jurieu.

1078
01:17:57,708 --> 01:17:59,505
You have what you wanted.

1079
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:03,537
You're stealing my wife.
- No, just give me five minutes.

1080
01:18:03,714 --> 01:18:05,443
I'll give you this, bastard!

1081
01:18:08,219 --> 01:18:09,584
Repeat that?

1082
01:18:10,988 --> 01:18:12,114
What's going on?

1083
01:18:13,757 --> 01:18:14,781
Let's get out of here.

1084
01:18:15,259 --> 01:18:16,658
Hold on!

1085
01:18:20,497 --> 01:18:21,486
Thief!

1086
01:18:23,567 --> 01:18:25,262
Are you crazy?

1087
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:28,433
- I've had enough!
- What is it?

1088
01:18:28,606 --> 01:18:31,166
I just told your friend
that I love him.

1089
01:18:31,342 --> 01:18:32,934
Well, it's about time!

1090
01:18:33,244 --> 01:18:34,506
You really love him?

1091
01:18:34,678 --> 01:18:36,009
I don't know anymore.

1092
01:18:36,113 --> 01:18:37,978
Already? What'd he do to you?

1093
01:18:38,082 --> 01:18:40,607
He kept talking... about propriety.

1094
01:18:40,784 --> 01:18:44,345
He suggested that I spend a month
with his mother in the country

1095
01:18:44,521 --> 01:18:46,819
while he settled things
with La Chesnaye.

1096
01:18:46,924 --> 01:18:48,551
What did you expect?

1097
01:18:48,659 --> 01:18:52,857
That he'd take me in his arms,
kiss me and take me away.

1098
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:54,327
Poor little Christine.

1099
01:18:54,665 --> 01:18:58,032
There's one thing you forget:
You see, he's a hero.

1100
01:19:02,606 --> 01:19:05,097
- I'll have his hide!
- You're crazy!

1101
01:19:08,012 --> 01:19:10,537
I've had it!
I'll break your neck!

1102
01:19:13,817 --> 01:19:15,751
- Was that a bullet?
- A bullet.

1103
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,717
- From a gun?
- From a gun.

1104
01:19:17,888 --> 01:19:21,016
A bullet from a gun.
Does that surprise you?

1105
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:25,125
- Christine disappeared.
- Christine disappeared!

1106
01:19:25,362 --> 01:19:27,296
Tonight...
Christine disappeared!

1107
01:19:28,599 --> 01:19:29,930
So it goes!

1108
01:19:30,134 --> 01:19:33,501
You fools! Didn't you see her
leave with Octave?

1109
01:19:34,571 --> 01:19:38,564
I don't blame her.
If you two think you're any fun!

1110
01:19:39,109 --> 01:19:41,600
Don't worry.
You'll find her someday.

1111
01:19:41,779 --> 01:19:42,871
Geneviève, please!

1112
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:50,718
And now, darling,
let's talk about the two of us.

1113
01:19:51,722 --> 01:19:53,189
When are we leaving?

1114
01:19:54,692 --> 01:19:56,125
This isn't the moment!

1115
01:19:56,393 --> 01:19:57,758
I have other worries!

1116
01:19:58,963 --> 01:20:01,955
<i>Your father walked by
without even a look.</i>

1117
01:20:02,933 --> 01:20:06,027
<i>And we hid behind a door.</i>

1118
01:20:07,571 --> 01:20:10,699
The musicians were already
on their feet.

1119
01:20:11,442 --> 01:20:14,570
And out there,
the audience was applauding.

1120
01:20:14,745 --> 01:20:17,339
- The old atmosphere!
- Sure was.

1121
01:20:18,849 --> 01:20:20,407
The setting was strange.

1122
01:20:20,884 --> 01:20:24,650
It was meant to look
like a parlor in green and gold.

1123
01:20:24,822 --> 01:20:29,350
The kind of green
only the English can come up with.

1124
01:20:30,227 --> 01:20:32,718
And your father... what elegance!

1125
01:20:34,898 --> 01:20:37,890
He crossed the stage,
oblivious to everything.

1126
01:20:39,603 --> 01:20:41,298
The house went wild.

1127
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:44,002
The king here...

1128
01:20:45,376 --> 01:20:46,775
As hard as he could.

1129
01:20:49,046 --> 01:20:51,947
He took his baton
from the first violin.

1130
01:20:53,117 --> 01:20:54,084
As usual.

1131
01:20:55,853 --> 01:20:57,684
And just like in a dream...

1132
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:27,108
Leave me alone.

1133
01:22:00,851 --> 01:22:01,840
You dirty louse!

1134
01:22:04,755 --> 01:22:05,619
Let go!

1135
01:22:05,789 --> 01:22:08,781
Not another attraction?
This is too much.

1136
01:22:09,293 --> 01:22:11,523
- Enough is enough.
- I hate gunshots.

1137
01:22:11,728 --> 01:22:13,559
That will do, Schumacher!

1138
01:22:13,730 --> 01:22:15,129
- Get off my back!
- What?

1139
01:22:25,576 --> 01:22:28,272
André, please help me
calm her down.

1140
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:36,048
Corneille, put an end to this farce!

1141
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:39,951
- Which one, your lordship?
- Schumacher and company!

1142
01:22:40,124 --> 01:22:41,091
Right away.

1143
01:23:33,911 --> 01:23:35,503
You were standing here?

1144
01:23:35,846 --> 01:23:38,212
Yes, Madame.
And I have to thank you.

1145
01:23:39,183 --> 01:23:40,844
Thank you.
- Don't mention it!

1146
01:23:43,954 --> 01:23:45,353
- What's the dose?
- Two.

1147
01:23:45,522 --> 01:23:46,511
Give me four.

1148
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:49,586
Sleeping pills?
I hate sleeping pills!

1149
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,785
Be reasonable.

1150
01:23:51,962 --> 01:23:54,726
Where are you going?
- To dance!

1151
01:23:55,933 --> 01:23:59,494
- You can dance in bed.
- Yes, my love. I'm going to bed.

1152
01:23:59,836 --> 01:24:02,327
Yes, darling, I'm going to bed.

1153
01:24:02,839 --> 01:24:05,103
You really need it.

1154
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:08,773
Go back to your room.

1155
01:24:09,379 --> 01:24:11,370
I'm asking you, go back inside.

1156
01:24:11,548 --> 01:24:14,642
Calm down, my dear.
We'll see each other tomorrow.

1157
01:24:15,552 --> 01:24:16,519
Good night.

1158
01:24:17,387 --> 01:24:18,376
The general!

1159
01:24:23,927 --> 01:24:24,985
Cigarette?

1160
01:24:26,296 --> 01:24:27,888
Turning in so soon, General?

1161
01:24:28,098 --> 01:24:30,259
Yes, I'm turning in.

1162
01:24:31,802 --> 01:24:35,067
I wanted to pay my respects
to Christine. Where is she?

1163
01:24:35,239 --> 01:24:36,171
A headache.

1164
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:39,776
- Turning in because of that incident?
- Not at all.

1165
01:24:39,943 --> 01:24:42,207
- A slight dispute.
- Of course. Good night.

1166
01:24:42,946 --> 01:24:45,073
Where's Christine?
Something must be wrong.

1167
01:24:45,716 --> 01:24:47,308
She was tired and turned in.

1168
01:24:47,484 --> 01:24:51,944
- Really? And Geneviève?
- A bit weary, that's all.

1169
01:24:52,122 --> 01:24:53,350
She's so sensitive.

1170
01:24:53,523 --> 01:24:56,492
The staff was a bit excited tonight.

1171
01:24:56,693 --> 01:24:58,684
They're entitled to some fun, too.

1172
01:24:58,862 --> 01:25:00,352
We thought it was an act.

1173
01:25:00,564 --> 01:25:03,499
Had I known,
I would have stopped him.

1174
01:25:03,667 --> 01:25:05,931
It's all right. Sleep well.

1175
01:25:06,103 --> 01:25:07,968
My respects to your wife.

1176
01:25:08,138 --> 01:25:09,730
Kiss her for me.

1177
01:25:09,906 --> 01:25:12,067
Going already?
It's early yet.

1178
01:25:12,276 --> 01:25:16,906
If Christine has the flu,
try a footbath with mustard flour.

1179
01:25:17,481 --> 01:25:19,711
- Can't we see Christine?
- She's resting.

1180
01:25:19,883 --> 01:25:24,377
Great evening! This would have been
impossible in Tourcoing.

1181
01:25:24,588 --> 01:25:28,319
We once danced a farandole.
Charming, but so old-fashioned.

1182
01:25:28,492 --> 01:25:30,050
Of course. Good night.

1183
01:25:32,129 --> 01:25:33,061
Just a minute.

1184
01:25:34,931 --> 01:25:39,061
Was there a lot of damage?
Was anyone injured?

1185
01:25:39,303 --> 01:25:43,034
I just did an inspection.
None of the guests were hurt.

1186
01:25:43,206 --> 01:25:47,006
The stuffed birds suffered a bit,
and I found a bullet in a door.

1187
01:25:47,177 --> 01:25:49,441
Not to mention the glassware.

1188
01:25:49,613 --> 01:25:52,241
I have no choice but to dismiss you.

1189
01:25:52,683 --> 01:25:56,517
It breaks my heart, but I can't
expose my guests to your firearms.

1190
01:25:56,687 --> 01:25:59,713
It may be wrong of them,
but they value their lives.

1191
01:26:00,223 --> 01:26:01,622
When must I leave?

1192
01:26:01,792 --> 01:26:04,022
Straightaway. At once.

1193
01:26:04,227 --> 01:26:05,990
Corneille will pay you
some compensation.

1194
01:26:06,096 --> 01:26:08,087
I never want
to hear your name again.

1195
01:26:09,099 --> 01:26:11,761
- You're coming with me?
- I'm going to Madame.

1196
01:26:11,935 --> 01:26:13,095
To say good-bye to her?

1197
01:26:13,437 --> 01:26:17,430
I told you before! If Madame
still wants me, I'm staying.

1198
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:25,671
- Isn't it excessive?
- Do as I say.

1199
01:26:25,849 --> 01:26:26,543
Very well.

1200
01:26:26,717 --> 01:26:27,684
Come with me.

1201
01:26:35,125 --> 01:26:38,322
My good man,
I have to ask you to leave, too.

1202
01:26:38,495 --> 01:26:42,090
I can't dismiss Schumacher
and leave you here with his wife.

1203
01:26:42,265 --> 01:26:44,199
It'd be immoral, you understand?

1204
01:26:44,401 --> 01:26:46,801
I understand.
No hard feelings.

1205
01:26:48,271 --> 01:26:51,638
Before I go,
I want to tell you how grateful I am.

1206
01:26:52,109 --> 01:26:55,340
You tried to help me up
by making me a domestic.

1207
01:26:56,613 --> 01:26:57,773
I'll never forget that.

1208
01:26:57,948 --> 01:27:02,044
Don't try to soften me up. Just go.
I've enough troubles as it is.

1209
01:27:06,356 --> 01:27:07,584
What a night!

1210
01:27:10,026 --> 01:27:12,961
Where were we?
- I asked you for five minutes.

1211
01:27:13,163 --> 01:27:14,528
Granted.

1212
01:27:14,698 --> 01:27:17,599
How good of you.
But you have quite a right hook.

1213
01:27:17,768 --> 01:27:18,757
You're too kind.

1214
01:27:20,604 --> 01:27:23,698
Where can we talk?
- In the dining room.

1215
01:27:24,374 --> 01:27:25,773
Yes, of course.

1216
01:27:28,345 --> 01:27:31,678
But first, accept my apologies.
- You don't have to...

1217
01:27:31,848 --> 01:27:34,976
You must.
I behaved like a real roughneck.

1218
01:27:35,085 --> 01:27:36,245
I was no better.

1219
01:27:36,353 --> 01:27:40,119
Know what our little athletic
display reminded me of?

1220
01:27:40,557 --> 01:27:43,321
I sometimes read articles
in the papers

1221
01:27:43,493 --> 01:27:48,089
about some Italian roadworker trying
to seduce a Polish laborer's wife.

1222
01:27:48,265 --> 01:27:49,596
It ends in a stabbing.

1223
01:27:49,766 --> 01:27:53,497
I never believed
such things happened. But they do!

1224
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:54,659
I have an excuse.

1225
01:27:55,472 --> 01:27:57,497
I love Christine.
- And I don't?

1226
01:27:58,008 --> 01:28:00,533
I love her so much
I want her to leave with you.

1227
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:02,871
Since her happiness depends on it.

1228
01:28:03,213 --> 01:28:06,649
But I'm glad it's with someone
from our set.

1229
01:28:07,217 --> 01:28:08,514
But still...

1230
01:28:09,219 --> 01:28:11,084
something bothers me.

1231
01:28:11,254 --> 01:28:12,812
- What?
- Your profession.

1232
01:28:13,023 --> 01:28:16,049
- What about it?
- Christine has a certain lifestyle.

1233
01:28:16,226 --> 01:28:19,821
You're young and famous.
You could have an accident.

1234
01:28:19,996 --> 01:28:22,396
- What optimism!
- One has to consider it.

1235
01:28:22,566 --> 01:28:25,160
What would
your financial situation be?

1236
01:28:39,149 --> 01:28:41,709
What peace after all that noise.

1237
01:28:42,252 --> 01:28:44,516
Are they all gone?
- Looks like it.

1238
01:28:45,121 --> 01:28:46,110
Good.

1239
01:28:47,991 --> 01:28:50,016
I must talk to you
about André again.

1240
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:55,088
You have to understand.
It's the plight of all heroes today.

1241
01:28:55,265 --> 01:28:58,063
In the air, they're terrific.

1242
01:28:58,235 --> 01:29:02,171
But when they come back to earth,
they're weak, poor and helpless.

1243
01:29:02,339 --> 01:29:03,897
Clumsy as children.

1244
01:29:04,074 --> 01:29:05,803
They can cross the Atlantic,

1245
01:29:05,976 --> 01:29:10,572
but not the Champs-Elysées
outside the crosswalk.

1246
01:29:10,747 --> 01:29:12,112
That's how they are.

1247
01:29:12,282 --> 01:29:14,409
Look at the moon with its halo.

1248
01:29:15,085 --> 01:29:16,347
It will rain tomorrow.

1249
01:29:19,289 --> 01:29:21,189
I was looking for you.
I was worried.

1250
01:29:21,558 --> 01:29:22,547
Why?

1251
01:29:22,993 --> 01:29:25,461
- You're not mad at me?
- Not at all.

1252
01:29:25,996 --> 01:29:28,658
It's not our fault
if men are all mad.

1253
01:29:29,366 --> 01:29:31,857
- So I can stay?
- Of course.

1254
01:29:32,235 --> 01:29:33,497
I'm so happy!

1255
01:29:33,937 --> 01:29:35,199
Come inside.

1256
01:29:35,372 --> 01:29:38,773
You can't be out like this
on a November night.

1257
01:29:39,543 --> 01:29:41,977
You knew about Mme. De Marras
and my husband?

1258
01:29:43,013 --> 01:29:47,712
But it began before your marriage.
At a summer resort.

1259
01:29:47,918 --> 01:29:52,048
You see? Everybody knew.
And you never said a word.

1260
01:29:52,255 --> 01:29:54,382
- We didn't want to hurt you.
- Obviously.

1261
01:29:54,591 --> 01:29:58,584
For the last three years,
my life's been built on a lie.

1262
01:29:59,563 --> 01:30:03,522
It's been on my mind
since I saw them at the hunt.

1263
01:30:04,467 --> 01:30:06,594
And suddenly I understood.

1264
01:30:07,304 --> 01:30:09,568
That's also part of the times.

1265
01:30:09,739 --> 01:30:11,604
Today everyone lies.

1266
01:30:12,075 --> 01:30:15,010
Pharmaceutical fliers, governments,

1267
01:30:15,178 --> 01:30:17,578
the radio, the movies,
the newspapers.

1268
01:30:17,747 --> 01:30:22,047
So why shouldn't simple people
like us lie as well?

1269
01:30:23,086 --> 01:30:24,644
Let's go for a walk.

1270
01:30:24,988 --> 01:30:26,649
- I'll get your coat.
- I'm too warm.

1271
01:30:26,990 --> 01:30:29,584
That's because you're not well.
Take my cape.

1272
01:30:37,867 --> 01:30:40,631
It's not very fancy,
but you won't catch cold.

1273
01:31:06,896 --> 01:31:07,885
You up the creek?

1274
01:31:10,967 --> 01:31:11,956
So am I.

1275
01:31:13,103 --> 01:31:14,502
Did you see her again?

1276
01:31:15,672 --> 01:31:16,696
Me neither.

1277
01:31:17,507 --> 01:31:19,907
She said she'd stay with Madame.

1278
01:31:20,410 --> 01:31:21,536
With Madame!

1279
01:31:22,078 --> 01:31:24,706
She's not married to you,
but to Madame.

1280
01:31:33,156 --> 01:31:34,316
What'll you do now?

1281
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:41,229
I'll go back to my little cabin
and get back to work.

1282
01:31:41,898 --> 01:31:43,763
Back to your poaching?

1283
01:31:44,968 --> 01:31:49,268
What's it to you,
now that he threw you out?

1284
01:31:50,573 --> 01:31:54,407
You must have poached
a few pheasant yourself.

1285
01:31:56,012 --> 01:31:57,036
A few rabbits.

1286
01:31:58,815 --> 01:32:00,544
I have an idea.

1287
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:03,878
I'm gonna get myself
a license as a game dealer.

1288
01:32:04,054 --> 01:32:06,648
If a cop stops me -
"What've you got there?"

1289
01:32:06,990 --> 01:32:09,686
I say, "In my basket?
Ten wild rabbits,

1290
01:32:09,859 --> 01:32:13,158
which I have a license to sell.

1291
01:32:13,363 --> 01:32:14,853
Good day, Officer."

1292
01:32:15,031 --> 01:32:16,692
Have a cigarette.

1293
01:32:19,569 --> 01:32:20,536
And you?

1294
01:32:22,305 --> 01:32:23,499
What'll you do now?

1295
01:32:24,007 --> 01:32:25,804
I'll stay in the area.

1296
01:32:26,476 --> 01:32:28,068
Because of my wife.

1297
01:32:29,145 --> 01:32:30,578
I want her back.

1298
01:32:39,656 --> 01:32:41,624
- What are you doing?
- Spitting in the water.

1299
01:32:41,725 --> 01:32:43,784
It's all I know how to do in life.

1300
01:32:45,228 --> 01:32:46,422
Come now.

1301
01:32:47,397 --> 01:32:49,160
What's the matter?
- Nothing.

1302
01:32:49,399 --> 01:32:52,698
It's just unpleasant to be reminded

1303
01:32:53,169 --> 01:32:55,034
what a failure I am.

1304
01:32:55,405 --> 01:32:56,337
A leech!

1305
01:32:59,442 --> 01:33:03,845
If I didn't have a few tolerant friends,
I'd starve to death.

1306
01:33:05,181 --> 01:33:07,877
But you know how
when I was young,

1307
01:33:08,418 --> 01:33:11,216
I also thought my day would come.

1308
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:18,390
The contact with an audience,
that's what I wanted to have.

1309
01:33:18,695 --> 01:33:21,061
It must be an overwhelming feeling.

1310
01:33:21,464 --> 01:33:24,558
To think that I missed out on it!

1311
01:33:25,468 --> 01:33:29,768
So I feed myself a lot of nonsense,
imagine that it did happen.

1312
01:33:29,973 --> 01:33:31,634
But it takes a drink.

1313
01:33:32,942 --> 01:33:36,173
Back on the porch,
I almost thought it had happened.

1314
01:33:38,348 --> 01:33:40,816
But after that comes the fall.

1315
01:33:41,217 --> 01:33:44,118
You have a rough time,
but you get used to it.

1316
01:33:47,056 --> 01:33:49,081
Beautiful night.
Look at the moon.

1317
01:33:49,259 --> 01:33:50,248
Aren't you cold?

1318
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,326
No. What about you?

1319
01:33:55,565 --> 01:33:56,532
Put your hood up.

1320
01:34:11,981 --> 01:34:15,508
- It's Lisette.
- With Octave. The skunk!

1321
01:34:16,386 --> 01:34:19,116
You sure it's her?
- She's wearing her cape.

1322
01:34:19,455 --> 01:34:21,047
The one I gave her.

1323
01:34:32,836 --> 01:34:35,270
- I'm cold.
- Let's go back.

1324
01:34:36,039 --> 01:34:37,597
Not to the château.

1325
01:34:38,441 --> 01:34:39,772
Never again.

1326
01:34:39,943 --> 01:34:42,969
In that case,
here in the greenhouse.

1327
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:06,965
- What are they saying?
- I can't hear a thing.

1328
01:35:08,137 --> 01:35:11,106
Got your gun on you?
Let him have it.

1329
01:35:12,909 --> 01:35:15,104
I used up my bullets on you.

1330
01:35:15,478 --> 01:35:16,706
Poor guy.

1331
01:35:16,913 --> 01:35:19,108
But my father wasn't like that.

1332
01:35:19,616 --> 01:35:23,347
He was a hero, too.
A hero in his own way.

1333
01:35:23,853 --> 01:35:27,755
But when you think of your father,
you're unfair to other men.

1334
01:35:28,625 --> 01:35:29,592
Not at all.

1335
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:34,318
You, you're a fine fellow.
- I'm a failure.

1336
01:35:35,465 --> 01:35:37,626
No, you're not.

1337
01:35:38,468 --> 01:35:40,936
But you need someone
to take care of you.

1338
01:35:42,405 --> 01:35:43,702
I'll take care of you.

1339
01:35:44,173 --> 01:35:46,698
It's too late. I'm too old.

1340
01:35:47,443 --> 01:35:48,410
You fool.

1341
01:35:49,846 --> 01:35:51,177
You know...

1342
01:35:53,316 --> 01:35:54,510
it's you I love.

1343
01:35:59,422 --> 01:36:01,856
Do you love me?

1344
01:36:04,661 --> 01:36:05,753
Yes, Christine.

1345
01:36:06,696 --> 01:36:07,788
I love you.

1346
01:36:09,165 --> 01:36:11,258
Then kiss me.

1347
01:36:16,172 --> 01:36:17,901
On the mouth, like a lover.

1348
01:36:29,786 --> 01:36:32,346
- I'll kill them both.
- Not her.

1349
01:36:34,223 --> 01:36:35,190
Both of them.

1350
01:36:41,698 --> 01:36:43,165
I'll get my gun.

1351
01:36:45,201 --> 01:36:46,566
You can't. Not her.

1352
01:36:48,738 --> 01:36:49,705
Come with me.

1353
01:37:05,788 --> 01:37:09,815
Why don't I stay here
just to keep an eye on 'em?

1354
01:37:12,628 --> 01:37:14,095
No, we stick together.

1355
01:37:35,985 --> 01:37:39,887
There's a train at Lamotte-Beuvron
at 3:00 a.m. Let's take it.

1356
01:37:40,056 --> 01:37:41,956
I'll get your coat.

1357
01:37:47,130 --> 01:37:49,291
Where's Christine?
I'm worried.

1358
01:37:49,332 --> 01:37:50,993
Don't worry.
She's with Octave.

1359
01:37:51,334 --> 01:37:55,100
You can trust him.
After all, you met her through him.

1360
01:37:55,838 --> 01:37:57,032
I don't blame him.

1361
01:37:57,306 --> 01:37:59,968
He's a decent fellow. Very decent.

1362
01:38:00,143 --> 01:38:01,110
I know.

1363
01:38:01,778 --> 01:38:06,306
I believe in little, but I may start
believing in friendship.

1364
01:38:08,885 --> 01:38:09,909
But Octave

1365
01:38:10,953 --> 01:38:12,318
is someone special.

1366
01:38:19,295 --> 01:38:21,593
- Where's Madame?
- Get her coat.

1367
01:38:23,499 --> 01:38:24,761
Her coat.

1368
01:38:26,035 --> 01:38:27,059
Very well.

1369
01:38:34,944 --> 01:38:38,380
Somebody pinched my hat.
Just great!

1370
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:46,415
- This is wrong.
- Why wrong?

1371
01:38:46,889 --> 01:38:49,858
When it's just for fun,
it doesn't matter.

1372
01:38:50,693 --> 01:38:52,354
But for living together,

1373
01:38:52,829 --> 01:38:56,162
the young are for the young
and the old for the old.

1374
01:38:56,332 --> 01:38:58,095
Did you find my hat?

1375
01:38:58,267 --> 01:39:02,431
And you don't have any money.
Madame needs lots of things.

1376
01:39:02,705 --> 01:39:04,536
What will you do without money?

1377
01:39:04,707 --> 01:39:07,471
They trampled it.
It's all ruined.

1378
01:39:07,643 --> 01:39:10,510
I speak my mind.
You're making a mistake.

1379
01:39:11,047 --> 01:39:12,947
Madame won't be happy with you.

1380
01:39:18,621 --> 01:39:20,486
Will you take me with you?

1381
01:39:21,858 --> 01:39:24,520
Sure. You'll join us later.

1382
01:39:25,528 --> 01:39:26,825
Where's Christine?

1383
01:39:32,502 --> 01:39:33,764
She's waiting for you.

1384
01:39:34,971 --> 01:39:35,938
Waiting for me?

1385
01:39:38,674 --> 01:39:42,633
In the greenhouse
over the footbridge.

1386
01:39:43,813 --> 01:39:44,837
Bring her this.

1387
01:39:45,781 --> 01:39:47,749
Hurry! In the greenhouse.

1388
01:39:49,986 --> 01:39:52,147
You mustn't catch cold.
- Thanks so much.

1389
01:39:53,890 --> 01:39:55,187
I have to kiss you.

1390
01:40:05,568 --> 01:40:06,830
You love her too.

1391
01:40:13,276 --> 01:40:15,369
Lisette, please. Am I crying?

1392
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:27,314
I'm suffering and I just hate it.

1393
01:40:45,908 --> 01:40:46,875
She's alone.

1394
01:40:49,378 --> 01:40:51,869
- I'll go talk to her.
- Sure, let's go.

1395
01:40:52,048 --> 01:40:52,912
Not you.

1396
01:40:54,050 --> 01:40:55,039
Me.

1397
01:41:00,990 --> 01:41:01,786
Listen!

1398
01:41:08,431 --> 01:41:09,398
It's him.

1399
01:41:18,507 --> 01:41:19,531
Christine!

1400
01:41:40,396 --> 01:41:42,227
Did you hear a shot
in the park?

1401
01:41:42,398 --> 01:41:43,194
In the park?

1402
01:41:45,568 --> 01:41:47,001
I was in my room and...

1403
01:41:56,379 --> 01:41:59,041
- It's André, isn't it?
- Yes, Miss Jackie.

1404
01:41:59,749 --> 01:42:02,912
- And Madame?
- Madame is all right.

1405
01:42:03,085 --> 01:42:04,074
Thank you.

1406
01:42:07,189 --> 01:42:07,951
Is he dead?

1407
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:18,890
He didn't suffer.

1408
01:42:19,468 --> 01:42:22,062
He was hit here.

1409
01:42:23,172 --> 01:42:25,606
He dropped like an animal
in the hunt.

1410
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:35,042
He called out for Madame
and it was over.

1411
01:42:35,217 --> 01:42:36,616
Did you shoot him?

1412
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:40,889
It was Schumacher.
But I was in it with him.

1413
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:42,352
Hurry, Corneille.

1414
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:47,158
Why didn't you let me go?

1415
01:42:47,763 --> 01:42:50,288
What's to become of me now?

1416
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:53,361
Let me go. Madame needs me.

1417
01:42:53,936 --> 01:42:55,028
You're going to

1418
01:42:55,471 --> 01:42:56,904
give her a kiss.

1419
01:42:57,506 --> 01:43:01,340
Give her a kiss
and tell her that I left.

1420
01:43:02,011 --> 01:43:03,035
She'll understand.

1421
01:43:03,713 --> 01:43:06,341
I'll say good-bye now to you, too.

1422
01:43:07,650 --> 01:43:10,016
Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Mr. Octave.

1423
01:43:10,653 --> 01:43:12,211
I was so fond of you.

1424
01:43:18,194 --> 01:43:19,661
I was fond of you, too.

1425
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:25,965
They need us, Corneille.

1426
01:43:26,936 --> 01:43:28,699
By the greenhouse?

1427
01:43:45,121 --> 01:43:46,645
Where are you headed?

1428
01:43:47,289 --> 01:43:48,415
Back to the woods.

1429
01:43:49,358 --> 01:43:53,419
I'll try to pick up
some odd jobs here and there.

1430
01:43:54,830 --> 01:43:55,694
And you?

1431
01:43:56,031 --> 01:43:59,398
I'm going to Paris.
I'll try to manage on my own.

1432
01:43:59,635 --> 01:44:03,571
We may run into each other
again someday.

1433
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:05,807
I doubt it.

1434
01:44:06,642 --> 01:44:09,577
But you never know.
Anything's possible.

1435
01:44:12,281 --> 01:44:13,270
Good luck.

1436
01:44:15,184 --> 01:44:16,173
Good luck.

1437
01:44:28,597 --> 01:44:30,087
Will you excuse me?

1438
01:44:31,434 --> 01:44:34,460
The greenhouse is off-limits.
- Pointard's on guard.

1439
01:44:34,637 --> 01:44:37,470
Work out the formalities
with Corneille.

1440
01:44:39,875 --> 01:44:43,003
- I can't bear it!
- Be strong, Miss Jackie.

1441
01:44:43,212 --> 01:44:47,444
An educated young lady like you
has to put on a brave face.

1442
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:49,777
People are watching.

1443
01:45:05,034 --> 01:45:06,467
I'll take care of her.

1444
01:45:06,635 --> 01:45:09,126
Try to get some sleep.
You must be exhausted.

1445
01:45:09,472 --> 01:45:11,372
We'll be leaving tomorrow.

1446
01:45:23,085 --> 01:45:25,849
It was all a deplorable accident
and nothing more.

1447
01:45:26,021 --> 01:45:29,479
My game warden thought
he saw a poacher and fired.

1448
01:45:30,292 --> 01:45:33,750
As fate would have it,
André Jurieu paid for this error.

1449
01:45:35,197 --> 01:45:39,156
Tomorrow we will leave,
in mourning for this delightful friend,

1450
01:45:39,335 --> 01:45:42,031
this wonderful companion

1451
01:45:42,605 --> 01:45:45,403
who made us forget
that he was famous.

1452
01:45:46,141 --> 01:45:50,271
And now, dear friends, it's chilly.
You're going to catch cold.

1453
01:45:50,446 --> 01:45:52,744
I suggest you come inside.

1454
01:45:56,352 --> 01:45:58,946
Tomorrow we'll do our duty
for Jurieu.

1455
01:46:01,123 --> 01:46:04,251
A new definition
of the word "accident."

1456
01:46:04,393 --> 01:46:07,726
No, this La Chesnaye has class.

1457
01:46:07,897 --> 01:46:11,560
And that's become rare,
my dear Saint-Aubin.

1458
01:46:11,734 --> 01:46:13,031
That's become rare.

1459
01:46:24,413 --> 01:46:27,314
THE END
