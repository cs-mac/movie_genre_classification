00:02:02,243 --> 00:02:05,409
'With World War Two in
Europe drawing to a close,

2
00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:09,238
'the three allied armies,
British, Soviet and American,

3
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,747
'began their move towards Berlin.

4
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:25,213
'Among their ranks were soldiers
newly trained as cameramen.

5

'In April 1945, an advancing
British unit halted

6
00:02:43,534 --> 00:02:46,654
'by the River Aller,
northern Germany.

7
00:02:50,207 --> 00:02:54,999
'As events unfolded, they were
recorded by the army camera crews.'

8
00:03:00,926 --> 00:03:04,129
I think it was about 12th April.

9
00:03:04,263 --> 00:03:07,632
Apparently two German officers
approached our front line

10
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:12,227
with a white flag asking
to speak to our General,

11
00:03:12,354 --> 00:03:16,055
and they were ushered through,
blindfolded actually,

12
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:19,892
and taken to our Corps Headquarters
where I happened to be.

13
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:24,526
And they had a message
from their General.

14
00:03:25,618 --> 00:03:28,737
The message was that
we were approaching

15
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:34,375
or probably going to approach
a large civilian prison camp

16
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:36,993
where typhus had broken out.

17
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:41,756
And their General wanted
to send a message

18
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:45,716
to say that he didn't think it was a good
idea if we fought through that camp

19
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:49,891
because those inmates with
typhus would get loose

20
00:03:50,017 --> 00:03:53,018
and would get amongst
the civilian population

21
00:03:53,145 --> 00:03:55,553
and the German army
and the British army.

22
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:06,696
They pulled us out up a track,

23
00:04:06,825 --> 00:04:11,986
and we had to hoist
a white flag of truce.

24
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:13,949
This is...

25
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,289
Out of nowhere
this has happened.

26
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:36,094
We were sent under the flag of truce
miles behind enemy lines.

27
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,939
The Germans, in fairness to them,
on the roads, they all got off the roads,

28
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:44,982
and they were all armed on the side
of the roads as we were driving through.

29
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:05,965
The more I think about it now,
I'm amazed that none of us opened fire.

30
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:10,845
But in fairness to the Germans,
not one of them fired

31
00:05:10,973 --> 00:05:13,215
and not one of us fired either.

32
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,116
'The British camera crews
continued to film.

33
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:40,535
'Their footage was to become part
of an extraordinary documentary

00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:43,243

00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,674

00:05:55,226 --> 00:05:57,633
'of British documentary cinema.

39

00:06:08,531 --> 00:06:11,734
'In the spring of 1945, the allies,

'At least until he began
to feel a smell. '

46
00:06:41,105 --> 00:06:43,477
Then dawn came up.

47
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:48,898
And then we could see
where the stench was coming from.

48
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:58,571
I think one of the first things we did

49
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:03,249
was to line up
all the SS men and women

50
00:07:03,377 --> 00:07:07,327
and took them,
made them prisoners of war, basically.

51
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:12,043
The SS were still there.

52
00:07:14,138 --> 00:07:19,215
Josef Kramer was still there,
the Camp Commandant.

53
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:25,973
I looked at the tower
and the tower was empty.

54
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:30,272
And there was always
a German there with a shotgun

55
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:32,527
or with whatever he had.

56
00:07:32,656 --> 00:07:37,995
And I started screaming, "The Germans
are gone! I don't see any Germans!"

57
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,367
And some girls ran with me

58
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:45,121
and we made it to the gate.

59
00:07:45,252 --> 00:07:49,202
I was behind a barbed-wire fence

60
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,761
to witness the first British troop
entering the camp.

61
00:08:05,564 --> 00:08:07,723
We had a loudspeaker van
with us.

62
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:10,432
We went into the camp
to see what we could see,

63
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:14,697
and of course what we could see
was a complete utter shock

64
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:18,442
and I'll never forget it.

65
00:08:20,412 --> 00:08:24,362
Through a loudspeaker
in different languages, they said,

66
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,750
"Be calm! Be calm! Be calm!
Stay where you are.

67
00:08:27,878 --> 00:08:30,583
"Be calm. Help is on the way.

68
00:08:30,714 --> 00:08:34,842
"We're the British soldiers.
Help is on the way. "

69
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:37,756
And people went just crazy.

70
00:08:46,355 --> 00:08:49,439
It was an unbelievable moment.

71
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:51,606
Suddenly you hear English spoken,

72
00:08:51,735 --> 00:08:56,611
and we should remain calm,
don't leave the camp, help is on the way.

73
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,235
You know, that sort of thing.

74
00:08:59,493 --> 00:09:01,865
It's very difficult to describe.

75
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:04,154
It was, you know...

76
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,745
You spent years
preparing yourself to die,

77
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:10,209
and suddenly you're still here,
you know.

78
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:14,497
I was 19 when the liberation came,

79
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:17,420
and it was very difficult
to actually take on board.

80
00:09:17,553 --> 00:09:19,213
We thought we were dreaming

81
00:09:19,346 --> 00:09:22,133
and every British soldier
looked like a god to us.

82
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:28,183
Yes, well, it wasn't
what we expected, to still be alive,

83
00:09:28,314 --> 00:09:30,639
but there we were.

84
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:41,532
We didn't know
what we were going to go into.

85
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:50,707
We were sent...

86
00:09:52,922 --> 00:09:54,665
...and then we drove.

87
00:09:54,798 --> 00:09:56,257
Excuse me.

88
00:09:59,303 --> 00:10:01,011
Sorry about this.

89
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:08,016
It's too painful.

90
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:21,157
'Dead prisoners
hurled out and stacked in twisted heaps.

91
00:10:25,412 --> 00:10:28,413
'Dead women
like marble statues in the mire.

92
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:41,759
'This was what these inmates
had to live among and die among.

93
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:06,240
'The dead which lay there
were not numbered in hundreds,

94
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,406
'but in thousands.

95
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,036
'Not one or two thousands,
but 30,000. '

96
00:11:18,132 --> 00:11:22,426
We drove in and saw a sight
that shook us.

97
00:11:22,553 --> 00:11:26,930
There's nothing, even the sights of war
had ever, ever, ever shown us before.

98
00:11:27,057 --> 00:11:31,007
It was pain to look at it.
Pain that this could happen to people.

99
00:11:31,145 --> 00:11:35,392
There were hundreds and hundreds
of dead bodies sort of piled up.

100
00:11:35,524 --> 00:11:40,343
There was a stench of death
everywhere. There was...

101
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:45,754
pits containing bodies of people
as large as lawn tennis courts,

102
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:50,118
containing babies, girls, youths,
men, women, old, young.

103
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:52,039
And how deep, we didn't know.

104
00:12:15,147 --> 00:12:19,394
These half-dead people
walking about,

105
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:22,196
glazed eyes...

106
00:12:24,573 --> 00:12:29,864
...and absolutely... dead.

107
00:12:29,995 --> 00:12:32,665
There was hopelessness,

108
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:37,701
despair, the appalling smell,

109
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:40,956
the whole atmosphere of depression.

110
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:46,167
Like the end had come.

111
00:12:46,303 --> 00:12:50,515
The bodies, you lost contact.
Reality went.

112
00:12:50,641 --> 00:12:53,393
They were dummies,
they were dolls, they were...

113
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:01,150
I don't whether you...

114
00:13:01,277 --> 00:13:04,443
We ourselves withdrew

115
00:13:04,572 --> 00:13:08,700
into another space, time, existence,

116
00:13:08,826 --> 00:13:13,535
but you could never associate
what you were seeing with your own life,

117
00:13:13,664 --> 00:13:15,123
if you know what I mean.

118
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:18,914
This was something completely separate.
It was another world.

119
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:24,465
I don't think if we...

120
00:13:24,592 --> 00:13:28,541
If you had become too involved,
I think you'd probably have gone mad.

121
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:35,602
We were there for about two weeks
filming all these sights,

122
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:39,179
which no film which I have seen since

123
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:42,648
really conveys
the feeling of despair and horror

124
00:13:42,776 --> 00:13:47,273
that can be done to people
who are Europeans of another faith,

125
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:49,897
for no other reason.

126
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:53,901
And I thought as time went by
it might leave me.

127
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:55,662
I wanted to forget.

128
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,374
But it never does leave you.

129
00:14:02,463 --> 00:14:06,081
'I find it hard to describe
the horrible things

and along the rutted tracks.

139
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:49,669
'And they were dying,
every hour and every minute. '

140
00:14:52,096 --> 00:14:58,216
It was so horrific
that the BBC initially waited

141
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:00,843
before they broadcasted it
because they had doubts

142
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,108
whether my father had accurately
described what he'd seen,

143
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:07,689
and they checked and then put it out.

144
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:10,944
It's the moment when he describes

145
00:15:11,073 --> 00:15:14,442
people no longer behave
like human beings,

146
00:15:14,577 --> 00:15:18,788
that you realise what he's saying,
what the implied message of this is.

147
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:23,909
This isn't just Germany.
This isn't just the people in those camps.

148
00:15:24,044 --> 00:15:27,745
This could be any of you anywhere,

149
00:15:27,882 --> 00:15:30,551

00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:51,441
is that in order to reveal that a person
has been murdered or brutalised,

172
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:55,730
what you have to do is you have to reveal
that by getting close to the person

173
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:57,737
because you have to show the wounds,

174
00:17:57,865 --> 00:18:00,819
have to give some indication
of how they've been killed.

175
00:18:00,951 --> 00:18:06,408
Now, that went against the tradition
previously of combat cameramen

176
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,289
where they'd shied away
from representing or recording

177
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:13,455
scenes of people
who'd been killed or brutalised.

178
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:21,376
'For Bernstein, the visit
to Bergen-Belsen was galvanising.

179
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:26,674
'On his return to London, he began
planning a full-length documentary.

180
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:30,808
'Its purpose was clear from guidelines
he issued to the allied cameramen. '

181
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:42,862
My instructions were
to film everything,

182
00:18:42,993 --> 00:18:46,445
which would prove one day
that this had actually happened.

183
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,707
It'd be a lesson to all mankind as well.

184
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:54,915
To the Germans for whom the whole film
we were putting together was designed.

185
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:58,381
To show to the German people.

186
00:18:59,301 --> 00:19:03,797
Because most of them on our way down,
and on the troops' way down,

187
00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:07,264
had denied they knew anything
about the camps.

188
00:19:07,393 --> 00:19:10,559
This would be the evidence,
which we could show them.

189
00:19:22,783 --> 00:19:25,452
First of all,
I wanted them to record

190
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:28,495
that all the local bigwigs and people,

191
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:33,000
the Municipal Burgomaster and the like,

192
00:19:33,127 --> 00:19:36,875
who lived within a reasonable range,

193
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:39,753
saw what was being done

194
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:44,338
in burying these tragic figures.

195
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,601
Some of the Germans
we brought in to be filmed,

196
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:57,898
when the bodies
were being buried in the pit,

197
00:19:58,027 --> 00:20:00,150
just couldn't look any more.

198
00:20:01,238 --> 00:20:06,778
I wanted to prove that they had seen it,
so there was evidence,

199
00:20:06,911 --> 00:20:12,153
because I guess rightly that
most people would deny that it happened.

200
00:20:20,257 --> 00:20:24,125
'Bernstein also used footage
of German SS officers

201
00:20:24,261 --> 00:20:27,346
'helping with the worst
of the tasks in the camp. '

202
00:20:51,497 --> 00:20:53,703
'There was an urgent need

203
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:59,835
'to get rid of as many bodies as quickly
as possible, so the SS were set to work.

204

with the SS were started

00:22:10,993 --> 00:22:14,777
'that Bernstein was able
to access some sound recordings. '

217
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,623
Today is 24th April 1945.

I'm at present in Belsen camp
doing guard duty over the SS men.

220
00:22:26,508 --> 00:22:29,794
The things in this camp
are beyond describing.

221
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:31,802
When you actually see them
for yourselves,

222
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:34,172
you know
what you're fighting for here.

223
00:22:34,308 --> 00:22:37,641
Pictures in the paper
cannot describe it at all.

224
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,976
The things they have committed,

225
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:42,394
nobody would think
they were human at all.

226
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:49,277
We actually know now what
has been going on in these camps.

227
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:52,858
And I know personally
what I am fighting for.

documentary proposal

British and American governments,

'The news from Bergen-Belsen

235
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:59,140
'was not entirely a surprise
to the British government.

'Soviet intelligence had reported
uncovering concentration camps

'in Poland as early as July 1944.

00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:12,937
'But as the Soviets had a record
of falsifying atrocity reports,

239

'the allies ignored the information.

00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:21,660
'Now, in the light of Bergen-Belsen,
the British reconsidered

'and Bernstein broadened
the scope of his film

242
00:24:24,752 --> 00:24:27,373
'to include footage
from the Soviet camps. '

243
00:24:29,965 --> 00:24:32,883
After the end of the war I worked
as a cameraman on the front.

244
00:24:33,135 --> 00:24:38,704
At that time I was a very
young man without experience,

245
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:41,412
without military training.

246
00:24:41,449 --> 00:24:46,126
And suddenly I had the
soldier loops of a captain,

247
00:24:46,467 --> 00:24:49,196
a pistol at my side...

248
00:24:49,232 --> 00:24:54,274
An Imo film camera in my hand
and one goal in my head.

249
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:58,007
To do my best to record

250
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:02,978
the actions of
our Red Army.

251
00:25:05,543 --> 00:25:08,876
We walked, and walked...

252
00:25:09,213 --> 00:25:13,424
We were so tired, we were collapsing.

253
00:25:14,385 --> 00:25:17,718
Then our officers told us:

254
00:25:18,138 --> 00:25:21,342
"There is a camp ahead - Majdanek,
where they burnt people. "

255
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:24,603
We burst into the camp.

256
00:25:27,481 --> 00:25:29,640
And...

257
00:25:31,151 --> 00:25:36,276
...killed the guards.

258
00:25:36,699 --> 00:25:40,032
We shot them on the spot...

259
00:25:41,203 --> 00:25:43,765
We kept on moving

260
00:25:44,033 --> 00:25:47,962
because it was a large camp.

261
00:25:48,252 --> 00:25:53,543
There were green
barracks on one side.

262
00:25:53,716 --> 00:25:56,551
And there were painted warehouses
on the other.

263
00:25:56,802 --> 00:26:00,670
On the right were people.

264
00:26:01,056 --> 00:26:04,971
On the left were warehouses.

265
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:09,222
What was in those warehouses?

266
00:26:09,513 --> 00:26:14,753
We opened one warehouse.
Women's hair.

267
00:26:15,195 --> 00:26:19,193
We opened the second warehouse.
Children's shoes.

268
00:26:20,242 --> 00:26:26,176
The third warehouse,
something else.

269
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:32,540
Zyklon gas in barrels.
And ashes, ashes...

270
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:38,667
They stored people's ashes the way
they stored women's hair.

271
00:26:41,388 --> 00:26:46,024
The crematoriums
were still smoking,

272
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:51,345
people were still burned.
It looked very scary.

273
00:26:53,692 --> 00:26:58,271
God forbid witnessing that.

274
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:03,025
Those...

275
00:27:03,587 --> 00:27:09,410
who survived did not
resemble human beings.

276
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:13,833
Skeletons, scary, exhausted...

277
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:17,082
They knew they would be burned next.

278

It was snowing heavily. I couldn't see.

307
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:44,748
and they were all wrapped
in white camouflage raincoats.

308
00:30:44,882 --> 00:30:47,836
They were smiling from ear to ear.

309
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:50,837
And they didn't look like the Nazis,

310
00:30:50,971 --> 00:30:53,925

We ran up to them.

312

They gave us chocolate,
cookies and hugs.

313
00:31:00,189 --> 00:31:02,810
And this was my first taste of freedom.

314
00:31:04,652 --> 00:31:09,812
They didn't have the strength
even to dance or whatever,

315
00:31:09,949 --> 00:31:11,740
so they just feebly,

316
00:31:11,867 --> 00:31:14,904
very feebly started singing.

317
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:20,282

we were so happy

from the heavens to liberate us.

Thousands of people
poured out from the cattle car.

a Nazi was running,

328
00:32:24,982 --> 00:32:28,481
yelling in German, "Twins! Twins!"

329
00:32:30,237 --> 00:32:34,021
A woman came up and she took
the little suitcase from my mother

330
00:32:34,158 --> 00:32:36,245
and she said,

331
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,682
"Listen, are these two...
are these two twins? "

332
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:42,075
My mother said, "Yes. "

333

So she said,
"Why don't you say they're twins?

334
00:32:45,794 --> 00:32:49,294
"It's a good thing
to have twins here in this place. "

335
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:56,718
The next time the Nazi came,
my mother said, "Here are my twins. "

336
00:32:57,306 --> 00:33:01,802
They took us to Mengele
and Mengele looked at us.

337

The Nazi said,
"Here. I've found twins for you. "

343
00:33:26,543 --> 00:33:29,710
'until a few days after
the first troops. "

344
00:33:36,262 --> 00:33:42,514
We had received orders
to film the liberation of the camp.

345
00:33:43,227 --> 00:33:49,431
But we had no concrete instructions
as to how we should do this,

346
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:54,608
because we had no idea
what we would find there.

347
00:33:55,447 --> 00:34:00,608
I don't think that
even our military commanders

348
00:34:00,744 --> 00:34:04,327
guessed at the scale
of the crime committed

349
00:34:04,456 --> 00:34:07,541
in this the largest
of the concentration camps.

350
00:34:09,545 --> 00:34:13,329
The memory of it
has stayed with me all my life.

351
00:34:13,591 --> 00:34:19,545
It was more shocking and horrible
than anything else I filmed during the war.

352
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:27,435
The Russians decided
to make a film

353
00:34:27,471 --> 00:34:30,623
about the liberation of Auschwitz.

354
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:35,188
They dressed us in
clothes with stripes

355
00:34:35,247 --> 00:34:38,185
over the clothes we had.

356
00:34:38,221 --> 00:34:41,276
And they told us to walk
between the fences.

357
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:44,534
And they filmed us
between the fences.

358
00:34:45,664 --> 00:34:49,958
They tried to show everything
after the event.

359
00:34:50,085 --> 00:34:54,582
There came a...
there came a crew, a film crew...

360
00:34:56,383 --> 00:35:01,211
...to film... to film the... the inmates.

361
00:35:01,347 --> 00:35:02,841
Especially the twins.

362
00:35:05,643 --> 00:35:09,936
A soldier, a Russian soldier,
was beckoning me.

363
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:13,397
He said, "Come, come, come.
Film, film, film. "

364
00:35:15,194 --> 00:35:20,070
So they filmed us marching
between those two rows of barbed wire

365
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:24,279
and because Miriam and I
had the striped prison uniforms,

366
00:35:24,411 --> 00:35:26,534
we ended up at the front.

367
00:35:37,466 --> 00:35:40,087
'These children are twins.

368
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:43,802

were born to non-German parents,

over to an experimental station.

'German doctors injected them
with diseases and attempted cures.

371
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:55,349
'Success in the cure
was not important,

372
00:35:55,484 --> 00:35:58,818
'as these children
were written off, unknown.

373
00:35:58,946 --> 00:36:02,611
'They had no names,
only numbers tattooed on their arms. "

374
00:36:12,126 --> 00:36:15,958
Only now do I understand the importance
of the Russian images.

375
00:36:16,213 --> 00:36:18,787
That's almost the only documentation.

376
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:23,130
The Russians film the camp.
It may have been a month later.

377
00:36:23,554 --> 00:36:29,127
But they managed
to bring the world

378
00:36:29,564 --> 00:36:32,391
everything we experienced.

379
00:36:44,992 --> 00:36:49,820

concentration camps were coming to light.

384
00:37:37,294 --> 00:37:43,379
I found out the Buchenwald camp
was being liberated,

385
00:37:43,509 --> 00:37:46,960
so the captain that I was working with,
we upped and got a jeep

386
00:37:47,096 --> 00:37:52,600
and we drove over to Buchenwald
death camp and I started filming there.

387
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:03,811
It was shocking, yes, it was,

388
00:38:03,946 --> 00:38:07,896
because the bodies
of the prisoners were stacked up.

389
00:38:08,033 --> 00:38:10,359
They were dead
and they were piled up.

390

397
00:39:00,252 --> 00:39:02,922
We received a report

398
00:39:03,047 --> 00:39:08,800
that strange groups of people
had been seen on a road.

399
00:39:08,928 --> 00:39:12,842
They seemed to be wearing
some kind of a pyjama

400
00:39:12,973 --> 00:39:15,096
and they all looked like they were dying.

401
00:39:17,937 --> 00:39:21,471
The ones who were seen on the road
were those who were still alive.

402
00:39:21,607 --> 00:39:25,023
Those who couldn't walk
were lying dead on the ground.

403
00:39:25,611 --> 00:39:29,229
Everybody has seen the barracks.
I don't want to go into the details.

404
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:32,986
It's a little difficult for me to do that.

405
00:39:33,118 --> 00:39:35,823
But you couldn't tell
if they were dead or alive.

406
00:39:35,955 --> 00:39:38,196
You'd step over a body

407
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:41,368
and it would suddenly wave at you
or raise a hand.

408
00:39:42,461 --> 00:39:43,920
Total chaos.

409
00:39:44,046 --> 00:39:47,462
Dysentery, typhoid.

410
00:39:47,591 --> 00:39:50,047
All kinds of diseases in the camp.

411
00:39:53,013 --> 00:39:58,518
Putrid... the smell of the camps.

412
00:39:58,644 --> 00:40:00,387
The crematoria were still going.

413
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:05,859
The dead bodies piled up like cordwood
in front of the crematorium.

414
00:40:06,944 --> 00:40:13,196
It's hard to imagine
for a normal human mind.

415
00:40:14,785 --> 00:40:17,656
I had peered into hell in this.

416
00:40:27,089 --> 00:40:30,375
It's not something you quickly forget...

417
00:40:33,053 --> 00:40:35,342
...and it's a little hard
for me to describe.

418
00:41:08,881 --> 00:41:12,748
'Some of the American crews
were beginning to use colour film.

419

'Although as it was sent
for processing to America,

420
00:41:16,138 --> 00:41:18,807
'it wasn't included in Bernstein's film. "

421
00:41:25,272 --> 00:41:29,400
When colour came out,
it was the start of 1945 in January.

422
00:41:29,526 --> 00:41:32,100
We were the first unit
to start using colour film.

423
00:41:32,238 --> 00:41:36,401
Up to that point it was black and white.
And it was 35mm.

424
00:41:36,533 --> 00:41:40,780
But when colour came out
it was a 16mm movie, see,

425
00:41:40,913 --> 00:41:42,621
that was sent to the processors

426
00:41:42,748 --> 00:41:45,868
and then they would enlarge it
for showing in theatres.

427
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:49,204
Newsreel theatres were showing
this stuff in the States.

428
00:42:17,116 --> 00:42:22,454
We covered the people that
were living in a town called Weimar

429
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,280
and they were paraded through this camp
to show the death scenes

430
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:28,041
and the bodies stacked up

431
00:42:28,168 --> 00:42:33,792
and the ovens
where the prisoners were put in.

432
00:42:33,924 --> 00:42:37,507
So I covered a lot of that
with Captain Carter

433
00:42:37,636 --> 00:42:40,210
and we shot a lot of coverage.

434
00:43:17,343 --> 00:43:20,842
'German citizens
were brought in from Weimar.

435
00:43:20,971 --> 00:43:22,715

were some real horrors.

00:43:53,462 --> 00:43:58,373
'Some of the visitors did not care for the
sight and were assisted by ex-prisoners.

'They had been aware of the camp

00:44:00,261 --> 00:44:03,630
'and had been willing to make use
of the cheap labour it provided.

'The Supreme Commander
in Europe, General Eisenhower,

446

'came to the camps to see for himself,
telling accompanying reporters,

"Now at least he will know
what he is fighting against. "

449
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:34,456
'Eisenhower arranged for journalists,

'senators, congressmen
and a British parliamentary delegation

moving close to the city of Munich,

'The footage was sent to London

'where it was viewed
in a processing laboratory. "

456
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:16,209
One morning,
sitting there waiting for rushes,

457
00:45:16,337 --> 00:45:20,417
we got a dope sheet,
which had the name of the cameramen,

458
00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:22,174
how much film had been shot.

459
00:45:22,301 --> 00:45:26,963
We looked and there was an enormous
amount of film, much more than usual.

460
00:45:27,097 --> 00:45:29,849
And at the top of the dope sheet

461
00:45:29,975 --> 00:45:35,848
was a name which was
totally unfamiliar to all of us.

462
00:45:35,981 --> 00:45:40,026
It was spelt D-A-C-H-A-U.

463
00:45:40,152 --> 00:45:42,275
And we didn't know
what the hell that was.

464
00:45:42,404 --> 00:45:44,563
Whether it was initials or anything.

465
00:45:45,741 --> 00:45:50,617
But we soon found out because once
they started screening this material...

466
00:45:52,373 --> 00:45:55,327
...it was like looking into...

467
00:45:55,797 --> 00:45:59,856
the most appalling hell possible.

468
00:46:00,029 --> 00:46:02,661
And especially in negative...

469
00:46:03,759 --> 00:46:06,795
...where the blacks were white
and the whites were black.

470
00:46:09,974 --> 00:46:13,177
There was a grotesqueness
to it anyway,

471
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:17,390
but to see it in negative was shattering.

472
00:46:18,649 --> 00:46:22,777
And there was four hours
of this without break.

473
00:46:22,903 --> 00:46:24,943
None of us wanted to break.

474
00:46:26,156 --> 00:46:29,775
And to see these piles of bodies,

475
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:33,196
these rooms stacked with bodies...

476
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:37,826
And there was what looked like
a giant barbecue

477
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,332
made out of railway sleepers...

478
00:46:41,547 --> 00:46:44,963
...which an attempt had been made
to burn the bodies,

479
00:46:45,092 --> 00:46:50,169
obviously before the Americans arrived,

480
00:46:50,306 --> 00:46:54,802
to try and lessen the...
lessen the atrocities.

481
00:46:54,935 --> 00:47:00,142
But... none of us,
none of us could talk

482
00:47:00,274 --> 00:47:03,144
and I think each one of us was hoping

483
00:47:03,277 --> 00:47:06,562
that we were not going to be the ones
who were going to cut it.

484
00:47:23,172 --> 00:47:27,466
When it was over, we sat absolutely still

485
00:47:27,593 --> 00:47:31,638
and... nobody smoked,
nobody could talk.

486
00:47:31,764 --> 00:47:35,975
We had no idea what had been
going on in these camps.

17 men were still alive.

506
00:49:24,877 --> 00:49:28,328
'All the rest, about 3,000,
were dead.

'Germans knew about Dachau,
but did not care. "

508
00:49:55,616 --> 00:49:57,692
'By the beginning of May,

509
00:49:57,826 --> 00:50:00,744
'the scope of Bernstein's documentary
had expanded.

510
00:50:00,871 --> 00:50:05,498
'He wanted a director and his thoughts
turned to his friend Alfred Hitchcock,

511
00:50:05,626 --> 00:50:08,627
'already a major Hollywood name. '

512
00:50:17,846 --> 00:50:21,465
Alfred Hitchcock was an eminent director

513
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,598
and I thought he, a brilliant man...

514
00:50:27,564 --> 00:50:32,476
...would have some ideas
of how we could tie it all together.

515
00:50:33,362 --> 00:50:34,773
And he had.

516
00:50:36,031 --> 00:50:40,942
'Hitchcock was fully committed
in America and not immediately available,

517
00:50:41,078 --> 00:50:45,705
'but he agreed to join the film later
as its supervising director.

518
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:49,036
'It was to be
his only known documentary work. '

519
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:58,094
I left America to go to England

520
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,711
to do some war work.

521
00:51:00,848 --> 00:51:04,051
I had felt that I needed

522
00:51:04,184 --> 00:51:08,099
at least to make some contribution.

523
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:11,350
There wasn't any question
of military service.

524
00:51:11,483 --> 00:51:16,062
I was overage
and overweight at that time.

525
00:51:16,196 --> 00:51:18,569
But nevertheless I felt the urge.

526
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:23,667
And my friend Bernstein,

527
00:51:23,953 --> 00:51:27,848
who was the head
of the film section

528
00:51:27,943 --> 00:51:32,239
of the British Ministry
of Information, and a...

529
00:51:32,544 --> 00:51:35,406
he arranged for
me to go over.

530
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,485
'Before Hitchcock could
join the Bernstein team,

531
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:07,704
'the allies declared victory in Europe.

532
00:52:07,831 --> 00:52:09,491
'It was the end of the war,

533
00:52:09,625 --> 00:52:13,457
'but the challenges of dealing
with the peace were just beginning.

534
00:52:15,714 --> 00:52:19,083
'In the concentration camps
a huge relief effort was continuing

535
00:52:19,218 --> 00:52:21,791
'among the many thousands
of stranded inmates.

536
00:52:21,929 --> 00:52:25,796
'In Bergen-Belsen,
army cameramen were still filming

537
00:52:25,933 --> 00:52:28,340
'and sending their material
back to London.

538
00:52:36,944 --> 00:52:40,858
I had a big temperature,
a fever,

539
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:46,529
because I got typhus
and I was thinking, "I'm dying. "

540
00:52:47,913 --> 00:52:49,787
I was thinking, "I've died,"

541
00:52:50,457 --> 00:52:54,954
because there was music coming

542
00:52:55,087 --> 00:52:58,373
and I think it was the Scottish pipes.

543
00:52:58,507 --> 00:53:00,666
I think in front of the Brits

544
00:53:00,801 --> 00:53:05,428
there went a Scottish brigade
with pipes

545
00:53:05,556 --> 00:53:08,473
and there was a music
I'd never heard.

546
00:53:08,601 --> 00:53:14,853
I didn't see them because I couldn't
go up to the window, but I heard them.

547
00:53:14,982 --> 00:53:19,858
And I was thinking about how I'd heard
so many things about angels

548
00:53:19,987 --> 00:53:23,071
and how they sing and make music,

549
00:53:23,198 --> 00:53:26,152
and I was thinking, "I'm in heaven. "

550
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:36,833
It was amazing how quickly
those poor people

551
00:53:36,962 --> 00:53:39,370
who were reduced
to almost animal status,

552
00:53:39,506 --> 00:53:43,006
how they came back
to being human again.

553
00:53:43,135 --> 00:53:48,889
And some of the girls, women,
who really were in a terrible state

554
00:53:49,016 --> 00:53:51,637
quite soon started
to dress themselves up a bit

555
00:53:51,769 --> 00:53:54,604
and clean themselves up a bit,
get their hair done a bit

556
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:57,138
and get back to being
normal humans again.

557
00:53:57,274 --> 00:53:59,148
It happened amazingly quickly.

558
00:53:59,276 --> 00:54:01,648
Within two or three weeks,
I suppose,

559
00:54:01,779 --> 00:54:04,021
these people began
to become human again.

560
00:54:04,156 --> 00:54:07,905
They had been completely dehumanised.
There's no question about that.

561
00:54:09,954 --> 00:54:12,195
'As they logged their shots,

562
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:15,996
'the army cameramen made notes
on what were known as dope sheets.

563
00:54:17,962 --> 00:54:19,919
'One of them commented,

564
00:54:20,047 --> 00:54:23,997
"It is interesting to note that as soon
as the first primitive necessities

565
00:54:24,134 --> 00:54:27,338
"of food and rest and warmth
had been met,

566
00:54:27,471 --> 00:54:33,474
"the patients, particularly the women,
were immediately crying out for clothes.

567
00:54:33,602 --> 00:54:36,272
"Clothes became a medical necessity,

568
00:54:36,397 --> 00:54:41,189
"a powerful tonic against
the dangerous apathy of the very weak. "

569
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:59,002
'Uniquely, Bernstein's film
documented the healing process. '

570
00:55:11,473 --> 00:55:14,391
'Clothes was another urgent problem,

571
00:55:14,518 --> 00:55:16,760
'so an outfitting department was set up

572
00:55:16,895 --> 00:55:20,099
'and clothes gathered from shops
in the surrounding towns

573
00:55:20,232 --> 00:55:25,357
'were soon being tried on and
gossiped over, as women love to do. "

574
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:56,557
'In late-June 1945,
Hitchcock, released from Hollywood,

575
00:55:56,685 --> 00:56:00,635
'at last arrived in London
to start work with Bernstein.

576
00:56:00,773 --> 00:56:03,690
'The Americans had been slow
in sending their footage,

577
00:56:03,817 --> 00:56:07,103
'but despite this
the film was taking shape.

578
00:56:09,281 --> 00:56:12,697
'Hitchcock's visit was short,
but intense.

579
00:56:12,826 --> 00:56:17,369
'After seeing the footage, he returned
to the London hotel Claridge's.

580
00:56:17,498 --> 00:56:21,709
'There, he made a series of proposals
for the completion of the film. '

581
00:56:21,835 --> 00:56:27,292
And I can remember him strolling up
and down in his suite at Claridge's

582
00:56:27,424 --> 00:56:29,915
and saying,
"How can we make that convincing? "

583
00:56:32,054 --> 00:56:37,012
We tried to make shots
as long as possible, used panning shots,

584
00:56:37,142 --> 00:56:40,060
so that there was
no possibility of trickery.

585
00:56:40,187 --> 00:56:46,391
And going from respected dignitaries
or high churchmen

586
00:56:46,527 --> 00:56:49,065
straight to the bodies and corpses,

587
00:56:49,196 --> 00:56:53,988
so that it couldn't be suggested
that we were faking the film.

588
00:56:57,913 --> 00:57:00,583
'Hitchcock was struck by the contrast

589
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:03,827
'between the normal lives
of Germans living near the camps

590
00:57:03,961 --> 00:57:06,119
'and the nightmare within.

591
00:57:06,255 --> 00:57:10,716
'He suggested using maps
to highlight how close they were. "

592
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,678
Alfred Hitchcock,
one of his contributions to the film

593
00:57:14,805 --> 00:57:18,055
is that he had a particular
conceptualisation of those maps.

594
00:57:18,183 --> 00:57:20,342
He also thought
they were very important.

595
00:57:20,477 --> 00:57:22,102
He said not only should they show

596
00:57:22,229 --> 00:57:24,720
the sites of atrocity
or the concentration camps

597
00:57:24,857 --> 00:57:26,648
were close to population centres,

598
00:57:26,775 --> 00:57:29,480
they should do so on a map
that was very simple

599
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,770
and it should be like a school atlas.

600
00:57:41,206 --> 00:57:43,246
We wanted to know
whether the Germans

601
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:47,622
surrounding the concentration camp
knew about it.

602
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:52,997
So Hitch did this drawing, circles,
one mile from the camp,

603
00:57:53,135 --> 00:57:56,753
two miles from the camp, ten miles
from the camp, 20 miles from the camp.

604
00:57:56,889 --> 00:58:03,010
His idea was to show the area
surrounding each camp

605
00:58:03,145 --> 00:58:06,596
and show how people had led
a normal life outside.

606
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:12,150
'Ebensee is
a holiday resort in the mountains.

607
00:58:13,322 --> 00:58:15,480
'The air is clean and pure.

608
00:58:16,408 --> 00:58:18,152
'It cures sickness

609
00:58:18,285 --> 00:58:21,452
'and there is a sweetness
about the place.

610
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,537
'A gentle peace.

611
00:58:37,846 --> 00:58:42,639
'In this place, the Luftwaffe
or SS Panzer officer on leave

612
00:58:42,768 --> 00:58:49,020
'relaxes, eats well,
breathes deeply, finds romance.

613
00:58:50,067 --> 00:58:53,401
'Everything is charming
and picturesque.

614
00:58:57,992 --> 00:59:01,076
'But the concentration camp
had become an integral part

615
00:59:01,203 --> 00:59:03,030
'of the German economic system.

616
00:59:03,163 --> 00:59:04,823
'So it was here too.

617
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:08,701
'Able to see the mountains,

618
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:11,327
'but what use are mountains
without food?'

619
00:59:17,386 --> 00:59:20,221
'Even as Hitchcock
and Bernstein worked,

620
00:59:20,347 --> 00:59:25,056
'events in post-war Europe were
developing in unexpected directions.

621
00:59:28,188 --> 00:59:33,563
'In many of the camps, thousands
of survivors remained, marooned. '

622
00:59:33,694 --> 00:59:37,395
Now we were faced with,
in Belsen anyway,

623
00:59:37,531 --> 00:59:40,366
over 20,000 who refused to go.

624
00:59:40,492 --> 00:59:41,868
And the same situation

625
00:59:41,994 --> 00:59:46,905
occurred in other concentration
camps and slave labour

626
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:49,329
all over the British part
of Germany

627
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,247
and the American part of Germany too.

628
00:59:52,379 --> 00:59:55,546
So all of a sudden we had
another big problem on our hands -

629
00:59:55,674 --> 00:59:59,624
how to handle
this humanitarian disaster situation.

630
01:00:04,558 --> 01:00:09,220
I was born in Bergen-Belsen
in the displaced persons' camp.

631
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:13,898
Both my parents
were liberated at Belsen.

632
01:00:14,026 --> 01:00:15,650
My mother put together a team

633
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:20,274
to work alongside
the British medical personnel

634
01:00:20,407 --> 01:00:22,696
to try and save as many as possible

635
01:00:22,826 --> 01:00:27,619
of the thousands
of critically ill survivors.

636
01:00:27,748 --> 01:00:31,532
At the same time, my father emerged

637
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:37,043
as the leader,
the political leader of the survivors.

638
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:42,261
Most of them did not want
to go back to their country of origin,

639
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:47,346
but wanted to go,
settle in Palestine or elsewhere -

640
01:00:47,476 --> 01:00:49,682
the United States, Canada and the like.

641
01:00:50,562 --> 01:00:55,723
And apparently
the American answer was, "Definitely no.

642
01:00:55,859 --> 01:00:59,904
"We're not taking any ex-prisoners in.
We've got problems of our own. "

643
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:05,447
Britain said, "There's no way we're
going to take hundreds of thousands

644
01:01:05,577 --> 01:01:10,038
"of these homeless,
stateless people in. "

645
01:01:10,165 --> 01:01:13,285
So that was the situation.

646
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:16,538
And so now of course
I am in heaven.

647
01:01:16,672 --> 01:01:18,131
I am free.

648
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:21,092
I am in Germany, but I am free.

649
01:01:21,218 --> 01:01:23,709
I can go anywhere I want to.

650
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:26,301
And I'm thinking to myself,

651
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:28,590
"Do I go back to Poland?"

652
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:33,435
It was so bad in Poland,
so bad for Jews.

653
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:37,478
"Do I want to go back to Poland?
But where do I go?"

654
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:40,527
And I heard about at this time

655
01:01:40,654 --> 01:01:44,901
about Palestine, about Israel,

656
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:47,240
and I said, "Those are my hopes. "

657
01:01:49,663 --> 01:01:52,617
'During May, June and July,

658
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:57,376
'many Jewish survivors, ignoring
the views of the British government,

659
01:01:57,504 --> 01:01:59,164
'went to Palestine,

660
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:04,589
'where they found themselves either
turned back or interned in camps.

661
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,219
'The situation of the survivors
was a complicating element

662
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:12,181
'in a rapidly changing
post-war political climate. '

663
01:02:13,687 --> 01:02:18,349
Look, the so-called Hitchcock film

664
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:21,935
or the Bernstein film,

665
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,562
was made with the best of intentions.

666
01:02:25,991 --> 01:02:31,282
And at a given point
became a political inconvenience.

667
01:02:31,413 --> 01:02:34,865
It would have evoked strong sympathy

668
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,746
on the part of the average person
seeing the film,

669
01:02:40,589 --> 01:02:44,172
of doing something
to help these people

670
01:02:44,301 --> 01:02:49,640
and certainly film that was put together
with the genius of a Hitchcock

671
01:02:49,765 --> 01:02:55,222
would undermine
their own political position.

672
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:59,268
At this time, the Brits had enough
problems with the Jews already.

673

675
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:11,234

"Why did the British not let these people,

more major problems.

and British sectors,

691
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:11,920
had already been so bombarded
with the message of their guilt...

like this any longer at this time.

keen to show a shorter film in Germany

The involvement of the Americans

707
01:05:22,167 --> 01:05:26,913
seems to have come to an end
at the end of June '45

708
01:05:27,047 --> 01:05:33,168
when they'd really become exasperated
that the British were getting nowhere.

709
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:35,426
So they withdrew,

710
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:40,301

making a much shorter film

711

directed by Billy Wilder,

712
01:05:42,062 --> 01:05:45,846

in their own sector.

713
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:48,474
The film was called "Death Mills".

714
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,378
The subject matter was similar,

715
01:06:15,512 --> 01:06:19,296
but the treatment of these two films
was entirely different.

716
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:22,054
The British film, Bernstein's film,

717
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:25,471
was an artistically shaped film

718
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:28,975
with a much profounder message

719
01:06:29,109 --> 01:06:34,151
that humanity must take note
of what had happened.

720
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:39,276
The American film was
a much more hectoring short film,

721
01:06:39,411 --> 01:06:44,536
which simply accused the Germans
of having committed these crimes.

722
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:49,494

Nazis attempted to kill their prisoners,
