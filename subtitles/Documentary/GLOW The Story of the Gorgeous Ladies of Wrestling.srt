Britt? I seem to have broken things.

Hello?

TAMI:
Call me every day, okay?

1396
01:25:38,805 --> 01:25:41,239
I don't know if I can handle senior year
without you.

1397
01:25:41,407 --> 01:25:43,898
Give it a few months,
you'll pick me up in your jet.

1398
01:25:44,076 --> 01:25:45,976
- And we'll go shopping in Paris.

P-R-O-N-T-O, pronto.

1401
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:53,578
Mary, did you hear me?

1402
01:25:53,753 --> 01:25:56,415
Not the OxoCollon, that's for breakfast.

1403
01:25:56,589 --> 01:25:58,989
I need my morphine, it's lunch time.

01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:01,023
Mary. Come on.

1405

Mary. A little help here, please.

1406
01:26:05,565 --> 01:26:08,159
Sorry, Dominique.
I don't work for you anymore.

01:26:08,935 --> 01:26:10,960
- Oh, come on.
- Hey.

Mary, aren't we BFFFFs or...?
Isn't that what the kids say?

01:26:15,508 --> 01:26:17,772
I can't believe all my dreams
are coming true.

I know I can be a witch.

You shouldn't be so sensitive.

1412
01:26:21,647 --> 01:26:23,911
Don't you dare get in that van, Mary.

1413
01:26:24,283 --> 01:26:25,341
Mary?

1414
01:26:25,518 --> 01:26:28,510
Mary, don't leave me with these people.

1415
01:26:28,688 --> 01:26:30,952
Don't be my frienemy!
