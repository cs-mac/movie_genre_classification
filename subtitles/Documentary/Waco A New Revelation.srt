Silent Hill: Revelation

3
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:38,582
You cannot defeat me.

4
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:42,057
Do not go to Silent Hill.

5
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:18,010
Honey, it's okay.

6
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:19,954
I'm here...

7
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,280
Yes?

8
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:29,668
- I was burning...
- Hey come on, kiddo, it was just a dream.

9
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:31,692
Just like this morning...

10
00:03:34,026 --> 00:03:36,767
- This feels different...
- Hey look...

11
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:40,626
Once we've unpacked and give this 
place a lick of paint...

12
00:03:41,168 --> 00:03:43,539
This will be our home.

13
00:03:44,236 --> 00:03:47,574
- The dreams will fade.
- They're calling me.

14
00:03:50,943 --> 00:03:52,864
Do not listen.

15
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,948
Do not listen.
Do you hear?

16
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:58,621
I want you to promise me that whatever happens, 
you'll never go there...

17
00:03:58,656 --> 00:03:59,951
Okay.

18
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:34,506
Rough night?

19
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,036
Yeah.

20
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:40,772
Daddy, I don’t want to do this again.

21
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,029
I know, honey.

22
00:04:44,915 --> 00:04:47,467
Spoons...

23
00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:54,842
"Heather."
Why Heather?

24
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:58,190
It was my grandmother's name.
You can change it if you don’t like it.

25
00:04:58,225 --> 00:05:00,332
No, no.

26
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,222
Heather is fine.

27
00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:07,828
I was Sharon, then Mary, then Cathy.
Now Heather.

28
00:05:07,863 --> 00:05:10,392
And you were Christopher and now you're Harry.

29
00:05:10,427 --> 00:05:12,182
Names don't matter.

30
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,335
I'm still me.

31
00:05:24,222 --> 00:05:26,240
Happy birthday!

32
00:05:28,692 --> 00:05:32,358
Dad, thank you! But you’re, you’re early.

33
00:05:32,393 --> 00:05:34,534
Just a little.

34
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:37,761
Can't believe that today I have 
a soon-to-be 18 year-old daughter.

35
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:49,490
- What’s wrong?
- Nothing.

36
00:05:49,491 --> 00:05:50,497
I love it.

37
00:05:50,532 --> 00:05:52,210
- Really?
- Yes

38
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,093
It is the one I saw you're looking at in the mall.

39
00:05:57,128 --> 00:06:01,063
Yes, yes. Thank you.
I love it.

40
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:03,344
You're welcome, honey.

41
00:06:04,126 --> 00:06:06,878
You're getting all that gray there, dad.

42
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:09,667
Hmmm, your fault.

43
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:16,503
- You know, yours are showing.
- Yeah, I know. I'll fix it.

44
00:06:17,738 --> 00:06:21,593
I think this place will be good for us, you know?
What do you think?

45
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:23,403
Yes

46
00:06:23,438 --> 00:06:28,911
Hey, come on. What's say we unpacked,
give the new place a lick of paint...

47
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:30,852
- I think...
- Don't, Dad.

48
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:34,658
What?

49
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:40,090
It's just what you said 
in my dream. Just, don't.

50
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,945
I got to go.

51
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,627
Do not want to be late on the first day of school.

52
00:06:46,662 --> 00:06:49,500
Hey, remember the rules.

53
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,574
- New town, new school.
- Yes

54
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:54,164
I've done this before.

55
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:56,715
I know you have, I'm just...

56
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,566
- You know I worry.
- Don’t worry.

57
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:04,695
I'm careful.
I'll be fine.

58
00:07:05,863 --> 00:07:07,623
I love you.

59
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:11,532
I love you too, honey.

60
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:03,366
Hey, Rose.
I wish you were still here.

61
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:06,058
It's been so hard since you 
brought Sharon back to me.

62
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:10,068
Christopher, my love,

63
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:13,161
Rose 

64
00:08:15,107 --> 00:08:17,750
I tried to find you 

65
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:19,946
I searched for so long 

66
00:08:19,981 --> 00:08:24,104
My love, I don’t have a lot of time  

67
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:26,950
I'm trapped here. There's nothing you can do for me,

68
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:28,097
protect her. 

69
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:31,569
- She's the one that matters now.
- Why can't you come back?

70
00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:37,360
I found a Seal. Part of it is missing.

71
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:39,935
Only one of us could come through.

72
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,891
I made a choice.

73
00:08:42,926 --> 00:08:46,206
- Where is our daughter?
- They'll come looking for her.

74
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,004
They'll come looking because they need her.

75
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,789
Never let them take her.

76
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:56,429
No matter what happens, no matter 
what you have to do, swear to me.

77
00:08:56,464 --> 00:08:59,220
Swear to me you will never let them take her.

78
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:02,566
- I swear.
- I brought her back to you.

79
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:04,209
She is yours to care for now.

80
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,107
Don't go. 

81
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,835
Goodbye, my love.

82
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:14,070
Rose…

83
00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:19,531
Daddy…

84
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,492
Sharon?

85
00:09:22,873 --> 00:09:24,657
Oh, my God, Sharon!

86
00:09:27,215 --> 00:09:29,372
- You are here.
- Daddy!

87
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:32,778
It's Okay.

88
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:35,908
You are safe now.

89
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:39,087
What happened?
I don't remember anything.

90
00:09:39,122 --> 00:09:41,077
It's Okay…

91
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,480
You. ..

92
00:09:43,515 --> 00:09:45,864
You had an accident.

93
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,004
Where's Mommy?

94
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,328
- Mommy saved you.
- Where's Mommy?

95
00:09:55,235 --> 00:09:57,816
She's gone, honey.

96
00:10:49,265 --> 00:10:52,161
Sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

97
00:10:52,969 --> 00:10:55,400
- Sorry, what?
- Are you okay?

98
00:10:55,565 --> 00:10:59,460
Yes, I'm fine.

99
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:02,150
It's just that you don't wanna 
be messing with the vagrants, miss.

100
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:04,248
I just wanted to see 
if he needed some help.

101
00:11:04,632 --> 00:11:07,508
Some people are beyond our help.

102
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,929
Have we met?

103
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:16,289
- No, no, I don't think so.
- No ?

104
00:11:16,324 --> 00:11:18,698
I'm sure we have.

105
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:21,637
- What is your name?
- I have to catch my bus.

106
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:31,836
Welcome back, everyone. I hope you 
had a good Christmas vacation.

107
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:35,807
I would like to welcome some new 
students who will be joining us this semester.

108
00:11:35,842 --> 00:11:39,396
Heather Mason. 
Could you say hello to the class, Heather?

109
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:42,262
Hi. I'm Heather.

110
00:11:42,297 --> 00:11:46,039
I'm new.
I just moved to town, so...

111
00:11:47,158 --> 00:11:49,525
Come on, Heather, share a 
little bit of yourself.

112
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,486
Everyone has a story.
Tell us yours.

113
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:55,416
What is this, third grade?

114
00:11:57,111 --> 00:11:59,107
What do you wanna know?

115
00:11:59,142 --> 00:12:02,268
Do you get all of your clothes from goodwill?

116
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:08,481
Okay, you know what?

117
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:10,512
Let me make this sincere for you.

118
00:12:10,984 --> 00:12:14,366
This is the fifth school 
I've been to since I was 11.

119
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,281
Me and my dad, we move around.

120
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:19,430
So I do this, a lot.

121
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,954
So don't bother trying to remember my name
because I'm sure as hell not gonna remember yours.

122
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:28,204
Do not talk to me.
We won't be friends.

123
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:33,463
I won't I.M you or, 
Facebook you or Tweet you,

124
00:12:33,498 --> 00:12:35,646
read your blog.

125
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:39,700
And whatever you're thinking of 
saying or doing, don't bother, because

126
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:43,290
I've seen it before, and I'm just guessing here, but...

127
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,764
I don't think there are too 
many original thinkers in this room.

128
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:51,573
And by the time any of you have found 
out anything about me that’s worth knowing...

129
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,261
I have moved on.

130
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:58,619
- How's that?
- Very impressive.

131
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:02,800
Now the next addition to our class,
... Vincent Cooper.

132
00:13:03,427 --> 00:13:05,801
Are you kidding me?
I can't follow that.

133
00:13:26,642 --> 00:13:28,381
Shit!

134
00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:40,740
Burn the witch!

135
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:42,849
- Burn the witch!
- No.

136
00:13:42,884 --> 00:13:44,805
- Burn the witch!
- No.

137
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:48,241
- Please leave me alone.
- Burn the Witch!

138
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:50,096
Please!

139
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:51,224
Leave me alone… 

140
00:14:57,068 --> 00:14:58,559
Are you alright. .?

141
00:14:58,594 --> 00:15:00,832
- What?
- Are you okay?

142
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:09,831
What are you doing out of class?

143
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:13,045
You know what?
I'm lost.

144
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,308
I can't find Math.
Any ideas?

145
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:18,325
No, no.

146
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,376
I - I'm lost too.

147
00:15:24,494 --> 00:15:26,754
Hey look, you wanna get a coffee?

148
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:29,856
- No, we have class.
- I mean, later.

149
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:33,549
- No. 
- Why not?

150
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:36,253
We're both new.
We don't know anyone else.

151
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:40,059
That speech I gave in class, I gave it for a reason.

152
00:15:40,094 --> 00:15:42,310
I really do not want to know anyone here.

153
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,515
Hey, honey.
How was your day?

154
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,304
I think there's someone following me.
What do I do?

155
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,135
Okay. Uhh.. 

156
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,811
Don't come back here. Not yet.
I'll meet you somewhere.

157
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:30,517
Central Square Mall.

158
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:34,188
- You need to make sure.
- Okay, I’ll meet you at Happy Burger place.

159
00:16:37,405 --> 00:16:39,423
I'll be there as soon as I can.

160
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,520
Do you think someone knows?

161
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:43,862
No.

162
00:16:43,897 --> 00:16:46,529
No one knows.
I'll see you soon.

163
00:16:46,564 --> 00:16:49,013
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you too.

164
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,206
Happy birthday, Heather!

165
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,434
Make a wish!

166
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,300
"Happy birthday, HEATHER" 

167
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:47,240
"Happy birthday, HEATHER" 

168
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,700
"Happy birthday, ALESSA"

169
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Sharon.

170
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:20,637
Sharon !

171
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:23,910
Please, sir...

172
00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:27,022
Sharon, wait! 

173
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:55,340
Daddy, Daddy...

174
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,213
Father ..

175
00:18:58,817 --> 00:19:00,728
Sharon, wait. 

176
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,202
Sharon!

177
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:11,217
Keep away from me!

178
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,306
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

179
00:19:15,341 --> 00:19:16,662
Nothing is okay.

180
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,374
Who are you?

181
00:19:19,843 --> 00:19:22,329
My name is Douglas Cartland, I'm a
private investigator.

182
00:19:22,364 --> 00:19:24,139
What do you want from me?

183
00:19:24,174 --> 00:19:27,590
I'm paid to find people.
Someone wanted you found, Sharon.

184
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,285
- That's not my name!
- You're Sharon Da Silva.

185
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,859
Or at least you think you are.
Tracked you down after you left Portland.

186
00:19:33,894 --> 00:19:36,191
You and Harry got away 
from the police, but I found you.

187
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:38,802
What my dad did there...
That was self-defense.

188
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,404
I don't care who Harry killed.

189
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:43,454
- I'm trying to help.
- Get back! Why?

190
00:19:44,377 --> 00:19:47,214
Because I didn't know who I 
was working for then, but I do now.

191
00:19:47,824 --> 00:19:50,284
They call themselves the Order of Valtiel.

192
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:52,155
And they want you.

193
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,625
You're lying.

194
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,618
You do not understand.

195
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:59,126
They know where you are.

196
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:01,846
I told them where you are.

197
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:04,638
They're coming.
You gotta get away.

198
00:20:04,673 --> 00:20:06,406
Don't worry, I will.

199
00:20:06,441 --> 00:20:07,971
Keep away from me!

200
00:20:07,972 --> 00:20:10,082
Everything your dad ever told you was a lie.

201
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:12,398
Fuck you!
He told me the truth.

202
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:13,917
You know why you don't remember 
anything from your childhood?

203
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:17,674
I was in a car crash. My mother died.
I lost my memory.

204
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:20,181
No! There was never any accident.

205
00:20:20,216 --> 00:20:23,175
You were trapped in a place called Silent Hill.

206
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,024
But your mother saved you.
She got you out.

207
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,981
But they want you back.
Ask your dad.

208
00:20:29,016 --> 00:20:30,604
He knows that...

209
00:20:43,946 --> 00:20:46,203
Tell me who I am.

210
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,250
No!

211
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,081
Please tell me.

212
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,337
No!

213
00:21:14,163 --> 00:21:17,153
It's gone. It's gone.

214
00:21:18,781 --> 00:21:21,296
I'll help you, come on.

215
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:05,898
"Garbage"

216
00:22:53,203 --> 00:22:56,059
You two, move back now.

217
00:22:57,856 --> 00:22:59,966
Hey, Miss, you can't be back here.

218
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:02,060
Come on, back behind the tape, please.

219
00:23:03,063 --> 00:23:06,465
Hey come on, folks, I need you back, 
everybody get back. 

220
00:23:08,645 --> 00:23:10,026
Whoa, whoa, one second.

221
00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:12,155
There’s a wallet in his pocket.

222
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:16,854
Sir, please stand back.

223
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,811
Douglas Cartland.

224
00:23:19,073 --> 00:23:21,009
Some P.I. from out of town.

225
00:23:21,044 --> 00:23:24,167
- What do you got there?
- The boys found this jacket down there.

226
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:27,074
- There’s blood on it.
- Go hand it over to forensics,

227
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:28,651
just find out whose blood it is.

228
00:23:28,686 --> 00:23:31,755
Heather Mason, Sharon Da Silva.

229
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,864
- This girl?
- Maybe this is her.

230
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:37,343
Well let’s find her and ask her. 
See what we got on this Cartland,

231
00:23:37,378 --> 00:23:38,498
pull the security tapes,

232
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:39,904
I want to see what happened
here tonight.

233
00:23:39,939 --> 00:23:40,879
Hey.

234
00:23:42,384 --> 00:23:44,546
They found a guy dead in there, 
did you see it?

235
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:47,016
Yeah, uhh…

236
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:52,154
What’s wrong?

237
00:23:52,986 --> 00:23:56,632
- I can’t tell you.
- It's okay. You can tell me.

238
00:23:56,667 --> 00:24:00,406
No, I can’t, because, I have no idea
what’s going on in my head now.

239
00:24:01,886 --> 00:24:04,957
Harry’s voice on phone:
It’s me. Leave a message.

240
00:24:05,503 --> 00:24:08,958
Dad, dad, call me when you get this, please.

241
00:24:11,962 --> 00:24:13,751
Look, you’re cold.

242
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,259
Where's your coat?

243
00:24:15,294 --> 00:24:16,797
Come here.

244
00:24:19,234 --> 00:24:20,789
Thanks.

245
00:24:24,593 --> 00:24:26,088
What's the matter?

246
00:24:28,373 --> 00:24:30,077
Do you see them?

247
00:24:33,308 --> 00:24:35,661
- Yeah, who, the runner?
- No.

248
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:45,455
Never mind. It’s just another thing that 
prove that I’m going crazy.

249
00:24:48,876 --> 00:24:51,352
So, where’s home?

250
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:53,669
A couple of blocks away.

251
00:24:53,814 --> 00:24:56,696
No, I mean before. 
Where did you come from?

252
00:24:56,731 --> 00:25:01,414
Nowhere, really. 
I travel a lot with my dad.

253
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:11,901
Do you think there is a 
difference between dreams and reality?

254
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,990
(Chuckles)
What happened to the small-talk?

255
00:25:15,025 --> 00:25:18,538
No "what’s your favourite band", 
"do you Facebook", nothing like that?...

256
00:25:18,573 --> 00:25:21,370
Fuck Facebook. Do you?

257
00:25:21,405 --> 00:25:23,114
I never think about it.

258
00:25:24,652 --> 00:25:27,742
- Everybody thinks about it.
- Not me.

259
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:30,510
Look, my life is complicated enough.

260
00:25:33,307 --> 00:25:36,240
You should talk to my grandfather.
That's all he ever thinks about.

261
00:25:36,275 --> 00:25:38,169
It drove him crazy.

262
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:42,236
- It's driving me crazy.
- No, no, I mean he’s insane.

263
00:25:42,271 --> 00:25:44,356
Bat-shit nuts.

264
00:25:44,391 --> 00:25:47,825
Back in my sweet, little hometown,

265
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,843
Old man Leonard drools in a padded cell.

266
00:25:50,878 --> 00:25:56,736
He will tell you there are no such things as dreams, 
just endless realities all piled on top of each other.

267
00:25:56,771 --> 00:26:00,956
Some people see monsters,
Other people just see... people.

268
00:26:00,991 --> 00:26:05,187
- And they locked him up for that?
- My mother had him committed.

269
00:26:05,222 --> 00:26:10,462
- Jesus.
- Yeah, she's kind of intimidating, my mother.

270
00:26:10,497 --> 00:26:16,093
No difference between fantasy and reality.

271
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:31,280
- I don't think I like my reality.
- You think anyone does?

272
00:26:32,731 --> 00:26:36,991
At least I'm, who I think I am.
And you…

273
00:26:37,905 --> 00:26:39,960
Yeah, pretty real...

274
00:26:39,995 --> 00:26:42,637
... and just, pretty.

275
00:26:45,254 --> 00:26:48,462
Oh, a lousy pick up line.

276
00:26:48,497 --> 00:26:50,027
Does it often work?

277
00:26:50,062 --> 00:26:51,712
I never tried it before.

278
00:26:51,747 --> 00:26:53,215
How did it go down?

279
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,578
It was a crime against pick-up lines.

280
00:26:57,309 --> 00:26:59,384
You're kind of funny, Heather.

281
00:26:59,419 --> 00:27:02,615
You're pretty fucked up, 
but I don't know, I ...

282
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,827
I think you're goofy fun inside.

283
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:11,746
Goofy fun...
That would be nice for a change.

284
00:27:13,193 --> 00:27:16,057
Anyway, this is my street.

285
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:20,935
- Thanks for walking me back.
- I'd like to do it again sometime.

286
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:23,768
Vincent, you're nice, but...

287
00:27:23,803 --> 00:27:25,890
- I don't think you wanna know me.
- I do.

288
00:27:25,925 --> 00:27:28,047
No, you don't.

289
00:27:32,587 --> 00:27:34,616
I'm gonna call you later.

290
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:36,800
I didn't give you my number.

291
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:38,682
See you around!

292
00:27:43,449 --> 00:27:44,970
Dad?

293
00:27:46,942 --> 00:27:48,298
Dad!

294
00:27:50,981 --> 00:27:54,777
"COME TO SILENT HILL"

295
00:28:01,171 --> 00:28:02,528
Dad!

296
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:05,691
Dad!

297
00:28:12,641 --> 00:28:14,165
Dad… 

298
00:28:17,198 --> 00:28:18,576
Dad!

299
00:28:18,611 --> 00:28:20,223
Dad!

300
00:28:34,898 --> 00:28:38,780
Heather, it's Vincent.
I heard you yell. Is everything alright?

301
00:28:42,218 --> 00:28:44,051
I need your help.

302
00:28:44,086 --> 00:28:45,507
Look,

303
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:55,346
Is that blood?

304
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:58,860
- Did you call the police?
- I can’t.

305
00:28:58,895 --> 00:29:00,507
- Why not? They can help.
- I just can't!

306
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,438
- Okay?
- Okay.

307
00:29:06,016 --> 00:29:08,570
Well, do you know where this Silent Hill is?

308
00:29:08,605 --> 00:29:10,628
No, it's ..

309
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:15,603
It's something that I dreamt about. My dad, he...
He warned me never to go there.

310
00:29:15,638 --> 00:29:19,025
But I know that symbol.

311
00:29:20,346 --> 00:29:21,762
This is it. 

312
00:29:23,197 --> 00:29:25,265
He kept it all in here.

313
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,045
"SHARON"

314
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,823
- Is this your mom?
- My adoptive mom, Rose.

315
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,224
You were adopted?

316
00:29:37,225 --> 00:29:39,500
Yeah, I never knew my real parents.

317
00:29:47,491 --> 00:29:51,522
- Did you write all of these?
- Yeah…

318
00:29:56,752 --> 00:29:59,174
- Do you know what that is?
- No.

319
00:30:00,504 --> 00:30:04,388
Looks like there's another 
side that fits in here.

320
00:30:10,191 --> 00:30:12,803
A gun?
Why do you need a gun?

321
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:17,432
- Miss Mason, it's the police.
- I thought you said you didn't call.

322
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:19,236
- I didn't.
- Then why are they here?

323
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:22,503
- What is going on, Heather?
- I have to go.

324
00:30:22,538 --> 00:30:24,321
If they catch me,
I'll never find my dad.

325
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,848
Catch you?
Why would they catch you?

326
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:29,174
- What have you done?
- Nothing! I haven’t done anything, I swear.

327
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:32,496
- Help me.
- What do you want me to do?

328
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:34,453
- Can you drive?
- What?

329
00:30:34,488 --> 00:30:36,232
I can’t drive. Can you?

330
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:44,205
Santini, come here.

331
00:30:47,547 --> 00:30:49,808
You want a probable cause?

332
00:30:49,843 --> 00:30:51,483
This is it.

333
00:30:54,014 --> 00:30:55,980
What the hell happened here?

334
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,248
That look like a gang tag to you?

335
00:31:02,283 --> 00:31:05,575
I don’t think so.
But I've never seen anything like it.

336
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,971
Call Crime Scene, get them down here.

337
00:31:08,006 --> 00:31:11,566
- What about the girl?
- She’s a murder suspect.

338
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,689
"My dearest Sharon, 

339
00:31:38,724 --> 00:31:41,323
If you are reading this then 
something has happened to me.

340
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,439
You're on your own now.

341
00:31:44,474 --> 00:31:46,160
Don’t try to find me.

342
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,955
And whatever you do, 
don't go to Silent Hill.

343
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:53,148
I promised your mother I'd 
keep you safe, but I failed.

344
00:31:53,183 --> 00:31:55,528
I know you think we're 
running from the police,

345
00:31:55,529 --> 00:31:58,170
because of the man I killed 
in Portland two years ago.

346
00:32:00,742 --> 00:32:02,923
(You can't protect her forever!)

347
00:32:03,945 --> 00:32:05,270
Dad!

348
00:32:05,305 --> 00:32:08,171
But the truth is...
He wasn't just a random thief.

349
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:09,972
(Get your things, we're leaving.)

350
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:12,168
He was sent to take you back to Silent Hill.

351
00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:15,684
He was a member of the Order.
These people want you, they need you.

352
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:19,700
I don't know why, but they will do everything 
in their power just to draw you back.

353
00:32:19,735 --> 00:32:21,477
You must resist it.

354
00:32:21,512 --> 00:32:23,461
I tried to keep you safe.

355
00:32:23,462 --> 00:32:25,779
And I never meant to lie to you,
but I had to.

356
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:30,372
You'll find the truth in my notebooks. 
As much as I could find out.

357
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:36,105
I hope that when you read what I learned,
you can finally begin to understand who you really are.

358
00:32:36,758 --> 00:32:39,050
Please forgive me for not 
telling you the truth.

359
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:41,853
But I did it to protect you.

360
00:32:41,888 --> 00:32:43,409
I love you, Sharon."

361
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:47,186
Are you okay?

362
00:32:47,979 --> 00:32:49,794
Do you wanna stop?

363
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:52,271
No.

364
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,584
What does it say?

365
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:03,593
So much.

366
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:06,450
I know his writing, but this is crazy.

367
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,940
It says:
"Silent Hill was originally a prison colony,

368
00:33:11,941 --> 00:33:14,489
built on ground taken from the native Indians.

369
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:18,044
They called it 
'The Place of the Silent Spirits'".

370
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,258
Never build on the ancient Indian burial grounds.

371
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:23,178
I thought everyone knew that.

372
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:30,751
It says here: 
"Religious zealots called the Order of Valtiel,

373
00:33:30,786 --> 00:33:34,042
secretly ran the town for the last 100 years.

374
00:33:34,077 --> 00:33:39,049
They were waiting for a child to be born
to be a vessel for their god. 

375
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:42,117
Who would then be resurrected and make the world anew."

376
00:33:42,152 --> 00:33:45,447
It sounds like one of those crazy doomsday cults.

377
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,797
Yeah. Sounds like it.

378
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:53,715
There is a newspaper article.

379
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,994
"Fire in the coal mines got out of control"

380
00:33:58,029 --> 00:34:02,789
"The whole place is still burning, deep underground.
Everyone had to leave."

381
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,968
My dad doesn't believe that, though.

382
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:10,247
No?

383
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:13,613
He says the town was cursed by 
the power of a demon child.

384
00:34:13,648 --> 00:34:18,529
Her name was Alessa. This Order
tried to cleanse her with fire.

385
00:34:18,564 --> 00:34:21,721
But they failed. And
Alessa's revenge

386
00:34:21,722 --> 00:34:25,870
was to summon a world of darkness, 
filled with terrifying creatures.

387
00:34:25,905 --> 00:34:30,489
This one, it says, is her "guardian and executioner".

388
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:00,650
We should stop.

389
00:35:00,685 --> 00:35:03,007
- No, I want to keep going.
- I'm tired.

390
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:06,167
I need rest, you need rest.

391
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,431
Do you think they'll find us?

392
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:43,358
Someone will, eventually.

393
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:45,988
- You think we're far?
- No.

394
00:35:47,404 --> 00:35:49,930
No, I think we're very close.

395
00:35:49,965 --> 00:35:52,028
And I don't think you should go...

396
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:54,235
- What?
- I think your dad is right.

397
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,695
I don't think you should
go to Silent Hill.

398
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:56,696
I need to find him.

399
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:59,006
You read his notebooks. He wants you to run.

400
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:01,673
- Vincent...
- No, listen to me. The Order, they want you.

401
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:05,743
I think that's why they took Harry.

402
00:36:05,778 --> 00:36:08,646
- To make you come back.
- I don't have a choice.

403
00:36:08,681 --> 00:36:11,935
- Don't you understand that?
- I understand.

404
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:15,270
I just...

405
00:36:18,488 --> 00:36:21,104
I just don't want anything to happen to you.

406
00:37:03,278 --> 00:37:04,991
You didn't sleep?

407
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:10,056
No.

408
00:37:10,091 --> 00:37:12,711
We can't go any further.

409
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:18,608
We already talked about this.
I have to.

410
00:37:18,643 --> 00:37:22,856
- Why can't you just trust me?
- It's for my dad. You don't understand.

411
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:24,420
- I do.
- No, you don't.

412
00:37:24,455 --> 00:37:26,140
How could you?

413
00:37:26,175 --> 00:37:29,543
Because I am a child of the Order.

414
00:37:31,304 --> 00:37:32,815
What?

415
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,319
I was born and raised in Silent Hill.

416
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:39,020
I was chosen to come into this world, 
to make sure you return.

417
00:37:39,055 --> 00:37:41,038
No…

418
00:37:41,073 --> 00:37:43,166
No, that's not possible.

419
00:37:43,201 --> 00:37:46,432
The Order are trapped in 
Silent Hill. The notebook says so.

420
00:37:46,467 --> 00:37:49,789
It is possible for a few to escape
just for a while,

421
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:55,500
but it requires,
it requires sacrifice, and
 suffering…

422
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,772
You have been chosen for this!

423
00:38:01,401 --> 00:38:04,726
- How could you do this to me?
- My whole life all I've been taught,

424
00:38:04,761 --> 00:38:08,569
All that any of us have taught is that 
Alessa is the great evil of the world.

425
00:38:08,604 --> 00:38:11,039
She trapped us, she brings the darkness.

426
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,743
And you... you are part of that evil.

427
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,605
But I, I know that's not true.

428
00:38:18,019 --> 00:38:22,313
After seeing you, after spending this time 
with you, I know you're not evil, I ...

429
00:38:22,348 --> 00:38:25,470
If you are part of Alessa...

430
00:38:25,505 --> 00:38:27,562
… you're the innocent part.

431
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:30,470
- Every step of the way, you lied.
- I had to.

432
00:38:30,505 --> 00:38:33,837
They were watching, protecting their 
spirits into the world. You saw them.

433
00:38:33,872 --> 00:38:35,198
You took my dad.

434
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,008
Please believe me, I had nothing to do with that,

435
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:40,597
- I'm sorry.
- Why take him, why not just take me?

436
00:38:40,632 --> 00:38:42,892
Because you have to return of your own free will.

437
00:38:42,893 --> 00:38:44,621
Taking him, they knew you'd follow.

438
00:38:45,326 --> 00:38:46,999
Why do I matter so much?

439
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,610
Because the Order can't be 
free until Alessa is gone.

440
00:38:49,611 --> 00:38:53,952
Her power keeps them trapped, and she can't 
be destroyed until she's whole again.

441
00:38:53,987 --> 00:38:57,017
- You will make that happen.
- What about my dad?

442
00:38:57,698 --> 00:39:00,008
- Is he still alive?
- Yes, but not for long.

443
00:39:00,043 --> 00:39:03,717
My mother, Claudia, won't keep him 
alive after she has what she wants.

444
00:39:03,752 --> 00:39:06,195
- Where is he?
- In the sanctuary beneath the town.

445
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,052
- Wait, Heather, stop...
- No!

446
00:39:08,793 --> 00:39:10,910
You need this.

447
00:39:10,945 --> 00:39:14,859
You have to find the other half. It's the only 
way you'll be able to save your dad.

448
00:39:16,052 --> 00:39:17,859
My grandfather has it.

449
00:39:19,202 --> 00:39:21,391
The one in the asylum?

450
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:24,104
Yes, Leonard Wolf.

451
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,648
- It's dangerous. Let me help you.
- No! Get off of me!

452
00:39:28,683 --> 00:39:30,829
- Listen!
- No...

453
00:39:30,864 --> 00:39:34,071
- What is happening?
- The Darkness is coming.

454
00:39:37,224 --> 00:39:38,316
Heather...

455
00:39:38,749 --> 00:39:40,139
What's going on?

456
00:39:50,885 --> 00:39:52,923
Stop! Make it stop!

457
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,560
- You did this.
- No.

458
00:40:01,595 --> 00:40:03,620
It's not me.

459
00:40:03,655 --> 00:40:05,050
How could it be me?

460
00:40:12,156 --> 00:40:14,406
Because you are part of Alessa.

461
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:20,059
You're so close, you allowed 
the darkness to break through.

462
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,071
Vincent, what is going on?

463
00:40:26,106 --> 00:40:28,374
I don't know.

464
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:29,895
Vincent!

465
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
WELCOME TO SILENT HILL

466
00:43:48,932 --> 00:43:50,602
Burn the Witch!

467
00:43:52,785 --> 00:43:55,817
You should not be here.

468
00:44:00,914 --> 00:44:03,520
They will use you.

469
00:44:03,555 --> 00:44:06,482
We will all suffer now.

470
00:44:06,517 --> 00:44:09,166
I know who you are.

471
00:44:10,201 --> 00:44:12,595
You're her mother.

472
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:14,854
Alessa's mother.

473
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:18,988
How could you let them burn her?

474
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:21,919
No, I loved her.

475
00:44:21,954 --> 00:44:24,593
It's alright, sweetheart.

476
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:28,795
It's okay. It's alright

477
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:31,014
I was deceived.

478
00:44:34,615 --> 00:44:36,670
I never wanted this for her.

479
00:44:36,705 --> 00:44:38,770
Alessa: Where are you taking me? 

480
00:44:38,805 --> 00:44:40,902
Mommy! Mommy!

481
00:44:45,406 --> 00:44:48,171
Alessa was special.

482
00:44:48,206 --> 00:44:52,208
She was the only one who could 
survive the fire, that's why she was chosen.

483
00:44:52,243 --> 00:44:54,555
No, no!

484
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:01,482
But it only led to our damnation.

485
00:45:01,517 --> 00:45:04,059
You all got what you deserved.

486
00:45:04,838 --> 00:45:09,052
Yes, and I became the mother of the demon.

487
00:45:10,282 --> 00:45:12,960
But you are her daughter.

488
00:45:14,638 --> 00:45:16,385
What are you talking about?

489
00:45:16,993 --> 00:45:21,342
Alessa didn't die in the fire,
but she suffered so much.

490
00:45:23,228 --> 00:45:26,528
For pain was only matched by the rage.

491
00:45:26,563 --> 00:45:30,076
And with that rage, her powers grew…

492
00:45:30,111 --> 00:45:32,486
... beyond all comprehension.

493
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:38,392
Alessa knew there was a part of her, 
that could still be free from pain.

494
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:44,506
So she took that last, 
innocent part of her soul

495
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:49,839
and placed it into a
new born, orphan child.

496
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:54,339
You.

497
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,484
You were secretly taken from here,

498
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:02,774
to be raised by loving, but unaware parents.

499
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,638
You're the only part of Alessa
that feels love.

500
00:46:11,673 --> 00:46:16,578
You have the balance of hate.
You should never have come back.

501
00:46:16,613 --> 00:46:19,933
Because now you have given the order 
what they could never have...

502
00:46:21,341 --> 00:46:24,728
A way to destroy Alessa. 
And you.

503
00:46:24,763 --> 00:46:27,021
Where is my father?

504
00:46:27,056 --> 00:46:30,564
There is nothing you can do to 
save him without damning yourself.

505
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:33,044
I don't care.
Just tell me what you know.

506
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,269
I know the darkness is coming.

507
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:47,403
It's safer to be inside.

508
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:48,724
Run. 

509
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,725
Run!

510
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:03,347
No!

511
00:49:52,254 --> 00:49:54,000
What?

512
00:49:54,035 --> 00:49:56,134
Help me.

513
00:50:06,746 --> 00:50:07,945
No…

514
00:50:09,834 --> 00:50:11,507
Run.

515
00:50:22,821 --> 00:50:24,744
I'm here, I'll help you!

516
00:50:26,147 --> 00:50:28,430
- What happened?
- Run, she's coming.

517
00:50:28,465 --> 00:50:30,282
Who's coming?

518
00:50:45,117 --> 00:50:46,832
Come on! Run!

519
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:23,296
- Where did you come from?
- I took a wrong turn...

520
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:25,252
Got lost in the fog...

521
00:51:34,046 --> 00:51:35,342
"EXIT"

522
00:51:35,377 --> 00:51:36,886
Go! Come on!

523
00:51:41,605 --> 00:51:42,934
No!

524
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:45,589
This way.

525
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:06,527
Run!

526
00:52:09,312 --> 00:52:10,482
Go!

527
00:52:23,113 --> 00:52:25,293
My own son...

528
00:52:25,328 --> 00:52:27,301
Mother, please...

529
00:52:27,336 --> 00:52:29,433
... betrayed us.

530
00:52:30,131 --> 00:52:32,448
She is not evil.

531
00:52:33,698 --> 00:52:37,921
Your mind is corrupted by her darkness.

532
00:52:39,215 --> 00:52:42,861
You were young to be given this task...

533
00:52:42,896 --> 00:52:45,767
I understand.

534
00:52:47,428 --> 00:52:48,969
You created Alessa.

535
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:52,102
The darkness is your evil reflected back at us.

536
00:52:52,196 --> 00:52:55,208
- She is innocent.
- She is innocent?

537
00:52:55,243 --> 00:52:59,800
- You are insane, just as your grandfather is insane.
- Kill him! Burn him!	

538
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:00,801
Make him suffer!

539
00:53:00,836 --> 00:53:02,800
- Let the God judge him!
- No!

540
00:53:08,372 --> 00:53:10,674
You succeeded.

541
00:53:10,709 --> 00:53:15,376
Even in your madness,
you guided her back to us.

542
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:23,367
- And a broken mind can be mended.
- No.

543
00:53:23,402 --> 00:53:24,783
Mother, please don't.

544
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:27,214
- Take him to the asylum. Cure him.
- No.

545
00:53:27,249 --> 00:53:28,656
No!

546
00:53:49,306 --> 00:53:51,902
"Brookhaven Asylum"

547
00:53:52,847 --> 00:53:54,001
Leonard.

548
00:54:42,802 --> 00:54:45,301
(Do you think someone knows?)

549
00:54:45,336 --> 00:54:47,066
(No.)

550
00:54:47,101 --> 00:54:49,174
(No one knows.)

551
00:54:49,209 --> 00:54:50,864
(Okay.)

552
00:54:50,899 --> 00:54:53,443
(I love you too.) 

553
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,044
Leonard Wolf.

554
00:55:51,045 --> 00:55:53,131
Okay.

555
00:55:57,718 --> 00:56:00,083
S-12.

556
00:56:02,479 --> 00:56:04,305
12.

557
00:58:56,312 --> 00:58:57,400
Leonard.

558
00:58:59,497 --> 00:59:01,781
Hello, child.

559
00:59:05,148 --> 00:59:09,030
Please come closer,
so I could touch you.

560
00:59:10,002 --> 00:59:12,053
I don't think so.

561
00:59:12,088 --> 00:59:14,566
- Did Claudia send you?
- Claudia?

562
00:59:15,068 --> 00:59:18,085
- Yeah.
- No. She put you here.

563
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,803
My own daughter says that I'm 
corrupted by the darkness.

564
00:59:21,804 --> 00:59:24,403
She says that I’m a monster.

565
00:59:25,681 --> 00:59:28,145
She's far worse than I am.

566
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:32,385
She is also corrupted by the same darkness.

567
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:36,314
- I am looking for my father.
- Is he lost?

568
00:59:36,746 --> 00:59:38,609
He's in Silent Hill.

569
00:59:39,417 --> 00:59:42,832
There are many Silent Hills.
Are you sure it's this one?

570
00:59:42,867 --> 00:59:44,203
Vincent said you know how to...

571
00:59:44,238 --> 00:59:46,733
Vincent, that little traitor…

572
00:59:46,768 --> 00:59:50,052
My own flesh and blood turned against me!

573
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:52,693
Listen. Ahh.

574
00:59:52,728 --> 00:59:56,277
You may be able to hear 
the cries of his torment.

575
00:59:57,557 --> 00:59:58,798
He's here?

576
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:02,459
Where else would you go to mend your mind?

577
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,769
Like yours is?

578
01:00:04,804 --> 01:00:05,914
Why ..

579
01:00:06,462 --> 01:00:10,848
I'm just...  an ongoing project.

580
01:00:12,433 --> 01:00:15,391
I have half of this.

581
01:00:15,426 --> 01:00:18,316
- Will it help me?
- Listen...

582
01:00:18,351 --> 01:00:21,419
I'm blind, child.

583
01:00:21,454 --> 01:00:25,202
I cannot see what you have there.

584
01:00:25,237 --> 01:00:30,045
Place ​​it in my hand
and I will try to help you.

585
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,412
Don't be afraid.

586
01:00:32,777 --> 01:00:34,382
Come on.

587
01:00:43,341 --> 01:00:47,198
- You know what it is. 
- I was the Master of the Order.

588
01:00:48,112 --> 01:00:51,395
How could I not know 
the Seal of Metatron?

589
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:56,686
It was stolen from me and used 
by her to escape with the child.

590
01:00:56,721 --> 01:01:00,837
Without it we cannot summon the god.

591
01:01:00,872 --> 01:01:03,782
It is a key. What does it unlock?

592
01:01:05,872 --> 01:01:09,254
The true nature of things.

593
01:01:09,289 --> 01:01:11,576
I need to find the other half.

594
01:01:14,786 --> 01:01:19,040
But you've already found it.
The other half is in me!

595
01:01:19,433 --> 01:01:21,428
What are you doing?
No!

596
01:01:21,896 --> 01:01:23,266
Stop!

597
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,324
Stop!

598
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,915
Now...  I see the truth of you.

599
01:01:42,801 --> 01:01:46,101
You're a demon!
You must be destroyed!

600
01:01:46,136 --> 01:01:47,629
Not today.

601
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:16,670
Two halves coming together.

602
01:03:16,705 --> 01:03:18,752
It's complete.

603
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:48,712
Alessa?

604
01:03:50,654 --> 01:03:52,607
Can you feel me?

605
01:03:55,056 --> 01:03:58,031
You know I'm here, don't you?

606
01:03:58,066 --> 01:04:01,056
You know I've got the Seal of Metatron.

607
01:04:32,824 --> 01:04:35,785
Somebody help me.

608
01:05:52,656 --> 01:05:54,143
No.

609
01:06:57,597 --> 01:06:59,301
Get back! Get back!

610
01:07:02,194 --> 01:07:03,524
And you!

611
01:07:05,712 --> 01:07:07,170
Get back!

612
01:07:07,205 --> 01:07:08,690
- Look out!
- Get back!

613
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:19,944
Do it! Do it!

614
01:08:29,619 --> 01:08:31,704
How can I find my dad?

615
01:08:31,739 --> 01:08:34,448
- Heather, help me.
- Tell me where he is.

616
01:08:36,402 --> 01:08:40,403
In the sanctuary, beneath 
the amusement park.

617
01:08:40,438 --> 01:08:42,546
I can help you.

618
01:08:47,962 --> 01:08:49,297
Okay.

619
01:08:57,931 --> 01:08:59,325
Hurry!

620
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,840
I am hurrying!

621
01:09:01,896 --> 01:09:02,980
Damn .

622
01:09:15,579 --> 01:09:16,817
Stop!

623
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:19,057
- Heather, stop.
- We need a knife.

624
01:09:56,527 --> 01:09:58,875
How can you live like this?

625
01:09:58,910 --> 01:10:02,164
This darkness, those creatures?

626
01:10:03,901 --> 01:10:05,703
That's all I've ever known.

627
01:10:06,657 --> 01:10:08,613
My reality.

628
01:10:10,843 --> 01:10:13,417
Darkness should have faded by now.

629
01:10:13,452 --> 01:10:16,857
- Why hasn't it?
- You're so close to Alessa,

630
01:10:16,892 --> 01:10:19,759
two halves coming together again, 
it's changing the world.

631
01:10:20,887 --> 01:10:22,652
What's gonna happen?

632
01:10:22,687 --> 01:10:24,758
That's up to you.

633
01:10:27,995 --> 01:10:30,477
Lakeside Amusement Park is over there.

634
01:10:30,868 --> 01:10:33,668
And the entrance to the sanctuary.

635
01:10:40,584 --> 01:10:42,293
Do you think you can save him?

636
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:47,512
I have to try. My dad gave up 
his life to protect me.

637
01:10:47,547 --> 01:10:51,347
- I think he'd want you to leave.
- You don't know that.

638
01:10:53,677 --> 01:10:56,912
If he loved you, he wouldn't
want you to be in any danger.

639
01:10:58,417 --> 01:11:03,947
And if you love someone, you know 
that you will never give up.

640
01:11:50,283 --> 01:11:51,795
No, wait!

641
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:54,001
Get down.

642
01:11:54,036 --> 01:11:57,475
- Look.
- Are they soldiers?

643
01:11:57,843 --> 01:11:59,410
Not really.

644
01:11:59,445 --> 01:12:03,660
We call them "the Brethren".
The most devout servants of the Order.

645
01:12:05,026 --> 01:12:08,007
See the masks? They won't breathe 
the air of the darkness.

646
01:12:08,042 --> 01:12:09,852
They think it corrupts them.

647
01:12:15,783 --> 01:12:17,655
I hope you find him.

648
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:21,112
I hope live free and happy, 
It's more than I ever did.

649
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:24,333
What are you talking about?

650
01:12:28,599 --> 01:12:30,096
Vincent, no!

651
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:12,086
- Alessa?
- Daughter.

652
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:15,678
Sister.

653
01:14:15,713 --> 01:14:18,145
- Self.
- No.

654
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:21,674
I gave you life so you 
could live my dream.

655
01:14:21,709 --> 01:14:25,044
You're the part of me that 
can be free of this pain.

656
01:14:25,079 --> 01:14:27,263
Live, and feel love.

657
01:14:27,298 --> 01:14:28,823
Do you feel nothing?

658
01:14:28,858 --> 01:14:30,972
Nothing but hate.

659
01:14:35,853 --> 01:14:38,210
They say you are a demon.

660
01:14:38,245 --> 01:14:41,737
- They are right.
- You created this nightmare.

661
01:14:41,772 --> 01:14:45,831
Everyone has a different nightmare in Silent Hill.

662
01:14:45,866 --> 01:14:48,508
- I am theirs.
- I have to save my father.

663
01:14:48,543 --> 01:14:51,711
He's not my father, or yours.

664
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:55,304
And sacrifices, have to be made.

665
01:14:55,305 --> 01:14:56,383
Go to hell!

666
01:14:56,798 --> 01:15:00,802
Don't you see?
We're already here.

667
01:15:08,648 --> 01:15:12,091
And you're not welcome!

668
01:15:15,175 --> 01:15:19,748
Do you think, I won't destroy you?

669
01:15:19,783 --> 01:15:22,086
I don't care.

670
01:15:22,121 --> 01:15:24,920
I am you.

671
01:15:28,993 --> 01:15:33,038
Time to take back what I gave you!

672
01:15:41,022 --> 01:15:43,135
Stop!

673
01:15:45,418 --> 01:15:50,048
We are one, Heather.

674
01:17:43,348 --> 01:17:44,660
Dad!

675
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,250
Sharon!

676
01:17:48,958 --> 01:17:50,326
Sharon...

677
01:17:56,326 --> 01:17:57,693
Don't hurt her!

678
01:18:05,932 --> 01:18:07,848
What do you want from me?

679
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:09,722
Look around you.

680
01:18:09,956 --> 01:18:11,704
This was our sanctuary.

681
01:18:12,157 --> 01:18:16,470
A last, safe place from the darkness.

682
01:18:16,505 --> 01:18:20,933
And now, even here, has fallen to her evil.

683
01:18:20,968 --> 01:18:25,622
But praise the god, 
that you are here, finally.

684
01:18:25,657 --> 01:18:30,291
- You have delivered us.
- I have done nothing for you.

685
01:18:30,326 --> 01:18:32,747
You have done everything.

686
01:18:32,782 --> 01:18:36,107
Defeated Alyssa.
Re-joined the seal.

687
01:18:37,157 --> 01:18:39,080
You are the savior.

688
01:18:48,608 --> 01:18:51,298
If I've done so much,

689
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:53,946
Then let my father go.

690
01:18:54,722 --> 01:19:00,540
He cannot go. His blood 
will feed the newborn god ..

691
01:19:02,678 --> 01:19:05,550
Just as your body will be its incubator.

692
01:19:05,585 --> 01:19:07,699
Why?

693
01:19:08,847 --> 01:19:11,681
- Why me?
- It is your destiny.

694
01:19:12,339 --> 01:19:15,857
You have been chosen many 
years ago to be the vessel.

695
01:19:15,892 --> 01:19:19,699
The god can only be born through your flesh.

696
01:19:20,350 --> 01:19:23,904
And then we will be free from this prison

697
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,604
to cleanse the world of its sins.

698
01:19:30,976 --> 01:19:36,975
And all we need... is your body.

699
01:19:37,543 --> 01:19:39,280
No!

700
01:19:39,315 --> 01:19:41,196
You leave her alone!

701
01:19:43,918 --> 01:19:48,670
You have the Seal of Metatron.
With it, I can summon the god.

702
01:19:48,705 --> 01:19:50,149
Give it to me.

703
01:20:00,277 --> 01:20:04,457
Take it, I want to see 
the truth of what you are.

704
01:20:57,589 --> 01:20:59,204
- Dad!
- Sharon.

705
01:22:36,237 --> 01:22:38,231
The ash…

706
01:22:38,266 --> 01:22:40,592
It’s stopped! 

707
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:45,220
- Was it you?
- No, it's not me.

708
01:22:45,255 --> 01:22:49,168
I think things are gonna be 
different around here from now on..

709
01:22:49,203 --> 01:22:53,279
The Order's power is broken.
Alessa's nightmare is over.

710
01:22:53,314 --> 01:22:55,989
- She's gone.
- Another one will come.

711
01:22:57,976 --> 01:23:00,737
This is the place of lost souls.

712
01:23:04,886 --> 01:23:06,667
What's wrong?

713
01:23:07,313 --> 01:23:10,407
- I can't leave.
- Why?

714
01:23:13,096 --> 01:23:16,548
- I have to stay here.
- But dad, we're free.

715
01:23:16,583 --> 01:23:18,179
We're safe.

716
01:23:18,214 --> 01:23:21,042
- For the first time.
- I'm gonna find your mother.

717
01:23:21,077 --> 01:23:24,459
You saved my life.
And I can never repay you.

718
01:23:24,494 --> 01:23:27,078
But Rose is still trapped here somewhere .

719
01:23:27,563 --> 01:23:30,129
- I'm gonna find her.
- Let me help you find her.

720
01:23:30,164 --> 01:23:34,798
No. I promised her, once you 
were safe, I’ll come back.

721
01:23:34,833 --> 01:23:38,902
This is my task.
You've done what you had to do.

722
01:23:39,781 --> 01:23:45,647
Now, I want you to be free, finally.

723
01:23:45,682 --> 01:23:48,465
Do you understand why I have to do this?

724
01:23:55,125 --> 01:23:58,175
You're everything I could've ever wished for.

725
01:24:04,318 --> 01:24:08,466
- I love you, baby.
- I love you too, Dad.

726
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,728
Vincent, look after my little girl, 
do you hear?

727
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:22,385
I don't think she needs me for that.

728
01:24:58,978 --> 01:25:00,851
Come on.

729
01:25:01,586 --> 01:25:03,866
Yeah.

730
01:25:34,818 --> 01:25:36,177
Come on in.

731
01:25:36,212 --> 01:25:37,981
Watch your step.

732
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:41,799
- Thanks.
- No problem.

733
01:25:42,583 --> 01:25:46,166
You're lucky I came by.
I haven't been this way in a long time.

734
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,685
- Travis Grady.
- Vincent.

735
01:25:50,904 --> 01:25:53,232
- Sharon.
- Nice to meet you.

736
01:25:53,267 --> 01:25:55,542
So where're you two lovebirds headed?

737
01:25:56,558 --> 01:25:59,624
Just take us as far away 
from here as you can.

738
01:26:00,187 --> 01:26:02,461
- Amen to that!
- Got it.

739
01:26:02,461 --> 01:26:04,460
