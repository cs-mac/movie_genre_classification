1
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:21,276
I heard the news of my nomination
and there's just one thing I wanna say...

2
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,613
<i>Here with the admitted arch-enemies...</i>

3
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:32,329
<i>...in a state of apparent friendship,
World War II had begun.</i>

4
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,651
<i>In</i> January 1943...

5
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,031
<i>...just days before the final German
surrender at Stalingrad...</i>

6
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:08,194
<i>...Roosevelt and Churchill met
at Casablanca in French Morocco.</i>

7
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,449
<i>Stalin was not in attendance.</i>

8
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:19,042
<i>He'd withdrawn his ambassadors from London
and Washington. The alliance was in crisis.</i>

9
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:22,712
<i>The Red Army was moving west
against the Germans.</i>

10
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,548
<i>The momentum had shifted.</i>

11
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:30,308
<i>Appreciation of the Soviet sacrifice
was finally growing in the U.S.</i>

12
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:34,140
<i>Even fervent anti-communist
media-baron Henry Luce...</i>

13
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:39,025
<i>...made Stalin Time magazine's
Man of The Year in 1942...</i>

14
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,685
<i>...praising his industrialization, stating:</i>

15
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,822
<i>"Stalin's methods were tough,
but they paid off."</i>

16
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:54,202
<i>Another Luce magazine, Lite, painted the Soviet
Union as a "quasi-America, with its citizens...</i>

17
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:58,710
<i>...one hell of a people who to a remarkable
degree look like Americans...</i>

18
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:02,373
<i>...dress like Americans
and think like Americans."</i>

19
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:09,388
<i>His ruthless secret police was even described
as a National Police similar to the FBI.</i>

20
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:24,103
<i>Roosevelt felt he had to take action,
or he risked the break-up of the alliance.</i>

21
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:28,740
<i>Both he and Churchill feared Stalin
might indeed make a deal with Hitler...</i>

22
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,652
<i>...to save the Soviet Union
further destruction.</i>

23
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,489
<i>After all, he'd done it before.</i>

24
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:40,537
<i>But on many issues Roosevelt, unlike
Churchill, saw eye-to-eye with Stalin.</i>

25
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:45,424
<i>Both wanted a weakened, pastoralized
postwar Germany without industry.</i>

26
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:50,133
<i>Germany's militarism
was the cause of unrest.</i>

27
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,923
<i>We either have to castrate
the German people...</i>

28
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,343
<i>...or we have to treat
them in such a manner...</i>

29
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,433
<i>...so that they can't just go on
reproducing people...</i>

30
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,314
<i>...who want to continue
the way they have in the past.</i>

31
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,562
<i>It was at Casablanca
that the president announced...</i>

32
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,106
<i>...a policy of Unconditional Surrender.</i>

33
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:13,277
<i>He wanted to send a message to Stalin
that the U.S. would not rest...</i>

34
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,447
<i>...until Hitler's Germany was destroyed.</i>

35
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:22,328
<i>Unconditional Surrender was a declaration of
war not merely on the enemy governments...</i>

36
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:25,623
<i>...but on the German
and Japanese people themselves.</i>

37
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:31,922
<i>Which in its unintended way would lead to
terror bombing of civilian populations...</i>

38
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,931
<i>...harden the resistance
of those populations...</i>

39
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,140
<i>...and result in the most
controversial decision of the war...</i>

40
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,101
<i>...the dropping of the atomic bomb
on Japan.</i>

41
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:50,030
<i>In hindsight one might argue that the
declaration of Unconditional Surrender...</i>

42
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,533
<i>...was one of Roosevelt's
greatest blunders.</i>

43
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:57,997
<i>To make matters worse, Roosevelt
and Churchill confirmed at Casablanca...</i>

44
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:02,331
<i>...the Allied decision to land in Sicily
after North Africa...</i>

45
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,462
<i>...again postponing the second front
in Europe...</i>

46
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,373
<i>...and relegating their nations to further
irrelevance...</i>

47
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,635
<i>...in determining the outcome of the war.</i>

48
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:16,507
<i>This would lead to the disastrous
Italian campaign of 1943 to '45...</i>

49
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:22,059
<i>...that achieved little but a fierce
bloodletting of allied troops in Sicily...</i>

50
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,019
<i>...and at slaughterhouses
like the beachhead at Anzio...</i>

51
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:29,733
<i>...and the four battles for Monte Cassino,
which did little damage to the Nazis.</i>

52
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,466
<i>With the Allies bogged down in Italy...</i>

53
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:56,051
<i>...and the Soviets increasingly suspicious
of British intentions...</i>

54
00:04:56,588 --> 00:05:00,343
<i>...Roosevelt and Stalin met
10 months after Casablanca...</i>

55
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,854
<i>...for the very first time
in Teheran in Iran...</i>

56
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,562
<i>...in November 1943.</i>

57
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:11,900
<i>After trying unsuccessfully
to exclude Churchill from the meeting...</i>

58
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:16,238
<i>...Roosevelt accepted Stalin's offer
to stay in the Soviet embassy.</i>

59
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,280
<i>But Roosevelt found Stalin cold and aloof
during the first three days of meetings...</i>

60
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,244
<i>...and feared he would not succeed.</i>

61
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,498
<i>But on the fourth day...</i>

62
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:30,256
<i>...after teasing Churchill in front of Stalin
about his Britishness and about his cigars...</i>

63
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,917
<i>...Churchill, according to Roosevelt,
grew red and scowled.</i>

64
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:37,588
<i>And the more he did,
the more Stalin smiled...</i>

65
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:43,227
<i>...until finally Stalin broke out into a deep,
hearty guffaw at the expense of Churchill.</i>

66
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,935
<i>And before long,
Roosevelt was calling him Uncle Joe.</i>

67
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,349
<i>The ice had been broken...</i>

68
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:54,022
<i>...and Roosevelt felt that he and Stalin
were now talking like men and brothers.</i>

69
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,442
<i>Roosevelt reiterated to
the Soviet leader...</i>

70
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:02,704
<i>...that he would open the long-delayed
second front the following spring.</i>

71
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,581
<i>Churchill was forced to commit...</i>

72
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:09,586
<i>...but argued still the landing should be
made to the east through the Balkans...</i>

73
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,838
<i>...heading off the advancing Soviets.</i>

74
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:17,879
<i>The PM is thinking too much of
a postwar world and where England will be.</i>

75
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,514
<i>He's scared of letting the Russians
get too strong.</i>

76
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:26,429
<i>Roosevelt clearly indicated he would allow
the Soviets considerable latitude...</i>

77
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:30,316
<i>...in shaping the future of Eastern Europe
and the Baltic States...</i>

78
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,818
<i>...requesting only that Stalin
implement changes judiciously...</i>

79
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,526
<i>...and not offend world opinion.</i>

80
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:40,158
<i>Roosevelt had written Stalin
a persona} note promising:</i>

81
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,321
<i>The United States will never
lend its support in any way...</i>

82
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,160
<i>...to any provisional
government in Poland...</i>

83
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,997
<i>...that would be inimical
to your interests.</i>

84
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,420
<i>Crucially,
Roosevelt made important headway...</i>

85
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:56,254
<i>...when he got Stalin to agree
to enter the war against Japan...</i>

86
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,386
<i>...when the war against Germany
was concluded.</i>

87
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:06,852
<i>Exhausted, Roosevelt wrote of the
Teheran conference, we made great progress.</i>

88
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:13,017
<i>To use an American,
and somewhat ungrammatical colloquialism...</i>

89
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:19,190
<i>...I may say that I got along fine
with Marshal Stalin.</i>

90
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:23,202
<i>And I believe
that we are going to get along very well...</i>

91
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,241
<i>...with him and the Russian people,
very well indeed.</i>

92
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:37,917
<i>The Soviet war continued
with a bloody campaign in Belorussia...</i>

93
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:42,884
<i>...followed by their entry into Poland
in January 1944...</i>

94
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,266
<i>...Russia's ancient border enemy.</i>

95
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:51,271
<i>The retaking of Poland and particularly
Warsaw is a tragic and bloody story.</i>

96
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:55,059
<i>Few suffered as much as the Poles
in this long war.</i>

97
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:59,480
<i>Six million were killed,
3 million of them Jewish.</i>

98
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:04,402
<i>But the U.S.S.R. too paid a stiff price
to free Poland.</i>

99
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:08,538
<i>Six hundred thousand Soviets perished.</i>

100
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:13,669
<i>It was here that the first death camps were
actually found in 1944 by Soviet troops...</i>

101
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:20,676
<i>...and revealed unquestionably to the world,
pictures of the true insanity of Hitler's regime.</i>

102
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:26,257
<i>The Soviets quickly set up
a friendly government in Lublin...</i>

103
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:31,179
<i>...that cracked down on the opposition,
triggering</i> a <i>civil war.</i>

104
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,974
<i>They had excluded the fiercely
anti-communist representatives...</i>

105
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,520
<i>...of the Polish exile government
that had been set up in London.</i>

106
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,530
<i>The westerners thought of them
as democrats...</i>

107
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:47,445
<i>...but Stalin said they were terrorists
descendants of the white Russians...</i>

108
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:53,288
<i>...who had fought against the revolution
in the Russian Civil War of 1919-1922.</i>

109
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,080
<i>No stranger himself to terrorist tactics...</i>

110
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:03,343
<i>...Stalin, in order to prevail against
the hated anti-communist Poles in London...</i>

111
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:08,678
<i>...committed the dual atrocities of killing
thousands of Polish army officers...</i>

112
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,468
<i>...in the Katyn Forest in 1940.</i>

113
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:17,812
<i>And then in 1944, he ordered
the Red Army to halt outside the capital...</i>

114
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:22,980
<i>...white the Germans crushed
the native Warsaw uprising.</i>

115
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:29,074
<i>Soviet defenders argued that the Red Army had
exhausted itself in a grueling 45-day...</i>

116
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,954
<i>...450-mile advance
against tough German troops...</i>

117
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,834
<i>...over-stretching their supply
and communication lines...</i>

118
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,586
<i>...that they needed to stand down.</i>

119
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:43,125
<i>Differences over Poland would become
the single greatest source of distrust...</i>

120
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:49,014
<i>...between the US, Britain, and the
Soviet Union during and after the war.</i>

121
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:52,597
<i>But to be fair,
many westerners did not understand...</i>

122
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:58,937
<i>...that anti-Semitism had long been common among
a significant portion of Polish Catholics.</i>

123
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,691
<i>Or that to Stalin, Poland was a matter
of life and death for the Soviet Union...</i>

124
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:08,154
<i>...because the Polish territories were the
corridor through which the hated Germans...</i>

125
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:12,446
<i>...had twice passed into Russia
in the 20th century.</i>

126
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:17,664
<i>For these reasons, Stalin demanded and
enforced a friendly government on his border.</i>

127
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:23,083
<i>It was no fess an issue to him than Canada
or Mexico was for the United States.</i>

128
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:29,259
<i>Through 1944 and '45,
the Soviets continued to advance...</i>

129
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,470
<i>...taking Romania, Bulgaria,
Hungary, Czechoslovakia...</i>

130
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:38,605
<i>...and with the significant help
of Partisan Guerillas, Yugoslavia.</i>

131
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:44,896
<i>Mile by mile across eastern and south-eastern
Europe, the Germans fought to the last man.</i>

132
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,941
<i>Cities became fortresses
and were reduced to rubble.</i>

133
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,610
<i>Warsaw, Budapest, Vienna.</i>

134
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:57,033
<i>An estimated million Soviet troops
perished liberating these areas.</i>

135
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,870
<i>And as the Soviets fought their way
to Berlin from several directions...</i>

136
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,255
<i>...in the west on June 6th, 1944...</i>

137
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:08,669
<i>...the long-delayed second front
was finally opened...</i>

138
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:12,135
<i>...one and a half years after Roosevelt
first promised it to Stalin.</i>

139
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,267
<i>The largest armada
the world had ever seen...</i>

140
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:20,597
<i>...involving 11,000 planes
and some 4000 ships.</i>

141
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,524
<i>Over 100,000 allied troops...</i>

142
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:28,439
<i>...and 30,000 vehicles
landed on the French beach at Normandy.</i>

143
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,324
<i>An estimated 3,000 men died
in this landing.</i>

144
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:38,574
<i>Allied forces were now approaching
Germany from both east and west.</i>

145
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,414
<i>Victory was inevitable.</i>

146
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:50,635
<i>A month later in July 1944, a key event in
the future of the world was taking shape.</i>

147
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,842
<i>The Democratic Party convention
opened in Chicago.</i>

148
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,882
<i>His health clearly failing...</i>

149
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:00,646
<i>...Roosevelt easily secured the nomination
for an unprecedented fourth term.</i>

150
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:06,276
<i>Henry Wallace, his vice president, was probably
the second most popular man in America...</i>

151
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,776
<i>...the people's choice
to be his running mate.</i>

152
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,992
<i>But he had made many enemies
over the years.</i>

153
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:19,122
<i>In May 1942, Wallace
had given the acclaimed Common Man speech.</i>

154
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,580
Some have spoken of the American century.

155
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:28,499
I say that the century on which we are entering,
the century which will come out of this war...

156
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:33,466
...can be and must be
the century of the common man.

157
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:37,178
<i>There must be neither military
nor economic imperialism.</i>

158
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:44,599
The march of freedom of the past 150 years
has been a great revolution of the people.

159
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:50,529
There were the American revolution,
the French revolution...

160
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:55,944
...the Latin American revolutions,
the Russian revolution.

161
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,362
Each spoke for the common man.

162
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:02,874
<i>Some went to excess,
but people broke their way to the light.</i>

163
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:08,914
<i>He called for a worldwide peoples'
revolution and an end to colonialism.</i>

164
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,550
<i>His speech was received coldly
across the Atlantic.</i>

165
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:18,261
<i>Churchill charged his secret agents
in the U.S. to spy on Wallace.</i>

166
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,518
<i>Wallace detested the British Empire.</i>

167
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:26,182
<i>I said bluntly that I thought
the notion of Anglo-Saxon superiority...</i>

168
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:31,399
<i>...inherent in Churchill's approach,
would be offensive to many.</i>

169
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,609
<i>Churchill had had quite a bit of whiskey...</i>

170
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:39,244
<i>...said, why be apologetic about Anglo-Saxon
superiority, that we were superior...</i>

171
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:43,908
<i>...that we had the common heritage that had been
worked out over the centuries in England...</i>

172
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,917
<i>...and had been perfected
by our constitution.</i>

173
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:53,125
<i>Wallace's hatred of imperialism
was universally known and widely acclaimed.</i>

174
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:58,593
<i>In March 1943, Roosevelt sent him
to Latin America on</i> a <i>goodwill tour...</i>

175
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:03,807
<i>...secretly charging him
to recruit nations for the allied cause.</i>

176
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:09,099
<i>Sixty five thousand greeted him in Costa
Rica, 15 percent of the population.</i>

177
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:14,271
<i>More than one million cheered as he
moved down the streets of Santiago, Chile.</i>

178
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:32,213
<i>The Vice President returned with a dozen
countries declaring war on Germany.</i>

179
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,549
<i>It was more than anyone
had imagined possible.</i>

180
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,632
<i>Back home in a Gallup poll...</i>

181
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:44,222
<i>...Wallace was the choice of 57 percent
of democratic voters to succeed Roosevelt.</i>

182
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:48,806
<i>But opposition to him
from inside the party was enormous.</i>

183
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,851
<i>Jesse Jones was allied to
powerful Democratic Party bosses...</i>

184
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:57,443
<i>...led by party treasurer
and oil millionaire Edwin Pauley.</i>

185
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,403
<i>United by their hatred of Wallace...</i>

186
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:04,617
<i>...their champion was a man known
to many as the assistant president.</i>

187
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:10,536
<i>James Byrnes had been raised in the hot-house
politics of sultry South Carolina...</i>

188
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:16,049
...an <i>environment where white superiority
and segregation trumped all other issues.</i>

189
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:22,510
<i>He was a driving force behind blocking
a federal anti-lynching bill in 1938.</i>

190
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:26,176
<i>After making his name
smashing trade unions in the south...</i>

191
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,312
<i>...Byrnes became a powerful U.S. senator.</i>

192
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:34,647
<i>If you wanted something done
on Capitol Hill, you saw Jimmy Byrnes.</i>

193
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,063
<i>By 1943,
the mood in Washington had shifted.</i>

194
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,697
<i>It was no longer the New Deal...</i>

195
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:44,202
<i>...and Roosevelt removed Wallace
from the Bureau of Economic Warfare...</i>

196
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:48,157
<i>...and put Byrnes in charge
of the new office of war mobilization.</i>

197
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:53,662
<i>But Wallace still had a powerful supporter,
the American working man.</i>

198
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,256
<i>Today, few remember that the Second
World War saw more strikes...</i>

199
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:04,264
<i>...by organized labor
than at any other time in U.S. history.</i>

200
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:09,144
<i>In 1944 alone 1 million workers
were on strike at one time or another.</i>

201
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,806
<i>The war had rejuvenated
American capitalism.</i>

202
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:16,769
<i>Corporate profits rose
from $6.4 billion in 1940...</i>

203
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:20,689
<i>...to $10.8 billion in 1944.</i>

204
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,574
<i>Put simply, the war was good business.</i>

205
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:28,284
<i>But in the face of rising corporate
profits, workers' wages were frozen.</i>

206
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:32,076
<i>As a result,
a wave of strikes rocked the nation.</i>

207
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,045
<i>Americans versus Americans...</i>

208
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,798
<i>...a tragic spectacle in
these critical times...</i>

209
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:43,507
<i>...when unity is essential
to the preservation of democracy.</i>

210
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:50,226
<i>Detroit was the key city
in Roosevelt's Arsenal of Democracy.</i>

211
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,103
<i>A great arsenal of democracy.</i>

212
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,141
<i>Many African-American
families migrated north...</i>

213
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,944
<i>...in search of work in
the armaments factories.</i>

214
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,945
<i>Racial tensions soon escalated.</i>

215
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,201
<i>One demonstrator jeered:</i>

216
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,488
<i>I'd rather see Hitler and Hirohito win...</i>

217
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,827
<i>...than work beside a Nigger
on the assembly line.</i>

218
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,242
<i>In June violence exploded...</i>

219
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:18,458
<i>...exacerbated by the city's
nearly all-white police force.</i>

220
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:23,172
<i>Federal troops arrived to restore order
with live ammunition.</i>

221
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:28,215
<i>Thirty four were killed in the riots,
25 of them black.</i>

222
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:34,141
<i>Wallace went to Detroit
to survey the damage. He was appalled.</i>

223
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:40,276
We cannot fight
to crush Nazi brutality abroad...

224
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:44,689
...and condone race riots at home.

225
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:48,155
<i>Years later this remark
would be echoed by civil rights leader...</i>

226
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:53,118
<i>...Martin Luther King
in reference to the Vietnam War.</i>

227
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:59,288
<i>By 1944, powerful labor leaders
Sidney Hillman and Scotsman Phil Murray...</i>

228
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,423
<i>...expressing complete confidence
in Wallace...</i>

229
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:07,759
<i>...had taken a dislike to the new men like
Byrnes taking power in Washington.</i>

230
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,844
<i>But the Anti-Wallace forces
told the president...</i>

231
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:14,978
<i>...that a Wallace re-nomination
as vice president would split the party.</i>

232
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:19,016
<i>The president would not answer
their ultimatum. He stalled for time.</i>

233
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:23,607
<i>Eleanor Roosevelt reminded him that Wallace had
been there with him since the beginning...</i>

234
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,817
<i>...a fellow visionary.</i>

235
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,156
<i>But the president's attitude
towards Wallace remained a puzzle.</i>

236
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:36,454
<i>He sent Wallace to evaluate
the war's forgotten front in China.</i>

237
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:41,998
<i>U.S. any Jiang Jieshi had been
fighting Japan since the early 1930s...</i>

238
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:46,634
<i>...and with his wife, the powerful
American-educated Madame Jiang...</i>

239
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,386
<i>...had strong ties to the US conservatives.</i>

240
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:54,176
<i>Wallace, however, saw the growing power
of Mao Tse-Tung's communist army...</i>

241
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:57,892
<i>...and was unsure of Jiang's future.</i>

242
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:03,481
<i>His final report was considered
too controversial and suppressed.</i>

243
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,815
<i>On his return, Wallace was summoned
immediately to meet the president.</i>

244
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,700
<i>The ticket would be
the subject of discussion.</i>

245
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,032
<i>It was the moment
Wallace had been dreading.</i>

246
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:17,620
His affection for me
seemed to be completely undimmed...

247
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:21,912
...because I can remember him
pulling me down...

248
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:26,879
...so his mouth was next to my ear
and saying:

249
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,758
"Henry, I hope it will
be the same old team."

250
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,178
<i>When the convention opened,
he was waiting for that support.</i>

251
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:43,437
<i>But increasingly iii, the president
staying in San Diego, only sent a note.</i>

252
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:50,574
Franklin Delano Roosevelt said,
"If I were a delegate to this convention...

253
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,575
<i>...I would vote for Henry A. Wallace."</i>

254
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,783
<i>Despite these words,
it was a cruel blow.</i>

255
00:19:56,946 --> 00:20:00,621
<i>The president was not willing
to fight for his vice president.</i>

256
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,953
<i>But Wallace remained the favorite.</i>

257
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,124
<i>Labor told the president that the strike-
breaking Jimmy Byrnes was not acceptable.</i>

258
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,461
<i>He was out.</i>

259
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:13,095
<i>Desperate, the bosses
led by Edwin Pauley, Robert Hannegan...</i>

260
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:18,385
...Ed <i>Flynn, Ed Kelly and others
needed an 11th-hour substitute.</i>

261
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,555
<i>And they settled on Missouri Senator
Harry Truman...</i>

262
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:26,693
<i>...a man of limited qualifications,
but one with few enemies.</i>

263
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:32,358
<i>A graduate of high school, he'd been
involved in three failed businesses.</i>

264
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,901
<i>He'd served honorably in World War I.</i>

265
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:41,245
<i>His most ambitious business venture,
a haberdashery, went belly up in 1922.</i>

266
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,784
<i>And in 1933, he wrote:</i>

267
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,623
<i>Tomorrow I'll be 49...</i>

268
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:48,881
<i>...but for all the good I have done,
the 40 might as well be left off.</i>

269
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,839
<i>A year later, Kansas City
political boss Tom Pendergast...</i>

270
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:56,552
<i>...after having been turned down
by his first four choices...</i>

271
00:20:56,714 --> 00:21:00,059
<i>...picked the 50-year-old Truman
to run for the senate.</i>

272
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,686
<i>When asked why, Pendergast replied:</i>

273
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,438
<i>I wanted to demonstrate...</i>

274
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:08,477
<i>...that a well-oiled machine could send
an office boy to the senate.</i>

275
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,315
<i>Shunned by most senators...</i>

276
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,197
<i>...who dismissed him
as the Senator from Pendergast...</i>

277
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:18,031
<i>...and failing to gain Roosevelt's
endorsement in his re-election bid...</i>

278
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:22,495
<i>...Truman worked hard to achieve
respectability in his second senate term.</i>

279
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,533
<i>But a Gallup poll on the opening day...</i>

280
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,876
<i>...showed 65 percent supporting Wallace
as vice president...</i>

281
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:34,090
<i>...Jimmy Byrnes had 3 percent of the vote,
and Truman came in eighth with 2 percent.</i>

282
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:39,382
<i>As Wallace arrived at the convention labor
leaders Hillman and Murray had delivered.</i>

283
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,721
<i>Wallace supporters were there
by the thousands.</i>

284
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,639
<i>Murray, in a thick Scottish accent,
shouted to his men:</i>

285
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,399
<i>"Wallace! That's it! Just keep pounding!"</i>

286
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:53,654
The future must bring equal wages
for equal work...

287
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,862
...regardless of sex or race.

288
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,995
<i>Wallace's speech
was interrupted constantly by applause.</i>

289
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,158
<i>A chant of, "We Want Wallace,"
filled the hall.</i>

290
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,919
We want Wallace! We want Wallace!
We want Wallace!

291
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,297
<i>Someone hijacked the loudspeakers...</i>

292
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,584
<i>...and played Wallace's campaign song
with its chorus:</i>

293
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,720
<i>"Iowa, Iowa,
that's where the tall corn grows."</i>

294
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:21,348
<i>Iowa...
That's where the tall corn grows...</i>

295
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:26,263
<i>Furious, Ed Pauley threatened
to cut the sound to the amplifiers.</i>

296
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:31,309
<i>A victorious vote was almost a foregone
conclusion, a Wallace victory was certain.</i>

297
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:36,572
<i>Florida Senator Pepper realized if he got
Wallace's name in nomination this night...</i>

298
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,482
<i>...Wallace would sweep the convention.</i>

299
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,448
<i>He fought his way through the crowd
to get to the microphone.</i>

300
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:46,662
<i>But the bosses were now demanding
that Session Chair Samuel Jackson adjourn.</i>

301
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:50,124
<i>This chaos was a fire hazard,
they screamed.</i>

302
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:53,790
<i>Not knowing what to do,
Jackson called the vote for adjournment.</i>

303
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:57,677
<i>A few said aye,
but the overwhelming majority boomed nay.</i>

304
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:03,387
<i>And yet, Jackson had the gall to announce
that the vote to adjourn had passed.</i>

305
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,428
<i>It was outrageous.
Confusion filled the hall.</i>

306
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:10,224
<i>Pepper had reached the first step
of the stage, only five feet...</i>

307
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,517
<i>...probably nine seconds
from the microphone...</i>

308
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:16,813
<i>...before the bosses forced adjournment
against the win of the delegates.</i>

309
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,778
<i>If he could have nominated Wallace
in those moments...</i>

310
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:25,788
<i>...there's no doubt Henry Wallace would've been
overwhelmingly returned as vice president.</i>

311
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:30,042
<i>"What I understood," Pepper wrote,
"was that for better or worse...</i>

312
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,704
<i>...history was turned topsy-turvy
that night in Chicago."</i>

313
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,215
<i>Samuel Jackson apologized to Pepper
the next day...</i>

314
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:40,094
<i>...and Pepper wrote in his autobiography
that Jackson said;</i>

315
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,254
<i>"I had strict instructions from Hannegan...</i>

316
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,925
<i>...not to let the convention nominate
the vice-president last night."</i>

317
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,595
<i>Hillman and Murray rallied the same troops
to return the next day...</i>

318
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,231
<i>...and see it through to victory.</i>

319
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:59,364
<i>But over that night, Edwin Pauley and the anti-
Wallace forces united behind Harry Truman.</i>

320
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,364
<i>Deals were cut. Positions offered.</i>

321
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:06,324
<i>Ambassadorships,
postmaster positions. Cash payoffs.</i>

322
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,535
<i>Bosses called every state chairman...</i>

323
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:12,702
<i>...telling them that Roosevelt wanted
the Missouri senator as his running mate.</i>

324
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:17,089
<i>Bob Hannegan managed to put up
16 favorite son nominees...</i>

325
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,716
<i>...to draw votes away from Wallace...</i>

326
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,719
<i>...and then channeled those votes
to Truman.</i>

327
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:29,227
<i>Even so, the next day when voting began,
things started to swing Wallace's way again.</i>

328
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:34,812
Iowa, the greatest agricultural state
in the union...

329
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:40,738
...gives to this convention and to the
Democratic Party its illustrious...

330
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:44,070
...distinguished son Henry A. Wallace...

331
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,533
...for this nomination of the vice
presidency of the United States.

332
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:54,168
We want Wallace!
We want Wallace! We want Wallace!

333
00:24:55,077 --> 00:25:01,005
<i>When the first ballot ended,
it was Wallace 429, to Truman's 319.</i>

334
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,839
<i>Then a second ballot got underway...</i>

335
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:07,348
<i>...and now the deals the bosses
had made kicked into action.</i>

336
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:11,010
<i>Jackson announced that the second
ballot would begin at once...</i>

337
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,100
<i>...therefore, no new convention tickets
would be honored.</i>

338
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:19,235
<i>Mayor Kelly's police barred thousands
more of Wallace's supporters from the hall.</i>

339
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:23,990
<i>But those inside began chanting as before,
attempting to drown out the proceedings.</i>

340
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:28,031
<i>Wallace started the second ballot
firmly in the lead...</i>

341
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,321
<i>...but gradually he lost
ground to Truman...</i>

342
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:35,584
<i>...as the nominees put up by Hannegan signed
over their votes to Truman, one by one.</i>

343
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:39,293
<i>Truman prevailed. It was over.</i>

344
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:51,179
I guess this is just another lost cause,
Mr. Paine.

345
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:58,482
All you people don't know
about lost causes.

346
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,734
Mr. Paine does.

347
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:06,984
He said once they were the only causes
worth fighting for.

348
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:12,827
And he fought for them once.
And I loved you for it.

349
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:16,834
And you know that you fight for the
lost causes harder than for any others.

350
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:21,168
Yes, you even die for them.
You think I'm licked.

351
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,422
You all think I'm licked.
Well, I'm not licked!

352
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,849
And I'm gonna stay right here
and fight for this lost cause!

353
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:35,887
Even if this room gets filled with lies
like these...

354
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:41,526
...and the Taylors and all their armies
come marching into this place...

355
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,903
...somebody will listen to me.

356
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,032
<i>Henry Wallace, accepting his defeat..</i>

357
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,419
<i>...pledged his loyalty
to the Roosevelt-Truman ticket...</i>

358
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:03,877
<i>...and agreed to remain in the cabinet.</i>

359
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:08,294
<i>Today, buried by the traditional tale
of the Second World War...</i>

360
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,512
<i>...the events of the 1944 Democratic
Convention have been largely forgotten.</i>

361
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:17,395
<i>They would however change
the course of history.</i>

362
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:20,227
<i>The man who might have been president...</i>

363
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:25,691
<i>...could now only watch from the sidelines
as events unfolded.</i>

364
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,736
<i>There were other deals going on
behind the scenes in this critical year.</i>

365
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,326
<i>Mistrusting Roosevelt's
optimism in Europe...</i>

366
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:42,086
<i>...Churchill flew to Moscow in October
1944, to meet alone with Stalin.</i>

367
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:48,794
<i>Based on the previous experience of U.S.
isolationism after the First World War...</i>

368
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,802
<i>...neither leader seriously believed...</i>

369
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:54,841
<i>...that American troops would
remain in Europe after the war.</i>

370
00:27:55,007 --> 00:28:01,390
<i>Therefore it was vital to Churchill that he shore
up the British position as strongly as possible.</i>

371
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,941
<i>On the back of a scrap of paper...</i>

372
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:08,946
<i>...Churchill proposed the share of influence
each nation would exert in postwar Europe.</i>

373
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,574
<i>The U.S.S.R. would get
90 percent in Romania...</i>

374
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,862
<i>...75 percent in Hungary and Bulgaria.</i>

375
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:21,956
<i>Yugoslavia would be split 50/50,
but Britain would get 90 percent in Greece.</i>

376
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:26,922
<i>Greece was vital to the British position
in the Mediterranean...</i>

377
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,209
<i>...close to Egypt
and the strategic Suez Canal...</i>

378
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,595
<i>...through which came the trade
which kept the empire alive.</i>

379
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:36,758
<i>From Eastern Africa
through the Middle East, the near east...</i>

380
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:40,929
<i>...and at the heart of this empire, India,
the crown jewel...</i>

381
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:46,142
<i>...and beyond it the far east,
where Singapore was now British again.</i>

382
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:52,774
<i>Although
Churchill wanted a non-communist Poland...</i>

383
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,786
<i>...the truth was that Poland was simply
off the agenda...</i>

384
00:28:56,944 --> 00:29:01,666
<i>...and Churchill was more concerned
with safeguarding British power.</i>

385
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:07,330
<i>Stalin took the paper and made a large check
with a blue pencil before handing it back.</i>

386
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,668
<i>Churchill remarked:</i>

387
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,379
<i>Might it not be thought rather cynical...</i>

388
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,636
<i>...if it seemed
we had disposed of these issues...</i>

389
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:18,675
<i>...so fateful to millions of people
in such an offhand manner?</i>

390
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,184
<i>Let us burn the paper.</i>

391
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:26,770
<i>But Stalin urged Churchill
to hold onto the historic scrap of paper...</i>

392
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:30,778
<i>...which Churchill called</i>
a <i>naughty document.</i>

393
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,063
<i>For the first time on record...</i>

394
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,530
<i>...Stalin came to the airport
to wish his guests Godspeed.</i>

395
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,361
<i>This was exactly the kind of secret deal...</i>

396
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,122
<i>...that Roosevelt had set out to prevent.</i>

397
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:47,333
<i>At a press conference in 1944, he'd said
of British Gambia in West Africa...</i>

398
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,872
<i>...which he had visited the previous year:</i>

399
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,542
<i>It's the most horrible thing
I've ever seen in my life.</i>

400
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,679
<i>The natives are 5000 years back of us.</i>

401
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:59,716
<i>The British have been there 200 years.</i>

402
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:05,388
<i>For every dollar that the British have
put into Gambia, they have taken out 10.</i>

403
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:06,976
<i>It's just plain exploitation.</i>

404
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:11,315
<i>Roosevelt spoke repeatedly
about a postwar trusteeship system...</i>

405
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,446
<i>...that would prepare the colonies
for independence.</i>

406
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,527
<i>One of these would be Indochina...</i>

407
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,194
<i>...which he insisted not be given
back to the French after the war...</i>

408
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:25,036
<i>...as Churchill and the French exiled
leader Charles De Gaulle demanded.</i>

409
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:29,795
<i>Roosevelt told Cordell Hun,
his secretary of state in 1944...</i>

410
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:35,801
<i>...that France has had the country 30
million inhabitants for nearly 100 years...</i>

411
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:39,463
<i>...and the people are worse off
than they were at the beginning.</i>

412
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:43,718
<i>Churchill told his number two,
Anthony Eden, in late '44:</i>

413
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,386
<i>There must be no question...</i>

414
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:49,557
<i>...our being hustled
or seduced into declarations...</i>

415
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:54,399
<i>...affecting British sovereignty
in any of the dominions or colonies.</i>

416
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:58,282
<i>Hands off the British
empire is our maxim...</i>

417
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:01,360
<i>...and it must not be
weakened or smirched...</i>

418
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:06,745
<i>...to ease sob-stuff merchants at home
or foreigners of any hue.</i>

419
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,297
<i>British soldiers have returned to Greece.</i>

420
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,931
<i>And historic Athens, capital of ancient
freedom, eagerly awaits liberation.</i>

421
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,974
<i>Churchill sent British
troops into Athens...</i>

422
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,440
<i>...to repress the left-wing
and communist partisans...</i>

423
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,981
<i>...who had led the underground resistance
to the Nazis...</i>

424
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,865
<i>...and were now battling for power...</i>

425
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:45,200
<i>...against reactionary forces
who wanted to restore the king.</i>

426
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:49,742
<i>But the Greek people did not want
to exchange the Nazis for the old monarch.</i>

427
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:53,170
<i>Street fighting raged
through the Greek capital.</i>

428
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:57,128
<i>Churchill ordered his men
to treat Athens as a conquered city.</i>

429
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,253
<i>The British General Scobie
called in dive bombers.</i>

430
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:06,802
<i>Stalin however, refused to back the partisans,
delivering on his bargain to Churchill.</i>

431
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,095
<i>Roosevelt is reported to have said:</i>

432
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:12,014
<i>How the British can dare such a thing!</i>

433
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:16,276
<i>The lengths they will go
to hang on to the past.</i>

434
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,193
<i>With the dawn of victory in Europe...</i>

435
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:25,282
<i>...Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill met
for the second and last time at Yalta...</i>

436
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,288
<i>...on the Back Sea in early February.</i>

437
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:34,541
<i>The Soviet Union was preoccupied
with its security.</i>

438
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:37,752
<i>Britain was preserving its empire.</i>

439
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:42,086
<i>The U.S. wanted Soviet assistance
in ending the Pacific War...</i>

440
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:47,133
<i>...and support for a world economy
open to US trade and investment...</i>

441
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:52,305
<i>...and for establishing a United Nations
to preserve the new peace.</i>

442
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:56,351
<i>Roosevelt's doctors had begged him
not to go to Yalta.</i>

443
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:01,064
<i>The president was weakening daily,
but his vast spirit kept him going.</i>

444
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:07,828
<i>It's been a global war, and we've
already started making it a global peace.</i>

445
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,744
<i>There was little time to waste.</i>

446
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,414
<i>And though they didn't see eye to eye
on Germany, the big three agreed...</i>

447
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:24,508
<i>...to a complete disarmament, demilitarization
and dismemberment of Germany.</i>

448
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:30,221
<i>They would divide the conquered nation
into four military zones...</i>

449
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,306
<i>...with one controlled by France.</i>

450
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:35,814
<i>The U.S. still had one
major card to play...</i>

451
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:41,979
<i>...postwar economic assistance to help
the Soviets rebuild their shattered nation.</i>

452
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:49,157
<i>A reparations commission was established based
on an estimated figure of $20 billion...</i>

453
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,993
<i>...with half going to the Soviet Union.</i>

454
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,453
<i>This was the carrot.</i>

455
00:33:56,117 --> 00:34:00,247
<i>Poland was the focus
of seven of Yalta's eight sessions.</i>

456
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,461
<i>Ultimately the three leaders compromised...</i>

457
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:06,128
<i>...on a Polish provisional government
of national unity...</i>

458
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,921
<i>...which was admittedly vague...</i>

459
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:12,594
<i>...intended to include democratic leaders
from outside Poland.</i>

460
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:18,266
<i>Naval Chief of Staff William Leahy, a veteran
of the Spanish-American and first world wars...</i>

461
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,603
<i>...warned Roosevelt:</i>

462
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:25,773
<i>This is so elastic that the Russians can stretch
it all the way from Yalta to Washington...</i>

463
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:27,566
<i>...without technically breaking it.</i>

464
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,736
<i>- Roosevelt agreed.
- I know, Bill. I know it.</i>

465
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,076
<i>But it's the best I can do for Poland
at this time.</i>

466
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,664
<i>In truth, the United States
and Britain had lost their leverage...</i>

467
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:42,582
<i>...by failing to open up the second front
until very late in the war.</i>

468
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:48,800
<i>So at the end of the day, F.D.R. didn't give
anything at Yalta that Stalin didn't already have.</i>

469
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:55,345
<i>On the other hand, Stalin was in no rush to
institute revolutionary change, if at all.</i>

470
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,059
<i>As in Greece,
he recognized that the communists...</i>

471
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:03,602
<i>...although they'd often played a leading
role in anti-Nazi resistance movements...</i>

472
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:08,490
<i>...represented a minority element
in most of these liberated nations.</i>

473
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:13,620
<i>Never having shared Trotsky's zeal
for international communism...</i>

474
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:19,205
<i>...he had once remarked that communism
fit Poland like a saddle fit a cow.</i>

475
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,712
<i>It was these conflicts,
primarily over Poland...</i>

476
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:26,341
<i>...that would eventually tear
the alliance apart.</i>

477
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,302
<i>But most importantly to Roosevelt...</i>

478
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:33,967
<i>...Stalin definitely committed the U.S.S.R.
to join the war against Japan...</i>

479
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,887
<i>...three months after the close
of the European war.</i>

480
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:41,853
<i>There were still close to 2 million
Japanese soldiers in China.</i>

481
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:46,896
<i>And without Soviet aid,
the war could drag on indefinitely.</i>

482
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:51,738
<i>In return Roosevelt and Churchill promised
territorial and economic inducements...</i>

483
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:58,374
<i>...that would essentially restore what the
Russians had lost to Japan in their 1904-5 war.</i>

484
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:03,503
<i>Additionally, the big three reached
some agreements on the United Nations...</i>

485
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,882
<i>...which was set to convene
in April of '45...</i>

486
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,137
<i>...and a system of trusteeships to deal
with the liberated colonial territories.</i>

487
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,968
<i>Although there were many vagaries left...</i>

488
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:22,015
<i>...when it came to the British and French
empires in Indochina Africa and Asia.</i>

489
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:28,062
<i>News of Yalta ignited a kind of optimism
that hadn't been seen for decades.</i>

490
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:33,947
<i>Former President Herbert Hoover called the
conference a great hope to the world.</i>

491
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:39,832
<i>C.B.S. war correspondent William Shirer, who
later authored the renowned bestseller...</i>

492
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:44,916
<i>...The Rise and</i> Fall <i>of the</i> Third <i>Reich
declared it a landmark in human history.</i>

493
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:47,376
<i>Roosevelt returned in triumph.</i>

494
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:51,760
<i>Addressing Congress for the first time
without standing on his braces...</i>

495
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,922
<i>...he called for acceptance of the results.</i>

496
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:59,434
As the beginnings
of a permanent structure of peace...

497
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:04,644
...upon which we can begin to build,
under God...

498
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:09,357
...that better world in which our children
and grandchildren...

499
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,819
...yours and mine...

500
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:19,489
...the children and grandchildren
of the whole world, must live and can live.

501
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,999
<i>For Franklin Delano Roosevelt...</i>

502
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:27,789
<i>...it was an amazing conclusion
to an amazing life.</i>

503
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:31,584
<i>The Yalta Agreement
would forever be controversial...</i>

504
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:36,005
<i>...and Roosevelt would be unfairly attacked
for capitulating to Stalin.</i>

505
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:37,639
<i>And in the weeks to follow...</i>

506
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:42,018
<i>...disagreements with the Soviets surfaced
over Poland and other issues.</i>

507
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:47,399
<i>But Roosevelt never lost hope
and in his last cable to Churchill wrote:</i>

508
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:51,562
<i>I would minimize
the Soviet problem as much as possible...</i>

509
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:57,698
<i>...because these problems in one form
or another seem to arise every day...</i>

510
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:00,703
<i>...and most of them straighten out.</i>

511
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:06,210
<i>Roosevelt truly thought
he would live to enforce the peace.</i>

512
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:11,589
<i>But less than two months later
after 12 years in office...</i>

513
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:16,174
<i>...his great, great heart finally gave out
when he died of a massive stroke.</i>

514
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,890
<i>The longest-serving president
in American history...</i>

515
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,601
<i>...Roosevelt saw
the country through its hardest times...</i>

516
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,893
<i>...the Great Depression and Great War.</i>

517
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:36,232
<i>Without him, the postwar peace
that was achieved at Yalta...</i>

518
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,822
<i>...between the British and American empires
and Soviet communism...</i>

519
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,954
<i>...could not be maintained.</i>

520
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:50,295
<i>In-between these giants, America's new
president was a shadow of his predecessor...</i>

521
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,457
<i>...and he openly admitted it.</i>

522
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,468
<i>As the nation is plunged into mourning...</i>

523
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:01,552
<i>...Harry S. Truman becomes president,
the seventh American...</i>

524
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,307
<i>On his first day in office...</i>

525
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:08,518
<i>...a group of reporters asked
how the job was going and Truman replied:</i>

526
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,900
<i>Boys, if you ever pray, pray for me now.</i>

527
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:15,278
<i>I don't know whether you fellows
ever had a load of hay fall on you...</i>

528
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,781
<i>...but when they told me yesterday
what happened...</i>

529
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,990
<i>...I felt like the moon, the stars
and all the planets had fallen on me.</i>

530
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:26,952
<i>We got the most terribly responsible job
a man ever had.</i>

531
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:31,871
<i>- When a reporter yelled out,
"Good luck, Mr. -</i>

532
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,879
<i>I wish you didn't have to can me that.</i>

533
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,837
<i>This was not false humility
on Truman's part.</i>

534
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,131
<i>He'd only been vice president for 82 days
and only spoken to Roosevelt twice.</i>

535
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,140
<i>But neither Roosevelt or anyone else...</i>

536
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:48,270
<i>...had ever bothered to inform
the tightly-regarded vice president...</i>

537
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:52,228
<i>...that the United States was building
the most powerful weapon in history.</i>

538
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,651
<i>On April 15th, Truman and Wallace...</i>

539
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,909
<i>...who had remained in the cabinet
as Secretary of Commerce...</i>

540
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:07,117
<i>...met the funeral train
at Washington's Union Station.</i>

541
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,159
<i>There was another man with them,
Jimmy Byrnes...</i>

542
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:13,625
<i>...Truman's old mentor
from his senate days...</i>

543
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:17,962
<i>...who had befriended the Missourian
at a time when most senators avoided him...</i>

544
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,673
<i>...as a Pendergast political hack.</i>

545
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:25,716
<i>Impressed with the fact that Byrnes
had accompanied Roosevelt to Yalta...</i>

546
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:29,182
<i>...although he found out later
that he'd left the conference early...</i>

547
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:32,223
<i>...and was not in
on the important discussions...</i>

548
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:37,360
<i>Truman came to rely on Byrnes
above all others for advice.</i>

549
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:41,189
<i>Byrnes gave Truman his first real briefing
about the atomic bomb...</i>

550
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:45,202
<i>...which he described as an explosive
great enough to destroy the whole world...</i>

551
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:51,413
<i>...that might well put us in a position to
dictate our own terms at the end of the war.</i>

552
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:58,086
<i>He did not specify exactly to whom
the U.S. would be dictating those terms.</i>

553
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:10,894
With great humility,
I call upon all Americans...

554
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:14,773
...to help me keep our nation united...

555
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,567
...in defense of those ideals...

556
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:22,526
...which have been so eloquently proclaimed
by Franklin Roosevelt.

557
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:25,909
<i>This turns out to be a crucial moment
in the history of the world...</i>

558
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:30,743
<i>...and much of it has been forgotten,
but it is well worth revisiting.</i>

559
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:34,250
<i>The first to see Truman after Roosevelt's
death on April 13th...</i>

560
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:37,663
<i>...was Secretary of State
Edward Stettinius.</i>

561
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:44,383
<i>The former U.S. Steel Chairman of the Board
had had very little influence with Roosevelt.</i>

562
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:48,674
<i>But for Truman, Stettinius painted a
picture of Soviet deception and perfidy...</i>

563
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,393
<i>...saying that Britain's Churchill
felt even more strongly.</i>

564
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:56,352
<i>And Churchill wasted little time
confirming that view both in cables...</i>

565
00:41:56,514 --> 00:42:01,987
<i>...and in a hurried visit to Washington
from his Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden.</i>

566
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:07,026
<i>The British ambassador to the U.S.,
Lord Halifax, sized Truman up...</i>

567
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:11,412
<i>...saying the new president was an honest
and diligent mediocrity.</i>

568
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:13,790
<i>A bungling, if welt-meaning amateur...</i>

569
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:18,954
<i>...surrounded by Missouri county courthouse
caliber friends.</i>

570
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,464
<i>That afternoon Truman met
with Jimmy Byrnes.</i>

571
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,340
<i>Admitting his abject ignorance...</i>

572
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:27,879
<i>...he implored Byrnes to tell him about
everything from Teheran to Yalta...</i>

573
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:32,051
<i>...and everything else under the sun.
Byrnes gladly accommodated.</i>

574
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:36,813
<i>In a series of meetings,
Byrnes reinforced Stettinius's message...</i>

575
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,724
<i>...that the Soviets were breaking
their Yalta agreements...</i>

576
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:43,691
<i>...and implored Truman to be, above all,
uncompromising with them.</i>

577
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:48,074
<i>Truman made clear his intention
to make Byrnes Secretary of State...</i>

578
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:52,703
<i>...as soon as Stettinius had gotten
the United Nations off the ground.</i>

579
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:56,867
<i>In this atmosphere ambassador
to the Soviet Union Averell Harriman...</i>

580
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,831
<i>...having rushed back from Moscow...</i>

581
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:03,214
<i>...warned that the U.S. was facing
a barbarian invasion of Europe...</i>

582
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:08,378
<i>...and urged Truman to stand firm and tell
Foreign Minister Molotov in Washington...</i>

583
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:13,015
<i>...that we would not stand for any
pushing around on the Polish question.</i>

584
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:16,474
<i>As soon as the Russians had control
over a country, Harriman said...</i>

585
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:19,606
<i>...the secret police moved in
and wiped out free speech.</i>

586
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:24,110
<i>But he clarified that the Soviets
would not risk a break with the U.S...</i>

587
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,989
<i>...because they desperately sought
the postwar reconstruction aid...</i>

588
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,115
<i>...that Roosevelt had promised them.</i>

589
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:35,997
<i>Truman masked his limited understanding
of the issues with bluster and bravado...</i>

590
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:40,410
<i>...telling Harriman he didn't expect to get 100
percent of what he wanted from the Russians...</i>

591
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:43,796
<i>...but he did expect to get 85 percent.</i>

592
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:49,132
<i>It is important to note that many of the most
vociferous critics of the Soviet Union...</i>

593
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:55,426
<i>...shared a similar class background and a deep
hatred for anything that smacked of socialism.</i>

594
00:43:55,591 --> 00:44:01,189
<i>Harriman was the son of a rail road tycoon
who had founded Brown Brothers, Harriman.</i>

595
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:05,352
<i>James Forrestal had made a fortune
on Wall Street.</i>

596
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:09,864
<i>Stettinius had been chairman of the board
of the nation's largest corporation.</i>

597
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:13,117
<i>They were joined by enormously wealthy
international bankers...</i>

598
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:15,153
<i>...Wall Street and Washington lawyers...</i>

599
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,868
<i>...and corporate executives
who had mostly inherited...</i>

600
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:22,285
<i>...or made their fortunes
during the interwar years.</i>

601
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:27,048
<i>These men would come
to shape postwar U.S. policy...</i>

602
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:32,758
<i>...and included Dean Acheson, Robert Lovett,
John McCloy, John Foster and Allen Dulles.</i>

603
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,802
<i>Nelson Rockefeller, Paul Nitze, and General
Motors President Charles Wilson...</i>

604
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:41,938
<i>...who as head of the war production board
had said...</i>

605
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:45,646
<i>...that the United States
needed a Permanent war economy.</i>

606
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:51,281
<i>Although they had sewed Roosevelt,
they had in fact little influence on him.</i>

607
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:56,661
<i>Opposed to this antagonistic point of view
towards the Soviets were the veterans.</i>

608
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:01,916
<i>Secretary of War Henry Stimson, Army Chief
of Staff General George Marshall...</i>

609
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,418
<i>...and Former Vice President
Henry Wallace.</i>

610
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:09,299
<i>Admiral William Leahy again noted the
elasticity of the Yalta agreement...</i>

611
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:13,594
<i>...and the difficulty of alleging bad faith
on that basis.</i>

612
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:16,723
<i>In fact he said, after Yalta
he would have been surprised...</i>

613
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:19,976
<i>...had the Soviets behaved
differently than they had.</i>

614
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:25,482
<i>Marshall, who Time Magazine
had named Man of The Year for 1943...</i>

615
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,315
<i>...contended that a break with the Soviets
would be disastrous...</i>

616
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:32,697
<i>...given U.S. dependence on them
to help defeat the Japanese.</i>

617
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,199
<i>The Conservative Secretary of War
Henry Stimson...</i>

618
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:39,204
<i>...who had fought the Ute Indians
in the 19th century...</i>

619
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:43,458
<i>...and still liked to be called The Colonel
was long practiced in the ways of the world.</i>

620
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,916
<i>When confronted by the issues
of acquisition by force...</i>

621
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:51,003
<i>...he explained that the U.S.S.R.
had been a trustworthy ally...</i>

622
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:56,513
<i>...often delivering even more than had been
promised, especially in military matters.</i>

623
00:45:56,671 --> 00:46:01,472
<i>He reminded the president of Poland's
importance to Russia, and said:</i>

624
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:03,932
<i>The Russians
are probably being more realistic...</i>

625
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,814
<i>...about their own security than we are.</i>

626
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:09,021
<i>He had previously noted that Russia:</i>

627
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,562
<i>Prior to 1914 had owned
the whole of Poland...</i>

628
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,072
<i>...including Warsaw, as far as Germany...</i>

629
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:18,701
<i>...and that she was not asking
for restitution of that.</i>

630
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,362
<i>He added that,
outside the U.S. and Britain...</i>

631
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:26,535
<i>...very few countries shared the western
understanding of free elections.</i>

632
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:33,921
<i>Nonetheless in his first meeting with Soviet
Foreign Minister Molotov on April the 23rd...</i>

633
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:36,962
<i>...11 days after Roosevelt's death...</i>

634
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:41,850
<i>Truman wasted little time accusing the Soviets
of having broken their Yalta Agreement...</i>

635
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:43,510
<i>...particularly in Poland.</i>

636
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:48,727
<i>When Molotov tried to explain the Yalta-Polish
agreement through Stalin's eyes...</i>

637
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:52,063
<i>Truman dismissed his clarifications.</i>

638
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,696
<i>When Molotov raised other issues,
Truman snapped:</i>

639
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,732
<i>That will be all, Mr. Molotov.</i>

640
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:01,744
<i>I would appreciate it if you would
transmit my views to Marshal Stalin.</i>

641
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,781
<i>I've never been talked
to like that in my life.</i>

642
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:08,577
<i>Carry out your agreements
and you won't get talked to like that.</i>

643
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:12,873
<i>Molotov stormed out of the room.
After the meeting, Truman boasted:</i>

644
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:15,918
<i>I gave it to him straight.
I let him have it.</i>

645
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,586
<i>It was a straight one-two to the jaw.</i>

646
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:21,097
<i>His bullying of the Soviet
Foreign Minister...</i>

647
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,053
<i>...probably conjured up images...</i>

648
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,936
<i>...of 5'4" John "Peanuts" Truman...</i>

649
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,973
<i>...the 5'8" President's father...</i>

650
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:36,067
<i>...who, back in Missouri, would pick fights with
men a foot taller to show how tough he was.</i>

651
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:41,610
<i>He wanted that same toughness in his sons and
found it in Harry's younger brother Vivian.</i>

652
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:44,779
<i>Harry however, was diagnosed
with flat eyeballs...</i>

653
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:48,791
<i>...and forced to wear
coke-bottle-thick glasses.</i>

654
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,998
<i>He could not play sports
and he was bullied by the other boys...</i>

655
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:57,759
<i>...who called him Four-Eyes and sissy
and chased him home after school.</i>

656
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:02,138
<i>When he arrived home trembling, his mother would
comfort him by telling him not to worry...</i>

657
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,594
<i>...because he was meant
to be a girl anyway.</i>

658
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:06,976
<i>Gender issues plagued him for years.</i>

659
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:11,059
<i>He would often refer
to his feminine features and attributes.</i>

660
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,816
<i>Economic hardship added to his woes.</i>

661
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,851
<i>No sissy anymore, he now proved...</i>

662
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:20,489
<i>...he could stand up to leaders of the
second most powerful nation in the world.</i>

663
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:25,495
<i>His father, whose approval he struggled
unsuccessfully to win when he was alive...</i>

664
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,122
<i>...would have been proud of him now.</i>

665
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,577
<i>Stalin, feeling betrayed...</i>

666
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:35,338
<i>...wasted no time cabling Truman the following
day, insisting that Roosevelt had agreed...</i>

667
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:40,002
<i>...that the pro-Soviet Polish government
would form the kernel of the new government.</i>

668
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:45,094
<i>He added he didn't know if the governments of
Belgium or Greece were really democratic...</i>

669
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:50,183
<i>...but he wouldn't make a stink because
they were vital to British interests.</i>

670
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:52,514
<i>These were strong words.</i>

671
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:58,358
<i>And where the opening of the United Nations in San
Francisco two days later on April the 25th...</i>

672
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:02,524
<i>...should have been an occasion to celebrate
a new era in International peace...</i>

673
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:06,911
<i>...it was instead ruined by tension
between the allies.</i>

674
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:11,870
<i>The Russian request to have the pro-Soviet
government seated to represent Poland...</i>

675
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,375
<i>...was rejected.</i>

676
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:18,628
<i>After that
relations continued to deteriorate rapidly.</i>

677
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:24,300
<i>Realizing that his get-tough tactics
had not produced the desired results...</i>

678
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:29,389
<i>...Truman met twice with Joseph Davies,
the former ambassador to the Soviet Union.</i>

679
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:33,308
<i>A conservative corporate attorney,
he'd surprised liberal critics...</i>

680
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:36,691
...by <i>sympathizing
with the Soviet experiment.</i>

681
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:40,854
<i>Davies counseled Truman that the
Soviets had always been sticklers...</i>

682
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:44,240
<i>...for reciprocity between allies.</i>

683
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:48,778
<i>So they accepted British-imposed
governments in Africa, Italy and Greece...</i>

684
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:53,575
<i>...even though they did not represent the
anti-fascist forces in those countries...</i>

685
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:58,588
<i>...because they understood these were
vital interests to America and Britain.</i>

686
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:05,174
<i>And they expected similar consideration for
their vital security interests in Poland.</i>

687
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:08,465
<i>Davies noted how fundamentally
the relationship had changed...</i>

688
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:12,602
<i>...in the last six weeks,
with the British acting as instigators...</i>

689
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,981
<i>...and warned that if the Russians decide the
US and Britain are ganging up on them...</i>

690
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:20,018
<i>...they'll respond by
out-toughing the west...</i>

691
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:23,859
<i>...as they did in concluding
the 1939 Pact with Hitler...</i>

692
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:28,197
<i>...when it became clear that the west
would not help them stop the Nazis.</i>

693
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:33,035
<i>But he assured Truman that when approached
with generosity and friendliness...</i>

694
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:36,667
<i>...the Soviets respond
with even greater generosity.</i>

695
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:40,125
<i>Davies agreed to set up a meeting
between Truman and Stalin.</i>

696
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:44,668
<i>In that same crucial month,
a few days after Roosevelt's death...</i>

697
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:49,213
<i>...the Soviets had amassed three armies
of 2.5 million men to take Berlin...</i>

698
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:54,557
<i>...and end forever
Hitler's 1000-year Reich.</i>

699
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:03,315
<i>But incredibly, the Germans
were still able, with all their losses...</i>

700
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:08,904
<i>...to muster an enormous defense of 1 million
men with fortified bunkers, air, artillery.</i>

701
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:15,199
<i>Their most fanatical recruits in this
terrible Gotterdammerung, child soldiers.</i>

702
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:23,256
<i>It was the Third Reich's last stand.
The battle was bloody.</i>

703
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:26,258
<i>Eighty thousand Russian
troops were killed...</i>

704
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,970
<i>...at least 300,000 casualties,
fighting street to street.</i>

705
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:32,382
<i>Berlin fell in four days.</i>

706
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:39,147
<i>Hitler and his long-term mistress Eva Braun
married and the next day committed suicide.</i>

707
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:43,026
<i>Seeking revenge for the German rape
of the U.S.S.R...</i>

708
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,811
<i>...and further fueled
by what they had witnessed...</i>

709
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:52,361
<i>...liberating the concentration camps of
Majdanek, Sobibor, Treblinka and Auschwitz...</i>

710
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:57,703
<i>...en route to Berlin, the Soviet soldiers
behaved brutally towards the vanquished Germans.</i>

711
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,670
<i>Stalin did nothing to stop it.</i>

712
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:08,756
<i>But when reports began to fill the world's
airwaves of vast hordes of Soviet soldiers...</i>

713
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,544
<i>...raping their way through Germany...</i>

714
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:14,887
<i>...orders came from above to stop
and the rapes stopped.</i>

715
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:19,976
<i>The stories continued up to
2 million women, some claimed, were raped.</i>

716
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:25,689
<i>In just a few weeks over 100,000
did seek medical care for rape.</i>

717
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:32,066
<i>As part of the intended Roosevelt-Stalin
plan for the pastoralization of Germany...</i>

718
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:35,236
<i>...Soviet officials in
the first few months...</i>

719
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:39,407
<i>...shipped 100,000 rail cars
of construction materials...</i>

720
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,746
<i>...and personal goods back to Russia.</i>

721
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:45,083
<i>Some to help rebuild
the shattered economy...</i>

722
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:50,672
<i>...and some like furs, paintings, gold
and jewels for purely monetary purposes.</i>

723
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:55,431
<i>But as a result, the worldwide perception
of the Soviet Union endured...</i>

724
00:52:55,589 --> 00:53:00,265
<i>...that it was a barbaric and brutal
semi-Asian nation...</i>

725
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:03,772
<i>...invading what had once been
civilized Europe.</i>

726
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:08,653
<i>The dictionary definition of empathy
is the imaginative projection...</i>

727
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:14,033
<i>...or capacity for participating
in another's feelings or ideas.</i>

728
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:18,742
<i>But Truman did not seem capable
of comprehending the pain and suffering...</i>

729
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:23,125
<i>...of the Soviet people or their motives.</i>

730
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:27,584
<i>Roosevelt, a man who had suffered
from polio in his life...</i>

731
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:31,626
<i>...had understood that the war had been won
by Soviet sacrifice...</i>

732
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:34,796
<i>...and that peace now
depended on mutual respect.</i>

733
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:41,977
<i>Even Churchill had admitted
the Soviet army tore the guts...</i>

734
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:45,185
<i>...out of the German military machine.</i>

735
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:49,978
<i>Stalin was a tyrant, absolutely,
a ruthless paranoid dictator...</i>

736
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:54,240
<i>...who disdained
the U.S. concept of democracy.</i>

737
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:58,244
<i>But he was also in the tradition
of the cruelest tsars.</i>

738
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:00,496
<i>He had clearly gotten
along with Roosevelt...</i>

739
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:04,158
<i>...and had, according to
several high-level witnesses...</i>

740
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,497
<i>...kept his word to Roosevelt.</i>

741
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:10,506
<i>He desperately wanted friendly relations
with the U.S. to continue.</i>

742
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,167
<i>But as the cold war descended...</i>

743
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:18,510
<i>...the laurels of the U.S.S.R.'s victory
over Nazi Germany were stolen...</i>

744
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,391
<i>...or rather, forgotten.</i>

745
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:26,351
<i>It would take another 20 years
for another U.S. president and veteran...</i>

746
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:31,815
<i>...John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who had lived
his entire life in some degree of pain...</i>

747
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,695
<i>...and with the prospect of death...</i>

748
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:37,984
<i>...to pay homage
to the Soviet contribution in World War II.</i>

749
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:42,200
No nation in the history of battle...

750
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:46,868
...ever suffered more than the Soviet Union
in the Second World War.

751
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:50,038
<i>At least 20 million lost their lives.</i>

752
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:55,301
<i>Countless millions of homes
and families were burned or sacked.</i>

753
00:54:55,459 --> 00:55:00,556
<i>A third of the nation's territory including
two-thirds of its industrial base...</i>

754
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,933
<i>...was turned into a wasteland.</i>

755
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:08,143
<i>A loss equivalent to the destruction
of this country East of Chicago.</i>

756
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:23,074
<i>Germany officially surrendered May 7th.</i>

757
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,000
<i>The war in Europe has ended.</i>

758
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:36,713
<i>Unconditionally and finally our German
enemy has surrendered to Russia...</i>

759
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:40,049
<i>...to Britain and her commonwealth,
to America...</i>

760
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:44,683
<i>...to the millions who fought with their hearts
and souls, to the people of all free nations.</i>

761
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:50,932
<i>As V-E Day was celebrated
around the world...</i>

762
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:55,527
<i>...it also meant
that the Soviets as agreed at Yalta...</i>

763
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,405
<i>...would enter the Pacific War
around August 8th...</i>

764
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:02,159
<i>...almost three months
before the November 1 start date...</i>

765
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:06,697
<i>...for the planned allied invasion
of Mainland Japan.</i>

766
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:10,497
<i>When Truman and Byrnes,
now appointed Secretary of State...</i>

767
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:14,505
<i>...met with Stalin and Churchill in the most
important conference of World War II...</i>

768
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:18,133
<i>...at Potsdam in a suburb of Berlin...</i>

769
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:23,389
<i>...they were waiting for news of the secret
atomic tests in the desert of Alamogordo.</i>

770
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:31,142
<i>Truman had pushed the start
of the summit back two weeks to mid-July...</i>

771
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:35,811
<i>...and hoped the bomb would be tested
before negotiations with Stalin began.</i>

772
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:39,151
<i>In the desert Robert Oppenheimer said:</i>

773
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:44,610
<i>"We were under incredible pressure
to get it done before the Potsdam meeting.</i>

774
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:49,657
<i>It turned out, from Truman's perspective,
to be worth the wait."</i>

775
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:53,669
<i>On July 16th while Truman was
touring bombed-out Berlin...</i>

776
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:57,798
<i>...and preparing for the next day's meeting
with Stalin...</i>

777
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,709
<i>...scientists exploded
the first atomic bomb.</i>

778
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:09,511
<i>It exceeded all expectations.</i>

779
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:15,149
<i>Some scientists even feared
they had indeed set the atmosphere on fire.</i>

780
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:18,356
<i>Groves cabled the preliminary results
to Stimson...</i>

781
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:21,362
<i>...who rushed to brief Truman and Byrnes.</i>

782
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:25,321
<i>They were elated. They knew that
they had a date with destiny.</i>
