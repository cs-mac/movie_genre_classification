1
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,390
<i>IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT SOUND</i>

2
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,590
<i>KONZERTHAUS, VIENNA</i>

3
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,790
We are looking for the heavy bench.

4
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,270
The soundless one ...
-Now?

5
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,430
Now.
Lang Lang is rehearsing in Schubert Hall.

6
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,720
That's so stupid,
you never know where they are.

7
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,750
Could we look in there maybe?

8
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,390
Not here either ...

9
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,750
This can't be.
Normally, in the large hall ...

10
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,430
Mozart Hall.

11
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,630
That's a possibility.
But I don't think so.

12
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,190
Yes! I can't believe it!

13
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,550
I would never have looked there.

14
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,870
Let's do it together.
-Oh, it's all right.

15
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,600
This is the Ferrari
of the Konzerthaus.

16
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,390
This one in the last room!
That's strange.

17
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,350
We always have them in the passageway.

18
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,310
Up here?
-Yes, in the large hall, in the Mozart Hall.

19
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,350
Well then, thank you.
-You're welcome.

20
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,190
The other one too.
Thank you.

21
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,260
I urgently need the 245
on the empty stage in Mozart Hall.

22
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,510
The pianist wants to play.
Can you please do it?

23
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,670
Thanks, goodbye.

24
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,110
A classic mistake.

25
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,510
They thought it's only for tuning
and left the piano down in the hall.

26
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,460
All grand pianos
bear a production number.

27
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,030
I suggested the 245 to Pierre-Laurent Aimard
for the Bach recordings.

28
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,470
They only will take place in one year but we want
to start to prepare them now.

29
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,910
Because Pierre-Laurent demands very diverse
sounds for each piece from the same instrument.

30
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,470
We've never done that before.

31
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,190
ONE YEAR PRIOR TO THE
BACH RECORDINGS

32
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,510
Yes, very interesting.

33
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,030
The action is very pleasant.
Totally controllable and very easy.

34
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,590
That'll be perfect
for the harpsichord-like pieces.

35
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,430
For the organ-like or choral-like ...

36
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,910
one needs a kind of ...

37
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,310
"deeper expression."

38
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,470
Then I would need an ...

39
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,310
echo.
Because it's really like a clavichord.

40
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,830
We have to define that.

41
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,470
Should the sound do this
or should the sound do this?

42
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,590
Should the tone be ...

43
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,100
like this?

44
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,910
I would like to have both.

45
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,670
Fine, I need an open tone like that anyway.

46
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,550
But in this context?

47
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,710
But in this context ...

48
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,670
more intimate.
-A bit more intimate.

49
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,750
It has a very light ...
-Yes.

50
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,220
Exactly!

51
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,510
The others are clean in comparison.
The G for example, totally ...

52
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,270
Yes, exactly. That's good.

53
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,910
It has to be prepared with much care.

54
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,150
If we were, for example,
to take two hours ...

55
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,230
in April,
in which I would bring all the pieces ...

56
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,750
and play a little from each.

57
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,630
So as to hear the tone ...
-A dress rehearsal.

58
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,630
But we need two, three hours for that.
-For sure.

59
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,470
What do we call that?
So that we understand each other.

60
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,310
"Vibrato", or something like that?

61
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,350
We'll call it the "clavichord-situation."

62
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,150
The first was a pure "harpsichord-situation."

63
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,190
That was the very first that we heard?
-These are the four large families:

64
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,670
We have an "organ-situation" ...

65
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,990
and then the "chamber-situation" ...

66
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,310
and an "ensemble-situation"
at the beginning, probably.

67
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:59,500
It's quite possible that we have
to record something by Carter.

68
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,990
In April?

69
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,760
In September.
-September? Okay.

70
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,910
A toccata, that's the piece he surprisingly
composed for me, you know?

71
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,510
And ...

72
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,190
that would be recorded
at the same time.

73
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,710
I am going to abduct you today.

74
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,190
To the workshop.

75
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,430
We are going to try it out
on our instruments,

76
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,630
the ones being repaired.

77
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,510
We have the same problems.
New strings have to be freed.

78
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,710
We're going to try our repaired sounding boards
with these chips.

79
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,870
With these wooden strips
that you saw over there.

80
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,100
It's not balanced yet. And we're trying
to make it work with these instruments.

81
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,310
If you want more pressure,
you can put it a little further down.

82
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,020
But you are already hearing
what happened.

83
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,790
Exciting, isn't it?

84
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,110
Or crazy?

85
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,310
I had a really terrible dream.

86
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,380
I dreamt that a string tore
exactly in the area where I am now.

87
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,030
I am only saying this ...

88
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,310
in case it happens right now.

89
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,590
He closes his eyes, plays
and is unapproachable.

90
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,500
When you say we have to start admitting people,
he keeps playing.

91
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,550
You can't just carry him out.

92
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,510
<i>FRANZ LISTZ, HUNGARIAN RHAPSODY No, 6</i>

93
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,740
<i>HOFBURG, VIENNA</i>

94
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,070
Aimard, who's recording
"The Art of the Fugue",

95
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,190
wants to have various tones ...

96
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,710
with the idea, the flavour
of other instruments.

97
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,350
They shouldn't sound like them,
but they should ...

98
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,150
impart to the listener the intent
of what Bach may have thought.

99
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,860
He also said organ and chamber music.
I said I can relate to that.

100
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,740
But what is difficult for me
are clavichord and harpsichord.

101
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,070
I'm too inexperienced for that.

102
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,560
The clavichord
has a consistent overtone construction.

103
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,310
I claim or believe that this
consistent overtone construction ...

104
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,230
is what goes directly
into the soul via the ear.

105
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,150
This spinet was made exactly
400 years ago, in 1608.

106
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,700
Alone the fact that a 400 year old
instrument still plays so directly ...

107
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,030
and with a certain power ...

108
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,430
doesn't leave me totally cold.

109
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,140
The modern concert piano
is a fascinating music machine.

110
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,790
There is no alternative
for a large hall with 4000 people.

111
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,070
But volume is always combined
with a loss of colour.

112
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,580
We totally agree on this point.

113
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,150
A machine that is so aggressive ...

114
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,870
that I can't even draw the string
that makes it sing ...

115
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,460
without bloodying myself ...

116
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,950
a thing that requires
three people to be transported.

117
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,830
It has developed a certain
inhuman dimension for me.

118
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,230
But it is almost dependency, isn't it?

119
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,630
Pianists depend on really good instruments.

120
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,950
I think so.

121
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,700
Some pianists aren't that concerned
with the instrument ...

122
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,150
which I find very strange.

123
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,630
Sure. It's like a singer's voice.

124
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,310
It is our instrument.

125
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,750
One also has to be very critical as a pianist ...

126
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,790
and seek contact with good technicians.

127
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,110
And constantly work on it.

128
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,000
You can't tune it one time and voice it,
you have to work on it continuously.

129
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,310
I had to explain what we are looking for.

130
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,750
Luckily, Mr. Fellner agreed ...

131
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,590
to help me a little
and to give me some security.

132
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,510
You still don't exactly know what
we are searching for. We are selecting ...

133
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,070
a D grand piano, a concert grand,

134
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,260
for the Konzerthaus.

135
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,670
Sufficient for the large hall,

136
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,190
but for people who like a powerful instrument
that can also be played in the Mozart Hall.

137
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,030
It has to be very sonorous and,
most of all, it must have colours.

138
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,910
This one here and that fourth one.

139
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,270
I had these two grands
on the short list.

140
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,020
I didn't choose any of those.

141
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,390
I left open the fifth,
but I selected the first one ...

142
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,030
precisely because
in its present condition it seems powerful.

143
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,830
I have the feeling that something,
some substance, is already there.

144
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,830
Although it seems to be somewhat
superficially brilliant now.

145
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,870
A great deal would have to be done.

146
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,830
The resonance is there,
but the sound is still not round.

147
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,670
It is still thin.

148
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,920
It's more beautiful here.
-For sure.

149
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,110
The other grand,
which has an unbelievable amount of ...

150
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,670
I wouldn't say it is wiry,
but, well, force ...

151
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,830
it is slimmer than this grand.
Of that I am sure.

152
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,550
And I would also like to have ...

153
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,750
an alternative for a soloist
in the large hall.

154
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,710
It was hard, but in the end
we chose the 780.

155
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:16,150
I am relieved, because our 109
will probably be sent to Australia,

156
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,910
and I want the new grand
as an alternative for the Bach recordings.

157
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,230
The pressure is intense. One always
wants to make recordings for posterity.

158
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,030
At least artists like
Pierre-Laurent Aimard.

159
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,390
He generally receives some kind
of award for his recordings.

160
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,710
So, it could be that he says,
wonderful and great ...

161
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,030
but it could also be that he says:

162
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,390
"Yes, that's wonderful and great, but ..."

163
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,790
His favourite word is always "Question".

164
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,790
So, when he says "That's wonderful!"

165
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,750
"Question."
Then I have to be careful.

166
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,510
And it gets interesting because ...

167
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,030
in general,
what he then wants is not easy to achieve.

168
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,430
<i>SIX MONTHS</i>
<i>PRIOR TO THE FIRST BACH RECORDINGS</i>

169
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,470
Isn't it crazy?

170
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,830
This idea is really crazy.

171
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,790
I'm putting the felt in between.

172
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,030
That should actually fit there.

173
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,310
For the changeover...

174
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,110
A little too sharp.

175
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,550
Has to go back a bit.

176
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,030
Okay, that's good.

177
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,830
It has to be used like that.

178
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,790
Just try it.
Do you need a music stand?

179
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,470
Yes please.

180
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,030
That's a <i>jeu de luth.</i>

181
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,630
That would be a kind of lute piano?

182
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,550
"Lute register" on the harpsichord.

183
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,070
A question! I'm sorry.

184
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,310
The character of the tone.
Would it be okay if it wasn't muted?

185
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,670
Not totally, to be honest.
-Then it isn't good.

186
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,070
I'll take it out.

187
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,950
This isn't about the sound being rounder,
or should it be rounder?

188
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,350
I think so, yes.

189
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,270
He no longer speaks
about variety and sound,

190
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,500
but only about
temporal moments in the sound.

191
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,990
Can you imagine that?

192
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,630
This tuning of the harpsichord was pretty heavy.
Very complicated.

193
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,790
But tomorrow I'll do a little more.
Then it should actually be fine.

194
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,910
We developed this sound reflector
with Pierre-Laurent ...

195
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,710
to improve the piano's sound
in concerts with an orchestra.

196
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:22,030
And we can adjust the instrument to meet
the requirements of a given concert hall.

197
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,550
Now we are going to use it
for the first time.

198
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,660
Now we are going to open this thing.

199
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,390
Let's see if this creates absolute chaos.

200
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,710
Or simply less sound.

201
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,630
That, of course ...

202
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,510
wouldn't be bad ...

203
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,910
if we had less sound.

204
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,910
One can now clearly hear ...

205
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,990
that sound is there, but here ...

206
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,510
there is nothing.

207
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,590
That's because, when you look up there ...

208
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,710
the slats under the ceiling
are angular.

209
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,150
That was the reason
why we invented these slats.

210
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,150
I thought I could do this
the way it was planned.

211
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,870
The front one, whose frequencies
don't reach the ceiling ...

212
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,300
will be reflected directly into the hall.

213
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,030
I'm going to try it out.

214
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,350
Wonderful.

215
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,470
Very interesting!

216
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,670
For the rehearsal?
-No, for the concert.

217
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,750
We'll try that later. The question is
how it sounds with the orchestra.

218
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,550
That means, we have one direction
only for the descant.

219
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,390
Everything else is far too much.
So imposing.

220
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,460
And thus the distance is lengthened.
-But not lengthened too much.

221
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,110
Then that goes there,
and there, and there ...

222
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,910
Now it's less in the hall.
-And how is the instrument?

223
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,630
Listen to it.
-109?

224
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,590
The 109, yes.

225
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,950
But perhaps we'll have a look later.
-Yes, it's better in the intermission.

226
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:45,750
<i>WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART</i>
<i>PIANO CONCERT No, 13</i>

227
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,590
If this grand piano is really going to be sold,
I won't be happy.

228
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,190
I think that no pianist
will be happy about it.

229
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,150
But ...

230
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,430
the way it sounds,
he likes this grand piano.

231
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,510
It sounds beautiful. He is looking
for the sound of this piano.

232
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,310
You can hear that immediately.
Even on this monitor.

233
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,670
That was obvious.

234
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,750
They're talking about the transport
to Melbourne.

235
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,110
He wants us to bring it right to
the house, not just to the airport.

236
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,550
Which is probably better.

237
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,070
The piano movers in Melbourne
are not particularly well organised.

238
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,990
I must admit, I'm a little melancholic.
That was pretty strange.

239
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,590
I just thought about all the places
this piano had been and who played on it.

240
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,510
It's a long time, isn't it?
-2001.

241
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,030
I told Pierre-Laurent, he didn't believe me.
-That the piano will be sold?

242
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,910
That was at his last concert.
He was totally euphoric after that concert.

243
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,270
I said: "I have to tell you something,
you played on it for the last time."

244
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,310
His jaw dropped. He said:
"But I have recordings."

245
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,070
I said: "No, they're on a different grand."
He said: "I'm recording in January."

246
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,710
Then I said: "But not on that grand piano".

247
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,270
I thought that he was going to die.
That was really sad.

248
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,430
Oh well, but now we have to see ...

249
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,390
that this one gets there.

250
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,710
I hope that this grand can do
even more than the other.

251
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,830
I mean, they are sold from time to time ...

252
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,660
to people who are looking
for something special.

253
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,830
Stefan, I wish lots of success.
-Maybe we'll see each other in a moment.

254
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,070
Impossible!

255
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,070
This is awful!

256
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,870
Knüpfer once again.
I have a problem.

257
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:47,910
I am installing new hammer heads
into a D grand at the Konzerthaus ...

258
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:53,350
and discovered they're too narrow.
They've been slurred.

259
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,590
Herr Pupsch, are you in the workshop?

260
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,510
Okay, it won't help.

261
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,750
Shit.

262
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,600
Nothing like this has ever happened.

263
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,310
Never before.

264
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:25,030
Never! That's why I registered it
at the first glance.

265
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,510
There is, I would say ...

266
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,070
a difference of about 0.7 mm.

267
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,230
But that's actually something.

268
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,030
This is really shit. We've sold the 109,
the 245 is torn apart...

269
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,270
This ...

270
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,630
can't be true.

271
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,830
This is a catastrophe.

272
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,710
If I don't get it ready for the Bach recordings,
I don't know what I'll do.

273
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,150
Because this piano needs time.
And now I have to leave for the music festival.

274
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:27,100
Then, at the opening of the Konzerthaus ...

275
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,150
this piano will not be there.
That is absolutely unthinkable.

276
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,310
Unthinkable.
"The grand has no hammer heads in it anymore".

277
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,710
That's why I'm somewhat distressed.

278
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,830
I've asked them to turn it around because
it's longer than the width of the stage.

279
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,070
They will now have to lift it up.

280
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,310
Now it's getting tight.

281
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,190
Come in! Come up here!

282
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,870
I turned off some of the lights
as it was getting a little hot.

283
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,230
I think Mr. Brendel doesn't need
too much light anyway.

284
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,230
Could you check the sounds from the top?
-Yes, I will do that.

285
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,750
We now even out the tone.

286
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,110
Ideally, a concert piano ...

287
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,390
should have the same tone colour
from top to bottom ...

288
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,670
and the same dynamic possibilities.

289
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,420
When something is too quiet
or too loud ...

290
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,340
it can be adjusted.

291
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,750
And Stefan Knüpfer helps with that ...

292
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,420
in the friendliest manner.

293
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,430
The F needs more.

294
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,100
You have played on this piano before.
-Yes.

295
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,030
Exactly one year ago at Schloss Kammer.

296
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,790
It's the same piano.
-Ah, yes!

297
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,430
I'll play with that now for a while.
-Good, I'll be outside.

298
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,950
The colour in the head of a pianist,
that he would like ...

299
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:34,670
be it Mr. Brendel, Mr. Aimard
or whoever, stays the same.

300
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,830
He always wants the same tone colour
for a specific repertoire.

301
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,630
But the conditions,
the location, the instrument ...

302
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,830
The entire situation,

303
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,340
the humidity, the temperature ...
All this changes.

304
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,270
And now it has to be
continuously remixed ...

305
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,950
so that what is produced right there,
the quality of the sound ...

306
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,790
conforms with what the artist imagines.

307
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,470
That is the difficulty
that needs to be constantly addressed.

308
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,270
I'm going to play now.

309
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,030
Ask a great pianist
if he really is satisfied ...

310
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,230
and he will say: "Well ..."

311
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,750
Pianists are mostly dissatisfied:

312
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,390
"One could play this a little bit better,
one could have done that differently."

313
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,350
They are perhaps satisfied with parts
or maybe with an entire evening.

314
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,590
When I see the kind of life pianists have,

315
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,550
then I am really happy:

316
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,150
I can get off stage
when the public comes in.

317
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,510
Thank you. Bye.
-Okay. Bye.

318
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,270
These must be the hammer heads.

319
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,070
Yes, great!

320
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,790
This is something else here.

321
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,190
They'll fit.

322
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,550
This is skin and leather.

323
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,590
Does it smell?

324
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,430
We've been lucky,
the hammer heads arrived.

325
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:38,100
The Mozart Hall is empty at night.
Oh well, I'll have to do some overtime.

326
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,870
I have a super idea.

327
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,870
I still have an old violin at home.

328
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,400
It could be built onto the lid support.

329
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,870
Then Aleksey could play violin on it,
on the concert grand.

330
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,350
It should work.

331
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,910
That we mount the strings
on this part ...

332
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,900
Here, the pins,
because it's a little thicker.

333
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,430
One could do it on top too.

334
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:58,230
And while the other plays the piano,
he could play violin like this.

335
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:07,190
I have to check how a violin functions
and if one can put it on top of it.

336
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:44,430
Pretty sick, to ask a violinist if he has a violin
that could be chopped up.

337
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,390
The first thing that he said was:
"You want to smash it?"

338
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:51,870
He has the right instinct.
What am I supposed to do with a violin?

339
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,740
Absolutely ingenious ...

340
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:05,860
Now it's about having new ideas
for these sketches.

341
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:10,870
I keep thinking: How can the piano
be rebuilt so that something happens?

342
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,630
<i>ONE DAY BEFORE THE BACH RECORDINGS</i>

343
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,220
Dust!

344
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,910
A Japanese technician...

345
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,950
A Japanese technician,
who stood in the back ...

346
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,710
once took a tuft of dust
out of the sounding board ...

347
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,590
and held it up in front of me and said:

348
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,910
"Oh, Stefan, look what I found."

349
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,510
And I asked:
"Where did you get that?"

350
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,590
He said:
"That was on the sounding board."

351
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,790
And I said:
"Put it back immediately."

352
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,390
I can't remember if he actually did it,
but he was shocked.

353
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,670
Everything changes the sound,
even dust.

354
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,630
Hello, Stefan.
-Good morning.

355
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,670
How are you?
-Good. The flight was good?

356
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,710
Yes, a little late.
-Oh well, but ...

357
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,910
The instrument is very open.

358
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,270
Extremely, more than when we tried it.

359
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,670
It's in any case more direct.

360
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,070
Extreme, isn't it?
-Too much?

361
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,940
I think ...

362
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,510
Yes.

363
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,190
Is the sound not better in front?
It's fuller, isn't it?

364
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,990
But it comes late.

365
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:31,830
Well, I'll go along with that.
Because I can always find a combination.

366
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,550
I don't love the sound.

367
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,790
I don't know if I can organise it,
but I'm considering ...

368
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,030
showing you the other grand piano.

369
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,110
Yes? As what?

370
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,870
As ... I don't know, as an idea.

371
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,270
Because the problem is,
if I take this lightness away ...

372
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,550
it's as if you are touching
the left pedal very lightly.

373
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,910
More than the other, somewhere ...

374
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,630
But ...

375
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:10,390
Nice.

376
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,470
We could try to get this grand
on the stage tomorrow.

377
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,510
When does it begin in the morning?
-Oh, I should've come yesterday.

378
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,510
It begins at 10 o'clock.

379
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:38,030
But the fundamental tone is better.
-On the 245?

380
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:42,670
Here. On this one.
-That is more your tone, in any case.

381
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,560
I have to speak with someone important.

382
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,390
Thank you, bye.

383
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,030
I have a problem.

384
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,670
Really.

385
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,630
Would it be conceivable ...

386
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,230
He is not quite satisfied,
for the recordings.

387
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,670
Would it be conceivable
to try the other piano at the Mozart Hall?

388
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,390
Tomorrow?
-Now.

389
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,620
She's going to go berserk.

390
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:19,230
The 780 is required on the stage
in the Mozart Hall.

391
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,350
Mr. Knüpfer is standing next to me.
-Mr. Aimard requires it.

392
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,550
We are all here until 4 pm only.

393
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,220
That sounds as if I'm the one
who wants it.

394
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,550
What could still be done today?
Schubert Hall?

395
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:17,230
Good, and the situation?
-He wants to hear both next to each other.

396
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,390
So the 780, but not together with that one?
-Together.

397
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,470
It should be brought here
as a kind of warehouse.

398
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,670
Could you also turn it around?

399
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,340
Thank you.

400
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,430
So, that's easier to control.

401
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,790
Nicer, more normal ...

402
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,190
and somehow a little ...

403
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,430
not more banal,
it's too beautiful for that, but more ...

404
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:49,070
I think we could do more with the 245.

405
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,910
When does the actual recording begin?

406
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:56,430
Not before 2 pm, anyway.

407
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:01,980
When we've recorded for a few minutes
we'll be ...

408
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,710
more relaxed.
Then everything will be easier.

409
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,310
<i>START OF THE BACH RECORDINGS</i>

410
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,910
Do them all again,
I changed the plugs.

411
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:18,150
Let's start from the beginning.
I'll begin with the high notes.

412
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,870
Basses.

413
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,870
M50, left,

414
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,190
M50, right.

415
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,270
Then we have a ...

416
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,110
Surround right.

417
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,060
Even better.

418
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,550
We've done pretty much everything.
Now all we need is the artist.

419
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,230
I will go up and listen in a bit.

420
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,990
And then we'll record.

421
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,790
Question.

422
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,670
If I tune in the mornings and evenings,
and in between nothing happens,

423
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,790
I can do almost nothing
with the second tuning.

424
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:51,230
But he plays in the way
he wants it to sound ...

425
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,510
and it gets out of tune.

426
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:57,070
And then I can tune.
That is of course great.

427
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,150
Because then things
have changed enormously.

428
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:03,550
We are going to define the first sound ...

429
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,710
keeping in mind
what we want for the second sound.

430
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:11,910
It would make more sense if we first take
enough time for these sounds. Okay?

431
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,310
Of course, absolutely.
-Stefan is also doing something ...

432
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,030
He has, yes.

433
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:22,510
But I think that we need
a little reserve on three, four notes: F, G, A.

434
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,420
That's good music.
-Yes, good.

435
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,550
Better?

436
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,150
I'm outside, all right?

437
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,470
Then we'll record it in this way.

438
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,950
Recording?
-Yes.

439
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,510
Nice. Nice room ...

440
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:38,790
It's perfect. And it's in three voices,
but it sounds like two voices.

441
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,590
As a sound, it's very nice.

442
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,460
I slightly reduced the room atmosphere.

443
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,340
I think that's quite good.
-Excellent. It gives this lightness.

444
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,950
I don't also play that deep, right?
-Exactly.

445
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,150
Not so much in the core of the sound.

446
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:02,190
That makes for that "Leggiero".
-It creates ... Very nice.

447
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:10,550
There will always be the danger
that it's a bit too controlled.

448
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,110
So please ...

449
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:16,630
So you changed the room atmosphere.
-Are the group dynamics endangered?

450
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:21,390
If you now bring movement into processes,
independently ...

451
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:26,870
without involving me even a little.
We are still a team somehow, you know?

452
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,580
For me it's okay.
-Then it's good.

453
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,950
Yes, but ...
-No, I'll watch out.

454
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,470
But I can do it.
-Really, no.

455
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,150
Too heavy a thumb ...

456
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,430
shouldn't drive us in the wrong direction.

457
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:52,950
There are pianists ...

458
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:59,750
who pay great attention
to the consistency of the instrument.

459
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:06,110
And I always have the impression,
after the concert, on the next day ...

460
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:10,990
that the instrument is even more consistent
than before the concert.

461
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,270
There's a power put into it ...

462
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:18,830
which leaves an imprint
on the sounding board.

463
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,790
Not a visual imprint, that one can feel ...

464
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,350
but a tonal imprint that one can hear.

465
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:18,630
Good morning.

466
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,150
<i>Good morning, sunshine,</i>
<i>the night is hidden from you</i>

467
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,150
<i>But you mustn't be sad</i>

468
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:29,830
<i>Good morning sunshine,</i>
<i>let it get into your head</i>

469
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:34,190
I don't know him like this.
Before, he couldn't sing at all.

470
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:40,150
It is going to be the first solo recording
with sound reflectors.

471
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:45,310
Until now they were used with an orchestra,
which was the original reason for the reflectors.

472
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:50,070
But today Pierre-Laurent
will use them for his organ-like sound.

473
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:54,150
I'm convinced
that it will sound good in the hall ...

474
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:58,750
but the problem will be
capturing it in the recording.

475
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:01,870
The coffee machine!

476
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,390
Can I clear this up here?

477
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:30,070
At the beginning of the sound
you have all the harmonics.

478
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:33,470
At the end of the sound,
you only have the root note.

479
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:37,630
In between, this is what happens:
the harmonics diminish.

480
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:41,630
Then, after tuning, the overtones are gone,
otherwise it would waver ...

481
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,590
Stefan, part of your art is,
let's say ...

482
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,950
to make less complicated situations
look more complicated.

483
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,300
Was this complicated?

484
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,790
No, but you simply could say you put it
out of tune minimally until it wavers a bit.

485
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,270
But then comes the next question ...
-"There is a range, the sound is like ..."

486
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:04,070
You were the ones who said:
"You can't hear that ..."

487
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,300
We're recording again.

488
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,830
There is another beautiful major seventh.

489
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,830
Good. Let's listen.

490
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,350
I'll just play.

491
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,060
Oh, that's different.
-Yes, very different.

492
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,820
It's too much.
-We lost the ...

493
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,710
This is the previous take.

494
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,270
Yes, it sounded ...
-That's it!

495
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,510
It has everything. The rhythm,

496
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:32,030
integration.
Precisely. That's it!

497
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,630
Fine, but ...
-But we tried it.

498
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,350
He only has to press the "Undo" key.
-Sorry?

499
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,310
He has to press the "Undo" key
on the piano, then he'll have it again.

500
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,670
I'm sorry ...

501
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,150
These three notes?
They don't notice them.

502
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:57,070
This remains.
These three sounds remain.

503
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,070
I'm sorry.

504
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,310
How does one do that there?
It looks like poking around.

505
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,150
It is poking around.

506
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:18,390
Yes, nice that you get
to the point concretely.

507
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,830
And with it the pressure
of the key-stroke also changes?

508
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:29,030
It will immediately
give him another possibility ...

509
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:34,910
to produce a different tone.
He instantly feels that.

510
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,540
And he is one who really ...

511
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:42,350
He feels something immediately
where you think one cannot feel that ...

512
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:45,150
The moment his fingers
touch the keys,

513
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:50,110
he tells you immediately what you did.
It's fascinating.

514
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,350
You play piano?

515
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:56,070
I'd say that I played piano
for a very long time.

516
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:00,670
When I see the oldest hands
in this concert business ...

517
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:06,230
have such a difficult life,
don't necessarily live healthy.

518
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:10,790
Many of them are a little too neurotic,
aren't they?

519
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,870
Yes, that could ...
-... sounds too negative?

520
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,750
Instead of neurotic, I'd say specialised.

521
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:21,590
I am surely as neurotic
as far as this is concerned.

522
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:25,860
When I hear a piano on the radio ...

523
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:29,030
and I turn it off because
I can't stand the bad sound,

524
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:32,830
or when one plays a CD and says:
"I can't stand it",

525
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,110
that's also a neurosis.

526
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:40,270
But it's specialisation on the highest level.
It can also be seen like that.

527
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,470
You'll let me know
when you want to record?

528
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:06,230
He said: "You can record
everything that you hear."

529
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,550
Soon we will do the organ pieces?

530
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:15,430
What's the difference between
"with air" and "without air"?

531
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:21,310
It's a mechanical change, about how directly
the hammer heads can reach the strings.

532
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:27,270
So there is not so much "attack"?
-If one plays in the same way, yes.

533
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,990
But he doesn't.
He plays with more power ...

534
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:34,310
so the hammer head touches the string
like that, and not like that.

535
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:38,510
This is the direct tone,
if he plays hard ...

536
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,630
and if not, this is what happens.

537
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,670
So it flies ...

538
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,510
We will listen to it.

539
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,830
We're recording.
-Are you recording?

540
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:11,670
One moment,
we need just one second.

541
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,030
We're rolling.
-One moment, please.

542
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,470
One more, I'm sorry.

543
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,910
Yes, we're rolling.
-It's rolling here too.

544
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:25,910
Recording?

545
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,030
He's rockin'!

546
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:47,860
Superb!

547
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,190
They found a very good solution.

548
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,230
I brought it up a little.

549
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:33,790
There!

550
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,350
The organ should sound rather bigger and all.

551
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:05,790
We begin with the pieces
that are more assertive.

552
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,950
That are more what?
-More assertive.

553
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,540
Big organ sound, so to speak.
-With air?

554
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,150
No, without air.
That's why we are doing them.

555
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:17,940
Fabulous.

556
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,300
Listen now ...

557
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,790
Actually one could be a bit further away,
if it works.

558
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,110
That was exactly the effect, to go closer again.
Understand?

559
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:11,230
Or we'll try to see how much
we can adjust it in the mix.

560
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:12,470
I'm coming up.

561
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,390
We will listen to the tracks
in the order we recorded them.

562
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,870
You want to come in the front, Stefan?
-No it's all right.

563
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:44,470
On the one hand we should move further away,
on the other hand move closer.

564
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,390
It is more present and has more room.

565
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,710
Totally without sails?

566
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:03,310
Interesting!

567
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:15,910
We didn't see any great advantage now.

568
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,790
If you ask me...

569
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,060
No question!

570
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,350
What you can see here very nicely ...

571
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:28,070
We're coming closer to the sound
if we use some filters and so on ...

572
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:32,590
But ultimately these sound reflectors ...

573
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:37,350
come out of the idea,
out of the necessity ...

574
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:41,630
of the piano being turned into the orchestra
and no longer sounding good ...

575
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,950
to minimise this problem.

576
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,830
Still, when you listen to it
without the orchestra,

577
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,430
you notice it's only a device ...

578
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:55,070
compared with the normal set up
for which the grand piano is built.

579
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:58,390
I think that ...

580
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,230
we have to ...

581
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,200
find a different solution.

582
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,630
We are in Vienna.

583
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,390
Very Viennese.

584
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,190
Too Viennese.

585
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,270
Yeah, right ...

586
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:49,870
We only have recorded 6.59 GB today ...

587
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:54,430
Yesterday it was 9.23.
We've been lazy today.

588
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:19,630
A classical piano with these reflectors ...

589
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,400
looks a little bit spacy.

590
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:26,430
What looks different ...

591
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,200
simply cannot sound good.

592
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,310
For me it's logical:

593
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,670
We are dividing the piano
with its sounds into segments ...

594
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:50,030
and we have two microphones here
and two there. It isn't enough.

595
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:55,510
However, it sounded so beautiful
in the hall yesterday.

596
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,790
It was unbelievable.
It was so beautiful.

597
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,750
That's why I was surprised.

598
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:14,510
Sounds good.

599
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:17,100
Stefan, this is astonishing!

600
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,350
There it's starting again.

601
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,990
One of them, to the right.
-It's starting.

602
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,910
Stefan comes down again.

603
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,070
I need this, unfortunately.

604
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:38,220
Are there any others, besides ...
-No, it's really great.

605
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,070
Is it still clean enough?
-It's wonderfully clean.

606
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,590
Yes, they are really open.

607
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:46,820
Definitely.

608
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:06,790
I don't know if this one is good.
I find it very interesting.

609
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,460
It's all right.
-But it goes down.

610
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:13,790
I stretched the piano
so extremely this morning ...

611
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,990
that the smallest movement
causes the piano to tip over.

612
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,670
It's no longer clean then,
it's too sharp, or changes the sound.

613
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:26,470
It is really tuned razor sharp.

614
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:30,430
I think today will be
a very sportive day for me.

615
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:38,150
No problem,
we'll send Stefan back down.

616
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:41,670
You can leave the cake here.
-I told my wife about the successful ...

617
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:43,710
I have to make this clear now.

618
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:47,310
I told my wife about the unsuccessful
attempts with the reflectors.

619
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:51,110
She thought that a cheese cake
would be appropriate.

620
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:56,750
What would we have gotten if it had worked out?
-Also a cheesecake.

621
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,350
Because she immediately said:
"That isn't going to work."

622
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:04,950
It's really good.
I have to run now.

623
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,950
It's too sharp for me.

624
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,230
Listen to that, please.

625
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,790
Yes, and the length is perfect.

626
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,390
Otherwise I'd have to tune it all down.
-No, perfect. Thank you.

627
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:44,790
Thank you. Then we can begin.

628
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:58,430
For me, the F is on the verge
of being out of tune.

629
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:02,390
Whenever it appears within a third.

630
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:05,870
I had just set my marker here...

631
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:15,670
The F sounds pretty sharp.

632
01:24:56,080 --> 01:25:00,670
It is not as if I were disappointed.
Absolutely not.

633
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:05,230
This is like scientific research for me.

634
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,110
We leave it like that. He can come.

635
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,630
Every tone is alive.

636
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:07,710
I tried to give every single tone
at the beginning ...

637
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,270
that special movement.

638
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,190
Yes, it's fantastic!

639
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:21,710
From the start till the end
it is very expressive ...

640
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,870
but also discreet.

641
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,830
The result from all this, tonally,
was so sensational ...

642
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:47,750
that he stopped in the middle of playing
and said: "Stefan,

643
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:52,190
I've always dreamt of this sound."

644
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:57,670
So it was right on ...
It couldn't have been better.

645
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:49,590
ONE DAY AFTER THE BACH RECORDINGS
