1
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,031
Ripped from vmt-backyard-xvid.sub

2
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,001
based on actual events

3
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:16,434
Female.

4
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:22,607
Age 16 to 25.

5
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,179
Fractured femur.

6
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:27,884
Nails painted red.

7
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,620
There's a robe to one side...

8
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,227
...from the Kikay factory.

9
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:43,233
Left nipple torn off.

10
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,760
This makes how many?

11
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,674
29 bodies this year.

12
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,573
And in the past decade?

13
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,509
Don't be a prick, Hernández.

14
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,639
Gold tooth with the letter K.

15
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,976
Signs of strangulation.

16
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:30,806
-The first rape victim appeared 3 years ago.
-Or the first documented one.

17
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:36,144
Our count is 65 since then.
The reporters say 83.

18
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,586
- How many women missing?
- Again, the numbers game.

19
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:46,265
Some say 1 00. Others, 350.

20
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,926
But they sent you to clean up, right?

21
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:56,269
To clean up and take over,
once the Chief gets promoted.

22
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:02,077
Some say there's a serial killer.

23
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:06,116
There's no signature, nothing
repeated on all the victims.

24
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:10,084
83 murders in the past 3 years,

25
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,820
that's got to be a world record, right?

26
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:17,892
Look, the Gringos sure put
that building up fast.

27
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,358
They'd just started when you got here.

28
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,681
The Bible is Truth, read it!

29
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,500
Good morning, Juárez!

30
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:39,173
Border city, crossover city.
Backyard with two gates.

31
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:45,007
From the U. S., trucks roll in
loaded with used clothing,

32
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:50,655
used jalopies for sale,
expired medicines,

33
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:58,692
and rich kids looking to lose their
virginity to our top-notch sex workers.

34
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,765
And from the rest of Mexico:

35
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:08,073
the poorest of the poor roll in
looking for minimum wage in the factories,

36
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:13,507
and just maybe - God willing -

37
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:21,077
if the Border Patrol looks the other way,
they'll hop the border as wetbacks.

38
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,750
There you have it: Juárez.

39
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:30,152
Crossroads of chaos, border city.

40
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:37,095
Wounded city, crowned with
the blood of murdered girls.

41
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:44,804
This cultural education goes out
with condolences to the latest victim,

42
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:50,510
with a K on her gold tooth.
Katia, Karina, Katwoman...

43
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:56,748
To the girl whose face Death blew into.
Direct from Juárez,

44
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:01,223
broadcasting across the state of Chihuahua,
"Los Tigres del Norte."

45
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:19,506
Another body in the desert, and Kikay
doesn't want its name in the papers.

46
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:25,407
- But the victim worked for Kikay, right?
- Yes, she did. But the owner,

47
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:29,920
doesn't want dead women
associated with his brand.

48
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,724
Talk to me, Álvarez.

49
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,723
What can I do for you?

50
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:49,066
Governor, you need to respond forcefully,
to show you protect big investors in Juárez.

51
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,404
and that you suppoRT
our assembly plants, too.

52
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:59,143
This kind of news is very dangerous to us.

53
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,280
The "globalphobes" are eager...

54
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:07,353
for any negative detail they can
disseminate internationally,

55
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:11,156
to damage global brand names like ours.

56
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:16,431
I couldn't agree more with
our friend Numasaki.

57
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:21,062
I'll speak to the newspaper owners,

58
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:26,301
and keep your brand out of this.
But only as a special favor.

59
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,412
Done. Take care, Governor.

60
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:39,415
Son of a bitch... He called a
dead woman a "negative detail."

61
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:44,986
- Get me all the Ciudad Juárez news editors.
- Yes, Sir.

62
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,961
Easy, easy now.

63
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:54,539
- Those belong to...
- Meet me in my office.

64
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,672
They bashed her head in, Doctor.

65
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,244
- Sign these invoices.
- For that girl who was raped?

66
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,819
She needs anti-depressants.

67
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,547
- Hello.
- Hello Sara.

68
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,895
Sign here, please.

69
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:25,637
- Can't Susana budget it?
- She says we're broke.

70
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:30,708
-That's right.
-We'll find money somewhere.

71
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:37,440
Here's the receipts for legal
fees and daycare supplies.

72
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:41,119
Sara, isn't this Karen?

73
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:21,218
She was from Hidalgo:
no family in Juárez.

74
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,157
She worked for Kikay.

75
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,033
She came to the cops a year ago.
The date's here, you can have this.

76
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,597
Come in.

77
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,633
Excuse me.

78
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,273
Lieutenant Fierro.

79
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,272
Have a seat.

80
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,971
Her man was beating her.
They call him "The Sultan."

81
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:49,110
-Yeah: an Egyptian.
-Yeah: but you guys did nothing.

82
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:53,155
- There must have been a reason.
- Sure there was!

83
00:09:54,093 --> 00:10:02,057
Anyway, therapy taught her not
to tolerate any kind of abuse.

84
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,158
So...

85
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,532
Karen, who had a funny streak, said...

86
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,905
...she wouldn't go to the dentist anymore.

87
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,351
Not even that abuse, she told me.

88
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,820
We can take a break.

89
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:35,297
- I'm crying because I'm angry.
- Let's take a break.

90
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,264
No. When I cry out of anger,
I think better.

91
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,170
The bastard threatened her.
He called, came looking for her.

92
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:52,949
Two months ago, we filed another
complaint, and you did nothing.

93
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:58,552
You questioned him until his lawyer
showed up, then he was back on the street.

94
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,152
Fierro, bring me the file.

95
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,695
- You're a public accountant.
- Used to be.

96
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,664
We'll send the body to this address.

97
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:20,142
I'll give you that, you're great undertakers.
You find bodies, and you deliver them.

98
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,972
-Thanks for your cooperation.
-This is such a farce!

99
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,850
More than 80 have died,
around 600 are missing.

100
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,923
680 women in Ciudad Juárez
who aren't there anymore!

101
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,318
And what have you done about it?
Not one arrest!

102
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:41,358
I don't want to make excuses,
but I just got here.

103
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:46,167
I'm doing my best. But I'm understaffed,
the files are incomplete...

104
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,600
No wonder!

105
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:52,310
Let me fill in the blanks.

106
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:05,813
Each photo says where they were found,
estimated time and cause of death,

107
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:10,428
suspected sex crime or domestic violence,

108
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:14,259
or if they're considered missing.

109
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,832
- Where'd you get all this?
- The newspapers.

110
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:23,438
If you cops weren't illiterate,
you'd have the same files.

111
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,316
Let us pray.

112
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,350
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

113
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,145
- Can you give me directions?
- Let's see.

114
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:50,161
It's just past that hill. Over that way.

115
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,163
Abdalah Haddad. Born in Egypt.

116
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,833
In 1981, he beats and rapes a
woman in Palm Beach, Florida.

117
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:39,834
5 years probation. Again in 1 983:
assault and rape in Texas.

118
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,644
He gets 10 years in El Paso.

119
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,349
He's released in 3 on the
condition that he leave Gringoland.

120
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:50,017
So he crosses the border and
blesses us with his presence.

121
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,920
Here in Juárez: three drunk driving arrests.

122
00:14:54,326 --> 00:15:00,561
Two rape charges in '95.
He walks both times: no evidence.

123
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:06,767
A year ago, kidnapping and sexual assault of,
what was her name? Karen Rocha.

124
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,076
- The dead woman we found.
- He walks again.

125
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,878
Chief, I see a progression.

126
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,975
In the U.S., he attacks three
women and winds up in jail.

127
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,011
Here, he rapes a woman,
and nothing happens.

128
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,224
So he figures, this is paradise.

129
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,983
He starts killing them and nothing happens,

130
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:34,465
until he's murdered 46 in three years.

131
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,758
How'd you get that number?

132
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:42,230
I took out domestic abuse victims.
Let's say he kills a woman every month.

133
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,239
- It's just a hypothesis.
- Without any hard evidence.

134
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:55,149
Listen. I didn't graduate from
The Mexico City police academy,

135
00:15:56,088 --> 00:16:00,081
but here in Juárez, I got plenty
of tricks up my sleeve.

136
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,392
Put him behind bars,

137
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,424
and his super lawyer will
have him out in no time.

138
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:55,379
No way. Cousin Juanita!

139
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,613
- You're wet!
- Sorry. I'm all sweaty.

140
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,448
Come inside.

141
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,894
How was the trip?
Sit down.

142
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,869
From Cintalapa, Chiapas, to Villahermosa

143
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:23,340
From there to Mexico City;
From there to Durango, then here.

144
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:28,545
-Two days on a bus.
-So my uncle let you come after all?

145
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:33,410
Hang on... He sent you two things.

146
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,083
Gimme a second.

147
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:47,588
He figures, he's gonna die soon,
and since all the single men left town,

148
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,496
he let me come.

149
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,800
You know the last thing Pa said?

150
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:02,044
I'm getting on the bus, and he says:
"Don't you come back pregnant. "

151
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,116
C'mon. I'll show you your room.

152
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,619
- A room for me?
- You're not in a village anymore.

153
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,086
A whole room, all to yourself.

154
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,851
- For real?
- Yep.

155
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,637
Hold still.

156
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,205
I'll take out the Indian, you'll see.

157
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,422
Look cousin, that's the United States.

158
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,085
- Where?
- There!

159
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:04,093
Someday I'm gonna cross.

160
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,128
You're not crossing the street
without my permission, kiddo.

161
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:17,615
If I ever told you I love you
that I'd give my life for you

162
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:22,743
if I ever told you I loved you
it won't happen again

163
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,866
Looking good, Juana.

164
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,662
Put on your sneakers.

165
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:41,534
- Good, how?
- In good health.

166
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,603
Have a seat, please.

167
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,009
Take these birth control pills.

168
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,018
To not have kids?

169
00:20:56,822 --> 00:21:00,849
- Do you have a sex life?
- Of course not, Doctor!

170
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:05,896
Juana, girls change here.
They're liberated.

171
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:10,626
They make their own money and decisions,
especially with no parents around.

172
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,504
I'm not going to get knocked up!

173
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:19,940
That's what these are for.
Every month, you take a test.

174
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,505
If you're pregnant, you're fired.

175
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,081
OK?

176
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,105
Márgara.

177
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:06,084
Set the tray down, open it,

178
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,620
put in the part,

179
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,957
then close and release...

180
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:21,232
Cold sweat means the
desert is getting to you.

181
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:25,868
That's what you get for
driving around alone.

182
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,575
In Veracruz, we call it dengue.

183
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:32,580
It happens, then it just goes away.

184
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:39,083
I want to check him out.
I take full responsibility.

185
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,887
You got it.

186
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,127
You were never here.

187
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,260
Nope. Never.

188
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,552
Cover me.

189
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:22,265
Whiskey. One more.

190
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,799
Get me a whiskey. One more.

191
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,970
Yes? Yes?

192
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:44,081
- Freeze!
- Hands behind your head!

193
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,515
Now!

194
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,459
Get dressed!

195
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,625
Stay back!

196
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,733
Where would I call from, asshole?

197
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,264
Get dressed!

198
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,073
Cover up.

199
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:09,480
Stay back. Move! Get dressed.

200
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,711
- How old are you?
- 19.

201
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:33,196
- Serious injuries, Fierro?
- Very serious.

202
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:37,431
This is your fourth assault.
You're under arrest.

203
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,109
Let's go.

204
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,234
Mr. Governor.

205
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,675
The alleged serial killer
of Ciudad Juárez.

206
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:19,406
They just nabbed him?
How "alleged" is he?

207
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:24,411
The Juárez Police Chief
says he's the real deal.

208
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,589
- Leak it to the press.
- Correct.

209
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:50,514
- Márgara, I gotta pee.
- Don't miss a beat.

210
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,613
When I say "now," let me in.
Now!

211
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,519
1 0 minutes to go, once a day.

212
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,915
Lunch is 1 0 minutes.

213
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:31,013
-Hard work, huh, Juana?
-No way.

214
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,287
Shift supervisor?

215
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,924
Your cousin says this job's for sissies.

216
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:42,089
Back home, I got up to
chop wood before dawn.

217
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:48,631
Then I made Pa breakfast,
picked corn 'til noon,

218
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:52,402
came home to feed Pa, cleaned house.

219
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:56,914
Sometimes we'd cross the river
and go to the store, remember?

220
00:26:57,415 --> 00:27:00,441
But we always had to come home,
wash up, make dinner.

221
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,916
For your Pa.

222
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:06,657
- And here we get paid, Juana.
- For only 9 hours, Monday to Friday.

223
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,524
And thank God, today is...

224
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,821
Friday!

225
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,880
When did you last see Karen Rocha?

226
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,055
It's a simple question.

227
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:48,927
What you need is a good fuck.
Somebody to wipe your ass.

228
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:51,031
Get outta here.

229
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,538
- You've got 2 phone calls.
- Leave, servant girl.

230
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:17,217
It's his lawyer. He says
he's got a nasty hangover.

231
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:25,364
Fuck me! That broad with him
was our whole case.

232
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:30,838
- She crossed the border.
- Where to?

233
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,307
They don't know either.
She got cold feet and took off.

234
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,245
That asshole stays in jail anyway.

235
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:43,580
Maybe then, the killing will stop.

236
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,204
Mickey Santos.

237
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,806
He owns nightclubs, gas stations, etc.

238
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,815
Legit?

239
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,952
As far as we know, squeaky clean.

240
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:20,086
He makes money in Juárez,
but he lives on the gringo side.

241
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:24,650
Makes a fortune on booze,
but he won't touch the stuff.

242
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:10,271
- Hey, are you from Oaxaca?
- No.

243
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:19,906
- Why, are you?
- Tecpatán, Oaxaca.

244
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:21,749
No way!

245
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,889
- No way?
- What a coincidence!

246
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:29,425
- But you're not from Oaxaca.
- No... Cintalapa, Chiapas.

247
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:33,155
Boy, that really is some coincidence.

248
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:37,460
Dummy. Cintalapa is right next to Oaxaca.

249
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:41,731
- Next to Tecpatán?
- No, next to the other side.

250
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,809
Do you speak Tzeltal?

251
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,074
- Can you?
- A little.

252
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,579
My grandparents taught me.

253
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:58,381
Have a beer.

254
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,185
What for? I'm happy with my soda.

255
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,259
Shall we dance?

256
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:15,464
Your sister knows the moves.
She even found a boyfriend!

257
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:22,079
That's my cousin, Márgara.
And she didn't find a boyfriend.

258
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,215
She's just dancing.

259
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,583
What are you laughing at?

260
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,452
- It's different here.
- What?

261
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:42,255
-What's different?
-What's what?

262
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:49,136
- What are we talking about?
- I don't know, do you?

263
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:58,109
Come on. I'll show you.

264
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:02,783
Let's go then.

265
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:31,104
This woman's face looks familiar.

266
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:35,579
Where would you know her from?

267
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:37,009
Take a close up.

268
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,139
Real close.

269
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:48,249
This one too.

270
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:56,061
- She's been missing over a year.
- That can't be.

271
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,000
- Dead that long, her face would be disfigured.
- Maybe they had her locked up.

272
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,900
Where was the other one?

273
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,307
Here she is.

274
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,179
Disappeared 1 5 months ago.

275
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:21,453
Either they were kept captive,
or killed and preserved somehow.

276
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:27,853
- Where are the others?
- Here.

277
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,052
Sara.

278
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,450
We've perfected the funeral service.

279
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:33,189
I collect bodies, you bring mourners,
they bring crosses.

280
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:56,352
The first thing you notice about Juárez
is the extraordinary sky.

281
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:01,820
A blue that isn't just heavenly,
it's incredibly cobalt.

282
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:08,398
Then there's the 150 degree sky the ice-cold
wind seems to make bigger by the minute.

283
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:16,106
Maybe it's because of the surreal sky
we live under surreal circumstances.

284
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,334
A case in point:

285
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:22,510
remember that serial killer,
the one whose capture

286
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,174
our valiant Governor pinned
on his chest like a medal?

287
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:30,879
Well, you may recall that
after he went behind bars,

288
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:35,754
the bodies of another eight
women appeared within days,

289
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:42,260
and since then, every week another
body, like goddamn clockwork.

290
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:48,738
But incredibly enough, this
alleged serial killer is still in jail,

291
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:53,934
as if he could murder from his cell.
Or maybe he does it by...

292
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:55,769
telepathy?

293
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,419
I have on the line so he can explain
his magical techniques,

294
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,021
Mr. Abdalah Haddad,

295
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:09,826
the so-called telepathic killer.

296
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:14,323
How are they treating you in prison?

297
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,963
I can't complain, Mr. Peralta.

298
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:22,071
I'd like your listeners to know...

299
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:28,341
that I'm the perfect scapegoat, Sir,

300
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:34,081
because of my reputation as a
ladies' man and heavy drinker.

301
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:37,386
You also have quite a rap sheet.

302
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:42,925
Criminal records in Florida,
Texas, and Ciudad Juárez too.

303
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,320
Yeah, that's true.

304
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:53,436
Last I heard...

305
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:19,961
Fabricated evidence.

306
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:42,317
Yes, I cross into
Mexico every Friday.

307
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:48,347
I check the books and tell
my managers what to do.

308
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:53,653
Banks move the money, the rest
is processed by phone or Internet.

309
00:38:55,032 --> 00:39:00,060
- You only visit Juárez on Fridays?
- I might have on a Thursday,

310
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,041
...or Monday, as an exception.

311
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,688
The Sultan called you from jail.

312
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:21,925
Yes, he left several messages,
but I didn't answer.

313
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,624
He wanted to ask you a favor.
What was it?

314
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:32,427
I didn't talk to him. I don't
know The Sultan that well.

315
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:39,507
I hired him, then fired him for the
same reason you think he's the killer.

316
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:45,245
- Which is...
- Which is that he's sick with hatred.

317
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:49,009
He hit a secretary, picture that.

318
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:51,844
I can picture him doing
something as awful

319
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:55,583
as biting off a teenager's
nipple before killing her.

320
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:03,923
You two met in jail in El Paso.
In the sex offenders' area.

321
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,297
That's official.

322
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,630
If it's official, I don't see
what your question is.

323
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:14,036
Are you familiar with the word
"rehabilitate"?

324
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:19,345
Some say there are jails where
prisoners are rehabilitated,

325
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,883
and jails where they're punished.

326
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:26,621
I say it depends on the prisoner,
not the prison.

327
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:31,817
I died when I went to jail,

328
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:36,296
and I rehabilitated myself there.

329
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:40,431
You know those eight
women found last month?

330
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:44,841
Three were kidnapped over a year ago.

331
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:50,447
Forensics says these women were frozen.

332
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,349
Frozen?

333
00:40:56,487 --> 00:41:00,890
Two questions: any idea where
they were kept frozen that long?

334
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:08,498
And how does The Sultan send
women to their graves from a jail cell?

335
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:18,267
I'll try and think of anything
I might have heard

336
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:23,402
...Haddad say that would be useful to you.

337
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:31,650
Hello? Don't be long with those copies.

338
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:52,470
- There's your boyfriend, Juana.
- He's looking good.

339
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:56,477
I'll be home late.

340
00:41:56,947 --> 00:42:01,407
No. Be back early. You've got to
rest up for tomorrow.

341
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:07,682
- Hi.
- Hi.

342
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:12,953
- Did you find a job?
- Nothing so far.

343
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:45,960
I fall onto the assembly line,
then the hammer falls on my face.

344
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,192
You dreamt that last night?

345
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:54,198
I dreamt it while I was working.

346
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,870
I kept on going. Pull, wind, release.

347
00:42:57,141 --> 00:43:01,237
I didn't close my eyes or skip a piece.

348
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:05,006
What you dream in 1 second,
takes 5 minutes to tell.

349
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:09,345
Really? Well, that must have been it...

350
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,253
You're laughing at me?

351
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:18,225
I'm just looking at you, Juana.

352
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:23,491
I brought this for you.

353
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:36,911
- We'll listen to it in your truck.
- All right.

354
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:41,782
Or at your place.

355
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:13,903
Are you all right?

356
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:19,011
There, there now.

357
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:50,712
That kata was the Cat.
Here goes the Dragon.

358
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,053
What?

359
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,195
Don't play dumb.

360
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:13,502
Well, I know my katas too.

361
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:19,566
For example, this is the kata of...

362
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,511
The kata of...

363
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:47,563
Kiss me?

364
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:55,243
We should talk to your father first.

365
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:03,012
He's in Cintalapala, CutbeRTo.
And he doesn't have a phone.

366
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:07,356
With Márgara, then.

367
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:16,258
Why? She's my cousin, not my Ma,
may she rest in peace.

368
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:22,702
Cutberto...

369
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:25,905
What?

370
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:39,249
I want you to know... it doesn't
matter we're alone here,

371
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:42,415
without our parents.

372
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:46,219
This is serious for me, Juana.

373
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:50,596
Real serious.

374
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:53,894
For me too.

375
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,827
From General Electric,

376
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:23,390
from Toshiba, from esparza...

377
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:27,195
from Maderas Nacionales.

378
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:30,368
From Ford.

379
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:34,433
Women who worked at different plants.

380
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:39,111
The Cheros locked us up in basements.

381
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,716
All of them downtown, I think.

382
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:50,051
I met another four women.

383
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:55,254
- Were any there over 3 months?
- Nobody I met.

384
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:01,594
They call it Angel's Delight.

385
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,843
They rape you every day.

386
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:14,080
But they save the Delight...

387
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:20,720
for when they're going to kill you.

388
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:26,685
They tell you all about it.

389
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:33,369
During the final rape, they strangle you,

390
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,034
and then you really squeeze your sex tight

391
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,008
because you're about to die.

392
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:49,742
They raffle it off,

393
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,848
and whoever wins, enjoys.

394
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:59,118
Tell her to see me outside.

395
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:12,669
Write any names you remember.

396
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:20,709
What's up, Chief?

397
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:25,948
You helped the victim
and let the rapists get away.

398
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:29,551
- She was bleeding.
-Bleeding to death from her breast?

399
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:35,262
- I thought that...
- You didn't think, you felt!

400
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:38,833
That's why women make
good nurses and bad cops.

401
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:41,900
We'd have those fuckers and
she'd be in the hospital,

402
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:44,632
if you'd gone after them
instead of the victim.

403
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:50,576
- All right, I made a mistake.
- I'm taking you off the case.

404
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:54,180
All you've done is drive
around in the desert.

405
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:57,084
I'll release The Sultan for
lack of evidence.

406
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,087
We arrest him...

407
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:03,988
and the Cheros kidnap and kill women.
Like they had a deal.

408
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:08,557
Let's plan a raid and nab all
the Cheros the same night.

409
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:12,761
How many cops do you need?
How about transportation, weapons?

410
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:17,700
We're in Juárez, woman.
Here the motto is:

411
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:23,937
Ain't got none, no can do,
couldn't be done.

412
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:35,220
Yes? Be right there.

413
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:38,020
They're here.

414
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:48,697
Hello.
Welcome, Hilda.

415
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,104
Thank you very much.

416
00:51:56,346 --> 00:52:00,373
How about some wine?

417
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:03,451
Thanks.

418
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,555
How will you support this child?

419
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:12,652
Like I said. I'll work in the factories.

420
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,092
Yes, but you didn't think it through.

421
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:20,803
Where will he stay while you're at work?

422
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:24,201
I'll figure out something.

423
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:30,072
You'll tie him to the crib, like the rest?

424
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:34,416
- Better than not being born.
- Who says it's better?

425
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:40,554
I don't want to have it. God does.

426
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:46,618
Those bastards left you in pieces.
Don't keep punishing yourself.

427
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:51,695
The important thing is you have a choice.

428
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:55,100
I can take you to a doctor
and cover expenses,

429
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,170
but only you can decide.

430
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:11,584
So this is what you do
in your spare time.

431
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,881
You go around in circles.

432
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:21,631
When is this raid going to happen?

433
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:27,632
Juárez doesn't have the officers
and victims aren't a priority, so...

434
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:31,303
it's never going to happen.

435
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:36,546
There's a story I read.

436
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:42,281
A town in India holds a ceremony
once every full moon.

437
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:46,317
Until one night, a tiger shows up...

438
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:49,716
and eats someone. They flee in terror.

439
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:56,125
A month later they gather again,
scared this time.

440
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:01,269
Same story: the tiger jumps out,
devours someone, and escapes.

441
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:06,138
The next month, the town
gathers again, but this time...

442
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:13,282
they're not scared, because now
the tiger is part of the ceremony.

443
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:17,752
He forms part of the ritual.

444
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:25,352
Easy for the world to say,
how can this be?

445
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,698
Just like these murders.

446
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,700
A woman dies every month, or every week.

447
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,975
It's expected, and no one cares.

448
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:46,978
It bothered us for a while, but now...

449
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:51,643
we're just waiting for the tiger to come.

450
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,479
Is Assistant Director Arizmendi in?

451
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,943
Where am I calling from? From home.

452
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:30,490
And you think a front page
would change things?

453
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:36,857
I'll send facts from my files,
and I can even write the story.

454
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,597
No Sara, I'd send a reporter,
but I'll tell you why I can't.

455
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:45,439
And please, don't be offended.

456
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:50,977
Women being raped and murdered
in Juárez isn't news anymore.

457
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:54,781
But you could make front-page news...

458
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:58,943
out of murdered women not being
news anymore in our country.

459
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:02,348
Sara, explain something to me.

460
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:07,258
This is big: why ask me,
and not the director?

461
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:12,126
Because these women are killed
solely for being women.

462
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:17,399
So you think front page is too much.

463
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:24,069
State news, page what?

464
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:28,348
Six? Or the crime sheet.

465
00:56:29,452 --> 00:56:34,856
Got it. Let me rethink this. Thanks.

466
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:41,688
Get me the Bureau Chief
at the New York Times.

467
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:06,088
Juárez is the world's biggest
producer of sex crimes.

468
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:10,793
I don't want any discussion.
That's how they see us today.

469
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,654
I want answers.

470
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:18,734
I don't want speeches about
social decay in Ciudad Juárez.

471
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:21,462
I want proposals, fresh solutions.

472
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:26,473
Above all, visible solutions.
Do I make myself clear? Visible!

473
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:32,414
- Personal defense courses for women.
- A campaign on radio and TV.

474
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,843
Lighting in poor neighborhoods.

475
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:38,954
More officers, more weapons,
more lab equipment.

476
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:42,114
Public transportation in slums.

477
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:44,488
A police raid to arrest suspects.

478
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:49,526
Roger.

479
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:54,765
Let's go, Fierro.

480
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:45,520
Weren't we supposed to meet here?

481
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:49,152
In a minute. He's teaching
me the quebradita.

482
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:52,954
- You're coming with me.
- You're not married, bro'.

483
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:55,222
Come with me, right now.

484
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:54,087
Nobody move, police!

485
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:06,763
Good evening, Juárez.

486
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:12,637
The powers of good were miraculously
unleashed, armed to the teeth.

487
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:18,441
Victor Peralta here, repoRTing on an
extraordinary event that took place tonight.

488
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:24,542
Under Captain Blanca Bravo,
officers from the state capital

489
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:28,589
surrounded the downtown area.

490
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:34,924
They caught the Cheros gang leader
The Fish and his sidekick, The Bear.

491
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:39,999
They caught The Wolf and his coke dealers.

492
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:47,068
They caught Margarito, Ledezma,
The Stag, The Ox, The Bull...

493
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:53,204
All the flora and fauna that were
taking over downtown Juárez.

494
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:59,219
They also picked up a few good
citizens who were out having fun.

495
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:03,689
A perfectly planned operation,
without a single shot fired.

496
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:09,162
Oh, and three kidnapped women
were rescued from a basement.

497
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:16,201
More to come on this, our news program.
This is Víctor Peralta. Good night.

498
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:35,685
Don't look at me, fucker!
A message for your Chief:

499
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:39,491
He should have tipped me off
about the time, date and place.

500
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:45,262
And you tell him not to rest easy.
Because he owes me a life.

501
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:48,328
And I'm gonna take it.

502
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,738
Asshole.

503
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,278
Next group.

504
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:08,950
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Hold your numbers up.

505
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:11,954
Hilda.

506
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:18,557
Thirty-three.

507
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:21,496
Thirty-three.

508
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:29,668
I'll be right back, kiddo.

509
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,211
Next.

510
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:41,517
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Numbers up.

511
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:43,522
No one.

512
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,390
No one.

513
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:48,325
Step back. Outside. Move.

514
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:55,059
- Juana, I'm talking to you.
- What do you want, Cut?

515
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:57,570
Let's talk. I'll take you home.

516
01:02:57,907 --> 01:03:02,105
- Dude, take it easy or I'll...
- Quiet, this is my problem!

517
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:15,614
I work 9 hours Monday through Friday
so I can do what I want on Saturday.

518
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:18,325
Why don't you love me anymore?

519
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:29,493
I feel like we belong to each other.

520
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:37,543
I'm not marrying him in
three days either, Cut.

521
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,178
I'm my own boss.

522
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:47,179
I wanna meet people. Not get tied down.

523
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:49,353
That's not fair.

524
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:53,356
Maybe you feel that way now.

525
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:57,662
But look, I can do whatever I want.

526
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:02,962
And like they say on TV:
my body is my body.

527
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:08,942
Let me go, and let's be friends, OK?

528
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:17,175
Enough already, easy, easy.
Join us macho men.

529
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:20,651
Don't look back, she ain't worth it.

530
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:26,594
I'm tired of this work.

531
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:33,392
I want a huge desk with 8 phones
and 15 secretaries in the state capital.

532
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:37,939
Not all this hassle.
You wanna know the worst?

533
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:41,404
That fucker who beat the shit
outta you is nuts.

534
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,376
He's got his own private religion,
understand?

535
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:51,284
- Nope. Why don't you explain?
- Let's see, how do I explain?

536
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:56,553
- What bullshit will you feed me?
- Yeah, what bullshit...

537
01:04:58,194 --> 01:05:01,129
How about something that
interests you instead?

538
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,628
How about replacing me on the force?

539
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:11,133
Who they pick depends on me.

540
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:15,108
- What about Blanca?
- Oh, sorry...

541
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:17,838
If you're worried about Blanca's future...

542
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:20,778
- forget about my proposition.
- Come on, Chief.

543
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,650
Of course I'm interested.

544
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:32,486
Take some time off until your face heals.

545
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:38,323
Go through the parking lot
so no one sees you.

546
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:53,015
Sir?

547
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:57,141
Well done, Chief. Now get this.

548
01:05:57,887 --> 01:06:03,951
After this display, the Governor
wants results. From you, personally.

549
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,989
From me, personally.

550
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:13,963
I'll make sure we get convictions.
In every interrogation.

551
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:17,632
I really appreciate this, Sir.

552
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:30,316
Dead men triple raped women,
and there's no police raids.

553
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:33,344
Besides, what city doesn't have
both dead men and women?

554
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:38,451
Problem is, that new cop is more
interested in dead women than men.

555
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:40,618
Reverse sexism, dude.

556
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:50,130
But the dead men are always armed.

557
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:54,706
They're mostly dealers, right?
And they get shot in the crossfire.

558
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:59,871
But not the dead women. They take
them so they can screw them.

559
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:04,146
And they bite them or cut off a breast,
some skin between their legs.

560
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:11,123
If they were armed, at least
they'd have a chance.

561
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:14,221
We gotta give these
goddamn broads guns?

562
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,303
Keep talking, Oaxaca.

563
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:26,639
You know a man by how he
treats women and children.

564
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:30,108
Oh, Oaxaca. That's why
she done you wrong.

565
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:33,439
You're a loser.

566
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,944
Ma!

567
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:05,279
Gimme more salsa.

568
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:09,583
Estela, give Ma a hand. Move!

569
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:14,586
Look at her. Move it!

570
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:18,360
C'mon, it's gonna get cold.

571
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:23,298
Take a hit, Oaxaca.

572
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:31,472
I'm gonna explain this real slow.

573
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,139
That woman disgraced you.

574
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:44,516
And in public, to boot!

575
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:50,849
You gave her everything.
You gave it your all.

576
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:55,496
and the ungrateful bitch
stabbed you in the back.

577
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,605
So now you got two choices.

578
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:08,107
Like seeing yourself double
in these shades.

579
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:12,242
You see yourself double?

580
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:19,313
Or you forgive her and keep moaning,

581
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,490
or you don't forgive shit

582
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,461
and quit being such a fag.

583
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:38,033
Street lamps all over the city.
Public transportation where workers live,

584
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:40,300
a bigger and better police force.

585
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:41,840
I'm getting to that.

586
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:04,598
With publicity from big business
and the U.S. government,

587
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:08,999
you can launch a program making
Ciudad Juárez a model city.

588
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:15,007
Like the Marshall Plan the U.S. created
in Germany and Japan after World War II.

589
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:21,148
We're not your enemies,
like Germany and Japan back then.

590
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:23,476
We're your neighbors.

591
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:30,057
But it's no good for you to have poor
neighbors, because that means trouble.

592
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:33,862
It makes us a bad market.

593
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:54,334
You gave us 1,200 bucks per body.
Just like we agreed, Sultan.

594
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:15,157
That was the price per woman.
I joked about sales tax.

595
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:24,537
We had to bring you underwear
and a news clipping for each body.

596
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,498
You paid us 1 1,400 dollars.

597
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:34,948
That's why the brand names
are moving their factories to...

598
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:38,952
China or India. Unless...

599
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:42,182
We offer highly trained labor here.

600
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:48,229
Or, less expensive. Not more.

601
01:12:50,933 --> 01:12:53,197
I don't know that fucker!

602
01:12:57,339 --> 01:13:00,502
We have records of the
Cheros visiting you in jail.

603
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:25,290
They're bringing them in now. We want
to eradicate this kind of situation.

604
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:28,661
We want some answers.

605
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:32,435
Here comes Captain Blanca...

606
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:35,304
What can you tell us about this situation?

607
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,311
Nothing right now, thanks.

608
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:44,044
No comment, thank you.

609
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:52,055
- You're famous now, right?
- I don't have press clearance.

610
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:54,159
Let's talk off the record.

611
01:13:56,698 --> 01:14:00,657
- What do you want?
- To offer you rebuttal.

612
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:05,667
Because what I'm saying is:
it doesn't fit.

613
01:14:06,308 --> 01:14:09,539
- What doesn't fit?
- The results of your investigation.

614
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:15,473
-The Cheros didn't kill the last 11 women.
-They confessed, you heard them.

615
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:18,745
They confessed The Sultan hired
them 3 months ago to kill women.

616
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:25,088
So how come three victims were
missing over a year? It doesn't fit.

617
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:31,357
Did you "interrogate" them?
Were you even there?

618
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:37,862
I'll say on the air the cops
told them what to confess,

619
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:42,306
and the evidence was tainted
by their use of brute force.

620
01:14:43,278 --> 01:14:46,008
And in the middle of this cesspool,
you're a peculiar figure.

621
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:51,047
Do me a favor: leave me out of it.

622
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:59,593
A cop who has used illegal methods
in pursuit of a legitimate goal:

623
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:02,525
ending the murders of women in Juárez.

624
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:06,862
A cop moved by holy rebellion,
because holy rebellions do exist,

625
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:10,664
but within an impossible context
of corruption and inefficiency

626
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:13,603
only someone in power could change.

627
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:18,303
Let's say: the Governor.
Nice man, good Catholic...

628
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:22,974
...but totally incapable of making his
Christian will be done in the real world.

629
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:25,745
- Turn it off!
- You all know him, a man who's deeply--

630
01:15:57,619 --> 01:15:58,916
Hey.

631
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:14,830
Just a minute.

632
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:21,800
- This is my cooling system.
- Fantastic.

633
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:25,643
You never smile.

634
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:33,884
Not when you take me to see something
awful the same day I get fired.

635
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:36,424
Is that the Governor's plan?

636
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:39,319
- So they say.
- My goodness!

637
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:41,852
Hallelujah, praise be to God.

638
01:16:42,798 --> 01:16:46,461
This very day our Lord Governor
arrives in Juárez to, and I quote,

639
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:50,231
establish order and keep the peace,

640
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:55,908
which means chopping off
Captain Blanca Bravo's head

641
01:16:56,078 --> 01:17:00,310
for the sin of meddling with
our very well organized crime.

642
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:06,443
Take notice, as he descends
from that powerful, silver Pullman bus...

643
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:11,986
Hit me.
Right in the face, Márgara.

644
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:17,594
C'mon. Go for the face or balls,
don't waste time.

645
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:26,002
See why it's got to be the
face or balls from the start?

646
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:29,143
Because if not, I've already
immobilized you, just like that.

647
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:36,912
Thanks, Márgara. Juana, your turn.

648
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:42,989
I approach. What do you say?

649
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:45,820
- Stop right there!
- But I...

650
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:48,986
- Right there, not another step!
- But I come closer.

651
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,270
Don't go, how come you told him you'd go?

652
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:04,138
Oh, Márgara, poor Cutberto.

653
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:11,110
I really liked him, I feel bad
he's not over me yet.

654
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:27,163
Every night there's a full moon,
the wind carries the screams.

655
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:35,107
- And if there isn't a full moon?
- Well, it's quiet and abandoned, like.

656
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:40,113
It's next to the border fence.

657
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:42,708
-Tell me where to go.
-Yes.

658
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:49,388
I'll just make nice and catch
up with you at home, OK?

659
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:52,255
- Rent some videos.
- You got it.

660
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,487
If you're in trouble, you call me.

661
01:18:54,963 --> 01:19:00,526
- Hey, hot Mama, call me instead.
- I'm your man, princess.

662
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:05,898
- Ooo, I'm scared.
- Take it easy, Juana.

663
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:10,205
One o'clock on the dot, you hear?

664
01:19:10,345 --> 01:19:12,404
Don't worry, cuz.

665
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:15,414
Not just pretty, bilingual too!

666
01:19:40,542 --> 01:19:45,809
- But where the hell did I go wrong?
- Nowhere. I want to meet more people.

667
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:47,972
There's another name for that.

668
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:51,746
-If you're going to disrespect me, I'm leaving.
-Wait.

669
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:42,291
- Since when do you smoke?
- Since you broke my heart, Juana.

670
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:52,635
Can I tell you something, Cut?
You're making me sleepy.

671
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:58,710
What's it gonna be, Juana?
You gonna dance with me too?

672
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:05,786
Or like the song says,
with everyone else but me?

673
01:22:08,356 --> 01:22:13,692
Careful, Cut. You can't
touch me unless I say so.

674
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:18,861
Stay away from me.
Stay back, not one step closer.

675
01:23:17,058 --> 01:23:19,424
- Let's go.
- What's inside?

676
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:21,458
What's inside?

677
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:24,861
A big freezer. Down in the basement.

678
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:29,299
- What do you mean, a freezer?
- Like from a slaughterhouse.

679
01:23:29,871 --> 01:23:31,771
Anything in it?

680
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:38,578
No. Empty. An empty freezer
in the middle of the desert.

681
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,268
Goodbye, princess.

682
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:26,344
C'mon, go for it.

683
01:26:11,566 --> 01:26:15,332
- Did I get you in trouble, Blanca?
- That's your job, right?

684
01:26:19,207 --> 01:26:24,770
Judging what others do, what they
don't do, what they should do,

685
01:26:25,213 --> 01:26:30,776
how they should do it.
Sitting next to a microphone,

686
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:32,416
having an opinion.

687
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:38,148
Yes, that's my job:
criticizing next to an open mike.

688
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:40,789
Is the Governor in town yet?

689
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:45,154
You think he's firing me.
I heard you yesterday.

690
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,165
That's right.

691
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:53,363
Maybe instead of talking to me, he'll just
give the Chief orders that affect me.

692
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:03,373
Anyway... given the situation,
I want you to know a few things,

693
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:08,517
so you can "have an opinion" later on.

694
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:10,922
I'm listening...

695
01:27:13,194 --> 01:27:15,754
The Sultan and the Cheros. It's true.

696
01:27:16,164 --> 01:27:20,863
The evidence is flimsy. They may
or may not have murdered women.

697
01:27:21,536 --> 01:27:25,097
And there are several others.

698
01:27:25,306 --> 01:27:26,603
Several?

699
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:32,005
These deaths won't stop because
a serial killer is still on the loose.

700
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:34,543
A murderer with a fixed method.

701
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:39,284
Maybe, and this is just a hypothesis,

702
01:27:40,054 --> 01:27:41,316
he captures his victims every full moon...

703
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:45,882
and stores them in a basement,
in an industrial freezer.

704
01:27:47,028 --> 01:27:50,794
Then, after a few months,
he throws them into the desert.

705
01:27:51,165 --> 01:27:54,362
So what is he? Narco-satanic?

706
01:27:55,169 --> 01:27:59,629
Who knows, someone
connected to the Cheros...

707
01:27:59,807 --> 01:28:03,971
put 3 bodies in that vacant lot,
the ones that didn't fit.

708
01:28:04,178 --> 01:28:06,806
Why give the Cheros 3 bodies?

709
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:11,082
To get rid of them and to confuse things,

710
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:15,519
or as a favor between accomplices.
And there are other killers.

711
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:19,719
- Snuff pornographers.
- Could be.

712
01:28:19,861 --> 01:28:22,989
- Organ traffickers.
- Could be, too.

713
01:28:23,364 --> 01:28:25,457
Wannabes, killing for sport.

714
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:30,728
Yes, it could be any of those theories,
or all of them at once.

715
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:33,634
Then there's domestic violence.

716
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:37,176
A husband kills his wife because
she didn't cook dinner,

717
01:28:37,845 --> 01:28:41,337
or an uncle rapes his niece
and makes sure she won't talk.

718
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:46,313
So what are the facts, Blanca?

719
01:28:48,856 --> 01:28:51,882
Murder a woman in Juárez,
throw her into the desert

720
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:58,021
and you have a license to kill.
It'll be buried on a crime sheet,

721
01:28:59,367 --> 01:29:03,394
because the cops won't investigate.
Not thoroughly, anyway.

722
01:29:03,538 --> 01:29:06,029
No one will be charged with
anything that sticks

723
01:29:06,407 --> 01:29:09,240
and no judge will ever
hand down a sentence.

724
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:16,913
Explain the circumstances to the Governor.

725
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:41,637
C'mere.

726
01:29:43,511 --> 01:29:47,538
- Give me five, ten minutes.
- Hang on.

727
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:04,627
You can come in.

728
01:30:14,709 --> 01:30:17,803
- You made an arrest with no evidence.
- That's right.

729
01:30:17,979 --> 01:30:22,075
- And you kept him in jail.
- That's right.

730
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,411
You used torture to get
false confessions.

731
01:30:25,453 --> 01:30:26,715
No, Sir.

732
01:30:26,988 --> 01:30:29,752
- No torture was used, you say?
- I wouldn't know.

733
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:35,021
- The Chief wouldn't-
-You plea bargained with these Cheros

734
01:30:35,196 --> 01:30:38,188
to frame this "Sultan".

735
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:41,631
- Sentencing for murder-
-You coerced a woman to abort.

736
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:46,365
- I informed her-
-Unsolicited information.

737
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:50,773
You offered her shelter and a job
if she had an abortion.

738
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:54,007
You forced her to kill her own child.

739
01:30:56,784 --> 01:30:59,378
That's a serious accusation,
one that merits time in prison.

740
01:30:59,554 --> 01:31:02,318
- Let me explain-
- What the hell is going on out there?

741
01:31:05,326 --> 01:31:10,127
You know what gets my goat?
You're proud of what you did.

742
01:31:10,431 --> 01:31:14,800
Doing nothing is worse.
These are 1 7-year-old women...

743
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:17,631
Ramírez, go see what the fuck
is going on out there!

744
01:31:19,373 --> 01:31:24,709
Now hear this, you broke the law
and there is no justification.

745
01:31:24,879 --> 01:31:26,870
- Let me explain-
- Shut up!

746
01:31:28,883 --> 01:31:33,183
You're going to lose your job,
your badge, and your freedom.

747
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:57,500
That DJ Peralta is on the radio
inciting people to protest by honking.

748
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:00,912
To protest? Protest what?

749
01:32:01,048 --> 01:32:03,016
He says you're putting this
woman behind bars.

750
01:32:04,986 --> 01:32:09,150
How many people would you say?
A hundred? Three hundred?

751
01:32:09,991 --> 01:32:15,293
How many people are peacefully at
home this Saturday watching TV?

752
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:18,697
- Any idea, Chief?
- Most people.

753
01:32:20,301 --> 01:32:27,867
The ones who matter trust we'll do
what it takes to keep the peace.

754
01:32:29,043 --> 01:32:32,740
The others, the ones
who like the streets,

755
01:32:32,914 --> 01:32:36,748
Iet them go on making noise
and killing each other.

756
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:51,058
We'll have her badge. But watch the timing:
do it after I'm back in Chihuahua.

757
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:52,093
Yes, Sir.

758
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:56,633
-Keep downtown clear for me tonight.
-Yes, Sir.

759
01:32:56,904 --> 01:33:00,931
And find the connection between
Captain Bravo and this DJ...

760
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:02,440
Peralta.

761
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:07,112
And we're taking you away from here.

762
01:33:07,615 --> 01:33:12,450
I'm promoting you to Secretary of
Public Safety, in the state capital.

763
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:14,588
I'm most grateful, Mr. Governor.

764
01:33:15,523 --> 01:33:20,483
These murders are a wasp's nest.
The less we shake it up, the better.

765
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,299
Are you fast asleep?

766
01:33:30,004 --> 01:33:33,167
- Where am I?
- Take it easy.

767
01:33:33,841 --> 01:33:35,331
It's OK.

768
01:33:40,181 --> 01:33:41,842
You smell nice and fresh.

769
01:33:44,218 --> 01:33:46,311
Can I make love to you?

770
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:52,181
Let me make love to you,
then I'll let you go.

771
01:33:54,862 --> 01:33:57,831
By the Virgin, I swear I'll let you go.

772
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:02,129
I just want to make love to you.

773
01:34:27,828 --> 01:34:31,457
- I was told you could help me here.
- Yes, come in.

774
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:39,064
I'm scared to go to the cops. They get
your information and you never know.

775
01:34:40,775 --> 01:34:44,711
- When did you expect her?
- Around noon.

776
01:34:47,248 --> 01:34:51,048
But she's never late, she always calls.

777
01:34:52,586 --> 01:34:54,178
Sara will be here soon.

778
01:34:57,692 --> 01:34:59,353
Check this out.

779
01:35:01,395 --> 01:35:02,692
One more, one more.

780
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:05,961
I fold.

781
01:35:08,069 --> 01:35:12,506
- How'd it go, Oaxaca?
- Fine.

782
01:35:13,741 --> 01:35:15,936
So you gonna share your girlfriend?

783
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:24,314
- Don't be selfish, Oaxaca.
- We're gonna share her, right?

784
01:35:25,052 --> 01:35:28,681
- Wait, that wasn't the plan...
- Was there a plan, guys?

785
01:35:28,856 --> 01:35:32,189
- No, none.
- Zero plan, Oaxaca.

786
01:35:37,364 --> 01:35:40,197
- Where does he live?
- In a school bus.

787
01:35:41,202 --> 01:35:44,330
It's past Lomas de Poleo,
but I don't know where.

788
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:46,973
There aren't many abandoned
buses over there.

789
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:51,637
I never went to check it out.

790
01:35:52,346 --> 01:35:55,008
I should have gone. I'm supposed
to take care of her.

791
01:35:55,516 --> 01:35:56,949
Do you have a photo of her?

792
01:36:01,055 --> 01:36:04,752
It's the only one I have.
They took it at the factory.

793
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:17,969
Look!

794
01:36:20,674 --> 01:36:23,199
Get a good look. Go for it!

795
01:36:24,745 --> 01:36:26,269
She's great, eh?

796
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:31,176
Right this way, Oaxaca my man,
come on...

797
01:36:34,054 --> 01:36:35,487
Hang on, here.

798
01:36:41,128 --> 01:36:42,493
Take it out.

799
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:45,864
Come on.

800
01:36:51,071 --> 01:36:52,868
Look, look.

801
01:37:05,019 --> 01:37:08,921
Now, you know, you gotta do her.

802
01:37:09,190 --> 01:37:12,387
No choice, bro', got it?

803
01:37:23,070 --> 01:37:25,197
Easy motherfucker, easy now...

804
01:37:25,773 --> 01:37:27,638
Do it, do it!

805
01:37:27,775 --> 01:37:31,506
C'mon, do it, motherfucker!

806
01:37:33,714 --> 01:37:36,012
Put it all the way on, shit.

807
01:39:16,116 --> 01:39:17,640
Sir, a couple of questions...

808
01:39:19,253 --> 01:39:23,349
- Are you changing the police force?
- We're starting an investigation,

809
01:39:23,524 --> 01:39:27,153
and steps will be taken by the book.

810
01:39:27,394 --> 01:39:29,021
What's that in plain Spanish?

811
01:39:29,196 --> 01:39:34,031
Ask me about the economy.
I'm here to talk to investors.

812
01:39:34,201 --> 01:39:41,437
When will the killing stop?
The media focus on these murders...

813
01:39:41,575 --> 01:39:45,807
- is ruining tourism in Juárez.
- What tourism?

814
01:39:45,946 --> 01:39:48,779
It's unfair that whenever
you talk about Juárez,

815
01:39:48,916 --> 01:39:52,352
people ask themselves:
Juárez? The dead women?

816
01:39:52,519 --> 01:39:57,218
And you reporters don't stress that
there's a lot of good things going on.

817
01:39:57,391 --> 01:39:59,382
What about the term "femicide"?

818
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:02,222
They should use that term
around the world,

819
01:40:02,396 --> 01:40:06,799
not just in Juárez.
Just cross the border.

820
01:40:06,934 --> 01:40:09,994
On the road to Houston. They've got
their murdered women, too.

821
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:11,797
That's your response...?

822
01:40:15,175 --> 01:40:19,407
Let's welcome the Governor
of the State of Chihuahua.

823
01:40:21,582 --> 01:40:24,210
- Mr. Álvarez...
- How are you, Governor?

824
01:40:25,719 --> 01:40:28,711
- Welcome, Sir!
- Thanks very much.

825
01:40:52,212 --> 01:40:54,646
- That's him?
- Yes.

826
01:40:56,450 --> 01:40:57,712
Go!

827
01:41:04,258 --> 01:41:05,657
Where's your girlfriend?

828
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:10,697
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

829
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:12,229
Where is she?

830
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:15,796
- They kidnapped both of us.
- I don't believe you. Where is she?

831
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:22,569
The next one goes in your head.
Where is she?

832
01:41:25,712 --> 01:41:29,910
- Answer me!
- I don't know.

833
01:42:10,757 --> 01:42:13,225
It can't be!

834
01:42:16,597 --> 01:42:20,829
My heaRT bleeds for you.

835
01:42:36,583 --> 01:42:38,278
The Chief wants a word.

836
01:42:56,603 --> 01:42:59,629
Always too little, too late.

837
01:43:02,509 --> 01:43:07,037
The Governor wants to know
your relationship to Peralta.

838
01:43:08,382 --> 01:43:14,878
What for? So he knows whether to
take my badge or charge me?

839
01:43:15,889 --> 01:43:18,483
I don't know what they're
going to decide.

840
01:43:21,495 --> 01:43:25,022
- Peralta is my best friend.
- Well now.

841
01:43:27,901 --> 01:43:31,997
And if I'm charged with anything,
or my badge is taken,

842
01:43:32,739 --> 01:43:36,539
as a civilian, I can tell him all
I know about the Juárez police.

843
01:43:39,179 --> 01:43:40,840
Gotcha.

844
01:43:42,216 --> 01:43:46,846
I'll send your message upstairs.
Get some sleep.

845
01:43:48,188 --> 01:43:50,088
You haven't slept in two days, right?

846
01:43:51,558 --> 01:43:53,719
Fierro, we got things to do.

847
01:43:58,098 --> 01:43:59,690
You bet, Chief!

848
01:45:33,593 --> 01:45:35,151
What's up?

849
01:45:37,297 --> 01:45:38,889
See you.

850
01:45:44,037 --> 01:45:47,905
Fifty-fifty. That's how it's
gonna be with all our clients.

851
01:45:48,442 --> 01:45:50,535
As long as you're Chief and I'm alive.

852
01:45:51,945 --> 01:45:55,210
- And what's the deal with our...?
- Clients?

853
01:45:56,616 --> 01:45:58,049
Yeah.

854
01:46:04,124 --> 01:46:08,151
You put anything client-related
on hold and notify them.

855
01:46:20,907 --> 01:46:23,239
Sometimes they want information.

856
01:46:24,010 --> 01:46:27,673
This crazy bastard Santos,
for example. Check it out.

857
01:46:28,949 --> 01:46:33,147
Silver Fox to Night Czar.

858
01:46:33,387 --> 01:46:35,378
Sir, it's for you.

859
01:46:41,495 --> 01:46:45,454
- Did you like it?
- Absolutely, you're most kind.

860
01:46:46,633 --> 01:46:48,726
Any news?

861
01:46:50,170 --> 01:46:54,402
You're good to go. Have a nice evening.

862
01:48:25,065 --> 01:48:29,968
Hey, little dove. Where do you live?

863
01:48:30,136 --> 01:48:34,334
- Close by.
- Close, like 10 minutes or 20?

864
01:48:35,542 --> 01:48:37,874
- I'm almost there.
- Wanna ride?

865
01:48:38,044 --> 01:48:39,443
No thanks.

866
01:48:45,385 --> 01:48:47,216
I'll take you, little dove.

867
01:49:44,711 --> 01:49:47,839
Get out of the car!

868
01:49:48,214 --> 01:49:49,408
Get out!

869
01:49:51,384 --> 01:49:52,476
Let her go!

870
01:49:59,726 --> 01:50:01,557
You let her go!

871
01:50:02,562 --> 01:50:04,530
Get in the car!

872
01:50:08,001 --> 01:50:10,162
She's more scared of the cops than me.

873
01:50:13,073 --> 01:50:14,734
On the other hand,

874
01:50:19,446 --> 01:50:20,777
I turn myself in...

875
01:50:20,947 --> 01:50:29,082
... knowing that I'll get a fair deal
from the authorities, a fair trail...

876
01:50:30,557 --> 01:50:32,718
and a fair sentence.

877
01:50:35,395 --> 01:50:37,363
So what do I do, Cop?

878
01:50:38,698 --> 01:50:41,064
Which way? Here? There?

879
01:50:43,770 --> 01:50:45,260
Hands up!

880
01:50:48,241 --> 01:50:50,004
Get 'em up!

881
01:51:35,789 --> 01:51:41,853
A score settled between drug dealers,
or so the police bulletin says,

882
01:51:42,595 --> 01:51:46,759
although that would be a
first for Mickey Santos.

883
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:52,062
Anyway, he was found dead a week ago,

884
01:51:52,238 --> 01:51:56,937
and here in Juárez, the one
thing that's certain is Death.

885
01:51:57,811 --> 01:52:02,009
Well, on a somewhat lighter note:

886
01:52:02,682 --> 01:52:07,176
Earlier today, Kikay, a Toyota subsidiary,

887
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:10,548
moved out of the Juárez Industrial Park.

888
01:52:10,724 --> 01:52:15,093
How about that? The good thing
about being a transnational...

889
01:52:15,562 --> 01:52:20,659
when things get ugly, you vacate
the premises and ciaooo!

890
01:52:20,867 --> 01:52:22,892
You're off to the other side
of the world to find...

891
01:52:23,069 --> 01:52:28,371
the same cheap labor,
the same cheap proletariat.

892
01:52:30,043 --> 01:52:36,346
OK, back to crime:
excavation continued today

893
01:52:36,483 --> 01:52:39,850
at the clandestine grave
found just three days ago

894
01:52:40,019 --> 01:52:43,250
right there a top Lomas de Poleo.

895
01:52:44,457 --> 01:52:49,656
It comes as no surprise that next to nothing
is known about how, when or who...

896
01:52:49,796 --> 01:52:55,666
found the site, not to mention
the when or why of this gra ve

897
01:52:55,802 --> 01:53:01,206
... from which women's bodies
are still being removed.

898
01:53:01,374 --> 01:53:03,501
"Stop the killing! Stop the killing!"

899
01:53:04,177 --> 01:53:08,136
Predictably, some journalists showed up,

900
01:53:08,314 --> 01:53:11,841
and just as predictably,
the Mothers in Mourning.

901
01:53:12,018 --> 01:53:17,320
You know the ones; women related
to murdered or missing women.

902
01:53:18,424 --> 01:53:22,758
Likewise, our brand-new Chief
of Police made an appearance.

903
01:53:24,063 --> 01:53:27,157
The guy who ever since his appointment,

904
01:53:27,333 --> 01:53:31,292
in a sinister way, looks more
and more like the old Chief.

905
01:53:32,539 --> 01:53:35,997
All right then. Good morning, Juárez!

906
01:53:36,576 --> 01:53:42,674
And with these latest deaths, the
number of murders has risen to...

907
01:53:48,454 --> 01:53:50,183
With these latest deaths...

908
01:53:51,891 --> 01:53:56,453
the number of murdered women has
risen to the unbelievable total of....

909
01:54:01,801 --> 01:54:06,500
To Captain Blanca Bravo,
relieved of her position...

910
01:54:08,208 --> 01:54:13,510
...since we may never meet again,
this is goodbye.

911
01:54:15,982 --> 01:54:19,850
Juárez must not die.

912
01:54:34,701 --> 01:54:44,303
Women killed in sex crimes

913
01:55:22,015 --> 01:55:25,781
Women killed in sex crimes

914
01:55:26,085 --> 01:55:30,613
Women missing

915
01:55:46,039 --> 01:56:14,255
Women killed in sex crimes

916
01:56:14,256 --> 01:56:21,156
Ripped by zombino
