1
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:41,459
Parnell: I wish my head could
forget what my eyes have seen

2
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,630
in 32 years of firefighting.

3
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,853
Interviewer: Why do you do this?

4
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:53,519
Miller: We love...

5
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,556
I love my job.

6
00:00:56,306 --> 00:01:02,234
It does... it's something
with adrenaline

7
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,781
that gets you pumped up (alarm).

8
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:06,654
And here we go!

9
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,342
Woman: (screams).

10
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,627
Woman: Got to regroup, keep it
moving, that's the best I can do.

11
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:02,353
Craig: That right there times
30 a night, times 30 years,

12
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:10,863
is how you burn a city
down... one at a time.

13
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,417
Man: It was probably the most
beautiful city back in the day,

14
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,379
you know, when there was
factories everywhere,

15
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,259
there was people spending
money around here.

16
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,590
The car industry was booming.

17
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,719
Man: It was much easier
to get a job and it was more

18
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,550
of a family atmosphere then.

19
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,477
You didn't have to lock your doors.

20
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,018
Man: I grew up in Detroit.

21
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,065
I've seen the City change from
a nice, decent neighborhood

22
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:51,649
to certain areas that just
look like bombs have hit them.

23
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,656
Man: Most of the neighborhoods
are blighted, vacant lots.

24
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,412
Next to vacant dwellings.

25
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:06,713
Parnell: We've got probably
one, two, three, four...

26
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:13,383
six, seven, eight vacants
on my block.

27
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,841
Dennis: It kind of hurts me to see
the City getting destroyed like this,

28
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,393
I feel like I'm in the
burning of Rome sometime.

29
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:33,448
Man: Population loss, I've
watched it go from a city

30
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,698
of one-point-eight million
to seven-hundred thousand,

31
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,621
leaves a lot of vacant homes.

32
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:48,127
Man: The bottom line is everybody
that can seems to be ﬂeeing.

33
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:54,545
Man: I mean, this has been
Katrina without the hurricane.

34
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,630
Woman: Our city is
crumbling around us.

35
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,261
Man: Imagine two-thirds of the
people in your city disappeared,

36
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,518
but they left their houses,
their garbage, their furniture.

37
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,224
Doogie: As long as
there's people leaving,

38
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,357
as long as there's vacant
houses, there's going to be fires,

39
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:15,032
it's called fire load,
there's more things to burn.

40
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:18,201
Man: The neighborhood of our
district is, statistically,

41
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,781
one of the worst places on
earth for crime, for poverty.

42
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,661
Man: So they were shooting, too?

43
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,115
Man: Came out right here.

44
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,497
Woman: And the other
one was right there.

45
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,871
Man: High murder rate,
high infant mortality rate.

46
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,801
Reporter: Police telling me this is
not just a murder, but an execution.

47
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,800
Man: Crimes that you never
would, in a million years,

48
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,633
thought would happen
in your neighborhood.

49
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,937
Woman: In the City of
Detroit last year alone,

50
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,816
we had over 30,000 actual fire calls.

51
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,657
I mean, we're in trouble,
we need help.

52
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,060
Parnell: This don't have
nothing to do with the City,

53
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,641
this is must my own
personal edge (alarm).

54
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:40,489
My name is David
Parnell, I'm a FEO,

55
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,910
Field Engine Operator,
for Engine Company 50.

56
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,740
Craig: Dave Parnell and I
were hired about the same time,

57
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,498
1977, great guy, solid guy.

58
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,920
You feel safe when
he's behind the wheel.

59
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:58,878
He'll get you water within 60
seconds of being on the fire drop.

60
00:06:59,461 --> 00:06:59,552
Parnell:That's my part.

61
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,300
That's what I do.

62
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,974
Craig:The soul, if you
will, of the firehouse.

63
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,643
He's pretty well loved and
respected by everybody here.

64
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,219
Chris: Dave is old (laughs).

65
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,979
He has to retire.

66
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:10,976
Man: He's like Papa Bear.

67
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,934
He's in there, we catch him
nodding off in there a little bit.

68
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,521
Man: He's watching an old
Western, black and white.

69
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,151
It's okay, he's earned it.

70
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,534
Miller: Sometimes, I
just need a little Parnell.

71
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,944
Parnell: What is a man's worth

72
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,330
that doesn't make the
world a better place?

73
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:31,126
What's a gang besides a
family looking for a home?

74
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,002
Think about it.

75
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,672
Jeff: My favorite
one is when he says,

76
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,749
"I wish my mind could forget
what my eyes have seen..."

77
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,209
Parnell: Could forget
what my eyes have seen.

78
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,295
Miller: We call it
bullshit (laughter).

79
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,462
Craig: Yeah!

80
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:43,220
(laughter).

81
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,427
Man: But it is comforting.

82
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:45,006
Man: It is totally comforting.

83
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,263
Man: Well, never get that from Dan.

84
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,638
Dave: Come on Dave,
I need some bullshit.

85
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,267
Man: You're going to get
some bullshit from Parnell.

86
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,307
Parnell: You know, I've
been here so long, you know,

87
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,814
you feel like a fixture,
thirty-three years.

88
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,688
Yeah, thirty-three
years of firefighting,

89
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:05,660
I have eight months left, and
then I'll retire, I'll be 60.

90
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,450
Interviewer: Are you ready to go?

91
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,662
Parnell: Absolutely...
no, not at all.

92
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,752
This is my neighborhood,
this is where I live,

93
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,457
this is where I fight my fires.

94
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,211
You used to could walk
in this neighborhood.

95
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:26,640
Well, now, you're pretty much
afraid to walk to the corner.

96
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:27,886
This is where some

97
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:32,096
of the firefighters lived
and grew up, right here.

98
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:38,106
And now look at it, that
was a fire job right there,

99
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,313
you can tell by the soot that
was in the front of the dwelling.

100
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,065
We've been to that
apartment building over there,

101
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,199
at least a half-a-dozen
times that I know of.

102
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,777
We actually saved a young
man out of this one, 18011,

103
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:48,319
actually saved a young man

104
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:49,995
out of that one.

105
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:55,043
When you look around the City,
you look at the burnt-out homes.

106
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:59,919
That's when you get this
attitude, "This is no good."

107
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,503
And I don't understand it, I'm
not going to understand it.

108
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:10,058
If you live in the community in which
you work, how do you not do something

109
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,976
for the people that are around you?

110
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,601
You have an opportunity
to make change.

111
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,438
Dispatcher: Report
of a growing fire...

112
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,365
Man: Ninety-five percent
of what I do is arson.

113
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,740
Very rarely do we have
a legitimate fire (siren).

114
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:37,665
Woman:The building's on fire!

115
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,336
We can't get out!

116
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,799
Man: Somebody went in
through the back door,

117
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,505
went upstairs, and
they lit the place.

118
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:49,048
Man:You go up stairs you can smell
some kind of accelerant or something.

119
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,183
Lewis: I can't picture
another city that's like this

120
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,265
where so many of the fires are arson.

121
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:06,027
It's beyond me why people would
want to burn their own city down.

122
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,823
Craig:There's arson for profit.

123
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,075
There's arson for revenge.

124
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,870
And then there's just
arson for kicks.

125
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,741
Man: It used to infuriate me that
this was going on night after night,

126
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,160
and nobody, nobody seemed to care.

127
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,005
But I mean, we're doing this
for the people that are left,

128
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,672
and for the houses are occupied.

129
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,592
You got to be tough.

130
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,639
Man: The exhaustion
can be depressing.

131
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:36,220
Man: To blow off steam,
you probably have ten methods

132
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:37,975
for every individual, you know?

133
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,305
Jeff: We'll clean it.

134
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:40,848
Man: Whoa!

135
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,393
Tony: Weird pink nursing home.

136
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:44,352
Man: Nice.

137
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,236
Man: Ohhhh.

138
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:47,985
Man: Holy cow!

139
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:48,940
Man: Whoo!

140
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:49,653
Craig: Yeah, the DFD swagger.

141
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,280
I mean, we're above the law.

142
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,867
Detroit firemen think they
can do whatever they want.

143
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,121
Cowboys in a big rodeo (alarm).

144
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,395
Man: We do things a little
differently, rigs pull up.

145
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,195
Man: Oh, it's in the basement.

146
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,991
Man: Guys go right in, we
advance to the heart of the fire.

147
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,663
Parnell: Other guys are fighting
fires, you see water shooting in,

148
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,616
we fight fires, you'll
see water shooting out.

149
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,827
Whoa!You got me!

150
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,580
Parnell: Detroit puts the
fires out from the inside out.

151
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,044
Plain and simple.

152
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,844
Dennis: When we go on a
fire, we're kind of hyped up.

153
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:51,798
We're like, "Let's go!"

154
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,260
"Ah!" You know, you're tackling this
thing like it's some type of dragon.

155
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,217
And we don't really lose too often.

156
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,093
Man: Hot as fucking shit!

157
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,599
Man: We have people that come from
across country, around the world

158
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,230
to just watch us fight fire.

159
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,895
Man: Well, I don't know
if I should say that,

160
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,856
but we fight fires with balls.

161
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,531
That's (laughs)...

162
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:15,868
Man: It's the best
boys' club in the world!

163
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,287
We get paid to be here.

164
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,957
Miller: I like coming to
work., I look forward to it.

165
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,959
I think you'll hear that
from most of the guys,

166
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,125
ask anyone in the private sector,
and you'll probably hear differently.

167
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,172
Man: This job is fun!

168
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,126
You get to turn the
lights on, the siren on,

169
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:32,923
you get to run through red lights.

170
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,382
Let's

171
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:38,808
Man: We actually live together 24
hours, since there's a closeness,

172
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,887
the trust factor is there.

173
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,472
Jeff: The busier you
are, the more you bond.

174
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,309
We're tight, it's a brotherhood,
that's just how we roll.

175
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:51,522
Man: That's the team that we
have, the family that we have,

176
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,073
the trust that we have
for one another.

177
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,027
Doogie: Most firemen
are social creatures,

178
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,663
we like to hang out,
we like to enjoy life.

179
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,329
A lot of times people
compare being a fireman

180
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,209
to being a member of a social club.

181
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,121
They might be onto something.

182
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,042
Miller: Brendan Milewski,
who was a trial man here,

183
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,423
he was probably the
youngest guy to be here,

184
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,756
come 20-years-old, or 18-years-old.

185
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,215
Man: Nineteen, something
like that, he come on, yeah.

186
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,595
Miller: Fresh-faced kid.

187
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,011
I don't think he ever made a
bed himself when he got here.

188
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,854
Jeff: My buddy, Doogie.

189
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:29,772
Silly picture of us back in
probably 2000 at HarleyFest.

190
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,944
Doogie: I got on the job
when I was 20-years-old.

191
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:39,069
After 11 years, I was
content, I was happy.

192
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:44,621
It was August, I'd been off
for like seven or nine days.

193
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,496
I had a nice stretch of
days off, so I was excited

194
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,328
to go back to work, see the guys.

195
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,622
I got there a little
after seven o'clock.

196
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,714
And before I could come in and say
hello, and see what we had going

197
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,638
on for that day, the alert went
off and we got the run (sirens).

198
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,142
Doogie: Once we got rolling,
and turned down Dickerson,

199
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:14,696
and saw this huge towering
column of smoke,

200
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,147
you knew it was just
not the way you wanted

201
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:17,857
to start your Friday, the 13th.

202
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,198
I mean, I'm no Nostradamus
or anything,

203
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:22,825
but I just had a bad feeling.

204
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,492
Soon as I saw it, I
just had a bad feeling.

205
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:32,206
Me and a couple other
guys were ventilating,

206
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,462
we were taking the plywood off
all the second story windows

207
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,762
so the water tower could get
water in through the second ﬂoor.

208
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:43,012
The bricks up there looked a little
suspect, and as we were working,

209
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,843
I remember hearing somebody shout.

210
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,887
The bricks in front of me, the facade

211
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,348
of the building were
cascading like a waterfall.

212
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:54,311
I mean, I saw it coming
and I made a run for it.

213
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,522
Dispatcher: Chief 6 to
Central, send EMSes immediately,

214
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,983
we've had a building
collapse,fireman down.

215
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:08,208
Lewis: I saw him running and
he was less than ten feet from me

216
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:14,168
when the wall caught him,
I could see his face.

217
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,964
Dispatcher: Central, this
is Engine 30 (inaudible),

218
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,884
Multiple EMS, multiple firemen down.

219
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,302
Lewis: Hm, I can
still see it... plain.

220
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:31,606
Doogie: And I went to go push
myself up off the concrete,

221
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,981
do a push-up and slide my knees
in and walk away, and when I did

222
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,780
that push-up, the only thing
that moved were my shoulders.

223
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,781
Dispatcher: Central,
we need everybody here,

224
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,743
we've got freaking firemen
down, the roof has collapsed,

225
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,070
we need everybody here now!

226
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,123
Lewis: They were hurt pretty bad,
they were buried in the bricks.

227
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,877
I think it was about four minutes,
we had them all out on backboards.

228
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,582
Called for a second alarm instantly.

229
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,918
Dispatcher: Chief 6 to Central,
give me a second alarm (sirens).

230
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:00,755
Man: Stop!

231
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,889
Fuckin' brake, goddammit!

232
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,358
Doogie: I was angry.

233
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:26,653
I was pissed off that
this had happened.

234
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,452
I remember there was
chaos going on around me,

235
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,708
but just (voice cracks)
inside I was so calm.

236
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,503
Lewis: One of the
things that I wanted

237
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,888
to do afterwards was make sure
we washed all of the blood

238
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:52,642
out of the street, there was
so much blood in the street.

239
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,577
Doogie:Things could have been
done differently on August 13th

240
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,657
that wouldn't have resulted in this.

241
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,915
We could have did a complete surround
and drown defensive operation,

242
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,371
that would change things
dramatically.

243
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,502
I'd still be walking
if we had done that.

244
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:25,462
There's definitely things that
could have been done differently.

245
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,863
Dennis:When we go into to
houses, it's a whole 'nother thing

246
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,158
from what you see on the news from
us standing outside with a hose.

247
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:57,543
Parnell: Close your eyes,
feel heat all around you.

248
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,126
Do not have no clue as to
where you going, and then say,

249
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:05,756
"Okay, I got to fight this."

250
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:07,966
That's fear.

251
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:17,355
Man: There's some buildings that
you come out of, and you realize

252
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:23,733
that the structure is
designed to kill firemen.

253
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:24,938
Man: We've had stairways collapse.

254
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,194
We've had bathtubs fall
from the second ﬂoor

255
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,951
onto the first ﬂoor,
hit the guys below.

256
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,915
Man: People have weights in
their rooms, they have waterbeds

257
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,246
in their rooms, they have weapons,
there could be anything up there.

258
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,207
Man: (yelling).

259
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,918
Man: We have a record amount
of guys injured right now

260
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,630
and we have had for the last
four or five years (sirens).

261
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,393
Man: I don't know if I'm more
afraid of death or crippling injury.

262
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,647
Chris: Out of 17 years, I've been
in the hospital 15 of those years.

263
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:05,694
I had a second ﬂoor bathtub
fall on top of me, a concussion,

264
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,397
partially dislocated my
hips, messed my back up.

265
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,656
Dave: An air-conditioning unit from
the roof, collapsed through the roof,

266
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,908
took my helmet and my mask with it.

267
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,287
Man:You just never really
know what you're walking into.

268
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,300
Man: Until you put your life up
as collateral for another life,

269
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:34,849
you don't know what
life-saving is about.

270
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,306
Man: lt'sjust a miracle
that more guys aren't hurt

271
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,308
or killed on this job.

272
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,675
Jeff: Middle of the night last
night our bell system stopped working

273
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,303
to notify us that we're
getting a run.

274
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,977
So it's a holiday, and we
figured we'd take a stab

275
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,770
at fixing it ourselves.

276
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,440
We haven't resorted
to the pots and pans

277
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,564
like we used to do in the old days.

278
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:32,240
Cross your fingers and hope
for a bell (bell rings).

279
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,024
Yeah! Whoo!

280
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,658
We'll probably get taken down
on charges for doing this.

281
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:35,780
Man: Well, no one saw us do it.

282
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,828
Craig: Yeah, the biggest challenge

283
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:42,284
about being a Captain here is you
want to take care of the guys,

284
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,040
you want to take care of the rig, you
want to take care of your building,

285
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,122
and you look around here,
you got broken windows

286
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,708
that you've been trying to
get repaired for four years.

287
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,721
You have rigs that are leaking,
and nobody has the parts to fix.

288
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,672
You know, you go down
to the repair shop

289
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,883
for your fire coat, and
they don't have any.

290
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,097
Gloves, boots.

291
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,266
Man: They were leaking.

292
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,516
It's ripped right in the top
here, big chunk out of 'em...

293
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,692
rubber, you could see the steal,
figured I'd duct tape it up,

294
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,110
and it seems like it's
working, right?

295
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,107
(laughs).

296
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,114
Man: Squad 6 leaks oil
like you wouldn't believe.

297
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,776
You can see it down here.

298
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,991
You know? (Laughs) I mean,
these rigs are held together

299
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,665
with bubble gum and tape (siren).

300
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:27,457
Man: What was it?

301
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,256
Man: I think it was
the airbag or inner tire.

302
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,837
Dennis: We're wearing
this stuff out.

303
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,715
You know,just like the rigs,
you know, our stuff is worn out,

304
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,093
because we're actually
doing something,

305
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,889
we're working all the time, so.

306
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,100
Craig:You know, that's just
something that comes with the job.

307
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,600
It's been this way for so long,
and you just get frustrated.

308
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,227
You look at the big picture,

309
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:51,361
and there's just nothing
you can do about it.

310
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,872
Reporter: Flames ripped
through an open warehouse,

311
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,877
destroying several businesses inside.

312
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,130
Now, firefighters explain
why they couldn't seem

313
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:16,627
to get a hand on that fire.

314
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:19,464
Man: Well, we get there
without the tools we need.

315
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,048
There's not much we can do.

316
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,304
Reporter: Firefighters doing all
they can, but stretched to the limit.

317
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:24,100
Woman: It looks like a war zone,

318
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:25,143
the whole block is just
gone, it's just gone.

319
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,265
Reporter: When it comes
to public safety in Detroit,

320
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:27,017
we're robbing Peter to pay Paul.

321
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,267
Reporter: At least five
of the City's 21 rigs were

322
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,270
out of commission in
the past few days.

323
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,451
Man: Nothing but problems.

324
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,330
It's dangerous, it's scary
and one of these days,

325
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:49,876
we're going to get trapped.

326
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,833
Man: It's gonna take
somebody getting killed.

327
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:56,001
Reporter: Dozens of homes up in
ﬂames, all in a matter of hours,

328
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:57,961
downed power lines, strong winds,

329
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:02,424
and at least one suspected arsonist
stretched Detroit's Fire Department

330
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:03,803
like never before.

331
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,353
Reporter: Eighty-five blazes in
total with the entire fire department

332
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,056
on the streets, battling the ﬂames.

333
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:16,733
Man: Oh, what the fuck!

334
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,152
Reporter: The Mayor
says, "Enough is enough!"

335
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:27,665
And he fires the City's Fire
Commissioner, and his right-hand man.

336
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,288
Reporter: Tonight a Fox 2
exclusive, answering the call

337
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,829
for help for the men and women
of the Detroit Fire Department.

338
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,918
Reporter: Tonight a look
at who's now in charge

339
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,923
of some much needed changes.

340
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,842
Reporter: Having
worked for 30 years

341
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,343
in the Los Angeles Fire Department,

342
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,470
Donald Austin knows all too well the
problems facing Detroit's embattled

343
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,767
fire department and EMS system.

344
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,517
Donald: Show me an organization
that says they can't improve,

345
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,730
and I willjoin you in watching
that organization become obsolete.

346
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,687
Donald:The leadership has
been challenged for a whole bunch

347
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,989
of reasons but I plan on
bringing a whole new perspective.

348
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,444
Donald: May I share the
table with you ladies?

349
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:07,075
I'm Don Austin, Don
Austin, Don Austin.

350
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:08,781
Man: Fire commissioner, we
need to know who he is, right?

351
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:09,490
Donald: All right!

352
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:13,874
Well, here I am... and I'm the fire
commissioner that's come again, yeah.

353
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,457
Woman: I saw you on TV when
you first came on board, yeah.

354
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,759
Donald: Oh, okay, I'm
committed and invested.

355
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:24,714
So what do you guys want and
need from the fire department?

356
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,674
Woman: We don't need any those...

357
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,805
Craig: Our new commissioner's
from California,

358
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:32,935
so we have an LA commissioner,
Hollywood, I don't know,

359
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:36,643
Hollywood commissioner, we
just don't know what to expect.

360
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:45,027
Man: (drums) Honor
guard, forward, March!

361
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:51,412
(band playing)

362
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,710
Craig: In the 30-plus years, how
many mayors, how many commissioners,

363
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,458
how many chiefs of the
department have there been?

364
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,506
They're going to be gone
two or three years from now.

365
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,460
They're one election cycle away
from you not seeing them again.

366
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,345
Man: I'd like to welcome everyone

367
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,841
to our Detroit Fireman's Memorial
Day service, Ladies and gentlemen,

368
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:11,553
our newly appointed Executive
Fire Commissioner, Donald Austin.

369
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,305
Donald: I'm happy
to be here in Detroit,

370
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:19,568
and want to continue the fine
tradition of the men and women

371
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:24,274
of the Los Angeles Fire Department,
correction, I knew I was going

372
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,200
to do that, (laughter) I apologize,

373
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:30,033
The Detroit Fire Department
(band plays Amazing Grace).

374
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,850
Chris: I remember when I told
my dad I wanted to be a fireman,

375
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:55,179
and he said, "Not in this city."

376
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,015
Ten years later, look where I'm at.

377
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:01,527
Tony: When I was a kid, my father
was a fireman, and I always wanted

378
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,196
to be a fireman, he was
proud of me when I signed up.

379
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:08,777
Jeff: Family on the job,
it's just rich tradition.

380
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,954
A lot of peoplejust fall into line
like that, uncles, brothers, fathers,

381
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,249
sons, can't explain
why, it just happens.

382
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,336
Miller: Most of the
guys around here,

383
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,289
their dad's ran here at some point.

384
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,249
I've seen stuff my dad wrote in.

385
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:28,838
Matter of fact, 1979, I think
my dad just made Sergeant here.

386
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:36,020
I was 17 when my father died
(clears throat) from cancer,

387
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,565
possibly complications from a fire.

388
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:45,230
When he was sick, the fire
department stepped up.

389
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,823
The camaraderie came into play.

390
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,820
I don't think there
was a day that went

391
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,328
by that there wasn't a fire
truck in front of my house.

392
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:56,499
At 17, that had an impact on me.

393
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,887
Chris: Yeah, I guess they
say, "Firemen die young."

394
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,720
I plan on not being one of those.

395
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:19,646
Child: I love you.

396
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,853
Chris: It seems like
the guys that stay to 60,

397
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:23,734
they stay till 60, and boom!

398
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:24,852
It's like, wow!

399
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:25,895
That guy just retired!

400
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:26,732
Good job.

401
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,188
Child:Yeah!

402
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:29,155
Dave: Jake!

403
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:33,569
That's the Jakester, you want
me to get farther away from you.

404
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,325
Gloria: Mm hm.

405
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,121
Parnell: That's my wife, Gloria.

406
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,658
That's my girlfriend (laughs).

407
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:45,374
Yeah. Wife, girlfriend, lover, all
of the above for the last 35 years.

408
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,751
Yeah, so I've almost gotten
to know her a little bit

409
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,961
and she's always dressed
me all these years.

410
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:55,721
You know, I guess I looked okay
most of the time, but people look

411
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,426
at me now and they say, "Wow!"

412
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:02,607
Was Gloria not home when you left?"

413
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:05,981
(laughs). I met my wife before
I was ever out of high school.

414
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,406
I got out the Marine Corp, she said,
"You got one date, that's it, buddy."

415
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,283
We've been dating ever since.

416
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:18,994
She's put up with me
for over 30 yea rs,

417
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:23,286
so it's time to just do
what she wants to do.

418
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,746
Originally, we had planned
to move to Tennessee,

419
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:31,131
but it's totally different
now, because of her situation.

420
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,636
Yea h, hey, sweetie
(kissy sound) Love you.

421
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:34,384
All right, see you.

422
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:35,759
Gloria: Scoot!

423
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:36,966
Parnell: See ya.

424
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,267
She went in for a simple
appendectomy,

425
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,893
contracted Guillain-Barre, and
they said if it doesn't kill you,

426
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,690
you'll make a full recovery.

427
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:50,029
I'm waiting for the full recovery.

428
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,195
Miller: This is the empty engine
bay at Engine 50's quarters.

429
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,783
They've taken our rig and placed
it at Engine 58's quarters,

430
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,869
because both of their rigs, the squad

431
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,045
and the engine are
broken down at the shop.

432
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:11,251
Chris:Yeah, we're at Engine 58's
quarters, which is at Lake Point

433
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,302
and Whittier, which is about
two miles from 50's quarters.

434
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,220
Detailed here today.

435
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,722
Riding 50's rig.

436
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,388
Man: The next step,
what we've heard,

437
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:24,351
the rumor is that the TAC is going
to come to Engine 50's quarters.

438
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,275
The TAC is a small
truck with a tank on it,

439
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,445
it's just for transportation
purposes only for manpower.

440
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,906
Miller: It'd be nice if we
had some kind of a back-up plan

441
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,326
when things break, you know,
I suspect there are a lot

442
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,324
of other rigs that
are about to break.

443
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,114
Chris: Been lucky so far.

444
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:47,123
I mean, you got a... you don't
want to imagine what could happen,

445
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,872
it's like playing with fire.

446
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:09,603
Man: Got that?

447
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,776
Dennis: Yeah.

448
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,735
Man: All right.

449
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,410
Man: The whole fucking
house is rolling!

450
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:25,915
Man: Yeah, yeah, it's done.

451
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:33,881
Woman: Come on!

452
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,676
Man: Yeah, over here.

453
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,265
Man: That's every
fucking thing I got!

454
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:44,593
Man: Move over.

455
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,479
Man: Man, this motherfucker's
rolling!

456
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:48,938
Look at that black-ass smoke!

457
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,309
Man:That's every
fucking thing I got!!

458
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:53,731
Woman: I know... I know.

459
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,110
Woman: It's gonna be okay.

460
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:10,332
Doogie: Any retiree will tell
you that when they come back

461
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:14,961
to the firehouse, even if it's just
for a visit, it's just not the same,

462
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:21,047
when you're removed from it, life
goes on, the firehouse goes on.

463
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:46,454
Thank you, honey.

464
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,577
Angie:That's Doogie
right there in that one.

465
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,083
And this is probably my
favorite one right here

466
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,716
with all the ax and all the smoke.

467
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,222
He almost looks like a ghost.

468
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:09,144
I think it's kind of cool, but it's
scary at the same time how kind

469
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,063
of after the fact that
something happens.

470
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:12,730
You know what I mean?

471
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,980
I always thought he was
kind of like invincible.

472
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,436
When I see these pictures.

473
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:21,322
I was 19 when we Brendan met.

474
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,946
I cut Brendan's hair.

475
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:28,489
Doogie: I was an absolute
busy body before this happened.

476
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,245
When I cut loose,I
like to cut loose.

477
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,661
Angie: We traveled a lot together.

478
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:35,746
Cabo San Lucas, in Mexico.

479
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:36,500
Doogie: Motorcycles.

480
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,672
Angie: Bahamas.

481
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:38,164
Doogie: Playing hockey.

482
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,499
Angie: Saint Lucia.

483
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,464
Doogie: I've been
snowboarding for 23 years.

484
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:45,005
You know, we'd go up north, get
a nice cabin for three/four days

485
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,011
at a time, it was a big deal for us.

486
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:48,262
Nice job, baby.

487
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:55,600
To not have that anymore, it
really uh... it really sucks.

488
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:11,040
The neurosurgeon's opinion
is that most recovery,

489
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,959
most of what you're going to
get back will take a good six

490
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:14,497
to eighteen months.

491
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:18,330
That, for me, right now is like
that's where my blinders are,

492
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:19,961
that six to eighteen months.

493
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,543
Therapist: Keep going,
keep going, keep going.

494
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:23,384
Pull yourself up.

495
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,051
Doogie: Hold on.

496
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:24,677
I got it.

497
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:25,302
Therapist: Yeah!

498
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:32,892
I wasn't going to help you (laughs)
C'mon, pull, pull, pull, much better.

499
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,815
Doogie: Emotionally, physically,
I mean, every day is a battle,

500
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:43,193
when you wake up, there's that split
second between opening your eyes,

501
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,566
and remembering that
you're paralyzed.

502
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:51,701
It's just kind of like...
(big sigh), "Alright",

503
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:55,705
alright, let's get things going."

504
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:57,619
Therapist: Take deep breaths.

505
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,334
Doogie: It's a rough
way to start the day.

506
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,968
Jeff: Took us a while
to break Doogie in.

507
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,298
He was just the way we like him,
nobody could swear more cutting

508
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,430
in a pipe ﬂashing, this is
Doogie's enemy right here (laughs).

509
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:17,230
It'djust make you laugh, I'd give
anything to get him back here.

510
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:23,404
This isn't the easiest work,
but it's what we do, you know,

511
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:24,901
it pays a few extra bills,

512
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,940
because everybody knows
they don't pay you enough

513
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,358
to run into burning buildings.

514
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:30,698
Craig: The starting salary

515
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:34,115
of a Detroit Firefighter is
right around $30,000 a year.

516
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:37,201
Miller: I'd leave that wall alone.

517
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,535
Dennis: Same thing?

518
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,750
Man: Same thing, yeah.

519
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:41,420
Just a little...

520
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,872
Craig: So most firefighters
have a second job.

521
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:47,506
Because that just isn't enough
money today to feed your family.

522
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,258
Interviewer: Can
we see the seasoning?

523
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:51,806
That seasoning is...

524
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:52,890
Miller: "WIC approved."

525
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,811
So I can use my food
stamps to buy these

526
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,764
but I didn't, I'm almost eligible.

527
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:04,524
If my pay goes down 20 percent more,
I'll be eligible for food stamps

528
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,275
but I think the Governor's
cut food stamps, too.

529
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,574
Jeff: You know,I understand
in tough times everybody has

530
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,778
to take a haircut, but I'm bald.

531
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,331
We're all going bald now.

532
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,619
Miller: We're on our
way to a union meeting.

533
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:25,457
A special meeting that was called
to discuss a recent contract.

534
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,510
Frank: If they keep on chipping
away at the contract like this,

535
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,592
and any improvements we
gained over the last 20 years,

536
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,633
what's going to happen is you're
going to work till you're dead.

537
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:35,595
You'll never retire.

538
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,807
Man:Times are tough,
and everybody knows it

539
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:43,267
but they're taking away our
pension, it's a tough thing to do.

540
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,102
Man: Twenty-one yea rs on the job.

541
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,487
I've had 11 years that I've
had a zero percent pay raise,

542
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:49,864
no one wants to talk about that.

543
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,535
They feel this country is being
run into the ground by the unions,

544
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,112
which is the furthest
thing from the truth.

545
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,120
It hurts that we're the scapegoats

546
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,997
for the country's financial
problems now.

547
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:06,081
Dennis: I think that's the
political climate we're in right now,

548
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:12,013
I mean, we know nothing's perfect,
but if we didn't have unions,

549
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:18,515
a lot of people would be in a bad
position, even non-union workers.

550
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:22,769
Craig: So what I don't get
is when we became the enemy.

551
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:27,899
When the firefighters and the
police officers and the teachers,

552
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,526
the people that are trying
to make a difference,

553
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,572
all of a sudden we're
just costing too much,

554
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,824
and there's too much
expense out there.

555
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:40,370
Craig: And now, god, you'd think
you'd want to run away in shame,

556
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,627
because, "Oh, you're a public
employee, you're a civic employee."

557
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,761
Craig: I hear our new
commissioner's coming

558
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,465
to visit us this afternoon,
I've read a little bit about him

559
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:02,305
in the newspaper, I know he's from
Detroit originally, unknown quantity,

560
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:05,390
I'm sure we can all formulate
our opinions and jump

561
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,605
to our conclusions,
but time will tell.

562
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:11,192
Donald: I ain't got time to BS.

563
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:16,197
Somebody didn't do theirjob but
we can't be abusing our equipment,

564
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:20,080
pipe posts come up missing at fires,
axes come up missing at fires,

565
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,623
generators come up
missing off the trucks.

566
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:24,125
How does that happen?

567
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,128
If we're bringing good money in the
front door, and we're throwing it

568
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:29,832
out the back door, what
sense does that make?

569
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:36,130
Now you do know that 95 to 96 percent
of the budget goes to pay you guys.

570
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,472
Craig: Yes, yeah, we know that.

571
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,475
Donald:That leaves
four to five percent left

572
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:44,058
for everything else,
fuel and oil, supplies.

573
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,728
But there's a lot of stuff
here that I'm trying to figure

574
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,267
out why is it still broken?

575
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:53,401
I shake my head at some of the stuff.

576
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,482
I'm waiting for somebody
to say, "Smile!"

577
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,783
You're on Candid Camera!"

578
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:08,917
Shit rolls downhill and the Mayor
wants change, we better get back

579
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,131
in charge of our own damn department!

580
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,594
Trust me! I'm going to
do what I think is right,

581
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:20,891
I don't give a shit whether you
like me or not 'cause I ain't here

582
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:24,970
to make friends, I'm
here to be your leader.

583
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:45,783
Dispatcher: Fire 23
service, report a disposition

584
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:48,414
at 000, at 1245 (inaudible).

585
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,837
Dave: Start getting into warmer
days, and then when school lets out,

586
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,006
it just seems like the
fire load increases.

587
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:58,262
Man: A gallon of gas is still
cheaper than a movie ticket.

588
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,224
<i>Man: As soon as the weather
breaks, come May! June, ba-boom'.!</i>

589
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,649
Man: We was in the back
yard, smoke was coming out.

590
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,529
Man: Got a barbecue going, eh?

591
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:18,398
Woman: Uh huh!

592
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,907
Man: Okay, have a good day, now.

593
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:20,449
Woman: All right!

594
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:21,491
You too.

595
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,206
Terrell: Bulldog!

596
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,664
Chris: He said he was
burning some rats out of a bush.

597
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,916
And they started them on fire,
and they ran into the tree.

598
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,047
That was fucking horrible!

599
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,520
Man: You got my dog out?

600
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:51,681
Did you get my dog out?!

601
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:57,274
Chris: You don't
have to pay me, sir.

602
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,150
Jeff: Is that a piece of steak?

603
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:12,248
Miller: I don't think we've been
to sleep for more than a few minutes,

604
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,249
I mean, this is typical of
a summer night around here.

605
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:15,045
Man: Watch the wires, guys.

606
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:16,464
We got wires down.

607
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:28,135
Jeff: It's really not that hot.

608
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:29,768
Man: Whoa!

609
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,809
Man: You know what saggin' means?

610
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:36,642
What it mean?

611
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,154
It means you're looking
for a girlfriend!

612
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,439
In prison!

613
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:13,521
Doogie: It's weird.

614
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:17,184
The sensation's really weird.

615
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:23,365
Yeah, your perception is a little
off, and your first instinct

616
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,443
when you hit the bottom of anything
is to like, put your feet down

617
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,244
and kick yourself back up to the top.

618
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:36,379
You can't do that, so
it's kind of strange.

619
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:41,925
My line of injury is
basically between my nipple

620
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,753
and my belly button, because
that's where my sensation stops.

621
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:50,972
Since I've been here in therapy,
I can now consciously ﬂex muscles

622
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:54,680
and control muscles way
below my line of injury.

623
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:55,388
Things are happening.

624
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:56,973
I'm starting to gain control

625
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:03,238
over things I didn't have
control over when this happened.

626
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,815
It's relaxation, but at the
same time it's freeing your mind

627
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:06,740
from everything else.

628
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:11,872
You know, your onlyjob is
to, is to ﬂoat, don't drown.

629
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,667
And it definitely lightens up the
stress a little being in the water.

630
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,733
Parnell: You always expect
things to be the same.

631
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,611
You always expect things
to last longer,

632
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:56,454
you expect to grow old together,
I never expected to bury my wife.

633
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,666
Just figured that I would
certainly leave before her.

634
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:07,044
Well... you know, it didn't
work out like that, so.

635
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:20,228
Miller: Just came out of the
funeral for Dave Parnell's wife.

636
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:24,437
She had a cardiac arrest last Friday.

637
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,647
It was kind of shocking,
and incredibly sad.

638
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:33,202
The last four years, Dave's
taken a lot on himself

639
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:37,658
to help rehabilitate his wife.

640
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,003
Dave's life changed
radically that day.

641
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:51,133
I know his planned retirement
was wrapped around his wife.

642
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:58,603
Parnell: Thirty-five years just
wasn't enough, it really wasn't.

643
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:03,058
She did things like
this, she liked colors,

644
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,941
so she would make them
different colors.

645
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,990
It's like springtime all
the time, that was like her.

646
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,034
Always new, "You know,
hey, come here",

647
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,033
let me show you a little
something different."

648
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:23,955
(laughs) Yeah, everybody needs a
Gloria in their life, oh, geez, Man!

649
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:33,388
Donald:We're heading over
to our apparatus division,

650
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:36,432
we have a lot of rigs that are
broken down and it was getting

651
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:40,262
to a critical condition in
the field for fire trucks.

652
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:45,391
Now the Mayor has challenged all
of us department heads to come

653
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:48,069
in on budget, and that's
going to be my goal.

654
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:54,158
Looks like we're over about six
million dollars between fire and EMS.

655
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,907
You know, a lot of our budget goes

656
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,204
to repair these rigs
that are broken down.

657
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,535
And I don't think the men
and women understand the cost

658
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:04,835
of things, you know?

659
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:07,712
Just happened?

660
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,540
It's one of those days.

661
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,627
Donald:Wow, so would your
assessment be that we tear up a lot

662
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:14,133
of equipment around here?

663
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:19,555
Man: My assessment would be that
we tear up a lot of equipment.

664
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,683
Donald: We don't even have on
the radar buying new equipment.

665
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:26,186
You know? There's no
money for it, unless we...

666
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:28,768
A lot of things happen
here that shouldn't happen.

667
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:35,450
Everyone probably knows that we
parked a truck on a train track.

668
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:38,911
Reporter: The Detroit Fire
Department is still looking

669
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:40,613
into why a firefighter decided

670
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:44,535
to park the ladder truck on the
tracks and in the path of danger.

671
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,040
Donald: I mean, how do
you park on a train track?

672
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,498
An Amtrak train track no less.

673
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:55,053
When you park a 700,000
dollar truck on a train track,

674
00:45:55,628 --> 00:46:00,350
and it gets taken out, that's
700,000 dollars out of our budget.

675
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:04,312
We had another vehicle that
was driven under an overpass,

676
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,311
and we created a convertible
out of it.

677
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,602
The cab alone was 200,000 dollars.

678
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:20,953
I don't think we hold ourselves
accountable like we need to.

679
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:24,866
Let me ask you this:
What should happen?

680
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,167
Man: To the individual?

681
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:28,710
Donald:Well, you tell me!

682
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:29,712
Man: That backed up?

683
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:31,042
Donald: Or the officer?

684
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,047
Man: Or the officer?

685
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,171
Donald: Let's start
with the officer first.

686
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:38,213
Man: (laughs) Well, I'm
kind of partial to that, so.

687
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,673
Donald: I feel like I'm
in a parallel universe.

688
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,101
Nobody else thinks
like this in the world.

689
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,272
And I don't want to get to a point
where I accept that as a norm,

690
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,270
because that is not the
norm everywhere else.

691
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:51,434
It shouldn't be the norm.

692
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,695
You know, how they say when
you're in Rome, do as the Romans?

693
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:57,990
I ain't doing as the Romans,
I'm changing shit around here.

694
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:01,866
Excuse my French, but this is
pure, unadulterated nonsense!

695
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,244
I don't care how many more
stations you badly want open,

696
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:09,247
or might need to be opened,
there is no more money.

697
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,922
What do you do in your own
families when there's no more money?

698
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:17,218
How many of you going to come to
work and not get paid in two weeks.

699
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,261
Raise your hands if
you come in to work,

700
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,097
and knowing you ain't getting paid.

701
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:26,803
I'm at tremendous odds with
the people in this organization

702
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,434
for the direction that it must go.

703
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:31,728
Man: Go down to the shop,
we're not getting gear,

704
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,106
we're not getting rigs,
we're not hiring.

705
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:36,316
Donald: I ain't got
any extra money.

706
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:39,820
Imagine being in a closet
with a hornet's nest.

707
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:41,651
Man: You can hire now.

708
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,319
Donald:You're going to get stung.

709
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,464
Doogie:This past month
was really, really tough.

710
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,212
I wasn't feeling very well
the majority of the month,

711
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:58,133
and it kept me out of therapy.

712
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:05,718
I hate even saying it, but I still
can't take a shower by myself.

713
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:09,516
I was supposed to work till I was 60,
have a big blow-out retirement party,

714
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,727
retire a Chief, and things
were going to be lovely.

715
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,934
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

716
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:20,274
You know, I still have large
dependence on other people.

717
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,443
That's one of the most difficult
things with the situation.

718
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:27,326
It wears on you.

719
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:30,416
I feel like shit as it is, not
being able to go down to therapy

720
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,618
and get exercise and
get your blood pumping,

721
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,294
and get that social interaction.

722
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:41,878
Right now, I'm rounding the corner,
on getting the driving thing back.

723
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,845
It'll lighten the stress a
whole lot once I'm independent

724
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,848
to where I can drive wherever
and whenever, and I'm not relying

725
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,394
on someone fOf transportation.

726
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:57,811
It's a really big step into making
me feel somewhat normal again.

727
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:05,902
Man: Vacant?

728
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:10,206
Man: Looks like it.

729
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:10,872
Man: Hey boys.

730
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:19,253
If they knock that down, if
they do, get out of here.

731
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:25,842
Man: Come on down!

732
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:26,756
Man: We're trying.

733
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:33,813
Voices: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

734
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:43,823
Man: Oh, fuck!

735
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:54,163
Donald: Big challenge,
how do we get rid of this?

736
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:57,369
Man: (laughter) Vacant structures.

737
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:58,499
Donald: How?

738
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,628
Seventy percent of our work
is going to this stuff,

739
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,460
80,000 vacant structures.

740
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,009
Man: How many does the mayor
have slated to tear down this year?

741
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:10,262
Donald: He wants to
tear down 3,000 a year.

742
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:12,977
Man:That's just a
drop in the bucket.

743
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,227
Donald: Of course it is.

744
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,855
This is whooping our behinds.

745
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:20,943
This is breaking our
firefighter's back.

746
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:29,365
It's increasing overtime, injuring
our firefighters, damaging homes next

747
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:30,994
tO these vacant StTUCTUYES,

748
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:35,117
making the City look ugly,
we're being defeated.

749
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:42,215
We are so desperate, we got to
do something with this number.

750
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:47,637
You know, I'm almost resigned to the
point that until we get rid of this,

751
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:51,344
as Fred said, we're
just "managing misery."

752
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:03,985
Host: Tonight on "Let it Rip,"

753
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:06,564
the new Detroit Fire
Commissioner has been on thejob

754
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:09,483
for only three months, and
already he's shaking things up.

755
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,570
His controversial plan
is to fight some fires

756
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,951
in vacant houses, but not all.

757
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:17,408
Donald: I'm talking about
sometimes let it burn.

758
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,328
Host: He's worked in Los Angeles,
but tonight, he's back in the city

759
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:24,674
of his birth, with a bold new plan
to save money, and save lives.

760
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,718
Mr. Commissioner, lay it out
for us, how will this work?

761
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:32,090
Donald: I'm changing our aggressive
strategy on these vacant homes.

762
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:36,223
When there's no one in the home, we
need to be more in a defensive mode.

763
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,270
What I don't want is
an over-aggressive

764
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:39,643
non-thinking firefighter.

765
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,523
We are a professional
fire department,

766
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,943
and we have to balance
the risk versus gain.

767
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:50,529
There's not a building in the City
that's worth losing a firefighter's

768
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,530
life on, particularly if it's vacant.

769
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:09,837
Man:There's nothing within
100 feet of either side of this.

770
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:11,921
Let it burn.

771
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:17,017
Tony, let it go!

772
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,434
Man: I thought we
weren't putting it out.

773
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:24,976
Tony: Chief said put it out.

774
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,482
Man: I think it's absolutely
bullshit that somebody would tell us,

775
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:30,565
who's never been in a fire
here in the City of Detroit.

776
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:34,618
He might have lived here 30 or 40
years ago, but hey, I live here.

777
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:37,822
I know these neighborhoods or
whatever, and you never know

778
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,657
which house has somebody in it.

779
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,366
Bottom line, you never know.

780
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:44,958
Man: Unfortunately, in
all the abandoned buildings,

781
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,414
there's a lot of people
that squat in these homes.

782
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:48,624
Reporter: How long
he's been down there?

783
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:49,925
Man: He's been down
here for a week.

784
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:51,627
He was coming down here to
get water, and evidently,

785
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:53,713
somehow he couldn't get out again.

786
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,424
Man: I mean, I heard somebody
yelling, "Help, help, help!"

787
00:52:56,715 --> 00:53:00,310
But from out there it
sounded like a little kid.

788
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,604
I got in there and
it was a grown man.

789
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:05,475
Man: Homeless guy, his
feet are frostbitten.

790
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:09,983
Man: I'll call the
Commissioner uneducated

791
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:11,609
about what he's talking about.

792
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,899
For him to be talking
about this city,

793
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:15,780
you have to be here for a while.

794
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,362
You have to see it, and
you have to work it.

795
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:23,034
So what other people consider vacant
or abandoned, or living in squalor,

796
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,539
these are people's homes.

797
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,049
Donald: So I'll park
so you guys can get

798
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:44,434
out without banging
up my '86 El Camino.

799
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:53,947
So this is home.

800
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,364
Well, you know, you leave
work, you come home, you work.

801
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,739
You know, and because I'm not
married and don't have any kids,

802
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,407
it's just always working.

803
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:07,541
Man, that's when I had a hairline.

804
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,464
Lord have mercy, that was
back in my younger days.

805
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:14,964
And this is the helmet I was
wearing when we had a fire

806
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:17,638
on the eighth ﬂoor of the
Department of Health Building,

807
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:22,552
and this was the result of
me crawling on my knees,

808
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:25,805
and I crawled into a partition
or something, and I hit it

809
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:29,062
and I put the dent in the helmet.

810
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,235
So I tell the guys I've
been, I've been around.

811
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:49,336
Craig: My first day as Chief 9.

812
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:51,296
Man: You officially make it?

813
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,456
Craig: I officially made it.

814
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:53,715
Man: When?<br>Craig: Today?

815
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:54,670
Man: Today?<br>Yep.

816
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:56,009
Man: Congratulations.

817
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:57,628
Cap or... Chief.

818
00:54:58,212 --> 00:54:58,929
Craig:Thank you.

819
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,764
We are doing our rounds.

820
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:05,470
We're going to go pick up the mail
from Downtown, and then run it

821
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,727
out to each individual fire station.

822
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:13,690
Craig: Hey, how you doing?

823
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:18,115
Kids: Hey, everybody (laughter).

824
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,826
Craig: You know what,
they're not even here.

825
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:26,324
Engine 47 is one of the
browned-out companies, as they say.

826
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:31,583
On paper, it's a fire company,
but it's closed every day,

827
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,539
so all the men are dispersed.

828
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:37,126
We've got like five fire
companies that are like that.

829
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,802
It's quite a change.

830
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:42,006
The phones ringing, and the
paperwork, the scheduling,

831
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,262
and the manpower, it's
a whole different job.

832
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,394
And you're not one
of the guys anymore.

833
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:50,814
All of a sudden, you're
the guy saying, "No."

834
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:55,106
Here it is, the TAC Unit.

835
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,940
Their regular rig is out of service,

836
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,070
they got this as a
replacement vehicle.

837
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:05,746
The pumps work on it, we just are
not authorized to turn them on.

838
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,616
Regarding the TAC Unit, are
we going to be using that,

839
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:12,169
are we going to pump with
that tonight, or what?

840
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:14,166
Man:Wejust got
in it with the Chief

841
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:16,127
of the Department about the TAC Unit.

842
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:17,799
Craig: That's for manpower only.

843
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:21,212
It is not... orders are to not
let anybody stretch with it.

844
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,843
Man: What did they say
about us using the pumps, no?

845
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:25,595
Craig: I called after
they went back in service,

846
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:29,178
I was told they have no record
of any changes, status quo.

847
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,684
Man: So we're not allowed to pump.

848
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:34,858
Craig: That's what I was told.

849
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:39,940
Beginning to wonder if Detroit
doesn't put the "D" in dysfunctional.

850
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:52,534
Donald: I had ajanitorial
staff of one individual.

851
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:57,252
And we cannot afford to
keep him on the payroll,

852
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:03,297
so we cut him loose,
it's budget cuts.

853
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:08,467
You know, is that something
the Commissioner

854
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:10,849
of the Detroit Fire
Department should be doing?

855
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:12,930
Well, in these times, yes.

856
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:24,904
Dorian: But, it was like Nala
was wrestling in the movie.

857
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:25,905
Dave: Exactly.

858
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:26,659
Dorian: I know.

859
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:29,117
Have you seen "The Lion King?"

860
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:29,870
(laughter)

861
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:33,625
Dave: You know what
I watched yesterday?

862
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:35,828
There was no Westerns on yesterday!

863
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:36,957
Woman: Oh, no!

864
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:37,997
Dorian: What?

865
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,290
Don't you have the Western Channel?

866
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:41,500
Dave: Yeah, but that didn't
have nothing to do with it.

867
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:42,300
Man: I spent 24 hours watching...

868
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:46,255
Dave: That was Direct TV, too.

869
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,761
Dorian: So, no, no, no,
so there were no Westerns

870
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:49,928
on the Western Channel?

871
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:51,389
Is that what you're saying?

872
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:54,222
Man: Sometimes they have like
shows where they talk about Westerns.

873
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:54,895
Dorian: Oh.

874
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:55,604
Parnell: No, it wasn't that.

875
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,141
Man: It wasn't an actual Western.

876
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,684
24 hours of a black-and-white movie.

877
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:04,657
Parnell: Did I think about moving?

878
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:06,324
Absolutely.

879
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:11,622
But I work in my community,
I live in my community,

880
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:14,666
and I go to church in my community.

881
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:18,462
I do everything within
a five-mile radius.

882
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,589
Dorian:What are you
going to stay here for?

883
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,258
Parnell:What am I
going to leave for?

884
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:23,883
I'm just...

885
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:24,508
Dorian: What are you
going to leave for?

886
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:25,714
So you don't get shot!

887
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,883
Parnell: Well, cancel
the damn shot,

888
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:29,507
I don't plan on being shot, baby.

889
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:31,433
Dorian: Nobody plans on being shot!

890
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:33,560
That's why they have to
be rushed to the hospital.

891
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:34,428
Woman: Right.

892
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:35,975
Parnell: I talked to
your Uncle Joe about it.

893
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:39,024
It's going to take me a year to
get everything out of this house.

894
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:42,812
Dorian: As long as you don't
plan on being in this home for more

895
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:45,068
than a year or two,
I'm okay with that.

896
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:46,569
Parnell: Two years max!

897
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:47,608
Two years max.

898
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,282
Uncle Joe, you know?

899
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:49,781
Dorian: It was eight
months five minutes ago.

900
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,282
Parnell: No, no, no, no.

901
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,494
Well, I guess eventually I'm
going to be Downtown somewhere.

902
00:58:55,449 --> 00:59:00,171
I might go to a Johnny Mathis
concert if he comes to town, maybe.

903
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:01,622
Dorian: Really?

904
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,378
Parnell: Memories,
she used to like to...

905
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:08,258
well, we used to like to sit on
the balcony, yeah, that was fun.

906
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:09,137
Dorian: Okay!

907
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:11,640
Parnell: It won't
have the happy ending.

908
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:15,185
Man: You might be the youngest guy

909
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:17,434
at the Johnny Mathis
concert (laughter).

910
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:21,434
It'll be you and the guy
that takes the tickets.

911
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:32,272
Nurse: How you doing?

912
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:34,699
Doogie: (sighs) Okay, how are you?

913
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:40,452
Nurse: I'm good, okay, you're
all set, thanks, you too.

914
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,667
Woman: Hey, Doogie, how's it going?

915
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:46,795
Doogie: Pleasure
to meet you, Steve.

916
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,546
Therapist: You big,jerk.

917
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,248
Doogie: Sorry, had to do it.

918
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:51,507
Therapist: It's okay!

919
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:55,929
Nurse: Do you ever have thoughts
of hurting or harming yourself?

920
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:57,714
Doogie: No.

921
01:01:58,006 --> 01:02:00,054
Nurse: Are you on any
anticonvulsants, tranquilizers,

922
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:02,636
psychotropics or hypnotics?

923
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:03,766
Doogie: What's a psychotropic?

924
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:04,437
Doctor: Hey, buddy!

925
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:05,062
Doogie: How's it going?

926
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:05,688
Doctor: How are ya?

927
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:09,443
Doogie:The doctor here has
been in a chair for 20 years.

928
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:13,818
He was a quadriplegic that eventually
gained the use of his arms.

929
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,237
Doogie: Is that solid?

930
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:17,317
Doctor: Stronger than I look, huh?

931
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:18,402
Doogie: Yeah.

932
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,070
It's nice to have a
doctor in a chair.

933
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:20,737
Doctor: Okay, you passed the test.

934
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:24,040
Doogie: He's not going
to bullshit ya, he knows.

935
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:27,961
And this weekend is a
year from the accident.

936
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:35,169
Anything else as far as where I
should be at the one-year point?

937
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:41,759
Doctor: I think you're probably
about where you're going to be

938
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:48,349
for the long-term in terms of
recovery of movement and sensation.

939
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:52,778
I think you're going to be
in-line with the rest of us.

940
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:56,857
Now, you know... when I got hurt many
years ago, I used to see pictures

941
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:02,287
of those nerve cells growing...

942
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:15,923
Big deep breath in, out, your
mouth open, again, one more time.

943
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,634
Parnell: Anywhere that you look
up, you can see fireworks going off.

944
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:02,931
And you hear them and the
dog's a little bit nervous,

945
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:07,761
because we just rescued her out of
a fire, and now she's hearing all

946
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:11,440
of these sounds, but
she's a good dog.

947
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:27,452
Doogie: (glasses clinking)
Twelve years deep, and I'm retired.

948
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:31,626
Everything I did to
supplement my income

949
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:34,455
in the fire department
was all manual labor,

950
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:37,757
hardwood ﬂoors, carpentry, roofing.

951
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:39,710
I can't roof, I'm in a wheelchair.

952
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:45,674
Nobody's paying me for
my mind, that's for sure.

953
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:49,101
You know, maybe I'm not going to win
the lottery, maybe there's no miracle

954
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:53,061
out there for me, you hope in one
hand, and shit in the other and see

955
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,857
which one gets filled up faster.

956
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:02,816
Jeff: He calls them
as he sees them.

957
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:08,577
He's a straight-shooter,
that's for damn sure.

958
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,533
Donald:This is probably the
most difficult battle I've had.

959
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:15,045
And so far in life, I've
been fairly successful.

960
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:19,045
I'm going to hang in there,
I'm not going to quit,

961
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:22,423
I'm going to do the best I can.

962
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:25,802
I don't want to fail now in the
backend of my life, certainly,

963
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:27,348
backend of my work career.

964
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,147
Parnell: I've got
approximately 11 working days left,

965
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:47,786
and then I'll be retired,
that'll be the end of an era.

966
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:55,285
See I've been with Gloria for the
last 35 years, and this is going

967
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:59,039
to be different, totally different.

968
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:02,592
So I don't know, I don't know
what that's going to be like.

969
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:06,092
I don't want to think about it.

970
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:32,200
Dispatcher: (inaudible)
Alarm Company is responding.

971
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,407
Fire is reported in a dwelling.

972
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:37,293
They state that a child is trapped

973
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:40,372
in the upstairs attic,
in the upstairs attic.

974
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:42,708
Reporter: A three-year-old
girl dies

975
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,421
after being trapped
in her burning home.

976
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,800
When help arrived, the fire truck
wasn't equipped for the job.

977
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:50,632
But a tactical truck
was the first to arrive.

978
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:54,516
It's smaller, didn't have a
ladder, and didn't have a driver

979
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,313
who could use the 300-gallon tank.

980
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:15,203
Man: (mournful singing).

981
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:21,709
Man: Thank you,Jesus.

982
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:32,846
Woman: Oh, Jesus!

983
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:50,075
Man:This is a personal tragedy,
because this is my family, okay?

984
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,994
And all I know is that everyone

985
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:57,666
of these guys would have
risked their life to save.

986
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,914
Group: Yes, thank you, thank you.

987
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:02,120
Man: They did not fail.

988
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:04,627
Who failed us was the City!

989
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:10,717
Woman:Thank you, Jesus.

990
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,229
Thank you

991
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:25,235
(mournful singing).

992
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,357
Donald: Oh, it hurts deeply.

993
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:31,692
You know, I've seen my share of
life lost in the fire service,

994
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:37,205
and you just wonder what could
we have done differently?

995
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:40,208
Ms. LaRock: I'm mad
at the City of Detroit

996
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:46,377
that don't have the equipment
to rescue our people.

997
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,464
Why was a faulty truck
sent to my fire?!

998
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:53,046
Host: Ms. LaRock, have you
heard from Don Austin yet?

999
01:08:53,338 --> 01:08:54,260
Ms. LaRock: No, I haven't.

1000
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:55,673
Host: What would you say
to the Fire Commissioner?

1001
01:08:56,257 --> 01:09:00,057
Ms. LaRock: Fire Commissioner,
I don't know how you can feel

1002
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:03,140
in the bottom of your heart
that everything was done.

1003
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:08,528
There was faulty equipment
sent to my fire.

1004
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,446
And I wish you were here on this
panel, so I could look you dead

1005
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:13,650
in your eye to show you how I feel.

1006
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:16,573
Miller: His hands were
tied by the legal department,

1007
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,284
he can't say, "I screwed up."

1008
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:20,786
My Chief screwed up."

1009
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:24,040
Man:The person who lives the
next block over, next house down,

1010
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:31,002
"they're going to think
it was our fault."

1011
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,678
(alarm sounds).

1012
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,714
Donald: Yeah, some
days, I'm beat up.

1013
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:17,469
Three out of five, I feel like a
loser, can't seem to get ahead of it.

1014
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,345
Every problem seems to
generate another problem,

1015
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:23,269
and another problem,
and another problem.

1016
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:25,722
I feel like I'm walking
in a mine field,

1017
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:29,309
at any time I could sever a leg.

1018
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:40,571
Craig: Tragedy like that, guys do
come together, that invisible thing

1019
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:44,579
that bonds us all together,
kind of draws you in.

1020
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:47,001
Dave: There's no way to
do anything but grieve,

1021
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,879
and to get through the grieving
process, and the only way to do

1022
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:54,631
that is to stay close to one another,
and just pull each other through.

1023
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,337
Donald: I don't want
you to feel attacked,

1024
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:58,929
I don't want you to feel threatened.

1025
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:02,930
We can figure this
out, now, I tell you,

1026
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:04,726
I know that we can figure it out.

1027
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:05,477
Man: Yes, we can.

1028
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:06,137
Donald: Why?

1029
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:06,808
Because we're firefighters.

1030
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:08,765
Man: We know it the best.

1031
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:10,315
Donald:We're still DFD!

1032
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,064
We the baddest guys in Michigan!

1033
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:15,738
I want to let you know that
I'm in alignment with you,

1034
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:20,364
I'm not against you,
I'm not against you.

1035
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,366
We're all on one team,
"Here's what we did wrong,

1036
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,745
here's what we're going
to do to improve."

1037
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,161
Together, we come up
with the answers.

1038
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:33,923
Man: Commissioner, straight-up,
we don't look at you as the enemy,

1039
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:39,304
we're accepting you into the
family, I think with open arms.

1040
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:40,926
Donald: And I perceive that.

1041
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:44,343
You know, you have to stay positive,
it's all about leading, you know,

1042
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:47,270
if the leader is all
shaken up and afraid

1043
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:50,439
and you can expect the
crew to fall apart.

1044
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:52,517
Craig: Give him the
benefit of the doubt.

1045
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:56,063
He knows his business, he seems
to know what he's talking about.

1046
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:59,149
If he can pull it all
together, you know,

1047
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,154
more power to him,
go ahead and do it!

1048
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:02,739
Let's see what you can do here.

1049
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:06,664
Donald: Be seeing you again,
y'all better get back to work.

1050
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:35,026
Craig: Commissioner's "Let
it burn" policy, you know what?

1051
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:37,107
If there's no hazard
to nearby structures,

1052
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:41,658
and there's nobody inside
the building, let it go,

1053
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:46,079
I don't have a problem with that.

1054
01:12:46,654 --> 01:12:47,906
Hey, do not let them go in there.

1055
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:50,409
Man: They do have a
door open in the back?

1056
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:53,495
Craig: Yes, that roof
looks real shaky there.

1057
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:55,580
It's collapsing right now, isn't it?

1058
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:58,461
Man: Get everybody off the rooﬂ

1059
01:12:59,041 --> 01:12:59,633
Get off the roof.

1060
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:07,593
Craig: Hey, get the... hey,
get him out of there right now.

1061
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:08,266
Who the fuck is that?

1062
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:08,934
Get out of there!

1063
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:09,559
Man: Get off the roof, Joe.

1064
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:10,386
Chief said, "Everyone
off the roof," let's go.

1065
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:18,354
Craig: It's my job now to make sure
everybody goes home in one piece.

1066
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:21,564
I'll take it as a huge win that if
three years from now when I retire,

1067
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:26,578
that at any of my fires, nobody
gets hurt, nobody gets killed.

1068
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:29,622
That's all I'm really
concerned about right now.

1069
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:20,257
Parnell:(horn blows) (laughs)
What's up, BK, you all right, man?

1070
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:22,629
Good, call me.

1071
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:26,088
Did you ever give my girl
in the Ford an invitation?

1072
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:28,638
Man: Your girl in the Ford?

1073
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:30,515
Man: Who you talking about?

1074
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,225
Parnell: The woman
that's in that Taurus?

1075
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:39,480
Man: Oh, wow, no, I didn't,
I don't know that lady.

1076
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:41,060
Parnells: I don't either.

1077
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:43,446
Man: I'm not hitting on
her for you (laughter).

1078
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:39,161
Man: My father taught me,
never let anything beat me,

1079
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:42,621
you can always figure out a way.

1080
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:44,962
I'm a product of Detroit.

1081
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:48,052
I'm one of those guys that I'm not
going to turn my back on Detroit.

1082
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:52,681
Dennis: I'm an optimist, sol
see it, it's got to come back.

1083
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:56,557
This City is too great,
there's too much history.

1084
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:01,979
Parnell: For all the pain
that the City truly causes me,

1085
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:05,061
I still love it, it's still home.

1086
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:09,490
I'm a Detroiter.

1087
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:21,248
Donald: Boy, I tell ya, it
feels good to be back in Detroit.

1088
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:24,167
Driving down Woodward
drinking myVernor's, man,

1089
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:25,919
this is the life (laughs).

1090
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:50,948
Donald: As firefighters,
all we deal with is change.

1091
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:54,736
And we know that we
got to fix this thing.

1092
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,302
Donald: Hey, man, a single
guy only needs like one

1093
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:13,971
of these massive potatoes.

1094
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,217
I thought I'd be much further along.

1095
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:20,769
Some mornings, I feel like
throwing in the towel.

1096
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:26,434
It wears you down, you know, after
a while, 'cause you don't want

1097
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:29,691
to let the people down, I
don't want to let them down.

1098
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:33,024
Like every week I work here is about
a year off of my life (laughs).

1099
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:39,076
But that's all right, my
grandmother lived to be 103,

1100
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:40,781
so I got a lot of time left.

1101
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:57,219
Doogie: So what do you
want to eat there, Smiley?

1102
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:00,809
Angie: National Coney Island.

1103
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:01,806
What?

1104
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:02,887
Doogie: Somebody telling
me that I can't walk,

1105
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:04,437
it's not going to kill me.

1106
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:06,144
I have other things to worry
about, you know, like maybe trying

1107
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:08,317
to start a family,
and stuff like that.

1108
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:10,645
So all that stuff is still possible.

1109
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:20,994
This shit doesn't happen
overnight, progress takes time.

1110
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:25,959
Dispatcher: Detroit Fire
Department, the time is 07, 28 hours.

1111
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:30,464
Congratulations, FEO
Franklin Parnell of Engine 50

1112
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:34,294
from the Detroit Fire Department on
your retirement from Central office.

1113
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:35,886
Man: Congratulations.

1114
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:37,592
Parnell:Thanks, so much, Keith.

1115
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:38,847
Man: Congratulations.

1116
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:40,845
Parnell:Thank you,
I appreciate it.

1117
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:44,645
Today is the last day that I
will be standing in this uniform

1118
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:46,438
for the Detroit Fire Department.

1119
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,474
Miller: So we're having
a few guests tonight.

1120
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:53,860
Like the whole battalion, some
family members, some friends.

1121
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:55,155
Parnell: Hey, Fred!

1122
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:55,860
What's up, man?

1123
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:57,274
Just glad to be on the job, huh?

1124
01:18:57,566 --> 01:19:00,695
Miller: I'm sure the fires will
be annoying and screw it up today.

1125
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:06,284
It's hard to plan this
kind of stuff around work.

1126
01:19:08,953 --> 01:19:13,880
Oh, I want that piece.

1127
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:16,589
Parnell: I think
they might miss me.

1128
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:19,843
I'm going to stop by
occasionally and say, "Hello."

1129
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,845
It's going to be different,
but it's going to be good.

1130
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:26,053
Yeah, I'm going to stick
with that, it's still going

1131
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:31,518
to be good, no matter what.

1132
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:34,861
It's going great, absolutely great.

1133
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:39,317
I'm looking at a true blessing here.

1134
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:40,735
That was Craig.

1135
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:43,905
Captain Daugherty, or
Chief Daugherty, now.

1136
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:47,457
Yea h, yeah, wow.

1137
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,627
Dispatcher: Two-alarm,
Engine 60 and Ladder 23.

1138
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:52,037

1139
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:53,588

1140
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:55,841

1142
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:12,688

50 and Squad 6... (sirens)

1143
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:22,492
Parnell: Is it okay
to get my favorite kiss?

1144
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:25,283
See ya.

1145
01:20:26,697 --> 01:20:26,822
Man: C'mon, let's go.

1146
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:27,497
Parnell: I got it.

1147
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:29,325
Yeah, he's got it.

1148
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:30,704
I'll be seeing ya, man.

1149
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:32,370
Man: See ya bro, see ya, hug, okay.

1150
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:33,002
Man: See ya later tonight, bro.

1151
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:41,134
Parnell: Take care,
see ya, thank you.

1152
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:47,097
All right, Mr. Johnson, take care.

1153
01:20:55,267 --> 01:21:03,197
(siren fades into distance).

1154
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:12,581
(crickets chirping).

1155
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:14,457
Engine!

1156
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:15,708
Engine!

1157
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:16,918
Engine!

1158
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:25,840
Miller: Where to?

1159
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:54,039
Man: Engine 50, Ladder

1162
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:02,627
Fire reported, 14467 Almont.

1163
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:11,057
Engine 50 stretching on a dwelling.
