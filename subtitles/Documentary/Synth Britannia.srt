[Gildas] We have a spy
inside the Cantii citadel.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,392
This spy tells me
Kerra came to see you.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,711
What deal did you make with her?

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,712
[Divis]
Lokka himself is here.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,392
[Cait] So why did
the Druids cast you out?

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,914
[Divis] Because
I was possessed by Pwykka.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,433
He's one of the three
Demon Kings.

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,873
So he's still
inside you?

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,632
Pwykka's been asleep
for a year now,

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,869
but with all these rumblings,

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,109
| feel him.

13
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,397
[Quane] If Lokka is here,
Pwykka won't be far behind.

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,235
Veran took the Roman General
to the Underworld.

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,469
Follow his footsteps.

16
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,949
Only then will you know
what it is he seeks,

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,632
and what might save us.

18
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,712
It's you.

19
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,479
You will defeat them.

20
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,112
I must hurry.

21
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,269
Pwykka!

May the gods protect you.

46
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,273
Lindon of the Gaul,

47
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,236
come forward.

48
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,395
You have proved yourself
a noble warrior

49
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,993
in the service
of my father.

50
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,433
If you agree,

51
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,116
I would have you serve
as General of all our forces.

52
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,432
[quietly] Help me.

53
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,469
May the gods protect you.

54
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,836
My queen.

55
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,117
I pledge my undying loyalty.

56
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,874
May the gods protect you.

57
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,191

00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,071
Two.

60
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,070
There you are.

61
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,229
Thank you.

62
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,396
There we go.

63
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,152
Thank you.

64
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,271
So..?

65
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,475
Come on,

66
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,595
paint me a picture.

67
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,116
Tall.

68
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,156
Pale skin.

69
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,992
Long hair...

70
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,229
like a proper queen.

71
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,912
Does she look wise?

72
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,955
Very.

73
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,234
She‘s going to need to be.

74
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,992
What colour hair?

75
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,672
Red, like fire.

76
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,749
I knew it.

77
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,068
Your mother
had red hair.

78
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,718
lslene had
a touch of it, too.

79
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,030
The gods only give their fire
to their favourites.

80
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,315
Only for
the special ones.

81
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,431
ltdoesnt
make sense.

82
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,873
What doesn't?

83
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,757
When I was out there
on the rocks,

84
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,909
day after day,

85
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,911
dragging wet salt
up that hill,

86
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,752
one thing kept me going,

87
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,037
that l was raising
someone special,

88
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,269
that the gods
gave me lslene

89
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,999
to raise for them
for a special purpose,

90
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,798
and I'd better not mess it up.

91
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,270
So why did
the gods punish me?

92
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,759
Your brother
spoke to the Roman,

93
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,353
then freed the girl
and they left together.

94
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,351
Whatever you're thinking
right now, it's wrong.

95
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,998
Your brother
is now your enemy.

96
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,593
There's is no love
left between you.

97
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,672
Phelan would never
betray his tribe.

98
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,909
Summon the Roman.

99
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,317
My brother
came to see you.

100
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,277
What did he say?

101
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,032
What did he want to know?

102
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,791
Your father
asked me questions, too.

103
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,716
Where did that get him?

104
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,111
Rome kept its word.

105
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,110
You're free to go.

106
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,713
But with this message.

107
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,190
Tell your General
that I will speak with him.

108
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,111
But he comes here,

109
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,394
to me.

110
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,111
I'll pass your message on.

111
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,838
[sighs with satisfaction]

112
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,478
I think he's going
to like it here.

113
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,155
After all,
it is a fine fortress.

114
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,478
[door creaks open]

115
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,479
What are you
doing in here?

116
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,993
The queen demands
that we remain together,

117
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,878
for the stability
of the tribe.

118
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,155
Then we must do
as the queen demands.

119
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,754
I'll find
somewhere else to stay.

120
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,869
If we're going to pretend,

121
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,837
we might as well
make it convincing,

122
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,399
for the good of the tribe,
and all.

123

[Lindon sighs sadly]

124
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,599
I don't hate you, Amena.

125
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,069
In fact,
I feel sorry for you.

126
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,434
Thank you, Lindon,

127
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,033
but there's really no need.

128
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,159
I've always been
very resourceful in adversity.

She shall be blinded
by the fear...

Blinded by the pain.

Bound by me, cursed by me...

Praefectus.

147
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,953
That night
the prisoner escaped,

148
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,950
you were in the sickbay,

149
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,837
had a clear view
of where he was tied up.

150
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,638
That's right, Praefectus.

151
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,029
Did you see
anything?

152
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,030
What like?

153
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,953
Like a blind man
freeing himself

154
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,315
and escaping from
a heavily-armed camp?

155
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,355
There was something...

156
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,599
What?

157
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,318
A small girl.

158
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,276
Pale.

159
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,315
Mousey hair.

160
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,868
She called him "father".

161
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,799
She freed him.

162
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,917
And you didn't think
to mention this before?

Get on your feet.

We're getting out of here.

00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,629
Move.

170
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,550
She wants to talk.

171
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,756
Not in the field,

172
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,955
in her fortress.

173
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,110
[Aulus] Then talk we shall.

174
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,428
What, so we just
let this pass?

175
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,511
Roll over,
let her tickle your tummy.

176
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,068
We're dealing with
a new regime now.

177
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,195
What do you think, Vitus?

178
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,713
Do you think we can
persuade the new queen

179
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,349
of a golden future
inside the Empire?

180
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,192
She's not like her father,
is she?

181
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,714
I mean, why waste
Roman lives

182
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,835
on the battlefield

183
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,353
when common sense can win?

184
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,953
[sighs]

185
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,519
No skin off my nose.

186
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,591
Uaughs]

187
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,318
That's the spirit.

188
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,597
Vitus, the day of the ambush,

189
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,591
we've a legionary here
who was with you,

190
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,389
claims Vespasian
sent him back here.

191
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,708
Is that his story?

192
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,508
Oh, dear.

193
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,160
Assemble
an advance party.

194
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,639
We'll march
to Crugdunon

195
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,278
and parlay
with Queen Kerra.

196
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,952
Before I forget,

197
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,393
the blind prisoner.

198
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,277
Laughing Boy says
he knows how he escaped.

199
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,759
Oh? How?

200
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,909
A little girl.

201
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,194
His daughter.

202
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,953
She broke into camp
and freed him.

203
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,509
What?

204
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,874
A little girl?

205
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,554
He's a bullshitter.

206
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,468
I swear,
when | find him,

207
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,913
|wi|| fucking kill him!

208
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,479
Did he say
what she looked like?

209
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,039
Small, pale,

210
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,030
dark cloak,

211
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,348
mousey hair.

212
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,873
She called him "father."

213
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,915
Oh, he saw this happen?

214
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,910
I told you,

215
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,399
he's a bullshitter.

216
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,674
But I know this much,

217
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,512
someone freed that Cantii.

218
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,750
l fed his fucking eyeballs
to the crows.

219
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,431
A blind man...

220
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,150
A blind father.

221
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,192
Right...

222
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,076
Where are you?

223
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,149
Over here.

224
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,116
Whoever has the stick,

225
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,430
make a noise before I toss this.

226
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,635
What kind of noise?

227
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,835
Like a pig.

228
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,750
Squeal like a pig,

229
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,239
give me something to aim at.

230
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,629
[snorting]

231
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,709
Uaughs]

232
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,153
What happened?

233
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,832
[laughing] Too high, Dad!

234
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,592
Sounded like a very tall pig.

235
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,159
All right, let's try again.

236
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,639
-[snorting]
-Again?

237
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,914
[boy snorting]

238
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,475
Where'd it go?

239
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,509
[fabric tearing]
Ow!

240
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,589
Looking for this?

241
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,799
Your queen speaks to you.

242
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,149
What's your name?

243
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,674
I don't have a name.

244
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,359
Don't be scared.

245
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,674
I gave it away
at the Solstice.

246
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,876
The Romans attacked
before I had my new name.

247
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,914
Come with me.

248
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,949
Follow me.

249
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,190
[m]

250
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,029
Come.

251
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,118
Come.

252
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,752
My mother made this.

253
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,434
I wore it the day
after my solstice.

254
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,471
My first day as a woman.

255
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,312
It's beautiful.

256
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,515
Try it.

257
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,359
I can't take this.

258
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,078
It's yours.

259
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,639
It's for somebody important.

260
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,393
Well, soon be covered in mud,
if you're anything like me.

261
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,116
Do you have
family here?

262
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,475
Just me and Dad.

263
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,233
lslene was killed by a Roman.

264
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,958
lslene?

265
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,429
My big sister.

266
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,192
I'll see her again when I die.

267
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,158
Dad said there's a place
for the ones the gods love most.

268
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,997
It sounds like your father
misses her very much.

269
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,149
He does.

270
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,276
She was special.

271
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,958
Well, that can't be easy
for you.

272
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,109
How do you mean?

273
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,394
Well, sometimes,

274
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,869
fathers, they decide
who their children are,

275
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,154
for their own reasons.

276
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,191
It doesn't mean it's true.

277
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,313
lslene was special.

278
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,593
What do you think?

279
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,910
Is that me?

280
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,072
That's you.

281
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,599
[m]

282
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,152
I'm back!

283
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,196
Ah, we were worried.

284
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,793
Where are you?

285
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,758
[snorting enthusiastically]

286
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,832
[chuckling] That's my girl.

287
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,070
[all laughing playfully]

288
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,391
[m]

289
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,999
Afternoon.

290
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,990
Lovely day.

291
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,752
Aren't they all?

292
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,478
You look well.

293
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,913
Have you put on
a bit of weight?

294
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,915
I take it
they've met before?

295
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,877
Apparently, yes.

296
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,439
I thought so.

297
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,952
I need to thank you,

298
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,873
for sticking to your part
of the bargain.

299
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,109
Was there one?

300
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,509
Well, Pellenor's dead,
Kerra's queen.

301
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,874
And the sky is blue,

302
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,188
thank the gods.

303
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,072
Why don't you
thank them for me?

304
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,189
You were followed.

305
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,594
On your journey.

306
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,638
Or did you think you
were alone down there?

307
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,757
That it was
just for you?

308
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,193
And how do you know,
were you there, too?

309
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,831
You were careless, Rome.

310
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,717
Or perhaps too eager.

311
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,155
Either way,
someone else was there,

312
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,037
saw what you saw,

313
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,519
knows what you know.

314
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,988
Don't you want to know his name?

315
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,718
I know his fucking name.

316
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,677
Of course.

317
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,876
You've met before.

318
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,310
You've been most accommodating.

319
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,594
Very helpful.

320
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,558
But from now on, let's say
we strike another deal.

321
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,959
And what's that?

322
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,713
You keep away from me,
and I'll keep away from you.

323
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,836
You stay away
from the Citadel.

324
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,433
You have no power there.

325
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,714
Not anymore.

326
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,438
Are you threatening the Druids?

327
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,838
l'm warning you.

328
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,870
You remind me of someone,

329
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,916
someone I met a long time ago.

330
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,149
And who's that?

331
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,679
Julius Caesar.

332
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,752
What happened to him?

333
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,953
Do we have a deal?

334
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,632
The gods
don't deal, Rome.

335
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,915
The gods don't deal.

336
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,709
Is he ready?

337
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,349
Nearly.

338
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,919
Very nearly.

339
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,834
Who's your skinny friend?

340
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,558
He's no friend of mine.

341
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,715
Forward!

342
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,516
[legion marching rhythmically]

343
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,069
[Pwykka snarling and hissing]

344
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,276
[snarling]

345
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,588
[slathering]

346
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,679
Halt!

347
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,793
[gasping for breath]

348
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,471
Help me, please...

349
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,438
Help me, please...

350
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,397
[dying man gasping and wheezing]

351
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,556
[whispers]
It's all right.

352
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,155
Who did this to you?

353
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,673
His name...

354
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,232
is...

355
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,355
Pwykka.

356
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,714
[gasping and choking]

357
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,394
[man sputtering and wheezing]

358
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,668
[bones crunching]

359
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,592
Forward!

360
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,758
You're late.

361
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,432
Yeah, sorry about that.

362
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,592
Where's my present?

363
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,874
Present?

364
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,359
The Druid's head--

365
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,589
[together] --On a stick.

366
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,669
Yes, I'm working on it.

367
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,353
How many?

368
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,475
5,000.

369
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,993
They're all standing by
across the river.

370
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,514
I can muster twice that
by the next moon.

371
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,639
My warriors are drawing lots
to cut the copperknob's throat.

372
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,438
They'll have to wait
in line behind me.

373
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,913
I'd like you
to stand your army down,

374
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,437
until I've spoken
to the new queen.

375
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,432
You'll all die in this field
before that happens.

376
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,149
It will take four days
to march three legions here.

377
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,878
Tell me,
how will your 5,000,

378
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,949
10,000 warriors fare

379
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,191
against 20,000 of us.

380
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,795
Like it red then, do you?

381
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,155
Do you want to bed her
before she dies?

382
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,511
Stand your army down

383
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,556
until I give the order
to attack.

384
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,635
You'll have to kiss
more than my foot

385
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,153
to sell that one to me.

386
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,231
Once the Citadel has fallen,

387
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,709
the emperor
will recognize you as queen

388
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,791
of all the Cantii lands.

389
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,393
Does that hit the spot?

390
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,634
One day,

391
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,472
and it will be sooner
than you wish,

392
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,789
you Romans will be no more than songs
and ruins in our land.

393
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,678
We don't want you.

394
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,954
We don't need you.

395
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,156
That is how the story ends.

396
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,399
But until then,

397
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,153
you will stand down your army?

398
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,348
Until dawn.

399
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,471
Then you can lick my crack.

400
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,830
Get in my way,
and we'll kill you all.

401
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,311
[crowd murmuring]

402
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,711
[gasping awake]

403
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,471
Is anybody there?

404
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,034
[m]

405
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,589
Amena...

406
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,190
Are you my demon?

407
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,439
I beg your pardon?

408
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,430
Amena...

409
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,555
Who is this?

410
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,436
Don't speak with her.
She's an imposter.

411
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,794
Amena, that's enough.

412
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,915
It's me you should speak to.
I'll do what you want--

413
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,274
-Guard.
-Anything you ask.

414
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,315
Anything.

415
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,311
This way.

416
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,389
Sorry for your loss.

417
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,630
We Romans have no truck
with sacrifice.

418
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,790
It's abhorrent to us.

419
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,916
Are the consequences
less abhorrent?

420
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,911
A new queen means new times.

421
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,877
A new way
of doing business.

422
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,030
A new future.

423
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,918
I presume that's why
you've asked me here,

424
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,797
to talk about the future.

425
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,998
[screaming in frustration]

426
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,156
[horse shrieks in fright]

427
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,276
Who's that?

428
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,159
Who are you?

429
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,275
Where are you going?

430
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,678
To the Citadel.

431
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,639
I've come to send her
to the underworld.

432
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,995
Then it's you.

433
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,436
Can you take me
to her?

434
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,875
Can you get me inside?

435
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,269
When we show up

436
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,032
with our ships,
and troops, and camps,

437
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,916
it can look, um--

438
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,672
Bad?

439
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,996
Misleading.

440
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,873
It's not
what the Empire's about.

441
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,790
Oh?

442
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,949
What is it about?

443
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,439
One thing.

444
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,909
Taxes.

445
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,797
Reasonably levied,
efficiently collected,

446
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,835
funneled back to Rome,

447
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,478
that's it.

448
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,949
That and a few million slaves.

449
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,671
War is the enemy
of the tax collector.

450
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,954
That's why we like to get
to the peace part

451
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,156
as quickly
as possible.

452
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,468
Which is where
your fortress comes in.

453
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,073
Roman soldiers
stationed here

454
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,559
with your permission

455
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,868
could keep the peace
for a hundred years.

456
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,995
Maybe even a thousand,

457
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,877
and that's a lot of...

458
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,518
peace.

459
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,794
And a lot of taxes.

460
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,071
You get the idea.

461
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,879
And the safety of my tribe
can be guaranteed?

462
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,870
That's the deal.

463
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,439
So you're here to help.

464
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,238
I think I've made that clear.

465
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,152
So, why are you lying to me?

466
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,792
I don't understand.

467
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,996
You made a deal
with the Druids,

468
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,718
and you made deal with my enemy.

469
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,395
Antedia's army is standing by
if this doesn't work out.

470
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,629
Do you deny any of that?

471
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,790
And you want me to trust you?

472
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,759
May I be frank?

473
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,110
I don't know my fucking Cantiis
from my Regnis,

474
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,351
and I genuinely don't care.

475
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,237
We both want
the same thing,

476
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,754
the safety and security
of these lands,

477
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,750
and these people.

478
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,469
Or do you trust
your Druids with that?

479
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,308
We're the future, you and I.

480
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,870
Chaos,

481
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,872
sacnﬁce”.

482
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,075
that's the past.

483
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,390
That's quite a trick
they have...

484
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,630
[m]

485
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,915
...to know your story
before you've lived it.

486
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,196
Do you believe it?

487
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,632
I will be my own queen.

488
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,473
So, we have a deal?

489
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,154
I will retain control
of my warriors.

490
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,196
Your soldiers will
protect my borders,

491
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,238
and no Cantii will ever
be a slave to a Roman.

492
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,197
If the agreement holds
in five years,

493
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,714
we can talk about taxes.

494
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,119
Ag reed.

495
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,758
What else?

496
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,319
I need to speak
with my elders.

497
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,197
You'll have your answer
by dawn.

498
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,236
The Empire is cemented
by many things,

499
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,311
not just war.

500
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,794
If things go
the right way,

501
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,952
I'd like us to become...

502
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,473
much closer.

503
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,111
I left my last suitor

504
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,634
scrabbling on the floor
for his balls.

505
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,995
Well, I've never shirked
a challenge,

506
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,069
but if it comes to that,

507
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,991
just give me a few yards
head start.

508
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,750
[chuckles]

509
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,595
I made you smile.

510
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,634
You should do that
more often.

511
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,268
What do the Druids
say about me?

512
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,237
That Rome is a demon.

513
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,314
What do you think?

514
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,354
I suppose I'll find out.

515
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,354
Oh, one last thing.

516
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,317
You've lots of people here
looking for safety.

517
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,550
lost their family,
lost their homes,

518
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,232
it's most unfortunate.

519
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,309
We came across a couple,

520
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,197
a young girl and a blind man.

521
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,633
We think it's his daughter.

522
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,755
Have you seen them?

523
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,391
What interest
do you have in them?

524
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,358
Are they here?
I'd like to meet them.

525
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,113
There is no one
of that description here, no.

526
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,989
Well, if you see them,
I'd very much like to know.

527
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,875
By dawn then.

528
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,993
It's been a pleasure.

529

Anyone
can make birds disappear.

535
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,911
Even your fat, old dad
can do that.

536
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,673
The trick is...

537
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,194
making them come back,

538
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,474
right...

539
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,788

Hey!

Get up now, wake up!
We have to go!

547
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,952
We have to go now! Move!

[Pwykka snarls savagely]

Wait--

554
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,597
Please, he's going to kill us.

555
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,795
Is he your father?

556
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,996
Yes, and we have to
get out of here now!

557
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,956
-Come with me.
-Thank you.

558
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,671
Halt!

559
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,398
Seize them!

[swords ringing]

561
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,389
Stand aside!

562
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,708
Those prisoners belong to us.

563
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,394
You came here
to parlay.

564
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,435
Leave now!

565
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,396
Take them!

566
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,156

It's a trap!

Stand your ground!
Protect the General!

571
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,555
Stay close to me. Hurry.

572
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,910
Quick.

573
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,039
Keep left at every turn,

574
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,189
otherwise
you'll lose your way fast.

575
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,840
You'll come out
south of the castle.

576
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,239
Thank you.

577
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,435
Listen to me.

578
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,509
You are the one.

579
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,553
It's you.

580
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,630

Let them go.

592
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,391
You have made
a big mistake here today.

593

Are you all right?

594
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,918
Veran told me

595
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,194
what he put here,

596
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,840
the night
he took my mother away.

597
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,114
He said it means,

598
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,668
"Hope is the small daughter
of a blind father."

599
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,829
That's you.

I thought it was.
