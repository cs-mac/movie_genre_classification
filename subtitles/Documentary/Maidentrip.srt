1
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,561
Hello, hello.

2
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:20,621
Test.

3
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:22,189
Test.

4
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,671
Okay, so here we go.

25
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000
#00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:27,320
#Okay now, this is just
#the table and where you live.
#
#26
#00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,190
#This will be my bed.
#
#27
#00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:33,925
#You can't imagine it now,
#but there I will be sleeping.
#
#28
#00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,567
#If you see it now you think
#"Oh no, that will takes weeks."
#
#29
#00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,163
#But it's not so worse
#as you see it.
#
#30
#00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,267
#Every day since February
#we've been working on it.
#
#31
#00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,778
#In Holland, they tried
#to stop her trip,
#
#32
#00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:54,273
#but there isn't any law
#to stop this.
#
#33
#00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:57,345
#It's really weird, yeah.
#
#34
#00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,449
#They try to break Laura down.
#
#35
#00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,486
#But Laura is actually too
#strong, so it's not enough.

36
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,657
Okay'-

55
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,425
And now here's
an interesting controversy.

56
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:15,331
A thirteen-year-old Dutch girl
wants to sail the world alone,

57
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:19,303
but is facing pressure not to
go from her own government.

58
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,772
Council for Child Protection's
so concerned about the dangers

59
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,469
of the marathon voyage,
it's asked a court

60
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,809
to grant it custody of Laura.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
#00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:33,909
#I just didn't know what
#was going on at all.
#
#62
#00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,389
#The media came, and I was
#famous in the whole of Holland.
#
#63
#00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,914
#But I never had wanted
#to be famous
#
#64
#00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,757
#and it was also the worst
#kind of being famous
#
#65
#00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,821
#that there can ever be.
#
#66
#00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:50,630
#The worst part was definitely
#they wanted to pull me away
#
#67
#00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:55,663
#from my dad and put me in some
#kind of home for crazy kids.
#
#68
#00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,436
#It was really nasty.
#
#70
#00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,362
#Of course there were people
#who say you're crazy,
#
#71
#00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,386
#but it's a dream.
#
#72
#00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,696
#A great, great dream.
#
#73
#00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,328
#I want to sail,
#I want to go around the world.
#
#74
#00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,532
#I want to see all the places
#and not always
#
#75
#00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,939
#the stupid same thing.
#
#76
#00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,705
#♪
#
#77
#00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,973
#After one year of fighting
#
#78
#00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,106
#we were able to win
#
#79
#00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,817
#which was really nice.
#

83
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,788
Dutch teenager Laura Dekker
set out this morning

84
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,693
in a journey to become
the youngest person to sail

85
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,595
around the world alone.

86
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,896
Dekker had to fight a 10 month
court battle to be allowed

87
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:01,531
to make that trip by herself.

102
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,193
Umm, yeah.

240
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,666
It's just amazing.

241
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,541
I always dreamed of it,
live this way of life.

243
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,580
I was born on a boat in New
Zealand when my parents were

244
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,744
sailing around the world.

245
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,811
It was a magical time.

246
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:35,223
It was beautiful, but my mom
totally didn't like sailing.

247
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,420
She actually hated it.

248
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,658
She got seasick every time.

249
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,257
When I was four, we sold
the boat and bought a house

250
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,427
in Holland.

251
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,903
And then my dad started
building a boat right away

252
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,505
and my mom just...
I don't know...

253
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:54,602
she found someone else
and they broke up.

254
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,274
So then they asked me
where I wanted to live.

255
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:03,810
I said my dad,
because I really wanted to sail.

256
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:07,756
Sol grew up in a shipyard
with my dad building boats.

259
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,497
When I was about six,
my dad got me an Optimist,

260
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,591
a little dinghy boat
where I always sailed in,

261
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,603
mostly after school.

262
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,937
When I was about eight, a really
nice friend of my dad had a boat

263
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,302
that he didn't want
to sail in anymore,

264
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,675
so he gave it to me.

265
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,240
It was where I actually learned
sailing with my dog, Spot,

266
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,719
which was an excellent crew.

267
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:40,212
When I was about 10 years,
I got a Hurley 700,

268
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:43,317
a nice seven-meter
seaworthy boat.

269
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,454
Of course, I needed to
get a job to pay for it,

270
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:50,456
so I brought newspapers
around, I cleaned shops.

271
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,629
I did practically anything
that got me money.

273
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,837
I sailed every day and always
on the summer vacations I would

274
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,903
cruise through whole Holland.

275
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,381
Then when I was thirteen,
I actually sailed

276
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,907
to England alone.

277
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,887
And when I had done that,
I was sure that I wanted

278
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,547
to sail around the world.

280
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,450
I wanted to see
the south horizon.

298
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,528
My mom and my sister were
finally able to visit me,

299
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:41,697
which was awesome
because they were on vacation

300
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:45,766
when I left, so they didn't even
wave me out when I was leaving

301
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:47,105
On my big trip,

302
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,578
which I was really sad about.

303
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:53,674
So, it was really cool
to see them again.

323
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,586
So, I was 10 years old,

324
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:43,532
I don't have too much
memories of my mom.

325
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:47,799
After my parents divorced,
she lived somewhere else.

326
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:51,000
I tried to visit her every
weekend, but I had a feeling

327
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:55,478
that there was too much things
going on in my mom's life,

328
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,945
and I was too much
to handle for her.

330
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,448
My mom, though, seems to care
a lot about me now,

331
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:06,183
and we write each other
a lot more than before.

332
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,986
So that's good.

334
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,859
Since I'm really young, I've
had a really good relationship

335
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,524
with my sister.

336
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,501
She grew up with my mom,
so we're separated

337
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,093
for most of our lives.

338
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,971
But, we always got along
pretty good.

339
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:29,035
She's totally crazy and
really funny and really cool.

351
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:43,551
People keep asking me what
I actually miss from home.

353
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,087
It worked!

354
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,320
In the beginning,
I missed the refrigerator,

355
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,758
internet, having a bath,
having a shower,

356
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:58,757
having a bed that's not
salty and moving but, yeah,

357
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,737
after a few weeks,
I was used to it.

358
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,641
It's really normal now,
and, yeah, I don't miss a thing.

360
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:13,909
About being lonely... sometimes,
but you meet like a bunch

361
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,920
of people which
is the nicest thing.

362
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,944
You're all
in the same community.

363
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,355
It's like skaters and surfers.

364
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,322
If you see each other,
you just connect right away.

366
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,374
So, here we are with Laura
Dekker trying to crash me!

367
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:51,918
And Deana behind me,
coming up fast in the rear.

368
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,251
Okay, I'm coming!

369
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,019
We're picking up speed.

370
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,650
Look out, there's deer!

372
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,632
Laura Dekker leads the way,
but only brieﬂy

373
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:05,134
as Mike Rule takes the lead,

374
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,261
oh there she goes,
putting on the Dutch sprint!

376
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:14,038
Yeah, these are cutter ants.

377
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,169
And look at 'em carrying that.

378
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,180
Look how strong they are.

379
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,647
Carrying them all
the way across...

#380
#00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:22,117
#These are our heroes!
#

381
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,847
Crossing the bridge.

382
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:27,152
♪

383
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,852
Listen to that monkey.

384
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,293
You guys hear that?

385
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,092
You hear that noise?

386
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,792
Mike and Deana...

387
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,960
I met them
in the San Blas Islands,

388
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,994
and we've been hanging
out every day.

389
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:46,669
Mike, he had cancer a few years
ago which is when they realized

390
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:50,009
they wanted to see the world
in their boat.

391
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:54,313
They were really cool and just,
we like did a lot together.

392
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,320
We got the kids up here
on the bow, cleaning-.

393
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,913
Get to work, you slaves!

395
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,000
#00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,787
#I felt just like I had a family-.
#
#396
#00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:10,197
#Just like a normal family,
#and I was their daughter.
#
#397
#00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:12,132
#It was really nice.
#

399
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:20,439
We had been sailing
with another Dutch couple.

400
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,206
Didn't we get together for...

401
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,769
Dutch night?

402
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:24,974
No, we went-we went snorkeling.

403
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:25,947
No, we went snorkeling.

404
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,711
We went snorkeling first?

405
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:31,186
Because we love sailing
and outdoor water activities,

406
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,019
it just worked out that we
developed a friendship.

407
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,422
But I think it's a... I think

408
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,449
the sailing community
is a unique place

409
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:42,363
because normally people our age
wouldn't become close friends

410
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,298
with maybe
a fifteen-year-old.

411
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:48,065
It just wouldn't happen
under normal circumstances.

414
00:29:55,393 --> 00:30:00,001
It was like before that,
I had a turning point.

415
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,443
In the Caribbean,
I could always turn around

416
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,378
and go back to Europe,

417
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:07,008
but by passing the Panama Canal,

418
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,178
I really had to go forward.

419
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,279
The Pacific, yee-ha!

420
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:16,850
It's just the point that
I really say I'm gonna do it.

421
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:19,828
From there, it just started
to get serious.

436
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,532
Woo-hoe!

437
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:11,699
We're almost there.

438
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,102
Yeah, we're almost there.

439
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,304

Woo-hoe!

460
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,593
All of the other kids in school
thought that I was crazy.

462
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:48,129
I had one or two really good
friends but as they got older,

463
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,507
they changed from how I changed
and that just faded away.

465
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:59,739
I definitely
preferred sailing for school.

466
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,615
I don't like when people
tell me what to do.

468
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,251
Yeah, I can't really imagine
how my life would be

469
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:11,192
if I would still be in Holland.

470
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,161
Probably would be really boring.

474
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:19,328
...with me,
behind the boat.

475
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,556
Okay, everybody's ready?

476
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,826
Take the tanks up in the pool.

477
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,835
Check her tank,
make sure it's open.

478
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:26,892
Check your valve.

479
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,536
Okay, okay, guys, ready!

480
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:34,407
One, two, two and a half, three!

481
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,911
Go!

484
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,600
What do we need?

485
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:39,733
Eggs and milk.

486
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,538
Did you want something
to mash it with?

487
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:45,673
Yeah.

488
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:07,231
Well, the hardest thing
about building bonds like this

489
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,762
is when you have
to leave people you love.

490
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,401
You know, it was a very sad
day when we had to leave

491
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:14,933
our daughter to go sailing.

492
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:19,437
But, sad days can also,
you know, bring, bring much joy

493
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,475
when you get a chance to get
back together, so I'm looking,

494
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:27,478
I'll be looking forward to that.

So, are we ready to eat?

496
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,622

Have a good trip.

When you meet other sailors,
you already know that some time

525
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,880
you will sail a different way.

526
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:37,852
It's like normal, yeah.

527
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:41,482
Because you're sailing
around the world and like...

Everyone does it.

I like looking around,
talking to the waves

534
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:18,888
and the sea and to Guppy.

535

I have a really
good friendship with my boat.

538
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:34,465
We got her when I was 14.

539
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:36,205
She was totally wrecked.

540
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,210
She had been standing
there for seven years.

541
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,508
There was one meter
of water in it,

542
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:44,611
and plants had been
growing over it.

543
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:47,452
Everything
in it smelled horrible.

544
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,719
It was like a ghost ship.

545
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:53,991
But it was cheap,
and we could afford it.

546
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:58,023
So, we bought it
and started working on it.

547
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:00,661
And after a month
of working on it,

548
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,898
I really fell in love
with the boat.

549
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,734
Guppy is 40 foot,

550
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,974
which sounds quite big
to some people,

551
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:15,677
but it's, like, really small.

552
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,049
I really feel like a guppy

553
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:19,554
when I'm on this big ocean.

561
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:10,799
The sail across the Pacific

562
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,775
was, I think,
the most beautiful sail

563
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:15,936
I've ever had.

564
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,843
My parents sailed the same route

565
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,142
20 years ago,

566
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:22,742
and I had my logbook
from my parents,

567
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:24,719
so every day I was looking

568
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:27,086
at what their speed was.

569
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:30,786
So I was racing against them.

570
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:33,260
They took about 19 days,

571
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:34,661
and I did 18,

572
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:37,222
so yeah,

573
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:38,665
pretty awesome.

575
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:58,913
When I was younger,

576
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,049
I saw all these pictures
from my parents

577
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,286
from all these beautiful islands
in the Pacific

578
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:06,921
that I couldn't even
imagine really existing

579
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:10,364
because they looked
way too perfect.

580
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,194
And now, I can't believe it,

581
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:14,634
I'm here.

582
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,743
Every country you come in,

583
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,981
you have to find
out where customs is

584
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,217
and go over to them.

585
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,247
When do you leave?

586
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,626
Uh, Sunday?

587
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:41,925
You go the islands?

588
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,363
I don't know, I think so.

589
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:44,297
But it's not sure.

590
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,358
Mo'orea is sure.

591
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,892
Not sure?

592
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:49,666
Really.

593
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:51,400
Most of the time it's pretty fun

594
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:55,076
because they totally
don't get what you're doing.

595
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,942
They ask an exact date

596
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,344
when you're leaving.

597
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,679
Sometimes even hours
and minutes,

598
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:02,684
which is practically impossible,

599
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,708
it's, like, not a plane.

600
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,814
I want to know on what date
you leave French Polynesia.

601
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:09,756
You know?

602
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,351
- I don't know, it's a sailboat.
- I know it's a sailboat.

603
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,226
Yeah, it's really hard to...

604
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:16,162
it's like, you go
with the wind when it's good,

605
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:18,757
and you never know
where you're going.

607
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:37,345
I loved the Pacific
from the beginning.

608
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:39,081
All the islands are different,

609
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,179
the people are different,

610
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,087
the cultures are different.

611
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:45,719
It just is,
it's... it's paradise.

612
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:48,820
In Europe and Holland,

613
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,798
they're thinking
only about money.

614
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:53,358
Money is most important thing,

615
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:54,960
raising a family, getting a car,

616
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,869
getting a house, getting kids,

617
00:44:56,894 --> 00:45:00,034
and then die.

618
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:02,101
But the Pacific,

619
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:03,338
it's perfect.

621
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,173
I only stayed for a couple
of days in each island

622
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:34,142
to still be in the good season

623
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:36,838
to press to the Indian Ocean,

624
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:39,939
which makes me
really, really upset.

625
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,745
I just couldn't handle

626
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,981
leaving this beautiful place
so soon.

628
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,491
I was also sad because

629
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,263
I was sailing past New Zealand

630
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,236
and not stopping there.

632
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:06,867
I was born there,

633
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:10,902
and seems like such
a beautiful place to go to.

634
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:14,074
It was like, like my dreamland

635
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,381
and it was there, it was close.

636
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,387
But I had to go past it

637
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,286
if I still wanted to be

638
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:23,484
the youngest person
to sail around the world.


640
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:27,560
I don't know,

641
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:32,325
maybe it doesn't
really matter anymore.

642
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,336
A friend told me
about Moitessier,

643
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:37,100
and I got really inspired
by his story.

645
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:41,877
He's originally a French sailor

646
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,880
who wasn't rich,
really poor actually,

647
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:48,042
and he needed the money
for his family,

648
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:51,484
so he started doing races
for prize money.

649
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:54,011
So he was sailing

650
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:55,580
this huge race around the world

651
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,315
for the fame and the money,

652
00:46:57,347 --> 00:47:01,056
and he was almost about to win,

653
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:03,064
and then he just said, "Fuck it,

654
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:05,157
I'm gonna continue
into the Pacific."

655
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,260
He just walked away from it,

656
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:10,465
didn't finish.

657
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,996
What I love about the story is

658
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:14,202
that he just did it
for the sailing,

659
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,177
he didn't do it
for anything else.

660
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,009
He just loved being out there,

661
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:21,847
just like I love
being out there.

662
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:23,317
I love what I'm doing.

663
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,546
I love sailing.

664
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,316
I love the ocean.

689
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,497
I had been awake
for almost three days

690
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,624
by the time
I came into Australia.

691
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,134
And all of my sails

692
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:55,329
were just ripped
and broken down,

693
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:59,171
and my steering wheel
had fallen off.

694
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:02,700
I felt like I was just
on the bottom.

696
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,014
Suzanne is this journalist
from Holland.

697
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:10,541
She has been following me,

698
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:12,281
really, since the beginning.

699
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:13,788
She's nice, and I know her

700
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,082
for quite a while now,

701
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:20,255
but I don't really like
journalists most of the time.

702
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:22,388
So many questions
over and over again,

703
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:24,262
and mostly bothering me at times

704
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:27,530
that I really,
really don't want it.

739
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:54,112
How do you feel about it?

740
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:55,350
Great.

741
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:01,692
It sucks.

742
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:02,718
Yeah, but why?

743
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:03,840
In the beginning of the trip,

744
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:05,595
you often miss your parents.

745
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:06,896
Of course.

746
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,128
Yeah, but now you
don't miss them as much.

747
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,401
Look, I haven't seen my dad
in a really long time,

748
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:13,669
so I don't miss him anymore.

749
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:17,304
No, yeah that's... that's
also, yeah.

750
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:19,780
That's also a possibility,
but isn't it also part

751
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,249
of growing up that you are...

752
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,513
Probably, but could you
just shut up for a moment?

753
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,885
No. Thank you.

754
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,389
I was (unintelligible),

755
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:29,583
because you
didn't finally answer

756
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:31,286
the question completely.

757
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,294
Is it also because...

758
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,923
Why can't people stop it
if you ask them to?

759
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,690
...Became more independent?

760
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:48,809
Is your trip
about becoming independent?

761
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:58,685
(radio static)

762
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:16,434
...will be closing
in seven minutes.

763
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:20,366
I always loved my dad.

764
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:21,671
He has done everything for me

765
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:24,338
to make my life better,

766
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,505
but as a kid,

767
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,412
it was kind of hard sometimes.

769
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:32,751
After my parents divorced,

770
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,813
we moved to Mijk Bij Duurstede

771
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:39,418
and lived in a really,
really small trailer.

772
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,395
So my dad worked
building kitchens

773
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:43,329
in houses for people.

774
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:46,562
He worked from six
to nine most of the days,

775
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,627
and then when he came home,

776
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:53,607
he'd eat really fast
and work on the boat.

777
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,541
I had to do a lot alone...

778
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,602
making breakfast,
getting dinner ready,

779
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,841
cycle to school, do my homework,

780
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:02,372
everything.

781
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,749
When I was nine,
my dad got a breakdown

782
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:06,947
because he just worked too much,

783
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:11,653
so he had to stay home.

784
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:12,921
In the beginning,

785
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:15,725
I totally didn't understand it.

786
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,493
He got angry really fast.

787
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,491
And I was really scared of that.

788
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:23,663
You really don't know
when it's coming.

789
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:24,763
He could be really nice,

790
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:25,898
and then the next moment,

791
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,465
it was just like, boom!

793
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:31,809
But then he explained
what was going on

794
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:34,509
and what I should do,
so I got used to it

795
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:37,848
and I got really tough
because of that.

797
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:45,954
I still feel like he did
a really good job.

798
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:48,394
When I asked my mom
to come watch something,

799
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:49,954
she never did.

800
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:51,556
My dad always did.

805
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:19,960
Really, and there was also one

806
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,690
in the engine room.

807
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:22,822
But that one is so greasy

808
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:24,388
that it's only like a...

809
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:25,559
That was a technical one.

810
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:28,865
Yeah.

811
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:29,996
Yeah, that's my crew

812
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:31,903
but they're all died.

813
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:33,032
The crew died?

814
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:34,906
One died because of grease,

815
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:36,968
the other one died
while he was trying

816
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,844
to get my thing
not to leak anymore,

817
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:44,375
and one that was just
really hungry tried to cook,

818
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:45,886
because I found him
like under here.

819
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:54,655
My dad and I had to repair

820
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,561
everything on the boat.

821
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:59,396
I had been pushing Guppy so hard

822
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:01,561
and didn't really have any time

823
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,696
to fix her at all.

824
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:04,967
We worked every day,

825
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:06,132
there was no fun,

826
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,706
and we had to fix up my boat

827
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:09,005
in less than a month,

828
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:13,412
and it tired us out a lot.

829
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:16,474
So, it was kind of a hard time.

830
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:18,042
It was nice to see my dad again,

831
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:22,784
but of course,
we had the usual fights.

841
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:49,842
I've been living on my own

842
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:51,784
for about a year now,

843
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:55,551
so I don't need him anymore

844
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,821
like I did when I was younger.

845
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:01,658
I still love him to visit me

846
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:04,460
and to give me advice
and things,

847
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:07,093
but I feel like I'm
a little bit more grown-up now,

848
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:09,865
and I can do more things myself.

849
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:44,936
Two days to go till
my sixteenth birthday.

850
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,669
I think I changed quite a lot.

851
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:48,937
In the beginning of the trip,

852
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,673
I really enjoyed being ashore

853
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:53,112
and meeting other people

854
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,809
and seeing the countries,

855
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:58,115
and now, I really started

856
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,779
to like long passages more,

857
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:03,120
just because it gives
you so much time to think

858
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:06,525
and just have
no one bothering you.

860
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:32,208
Of course, now they
don't want to go out!

862
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:41,252
I love being alone,

863
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:44,629
and I guess, yeah.

864
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:46,691
I feel like freedom is when

865
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:48,725
you're not attached to anything.

867
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,538
What size do you have?

868
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:57,909
I can go bigger,

869
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,709
or how much smaller
do you want me to go?

870
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:00,942
- Well, the thing is...
- About there?

871
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,007
This thing is like,
so long, yeah.

872
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,916
But it's the correct
protocol size.

873
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:06,978
I know, I know, okay.

874
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,170
The Australian ﬂag's the same.

875
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:09,918
Yeah, is there one smaller?

876
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:12,153
Well, that's what I'll find
out for you now.

877
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:14,024
Good.

878
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,290
I changed my ﬂag

879
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:17,662
from Dutch to New Zealand.

880
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:20,759
I just decided not to sail
for the country anymore,

881
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:24,602
but for the country
that I was born in.

882
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:25,901
My name's Ron.

883
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:27,237
I'm Laura.

884
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:28,264
And you're Dutch?

885
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:29,208
Yeah.

886
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,302
No.

887
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:35,247
I just realized
that I don't have

888
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:37,717
any real connection
with Holland anymore.

890
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,578
I don't want to go back there,

891
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:43,215
I don't want to live there,

892
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,250
and I don't have anything
in common with Dutch people,

893
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:49,320
except for the fact
that I speak the language-.

894
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:51,696
So, I don't know,

895
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:54,793
I don't really have a home.

896
00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:57,304
Home to me is Guppy.

898
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:07,000
#01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,844
#Thailand, what the fuck
#is Thailand doing
#
#899
#01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:10,646
#in the Indian Ocean?
#
#900
#01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,244
#Oh wait, it isn't.
#
#901
#01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:16,086
#Okay, so these are
#all the charts.
#
#902
#01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:18,058
#I mostly don't use them
#
#903
#01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:21,028
#but if the computer
#with the cards crashes,
#
#904
#01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:25,658
#I just want to be able
#to come somewhere.
#
#905
#01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:26,894
#It's really cool
#
#906
#01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:28,664
#if you work with the sextant,
#
#907
#01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:29,965
#you make all those notes.
#
#908
#01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:31,700
#And then you have
#this piece of paper
#
#909
#01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:33,139
#with all those
#weird things on it
#
#910
#01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:35,972
#and then you can find out
#where you are.
#
#911
#01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:38,172
#Most people don't have
#them anymore.
#
##912
#01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:39,407
#But I do.

913
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:50,415
So this is really bad.

914
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,957
Because, okay,

915
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,984
the higher the numbers,

916
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:56,691
the more you have a problem.

917
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,926
So, South Africa...

918
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:00,730
higher than 5,

919
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,998
you have seriously a problem.

920
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:05,836
Okay, starting with 3, 2, 4,

921
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:07,341
then in Durban is already 8,

922
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:10,139
then going
around South Africa it's 10,

923
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,873
and even 11 <i>,</i>

924
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:16,111
which is seriously not good.

925
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,000
#01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:17,413
#So for October,
#
#926
#01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,783
#you will probably survive.
#
#927
#01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:19,980
#But if you go in November,
#
#928
#01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,317
#which I will be,
#
#929
#01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:24,791
#you can get waves
#that are 60-foot high.
#
#930
#01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:28,059
#Okay, yeah, the winds
#are just starting
#
#931
#01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:29,757
#to get really annoying.

932
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:34,863
I've decided to take
the Southern route

933
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:37,371
across the Indian Ocean
to avoid any problems

934
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:40,431
with pirates up
in the North part.

935
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:42,943
It's quite a bit harder
and longer route,

936
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:46,276
so I'm actually
pretty nervous about it.

937
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:48,441
Anything can happen out there...

938
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:50,712
no winds for weeks,

939
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:54,779
or storms that keep going
over me.

940
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:57,291
So, that's kind of scary,

941
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:59,418
and at the same time it's like,

942
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:01,053
an awesome challenge.

945
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:52,310
Okay, no worries,
we'll talk to you tomorrow.

947
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:54,844
Fuck.

1007
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,316
After 30 days,

1008
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:30,756
time just didn't exist anymore.

1009
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,623
It didn't really matter,

1010
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:34,685
which I'd never felt before,

1011
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:37,664
and it was the best feeling.

1012
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:39,131
I didn't really care
if there was

1013
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:40,657
a lot of fronts coming over,

1014
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:43,295
or no wind.

1015
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:45,430
I made peace with it.

1016
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:46,667
I was just there,

1017
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:49,107
I was with nature.

1018
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:51,634
From the starting
of being the worst trip,

1019
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:55,137
it actually was
the nicest trip ever,

1020
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:56,275
just mentally.

1032
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:55,897
South African Weather Service has issued

1033
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:57,673
a watch for severe thunderstorms.

1034
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,203
Potentially large hail
and damaging winds.

1035
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:01,738
A warning exists as well,

1036
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,273
for the possibility
of heavy swell.

1038
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,730
In the night, there were
really high waves.

1040
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:27,498
The wind picked up more
and more and more,

1041
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,737
and I was going way too fast.

1043
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:33,811
The whole cockpit
was full of water,

1044
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,214
and like things that
should be in the front

1045
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:37,842
of the boat were
in the back of the boat.

1047
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:51,456
What was for me amazing was

1048
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:55,299
I didn't feel
anything but focused.

1050
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:59,502
I was on the top of being alert,

1051
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:02,475
and being scared
was totally gone.

1053
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,309
I didn't feel that I was tired,

1054
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,973
I didn't even feel
that I was hungry.

1055
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,547
I was just doing it.

1057
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:42,712
There were all these people
that just looked at me

1058
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,342
like it was impossible

1059
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:46,876
that I had come
in with this weather.

1060
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:49,856
And as I finally started
to warm up again,

1061
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:51,551
and to think straight,

1062
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,820
I realized that,

1063
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:55,556
"Wow, that's
actually pretty badass."

1064
01:10:57,653 --> 01:10:59,963
Before I left,
like, a lot of people

1065
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:02,401
that said,
"Well, you will sink anyway."

1066
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:05,871
And now they're like, "Oh no,
I always believed in you."

1067
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:07,373
First I was like, "Yeah, right,"

1068
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:09,433
and now I can
just laugh about it.

1070
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,709
It was really cool.

1071
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:51,411
I crossed
the three biggest oceans...

1072
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,350
the Atlantic,

1073
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:52,977
the Indian Ocean,

1074
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:55,352
and the Pacific...

1075
01:11:55,377 --> 01:11:57,880
and only the South Atlantic
was waiting for me.

1077
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:04,663
Now I look back on it,

1078
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:06,530
I wanted the storms,
I wanted the calms,

1079
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:07,761
I wanted to feel loneliness,

1080
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:09,531
I wanted to feel
what it felt like

1081
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:11,003
to be in the sea.

1082
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:14,803
And now I know all these things.

1083
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,400
I now knew

1084
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:18,412
what sailing
around the world meant,

1085
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:21,347
and knew that
I would keep doing it.

1087
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:25,974
It was an end of the dream

1088
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,612
that I had as a kid,

1089
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:30,487
and it's the beginning
of my life

1090
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:31,752
as a sailor.

1100
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:48,758
I started officially in Europe

1101
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:51,931
but I definitely don't want
to go back to Holland.

1102
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,634
So, instead
of sailing to Europe,

1103
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:57,906
I'll sail to the Caribbean.

1104
01:13:57,933 --> 01:13:59,606
As soon as I get there,

1105
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:01,774
I will have officially

1106
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:03,579
rounded the globe, alone.

1108
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:20,058
The South Atlantic
was really nice for me.

1109
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:22,898
I finally had time
to think about the past,

1110
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:24,768
about what's going
to happen next,

1111
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:27,103
about stupid things,
like wondering

1112
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,972
what kind of animals
are all swimming

1113
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:33,070
under your boat,
like, 3,000 miles deep.

1114
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:35,513
Yeah, it felt pretty awesome.

1117
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:22,126
I wasn't really looking
forward to arrive.

1118
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:24,221
I just wanted
to continue sailing,

1119
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:26,096
wanted to stay

1120
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:28,795
at that quiet spot.

1121
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:30,269
I could deal with everything,

1122
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:31,635
with high waves,

1123
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:32,660
with a lot of winds,

1124
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:34,106
with loneliness,

1125
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:37,906
but people and media,

1126
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:39,935
I almost just sailed

1127
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:42,574
straight to Trinidad
or Barbados.

1128
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:44,743
But, I finished!

1132
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:07,666
The best part was
definitely seeing my mom,

1133
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:11,007
my sister, and my dad
all at the same time.

1134
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:13,604
It was a perfect welcome.

1137
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:43,136
I really love sailing alone,

1138
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:47,944
but I also really love
sailing with someone too.

1139
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:51,611
I was looking
for crew and I met Bruno.

1144
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,823
There's just some moments

1145
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:04,194
that are way more beautiful

1146
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:06,961
to just share it with someone.

1147
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:11,699
So we're sailing to New Zealand.

1148
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:12,899
I feel like New Zealand

1149
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:15,704
is gonna be a good place for me.

1150
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:18,177
And if it turns out not to be,

1151
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,873
I'll just travel farther.
