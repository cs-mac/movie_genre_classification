{1}{1}25.000
{1175}{1258}It was... magnificent.
{1265}{1320}One of his pictures are equivalent...
{1325}{1371}...to ten of somebody else's.
{1377}{1452}"Oh, Nicole," and shake his head.
{1459}{1523}And nobody ever really knew him.
{1529}{1589}He was known...
{1594}{1649}...as a kind of future threat.
{1655}{1729}One of the all-time great|motion picture makers.
{1736}{1783}A future threat to peace and quiet.
{1791}{1831}Legendary...
{1849}{1874}...meanness.
{1879}{1917}At times he drove me crazy.
{1924}{1978}He was a very loveable individual.
{1983}{2057}I love him one minute,|and the next I could kill him.
{2062}{2111}Maybe the smartest man I ever met.
{2117}{2175}He got fascinated|with Nescafé commercials...
{2182}{2232}Did you see the film Groundhog Day?
{2238}{2322}...because they told stories so fast.
{2327}{2362}That's what it was like.
{2367}{2433}This man was born|to push the envelope...
{2441}{2514}There is still a part of Stanley|that is a great mystery.
{2519}{2558}...and he always pushed it.
{2563}{2644}You expect someone like that|to be different from us.
{2650}{2700}We were too scared of him over here.
{2707}{2799}Everybody pretty much acknowledges|he's the Man...
{2816}{2905}...and I still feel|that underrates him.
{4252}{4355}This film is about the life and work|of Stanley Kubrick:
{4360}{4483}An outstanding filmmaker,|one of the great artists of our time.
{4635}{4704}Stanley Kubrick was an enigma|to many people.
{4711}{4764}In his films he was extrovert...
{4770}{4869}...challenging, and ready|to break conventions.
{4939}{5012}But Kubrick himself|was intensely private:
{5018}{5125}Shunning publicity and fiercely|guarding his anonymity...
{5136}{5205}...happiest at work and at home|with his family...
{5211}{5271}...and a large circle of friends.
{5316}{5418}He was a chess player in every sense.|Both cautious and aggressive...
{5423}{5549}...he took great risks but evaluated|each move with the greatest of care.
{5649}{5763}Stanley was born in New York and|remained a New Yorker all his life...
{5770}{5875}...even though he and his family lived|in England for nearly 40 years.
{5936}{6047}He died at his home|on the seventh of March, 1999.
{6073}{6173}This film will make use of unique|material which has never been seen.
{6178}{6256}It is a document about a man|who remained silent...
{6262}{6349}...whether he was being applauded|or damned.
{6497}{6632}Stanley Kubrick was born in New York|on the 26th of July, 1928.
{6650}{6698}His father, Jack, was a doctor...
{6703}{6772}...who'd married Gertrude Perveler|the previous year.
{6901}{7000}His sister, Barbara, was born|six years later, in 1934.
{7007}{7096}Today, a lot of people that have|kids that are that far apart...
{7141}{7258}...they encourage the older one to|nurture the younger one as a baby...
{7267}{7311}...so they get to love them.
{7331}{7378}But I gather Stanley|was very jealous...
{7414}{7456}...you know, that I was there.
{7462}{7533}He was very good, though.|He was very good to me.
{7555}{7625}Nobody ever accuses him|of being playful.
{7651}{7697}Well, he was playful...
{7704}{7795}...like on The Addams Family|kind of playful.
{7842}{7937}When he was little, I think they|considered him kind of a sissy...
{7956}{8081}...because he just wasn't|like your typical boy.
{8088}{8161}He read a lot. He always had a book.
{8167}{8221}Well, my mother read all the time.
{8227}{8334}She always was behind him, always,|and she really believed it.
{8355}{8423}She says, "There's nothing|you can't do."
{8437}{8512}She always was supportive of him.
{8519}{8619}She was really a great mother,|I think.
{8644}{8721}- Were they strict, Gert and Jack?|- No.
{8748}{8809}Never. He always did what he wanted.
{8815}{8902}In 1941, when Stanley was|12 years old...
{8908}{8968}...he went to Taft High School|in the Bronx.
{8973}{9073}At the beginning, I think, of the|second week, Stanley turned to me...
{9112}{9241}...as the class opened and said...
{9247}{9370}...could I let him copy the day's|homework? I said, "Sure, why not?"
{9376}{9441}The next day he asked the same thing.
{9484}{9621}And the next day after that, and before|I knew it he was doing it every day.
{9627}{9692}So after about a week or ten days...
{9698}{9805}...I finally got up enough|aggressiveness to say:
{9813}{9902}"Stanley, why aren't you doing|your homework?" He said simply...
{9909}{10021}...and in what I learned was his|characteristic quiet way:
{10027}{10075}"Well, I'm not interested."
{10081}{10184}It wasn't as if he were stupid.|He was simply not interested...
{10189}{10238}...and acted upon that.
{10243}{10368}Stanley was really quite involved,|quite passionate about photography.
{10373}{10472}Stanley, you must understand, was,|by the general lights of the time...
{10515}{10635}...the son of a wealthy person,|as they had their own home.
{10641}{10731}They could have a darkroom.
{10768}{10836}His father was interested|in photography...
{10841}{10960}...and I think he encouraged Stanley|to use it and become a photographer.
{10966}{11039}That darkroom background, actually...
{11045}{11113}...was one of the bedrock things...
{11118}{11213}...that enabled him to develop|a very high level...
{11221}{11296}...of sophistication|about photography...
{11302}{11350}...and then finally cinematography.
{11355}{11421}Stanley was fascinated by photography.
{11427}{11514}He was the photographer on the school|newspaper and looked for pictures...
{11521}{11576}...that would capture the imagination.
{11581}{11643}We interrupt for|a special news bulletin.
{11650}{11773}A press association has just announced|that President Roosevelt is dead.
{11811}{11907}Roosevelt was a god to us.|That's what my mother said. She said:
{11912}{11988}"I'm not sure there's a God,"|when he died.
{12022}{12122}And then when he took that picture,|whoa.
{12128}{12240}It made everybody that saw it cry.|They'd just start to cry.
{12247}{12328}He looked like just|the world had ended...
{12334}{12384}...and Stanley just got that.
{12390}{12494}It was this photograph of a news vendor|mourning the death of Roosevelt...
{12501}{12589}...that transformed the amateur|into a professional.
{12606}{12694}Stanley was just 16 when he sold|this picture to Look...
{12701}{12769}...one of America's great|illustrated magazines.
{12802}{12905}When he graduated high school,|he joined Look as a photographer...
{12910}{12957}...taking thousands of pictures...
{12963}{13089}...experimenting and gaining experience|for the next stage of his career.
{13883}{13956}Kubrick shot several features|on boxing for Look...
{13969}{14052}...one on the rising young fighter|Walter Cartier.
{14060}{14102}Passionate about the sport...
{14107}{14181}...he realized he'd found|the subject for his first film.
{14306}{14416}Day of the Fight was Stanley's|first effort at filmmaking.
{14422}{14497}I was his assistant on that...
{14502}{14632}...and I'm very proud of the fact|that I operated the second camera...
{14638}{14743}...during the final fight sequence,|which is a real fight.
{14759}{14840}And we were alternating|with each other:
{14846}{14957}I was shooting when he was loading.
{14972}{15062}I got the knockdown|because Stanley was loading.
{15075}{15145}He's done it.|He's KO'd Bobby Jane.
{15161}{15245}This is a fighter, Walter Cartier.
{15250}{15309}He's just moved up one more place...
{15315}{15383}...in a line that may end|with the championship.
{15388}{15477}Following Day of the Fight,|Kubrick quit his job at Look...
{15483}{15540}...and devoted himself|to making films.
{15548}{15620}He moved to Greenwich Village|and supported himself...
{15630}{15745}...by making short documentaries,|hustling chess in Washington Square...
{15752}{15844}...and playing tournaments for money|that wouldn't be enough...
{15850}{15896}...to fund an entire film.
{15901}{16003}In 1953, Kubrick's father cashed in|his life insurance...
{16010}{16091}...to help his son make|Fear and Desire...
{16102}{16158}...a film about a fictitious war.
{16164}{16224}It was Kubrick's first feature.
{16501}{16548}- She'll see us.|- Shut up.
{16806}{16895}He was absolutely|and totally involved...
{16901}{16950}...in the making of this movie.
{16997}{17031}He knew nothing about acting.
{17052}{17096}I probably didn't know much more.
{17107}{17187}He was not a Bohemian.
{17193}{17276}He was not an avant-garde,|left-bank figure.
{17282}{17353}He was a kid from the Bronx|who was smart.
{17358}{17448}I don't think he had much education.|He was a very good chess player.
{17454}{17534}The intensity impressed me.
{17540}{17658}I thought he had a vision|of someplace he was going.
{17666}{17755}Fear and Desire was a youthful|apprentice exercise.
{17761}{17838}Kubrick would later withdraw the film|from circulation.
{17843}{17956}It got him noticed and helped to get|financial backing for his next feature.
{17970}{18060}Killer's Kiss revealed Kubrick's|extraordinary ability...
{18065}{18109}...to play with light.
{18466}{18528}Stanley was making his second film...
{18533}{18620}...and I wanted very much|to be the still photographer.
{18627}{18712}I also wanted to see somebody|discovering and learning.
{18717}{18761}I knew I'd be seeing that.
{18766}{18892}This was Stanley at a point where he|had no physical resources at all.
{18898}{19012}On Fridays, he dismissed the company|for a couple of hours...
{19018}{19122}...went to the unemployment line and|collected his unemployment check...
{19128}{19239}...because that's what he|was living on. It was $30 a week.
{19245}{19280}He just about made it.
{19292}{19379}He was very ambitious and he knew|this was gonna help him...
{19386}{19464}...because once, there was a scene|in the morning, and the crew...
{19472}{19549}...wasn't being paid much either.|Everyone was in a bad mood. He said:
{19603}{19713}"Well, why don't we just take|the afternoon off?"
{19719}{19782}I was amazed he was giving us|the day off.
{19788}{19868}He always drove me home.|So on the ride home, I said:
{19875}{19966}"Why are you always|so nice to everyone?"
{19974}{20098}He said, "Honey, nobody's going to get|anything out of this movie but me."
{20119}{20240}The release of Killer's Kiss brought|Kubrick to James Harris' attention...
{20246}{20334}...an up-and-coming producer|who had access to finance.
{20340}{20407}They teamed up to form|Harris-Kubrick Pictures.
{20412}{20461}The only thing is, we didn't have|anything to do.
{20492}{20562}We had no subject to deal with.
{20567}{20690}That night I left the office|and went to a bookstore...
{20699}{20779}...and found a book|about the robbery of a race track.
{21066}{21107}I don't suppose there's dinner.
{21112}{21184}Of course, darling.|There are all sorts of things.
{21190}{21277}- There's steak, asparagus, potatoes...|- I don't smell nothing.
{21282}{21334}You're too far away from it.
{21341}{21369}Too far away from it?
{21375}{21474}You don't think I had it all cooked,|do you? It's all at the store.
{21494}{21552}I thought he was a kid.
{21594}{21680}Both he and Jim were so very young.
{21687}{21820}I'm guessing, but I think Stanley|was only 26 at the time.
{21834}{21917}I don't think anything was difficult|for Stanley.
{21922}{22020}He had this tremendous confidence|and if he hadn't...
{22026}{22131}...I don't think he could have worked|with Lucien Ballard as he had.
{22138}{22181}The cameraman was Lucien Ballard.
{22187}{22274}Lucien had, I believe,|won an Academy Award...
{22280}{22414}...was regarded as one of the top 12|or so photographers in the business.
{22435}{22545}He was a particularly stylish fellow,|married to Merle Oberon...
{22608}{22659}...a classic example of the old-style|cinematographer.
{22666}{22780}Stanley had done his own photography|on his two previous films...
{22787}{22878}...so he knew exactly what he wanted,|and I think that Ballard...
{22883}{22941}...resented this kid from New York.
{22953}{23049}The first shot of the picture,|first day, first shot...
{23055}{23147}...Stanley set up a shot.|It was quite complex.
{23156}{23230}It was a long dolly shot.
{23235}{23313}And he's lined it up specifically|with a 25 mm lens.
{23319}{23440}He set it up and turned it over|to Lucien and Lucien said, "Fine"...
{23446}{23547}...and began the elaborate business of|lighting and setting a dolly track.
{23554}{23651}Stanley went over to talk to Jimmy|or do something...
{23659}{23780}...and looked back over his shoulder|and noticed that the dolly track...
{23787}{23881}...was much further away|from where he had set the camera.
{23887}{24008}He said to Lucien,|"What are you doing, Lucien?
{24019}{24100}I put the camera here,|you're pulling it way back.
{24105}{24169}Why haven't you put it|where I've asked?"
{24175}{24239}He said, "I haven't changed anything.
{24244}{24294}I'm using a 50 mm lens...
{24298}{24425}...to give you precisely the same|coverage that you've asked for...
{24430}{24496}...but with the 50. It makes...
{24501}{24585}...my job a lot easier and it'll go|a lot faster."
{24590}{24667}Stanley listened to this and said:
{24673}{24781}"What about the change|in perspective that occurs?"
{24787}{24836}He said, "That doesn't matter."
{24841}{24924}That particular piece of information|is dead wrong.
{24930}{25018}The perspective changes.|It's a different shot.
{25023}{25128}Stanley was aware that Lucien was|simply bulling passed him...
{25134}{25231}...but also what particularly|nettled him was the assumption...
{25236}{25323}...that he wouldn't understand this|or wouldn't care about it.
{25330}{25380}Stanley said:
{25402}{25532}"Put the camera where I told you,|with the lens that I asked for...
{25538}{25617}...or get off the set|and don't come back."
{25658}{25729}He said it very quietly,|very softly...
{25735}{25804}...and there was|a look between them...
{25825}{25949}...and Lucien changed the setup and|moved the camera where it had to be...
{25954}{26050}...and there was never an argument|again, about anything.
{26056}{26123}All right, all right,|check it through.
{26139}{26224}I'm sure you'll find our service|to your complete satisfaction.
{26282}{26398}I suppose a lot of what Stanley is,|and what he did...
{26406}{26447}...in more complicated ways|with later films...
{26492}{26599}...is implicit in this simple movie|about a meticulously planned crime.
{26604}{26703}The sense the Sterling Hayden|character has that he's on top of it...
{26710}{26780}...he really knows what he's doing.|At the end of it...
{26787}{26861}...the little yapping dog|gets loose...
{26867}{26945}...and the money|blows all over the place.
{26950}{27011}It's a brilliant|and existential movie.
{27016}{27142}If existentialism basically posits|that we define ourselves by doing...
{27149}{27267}...and that chance is the one thing|we can never quite fully comprehend...
{27273}{27404}...prior to its impinging on our|desires, or plans, or whatever...
{27409}{27457}It's a brilliant statement of that.
{27466}{27519}The Killing was not|a commercial success...
{27525}{27637}...but it did succeed in building|Kubrick and Harris' reputation.
{27643}{27749}When I saw The Killing I said,|"My God.
{27757}{27861}Stanley's gonna make it.|This is good."
{27880}{27964}But it's Paths of Glory|that turned it all around.
{28654}{28696}We walked in the middle,|as we usually did as kids...
{28740}{28781}...Paths of Glory.
{28804}{28884}And myself and my friends,|who were war-film buffs...
{28889}{28976}...we had never seen anything|quite like it, or quite like...
{28982}{29060}...the tone of it.|We'd seen other anti-war films.
{29068}{29135}But this one was so honest...
{29140}{29232}...particularly the trial, and scenes|between Macready and Kirk Douglas.
{29239}{29324}I ordered an attack.|Your troops refused to attack.
{29328}{29393}They did attack,|but they could make no headway.
{29401}{29463}Because they didn't try.|I saw it myself.
{29468}{29509}Half of them never left the trenches.
{29514}{29582}A third of them were pinned down|by the intense fire.
{29588}{29631}Don't quibble over fractions.
{29636}{29737}The fact remains that a good part of|them never left their own trenches.
{29744}{29839}I'm going to have ten men|from each company in your regiment...
{29845}{29914}...tried under penalty of death|for cowardice.
{29923}{29979}- Penalty of death?|- For cowardice.
{29985}{30037}They've skimmed milk in|their veins instead of blood.
{30042}{30104}The reddest milk I've ever seen,|my trenches...
{30110}{30159}- That's enough!|- I won't mince words...
{30165}{30251}If you continue in this manner,|I shall have to put you under arrest.
{30257}{30335}It was so honest that it was shocking.
{30361}{30491}What made it even more shocking|was the nature of the way it was shot.
{30502}{30572}The use of the tracking camera|in the trenches.
{30577}{30652}There's something that's happening.|They're trying to be objective:
{30657}{30727}"I'm just showing you this, man,|make up your own mind.
{30732}{30808}I'm telling you right now,|this is what went down.
{30815}{30867}It's bad, it's a lie, it's hypocrisy."
{30874}{30945}Maybe the attack against the anthill|was impossible.
{30950}{31028}Perhaps it was an error of judgement|on our part...
{31034}{31133}...but if your men had been|more daring, they might have taken it.
{31138}{31266}Why should we have to bear any more|criticism than we have to?
{31273}{31358}Aside from the fact that many|of your men never left the trenches...
{31363}{31416}...is the question|of the troops morale.
{31421}{31463}- The troops morale?|- Certainly.
{31470}{31543}These executions will be a perfect|tonic for the division.
{31548}{31652}There are few things more encouraging|than seeing someone else die.
{31660}{31763}Many artists, when they put|a canvas up which is blank...
{31770}{31842}...they start with very detailed,|small, delicate pencil strokes...
{31901}{31958}...on a canvas.
{31977}{32071}Stanley started conceptually|on all of his movies...
{32076}{32106}...from my point of view...
{32112}{32225}...with large primary-colored|brush strokes...
{32230}{32337}...and he would just beat|out these concepts that were...
{32343}{32379}...that were pretty obvious.
{32389}{32424}In Paths of Glory...
{32429}{32505}...every sequence hammers|its points home...
{32511}{32639}...but in every sequence the filmmaking|is subtle and gentle almost.
{32656}{32714}What really hit us was the end.
{32719}{32810}There's a tendency when you want to|get to that emotion or sentiment...
{32815}{32885}...not sentimental, not|sentimentality, but sentiment...
{32890}{32981}...and just portray this aspect|of humanity...
{32988}{33065}...often you fall into sentimentality.|You really do.
{33073}{33135}It's very, very hard to pull off.
{33141}{33230}This one works like...|You cannot see it without weeping.
{34300}{34381}He was sitting behind his desk|for this interview...
{34399}{34444}...I was to have because he was|looking for an actress...
{34485}{34561}...for that scene in Paths of Glory.
{34648}{34744}You know, I thought he|looked extraordinary.
{34779}{34856}And he just sat there...
{34868}{34956}...beaming at me, grinning at me|throughout the interview...
{34964}{35046}...and I must have grinned back.
{35051}{35137}He's been smiling at me|for 43 years afterwards.
{35153}{35266}Following Paths of Glory, Christiane|and her daughter, Katharina...
{35274}{35345}...moved with Stanley to Los Angeles.
{35350}{35426}Stanley and Christiane|were married in 1958...
{35432}{35501}...and Hollywood would be their home|for the next few years...
{35507}{35617}...where they were to have two more|children, Anya and Vivian.
{35656}{35751}For its damning portrayal|of the French officer class...
{35758}{35847}...Paths of Glory would be banned|in France for nearly 20 years.
{35863}{35958}The film brought its director|firmly to the attention of Hollywood.
{35963}{36022}He was still only 28.
{36051}{36108}This is Stanley Kubrick.
{36113}{36187}I think that if the reigning powers|had any respect for good pictures...
{36192}{36249}...or the people|who could make them...
{36256}{36333}...that this respect was probably|very well tempered...
{36338}{36434}...by the somewhat|cynical observation...
{36442}{36534}...that poor and mediocre pictures|might just as well prove successful...
{36542}{36615}...as their pictures of higher value.
{36621}{36690}Television has changed|this completely.
{36696}{36806}And I think that despite|the unhappy financial upheaval...
{36810}{36863}...it's caused|in the movie industry...
{36868}{36994}...it's also provided a invigorating|and stimulating challenge...
{37000}{37101}...which has made it necessary for|films to be made with more sincerity...
{37108}{37151}...and more daring.
{37168}{37297}If Hollywood lacks the color|and excitement of its early days...
{37306}{37378}...with Rolls-Royces|and leopard-skin seat covers...
{37383}{37498}...on the other hand it provides|the most stimulating atmosphere...
{37503}{37580}...of opportunity and possibilities|for young people.
{37588}{37623}Slaves...
{37657}{37729}...you have arrived at the gladiatorial|school of Lentulus Batiatus.
{37735}{37831}Here you will be trained by experts|to fight in pairs to the death.
{37837}{37910}You won't be required to fight|to the death here.
{37915}{37958}That will only be after you're sold...
{37963}{38008}...and then for people of quality.
{38013}{38083}Those who appreciate a fine kill.
{38114}{38149}A gladiator's like a stallion.
{38161}{38199}He must be pampered.
{38205}{38320}You'll be oiled, bathed, shaved,|massaged...
{38325}{38380}...taught to use your heads.
{38398}{38483}A good body with a dull brain is as|cheap as life itself.
{38495}{38600}I congratulate you, and may fortune|smile on most of you.
{38605}{38700}Then Kirk Douglas came to us and was|having trouble with Spartacus.
{38706}{38776}He had shot for three days...
{38781}{38863}...and wanted to replace the director|who was on the film...
{38869}{39005}...and asked if Stanley could be|acquired, sort of on a loan-out basis.
{39010}{39096}We thought it'd be good for his career|and for our company.
{39101}{39191}I thought he did an incredible job|of taking that film...
{39197}{39292}...which the script didn't even have|battle sequences in it...
{39297}{39381}...and sort of did some recasting|of some of the parts...
{39386}{39481}...took some of the film to Spain|and did the big battle scenes...
{39488}{39549}...and turned it|into a marvelous epic film.
{39555}{39627}I was rather dreading the arrival|of Stanley. I didn't know him...
{39661}{39726}...but I had seen Paths of Glory...
{39731}{39803}...which I find one of the best|films I've ever seen.
{39810}{39906}In spite of your vices you are|the most generous Roman of our time.
{39917}{39961}Vices?
{40010}{40039}Ladies.
{40116}{40177}Ladies. Since when are they a vice?
{40183}{40304}I had a high opinion of him but also|had a great affection for Tony Mann.
{40310}{40403}Tony Mann directed the early parts|of the film...
{40408}{40527}...the ones in Death Valley,|which I think probably the studio...
{40533}{40635}...wanted the reassurance of an older,|more routine man.
{40643}{40724}Kirk always had the idea|of wanting Stanley.
{40729}{40840}It was a difficult task because|we all had different acting styles.
{40845}{40966}Olivier and Laughton hated each other.|It was like two dogs.
{40973}{41071}I'll take republican corruption|along with republican freedom...
{41077}{41178}...but I won't take|the dictatorship of Crassus...
{41183}{41233}...and no freedom at all!
{41288}{41392}That's what he's out for,|and that's why he'll be back.
{41397}{41473}I think he was 30 years old|when he did it.
{41483}{41576}Yeah, working with Olivier and|Charles Laughton. He was fearless.
{41586}{41712}If he was terrified, he didn't show it,|because he knew he mustn't.
{41717}{41795}I think he had|an extraordinary ability...
{41800}{41871}...to concentrate|on what is important...
{41877}{41942}...he did not allow himself|to be sidetracked.
{41962}{42061}And even if it was|emotional turmoil...
{42067}{42131}...and great worry he wouldn't...
{42137}{42219}Perhaps it's a chess-playing thing...|He wouldn't allow it...
{42225}{42276}...to influence him.
{42283}{42350}And I think that very soon|the actors noticed:
{42356}{42426}"Oh, yeah, you know,|we're quite safe."
{42434}{42497}Traveled a long ways together.
{42512}{42564}Fought many battles.
{42575}{42629}Won great victories.
{42634}{42743}Now, instead of taking ship for our|homes across the sea...
{42752}{42818}...we must fight again.
{42835}{42897}Maybe there's no peace in this world...
{42902}{42980}...for us or for anyone else.|I don't know.
{43011}{43057}But I do know...
{43063}{43120}...that as long as we live...
{43126}{43194}...we must stay true to ourselves.
{43200}{43237}Its great virtue was...
{43244}{43351}...it was the only film of that kind|that didn't have Jesus in it.
{43356}{43443}There was no trace of Christianity|in Spartacus really.
{43448}{43527}There was faith, but not Christianity.
{43533}{43656}If Kirk wants to be rewarded for his|courage, which I'd be the first...
{43663}{43754}...to make a film like that|without Jesus but with Kubrick...
{43760}{43814}...is already|a tremendous achievement.
{43829}{43889}I think they were both temperamental.
{43896}{43955}Neither of them would give an inch...
{43981}{44007}...so there was tension.
{44015}{44120}But he was uncomfortable|during the making of that film.
{44126}{44214}But not necessarily|because of Kirk alone.
{44219}{44293}It's because he had|no rights over the script.
{44298}{44371}All those things he'd got|used to and fought for having...
{44376}{44423}...he didn't have, he had no say.
{44432}{44552}Stanley was unhappy|because he was dealing...
{44557}{44696}...with the star who was the producer|and in charge of the production.
{44702}{44761}There were certain instances...
{44803}{44864}...where he felt that things|should be done differently...
{44869}{44948}...but because Kirk was in charge...
{44954}{45018}...they were done Kirk's way.
{45025}{45106}I'm not saying that Kirk|was wrong or right...
{45112}{45185}...but nevertheless, Stanley said:
{45191}{45268}"From now on, I want to do pictures...
{45273}{45341}...where I really have final cut."
{45356}{45441}The first overseas premier|of UI's screen epic Spartacus...
{45447}{45536}...is the most brilliant event|on London's show business calendar.
{45541}{45603}Director Stanley Kubrick...
{45611}{45691}Spartacus was a critical|and commercial success...
{45699}{45738}...winning four Oscars.
{45754}{45795}Despite Kubrick's youth...
{45801}{45884}...he was now a recognized|Hollywood director.
{45889}{46020}But the process had taught him he had|to have full control over his films.
{46026}{46159}I had a feeling that during Spartacus|he was biding his time...
{46166}{46265}...getting on the record|as the director...
{46270}{46336}...of a big and successful film...
{46342}{46392}...which would give him|greater freedom in the future.
{46417}{46539}And he did turn his career|into that of an artist...
{46546}{46658}...whereas it could quite easily,|had he surrendered at any juncture...
{46666}{46739}...have been that|of a very successful journeyman.
{46746}{46845}He felt now he had this label:|"I'm a film director, officially.
{46850}{46976}Now I can make a story|that I have a crush on."
{47233}{47319}The interpretation of the image,|where to place the camera...
{47325}{47398}...the nature of the subject matter...
{47419}{47505}...which at that time, everything was|opening up in the early '60s...
{47510}{47555}...and it was scandalous.
{47560}{47598}Put your head back.
{47605}{47647}Put your head back.
{47681}{47720}Open your mouth.
{47731}{47768}You can have one little bite.
{47773}{47801}I think what a lot of people forget...
{47839}{47927}...is just what a hot book|Lolita was.
{47934}{48051}Originally, Nabokov couldn't get|a publisher in the States or the UK...
{48056}{48126}...so it was published|as a dirty book in Paris.
{48132}{48261}It was in 1955 that Graham Greene|and The Sunday Times in London...
{48268}{48331}...nominated it as his|novel of the year.
{48337}{48419}It then took off|and it very soon found a publisher.
{48427}{48510}He thought Lolita|was a fantastic book...
{48518}{48598}...because it clarified|the feeling we all have...
{48603}{48694}...that good and evil does not|come in the expected package.
{48923}{48972}I guess I won't be seeing you again.
{49023}{49065}I shall be moving on.
{49071}{49159}I must prepare for my work|at Beardsley College in the fall.
{49177}{49229}Then I guess this is goodbye.
{49290}{49322}Yes.
{49351}{49389}Don't forget me.
{49539}{49641}It shocks me when people say|Stanley didn't make "people" movies.
{49646}{49736}He made movies about machines or...
{49742}{49778}It's always confounded me.
{49791}{49881}Lolita is, you know,|nothing like the book.
{49887}{49994}But he did draft the author|to write the screenplay.
{50000}{50062}They were in collaboration|with each other...
{50067}{50148}...in another kind of version|away from the novel...
{50157}{50244}...that is much more about the human|condition than the novel was.
{50254}{50291}Lolita works...
{50296}{50400}...as the very first|Stanley Kubrick film for me...
{50405}{50491}...because I couldn't imagine|anybody else making Lolita.
{50496}{50570}It's a comedy but it's got|serious elements.
{50638}{50662}It's risqué. It's in your face.
{50668}{50730}It's got big performances...
{50747}{50786}...and it works completely.
{50792}{50916}You're a disgusting, despicable,|loathsome, criminal fraud!
{50922}{50955}Don't do that.
{50979}{51024}- Can we discuss...|- Get out of my way.
{51038}{51085}- Get out of my way!|- No. I want to talk...
{51091}{51161}Go on, get out of my way.
{51188}{51237}I'm leaving here today.
{51260}{51303}You can have all of it.
{51308}{51418}But you are never going to see|that miserable brat again!
{51425}{51524}At a time when American cinema in the|early '60s was on the way down...
{51530}{51589}...the studio system was finishing...
{51594}{51698}...this was a man with authority making|you look a certain way at things.
{51702}{51738}"When I stood Adam-naked..."
{51743}{51791}Adam-naked!
{51796}{51865}You should be ashamed of yourself,|captain.
{51871}{51960}"Before a federal law|and all its stinging stars."
{51965}{52007}Tarnation! You old horn toad.
{52012}{52107}That's mighty pretty.|That's a pretty poem.
{52113}{52172}"Because you took advantage..."
{52177}{52223}It's getting a bit repetitious,|isn't it?
{52228}{52332}"Because..." Here's another one:|"Because you cheated me."
{52338}{52396}Because you took her at an age...
{52416}{52459}...when young lads..."|- That's enough!
{52478}{52583}Say, what'd you take it away for?|It was getting kind of smutty there.
{52589}{52632}Because of its scandalous theme...
{52638}{52705}...the film had|a crippling distribution problem.
{52710}{52774}The Catholic Church had|their own censorship.
{52779}{52878}If they condemned your film,|they would then send notices...
{52883}{53009}...to their Churches, the Catholic|Churches all over the country...
{53014}{53077}...that it would be sinful|to see this film.
{53083}{53184}Hum, you just touch me|and I go as limp as a noodle.
{53190}{53216}It scares me.
{53222}{53252}Yes, I know the feeling.
{53259}{53354}That held up the film for six months|because they did condemn it.
{53365}{53477}There was a picture of Lolita|on the bedside stand...
{53483}{53570}...so when Humbert|and his wife Charlotte were in bed...
{53576}{53709}...they felt that Humbert was using|the picture for sexual stimulation.
{53717}{53827}I denied that. I think that in all|fairness they were right.
{53833}{53952}Anyway, we agreed to limit the number|of looks at that picture.
{53969}{54060}To get a release,|Kubrick had to re-cut Lolita.
{54072}{54121}As he later told Newsweek:
{54127}{54189}"Had I known how severe|the limitations were...
{54194}{54230}...I wouldn't have made it."
{54250}{54310}There is acclaim in the film world|for Kubrick...
{54316}{54397}...director of Lolita,|arriving with Mrs. Kubrick.
{54403}{54476}Lolita's strong performance|at the box office...
{54482}{54554}...was boosted by the controversy.
{54561}{54634}Kubrick's next film would prove|even more controversial.
{54640}{54684}Now then, Dimitri...
{54743}{54828}...you know how we've always talked|about the possibility...
{54834}{54898}...of something going|wrong with the bomb.
{54934}{54988}The bomb, Dimitri.
{55013}{55071}The hydrogen bomb.
{55077}{55136}Everything wonderful|about that movie...
{55171}{55249}...is because of the way|it was directed.
{55254}{55380}Otherwise, I thought there were flaws|in the writing of the movie...
{55387}{55461}...and flaws in some|of the performances...
{55466}{55587}...but the directing of the movie|was so bravura...
{55593}{55707}...and so superb that it just,|it was just a knockout.
{55716}{55834}The vision and the use of music|of the opening credits...
{55841}{55910}We knew immediately anything|could happen in this movie.
{56211}{56286}People remember the film because it|deals with one of the darkest things...
{56332}{56432}...of the postwar period,|the idea that hanging over us...
{56438}{56545}...was nuclear oblivion. This is the|time of the Cuban Missile Crisis.
{56551}{56667}It can't have possibly got|closer than those few days...
{56673}{56797}...where one mistake by either side|could have started World War III.
{56802}{56908}This piece of satire just hit it|right on the button...
{56913}{56996}...and it was frightening.|Very, very frightening.
{57003}{57065}Well, now, what happened is...
{57072}{57176}...one of our base commanders,|he had a sort of...
{57181}{57259}Well, he went a little funny|in the head.
{57264}{57385}You know, just a little funny.
{57390}{57456}He went and did a silly thing.
{57468}{57568}Well, I'll tell you what he did,|he ordered his planes...
{57606}{57668}...to attack your country.
{57680}{57729}Well, let me finish, Dimitri.
{57755}{57802}Let me finish, Dimitri.
{57816}{57871}Well, how do you think|I feel about it?
{57877}{57926}He was able to say|what we all knew...
{58013}{58058}...about the madness of it.
{58063}{58168}He had bought the book and was|trying to make it straight...
{58176}{58268}...and realized that he couldn't,|that it was so utterly insane...
{58274}{58344}...that it couldn't be done that way.
{58349}{58435}And what he did was say that.|That this is insane, I mean...
{58440}{58480}...who are we kidding?
{58585}{58658}Gentlemen, you can't fight in here.|This is the war room!
{58663}{58768}And it ever after made it|very difficult...
{58774}{58865}...to take seriously|the Strategic Air Command.
{58870}{58962}I mean, they seemed like they|were nuts from then on.
{58968}{59019}I think they probably were.
{59027}{59121}The most extraordinary part|of Dr. Strangelove for me...
{59128}{59221}...was that 30 years on as part|of a BBC team, I investigated...
{59228}{59325}...over a period of two years, many|of the central tenets in the film.
{59331}{59374}What had happened in reality...
{59381}{59472}...what had happened to Strategic|Air Command in the '50s and '60s.
{59477}{59603}And the various elements of the film|like the idea that the military...
{59608}{59717}...would use nuclear weapons|without consulting the president...
{59723}{59850}I thought only I was in authority|to order the use of nuclear weapons.
{59883}{59978}That's right, sir. You are the only|person authorized to do so...
{59983}{60094}...and although I hate to judge|before all the facts are in...
{60099}{60180}...it looks like General|Ripper exceeded his authority.
{60186}{60295}...were all, you know, seen as|appalling when that film came out.
{60300}{60395}Now we know many of those elements|were absolutely smack-on.
{60400}{60505}Curtis LeMay did a test run to see if|you could provoke the Russians to war.
{60542}{60623}We talked to an officer who worked|for LeMay's successor...
{60630}{60724}...General Tommy Power, and they|said this guy was basically psychotic.
{60729}{60802}This has not come out for 30 years,|but there it is...
{60808}{60852}...right in the core of Strangelove.
{60858}{60938}Tell me, Jack, when|did you first become...
{60945}{61006}Well, develop this theory?
{61100}{61181}I first became aware of it,|Mandrake...
{61193}{61247}...during the physical act of love.
{61282}{61389}Yes, a profound sense of fatigue...
{61396}{61447}...feeling of emptiness followed.
{61468}{61563}Luckily, I was able to interpret|these feelings correctly:
{61589}{61628}Loss of essence.
{61675}{61747}I can assure you|it has not recurred, Mandrake.
{61765}{61855}Women... Women sense my power...
{61871}{61923}...and they seek the life essence.
{61955}{62010}I don't avoid women, Mandrake...
{62047}{62109}...but I do deny them my essence.
{62158}{62262}The other films that were being made|at the time about these themes...
{62268}{62330}...about the idea of nuclear war...
{62368}{62406}...military takeover in the USA.
{62413}{62495}Films like Fail Safe|and Seven Days in May...
{62500}{62579}...they're very naturalistic|and rather turgid films.
{62585}{62659}They have no longevity.|They don't endure.
{62665}{62730}They're not films|that you would watch...
{62736}{62815}...for any reason|except out of sociological interest.
{62821}{62929}But people will watch Dr. Strangelove|repeatedly because it's so funny.
{62934}{63069}That was the genius of Kubrick,|but also his collaborators.
{63074}{63193}I mean, he had the massive fortune|to be working with...
{63199}{63293}...two of the funniest people ever|involved in the film industry:
{63298}{63370}Terry Southern and Peter Sellers.
{63376}{63466}What's happened, you see,|the string in my leg's gone.
{63492}{63535}- The what?|- The string.
{63541}{63587}I never told you, but, you see...
{63592}{63686}...I've got a gammy leg.|Oh, dear, gone shot off.
{63705}{63765}Stanley was his best audience.
{63770}{63854}He spent many of the scenes|just being an audience...
{63860}{63887}...not a director.
{63893}{63968}He would simply put cameras|everywhere he could...
{63975}{64038}...so when Peter|was off flying high...
{64047}{64118}...Stanley says, "I don't want|anything to be lost."
{64124}{64231}He would just lie on his back,|you know, roaring with laughter.
{64238}{64335}That egged Peter on|to ever greater heights.
{64438}{64535}Also, when you go down into the|mine, everyone will still be alive.
{64542}{64589}There will be no shocking memories...
{64597}{64703}...and the prevailing emotion will be|nostalgia for those left behind...
{64708}{64780}...combined with a spirit...
{64786}{64861}...of bold curiosity|for the adventure ahead.
{64894}{65027}One of the great things about his film|is the scrupulous detail...
{65032}{65123}...in which everything... You know,|that's part of the power of it...
{65129}{65226}...the detail in Dr. Strangelove,|you know, you would think...
{65231}{65297}...that he'd lived through|that experience.
{65306}{65388}Survival kit contents check.
{65401}{65515}In them you will find|one.45 caliber automatic...
{65520}{65580}...two boxes of ammunition...
{65585}{65668}...four days concentrated emergency|rations...
{65674}{65754}...one drug issue|containing antibiotics...
{65760}{65861}...morphine, vitamin pills,|pep pills...
{65870}{65963}...sleeping pills,|tranquilizer pills...
{65980}{66086}...one miniature combination|Russian phrase book and Bible.
{66098}{66160}While we were shooting,|somebody had invited...
{66166}{66277}...some American service personnel|to come to Shepperton.
{66312}{66386}They were terrified...
{66391}{66474}...by the amount of accuracy|we had in this aircraft...
{66480}{66568}...and the next day I got a memo|from Stanley saying:
{66574}{66705}"You better make sure that you know|where all your references came from...
{66713}{66814}...because otherwise we might be|investigated by the FBI."
{66844}{66900}I discovered very quickly...
{66906}{67001}...that behind|this boyish enthusiasm...
{67023}{67132}...and apparent naiveté,|there was this super brain...
{67137}{67187}...and enormous power...
{67253}{67388}...and utter dedication|to moviemaking.
{67408}{67531}It was quite demoralizing at|times when he changed his mind...
{67537}{67620}...but every time he did,|it was for the better.
{67625}{67718}But I learned a great deal|on that film.
{67770}{67818}Sir, I have a plan.
{67866}{67910}Mien Fuhrer!
{67927}{67976}I can walk!
{68376}{68431}I was kind of shocked by it at first.
{68436}{68513}It was so irreverent, and it was|the height of the Cold War.
{68521}{68631}I was at NYU at the time,|but my friends I saw the film with...
{68637}{68739}...some were at a Jesuit college called|Fordham, others were street kids.
{68746}{68802}We went to see this movie.|They loved it.
{68808}{68856}And they were conservative.
{68861}{68917}The word on the street was,|"It's great."
{68922}{69012}I had a kind of a giddy exhilaration|at the end.
{69019}{69139}When she was singing,|"We'll meet again, don't know where"
{69144}{69188}And he's riding the bomb, I thought:
{69237}{69346}"Man, what kind of an imagination|came up with this?"
{69367}{69443}Dr. Strangelove caused uproar.
{69451}{69534}Younger audiences loved its|irreverence and anarchic humor...
{69539}{69612}...but many people saw it|as dangerously subversive.
{69617}{69747}I remember reading a review in,|I think, a Beverly Hills paper...
{69752}{69847}...where the critic said that Stanley|should be physically harmed...
{69853}{69889}...for having made that film.
{69895}{69969}Now, that's a pretty bad review,|I must say.
{69978}{70051}I can't remember|any Stanley Kubrick movie...
{70056}{70129}...that was released|where there wasn't controversy.
{70140}{70199}2001 I remember very well.
{70206}{70291}I remember Pauline Kael's|review of 2001.
{70297}{70335}They were not good reviews.
{70341}{70447}And then ten years go by,|and they're all classics.
{70452}{70547}By that time I knew|that Kubrick was the one.
{70564}{70695}Yes, all these extraordinary directors|around the world were making films...
{70704}{70816}...but there was something, after you|saw Lolita and Dr. Strangelove...
{70834}{70930}I knew that Kubrick...|We had to wait for a Kubrick film.
{70936}{71020}We knew that when we went to see it...
{71025}{71090}...that it was extremely special.
{71095}{71209}We expected a lot from him, quite|honestly, and in 2001 we got it.
{71222}{71311}By 1963, Kubrick had established|so high a reputation...
{71316}{71432}...that he could pick his next project|without bowing to Hollywood dictates.
{71448}{71546}As a director whose films were|popular and critically acclaimed...
{71550}{71647}...he had won an astonishing degree|of creative independence.
{71664}{71720}Stanley Kubrick now began work|on a film...
{71727}{71813}...which would establish him|as one of the great film directors.
{71825}{71906}With 2001: A Space Odyssey...
{71926}{72032}...the boy from the Bronx would write|a new chapter in cinema history.
{72061}{72183}In the early 1960s, space exploration|began when both Russia and the U. S...
{72189}{72265}...sent men outside the Earth's|atmosphere.
{72271}{72367}As the space race came to dominate|the popular imagination...
{72379}{72481}...Kubrick captured the spirit of the|times by collaborating on a film...
{72488}{72575}...with the science fiction writer,|Arthur C. Clarke.
{72595}{72711}Behind everyone alive today|stand 30 ghosts...
{72716}{72850}...for that is the ratio by which|the dead outnumber the living.
{72857}{72943}Since the dawn of time, about|a hundred billion human beings...
{72979}{73029}...have walked on this planet.
{73034}{73155}Now, a hundred billion|is about the number of stars...
{73162}{73216}...in our Milky Way galaxy.
{73223}{73296}So this means that for everyone|who has ever lived...
{73301}{73346}...there could be a star.
{73352}{73462}And of course, stars are suns,|with planets circling around them.
{73479}{73576}So isn't it an interesting thought|that there's enough land in the sky...
{73582}{73660}...for everyone to have a whole world?
{73666}{73742}We don't know how many of those worlds|are inhabited...
{73747}{73807}...and by what kind of creatures.
{73812}{73903}But one day we should know,|perhaps by radio...
{73908}{74012}...perhaps by other means,|perhaps by direct contact.
{74019}{74114}The impact of that on the human race|will be profound...
{74119}{74213}...especially if we encounter|creatures far in advance...
{74218}{74272}...of our own primitive species.
{74279}{74396}It's a wonderful thing to look forward|to and perhaps a terrifying one.
{74401}{74511}It may happen in our lifetimes.|It may not happen for 1000 years.
{74517}{74594}But one day, we will know|the truth about...
{74600}{74692}...this incredible and wonderful|universe around us...
{74697}{74790}...and perhaps understand our|own place in it.
{74803}{74927}The extraordinary audacity,|power and, I think, guts...
{74933}{75037}...to say, "Let's screech everything|to a halt, take everybody...
{75044}{75120}...back to prehistoric times|where it wasn't that fast."
{75126}{75244}Considering the way the world was|moving so quickly, this just said:
{75251}{75281}"I want you to see something.
{75286}{75385}I'll take you through something|you never thought you'd experience."
{76639}{76751}His way of making a film was|to concentrate...
{76764}{76875}...on seven or eight, as he called|them, "non-submersible units."
{76881}{76966}And what this meant was you had a very|good chunk, and you had another...
{77024}{77108}...and when you had six good chunks,|you were almost home with a movie.
{77113}{77194}It would be easy to connect them,|and...
{77200}{77269}...you can see|this principle operating...
{77275}{77349}...in particular in 2001...
{77358}{77476}...where I believe that the bits|don't quite fit on.
{77499}{77626}And this is why there's a mystery|about it that still interests people.
{77631}{77707}I just remember seeing the picture|for the first time...
{77714}{77808}...and feeling that it wasn't a movie,|it was the first time...
{77813}{77888}...that the motion picture form|had been changed.
{77895}{78006}It wasn't a documentary,|and it wasn't a drama...
{78012}{78086}...and it wasn't really|science fiction.
{78113}{78165}It was more science eventuality.
{78173}{78269}Hal, despite your enormous intellect,|are you ever frustrated...
{78274}{78350}...by your dependence on people|to carry out actions?
{78356}{78412}Not in the slightest bit.
{78419}{78471}I enjoy working with people.
{78477}{78581}I have a stimulating relationship|with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.
{78593}{78698}My mission responsibilities range over|the entire operation of the ship...
{78714}{78779}...so I am constantly occupied.
{78791}{78879}I am putting myself|to the fullest possible use...
{78886}{78983}...which is all, I think, that any|conscious entity can ever hope to do.
{78990}{79056}Unlike many|a science fiction writer...
{79062}{79119}...including, I must say, myself...
{79124}{79203}...he regarded|the future as unknowable.
{79210}{79335}This is the first movie, the first work|of science fiction that actually...
{79341}{79432}...I think, depicts the future|as unknowable.
{79440}{79496}Eighteen months ago...
{79522}{79624}...the first evidence|of intelligent life off the Earth...
{79631}{79664}...was discovered.
{79716}{79807}It was buried 40 feet|below the lunar surface...
{79814}{79868}...near the crater Tycho.
{79935}{80017}Except for a single, very powerful...
{80023}{80114}...radio emission aimed at Jupiter...
{80152}{80272}...the four-million-year-old monolith|has remained completely inert...
{80323}{80403}...its origin and purpose...
{80410}{80462}...still a total mystery.
{80473}{80516}I respect in awe...
{80548}{80581}I'm in awe of the mystery|of the universe.
{80586}{80649}Something which Einstein's often said:
{80655}{80787}"Anyone who isn't awed by the universe,|they haven't any soul."
{80793}{80931}So from my earliest days the wonder|of space and time has intrigued me...
{80936}{81053}...and Stanley and I tried to put some|of this feeling into the film.
{81069}{81159}I think it made people realize|that we were...
{81166}{81247}...a rather small part|of an enormous universe.
{81252}{81316}It's hard to realize|when we made that film...
{81322}{81427}...we didn't know what Earth looked|like from space from any distance.
{81433}{81480}These things had to be imagined.
{81487}{81608}The special effects were a quantum|leap forward for the film industry.
{81618}{81659}These looked the real thing.
{81666}{81753}Stanley had very firm|and very specific ideas...
{81760}{81829}...about how these models|were to be lit.
{81834}{81902}The painstaking attention to detail...
{81907}{81992}...the coloration,|the dirtying up of the models...
{81999}{82060}This really hadn't been seen before.
{82071}{82141}One of the best examples|for my contribution...
{82178}{82245}...is what's known as the slitscan|sequence, the stargate sequence.
{82250}{82313}There was a lot of evolution|to that concept...
{82319}{82428}...of how you would be transported|from one dimension to another.
{82434}{82482}It was never solved in the screenplay.
{82489}{82568}I remembered, knowing|of an experimental filmmaker...
{82573}{82682}...who was exploring this whole idea|of long-time exposures...
{82687}{82792}...and while the shutter is open,|he'd move various kinds of artwork...
{82797}{82856}...in front of the camera|to scan...
{82862}{82967}...color blocks|and objects onto the film...
{82972}{83022}...in a rather unusual way.
{83028}{83152}I thought if you took what he did,|which was flat and two-dimensional...
{83157}{83255}...and made it three-dimensional|in the Z axis...
{83260}{83328}...you could create|this streak exposure.
{83334}{83414}Like a time exposure.|Car headlights on the freeway.
{83420}{83470}If you leave the shutter open...
{83476}{83549}...the car headlight becomes|a streak of light.
{83557}{83632}It occurred to me that|there might be some way...
{83639}{83698}...to apply that|to the stargate sequence.
{83703}{83798}I walked that minute|down to Stanley's office.
{83803}{83874}I said, "I think this is the answer|to the stargate."
{83880}{83977}And he looked at it and said,|"I think you could be right."
{83983}{84099}He said, "Do whatever you need to do,|you have carte blanche to do it."
{84107}{84189}That's an example of my whole|experience on 2001...
{84195}{84305}...was support from Stanley|to explore, experiment...
{84310}{84420}...take risks and produce|something that was different.
{84425}{84561}If you can imagine a giant Ferris|wheel, and if you were to cover it...
{84566}{84625}...with a skin.|On the inside edge of that skin...
{84657}{84707}...imagine the set being built...
{84712}{84839}...and imagine an endless hallway|with things along the side.
{84845}{84894}Well, that revolved.
{84950}{85037}There's a scene where|I come down a ladder...
{85057}{85153}...and the other astronaut,|Gary Lockwood, is eating...
{85157}{85270}...apparently upside down, because he's|on the other side of the centrifuge.
{85277}{85383}It looks like I walk|upside down to him.
{85388}{85505}How that actually was done was that|Gary had a hidden harness.
{85512}{85602}He was upside down,|so I came in right-side up...
{85607}{85733}...and they just revolved Gary down|to me, and I just walked in place.
{85739}{85825}There was this theme of constant|rotating, rotating, rotating.
{85834}{85912}The space station and|the spacecraft are rotating.
{85919}{85954}Everything's in orbit.
{85959}{86045}And that established a style...
{86076}{86174}...of intercuttable shots|that ultimately later...
{86179}{86275}...leant itself in Stanley's mind|to the Strauss waltz.
{86892}{86975}I think the history of the cinema|divides into two essential eras:
{87019}{87088}Before Stanley Kubrick|and after Stanley Kubrick.
{87093}{87181}Especially in relation|to the use of music in films.
{87188}{87308}Before Stanley Kubrick, music tended|to be used in films...
{87315}{87410}...as either decorative|or as heightening emotions.
{87418}{87529}After Stanley Kubrick, because of his|use of classical music in particular...
{87535}{87637}...it became absolutely an essential|part of the narrative...
{87642}{87710}...intellectual drive of the film.
{88023}{88098}I actually knew that piece of Ligeti|he used...
{88105}{88177}...and I remember seeing 2001|and thinking:
{88183}{88274}"This can't possibly be Ligeti|in a Hollywood film."
{88282}{88404}But it was, and of course, it makes|the sequence utterly unforgettable.
{88649}{88742}It was for me,|especially the visual fantasy...
{88814}{88907}...with the speed, with the color|and light changes...
{88913}{88992}...when the spaceship goes down...
{88998}{89066}...on the moon of Jupiter.
{89099}{89199}And then the speed is more and more|and more...
{89205}{89276}...and it was very clear...
{89281}{89359}...that Dr. Einstein pretended...
{89363}{89473}...that the light velocity is|the highest, you cannot go beyond.
{89480}{89572}But in this film it was suggested|as it would be...
{89577}{89701}...beyond the speed of light and then|we enter in another world.
{89722}{89826}I never know whether the images|arose out of the music or vice versa.
{89832}{89946}The true thing to say is that they|became in his imagination, clearly...
{89954}{90043}...and so have become in ours,|totally inseparable.
{91874}{91962}When 2001 opened,|like previous films of Kubrick's...
{91967}{92039}...it split both the critics|and the audience.
{92044}{92140}The opening of 2001|was very frightening...
{92147}{92241}...because we had all the executives|sitting in the audience...
{92247}{92291}...very old, many of them.
{92320}{92446}They didn't understand the film at|all and left, whole rows of them.
{92452}{92567}And we were panic stricken.|Then there was an enormous...
{92573}{92665}...catastrophic meeting|in our hotel room...
{92670}{92732}...and Stanley was so upset|he lost his voice.
{92738}{92833}We were up all night. The next|morning we went to this house...
{92856}{92946}...and Stanley was battling on|in New York.
{92953}{93055}I fell, clutching my handbag,|across...
{93060}{93139}...my bed asleep,|because I hadn't slept all night.
{93145}{93274}And woke up to the sounds of a DJ...
{93280}{93317}...saying:
{93323}{93430}"This is the most fantastic film and|people are queuing around the block."
{93435}{93488}He was talking about 2001.
{93493}{93576}I was desperately trying|to ring Stanley to tell him...
{93581}{93710}...some people like it, it was the|blue-rinse brigade that walked out.
{93717}{93792}He told me that the first...
{93848}{93908}...exhibitor screening of 2001...
{93914}{94034}...had, I believe|he said, 241 walkouts.
{94049}{94139}You know, I'm sure he|counted them too.
{94152}{94225}When I first saw 2001,|I didn't like it...
{94233}{94284}...and I was very disappointed.
{94335}{94472}Then three or four months later,|I was with some woman in California...
{94477}{94554}...and she was telling me|what a wonderful film it was.
{94560}{94623}And I went to see it again...
{94628}{94732}...and I liked it a lot more|the second time I saw it.
{94738}{94828}Then a couple of years later|I saw it again and I thought:
{94834}{94930}"Gee, this is really|a sensational movie."
{94937}{95058}And it was one of the few times|in my life that I realized...
{95065}{95136}...that the artist|was much ahead of me.
{95142}{95209}A lot of people didn't get it|the first time around...
{95216}{95330}...and I'm really fond of quoting|the MGM executive who said:
{95336}{95402}"Well, that's the end|of Stanley Kubrick."
{95423}{95558}The message has got over, even though|we didn't intend one specifically.
{95608}{95672}Stanley wanted to create|an experience.
{95743}{95875}People will get messages from it|according to their own philosophies.
{95881}{96008}2001 received a National Catholic|Award for its imaginative vision...
{96014}{96084}...of mans' creative encounter|with the universe.
{96089}{96153}Some turnaround for Kubrick,|who had so upset...
{96159}{96234}...the Catholic legion of decency|with Lolita.
{96241}{96338}2001 also won an Academy Award|for best visual effects.
{96345}{96403}As the film's director and designer...
{96409}{96487}...Kubrick received|his only ever Oscar.
{96494}{96577}It was that kind of process...
{96584}{96678}...of personally taking|control of not only the people...
{96685}{96769}...the technology, the art|and the craft of making movies.
{96775}{96844}He was it.|He embodied the whole thing.
{96848}{96930}And he invited actors,|cinematographers...
{96935}{97055}...and production designers to come|into his family and collaborate...
{97060}{97105}...which for some was difficult.
{97111}{97238}After working with him on 2001, I|swore I'd never work for anybody again.
{97244}{97306}Stanley was a hell of a taskmaster.
{97318}{97364}He was difficult and demanding.
{97370}{97502}His level of quality control was|just astronomically near perfection.
{97508}{97570}I found, as a young guy, this was hard.
{97574}{97685}His mind was so insatiable|and so active...
{97693}{97785}...that he could barely sleep,|he could barely stop.
{97792}{97901}I saw that Stanley Kubrick worked|and lived his work seven days a week...
{97907}{97949}...almost 24 hours a day.
{97956}{98040}And I think he had a hard time|keeping up with his own intellect.
{98070}{98148}Kubrick now turned to a mighty|historical character...
{98156}{98279}...whose triumphs, failures and|personality fascinated him: Napoleon.
{98285}{98406}Napoleon is still in his grave,|waiting to be brought back to life.
{98411}{98505}I wonder what Napoleon would think|of Lou Wasserman and David Picker.
{98528}{98636}Whether he would've liked to have them|passing judgement on his life.
{98641}{98720}Napoleon represented for him...
{98725}{98781}...the worldly genius...
{98787}{98870}...that, at the same time, failed.
{98875}{98994}Stanley was fascinated by the fact|that somebody so intelligent...
{99041}{99124}...and so talented,|could make such mistakes.
{99129}{99250}He liked comparing war and chess...
{99258}{99371}...and making films, and the idea|of seeing everything as a battle.
{99377}{99492}All directors like battle analogies|for movies...
{99500}{99615}...and certainly nobody planned...
{99632}{99702}...with the mixed results.
{99708}{99771}When somebody that meticulous|plans something...
{99776}{99838}...anything that goes wrong|seems to wreak havoc.
{99868}{99991}If Stanley was afraid of anything, it|was of making that kind of mistake...
{99997}{100079}...where you get carried away|without checking.
{100085}{100129}There was the chess player in him.
{100137}{100217}Maybe that's why|he took so long between films.
{100224}{100347}The Napoleon project was well-prepared.|We were ready to go to Romania...
{100355}{100489}...where we could have 5000 cavalry,|including commanding officers.
{100495}{100570}We had paper uniforms|and everything ready...
{100575}{100662}...and then came this film Waterloo.
{100671}{100737}It was a very well-made film|with Rod Steiger...
{100744}{100868}...but it failed at the box office, and|our backers got scared and pulled out.
{100884}{100980}By 1969, the Kubrick family was living|close to the film studios...
{100987}{101018}...in Elstree, Hertfordshire.
{101023}{101092}He's always liked living here.
{101098}{101185}There were moments|where he was homesick for New York...
{101190}{101266}...but he knew that was|a New York that no longer existed.
{101280}{101377}When you brought up your children here|and their friends...
{101383}{101477}...live here, and you know,|you get attached.
{101482}{101548}Do you know what kind|of camera that is?
{101556}{101656}- It's a home movie...|- Arriflex.
{101664}{101756}I watch the video of me|as a very fresh 10-year-old...
{101806}{101867}...being very fresh to him.
{101886}{102019}But also, him being bossy|and too impatient...
{102024}{102103}...and putting his director's hat on|in an inappropriate way.
{102109}{102152}Get him off, Anya.
{102159}{102227}- Anya get him off, we're shooting.|- I'm trying to.
{102234}{102277}Grab him and get him off.
{102283}{102327}As a child, I remember thinking:
{102344}{102404}"You're not supposed to talk|to me like this."
{102411}{102473}- Do you often find me in a temper?|- Yes!
{102479}{102559}Oh, I don't believe that.|I can't believe that.
{102565}{102657}You just went into a temper|a couple of minutes ago.
{102664}{102748}You can't do this stupid film|because everyone giggles.
{102754}{102806}And because I can't play like that.
{102812}{102895}You can't do this stupid film|because everyone giggles.
{102907}{102957}And because I can't play like that.
{102957}{103058}I think I'm one of the most even-|tempered people you'll ever meet.
{103068}{103157}Kubrick had found privacy|and tranquillity in England...
{103164}{103256}...but this world was about to be|torn apart by his next project:
{103281}{103383}An adaptation of Anthony Burgess'|controversial novel:
{103390}{103424}A Clockwork Orange.
{104403}{104503}There are certain parts|that you have in a career...
{104509}{104595}...that nobody else can play,|that you are born to play.
{104601}{104658}That is one of the parts.
{104663}{104706}There was me.
{104717}{104785}That is, Alex,|and my three droogs.
{104792}{104884}That is, Pete, Georgie and Dim.
{104893}{104982}And we sat in the Korova Milk Bar,|trying to make up our rassoodocks...
{104990}{105045}...what to do with the evening.
{105089}{105164}The Korova Milk Bar sold milk plus.
{105170}{105263}Milk plus vellocet or|synthemesc or drencrom...
{105270}{105319}...which is what we were drinking.
{105331}{105366}This would sharpen you up...
{105373}{105459}...and make you ready for a bit|of the old ultra-violence.
{105464}{105559}I remember saying to him once,|"How do you direct?
{105564}{105660}What's your style?" And he said:
{105678}{105808}"I really don't know.|I never know what I want.
{105815}{105873}But I do know what I don't want."
{105879}{105949}I don't think I've ever had|that much fun on a job.
{105995}{106122}I've worked with other great directors,|certainly Lindsay Anderson...
{106131}{106259}But, actually, the actual fun|of doing the work...
{106265}{106311}...was, of course, in the character|of Alex too.
{106364}{106426}He was a wicked son of a bitch...
{106432}{106549}...but the great thing that I think|Stanley and I had in common...
{106558}{106602}...is a wicked sense of humor.
{106609}{106646}It was my rabbit...
{106653}{106721}...to help the prison Charlie|with the Sunday service.
{106728}{106803}He was a bolshy,|great burly bastard.
{106810}{106886}But he was very fond of myself,|me being very young...
{106893}{106972}...and also now very interested|in the Big Book.
{106977}{107039}I didn't so much like|the latter part of the Book...
{107046}{107099}...which is more like|all preachy talking...
{107105}{107159}...than fighting|and the old in-out.
{107166}{107244}I like the parts where these old|yahoodies tolchok each other...
{107250}{107300}...and then drink|their Hebrew vino...
{107312}{107387}...and getting onto the bed|with their wives' handmaidens.
{107393}{107426}That kept me going.
{107433}{107530}He explored these extreme subjects...
{107564}{107655}...that you kind of sometimes|wanted to recoil from...
{107660}{107701}...like in Clockwork Orange.
{107708}{107782}But they were...
{107788}{107903}...explored in a way that was|dissecting them.
{107910}{107980}Truly dissecting them|to try to find out...
{107985}{108051}...what makes that kind of evil tick.
{108058}{108155}And I think that there was a search|behind all of those films...
{108162}{108210}...to say, in a way:
{108217}{108350}In a world where we know man|is capable of the most base...
{108356}{108468}...shockingly destructive behavior...
{108485}{108564}...is hope and virtue possible?
{108646}{108772}Go on! Do me in, you bastard cowards!|I don't want to live anyway.
{108779}{108851}Not in a stinking world|like this.
{108914}{108993}And what's so stinking about it?
{109007}{109092}What kind of a world is it|at all?
{109098}{109145}Men on the moon.
{109152}{109214}Men spinning around the Earth.
{109220}{109297}And there's not no|attention paid...
{109302}{109391}...to earthly|law and order no more.
{109400}{109464}Oh, dear land
{109475}{109531}I fought for thee
{109646}{109701}You'd have to say...
{109707}{109782}...Stanley's view of human nature...
{109788}{109862}...was, you know, really|very, very bleak.
{109868}{109942}It's fairly miraculous,|in this day and age...
{109948}{110046}...to have pursued the kind of career|he pursued...
{110052}{110136}...in making these|uncompromising movies.
{110142}{110191}It had been a wonderful evening.
{110198}{110285}And what I needed now|to give it the perfect ending...
{110291}{110366}...was a bit|of the old Ludwig van.
{110730}{110793}Kubrick is playing around|with the music...
{110800}{110847}...with what he'd done previously.
{110854}{110972}Having taken like a real classy|classical music score...
{110979}{111011}...for his previous film...
{111016}{111064}...now he's saying Beethoven...
{111070}{111179}...but we'll also have the|"William Tell Overture" played fast.
{111307}{111419}Kubrick's being playful in the same way|as when Alex visits the record store.
{111425}{111550}There in the record rack|is a copy of 2001.
{111557}{111667}Which is a great joke, but also|we're also talking about a director...
{111672}{111747}...who has given up being|influenced by others.
{111754}{111884}A film director whose primary|influence has become himself.
{111891}{111986}For now it was lovely music|that came to my aid.
{111993}{112070}There was a window open|with a stereo on...
{112076}{112159}...and I viddied right at once|what to do.
{112760}{112802}I did two weeks of narration.
{112808}{112895}It was like the purest|kind of filmmaking.
{112901}{112998}You know, just a Sennheiser microphone|and a Nagra, that's all he had.
{113005}{113077}No operator. It was Stanley|pushing the button, that was it.
{113082}{113171}And it was highly you know,|concentrated, so I'd say:
{113177}{113282}"I've got to stretch my legs, Stanley."|And he'd say, "Ping-pong."
{113288}{113385}He was always trying to beat me,|he never did, not at ping-pong.
{113390}{113439}Chess, another matter.
{113444}{113526}So we'd have fun, we'd play,|and we'd come back...
{113531}{113604}...we'd do another piece.|The voice-over works well.
{113610}{113688}So about six months later,|my agent said:
{113694}{113830}"Malcolm, you have two weeks of|voice-over you haven't been paid for."
{113835}{113945}I went, "I'm going out to see|Stanley this afternoon.
{113951}{113987}I'll mention it to him."
{113993}{114105}Leaving, I think I said,|"By the way, my agent informs me...
{114113}{114202}...that I haven't been paid|for the two weeks' narration."
{114229}{114315}He had a slide rule in his pocket|and he took it out.
{114323}{114404}He went like this, and he went:
{114410}{114490}"I'll pay you for a week."|I went, "A week?"
{114496}{114558}He goes, "The other week|was ping-pong!"
{114565}{114595}Oh, bliss!
{114611}{114664}Bliss and heaven!
{114675}{114790}It was gorgeousness and|gorgeosity made flesh.
{114810}{114912}It was like a bird|of rarest spun heaven metal.
{114919}{115004}Or like silvery wine|flowing in a spaceship...
{115011}{115082}...gravity all nonsense now.
{115093}{115129}As I slooshied...
{115136}{115210}...I knew such lovely pictures.
{115451}{115544}Stanley and Malcolm McDowell got|along like a house on fire.
{115550}{115619}Stanley was very happy|with the choice of Malcolm...
{115625}{115666}...and he delivered.
{115673}{115715}We became very, very close.
{115722}{115822}I, of course, thought that this|was a great friendship.
{115838}{115920}I expected to be part of his life.
{115926}{116008}I didn't understand at the time,|being a young actor...
{116015}{116091}...and not having done|very many films...
{116098}{116155}...so being somewhat inexperienced...
{116159}{116249}...that, you know, that the way|of a film life is:
{116254}{116341}Intense relationship, separate.
{116349}{116392}Intense relationship, separate.
{116399}{116514}So I was expecting the relationship|to carry on in some form...
{116521}{116627}...but he cut it like this.|He didn't really want to know.
{116633}{116683}It was over for him.
{116689}{116779}I think the other thing is, some|of the things I said about him...
{116785}{116835}...which were perhaps unfair...
{116843}{116906}...maybe it was a cry out to say:
{116910}{116987}"Stanley, pick up the phone|and call me."
{117000}{117039}And of course, he never did.
{117046}{117101}I have arranged a little|surprise for you.
{117109}{117144}Surprise?
{117151}{117193}One that I hope|that you will like...
{117200}{117231}...as a...
{117248}{117283}...how shall we put it...
{117289}{117371}...as a symbol of|our new understanding.
{117395}{117477}An understanding|between two friends.
{117835}{117926}A Clockwork Orange dealt in part|with media exploitation...
{117932}{117993}...but now real life imitated art.
{118361}{118435}The film was blamed for many brutal|crimes committed by youths...
{118442}{118532}...claiming to have been inspired|by the film's violence.
{118537}{118651}The reaction had a devastating impact|on Kubrick and his family.
{118657}{118760}The attack on Clockwork Orange|was fierce in Britain.
{118766}{118844}It was unbelievable.
{118852}{118941}He was directly accused|of murder and mayhem.
{118948}{119046}Then every crime in England|was because of Clockwork Orange.
{119052}{119138}Stanley was accused|of inciting violence...
{119143}{119221}...and it became very, very ugly.
{119228}{119357}He got terrible letters, you know,|almost death threats.
{119362}{119408}There were some death threats.
{119412}{119485}He asked Warner's,|"Can you please help me?
{119490}{119574}I can't live here|if this keeps going on.
{119580}{119695}I'm afraid to send my children to|school, my house is besieged.
{119700}{119772}I don't want|to show the film anymore."
{119777}{119886}A Clockwork Orange had been playing|successfully for 61 weeks...
{119891}{120021}...but press attacks and threats of|violence against him and his family...
{120027}{120116}...drove Kubrick to withdraw the film|from British cinemas.
{120123}{120202}It was an astonishing display|of director power.
{120210}{120279}What came over to us was that|a filmmaker should have...
{120325}{120420}...the kind of power that he had|to be able to do it.
{120425}{120559}There's no other filmmaker who could|stop a studio distributing their film.
{120566}{120631}Studios are about making money.
{120637}{120736}For him to be able to do that|was always astonishing to us.
{120741}{120812}I remember me as a young|filmmaker thinking:
{120818}{120864}"That's extraordinary."
{120871}{120973}But more than that is, actually,|he had the will to do it.
{120980}{121041}It hurt him financially,|but he didn't care.
{121048}{121145}It hurt Warner Bros. Even more|financially, but they obliged.
{121152}{121210}It wasn't worth it to them.
{121217}{121325}Having peace with Stanley, and making|more films with Stanley.
{121330}{121452}Having him under contract for the|rest of his life was more important...
{121459}{121504}...than if the film played in England.
{121522}{121623}For the release of the film, Kubrick|went beyond the role of a director...
{121630}{121748}...persuading Warner Bros. About|how the film should be sold.
{121755}{121826}If you've taken all the trouble|with preproduction, shooting...
{121869}{121977}...with the postproduction|and trying to get the film together...
{121985}{122034}...and approach it in so many ways...
{122041}{122152}...why do you not be a part of it|just when the public's gonna see it?
{122159}{122243}Clockwork Orange was the second|largest-grossing film...
{122248}{122322}...in the history of Warner's|after My Fair Lady.
{122328}{122436}I'd meet with the foreign distribution|guys and say, "Wait a minute.
{122443}{122520}What we're doing is|following Stanley's instruction...
{122528}{122641}...and getting a great result. We're|grossing huge numbers on a picture...
{122649}{122774}...you said would be a catastrophe|because it was so inaccessible.
{122791}{122883}Is it not possible that he knows|something we don't know?
{122890}{122983}Is it not possible that his way|is a better way?"
{122990}{123076}They go, "No, he doesn't know.|He's just a pain in the ass."
{123083}{123156}Kubrick had a unique relationship|with Warner Bros:
{123161}{123287}Complete creative control and the|support of a major Hollywood studio.
{123298}{123372}We all envied that more than anything|over here.
{123379}{123483}The fact that one studio would|support an artist in that way...
{123488}{123517}...is extraordinary.
{123525}{123588}It was a question|of working with a master...
{123622}{123686}...and wanting to do|the movies of Stanley Kubrick.
{123691}{123811}There weren't runaway costs,|it was always overblown...
{123816}{123911}...and overestimated because he shot|films for long periods of time.
{123916}{123957}But he did them at low cost.
{123962}{124074}You'd walk on a Kubrick set, which was|almost never allowed, I might add...
{124080}{124172}...and marvel at the fact|that there was hardly anyone there.
{124179}{124295}Compared to most movies, there'd be|crowds of people with donuts...
{124301}{124372}...and passing coffee and people|coming and going.
{124380}{124435}I saw it as an absolute priority.
{124441}{124517}Something that we were gonna|focus our attention on...
{124521}{124601}...and that continued to nurture|the relationship...
{124608}{124654}...and to enhance the relationship.
{124660}{124768}He was obviously always a step ahead|of me. He called me once...
{124776}{124822}...I was at Warner's...
{124839}{124917}...I think he was getting ready|to do Lyndon...
{124926}{125000}...and he said,|"Do you have any of those...
{125009}{125100}...special BNC cameras|that we used for rear process?"
{125106}{125165}I said, "Why?"|He said, "For sentimental reasons...
{125170}{125256}...I'd love to buy one from|you if I could get one."
{125263}{125373}I called the camera department|and I said, "Do you have any?"
{125379}{125429}They said, "We've got a couple."
{125434}{125510}I called Stanley back and said,|"I got a couple."
{125517}{125617}He said, "I'd love to get those|cameras. I admire the workmanship."
{125639}{125763}I said, "Great," and sent him one|or maybe two, I can't remember.
{125769}{125893}About six months later, Gottschalk,|who ran Panavision for us...
{125899}{126044}...and who was a certified camera|and opticals genius, called and said:
{126048}{126160}"Why are you sending those|rear-projection cameras to Kubrick?"
{126168}{126235}I said, "He asked for them,|they sit down there...
{126241}{126310}...we don't use|rear projection anymore."
{126316}{126440}He said, "They're priceless, the most|fantastic works ever put in a camera.
{126445}{126570}They are brilliantly conceived and|brilliantly executed camera works.
{126578}{126658}You couldn't build a camera like|it if your life depended on it.
{126665}{126768}I want to get every one I can,|because I can't duplicate them."
{126774}{126910}Stanley had anticipated it and|acquired and built his own cameras!
{126916}{127020}He looked for the old-fashioned|Mitchell BNC cameras...
{127027}{127082}...for a very specific reason.
{127089}{127164}These were the only cameras|where he had a chance...
{127169}{127254}...of fitting these big Zeiss lenses.
{127262}{127382}Stanley sent me this lens and said,|could I mount it on his BNC camera?
{127388}{127484}I said it's absolutely impossible|because the BNC has two shutters...
{127519}{127587}...a thick aperture plate,|and all that...
{127594}{127687}...between the film plane|and the rear element of the lens.
{127695}{127786}And so I explained that to Stanley|and said we'd have to...
{127793}{127899}...damn near wreck your camera|and make it purely dedicated.
{127905}{127951}He said, "Go ahead and do it."
{127963}{128097}It originally was designed,|developed and manufactured...
{128102}{128183}...by Zeiss, for NASA.
{128190}{128316}NASA was planning to use it|in satellite photography.
{128323}{128459}For that reason, it's an extremely|fast lens. It's an FO.7...
{128470}{128583}...which is two stops faster than|lenses that are available even today.
{128592}{128679}Of course, Stanley's intention|for these lenses was to shoot...
{128685}{128770}...the famous candlelit scenes|in Barry Lyndon.
{128775}{128910}That being the case, he shot|with the lenses wide open, FO.7.
{128917}{129047}The consequence of that, he had|practically no depth of field at all.
{129053}{129128}It was quite a chore|to do it, but of course...
{129134}{129189}...the images were|absolutely gorgeous.
{129662}{129750}I think Stanley would have a concept|of wanting to do something...
{129781}{129864}...in a way that it had never|been achieved before.
{129871}{129984}He wanted to put himself into that|century and with these characters...
{129991}{130081}...and these settings and give you|a way of seeing them...
{130089}{130170}...as they would've been seen|at the time the book was written.
{130175}{130304}Yet he used the most extraordinarily|modern and daring instruments.
{130310}{130413}The fact that he used these candles.|That's part of it...
{130419}{130522}...but also the interiors, the|way sunlight came into rooms.
{130530}{130605}It was to achieve|the presence in a period...
{130612}{130706}...in a way that I don't think anybody|had ever done it before.
{130713}{130832}I knew it was a costume piece, but I|hoped he'd take it somewhere else.
{130839}{130931}He took it back in time. The use|of the zoom lens is interesting...
{130936}{131019}...because you'd never think|to use a zoom lens in the past.
{131024}{131133}No, the zoom lens flattens it|out like the 18th-century painting.
{131139}{131199}The movement, body language...
{131204}{131267}...and the use of music and editing...
{131272}{131382}...how transporting that moment is|when Ryan O'Neal, who's wonderful...
{131387}{131512}...and Marisa Berenson as he meets her,|kissing her on the balcony...
{131519}{131558}...with the music and movement.
{132913}{133025}Stanley did not want the film to look|like a traditional movie...
{133032}{133105}...where period clothes|look like wardrobes.
{133112}{133189}He wanted the clothes to move|and have life.
{133238}{133323}He wanted to do something reminiscent|of certain painters of that period.
{133346}{133444}Stanley sent me to all kinds of|auction houses who were dealing...
{133452}{133551}...with period costumes, so we|were mixing some period costumes.
{133558}{133672}Stanley wanted beautiful materials,|as he quite rightly said:
{133677}{133780}"That's why in those paintings|they gave those wonderful lights."
{133786}{133835}Everybody talks of Barry Lyndon...
{133842}{133905}...as a beautiful 18th-century movie.
{133910}{134015}It's because of the way he shot it,|the way he pushed us to do our work.
{134022}{134077}You know, as an artist...
{134085}{134195}...you very often instinctively|design...
{134202}{134273}...and to intellectually justify...
{134335}{134410}...your creativity...
{134419}{134472}...is very difficult.
{134477}{134557}I think the same applies to actors.
{134564}{134660}Though he knew and respected,|I'm sure, the actors...
{134666}{134792}...he would|permutate their performances...
{134798}{134844}...almost to the breaking point.
{134851}{134891}I remember...
{134938}{135005}...going on the set one day and there|were a thousand candles burning.
{135041}{135110}Outside there was a huge storm...
{135116}{135254}...and there were men outside, who,|because of the storm had to hold...
{135260}{135286}...the big lamps.
{135294}{135407}There was a huge gale in Dublin|and the rain was icy cold.
{135412}{135490}I thought "I hope they don't|have to do it too long."
{135496}{135570}And then the candles are burning down|very gradually.
{135577}{135687}Stanley's just sitting there|with Hardy Krüger...
{135693}{135807}...discussing a problem|Hardy had and he's just saying:
{135815}{135866}"Well, Hardy, I think we should..."
{135874}{135945}Krüger, I think, was getting|also in a state.
{135953}{136060}It was interesting, never getting|flustered, never raising his voice.
{136067}{136119}He was great working with|actors because it was one-to-one.
{136154}{136210}You had a relationship|with the director.
{136217}{136309}If he was working with any detail|on a role with an actor...
{136316}{136411}...the others were there,|but it was just you and him.
{136417}{136470}What is your call, Lord Bullingdon?
{136511}{136542}Heads.
{136754}{136795}It is heads.
{136825}{136887}Lord Bullingdon will have|the first fire.
{136996}{137033}Lord Bullingdon...
{137049}{137090}...will you take your ground?
{137116}{137180}And it was the fact that Stanley|was so open...
{137187}{137285}...and so engaging.|When I asked him a question...
{137291}{137377}...it might be about the lighting|or the camera, the lenses...
{137383}{137519}...he would take the trouble|to talk about it in a really...
{137526}{137610}...well-detailed way so that|I understood what was happening...
{137617}{137672}...and that really stimulated me.
{137678}{137779}If he came onto the floor,|he didn't know how to shoot a scene.
{137785}{137855}He wasn't sure how he|was gonna do it...
{137861}{137951}...as an actor, I found it stimulating|because he was saying:
{137958}{138056}"Do whatever it is you think|you're gonna do, but do it for real.
{138062}{138125}That may change how|I'm thinking about the scene."
{138278}{138343}Sir Richard, this pistol|must be faulty.
{138362}{138406}I must have another one.
{138431}{138516}I'm sorry, Lord Bullingdon, but you|must first stand your ground...
{138524}{138581}...and allow Mr. Lyndon|his chance to fire.
{138654}{138713}I always felt Stanley was...
{138720}{138826}...a filmmaker most appreciated|by his fellow filmmakers.
{138832}{138931}Critics were always looking for|something that wasn't in the movie...
{138937}{138998}...and then they were disappointed.
{139005}{139074}That's a little bit|Stanley's fault...
{139082}{139147}...for example, Barry Lyndon.
{139153}{139275}I think everybody was expecting|a kind of raucous Tom Jones movie.
{139282}{139361}You realize as you look at the movie|that it's about...
{139369}{139455}...this slightly dim, handsome boy...
{139460}{139570}...trying to find the clues and the|cues to what's the right behavior.
{139576}{139708}"What's the behavior that's going|to advance me in this society?"
{139715}{139827}So it's a movie really about|a young man defining himself...
{139833}{139914}...in a climate|that's foreign to him.
{139922}{140030}That's not at all what people|were lead to believe it was about.
{140038}{140109}Barry Lyndon was released|just as Hollywood entered...
{140115}{140180}...the age of the blockbuster|action movie.
{140185}{140286}With a running time of three hours,|the film came in for heavy criticism.
{140291}{140423}It was labeled as tedious and boring|by critics in America and Britain...
{140429}{140532}...but in Europe it was hailed|as a film of breathtaking beauty.
{140540}{140600}I remember it won four Oscars:
{140607}{140682}Cinematography, production design...
{140688}{140751}...costume design and the music.
{140758}{140836}I think Stanley was disappointed|because in the end...
{140844}{140900}...it wasn't a commercial success.
{140908}{141006}He was very, very, very sad|and disheartened...
{141012}{141139}...that particularly smaller papers|and smaller television stations...
{141145}{141196}...did not at all appreciate...
{141201}{141288}...the tremendous effort|that went into these films...
{141295}{141345}...and just simply dismissed it.
{141352}{141431}Whatever movie Stanley made,|what I love about his work...
{141437}{141495}...is they are completely conscious.
{141502}{141565}You may like them,|you may not like them...
{141571}{141657}...you may say, "What about this,|that or the other thing?"
{141700}{141789}But everybody pretty much|acknowledges he's the man.
{141851}{141925}And I still feel that underrates him.
{141946}{142016}Kubrick's next film|looked far more commercial...
{142021}{142107}...with Stephen King's|best-selling novel, The Shining...
{142112}{142218}...he took the chance to make a film|that would satisfy him artistically...
{142223}{142275}...and meet box office demands.
{142280}{142378}I'm asking about The Shining,|and he says:
{142383}{142468}"In reality, this is|an optimistic picture."
{142473}{142583}I said, "On what basis, Stanley?"|And he said...
{142588}{142720}As the existential, pragmatic|man that he was, he said:
{142725}{142810}"Well, in some way this movie|is about ghosts.
{142815}{142925}Anything that says there's anything|after death is an optimistic story."
{142951}{143030}The Shining has images|that I wake up screaming about.
{143037}{143078}That little boy in the hall.
{143083}{143116}The tracking shot...
{143122}{143157}The boy on the bike.
{143162}{143187}...of the boy.
{143193}{143319}The sense of movement it gave that|picture inside this foreboding place.
{144083}{144154}You know something|is building up in this place.
{144161}{144213}And the way...
{144221}{144306}It's the blandness, let's say,|of the people.
{144312}{144348}How quiet they are.
{144356}{144451}Is Tony the one that|tells you things?
{144564}{144625}How does he tell you things?
{144669}{144776}It's like I go to sleep|and he shows me things.
{144783}{144885}But when I wake up,|I can't remember everything.
{144919}{145003}Has Tony ever told you|anything about this place?
{145009}{145072}About the Overlook Hotel?
{145083}{145172}It's holding back this emotional,|powerful punch that'll happen.
{145179}{145265}You know it'll come somehow,|at some time...
{145271}{145335}...and it just creates such suspense.
{145340}{145388}Is there something bad here?
{145562}{145641}At first I was taken aback|by the performance...
{145647}{145728}...and then after|the third or fourth viewing...
{145736}{145814}...I understood|the level of intensity...
{145820}{145869}...of what Nicholson was doing.
{145875}{145961}I'm not sure that it's|intended to be...
{145969}{146057}...what a typical horror movie is,|which is a realistic portrayal...
{146063}{146129}...of supernatural spookiness.
{146136}{146223}I think that what's going on|in that movie...
{146229}{146333}...is largely going on|in Jack Nicholson's head.
{146527}{146565}Hi, Lloyd.
{146653}{146715}A little slow tonight,|isn't it?
{146836}{146870}Yes, it is, Mr. Torrance.
{146878}{146945}I like the kind of film he makes.
{146952}{147045}I don't need to be|naturalistic in a film...
{147051}{147120}...to feel satisfied as an actor.
{147136}{147208}One thing he said to me that|I'll always remember was:
{147216}{147277}"In movies you don't...
{147283}{147376}...try and photograph the reality...
{147383}{147479}...you try and photograph|the photograph of the reality."
{147488}{147616}I knew it wouldn't be a performance|about idiosyncratic behaviorism...
{147633}{147735}...but that it would be...|I always thought of it as balletic...
{147741}{147772}...in The Shining.
{147779}{147840}Another lesson was,|"Here Jack...
{147846}{147934}...the script says,|'Jack is not writing.'
{147941}{148012}The question is, what is he doing?"
{148018}{148118}I said, "Whenever I'm inside|a big empty place...
{148125}{148195}...that you normally|wouldn't be alone in...
{148201}{148308}...I always think of doing things|that I might do outside."
{148317}{148422}And that's where throwing that|tennis ball all during the picture...
{148427}{148510}And it wound up being|a big part of staging.
{148517}{148564}It rolls into things...
{148569}{148673}...it's thrown the length of hallways,|all those kinds of things.
{148680}{148772}And it's from those little things|that he would develop...
{148777}{148846}...preconceived idiosyncrasy.
{148852}{148919}He always knew|what he was going to get.
{148926}{149038}He said often that every scene,|really, has been done.
{149043}{149130}Our job is always to do it|just a little bit better.
{149143}{149188}Mr. Grady...
{149202}{149284}...you were the caretaker here.
{149480}{149547}I'm sorry to differ with you, sir.
{149594}{149639}But you...
{149656}{149701}...are the caretaker.
{149759}{149832}You've always been the caretaker.
{149906}{149952}I should know, sir.
{149986}{150039}I've always been here.
{150046}{150123}We had a good, friendly relationship.
{150131}{150222}I mean he'd turn on you|in a moment and say:
{150228}{150302}"All right, you're the big fella.|Let's see it."
{150308}{150390}That's about as harsh|as he ever got with me.
{150397}{150482}He was a completely different|director with Shelley.
{150487}{150537}- Roll the video?|- Two seconds.
{150544}{150592}We're killing ourselves. Be ready!
{150623}{150664}- I'm standing right by the door.|- Mood music?
{150670}{150737}- I can't hear.|- When you came out like this...
{150742}{150791}- Look desperate.|- They say, "Wait."
{150796}{150872}- Then you say, "Go."|- You've got to look desperate.
{150879}{150954}- You're wasting our time.|- I can't get the door open.
{150962}{151059}For a person so charming|and so likeable...
{151085}{151130}...indeed loveable...
{151215}{151287}...he can do some pretty|cruel things...
{151292}{151352}...when you're filming.
{151367}{151436}Because it seemed to me at times...
{151442}{151520}...that the end justified the means.
{151723}{151750}Don't!
{151770}{151801}Stop it!
{151904}{151943}Here's Johnny!
{152008}{152058}It was a very difficult role.
{152064}{152161}It was a long shoot|and I had to cry and hyperventilate...
{152168}{152234}...and carry a little boy and run...
{152241}{152296}...for most of the time we shot.
{152303}{152397}And that was about a year,|a little over a year.
{152405}{152489}Anywhere between 3O and 5O|videotaped rehearsals...
{152496}{152539}...before we even rolled film.
{152546}{152628}I wouldn't trade the experience|for anything.
{152635}{152694}Why? Because of Stanley.
{152723}{152820}And it was a fascinating|learning experience.
{152825}{152954}It was such intense work,|that I think it makes you smarter.
{152964}{153033}But I wouldn't want|to go through it again.
{153129}{153196}We were working with the material|in the book...
{153203}{153272}...and trying to make music|that fit the mood...
{153307}{153377}...of an updated Gothic horror story.
{153382}{153503}Which is what The Shining is,|really, as a novel, in any case.
{153508}{153611}Of course, the stylization|that came out from the filming...
{153618}{153669}...was not present in the book.
{153676}{153749}And so we failed in our attempt.
{153756}{153827}Which is why there's|other music in the movie.
{153849}{153886}Danny, you win.
{153895}{153946}Let's take the rest|of this walking.
{153952}{154017}A lot of the music cues|are combinations...
{154024}{154105}...of some of Ligeti's music,|some of Penderecki's music.
{154250}{154320}And lots of background patterns|and textures...
{154327}{154420}...with heartbeats and sizzling,|electronic, weird sounds...
{154426}{154545}...all mixed together. That's how he|finally did what he was looking for.
{154823}{154894}When The Shining was released,|the response was mixed.
{154900}{154971}Some people appreciated its riddles|and ambiguities.
{154978}{155070}Others felt Kubrick had strayed|too far from King's book.
{155078}{155117}When I say that the people...
{155126}{155217}...who love Stanley's movies|were mostly movie people...
{155223}{155304}...they're just looking|at what's in the frame.
{155310}{155372}What's the "movieness" of the movie.
{155378}{155484}They, of course, love Stanley|in a very uncomplicated way.
{155491}{155578}Whereas the critical community...
{155584}{155655}...tends to fuss and fidget...
{155662}{155732}...over what Stanley did.
{155738}{155802}After The Shining,|Kubrick and his family...
{155809}{155884}...moved to a mansion|in the Hertfordshire countryside.
{155892}{155983}Except when filming on location,|he would do all his work here...
{155989}{156047}...supported by a small,|dedicated team.
{156053}{156120}The joke we had about Stanley was...
{156125}{156199}This was the line|you would never hear from him...
{156206}{156318}...was, "Don't bother me with details,|I've got faith in your judgment."
{156325}{156395}Stanley would involve himself|to such an extent...
{156400}{156503}...with the detail of stuff that|one thought was a bit beneath him.
{156510}{156561}He should've been doing major stuff...
{156568}{156654}...not worrying about|how you had files in your office.
{156660}{156771}I guess he saw it as a package deal.|You either cared or you didn't.
{156778}{156847}When we went to Ireland|on Barry Lyndon...
{156885}{156929}...he left this 15-page document...
{156935}{157015}...of care instructions|of how to look after the animals.
{157020}{157122}And the 37th instruction was:
{157129}{157198}"If a fight should develop|between Freddy and Leo..."
{157206}{157289}That was a father and son|tomcats that we had...
{157296}{157375}"The only way you can do anything|is dump water on them...
{157380}{157442}...try to grab Freddy|and run out of the room.
{157448}{157505}Do not try and pick up Leo.
{157511}{157620}Alternatively, if you open a door and|let Freddy out, he can outrun Leo...
{157626}{157710}...but if trapped in a place where|you can't separate them...
{157716}{157789}...keep dumping water, shouting,|jumping up and down...
{157795}{157849}...and distracting|and waving shirts.
{157855}{157919}Just try and get them apart|and grab Freddy."
{157926}{157992}I remember once he had a cat that was|drinking excessively and I said:
{158032}{158105}"Perhaps you can measure|how much he's drinking."
{158112}{158191}He said, "No, that's impossible.|There are too many cats."
{158197}{158299}Then he phoned back and said,|"I could count the number of laps."
{158306}{158415}And he said, "How much does each lap|take up in terms of water?"
{158421}{158484}I said, "I don't think|there's any information."
{158490}{158543}He said, "I'll try and find out."
{158550}{158616}He'd go off and try and find out...
{158621}{158679}...then he'd work it out|and have a figure.
{158686}{158735}He was compulsive in that way.
{158743}{158805}He was a kind of|ultimate Jewish mother.
{158811}{158889}If an animal was ill|or if one of us were ill...
{158933}{158979}...Stanley was like Superman.
{158985}{159053}I was very ill myself|for quite a while...
{159058}{159137}...and he was so sweet...
{159145}{159193}...so kind, so loyal.
{159199}{159284}Everything you want somebody to be,|he was.
{159290}{159378}He was really, really kind.
{159435}{159501}However, when you weren't ill...
{159506}{159552}...that's when you bought it.
{159557}{159621}He very seldom praised you,|because he had this obsession...
{159656}{159709}...that if he praised you...
{159715}{159792}...you would fall to pieces|and not do the job right.
{159800}{159894}He knew how far he could push you.|That was the other clever thing.
{159900}{160002}Occasionally he pushed too far|then was confused why you were angry.
{160008}{160107}Philosophically,|he was just no-nonsense...
{160113}{160201}...honest, had his view...
{160205}{160259}...very cool view of humanity.
{160266}{160359}He was a warm guy at home,|I'm sure everybody says that.
{160364}{160426}Crazy about animals...
{160432}{160492}...but could be...
{160497}{160567}...brutal with people he worked with.
{160572}{160625}He wasn't all that way.
{160631}{160713}Sometimes he could be|generous as well.
{160720}{160810}But he felt everybody was an opponent.
{160818}{160908}No matter what, he wasn't sure|they weren't...
{160914}{160997}Didn't have an agenda of their own.
{161003}{161072}And he wasn't gonna have that|on his pictures.
{161084}{161139}I'm asking the fucking questions,|understand?
{161176}{161247}Thank you!|Can I be in charge for a while?
{161275}{161314}Are you shook up? Nervous?
{161325}{161351}Sir, I am, sir!
{161356}{161394}Do I make you nervous?
{161431}{161478}Were you about to call me an asshole?
{161483}{161540}Full Metal Jacket|was based on a novel...
{161547}{161645}...The Short-Timers,|by Gustav Hasford, a Vietnam veteran.
{161652}{161734}He collaborated on the screenplay|with Kubrick and Herr...
{161739}{161794}...who covered the war|as a correspondent.
{161799}{161884}He was thinking about|making a war movie.
{161890}{161953}I said, "You already made|Paths of Glory."
{161987}{162044}He said, "People think of that|as an anti-war movie.
{162051}{162105}I want to make a war movie...
{162111}{162197}...just to consider the subject...
{162203}{162278}...without a moral|or political position...
{162285}{162328}...but as a phenomenon."
{162607}{162680}Holy shit! The sniper has a clean shot|through the hole!
{162745}{162844}What he ended up doing|in Full Metal Jacket...
{162849}{162961}...he had almost|the detachment of the view.
{162968}{163096}It's like a god's-eye view of combat|in the second half of the film.
{163103}{163204}It seems to be so still and removed.
{163211}{163278}The cleanliness of it...
{163284}{163354}...and the power of it.
{163370}{163492}And the beauty of it, because|it was all so beautifully filmed.
{163499}{163579}And he understood|that it was accepted...
{163585}{163649}...that it was quite okay|to acknowledge...
{163655}{163769}...that among all the things war is,|it's also very beautiful.
{163775}{163881}It's the only film that's ever given|you a real idea what it's like...
{163887}{163991}...also what the kids go through|and how important a drill sergeant is.
{163996}{164038}That's right, Private Pyle...
{164045}{164130}...don't make any fucking effort|to get up to the top!
{164147}{164258}If God wanted you up there, He would|have miracled your ass up there!
{164280}{164327}Get your fat ass up there!
{164332}{164393}And also the nature...
{164400}{164455}...of the tragedy of it.
{164462}{164545}What is your major malfunction,|numb-nuts?
{164555}{164657}Didn't Mommy and Daddy show you|enough attention when you were a child?
{165300}{165326}Easy, Leonard.
{165439}{165475}Go easy, man.
{166310}{166385}And then the whole movie changes|and moves out.
{166391}{166478}What's interesting about Kubrick|is that the structure is all.
{166486}{166578}He doesn't deal with traditional|dramatic structure, which is good.
{166585}{166615}He was experimenting.
{166621}{166662}Fucking son of a bitch!
{167260}{167311}Looked like something, didn't it?
{167318}{167408}For a director who is perceived...
{167416}{167517}...as being completely|uptight and controlling...
{167524}{167620}...he was very freeform, Stanley.|He'd try anything.
{167625}{167683}He'd ask the actors in for meetings...
{167687}{167787}...and say, "There's no such thing|as a stupid idea in this context.
{167799}{167858}If you have an idea just say it."
{167863}{167932}And he'd often adopt them.
{167945}{168011}I'm not saying Stanley|wasn't a control freak.
{168019}{168081}I would never say that.
{168087}{168175}But there were many ways|he was not controlling.
{168180}{168261}You should probably not be...|Should be more...
{168288}{168341}...frightened, then get into that.
{168347}{168383}Do something brilliant.
{168389}{168493}I loved him, I enjoyed his sense|of humor, but I would be lying...
{168498}{168622}...if I didn't say there were times|when he was incredibly difficult.
{168629}{168712}If you weren't willing to solve|the problem as much as he was.
{168747}{168793}If you weren't...
{168801}{168900}...as devoted to understanding...
{168907}{168991}...what it was|he was trying to go after...
{168997}{169046}...it was really hard for him.
{169052}{169157}Sometimes you didn't know|what it was he was looking for.
{169163}{169263}I remember walking around|Beckton Gas Works by myself...
{169272}{169325}...and he drove up in the jeep|and said:
{169330}{169398}"What's wrong?|Why are you walking around?"
{169405}{169512}I said, "I don't know|what it is you want from me."
{169517}{169590}And he said,|"Are you crazy? Get in the jeep."
{169596}{169654}He said,|"I don't want you to do anything.
{169660}{169735}I want you just to be yourself,|that's all I want."
{169740}{169808}You put "Born to Kill" on your helmet|and wear a peace button.
{169813}{169856}Is that some kind of sick joke?
{169896}{169931}Well, what does it mean?
{169948}{170017}- I don't know, sir.|- You don't know very much.
{170023}{170106}Get your head and your ass wired|together or I will shit on you!
{170130}{170198}Answer my question|or you'll stand tall before the Man.
{170224}{170298}I was referring to|the duality of man, sir.
{170320}{170377}The duality of man.|The Jungian thing, sir.
{170422}{170455}Whose side are you on?
{170460}{170535}Kubrick shot part of|Full Metal Jacket in London...
{170541}{170646}...where a derelict gasworks was made|into the city of Hue, Vietnam.
{170653}{170756}The four key elements were|the demolition, the signage...
{170762}{170824}...the palm trees and the smoke.
{170831}{170880}Most was shot in "magic hour."
{170920}{170994}"Magic hour" is that delightful time|of day when you're all exhausted...
{170999}{171040}...and the light's perfect.
{171105}{171133}He's dead.
{171223}{171278}You collaborate with Stanley.
{171286}{171350}It's not easy to impress him|with what you do...
{171357}{171409}...but if you come out|not ticking off about something...
{171448}{171485}...you know you've done well.
{171491}{171566}You get very close.|You're part of the family.
{171573}{171689}It's a very close unit because you're|with him 24 hours a day sometimes.
{171696}{171739}You eat, drink and sleep it.
{171746}{171808}There's no life outside|of film with Stanley.
{171814}{171884}And if you enjoy it,|there's no greater experience.
{171890}{171988}Everybody earned their pay|when they worked for Stanley.
{171994}{172079}But nobody earned their pay|the way Stanley earned his pay.
{172086}{172150}No one worked as thoroughly, deeply...
{172157}{172224}...obsessively, as Stanley did.
{172230}{172294}And he understood|when you're making a movie...
{172300}{172378}...you often don't know what you want|until you see it.
{172383}{172437}Did you try it?|Let's give it a crack.
{172443}{172505}One way or another...
{172516}{172625}...I felt utterly compensated...
{172650}{172703}...for my time with Stanley.
{172710}{172820}If you're in it only for the money,|you might have a different feeling.
{172825}{172895}But my feeling was that...
{172901}{172978}...I have absolutely|had no complaints.
{172991}{173089}Kubrick had started work on the idea|for Full Metal Jacket in 198O.
{173110}{173157}When released 7 years later...
{173162}{173247}...several Vietnam movies|had already reached the screen.
{173252}{173380}Kubrick, the great innovator, had|been overtaken by other filmmakers.
{173386}{173451}But it still appealed|to a wide audience...
{173459}{173556}...because it bore all the distinctive|hallmarks of a Kubrick film.
{173563}{173631}He didn't like|that he made so few films.
{173639}{173693}He always wished|he could've done more.
{173700}{173798}If he had anything negative|in his life...
{173806}{173896}...I think it was that feeling|that he was slow.
{173902}{173991}I suppose the other thing|I noted about Stanley...
{173997}{174090}...was there were still magnificent|obsessions he never quite realized.
{174131}{174228}His fascination with World War II|and with the movie industry...
{174234}{174282}...and Goebbels during that period.
{174287}{174352}For years Kubrick had tried|to find a way...
{174359}{174448}...of portraying the appalling|inhumanity of the Holocaust on screen.
{174455}{174534}He turned Louis Begley's book,|Wartime Lies...
{174541}{174582}...into Aryan Papers...
{174590}{174695}...the story of a Jewish family|trying to evade capture by the Nazis.
{174720}{174782}By the time he was ready|for production...
{174790}{174861}...Spielberg had begun shooting|Schindler's List.
{174881}{174941}Feeling the similarities|were too great...
{174948}{175031}...Kubrick reluctantly shelved|Aryan Papers.
{175037}{175116}Another thing, he felt it|just couldn't be told.
{175123}{175213}"If I really want to show|what I've read and know happened..."
{175219}{175272}And he read everything.
{175326}{175389}"...how can I even film it?
{175396}{175477}How can you even pretend it?"
{175516}{175615}He became very depressed|during the preparation...
{175621}{175687}...and I was glad|when he gave up on it...
{175694}{175772}...because it was really|taking its toll.
{175783}{175872}Kubrick turned his attention|to another longstanding project...
{175880}{175946}...based on a short story|by Brian Aldiss.
{175954}{176028}But A.I. Evolved|into such a mammoth undertaking...
{176034}{176108}...he sought the collaboration|of another director.
{176115}{176217}He said, "You ought to direct A.I.|And I should produce it."
{176225}{176288}I was shocked. I said, "Yeah, right."
{176296}{176333}He said, "I'm serious.
{176340}{176421}It would be a Kubrick production|of a Spielberg film."
{176427}{176550}I remember him actually giving me|a title card on the whole proposal.
{176555}{176604}I said, "Why would you want to?"
{176611}{176722}Because I knew he had been developing|this from his heart for so long...
{176729}{176791}...and had contributed|so many elements...
{176798}{176873}...beyond Brian's|original short story.
{176890}{176925}And Stanley said:
{176933}{177033}"I think this movie is closer|to your sensibility than mine."
{177040}{177074}He was so insistent...
{177080}{177162}...he said, "When can you come out|and talk in person?"
{177171}{177247}I said, "When would you like?"|He said, "Tomorrow."
{177253}{177329}I was on Long Island,|it was during the summer.
{177334}{177430}So I got on an airplane|the next day and flew to his kitchen.
{177435}{177499}We, for the first time, sat down|and he said:
{177506}{177556}"I'll show you the storyboards."
{177564}{177651}And he started to show me|a plethora of work...
{177659}{177704}...that he had done.
{177710}{177780}It was a project which needed|many special effects.
{177788}{177883}He eventually postponed the project|for technical reasons.
{177889}{177966}Computer technology|was about to explode...
{177972}{178088}...and he figured he would benefit|enormously by waiting a few years.
{178101}{178169}So the next project|became Eyes Wide Shut.
{178183}{178269}When Eyes Wide Shut was announced|as Kubrick's next film...
{178275}{178355}...celebrity columnists focused|on the mysterious director...
{178362}{178453}...who had not made a film|or given an interview in 1O years.
{178459}{178497}They rehashed old stories...
{178505}{178584}...which Kubrick|had never bothered to deny.
{178598}{178636}He had been pegged:
{178644}{178730}"Reclusive filmmaker,|probably half mad."
{178736}{178834}For a man to whom, I think,|control was everything...
{178839}{178934}...the notion that he could not,|in the last analysis...
{178940}{179038}...control this image that had|grown up about who he was...
{179045}{179148}...it must have bought him a despair,|like, "The hell with it.
{179156}{179254}If that's what they want to think,|I can't do anything about it."
{179260}{179313}He dealt with it the way he had to.
{179320}{179392}I knew it was rubbish|which was all that mattered.
{179398}{179452}And it mostly was|all that mattered to him...
{179458}{179535}...but the more disgusting|things upset him.
{179541}{179605}He would talk about that sometimes.
{179611}{179710}I know until the end of|Eyes Wide Shut he'd started to say:
{179716}{179816}"Right, now I'm gonna do|a few proper interviews...
{179822}{179933}...and try and set the record|a little straighter."
{179938}{180002}He didn't want|to shoot tourists on his lawn...
{180008}{180055}...then give them money|when they bleed.
{180061}{180144}But also because it's another thing|that fits into...
{180150}{180205}...the nerdy monster...
{180213}{180296}...sliming around in his house|and hating women.
{180302}{180385}Hating women?|He was surrounded by them.
{180391}{180492}I think there are few men who knew|as much about women as he did.
{180500}{180575}It's impossible for me to just|be objective and say:
{180583}{180686}"He should have spoken up.|He should have been more gregarious."
{180691}{180763}Should? He couldn't.|He wasn't. Why should he?
{180770}{180800}He had a great nerve.
{180808}{180898}He'd open the door to somebody|looking for Stanley Kubrick and say:
{180904}{180954}"He's not at home."
{180962}{181031}For a long time, nobody knew|what his face looked like.
{181037}{181114}He was very, very knowledgeable|about things, Stanley.
{181119}{181175}Curious and interested|in the world.
{181183}{181234}I think people aren't aware of that.
{181241}{181322}They think for someone so obsessive|and so committed...
{181329}{181400}...that the rest of the world|might pass him by.
{181406}{181495}He funneled the world into his life,|into his kitchen.
{181502}{181572}Well, here was a man|who set up his life...
{181580}{181704}...so he was warmed constantly by his|family and by his circle of friends.
{181710}{181822}He was a matter of minutes|from the place that he worked.
{181831}{181923}Who among us would be|anything but envious...
{181929}{182010}...of the way he's managed|to set up his life?
{182144}{182205}The book is a tract about, you know...
{182210}{182309}...what are the dangers|of married life?
{182314}{182382}What are the silent desperations...
{182388}{182496}...of keeping an ongoing|relationship alive...
{182503}{182563}...and what are the choices?
{182569}{182626}You're either in that or you're not.
{182632}{182729}And Stanley was very, very much|a family man and in it.
{182736}{182860}The conjectures that he made about|what it might be like outside it...
{182867}{182932}...had a lot to do with his curiosity.
{182938}{183065}It was a theme that we both|talked about a great deal.
{183077}{183165}He thought about it|in many different ways.
{183170}{183262}It used to come back over the years|again and again...
{183269}{183352}...and as you see friends getting|divorced and remarried...
{183358}{183403}...the topic would come up again.
{183409}{183479}It had so many variations...
{183485}{183577}...and so much really|serious thought to it...
{183585}{183657}...that he knew one day|he was going to make it.
{183669}{183734}May I ask why a beautiful woman...
{183768}{183837}...who could have any man in this|room, wants to be married?
{183912}{183961}Why wouldn't she?
{184007}{184058}Is it as bad as that?
{184091}{184152}As good as that.
{184158}{184258}Stanley's expectations of people|were not really, really high.
{184265}{184297}You see it in his films.
{184304}{184374}There was human beings he loved.|Christiane was the love of his life.
{184408}{184499}He would talk about her with...|He adored her.
{184504}{184559}That's something people didn't know.
{184565}{184626}His daughters, adored them.
{184631}{184728}I'd see that because he would|talk to me about them, very proudly.
{184734}{184812}His understanding of humans...
{184817}{184912}...was that we are very bittersweet.
{184925}{184995}But he admired, I think...
{185010}{185128}...like passion and commitment|and loyalty.
{185134}{185219}Ultimately, Eyes Wide Shut|is about commitment.
{185225}{185303}It's a very hopeful film.|People see it as dark...
{185308}{185346}...but it's very hopeful.
{185456}{185508}I must see you again.
{185546}{185618}- That's impossible.|- Why?
{185649}{185706}Because...
{185763}{185795}...I'm married.
{185803}{185879}His films are often thought|to be without pity.
{185886}{185962}That's a good quality,|it seems to me...
{185969}{186077}...because he's saying, "We are like|this. We are hopeless, muddled...
{186081}{186217}...fallible, desperate,|needing-Iove human beings."
{186222}{186333}In the end, I think that's what|is the central quality of his films.
{186339}{186408}He tells us about human beings|as we are...
{186414}{186484}...not as we'd like to imagine we are.
{186490}{186610}The heart of it|was illustrating a truth...
{186615}{186672}...about relationships and sexuality.
{186678}{186780}It was not illustrated|in a literal way...
{186787}{186823}...but in a theatrical way.
{186829}{186889}People said the streets weren't|like New York.
{186894}{186965}I said, "It doesn't matter.|Look at the name of the street.
{186974}{187036}No such street exists in New York.
{187043}{187134}In a funny way, it's as if you're|experiencing New York in a dream.
{187140}{187197}It seems like New York, but it's not.
{187203}{187321}It seems like your wife, you know,|but what is she telling me?
{187327}{187398}And do I want to know?|Maybe I shouldn't ask."
{187408}{187449}Because I'm a beautiful woman...
{187455}{187562}...the only reason any man|ever wants to talk to me...
{187610}{187719}...is because he wants to fuck me.|Is that what you're saying?
{187781}{187905}Well, I don't think it's quite|that black-and-white...
{187961}{188079}...but I think we both know|what men are like.
{188133}{188179}So on that basis...
{188185}{188310}...I should conclude that you|wanted to fuck those two models.
{188358}{188433}There are exceptions.
{188476}{188564}And what makes you an exception?
{188570}{188630}I took that character of Bill home.
{188672}{188714}At times, that was not|a nice place to be...
{188720}{188813}...sitting, in that character|for that amount of time.
{188855}{188955}It really is not the kind of person|that I am, that contained...
{188961}{189034}...noncommunicative,|likes the daily routine...
{189042}{189091}...the stability of his life.
{189096}{189158}Ignoring his wife in that|relationship.
{189166}{189204}Not wanting to rock the boat.
{189212}{189268}Taking things for granted, Bill did.
{189275}{189356}Took her, his family and his life|for granted.
{189361}{189456}He's just a little too smug,|and she just goes, "bang."
{189462}{189563}I first saw him|that morning in the lobby.
{189583}{189650}He was checking into the hotel...
{189657}{189743}...and he was following the bellboy|with his luggage...
{189762}{189811}...to the elevator.
{189924}{190034}He glanced at me as he walked past.|Just a glance.
{190065}{190109}Nothing more.
{190292}{190370}But I could hardly...
{190413}{190450}...move.
{190523}{190571}When we went to rehearse that scene...
{190576}{190706}...it was the three of us and we just|kind of got in our underwear...
{190711}{190775}...not Stanley,|we got in our underwear.
{190809}{190894}And we just talked about the scene...
{190899}{190964}...and didn't really worry|about the lines.
{190972}{191023}It just slowly evolved.
{191030}{191149}We were doing take after take.|I said to Stanley, "What do you want?"
{191155}{191234}He said, "I want the magic.|I want the magic."
{191241}{191365}But then as the scene progressed,|take after take doing it...
{191373}{191461}...you'd feel the scene reach a level|everyone felt was interesting...
{191467}{191582}...then we'd keep working on it|and it would feel bad.
{191590}{191667}It was stale. It just didn't...|It wasn't working
{191673}{191793}And then suddenly we could feel it|break into a place...
{191799}{191895}...that none of us|had really thought of before.
{191902}{191959}The process of the film|was a discovery.
{191965}{192058}It was never about the result.|It was never about:
{192064}{192197}"Well, we have a week to shoot|this scene. So quick, let's do it.
{192203}{192286}We may not fully explore it,|but we'll get something good."
{192294}{192377}Stanley wanted|to explore every avenue...
{192382}{192469}...and then make his decisions|based on that.
{192478}{192577}And Stanley was not restricted|by time, he refused to be.
{192583}{192683}That is a great luxury that only|somebody like he could afford...
{192689}{192796}...because of what he'd achieved|through his career to be able to say:
{192803}{192904}"Do you want to know what's gold|with filmmaking? Time is gold."
{192911}{192977}Not having to walk away|from a scene...
{192982}{193058}...before you feel like|you really perfected it.
{193108}{193177}I wanted to make fun of you...
{193220}{193282}...to laugh in your face.
{193363}{193486}And so I laughed as loud as I could.
{193839}{193918}That must have been|when you woke me up.
{194093}{194185}The other thing Stanley hated doing|was ever explaining himself.
{194193}{194243}So, what's the film about, Stanley?
{194250}{194335}He'd look down,|look away and not answer.
{194417}{194517}The same for a scene, "What do you|really want this scene to be?"
{194522}{194556}He'd never answer that.
{194563}{194676}Eyes Wide Shut seems to be|a rake's progress story.
{194683}{194763}He goes on an adventure that could|turn out any way.
{194769}{194846}It's an irresponsible adventure|for him to embark on.
{194852}{194916}It's a fantasy, isn't it?|It's a dream film.
{194923}{195022}I don't think we're supposed to|believe anything that we see.
{195028}{195131}One thing that people do have|a hard time with in the cinema...
{195137}{195175}...is ambiguity.
{195184}{195285}Ambiguity is great, but in the cinema|it's almost verboten.
{195716}{195815}Perhaps the most extraordinary example|of how a piece of music is used...
{195821}{195944}...to drive home something|about character and story...
{195950}{196066}...and atmosphere of a film|is in Eyes Wide Shut.
{196469}{196552}Please, come forward.
{196558}{196646}I was in Stalinist...
{196653}{196713}...terroristic Hungary...
{196718}{196806}...where this kind of music|was not allowed...
{196813}{196884}...and I just wrote it for myself.
{196895}{197013}Stanley Kubrick understood|the dramatics of this moment...
{197019}{197137}...and this is what he did in the|film. For me, when I composed it...
{197142}{197223}...in the year 5O...
{197229}{197286}...it was the most desperate.
{197292}{197401}It was a knife in Stalin's heart.
{197999}{198089}He had that director's disease...
{198097}{198209}...of really imagining the easy part|of it until you get there, you know.
{198216}{198338}I'm sure he didn't go into Eyes Wide|Shut expecting to shoot for 14 months.
{198343}{198458}I thought the same thing, I said,|"I'll be out of here in three days."
{198467}{198564}The first scene we did in two hours,|that night at the house...
{198569}{198630}...where they come in and say hello.
{198636}{198722}I said "What are all these things|I hear about it taking forever?
{198729}{198846}I went there, three hours later|I was back at the hotel in London."
{198852}{198921}I remember him teasing me,|"What are you doing?"
{198927}{199022}I said, "I know it's great having|you here, Sydney, you're perfect."
{199029}{199081}Because we shot it in a day.
{199113}{199173}And then, my God.
{199180}{199241}Of course, the next day...
{199249}{199279}...Sydney comes out...
{199287}{199363}...and he's dressed.|He's got his sleeves up.
{199369}{199491}He's in his pants. He knows every|line of this massive scene.
{199498}{199582}He says, "Let's run lines.|Let's go, Cruise.
{199589}{199631}Let's go. I got a week.
{199638}{199730}We're gonna jam this out|and it's gonna be fantastic."
{199736}{199851}And we're doing the Steadicam shot|of me coming into the room...
{199857}{199943}...and Sydney goes,|"How do you want me to do this?"
{199949}{200027}Stanley said,|"Well, let's try it and see."
{200035}{200112}"Well, I can go to the door fast."|"Let's see that."
{200119}{200168}He says, "Now open the door.
{200175}{200279}Maybe that's a little too fast."|"Okay, I'll go slower."
{200286}{200354}We start doing the scene this way,|and...
{200360}{200443}By the third week|when we're in the billiard room...
{200450}{200565}...I'm saying, "My God. How? How?"
{200572}{200703}Of course, Stanley said, "I didn't|think you would be much longer.
{200710}{200762}But don't you want to get it right?"
{200789}{200894}I tell you, there are a lot of people|in our business who are...
{200901}{200993}Well, they label themselves|as perfectionists.
{201001}{201104}That's a kind of euphemism|for a pain in the ass, really.
{201114}{201244}Stanley was the first real|perfectionist that I met.
{201251}{201350}I mean, there just wasn't any way...
{201362}{201421}...for him to go one take less.
{201437}{201497}He never gave an inch on anything.
{201524}{201624}So much was expected of him|every time.
{201629}{201703}He wasn't allowed just|to make a movie.
{201708}{201759}It had to be an amazing movie...
{201767}{201847}...because so many were waiting|for the next Kubrick film.
{201855}{201974}It had to be an event. I think,|on his shoulders was a responsibility.
{202141}{202264}When Eyes Wide Shut was shown|for the first time in New York...
{202271}{202355}...on March 1, 1999...
{202360}{202456}...to Tom and Nicole|and the heads of the studio...
{202462}{202526}...the response was very enthusiastic.
{202533}{202579}Stanley was very, very happy.
{202586}{202682}A great, heavy weight|was lifted from his shoulders.
{202721}{202825}I think this change|of his being...
{202831}{202916}...caused almost a physical|change in his body...
{202922}{203021}...because he had lived with this|enormous responsibility...
{203026}{203093}...for a very expensive film...
{203098}{203197}...which was long in the shooting|for two years.
{203204}{203255}And suddenly it was all gone.
{203289}{203344}He died a week later.
{203490}{203594}The enormous intensity|that Stanley had...
{203600}{203698}...with his work,|he also applied to his family.
{203705}{203803}I always felt very much loved,|and so did the children.
{203847}{203942}He was consistent...
{203947}{204076}...in that he always said,|"Either you care or you don't."
{204081}{204188}Well, Stanley was always a man|who never wanted to repeat himself.
{204223}{204322}He reinvented himself with every|single motion picture he directed.
{204351}{204433}As a filmmaker, you know, for me...
{204440}{204527}...he was a conceptual illustrator...
{204532}{204579}...of the human condition.
{204585}{204668}You say, "I wish he'd made more,|but these were enough."
{204674}{204747}Because there's so much|in each one, you know?
{204754}{204798}It would've been nice for him|to make more...
{204804}{204866}...but that wasn't his process.
{204873}{204973}What he did make was so special, a|different movie each time you see it.
{204979}{205016}I think, as a director...
{205024}{205100}...I think that what we all|admired the most...
{205108}{205157}...was that it was a single vision.
{205163}{205258}It was one man's vision, and no one|interfered with that vision.
{205265}{205346}The complete control he had|in the making of his films...
{205352}{205461}...that meant that whatever was in|his head, was up there on the screen.
{205467}{205557}I know that he struggled a lot|to get to that place.
{205562}{205655}I think it is something that all|of us have benefited from.
{205662}{205761}Two major artists were Orson Wells|and Stanley...
{205768}{205892}...in terms of being, you know,|genuine...
{205898}{205947}...no-holds-barred artists.
{205954}{206024}So I would put him in the pantheon...
{206030}{206167}...of the absolute top film directors|that the world has seen.
{206180}{206279}And he was one of the people|that sort of knew...
{206342}{206435}...what was wrong with the world|in a weird way...
{206458}{206508}...and was able to turn that into art.
{206531}{206633}He just didn't grouse about it...
{206650}{206725}...or bitch or write lousy editorials.
{206734}{206824}He converted it into something|that was amazing...
{206831}{206935}...and important for us as a species.
{206943}{207025}I always thought|I'd work with Stanley again.
{207031}{207108}We kept in touch over the years|and everything...
{207114}{207192}...talked about other projects.
{207198}{207315}It's a sad thing that I won't|have that great opportunity.
{207327}{207373}I miss him.
{207439}{207493}How could one not miss him?
{207507}{207583}He was a man who was|completely unique.
{207591}{207653}He's a man I loved and admired...
{207660}{207752}...with all the difficulties|he had with him.
{207757}{207849}He was not an easy person,|but it didn't matter.
{207855}{207940}Obviously I worked with him|for 3O years for good reasons.
{207946}{207988}Stanley is gone.
{207996}{208073}There's never gonna be|another Kubrick film.
{208080}{208163}You'll never have a film that will|look like this ever again...
{208169}{208206}...because it is Stanley...
{208213}{208292}...and he pushed everyone|to the limit.
{208298}{208433}He pushed the film to the limit.|He pushed the actors emotionally.
{208439}{208510}But because we all wanted|to go there with him.
{208516}{208614}Part of Stanley's legacy|on my life is that...
{208620}{208675}...if you believe in something...
{208681}{208794}...you passionately believe in|something, devote yourself to it...
{208801}{208876}...completely, utterly|and don't apologize for doing it.
{208882}{208937}He felt extremely lucky...
{208944}{209077}...to be in a situation|where he could tell stories...
{209082}{209189}...on such a large scale,|and millions of dollars involved.
{209196}{209330}I think when he was young, he didn't|dare hope he would be able to do that.
{209337}{209426}I don't think he ever took that|for granted.
{209440}{209511}People would say,|"How are you doing, Stan?"
{209517}{209563}He'd say, "I'm still fooling them."
