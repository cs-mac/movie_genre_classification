2
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,680
This somebody' sidea of a joke?

3
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,230
Not mine.

4
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,770
And the rest of these.What are
they, replacements for steel wool?

5
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,130
You wanna keep working here?

6
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,380
Substandard.

7
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,940
Damn it.

8
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,430
All right, you heard the boss, back to work.

9
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,160
What about that meeting?

10
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,060
It's important, jake.

11
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,830
You deal with it.

12
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,060
I'm outta here.

13
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,320
Evening, jakey.

14
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,140
Shanna's in room 12.

15
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,010
Shanna?

16
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,050
You in here?

17
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,950
Ah, so good to see you.

18
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,080
You stink.

19
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,760
Like rotting flesh.

20
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,530
Fur trader.

21
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,550
It's, you know, my work.

22
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:01,140
But someday... someday it's gonna
make mea very rich man.

23
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,130
And you'd like that,
wouldn't you, shanna?

24
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,180
Someday, someday, someday.

25
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,330
If I had a dollar for every
"someday" I heard in this dump,

26
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,730
I could've bought myself a
job as a supermodel by now.

27
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,420
That's not allowed.

28
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,510
Come on, gimme.

29
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,040
No.

30
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,880
Come on, come on.

31
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,300
I paid ya.

32
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,150
Not for whatyou wanna do.

33
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,310
You know the rules, you pig.

34
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,740
If you don't stop it,
I'll call security.

35
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,140
Get out. Out.

36
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,130
Get out. Get out.

37
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,450
You bastard.

38
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,020
Okay, I'm goin', I'm goin,

39
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,150
but one day, you'll give it to me.

40
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,450
I don't like it this far out here, pa.

41
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,500
What if we get caught?

42
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,110
The only way we're gonna
get caught, larry,

43
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,160
- is if you keep yappin',
- Yeah, so shut up.

44
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,290
This is mother mayter'sland, ain't it, pa?

45
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,850
And?

46
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,700
And we're not supposed to
go out there, are we?

47
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,960
I mean, maybe there's a reason people
don't go this deep into the woods.

48
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,350
What if something gets us?

49
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,310
I went in yesterday to
set the traps, didn't I?

50
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,790
And I came out okay, didn't I?

51
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,940
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but. Go on.

52
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:02,410
Mother mayter has done a good job
spreading stories for generations.

53
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,330
To scare people off the land.

54
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,140
It's a bunch of crap.

55
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,670
Those stories don't scare me,

56
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,950
cause I know bullshit when I hear it.

57
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,940
What are all these structures?

58
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,950
What are you gonna do? Pee yourself?

59
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,740
They're nothin'.

60
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,780
They said they was
ruins from some old.

61
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,350
Some old city.

62
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,200
Well, that is amazing.

63
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,820
Enough. And be quiet, you hear?

64
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,380
Bingo.

65
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,750
Hey, there's raccoons in all
the traps you set down there.

66
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,110
I told you it will be all right.

67
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,360
You remember how I told you it's done?

68
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,080
Yeah, I crush their throats.

69
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,460
First you turn
the mover on their backs.

70
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,950
Then you put your
hee lon their windpipe.

71
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,370
And you stomp down real hard.

72
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,500
If you do it right, you'll
hear a good crunch.

73
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,760
That'll be their windpipe shattering.

74
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,320
Oh, well.

75
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,960
The heel ain't gonna
work with them.

76
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,130
They still got some
pepper left in 'em.

77
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,860
It ain't?

78
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,110
That's what the bat's for.

79
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,880
You give 'em a bunch of good whacks.

80
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,630
I've seen it take
up to 50 swings once,

81
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,710
so you just keep swingin' until
you crush their fuckin' skulls.

82
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,590
Okay.

83
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,990
We've go to ur selves some.

84
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,200
Some traps to clear.

85
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,440
Hey, pa.

86
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,020
Look at this.

87
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,040
Come look.

88
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,670
Well, I'll be damned.

89
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,060
What do you think happened?

90
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,050
That critter must've chewed
its own paw off.

91
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,590
You really gotta wanna get
free to do something like that.

92
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:58,230
We got almost a dozen
beauties here, son.

93
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,980
In all my years, I ain't
never seen pelts this pretty.

94
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,110
I can hardly believe they're coon.

95
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,590
We're gonna have money to burn
when we sell them to feldman.

96
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,140
Shit.

97
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,210
It's mother mayter.

98
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,030
Let's get the hellout of here.

99
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,740
Thick as can be.

100
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,040
And not a bald sporto a scar.

101
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,630
Primes, larry.

102
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,440
Yeah, dad.

103
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,460
They sure are beauty, pa.

104
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:47,900
And you know, the amazing thing
is that they're all identical.

105
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:53,710
As if all those coons came
from the same big family.

106
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,880
Give me, uh, kind of a funny
feeling, you know?

107
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,980
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

108
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,740
Make me feel all warm inside.

109
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:09,310
Yeah, and all that money that
feld man is gonna pay for 'em,

110
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,250
that gives me a good, warm feeling.

111
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,900
Listen.

112
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,680
I- I'm gonna hit the
sack after I phone feldman.

113
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,280
So you stay here and
clean up. Understand?

114
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,570
Yes, sir.

115
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,990
This better be good.

116
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,700
How about pelts.

117
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,790
Of such an out standing quality that
you'd be willing to pay 10 times

118
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,850
the going price just to have 'em.

119
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,500
And out of the kindness of my heart,

120
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,130
I'll give you first crack at 'em.

121
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,620
Jameson, the only reason
you'd give me first crack is

122
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:18,470
because there is not another chump east of the pacific
ocean who will even take your fuckin' phone call.

123
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,310
You keep makin' jokes, feldman,

124
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,220
the loss is gonna be all yours.

125
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,450
Wait, wait, wait.

126
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,790
Hold on.

127
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,030
What's your stock, jameson?

128
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,510
Coon.

129
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,450
But trust me, feldman.

130
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,260
You've never seen pelts like these before.

131
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,560
They're gonna make you a rich man.

132
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,560
They're gonna give you.

133
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,670
Whatever it is that your heart desires.

134
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,850
You better not be bullshittin' me.

135
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:04,110
Jameson, I do not have the time to head out into the
fuckin' boonies on some wild fuckin' goose chase.

136
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,760
You just get here before I change my mind.

137
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,950
You better not be bullshittin' me.

138
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,400
They're just so damn beautiful.

139
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,820
Hey, wake up.

140
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,400
What is it? What?

141
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,600
What do you want?

142
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,770
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

143
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,550
That's where the bat comes in.

144
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,970
I seen it take upwards of 50 swings once.

145
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,530
Fuckin' hillbilly bastard.

146
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,030
Jameson.

147
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,030
Jameson.

148
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,620
It's feldman.

149
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,100
Jameson.

150
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,920
Go on in, lo...

151
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,610
Hello?

152
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,680
You see anything?

153
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,890
No.

154
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,520
Jameson?

155
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,720
No matter how many times I smell it,

156
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,210
I'll never get used to the
stench of dried blood.

157
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,500
My god.

158
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,420
Jameson was not bullshittin' me.

159
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,350
How long we beenin the for business, lou?

160
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,960
15? 20?

161
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,900
You ever seen anything
like these pelts?

162
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,210
Nothin', boss.

163
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,390
Absolutely nothin'.

164
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,200
Pelts like these.

165
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:25,010
The sky's the limit.

166
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,780
We can have anything our hearts desire.

167
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,530
What the fuck was that?

168
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,390
Jameson.

169
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,610
Jameson.

170
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,860
Is that you?

171
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,080
Fuckin' hell.

172
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,930
Jesus christ, jake.

173
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,450
He fell face first into it.

174
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,400
Where's jameson?

175
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,350
What the hell happened here, jake?

176
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,540
Can you believe those pelts though?

177
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,650
You gotta be kidding me.

178
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,560
No.

179
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,110
Can you imagine.

180
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,560
The coat that we can make with those pelts?

181
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:54,190
We might finally have something
to make a little noise next month.

182
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,800
Cirio?

183
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,030
The world's biggest international for show.

184
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,760
It doesn't get any bigger than that.

185
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,100
When we gonna call the cops, jake?

186
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,330
Yeah. Yeah.

187
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,720
We'll call them from the highway.

188
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,500
Anonymously.

189
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,840
Come on.

190
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,910
All right. Let's get this.

191
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,730
Let's go.

192
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,650
Come on, lady.

193
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,350
Let's go. Get 'em inside.

194
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,250
What's got them, boss?

195
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,520
Probably had some bad fuckin' egg
rolls for lunch, lo...

196
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,580
Who the fuck cares? Come on.

197
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,530
Get them inside and let's go.

198
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,530
By this time next week, lou,

199
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:04,040
we're gonna have one of the
world's most extraordinary for coats.

200
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,200
After cirio, sky's the limit.

201
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,920
Sky is the limit.

202
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,670
We're gonna need the right
model though, you know?

203
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,840
Somebody worthy of the coat,
otherwiseit's all for nothing.

204
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,240
Lou, I already got somebody in mind.

205
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,460
No, don't stop.

206
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,840
Damn it.

207
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,910
Go away.

208
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,310
Shit.

209
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,540
- Who is it?
- Don't stop.

210
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,670
- Damn it.
- No.

211
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,220
I'm so sick of this shit.

212
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,210
Chill out. Okay?

213
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,270
Yeah?

214
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,420
Somebody's here to see you, shanna.

215
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,880
He says it's important.

216
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,630
Tell him I'm busy.

217
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,400
Shanna.

218
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,230
It's me.

219
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,490
Jake feldman.

220
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,430
It's okay. Let him in.

221
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,700
He smells like a god damn
slaughter house.

222
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,560
He's hopeless.

223
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,240
I got a business proposition for you.

224
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,410
I've heard your propositions before.

225
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,210
Man, how many times do
I have to tell you?

226
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,760
I'm not in to that.

227
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,250
I'll never let you have that.

228
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,320
Not for all the money in the world.

229
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:40,040
This is a straight,
down-the-line business deal.

230
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,810
I'm making a coat and I want
you to wear it next month.

231
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,420
At cirio.

232
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,550
Cirio?

233
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,650
It's been a while since I've
done a legitimate fashion show.

234
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,870
Shanna, I wanna do this show,

235
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,480
and I don't wanna do anything.

236
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,170
Once you see the coat
that I'm makin' for you.

237
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,880
These pelts.

238
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,570
Are unbelievable.

239
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,600
Well.

240
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,910
We'll see. Okay?

241
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,270
No.

242
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,950
The coat will be finished next week.

243
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,850
I'll bring it to your place.

244
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,440
I know what you like.

245
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,310
We'll see.

246
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,180
No.

247
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,090
No.

248
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,550
Cutting is an art, sergio.

249
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,300
Fuck that up again.

250
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,850
And I'll cut your nuts off my self.

251
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,380
Capisce?

252
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:39,860
Can you imaginean endless
supply of those pelts, boss?

253
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,290
Yeah.

254
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,360
I'll take us to the coons from
wherever jameson trapped 'em.

255
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,960
To the coons.

256
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,500
A breeding pair.

257
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,790
Where you going?

258
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,110
Where'd you trap those pelts, jameson?

259
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,090
Oh, yeah.

260
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,960
Hello there, ma'am.

261
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:52,810
You must be mother mayter.

262
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:56,960
My name is jake feldman, and I, uh.

263
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,830
I brought you.

264
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,420
A bottle of moonshine.

265
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:08,530
I... I just need to ask
you a few questions.

266
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,820
Do you mind if I come up there?

267
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,010
Come.

268
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,880
I've been expecting you.

269
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,380
You wanted to see me?

270
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,800
Yeah.

271
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,330
About the animals.

272
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,310
The one son your land.

273
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,740
The pine lights, you mean?

274
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,060
Pine lights.

275
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,850
Many years ago,

276
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:03,160
a whole nest of the pine lights gathered deep
in the woods in the clearing just beyond here.

277
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,010
They became.

278
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:10,240
Sentinels of the lost city.

279
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,610
So.

280
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,330
Pine lights.

281
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,250
Clearings. Sentinels. Lost city.

282
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,880
No disrespect, but.

283
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,940
What has that got to do with anything?

284
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:34,050
It's why I walled off my land.

285
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:39,040
It's why I warn people about trespassing.

286
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,170
---------

287
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,450
---------------

288
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,790
To protect them?

289
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,600
Is, uh.

290
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,320
Is that them?

291
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:14,240
Are they the pine lights?

292
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,700
Yeah

293
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,410
I was wonderin'

294
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:26,320
if you'd be willing to give
me a couple of the, uh.

295
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,430
Raccoons?

296
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:34,020
Now, obviously, I'd be
willin' to pay you for them.

297
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,020
It was you the other night, wasn't it?

298
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,370
- You killed them.
- No, ma'am. Of course not.

299
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,120
You were the reason they died.

300
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,480
- To satisfy your vanity.
- No, ma'am.

301
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,510
- Your callousness.
- No!

302
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:52,120
*******

303
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:54,790
***********

304
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,280
They have not had their final say.

305
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:01,430
They have not finished with you yet.

306
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,960
What's the matter, lou?

307
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,520
Sue chin yao.

308
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,340
What the hell happened?

309
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:20,020
She suffocated.

310
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,690
What?

311
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,920
We had to pull an all nighter
to make sure the coat was ready.

312
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,740
Apparently she sent the other seam stresses
home around 4:00 in the morning.

313
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:31,820
Said she could finish it herself.

314
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:34,130
She was the only one
here when this happened.

315
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,650
You tellin' me she did this to herself?

316
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:22,270
Did you call the police yet?

317
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:24,260
No, I was waitin' for you.

318
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:26,030
Okay. Good.

319
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,360
Go ahead and call 'em.

320
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:30,560
But keep things as
quiet as possible.

321
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,900
- Hey, jake.
- The last thing.

322
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:36,340
That we need.

323
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,810
Is a lot of bad publicity.

324
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:44,460
Lot of bad shit's been happening around here
ever since we started working on this coat.

325
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,930
It's like it's cursedor something.

326
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,740
I don't believe in curses, lo...

327
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,340
You shouldn't have come here, jake.

328
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,940
I just wanted to show you the coat.

329
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:28,420
You wanna see it, right?

330
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:31,220
Okay okay. You wait.

331
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:32,970
You wait till you see this.

332
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,400
Wait.
