1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,301
- This is you?
- Yeah.

2
00:00:01,303 --> 00:00:02,859
Philanthropist.

3
00:00:02,861 --> 00:00:05,527
People pay for all sorts
of things on the Deep Web.

4
00:00:05,529 --> 00:00:07,529
I'm keeping custody of Jacob.

5
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:09,998
But I lifted the restraining order.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,368
Sometimes people keep trying
until they get it right.

7
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,103
Why didn't you marry my dad?

8
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:16,371
I don't want to talk about it.

9
00:00:16,373 --> 00:00:18,873
- It's a simple question.
- No, it's not!

10
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:20,976
Jacob.

11
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:22,110
Hi, Dad.

12
00:00:22,112 --> 00:00:23,311
Holy shit.

13
00:00:23,313 --> 00:00:25,246
Let go of him. Please let go of him.

14
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:29,317
She said to please let him go.

15
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:30,585
Get out! Get out of here!

16
00:00:30,587 --> 00:00:31,753
I will get my son.

17
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:35,023
My attorney will be in touch.

18
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:37,626
I need you to kill Sean.

19
00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:43,098
Why are you looking at me like that?

20
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,801
Because I am thinking about
what you just asked me to do.

21
00:00:46,803 --> 00:00:49,537
Are you thinking about what
you just asked me to do?

22
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,606
No. I'm waiting for you to answer.

23
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:53,875
I don't think you meant to ask it.

24
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:54,809
I did.

25
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:56,711
You really want me to kill Sean.

26
00:00:56,713 --> 00:00:58,079
I need you to kill Sean.

27
00:00:58,081 --> 00:00:59,314
Jacob's father.

28
00:00:59,316 --> 00:01:01,149
- Yes.
- You want to kill a person.

29
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:04,486
No, I want you to kill a person,
which is nothing new for you.

30
00:01:04,488 --> 00:01:06,488
These are words I never
imagined you would say.

31
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,556
And I never imagined that
the man who ruined me

32
00:01:08,558 --> 00:01:10,759
would come back and try to ruin me again.

33
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:13,528
I never imagined he
would try to ruin Jacob.

34
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,231
Actually, I have imagined
it like a million times,

35
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:18,333
because it's my worst nightmare.

36
00:01:18,335 --> 00:01:21,436
And now he wants custody
and he has a lawyer.

37
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:24,506
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:27,375
Of course, I could never understand

39
00:01:27,377 --> 00:01:29,044
what you went through with Sean.

40
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:33,782
Obviously, it was horrible,
what he did to you.

41
00:01:33,784 --> 00:01:35,650
So you wouldn't have kept Jacob a secret

42
00:01:35,652 --> 00:01:37,485
unless there was a very good reason.

43
00:01:37,487 --> 00:01:38,753
Exactly.

44
00:01:38,755 --> 00:01:40,689
And that man cannot take Jacob.

45
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:42,223
Do you understand?

46
00:01:42,225 --> 00:01:43,858
I understand.

47
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:25,903

48
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,180
Cul-de-sac?

49
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,416
Sounds homey.

50
00:02:41,418 --> 00:02:44,419
Yeah, that sounds good, too.

51
00:02:44,421 --> 00:02:47,222
That's near the park, right?

52
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:49,190
I like it. I like it.

53
00:02:49,192 --> 00:02:51,426
Does the front yard have privacy, though?

54
00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:54,863
Yeah, I don't want people
looking in on our shit.

55
00:02:57,901 --> 00:03:00,368
Okay, badass.

56
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,037
Love you, too, baby.

57
00:03:04,074 --> 00:03:06,241
My girl is researching real estate,

58
00:03:06,243 --> 00:03:08,209
looking into school districts and shit.

59
00:03:08,211 --> 00:03:10,779
You must be confident
you will get custody.

60
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:13,047
- What can I get you?
- Just coffee.

61
00:03:14,918 --> 00:03:17,285
So your girlfriend didn't
want to come with you?

62
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:18,520
Help support you?

63
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:20,021
She knows I fight my own battles.

64
00:03:20,023 --> 00:03:22,390
Obviously, Letty wants
you to fight this one.

65
00:03:22,392 --> 00:03:24,359
I am not here to fight.

66
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:27,362
No? Then why'd you ask
me to meet you here?

67
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:29,464
I know why.

68
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:30,632
Really?

69
00:03:30,634 --> 00:03:32,567
You think I'm a piece of shit.

70
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:33,968
I don't know you.

71
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,337
So what happened between you and Letty?

72
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:38,072
She didn't tell you?

73
00:03:38,074 --> 00:03:39,741
No, not really.

74
00:03:39,743 --> 00:03:42,477
Letty and I had something...

75
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,181
Something real, something real... up.

76
00:03:46,183 --> 00:03:47,816
But she doesn't take responsibility

77
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:50,451
for the choices she makes,
and when shit turns bad,

78
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:53,221
she turns blame on whatever's close by.

79
00:03:53,223 --> 00:03:54,455
I was close by.

80
00:03:54,457 --> 00:03:55,857
Just an innocent bystander.

81
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:58,293
No, I wasn't... I wasn't perfect.

82
00:03:58,295 --> 00:04:01,729
But no matter what she wants
to believe, I wasn't a demon.

83
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:03,431
Anyway, that was a long time ago.

84
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:05,500
I've moved on.

85
00:04:05,502 --> 00:04:07,468
I've become a man.

86
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,938
A decade later, and she is still

87
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,774
right where she was when
I dropped her junkie ass.

88
00:04:12,776 --> 00:04:15,443
So you abandoned her.

89
00:04:15,445 --> 00:04:17,812
Junkies abandon themselves.

90
00:04:18,715 --> 00:04:20,048
You didn't do drugs.

91
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,218
No, sure I did. Nothing like Letty.

92
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,223
I didn't even know that Jacob
existed until two weeks ago.

93
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:30,684
She told him I was dead. Did you know that?

94
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:31,826
I know that.

95
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:35,296
Well, I'm back from the dead.

96
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:44,572
Thank you.

97
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:47,575
So...

98
00:04:47,577 --> 00:04:51,446
how do you really know if you
want to be a father to Jacob?

99
00:04:51,448 --> 00:04:57,518
How do I know if I want
to be a father to my own son?

100
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,722
You've only known Jacob for two
weeks, so you don't know him.

101
00:05:00,724 --> 00:05:02,657
I've spent more time
with him than you have.

102
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:03,892
And that's the problem.

103
00:05:03,894 --> 00:05:05,093
Why is that a problem?

104
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:06,594
You're not his real father.

105
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:08,429
I care about what happens to him.

106
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,468
You are unbelievable, man.

107
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,870
You are disrupting Jacob's life.

108
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:17,071
He contacted me.

109
00:05:17,073 --> 00:05:18,907
A child doesn't always know what's best.

110
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:20,308
- I'm about to...
- What?

111
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,043
What are you about to do?

112
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,381
I think you should leave.

113
00:05:26,383 --> 00:05:27,949
That's a great idea.

114
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:29,484
I mean leave. Go away.

115
00:05:29,486 --> 00:05:32,553
I have never seen Letty more
destroyed than she is right now.

116
00:05:32,555 --> 00:05:34,489
You terrified her.

117
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:36,190
Leave her alone.

118
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:38,493
Leave Jacob alone.

119
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:40,495
Are you kidding me with this?

120
00:05:40,497 --> 00:05:43,064
Jacob's an amazing kid

121
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:45,934
because he was raised by
people who cared about him.

122
00:05:45,936 --> 00:05:48,480
And now you just want to take
him away from those people...

123
00:05:48,505 --> 00:05:49,804
His grandmother, his mother.

124
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:52,040
Yeah. I want to take
him away from his mother,

125
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:54,309
like she took him away from me.

126
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:55,576
So you just want to win.

127
00:05:55,578 --> 00:05:57,145
Of course I want to win,

128
00:05:57,147 --> 00:06:00,615
but I choose my battles carefully.

129
00:06:00,617 --> 00:06:02,917
Jacob is my son.

130
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:04,619
That's a battle you choose.

131
00:06:11,461 --> 00:06:12,660
Can I help?

132
00:06:12,662 --> 00:06:14,996
We don't need help.

133
00:06:14,998 --> 00:06:19,667
I know you don't,
but I'm still gonna help.

134
00:06:29,713 --> 00:06:32,413
See? I'm not so bad at this.

135
00:06:32,415 --> 00:06:33,614
It's an easy puzzle.

136
00:06:33,616 --> 00:06:35,683
They made it for drunk people.

137
00:06:42,826 --> 00:06:46,427
Swag I got from a cruise Rob took me on.

138
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:50,398
How long are you gonna be mad at me?

139
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,301
I don't know.

140
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:01,642
Do you remember how many times
I asked you that same question...

141
00:07:01,644 --> 00:07:03,344
you gave me that same answer?

142
00:07:03,346 --> 00:07:04,379
Yep.

143
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:07,715
You two are so the same it's scary.

144
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,086
Did you talk to Kyle yet?

145
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:13,755
Not yet.

146
00:07:13,757 --> 00:07:17,225
You need a lawyer, Letty.

147
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:19,527
Okay?

148
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:22,463
Not just for you, for me.

149
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:26,934
And I love that boy.

150
00:07:26,936 --> 00:07:31,572
I've cried for that boy,
I sacrificed for that boy,

151
00:07:31,574 --> 00:07:36,811
and I didn't do it all so that
repulsive piece of human garbage

152
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,579
could come in here and
take him away from us.

153
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:40,948
I know you didn't.
Well, that's what could happen.

154
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,117
I won't let that happen.

155
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:45,453
Good.

156
00:07:48,178 --> 00:07:49,924
Well, go.

157
00:08:04,174 --> 00:08:06,340
Ah. Jesus.

158
00:08:06,342 --> 00:08:07,842
Is the air-conditioning broken?

159
00:08:07,844 --> 00:08:10,044
Oh, it sure is.

160
00:08:10,046 --> 00:08:13,948
It's like a damn heat wave.

161
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,984
Don't tell me you
think you still work here.

162
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:18,619
No. I need to see Kyle.

163
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:19,921
Is he here?

164
00:08:19,923 --> 00:08:23,224
He's here, but so is Hurricane Tiffany.

165
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:26,594
The filter is further up there, Mitch.

166
00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:29,497
Put your back into it.

167
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:33,968
How could you think for a
second that people wouldn't find out?

168
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,369
You're on Grindr for Christ's sake.

169
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:37,205
Would you keep it down?
I am not on Grindr.

170
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:39,040
Really? So there's some
other dude who likes

171
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:41,175
"getting deep-dicked till
he forgets his wife's name"

172
00:08:41,177 --> 00:08:43,611
standing five feet away
from me right now?

173
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:46,013
Maybe it's Mitch.

174
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:48,416
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

175
00:08:48,418 --> 00:08:52,487
You did, but it's fine.
I got nothing left to say.

176
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:53,821
What are you doing here?

177
00:08:53,823 --> 00:08:58,126
I need Kyle to make sure Sean
doesn't get custody of Jacob.

178
00:08:58,128 --> 00:08:59,961
Good luck with that.

179
00:08:59,963 --> 00:09:03,064
Yeah.

180
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:06,334
Can you be my lawyer for
this custody hearing?

181
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:08,469
It's tomorrow. I'm sorry.

182
00:09:08,471 --> 00:09:09,604
Letty, you... you know

183
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:11,439
that I don't know shit about family law.

184
00:09:11,441 --> 00:09:12,874
So? Open a book.

185
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:16,043
Uh, my plate's kind of full right now.

186
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:17,778
You know this is everything.

187
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,780
Can you please help me?

188
00:09:19,782 --> 00:09:22,016
Yes. Okay, of course.

189
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:23,518
Thank you.

190
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:27,488
Oh, uh, hey.

191
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,391
Wear something an unemployed
felon could actually afford.

192
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:33,361
Yeah.

193
00:09:39,636 --> 00:09:41,402
I am sorry.

194
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:42,970
Okay?

195
00:09:42,972 --> 00:09:45,573
Letty, I...

196
00:09:45,575 --> 00:09:48,142
I think that this whole thing
with Sean might have started

197
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:49,677
because I accidentally told Autumn

198
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,047
that the actor on this TV
commercial was Jacob's dad,

199
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:55,750
and I think that she told him,
and then he...

200
00:09:55,752 --> 00:09:57,685
That's exactly what happened.

201
00:09:57,687 --> 00:09:59,787
Why didn't you say anything?

202
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:01,222
I don't know.

203
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:03,858
It happened. Can't change it.

204
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,893
I know you have a lot going on.

205
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:08,596
I am so sorry.

206
00:10:08,598 --> 00:10:10,331
It's okay.

207
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,999
No, it's not.

208
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:15,303
Well, hopefully it will be.

209
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:19,640
Want to go shopping?

210
00:10:19,642 --> 00:10:21,442
Yes.

211
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,518
Kyle said it has to look cheap, not ugly.

212
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,854
I can't believe he's already
dispensing fashion advice.

213
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:35,456
Tiffany, he still loves you.

214
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,491
He still wants to sleep with you.

215
00:10:37,493 --> 00:10:39,860
Monogamy doesn't have to
be what it always was.

216
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:41,562
Wrong. Monogamy is a word.

217
00:10:41,564 --> 00:10:44,198
- It has a definition.
- You know what I mean.

218
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,934
You might find you'd like an
arrangement that's not so...

219
00:10:46,936 --> 00:10:49,237
traditional.

220
00:10:50,473 --> 00:10:53,007
Not bad.

221
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:56,911
Remove the lace.

222
00:10:56,913 --> 00:10:59,113
You're seriously gonna steal that?

223
00:10:59,115 --> 00:11:00,348
This is a charity store.

224
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,050
- Ugh, fine.
- What is wrong with you?

225
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:10,925
Hey, dude.

226
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:13,261
Hey. Is Jacob in his room?

227
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:14,328
Sort of.

228
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,098
He's in his fort, which is in his room,

229
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,400
and which is the most badass fort, ever.

230
00:11:19,402 --> 00:11:21,769
I helped, but not that much.

231
00:11:21,771 --> 00:11:24,772
Did you talk to Kyle?

232
00:11:24,774 --> 00:11:27,008
Yeah, he'll be there.

233
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,609
Thank God.

234
00:11:28,611 --> 00:11:30,111
Thank you.

235
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:40,521
That is the best fort I've ever seen.

236
00:11:40,523 --> 00:11:42,490
Can I come in?

237
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:44,592
I'm reading.

238
00:11:44,594 --> 00:11:46,127
Just for a second.

239
00:12:01,778 --> 00:12:03,344
"Where the Red Fern Grows."

240
00:12:03,346 --> 00:12:05,179
I remember reading that book.

241
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:07,214
This is my second time.

242
00:12:07,216 --> 00:12:09,050
Did it make you cry the first time?

243
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:10,985
No.

244
00:12:10,987 --> 00:12:13,621
Me neither.

245
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,023
Know what the best part is?

246
00:12:16,025 --> 00:12:17,525
When the boy falls on the axe

247
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:19,627
and a bubble of blood
comes out of his mouth.

248
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:22,263
Totally.

249
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:27,601
Are you nervous about
going to court tomorrow?

250
00:12:27,603 --> 00:12:29,704
I don't want to go.

251
00:12:29,706 --> 00:12:31,305
Me neither.

252
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:36,544
I want everything to go back to normal.

253
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:38,279
I didn't think you'd all start fighting

254
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:40,047
just because I e-mailed him.

255
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:41,782
You didn't do anything wrong.

256
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:44,218
Why do you want to be my mom so bad?

257
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,887
Because I am your mom.

258
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:48,622
Because I love you.

259
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:51,592
But aren't you supposed to not
lie to someone if you love them?

260
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:53,994
You're right. I shouldn't have lied to you.

261
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:56,063
I'll never do it again.

262
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:59,100
I really want to be a good mom to you.

263
00:12:59,102 --> 00:13:01,168
I know.

264
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:04,472
I love you, too.

265
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,028
Did you do it?

266
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:15,049
No.

267
00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:16,617
Why?

268
00:13:18,554 --> 00:13:20,421
You know what? Never mind.

269
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:23,057
I'll get someone else to do
it off that Deep Web thing.

270
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:24,325
I tried to get Sean to leave.

271
00:13:24,327 --> 00:13:25,993
That's not what I asked you to do.

272
00:13:25,995 --> 00:13:27,461
Because Sean won't leave,

273
00:13:27,463 --> 00:13:29,463
which is why I didn't ask
you to ask him to leave.

274
00:13:29,465 --> 00:13:31,165
- I asked you...
- What I don't want

275
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:33,000
is to do the thing
you're asking me to do,

276
00:13:33,002 --> 00:13:34,301
and then you regret it.

277
00:13:34,303 --> 00:13:35,903
You will resent me for doing something

278
00:13:35,905 --> 00:13:37,037
you don't really want done.

279
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,606
He's going to take him away from me.

280
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:39,940
And me.

281
00:13:39,942 --> 00:13:41,509
I won't resent you.

282
00:13:41,511 --> 00:13:43,010
You will.

283
00:13:43,012 --> 00:13:45,146
I am not going to do it, Letty.

284
00:13:47,116 --> 00:13:49,283
Get out of this house.

285
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:07,773
Room 213. Up the stairs, to the right.

286
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:09,708
Thank you. Have a good night.

287
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:24,490
What are you doing here?

288
00:14:24,492 --> 00:14:27,259
I'm sleeping here.

289
00:14:29,397 --> 00:14:31,263
Please.

290
00:15:05,535 --> 00:15:06,901
Ow.

291
00:15:06,903 --> 00:15:08,369
Ah.

292
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:30,858
Okay.

293
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:34,896
- Hi.
- Hi.

294
00:15:34,898 --> 00:15:37,398
- Are you...
- He's my mom's boyfriend.

295
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,532
Hi, buddy.

296
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:44,372
This is everyone now, correct?

297
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:46,474
Yes. We can get started.

298
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:48,843
Actually, I'd like to start with Jacob.

299
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:50,111
- Why?
- Why?

300
00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:52,413
Because I'll speak with Jacob alone,

301
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:54,615
and then I'll speak with the rest of you.

302
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,353
Is this normal?

303
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:12,033
How are you doing?

304
00:16:12,702 --> 00:16:15,002
Is it normal that they
talk to the kid first?

305
00:16:15,004 --> 00:16:16,871
I-It's not out of the question.

306
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:18,272
But a kid could say anything.

307
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:19,607
Jacob could say anything.

308
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:21,375
Hey...

309
00:16:22,478 --> 00:16:24,879
Don't worry. Custody almost
always goes to the mother.

310
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:26,180
Unless the mother is me

311
00:16:26,182 --> 00:16:28,049
and the father is a manipulative psycho.

312
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:30,418
I read about a judge who
granted custody to a mother

313
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,520
who literally traded
her kid for Adderall.

314
00:16:34,924 --> 00:16:37,258
It is not okay that you're here.

315
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,793
I am here for you.

316
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:41,629
I don't need you here for me.
I don't want you here for me.

317
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:43,164
I want to support you.

318
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,498
Are you serious right now?

319
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,767
I gave you a great
opportunity to support me,

320
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:48,102
and you decided not to.

321
00:16:48,104 --> 00:16:50,438
- Bye.
- It wasn't what you wanted.

322
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,007
You are not the decider of what I want.

323
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:55,376
We are separate people.

324
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:57,211
Okay.

325
00:16:58,648 --> 00:17:00,948
We are separate people.

326
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:09,123
You've been living with your
grandmother for a while now.

327
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,725
Can you tell me about her?

328
00:17:10,727 --> 00:17:12,026
What about her?

329
00:17:12,028 --> 00:17:13,160
What's she like?

330
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:14,996
She plays a lot of games with me.

331
00:17:14,998 --> 00:17:16,430
She makes me laugh.

332
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:17,531
She feeds me.

333
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:20,368
She's married to a new guy named Rob.

334
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,903
And what do you think about Rob?

335
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:24,271
He's awesome.

336
00:17:24,273 --> 00:17:26,073
He makes me laugh, too.

337
00:17:26,075 --> 00:17:28,175
He says he has the
biggest lawnmower in town,

338
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:29,710
and Nana has the biggest lawn.

339
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:34,415
It's a joke about sex.

340
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:37,585
How do you know it's a joke about sex?

341
00:17:37,587 --> 00:17:39,520
Because I'm old enough to know.

342
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:42,723
What about your mom?

343
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:45,226
She's my mom.

344
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:46,927
Come on, Jacob.

345
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:48,462
I've done this a thousand times.

346
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:53,401
You're obviously a mature kid,
so be real with me.

347
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:55,036
She has a lot of hard nights.

348
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:57,505
And what happens
when she has hard nights?

349
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:01,976
Jacob?

350
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:04,011
What happens when she has hard nights?

351
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:05,346
I don't know.

352
00:18:05,348 --> 00:18:07,848
She probably drinks vodka
or something else bad.

353
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,116
She's been in jail.

354
00:18:09,118 --> 00:18:13,187
I do know that, yes.

355
00:18:13,189 --> 00:18:17,191
My dad was a porn star, but not anymore.

356
00:18:17,193 --> 00:18:19,794
He doesn't know I know that.

357
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:21,595
I look like my dad,

358
00:18:21,597 --> 00:18:23,297
but I don't know anything else about him

359
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:25,966
except that he does commercials
and I look like him.

360
00:18:25,968 --> 00:18:28,936
Would you like to get to
know your dad better, Jacob?

361
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:30,638
I guess so.

362
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,408
Has your mom ever talked
to you about your race?

363
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,111
Yeah, just a few days ago.

364
00:18:39,415 --> 00:18:41,215
What are you writing down?

365
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:43,484
Just a few notes to myself.

366
00:18:43,486 --> 00:18:46,887
I know you think my mom is
a bad mom, but she's not.

367
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:48,322
She loves me.

368
00:18:48,324 --> 00:18:50,758
Of course she loves you.

369
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,893
And I don't think she's a bad mom,

370
00:18:52,895 --> 00:18:55,996
but she struggles with some other things.

371
00:18:55,998 --> 00:18:58,799
Yeah.

372
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:02,403
It's nice that your father
seems to really want the chance

373
00:19:02,405 --> 00:19:05,506
to get to know you, and you
want to get to know him, too.

374
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:08,042
I want you to make my
mom and my dad be married

375
00:19:08,044 --> 00:19:09,732
so they'll have to love each other.

376
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:12,379
Then they can do a good job together.

377
00:19:12,381 --> 00:19:16,016
In a perfect world,
I'd make that happen for you,

378
00:19:16,018 --> 00:19:18,853
but this world isn't perfect.

379
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,356
I'm sorry, Jacob.

380
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:24,725
But I have to think about

381
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:27,862
which parent you should live with.

382
00:19:27,864 --> 00:19:30,197
Who would you rather it be?

383
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,766
Okay, we'll take 15,

384
00:20:09,768 --> 00:20:12,102
and then Jacob will go to the
playroom around the corner

385
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:14,270
with Vicky while the rest of us talk.

386
00:20:16,641 --> 00:20:17,974
How did it go?

387
00:20:17,976 --> 00:20:19,676
I have to go to the bathroom.

388
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,045
It's right over there.

389
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,182
I don't know.

390
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:32,155
This one is for boys.

391
00:20:32,157 --> 00:20:33,490
I know. It's fine.

392
00:20:33,492 --> 00:20:34,624
Are you mad?

393
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:37,227
No, baby. I'm not mad, but I'm confused.

394
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:39,396
Why wouldn't you talk to me out there?

395
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:40,463
I don't know.

396
00:20:40,465 --> 00:20:42,065
Yes, you do.

397
00:20:43,902 --> 00:20:45,335
I don't want you to kill yourself.

398
00:20:45,337 --> 00:20:46,970
Why would you say that?

399
00:20:46,972 --> 00:20:49,839
Who gave you the impression
that I might kill myself?

400
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:51,908
Dad.

401
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:55,078
Sean.

402
00:20:57,783 --> 00:20:59,449
So he sat you down and said,

403
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:03,086
"Jacob, did you know
your mom might kill herself?"

404
00:21:03,088 --> 00:21:04,821
He said if you had
to be my mom full time,

405
00:21:04,823 --> 00:21:07,190
you would probably kill yourself
because of the pressure.

406
00:21:07,192 --> 00:21:11,294
That is a lie.

407
00:21:11,296 --> 00:21:13,396
He told me you tried before.

408
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:14,931
Did you?

409
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:19,102
Yes.

410
00:21:19,104 --> 00:21:20,804
A very long time ago,

411
00:21:20,806 --> 00:21:23,740
which has nothing to do with
what is happening right now.

412
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:26,276
See, this is what
I'm talking about, Jacob.

413
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:27,811
Your father is not a good man.

414
00:21:27,813 --> 00:21:29,679
For him to bring that up...

415
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:32,916
He... I'm sorry he
brought that up to you.

416
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:34,150
I don't want you to hate him.

417
00:21:34,152 --> 00:21:35,685
He told me good things, too.

418
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:37,253
Like what?

419
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:39,656
He said I can be the
president if I want to be.

420
00:21:39,658 --> 00:21:41,491
Obviously you could be the president.

421
00:21:41,493 --> 00:21:43,526
- I could have told you that.
- But you didn't.

422
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:45,328
Because it's a job for an egomaniac,

423
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,298
and you're not an egomaniac.

424
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,537
Do you want to go live with Sean?

425
00:21:55,574 --> 00:21:57,507
Look at me.

426
00:21:57,509 --> 00:21:59,075
Do you want to go live with him?

427
00:21:59,077 --> 00:22:00,643
I don't know.

428
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:03,546
Okay.

429
00:22:07,052 --> 00:22:09,552
It's okay that you don't know.

430
00:22:49,394 --> 00:22:51,494
My client hopes that...

431
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:53,763
...you consider what
a significant loss it's been

432
00:22:53,765 --> 00:22:56,966
for him to be robbed of the
opportunity to know his son.

433
00:22:56,968 --> 00:22:59,702
I would hope your conversation
with Jacob granted you

434
00:22:59,704 --> 00:23:02,396
some insight into how important
Ms. Raines is to her son.

435
00:23:02,421 --> 00:23:05,141
I appreciate all of your points of view.

436
00:23:05,143 --> 00:23:08,878
I know that you love Jacob.

437
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,614
I know that you love Jacob,

438
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:15,418
but there are a few details
that complicate this matter.

439
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,987
Though it is noted that Ms. Raines

440
00:23:17,989 --> 00:23:20,256
was released from her sentence early,

441
00:23:20,258 --> 00:23:22,692
it is also worth noting that Mr. Barron,

442
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:25,662
while not a part of Jacob's
life until recently,

443
00:23:25,664 --> 00:23:29,132
may be the more natural
parent in this case.

444
00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:31,734
- And...
- "The more natural parent"?

445
00:23:31,736 --> 00:23:34,871
In my observation, Jacob may benefit

446
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:38,241
from a primary caretaker with
whom he shares a common culture.

447
00:23:38,243 --> 00:23:40,543
What does that mean? "A common culture."

448
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:43,046
I believe, honey, she's saying
something along the lines of

449
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:44,314
Blacks should stay together.

450
00:23:44,316 --> 00:23:46,115
No. No, that is not what I'm saying.

451
00:23:46,117 --> 00:23:47,450
She's saying Jacob needs a parent

452
00:23:47,452 --> 00:23:49,752
who understands
what it means to be black.

453
00:23:49,754 --> 00:23:52,121
It could be very good for Jacob

454
00:23:52,123 --> 00:23:53,890
to spend more time with someone who has

455
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:57,760
a personal understanding of his
heritage, where he came from.

456
00:23:57,762 --> 00:24:00,163
You mean my vagina,
because that's where he came from.

457
00:24:00,165 --> 00:24:02,398
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry. I-I didn't...

458
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,701
My client is understandably
emotional, Ms. Shane.

459
00:24:04,703 --> 00:24:07,003
Are you really making custody
recommendations based on

460
00:24:07,005 --> 00:24:08,871
something as superficial
as the child's skin tone?

461
00:24:08,873 --> 00:24:10,206
I beg your pardon,

462
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,108
but racial identity is
far from superficial.

463
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,309
You might want to rethink going down...

464
00:24:13,311 --> 00:24:14,777
Okay, wait. Hold on.

465
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:15,979
I'm sorry.

466
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:18,781
I understand that Sean
is his father, clearly,

467
00:24:18,783 --> 00:24:20,016
but I'm his mother.

468
00:24:20,018 --> 00:24:22,518
And seeing how I was robbed
of the opportunity before,

469
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,821
I deserve a chance to be his father.

470
00:24:24,823 --> 00:24:27,056
I think Mr. Barron makes a good point.

471
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:29,492
Please listen to me. I know my son.

472
00:24:29,494 --> 00:24:32,161
He's kind and he's soft-spoken.

473
00:24:32,163 --> 00:24:35,298
Competition and all that male
bullshit make him anxious.

474
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,600
He's smart, but he's fragile.

475
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:39,869
He gets that from me. I'm fragile.

476
00:24:39,871 --> 00:24:42,972
- He's also very observant.
- He also gets that from her.

477
00:24:42,974 --> 00:24:45,908
I've made a lot of mistakes.
Everyone knows that.

478
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,111
Jacob knows that.

479
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:50,079
My mother...

480
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:52,982
My mother has done an
amazing job raising him.

481
00:24:52,984 --> 00:24:55,518
But now Jacob needs to know

482
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,787
that his own mother can take care of him,

483
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,656
that his own mother wants him,

484
00:24:59,658 --> 00:25:01,691
that his own mother gets him.

485
00:25:01,693 --> 00:25:03,860
I get him because he's just like me.

486
00:25:03,862 --> 00:25:06,929
And those ingredients we're
made of aren't typical.

487
00:25:06,931 --> 00:25:10,767
They're hard to understand,
but they're intuitive to me.

488
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:12,902
I'm not trying to win an argument.

489
00:25:12,904 --> 00:25:16,372
I love him and I want to be his mother.

490
00:25:16,374 --> 00:25:19,509
Please, let me be his mom.

491
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:28,751
I will pass my recommendations
along to the family court,

492
00:25:28,753 --> 00:25:32,088
and a judge will make a
ruling by end of day Monday.

493
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,923
Until that decision is made,

494
00:25:33,925 --> 00:25:36,559
Jacob will remain in his
grandmother's custody.

495
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:38,795
This meeting is concluded.

496
00:25:38,797 --> 00:25:41,264
Thank you for your careful consideration.

497
00:25:41,266 --> 00:25:42,598
It is greatly appreciated.

498
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,801
Yes. Yes, thank you.

499
00:25:44,803 --> 00:25:46,269
Unbelievable.

500
00:25:46,271 --> 00:25:48,304
This is about what is best for Jacob.

501
00:25:51,142 --> 00:25:53,009
Come on.

502
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:54,277
Let's go home.

503
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:55,745
No, I just need to be alone for...

504
00:25:55,747 --> 00:25:58,014
- Letty.
- No, I need to be alone for a second.

505
00:26:00,952 --> 00:26:02,919
Give me a minute.

506
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:04,320
Okay.

507
00:26:11,996 --> 00:26:13,596
Congrats.

508
00:26:13,598 --> 00:26:15,431
Looks like you got everybody convinced

509
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:16,799
you're not who you really are.

510
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:18,134
Come on, now.

511
00:26:18,136 --> 00:26:19,235
Don't be a sore loser.

512
00:26:19,237 --> 00:26:20,503
No, no, no, no.

513
00:26:20,505 --> 00:26:22,538
It's really very impressive.

514
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,840
I mean, look at you.

515
00:26:23,842 --> 00:26:26,609
It's like "He is risen." Am I right?

516
00:26:26,611 --> 00:26:29,479
You came around, begging for those drugs,

517
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:30,947
and then you begged me to take you...

518
00:26:30,949 --> 00:26:33,883
"Take me, Sean. Take me, Sean."

519
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:36,719
Little strawberry, that's what you were.

520
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:39,222
Couldn't have shaken you
off of me if I tried.

521
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:40,857
Why are you doing this?

522
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:42,658
Don't act like what I'm doing is wrong.

523
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,494
I'm fighting for the
same thing that you are.

524
00:26:44,496 --> 00:26:45,795
We're just on different sides.

525
00:26:45,797 --> 00:26:47,830
I want to be a father to my son.

526
00:26:47,832 --> 00:26:50,433
Jacob does puzzles. He reads.

527
00:26:50,435 --> 00:26:52,435
He's reading "Where the Red Fern Grows"

528
00:26:52,437 --> 00:26:53,503
for the second time.

529
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:54,837
He is barely your son.

530
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,272
- I gave him that book.
- No, you didn't.

531
00:26:56,274 --> 00:26:58,408
Yes, I did. Ask him.

532
00:26:59,978 --> 00:27:01,811
Well, he really likes it.

533
00:27:01,813 --> 00:27:04,113
Good.

534
00:27:04,115 --> 00:27:07,717
Swear you aren't doing this to hurt me.

535
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:09,552
I swear.

536
00:27:09,554 --> 00:27:14,023
And, by the way, it's not always about you.

537
00:27:20,298 --> 00:27:22,799
There are some things that nev change.

538
00:27:46,977 --> 00:27:49,077
So how many nights you looking to stay?

539
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,778
When's checkout?

540
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,647
10:00 a.m.

541
00:27:54,851 --> 00:27:57,151
Better just make it two nights.

542
00:27:58,588 --> 00:28:00,188
Om 213.

543
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,390
Up the stairs, to your right.

544
00:28:15,338 --> 00:28:16,638
Letty.

545
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,875
They're probably giving custody to Sean.

546
00:28:20,877 --> 00:28:23,511
I want you to know that.

547
00:28:23,513 --> 00:28:26,648
So thanks.

548
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,949
Where are you?

549
00:28:27,951 --> 00:28:29,317
We can talk.

550
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:31,452
I don't want to see you.

551
00:28:31,454 --> 00:28:33,988
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?

552
00:29:24,674 --> 00:29:25,740
What do you want?

553
00:29:25,742 --> 00:29:28,042
Didn't know you were staying here, too.

554
00:29:28,044 --> 00:29:29,043
What?

555
00:29:29,045 --> 00:29:30,678
With Javier.

556
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,879
He's not staying here.

557
00:29:31,881 --> 00:29:34,048
Well, he was staying here
last night, in this room.

558
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:37,518
Well, he's not here anymore.

559
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,088
Mm.

560
00:29:45,995 --> 00:29:48,463
Stop.

561
00:30:04,347 --> 00:30:06,748
I know what you're doing.

562
00:30:10,386 --> 00:30:12,420
I know you know what I'm doing.

563
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,989
What are you doing?

564
00:33:01,991 --> 00:33:03,457
Please leave.

565
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:30,318
You were better in my memory.

566
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,680
Jacob?

567
00:36:10,146 --> 00:36:13,914
You are not coming into this house.
Get out of here.

568
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:16,650
Mom, wait. That guy is a friend.

569
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:18,052
A friend, really?

570
00:36:18,054 --> 00:36:21,956
Because that is an FBI agent.

571
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:26,560
Your friend brought an FBI
agent here to talk to you.

572
00:36:26,562 --> 00:36:28,462
Is she really an FBI agent?

573
00:36:32,201 --> 00:36:34,135
Rhonda Lashever.

574
00:36:34,971 --> 00:36:37,138
Come on, Letty. Open the door.

575
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,441
If you want custody
of your son on Monday,

576
00:36:40,443 --> 00:36:41,809
you will let us in.

577
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:50,851
You really should've
led with that tidbit.

578
00:36:50,853 --> 00:36:53,420
I would've let you in 10 minutes ago.

579
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:58,659
Who wants sandwiches?

580
00:37:05,285 --> 00:37:07,552
No mayo on mine, thanks.

581
00:37:14,187 --> 00:37:15,853
None for me.

582
00:37:15,855 --> 00:37:18,456
- Calcium's good for the bones.
- Not mine.

583
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:21,826
Well, it's your osteoporosis.

584
00:37:21,828 --> 00:37:23,661
If the lady doesn't have to have milk,

585
00:37:23,663 --> 00:37:25,363
I shouldn't have to have milk.

586
00:37:25,365 --> 00:37:27,265
That makes sense.

587
00:37:27,267 --> 00:37:28,966
You still have to have milk.

588
00:37:35,475 --> 00:37:38,342
Come on, Jacob. Let's go eat outside.

589
00:37:38,344 --> 00:37:40,278
Bye, Jacob.

590
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,050
So, what, you turn yourself in?

591
00:37:46,052 --> 00:37:47,418
I got caught.

592
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,520
Went in to quit, they
were waiting for me.

593
00:37:49,522 --> 00:37:51,422
Got fired, actually.

594
00:37:51,424 --> 00:37:52,990
Got fired.

595
00:37:52,992 --> 00:37:54,559
Thank you for clarifying.

596
00:37:54,561 --> 00:37:58,596
Your former parole officer, here...

597
00:37:58,598 --> 00:38:00,965
Come here.

598
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,108
So, your former parole officer, here,

599
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:13,010
starts telling us about
one of his former parolees,

600
00:38:13,012 --> 00:38:15,947
says he is the smartest
he ever worked with.

601
00:38:15,949 --> 00:38:18,850
Unconventional, real sharp thinker,

602
00:38:18,852 --> 00:38:21,853
wears wigs, that she...

603
00:38:21,855 --> 00:38:24,956
And the she is you, Ms. Raines,
in case you weren't following...

604
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:27,158
Had something to do with the $100,000

605
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,895
he had rolled up in a duffel
bag full of cheap sweaters.

606
00:38:30,897 --> 00:38:33,931
You said something about helping
me getting custody of Jacob?

607
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:36,801
They will also expunge your
entire criminal record.

608
00:38:36,803 --> 00:38:38,603
- You'll be able to...
- Then he starts talking about

609
00:38:38,605 --> 00:38:42,840
this suave Latin guy that's
hanging around with this woman.

610
00:38:42,842 --> 00:38:45,977
Said he was real mysterious.

611
00:38:45,979 --> 00:38:47,578
Ding.

612
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:50,114
I... I don't know.

613
00:38:50,116 --> 00:38:54,886
Something about the wigs and
the mysterious Latin guy...

614
00:38:54,888 --> 00:38:57,321
I just had a hunch that he might be a guy

615
00:38:57,323 --> 00:39:01,692
we've been looking for
for a very long time...

616
00:39:01,694 --> 00:39:03,594
A guy named Javier.

617
00:39:03,596 --> 00:39:05,029
What did you mean when you said

618
00:39:05,031 --> 00:39:07,031
you can help me get custody of my son?

619
00:39:07,033 --> 00:39:09,300
Finally, as you may have guessed by now,

620
00:39:09,302 --> 00:39:12,003
your parole officer said
that you, Ms. Raines,

621
00:39:12,005 --> 00:39:13,871
under the right circumstances,

622
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:17,108
might be willing to
help me locate this man.

623
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,709
Well, he was wrong.

624
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:20,244
That's interesting.

625
00:39:20,246 --> 00:39:23,347
I'm hoping that's not the case,
because, of course,

626
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:27,351
if your current circumstances
do produce that willingness,

627
00:39:27,353 --> 00:39:31,255
it sure would minimize
the hailstorm of iced shit

628
00:39:31,257 --> 00:39:33,724
that's about to come raining down on you.

629
00:39:33,726 --> 00:39:35,660
Just so you know, the way you talk

630
00:39:35,662 --> 00:39:37,562
makes you sound like an asshole.

631
00:39:37,564 --> 00:39:40,198
I'm an FBI agent, Ms. Raines.

632
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,067
I think you will find it
easier to deal with me

633
00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:44,702
if you change your attitude.

634
00:39:44,704 --> 00:39:47,138
- Or you could change your personality.
- Letty.

635
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,541
They will guarantee you
get custody of Jacob,

636
00:39:50,543 --> 00:39:53,010
and they'll wipe your entire record.

637
00:39:53,012 --> 00:39:55,246
They can use it to wipe their entire ass.

638
00:39:55,248 --> 00:39:58,816
You might be okay with selling
someone out, but I'm not.

639
00:39:58,818 --> 00:40:01,219
If I even knew who this guy was,
which I don't.

640
00:40:01,221 --> 00:40:02,486
Letty, I'm sorry.

641
00:40:02,488 --> 00:40:04,989
I'm sorry that I got caught,
but this is a good deal.

642
00:40:04,991 --> 00:40:09,193
I mean, they will erase all
of the shit from your past

643
00:40:09,195 --> 00:40:11,262
that stops you from...

644
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,331
You can start over.

645
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:14,765
Clean slate, with Jacob.

646
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:17,835
Clean slate, with Jacob.

647
00:40:22,175 --> 00:40:23,174
For sure?

648
00:40:23,176 --> 00:40:25,042
For sure.

649
00:40:25,044 --> 00:40:26,677
Ms. Raines.

650
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:30,181
We know your friend gets most of
his work through the Deep Web.

651
00:40:30,183 --> 00:40:33,851
All you have to do is give us his handle,

652
00:40:33,853 --> 00:40:35,786
then we'll offer him a job.

653
00:40:35,788 --> 00:40:36,854
I can't do that.

654
00:40:36,856 --> 00:40:38,322
I think you can.

655
00:40:38,324 --> 00:40:39,423
I don't know him.

656
00:40:39,425 --> 00:40:41,259
I think you do.

657
00:40:41,261 --> 00:40:42,727
I'm asking nicely,

658
00:40:42,729 --> 00:40:45,630
so I can see why you think you
have a little room to wiggle,

659
00:40:45,632 --> 00:40:48,399
but let me be clear with you.

660
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:50,801
I can tell the judge that he has no choice

661
00:40:50,803 --> 00:40:53,204
but to see the good in you on Monday,

662
00:40:53,206 --> 00:40:54,906
that he has no choice on Monday

663
00:40:54,908 --> 00:40:57,308
but to see what a wonderful
mother you will be

664
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,676
to little Jacob.

665
00:40:58,678 --> 00:41:00,845
Or I can do the opposite.

666
00:41:00,847 --> 00:41:02,546
Just do what she's asking.

667
00:41:02,548 --> 00:41:05,116
If he responds to our job
request, that's on him.

668
00:41:05,118 --> 00:41:07,952
We just need a little nudge
in the right direction.

669
00:41:07,954 --> 00:41:09,787
Nothing big, just a nudge.

670
00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:11,989
You want me to just nudge
him into a gas chamber.

671
00:41:11,991 --> 00:41:13,257
For the sake of little Jacob.

672
00:41:13,259 --> 00:41:15,159
Please stop calling him little Jacob.

673
00:41:15,161 --> 00:41:17,929
You're making him sound like a
character from "Oliver Twist."

674
00:41:17,931 --> 00:41:19,263
I'm losing patience, Ms. Raines.

675
00:41:19,265 --> 00:41:20,765
Please stop calling me Ms. Raines.

676
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:22,600
Please stop thinking
you have the power here.

677
00:41:22,602 --> 00:41:24,468
Oh, I definitely have the power here.

678
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,370
I don't know who that man is.

679
00:41:26,372 --> 00:41:28,472
You can leave now.

680
00:41:28,474 --> 00:41:30,274
If you change your mind,

681
00:41:30,276 --> 00:41:33,311
you have to do it by the end of the day.

682
00:41:34,514 --> 00:41:36,180
Tomorrow is too late.

683
00:41:36,182 --> 00:41:38,516
Let me know.

684
00:41:38,518 --> 00:41:41,452
He has my info.

685
00:41:51,564 --> 00:41:52,930
I'm so sorry.

686
00:41:52,932 --> 00:41:54,298
How could you put me in that position?

687
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,967
Because I hunted you down to a hotel

688
00:41:55,969 --> 00:41:58,869
where you convinced me to
help you steal $200,000

689
00:41:58,871 --> 00:42:00,771
- and then I got arrested.
- You're saying this is my fault?

690
00:42:00,773 --> 00:42:03,074
- I'm saying you started it.
- Oh, my God.

691
00:42:03,076 --> 00:42:05,309
And I'm really glad you did.

692
00:42:05,311 --> 00:42:07,845
That was the best day of my life.

693
00:42:07,847 --> 00:42:09,880
I'd do it all again.

694
00:42:09,882 --> 00:42:14,018
And if the final outcome of all
of this is you getting Jacob...

695
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,786
I mean, holy shit.

696
00:42:15,788 --> 00:42:18,723
That'll be the best day of yo life.

697
00:42:22,595 --> 00:42:24,195
He's a murderer.

698
00:42:24,197 --> 00:42:26,097
Letty, all you have to do

699
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:28,632
is give them his name on that Web thing.

700
00:42:28,634 --> 00:42:30,868
You can even give it to me.
I'll give it to them.

701
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,303
Javier is not a moron.

702
00:42:32,305 --> 00:42:34,572
If that car alarm of a woman contacts him,

703
00:42:34,574 --> 00:42:35,906
he'll know something's up.

704
00:42:35,908 --> 00:42:38,142
Then there's nothing
to be conflicted about.

705
00:42:38,144 --> 00:42:42,380
Betrayal is not a tree falling in a forest.

706
00:42:56,863 --> 00:43:00,197
You feel like telling me
why I was making sandwiches

707
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:03,434
for your parole officer
and a fed this afternoon?

708
00:43:03,436 --> 00:43:06,303
Because you offered them sandwiches.

709
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:10,474
I'll wait.

710
00:43:11,944 --> 00:43:14,512
They wanted me to rat on
one of my old dealers.

711
00:43:16,215 --> 00:43:17,415
Okay.

712
00:43:17,417 --> 00:43:20,351
And how does Jacob fit into that request?

713
00:43:20,353 --> 00:43:24,355
In a quid pro quo sort of way.

714
00:43:27,193 --> 00:43:31,996
I-If you have a picture of that drug dealer

715
00:43:31,998 --> 00:43:33,431
they want you to flip on,

716
00:43:33,433 --> 00:43:35,766
we could do a side-by-side comparison,

717
00:43:35,768 --> 00:43:38,135
decide which one is cuter.

718
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:44,809
Maybe I'm crossing the line by asking,

719
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:48,446
but where on earth is that man of yours?

720
00:43:48,448 --> 00:43:50,381
He's not my man.

721
00:43:50,383 --> 00:43:53,150
Of course he is.

722
00:43:53,152 --> 00:43:57,955
If I were you, I would go find him

723
00:43:57,957 --> 00:44:03,961
and apologize for whatever it is you did.

724
00:45:52,905 --> 00:45:54,438
What can I get you?

725
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,374
Oh, I think...

726
00:45:58,945 --> 00:46:00,211
I'll have a milkshake.

727
00:46:00,213 --> 00:46:03,347
Chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry?

728
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:04,515
I don't know.

729
00:46:04,517 --> 00:46:06,450
What do you think I should get?

730
00:46:06,452 --> 00:46:08,219
For you, I'd go with strawberry.

731
00:46:08,221 --> 00:46:10,955
Why's that?

732
00:46:10,957 --> 00:46:12,623
You want vanilla?

733
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:16,527
No, I think you're right. Strawberry.

734
00:46:48,561 --> 00:46:49,660
Hi.

735
00:46:49,662 --> 00:46:51,128
Thanks for answering.

736
00:46:55,601 --> 00:46:56,634
Where are you?

737
00:46:56,636 --> 00:46:59,003
Nowhere, really.

738
00:47:00,673 --> 00:47:02,673
Nowhere?

739
00:47:02,675 --> 00:47:03,841
Where's that?

740
00:47:03,843 --> 00:47:06,777
I don't know.

741
00:47:06,779 --> 00:47:08,612
Are you sober?

742
00:47:08,614 --> 00:47:10,981
Are you my sponsor?

743
00:47:10,983 --> 00:47:13,050
I want to tell you something,

744
00:47:13,052 --> 00:47:14,785
and I want to do it when you're sober.

745
00:47:14,787 --> 00:47:16,320
What is it?

746
00:47:16,322 --> 00:47:19,390
Tell me you're sober first.

747
00:47:19,392 --> 00:47:21,625
Jesus, yes. I'm sober.

748
00:47:21,627 --> 00:47:24,094
Just say what you have to say.

749
00:47:24,096 --> 00:47:28,232
I'm sorry I could not do
what you asked me to do.

750
00:47:28,234 --> 00:47:30,567
And I'm sorry I hurt you.

751
00:47:32,004 --> 00:47:33,203
Letty?

752
00:47:33,205 --> 00:47:35,739
I'm here.

753
00:47:35,741 --> 00:47:37,675
Good.

754
00:47:37,677 --> 00:47:41,645
I wanted you to know that
before I say goodbye.

755
00:47:41,647 --> 00:47:43,180
What?

756
00:47:43,182 --> 00:47:45,749
You're not saying goodbye.

757
00:47:45,751 --> 00:47:48,452
I am.

758
00:47:48,454 --> 00:47:50,788
No, you're not.
Don't be such a drama queen.

759
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:52,723
Okay.

760
00:47:52,725 --> 00:47:53,924
It's still goodbye.

761
00:47:53,926 --> 00:47:56,727
- No, it's not.
- Take care of yourself, Letty.

762
00:48:27,727 --> 00:48:30,957
