00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:51,750
FEMALE REPORTER: <i>For decades,
millions of people have come here</i>

2

<i>in search of the American Dream,</i>

the state are losing their jobs every day.</i>

6

NARRATOR: <i>Are you homeless, or
living in a bad neighbourhood?</i>

7
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:12,738
FEMALE REPORTER: <i>Unemployment shot up to
its highest level in nearly 26 years.</i>

8
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,175
NARRATOR: <i>If the "American
Dream" broke its promise to you,</i>

00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:18,477
<i>don't worry, we have an answer.</i>

10

50 CENT: <i>Let me help
you help yourself.</i>

11
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,321
I'm gonna give you three and a half grams.
You know what to do with this?

12
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:32,157
'Cause if you know what to do
with it, you gonna be all right.

13
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:39,164
NARRATOR: <i>Welcome to the game.
This is your guide book.</i>

<i>Our experts are going to give
you everything you need.</i>

15
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:47,172
It's very easy to make a lot of
money with cocaine. (LAUGHS)

16
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,708
NARRATOR: <i>You could have a six
figure starting salary...</i>

17
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,312
It's hard for me to believe that something
that small could be worth so much money.

18
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:55,781
NARRATOR: <i>You can make a
million dollars in a week.</i>

to focus on marijuana and cocaine,</i>

22
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:15,601
but the same lessons work for any illegal
substance Americans are willing to buy,

23
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:20,539
<i>or climb to the very top of the

<i>This training guide</i>

26
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,895
BOBBY CARLTON:
<i>Name's Bobby Carlton,</i>

27
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:46,498
I've lived pretty much
in every ghetto town,

28
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,235
and my mom had it rough raising us.
She had me very young.

29
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:53,772
<i>A year after I was, uh,
born, my brother was born.</i>

30
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,375
<i>Years later,</i>
<i>I'd have two sisters.</i>

31
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:58,911
Stepfather, two sisters,
he'd eventually leave,

32
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:00,846
<i>and then she'd be</i>
<i>stuck with four kids.</i>

33
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,781
She'd basically just
try to raise a family

34
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:06,485
and try to earn enough
to put food on the table.

35
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:09,588
I look at people, they got to get
up, they got to be in an office,

36
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,658
they got to go to a factory, they got
to bang their heads against a wall,

37
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,593
<i>they're trying</i>
<i>to earn, earn, earn,</i>

38
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:17,529
but really, what they're doing is
just barely making their payments.

39
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:21,700
(STUTTERS) <i>They're
working just to get by.</i>

40
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,570
<i>I wanted to make</i>
<i>money to go live.</i>

41
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:27,673
I was always looking up
to the bigger kids,

42
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:30,542
who, people I perceived cool
and trying to emulate them.

43
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,445
The guys hanging on the
street corner, not working,

44
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:36,615
<i>they have girls, they have
cars, they have money,</i>

45
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:41,253
they seemingly don't ever have to
be anywhere at any certain time.

46
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,754
And I want in. I'm in.

47
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,459
NARRATOR: <i>What Bobby Carlton
was about to discover</i>

48
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:49,181
<i>is that marijuana makes money.</i>

49
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,998
<i>More money than tobacco,</i>
<i>cotton, even corn.</i>

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,704
<i>It's the most profitable
farmed product in the country.</i>

51
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,573
I smoked a joint, and then
you just get into it.

52
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,975
And then other
people want to do it.

53
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:08,547
<i>Seven joints were in a bag,</i>
<i>it's a dollar for a joint,</i>

54
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,515
<i>you pay $5 for that bag.</i>

55
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,851
Okay. I'll buy a bag,
break it down,

56
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,920
sell five joints,
smoke two myself.

57
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,356
It's kind of innocent, right?

58
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,824
CARLTON: <i>Ninth grade...</i>

59
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:25,364
<i>but then they were like, "How
many grams are in an ounce?"</i>

60
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:29,001
<i>They were like, "How many pounds
are in a kilo?" I was like, "2.2."</i>

61
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:31,536
"And do you want me to tell
you how much that costs?"

62
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:34,138
Hence, everybody at school knew
what I was up to that day.

63
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:42,748
NARRATOR: <i>If Bobby Carlton
can do it, so can you.</i>

64
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:48,954
<i>How do you expand from a small circle
of friends and attract more clients?</i>

65
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:53,292
Making money selling drugs is easy.
(LAUGHS)

66
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:56,662
NARRATOR: <i>Meet Pepe, a retired
Southern California drug dealer,</i>

67
00:04:56,664 --> 00:05:00,365
<i>who's going to tell you how
simple it is to get customers.</i>

68
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:06,071
Like I say, is not hard.
Everybody can do it.

69
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:09,041
Well, you just walk out to
the street and the park

70
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:13,845
and everybody is gonna say, "Hey! Spark
it up," and you'll start rolling.

71
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:17,349
If you smoke outside, you make a
friend, because weed makes friends.

72
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,985
Weed makes friends.

73
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,389
NARRATOR: <i>Now that you've
got some customers,</i>

74
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,791
<i>you're gonna need some product.</i>

75
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:26,958
<i>Where do you get it?</i>

76
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,396
NEILL FRANKLIN: <i>Most people
know where to get it,</i>

77
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:35,434
and if you don't know where to
get marijuana in bulk to sell,

78
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:38,370
all you have to do is ask one or two
people, and someone's gonna know.

79
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:42,374
People will front you as
many drugs as you can sell.

80
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:45,410
As long as you can continue to pay people
back, they will front them to you.

81
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,452
NARRATOR: <i>And if you want to skip the middle men?
Grow your own weed.</i>

82
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,554
Pepe spent quite a few winters making a lot
of money without ever having to leave home.

83
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:59,691
To grow some weed, uh, in your
house, you only need electricity,

84
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,094
big lamps, and water.

85
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:04,863
PEPE: <i>You get in the internet,</i>
<i>you have the seeds, you know.</i>

86
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,667
CARLTON: <i>This is just kind of
like a starter kit for people.</i>

87
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:13,505
<i>You can get it at any hydroponics
store and get your whole set-up.</i>

88
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:17,075
<i>They'll sell you the tubes, the
nutrients, the little planters.</i>

89
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:20,412
<i>In about 45 days, these will
grow to about six feet tall,</i>

90
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:22,514
be lush, green, and lovely.

91
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:29,388
<i>Let it dry for a couple of days,
and then pick all the buds off.</i>

92
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,723
NARRATOR: <i>So how much money
can you expect to make?</i>

93
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,859
Yeah, you can make
a lot of money.

94
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:36,595
I mean, like, is gonna grow
a pound for each plant,

95
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:39,431
and a pound in the streets

96
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:42,868
goes $2,500, $3,000,
if it is a good weed.

97
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,537
Per 10, how much you gonna have?

98
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,072
$30,000.

99
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,710
In three months, people,
they doing a whole house.

100
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:54,579
If you put 50, 150 thousand.

101
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,750
(LAUGHS)

102
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,586
NARRATOR: <i>For many dealers, the
risk of jail time is worth it.</i>

103
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,889
You make $100,000 selling drugs.

104
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:07,459
Hide the money, and go to jail, and
when you come out, you have money.

105
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,762
If somebody gave me $100,000
to go to jail for five years,

106
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,964
I would take it, you know.

107
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,633
What the fuck. I mean, you...

108
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,134
Sometimes, you work 10 years

109
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:19,504
and you don't even see $20,000
in your bank account.

110
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,775
NARRATOR: <i>But the nearly one million
Americans arrested each year for marijuana</i>

111
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,479
<i>are caught on possession charges,
and never even sold a joint.</i>

112
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,715
<i>Given the risks, you'll want to
save your money as fast as you can</i>

113
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,717
<i>and start trading</i>
<i>more expensive drugs.</i>

114
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,086
I got into cocaine,
and I loved it.

115
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:40,725
NARRATOR: <i>When it comes to cocaine,
America is the land of opportunity.</i>

116
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:44,162
<i>It's the number one consumer
of coke in the world.</i>

117
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,198
WOMAN: <i>The largest study</i>
<i>of bank notes</i>

118
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,667
<i>has found that nearly
nine out of 10 bills</i>

119
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:51,903
<i>circulating in the U.S.</i>
<i>are tainted with cocaine.</i>

120
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,238
NARRATOR: <i>It's a law of nature.</i>

121
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,540
<i>Where there's demand,</i>
<i>there's supply.</i>

122
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,242
<i>And that's where you come in.</i>

123
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:59,244
<i>The life of a coke dealer</i>
<i>isn't easy.</i>

124
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:02,247
<i>When you start out,</i>
<i>you're alone, unprotected,</i>

125
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:05,984
<i>at the bottom of a ruthless,
international crime syndicate.</i>

126
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:10,222
<i>Most of the world's cocaine is manufactured
by drug lords in South America.</i>

127
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:13,825
<i>They smuggle over 500 tons into the U.S.
every year.</i>

128
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:17,195
<i>Along the way, it passes through
a long line of distributers,</i>

129
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,164
<i>until a couple</i>
<i>of grams get to you,</i>

130
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,501
<i>a pawn in a massive,</i>
<i>70 billion dollar game.</i>

131
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:31,009
Pawns, man, in the game,
they get capped quick.

132
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,578
They be out the game early.

133
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,780
Unless they some
smart ass pawns.

134
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:43,288
NARRATOR: <i>Curtis Jackson, otherwise
known as 50 Cent, had to learn quick.</i>

135
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,892
My mom hustled to provide
for me, financially.

136
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:51,763
And her friends were all the people that
were out selling drugs as a lifestyle.

137
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,032
NARRATOR: <i>Curtis was
raised without a father,</i>

138
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,902
<i>and his mother was murdered
when he was eight years old.</i>

139
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,904
My mom was all I had,

140
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:04,643
so when I lost her, I lost everything
that was pretty much good in my life.

141
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,078
<i>Her old friends</i>
<i>bought me things,</i>

142
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,214
<i>then they got tired</i>
<i>of just buying me things.</i>

143
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,817
They gave me an eight
ball of cocaine.

144
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,288
And they told me,
if anybody bothers you,

145
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,757
you know, you tell them
you got it from us,

146
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:22,327
and you'll be all right
in the neighbourhood.

147
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:25,630
I was about 12 years old
when that happened to me.

148
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,169
NARRATOR: <i>That's the incredible
thing about cocaine.</i>

149
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,906
<i>You can use it to make ends meet
when there are no other options.</i>

150
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,943
<i>You can be anybody, even a kid.</i>

151
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:42,047
I would say about 14 or 15. That's when I
pretty much started into the drug trade.

152
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:46,685
NARRATOR: <i>Let's say you're down and out,
like John was, living in South Central L.A.,</i>

153
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,320
<i>crashing at your family's place,</i>

154
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:50,722
<i>with no money,</i>
<i>not even for food.</i>

155
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,925
HARRIEL: <i>We were living in the
back of my uncle's house.</i>

156
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,126
<i>He had this lemon tree, and one
day he came out and he was like,</i>

157
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:59,698
We didn't have no food. You know, me and
my mom was eating lemons for dinner.

158
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,733
So, after that,
I had to get paid.

159
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,237
<i>The money that you could make
on the corner was real good.</i>

160
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:10,342
I started off with small amounts,
then I got to the big amounts.

161
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:14,346
NARRATOR: <i>Crack, the most popular form
of cocaine sold in the open market.</i>

162
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:17,682
<i>It's cheaper than powder, so low
income users can afford it.</i>

163
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,284
<i>When you work</i>
<i>for an organization,</i>

164
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,120
<i>they'll supply you with</i>
<i>$10 crack cocaine rocks.</i>

165
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,222
<i>Because most of your</i>
<i>customers are addicts,</i>

166
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,325
<i>they'll be impatient to make a
buy right out on the street.</i>

167
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,795
<i>And the good thing about crack
fiends is they'll keep coming back.</i>

168
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,965
Some guys will make anywhere
from $1,000 to $10,000 a day.

169
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,374
MAN: <i>Are you the man
with them jumbo 6s?</i>

170
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,843
I'll take about three
or four hundred.

171
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,112
Damn. (GUN COCKING)

172
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,881
(LAUGHS)

173
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:58,256
50 CENT: <i>It's harder than functioning
in mainstream or corporate America</i>

174
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,759
<i>because the dynamics</i>
<i>of it is different.</i>

175
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:05,263
In order to take a position in that
world, you can just, "pow." Just shoot.

176
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,365
CARLTON: <i>The chances of getting
robbed are pretty great, you know?</i>

177
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,135
You do as much as you
can to minimize that,

178
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,303
but somebody at some point
is gonna want what you have,

179
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,105
and they're not gonna have
the money to pay for it.

180
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,007
They are gonna try
and take it from you.

181
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:21,012
<i>With 30 years' experience investigating
the criminal drug world.</i>

182
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:26,918
If I steal a television set out
of, uh, you know, Best Buy,

183
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,256
it lists for $1,000, I'll sell
it for $200 on the street.

184
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:36,027
If I go rob the dope dealer,
I get all his cash,

185
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,295
and I get drugs.

186
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,364
And the advantage
of stolen drugs is

187
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,267
when I steal a guy's coke
that's worth $1,000,

188
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,436
I get to sell it for $1,000!

189
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,471
There's no discount
for hot dope.

190
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:47,939
MAN: Ever happened to you?

191
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,774
Mmm.

192
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,776
Not me. No, I never had
no problems like that.

193
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,479
'Cause at the end of the day, you fuck
me, you gonna know what's happening.

194
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:59,050
Are you gonna give them your drugs or
are you gonna tell them to fuck off?

195
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,286
And I'm the person
that's gonna say fuck off.

196
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:04,456
If you don't have a pistol, I don't
know why you even selling dope.

197
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,325
You won't last. 'Cause
somebody gonna try you.

198
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:10,428
FRANKLIN: <i>Anyone who is dealing
drugs in this community,</i>

199
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:14,199
<i>if they do not have a gun on
them, believe me, it's close by.</i>

200
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:18,303
<i>It's under a stoop, right around a
corner, tucked behind a phone booth,</i>

201
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:19,471
but it's close by.

202
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:23,308
They look up in your face,
they look up in your eye,

203
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,343
they see the gun and they
know who's gonna use it,

204
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,444
who ain't gonna use it.

205
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,316
A, assess. "Don't shoot
them, kill them."

206
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,019
Because if you shoot them, you gonna
make them angry enough to come back

207
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,187
and really hurt you.

208
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,356
So, if you're gonna shoot,
shoot to kill.

209
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:43,128
It was like motherfuckers were shooting
each other every day on the news.

210
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,498
It was like, New York, very much
like a stabbing society, you know.

211
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,267
Something goes wrong, somebody
sticks a knife in your chest.

212
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,970
It was a drug deal gone bad,
I got the worst of it.

213
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,839
Stabbed here, stabbed
here, stabbed here.

214
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:59,110
Once in the back of the head, once in
the chest, entered the left ventricle,

215
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,913
and this is from
the open heart surgery.

216
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:09,287
<i>I don't want to say it's a miracle, but
the doctor brought me back to life.</i>

217
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,257
NARRATOR: <i>If you really want to
lower your risk of getting hurt,</i>

218
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:15,994
<i>stabbed or shot, packing a
gun can only get you so far.</i>

219
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,062
<i>Hiring backup is a great idea.</i>

220
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,397
Who do I hire?

221
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,367
Do I hire nobody...
Nobody's heard of?

222
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,869
Or do I hire a guy who's
got the biggest reputation

223
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,138
for being the craziest
motherfucker?

224
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:32,277
The illegal drug market hires people
with reputations for violence.

225
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,946
NARRATOR: <i>But don't think just because
you have a gun and a few guys,</i>

226
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:37,882
<i>you can just go out and
start acquiring territory.</i>

227
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:42,954
Officer Neill Franklin served 33 years on the
Maryland State and Baltimore police forces.

228
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:46,424
<i>Having overseen 17 drug task
forces, he can tell you,</i>

229
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,326
<i>if you want to be</i>
<i>a corner hustler,</i>

230
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,295
<i>you're gonna need</i>
<i>permission first.</i>

231
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:53,932
FRANKLIN: <i>As you try to
acquire your market place,</i>

232
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:57,001
<i>there's probably gonna</i>
<i>be someone already there.</i>

233
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:01,005
<i>They're not going to share or give
up their territory that easily.</i>

234
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,275
They're not going to share
it or give it up. Period.

235
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,277
They would definitely
approach you,

236
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:12,183
trying to sell it in an area
without someone's consent.

237
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,453
So I registered with the neighbourhood
thugs, and that's how I got on.

238
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,555
Basically, you got to
protect your neighbourhood,

239
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:20,158
and do the things that the
organization require you to do.

240
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,928
FRANKLIN: <i>I remember
having a homicide one day,</i>

241
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,196
and they set
this inmate before me.

242
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,435
<i>Two seconds into the conversation, I
realize I used to play with this kid</i>

243
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:31,603
<i>and knew his brothers.</i>

244
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:35,506
"How'd you get in here?" He said,
"Well, I'm in here for homicide."

245
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:39,377
He says, "Well, I was in the game.
I was in the game."

246
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,347
"And in an alley
behind Callow Street,."

247
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:45,116
"I had to do what I had to do, and
I ended up taking someone's life"

248
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:49,554
"defending myself because I
had to defend my territory"

249
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,923
"and my business."

250
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:55,159
NARRATOR: <i>So now you know what it takes to
make it on the street in the open market.</i>

251
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:58,496
But prices for drugs nowadays are way
cheaper than when Big John was selling,

252
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,365
<i>and the risks are just as high.</i>

253
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,367
<i>If you don't wind up</i>
<i>getting killed by rivals,</i>

254
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,968
<i>or hooked on your own product,</i>

255
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:09,407
<i>In today's drug market, you're risking
your life for less than minimum wage.</i>

256
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:13,344
If you want to go for the real money,
you got to get off the corner.

257
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,358
<i>Detroit. City of opportunity.</i>

258
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,995
<i>Once upon a time, the symbol
of America's might and power.</i>

259

<i>The heart of our</i>
<i>manufacturing industry.</i>

260
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,600
<i>The home of the American Dream.</i>

261
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:44,642
<i>One of the highest unemployment
rates in the nation.</i>

262
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:48,980
<i>Twenty-five percent of the population
has left in the last 10 years.</i>

263
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:54,118
<i>For those without a job or who
can't move, they need to hustle.</i>

264
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,089
<i>Mr. X wants to get out of the downward
spiral that's hit Detroit today.</i>

265
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,959
<i>And he's going to tell you</i>
<i>what that means.</i>

266
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:06,030
<i>Or coke, or whatever the fuck
they're selling that's illegal.</i>

267
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,032
<i>Because that's the only way out.</i>

268
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:11,336
<i>I have a lot of bills.</i>
<i>I got rent to pay.</i>

269
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:15,206
<i>But don't nobody really care
about your problems, man.</i>

270
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,509
<i>You got to have the money, so,
welcome to the cocaine game.</i>

271
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,647
<i>I rarely show</i>

<i>Oh, man, I play</i>

00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,621
<i>That's crazy.</i>
<i>That's too much work.</i>

285
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,423
<i>I just made that shit</i>
<i>in a phone call.</i>

286
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:07,625
<i>The American Dream is
just to have enough money</i>

287
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:10,661
<i>to be able to do whatever you want
to do, whenever you want to do it,</i>

288
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:13,264
<i>based on your own hard work.</i>

289
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,500
<i>Shit, just what I have on the
counter would probably get me</i>

290
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:18,236
<i>anywhere from 10 years</i>
<i>to about 15 years.</i>

291
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:23,508
<i>I'd rather be out here getting
it than not getting it at all,</i>

292
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:28,513
<i>I've been really trying to free
myself, use the coke to free myself.</i>

293
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:32,283
NARRATOR: <i>As a private cocaine dealer,
you'll be mostly selling Ts and eight balls,</i>

294
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:36,654
<i>sixteenth or eighth of an ounce little
baggies for up to 150 bucks a pop.</i>

295
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:39,123
<i>Ramping up to 20
customers a day is easy.</i>

296
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,393
<i>You'll be paying $500 for
your day's worth of cocaine,</i>

297
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,796
<i>and you'll cut it in</i>
<i>half with baby laxative,</i>

298
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:49,133
<i>which brings your profit to a total of a
grand a day, and you just got started.</i>

299
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,537
MR. X: <i>Fiends from outside</i>
<i>into your home.</i>

300
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:59,777
<i>They might bring the police with them,
with the wire taps and everything.</i>

301
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:05,416
<i>Man, they try to get as close to you as
possible, and you keep them at a distance.</i>

302
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,652
<i>But you got to keep</i>
<i>that friendship with them.</i>

303
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:10,588
<i>You can't be like, aggressive
with your customers.</i>

304
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:15,393
<i>You got to treat them fair, you got
to treat them like regular people.</i>

305
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:19,430
<i>Man, a stash spot</i>
<i>is stashed away, hidden.</i>

306
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:23,401
<i>Get that shit out the house,</i>
<i>keep it out the house.</i>

307
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,570
<i>Don't let nobody come</i>
<i>to the house to buy it.</i>

308
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:30,541
<i>I wouldn't put my money anywhere
that someone else can control it.</i>

309
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:34,679
<i>It'd be best to hide that
wherever you put your dope at.</i>

310
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,583
<i>You get about 500,000</i>
<i>or something like that.</i>

311
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:42,320
<i>Start me a couple businesses, man,
get right up out of this shit.</i>

312
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:45,590
<i>If you decide that you ever
want to pick up this game,</i>

313
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:49,193
<i>shit, pick it up for the right
reason, the money only.</i>

314
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:52,396
<i>Save from the time that you get it
to the time that you quit, man.</i>

315
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,465
<i>And you won't be in it so long.</i>

316
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,601
NARRATOR: <i>If you choose
to be a cocaine dealer,</i>

317
00:18:56,603 --> 00:19:02,707
If you're black, you're about four times as
likely to be arrested than a white dealer,

318
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:08,246
<i>because white Americans buy and
sell more cocaine than anyone else.</i>

319
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:11,582
It's the circumstances to where they're
actually setting up to sell the drugs,

320
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:15,219
See, the black drug dealers
will be in the neighborhoods

321
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:18,890
where the law enforcement will search
people without very much reasoning.

322
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:20,858
I mean, my first case,
it was like a fluke.

323
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:26,197
He, uh, ran where we're at. I
happened to be just standing outside,

324
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:28,166
and the police say,
"Get up against the fence."

325
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:31,235
And I'm like, "Man, come on, why I
got to get up against the fence?"

326
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,303
"Shut up."

327
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,405
Next thing you know,

328
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,574
they pulled this big brick out my pocket.
(CHUCKLES)

329
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,643
So, that was the beginning
of the end, right there.

330
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,811
NARRATOR: <i>You're not only
more likely to be arrested,</i>

331
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,281
<i>but prosecuted,</i>
<i>with heavy prison time.</i>

332
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:47,818
The reason that 94.5%
of people incarcerated

333
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,254
under the Rockefeller Drug
Laws are black and brown

334
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:51,956
is that's the way
the DA's operate.

335
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,692
NARRATOR: <i>Business mogul</i>
<i>Russell Simmons spent years</i>

336
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:58,329
<i>lobbying against the harsh Rockefeller
Drug Laws of New York City,</i>

337
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:01,966
which treated the non-violent crime
of drug dealing the same as murder.

338
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:04,202
I mean, imagine you're a model.

339
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,437
You know, a fashion model. You
know, like some blonde girl.

340
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,573
It doesn't matter where you're
from, you're not going to jail.

341
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,941
And if you're some guy
from the hood,

342
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:11,943
maybe you'll go
to jail for 20 years.

343
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:14,612
Hell, they tried
to give me 45 years.

344
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:18,749
So, I did a lot of time. I did, like
five years, spring something like that.

345
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:23,321
And a white drug dealer will be in middle
America, somewhere in the suburbs.

346
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:28,960
That isn't in a space where he can just be
searched for no reason at all or go to jail.

347
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:32,396
NARRATOR: <i>Curtis Jackson, Russell
Simmons, and many others</i>

348
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,332
<i>have successfully</i>
<i>persuaded New York</i>

349
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:37,568
<i>to reduce some of their</i>
<i>harsh sentencing practices.</i>

350
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,271
<i>But 90% of those</i>
<i>convicted on drug charges</i>

351
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:43,574
<i>are still African-American</i>
<i>and Latino.</i>

352
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,476
<i>Like they say for any business,</i>

353
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:49,347
<i>the golden rule, location,
location, location.</i>

354
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,317
MIKE WALZMAN: <i>I didn't care
if people knew where I lived.</i>

355
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,786
People would just come to my
house, and I would go outside

356
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,689
and just give them the gram, and we
would do the transaction that way.

357
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:03,461
In 2003, I was the main coke dealer
for all the private schools in L.A.

358
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:08,266
<i>If you're gonna be a private coke
dealer, this is the way to go.</i>

359
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,834
<i>In a nice, suburban</i>
<i>neighbourhood,</i>

360
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:12,837
<i>selling to the largest</i>
<i>cocaine market directly.</i>

361
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:17,541
<i>And already knew where to buy
cocaine for him and his friends.</i>

362
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:20,845
<i>So, he was in a perfect position
to go into business for himself.</i>

363
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:23,048
WALZMAN: <i>What's going on</i>
<i>through my head is,</i>

364
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:25,816
<i>just start selling drugs</i>
<i>to support my habit</i>

365
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:28,753
<i>and to support the
lifestyle that I wanted.</i>

366
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:31,889
People want drugs,
so I can sell drugs.

367
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,791
'Cause I know where
to get it already.

368
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,027
My first rock
was about this big,

369
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,629
and I remember
showing my friends this.

370
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:43,734
They were like, "No fucking way you have
this big of a rock with you right now",

371
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:45,369
"like, this is insane."

372
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,571
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

373
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:51,842
<i>It was like, "This is
awesome, this is exciting."</i>

374
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:58,649
The stories that grew out of me being
a coke dealer just went from this

375
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:02,653
to like, you know, this, and I was
suddenly, you know, the guy...

376
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,622
You know, that everyone's
talking about,

377
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:07,792
<i>I threw a party at</i>
<i>the L'Ermitage hotel,</i>

378
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,994
and I got, like,
the Penthouse suite.

379
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,663
<i>I've always wanted</i>
<i>to be loved and accepted.</i>

380
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:16,000
And that's what selling coke gave me.
It gave me that power,

381
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,469
it gave me the feeling
of acceptance.

382
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:21,339
It was definitely addictive
to be a drug dealer.

383
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,575
Not only the money
that you got from it,

384
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:26,811
<i>but the way people</i>
<i>talked about you,</i>

385
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:30,948
the way people looked at you,
the power that I felt from it.

386
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,686
I just liked having money. It gave
me security, it made me feel good.

387
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,422
People don't know what's a
gram, and what's not a gram,

388
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,091
they've never seen
coke before in their life.

389
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:43,027
<i>The market rate for a gram</i>
<i>was about $50 for coke,</i>

390
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,096
but if you're a rich girl
who didn't know anything,

391
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:50,101
I would probably sell you
.5 for about $60 to $75.

392
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:53,437
NARRATOR: <i>A guy like Mike makes
half as much as our Detroit dealer,</i>

393
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:56,741
<i>working half as hard, but with
virtually none of the risk.</i>

394
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:59,977
The word got out that I have
coke, and I'm selling coke.

395
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:03,080
The dean in the school,
they pulled me in,

396
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:06,717
and they said, "Hey look, you know, we're
hearing that you're selling drugs",

397
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,053
"and we want to do
a drug test on you."

398
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,422
So, at that point, you
know, I thought to myself,

399
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:15,626
"Well, I better really slow down
on this and not do it any more."

400
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,028
NARRATOR:
<i>Mike failed his drug test,</i>

401
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:20,064
and was kicked out of school,
but never did any hard time.

402
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,601
<i>When dealing small amounts,</i>
<i>the nicer the neighbourhood,</i>

403
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:25,669
<i>the less chance</i>
<i>of getting busted.</i>

404
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:30,941
<i>It'll still take years to get that
mansion in the hills you want.</i>

405
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:33,878
<i>To be a big time player,</i>
<i>you need to get committed.</i>

406
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,013
<i>It's time to start</i>
<i>building a business.</i>

407
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,558
Instead of selling ounces,
I started selling keys.

408
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,728
NARRATOR: <i>A key is</i>
<i>a kilo of cocaine.</i>

409
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,798
<i>A single kilo can run
you about $20,000.</i>

410
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,033
I had what I believe was skills.

411
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:59,870
NARRATOR: <i>This is Skipp. He did
really well as a corner hustler.</i>

412
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:04,041
I had the skills to sit on the
wall and make about $8,000 a day.

413
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:07,211
NARRATOR: <i>Once you've stacked up enough
money, you can buy larger quantities</i>

414
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:11,048
<i>and supply dealers yourself, which is
what Skipp's gonna teach you to do.</i>

415
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:15,119
SKIPP: <i>I was 10 or 11 years old,
my family life was dysfunctional.</i>

416
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,922
My mother worked two jobs,
my father wasn't in the home,

417
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:19,790
<i>so before drugs came</i>
<i>into the community,</i>

418
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:24,195
lot of people who would hustle would
rob banks or rob jewellery stores.

419
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:26,530
<i>The aggression, the
violence wasn't for me.</i>

420
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,499
NARRATOR: <i>Skipp was
struggling to make ends meet</i>

421
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:33,204
<i>in order to protect himself from the
Crips bullying his neighbourhood.</i>

422
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:36,941
<i>But it was the relationships
I had with the Crips</i>

423
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:39,710
<i>that actually
introduced me to drugs.</i>

424
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:43,013
<i>I saw them having money, and I was
asking them what are they doing,</i>

425
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:46,083
and the more I hung out with them, I
got more into the culture of drugs.

426
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:48,152
<i>We used to go to, uh,</i>
<i>different areas</i>

427
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,721
<i>that weren't populated</i>
<i>by the L.A. culture</i>

428
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:53,090
<i>so they wanted it, but they
didn't have the connection,</i>

429
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,693
<i>so we would come out</i>
<i>and be that connection.</i>

430
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:59,129
You'd have to have, uh, a
family contact or a friend.

431
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:00,965
<i>I myself went to Las Vegas.</i>

432
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:03,767
There are more than a hundred
street gangs in Los Angeles.

433
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:06,070
Police now say they have
become heavily involved

434
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:09,573
in the drug trade, exporting their
crimes throughout the west.

435
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:12,576
Going out of town when people
knew you were from L.A.,

436
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,879
that number one,
made you a star celebrity.

437
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:18,282
And then, if you were the
guy who had the drugs,

438
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:20,818
it made you an even
bigger celebrity.

439
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,922
Made all the girls love
and want to come to you.

440
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:27,764
The difficult part became
how to get it out of town.

441
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,863
<i>I myself would always</i>
<i>buy a bucket.</i>

442
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:37,568
Put whatever I want inside of it
and go get a girl who likes me.

443
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,004
Don't tell her what's in the
car, and let her drive it.

444
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:41,839
MAN: Did the girls
ever get pulled over?

445
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:45,075
Nah, I've been fortunate that
that has never occurred.

446
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:48,712
Um, however, they did get pregnant,
and I now have children.

447
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,848
The relationships that
I wanted for a weekend

448
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,317
have lasted longer
than I expected.

449
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,886
NARRATOR: <i>A lot of smugglers
get someone else to drive.</i>

450
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,022
<i>But how do you keep</i>
<i>track of you driver?</i>

451
00:25:58,024 --> 00:26:01,025
The DEA make a living
chasing drugs across country.

452
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:07,298
<i>So they can tell you how the smartest
suppliers keep track of their cargo.</i>

453
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:14,171
<i>The source of supply had rigged
this car with a GPS locator</i>

454
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:17,641
<i>and a phone, so he could
actually dial into the phone</i>

455
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:22,179
and he could monitor if the transaction
was going correctly or not.

456
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:24,315
He would know if the vehicle
was out of position.

457
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:26,784
NARRATOR: <i>Now, you don't want
to put your drugs in the trunk.</i>

458
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:29,253
<i>You're going to want some new
options on your vehicle.</i>

459
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:33,023
<i>Designing "traps" is standard
practice for any local chop shop.</i>

460
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,328
It's kind of like
a combination safe.

461
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,830
It has to be a series of things
activated in the vehicle.

462
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:44,735
<i>Like, they may have to have the air
conditioning on, the blinker on,</i>

463
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:48,038
and a couple of other things within
the vehicle for it to activate.

464
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,807
You got money to spend,
you'll get a real good trap.

465
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:52,109
We've seen some sloppy
ones, this is good work.

466
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,778
When they're closed, you would never
know by looking at it with your eye

467
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,816
so whoever constructed this
one was a professional.

468
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:01,352
It goes the whole length
of the back seat area.

469
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:04,288
So you could fit probably
in excess of 10 kilograms

470
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,725
of, uh, narcotics, large amounts
of currency or weapons.

471
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:10,728
NARRATOR: <i>Now you're ready.
But before you hit the road,</i>

472
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,864
<i>Pepe has some tips from back in the
day when he was running cocaine.</i>

473
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,836
Get up in the morning,
you be ready.

474
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:21,805
Check your car, no lights broke.

475
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:25,242
Insure your car, everything.

476
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:27,811
Even the speed limit.

477
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,414
25? 25. No more.

478
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,416
75? 75. You know?

479
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:34,952
15, school? 15, school.

480
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:36,720
Take it easy.

481
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:37,755
(LAUGHS)

482
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:41,025
And you get there. You be there.

483
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:43,360
NARRATOR: <i>So how much does
a smuggler expect to make?</i>

484
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:48,265
If they take 10 kilos, they give
me $4,000 just to smuggle it,

485
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:52,936
or if it was more?
5,000. It all depends.

486
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,007
NARRATOR: <i>So you've driven a
few kilos across country,</i>

487
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,411
<i>you might be making</i>
<i>mid six figures a year.</i>

488
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:05,783
<i>Once you're in the game, you realize
just how many people want drugs.</i>

489
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:09,987
There's everybody from the Wall Street
types to the people on the streets,

490
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:13,424
to kids going
to concerts, the stoners.

491
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:15,259
Everybody wanted cocaine.

492
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:17,761
NARRATOR: <i>What domestic
smugglers make in a month,</i>

493
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:20,230
<i>Bobby Carlton would</i>
<i>eventually make in a day.</i>

494
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:29,473
<i>In the 70s, all the cocaine was
coming in through South Florida,</i>

495
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:35,913
<i>and uh, back then they used to
call it the South Florida shuffle.</i>

496
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:39,883
<i>Everybody and anybody was selling
drugs, running drugs, moving drugs.</i>

497
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:44,021
<i>They were coming in, and
they were going everywhere.</i>

498
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:47,825
MALE BROADCASTER: <i>The posses buy
cocaine for about $5,000 a kilo.</i>

499
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:50,394
<i>The drugs are then brought here to
Miami, where they're divided up</i>

500
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:53,197
<i>and shipped all over</i>
<i>the United States.</i>

501
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:57,935
<i>The initial $5,000 investment
is worth $125,000.</i>

502
00:28:57,937 --> 00:29:01,171
CARLTON: <i>A girl that we had known, me
and some friends, we had gone over</i>

503
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:06,977
<i>to her house for a party, and I went with
her into her garage, and I was shocked.</i>

504
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:11,148
<i>There was boxes and boxes of
cash just all over the garage,</i>

505
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,150
<i>and it was just</i>
<i>packed with money.</i>

506
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:16,420
I just looked at her and I said, "Look
I don't care what you're into",

507
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,922
<i>"or how you do it, I want in."</i>

508
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,024
And she introduced
me to somebody,

509
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:23,293
and, uh, that somebody
put me on a boat.

510
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,836
The way it works is their
drop-off point is Bimini.

511
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:35,806
<i>Bimini's literally like 70 miles
off the coast of Florida.</i>

512
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,508
<i>You can go to Bimini, load up,</i>

513
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:41,979
<i>"Go fast boats" are called
go fast boats for a reason.</i>

514
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:45,349
<i>These, like, Colombian</i>
<i>cats hedge their bets.</i>

515
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:49,153
<i>What they do is they send about
15 to 20 of them at a time.</i>

516
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:54,992
<i>The odds of getting arrested are
very slim, the money's very good.</i>

517
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:58,061
<i>You get into Fort Lauderdale</i>
<i>or you get into Miami,</i>

518
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:02,866
<i>and uh, you drop a boat off, and you
get a bunch of cash and that was it.</i>

519
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:06,503
<i>When you're 18 years old and you
come from a very poor family,</i>

520
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:10,025
<i>like stuff's just not happening
for you, that's a lot of money.</i>

521
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:20,818
NARRATOR: <i>Fifty grand a day
would satisfy most people.</i>

522
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,153
<i>But not Brian O'Dea.</i>

523
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:28,425
<i>Brian was one of the most notorious
drug smugglers in the world.</i>

524
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:34,031
<i>He and his 120 employees would
take in over $100 million a year.</i>

525
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:36,567
<i>Brian's going to show you</i>
<i>how a college dropout</i>

526
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:40,904
<i>can become the CEO of a major
import-export business.</i>

527
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:43,407
I sent two pounds of hash
to myself from England.

528
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:46,844
I got 19 months for that,
and went to prison.

529
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:51,315
When I got out of prison, I had
no money and nothing going on.

530
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:53,350
<i>So, I thought,</i>
<i>maybe I can kick start</i>

531
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:56,587
<i>my getting back into the
world with a little coke.</i>

532
00:30:56,589 --> 00:31:00,557
I had $500 in my pocket,
and an address.

533
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,460
Couldn't speak a word of Spanish,
but figured I could figure it out,

534
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:05,582
so I took off to Colombia,

535
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:10,067
and I said,
"Do you know, uh, Benny?"

536
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:12,469
Showing him my card
with Benny's name on it.

537
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:15,873
I won't say his last name right now.
I might get myself shot.

538
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:18,208
So the guy, he said,
"What do you want?"

539
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,476
I went like that,

540
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:22,045
and I said "Well, I
got $500 with me."

541
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,948
And, you know, everybody started
crying laughing, right.

542
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,084
I told him I just
got out of prison,

543
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:30,487
I got my hands on... That's
all I could get my hands on,

544
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:32,556
and I'm just trying
to get a life started.

545
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,225
So he said,
<i>"Senor, muchos huevos."</i>

546
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,160
He thought I had a lot of balls.

547
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:39,429
He said, "I'm gonna get
you 50 grams of coke."

548
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:42,399
"You can cut it in half 'cause
I'll give it to you pure."

549
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,269
"You should be able to get about
10 grand out of that back there"

550
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:46,370
"if you sell it in grams."

551
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:48,238
I don't know where
I came up with this,

552
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,908
but I got a pin, and I
heated it with a lighter,

553
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,177
and you can put a hot pin
under this cellophane here,

554
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,346
and that will pop open.

555
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:59,349
So, then you can slide the
cigarettes right out of the pack

556
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:01,184
without breaking the seal.

557
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:05,422
The 50 grams of coke
fit into this pack

558
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:08,292
like it was made
to fit into that pack.

559
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:11,295
I thought,
"Ah, this is brilliant!"

560
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:13,630
I put the cigarettes with
the coke in it in my pocket

561
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:15,265
with the pack I was smoking.

562
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:18,268
Leaving Colombia, you have
to go through immigration.

563
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,271
There's no just going
and getting on the plane.

564
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:26,109
So, I'm going through immigration, there
are two guys there, and they go...

565
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,947
"On behalf of the Unites States
Government, we're checking all people"

566
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:33,317
"who fit a profile, who seem
to be involved with drugs..."

567
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:37,654
I said, "Are you kidding me? I'm a reporter!
I'm a journalist!"

568
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:43,460
But they said, "We still have to
take your clothes off, please",

569
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,162
"and get your suitcases
off the plane."

570
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:48,298
I'm going, "No!
I'm not taking my..."

571
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,034
"Sir, there's nothing we can do about it.
You have to."

572
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:53,036
I take my pants off,
still have my jacket on.

573
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,473
I pass them my pants, cursing
and swearing, and my socks,

574
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:59,409
and I reach my hand
into my jacket pocket.

575
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:02,646
I put the cigarettes I was holding
the coke in on the bottom

576
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:05,349
and the cigarettes I was smoking
on the top, and I flipped it open,

577
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:08,318
the one I was smoking, pulled
out a cigarette and lit it.

578
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,454
Offered them a cigarette,
which they each took.

579
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:13,457
I mean, these guys are making 30
bucks a month, we can't forget.

580
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:16,159
I'm lighting their cigarettes,
and I take my jacket off

581
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,995
and hand it to them,
and my shirt,

582
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:22,532
holding the cigarettes and the
coke in my hand the entire time.

583
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:28,338
The moment they handed me back a piece of
clothing that had a pocket in it, shwamp!

584
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,608
I immediately stuffed
the coke back in the pocket.

585
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:36,179
And that's how I got
in the coke business.

586
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:39,750
NARRATOR: <i>After that, Brian
O'Dea was in business.</i>

587
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,491
He got a small amount of coke, and he dissolved
it in water, and then poured in material.

588
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:51,661
<i>What we used were ponchos, or ruanas
as they're called in Colombia.</i>

589
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:55,198
So, here we now had this piece of material
that had a couple of grams of coke in it,

590
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,435
and then I just folded up those ponchos
buddy, put them in my suitcase,

591
00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:01,671
and headed on a direct flight to L.A.
from Bogota.

592
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:07,110
You just soak it in the water, and
then evaporate the water off. Simple.

593
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:10,247
Of course, methanol is what you should
be doing it with, and not water,

594
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:12,749
'cause methanol evaporates
off at room temperature.

595
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:15,352
Water, you got to wait forever
for the shit to evaporate,

596
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:17,635
which is, you know...
It's a learning process.

597

JOE GILBRIDGE: <i>If these individuals
were putting their expertise</i>

598
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:27,197
<i>towards a legitimate goal,</i>

599
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,467
could probably be very
wealthy as entrepreneurs.

600
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:34,271
We have seized drugs
in prosthetic legs,

601
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:38,341
heroin in kidney beans,
in the back of paintings.

602
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:48,685
Individuals swallow condoms filled with heroin.
Heroin pellets, we call them.

603
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:51,555
Once that condom breaks open
or that balloon breaks open,

604
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:55,659
there's not much anyone's going to
be able to do to save your life.

NARRATOR: <i>A million dollars in a
few months is a lot of money.</i>

606
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:03,467
<i>But how would you like to
make that in a few days?</i>

607
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:06,336
<i>Everyone dreams of climbing to
the top of the game one day.</i>

608

Some people can play baseball,
basketball, or sing, or dance.

(SINGING)

610
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:18,248
With some of the icons being
millionaires from selling drugs,

611
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,517
of course, I wanted... I
didn't want to be like Mike.

612
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,519
I didn't want to be like Michael
Jordan or Magic Johnson,

613
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:23,687
I wanted to be like...

614
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:25,850
I wanted to be
like Freeway Rick!

615

<i>My name is Freeway Rick Ross.</i>

616
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:31,495
My claim to fame
is being a drug kingpin.

617
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,602
At that time, I never did
drugs, I had never smoked weed.

618
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:42,339
<i>I was going to a junior college playing
tennis when my car was broken down.</i>

619
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:44,207
I was in financial
ruins at the time.

620
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,375
I needed some money.

MAN: Narcotics is
a thing of the future.

622

If we don't get
a piece of that action,

623
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:52,816
we risk everything we have. I mean,
not now, but 10 years from now.

624
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:55,152
When they put those movies
out, that made us curious.

625
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:56,887
<i>I mean it was almost like</i>
<i>being a movie star.</i>

626
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:59,189
<i>You know, how people
wished to be movie stars.</i>

627
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:00,924
That was the way I felt
about cocaine.

628
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:02,926
(SNIFFING)

629
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:07,831
<i>We went to the movie, it might
have been 15 or 20 of us.</i>

630
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,202
And we were all curious.

631
00:36:12,204 --> 00:36:14,804
Most of the older people were
saying, you know, that, uh...

632
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:17,507
"You can't make any money in
South Central off of cocaine."

633
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:21,244
What I found out is that the PCP
dealers made so much money for PCP,

634
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:23,647
they had the money, and they
became my first customers.

635

<i>We just kept escalating</i>
<i>and escalating</i>

636
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:31,321
until my mom found out
and put me out the house.

637
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:35,225
I was ghetto-rich at that time so I had
plenty of places that I could move.

638
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:38,562
NARRATOR: <i>The trick to becoming a
kingpin in any industry is innovation.</i>

639
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:41,531
<i>Freeway Rick introduced</i>
<i>crack to the West Coast.</i>

640
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,734
When people snort cocaine, they snort
so much their nose start bleeding.

641
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:47,404
So, they needed another way
to get it into their systems.

642
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:48,838
People would come by
early in the morning,

643
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,908
you know, like, doctors and
nurses and truck drivers.

644
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,477
They want to get some,
and they want to smoke it.

645
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:58,481
They started saying stuff like, "Man,
I wish it was ready to go already."

646
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:01,785
So we got hip, and we started
cooking it up for them,

647
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:05,956
so we would have the powder
here and the Ready Rock here.

648
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:09,426
Eventually, everybody started
wanting it, uh, Ready Rocked.

649
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,663
<i>For one minute, it was
like, in South Central,</i>

650
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:17,500
<i>then it moved to Inglewood,</i>
<i>then it moved to West L.A.</i>

651
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:20,604
<i>Then it moved to Compton,</i>
<i>then it moved to Watts,</i>

652
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:22,572
it's like a virus.

653
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:25,675
Pretty much every day I could do a
million dollars' worth of drugs.

654
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:28,845
There was days that I would go to
two and three million dollars.

655
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:33,883
<i>I gave a lot of money away.</i>

656
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:36,586
I mean, that's part of,
you know, being successful,

657
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,855
so that you can help your
family and friends, you know.

658
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,724
<i>Somebody would come up to
your house when it was due,</i>

659
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:44,327
<i>car notes, light bills,</i>
<i>you know, friends in jail.</i>

660
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:46,763
<i>So much stuff... You know, just
give to kids on the street.</i>

661
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,933
I mean, it's a good feeling when you
can help somebody else, you know.

662
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:52,369
One of the best feelings
that you can have, so...

663
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:57,507
I probably used to take about $40,000 a
day around with me just to give out.

664
00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:00,543
You know, 'cause people be coming up
to me all day, anyway, to see me.

665
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:03,280
So, you know, you got to give
it to them if you see them.

want somebody to give me a helping hand.

672
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:30,040
NARRATOR: When you're this high
profile, there's enormous pressure

00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:32,542
<i>on law enforcement</i>
<i>to make a bust.</i>

674

<i>And if your operation is tight,</i>

675
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:36,546
<i>collecting evidence</i>
<i>can be nearly impossible.</i>

"I know this fellow may have

"so I'll plant some on him now."

"So, he's good for it from
before, maybe not this time,."

682
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:05,108
And then, they actually go to
court and they involve themselves

683
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,510
in what they call
"testal lying."

684
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,546
NARRATOR: <i>And that's how
they busted Freeway Rick.</i>

685
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:12,916
The cops on my case
had planted drugs on me.

686
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:14,617
I pled guilty to 10 years.

<i>The first thing you need to
understand is how drug cases work.</i>

<i>Drug cases are prosecuted
unlike any other criminal case.</i>

<i>a lawyer to explain how.</i>

692

HOWARD WOOLDRIDGE: It's impossible for
the police to have a normal procedure

693
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:45,115
<i>in a crime where</i>
<i>nobody wants to report it.</i>

694

Nobody calls 911 when they use a
drug, buy a drug, or sell a drug.

695
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:53,990
In traditional law enforcement,
a crime gets committed,

696
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:57,427
police try to find
who committed the crime.

697
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:59,729
This is the way
drug enforcement works,

698
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:07,103
you look for a suspect, and then you try
to trick them into committing the crime...

For you!

700

It's backwards.

So the government
goes around sort of saying,

"Let's find suspect,
who should be a..."

"Well, let's try
to set some fucker up."

<i>observing the DEA,</i>

705
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:23,086
<i>who've arranged to buy</i>
<i>drugs from a suspect.</i>

706
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,488
<i>He's the guy on the right
with the baseball cap.</i>

707
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:31,428
<i>He's completely surrounded by law

(INDISTINCT TALKING OVER RADIO)

709
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:42,839
Just chill, just chill. Got any weapons on you?
Anything on you?

710
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:45,542
Nothing? No guns,
no knives, no drugs?

711
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:47,644
All right. But just to protect,
do you have anything on you,

712
00:40:47,646 --> 00:40:55,185
NARRATOR: <i>The reality is that the cops don't
really care too much about this one guy.</i>

713
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:58,788
<i>Their objective is to just use
him to cuff more dealers.</i>

MAN: We'll lock up
this middle man,

715
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:03,760
hopefully, this middle man will
cooperate and get us the distributor,

716
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:05,662
and we'll just go up the ladder

717
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:06,863
and keep going up
the food chain.

718
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:08,731
It's very intimidating
and overwhelming.

719
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:11,234
I'm gonna say to you, you
know, you got a lot to lose,

720
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:12,669
you're looking at a lot of time.

721
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:13,937
I mean, even if...
Even if you're not,

722
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:15,738
you're gonna try to sell
him that he's going.

723
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,540
You know, you're going
to jail for a long time.

724
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,509
If they don't know,
they may give it up.

725
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:21,911
FRANKLIN: <i>You either go to
jail, you get a record.</i>

726
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:25,515
<i>From there, you have trouble getting
a job, can't support your family.</i>

727
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:28,685
Or in the other hand, you
become an informant for us,

728
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:31,187
and we'll let you
off the charge.

729
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:34,757
NARRATOR: <i>This exact scenario is
what gets most dealers into trouble.</i>

730
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:37,827
<i>One of your employees or
customers gets picked up by cops</i>

<i>and turned into a snitch.</i>

732
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:41,698
Yes, this was
a situation in Vegas

733
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,267
<i>where there was a guy,</i>
<i>he started using drugs</i>

<i>and Las Vegas Police</i>
<i>somehow got a hold of him.</i>

MALE NEWS REPORTER:
<i>Eighteen-year-old Clifford Townson</i>

736
00:41:51,243 --> 00:41:53,643
<i>denies he belongs to any gang,</i>

737

<i>but admits he travelled from Los
Angeles here to Las Vegas.</i>

738
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:59,249
<i>He has been arrested</i>
<i>for selling cocaine,</i>

739
00:41:59,251 --> 00:42:01,584
<i>and police suspect</i>
<i>he is a gang leader.</i>

740
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:04,053
They actually put it in
the newspaper, and on TV.

741
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:06,256
<i>We were celebrities,</i>
<i>we were the L.A. guys</i>

743
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:10,026
<i>Well, we were</i>
<i>looking at 55 years.</i>

744
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,628
NARRATOR: <i>Skipp</i>
<i>was offered a deal.</i>

745
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,096
<i>If he would plead guilty,</i>

746
00:42:13,098 --> 00:42:15,765
and save the prosecutors
the trouble of going to trial.

747
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:20,870
The offer came that it would be
five years as opposed to 55 years.

748
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,906
Um, I signed up for it.

749
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:24,741
NARRATOR: <i>And what
happened to the snitch?</i>

750
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:26,676
He didn't get any time at all.

751
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:29,879
Matter of fact, he was let go, they
might have even paid him, I'm sure.

752

Federal drug money

NARRATOR: <i>Alexandra Natapoff
is an award winning scholar</i>

755
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:43,293
<i>and nationally recognized
expert on snitching.</i>

756
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:45,828
Snitches are very good
at producing arrests.

757
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,765
They may not be very good at
solving important crimes,

758
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:52,235
or getting drugs off the street,
or making communities safer,

759
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:55,038
but they are very good
at producing arrest numbers.

760
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,841
I was standing on the
side of 18, 12 officers.

761
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:02,779
Everybody pack a big gun.
You hear me?

762
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:05,982
And they, they are police.
They can shoot you.

763
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:12,055
NARRATOR: <i>Meet Derek Migras,
a Texas crack addict</i>

764
00:43:12,057 --> 00:43:16,359
<i>who police demanded give them 20 drug
dealers in a local housing project.</i>

765
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:19,162
OFFICER: Mr. Pascal told you
if you got incarcerated,

766
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:20,930
bad things can happen
in prison, right?

767
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:24,067
No, he told me that he
would make a phone call,

768
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:28,671
and have the biggest dick
son-of-a-bitch, excuse my words, y'all,

769
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:30,707
females, but these
is his exact words.

770
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:34,677
"I have the biggest dick son-of-a-bitch
in there fuck you every day."

771
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:36,813
So what you gonna do
if you was in my shoes?

772
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:38,314
Cooperate and say
what they want you to...

773
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:41,851
NARRATOR: <i>So Derek gave the
police a list of names.</i>

774
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:44,087
<i>And 28 people were arrested.</i>

775
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:48,691
Most snitches in the arena of street and
drug crime will never have a lawyer.

776
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:50,960
They'll never talk to anyone
about their rights,

777
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:53,329
about the nature of the case that
the government has against them.

778
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:55,798
They'll negotiate with the police
officer right there on the street

779
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,634
or maybe in the back
of the police car.

780
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:59,102
All right, let me
tell you like this here.

781
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:02,705
I never bought drugs from Regina Kelly.
Straight up.

782
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:05,375
NARRATOR: <i>It turns out that all
the names were fabricated.</i>

783
00:44:05,377 --> 00:44:08,711
<i>But cases like this</i>
<i>happen all the time.</i>

784
00:44:08,713 --> 00:44:10,313
<i>There's another reason</i>
<i>Derek Migras</i>

785
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:12,782
<i>gave a list of innocent
people to the cops.</i>

786
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:14,684
<i>Because snitching</i>
<i>on a real drug dealer</i>

787
00:44:14,686 --> 00:44:16,886
<i>can have very</i>
<i>serious consequences.</i>

788
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:20,089
Rachel Hoffman was a young
woman in Tallahassee, Florida.

789
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:21,424
<i>She was a college graduate,</i>

790
00:44:21,426 --> 00:44:23,126
she had a bright future
ahead of her.

791
00:44:23,128 --> 00:44:24,727
But she was caught by the police

792
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:26,229
with a small amount of marijuana

793
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:27,997
and some non-prescription pills,

794
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,298
<i>and the police threatened her.</i>

795
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,101
They told her that she
could work it off.

796
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:33,369
She could do
an undercover drug buy.

797
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:36,873
She was supposed to buy
15,000 ecstasy tablets,

798
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:39,776
50 grams of cocaine,
and two handguns.

799
00:44:39,778 --> 00:44:43,046
She said, "Mom I don't
want you telling anybody",

800
00:44:43,048 --> 00:44:45,848
"'cause I'm getting
all my charges dropped."

801
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,151
NARRATOR: <i>Rachel called
her father just hours</i>

802
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:50,420
<i>before the sting operation</i>
<i>was to begin.</i>

803
00:44:50,422 --> 00:44:53,823
She said, "Dad, I'm really
thinking about you today."

804
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:57,427
<i>And that was my last</i>
<i>conversation with her.</i>

805
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:01,698
LAWYER: <i>The people that she was set up
to meet knew that something was fishy,</i>

806
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,199
and so they shot her.

807
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,801
And at the end of the day,

808
00:45:04,803 --> 00:45:06,736
when the police were confronted

809
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:09,138
with whether they had made
the right decision

810
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,842
to send in a 22-year-old college
girl to make this kind of drug deal,

811
00:45:12,844 --> 00:45:14,177
do you know what they said?

812
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:16,446
They said, "Well, she
didn't follow protocol."

813
00:45:16,448 --> 00:45:19,148
Now, see that's where everybody feels
we're looking to blame someone...

814
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,451
But I asked you what happened, you
said, "She deviated from the plan."

815
00:45:21,453 --> 00:45:23,453
Well, and that's where, uh...

816
00:45:23,455 --> 00:45:27,156
Whenever the plan started going,
um, south, if you want to say,

817
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:30,059
uh, where we lost
contact with Rachel

818
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:33,796
because she did not show up at the
location she was supposed to have gone to.

819
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:37,967
You don't think she was pushed
into it, coerced by your officers?

820
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:39,836
Threatened with prison?

821
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:41,804
For charges
that were never filed?

822
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,442
Again, we don't threaten people to
become confidential informants.

823
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:49,312
That's not part of how we operate.
No, sir.

824
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,815
NARRATOR: <i>The moral of the
story for most dealers is.</i>

825
00:45:52,817 --> 00:45:56,085
<i>But if you do,</i>
<i>name innocent people,</i>

<i>or demand a witness</i>
<i>protection program.</i>

827
00:45:59,858 --> 00:46:03,292
<i>Is having a few counter
surveillance guys on your payroll.</i>

828
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:09,499
<i>You run an investigation</i>
<i>on the cops following you,</i>

829
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:14,237
<i>so when cops break the law, you've got
it on tape, and can negotiate a deal.</i>

830
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:17,940
I went in and told them
they planted drugs on me,

831
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:20,209
that I didn't have drugs
that particular night.

832
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:23,079
That I was a drug dealer, but
that night, I didn't have drugs.

833
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:27,917
What these cops were doing were going
around and doing this to a lot of people.

834
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:30,920
They wind up getting indicted,
and when they got indicted,

835
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:34,524
I agreed to cooperate against the
cops for what they had did to me.

836
00:46:34,526 --> 00:46:39,262
NARRATOR: <i>And that's how the King of
Crack spent only five years in prison.</i>

(HIP HOP BEAT PLAYING)

838
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:56,012
<i>It's a great idea to get an ex-DEA
officer on your team as well.</i>

839
00:46:56,014 --> 00:46:59,315
<i>When you're moving tons of illegal
cargo, like Brian O'Dea was,</i>

840
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,950
<i>you can never be too careful.</i>

841
00:47:00,952 --> 00:47:04,387
We all agreed that we would
move this thing forward,

842
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:06,322
that everybody would
go on a salary,

843
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:09,158
and the deal was no coke.
If you did coke you were out.

844
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,828
NARRATOR: <i>The problem
was, Brian loved cocaine.</i>

845
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:14,497
<i>He loved all drugs,</i>
<i>ever since he was a kid.</i>

<i>He took me to his office,</i>
<i>and half an hour later,</i>

849
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:28,578
<i>I suffered the first sexual
abuse by an adult in my life.</i>

850
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:32,582
<i>As a Catholic, we were taught sex
was punishable by eternity in hell.</i>

851
00:47:32,584 --> 00:47:38,955
<i>So I came out of that office negotiating
with God not to strike me dead today.</i>

852
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:40,456
It was horrible, buddy.

853
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:43,326
My mind became a place
to get out of.

854
00:47:43,328 --> 00:47:45,528
And so I, you know,
when I discovered that

855
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:48,264
there were substances that
could take me out of there,

856
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:49,999
I was going for them.

857
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:56,072
<i>The moment I take cocaine, it's a
nightmare from that point until I stop.</i>

858
00:47:56,074 --> 00:48:00,076
<i>Coke has such an ownership
thing, it wants all of you.</i>

859
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:02,945
NARRATOR: <i>Brian knew this was
the biggest deal of his career.</i>

860
00:48:02,947 --> 00:48:05,448
<i>And as long as he stayed
clean, he'd be all right.</i>

861
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:07,550
The first part of
the load was 25 tons.

862
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:09,585
<i>And we met it up</i>
<i>in the Bering Sea,</i>

863
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:12,488
<i>and then took it off up</i>
<i>into a fjord in Alaska,</i>

864
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:15,892
<i>repackaged it all</i>
<i>in wetlock fish boxes,</i>

865
00:48:15,894 --> 00:48:17,426
<i>put it all on the trucks,</i>

866
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:20,396
<i>I mean, it was</i>
<i>as smooth as silk.</i>

867
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:23,966
Once it was all offloaded,
we started partying.

868
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:25,468
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

869
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:32,975
NARRATOR: <i>There was only one little
problem, and it wasn't Brian O'Dea.</i>

870
00:48:32,977 --> 00:48:37,213
<i>Brian's partner couldn't help but party
with a little cocaine one night.</i>

871
00:48:37,215 --> 00:48:39,982
<i>Then another night,</i>
<i>and then another one.</i>

872
00:48:39,984 --> 00:48:44,553
He'd show up at the house in the middle of
the night at 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning

873
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:48,257
<i>in a limousine, prostitutes,</i>
<i>cocaine, booze.</i>

874
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:51,994
Well, when he found out that the load
came in, he came looking for his money.

875
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:55,498
<i>And we were very concerned about him getting
out there with a whole pack of money</i>

876
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,433
<i>and creating a giant heat-score</i>

877
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,535
<i>with these bags</i>
<i>of coke and hookers,</i>

878
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:01,404
so there was a concern
about giving him anything,

879
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:05,174
giving him something, giving him
a million bucks, what do we do?

880
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:08,110
So the boys decided to give
him 50 grand, and I thought,

881
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:11,380
"He is not going to be
happy with 50 grand."

882
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:14,483
He took that 50 grand,
he left that meeting,

883
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:18,154
and he went right to the DEA's office
with the money and put it on the table.

884
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:22,425
And said, "I can tell you where there's
millions more just like that."

885
00:49:22,427 --> 00:49:24,427
NARRATOR: <i>A few days
later, Brian and his team</i>

886
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:27,296
<i>were expecting 50 tons</i>
<i>of marijuana to come in.</i>

887
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:31,200
<i>So Brian took the precaution</i>
<i>of hiring an ex-DEA agent</i>

888
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:35,571
<i>to run surveillance on any law
enforcement activity in the area.</i>

889
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:38,240
O'DEA: <i>The load came
in, a huge load.</i>

890
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:43,045
We got a guy out from San Diego
who has a spectrum analyzer.

891
00:49:43,047 --> 00:49:46,415
<i>He's able to isolate the
transmission frequencies of the DEA,</i>

892
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:48,484
and on the way up,
my scanner lights up,

893
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:53,556
<i>And the moment it crossed the
border between Canada and the U.S.,</i>

894
00:49:53,558 --> 00:50:00,196
<i>DEA, the FBI, alcohol tobacco
firearms, coast guard.</i>

895
00:50:00,198 --> 00:50:02,298
<i>Expecting to find reefer.</i>

896
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,469
There wasn't a joint in sight,

897
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:09,772
but there was fresh donuts
made and coffee on the brew,

898
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:12,575
<i>and they took that as insult.</i>

899
00:50:12,577 --> 00:50:16,278
You know, you can't help doing
stuff like that sometimes.

900
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:21,684
Seventy-five tons generated,
approximately 200 million U.S. dollars.

901
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:33,129
NARRATOR: <i>So where do you find an ex-DEA
agent or narc who's willing to work for you?</i>

902
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:35,051
<i>We've got someone</i>
<i>we can recommend.</i>

903
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:50,112
BARRY COOPER: <i>In high school, I wore overalls
with no shirt, my jeans tucked into my boots,</i>

904
00:50:50,114 --> 00:50:53,449
and I could yell "yee-haw"
louder than the rest of them.

905
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:58,788
Well, any of the kids that we heard of
smoking marijuana, we would beat them up.

906
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:02,124
The entire time, we'd be drinking
and fighting each other.

907
00:51:02,126 --> 00:51:06,796
<i>I decided to be cop because I
wanted to be able to fight legally.</i>

908
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:09,398
<i>I loved everything</i>
<i>about law enforcement.</i>

909
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:15,738
I learned how to manipulate
citizens into running, or fighting.

910
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:19,341
<i>I was very popular among all
the other police officers</i>

911
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:21,777
<i>because of the excitement</i>
<i>I could get them in.</i>

912
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:24,146
<i>We were trained</i>
<i>when a motorist was speeding,</i>

913
00:51:24,148 --> 00:51:28,217
to get real close and then
activate the red and blue lights.

914
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:31,787
Well, I learned to lag way back

915
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:36,092
then turn my lights on to give
that motorist the opinion that.

916
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:38,828
"I might have a chance
to outrun this guy."

917
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:43,332
<i>you're addicted to the adrenaline
and you don't realize it.</i>

918
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:48,237
<i>I was the best drug agent</i>
<i>in the area.</i>

919
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:52,842
There's not a day that we don't put
somebody in jail for narcotics,

920
00:51:52,844 --> 00:51:55,444
for finding mainly marijuana.

921
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:58,681
<i>I only had 5 miles of highway</i>
<i>in my jurisdiction</i>

922
00:51:58,683 --> 00:52:01,584
<i>and I made over</i>
<i>100 drug arrests in one year.</i>

923
00:52:01,586 --> 00:52:03,719
MAN: He's got a gun! Shoot!

924
00:52:03,721 --> 00:52:08,624
The DEA, they were jealous, because they were
supposed to be making all the big arrests.

925
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:12,161
The first month, I performed
seven drug raids.

926
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:15,764
<i>The DEA were only doing one a year.
The entire DEA.</i>

927
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:17,900
And they had jurisdiction
of every county,

928
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:20,236
I only had jurisdiction
in one city.

929
00:52:20,238 --> 00:52:23,806
I'll never forget the last
marijuana arrest I made.

930
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:27,877
And something hit me, I thought, "I
make three or four of these a day."

931
00:52:27,879 --> 00:52:31,614
Almost everybody I stop
has marijuana.

932
00:52:31,616 --> 00:52:36,552
There's marijuana roach in your
ash tray, and I smell marijuana.

933
00:52:36,554 --> 00:52:38,554
Ladies, any of y'all got
any marijuana on you?

934
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:40,756
<i>I thought there's got to be</i>
<i>something to it.</i>

935
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:43,692
<i>Well, for years,</i>
<i>I had pounds in my house</i>

936
00:52:43,694 --> 00:52:46,562
<i>as training aids</i>
<i>to train my drug dog.</i>

937
00:52:46,564 --> 00:52:50,633
So, I went home, and I smoked
that pot, and I loved it.

938
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:53,369
I'm like,
"This is what it's about."

939
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:56,438
<i>It's one of the funniest
things I'd ever done.</i>

940
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,775
<i>I married my pot dealer,</i>
<i>this girl named Candy.</i>

941
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:01,911
Candy and I were talking,
and I said,

942
00:53:01,913 --> 00:53:06,849
"Should I make a film on how
insane the drug war is"

943
00:53:06,851 --> 00:53:10,486
"or should I just teach people
how not to get busted for pot?"

944
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:12,788
All these secrets I had.

945
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:15,858
And she said, "You gotta teach
'em how not to get busted."

946
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:19,628
High Times, Cannabis Culture,
<i>everything out there.</i>

947
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:23,399
<i>We went on the Internet, and
nothing was out there like it.</i>

948
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:29,872
<i>Coming off the success of the
</i> Never Get Busted <i>video series,</i>

949
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:33,442
we begin getting
thousands of emails

950
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:37,346
of people being arrested and
mistreated by law enforcement.

951
00:53:37,348 --> 00:53:40,249
And if I got an email and it
fit exactly what I used to do,

952
00:53:40,251 --> 00:53:41,917
I knew
they were telling the truth.

953
00:53:41,919 --> 00:53:44,587
And we were getting
thousands of these.

954
00:53:44,589 --> 00:53:46,956
So Candy and I were talking
and she said,

955
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:51,293
"You know, Barry, you were so good
at busting all those citizens,"

956
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:55,531
"you should start busting
some of these crooked cops,"

957
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:57,566
and I'm like, "Yeah!"

958
00:53:57,568 --> 00:54:02,705
<i>Barry Cooper's a guy you can
call if cops plant drugs on you.</i>

959
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:05,007
<i>Even if you've never</i>
<i>dealt drugs in your life.</i>

960
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:07,309
RAYMOND MADDEN: <i>My granddad
told me a long time ago,</i>

961
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:09,245
<i>tough times</i>
<i>don't build character.</i>

962
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:10,980
Tough times show character.

963
00:54:10,982 --> 00:54:15,985
<i>"He called us and he said, " Tell
you what I think happened.</i>

964
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:18,454
"They made
a mistake in identity."

965
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:21,857
<i>Confidential informants ended up
planting drugs on the wrong person.</i>

966
00:54:21,859 --> 00:54:23,726
It struck me later on
that evening,

967
00:54:23,728 --> 00:54:26,295
it just kinda, you know,
my eyes popped open, like,

968
00:54:26,297 --> 00:54:29,365
"Wait a minute. How do you plant
drugs on the right person?"

969
00:54:29,367 --> 00:54:32,468
<i>and informant</i>
<i>was instructed by police</i>

970
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:34,536
<i>to plant a bag of meth</i>
<i>in his daughter's car.</i>

971
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:36,772
<i>But unfortunately,</i>
<i>the information was wrong,</i>

972
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:40,542
Yolanda Madden was a working, single
mother of two at the time of her arrest.

973
00:54:40,544 --> 00:54:44,013
So Raymond flew to East
Texas and met with me.

974
00:54:44,015 --> 00:54:49,985
And I told him how we could catch those
officers that planted the drugs on Yolanda.

975
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:52,821
Because some of them
were my ex-partners.

976
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:58,327
NARRATOR: <i>Barry planted two Christmas
trees under some grow lamps.</i>

977
00:54:58,329 --> 00:55:01,030
<i>Then, Odessa cops</i>
<i>received an anonymous tip</i>

978
00:55:01,032 --> 00:55:03,666
<i>that a major drug operation</i>
<i>was under way.</i>

979
00:55:03,668 --> 00:55:04,867
<i>As Barry knew they would,</i>

980
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:09,505
<i>leading up to an illegal invasion
and search of his house.</i>

981
00:55:09,507 --> 00:55:12,675
Barry proved that Odessa cops
routinely break the law,

982
00:55:12,677 --> 00:55:15,511
<i>as standard operating procedure
in fighting the drug war.</i>

983
00:55:15,513 --> 00:55:17,446
COOPER: Get these cameras ready.

984
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:19,782
Hey, I'm Barry Cooper
with <i>KopBusters!</i>

985
00:55:19,784 --> 00:55:21,583
Why are you in my house?

986
00:55:21,585 --> 00:55:26,455
I'm busy making sure these Odessa
cops quit planting drugs on people.

987
00:55:26,457 --> 00:55:28,324
POLICE OFFICER: We're not
giving nobody no hassle.

988
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:30,459
COOPER: You did too. Y'all
planted drugs on Yolanda

989
00:55:30,461 --> 00:55:32,528
and she's in prison
because of it.

990
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:35,397
That's giving people a hassle.

991
00:55:35,399 --> 00:55:38,400
You guys are wrong on this one
and you know it. You got burnt.

992
00:55:38,402 --> 00:55:41,603
He got a media event, and
that thing went national.

993
00:55:41,605 --> 00:55:46,375
In 2008, ex-drug officer Barry
Cooper set up Odessa police

994
00:55:46,377 --> 00:55:48,544
to bring attention
to Madden's case.

995
00:55:48,546 --> 00:55:50,512
It was a success.

996
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:55,084
And to prove we were right, the judge let her go.
She got out of prison.

NEWS REPORTER: <i>Painful
memories that melt away</i>

998
00:55:57,621 --> 00:56:00,789
<i>as Yolanda Madden</i>
<i>emerges a free woman.</i>

999
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:04,059
I went to prison a single
mom of two kids, 16 and 11.

1000
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:06,095
My son is 20 and married.

1001
00:56:06,097 --> 00:56:09,431
And of course my daughter is,
she's getting ready to be 16.

1002
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:11,600
And I'm talking to this
young woman, you know,

1003
00:56:11,602 --> 00:56:13,535
that was just a child
when I left.

1004
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:16,905
So, I mean, I miss the
years, you know. But...

1005
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:22,911
I've got lots of ways
to sting cops.

1006
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:24,780
It just takes money.

1007
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:30,886
<i>If you've come this far, you've learned
to beat cases and outsmart the law,</i>

1008
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:34,423
while stacking up hundreds of
millions of dollars in cash.

<i>There's one more way to make

1012
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,970

<i>This is the secret level.</i>

1014

1017

<i>All you need is a drug war.</i>

1018
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:09,458
<i>Drugs used to be legal.</i>
<i>Heroin, cocaine, everything.</i>

1019
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:13,929
<i>Until about 100 years ago, when America
appointed its first drug czar,</i>

1020
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,031
<i>a man named Harry Anslinger.</i>

1021
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:18,000
<i>In his report</i>
<i>to the U.S. Senate,</i>

1022
00:57:18,002 --> 00:57:21,537
Anslinger detailed the reasons
drugs must be outlawed.

1023
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:22,638
<i>This is what he said.</i>

1024
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,742
<i>"There are 100,000 marijuana
smokers in the U.S.,"</i>

1025
00:57:26,744 --> 00:57:31,013
<i>"and most are Negroes, Hispanics,
Filipinos, and entertainers."</i>

1026
00:57:31,015 --> 00:57:34,917
<i>"Their satanic music, jazz and
swing, result from marijuana use."</i>

1027
00:57:34,919 --> 00:57:40,122
"It causes white women to seek sexual relations
with Negroes, entertainers and others."

1028
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:45,994
<i>Anslinger's popularity</i>
<i>soared with voters,</i>

1029
00:57:45,996 --> 00:57:48,530
<i>and lawmakers</i>
<i>began outlawing drugs.</i>

1030
00:57:48,532 --> 00:57:53,101
Then the evangelical movement inspired
Congress to ban alcohol as well.

1031
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:58,040
<i>And battles for exclusive
territories erupted with a violence</i>

1032
00:57:58,042 --> 00:58:00,509
<i>unparalleled in the history</i>
<i>of law enforcement.</i>

1033
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:03,045
NARRATOR: <i>Guys like Al Capone
were suddenly making big bucks.</i>

1034
00:58:03,047 --> 00:58:06,515
<i>The black market exploded with such
violence that public opinion turned</i>

1035
00:58:06,517 --> 00:58:08,750
<i>and Roosevelt</i>
<i>ended alcohol prohibition,</i>

1036
00:58:08,752 --> 00:58:10,786
<i>crushing</i>
<i>the burgeoning industry.</i>

1037
00:58:10,788 --> 00:58:13,222
<i>But Harry Anslinger didn't
stop pushing drug prohibition.</i>

1038
00:58:13,224 --> 00:58:17,259
<i>In the 1960s, he took his case all
the way to the United Nations,</i>

1039
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:22,164
<i>and lobbied the whole world to adopt the U.S.
policy of outlawing drugs.</i>

1040
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:25,734
<i>Richard Nixon would pick up</i>
<i>where Anslinger left off.</i>

1041
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:32,040
America's public enemy number one
in the United States is drug abuse.

1042
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:36,245
NARRATOR: <i>While publicly claiming
to address addiction and violence,</i>

1043
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:38,914
<i>Nixon used drug policy</i>
<i>as a weapon</i>

1044
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:41,917
<i>to move against those he thought
of as his political enemies.</i>

1045
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:43,952
(RICHARD NIXON SPEAKING)

1046
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,672
To fight and defeat this enemy,

1047
00:59:03,674 --> 00:59:08,110
it is necessary to wage
a new, all-out offensive.

1048
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:11,914
NARRATOR: <i>President Nixon created the
Drug Enforcement Administration,</i>

1049
00:59:11,916 --> 00:59:17,619
with an annual budget of $65 million,
and started the war on drugs.

1050
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:21,290
<i>If you are a governor, mayor, police
chief, or any public official,</i>

1051
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:25,127
<i>an enormous amount of money was suddenly
available from the federal government.</i>

1052
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:27,829
<i>All you had to do</i>
<i>was enlist in the drug war.</i>

1053
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:30,599
FRANKLIN: <i>All of us in law
enforcement, we're soldiers.</i>

1054
00:59:30,601 --> 00:59:33,702
We developed the cases, we got the
informants, we did the search warrants,

1055
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:37,673
we did the wire taps, but we
didn't take the money out of it.

1056
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:42,778
All the wonderful little entrepreneurs
said, "Now it's my time."

1057
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:45,280
NARRATOR: <i>Twelve years later,</i>
<i>the federal drug war budget</i>

1058
00:59:45,282 --> 00:59:48,250
<i>had grown to over</i>
<i>$1.5 billion a year.</i>

1059
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:52,588
And the Reagan administration
stepped up the rhetoric.

1060
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:01,663
For the sake of our children,
I implore each of you,

1061
01:00:01,665 --> 01:00:06,001
to be unyielding and inflexible
in your opposition to drugs.

1062
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:07,336
Say yes to your life.

1063
01:00:07,338 --> 01:00:10,072
And when it comes to drugs,
just say no.

1064
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:11,607
"Just say no"
is sort of a fraud,

1065
01:00:11,609 --> 01:00:13,942
it's one America
talking to the other

1066
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:16,845
not even knowing how the
other half has to live.

1067
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:20,315
NARRATOR: <i>David Simon is the creator of the
critically acclaimed series </i> The Wire.

1068
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:23,619
When you're at war,
you need a fucking enemy.

1069
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:28,090
And pretty soon damn near everybody on
every corner is your fuckin' enemy.

1070
01:00:28,092 --> 01:00:29,958
NARRATOR: <i>David based the
characters in his show</i>

1071
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,927
<i>on the real world events</i>
<i>he observed</i>

1072
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:34,363
<i>during his many years as</i>
<i>a Baltimore police reporter.</i>

1073
01:00:34,365 --> 01:00:36,798
Yeah, we were saying
"Just say no"

1074
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,967
to involving yourself
in the drug trade.

1075
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:42,738
It was like telling people in a factory
town, "Don't go to work for steel."

1076
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:45,340
<i>Or telling people in Detroit,</i>
<i>"Don't go to work for GM."</i>

1077
01:00:45,342 --> 01:00:47,709
<i>"Just say no" in West Baltimore
is telling somebody,</i>

1078
01:00:47,711 --> 01:00:51,380
"Don't go work for the only factory
that is hiring in your neighbourhood."

1079
01:00:51,382 --> 01:00:54,249
<i>And the country is telling you
implicitly, "We don't need you."</i>

1080
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:56,652
<i>You're a human being</i>
<i>without purpose.</i>

1081
01:00:56,654 --> 01:01:00,255
<i>And that's 10, to 15, to 20% of
our population at this point.</i>

1082
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:02,658
You got to realize we ain't got
no jobs around here or nothin'.

1083
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:06,294
You know, so, every time we try
to make a little somethin'

1084
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:09,297
to get on our feet, to try
and help to feed our family,

1085
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:13,001
they come kicking the doors in and
knocking, knocking us back down again.

1086
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:16,438
Even as you fall into the corner
culture and ruin your life,

1087
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,341
um, you're granted meaning.

1088
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:21,443
You're granted a purpose.

1089
01:01:21,445 --> 01:01:24,146
You're gonna go out and you're
going to sell this G-pack today.

1090
01:01:24,148 --> 01:01:27,115
And you're going to bring that
money home to your people.

1091
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:29,851
So "just say no" was a problem.

1092
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:34,156
Um, in that, we had not given
the slightest bit of thought

1093
01:01:34,158 --> 01:01:38,060
as to what people in these worlds
were supposed to say yes to,

1094
01:01:38,062 --> 01:01:44,466
NARRATOR: <i>By 1986, the U.S. was
allocating $2.9 billion per year.</i>

1095
01:01:44,468 --> 01:01:49,771
<i>That's when the Democrats seized
an incredible opportunity</i>

1096
01:01:49,773 --> 01:01:52,307
<i>over the media frenzy</i>
<i>surrounding Len Bias.</i>

1097
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:54,342
COMMENTATOR 1:
<i>Len Bias with 29...</i>

1098
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:56,478
COMMENTATOR 2: <i>Oh, my!</i>

1099
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,448
Len Bias was
a college star athlete.

1100
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:02,017
He was signed to go
to the Boston Celtics.

1101
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:07,055
<i>He signs, like, a contract with
Adidas for millions of dollars.</i>

1102
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:10,225
<i>He's got it made. He flew back
that night from the signing,</i>

1103
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:14,463
celebrating in his dorm room at the University
of Maryland, he's snorting cocaine...

1104
01:02:14,465 --> 01:02:18,166
And his heart failed and they said it
was because of, uh, heavy cocaine use.

1105
01:02:18,168 --> 01:02:19,935
And he has a seizure
and he dies.

1106
01:02:19,937 --> 01:02:21,737
NARRATOR: <i>Eric Sterling</i>
<i>was working as a lawyer</i>

1107
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:23,805
<i>at the House of</i>
<i>Representatives at the time.</i>

1108
01:02:23,807 --> 01:02:28,343
ERIC STERLING: <i>The story is a
horror of how Congress operates.</i>

1109
01:02:28,345 --> 01:02:32,481
<i>The Democratic leadership figured if
they put together an anti-drug bill,</i>

1110
01:02:32,483 --> 01:02:36,451
<i>and they play it right, they can
win big in the November election.</i>

1111
01:02:36,453 --> 01:02:39,955
<i>Responding appropriately to the
public's alarm about drugs,</i>

1112
01:02:39,957 --> 01:02:41,990
<i>which, an alarm</i>
<i>they helped create.</i>

1113
01:02:41,992 --> 01:02:44,760
We're dealing with nothing
less than chemical warfare

1114
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:46,962
against the youth
of this nation.

1115
01:02:46,964 --> 01:02:49,998
STERLING: <i>Press conferences,
speeches, "The Plague."</i>

1116
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,466
<i>"Should we put in</i>
<i>the death penalty?"</i>

1117
01:02:51,468 --> 01:02:53,335
<i>"Yeah, let's have</i>
<i>the death penalty!"</i>

1118
01:02:53,337 --> 01:02:59,107
People who push drugs must be put
in jail for a minimum of 50 years.

1119
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:02,110
It had this quality of, like,
Sotheby's auction, you know.

1120
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:05,113
"I'll see ya! I'll raise ya!
I'm tougher, I'm meaner!"

1121
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:07,249
In my nine years
working for the Congress,

1122
01:03:07,251 --> 01:03:11,987
this is the only time we wrote
legislation in such haste

1123
01:03:11,989 --> 01:03:14,389
and without
careful consideration.

1124
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:17,025
NARRATOR: <i>Actress Susan Sarandon
worked with many others</i>

1125
01:03:17,027 --> 01:03:19,161
<i>to fight against</i>

1126
01:03:19,163 --> 01:03:20,929
<i>that were spreading out</i>
<i>across the country.</i>

1127
01:03:20,931 --> 01:03:23,031
I just think people
don't understand really.

01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:25,801
They just hear "tough on drugs"
and they just go, "Yeah!

1129
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:28,036
"Let's do that."
You know, "We'll be safer."

1130
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:30,839
They don't understand
what it, what it means.

1131
01:03:30,841 --> 01:03:33,175
Hamida Hassan,
a mother of three children,

1132
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:37,012
moved to her cousin's house in Nebraska
to escape an abusive boyfriend.

1133
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:39,514
HAMIDA HASSAN: <i>They were selling
drugs, and I knew that, you know,</i>

1134
01:03:39,516 --> 01:03:43,852
but I didn't concern myself with the
particulars of what they were doing.

1135
01:03:43,854 --> 01:03:45,153
<i>It seemed more safe to me.</i>

1136
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:51,226
<i>Hamida was given the mandatory
minimum of 27 years.</i>

1137
01:03:51,228 --> 01:03:53,495
HASSAN: <i>I'm 25 years old,
I'm six months pregnant,</i>

1138
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:57,232
and I'm going to be sentenced
to a natural life sentence.

1139
01:03:57,234 --> 01:03:59,901
Right now, the way the laws
stand, you can murder somebody

1140
01:03:59,903 --> 01:04:03,171
and get out quicker than be in a
house where there's a drug bust

1141
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:06,174
and you don't even know
what's going on.

1142
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:08,376
You can end up serving 30 years.

1143
01:04:08,378 --> 01:04:11,179
It's crazy.
I mean, it's not right.

1144
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:14,482
NARRATOR: <i>Since 1993, Hamida
Hassan has been in prison.</i>

1145
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:17,118
And her children have grown up
without their mother.

1146
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:20,255
HAMIDA'S DAUGHTER: <i>I just
always break out in tears,</i>

1147
01:04:20,257 --> 01:04:21,890
because I just miss my mom a lot

1148
01:04:21,892 --> 01:04:25,060
and I just hope that
she come home soon.

1149
01:04:25,062 --> 01:04:28,330
STERLING: <i>Many of the people in federal
prison, as I'm speaking right now,</i>

1150
01:04:28,332 --> 01:04:31,967
who are there on drug charges,
are there on mandatory minimums.

1151
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:33,435
Whatever charge they're serving,

1152
01:04:33,437 --> 01:04:34,936
they're serving
a longer sentence

1153
01:04:34,938 --> 01:04:39,941
that in part
reflects my failures

1154
01:04:39,943 --> 01:04:42,878
to be a better lawyer
in blocking that law.

1155
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:45,881
It pains me very much,

1156
01:04:45,883 --> 01:04:49,384
you know, when I meet the
family members of these people,

1157
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:51,386
uh, it breaks my heart.

1158
01:04:57,227 --> 01:05:00,562
NARRATOR: <i>It was a total
success for the Democrats.</i>

1159
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:03,198
Many of the congressmen
behind the mandatory minimums

1160
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,967
<i>were re-elected</i>
<i>the following term.</i>

1161
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:09,104
If you really wanna do good in
politics, be tough on drugs.

1162
01:05:09,106 --> 01:05:14,643
<i>The CIA discovered that drug money
could help U.S. foreign interests.</i>

1163
01:05:14,645 --> 01:05:19,514
POLITICIAN: <i>Now we all know that the U.S.
government and the CIA supported</i>

1164
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:23,218
the contras in Nicaragua,
in the middle '80s.

1165
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:28,690
Now it is alleged the CIA also helped
the contras raise money for arms

1166
01:05:28,692 --> 01:05:33,128
by introducing crack cocaine
into California.

1167
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:36,031
There's no question in my mind
there is complicity

1168
01:05:36,033 --> 01:05:38,333
in the flow of drugs
into this country, period.

1169
01:05:38,335 --> 01:05:42,070
NEWS REPORTER: A senate investigation
led by John Kerry of Massachusetts

1170
01:05:42,072 --> 01:05:46,041
<i>found that individuals who
provided support for the contras.</i>

1171
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:51,413
NARRATOR: <i>Freeway Rick's former
South American cocaine supplier</i>

1172
01:05:51,415 --> 01:05:54,049
<i>was a major contributor</i>
<i>to the contras.</i>

1173
01:05:54,051 --> 01:05:57,585
<i>Eventually the DEA hired him</i>
<i>to set up Freeway Rick,</i>

1174
01:05:57,587 --> 01:06:00,021
<i>putting him in jail</i>
<i>for 20 years.</i>

1175
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:03,224
<i>The DEA paid Rick's supplier</i>
<i>for services,</i>

1176
01:06:03,226 --> 01:06:05,460
<i>and American crack cocaine users</i>

1177
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:09,464
<i>helped pay for a U.S. government-supported
war in South America.</i>

1178
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:15,136
And when that first cocaine
was smuggled in on a ship,

1179
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:17,973
it may as well have been
a deadly bacteria,

1180
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:22,043
so much as it hurt the body,
the soul of our country.

1181
01:06:22,045 --> 01:06:26,481
But take my word for it,
this scourge will stop.

1182
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:29,150
NARRATOR: <i>President Bush
Senior doubled the war budget.</i>

1183
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:34,122
<i>And by the end of his administration,
it had doubled yet again.</i>

1184
01:06:34,124 --> 01:06:38,059
<i>During the '90s, government asset
forfeiture was also on the rise.</i>

1185
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:42,664
Is they permit the government to
seize assets and money of people

1186
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:46,701
<i>where they believe that those assets
are connected to drug enforcement.</i>

1187
01:06:46,703 --> 01:06:50,105
It's very easy for the government
to get assets this way

1188
01:06:50,107 --> 01:06:52,307
because the standard of proof
is so much lower.

1189
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:54,676
No one needs to be charged
or convicted of a crime.

1190
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:57,345
NARRATOR: The message to law
enforcement officers was simple.

1191
01:06:57,347 --> 01:07:00,015
In the event that you are
an undercover officer

1192
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:02,751
and you see someone
carrying two suitcases,

1193
01:07:02,753 --> 01:07:05,453
one is full of money,
the other is full of drugs,

1194
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:06,755
follow the money.

1195
01:07:06,757 --> 01:07:10,492
Drugs coming up from Mexico
go north and east.

1196
01:07:10,494 --> 01:07:12,594
<i>To seize the large amounts</i>
<i>of money,</i>

1197
01:07:12,596 --> 01:07:17,632
<i>I was instructed to begin working
south and west bound traffic.</i>

1198
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:23,772
<i>I got extremely talented at seizing
money under the rules of law.</i>

1199
01:07:23,774 --> 01:07:25,607
That's highway robbery.

1200
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:29,144
I have heard
a police officer say.

1201
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:30,745
"Chief, we need a new vehicle."

1202
01:07:30,747 --> 01:07:34,049
He'd say "All right, go out, find
a drug dealer and seize one."

1203
01:07:34,051 --> 01:07:37,385
And so they literally
try to find this property.

1204
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:40,722
If I found 100,000
dollars drug money,

1205
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:45,060
that paid my salary for a year,
auto expenses, dog expenses,

1206
01:07:45,062 --> 01:07:47,695
whatever it took
to keep me on board,

1207
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:49,597
everything after that
was profit.

1208
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:53,101
The same problem comes up with
regard to police corruption.

1209
01:07:53,103 --> 01:07:57,572
You go out in the field and
you will see a stack of cash.

1210
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:01,276
So you just lift maybe 10, 20,
30, 40 dollars off the top

1211
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:02,510
and nobody notices,

1212
01:08:02,512 --> 01:08:04,446
and of course
there's no accounting anyway,

1213
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:06,481
so next time you will lift
maybe a hundred.

1214
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:08,416
If I found a stash of money,

1215
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:10,718
I'd take a couple hundred bucks,

1216
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,288
stick it in my pocket
and then turn it in.

1217
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,590
I'm not proud of that.

1218
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,759
NARRATOR: <i>Between 2000 and 2003,</i>

1219
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:21,129
<i>the Department of Justice
earned over one billion dollars</i>

1220
01:08:21,131 --> 01:08:22,430
<i>in forfeiture proceeds.</i>

1221
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:25,200
<i>By 2008,</i>
<i>that number had tripled.</i>

1222
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:27,769
<i>By the time Clinton left office,</i>

1223
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:32,607
<i>High school students' use of
methamphetamines had doubled.</i>

1224
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,810
<i>And heroin and cocaine were
cheaper and purer than they were</i>

1225
01:08:35,812 --> 01:08:38,880
<i>when the first drug laws</i>
<i>were passed in 1914.</i>

1226
01:08:38,882 --> 01:08:42,851
The war on drugs is not winnable,
but it's eminently fundable,

1227
01:08:42,853 --> 01:08:45,587
and the government
is addicted to that funding.

1228
01:08:45,589 --> 01:08:47,722
OFFICER: You know, the worst
thing about this drug war,

1229
01:08:47,724 --> 01:08:51,292
it just ruined this job.

1230
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:52,861
You know I began
as a police reporter,

1231
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:55,630
somebody very sympathetic
to good police work,

1232
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:57,465
and I still am sympathetic
to good police work.

1233
01:08:57,467 --> 01:09:00,602
But I have no regard
for the drug war any more.

1234
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:02,704
If you're a fan of
the HBO series <i>The Wire,</i>

1235
01:09:02,706 --> 01:09:04,606
you see this emphasized
over and over again,

1236
01:09:04,608 --> 01:09:07,208
that it's all about
statistics and numbers.

1237
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:09,677
NARRATOR: <i>Radley Balko is a
journalist who spent years</i>

1238
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:13,681
<i>studying the effects that federal drug
money has had on law enforcement.</i>

1239
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:15,750
You need to make as many
drug arrests as possible,

1240
01:09:15,752 --> 01:09:19,354
and that's how you get your grant
in the federal government.

1241
01:09:19,356 --> 01:09:21,156
NARRATOR: <i>If you're running
a police department,</i>

1242
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:22,790
<i>you don't get</i>
<i>massive grant money</i>

1243
01:09:22,792 --> 01:09:26,394
<i>for solving murder cases,</i>
<i>or rapes, or theft.</i>

1244
01:09:26,396 --> 01:09:30,165
<i>Your only major financial incentive
is to solve drug crimes,</i>

1245
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:32,901
<i>and if you don't make the same
drug arrests as last year,</i>

1246
01:09:32,903 --> 01:09:35,370
<i>you won't get</i>
<i>the same budgets this year.</i>

1247
01:09:35,372 --> 01:09:38,373
And yet, all you're doing is
making meaningless street arrests

1248
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:40,642
that have no consequence.

1249
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:46,781
NARRATOR: <i>This incentivizes police
departments to set up specialized SWAT teams</i>

1250
01:09:46,783 --> 01:09:49,484
<i>so police can conduct</i>
<i>more drug raids.</i>

1251
01:09:49,486 --> 01:09:52,754
<i>And the U.S. government will provide
money for SWAT equipment as well.</i>

1252
01:09:52,756 --> 01:09:56,858
No-knock raids are some of the
most cruel, horrible tragedies

1253
01:09:56,860 --> 01:10:00,395
<i>a human can go through</i>
<i>because it's so terrifying.</i>

1254
01:10:00,397 --> 01:10:04,632
I raided over 100 houses
in my law enforcement career.

1255
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:07,969
<i>There'd be 15 of us</i>
<i>in all this riot gear,</i>

1256
01:10:07,971 --> 01:10:11,206
<i>and the biggest, fanciest</i>
<i>guns we could get.</i>

1257
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,274
I was always the guy
who kicked the door in,

1258
01:10:13,276 --> 01:10:14,943
'cause I was
the most aggressive one.

1259
01:10:14,945 --> 01:10:20,949
And we threw flash grenades in
the window to confuse everybody.

1260
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:27,622
<i>The one that really</i>
<i>stands out in my mind was,</i>

1261
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:32,594
I remember a blonde-headed
girl with blue eyes,

1262
01:10:32,596 --> 01:10:34,762
like my daughter's,

1263
01:10:34,764 --> 01:10:40,335
and it almost seems like it
was one of my daughters now.

1264
01:10:40,337 --> 01:10:44,405
<i>And uh, she had a brother,</i>
<i>and they were so scared.</i>

1265
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:47,342
POLICE OFFICER: Don't
move, you understand?

1266
01:10:47,344 --> 01:10:49,677
MAN: Did you shoot my dog?

1267
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,846
MAN: Did you shoot
my fucking dog?

1268
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:53,915
(FAMILY YELLING INDISTINCTLY)

1269
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:03,424
MAN: Why did you do that?

1270
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:06,661
And we ripped that family
apart for a bag of pot?

1271
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:11,266
Sometimes people feed
them wrong information,

1272
01:11:11,268 --> 01:11:12,867
sometimes it's just an accident,

1273
01:11:12,869 --> 01:11:16,971
where they read, instead
of "863" they read "868".

1274
01:11:16,973 --> 01:11:21,676
And when they got to the house of
the former marine, Jose Guerena,

1275
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:24,812
he had already been alerted by his
wife that someone was outside,

1276
01:11:24,814 --> 01:11:26,447
so he grabbed his rifle.

1277
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:28,850
But before Guerena could remove
the safety from his rifle,

1278
01:11:28,852 --> 01:11:32,453
he was greeted by more than 60
bullets from law enforcement.

1279
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:35,623
The SWAT team refused to let
anyone attend to Guerena,

1280
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,492
leaving no hope
for him to survive.

1281
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:39,961
We've raised a generation
of cops in Baltimore

1282
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:42,363
who can make a drug arrest,
but can't do police work.

1283
01:11:42,365 --> 01:11:43,931
You don't know
how to use an informant

1284
01:11:43,933 --> 01:11:45,700
and not be used by an informant.

1285
01:11:45,702 --> 01:11:48,503
You don't know how to write
an intelligent search warrant,

1286
01:11:48,505 --> 01:11:51,673
you don't know how to retroactively
investigate a crime,

1287
01:11:51,675 --> 01:11:54,008
you don't understand
how to maintain a crime scene.

1288
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:56,878
All the things that count
as quality police work,

1289
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,515
that's a direct consequence of the
drug war that nobody thought about.

1290
01:12:00,517 --> 01:12:04,585
NARRATOR: <i>In the 1980s, there were
about 3,000 SWAT raids a year.</i>

1291
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:08,856
<i>Today, that number is estimated at
around 50,000 SWAT raids a year.</i>

1292
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:13,561
<i>Most serving warrants on</i>
<i>non-violent drug offenders.</i>

1293
01:12:13,563 --> 01:12:16,364
These raids gone wrong
are actually pretty common.

1294
01:12:16,366 --> 01:12:18,933
<i>They happen, by my estimate, a few
times a week, across the country.</i>

1295
01:12:18,935 --> 01:12:24,839
<i>When narcotics officers knocked down
the door at her home on Neal Street,</i>

1296
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:26,774
<i>and then opened fire.</i>

1297
01:12:26,776 --> 01:12:33,481
<i>A 68-year-old grandfather of 12 was killed
in his home in Framingham, Massachusetts.</i>

1298
01:12:33,483 --> 01:12:35,416
NARRATOR: <i>While drug
war money has financed</i>

1299
01:12:35,418 --> 01:12:39,554
<i>an unprecedented expansion</i>
<i>of U.S. law enforcement,</i>

1300
01:12:39,556 --> 01:12:43,758
<i>the bulk of drug money has continued
to flow outside U.S. borders</i>

1301
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,461
<i>and into the pockets</i>
<i>of true masters of the game.</i>

1302
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:13,921
As a cartel drug lord, your biggest problem
is going to be counting your money.

1303
01:13:13,923 --> 01:13:16,991
<i>But you'll have a few guys</i>
<i>hired to do that.</i>

1304
01:13:16,993 --> 01:13:21,028
<i>And a few more guys to count your mansions,
houses, planes, boats, luxury cars,</i>

1305
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:24,399
<i>and all the material possessions
you could possibly dream of.</i>

1306
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:27,502
<i>Like all the kings</i>
<i>and emperors before you,</i>

1307
01:13:27,504 --> 01:13:30,438
<i>you too will have</i>
<i>your very own army.</i>

1308
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:34,509
<i>Driving around in custom made tanks designed
by top military equipment engineers.</i>

1309
01:13:35,812 --> 01:13:40,982
<i>And too many of your men</i>
<i>find themselves in prison,</i>

1310
01:13:40,984 --> 01:13:45,553
you just send a couple hundred of your best
guys down there and get them out of jail.

1311
01:13:45,555 --> 01:13:48,089
<i>The guards won't stop you.</i>

1312
01:13:48,091 --> 01:13:51,859
<i>Anyone you perceive as being a
threat, you send a message.</i>

1313
01:13:51,861 --> 01:13:53,661
<i>You chop off people's heads.</i>

1314
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:56,964
<i>You roll those heads</i>
<i>into nightclubs</i>

1315
01:13:56,966 --> 01:14:02,036
or pile them up and hang their bodies from
bridges to keep your competition in line.

1316
01:14:02,038 --> 01:14:06,674
<i>As a cartel drug lord, you kill
anybody who gets in your way,</i>

1317
01:14:06,676 --> 01:14:08,743
<i>literally gunning</i>
<i>down civilians,</i>

1318
01:14:08,745 --> 01:14:10,978
<i>as long as you hit your target.</i>

1319
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:14,715
<i>You'll be so used to killing,
nothing will faze you any more.</i>

1320
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:22,223
<i>Since 2006, over 50,000 people have
been murdered in Mexico's war on drugs.</i>

1321
01:14:22,225 --> 01:14:25,026
<i>Most of those cases</i>
<i>remain unsolved.</i>

1322
01:14:25,028 --> 01:14:28,496
<i>Not because you're careful
about covering up your crimes,</i>

1323
01:14:28,498 --> 01:14:30,565
<i>but because you terrify</i>
<i>the police.</i>

1324
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:35,203
What happens when you as a public
official, or a police chief,

1325
01:14:35,205 --> 01:14:38,973
receive an envelope with
photographs of your family?

1326
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,843
It won't take you long
either to resign,

1327
01:14:41,845 --> 01:14:44,212
or to go along
with their wishes.

1328
01:14:44,214 --> 01:14:48,549
The cartels have more money and
more guns than the police do.

1329
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:50,518
In a lot of ways, that
doesn't make any difference

1330
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,019
because the police
are on their payrolls,

1331
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:55,301
but where they're not, they can
literally outgun the police.

1332
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:58,793
NARRATOR:
<i>To run a global company,</i>

1333
01:14:58,795 --> 01:15:00,995
<i>you need operatives</i>
<i>all over the world.</i>

1334
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:04,832
<i>An international work force
rivaling any other Fortune 500.</i>

1335
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:07,268
<i>So where do you find</i>
<i>your employees?</i>

1336
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:10,071
<i>Like business school does</i>
<i>for our corporate leaders,</i>

1337
01:15:10,073 --> 01:15:12,173
<i>jails are like</i>
<i>the ultimate job fair</i>

1338
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:15,776
for gangs, dealers, hitmen,
and other criminals for hire.

1339
01:15:15,778 --> 01:15:18,646
HARRIEL: <i>We was in there beating
people up, robbing people.</i>

1340
01:15:18,648 --> 01:15:21,249
I almost killed a guy. I beat him
so bad that I almost killed him.

1341
01:15:21,251 --> 01:15:23,518
SKIPP: <i>You know, tensions</i>
<i>are high at all times.</i>

1342
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,986
If it's not between
the Bloods and Crips,

1343
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:27,121
it might be between
the blacks and Latinos,

1344
01:15:27,123 --> 01:15:29,957
or might be between
the prison guards and inmates.

1345
01:15:29,959 --> 01:15:33,094
80% of the guys in there don't
have a high school diploma,

1346
01:15:33,096 --> 01:15:37,098
<i>So if you have no one</i>
<i>to show you what manhood is,</i>

1347
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,133
you'll be just like
the sharks just out there.

1348
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:45,907
From 1920 to 1970 the rate of incarceration
in the United States was level.

1349
01:15:45,909 --> 01:15:50,011
<i>From the depression, World
War II, the postwar boom,</i>

1350
01:15:50,013 --> 01:15:52,680
<i>through the '50s,</i>
<i>through the '60s,</i>

1351
01:15:52,682 --> 01:15:54,282
<i>the rate of incarceration</i>
<i>was level.</i>

1352
01:15:54,284 --> 01:15:57,318
<i>Public enemy number one</i>
<i>is drug abuse.</i>

1353
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:01,222
STERLING: <i>In 1970, the rate of
incarceration starts going up.</i>

1354
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:04,725
<i>And it has not stopped</i>
<i>going up for a half century.</i>

1355
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:09,063
NARRATOR: <i>Only 5% of
the world is American.</i>

1356
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:12,900
<i>But today, America has 25%
of the world's prisoners.</i>

1357
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:16,137
GRAY: <i>The United States of
America, the land of the free,</i>

1358
01:16:16,139 --> 01:16:19,073
leads the world in the
incarceration of our people.

1359
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:24,645
And incarcerate them at levels
unheard of in the rest of the world.

1360
01:16:24,647 --> 01:16:29,050
NARRATOR: No other nation comes close.
Not China, not Russia, nobody.

1361
01:16:29,052 --> 01:16:30,651
There are only two explanations,

1362
01:16:30,653 --> 01:16:33,788
one is that
we are uniquely evil,

1363
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:38,059
and the other is that we have
uniquely counterproductive laws.

1364
01:16:38,061 --> 01:16:41,028
NARRATOR: <i>And while the prison
population continues to grow,</i>

1365
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:43,731
<i>the demand for illegal drugs</i>
<i>is still rising.</i>

1366
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:53,975
<i>50% of America has consumed</i>
<i>an illegal drug.</i>

1367
01:16:53,977 --> 01:16:56,243
<i>Do they think they can lock</i>
<i>up half of the country?</i>

1368
01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:58,713
<i>There's just no stopping us.</i>

1369
01:16:58,715 --> 01:17:00,881
Everybody I know wants to
do drugs is doing them.

1370
01:17:00,883 --> 01:17:03,150
They don't care if it's legal
or illegal, they're doing them.

1371
01:17:03,152 --> 01:17:08,089
<i>Some of America's most famous
business leaders, like Steve Jobs,</i>

1372
01:17:08,091 --> 01:17:12,693
has said taking LSD was one of the most
important experiences of his life.

1373
01:17:12,695 --> 01:17:18,699
I don't think it's as much a question
about drugs as it's about freedom.

1374
01:17:18,701 --> 01:17:20,768
Whatever this
freedom word means,

1375
01:17:20,770 --> 01:17:23,051
we really gotta
grab hold of that.

1376
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:26,874
<i>Either we have the right
to do what we want to do</i>

1377
01:17:26,876 --> 01:17:29,844
<i>as long as we aren't</i>
<i>hurting someone else,</i>

1378
01:17:29,846 --> 01:17:32,680
<i>or we're not living</i>
<i>in a free country.</i>

1379
01:17:32,682 --> 01:17:36,117
I'm just horrified by the way
that we think of people

1380
01:17:36,119 --> 01:17:38,719
because of the choice of substance
that they put in their bodies

1381
01:17:38,721 --> 01:17:40,254
to alter their perception.

1382
01:17:40,256 --> 01:17:42,857
And we judge them
as good or bad,

1383
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:46,827
while we sip our wine
and have our cocktail parties

1384
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,396
and you know...

1385
01:17:48,398 --> 01:17:51,732
Stick that hypocrisy right up
society's ass for me.

1386
01:17:51,734 --> 01:17:55,936
Some of them can kill you the first time you
try them and other ones are really fun.

1387
01:17:55,938 --> 01:17:57,938
And someone's lying to you
if they say they're not.

1388
01:17:57,940 --> 01:18:02,109
Our own power as individuals over
our own bodies, our thoughts,

1389
01:18:02,111 --> 01:18:05,379
our minds, our ideas,
and our feelings,

1390
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:08,149
those are not things that
can be taken away from us.

1391
01:18:08,151 --> 01:18:12,019
And anybody who would allow
the state to take them away

1392
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:14,822
doesn't deserve the title
"American citizen."

1393
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:18,459
NARRATOR: <i>The vast majority</i>
<i>of drug dealers never make it.</i>

1394
01:18:18,461 --> 01:18:20,995
<i>They're either killed,</i>
<i>or wind up in prison.</i>

1395
01:18:20,997 --> 01:18:23,230
<i>But Americans just keep</i>
<i>demanding more drugs.</i>

1396
01:18:23,232 --> 01:18:28,169
MAN: <i>Approximately half a million Americans
are incarcerated on drug charges.</i>

1397
01:18:28,171 --> 01:18:31,005
In recent years we've spent more
money building new prisons.

1398
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:36,444
<i>And they are beneficiaries, the
people who manage these prisons,</i>

1399
01:18:36,446 --> 01:18:39,013
<i>the prison guards' unions,</i>

1400
01:18:39,015 --> 01:18:42,249
they all have a vested interest in
perpetuating this broken system.

1401
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:45,486
NARRATOR: <i>And famous American freedom
advocates have been speaking for years</i>

1402
01:18:45,488 --> 01:18:47,808
<i>about the conflict of</i>
<i>interest for politicians.</i>

1403
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:52,493
Are you running for office,
and you need more dough?

1404
01:18:52,495 --> 01:18:55,062
Adopt a tough on crime position,

1405
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:58,399
you'll get a lot of money from the
prison industry. Think about it.

1406
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:07,174
NARRATOR: <i>But even the largest prison
system in the history of the world</i>

1407
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:09,944
<i>is just another market</i>
<i>for drug dealers.</i>

1408
01:19:09,946 --> 01:19:12,146
There are drugs inside jail.

1409
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:19,487
Oh, you can find weed, coke, crystal meth, ecstasy.
Even heroin, you can find.

1410
01:19:19,489 --> 01:19:23,257
People work there, bring
it over, or visitors.

1411
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:26,260
There's drugs inside jail.

1412
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:30,364
NARRATOR: <i>Congratulations.</i>

1413
01:19:30,366 --> 01:19:35,369
<i>You're the number one organized
crime threat in the United States,</i>

1414
01:19:35,371 --> 01:19:39,206
<i>having set up franchises in</i>
<i>over 1,000 American cities.</i>

1415
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:42,176
<i>You have an operating budget</i>
<i>larger than most countries.</i>

1416
01:19:42,178 --> 01:19:47,548
<i>You and your partners in crime make
over 150 billion dollars a year.</i>

1417
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:50,818
<i>And business shows</i>
<i>no signs of slowing down.</i>

1418
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:55,556
<i>Because like any good game, the machine
creates an endless supply of players.</i>

1419
01:19:55,558 --> 01:19:58,993
The government always says drugs are
illegal, because they're bad for you,

1420
01:19:58,995 --> 01:20:00,796
and we're trying
to protect societies,

1421
01:20:00,797 --> 01:20:03,397
but the government doesn't
give a fuck about your safety.

1422
01:20:03,399 --> 01:20:06,534
The government, they don't
want you to use your drugs,

1423
01:20:06,536 --> 01:20:09,103
they want you
to use their drugs.

1424
01:20:09,105 --> 01:20:13,107
So every night on TV, you see
a weird ass drug commercial

1425
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:16,477
trying to get you hooked
on some legal shit.

1426
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:21,549
And they just keep naming symptoms till
they get one that you fucking got.

1427
01:20:21,551 --> 01:20:23,417
I think once
I took my first Vicodin

1428
01:20:23,419 --> 01:20:27,254
it was just like this feeling
of, "Aah," you know,

1429
01:20:27,256 --> 01:20:31,458
like everything was not only
mellow but didn't feel any pain,

1430
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:33,928
it didn't... It just
kind of numbed things.

1431
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:38,032
I don't know at what point exactly
it started to be a problem,

1432
01:20:38,034 --> 01:20:41,302
I just remember liking it
more and more.

1433
01:20:41,304 --> 01:20:43,604
People tried to tell me
that I had a problem,

1434
01:20:43,606 --> 01:20:45,372
I would say, "Get that
fucking person out of here",

1435
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:47,141
"I can't believe
they said that shit to me."

1436
01:20:47,143 --> 01:20:48,442
"They know nothing
about my fucking life."

1437
01:20:48,444 --> 01:20:50,177
"Are they out of
their fucking mind?"

1438
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:54,882
"I'm not out there fucking, you
know, putting coke up my nose,."

1439
01:20:54,884 --> 01:20:56,183
"I'm not smoking crack."

1440
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:58,853
You're struggling
with the argument of,

1441
01:20:58,855 --> 01:21:00,855
do you have a problem
or do you not have a problem,

1442
01:21:00,857 --> 01:21:02,489
can you control it
or can you not,

1443
01:21:02,491 --> 01:21:05,025
and I literally thought
I could control it.

1444
01:21:05,027 --> 01:21:06,927
NARRATOR:
And for one out of ten people,

1445
01:21:06,929 --> 01:21:10,064
this is how easy it is to fall
into the hands of addiction.

1446
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:14,869
I snorted OxyContin and I remember
just falling down on that couch

1447
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:18,339
and just feeling euphoric,
and feeling that,

1448
01:21:18,341 --> 01:21:21,942
"This is how I should feel, this
is how it should always be."

1449
01:21:21,944 --> 01:21:24,245
I had fun for a lot
of those years.

1450
01:21:24,247 --> 01:21:29,483
But for five or six of them, every time
I did it, it was a freaking nightmare.

1451
01:21:29,485 --> 01:21:31,151
NARRATOR: <i>Once you're addicted,</i>

1452
01:21:31,153 --> 01:21:32,887
<i>the drugs become</i>
<i>interchangeable.</i>

1453
01:21:32,889 --> 01:21:35,623
You're taking things
that people are giving you

1454
01:21:35,625 --> 01:21:37,591
that you don't even know
what the fuck they are.

1455
01:21:37,593 --> 01:21:42,630
They look like a pill and they're
shaped like something that you take,

1456
01:21:42,632 --> 01:21:44,331
so you take it.

1457
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:48,202
You know. Xanax, Valium,
tomato, tomahto.

1458
01:21:48,204 --> 01:21:50,104
You know what I mean,
it's the same thing.

1459
01:21:50,106 --> 01:21:52,273
All in the same family,
fuck it, take it.

1460
01:21:52,275 --> 01:21:55,042
You know, OxyContin is very
expensive, and I couldn't afford it,

1461
01:21:55,044 --> 01:21:58,412
so eventually a friend said,
"Well, you can do heroin."

1462
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:02,983
"Heroin's a lot cheaper and you can...
It's easier to get, actually."

1463
01:22:02,985 --> 01:22:05,419
And the cost was huge.

1464
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:07,988
Beyond the price,
beyond the dollar.

1465
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:12,426
I was doing too much cocaine,
becoming too paranoid.

1466
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:15,129
People started smoking it,
I started smoking it.

1467
01:22:15,131 --> 01:22:22,102
I was sweating, I was shitting,
I was vomiting everywhere,

1468
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:26,040
and, you know, I said,
"I need to go to a hospital."

1469
01:22:26,042 --> 01:22:29,310
Had I have gotten to the
hospital about two hours later,

1470
01:22:29,312 --> 01:22:30,544
I would have died.

1471
01:22:30,546 --> 01:22:33,213
Having my mom
look over me crying,

1472
01:22:33,215 --> 01:22:36,016
over her little baby boy,
in a hospital,

1473
01:22:36,018 --> 01:22:39,153
at 2:00 in the morning,
I just felt like shit.

1474
01:22:39,155 --> 01:22:42,056
My organs were shutting down,
my liver, kidneys, everything.

1475
01:22:42,058 --> 01:22:43,657
They were going to have
to put me on dialysis.

1476
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:45,326
They didn't think
I was gonna make it.

1477
01:22:45,328 --> 01:22:47,161
My bottom was going to be death.

1478
01:22:47,163 --> 01:22:49,430
<i>Within a month, I had relapsed,</i>

1479
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:53,400
and shot right back up to the same
amount of pills I was taking.

1480
01:22:53,402 --> 01:22:56,003
I remember just walking
around my house

1481
01:22:56,005 --> 01:22:59,540
and thinking every single day
like, I'm gonna fucking die.

1482
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:03,143
I'm looking at my kids and I
need to be here for this.

1483
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:05,179
It was everything that I loved.

1484
01:23:05,181 --> 01:23:06,580
And everything that loved me

1485
01:23:06,582 --> 01:23:10,317
was a price that I was
willing to pay to do coke.

1486
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:11,986
That's a horrible price.

1487
01:23:11,988 --> 01:23:15,489
<i>If they can't afford</i>
<i>to support their habit,</i>

1488
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:19,426
I think when you come from a
poor family, you wanna do drugs,

1489
01:23:19,428 --> 01:23:23,030
and drugs cost money,
and then you see a way out.

1490
01:23:23,032 --> 01:23:25,733
OxyContin is very expensive.
And people keep calling you,

1491
01:23:25,735 --> 01:23:27,534
you know, people want drugs.

1492
01:23:27,536 --> 01:23:29,203
And it was hard
not to give them it,

1493
01:23:29,205 --> 01:23:32,373
because I knew I could make
50 dollars just like that.

1494
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:35,642
The day I ate LSD,
the next day I sold LSD.

1495
01:23:35,644 --> 01:23:38,379
The day I did cocaine,
the next day I sold cocaine.

1496
01:23:38,381 --> 01:23:40,314
The day I shot drugs,
I was selling dope.

1497
01:23:40,316 --> 01:23:43,183
I never meant to get
in the dope business.

1498
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:45,519
That wasn't my plan.

1499
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:47,688
But it just started that way.

1500
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:51,392
Eventually I would make my way
to a Narcotics Anonymous meeting

1501
01:23:51,394 --> 01:23:54,795
and a kid was reading "What is an
addict" and it said very simply,

1502
01:23:54,797 --> 01:23:58,665
"An addict is a man or a woman
whose life is controlled by drugs,"

1503
01:23:58,667 --> 01:24:01,635
"in one form or another,
the getting and using,"

1504
01:24:01,637 --> 01:24:04,104
"and finding ways
and means to get more."

1505
01:24:04,106 --> 01:24:06,607
And I heard that, and a
light went on in my head.

1506
01:24:06,609 --> 01:24:10,044
I knew I was an addict
for the first time in my life.

1507
01:24:10,046 --> 01:24:12,346
When people asked me,
"What's wrong with you?"

1508
01:24:12,348 --> 01:24:19,386
Coming off of everything, I literally was
up 24 hours a day for 3 weeks straight.

1509
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:25,392
And I mean, not sleeping, not even
nodding off for a fucking minute.

1510
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:29,530
Like I was literally just up,
looking at the TV.

1511
01:24:29,532 --> 01:24:31,432
I had to regain motor skills,

1512
01:24:31,434 --> 01:24:33,534
I had to regain talking skills.

1513
01:24:33,536 --> 01:24:37,704
It's been a learning process,
like, it's been... I'm growing.

1514
01:24:37,706 --> 01:24:41,108
I just couldn't believe that
anybody could be naturally happy

1515
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:45,312
or naturally function or be enjoying life
in general without being on something.

1516
01:24:46,848 --> 01:24:51,652
So I would say to anybody it
does get better, you know.

1517
01:24:51,654 --> 01:24:53,554
It just, it does.

1518
01:24:55,191 --> 01:25:01,528
NARRATOR: <i>Marshall Mathers, Mike
Walzman, Brian O'Dea, and Bobby Carlton</i>

1519
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:05,165
would take years in and out of treatment
programs before they finally got sober.

1520
01:25:05,167 --> 01:25:08,669
<i>And this is normal. Addiction
is still a modern mystery.</i>

1521
01:25:08,671 --> 01:25:12,206
<i>Rehabilitation programs are
underfunded, and often unavailable,</i>

1522
01:25:12,208 --> 01:25:14,308
<i>except for the very rich.</i>

1523
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:17,711
<i>But in promoting a culture of
addiction and substance abuse,</i>

1524
01:25:17,713 --> 01:25:22,349
drug cartels have an even more powerful
ally than the pharmaceutical industry.

1525
01:25:22,351 --> 01:25:24,618
<i>The number one</i>
<i>gateway drug in the world.</i>

1526
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:34,528
Yeah, it's the worst
drug on the planet.

1527
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:38,298
95% of the violent offenses ever
committed by anyone locked up in prison.

1528
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:43,871
NARRATOR: <i>And as any addict will tell
you, the quickest way to relapse</i>

1529
01:25:43,873 --> 01:25:47,241
<i>is compromising your judgment
and willpower with alcohol.</i>

1530
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:53,413
<i>With legal drug companies</i>
<i>promoting drug use,</i>

1531
01:25:53,415 --> 01:25:56,683
<i>it would seem almost impossible to
fight the monster of addiction.</i>

1532
01:25:56,685 --> 01:25:59,920
<i>But there's one industry that's
mastered the art of drug dealing,</i>

1533
01:25:59,922 --> 01:26:04,625
and they know the secret approach that could
threaten the entire addiction market.

1534
01:26:04,627 --> 01:26:09,296
I'm Patrick Reynolds. My grandfather founded the R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Company.

1535
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:13,934
<i>My only memories of my dad were
of a man dying from smoking.</i>

1536
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:20,641
<i>Tobacco is killing more than a
combined total of all the murders,</i>

1537
01:26:20,643 --> 01:26:22,543
<i>all the drugs, all the suicides,</i>

1538
01:26:22,545 --> 01:26:24,444
and all car accidents combined.

1539
01:26:25,446 --> 01:26:29,249
Throw AIDS in, tobacco is
killing more than the total.

1540
01:26:29,251 --> 01:26:31,218
If tobacco were banned tomorrow,

1541
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:35,522
and the DEA was going to
come after you for smoking,

1542
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:38,659
the first thing it would do is it
would make it really cool to kids.

1543
01:26:38,661 --> 01:26:41,929
We'd have a black
market tobacco,

1544
01:26:41,931 --> 01:26:45,766
there would be tobacco probably
manufactured in Mexico,

1545
01:26:45,768 --> 01:26:49,736
or some other country and imported...
They'd find their way.

1546
01:26:49,738 --> 01:26:52,206
We know what works
for fighting tobacco.

1547
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:54,675
Smoking bans in public places,

1548
01:26:54,677 --> 01:26:58,679
<i>high tobacco taxes, secession
programs, education,</i>

1549
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:01,807
<i>and banning tobacco advertising.</i>

1550
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:07,287
NARRATOR: <i>What would happen</i>
<i>if we used the same approach.</i>

1551
01:27:07,289 --> 01:27:10,524
<i>Patrick Reynolds described</i>
<i>succeeding with cigarettes</i>

1552
01:27:10,526 --> 01:27:12,492
and applied that to all drugs?

1553
01:27:12,494 --> 01:27:16,563
That was tried in Portugal,
which had a huge drug problem,

1554
01:27:16,565 --> 01:27:23,804
<i>NBC sent reporters to study the drop in
addiction and abuse rates among teens.</i>

1555
01:27:23,806 --> 01:27:26,707
So have you ever used hashish?
GIRLS: No, never.

1556
01:27:26,709 --> 01:27:28,809
Why not? It's bad for us.

1557
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:33,714
NARRATOR: <i>Portuguese Prime
Minister Jose Socrates</i>

1558
01:27:33,716 --> 01:27:35,949
<i>was one of the architects</i>
<i>of the new policy,</i>

1559
01:27:35,951 --> 01:27:37,851
<i>has some advice</i>
<i>for the rest of us.</i>

1560
01:27:37,853 --> 01:27:40,988
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)

1561
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:42,990
TRANSLATOR: I think the strategy
can work in any country,

1562
01:27:42,992 --> 01:27:47,461
<i>of prejudice and take an</i>
<i>intelligent approach.</i>

1563
01:27:47,463 --> 01:27:49,730
NARRATOR: <i>Even America's
current drug czar admits</i>

1564
01:27:49,732 --> 01:27:52,299
<i>that law enforcement</i>
<i>isn't the answer to drugs.</i>

1565
01:27:52,301 --> 01:27:55,802
If you read the research, you
clearly and quickly come to realize

1566
01:27:55,804 --> 01:28:00,407
I think for too long we probably
thought we could either

1567
01:28:00,409 --> 01:28:02,576
arrest our way
out of the problem,

1568
01:28:02,578 --> 01:28:06,546
or solve it through some
criminal justice lens,

1569
01:28:06,548 --> 01:28:09,950
and I think we know from past
history that is not the case.

1570
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:17,891
<i>The single greatest public policy
failure of the last 50 years.</i>

1571
01:28:17,893 --> 01:28:20,027
The DEA don't want
the drug problem to stop.

1572
01:28:20,029 --> 01:28:22,529
District attorneys don't want
the problem to stop.

1573
01:28:22,531 --> 01:28:25,832
Prisons don't want the drug problem to stop.
They're pushing it on.

1574
01:28:26,935 --> 01:28:30,804
The only person who's
paying is the taxpayers.

1575
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:35,475
NARRATOR: <i>Freeway Rick Ross and Brian O'Dea
continue to give inspirational speeches</i>

1576
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:38,045
<i>on the dangers of addiction and
the failures of prohibition.</i>

1577
01:28:38,047 --> 01:28:42,082
O'DEA: <i>I was sentenced to 10 years.
Within an hour and a half,</i>

1578
01:28:42,084 --> 01:28:46,620
<i>I met guys in there who were</i>
<i>doing 75 years for pot.</i>

1579
01:28:46,622 --> 01:28:48,989
<i>One of these guys</i>
<i>has since died in prison.</i>

1580
01:28:48,991 --> 01:28:51,525
<i>And the other guys are</i>
<i>gonna die in prison.</i>

1581
01:28:51,527 --> 01:28:54,967
But I got the government selling me
cigarettes in there for 50 cents a pack.

1582
01:28:57,532 --> 01:29:03,603
Don't make sense, does it?
Didn't to me. Didn't to me.

1583
01:29:05,873 --> 01:29:08,575
NARRATOR: <i>Bobby Carlton,</i>
<i>now clean for over a decade,</i>

1584
01:29:08,577 --> 01:29:10,911
<i>runs a sober living house</i>
<i>in Los Angeles,</i>

1585
01:29:10,913 --> 01:29:16,516
You know, it's just the money is so stupid
that everybody's a part of the problem,

1586
01:29:16,518 --> 01:29:23,924
NARRATOR: <i>Big John now works as a union
electrician and earns over six figures a year.</i>

1587
01:29:23,926 --> 01:29:27,394
<i>He and Skipp Townsend volunteer
as community activists</i>

1588
01:29:27,396 --> 01:29:30,831
<i>and gang intervention specialists
in Southern California.</i>

1589
01:29:30,833 --> 01:29:34,101
I understand that I can't do any
better unless I know better.

1590
01:29:34,103 --> 01:29:37,604
And so for the most part when
individuals ask me for a job,

1591
01:29:37,606 --> 01:29:39,506
I understand that
nine out of ten,

1592
01:29:39,508 --> 01:29:45,645
It's just what they're sayin'. But they're
gonna revert back to what comes easiest.

1593
01:29:45,647 --> 01:29:48,148
The current takes the path
of least resistance.

1594
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:53,053
So, what's the easiest, what's
the easiest path? That's drugs.

1595
01:29:53,055 --> 01:29:56,156
NARRATOR: After a friend of his
was killed by one of the cartels,

1596
01:29:56,158 --> 01:29:58,558
<i>Pepe left the game.</i>
<i>For the time being.</i>

1597
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:02,796
Right now I'm a painter.
A simple painter.

1598
01:30:04,499 --> 01:30:10,704
And this... I enjoy my life right now, I'm fine.
But I know the way to make it.

1599
01:30:10,706 --> 01:30:13,540
If one day I need to, I will go.

1600
01:30:13,542 --> 01:30:15,909
NARRATOR: <i>Barry Cooper,
after constant arrests</i>

1601
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:17,878
<i>and raids on his family's home,</i>

1602
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:23,884
<i>outside the United States where
he continues to dedicate his life</i>

1603
01:30:23,886 --> 01:30:31,124
I'm not going to use our energy to try and
change the minds of the old Americans

1604
01:30:31,126 --> 01:30:35,195
that made the laws and expect
us to live under those laws.

1605
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:41,468
I'm going to use our energy to rally
the masses who already get it.

1606
01:30:42,837 --> 01:30:47,073
NARRATOR: <i>And Neill Franklin, after
30 years fighting the war on drugs,</i>

1607
01:30:47,075 --> 01:30:49,643
<i>is now the executive</i>
<i>director of LEAP,</i>

1608
01:30:49,645 --> 01:30:51,845
<i>an organization</i>
<i>of law enforcement</i>

1609
01:30:51,847 --> 01:30:54,915
<i>who are demanding an end</i>
<i>to the drug war.</i>

1610
01:30:54,917 --> 01:30:59,786
It wasn't until after his retirement
that Neill Franklin chose to speak out.

1611
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:03,757
What I have here is referred to as,
in law enforcement, as a shadow box.

1612
01:31:05,193 --> 01:31:09,796
<i>And it basically contains the law
enforcement officer's career.</i>

1613
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:12,199
<i>And in my</i>
<i>retirement celebration,</i>

1614
01:31:12,201 --> 01:31:15,936
<i>this was presented to me</i>
<i>by Ed Toatley.</i>

1615
01:31:15,938 --> 01:31:19,940
<i>Ed Toatley was probably</i>
<i>the best narcotics agent</i>

1616
01:31:19,942 --> 01:31:23,210
<i>that the Maryland state</i>
<i>police had ever seen.</i>

1617
01:31:23,212 --> 01:31:28,048
<i>Ed Toatley was assassinated in
October 2000 by a drug dealer.</i>

1618
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:36,990
You get killed in this thing, I'll be
like, my generation died in Vietnam.

1619
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:41,561
It's perhaps heroic, but it's
absolutely without meaning.

1620
01:31:41,563 --> 01:31:47,067
<i>Because whether you make the five
kilogram bust, 500 kilos, a truck load.</i>

1621
01:31:47,069 --> 01:31:49,903
<i>None of it makes any difference.</i>

1622
01:31:49,905 --> 01:31:54,007
Drug dealers and cops
are replaced just like that.

1623
01:31:54,009 --> 01:31:58,512
FRANKLIN: <i>People losing parents, people
losing sons, people losing daughters.</i>

1624
01:31:59,714 --> 01:32:02,916
<i>You know,</i>
<i>Ed's kid's lost a father.</i>

1625
01:32:02,918 --> 01:32:06,186
And those who are involved
in the illegal activity,

1626
01:32:07,588 --> 01:32:11,124
because you know what, their
lives are just as important.

1627
01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:21,101
NARRATOR: <i>If we
decriminalized all drugs,</i>

1628
01:32:21,103 --> 01:32:24,137
<i>we would have billions of
dollars to battle addiction,</i>

1629
01:32:24,139 --> 01:32:26,540
<i>drug abuse and poverty.</i>

1630
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:31,611
<i>But as long as we support</i>
<i>a drug war,</i>

1631
01:32:31,613 --> 01:32:35,282
we will continue to encourage our
children to pick up the game

1632
01:32:35,284 --> 01:32:39,019
<i>and discover for themselves how
to make money selling drugs.</i>
