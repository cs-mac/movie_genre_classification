1
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,578
<i>Reality?</i>

2
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,700
<i>You mean
this is the real world?</i>

3
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,749
<i>Huh?</i>

4
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,043
<i>I never thought of that.</i>

5
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,004
<i>My mother and I,
we had a house in Chicago.</i>

6
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,013
<i>We figured, well...</i>

7
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,893
<i>we'd get out of there, you know,
while the getting's good.</i>

8
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,353
<i>And so then
when I got to Vernon...</i>

9
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,015
<i>well, I called up
these real-estate people.</i>

10
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,183
<i>They sent me
their phone number.</i>

11
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,528
So then I seen a picture.

12
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:10,991
Well, the property was $2,200.
Of course...

13
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,907
they claim it was too much.

14
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,871
But, well, it wasn't too good.

15
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,032
It wasn't a castle, you know.

16
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,703
But it was a house, you know.
Five lots.

17
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:26,173
So, okay, bought it.

18
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,963
Had a mortgage for four years,
paid off...

19
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,758
and so I don't have
to pay no rent, see?

20
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,755
No taxes.

21
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,554
Old age.

22
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,560
No taxes.

23
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,198
<i>You got to like outdoor sports.</i>

24
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,443
<i>And I've always loved it.</i>

25
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,407
<i>Especially turkey hunting.</i>

26
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,200
<i>I killed my first turkey
when I was 10 years old.</i>

27
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,250
<i>I can't tell you
how many I've killed...</i>

28
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,748
<i>but I've killed a lot of 'em.</i>

29
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:54,344
<i>I run a business. I close the business
down if I have to to go turkey hunting.</i>

30
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,305
<i>It's just something I like.
It's just in me.</i>

31
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,474
<i>I can't tell you how I feel.</i>

32
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,223
<i>It's just a hell of a sport,
that's all.</i>

33
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,653
<i>Sometimes you can be
standing around...</i>

34
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,235
<i>and hear one jar the ground.</i>

35
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,904
And you just look
at the roads, the fire trails...

36
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:26,501
until you pick up fresh tracks,
and you know which way he's going.

37
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,672
You just go to that area...

38
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:34,802
stop, listen,
and hope that you hear one.

39
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:41,717
<i>Sometime they gobble
quite often early.</i>

40
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,936
<i>And sometime
it's five, 10, 15 minutes.</i>

41
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,022
<i>And later on in the morning,
sometime it's every 30 minutes.</i>

42
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,936
<i>You just can't tell.</i>

43
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,941
<i>They a smart bird.</i>

44
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,736
<i>The smartest we got
in this country.</i>

45
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,955
<i>See, we spend time like this
day in and day out...</i>

46
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,749
<i>day in and day out,
not hearing nothing.</i>

47
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,043
<i>But you know they're here.</i>

48
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,254
I sent 'em two checks.
One check for $12...

49
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,131
a three-year membership -

50
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,429
And three dollars' insurance.

51
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,225
So I waited ab- I don't know,
I waited a month or longer...

52
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,518
and I didn't get
no answer from 'em.

53
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,734
So then I had this lady
copy the checks...

54
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,066
you know, on a copier.

55
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,439
So then I sent
the copies to them...

56
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,283
and now they sent me
the jewel, see?

57
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,075
I don't know if the jewel
is genuine or not. Take a look.

58
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,759
I don't know
what I'm looking for.

59
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,927
I don't know.
What does a jeweler look for?

60
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:09,138
You know, those guys,
when you go into a jewelry store...

61
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:13,233
and if you want something examined,
they look through a lens?

62
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,569
And what are they looking for?

63
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,607
If you ask 'em, they'd go -

64
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,867
You ever seen a man's brains?

65
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,786
I've seen 'em.
I've picked 'em up, scooped 'em up...

66
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,877
and put 'em in -
do them up like brains -

67
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,995
you're buying brains.

68
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,964
But there's a bowl right here,
and there's a bowl here.

69
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,125
There's a bowl here
and a bowl there.

70
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,465
Now, they're connected
to the spine.

71
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,964
The spine goes
down the backbone.

72
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:47,593
And, uh, if all four...

73
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,766
of these, uh...

74
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:55,267
bowls or brains, if all four
of 'em is functioning, you can -

75
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:59,863
You are not a one-track mind.
You're a four-track mind.

76
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,197
And you can - You can -

77
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,821
I've seen a lot of folks.
They could type...

78
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,082
one letter -

79
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,623
Write me a letter and you a letter
on a typing machine...

80
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,338
and writing one way
with this hand -

81
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:21,130
writing your letter with this hand
and my letter with that.

82
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:25,097
And I can take a pencil
and sit down...

83
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,636
and write "cat shit" with this hand...

84
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,636
and "dog shit" with that one...

85
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,558
at the same time.

86
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,940
Two pencils.

87
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,526
I've done that lots of times.

88
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,570
These brains -

89
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:45,363
Now, what I was -
what I was telling you -

90
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,407
I can't stand up...

91
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,873
I don't believe,
without propping against something.

92
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,285
It gets me out of balance.

93
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,411
I got to get something.

94
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:00,006
You run one -
Now, if you ain't got that -

95
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,172
and I've often,
all over this town...

96
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,547
time and again, pointed it out,
see if anybody could do it.

97
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,224
If you run that foot
in a circle this way...

98
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,556
and then your hand
right the other way...

99
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:16,898
then just pick up your pistol
and keep wiggling your arm...

100
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,731
and singing a song.

101
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:24,231
That's four -
in other words, that's five things.

102
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,734
That's five things
I can do on this -

103
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:33,407
on one,
with this old knot up here.

104
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,551
Looks okay.

105
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,058
- Looks pretty close.
- Huh?

106
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,561
You're close. You're right on it.
Right between 'em.

107
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,689
I don't know if this is where
the valve stem was yellow.

108
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,461
That's a good tire.

109
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,465
Vernon 30 to Control.

110
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,599
<i>Go ahead.</i>

111
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,145
Quincy, can you give me
the correct 10-36?

112
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,570
<i>By my watch,
it's heading to 17:31.</i>

113
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,034
That's a big 10-4.
Appreciate it.

114
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,003
We don't have too much traffic
coming through now.

115
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:06,167
Sit and watch 'em come shooting
off the end of that bridge a little bit.

116
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:10,171
About the only thing I do
this time of day. I just...

117
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,634
sit around and wait.

118
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,347
You have to do this in a hurry...

119
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,225
'cause you gonna cover
several places at one time.

120
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,025
Not at one time, but...

121
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,649
as quick as you can,
'cause they gobble better...

122
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,525
earlier part of the morning.

123
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,745
The later in the morning it get,
the less they gobble.

124
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:39,708
So you usually -
you usually kill by...

125
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,828
oh, 6:00, 7:00 at the latest.

126
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,546
There's been a lot killed
after that, but...

127
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,131
that's the cream of the huntin' -

128
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,176
from daylight to 6:00, 7:00.

129
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,640
<i>And he's looking
for a fresh track now.</i>

130
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,062
<i>And if he finds a fresh track...</i>

131
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,149
<i>he'll stop, listen,
and go in on it.</i>

132
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:12,695
That's what he's doing -
walking and listening right now.

133
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,035
Looking for a fresh sign
that's crossed the graded road.

134
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,707
Where there's smoke,
there's fire, you know.

135
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,293
You find a fresh track,
you know there's a gobbler there...

136
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,040
<i>'cause this is
a prime area for turkey.</i>

137
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,311
<i>Look how that one's
bogged down there.</i>

138
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,898
Bogged an inch deep
there in that dirt.

139
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,942
<i>He weigh 18, 20 pounds.
Look at the size of the track.</i>

140
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:54,532
<i>Look how he's bogging up
that hard dirt.</i>

141
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,778
<i>He probably crossed there
late yesterday afternoon...</i>

142
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,405
<i>and roosted right back down here
in these woods.</i>

143
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:13,297
And if he's got a hen with him,
it's very hard to call him away.

144
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,887
You can believe that.

145
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,507
Anybody that'll tell you they can
call a gobbler away...

146
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,679
from a pack of hens,
just anytime -

147
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,054
Did you hear that?

148
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,858
Sounds almost like a turkey gobbling,
but it's not.

149
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,899
It's one of them
big woodpeckers pecking.

150
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,491
It'll fool you a lot of times.

151
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,246
Occasionally
you'll call a big gobbler...

152
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,541
away from some hen,
but very seldom.

153
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,460
<i>I... I...</i>

154
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:55,427
I'd rather not even try
to call one away.

155
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,638
Well, you always try,
but you can't do it.

156
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,678
I never have.

157
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,309
Very, very, very seldom.

158
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,733
<i>I have different areas...</i>

159
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,228
<i>I like to sit around and wait.</i>

160
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,481
<i>I sit here a lot of times.</i>

161
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,199
Since this car
was sitting around so much...

162
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,611
why, the people,
they don't know for sure...

163
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,534
if we have a police officer
on duty here or not.

164
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:27,158
So I can catch a lot of them
as they come across the bridge...

165
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,876
or come down through town.

166
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,872
Like this tanker.
He sounds like he's getting on it now.

167
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,805
You try to hold 'em down.

168
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,392
I hate to have to get out
and chase every one of 'em down...

169
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,148
but I try to let 'em
see me sitting here.

170
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,769
So then if I have
to write 'em up, why...

171
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,898
it's their own fault,
because they can see me sitting here.

172
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,070
I'm not trying to hide now.

173
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:04,739
But there is a few places where I sit
around where you can't hardly see me.

174
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,374
And that's why my radar gun,
when I have it-

175
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,994
I don't have it with me today.

176
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:14,498
I had to send it back in
and get it recertified.

177
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,375
So I'm waiting for it
to get back here.

178
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,923
It should be in
Friday or Saturday.

179
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,423
Then I can sit out here
and catch a bunch of 'em.

180
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,934
<i>They said he was 65 years old.</i>

181
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:34,476
<i>I don't know about' that', now
That's a long life for a mule.</i>

182
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,150
<i>But he eventually died.</i>

183
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,366
<i>They rooted him
over into that pond.</i>

184
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,986
That old skeleton lying there
with the hide all on him...

185
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,614
just as tough
as anything you ever seen.

186
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,412
And a big hole
in his throat here...

187
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,410
where the buzzards
and things...

188
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,129
had eaten every bit
that they could.

189
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,499
They couldn't eat him all.

190
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,126
I was a-fishing in there one day...

191
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,046
and dropped my bait
down there at that hole.

192
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:07,051
That old mule was laying in there,
you know, all puffed up.

193
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:10,099
Yeah, all dried up
on the skeleton.

194
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,688
And there was
a big warmouth perch...

195
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,105
run out of him up here
and bit my hook.

196
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,729
Took it in that old mule
right that quick, you know?

197
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,949
And, uh, he got off of there.

198
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,614
Got loose.
And I went to pull the hook out...

199
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,864
and I must have hung it
on one of his ribs.

200
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,788
I had to break it off,
but I put on another hook...

201
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:37,164
and dropped it down there,
and I caught a big one, you know.

202
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,833
The bones
had come out of his legs.

203
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,503
The skin was laying there,
you know, and it was tough as a -

204
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,006
just tough as a bear,
you know.

205
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,134
And I got over -
it was about this deep in the water -

206
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,353
and went down in there
and got a hold of them legs...

207
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,981
and drug that old mule
out on the hill...

208
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,772
and there was 114 warmouth in him,
warmouth perch.

209
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:02,693
I could hear 'em a-flutterin'.
Just as I run out on the hill with him...

210
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,032
the water run out of him...

211
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,698
and I could hear 'em a-flutterin'
in there, you know.

212
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,453
It was in planted pines...

213
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:16,248
but he'd roosted in a branch,
other side of planted pines.

214
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,873
And I eased in a row
of planted pines, you know.

215
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,758
Planted pines -

216
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,378
they're not exactly
in a straight row like that.

217
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,380
They'll be, you know, offset.

218
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,892
So you got a variation
of about two foot, maybe.

219
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:36,640
I'd get in them planted pines,
and I'd walk across the rows...

220
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:41,065
crossways to the rows, till I got right
even with where he was at in the swamp.

221
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,571
And I knew.
I said, "Right yonder he's at".

222
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,983
I'd walk crossways to the rows
till I got to that row.

223
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:51,409
I knew he was at the end of it.
I was working my way in and out.

224
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,282
<i>And I slipped up there.</i>

225
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,794
<i>I slipped up close enough to the branch.
I could see the turkey...</i>

226
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,879
<i>in a pine tree.</i>

227
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,999
<i>He was a-gobbling.</i>

228
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,590
And I got to that pine,
and I looked.

229
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,972
It was about 30 foot
over there to that other pine...

230
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,014
and it was about
25, 30 foot more to the turkey.

231
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:17,264
I looked at that turkey,
and I looked at that open spot.

232
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,400
I says, "There ain't no way
I can get no further".

233
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:26,364
I just eased
that gun up real slow...

234
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,154
behind them pines,
then eased down.

235
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,450
And there he is, right there.

236
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,169
I think he's got
about an 11-inch beard.

237
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:44,666
He hit the ground.
It sounded like a ton of bricks.

238
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,674
Now, this here is a gopher.

239
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,838
He's not a turtle.

240
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,557
He's harmless.
He won't bite you.

241
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:39,805
I don't know just how come him
to be way down in here.

242
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,229
He don't like
this kind of land here.

243
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,192
He's, uh -

244
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,153
High, dry,
sandy land for him...

245
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,989
and he'll dig his den to be...

246
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:55,203
as far as
20 feet deep sometimes.

247
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,699
And he's good to eat too.

248
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:03,203
I don't eat him,
but people do eat him.

249
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:08,959
He's just a fine piece of meat
for the dining table.

250
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:17,725
I believe he wants to walk now.

251
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,408
His motor's slow-paced.

252
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,996
I said, "Y'all just leave my gun here.
I got to use the bathroom.

253
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,168
You got to come back
this same way. "

254
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,883
They said, "Yeah".
All right.

255
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,593
<i>L 901 my gun.</i>

256
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,426
I didn't get to use
the bathroom, though.

257
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,799
I was fixing to...

258
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,177
but right out in them pines,
I heard one gobble.

259
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,896
And they'd done left.

260
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,521
And I said, "My God".

261
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,941
Boy, that's the best diarrhea
medicine in the world.

262
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,689
Mm-mm!
You hear a turkey gobblin'...

263
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,237
you forget all about diarrhea
and everything.

264
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,111
Headaches, anything.
That'd cure anything.

265
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,238
I grabbed my gun,
and I tore out.

266
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,617
Must have went a quarter mile.
Went through a bunch of pines...

267
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,619
and he double-gobbled.

268
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:30,632
I knew right then that I had
a pretty good chance of killing him.

269
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:34,343
Man, it hadn't been 30 minutes
since one had been killed.

270
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,256
Bless your heart.
The next time he gobbled...

271
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,257
there he was, right out there...

272
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,805
in that wiregrass
and broom sage.

273
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,017
I just yelped real low to him.

274
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,811
He gobbled.

275
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:51,186
He was coming straight toward me.
He wasn't walking, he wasn't running.

276
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,984
It was sort of a little fast trot.

277
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:58,280
And I had a good blind in some palmettos,
sitting behind some palmettos.

278
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,324
I done had my gun on him.

279
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,198
When he got up there -
He was walking...

280
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,998
a little too fast to shoot him,
'cause I wanted a sure shot.

281
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,837
And what I done, I just whistled.

282
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,214
And he stopped,
and he looked...

283
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:19,885
and when he looked up,
that was the end of it. Pow.

284
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,509
And that's him
right there in the middle...

285
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:27,021
<i>with about an 11-inch beard.</i>

286
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,220
Now, this possum -
I didn't catch him myself.

287
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:11,357
But another feller did.
He was eating his chickens.

288
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:15,478
And he caught him
and brought him down here to me.

289
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,776
He said I was the only fellow...

290
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,741
that knew what to do with a possum.

291
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,915
I'm a-gonna keep him
for the Fun Day in Wausau...

292
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,963
and sell him to -
sell him to the fellows.

293
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,680
They auction 'em off over there
for $1,200 to $1,500.

294
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:48,727
That's a great price for a possum,
don't you know.

295
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,024
<i>Uh, I'll put him -
put him back.</i>

296
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,773
You've got to be careful
with one of them things.

297
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,775
They'll bite you.

298
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,994
I've been bit by 'em.

299
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,878
I've been bit by everything
there is in the country,

300
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,793
wild game, you know -
except a rattlesnake.

301
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,667
I was sure enough
watching for him.

302
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,971
He just walked.

303
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,262
No rain in it.
Got to looking...

304
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:30,603
and his track
was in that track...

305
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,721
that trailer track...

306
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:36,350
which we'd just talked to the man
five minutes behind us.

307
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,605
The trailer made a track.
We come out the same way he come in.

308
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,108
And you know
that's got to be a red-hot track...

309
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,656
'cause it's on top
of that trailer track.

310
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:50,744
You understand what I'm talkin' about?
That we'd just talked to back behind us.

311
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,538
"Shh. " He's right out here.

312
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,411
Stepped outside
and yelped one time...

313
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,789
and he come right back, gobbling.

314
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,507
Hot daggone!
We started grabbing guns...

315
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,252
and getting into position.

316
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,015
And I told Snake,
I said, "Snake...

317
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:11,056
that turkey's not coming back
across the road.

318
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,679
There ain't no way
he's coming back across the road.

319
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,689
He's going the other way. "

320
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:19,686
We'd sit there and we'd yelp to him,
and he'd gobble.

321
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:23,197
He'd go over this way,
and he'd gobble.

322
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,905
Go back that a-way, and he'd gobble.
He's wanting us to come on.

323
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,825
But we wasn't going on.
We was expecting him to backtrack.

324
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:33,074
And I told Snake he wouldn't backtrack
and come back to us.

325
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,200
This went on
for about half an hour.

326
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,369
I told Snake, I said...

327
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,623
"I'm tired of this.
I'm gonna kill that turkey. "

328
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,092
<i>And I yelped one time...</i>

329
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,552
<i>and he double-gobbled.</i>

330
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,715
<i>And that's all I yelped.</i>

331
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,558
<i>And the next thing you know,
here he comes -</i>

332
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,554
<i>just a-gobbling all the way.</i>

333
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,557
I shot him,
and he hit the ground.

334
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,558
I mean, he was doing a da-do...

335
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,277
bouncing around
about three, four foot high.

336
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,568
I run down there to pick him up,
and he got up.

337
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,573
He had a broke wing,
and I knocked him down.

338
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,988
I said, "My God,
he's fixin' to get away".

339
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,831
I just tried to shoot his head.

340
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:18,122
I shot a big hole in the ground.
I missed his head...

341
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,668
because if I'd shot the whole turkey,
I'd have tore him to pieces.

342
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,838
And I missed him.
He was going down the pine run...

343
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,801
and I said,
"Well, one more shot".

344
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,342
And I shot him
and just rolled him over.

345
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:31,761
And it was cloudy, like I said.

346
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:34,635
And during all this time
and around in them pines...

347
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,478
everything looks alike.

348
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,849
To me it does. Anybody else
that's ever been in there -

349
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:43,773
You can't - Excuse me.
You can't tell where you're at.

350
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,487
I got in there...

351
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,404
and when I killed the turkey,
I didn't know where I was at.

352
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,527
I walked around and...

353
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,738
I'd got lost.

354
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,618
I was hollering for Snake.
I'd walk the direction I thought it was.

355
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:02,755
I was going in the right direction,
but them pines, everything looks alike.

356
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,624
<i>And I started hollering "Snake!"
just as loud as I could.</i>

357
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,544
They knowed I was turned around.
They was settin' up there...

358
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,889
just a-laughing like the devil at me.
They wouldn't answer me.

359
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,508
But anyway, I drug that one out
the next morning...

360
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,681
after them two
the morning before.

361
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,975
And there his beard is.

362
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:22,312
About the same length.
About an 11-inch beard.

363
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,185
The one on the far right here.

364
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,444
<i>Thirty-five, 40 years ago...</i>

365
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,493
<i>there wasn't no wigglers.</i>

366
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,332
<i>There wasn't no wigglers.
These wigglers is a -</i>

367
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,711
<i>is kind of a new thing
in this country.</i>

368
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,172
<i>These wigglers
have been in here...</i>

369
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,675
<i>about 20-something years there.</i>

370
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:52,717
These wigglers is a new -
a new thing come in here.

371
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,840
I reckon they was here,
but, uh...

372
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:58,432
I don't know
where they accumulated from.

373
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:01,726
I got the seed of these
from south Florida...

374
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,849
is where I got them.

375
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,610
This is not a regular-

376
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:09,480
regular wiggler
like everybody's got here.

377
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,733
This here is what they call...

378
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,781
an orchard-worm wiggler,
that I got here.

379
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,825
That's the reason
people come here...

380
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,744
and wants to beat me
out of 'em like they do.

381
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:26,046
<i>I don't know
where all this water comes from.</i>

382
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:29,542
<i>They must have
a lot of ditches up there.</i>

383
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:33,387
Well, of course, if you're taking
a history of the, uh -

384
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,968
of Vernon,
well, I can't tell you.

385
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,387
All I can tell you
about the river is...

386
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,352
somebody told me
boats used to come down here.

387
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,724
And I says, "That river
must have been wider," you know.

388
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,600
The creek, they call it.

389
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,648
But they said no.

390
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:52,399
So, I mean, freight boats
used to come down.

391
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:56,368
Just like freight
on the Mississippi River.

392
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,408
And, uh -

393
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,248
But I don't know.

394
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,409
I can't figure it out.

395
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,293
Maybe they used big canoes.

396
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,434
<i>There's a big red wiggler...</i>

397
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,271
<i>and there's a wiggler
that they call the eel worm...</i>

398
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:27,813
<i>and this orchard-worm wiggler.</i>

399
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,402
<i>And then they got
a big ringneck wiggler.</i>

400
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,695
Then they got one
they call the night crawler.

401
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,864
He gets -
He weigh like that.

402
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,862
I got some of 'em...

403
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:43,741
from up in Joplin, Missouri,
and brought 'em down here.

404
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,458
They up there.

405
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,704
I brought 'em down here
and put 'em in a bed -

406
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:52,629
little old bed I had yonder -
and they all left.

407
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:56,049
They crawl at night.
You can't keep them in a place.

408
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,423
They stay around
in the edge of the swamp.

409
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,637
<i>Out there
there's a lot of muddy water.</i>

410
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:08,686
<i>That reminds me of the story
about the two sailors.</i>

411
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,401
<i>They were looking at the water,
and one says...</i>

412
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,567
<i>"It's a lot of water out there,"
and the other guy says...</i>

413
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,656
<i>"Yeah, that's just the top of it. "</i>

414
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,875
<i>Hey, those snakes out here,
they can swim.</i>

415
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,211
<i>Be careful of that.</i>

416
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,831
<i>Those snakes can crawl
over that water...</i>

417
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:35,467
<i>just like they're crawling
over the ground.</i>

418
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,382
<i>My! 1-</i>

419
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,846
<i>And some people, they says,</i>

420
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,929
<i>"You going swimming?"
"Uh-uh. "</i>

421
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,304
<i>You're swimming around,
and then you look up...</i>

422
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,772
<i>and you see this snake
coming toward you?</i>

423
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,891
<i>Oh, brother!</i>

424
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,862
See that jump?

425
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:03,158
You know what kind of fish that was?
That could've been a garfish.

426
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,457
Usually the garfish,
they feed on top...

427
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:10,373
and if there's little minnows on the top,
they snap 'em up.

428
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,542
You ever see a garfish?

429
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:16,963
He's got a bill about like that -
you know, his nose.

430
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,927
And when he -

431
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,515
He usually catches
what he goes after, you know.

432
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:26,431
I've never studied no book
on these wigglers.

433
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,930
What I know about 'em
is just self-experience.

434
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:35,895
They got books on 'em,
but them books is wrong.

435
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,944
They don't teach you right.

436
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,534
They don't teach you right
on 'em.

437
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:46,076
Teach you what kind of feed
to feed 'em, and...

438
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,073
how to do 'em and all that...

439
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,993
and it's all wrong,
in my book.

440
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:56,874
<i>Why he wanted to take his shoe off
to pull the trigger, I don't know.</i>

441
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:01,094
The very next damn day
after we was workin'.

442
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,213
And that day, he says...

443
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:07,263
"That'll be the last thing I ever do,
is to shoot myself. "

444
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:10,308
- Which it was.
- Well, they weren't none of his -

445
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,228
weren't none of his brains
a-working, period.

446
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,443
Yeah, he was -
I tell you, he had two shells...

447
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,938
laying under the sill
of the house.

448
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,235
He crawled under there
and got them.

449
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:25,406
Come out and told his wife,
"I've got one for you and one for me.

450
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,325
We're going. "

451
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:30,746
She run him down and take
one of 'em away from him.

452
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:35,246
He sat down in his old
homemade straight chair...

453
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:39,216
and he taked his -
pulled his shoe off...

454
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,962
and he set that gun barrel
right there...

455
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,130
and pulled the trigger.

456
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:49,143
He pulled his shoe off
to use his big toe to -

457
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:53,431
Yeah, but hell, if I was gonna do that,
I'd just reach down with my finger.

458
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:56,058
Well, it'd have moved his head
from the gun barrel.

459
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,481
- No, it wouldn't.
- He'd have had to stoop over.

460
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:02,819
He pulled his shoe off
in order to use his big toe to -

461
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,406
Everybody don't do things alike,
but that's the way he done it.

462
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,863
<i>Knowing that the Lord
had called me to preach...</i>

463
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,583
<i>I had to pursue what the Lord
placed me on this world to do...</i>

464
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,000
<i>so I started back
into the ministry.</i>

465
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,293
<i>Sometimes in this line of work...</i>

466
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,792
<i>you don't have the finances
you'd like to have.</i>

467
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,919
<i>You see things
you'd like to have...</i>

468
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,968
<i>and you sometimes wish
you were back in a secular position...</i>

469
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,840
<i>making better money.</i>

470
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:32,686
<i>But then I have a better situation
than most people realize.</i>

471
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:36,022
When I have a need,
I just pray for it.

472
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:39,359
Just like the van
that I have now.

473
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,520
I felt I had a need for it...

474
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:45,190
and so I began to pray,
and then I began to go price vans.

475
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:49,616
But I didn't feel like my prayers
and the prices I found on the vans...

476
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,864
coincided exactly the way
they ought to...

477
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,158
because they were
far out of my reach.

478
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:58,628
But still, I felt like if the Lord
wanted me to have a van, I'd get one.

479
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:02,921
So in the process, a couple of weeks
after I'd given up the idea...

480
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,385
of finding one I could afford...

481
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:08,096
I ran into a man,
and he had a van.

482
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:11,558
I was looking at it,
and he gave me the price on it.

483
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,014
I told him that was
out of my range.

484
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:17,389
He said, "Well, I've got
a friend over in Marianna...

485
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,900
that has a brand-new '79 van.

486
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:23,361
It's been on his lot
for eight months...

487
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:27,324
and he's priced it down to $5,000,
where it can be bought.

488
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,068
I know it can be bought
for $5,000."

489
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,946
I said, "That's the range
I was looking for".

490
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,075
Sure enough, I called the man.
He brought it to me...

491
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,289
and in three hours,
I owned the van.

492
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,923
God made all things...

493
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,924
that was made.

494
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,214
All things that was made.

495
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:51,010
And he looked on it
and pronounced it...

496
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:54,101
good and very good!

497
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:59,598
He made all these things
that we've got today.

498
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,267
And he said it was good
and very good.

499
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:06,735
But you could go
to the extreme on anything.

500
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:10,985
You can go
to the extreme on anything...

501
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,988
and make a hog of yourself.

502
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,457
<i>But as long as you let it go
like God intended it...</i>

503
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,747
you need never worry.

504
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,291
He'll give you power
and strength and wit...

505
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,502
to take care of the deal.

506
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,923
There was a huge oak
right on the bank of the creek.

507
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,137
I stood under the oak,
and I said...

508
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:33,799
"Lord, I don't know if you want me
to have this lot or not.

509
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:37,928
But if you do, then make it
possible for me to have it. "

510
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:41,307
So I went along for over a year...

511
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,818
and I didn't know
if the lot had sold or anything.

512
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,653
But over a year later,
I had as much money...

513
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,865
as the man was asking
for the lot.

514
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,155
I went to him to find out
if he still had it...

515
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,994
and sure enough, he did.

516
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,451
He said,
"But it's really ironic.

517
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,666
I've had this thing sold
three times...

518
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,577
<i>and every time I've had it sold,
something's come up...</i>

519
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:06,548
and the party going to buy it
didn't go through with the deal.

520
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,508
I hope yours goes through. "

521
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:12,592
I says, "It's gonna go through.
I know this is an answer to prayer".

522
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:17,684
# Sing the wondrous love
of Jesus #

523
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:22,398
# Sing his mercy and his grace #

524
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:27,190
# In the mansions
bright and blessed #

525
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:30,947
# He'll prepare for us a place #

526
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:36,070
<i># When we all get to heaven #</i>

527
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:40,665
<i># What a day of rejoicing
that will be #</i>

528
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:46,039
# When we all see Jesus #

529
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:51,635
# We'll sing and shout
the victory #

530
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:57,220
I was reading Romans
not too awfully long ago...

531
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:00,727
and over and over,
this word "therefore" -

532
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,638
which is the first word
in our scripture this morning -

533
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,357
began to pop out at me.

534
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,897
And I begin to think about it...

535
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,530
because I remembered somewhere
back yonder when I was in school...

536
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,742
that an English teacher
taught me something...

537
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,323
about the meaning of words.

538
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:22,416
And this word "therefore"
had a specific meaning.

539
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:26,253
And I think, "Well, if Paul
is using this word so many times...

540
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,371
there must be a reason for it. "

541
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,875
<i>So immediately,
I went to Webster's Dictionary...</i>

542
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,597
and I began to look up what the word
"therefore" was all about.

543
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:39,683
And I found the word
to be a conjunction.

544
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:43,429
Now, I had long forgotten
what a conjunction was.

545
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:47,691
And so as soon as I realized
it was a conjunction...

546
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:51,277
I thumbed back through the dictionary
to the word "conjunction"...

547
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:55,361
to see what a conjunction was,
and Webster? Dictionary said...

548
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:59,532
that a conjunction
is an indeclinable word...

549
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:03,373
that connects
two thoughts together.

550
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:07,745
And so I said, "Well, what does
this word 'indeclinable' mean?"

551
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:10,964
So I looked up
the word "indeclinable"...

552
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:15,127
and found out that it meant
that it was unchangeable.

553
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:19,469
And so I found out
that "therefore" was a conjunction...

554
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,683
that could not be changed...

555
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,724
that connected
two thoughts together.

556
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:28,314
And so therefore,
whenever I found this out...

557
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:32,652
I looked at that word again
in the first verse of our scripture...

558
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:36,694
and I said, "Well, certainly,
Paul must have said something...

559
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:40,911
that this word is connecting together,
so let's see what it was. "

560
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:44,452
And when I began to look back,
I found out that Paul...

561
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,870
had used that word "therefore"...

562
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,665
many times in Romans
before this...

563
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:52,505
and many times
in Romans after this.

564
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:56,840
And so I really got interested,
so I looked in my concordance...

565
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:01,347
and I found out that Paul
used the word "therefore"...

566
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:05,181
over 119 times...

567
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,724
in his writings.

568
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:11,020
And so I think,
"If he used the word 'therefore'...

569
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:15,278
over 119 times, I need to find out
what the Greek says about it. "

570
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:18,365
So I looked up
what the Greek meaning was...

571
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,904
<i>and the Greek word was "on"...</i>

572
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,949
which had a triple meaning.

573
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,368
The first one was "accordingly"...

574
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:30,536
the next one was "likewise then,"
and then "therefore".

575
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:34,456
Paul says,
"Therefore you receive the peace".

576
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:37,209
So if you're here this morning,
you're Christian...

577
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,675
<i>and you don't have that peace,
I'll tell you what's happened:</i>

578
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:44,349
You have taken back over...

579
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,469
the controls of your life...

580
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:50,438
and you're holding on to that...

581
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:54,310
which you ought to leave
in God's hands.

582
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:57,813
As a result, you've lost
the peace of your salvation...

583
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:01,362
and you won't gain it back
until you have...

584
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:05,077
another "therefore" experience.

585
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,577
I thank God this morning
for the "therefores"...

586
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,209
of Paul here in Romans.

587
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:15,081
Perhaps there's someone here
this morning who's never received Christ.

588
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,125
They've never let him come
into their hearts by faith.

589
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:21,844
They've never said, "Lord, I want you
to have your way in my heart".

590
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,259
You know what God's way
in your heart is?

591
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,974
God wants to come and cleanse you
from your unrighteousness...

592
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,139
and make something beautiful
out of your life.

593
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,262
He wants to forgive you
of your sins.

594
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,272
And God says, "You come on.

595
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,642
Just believe, and I'll forgive you. "

596
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,646
<i>The most important thing
about turkey hunting...</i>

597
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,273
<i>is knowing your woods.</i>

598
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,399
<i>You can snatch me or Snake up...</i>

599
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:47,904
and carry us off to a place
that we're not familiar with...

600
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:51,124
we don't know the woods,
the country.

601
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,536
Hey, man, you're lost.

602
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,004
You're lost.

603
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,125
Be just like taking me out of Vernon
and sending me to New York City.

604
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:03,469
I mean, you just can't
do nothing with 'em.

605
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:07,303
Knowing the woods.
Knowing which way they travel.

606
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,142
So in fact,
just knowing the woods...

607
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,307
<i>is one of the -</i>

608
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,561
<i>Know the terrain, man.</i>

609
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,106
And just knowing the range.

610
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:22,356
And when you go
to a new part of the country...

611
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,359
hey, man, you're lost -
or I am.

612
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,162
<i>Any turkey hunter's lost.</i>

613
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,832
I don't, uh...

614
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,714
really know of any crimes
that's going on here.

615
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,755
Just like any town,
anywhere you go...

616
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,924
you're gonna have
little incidents...

617
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,549
of, you know,
things popping up.

618
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,427
Like someone will walk in
one of the stores...

619
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,930
and they might
pick up an apple...

620
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,854
or a package of clothespins
or bobby pins...

621
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:01,774
or razor blades
or something like this.

622
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,693
But this goes on in all towns.

623
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:08,864
And, uh - Nothing really
more serious than that.

624
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:11,784
Not at this time, that I know of.

625
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:17,370
I traveled along the road with a fella -
in a car, of course -

626
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,587
and I was looking,
and I said...

627
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,548
"Hey, Barney,
you see that water over there?"

628
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,793
And he says, "Yeah".

629
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:28,797
So then we come right up to it,
and there was no water there.

630
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,673
That was just a mirage.

631
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,800
In other words, uh -

632
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,475
Well, to be, uh...

633
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:39,475
scientific about it, uh -

634
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,569
the lights -
you know, the rays or the -

635
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,733
the light bends, you know.

636
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,990
And, uh - So I mean...

637
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:50,736
if you get a different reflection,
say, for instance...

638
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,113
maybe a diamond
don't even shine.

639
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,786
Maybe it's just the way it's cut...

640
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,330
and the way the light hits it.

641
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,920
It's just like some day
after the rain.

642
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:03,790
You take a picture
of those drops on the trees...

643
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,259
and you can see 'em.

644
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,345
It's almost more beautiful
than the diamond.

645
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:13,387
I was out here
in these woods one night...

646
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:16,261
and I just had a feeling
that someone was out there...

647
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,806
and I heard that someone had fired
a couple shots out there.

648
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,025
It kind of had me worried...

649
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,439
that someone was out there.

650
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,610
I didn't know whether my walkie-talkie
was working right or not.

651
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,735
But one time
I was kind of worried...

652
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,908
or scared,
whatever you might want to call it.

653
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,248
But this'll happen
to the best of 'em.

654
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:40,585
Sometimes you just have
that feeling that there's someone...

655
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,830
up close to you
or trying to get to you...

656
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,299
when you're out
like that by yourself.

657
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,554
I had the camera,
and I was lucky.

658
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:53,673
And I held the opera glasses...

659
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,472
against the lens of the camera
and snapped it.

660
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,934
Of course,
I just about judged...

661
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,477
you know, where the -

662
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,647
I couldn't line it up
any other way because...

663
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:09,022
when you had the opera glass
on the lens, you couldn't see nothing.

664
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,445
And I held it up,
and it turned out.

665
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:14,319
I don't know
if this is the moon or not.

666
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,487
It looks like some clouds.

667
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:24,671
I don't know
if this is a star or what.

668
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:27,799
Well, no, it couldn't be that...

669
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,917
because, uh -

670
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:33,512
Well, that's a picture of the star.
I just took the camera...

671
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,348
and pointed it up there -
I didn't even sight it -

672
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,135
and then took
the picture that way.

673
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:43,265
Of course, as you can see,
that picture ain't too good.

674
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,643
It's a cheap camera.
You get a cheap picture.

675
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,270
Luck. Luck, you know.

676
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:53,070
When something turns out,
you say, "Gee, I'm lucky".

677
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,068
Right?

678
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:59,539
Of course, you see,
when you have a camera -

679
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,576
you have a camera,
and you point it at a certain -

680
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,704
Just like if you had a gun.
You don't shoot, do you?

681
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,373
If you had a gun
and pointed it at something...

682
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,499
you're liable to hit
what you're pointing at...

683
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,502
and then again
you might not, see?

684
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:16,764
The bullet came in...

685
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:19,225
at just about this angle...

686
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,432
and went into my seat here.

687
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,181
You can see
I haven't had that repaired yet.

688
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,559
Small hole there.
It went in there...

689
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,853
and lodged in the back
of the seat.

690
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,405
The county sheriff's office
came out to investigate...

691
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,241
and they had to dig it
out of the backseat -

692
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,581
out of the back part of the seat.

693
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,200
It came in at an angle
from the road.

694
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:50,790
I still don't know why they did it.
Probably just to frighten me a little bit.

695
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:54,920
But I'm not one that's gonna
frighten easy about things.

696
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,389
It don't bug you too much...

697
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,884
but the closer you get on him -

698
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,887
You want to make
the kill so bad.

699
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,936
It's in your blood,
or you wouldn't be out here huntin'.

700
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:11,436
And believe me, it's in mine,
and Snake's too.

701
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,739
And the closer it gets...

702
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,951
it's just like you're gonna
be electrocuted.

703
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,454
Each day, it comes closer -

704
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:27,119
<i>- The tension goes on -
- Tension builds up.</i>

705
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:31,836
And tension builds up.
It builds up in me.

706
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:34,209
I don't realize it...

707
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,758
but it's always a-building up.

708
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,472
Building up, building up,
building up.

709
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,475
And the closer it gets,
the worser it gets.

710
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,766
And after a while,
it comes to a point...

711
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:50,357
that you forget about it
when it gets right there on you.

712
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,399
You go blank.
You're concentrating on making the kill.

713
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,490
And once you make the kill...

714
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,734
you shoot, run, get the turkey...

715
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:03,033
or run him down or miss him.

716
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:06,328
Then all that tension...

717
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,999
that's built up in you, I mean...

718
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,506
it-it makes me sick.

719
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:18,007
You get the dry heaves,
like you got up on a morning...

720
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:20,300
after a Saturday night...

721
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:23,641
with the dry heaves
from a drunk?

722
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,851
Gag and puke.
Just gag, you know.

723
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:33,647
It's nothing but your nerves built up
that's dying down.

724
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:36,021
That's all it is.

725
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,986
In four, five minutes,
I'm all right.

726
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:42,406
Every star you see up there,
maybe it is a world.

727
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,700
I mean, it was made
for some purpose.

728
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:50,084
It's just up there, see,
and then maybe...

729
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:53,580
in the future
maybe there'll be one Irish world...

730
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:57,083
one German world,
one Russian world...

731
00:47:57,208 --> 00:48:01,384
and one colored world,
you know.

732
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:05,850
I mean, each party has
their own world, you know.

733
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,060
But who knows?

734
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:10,225
You don't know God's plan.

735
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:13,232
Even Jesus Christ didn't know,
you know.

736
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:16,853
It says right in the Bible
that no man knows that -

737
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,730
can find out
the answer to that -

738
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,233
when the end of the world is.

739
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,995
Well, not the end of the world,
but the end of our -

740
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:30,328
our world, you know -
I mean our-

741
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:33,453
our scheme of things -
politicians, you know.

742
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,421
In a little town
when you talk to somebody...

743
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,924
and you tell them about...

744
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,085
the lights on the road,
they're not blinking...

745
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,508
well, they don't want to take
no responsibility.

746
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,929
I says, "Who do you call?
D.O.T. or -"

747
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,973
Well, they didn't know, see?

748
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,847
They don't care.

749
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:56,476
They should run 'em
out of town on a rail.

750
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,773
Tar and feathers.

751
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,862
Yeah, I like that.

752
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,324
That tar and feathers, boy.

753
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:06,194
Wouldn't you like that?
To see some old -

754
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:09,948
some guy or some kid
that did something wrong...

755
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,916
and they'd tar and feather him?

756
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:16,128
He'd have something
to think about, wouldn't he?

757
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,257
"The next time, we'll give you
the hot seat, buddy. "

758
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,717
I never saw anything
more perfect in my life...

759
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:29,217
than to see
the perfection of God himself.

760
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:38,318
"That thing just happened".

761
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,729
"That just happened. "

762
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:43,026
"That just happened. "

763
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:48,570
Folks thinks that way
all the time.

764
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,947
"That just happened. "

765
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:55,577
There was an old feller talking to me
in that house up yonder.

766
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:58,875
He said,
"There ain't no such thing as a god".

767
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:04,047
Well, I said, "Mr. Day... "

768
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:08,093
I said, "You believe you're here,
don't you?"

769
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:10,808
"Yeah, I believe I'm here. "

770
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:16,640
I said, "Do you believe
any man on earth made you?"

771
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:18,892
"No, I didn't make me. "

772
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,896
I said, "Do you believe any man
on earth made Adam and Eve?"

773
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,115
He said,
"No, I don't believe it".

774
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:30,078
I said, "What made 'em?
How come I'm here?"

775
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:33,664
He said,
"That just happened".

776
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:38,378
I said, "You saying 'just happened,'
let's call that God.

777
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:40,622
Let's give it another name...

778
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:48,008
and say, 'that just happened,'
'just happened".'

779
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:52,391
Whenever I got through
with work, I -

780
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:56,054
- You had a vacation coming in.
- had a vacation coming in.

781
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,769
The boss man give me a bonus.

782
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:03,395
So I come in home, and we left
that evening and went to - started out.

783
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:06,656
We drove all night and all day.
We didn't stop.

784
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:10,402
1,413 miles out there.

785
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:14,281
<i>White Sand Missile Base, out there.</i>

786
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:18,035
<i>That's where the first atomic bomb
was ever dropped.</i>

787
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:21,913
<i>Sand dunes, you know.
There are sand dunes in there.</i>

788
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:25,507
<i>And that sand, it crawls,
and it crawls over the roads.</i>

789
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,423
<i>They're sweeping it
with a sweeper all the time...</i>

790
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:30,717
<i>to keep it
from covering up the roads.</i>

791
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:33,717
It's growing sand.

792
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:37,436
That sand grows until -

793
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:42,184
The desert runs out
an average of 14 feet a year.

794
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:45,152
They got graders.
They keep it graded off the road.

795
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:47,613
It get bigger by 14 feet a year.

796
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:51,196
There's graders out there all the time
grading that sand off the road.

797
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:55,242
Pushing the sand back off of the roads
where you get in there.

798
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,990
<i>Build new roads every day.</i>

799
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,789
<i>Wind come.
You know, that dry sand...</i>

800
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:04,171
<i>and it wraps up so deep
with sand overnight.</i>

801
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:08,418
<i>I reckon it' run
as high as a telephone pole.</i>

802
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,715
Paid and went in there...

803
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:14,306
and got in there
where the white sand's at...

804
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:16,471
and, uh...

805
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:20,138
we got us some white sand.

806
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:24,142
I got a jar here
where it grows in it.

807
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:37,488
See, I had just
a little bit of this in this jar...

808
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:39,908
whenever I brought it out.

809
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:43,161
And now, you see,
my jar is nearly full.

810
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:46,376
It grows. It grows. It crawls.

811
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:49,000
It crawls up the side
of the jar, you see?

812
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,715
I reckon it gonna fill up the jar.

813
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:55,055
In two more years
it will fill up this jar.

814
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,891
They say it grow 14 feet a year...

815
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,808
out towards the town
where Billy the Kid got killed.

816
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:05,183
They say it'll cover that town
in a year to come.

817
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,351
This century, they say.

818
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:09,524
Less than a hundred years...

819
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:12,861
- Cover that town.
- that desert will eat it up.

820
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:50,561
<i>Would you look at that tree?
There's one, two, three, four...</i>

821
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,526
<i>five, six...</i>

822
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,944
seven, eight...

823
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,318
nine,10,11, 12,13...

824
00:53:57,443 --> 00:54:00,743
<i>14, 15, 16, 17, 18...</i>

825
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,874
<i>19, 20, 21, 22...</i>

826
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:06,414
<i>23, 24, 25...</i>

827
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:08,537
<i>26, 27, 28...</i>

828
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,586
29...

829
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,754
30, 31, 32, 33...

830
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:18,176
34, 35.

831
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:21,096
Thirty-fifth one flew.

832
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,685
Thirty-five on one cypress top.

833
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:36,733
Listen to that sound, that -

834
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,953
Hear that sound?

835
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,869
<i>Getting in and out of trees?</i>

836
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,243
<i>That "flop-flop" sound?</i>

837
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:54,500
Mm, that sound will sure
mistake you for turkeys.

838
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:58,170
<i>Listen.</i>

839
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:08,435
Hear that "flop-flop"?
Limbs breaking.

840
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:12,480
<i>Hear that good flop then?</i>

841
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:15,487
<i>Listening to that
gives me the turkey fever.</i>

842
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,075
<i>Mm-mm!</i>

843
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:27,496
<i>I wish there were as many turkeys
as there are buzzards.</i>
