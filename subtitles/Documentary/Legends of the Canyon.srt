1
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:49,936
Some people hear their own
inner voices...

2
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:51,670
with great clearness...

3
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:54,837
and they live
by what they hear.

4
00:00:54,907 --> 00:00:57,875
Such people become crazy...

5
00:00:57,948 --> 00:01:00,119
or they become legends.

6
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:11,765
Tristan Ludlow wasborn
in the Moon of the Falling Leaves.

7
00:01:11,836 --> 00:01:14,258
It was a terrible winter.

8
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:19,121
His mother almost died
bringing him into this world.

9
00:01:22,845 --> 00:01:26,522
His father, the Colonel,
brought him to me.

10
00:01:26,589 --> 00:01:31,542
I wrapped him in a bear skin
and held him all that night.

11
00:01:33,949 --> 00:01:35,804
As he grew into a man...

12
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:39,164
I taught him the great joy
of the kill...

13
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,880
when the hunter
cuts out its warm heart

14
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:44,819
and hold sit in his hands...

15
00:01:44,893 --> 00:01:47,740
setting its spirit free.

16
00:01:49,726 --> 00:01:52,115
Colonel Ludlow had three sons...

17
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,605
but Tristan was his favorite.

18
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:57,620
I had had sons too.

19
00:01:59,422 --> 00:02:01,277
But they were gone now...

20
00:02:01,342 --> 00:02:02,716
forever.

21
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,998
It was a very bad time.

22
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:10,300
The Colonel had tried
to help the People...

23
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:15,772
but it was no use.

24
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:19,352
So he decided
to go his own way.

25
00:02:21,695 --> 00:02:25,688
He wanted to lose the madness
over the mountains, he said...

26
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,767
and begin again.

27
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:37,919
''Lose the madness, ''he said.

28
00:02:37,984 --> 00:02:40,667
And so we lived for many years...

29
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:42,841
and the boys grew strong.

30
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:55,003
Alfred was the older brother...

31
00:02:55,073 --> 00:02:57,015
old even for his years.

32
00:02:58,528 --> 00:03:01,376
Samuel was the youngest.

33
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,637
There was nothing these brothers
would not do for him.

34
00:03:04,705 --> 00:03:07,039
They watched over him
like a treasure.

35
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:10,111
One year--

36
00:03:10,177 --> 00:03:13,691
I am an old man
and cannot remember the year.

37
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:16,631
But it was the Moon
of the Red Grass...

38
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:19,291
when Isabel Ludlow,
their mother...

39
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:21,434
went away for the winter.

40
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:25,302
She said the winters
were too cruel for her.

41
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:28,095
She said she was afraid
of the bears.

42
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,421
She was a strange woman anyway.

43
00:03:45,154 --> 00:03:48,383
That spring, though,
she did not return.

44
00:03:49,923 --> 00:03:54,298
And, after that,
she did not come much to see us.

45
00:03:55,491 --> 00:03:58,339
Alfred wrote her many letters...

46
00:03:58,403 --> 00:04:01,698
but Tristan refused
to speak of her.

47
00:04:01,764 --> 00:04:04,960
His world was here with me.

48
00:04:07,812 --> 00:04:12,154
Every warrior hopes a good death
will find him...

49
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:14,170
but Tristan couldn't wait.

50
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:17,371
He went looking for his.

51
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,167
Tristan!

52
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,614
Here.

53
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,640
- Was it a bear?
- Yes, sir.

54
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,207
- Was it a bear?
- Yes, sir.

55
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,708
- Can you breathe?
- Yes.

56
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:45,792
Move your hand.
Take it away.

57
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,328
You're a stupid,
half-brained jackass.

58
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,856
- Yes, sir.
- One Stab putyou up to this?

59
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:57,667
You deserve to be dead.

60
00:05:57,736 --> 00:05:59,743
God knows how you've
lived so long.

61
00:05:59,816 --> 00:06:01,671
It'll be all right, son.

62
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:22,657
Ihave these letters...

63
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,599
many letters.

64
00:06:25,674 --> 00:06:27,976
Read them.

65
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:29,897
They are from all of them.

66
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:32,582
Ludlow...

67
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:34,308
Isabel...

68
00:06:34,378 --> 00:06:36,166
Samuel...

69
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:37,828
the whole family...

70
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:40,549
the whole story.

71
00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:43,586
It is all written here.

72
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:47,811
April 13, 1913.

73
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:49,606
Dear Isabel:

74
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:53,472
I am not fool enough to try
to reorder a life already lived...

75
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:57,802
but I fear I have not done well raising
our sons alone in this wild place.

76
00:06:59,307 --> 00:07:01,195
What did I know of children?

77
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,747
I was trained to lead men.

78
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,958
This is infinitely harder.

79
00:07:06,988 --> 00:07:08,362
Dear William:

80
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:12,005
You take too much responsibility
on yourself, as always.

81
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:14,596
Our sons are finding their own paths.

82
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:17,799
They are willful, certainly,
but then...

83
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:20,902
who are you and I
to complain of willfulness?

84
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:23,306
As for Samuel,
I have big news.

85
00:07:23,373 --> 00:07:25,227
At a Harvard tea
for Amy Lowell...

86
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:29,035
he met and instantly loved
Miss Susannah Finncannon.

87
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,784
I know it will
surprise you greatly...

88
00:07:31,853 --> 00:07:34,504
but they are engaged.

89
00:07:34,573 --> 00:07:38,086
He will bring her to Montana
this summer to meet his brothers...

90
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,531
and you.

91
00:07:39,597 --> 00:07:42,248
So, William,
please behave yourself...

92
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:46,180
and be as charming
as only you can be.

93
00:07:49,294 --> 00:07:50,668
There he is.

94
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:56,964
- How the hell are you?
- Good. And you?

95
00:07:59,694 --> 00:08:02,116
- Samuel. Good to see you, boy.
- Father, how are you?

96
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,619
- Good to see you.
- Hello.

97
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,980
This is my fiancee, Susannah.

98
00:08:11,054 --> 00:08:13,258
- Hello.
- Miss Finncannon.

99
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:17,547
- Nice to meet you.
- It's an honor.

100
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:21,095
- This is Alfred.
- How do you do?

101
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,934
- Here's your dog, miss.
- Thank you.

102
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:28,716
- It's a horse.
- That's a strange-looking animal.

103
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:31,653
This is Finn.
He's a champion.

104
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:34,695
You like exotic-looking dogs then,
Miss Finncannon?

105
00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:36,556
Very much, Mr. Ludlow.

106
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:40,394
- Please call me Susannah.
- All right.

107
00:08:40,464 --> 00:08:42,853
- He's just plain old Alfred.
- Shut up.

108
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,038
- Where's Tristan?
- He's off somewhere. You know him.

109
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:51,461
He'll welcome you home tonight
or I'll know the reason why.

110
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,818
Miss Finncannon, please.
Did you have a good journey?

111
00:09:01,297 --> 00:09:03,948
She is such a lovely creature.

112
00:09:04,017 --> 00:09:05,872
But I fear the loss
of her parents...

113
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:09,549
has given her
a certain fragility.

114
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:12,432
I think she feels very alone
in the world.

115
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,750
But she has found a new family now,
hasn't she?

116
00:09:16,817 --> 00:09:19,599
The German military is ready
to use chaos in Croatia...

117
00:09:19,665 --> 00:09:23,626
to justify actions that could plunge
the entire civilized world into--

118
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:27,440
The word ''civilized'' has no place
in discussing the affairs of this world.

119
00:09:29,138 --> 00:09:32,433
Mother told us of your sympathy
for the social reformers.

120
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:36,169
You make it sound like a disease.

121
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,868
No, I'm in agreement.

122
00:09:37,938 --> 00:09:41,353
You mother told me all about One Stab.
She says he was a great warrior.

123
00:09:41,426 --> 00:09:42,800
Yes.

124
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:45,255
He has a bag of scalps
to prove it.

125
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,361
But don't worry.

126
00:09:48,435 --> 00:09:50,290
He's devoted to Father now.

127
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:52,013
Rather, they're devoted
to each other.

128
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,709
Can he speak English?

129
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:56,113
Stab, speak English?

130
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,474
He wouldn't lower himself
to speak English.

131
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:04,147
But watch out because
he understands it perfectly well.

132
00:10:05,907 --> 00:10:07,762
There's Tristan.

133
00:10:26,837 --> 00:10:28,942
- Don't they feed you?
- Not much.

134
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:38,382
- You smell.
- Miss me, did you?

135
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:40,308
- Still hung over?
- Still drunk.

136
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:46,836
Isn't she amazing?

137
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:48,690
So this is Tristan.

138
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:53,739
And does he speak English?

139
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:57,268
For God's sake.

140
00:11:08,822 --> 00:11:12,619
Miss Finncannon,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

141
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:15,345
I hope you and Ugly here...

142
00:11:15,414 --> 00:11:17,138
find every happiness together.

143
00:11:21,655 --> 00:11:25,845
Don't mind my brother. Your dog
has more breeding than he has.

144
00:11:48,344 --> 00:11:50,548
This is Mother's room.

145
00:11:50,616 --> 00:11:51,991
It's lovely.

146
00:11:55,544 --> 00:11:57,649
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Pet.
- And you, miss.

147
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,095
Thank you.

148
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:10,675
- Which one?
- It's this one.

149
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:17,304
Angelica Susannah.

150
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:49,942
Hello.

151
00:12:50,906 --> 00:12:52,564
You must be Isabel Two.

152
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:58,294
I've already metyour mother
and father.

153
00:12:59,963 --> 00:13:01,654
- How old are you?
- Thirteen.

154
00:13:05,691 --> 00:13:08,691
When I was 13,
I was sent away...

155
00:13:08,763 --> 00:13:10,673
to boarding school.

156
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:12,985
I hated it.

157
00:13:15,132 --> 00:13:16,342
May I help you?

158
00:13:20,188 --> 00:13:21,617
You're marrying Samuel.

159
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:23,252
That's right, I am.

160
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:25,212
I'm marrying Tristan.

161
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:29,467
We'll be sisters.

162
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:34,138
I see you two have met.

163
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:35,863
Isabel Two is letting me help.

164
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,676
Would you like a rest?
You must be exhausted.

165
00:13:39,741 --> 00:13:42,108
No, not at all.
This is so refreshing...

166
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:45,948
all this grandeur,
this unexpected...

167
00:13:46,013 --> 00:13:48,185
gift from God.

168
00:13:48,254 --> 00:13:52,378
It doesn't seem like much ofa gift
in a hard winter, I assure you.

169
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:54,772
Where's Samuel?

170
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:58,009
Inside. I could tell your father
wanted him all to himself.

171
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,810
- You're very generous.
- No, just happy.

172
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:08,757
Stop mooning over her
and come in here.

173
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,375
Samuel wants to know
about the calves from Cheyenne.

174
00:14:12,446 --> 00:14:13,853
Get in here.

175
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,878
Please excuse my father.

176
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:22,588
It makes him feel young and powerful
to treat us like we're idiot children.

177
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:31,899
For all His countless blessings,
may God's holy name be praised. Amen.

178
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:38,205
Tell Father what you were saying
about Vienna.

179
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:40,344
- What's that?
- It's the Kaiser.

180
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:43,957
He won't stop them
from annihilating Serbia.

181
00:14:44,032 --> 00:14:45,974
Let's not talk about war, please.

182
00:14:46,912 --> 00:14:50,043
Susannah hears
that England's mobilizing.

183
00:14:50,112 --> 00:14:52,697
We're stuck out here
while all this is going on.

184
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:56,347
- Thank God.
- You wouldn't want us to evade a duty.

185
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:59,264
- Wouldn't I?
- Father, with respect--

186
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:02,586
Please excuse me
for being late.

187
00:15:02,656 --> 00:15:05,559
I packed so carefully,
I couldn't find anything.

188
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:09,566
Thank you.

189
00:15:15,777 --> 00:15:18,941
Would you like some--

190
00:15:25,314 --> 00:15:28,663
As evening fell
a maiden stood

191
00:15:28,738 --> 00:15:32,153
At the edge of a wood

192
00:15:32,226 --> 00:15:35,455
In her hands lay the reins

193
00:15:35,522 --> 00:15:38,621
Of a stallion

194
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,217
And n'er I'd seen

195
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,112
A girl as fair

196
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:45,277
Heard a gentler voice any where

197
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:47,004
Whispered, alas

198
00:15:47,074 --> 00:15:48,569
She belonged

199
00:15:48,642 --> 00:15:51,098
Belonged to another

200
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:54,520
Another, forever

201
00:15:55,427 --> 00:15:57,631
Yes, she belonged to

202
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:00,928
The twilight and mist

203
00:16:03,747 --> 00:16:05,689
Dear Isabel:

204
00:16:05,763 --> 00:16:09,473
How strange to have a cultivated woman
in the house again...

205
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:11,612
and how intoxicating.

206
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:15,000
To have all three of my sons
under my roof again...

207
00:16:15,076 --> 00:16:18,272
fills me with such a deep,
quiet satisfaction...

208
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,511
that I thank God.

209
00:17:10,406 --> 00:17:12,261
There's a friend of yours.

210
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:23,621
A dollar says
he brings her back.

211
00:18:07,241 --> 00:18:09,924
Whoa.

212
00:18:11,977 --> 00:18:14,016
Easy.

213
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,879
You got it.

214
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:49,800
Nice work.

215
00:18:51,082 --> 00:18:53,090
You all look
like ice cream cones.

216
00:18:55,691 --> 00:18:57,185
I know you would have.

217
00:18:57,259 --> 00:19:00,008
Ready. Here we go.

218
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:11,973
Go easy on him, Susannah.

219
00:19:12,043 --> 00:19:13,766
Alfred, you take over.

220
00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:15,362
I must talk to Tristan.

221
00:19:15,435 --> 00:19:17,737
You've disgraced the Colonel's name.

222
00:19:19,244 --> 00:19:22,560
- Nice shiner.
- I hit her back.

223
00:19:30,188 --> 00:19:31,562
She's got me spinning.

224
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,221
I'll bet.

225
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:37,002
She's got these ideas
and theories, and she's so--

226
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:41,419
What?

227
00:19:41,485 --> 00:19:45,129
Nothing.
How'd you break the mare?

228
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:48,043
She's what?

229
00:19:50,701 --> 00:19:53,254
She's sort of passionate.

230
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,397
- She a virgin?
- Good Lord, Tristan.

231
00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:57,444
- You brought it up.
- Of course she is.

232
00:19:57,518 --> 00:19:59,078
Are you?

233
00:20:03,341 --> 00:20:06,505
- Yes, I am.
- Going to wait till you're married?

234
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:09,580
See, she says--

235
00:20:10,606 --> 00:20:12,548
Susannah thinks that--

236
00:20:15,342 --> 00:20:16,771
We won't wait.

237
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:20,676
And you're afraid
you won't meet her expectations?

238
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:23,465
I guess I am.

239
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:27,179
Sort of. I don't know.
Should I be?

240
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:29,352
Samuel, God bless you.

241
00:20:29,423 --> 00:20:32,205
You are good
at everything you try.

242
00:20:32,271 --> 00:20:33,897
I'm sure it will be the same
with fucking.

243
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:35,756
Tristan, really.

244
00:20:35,823 --> 00:20:38,540
- She's my future wife.
- You're not going to fuck her?

245
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:43,910
I'm planning to be with her.

246
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:45,609
I recommend fucking.

247
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,679
- You're impossible.
- You brought it up.

248
00:20:57,296 --> 00:20:58,670
My point!

249
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:23,695
Good morning,
Colonel Ludlow.

250
00:21:23,761 --> 00:21:26,249
Tristan's hunting.
He didn't do it.

251
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:28,874
You don't have to worry
about Tristan.

252
00:21:28,945 --> 00:21:32,622
Meet John T. and James O'Banion.
They own the mercantile store.

253
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:37,000
- Morning, James, John T., Sheriff.
- Morning, Alfred.

254
00:21:37,074 --> 00:21:41,580
We're looking for a man we heard
might be in this part of the country.

255
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,301
Name is Tom Cullen.
Here's a likeness.

256
00:21:47,602 --> 00:21:48,977
What did he do?

257
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:50,569
Do you recognize him?

258
00:21:52,403 --> 00:21:54,858
- Yeah, I recognize him.
- We got him.

259
00:21:54,931 --> 00:21:56,938
This fellow passed by here...

260
00:21:57,011 --> 00:21:59,018
maybe four or five years ago.

261
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:02,767
Did some work here
on his way to San Francisco.

262
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:04,907
He hoped to book passage
to Australia.

263
00:22:06,707 --> 00:22:08,398
Or Hong Kong.
I can't remember.

264
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:10,802
- Can you remember?
- Hong Kong.

265
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:17,805
- What is he wanted for?
- He--

266
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:19,883
That would be
ofa private nature.

267
00:22:19,956 --> 00:22:23,469
'' Private nature''?
You hold a public office, Sheriff.

268
00:22:25,684 --> 00:22:27,178
Gentlemen.

269
00:22:38,933 --> 00:22:41,322
''There came a low hiss,
a horrid sound...

270
00:22:41,396 --> 00:22:44,015
that made Rikki Tikki Tavi
jump back two clear feet.

271
00:22:44,085 --> 00:22:45,940
And then out of the grass...

272
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:48,820
rose up the head
and spread hood of Nag...

273
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:50,794
the big black cobra.''

274
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,396
I can read another story.

275
00:22:52,469 --> 00:22:55,251
The Germans broke through
at Armentieres.

276
00:22:55,317 --> 00:22:58,733
The British are trapped
in the Belgian low lands.

277
00:22:58,806 --> 00:23:01,588
- This paper is a week old!
- Calm down.

278
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:03,541
With my fluent German,
I could become an officer.

279
00:23:03,606 --> 00:23:06,094
And lead other boys to the slaughter
and be slaughtered yourself.

280
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:08,140
The men who served under you
worshipped you.

281
00:23:08,213 --> 00:23:09,904
They were all damn fools.

282
00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:12,211
This is a turning point
in history.

283
00:23:12,278 --> 00:23:13,652
- How can we--
- What?

284
00:23:13,718 --> 00:23:15,507
How can we not
be part of this?

285
00:23:15,574 --> 00:23:18,258
- You taught us--
- To think for yourselves.

286
00:23:18,326 --> 00:23:21,009
- And to defend what's ours.
- Yes, what is ours!

287
00:23:21,078 --> 00:23:23,445
We've already lost two cousins.

288
00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:26,860
Don't talk at me as though
I've never seen a war!

289
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,925
Not a war like this.

290
00:23:31,991 --> 00:23:36,399
They said that about the war
of secession and the Indian wars.

291
00:23:36,471 --> 00:23:39,537
They say it to sell newspapers.

292
00:23:39,607 --> 00:23:42,738
These are not the Indian wars.
We're fighting against naked aggression!

293
00:23:42,807 --> 00:23:45,426
There will be no more talk ofwars
in this house! Damn it!

294
00:23:48,568 --> 00:23:49,942
I'm sorry, Susannah.

295
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,415
I'm going to Canada to enlist.

296
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:02,318
I'm going with him.

297
00:24:13,689 --> 00:24:15,216
I'm sorry, my love.

298
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,231
I meant to tell you tonight.

299
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:20,501
I know you'll understand.
It's the only honorable thing to do.

300
00:24:32,057 --> 00:24:33,432
What's that?

301
00:24:33,498 --> 00:24:35,832
It's a book my father wrote...

302
00:24:37,562 --> 00:24:41,359
to try to convince the government
to alter their policies...

303
00:24:41,434 --> 00:24:43,573
towards the Indians
in the Dakotas.

304
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:48,851
Samuel won't change his mind.

305
00:24:48,922 --> 00:24:50,296
Change it for him.

306
00:24:59,355 --> 00:25:01,210
What happened between them?

307
00:25:02,971 --> 00:25:04,825
Father says
she never liked it here.

308
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:10,323
I think they loved mostly the idea
of each other.

309
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,426
Don't let him go.

310
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,188
I'll take care of him.

311
00:26:25,982 --> 00:26:29,244
October 14, 1914.

312
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:31,002
My dearIsabel.:

313
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:33,438
Today our sons are leaving home...

314
00:26:33,503 --> 00:26:36,951
to defend an England
they have never seen.

315
00:26:37,023 --> 00:26:39,707
I am unable to stop them.

316
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:50,013
I have tried to shelter our sons
from all the madness...

317
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,015
and now they go to seek it.

318
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:44,896
Be careful.

319
00:28:07,427 --> 00:28:08,921
You don't have to go.

320
00:28:55,877 --> 00:28:57,252
Good-bye.

321
00:28:58,982 --> 00:29:01,022
Don't worry, Father.

322
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:02,468
Take care.

323
00:29:09,797 --> 00:29:12,186
I'll bring you
the Kaiser's helmet.

324
00:29:12,262 --> 00:29:15,110
Bring yourself back.
That would please me more.

325
00:29:16,198 --> 00:29:18,053
Yes, sir.

326
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:38,046
- Take care of Samuel.
- I will.

327
00:30:32,585 --> 00:30:34,822
Colonel Ludlow told me:

328
00:30:34,889 --> 00:30:37,671
''Ride with them to Calgary.

329
00:30:37,738 --> 00:30:40,356
Bring back the horses. ''

330
00:30:40,426 --> 00:30:42,979
''Damn fools, ''he called them.

331
00:30:45,418 --> 00:30:48,582
The Colonel
would not have his sons...

332
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,650
ride off to war
on old nags...

333
00:30:51,722 --> 00:30:54,177
damn fools or not.

334
00:31:10,795 --> 00:31:12,170
Let's join them.

335
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:15,050
Bring your plate.

336
00:31:18,955 --> 00:31:20,329
He'll be back.

337
00:31:21,356 --> 00:31:23,527
May we join you?
Sit down.

338
00:31:24,555 --> 00:31:26,727
Feeling lonely in there.

339
00:31:26,796 --> 00:31:28,170
Sit here.

340
00:31:30,796 --> 00:31:32,203
What's her name, Two?

341
00:31:32,268 --> 00:31:35,203
Lady. Tristan's Lady.

342
00:31:35,276 --> 00:31:38,026
In the story,
Tristan's lady was Isolde.

343
00:31:38,093 --> 00:31:40,744
- Do you know who Isolde was?
- No.

344
00:31:42,637 --> 00:31:45,484
Your daughter needs an education.

345
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:50,404
She can read and write, Colonel.
School might be awkward for her.

346
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:53,957
- I'll teach her myself.
- May I help?

347
00:31:54,029 --> 00:31:58,252
Yeah. I'll teach her
history and mathematics.

348
00:31:58,317 --> 00:32:02,824
With your permission, Decker,
and yours, Pet.

349
00:32:02,894 --> 00:32:04,071
What do you think?

350
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:12,521
What will she do
with all this education?

351
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,590
She'll live a richer,
fuller life, of course.

352
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,725
She's a half-breed.

353
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:20,489
Not in this house.

354
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:23,755
- Tristan calls me a half-breed.
- He does?

355
00:32:23,823 --> 00:32:26,157
He says I'm halfgopher
and halfhawk.

356
00:32:32,495 --> 00:32:36,107
- After her chores.
- Yeah.

357
00:32:36,175 --> 00:32:38,030
- To us all.
- To you, sir.

358
00:32:38,095 --> 00:32:40,942
- And you, miss.
- And to the boys.

359
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,407
Get back to your unit.

360
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,488
Those boys are boring.

361
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,699
I'd rather have you
watching my back.

362
00:33:19,441 --> 00:33:20,815
Go, mate.

363
00:33:41,362 --> 00:33:43,696
February 3, 1915.

364
00:33:44,721 --> 00:33:46,248
Dear Susannah:

365
00:33:46,322 --> 00:33:48,973
The horror of this place
is indescribable.

366
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,548
Nothing is
as I thought it would be.

367
00:33:53,618 --> 00:33:56,487
Keep your distance!
Keep your spacing!

368
00:33:56,562 --> 00:33:59,596
Tonight, as I prayed for the souls
of those who died so terribly...

369
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:01,292
yet so bravely...

370
00:34:01,362 --> 00:34:04,232
I admit that I also prayed
for personal glory.

371
00:34:04,307 --> 00:34:07,755
Is that wrong to want
to distinguish myself gloriously...

372
00:34:07,827 --> 00:34:09,965
in combatas my father did?

373
00:34:10,035 --> 00:34:12,905
Tristan and Alfred
watch over me so carefully...

374
00:34:12,979 --> 00:34:14,637
Imay never get the opportunity.

375
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,460
Charge!

376
00:34:38,484 --> 00:34:40,556
Goddamn it!

377
00:34:41,588 --> 00:34:43,443
- Where are you hit?
- It's just a scratch.

378
00:34:48,404 --> 00:34:50,193
Susannah, I see now...

379
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,577
not that my father was right,
but that I was naive.

380
00:34:53,653 --> 00:34:56,522
- Let me up, damn it!
- Stay down!

381
00:34:57,557 --> 00:34:59,117
Fall back!

382
00:34:59,189 --> 00:35:01,262
Still, we place our bodies
in God's keeping.

383
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,667
We go into battle honorably...

384
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:05,195
full of confidence...

385
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,025
with His name on our lips.

386
00:35:07,093 --> 00:35:09,482
- We're pinned here.
- We'll wait.

387
00:35:23,062 --> 00:35:25,615
- Give him a hand.
- Help him down.

388
00:35:56,503 --> 00:35:57,932
Goddamn.

389
00:36:03,768 --> 00:36:07,380
Susannah:
I try to guard against despair...

390
00:36:07,448 --> 00:36:12,118
but there are moments when it seems
that all human decency is broken down.

391
00:36:12,184 --> 00:36:14,257
Alfred will recover
from his wounds...

392
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:17,777
but he and Tristan seem
to have drifted apart, or worse.

393
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:20,336
I cannot understand it.

394
00:36:20,408 --> 00:36:22,580
I miss you more
than you can imagine.

395
00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:27,118
You are all that is clean
and cool and pure.

396
00:36:28,409 --> 00:36:30,897
I close my eyes
and think of you.

397
00:36:30,969 --> 00:36:35,541
I now regret that we listened
to everyone and waited to marry.

398
00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:38,424
Even more, I regret that I left
before we could be together...

399
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:40,496
as we planned, my beloved.

400
00:36:42,489 --> 00:36:45,588
Please stay on at the ranch
and wait for me.

401
00:36:45,658 --> 00:36:47,862
Don't let Father worry.

402
00:36:49,049 --> 00:36:51,351
I know God's mercy
will protect me...

403
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:52,945
aided considerably
by Tristan...

404
00:36:53,018 --> 00:36:55,222
who seems to be in France
less to fight the Germans...

405
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:57,298
than to act
as my nursemaid.

406
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,683
Be well, my love.

407
00:37:01,754 --> 00:37:03,697
Your own, Samuel.

408
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:07,989
Captain needs me to translate
this before tonight's reconnaissance.

409
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:10,841
- Alfred will want to see you.
- I'll be there.

410
00:37:10,907 --> 00:37:12,882
- Yeah?
- Go on.

411
00:37:34,492 --> 00:37:36,499
Where's Samuel?

412
00:37:36,572 --> 00:37:38,579
He's translating.
He'll be here.

413
00:37:38,652 --> 00:37:40,824
Boy, that's a good one.

414
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:43,259
- Vino?
- Put that away.

415
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,064
- They said you'll get a medal.
- Yes.

416
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:54,581
- They're sending me home.
- I'm glad for you.

417
00:37:54,653 --> 00:37:56,791
I'm an officer.
I belong with my men.

418
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,170
Horseshit.

419
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:00,822
What's left of them.

420
00:38:00,893 --> 00:38:03,708
MacKenzie was just brought in.
His leg's turned bad.

421
00:38:03,774 --> 00:38:05,885
- He said--
- What?

422
00:38:05,885 --> 00:38:06,868
- He said--
- What?

423
00:38:08,093 --> 00:38:09,522
What is it?

424
00:38:09,597 --> 00:38:13,110
He said your brother volunteered
to take his place...

425
00:38:13,181 --> 00:38:15,069
on the reconnaissance
with the captain.

426
00:38:15,134 --> 00:38:18,167
Goddamn it!
I told you to stay with him!

427
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:05,279
- I'm here!
- Where? I can't see.

428
00:41:07,205 --> 00:41:08,798
I can't move!

429
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:14,431
I'm coming!

430
00:41:38,823 --> 00:41:41,092
I got you now.

431
00:41:42,983 --> 00:41:45,154
You're doing good.

432
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:47,878
We're going home.

433
00:42:20,009 --> 00:42:21,798
God, no!

434
00:43:03,051 --> 00:43:06,117
Goddamn you, God!

435
00:45:09,072 --> 00:45:10,599
Tristan, it's me.

436
00:45:15,824 --> 00:45:19,240
March 20, 1915.

437
00:45:19,312 --> 00:45:21,647
Dear Father and Susannah.:

438
00:45:21,712 --> 00:45:26,120
I am being discharged from the Army,
but I cannot come home yet.

439
00:45:26,193 --> 00:45:28,681
I will ask Grand father Ludlow
in Cornwall...

440
00:45:28,753 --> 00:45:30,891
to let me join him at sea.

441
00:45:32,337 --> 00:45:34,922
As for ou rbeloved Samuel...

442
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:37,360
all I can send home
is his heart.

443
00:45:37,426 --> 00:45:39,281
Alfred will bring it back.

444
00:45:41,233 --> 00:45:44,365
He should be buried
up in the box canyon...

445
00:45:44,434 --> 00:45:46,605
where he used
to draw the birds.

446
00:45:47,633 --> 00:45:50,415
Your son, Tristan.

447
00:46:06,354 --> 00:46:06,706
He certainly was the best
of all of us, wasn't he?

448
00:46:06,706 --> 00:46:10,285
He certainly was the best
of all of us, wasn't he?

449
00:46:16,243 --> 00:46:17,617
Good night.

450
00:46:32,755 --> 00:46:35,144
What you saw
before Samuel left--

451
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:38,923
Please, don't--

452
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,851
No, I want to.

453
00:46:47,156 --> 00:46:48,716
It is Samuel I loved.

454
00:46:50,996 --> 00:46:52,971
All right.

455
00:46:58,484 --> 00:47:00,656
Tristan will be back someday.

456
00:47:04,437 --> 00:47:05,866
Your father will be pleased.

457
00:47:12,277 --> 00:47:16,205
Susannah was tore turn to Boston
on the morning train...

458
00:47:16,277 --> 00:47:18,612
but anorther blew
for three days...

459
00:47:18,678 --> 00:47:20,685
and drifted over the tracks.

460
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:25,973
The Colonel insisted
she stay on until spring.

461
00:47:26,998 --> 00:47:30,511
The house was too empty,
he said.

462
00:47:30,582 --> 00:47:33,965
This was still her home,
he told her.

463
00:47:36,919 --> 00:47:39,253
He should have let her go.

464
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:42,963
But how could he have known
what would happen?

465
00:47:47,638 --> 00:47:50,257
She was not to blame.

466
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:53,971
She was like the water
that freezes in the rock...

467
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:56,211
and split sit apart.

468
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,135
It was no more her fault
than it is the fault of the water...

469
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:04,720
when the rock shatters.

470
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,015
You know how much I--

471
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,247
You know how much
I loved Samuel.

472
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:24,753
And I think you know--

473
00:48:33,241 --> 00:48:35,892
Out of respect for him,
I wanted to say it here.

474
00:48:35,961 --> 00:48:38,612
I think you know that...

475
00:48:41,433 --> 00:48:42,840
I'm in love with you.

476
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:48,216
From the first moment
I saw you...

477
00:48:48,281 --> 00:48:50,289
like in a novel.

478
00:48:56,282 --> 00:49:01,585
That's my mother's overblown
romantic imagination coming out in me.

479
00:49:09,019 --> 00:49:11,888
You're not making this
very easy for me.

480
00:49:13,082 --> 00:49:14,708
Sorry.

481
00:49:15,962 --> 00:49:19,825
Is there any hope
that you could learn to love me?

482
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:24,375
Not the way you love Samuel,
of course...

483
00:49:24,444 --> 00:49:28,218
but enough to--

484
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:33,973
We could make a life together.

485
00:49:35,163 --> 00:49:36,538
A happy life.

486
00:49:41,084 --> 00:49:42,709
I don't think so.

487
00:49:47,004 --> 00:49:50,582
Sounds like you're not sure, though.
Maybe there's a chance?

488
00:49:56,925 --> 00:50:01,333
- What?
- I can only cause you pain, Alfred.

489
00:50:03,645 --> 00:50:06,100
Why not let me
be the judge of that?

490
00:50:15,965 --> 00:50:18,300
I didn't break it,
but I can fix it.

491
00:50:18,365 --> 00:50:21,661
I can put the damn wheel back on
and take it off myself.

492
00:50:21,726 --> 00:50:23,581
Go take a nap.

493
00:50:35,646 --> 00:50:37,718
- What?
- Look!

494
00:51:22,048 --> 00:51:24,220
I'm going into town if--

495
00:52:05,475 --> 00:52:07,329
Welcome home, son.

496
00:53:18,053 --> 00:53:21,021
I couldn't save him.

497
00:53:21,093 --> 00:53:23,428
Of course you couldn't.

498
00:53:34,374 --> 00:53:35,748
It's all right.

499
00:54:03,656 --> 00:54:05,990
Have a nice ride today?

500
00:54:17,576 --> 00:54:19,431
Excuse me, Father.

501
00:54:39,689 --> 00:54:41,184
Tristan, please.

502
00:55:44,779 --> 00:55:47,747
When are you planning
to be married?

503
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,511
Good morning.

504
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,129
Damn you.

505
00:55:56,204 --> 00:55:58,506
You will marry her.

506
00:55:59,533 --> 00:56:02,468
- Make an honest woman of her?
- Yes!

507
00:56:04,621 --> 00:56:06,531
God damn you to hell.

508
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:10,690
Yes, I will marry her,
if she'll have me.

509
00:56:10,765 --> 00:56:12,674
If she'll have you?

510
00:56:16,621 --> 00:56:18,476
Do you love her?

511
00:56:20,621 --> 00:56:23,621
Or did you seduce her
just to spite me?

512
00:56:23,693 --> 00:56:25,220
That's not what I did.

513
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:29,546
- What about Samuel?
- What?

514
00:56:29,614 --> 00:56:31,239
You tell me about Samuel.

515
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:34,245
We all loved Samuel.
Samuel is dead.

516
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:35,878
How convenient for you.

517
00:56:37,486 --> 00:56:40,355
Because you love her,
I will forgive you for that.

518
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:43,464
Once. You say that again,
and we're not brothers.

519
00:56:52,623 --> 00:56:54,990
You know you can't make her happy.

520
00:56:55,055 --> 00:56:56,878
I'm gonna try.

521
00:56:59,343 --> 00:57:00,870
You will fail.

522
00:57:14,704 --> 00:57:16,559
I'll be leaving today.

523
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:28,969
I wish you both all the best.

524
00:57:37,457 --> 00:57:39,312
- Good-bye, son.
- Wish me luck.

525
00:57:39,377 --> 00:57:40,752
Good luck.

526
00:58:07,986 --> 00:58:10,953
September 7, 1915.

527
00:58:11,026 --> 00:58:12,881
Dearest Mother.:

528
00:58:12,946 --> 00:58:17,354
I think I may have found
my place in this world.

529
00:58:17,426 --> 00:58:21,682
Helena is a city
turned modern overnight...

530
00:58:21,747 --> 00:58:24,594
bursting with all the energy
and vitality...

531
00:58:24,659 --> 00:58:26,633
of our times.

532
00:58:26,707 --> 00:58:28,911
I feel alive here.

533
00:58:36,947 --> 00:58:38,671
There is much opportunity
for anyone...

534
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:41,675
who dedicates himself
to his labors.

535
00:58:41,748 --> 00:58:45,774
Already, I have acquired a reputation
for honesty and fair dealing...

536
00:58:45,844 --> 00:58:50,994
and I am pleased to call some of
Helena's most influential citizens...

537
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,035
my friends.

538
00:58:53,108 --> 00:58:57,036
They are determined to see
this city grow, as am I.

539
00:58:57,108 --> 00:58:59,377
We're proud of you.

540
00:59:01,429 --> 00:59:04,724
Mother, thank you
for your kind letter.

541
00:59:04,789 --> 00:59:06,250
You knew my hopes.

542
00:59:06,325 --> 00:59:10,798
That you understand my disappointment
is a great comfort to me.

543
00:59:12,309 --> 00:59:15,921
Everynight I pray for the grace
to forgive Tristan.

544
00:59:16,949 --> 00:59:18,804
I know you understand.

545
00:59:18,869 --> 00:59:21,203
Your loving son, Alfred.

546
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:16,344
Quit it!

547
01:00:16,344 --> 01:00:17,838
Quit it!

548
01:00:33,433 --> 01:00:34,807
Goddamn it!

549
01:01:10,234 --> 01:01:14,063
If we have a boy,
I'd like to call him Samuel.

550
01:01:15,354 --> 01:01:18,005
And if it's a girl, Isabel.

551
01:01:20,954 --> 01:01:23,605
I'll still love you.

552
01:01:23,674 --> 01:01:27,122
You'll tolerate me
because of how much I love you.

553
01:01:40,636 --> 01:01:42,010
Nothing.

554
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:57,690
I heard from your mother.

555
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:01,685
She says Alfred has hooked up
with those damn O'Banion brothers.

556
01:02:01,757 --> 01:02:07,321
- He's doing well.
- Alfred will do well wherever he is.

557
01:02:07,388 --> 01:02:10,804
- Except here with us.
- That's my fault.

558
01:02:10,877 --> 01:02:14,422
- I didn't say that.
- Couldn't save Samuel either, could I?

559
01:02:14,493 --> 01:02:17,461
Don't you dare say that.
That was in God's hands.

560
01:02:19,517 --> 01:02:20,946
Was it?

561
01:02:23,038 --> 01:02:26,650
Colonel! Lost a couple calves
near Camas Canyon.

562
01:02:26,718 --> 01:02:28,954
- Might be a grizzly.
- My grizzly?

563
01:02:43,999 --> 01:02:46,966
- You take him, Tristan.
- Damn right I will.

564
01:03:05,503 --> 01:03:10,260
I don't know why Tristan
did not kill that damn old bear.

565
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:12,573
The Old Ones say:

566
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,582
''When a man and an animal...

567
01:03:14,656 --> 01:03:16,663
have spilled each other's blood...

568
01:03:16,736 --> 01:03:18,972
they become one. ''

569
01:03:20,448 --> 01:03:23,066
I said four beers,
Mr. Sachtleben.

570
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:25,045
And I said no Indians.

571
01:03:27,776 --> 01:03:31,606
- He's quite civilized, I assure you.
- Yeah?

572
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,535
- Give him a beer.
- Stay out of it.

573
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,088
- My father said four.
- He heard me.

574
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,048
We're about to reach an understanding.

575
01:03:38,113 --> 01:03:40,252
Just give him a goddamn beer!

576
01:03:40,321 --> 01:03:42,972
Stay out of it!

577
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:45,856
Damn you.
You're a damn fool.

578
01:03:45,921 --> 01:03:48,506
You're spoiling for a fight
with a man who outweighs you.

579
01:03:48,577 --> 01:03:51,774
As we speak, he's searching
for some kind of a weapon.

580
01:03:51,841 --> 01:03:53,303
Isn't that right?

581
01:03:53,378 --> 01:03:56,574
To split your stupid skull
and kill you and good riddance.

582
01:03:56,641 --> 01:03:58,016
Leave it!

583
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:02,337
- Yes, sir?
- I want four beers, now.

584
01:04:04,642 --> 01:04:08,319
The lousy owner says
he doesn't want to serve Indians.

585
01:04:12,322 --> 01:04:13,981
Get back.

586
01:04:15,138 --> 01:04:17,211
Do you see this man?

587
01:04:17,283 --> 01:04:21,374
Do you?
His name is One Stab.

588
01:04:21,442 --> 01:04:25,305
He's a venerated Cree elder and has
counted coup on hundreds of his enemies.

589
01:04:25,378 --> 01:04:28,248
He's our friend.
He's thirsty.

590
01:04:54,084 --> 01:04:59,299
I think it was the bear's voice
he heard deep inside him...

591
01:04:59,365 --> 01:05:03,107
growling low
of dark, secret places.

592
01:06:43,849 --> 01:06:46,664
Were you going to say good-bye?

593
01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:59,203
How long will you be gone?

594
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:03,176
Not long.
A few months.

595
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:11,298
I can make it better for you.

596
01:07:17,611 --> 01:07:19,137
If we'd had a child...

597
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:25,574
or if I were pregnant,
would you still go?

598
01:07:28,490 --> 01:07:29,865
Yes.

599
01:07:32,779 --> 01:07:34,667
Just give me a chance.

600
01:07:34,731 --> 01:07:36,106
Don't do that.

601
01:07:42,603 --> 01:07:44,458
Look at me.

602
01:07:49,132 --> 01:07:51,303
Please, look at me.

603
01:08:03,693 --> 01:08:05,548
I'll wait for you.

604
01:08:07,212 --> 01:08:09,067
However long it takes.

605
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:16,518
I'll wait for you forever.

606
01:08:35,214 --> 01:08:37,548
Will he come back?

607
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:38,988
I don't know.

608
01:08:45,614 --> 01:08:47,818
Stab says yes.

609
01:09:26,576 --> 01:09:28,910
April 20, 1918.

610
01:09:28,976 --> 01:09:30,831
Dear Tristan:

611
01:09:30,896 --> 01:09:33,864
It has been months now,
and still no word.

612
01:09:35,697 --> 01:09:37,387
The only sign
that you are alive...

613
01:09:37,456 --> 01:09:42,028
is a tattered parcel that arrived today
from New Guinea...

614
01:09:42,096 --> 01:09:43,623
covered with strange writing...

615
01:09:43,697 --> 01:09:47,145
and containing what appears to be
an ative bracelet.

616
01:09:48,465 --> 01:09:50,832
Meant for me, I presume.

617
01:09:50,897 --> 01:09:52,752
But perhaps not.

618
01:09:54,162 --> 01:09:57,544
Do you still care to know
what is happening here?

619
01:09:57,617 --> 01:10:00,268
Cattle prices continue to fall...

620
01:10:00,337 --> 01:10:02,509
and winter seems never ending.

621
01:10:06,002 --> 01:10:07,857
Why don't you write?

622
01:10:09,842 --> 01:10:12,427
Are you afraid to tell me
you're never coming back?

623
01:10:16,947 --> 01:10:18,856
Alfred continues to do well.

624
01:10:20,658 --> 01:10:24,401
His business has expanded to include
financial concerns in Chicago...

625
01:10:24,467 --> 01:10:25,841
and Washington.

626
01:10:25,906 --> 01:10:27,761
I don't pretend to understand.

627
01:10:27,827 --> 01:10:30,860
He wants us to send Isabel Two
to boarding school in Chicago...

628
01:10:30,931 --> 01:10:33,386
but she adamantly refuses
to leave the ranch.

629
01:10:33,459 --> 01:10:36,110
I think she, too,
is waiting for you.

630
01:10:37,619 --> 01:10:40,237
I have now here
to send this letter...

631
01:10:41,459 --> 01:10:44,274
and no reason to believe
you wish to receive it.

632
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,387
I write it only for myself.

633
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:59,530
I will hide it away with all the things
left unsaid and undone...

634
01:10:59,604 --> 01:11:01,459
between us.

635
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:11,661
December 12, 1919.

636
01:11:11,732 --> 01:11:13,620
Dear Susannah:

637
01:11:14,741 --> 01:11:17,327
I have become a hunter.

638
01:11:22,293 --> 01:11:26,254
Tell Stab there are creatures here
that cannot even be found in books.

639
01:11:29,781 --> 01:11:32,237
I have killed them all.

640
01:11:52,662 --> 01:11:55,150
All we had is dead.

641
01:11:55,223 --> 01:11:56,750
As I am dead.

642
01:11:58,039 --> 01:11:59,697
Marry another.

643
01:12:14,264 --> 01:12:16,915
Colonel, it looks like
we've got company.

644
01:12:36,824 --> 01:12:39,956
- I have come to ask for your blessing.
- My blessing?

645
01:12:40,025 --> 01:12:42,261
You see, these gentlemen and--

646
01:12:42,328 --> 01:12:45,078
And a great many others,
I might add.

647
01:12:45,145 --> 01:12:48,113
They're urging me
to run for office.

648
01:12:48,185 --> 01:12:50,606
- What office?
- The United States Congress.

649
01:12:50,681 --> 01:12:52,983
That's how highly
we think of your son.

650
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:03,409
And what do you gentlemen
hope to get out of this?

651
01:13:06,266 --> 01:13:07,957
I beg your pardon?

652
01:13:08,026 --> 01:13:11,321
I've spoken plain English, sir.
What do you want for yourselves?

653
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,931
Father, I don't think
that these gentlemen--

654
01:13:15,002 --> 01:13:17,905
Did you ask that question
or do you believe these gentlemen...

655
01:13:17,978 --> 01:13:21,077
would back you out of patriotic duty
and your inestimable worth?

656
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:24,048
You forget yourself, Father.
I am no longer a child.

657
01:13:24,122 --> 01:13:26,130
Colonel, the Congress--

658
01:13:26,203 --> 01:13:29,269
Congress is government, sir.
I worked for the government once.

659
01:13:29,339 --> 01:13:30,713
The issues that we--

660
01:13:30,779 --> 01:13:34,903
Indians! Indians were
the issue in those days.

661
01:13:36,347 --> 01:13:38,354
There is nothing as grotesque...

662
01:13:38,427 --> 01:13:40,915
as the meeting of a child
with a bullet...

663
01:13:40,987 --> 01:13:43,704
or an entire village slaughtered
while sleeping.

664
01:13:43,771 --> 01:13:46,771
That was the government's resolution
of that particular issue.

665
01:13:46,844 --> 01:13:50,073
I've seen nothing since then
to persuade me it's gained...

666
01:13:50,139 --> 01:13:52,506
in wisdom, common sense
or humanity.

667
01:13:54,748 --> 01:14:00,182
Gentlemen, my father, for whom
I have the deepest respect...

668
01:14:00,252 --> 01:14:05,238
says that the government
has neither wisdom nor humanity.

669
01:14:05,308 --> 01:14:09,498
I will then consider it
my absolute duty as my father's son...

670
01:14:09,565 --> 01:14:14,584
to bring both wisdom and humanity
to the United States Congress.

671
01:14:16,573 --> 01:14:20,118
I thank you for your blessing.
Gentlemen.

672
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:37,085
- Gentlemen, wait for me in the cars.
- Yes. Certainly.

673
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:53,373
Are you all right?
What's wrong?

674
01:15:10,112 --> 01:15:15,480
I don't know what to say.
Tristan's always been wild.

675
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:20,668
- You love him for that.
- Do I?

676
01:15:24,032 --> 01:15:25,919
I suppose I do.

677
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:29,273
He does love you.

678
01:15:34,848 --> 01:15:36,670
She's to be your brother's wife.

679
01:15:40,065 --> 01:15:44,288
Yes, though you better
remind him of that fact.

680
01:15:44,353 --> 01:15:45,880
He's not here
to defend himself.

681
01:15:45,953 --> 01:15:50,208
No, but I see you are here
to defend him and what is his...

682
01:15:50,273 --> 01:15:54,365
even though
he's abandoned her and you.

683
01:15:54,433 --> 01:15:57,182
I won't even speak
of who else he abandoned.

684
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:58,843
Damn you, boy.

685
01:15:58,914 --> 01:16:01,980
Don't you blame my son
for Samuel's death!

686
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:04,897
Samuel chose to be a soldier,
and soldiers die...

687
01:16:04,962 --> 01:16:06,936
sent to their slaughter
by men in government.

688
01:16:07,010 --> 01:16:08,766
Parasites like you!

689
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:10,557
Damn and blast you!

690
01:16:10,626 --> 01:16:13,343
Damn you.
And damn you too!

691
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:15,963
Shut your mouth.
Leave her out of this!

692
01:16:16,034 --> 01:16:18,074
Get out of my house
and get off my land.

693
01:16:18,146 --> 01:16:21,659
Why? Because I want
to serve my country as you did?

694
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:24,764
Or because, like you,
I love a woman who doesn't love me?

695
01:16:25,795 --> 01:16:29,439
He used her and deserted her,
your darling Tristan.

696
01:16:29,506 --> 01:16:31,132
Alfred, don't. Please.

697
01:16:31,203 --> 01:16:32,926
I loved her!

698
01:16:34,754 --> 01:16:36,697
I love her still.

699
01:16:39,843 --> 01:16:42,877
He stole her from me.
Ifyou want to know the truth...

700
01:16:42,947 --> 01:16:46,176
he stole her from Samuel
before the war.

701
01:16:46,243 --> 01:16:48,218
God help me, I'll kill you.

702
01:16:50,115 --> 01:16:54,239
Here.
Read your darling Tristan's letter.

703
01:17:01,188 --> 01:17:02,595
You deserve to be happy.

704
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:34,365
Late that night we found
the Colonel on the floor...

705
01:17:34,437 --> 01:17:37,252
beside a cold fire.

706
01:17:37,317 --> 01:17:39,008
He could not move.

707
01:17:40,678 --> 01:17:43,166
His hai rturned white over night...

708
01:17:43,238 --> 01:17:45,572
and he became an old man.

709
01:17:46,918 --> 01:17:50,846
And after that,
Tristan sent no more letters.

710
01:17:52,359 --> 01:17:54,530
As the years passed by...

711
01:17:54,598 --> 01:17:57,566
we would hear that someone
had seen him on a ship...

712
01:17:57,638 --> 01:18:01,413
going up some river
no white man had gone up before.

713
01:18:02,919 --> 01:18:05,254
Stories came to us.

714
01:18:05,319 --> 01:18:07,708
Strange stories.

715
01:18:08,999 --> 01:18:12,032
And then, for years,
there was nothing.

716
01:18:16,999 --> 01:18:19,171
He was lost to us.

717
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,728
That was all we knew.

718
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:25,412
But every year,
in the Moon of the Falling Leaves...

719
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:30,848
I would dream that the bear's voice
inside him had grown silent...

720
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:34,433
and that Tristan might again
come to live in the world.

721
01:18:35,465 --> 01:18:37,407
But then the winter would come.

722
01:18:38,441 --> 01:18:40,296
And then another spring.

723
01:18:41,321 --> 01:18:44,288
And still he stayed away.

724
01:19:13,002 --> 01:19:14,758
What the hell is he doing?

725
01:20:10,284 --> 01:20:12,456
She's a mean old bitch,
but she's yours.

726
01:20:18,605 --> 01:20:19,979
Welcome home.

727
01:20:27,725 --> 01:20:30,114
Old man!
Where's Father?

728
01:20:54,638 --> 01:20:57,005
He had a stroke someyears ago.

729
01:20:57,070 --> 01:20:59,176
He can't talk now.

730
01:21:04,207 --> 01:21:05,734
Hello, Father.

731
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:19,534
He wants to celebrate.

732
01:21:43,409 --> 01:21:44,783
I'm happy too.

733
01:22:14,450 --> 01:22:16,392
Father, this is for you.

734
01:22:21,171 --> 01:22:24,684
''Colonel William Ludlow,
from his son Tristan.''

735
01:22:25,811 --> 01:22:27,599
I didn't know.

736
01:22:30,323 --> 01:22:34,065
These are boars' tusks,
made by a Javanese warrior.

737
01:22:34,131 --> 01:22:36,138
He, too, was a great man.

738
01:22:53,812 --> 01:22:57,806
I have other things for Mother
and Little Izzy and Susannah.

739
01:23:03,028 --> 01:23:04,402
What is it?

740
01:23:14,292 --> 01:23:15,983
Alfred and Miss Susannah...

741
01:23:16,052 --> 01:23:18,540
were married several years ago.

742
01:23:21,653 --> 01:23:23,825
Your brother's a congressman now.

743
01:23:25,493 --> 01:23:27,828
They have a big, new place
in Helena.

744
01:23:32,693 --> 01:23:35,181
It's as it should be.

745
01:23:35,253 --> 01:23:38,384
Cattle prices dropped
after the war ended.

746
01:23:39,894 --> 01:23:42,676
The Colonel don't seem to care.

747
01:23:42,742 --> 01:23:44,651
He lost nearly everything he had.

748
01:23:46,582 --> 01:23:48,011
We'll make it back...

749
01:23:48,086 --> 01:23:51,829
on horses or something else
if we have to.

750
01:23:57,654 --> 01:24:00,021
He's saying that your brother
voted for the Volstead Act.

751
01:24:00,087 --> 01:24:03,403
Did he? You suggesting
I become a boot legger?

752
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:07,025
Good money in bootlegging,
if you know what you're doing.

753
01:24:07,095 --> 01:24:08,655
Screw the government.

754
01:24:08,727 --> 01:24:10,582
Screw them.

755
01:25:09,978 --> 01:25:12,345
Forever turned out
to be too long.

756
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:15,705
I know.

757
01:25:26,138 --> 01:25:27,927
Here.

758
01:25:27,994 --> 01:25:30,263
I don't want it.

759
01:25:37,178 --> 01:25:40,790
They told me
that this was magic...

760
01:25:40,859 --> 01:25:44,634
that whoever wore it
would be protected.

761
01:25:51,995 --> 01:25:53,370
Keep it.

762
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:14,642
Don't you want to see Alfred?

763
01:26:16,221 --> 01:26:18,741
It's probably better
that I don't.

764
01:26:23,293 --> 01:26:25,432
Tell him hello...

765
01:26:25,501 --> 01:26:28,054
and congratulations.

766
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:07,613
He likes you.

767
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:12,574
Welcome home.

768
01:27:14,463 --> 01:27:15,837
Isabel?

769
01:27:19,263 --> 01:27:20,889
I want you to have him.

770
01:27:21,823 --> 01:27:24,638
I have something for you too.

771
01:27:24,703 --> 01:27:26,558
I brought it back.

772
01:27:27,583 --> 01:27:29,918
It's from Ierapetra.

773
01:27:29,984 --> 01:27:31,806
- That's in--
- Crete.

774
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:33,912
- Yeah.
- I know where it is.

775
01:27:33,984 --> 01:27:36,799
Your father taught me
European history.

776
01:27:38,945 --> 01:27:41,945
A little girl.
That's me, right?

777
01:27:45,024 --> 01:27:46,617
Thankyou.

778
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:14,336
Okay, we'll seeyou
in a few days.

779
01:28:17,186 --> 01:28:19,041
Don't wait on me.
I'll be fine.

780
01:28:20,546 --> 01:28:24,474
It was then that Tristan came
into the quiet heart...

781
01:28:24,546 --> 01:28:26,553
of his life.

782
01:28:26,626 --> 01:28:30,074
The bear inside him was sleeping.

783
01:28:32,226 --> 01:28:35,041
It is hard to tell
of happiness.

784
01:28:36,547 --> 01:28:38,554
Time goes by...

785
01:28:38,626 --> 01:28:41,277
and we feel safe too soon.

786
01:28:42,595 --> 01:28:45,443
- I heard the oddest news.
- Yes?

787
01:28:45,507 --> 01:28:46,881
Yes.

788
01:28:47,907 --> 01:28:50,395
Tristan...

789
01:28:50,467 --> 01:28:51,842
is back.

790
01:28:53,987 --> 01:28:55,842
Yes, I know.

791
01:28:57,508 --> 01:28:58,882
You know?

792
01:29:00,068 --> 01:29:01,922
How do you know?

793
01:29:05,764 --> 01:29:07,138
I saw him.

794
01:29:08,708 --> 01:29:13,313
He had the audacity
to come here just to see you?

795
01:29:13,381 --> 01:29:15,999
He wanted to see you,
but thought you'd get upset.

796
01:29:17,604 --> 01:29:19,427
He might be right.

797
01:29:27,109 --> 01:29:29,443
What did he--

798
01:29:29,509 --> 01:29:31,199
What did he say?

799
01:29:31,269 --> 01:29:32,644
He said to say hello...

800
01:29:33,829 --> 01:29:35,618
and congratulations.

801
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:41,248
Silly me.

802
01:29:42,949 --> 01:29:45,284
He told you the news?

803
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:48,707
What do you think?

804
01:29:51,174 --> 01:29:54,076
Come on.
It's perfectly absurd.

805
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:57,153
Marrying Isabel Two.

806
01:29:57,222 --> 01:30:01,281
God, she's practically our sister.

807
01:30:02,951 --> 01:30:05,766
She can't be more than,
what, 19?

808
01:30:06,791 --> 01:30:08,198
Twenty.

809
01:30:08,263 --> 01:30:11,460
I can't imagine what the hell
Decker is thinking of...

810
01:30:11,527 --> 01:30:13,829
to allow this.

811
01:30:13,895 --> 01:30:17,278
Perhaps he's thinking
of his daughter's happiness.

812
01:30:20,263 --> 01:30:23,940
Happiness?
With Tristan?

813
01:30:25,255 --> 01:30:29,118
You, of all people,
should know how impossible that is.

814
01:30:29,191 --> 01:30:31,526
I'm not Isabel Two.

815
01:30:41,192 --> 01:30:43,200
June2, 1921.

816
01:30:43,273 --> 01:30:44,647
Dear Tristan:

817
01:30:44,712 --> 01:30:48,160
I was so pleased to hear
of your coming marriage.

818
01:30:49,993 --> 01:30:51,651
Your father must be very happy.

819
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:54,884
Isabel Two is like
a daughter to him...

820
01:30:56,553 --> 01:30:59,368
as she was named
after your own mother.

821
01:30:59,433 --> 01:31:03,208
It seems as though it was always
meant to be, doesn't it?

822
01:31:08,873 --> 01:31:10,335
Damnation.

823
01:32:37,037 --> 01:32:38,892
Samuel Decker Ludlow.

824
01:32:46,798 --> 01:32:48,653
Dearest Tristan:

825
01:32:50,798 --> 01:32:53,930
Alfred and I were delighted
to hear of your son's birth.

826
01:32:53,998 --> 01:32:57,773
We hoped for a child of our own,
but of that I despair.

827
01:32:58,798 --> 01:33:00,969
I know Alfred thinks of you often.

828
01:33:01,038 --> 01:33:04,334
I look forward to the day when we
all might see one another again.

829
01:33:08,239 --> 01:33:10,890
Your son bears a proud
and noble name.

830
01:33:10,959 --> 01:33:12,650
I know he will live up to it.

831
01:33:17,359 --> 01:33:19,530
Please give my love
to Isabel Two...

832
01:33:19,599 --> 01:33:22,087
and to your father
and everyone else.

833
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:24,680
Yours always, Susannah.

834
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,927
Evening, gentlemen.

835
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,750
Been meaning to talk to you
about one or two things.

836
01:33:40,816 --> 01:33:42,191
By all means.

837
01:33:42,256 --> 01:33:44,623
As you know perfectly well...

838
01:33:44,688 --> 01:33:46,543
we handle the liquor around here.

839
01:33:46,608 --> 01:33:50,503
Now, you've been
a small-time operator.

840
01:33:50,577 --> 01:33:52,486
An amateur, frankly.

841
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:56,335
Lately, your shipments
have been getting a little fat...

842
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,735
and my patience
has been getting a little thin.

843
01:33:58,801 --> 01:34:02,576
So the next time
you get in ourway...

844
01:34:02,641 --> 01:34:04,015
will be the last time.

845
01:34:05,201 --> 01:34:07,983
Excuse me.
I appreciate it.

846
01:34:08,049 --> 01:34:10,766
Perhaps you're wondering
why you're not dead already.

847
01:34:11,794 --> 01:34:14,412
Because your brother
is Congressman Ludlow.

848
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:16,653
And that's it.
That's all.

849
01:34:22,962 --> 01:34:24,489
Kenneth. Thomas.

850
01:34:50,163 --> 01:34:51,756
Can't you just say hello?

851
01:35:05,044 --> 01:35:08,754
- Hello, Alfred.
- Hello, Tristan.

852
01:35:17,141 --> 01:35:19,443
- Who's this young man?
- This is Samuel.

853
01:35:26,196 --> 01:35:28,171
She's beautiful.

854
01:35:33,941 --> 01:35:35,315
Let me see.

855
01:35:43,285 --> 01:35:47,563
- Who is this lady?
- I'm your Aunt Susannah.

856
01:35:50,486 --> 01:35:54,098
I used to know your Uncle Samuel
who died in the war.

857
01:35:58,038 --> 01:36:01,169
- You look like him.
- That's what Grandpa says.

858
01:36:04,246 --> 01:36:07,246
He was very brave and very good.

859
01:36:07,319 --> 01:36:08,977
Grandpa says that too.

860
01:36:09,046 --> 01:36:12,592
Grandpa says I can have
Uncle Samuel's gun when I'm bigger.

861
01:36:12,663 --> 01:36:14,518
Would you come and see it?

862
01:36:20,567 --> 01:36:22,989
I'd love to.

863
01:36:23,063 --> 01:36:24,438
Sometime.

864
01:36:26,968 --> 01:36:30,448
- He's a fine boy.
- He is.

865
01:36:32,248 --> 01:36:36,819
- Is Father well?
- As well as can be expected.

866
01:36:41,688 --> 01:36:44,109
- I wish--
- Pardon the intrusion.

867
01:36:45,848 --> 01:36:49,144
Excuse me.
We're ready for your speech now.

868
01:36:49,208 --> 01:36:50,931
I'll be there in a minute.

869
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,375
Thank you.

870
01:37:06,649 --> 01:37:09,780
- We'll meet again soon?
- I'd like that.

871
01:37:40,219 --> 01:37:41,593
What's this?

872
01:37:48,667 --> 01:37:50,522
Go and get Tynert.

873
01:37:54,875 --> 01:37:57,145
I think you missed a bump, Stab.

874
01:38:15,132 --> 01:38:16,343
Jesus!

875
01:38:16,413 --> 01:38:19,064
Sir, we have information
that you're transporting goods...

876
01:38:19,133 --> 01:38:20,987
in violation
of the Volstead Act.

877
01:38:21,053 --> 01:38:23,802
If you mean a case of Irish whiskey
for my father, I am.

878
01:38:23,869 --> 01:38:25,395
Give it up.

879
01:38:26,428 --> 01:38:27,835
He'll be disappointed.

880
01:38:58,654 --> 01:39:00,793
Hold him down.

881
01:39:02,014 --> 01:39:03,738
Let's get out of here.

882
01:39:03,807 --> 01:39:06,905
- There's an envelope in his pocket.
- Now.

883
01:39:12,351 --> 01:39:17,207
My brother told you
to stay out of our way.

884
01:39:22,208 --> 01:39:23,866
Put him in the car.

885
01:40:58,723 --> 01:41:01,374
- I don't want to see him.
- Father--

886
01:41:22,661 --> 01:41:24,068
I'm so very sorry.

887
01:41:30,981 --> 01:41:33,632
Father won't see me, even now?

888
01:41:35,141 --> 01:41:38,720
He blames the government
for Isabel's--

889
01:41:45,861 --> 01:41:48,195
There's something
we have to talk about.

890
01:41:50,022 --> 01:41:53,502
The officer you beat
almost died.

891
01:41:54,757 --> 01:41:56,612
Now, everyone understands...

892
01:41:58,662 --> 01:42:01,477
but you'll have to plead guilty...

893
01:42:01,542 --> 01:42:02,916
serve 30 days.

894
01:42:02,983 --> 01:42:05,568
And the one who shot his gun?

895
01:42:07,942 --> 01:42:09,797
He was...

896
01:42:10,982 --> 01:42:12,389
reprimanded.

897
01:42:13,415 --> 01:42:17,092
- The O'Banions?
- Nothing.

898
01:42:18,183 --> 01:42:19,809
You have to let it go.

899
01:42:19,879 --> 01:42:23,807
It was a terrible, tragic accident.

900
01:42:23,879 --> 01:42:26,432
Listen to me.

901
01:42:26,503 --> 01:42:29,154
You let this go now.

902
01:42:29,223 --> 01:42:31,557
You got in over your head.

903
01:42:35,943 --> 01:42:37,667
I'll need a minute.

904
01:43:17,737 --> 01:43:19,592
I'm so sorry.

905
01:43:21,706 --> 01:43:23,616
We all loved her.

906
01:43:26,762 --> 01:43:28,137
How are you?

907
01:43:29,834 --> 01:43:31,209
I'm fine.

908
01:43:38,827 --> 01:43:40,583
We never get to see you.

909
01:43:46,187 --> 01:43:49,002
I gave a speech the other day.

910
01:43:49,067 --> 01:43:51,238
- You did?
- Yes.

911
01:43:51,307 --> 01:43:53,795
My first public engagement.

912
01:44:01,868 --> 01:44:06,024
It was on the responsibilities
of women in--

913
01:44:12,428 --> 01:44:14,283
It's good to see you.

914
01:44:39,629 --> 01:44:41,320
I'm sorry.

915
01:44:49,870 --> 01:44:52,553
I still sometimes dream...

916
01:44:52,621 --> 01:44:54,793
that I'm the mother
of your children.

917
01:45:05,070 --> 01:45:06,499
I wanted her to die.

918
01:45:09,550 --> 01:45:12,398
Maybe I even wanted Samuel to die.

919
01:45:18,831 --> 01:45:21,963
You had nothing to do
with Samuel's death.

920
01:45:22,031 --> 01:45:24,300
And you had nothing to do
with Isabel's death.

921
01:45:26,512 --> 01:45:27,886
Didn't I?

922
01:45:30,031 --> 01:45:31,406
Go home.

923
01:45:34,448 --> 01:45:36,685
Go home to Alfred.

924
01:46:02,352 --> 01:46:03,727
Where were you?

925
01:46:05,393 --> 01:46:07,564
I just went out for a walk.

926
01:46:07,633 --> 01:46:11,408
I needed a walk.
What are you doing home?

927
01:46:11,473 --> 01:46:14,124
Your doctor rang,
said you missed your appointment.

928
01:46:14,193 --> 01:46:16,582
I called home.
You weren't here. I--

929
01:46:17,617 --> 01:46:19,559
I feel very tired.

930
01:46:20,914 --> 01:46:22,604
I'm going to bed.

931
01:52:16,129 --> 01:52:20,058
You have won her.
I am bringing her home.

932
01:52:20,130 --> 01:52:21,886
Alfred.

933
01:52:56,771 --> 01:52:58,779
I followed all the rules:

934
01:53:00,931 --> 01:53:03,102
man's and God's.

935
01:53:04,931 --> 01:53:06,458
And you--

936
01:53:08,292 --> 01:53:09,666
You followed none.

937
01:53:15,492 --> 01:53:17,826
And they all loved you more.

938
01:53:21,732 --> 01:53:24,383
Samuel, Father...

939
01:53:28,453 --> 01:53:31,901
and even my own wife.

940
01:53:43,013 --> 01:53:46,209
I'd like a moment
alone with her.

941
01:54:28,615 --> 01:54:30,142
When Samuel died--

942
01:54:35,175 --> 01:54:37,826
When Samuel died, I cursed God.

943
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:50,851
Did I damn everybody around me
as well as myself?

944
01:54:54,376 --> 01:54:59,111
You are not damned.

945
01:54:59,176 --> 01:55:01,991
I won't allow that.

946
01:55:03,016 --> 01:55:05,570
You're not damned!

947
01:55:47,499 --> 01:55:49,833
Samuel,
this is a gentleman's gun.

948
01:55:49,898 --> 01:55:52,102
It's smaller,
but it's just as powerful.

949
01:55:52,170 --> 01:55:55,553
That's what you want
when you grow up, isn't it? A gun.

950
01:55:57,771 --> 01:55:59,626
Samuel, come here!

951
01:56:05,452 --> 01:56:10,405
Run along now. Go with Pet.
Get him in the house.

952
01:56:13,964 --> 01:56:15,938
He's a fine boy.

953
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:23,591
You know we're not here
to arrest you.

954
01:56:39,885 --> 01:56:42,373
You take me to the woods
so my boy won't see.

955
01:56:43,437 --> 01:56:44,899
I don't want my boy to see.

956
01:56:47,021 --> 01:56:48,516
Let's get on with it.

957
01:56:51,245 --> 01:56:53,350
- Father.
- Colonel Ludlow, sir.

958
01:56:54,350 --> 01:56:56,138
What's going on here?

959
01:56:57,901 --> 01:56:59,308
What's going on here?

960
01:59:12,756 --> 01:59:16,618
You don't have to be a genius to know
they'll come after you for this.

961
01:59:17,748 --> 01:59:19,122
Yeah.

962
01:59:25,141 --> 01:59:26,515
Yeah?

963
01:59:29,908 --> 01:59:33,170
I want to ask you
to watch over my children.

964
01:59:36,308 --> 01:59:38,163
Watch over Samuel.

965
01:59:46,645 --> 01:59:48,587
Brother, it would be an honor.

966
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:14,482
Howmuch I wanted
to take scalps...

967
02:00:14,551 --> 02:00:16,722
but it was not my kill.

968
02:00:31,991 --> 02:00:34,958
That night,
we buried the bodies...

969
02:00:35,031 --> 02:00:39,766
and dumped the carina deep pool
in the upper Missouri.

970
02:00:39,831 --> 02:00:42,799
I remember when he was a boy...

971
02:00:42,871 --> 02:00:47,279
I thought Tristan would never live
to be an old man.

972
02:00:47,351 --> 02:00:50,166
I was wrong about that.

973
02:00:50,231 --> 02:00:53,843
I was wrong about many things.

974
02:00:53,912 --> 02:00:57,841
It was those who loved him most
who died young.

975
02:00:59,032 --> 02:01:02,807
He was a rock
they broke themselves against...

976
02:01:02,872 --> 02:01:05,687
however much
he tried to protect them.

977
02:01:07,097 --> 02:01:09,683
But he had his honor...

978
02:01:09,753 --> 02:01:11,924
and a long life...

979
02:01:11,993 --> 02:01:14,644
and he saw his children grow...

980
02:01:14,713 --> 02:01:17,201
and raise their own families.

981
02:01:20,633 --> 02:01:23,929
Tristan died in 1963...

982
02:01:23,993 --> 02:01:27,288
in the Moon of the Popping Trees.

983
02:01:27,354 --> 02:01:30,485
He was last seen
up in the north country...

984
02:01:30,553 --> 02:01:33,685
where the hunting was still good.

985
02:01:33,754 --> 02:01:36,241
His grave is unmarked...

986
02:01:36,313 --> 02:01:39,128
but it does not matter.

987
02:01:39,194 --> 02:01:42,641
He had always lived
in the borderland anyway:

988
02:01:42,714 --> 02:01:46,326
somewhere between this world
and the other.

989
02:02:23,836 --> 02:02:25,843
It was a good death.
