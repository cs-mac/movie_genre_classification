I-I lost a day of work

811
00:39:44,077 --> 00:39:45,810
giving my statement
to the police, and...

812
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:47,179
What statement was that?

813
00:39:49,148 --> 00:39:52,150
The one saying I was with T.J.
the night of Lou's murder.

814
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,154
Now the prosecutor is threatening to...

815
00:39:56,222 --> 00:39:58,923
to deport me
and take away my daughter.

816
00:39:58,991 --> 00:40:02,994
I'm under a lot of pressure.

817
00:40:03,061 --> 00:40:05,863
I'm very sorry to hear that.

818
00:40:09,268 --> 00:40:11,002
So...

819
00:40:11,069 --> 00:40:12,903
How can I help you?

820
00:40:15,373 --> 00:40:19,809
I need more money
for being T.J.'s alibi.

821
00:40:19,877 --> 00:40:21,611
How are things at the club?

822
00:40:21,678 --> 00:40:24,981
And your daughter.
What's her name?

823
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:27,083
Amy.

824
00:40:27,151 --> 00:40:29,052
[ Sighs ]
Look, Mr. Karsten, I...

825
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,186
You do something for me?

826
00:40:33,156 --> 00:40:35,006
What?

827
00:40:36,204 --> 00:40:37,758
Take your clothes off.

828
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,998
What's the matter?

829
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,304
Isn't that what men pay you to do?

830
00:40:49,338 --> 00:40:52,340
