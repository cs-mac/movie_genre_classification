1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Loving You a Thousand Times

2
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,590
Ahjussi!

3
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,470
Can you kick the ball over here please?

4
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,360
It's cold.
Let's go somewhere indoors to talk.

5
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,830
It feels like we're somewhere far away;

6
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,940
like we're sitting in a distant land.

7
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,920
Everything seems like a dream.

8
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,330
Before, I was rash

9
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,560
and I said things I didn't mean. I'm sorry.

10
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,610
Yesterday,

11
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:55,490
I heard from Grandmother that you did it so
you could pay for Father-in-law's surgery.

12
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,760
Last night, I stayed up all night thinking

13
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,520
about us.

14
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:22,060
But after I was done thinking,
and thinking some more,

15
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,380
We can no longer be together...

16
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,570
Let's get a divorce.

17
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,100
You should also know that
we have no other choice.

18
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,730
I'll let my family know so you take
care of things at your house.

19
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,110
What is this?

20
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,770
It's alimony.

21
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,690
I'll call you when the divorce
papers are ready.

22
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,830
Kang Ho!

23
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,140
Kang Ho!

24
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,800
Kang Ho! Wait just for one moment.

25
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,290
I can't take this.

26
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,890
What do you mean you can't take it?
Just take it.

27
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,260
I'm not someone who deserves
to receive alimony.

28
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,490
If I tell you to take it, just take it!

29
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,360
If you and I divorce and you fall
into hard times again,

30
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,360
what are you going to do then?

31
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,440
Kang Ho...

32
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,750
That's why you should have just
taken it without saying anything!

33
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,420
What is this?!

34
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,470
How were we reduced to this?!

35
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,330
So why didn't you tell me?!

36
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,390
If you had told me before we got married,
something like this wouldn't have happened!

37
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,080
Why didn't you tell me?! Why?!

38
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,800
Because I... loved you.

39
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,430
What?

40
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,490
Because I love you so much.

41
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,570
That's why.

42
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,980
I'm sorry...

43
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,610
I was wrong.

44
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,760
Go Eun Nim,

45
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,070
listen to me carefully.

46
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,480
I'm going to forget about you.

47
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,890
So you should do the same.

48
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,750
Forget about me completely,

49
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,140
Okay?

50
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,810
<i>When will I forget about you?</i>

51
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,330
<i>The one and only person in my heart.</i>

52
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,650
<i>Even though I try to forget</i>

53
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,470
<i>I keep on thinking about you.</i>

54
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:04,540
<i>So it hurts, it hurts,
it hurts, it hurts.</i>

55
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:11,570
<i>The happy memories
fade away into scars.</i>

56
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,760
<i>When you said you'd be there for me</i>

57
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,240
<i>And that I was the only one for you.</i>

58
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:32,100
<i>Why did you tell me those things?
And made me fall in love with you.</i>

59
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,390
<i>In the end I feel like a fool.</i>

60
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,150
<i>I thought we were forever.</i>

61
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:44,660
<i>Like a fool I still
believe in those words.</i>

62
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,480
<i>When will I forget about you?</i>

63
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,100
<i>The one and only person in my heart.</i>

64
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,450
<i>Even though I try to forget</i>

65
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,180
<i>I keep on thinking about you.</i>

66
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:06,250
<i>So it hurts, it hurts,
it hurts, it hurts.</i>

67
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:13,870
<i>The happy memories
fade away into scars.</i>

68
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,240
<i>Let's forget, let's forget, even though</i>

69
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,200
<i>I keep telling myself again and again.</i>

70
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,980
<i>I can't forget about you</i>

71
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,780
<i>Even though my heart tells me to</i>

72
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,830
<i>Will I be able to erase everything?</i>

73
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,930
<i>You, the one person in my life</i>

74
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:31,180
<i>Let's get a divorce.
You, the one person in my life</i>

75
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,610
Let's get a divorce.

76
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,560
<i>Even though I try as hard as I can.</i>

77
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,420
I'll let my family know so you take
care of things at your house.

78
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,110
<i>It hurts I'll let my family know so
you take care of things at your house.</i>

79
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,060
<i>It hurts</i>

80
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:54,190
<i>The happy memories
fade away into scars.</i>

81
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,190
Miss, please stay healthy.

82
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,390
Sister, thank you so much.

83
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,340
I must have been such an inconvenience.

84
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,300
Be well, okay?

85
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,440
Ah, Mommy! Why is this so painful?

86
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,900
All you're doing is grating two onions.
What's taking so long?

87
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,850
I'm grating right now.

88
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,010
When you're done grating these onions,

89
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,750
peel these pears and grate them too, okay?

90
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,350
Grate the pears too?!

91
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,450
Of course!

92
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,750
When you're making bulgogi*.
(*marinated BBQ beef),

93
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,150
grated pears need to be added to soften
the meat and give it a sweet taste.

94
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,800
Then do you want to wipe
down the living room?

95
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,830
Should we switch?

96
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,400
No, it's okay! I'll grate the onions.

97
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:47,850
Ah, all we're making is bulgogi.
Why is it so complicated?!

98
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,670
This is so tiring.

99
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh my! Oh dear! What? What is it?
What? Does your stomach hurt?

100
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,280
Yes... aahh..

101
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,340
Nan Jung! Nan Jung! What's wrong?!

102
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,930
My stomach hurts a little, but it's alright.

103
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,520
What do you mean it's alright?!

104
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,320
Go into the room! Hurry!

105
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,270
Why did you even do chores like
this and tire yourself out?!

106
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,750
Aunt, how could you?

107
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,590
I have to go finish grating
the onions and the pears.

108
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,890
If your stomach hurts, then why are
you worrying about those things honey?

109
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,880
We have to grate them to make bulgogi.

110
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,990
Aish, really!

111
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,410
Nan... Nan Jung! Are you okay?

112
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,660
Can't you see for yourself, Aunt?

113
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,950
She's not okay!

114
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,950
Why did you go and tell Nan Jung
to do things like that?

115
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,870
She didn't even do anything!

116
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,080
I was the one who made breakfast and lunch.

117
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,810
Did she clean or make food?

118
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,910
That's just...

119
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,570
I'm worried about my sister Eun Nim and
if Chul's chicken restaurant will go well.

120
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,810
My heart is so uneasy and anxious lately,

121
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,270
that's why I couldn't do anything, Aunt.

122
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:43,260
Oh, my Nan Jung. Nan Jung,
is there anything you want to eat?

123
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,130
<i>What do you want? What should I make you?</i>

124
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,980
No. Maybe it's because my stomach hurts,
but there's nothing I want.

125
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:57,850
Well, then, if there's anything you want
to eat, just tell me whenever.

126
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,360
Get some rest!

127
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,480
But...

128
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:06,150
I suddenly do want some homemade hodduk*
(*sweet sesame rice pastries).

129
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,880
Hodduk?

130
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:21,940
I think I have feelings for you, Writer Kim.

131
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,950
Oh! I can't concentrate.

132
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,500
Oh my. How can a person... oh, what is this?

133
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,320
That person must be crazy.

134
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,910
He's insane.

135
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,050
He's not in his right mind.

136
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,950
Ohhhh I can't work!
I can't work! I can't work!

137
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,030
Oh I can't work!

138
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,550
Of all things, how could she
want hodduk?! Really?!

139
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,250
I wonder if her stomach actually hurts!

140
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,880
So Weol! Give me a cup of coffee.

141
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,380
Unni! Can't you see that
I'm kneading the dough?!

142
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,430
It's ready, so just pour it for yourself!

143
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,430
Uh.. alright.

144
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,090
But why are you kneading dough?

145
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,650
Are you making kalgooksoo*?
(*flour noodles in vegetable-egg broth)

146
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:28,900
Ahem. Your daughter-in-law says that
she wants to have some homemade hodduk.

147
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,280
Hodduk?! That sounds delicious!

148
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,260
Of course.. everyone wants to have
some so of course I need to make it.

149
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,840
You know..

150
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:47,600
So Weol, I have a friend of a friend..

151
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,300
Whom a younger man confessed his love to!

152
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,670
Really?! At that age?

153
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:02,040
That woman must have saved
a country in a past life.

154
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,090
But how old is the man?

155
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,770
Oh, I'm not quite sure,

156
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:12,030
but she said he's 12 years younger.

157
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,380
Oh my! Isn't that man crazy?

158
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,130
Unni, so your friend's friend..
what did she say?

159
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,280
Does she like him?

160
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,520
She's not sure if she likes him,
but she seems to be a little confused.

161
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,930
There are other things to be confused about!

162
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:39,170
A man who's 12 years younger...

163
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,720
Unni, tell your friend not to
associate with that woman.

164
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,280
That woman really has no conscience.

165
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,790
<i>Wow, 12 years..</i>

166
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,520
Hey, I'll go answer the door.

167
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,650
Okay.

168
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,190
Oh my... oh my.

169
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,010
He even has a bouquet of flowers!

170
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,810
This person must be crazy!

171
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,380
Really?

172
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,230
Unni! Who is it?
Why aren't you opening the door?

173
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,140
Uh, I'm opening it!
I'm opening it! It's Director Bong!

174
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,540
You'd better not say anything weird!

175
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,690
- Hello!
- Ah yes.

176
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,530
Oh my! Why do you have a bouquet of flowers?

177
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,960
Ah, this is a leftover prop from the movie.

178
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,680
I thought it'd be a waste
to throw it out so keep it!

179
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:48,250
And during a break while shooting,
it seemed like Writer Kim liked

180
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,850
walnut cookies so I bought some.

181
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,370
I'm busy so I'll be leaving now.

182
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:58,050
Do you at least want a
cup of tea before going?

183
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,740
No, it's fine! I just dropped by
while was scouting for possible

184
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,440
locations for shoots so..

185
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,120
Good-bye.

186
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,350
<i>Oh dear... why is he acting like this??</i>

187
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:19,980
Wow.. he says it's a prop,

188
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,870
but how can the flowers
be so fresh and pretty?

189
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,690
Why are you two home so early?

190
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,440
I stopped by the job resort

191
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,340
and it seemed like Father wasn't feeling
well so I accompanied him home early.

192
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,760
Honey, don't you have to go
to the hospital then?

193
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,840
It's nothing serious.

194
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,490
- Are you home?
- Yes.

195
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,490
What about Kang Ho?

196
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,810
He's not back yet. He hasn't called either.

197
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,610
But...

198
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,330
What about Daughter-in-law?

199
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,930
Daughter-in-law still isn't back yet?

200
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,970
Kang Ho's having such a rough time.
Daughter-in-law hasn't come home in days.

201
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,090
What are you all hiding from me?

202
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,190
- Oh my son, you're home?
- Yes, Mother.

203
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,770
How are you feeling?

204
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,020
I know you must be tired,
but sit here for a moment.

205
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,050
Mother, while I was away
on the business trip,

206
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,350
what happened at home?

207
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,380
Why isn't daughter-in-law coming home?

208
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,900
The truth is...

209
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,560
Kang Ho and daughter-in-law
fought for reasons unknown to me...

210
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,480
and granddaughter-in-law left the house.

211
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,770
What?

212
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,670
Daughter-in-law left the house?

213
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,070
But what did she fight with Kang Ho about?

214
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,610
We too have no idea.

215
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,250
If granddaughter-in-law were home,

216
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,910
Kang Ho wouldn't have things so rough..

217
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:15,080
Son... I'm so upset about so many things
going on I don't know what to do.

218
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,170
What in the world have
you been doing at home?

219
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:21,780
Our daughter-in-law has left the house, so
how can you just sit back and do nothing?!

220
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,310
What do you expect me to do about
something they fought about?

221
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,590
<i>- Kang Ho!
- Oh, Kang Ho!</i>

222
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,890
<i>Kang Ho's home!</i>

223
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,550
Oh Kang Ho!

224
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,630
Why did you come home just now?
Where were you?

225
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:39,750
Did you want to see me so upset I could die?

226
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,980
<i>Kang Ho! Come and sit down.</i>

227
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,340
That's right. Come and sit next
to your grandmother.

228
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,800
Do you see, Kang Ho?

229
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,790
Grandmother, your mom, your Hyung and me

230
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,220
were so worried about you last night
that we couldn't get any sleep.

231
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,080
Kang Ho...

232
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:10,440
Everything that has happened is your
grandma's and your dad's faults.

233
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,770
So Kang Ho,

234
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,150
please just don't say that you're
going to leave this house.

235
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,950
If you're going to leave,

236
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,840
then leave after your grandma dies. Please.

237
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,520
Alright.

238
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,780
Thank you, Kang Ho.

239
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:35,440
Also, I don't know why you
and your wife are fighting..

240
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,310
But hurry and bring your wife home, okay?

241
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,020
I have something I need to tell you all.

242
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,060
Okay, tell us.

243
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,030
Eun Nim and I have decided to get a divorce.

244
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,460
W- what? Divorce?

245
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,360
What's the reason?!

246
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,430
The reason?

247
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:16,340
I am unable to tell you the reason.

248
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,140
What do you mean?

249
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,650
Getting a divorce after you marry
someone isn't something

250
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,650
that's decided so easily, is it?

251
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,870
Father, please don't ask me anything else.
I just wanted you all to know.

252
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,640
Kang Ho!

253
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,340
Just leave him be.

254
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,630
He must have a reason for acting that way,
would he be like that for kicks?

255
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,790
They're not children

256
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,450
and they'll decide things as mature adults,

257
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,940
so just let them be.

258
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,670
Look at you. Huh?

259
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,670
It's not anything else,

260
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,720
but your son is saying he wants
a divorce and you're telling us to

261
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,120
not do anything about it?!

262
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,370
Can you really say that as a mother?

263
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:59,090
He doesn't want to try anymore
because you're being like this!

264
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,400
You could have at least met
with granddaughter-in-law.

265
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,920
And just like my son said,

266
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,790
ask her what the reason is!

267
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:10,650
Don't we at least have to
know about the situation?!

268
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,080
<i>Isn't that so?!</i>

269
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,640
Mother,

270
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,870
I'll go see Daughter-in-law
so don't worry too much.

271
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,670
No, why would you meet her?

272
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,950
It would be much more comfortable if
Yoo Bin's mother or I went to see her.

273
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,020
If you go see her,

274
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,700
<i>do you think she'd comfortably be
able to talk about what's going on?</i>

275
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,390
<i>Father-in-law,</i>

276
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,290
I'll go meet her.

277
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,780
That's right! Okay! That would be better.

278
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,880
Unni!

279
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,340
Unni!

280
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,960
Why aren't you going inside?

281
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,230
Oh..

282
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,530
Unni..

283
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,060
where did you come from?

284
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,300
Is it true that you came back
from a trip with brother-in-law?

285
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,880
Eun Jung..

286
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,790
let's go inside.

287
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,750
She said she's coming so she
should be on her way! Please sit.

288
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,020
You're making me anxious as well.

289
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,820
Have some papaya tea.

290
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,980
You really don't listen to me.

291
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,900
Mom! Dad!

292
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,270
Eun Nim unni is here.

293
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,970
What? Really?

294
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:21,730
Mom... Dad.

295
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,960
Why are you in such a state?

296
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,000
Did you really leave that house?!

297
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,520
Divorce?!

298
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,310
Oh my, Nan Jung was right, honey.

299
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,660
- Do you have another man?
- Honey!

300
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:58,450
Does son-in-law Baek feel the same way?

301
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,940
Yes, Dad.

302
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,620
Why?

303
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,520
What could be the reason for bringing
up divorce in front of your dad?!

304
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,150
Dad.

305
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:15,940
There must be a reason for getting
a divorce! What is it?

306
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,290
Can you just be quiet?!

307
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,500
Did the in-laws say something to you?
Is that it?

308
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,660
What? Did you do something to upset them?

309
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,220
No, that's not it.

310
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,020
Then why would you divorce?

311
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,490
You two were happy and living
just fine! How did this happen??

312
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,900
Oh... Eun... Hey Eun Nim!

313
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:51,430
I don't think it's because of the in-laws.

314
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,870
Do you think there really is something
going on with son-in-law Baek?

315
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,720
How could this... I mean...

316
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:57,250
Go upstairs and tell Kang Ho to eat
even if he doesn't want to.

317
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,090
Yes ma'am.

318
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,870
Ahjumma, you don't need to.

319
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,160
Kang Ho's not here.

320
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,890
What? Kang Ho's not here?

321
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,420
Did you go up to his room?

322
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,980
Yes.

323
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,920
Where did he go without
eating breakfast first?

324
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,260
Do you think he left home again?

325
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,880
I don't think so.
Yesterday he said he wouldn't.

326
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,410
That's right.

327
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:25,450
If our Kang Ho said that he's not leaving,
then he won't.

328
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:30,930
Even if he goes, he would have told
me that he was leaving first.

329
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,990
Yoo Bin's mom,

330
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,640
go see daughter-in-law today.

331
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,640
Yes Sir.

332
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,700
Team Leader!

333
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,330
Yeol Nam! It's been a while.

334
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,540
I thought you were someone else
because your style has changed.

335
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,900
Nothing serious happened
while I was gone, right?

336
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,700
Yes. There was nothing going
on at the office, but..

337
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,480
Team Leader, what happened to you?

338
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:26,130
Is there something going on with Eun Nim?

339
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,340
Yes?

340
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,810
Father, Kang Ho's come in to work.

341
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,160
Really?

342
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:51,210
This is a design of young people
at the beach during summer time.

343
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,250
Don't you think it'd be uncomfortable if it
looks more of an underwear advertisement?

344
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,600
It's because the concept is
being healthy and sexy.

345
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,280
What I think is the model should be wearing
exercise clothes and jogging,

346
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,180
but if you get a glimpse of underwear
through her clothes,

347
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,190
it seems healthier and sexier.

348
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:16,660
Then it's the you see it
or you don't concept, isn't it?

349
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,520
What's next on the agenda?

350
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,140
Hello, it's me.

351
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:20,070
Yes, then I'll see you there.

352
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,610
Alright, please sit down.

353
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:02,610
I'm not sure if I should have asked to see you
when you are busy with work.

354
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,210
It's alright.

355
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:19,520
What happened... between you and Eun Nim?

356
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,830
Something must have happened..

357
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:27,000
Eun Nim keeps saying something strange..

358
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,700
That you two want a divorce.

359
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:36,520
It's not true, right?
That you want a divorce?

360
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,090
It's true.

361
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:42,330
Eun Nim and I have decided to get a divorce.

362
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,790
Why are you doing this all of a sudden? Huh?

363
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,230
You two were so happy together..

364
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,400
What in the world happened
to make you want to-

365
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,780
Fine,

366
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:04,860
if you definitely want a divorce,
what's the reason?

367
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,430
Eun Nim's not saying anything..

368
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,160
So can you at least tell me what it is?

369
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:18,770
I don't love Eun Nim anymore.
I dislike her now.

370
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,480
What... what did you...

371
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:24,140
That's why I said I wanted a divorce.

372
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,520
Because you dislike...

373
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,440
Because you don't love...

374
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,810
That's why you said you wanted a divorce?!

375
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,460
Huh?

376
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:40,360
How difficult was it for you
two to get married?!

377
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,420
My Eun Nim...

378
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,720
my Eun Nim cried so much tears because
she wanted to marry you!

379
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,820
But because of that lousy reason..

380
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,490
How can you say you want
a divorce so easily?!

381
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,960
Is marriage some kind of joke?!

382
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,980
I have another woman.

383
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,830
I just wanted to let you know that.

384
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,660
You no-good bastard.

385
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,110
Fine. Get a divorce then!

386
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,810
<i>Get a divorce.</i>

387
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,710
So Weol, I'm going out
and will be back soon.

388
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:12,380
Where are you going?

389
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,920
There's a practice reading today.

390
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,830
Why don't you have one more
hodduk before you go?

391
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:20,190
I already had one, why would
I eat another one? I'll be back!

392
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,350
Mom, are you going out?

393
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,990
- Yep, I'll be back, my son!
- Okay, see you later!

394
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,240
- Aunt!
- Your mom's going to a practice reading.

395
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,710
She ate those five hodduks already?!

396
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,530
Oh, Nan Jung, no, our baby in her stomach
must think the hodduks are delicious.

397
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:41,960
I only ate one, but Nan Jung
ate the rest by herself.

398
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,260
Aunt, are the other hodduks done?

399
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,040
Oh yes, just wait a little longer,
they'll be ready soon.

400
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,640
Okay Aunt!

401
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:56,120
<i>She said that her stomach was hurting
a little bit like she has lactic acid.</i>

402
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,780
How can she eat those hodduks
without any problems like that?

403
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,500
What's wrong, Aunt?

404
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,820
Oh, it's nothing. Nothing at all.

405
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,470
Nan Jung!

406
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,240
Nan Jung, what are you doing?

407
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:23,360
I was just laying here.

408
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,910
I made some more hodduks. Do you want some?

409
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,170
Yes, Aunt!

410
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,540
There you go!

411
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,020
Oh.. oh my... Chul!

412
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,500
I think we should take Nan Jung
to the hospital.

413
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,520
Oh no.. look at her face! It's so pale.

414
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,590
Is Nan Jung's face pale?

415
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:48,580
Hey, get dressed so we can go to the OB-GYN.

416
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:52,760
If your stomach keeps hurting like that,
it's because you have lactic acid.

417
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,040
No, it's okay!
They said I was fine last time.

418
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,550
Your stomach hurts when you're fine?

419
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,170
It's because you're not okay
that your stomach hurts!

420
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,800
That's... Aunt, you have a point.

421
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,690
Honey, let's hurry and go.

422
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,690
My stomach doesn't hurt!

423
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,690
You said it hurts! Let's go!

424
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,240
Let's go! You shouldn't eat hodduk
because you're hurting.

425
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,700
Ah, quickly!

426
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,990
The mother and the baby are
both very healthy.

427
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,340
Is there no lactic acid?

428
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,630
Yes! When I looked before,
there weren't any problems either.

429
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,270
Really? Thank you!

430
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,590
Thank you!

431
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:53,930
Then why did you say that your stomach
hurt so much you couldn't do anything??

432
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:59,840
Aunt, that... that was probably
because I had an upset stomach!

433
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,720
What?

434
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,100
Oh dear..

435
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,150
My money... My money...

436
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,820
My money!!!

437
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:27,030
Yes. I asked for a renegotiation before.

438
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,540
I just wanted to know if
the contract closing was done.

439
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,960
What did you say?

440
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,420
That company isn't able
to do a transaction?!

441
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,450
What?

442
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,260
It went over to a management company?

443
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,810
And what's that?

444
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:50,940
What does that even mean?!

445
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,560
The shares became worthless?!

446
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,360
Then that means that money became worthless!!!

447
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,680
Oh my...

448
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,150
this can't be! This can't!

449
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,410
I'm so dead now.

450
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,730
What do I do now?!

451
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:13,050
I'm completely ruined!

452
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,930
Mom, what's wrong?

453
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,930
Yeon Hee!

454
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,570
Yeon Hee!

455
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,870
Mom, what's wrong?
You've been like this for a few days now.

456
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,580
You need to tell me what it is.

457
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,870
It's nothing. Nothing at all.

458
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:36,390
What should I do about Yeon Hee?

459
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,160
<i>What do I do about this?</i>

460
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,730
<i>If Yeon Hee finds out, she'll go crazy.</i>

461
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,400
Mom, get up. I made some porridge
so you should have some.

462
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,560
No, no.

463
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:53,600
There's no point if I eat
that and keep living.

464
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,320
Mom, what's wrong?

465
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,350
What- why are you like that?

466
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,350
Are you not feeling well?

467
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,210
Oh, yeah, I guess I'm not.

468
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,310
I must have indigestion because I ate
my kimbap too quickly at lunch.

469
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,310
You go ahead and eat, Mom.

470
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:28,780
<i>Oh.. is our Yeon Hee.. pregnant?</i>

471
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:36,630
<i>If our Yeon Hee has a
child for that household..</i>

472
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,230
<i>Wait a second.</i>

473
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,230
<i>Then what happens?</i>

474
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:45,520
<i>Then that means that my Yeon Hee can
become the Baek family's daughter-in-law.</i>

475
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:50,280
<i>Money won't be a problem then, will it?</i>

476
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,450
Mom, what are you thinking
about so seriously?

477
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:58,480
Yeon Hee, I think you're pregnant.

478
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,780
Mom!

479
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,640
Now that I see it,
I really think you are pregnant.

480
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,640
Is your stomach not well?

481
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,820
I'm not, Mom.

482
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,750
Let's go to the hospital.

483
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,420
I said I'm not!

484
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,800
Mom, why are you being like this?

485
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,910
You're not?

486
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,220
Are you really not?

487
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,520
What's the problem if she's
not pregnant right now?

488
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,940
All we need is for her to get pregnant.

489
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:36,730
That household considers
offsprings so important.

490
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,960
Because of the need to have an offspring,
they even got a surrogate.

491
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:46,370
If my Yeon Hee gives birth to
a child for that household...

492
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:53,220
That's right. It isn't like the first son
doesn't have feelings for Yeon Hee.

493
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,700
If he divorces So Weol's niece,

494
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,000
then it's only a matter of time
until Yeon Hee has a chance.

495
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,470
I just spoke to your Father-in-law

496
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,170
and Kang Ho must have figured things out.

497
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,770
They said he came to work
and is working diligently.

498
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,260
You should put yourself at ease now,
nothing's going to happen.

499
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,460
Then will brother-in-law and that
woman really get a divorce?

500
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,050
They said they will, so they probably will.

501
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:31,370
Father-in-law told me to go see her..
what should I do?

502
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:34,340
Should I ask her if they're
definitely going to divorce

503
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,940
and try and see if she has
nothing else planned?

504
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,350
No. Just forget about it.

505
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:42,740
I'll take care of telling
your father-in-law.

506
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,300
If the girl says she won't come back to
this house because they want a divorce,

507
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,510
what can he do?

508
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,570
That's true, but..

509
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,630
Are you going out somewhere?

510
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,760
To pick up Yoo Bin.

511
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,930
Really?

512
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,050
I was about to leave for the gallery.

513
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:01,310
It's been a while since we've been out, why
don't we take Yoo Bin and go to the gallery?

514
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,630
Yes, Mother-in-law.

515
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,130
Alright, finish getting ready and come out.

516
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:13,860
Yes, it's me.

517
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,700
Do you want to come out
and meet me for dinner?

518
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:19,110
It's been so long since the three of us
including Yoo Bin have gone out for dinner.

519
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,050
Dinner tonight?

520
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,290
You came back home

521
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:25,920
and I couldn't even pay much attention to
you because of what happened to Kang Ho.

522
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,370
I'm going with Mother to pick up Yoo Bin
from his kindergarten and go to the gallery.

523
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:34,440
Then leave Yoo Bin with Mother
and just come out by yourself.

524
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,230
Alright.

525
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:49,590
There's still some time left
before school's out.

526
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:50,900
Really?

527
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,460
Mother-in-law,

528
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:56,090
do you want to go inside and
see Yoo Bin in school?

529
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,430
Can we really go see?

530
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:00,180
Of course. We can just look
through the window.

531
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,980
Yes, let's do that.

532
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:05,130
I'm so curious to see if
Yoo Bin in doing well.

533
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,060
Oh my.. who's this?

534
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,100
Come here.

535
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,020
Let go of me!

536
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:41,320
Mother-in-law..

537
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,260
Who's your mother-in-law? Who?!

538
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:47,400
Who do you think you're staring at?!

539
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,120
What have you done right?!

540
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,060
What exactly is it that
I've done wrong to deserve this?

541
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,780
What? You...

542
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:57,250
What right do you have to hang
around Yoo Bin's school?

543
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:01,760
You know the reason,
so why are you being like this?

544
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,000
- Oh my, oh my. How can this girl...?!
- Oh! Mother-in-law!

545
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Let's go, it's time for Yoo Bin to come out.

546
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:12,730
If I were you, I would never
appear before Yoo Bin.

547
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,660
Think carefully about what I'm saying.

548
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,910
Mother-in-law, let's go.
Yoo Bin's about to come out.

549
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,160
Aren't you going to leave?!

550
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,220
What are you going to do
if Yoo Bin sees you?!

551
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:20,500
Mother-in-law, even if that woman
and brother-in-law divorce,

552
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,320
what's the use?

553
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:24,890
She won't even leave Yoo Bin alone.

554
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:27,880
Don't worry about anything.

555
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,460
She's not going to appear
in front of Yoo Bin again.

556
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,650
What right would she have to do so?

557
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,780
If that woman possibly...

558
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,830
Now if she and brother-in-law
are divorced-

559
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,650
What if she tries to take Yoo Bin from us?

560
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:46,470
Why are you thinking about such
a preposterous situation?

561
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:50,220
How could she do something like
that if she hasn't gone insane?

562
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,900
She has no right and no means to do that.

563
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,240
Mother-in-law, I did some research

564
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,080
and in situations like this,

565
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:01,720
if the surrogate mother
files for guardianship,

566
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,700
the child can go to the person who
gave birth, not the one who cared for it.

567
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,150
What? Is that really true?

568
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,270
Yes.

569
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:13,490
What kind of ridiculous situation is that?!

570
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,020
Oh my, that doesn't make any sense!

571
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,020
That's impossible.

572
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:26,830
Yes, it's me.

573
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,740
Is it Sae Hun?

574
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:33,390
I'm at home right now.

575
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:37,510
Mother-in-law had something she needed
to do so we didn't go to the gallery.

576
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:44,240
Yoo Bin's sleeping right now,
so I'll go alone.

577
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:56,120
Honey, what are you thinking about?

578
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:59,730
Are you still uncomfortable around me?

579
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:06,440
Should we leave here?

580
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,810
What do you mean leave?

581
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:11,390
Somewhere very far.

582
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,040
Let's take Yoo Bin and
live somewhere far away.

583
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:18,000
America, or Europe.
Somewhere else is fine too.

584
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:22,040
Why are you saying something
like that so suddenly?

585
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:27,650
I just don't like it here.

586
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,980
I just want to go somewhere abroad to live.

587
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,150
Alright, fine.

588
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:39,480
I was thinking that too.

589
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,760
If you and I went to live
abroad for a few years,

590
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:48,070
wouldn't we be able to forget
all the bad memories?

591
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:50,440
I thought of that too.

592
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:54,460
Then let's start thinking
about it seriously.

593
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,300
Alright.

594
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:02,910
Do you have to go?

595
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:06,120
I promised, so what can I do?

596
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:09,830
I'll just choose the interior design
quickly and be home soon.

597
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:14,260
It's just that being alone at home
with Aunt scares me.

598
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:19,240
So why did you lie like that?

599
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,450
You even used our baby as an excuse!

600
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:22,850
Anyway.

601
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:26,000
I don't know!
I really thought I was hurting.

602
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,370
Okay.

603
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,240
I'll be back soon.

604
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:32,940
Go on.

605
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:40,750
I'll just sleep until Chul comes back.

606
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:47,910
Oh Geum Ja unni! It's been so long.

607
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:49,290
Yes it has!

608
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,290
But what about Uunni?

609
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,150
Who? Oh, my sister?

610
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,130
Yeah.

611
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:58,640
Oh, Unni went to the broadcasting station.

612
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,640
Oh, really?

613
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,850
When is she coming back?

614
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:04,850
Why are you asking about Unni?

615
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:10,330
It's just that I heard
something so unbelievable..

616
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,290
So I wanted to tell your sister about it.

617
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,890
What is it?

618
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:19,670
Tell me! It's the same whether
you tell me or unni.

619
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,410
Well, you have a point.

620
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:27,340
It's just that your niece Seon Young..

621
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,910
No, no, I think it'd be better
if I didn't say anything.

622
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:36,290
Oh unni! What about our Seon Young?

623
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:42,810
I don't know if it's okay that
I tell you something like this.

624
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,430
What is it? Why are you being like that?

625
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:53,210
It's just that.. oh dear..
how could something like this happen?

626
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:56,190
I just heard it on the grapevine,

627
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,640
but you know Seon Young's son Yoo Bin?

628
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:04,860
Seon Young didn't give birth to him,
but a surrogate mother did!

629
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,070
What do you mean a surrogate mother?
What... what is that?

630
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:16,130
You don't even know what that is?

631
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:19,310
Your niece couldn't have children,

632
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:22,700
so she borrowed another woman's
womb to have one!

633
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:26,640
U... unni! Are you insane?

634
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,920
It's been so long since I saw you, and now
you come and say crazy things like that?

635
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:32,740
Oh my, oh my, look at you.

636
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:35,230
Do I look insane to you?

637
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:38,930
Why would I take valuable
time to come look for you?

638
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:43,910
How can she care for a child that
another woman had for her?

639
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:48,540
I heard that that mother-in-law
planned everything and set it up!

640
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,160
That's not all!

641
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:55,950
Your niece's husband cheated on her
and that woman even got pregnant!

642
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,030
Oh-oh my... oh my...

643
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,220
U- u-unnie! This- what- you...

644
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,730
W... what are you talking about now?!

645
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:06,410
If you're going to say things
like that, just go home!!!

646
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:11,220
Hey, you should tell your niece to
come out of that house this instant.

647
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,630
If I were you, I wouldn't let my daughter
live in a place like that.

648
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,160
What time is it?

649
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:19,580
Oh... oh no! Look at me.
I have somewhere I need to go.

650
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,680
Why do I keep forgetting things like this?

651
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,240
I'll be going now!

652
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:29,480
That unni must be crazy.

653
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,170
Aunt...

654
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,330
Aunt, what was that woman talking about?

655
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:49,840
Aunt, have some water and you'll be okay.

656
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:02,400
That unni.. she suddenly came
and why was she being like that?

657
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,870
She must have some sort
of grudge against our family.

658
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,390
Do you think what she said was true?

659
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,920
No. They were all lies.

660
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,950
So you can't ever tell anyone, okay?

661
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:18,550
Who would I tell something like this to?

662
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,190
Don't tell Chul either.

663
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:25,740
If she knows, my sister,
your mother-in-law will die.

664
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,510
Don't worry! I won't ever tell anyone!

665
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:30,690
I'll take it to the grave.

666
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:39,580
Oh my.. my sister-in-law had
a child through a surrogate?

667
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,580
How could this happen?

668
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:46,460
That's right.. I thought it was really weird
how she and Yoo Bin looked nothing alike.

669
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,940
Of course. Who would I tell this to?

670
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,740
I can't ever tell.

671
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:05,450
Where did you go?

672
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,210
I had something I needed to do.

673
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:12,780
Come sit here.

674
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:24,730
Tell me the truth.

675
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:27,550
What's the reason you want a divorce?

676
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,500
For various reasons.

677
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:33,830
What are the various reasons?

678
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:35,450
Mom,

679
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:40,830
can't I tell you later when
everything gets cleared up?

680
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,490
<i>Mom!</i>

681
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:44,720
Mom! Mom! Mom!

682
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:48,500
Hey! Why are you running so breathless?

683
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:52,810
No, no, it's nothing.

684
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:54,510
If I tell you, it'll cause huge problems.

685
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:56,380
What is it?

686
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,750
Eun Nim, you didn't know either?

687
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,230
What?

688
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,750
You know that child Yoo Bin?

689
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,860
I heard that my sister-in-law
didn't give birth to him!

690
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:05,880
What??

691
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,100
What?

692
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:13,910
If she didn't give birth to him,
did someone else?

693
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,060
It seems forged or something.

694
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:20,300
If someone else had him, then that's that.
What's forged mean?

695
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,010
Well you see, that...

696
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:24,960
No, I can't say.

697
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,110
I'm so curious now! Tell me, you brat!

698
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:32,840
Mom, so, you see, our sister-in-law
couldn't conceive,

699
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,280
so she used a surrogate to have him!

700
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,990
<i>Oh... oh... oh my... oh my!</i>

701
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:39,570
A surrogate?!

702
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,080
But, w... what is that?

703
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,760
Hey, this is a secret so don't
act like you know!

704
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,530
A rumor like this can't get out.

705
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:48,970
<i>Just keep it to yourself!</i>

706
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:55,420
Where are you going when you just got home?

707
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:00,200
Mom, why is she like that?
Her face looks like death.

708
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,180
Mom, is Eun Nim really getting a divorce?

709
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:06,030
Ah, I don't know! Your father's so upset
about her that he's on the brink of death.

710
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:08,380
But why is she getting a divorce?

711
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,330
They couldn't live without each other.

712
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:12,460
She won't say!

713
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:15,570
If I knew, I wouldn't feel so frustrated.

714
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:25,500
Ahjumma, it's me. Let's meet right now.

715
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,160
Why do you want to meet?

716
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,580
I have something to say.

717
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,020
Something to say?

718
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:36,430
Okay.

719
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:46,710
Fine, I'll meet her and try to
figure out what's happening.

720
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,840
Ohh.. my money..

721
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,940
My money...

722
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,290
Ahjumma, come with me.

723
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:06,030
W... why are you like this?

724
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:07,680
Where do you want to go?

725
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,520
Go with me to the police station.

726
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,940
What?

727
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:12,300
The police station?

728
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,020
Why the police station?

729
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:18,380
We'll just tell the police everything

730
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:20,280
and receive our punishment
so everything will be over.

731
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:23,720
What are you saying?

732
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,310
Ahjumma,

733
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:29,480
why are you going around
telling people about Yoo Bin?

734
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:31,560
What do you want to happen to Yoo Bin?

735
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:48,510
You keep saying we should
go to the police station..

736
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:53,130
But if we go and confess,
I'm not the only one who'll be punished.

737
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:54,830
You'll be punished too!

738
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:58,690
Ahjumma, I'm not scared at
all of getting punished.

739
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:01,230
I'm even getting a divorce.

740
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,300
I left that house as well.

741
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:05,260
You really...

742
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,860
Why are you doing this to me?!

743
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,980
What did I do wrong?

744
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:10,670
Ahjumma,

745
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,380
why are you going around
telling people about Yoo Bin?

746
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,240
Oh... oh my...

747
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:20,780
<i>what I told So Weol at her house
must have gotten out.</i>

748
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:24,020
<i>How can it be out this quickly?</i>

749
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:27,160
Ahjumma,

750
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:30,190
I'm begging you.

751
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:32,520
Just leave Yoo Bin alone.

752
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:35,930
I don't care what happens to me.

753
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:39,130
If Yoo Bin finds out about this..

754
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,910
Ahjumma,

755
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,720
I'm not joking around.

756
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:55,140
If you tell people about Yoo Bin
one more time, I won't sit still.

757
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:04,520
Oh... oh my... how could she have realized?

758
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,880
She seems like she's going to do something
about this immediately.

759
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:10,530
I was scared to death!

760
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:20,550
But why is nothing happening when
even Eun Nim found out that I told?

761
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:34,720
What are you doing here?

762
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:37,340
I have something I need to tell you.

763
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:46,720
Tomorrow if you have time,
let's meet at the lawyer's office

764
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,350
to finalize the divorce.

765
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,760
Okay.

766
01:00:56,050 --> 01:01:00,530
But did you come all this
way just to tell me that?

767
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:03,340
You could've just told me over the phone.

768
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:08,360
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

769
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:09,990
Wait a second.

770
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:28,590
Here.

778
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:01,680
<i>Where did your wedding band go?
You had it on before!</i>

779
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,220
<i>Hey! Are you really going to get a divorce?!</i>

780
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,740
I told you to get out!!

781
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:08,510
<i>Is it true that Seon Young didn't
give birth to Yoo Bin?</i>

782
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:09,630
<i>How did you...</i>

783
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:12,460
<i>I heard that the girl you were
seeing is pregnant!</i>

784
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:15,440
<i>Our Seon Young doesn't know anything.</i>

785
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,700
<i>Yoo Bin, are you drawing your mom's face?</i>

786
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,480
Her hairstyle is different.

787
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,000
This is Aunt.

788
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,980
<i>The homework topic is A Face I Miss.</i>

789
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,540
Hey! Go Eun Nim!

790
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,930
<i>I'm not going to divorce Eun Nim.</i>

791
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:32,360
I can't.

792
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,450
<i>Why do we have to?</i>
