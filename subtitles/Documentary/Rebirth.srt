
2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,540
I wake up in the
middle of the night

3
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,630
Every night ...
it's been 4 years

4
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,730
I hear a cry in my sleep

5
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,210
The voice of
a baby screaming

6
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,410
calling me for help

7
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,250
I wake up and look around

8
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,310
Erina is not here

9
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,260
Although I am a mother

10
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,330
Her warm embrace
cannot soothe my pain

11
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,390
Some said
"make another baby"

12
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,970
How can they
be so insensitive

13
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,390
Until she came back

14
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,000
I thought I would
go crazy

15
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,490
As a couple

16
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,550
Erina was our treasure

17
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,690
But the Erina
who came back

18
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,260
of course is our child

19
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,660
But

20
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,620
the little
4 year-old Erina

21
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,870
Does not see us

22
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,270
as her real parents

23
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,450
She thinks her abductor
is her real mother

24
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,950
She loves her

25
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,880
Do you know how painful

26
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,990
how sad this is?

27
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,060
That woman

28
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,800
Has robbed the whole family

29
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,500
The pain of our family

30
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,650
Even as Erina is back
still continues

31
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,620
That woman

32
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,520
Stole not only
Erina's body

33
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,530
But her heart also

34
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,030
One who takes a life
gets the death penalty

35
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,600
But she took the heart
of a whole family

36
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,900
And there is no death
penalty for her

37
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,530
This is why I say ...

38
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,900
Give us back
our happiness

39
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,000
Etsuko told me:

40
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,760
"You are bare like 
a tree in winter"

41
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,800
"You got pregnant from Hiroshi
 but terminated it"

42
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,740
"now it went bad and
you can't conceive anymore"

43
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,940
"That's the price you pay
 for killing a baby"

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,380
When Etsuko got pregnant

45
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,920
I thought I had to take
a distance from Hiroshi

46
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,080
But I was too weak
 I couldn't

47
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,890
Etsuko was calling
every day

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,690
Crying for her
husband to return

49
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,700
or the next day talking
about Hiroshi's sex life

50
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,820
taking pleasure in
an open discussion

51
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,130
an other day
verbally abusing me

52
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,760
she kept calling
every day

53
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,870
She seemed almost crazy

54
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,540
when I heard
the baby was born

55
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,840
I just wanted to take
a glance at the baby

56
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,610
one look and that
would be enough

57
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,160
then I would forget everything
change place and job

58
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,690
Start a new life with
my dad's inheritance

59
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,860
It was all set
in my heart

60
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,530
Kaoru ...

61
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,930
Little Kaoru

62
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,130
...protect this child

63
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,170
I will protect
this child

64
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,370
Her smile would
comfort me

65
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,210
would forgive that ...

66
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,310
I had killed my baby
in the womb

67
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,390
tried to steal
a married man

68
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,450
for all these

69
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,890
she would be
my forgiveness

70
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,860
this is ...
what I thought

71
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,140
"In a baby's most
tender years"

72
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,110
"the accused took her
away from her parents"

73
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,110
"at a time when a child
needs affection most"

74
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,740
"she dispossessed her"

75
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,020
"That little Erina's emotional
scars will remain"

76
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,140
"is also a concern"

77
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,150
"Despite the cruelty
of the crime"

78
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,050
"The accused doesn't
reconsider her act"

79
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,060
"or show any sign of regret"

80
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,860
"it is useless to expect
any sincere remorse"

81
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,500
"And in the view
of these facts"

82
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,730
"We apply the sentence
of 6 years imprisonment"

83
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,770
"We have given this penalty
due consideration"

84
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,210
Let the accused
come to the bar

85
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,190
This is the end
of the trial

86
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,760
Does the accused
want to say something?

87
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,330
If you do
please be concise

88
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,070
Until I was arrested

89
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,300
I would pray
every day of my life

90
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,300
and every day, all day

91
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,310
to live with Kaoru

92
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,080
And I lived praying
continuously

93
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,320
For four year

94
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,230
I was allowed to taste
the joy of motherhood

95
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,790
I would like to thank
Mr. and Mrs. Akiyama

96
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,360
Wouldn't you rather apologize
than thank them?

97
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,070
There is no word
of apology

98
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,800
Just die!

99
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,970
Why don't you die!

100
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,980
Please calm down

[John Mayer - Daughters]
I know a girl

103
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:40,860
she puts the color
inside of my world

104
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,420
But she's just
like a maze

105
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:52,440
Where all of the walls
all continually change

106

00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,230
What kind of help?

150
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,660
I did not actually get married

151
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,670
I lived together
with this kid's father

152
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,770
but I ran away

153
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,640
Why?

154
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,540
He was hitting the baby

155
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,880
So I decided to take
the child and run

156
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,910
Tell me Kiwa, could
this person be ...?

No way! Of course not

I Broke with up with
that other guy long ago

160
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,420
He was so mean

161
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,710
Although he was married

162
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,600
He told you he'd leave
if you cheated on him

163
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,260
I thought of going
myself and yell at him

164
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,600
Yasue, typical

165
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,610
Remember our teacher
 was smoking in class

166
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,750
You started getting

00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,800
I don't need money

333
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,750
Stop seeing me in
secret from Mom

334
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,580
Please accept it

335
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,420
I'm fine, really

336
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,090
How about School?

337
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,700
It's Summer vacation

338
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,890
Are you eating enough?

339
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,600
How about you Dad?
You're eating properly?

340
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,800
Mom prepares meals
for you?

341
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:49,740
Well

342
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,540
Mom's in good health?

343
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,820
She finally got used
to you being away

344
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,450
Really

345
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,380
She's sad

346
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,620
you should call sometimes

347
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,030
You don't have to play
the father part on me

348
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,400
It does not suit you at all

349
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,100
Is that right

350
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,440
Maybe right

351
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,950
Yeah

352
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,550
See you

353
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,560
She says she's been taken

354
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,930
to a couple of
strangers place

355
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,000
So she ran away

356
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,310
Kaoru can you
tell me again?

357
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,470
Erina

358
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,840
Little Erina!

359
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,230
You give us so much worry
what a bad kid

360
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,480
You hate our home
that much?

361
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,950
Such a bad kid doesn't
belong to this family

362
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,150
Enough now
she is scared

363
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,220
Please Erina

364
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,510
Please, don't run
again, please

365
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,920
Etsuko, let's go home

366
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,720
Please don't go anywhere

367
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,950
Let's go home

368
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,790
Erina let's go back

369
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,160
Sorry for the trouble

370
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,660
OK, let's go home

371
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,900
"Write the truth
in your diary"

372
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,530
"No need to feel ashamed"

373
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,740
"I'm embarrassed
when people see me"

374
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,510
"The end"

375
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,210
You want me to
sing your song

376
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,520
Erina do you like songs?

377
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,720
Sing the song
of the Star

378
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:18,880
OK

379
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,920
Twinkle, twinkle
little star

380
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,930
No not this one

381
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,570
Not this one

382
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,670
It 's not this one

383
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,940
Well

384
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,210
The stars twinkle
in the sky

385
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,940
Not that one

386
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,910
You know

387
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,240
Ah right

388
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:45,650
So, what could I sing

389
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,090
Why do you do
that to me!?

390
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,690
Why is that?

391
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:58,220
Why? Why?

392
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,600
Why?

393
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,440
I'm sorry Mom

394
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,560
I'm sorry ...

395
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,700
Etsuko!

396
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,270
I'm sorry Mom

397
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,130
You're hurting me!

398
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,710
Stop

399
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:12,250
I'm sorry Mom ...

400
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,240
Stay calm!

401
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,110
I'm sorry Mom ...

402
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,650
I'm sorry
I'm sorry Mom

403
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,280
I'm sorry Mom

404
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,700
A Souvenir

405
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,840
What are you doing
at this hour?

406
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,210
I was an examiner in today's
Exam but they canceled

407
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,980
I came running
how stupid of me

408
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,240
Sorry it's not a good time

409
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,730
I missed you so much

410
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,880
How about you? Did you miss me?

411
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,970
The cake is wasted

412
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:20,240
You dropped it

413
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,280
Makes no difference 
once it's swallowed

414
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,280
Tastes just the same

415
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:33,010
When you quit my classes
I thought you'd met someone

416
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,150
it's not that

417
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:39,020
I was trying to forget you

418
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:42,760
But I can't forget

419
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:45,280
I thought if I could
stay away for a month?

420
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:47,470
I'd forget you

421
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,110
Why do you say that?

422
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,910
I don't know, anymore

423
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:57,470
How does love feel?

424
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,880
How can we stop loving
someone we loved?

425
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,110
You don't need to stop

426
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,710
You and me 
we are solid

427
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,170
Are you working 
all summer vacation?

428
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,290
Yeah

429
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,500
Such a job 
you have there

430
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:24,300
Living on my own I have
to see for everything

431
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,240
I would be a terrible mother

432
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,740
I thought you'd come
back as soon as I call

433
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,370
I was wrong

434
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:34,910
You are tough
you live your life

435
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:37,850
Flatter me

436
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,460
You're doing fine

437
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:49,800
Enough

438
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:52,460
Struggle on your own

439
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:55,070
You finally appreciate 
your parents

440
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,840
Ah, I don't want 
to return work

441
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:03,810
What if you 
didn't return?

442
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,070
Don't say that

443
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,840
Really I don't 
want to go back

444
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,870
I love you

445
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,100
What do love in me?

446
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:32,040
The smiles you 
give only to me

447
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:37,110
and when we part
the rear side of you

448
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,510
How about you?

449
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,410
What do you love in me?

450
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:47,150
the lies you make
when you're exposed

451
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,950
Can't you find 
something better

452
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,600
Thanks for your kindness

453
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,470
Her husband 
threw her out

454
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,380
she has nowhere to go

455
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:42,360
She's asleep

456
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:43,970
a girl, right?

457
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:45,630
Let's do the 
formalities tomorrow

458
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:48,140
Just the paperwork tonight
then you can rest

459
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,750
The application 
Mrs. Bani

460
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,510
Yes

461
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,240
If you please

462
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:33,710
Good morning

463
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,290
Good morning

464
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:53,610
Oh! It's shorter

465
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,740
A prospective 
member has come

466
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:40,150
You are welcome

467
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,160
Make yourself 
at home

468
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:57,410
This is the 
"House of Angel"

469
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,030
When Humans do stupid things

470
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:03,510
Angel Always come to the rescue

471
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,410
as long as you are here

472
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,080
Angel will thoroughly
fulfill her mission

473
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:11,850
when a human does 
a stupid thing

474
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,680
I have to come and help

475
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,070
Your child's so cute

476
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,540
And Who are you?

477
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,240
You do everything 
that you're told, right?

478
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:52,560
You're a woman?

479
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,720
Yes

480
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,890
Why Do you think so?

481
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,390
Because I am not a man

482
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,230
What do you mean by that?

483
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:14,240
And what do you think 
about yourself?

484
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,720
I'm nothing

485
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:19,720
How that?

486
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:22,760
Then, how do you consider 
yourself a woman?

487
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,330
You had an abortion

488
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:43,470
I'm talking to 
you from my soul

489
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:47,670
So please talk 
from your soul too

490
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:52,340
You don't talk of worldly 
things through your soul

491
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:56,250
If one is old or young
man or woman

492
00:50:56,530 --> 00:51:00,590
If she has money or not

493
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:07,500
Isn't it futile chatter?

494
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,730
It's good to drop 
one's obsessions

495
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:17,970
About being a 
man or a woman

496
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:23,510
If you can let go 
of it, you're happy

497
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:27,780
This is what it means 
to live from the soul

498
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,690
You don't mean anything

499
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:33,660
Really?

500
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:35,850
Simply

501
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,940
I want to go live 
with this child

502
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:46,610
To me

503
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,270
This child means 
everything

504
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:51,940
Somehow

505
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,610
Please help me

506
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,820
I got it

507
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:04,290
Please help me!

508
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,490
I got it

509
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:09,000
In this place

510
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,430
people are reborn as 
angels in this world

511
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,770
There are several rules

512
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:16,960
Sarai and the others 
will tell you

513
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:19,300
Listen carefully

514
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:20,430
Yes

515
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:23,840
This way, please

516
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:38,690
In charge of farm work

517
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,360
Ms. Abel

518
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,390
Ms. Esther

519
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:44,560
Ms. Tobit

520
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:46,660
Ms. Bani

521
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:48,770
Ms. Ezekiel

522
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,510
That’s it

523
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:10,750
Why is that?

524
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:13,790
I thought I heard Kaoru cry

525
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:17,030
She’s fine, she’s looked after

526
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:20,360
The baby is the treasure
of House of Angel

527
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:54,870
She’s not here

528
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,700
There is so much 
to do now:

529
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,500
Crawl, touch, walk

530
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:05,080
Soon you can 
speak with Mom

531
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:09,580
I wish I gave 
birth to a girl

532
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:12,550
Then he would have
left her when he went

533
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,990
You know

534
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,660
my boy was taken away
by my husband

535
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:23,430
Or rather by my 
husband’s mother

536
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:26,630
I lost him in court

537
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:30,430
Without money I couldn’t
get parental authority

538
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:32,970
They wouldn't let
you meet him?

539
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,870
hmm

540
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:41,180
Angel takes away 
the sadness

541
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:42,940
but I can’t

542
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,980
I just can’t

543
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:51,750
His name’s Hikaru

544
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,920
Although he's a boy 
his name's Hikaru

545
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,720
It's a good name

546
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:58,860
That’s right
I gave it to him

547
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,540
This kid is Rebecca

548
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:11,840
And you're Ruth

549
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,050
Angel gave you a name

550
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:19,050
Ruth and Rebecca

551
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,520
As you received it 
today from Angel

552
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,680
It’s become your birthday

553
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:25,450
From today you’re 
official members

554
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,090
of House of Angel

555
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:30,570
your old birthday 
and your old name

556
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:32,630
have both become 
useless luggage

557
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:34,500
You can leave behind 
you the pain

558
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,090
Let's help each 
other live

559
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,770
Happy Birthday

560
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:40,940
Happy Birthday

561
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:45,680
doh-bee-dah
was-was-waaaa

562
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:52,010
Happy birthday to you

563
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:42,000
I'm sorry to bother you

564
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,130
Alright, alright

565
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,110
You called me because
you remembered something

566
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:50,170
Here

567
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,200
Ah thanks

568
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,920
You read it thoroughly

569
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,570
Yes

570
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,720
You always eat 
on your own?

571
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,120
Why on your own?

572
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,950
It’s stress-free

573
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,590
Really

574
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,160
So maybe you have
things to say?

575
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,890
What do you remember?

576
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,620
What?

577
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:11,760
Shall we go?

578
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:12,890
uh?

579
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:17,570
Aah summer’s over

580
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:20,600
I didn’t go anywhere 
again this year

581
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:22,570
Did you go somewhere?

582
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,070
I had to work

583
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,580
Sure

584
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,810
A person has to work

585
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:30,710
Excuse me

586
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,880
How do you eat?

587
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:34,980
Uh?

588
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,920
How do you organize 
your life?

589
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:41,320
I live an easy life

590
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:42,790
my mother has 
an apartment

591
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,800
she doesn’t say anything
even when I don't work

592
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,970
This is no thing 
to be proud of

593
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:51,870
Well

594
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,970
I think I have 
a child on the way

595
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:59,210
With whom could I discuss it?

596
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,810
Other than my parent

597
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,250
To your friends?

598
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,150
I don’t have anyone

599
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:08,220
Are you saying 
you're pregnant?

600
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:10,350
I don't know yet ...

601
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:14,090
Your boyfriend is 
that kind of stalker?

602
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,060
Mr. Kishida is 
not a stalker

603
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,220
Oh ...

604
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:24,330
Did you tell him?

605
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:25,670
Not yet

606
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:26,930
Why?

607
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:30,280
Kishida has a wife
and a kid on his own

608
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,310
So you like him

609
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:38,680
I don't know whether 
I like him or not

610
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:44,790
Are the cicadas gone?

611
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:47,960
When I told you Cicadas die
soon after coming out

612
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,860
You were not surprised

613
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:53,070
They live 7 days
it’s quite alright…

614
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:57,730
…if they all die
together the 7th day

615
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,360
it's not particularly sad

616
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,700
It's the same 
for all of them

617
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:06,720
But suppose one 
survived the 8th day

618
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,780
All her friends 
have died

619
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,340
It is a sad situation

620
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:25,360
What?

621
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,130
Toilet

622
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,230
I just bought it
I'm checking it

623
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:30,740
What here? Now?

624
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,270
Now I'm drunk

625
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:36,470
Whatever the result
I won't be scared

626
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,290
You have to pee on this

627
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:53,490
If it doesn’t reach the
blue line, your fine

628
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:49,370
We'll think about it

629
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:51,550
Sure, take your time

630
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:53,080
Thanks

631
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:55,820
We haven't had lunch
 in a long time

632
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,080
We need to talk

633
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:58,920
Before that, cheers!

634
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:00,320
Cheers

635
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,960
What would you do
if I was pregnant?

636
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,430
I’m saying "if"

637
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,860
But you're still 
a student

638
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:13,130
It means we keep it?

639
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,040
or do I have 
an abortion?

640
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,540
Of course I'd 
like to keep it

641
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:20,310
But right in 
this juncture

642
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,380
Practically 
it's difficult

643
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,320
At some point 
it will be OK?

644
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:26,020
Of course it will

645
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,180
I would like 
to live with you

646
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:32,160
Once you graduate

647
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:35,590
Once my little one doesn't
need my help anymore

648
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,960
In the meantime
we'll be very prudent

649
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,530
I told you many times

650
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:44,070
Why are you laughing?

651
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:47,380
You look like my father
when you talk like that

652
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:49,840
Your Father? 
What about him?

653
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:51,280
Nothing

654
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:54,410
Are you pregnant?

655
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:57,140
I told you
I said "if"

656
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:58,980
You're shocked?

657
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:01,050
Of course I am

658
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,420
Don't stress me

659
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:04,890
Alright let's eat

660
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:05,990
OK

661
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:15,300
How is it?

662
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,430
Yeah

663
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:21,170
Umm ... Mr. Kishida

664
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:24,040
What I couldn't 
say until now

665
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,410
What now?

666
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,410
I wasn't raised 
in a normal family

667
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:33,450
You celebrated birthdays

668
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:35,280
You would go to fireworks

669
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:36,980
Or to see blossoming sakura

670
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:39,460
you also had Christmas Parties

671
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:42,390
But I had none of 
this in my family

672
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,260
All this is I did for 
the first time with you

673
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:50,370
You taught me many things

674
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:53,470
There are so many
fun things you said

675
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:57,340
You taught me that

676
01:02:57,950 --> 01:02:59,940
So where do you want
to go next time

677
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,470
We won't meet anymore

678
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:07,490
I really thought 
I couldn't end it

679
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:10,120
But we won't 
meet anymore

680
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:14,360
Thank you for everything

681
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,230
You said you loved
everything about me

682
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:27,230
Thank you

683
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:47,560
[WOMEN'S CLINIC]

684
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:16,750
Now it is

685
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:19,390
exactly this big 
she said

686
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:20,650
What do you 
mean by that?

687
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,090
They gave it to me
at the clinic

688
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,290
it's cute

689
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:24,330
Isn't it

690
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:25,630
Do you keep 
the baby?

691
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:26,990
I keep it

692
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:28,300
Is that right

693
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,700
How do you plan 
to raise it?

694
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,340
Did you tell 
Mr. Kishida?

695
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:39,070
You didn't

696
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:42,180
You're an adult, you should
find the strength to tell him

697
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:44,020
It won't happen

698
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,140
He runs away 
from the hassle

699
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:49,110
You fell in love 
with a mean guy

700
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:51,790
You told me so

701
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:54,150
"It's not your fault" 
you said

702
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,690
Did I say that?

703
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,760
You were one 
of the few

704
01:04:58,070 --> 01:05:00,190
to talk to me 
like that

705
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,760
Only you and Kishida

706
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:07,470
I hated it

707
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,370
My mother was 
yelling and crying

708
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,310
I thought everything 
was my fault

709
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:20,820
I finally understood 
I was not alone

710
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,490
not alone?

711
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:27,630
It's because my family 
had been broken

712
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,090
My Father's mistress 
was an abductor

713
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:32,170
She was wanted nationwide

714
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:35,790
He was working irregularly 
drinking too much

715
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:38,700
My mother had enough of him

716
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:42,240
She was always out
not much at home

717
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:46,000
The meals were always side dishes
from the supermarket

718
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:50,180
I hated it
I got used to it

719
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:54,790
But when I was in 
elementary school

720
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:57,490
There was a birthday 
party for a kid

721
01:05:57,590 --> 01:06:01,390
He showed family videos
when he was a baby

722
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,520
It's no big deal
I'll show you mine

723
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,670
There it was on this video

724
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:11,270
All the love and care 
I hadn't received

725
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:14,810
What my parents said 
was right

726
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:17,410
It's all Kiwako 
Nonomiya's fault

727
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:18,810
If it wasn't for 
Kiwako Nonomiya

728
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:21,140
Our home would 
have been normal

729
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:25,620
Mom was kind
dad used to laugh

730
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,690
A usual home 
as any other

731
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:32,620
That woman is 
public enemy #1

732
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:35,160
She messed up 
our family

733
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:39,860
I felt so bad I vomited
when I came back

734
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:42,700
OK, let's eat

735
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,430
OK

736
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:49,340
Thank you

737
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:51,340
Good appetite

738
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,780
Good appetite

739
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:07,560
Why are you 
so kind to me?

740
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,390
You need material 
for your article

741
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:12,590
I want to go some place

742
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:18,500
I need you to go there

743
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:19,900
What do you mean?

744
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,240
I have to go there

745
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:26,240
I can't do it on my own

746
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:28,680
With you I could make it

747
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,620
Isn't it what you think?

748
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:33,690
If I was that girl
I would just go

749
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,790
When things get better let's
make a trip to gather data

750
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:40,880
Gather data?

751
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,220
The place where you 
lived with Kiwako, and all

752
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:44,300
Why?

753
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,490
There's no need to go

754
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,760
There's nothing 
I want to see

755
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,930
The House of Angel 
for example

756
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,880
You were called Rika

757
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,640
You were Rebecca
but they called you Rika

758
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:01,480
And Kiwako was 
called Ruth

759
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:03,240
All characters 
of the Bible

760
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:08,450
You were there 
with Kiwako

761
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,390
We grew up 
as sisters

762
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,520
You don't 
remember me

763
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:23,400
"Maggie opened an 
umbrella immediately"

764
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:26,600
"Ha, you won't 
get wet like this"

765
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:29,300
"And you won't 
get cold"

766
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:32,350
"Ahaha, funny, funny!"

767
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:35,950
"But as Maggie 
drinks tea"

768
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:38,010
"It's raining heavily"

769
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:40,580
"Keeps falling heavily"

770
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:44,460
"Suddenly the whole 
place became a sea"

771
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:47,560
What is a sea?

772
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:50,690
Rika, you've never 
been to the sea

773
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:52,960
Have you ever been 
there, Maron?

774
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:54,830
I have

775
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:59,700
"The waves are 
rolling and rolling"

776
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,670
"...rolling and rolling"

777
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:04,270
"The water runs all over"

778
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,310
It's so big.

779
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:09,980
These guys are 
brainwashed

780
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,850
They rip you off your
money, a scary gang

781
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:16,010
They're gonna fool you

782
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,550
House of Angel please
give me my family back

783
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:20,460
Give it back

784
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:23,220
I want to hear the 
voice of my mother

785
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,330
They came again

786
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:31,630
They're coming in

787
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:36,740
Nobue

788
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,740
Come back!

789
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:45,580
Nobue

790
01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:51,620
Mommy! Mommy!

791
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:53,790
Mommy! Mommy!

792
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:57,860
Maron!

793
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,830
Maron! Quick!

794
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:06,070
Kaoru! Kaoru! Kaoru!

795
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:10,400
All right, all right

796
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:11,880
Don't cry Kaoru

797
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:14,950
Hold me tight

798
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:41,140
When you come 
visit please call

799
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:42,770
You surprised me

800
01:10:43,650 --> 01:10:45,770
Yeah I'm sorry

801
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:49,110
Are you going to eat?

802
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:50,840
I don't need to

803
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:52,810
How about School?

804
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:54,820
You go regularly?

805
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:56,480
Yeah ...

806
01:10:56,990 --> 01:10:58,650
I'd like to quit

807
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:01,460
I'm pregnant

808
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:02,720
Into the 4th 
months now

809
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:05,690
So I came to 
borrow money

810
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:09,400
I swear I'll pay 
you back when I work

811
01:11:10,110 --> 01:11:11,660
The father

812
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:15,100
He looks like dad

813
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:19,440
There is a family but
he won't be a father

814
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:23,840
Please have an abortion

815
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:27,110
I'll pay for it

816
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:30,990
Please have an abortion!

817
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:33,650
I'll take you 
now to a clinic

818
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,210
Please terminate 
such kid's pregnancy

819
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:35,890
No way!

820
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,730
Calm down
listen to her

821
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:39,830
You're not going to raise it
there's not even a father

822
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:40,660
That much I know

823
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:41,120
So

824
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:42,500
Mom

825
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,830
What did you say 
to that woman?

826
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:47,830
"I can't believe she's 
having an abortion"

827
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,980
"You're bare as 
a tree in winter"

828
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:51,480
You told her, right?

829
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:55,740
It's a lie

830
01:11:57,050 --> 01:11:58,580
It's a lie

831
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,880
It's all because 
that woman is paranoid

832
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,930
Me

833
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:09,890
I'll keep it

834
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,830
So I won't have 
abduct someone's kid

835
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:16,800
I'll raise her alone

836
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:25,780
Why is it you 
can't forget?

837
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:28,080
It's been 20 years now

838
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:29,810
Just forget

839
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:34,050
You know how important
you are to me

840
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:35,680
How can I express
how much you mean?

841
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,490
Why would you believe 
what she said?

842
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:42,690
You don't listen to a word
I say, but you trust her

843
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:43,860
Mom

844
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:45,800
You don't even consider
me as your mother

845
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,930
You want to hurt me, right?

846
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:48,930
Not at all

847
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:50,280
You think, if I 
hadn't been there

848
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:52,730
it would all have 
been much simpler

849
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:55,010
The person who took you
away from your life

850
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:56,730
You believe it's me
right?

851
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:57,540
You're wrong

852
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,670
What am I wrong about?

853
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:00,590
You always saw 
me like that

854
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:01,050
Etsuko!

855
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:04,780
I wanted to be a 
perfectly normal mother!

856
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:08,860
To offer you a 
normal childhood

857
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:11,220
When I see a girl 
Smile to her mother

858
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,260
I'm so envious 
I could scream

859
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,270
Mom

860
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:28,010
I'm sorry

861
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:33,080
But you know

862
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:35,840
I don't want to

863
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:40,020
"become bare like 
a tree in winter"

864
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:53,030
Why didn't I take you 
in the car that day

865
01:13:56,670 --> 01:14:00,870
Why did I leave you 
back home that day

866
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:15,920
What should I do?

867
01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:23,330
I want you to love me?

868
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:28,990
What should I do?

869
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:32,600
Mom

870
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:54,010
I often played house 
with you here

871
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:55,850
I Don't remember

872
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:57,120
sure

873
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:59,720
You we're only three

874
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:01,300
Tell me

875
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:04,020
What was it 
here exactly?

876
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,370
Well, a kind of 
women's shelter

877
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:12,400
The staff at House of Angel
knew Kiwako was the abductor

878
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,870
and they hid her

879
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,870
Ah really?

880
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:18,000
The person Angel wanted

881
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:20,880
was not Kiwako 
but you I think

882
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:22,410
Me?

883
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,140
Why?

884
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:27,380
They wanted a 
purely bred angel

885
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:31,220
An angel untouched by the world
untouched by men

886
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:51,140
When the Asahara cult gassed
Tokyo subway in 1995

887
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:54,040
The press decided we were
a cult too and attacked us

888
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:57,870
10 years ago Mother Angel 
died, it all petered out

889
01:16:57,990 --> 01:17:00,320
Finally an executive 
took the money and fled

890
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:02,150
So it was over

891
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:07,790
Looking at this wall

892
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:10,930
even today I'm stressed 
and nauseous

893
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,310
In this place

894
01:17:58,050 --> 01:18:02,910
They wanted to 
lead an inquiry

895
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:07,240
Who wanted that?

896
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:08,860
The press?

897
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:10,390
The police?

898
01:18:11,130 --> 01:18:13,460
Let them investigate 
what they wish

899
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,290
We didn't do 
anything wrong

900
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:18,590
It's not like we're
kidnapping people

901
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,200
Not to worry

902
01:18:21,370 --> 01:18:24,270
There they speak the
language of the world

903
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:27,930
They are not speaking
with their soul

904
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:32,070
Whatever they ask you

905
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,370
never answer them

906
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,140
Al-right?

907
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:41,850
Yes

908
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:45,060
As usual today

909
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,990
Each one to her chore

910
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:50,190
Please start 
your own meeting

911
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:02,100
Mother Angel! Please ...

912
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:05,140
when the families 
came to protest

913
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:06,510
Why didn't you 
deliver the person

914
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:08,310
That

915
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:14,010
Those who came here seeking
refuge can't be expelled

916
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:18,350
People come to live here
away from their circumstances

917
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:24,160
Do you understand? Ruth

918
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:27,880
For Ruth and Rebecca

919
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:34,500
I pray for angels to visit us

920
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:26,220
Mama, mama, 
where are you going?

921
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,720
Mama, where 
are you going?

922
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:30,290
Mama, mama!

923
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,590
Kaoru please
keep silent

924
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:36,530
I want to play 
with Maron

925
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:37,970
I know, I know

926
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:40,370
I want to play 
with Maron

927
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:47,450
Kaoru it's OK?

928
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:49,470
I want to play 
with Maron

929
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:52,750
Go down to there ...

930
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,160
There

931
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:00,390
Mom, I want to 
play with Maron

932
01:21:00,490 --> 01:21:03,190
Mom, I want to 
play with Maron

933
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:04,700
Enough now!

934
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,160
It's OK Kaoru

935
01:21:14,710 --> 01:21:16,770
We're not coming 
back here

936
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:27,650
Ruth!

937
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:30,610
Take this

938
01:21:31,690 --> 01:21:32,560
Rika, I ...

939
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:34,560
Do not let 
go of Kaoru

940
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,200
Stay with her
until she is big

941
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:39,800
From now on
forever

942
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:47,070
Go

943
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:07,090
Kaoru

944
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:08,750
Come on ...

945
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:12,090
Here, let's go

946
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:14,360
It's so tight

947
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:26,840
Kaoru

948
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:41,380
Mom it's dark

949
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:44,420
Look Kaoru

950
01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:46,720
The starry sky

951
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:48,390
Stars?

952
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:54,170
Those twinkling 
dots are stars

953
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,400
You saw them in 
a picture book

954
01:23:57,510 --> 01:23:59,370
Hey Mom

955
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:02,270
It's Scary

956
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:04,640
There's nothing
to be afraid of

957
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:07,610
With me you're safe

958
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:10,750
Come

959
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,590
Mom

960
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,350
What sweetie?

961
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:26,900
Sing your song
... for me

962
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:30,370
Which song?

963
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:32,430
Alright

964
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:33,970
Then

965
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:37,430
I sing the song 
of the Star

966
01:24:39,650 --> 01:24:45,710
"Look up at the sky"

967
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:52,490
"The stars at night"

968
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:59,220
"There's a small star"

969
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:04,440
"A small light"

970
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:11,240
"A modest happiness"

971
01:25:11,550 --> 01:25:16,540
"singing"

972
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:24,450
"Look up at the sky"

973
01:25:24,830 --> 01:25:30,660
"The stars at night"

974
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:36,500
"just like us"

975
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:42,470
"A Star with no name"

976
01:26:04,870 --> 01:26:07,600
It's so high above?

977
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:09,930
Stars are so beautiful

978
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,010
It's the first time
I stop in such hotel

979
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:14,000
Really?

980
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:16,540
I used love hotels but

981
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:18,370
They are different

982
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:19,880
A love Hotel is
more cozy

983
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:22,040
Usually it's the contrary

984
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:24,350
Say

985
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:28,790
Has Kiwako Nonomiya
finished her jailtime yet?

986
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:30,020
Yeah

987
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:32,350
The lawyer received
a postcard from her

988
01:26:32,490 --> 01:26:33,960
Posted from Tokyo

989
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:36,050
But she's probably
not living there

990
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:37,760
She doesn't have much

991
01:26:37,870 --> 01:26:39,630
good memories in Tokyo

992
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:41,930
So where then?

993
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:45,830
You know where 
she lives?!

994
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:48,470
You want me to 
meet that woman

995
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:50,010
It's not my intention

996
01:26:50,110 --> 01:26:52,580
I don't know her
whereabouts or anything

997
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,040
Why?

998
01:26:58,350 --> 01:26:59,410
You're really
Going back?!

999
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,450
I really don't know

1000
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:04,020
Stop, there are 
no more trains

1001
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,850
You find all 
this entertaining

1002
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:07,690
You'll write it all

1003
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,090
An abducted child, commits 
adultery, makes a child

1004
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:11,860
She's doing the same
as the criminal

1005
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:13,330
I don't find it 
entertaining

1006
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:14,800
It's not because 
I am pregnant

1007
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:16,800
that I'm the 
same as her

1008
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:18,870
You just think 
I'm stubborn

1009
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:19,850
I don't think so

1010
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:22,930
I talked about
it with you

1011
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,880
I really needed to hear
someone's opinion

1012
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:26,840
about it all

1013
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:28,040
I told you everything

1014
01:27:28,150 --> 01:27:30,140
Why do you think
I want to become a mother?

1015
01:27:30,450 --> 01:27:31,710
I can't figure
myself as a mother

1016
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:33,790
I can't even 
raise a child

1017
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:34,650
I have no idea

1018
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:36,720
How to cherish 
her or scold her

1019
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:38,850
How to get close 
to her, to know her

1020
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,690
I won't become a mother

1021
01:27:40,830 --> 01:27:41,950
I won't write 
if you like

1022
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:43,650
I won't write 
anything

1023
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:47,890
If you're worried
let's raise her together

1024
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:50,770
As for me

1025
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,530
I'm afraid of men

1026
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:55,730
Their thick shoulders and arms
their Adam's apple

1027
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,540
even now they 
frighten me

1028
01:27:57,980 --> 01:27:59,840
I've never dated a man

1029
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:01,110
I have no experience
with a man

1030
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:03,680
I can't understand 
your feeling

1031
01:28:04,690 --> 01:28:07,590
I can't become 
someone's wife

1032
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:10,720
I think I'll 
always be alone

1033
01:28:11,130 --> 01:28:13,750
sometimes my mind
withdraws far away

1034
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,930
What I always wonder is

1035
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:21,430
Why wasn't I raised 
in a normal world?

1036
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:24,660
But you know

1037
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:28,130
Maybe I could be 
a good mother

1038
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:29,940
together with you

1039
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:33,880
You and me together
can make a good mother

1040
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,450
You think it 
wouldn't work

1041
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:45,720
May I touch 
your belly?

1042
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:10,650
I hear something

1043
01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:16,650
Its heart beating

1044
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:20,660
I can't say if it's 
Yours or the babies

1045
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,560
You girls came
from Tokyo?

1046
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:53,030
You mean Shodoshima 
in Okayama?

1047
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:54,960
Yeah, I went 
sightseeing

1048
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:57,150
Did you visit 
the Okayama area?

1049
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,260
You have to 
visit that park

1050
01:30:00,570 --> 01:30:03,540
Walk in Kurashiki
look at Korakuen
eat Rose sushi

1051
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:07,300
Tokyo people should know
what rose sushi is

1052
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:09,700
I don't know what
rose sushi is

1053
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:11,140
What? You don't?

1054
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:14,810
Well rose sushi is 
... rose sushi

1055
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:44,880
Welcome

1056
01:30:45,010 --> 01:30:47,000
Please, thank you 
very much

1057
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:08,960
We take it?

1058
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:12,600
Wait for the next?

1059
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:18,800
We take it?

1060
01:31:47,410 --> 01:31:55,610
Kagawa Prefecture
Shouzugun Fukuda 4028

If you visit there
tell them I'm fine

Kumi Sawada

1061
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:00,340
What's going on?

1062
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:03,680
So much water it's scary

1063
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:05,990
No need to fear

1064
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:17,230
Kaoru

1065
01:32:18,710 --> 01:32:19,970
Look

1066
01:32:20,110 --> 01:32:24,240
Look how beautiful
the sparkling

1067
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:48,060
Seto Sea is so calm

1068
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,700
Sparkling and beautiful

1069
01:34:05,950 --> 01:34:07,540
Excuse me

1070
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:12,210
Is this Kumi
Sawada's family?

1071
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:14,210
Who are you?

1072
01:34:14,350 --> 01:34:16,190
I'm sorry to come 
unexpectedly

1073
01:34:16,290 --> 01:34:18,520
It's Kumi she asked me...

1074
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:22,460
to tell you she's fine

1075
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,050
Kumi did?

1076
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,920
Where does she live?

1077
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:29,370
Her company has 
gone bankrupt...

1078
01:34:29,470 --> 01:34:31,840
We lived in the 
same dormitory

1079
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:34,200
Everyone is gone

1080
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:35,910
I see

1081
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:40,840
So you came here
to deliver the message?

1082
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:42,850
I wanted to come
and see once

1083
01:34:42,980 --> 01:34:46,380
Kumi was often talking
about the island

1084
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:51,180
She was talking
about our place?

1085
01:34:52,130 --> 01:34:54,820
If you don't mind

1086
01:34:54,930 --> 01:34:57,360
could I work here?

1087
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:58,430
What?

1088
01:34:58,530 --> 01:35:00,830
The company just 
went bankrupt

1089
01:35:00,930 --> 01:35:02,830
we don't know
what to do next

1090
01:35:02,940 --> 01:35:06,000
and I saw the poster
over there

1091
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:10,510
This has been
there for 2 years

1092
01:35:10,610 --> 01:35:13,270
Now I can't hire 
any staff

1093
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:14,950
Is that so?

1094
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:16,850
If I could help

1095
01:35:16,950 --> 01:35:17,940
it's OK

1096
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:19,550
I'm sorry

1097
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:21,110
Let's go

1098
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,090
Just a minute

1099
01:35:34,370 --> 01:35:35,930
You …

1100
01:35:38,910 --> 01:35:40,370
You have nowhere to go

1101
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:45,300
How long are you staying
on this island?

1102
01:35:45,450 --> 01:35:46,940
Two, three days ...

1103
01:35:47,050 --> 01:35:50,450
Alright, today
father's not here

1104
01:35:50,550 --> 01:35:52,140
Before you go back

1105
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:55,420
You can stay one
night at our place

1106
01:35:56,190 --> 01:35:57,180
Oh

1107
01:35:57,890 --> 01:36:00,190
Dad is worried 
about Kumi

1108
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:04,230
Because of her divorce
the quarrelling at her home

1109
01:36:04,330 --> 01:36:06,090
That's what we know

1110
01:36:06,270 --> 01:36:08,890
Would you tell us about it?

1111
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:15,200
You are so cute
what's your name?

1112
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:16,210
Kaoru

1113
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:18,610
And how old are you?

1114
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:19,930
Oh!

1115
01:36:20,350 --> 01:36:23,250
The same as 
Kumi's daughter

1116
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,500
We are there

1117
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:53,980
So beautiful

1118
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:57,510
Come Kaoru

1119
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:05,250
This is the Sea too?

1120
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:06,990
This is the Sea too?

1121
01:37:07,090 --> 01:37:09,030
There are many here

1122
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:10,260
This is a town

1123
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,330
All kinds of people 
live there

1124
01:37:12,570 --> 01:37:14,030
It's immense

1125
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:16,270
Yeah

1126
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:19,260
It's big

1127
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:22,570
Kaoru

1128
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:25,410
Let's go sightseeing

1129
01:37:25,710 --> 01:37:27,480
We haven't yet
discovered anything

1130
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:29,380
Let's go see places

1131
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:32,020
You're going to see
many things with Mom

1132
01:37:32,290 --> 01:37:34,010
All the beautiful things

1133
01:37:34,150 --> 01:37:35,250
The sea?

1134
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:40,120
Yeah, sea, sky, stars, flowers

1135
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:42,160
Let's see spring and 
autumn and winter

1136
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,360
Mom's gonna work

1137
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:46,360
to earn money 
and buy things

1138
01:37:46,570 --> 01:37:49,160
a beautiful book 
let's buy chocolate

1139
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:51,030
Chocolate!

1140
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:52,570
I'll buy you anything

1141
01:37:52,710 --> 01:37:55,000
I'll show you 
anything you want

1142
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,110
I introduce to you
our new worker

1143
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:08,150
Kyoko Miyata

1144
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:11,150
She's far away 
from home

1145
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:13,320
She's a distant 
relative

1146
01:38:14,190 --> 01:38:15,590
I'm Kyoko Miyata

1147
01:38:16,330 --> 01:38:17,590
Pleased to meet you

1148
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:19,290
Pleased to meet you

1149
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:21,390
OK, let's start

1150
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:22,730
Have a nice work

1151
01:38:23,770 --> 01:38:25,670
Aaaaah!

1152
01:38:34,510 --> 01:38:36,310
Let's play

1153
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:37,610
Come here

1154
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:39,050
Where are you from?

1155
01:38:39,150 --> 01:38:40,380
"Where are you from?"
She said 

1156
01:38:40,490 --> 01:38:41,750
Come over here

1157
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:43,190
Let's play together

1158
01:38:43,290 --> 01:38:45,350
Come on
Let's play

1159
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:46,480
Let's swing 
together

1160
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:47,720
Little Kyoko

1161
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:49,620
Come here

1162
01:38:53,370 --> 01:38:54,490
How was work?

1163
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,500
I'm doing my best

1164
01:38:56,740 --> 01:38:59,100
Quick to the park
let's play

1165
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:00,230
What is your name?

1166
01:39:00,370 --> 01:39:01,240
Shin Noriyuki

1167
01:39:01,340 --> 01:39:02,370
Yuri

1168
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,130
Sakura

1169
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:06,740
Let's swing
together

1170
01:39:06,850 --> 01:39:09,370
Kyoko look

1171
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:12,510
It's men's things but
you can wear them

1172
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:14,690
In fact it was for Kumi

1173
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:17,120
I wanted you 
to wear it

1174
01:39:17,290 --> 01:39:19,260
I'll give it 
to Kaoru

1175
01:39:19,390 --> 01:39:21,120
It's too much

1176
01:39:21,230 --> 01:39:22,160
It's alright

1177
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:24,250
I'm happy to 
offer it to her

1178
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,830
Grandpa bought
it for her

1179
01:39:27,130 --> 01:39:29,230
Kaoru you can 
wear it

1180
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:32,300
It's as if my granddaughter
was back, I'm so happy

1181
01:39:32,410 --> 01:39:33,530
Look

1182
01:39:33,740 --> 01:39:35,540
Thank you

1183
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,580
OK, let's get on

1184
01:39:49,390 --> 01:39:50,410
There you are

1185
01:39:55,430 --> 01:39:56,420
There

1186
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:58,490
Here we go

1187
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:02,470
All aboard!

1188
01:40:06,670 --> 01:40:09,300
Hi there

1189
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:11,700
Hello

1190
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:22,280
Kaoru, I feel good

1191
01:40:22,390 --> 01:40:24,450
It feels good, Mom

1192
01:41:30,660 --> 01:41:33,520
What did you 
pray for, Mom?

1193
01:41:34,890 --> 01:41:37,520
To stay together
with you

1194
01:41:37,660 --> 01:41:40,330
Tomorrow and the day
after and the day after

1195
01:41:40,430 --> 01:41:42,800
Let us be always together

1196
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:45,670
To be with you always

1197
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:52,410
On this island, there
are so many gods

1198
01:41:52,550 --> 01:41:55,540
Let's visit them all
and pray to each one

1199
01:41:55,650 --> 01:41:56,380
Yeah

1200
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:09,690
One, two

1201
01:42:10,430 --> 01:42:16,960
Three, four, five

1202
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:23,970
Everyone makes 
mistakes at first

1203
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:25,740
I'm sorry!

1204
01:42:25,850 --> 01:42:28,840
It takes time 
to learn

1205
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:32,710
Let's do this 
without rush

1206
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:34,510
Yes

1207
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:46,330
Thanks for the 
good meal

1208
01:42:46,470 --> 01:42:47,760
Thanks for the 
good meal

1209
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,730
Mommy?

1210
01:42:51,470 --> 01:42:55,600
Mr. Sawada 
is a girl?

1211
01:42:55,740 --> 01:42:58,400
A "Mr." is a 
man of course

1212
01:42:58,510 --> 01:43:00,480
but Kaoru is a boy?

1213
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:02,480
Kaoru is a girl

1214
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:04,880
She's a Cute girl

1215
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:07,890
But ...

1216
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:09,350
Really

1217
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:12,750
You saw men only 
in picture books

1218
01:43:12,890 --> 01:43:13,760
Yeah

1219
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:17,350
Where we lived 
there was only women

1220
01:43:17,830 --> 01:43:22,630
The fact is, man is one half
and woman the other half

1221
01:43:22,740 --> 01:43:23,860
Isn't it right?

1222
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:28,510
When you grow 
up a little

1223
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:31,840
You'll want to 
marry a person

1224
01:43:31,950 --> 01:43:34,380
He will be a man

1225
01:43:35,780 --> 01:43:37,110
Mom, you're a man?

1226
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:38,820
I'm a woman

1227
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:42,480
But I want 
to marry you

1228
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:46,790
so you won't have to
work so hard anymore

1229
01:43:46,890 --> 01:43:48,920
Is that what 
Mr. Sawada said?

1230
01:43:51,460 --> 01:43:52,800
You hurt me

1231
01:43:53,530 --> 01:43:54,800
Kaoru

1232
01:43:56,140 --> 01:44:01,070
One day you'll fall in
love with a gentle boy

1233
01:44:01,370 --> 01:44:04,070
You'll follow him
to his home

1234
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:07,540
I'm not going 
anywhere

1235
01:44:13,050 --> 01:44:16,080
I'll stay with 
you always

1236
01:44:40,950 --> 01:44:42,440
In fact

1237
01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:45,980
I thought of getting 
an abortion

1238
01:44:47,950 --> 01:44:51,980
I went to the clinic
to get an appointment

1239
01:44:53,990 --> 01:44:57,990
Then I saw her figure 
on the scan 

1240
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:02,130
I was suddenly 
hit by the light

1241
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:04,860
I saw the whole 
landscape

1242
01:45:06,610 --> 01:45:07,870
The landscape?

1243
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:13,030
Flowers, trees, 
sky, sea and light

1244
01:45:13,150 --> 01:45:18,480
I saw all these 
beautiful things

1245
01:45:19,890 --> 01:45:22,010
So I thought

1246
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:27,490
I had a duty to show them
to that baby in me

1247
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:31,150
all these beautiful things

1248
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:33,900
things I saw and 
others I will see

1249
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,630
All the beautiful things

1250
01:45:45,610 --> 01:45:46,940
You know

1251
01:45:47,050 --> 01:45:48,040
Yeah?

1252
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:51,050
We spoke about 
the cicadas

1253
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:53,880
They die after 7 days

1254
01:45:53,990 --> 01:45:56,650
That cicada surviving
the 8th day is sad

1255
01:45:58,930 --> 01:45:59,910
hmm

1256
01:46:00,030 --> 01:46:03,050
I thought so too but
maybe it's not so

1257
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:06,930
the 8th day cicada 
saw something

1258
01:46:07,830 --> 01:46:11,530
that no other 
cicada saw

1259
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:14,500
It could be 
something

1260
01:46:14,610 --> 01:46:17,540
very beautiful

1261
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:20,600
Yeah

1262
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:22,670
Maybe so

1263
01:46:44,970 --> 01:46:49,740
Mama, on top 
of that shrine

1264
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:51,570
There is a ghost

1265
01:46:51,710 --> 01:46:54,010
Uh, what ghost?

1266
01:46:54,110 --> 01:46:57,840
A princess wearing 
a beautiful kimono

1267
01:46:57,950 --> 01:47:02,750
But she's smaller 
than me

1268
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:05,550
She hasn't seen 
anyone for years

1269
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:07,130
she finally 
disappeared

1270
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:08,120
Why?

1271
01:47:08,230 --> 01:47:12,220
Last year she fell in love

1272
01:47:12,330 --> 01:47:15,990
with a handsome student
visiting the shrine

1273
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:18,730
she didn't go 
with him?

1274
01:47:18,870 --> 01:47:20,860
Oh, it started

1275
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:49,160
Yes, cheese

1276
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:50,420
Alright

1277
01:48:50,730 --> 01:48:53,700
Hold your bag's straps

1278
01:48:55,940 --> 01:48:58,340
Alright

1279
01:49:00,110 --> 01:49:03,130
Turn your back

1280
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:05,010
Yes, look this way

1281
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:08,180
Give me a smile
cheeeese

1282
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:09,850
Alright

1283
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:12,840
This time, everyone
side by side

1284
01:49:12,990 --> 01:49:14,110
Leave it here

1285
01:49:14,350 --> 01:49:15,980
Kyoko too, come 
into the photo

1286
01:49:16,120 --> 01:49:16,990
Me? It's OK?

1287
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:18,720
Of course, no 
need to be shy

1288
01:49:18,820 --> 01:49:19,760
No, no, Really

1289
01:49:19,860 --> 01:49:20,720
If you're sure

1290
01:49:20,860 --> 01:49:22,990
This is for memories

1291
01:49:23,130 --> 01:49:24,960
We'll have one 
in a photo studio

1292
01:49:25,060 --> 01:49:27,400
We'll take one 
in studio too?

1293
01:49:27,700 --> 01:49:28,860
Kaoru not yet

1294
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,230
Go to school, you'll 
get a school bag

1295
01:49:32,370 --> 01:49:33,430
Let's go to 
the photo studio

1296
01:49:34,870 --> 01:49:37,100
Hey, gimme a 
smile everyone

1297
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:40,210
Kaoru what's going on?
Smile, smile

1298
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:45,750
Yes cheese

1299
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:49,150
Mr. can we 
play now?

1300
01:49:49,290 --> 01:49:50,190
Alright

1301
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:52,790
Let's go 
play soccer

1302
01:49:53,290 --> 01:49:54,420
You want to 
come along?

1303
01:49:54,830 --> 01:49:56,420
Al-right

1304
01:49:57,730 --> 01:50:01,030
Kaoru come 
play soccer

1305
01:50:04,870 --> 01:50:06,170
Oh?

1306
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:09,440
She's a typical child
of the Island

1307
01:50:09,780 --> 01:50:10,760
Yes

1308
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:16,440
Kumi just called

1309
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:23,190
I told her about you
and Kaoru she was happy

1310
01:50:23,860 --> 01:50:26,050
She said she comes
back to the island

1311
01:50:26,190 --> 01:50:27,060
Kumi said that?

1312
01:50:27,190 --> 01:50:28,220
Yeah

1313
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:32,490
If Kumi is back
I owe it to you
	
1314
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:34,430
I didn't do anything

1315
01:50:34,530 --> 01:50:36,260
What do you say?

1316
01:50:36,370 --> 01:50:39,340
I didn't think
I'd meet her again

1317
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:43,930
Instead of my granddaughter
Kaoru visits me

1318
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:47,340
Thank you

1319
01:50:47,450 --> 01:50:48,470
It's nothing

1320
01:50:49,010 --> 01:50:52,070
I owe it to you
and Kaoru

1321
01:50:54,890 --> 01:50:59,490
A lot happened to you too
that you don't talk about

1322
01:51:01,290 --> 01:51:02,950
No I …

1323
01:51:05,030 --> 01:51:08,230
I just enjoy being 
with Kaoru

1324
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:15,100
You know Kyoko

1325
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:19,970
Let me buy Kaoru's 
school bag

1326
01:51:21,980 --> 01:51:23,380
Thank you

1327
01:51:23,850 --> 01:51:24,840
hmm

1328
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:21,160
Someone knows 
what this is?

1329
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:24,500
OK, What is it?

1330
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:26,910
Yes, teacher!

1331
01:52:27,010 --> 01:52:30,910
Yes, Kaoru Miyata
first year

1332
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:32,940
An elephant!

1333
01:52:33,090 --> 01:52:34,310
It's correct!

1334
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:15,360
Look, Mom

1335
01:53:39,390 --> 01:53:40,650
Little Shin

1336
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:43,650
Kaoru come

1337
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:48,650
Hello

1338
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:10,540
"Body is nothing 
more than emptiness"
[Heart Sutra]

1339
01:54:33,170 --> 01:54:34,660
OK, you lit it

1340
01:54:34,770 --> 01:54:36,140
I'm scared

1341
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:37,770
You're not scared

1342
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:40,310
To keep the bugs 
away from the rice

1343
01:54:40,450 --> 01:54:42,180
we pray

1344
01:54:42,310 --> 01:54:43,180
Let's do it

1345
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,680
You're with Mommy
nothing to fear

1346
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:47,440
Lit it

1347
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:54,060
Lit it on, lit it on!

1348
01:54:54,190 --> 01:54:58,060
Lit it on, lit it on!

1349
01:54:58,260 --> 01:55:02,260
Lit it on, lit it on!

1350
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:06,330
Lit it on, lit it on!

1351
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:09,630
Lit it on, lit it on!

1352
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:13,340
Hold it tight

1353
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:17,740
Lit it on, lit it on!

1354
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:22,050
Lit it on, lit it on!

1355
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:33,230
Look Mom

1356
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:35,620
It's so beautiful

1357
01:56:10,140 --> 01:56:11,800
So beautiful

1358
01:57:06,190 --> 01:57:07,720
What's going on?

1359
01:57:13,370 --> 01:57:16,460
I have been here ...

1360
01:57:34,820 --> 01:57:36,340
Excuse me

1361
01:59:04,910 --> 01:59:08,850
Kaoru, come eat

1362
01:59:14,490 --> 01:59:17,650
Kaoru let's swing!

1363
01:59:19,890 --> 01:59:22,990
Shin, the cicadas

1364
01:59:25,930 --> 01:59:29,590
Kaoru be careful
when you play

1365
01:59:32,540 --> 01:59:35,470
Kaoru come

1366
02:00:14,610 --> 02:00:15,910
Kaoru

1367
02:00:22,050 --> 02:00:23,650
Kaoru

1368
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:35,520
Kaoru

1369
02:00:40,940 --> 02:00:41,800
Mom

1370
02:00:41,940 --> 02:00:42,930
Uh?

1371
02:00:48,780 --> 02:00:49,940
You're tickling

1372
02:00:50,050 --> 02:00:51,680
You tickle me too

1373
02:00:57,390 --> 02:00:58,550
Kaoru!

1374
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:04,830
Look at the sky
Kaoru

1375
02:01:06,830 --> 02:01:08,820
It's so good

1376
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:31,720
Kaoru ...

1377
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:40,060
Ah Kyoko!

1378
02:01:40,170 --> 02:01:42,000
Come here 
a minute

1379
02:01:42,470 --> 02:01:44,130
Come here

1380
02:01:45,540 --> 02:01:48,130
Come here 
a while

1381
02:01:48,610 --> 02:01:52,010
Check this
it's incredible

1382
02:02:00,820 --> 02:02:03,050
Such a beautiful 
work

1383
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:06,060
It's really 
a prize

1384
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:09,490
It's the national 
contest

1385
02:02:09,590 --> 02:02:11,150
This is incredible

1386
02:02:14,170 --> 02:02:17,030
It's so beautiful

1387
02:02:18,470 --> 02:02:19,800
The faces are 
beautiful

1388
02:02:19,910 --> 02:02:21,100
Yeah

1389
02:02:21,210 --> 02:02:23,770
We should pin it
where everyone can see

1390
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:27,170
We need to show 
it to everyone

1391
02:02:27,610 --> 02:02:29,170
Please stop this

1392
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:50,670
Kaoru

1393
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:54,200
Let's move home?

1394
02:02:54,940 --> 02:02:58,930
Where to? Near 
Sakura's place?

1395
02:02:59,680 --> 02:03:00,940
Let's get out 
of the Island

1396
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:04,050
No way, I 
like it here

1397
02:03:04,150 --> 02:03:06,910
You'll be with me
you'll be fine

1398
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:09,820
No way, I am
not going anywhere

1399
02:03:16,030 --> 02:03:17,220
Kaoru ...

1400
02:03:17,530 --> 02:03:20,090
No way, I am
not going anywhere

1401
02:03:55,270 --> 02:03:56,700
Excuse me

1402
02:03:57,070 --> 02:03:59,590
I'd like to have
our picture taken

1403
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:06,610
A family photo

1404
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:18,610
Come inside

1405
02:04:28,030 --> 02:04:29,300
Now we're ready

1406
02:05:11,810 --> 02:05:13,210
Chin up

1407
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:30,090
Kaoru

1408
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:31,890
Come

1409
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,090
Where are 
you going?

1410
02:05:35,230 --> 02:05:37,360
You take a 
boat with Mommy

1411
02:05:37,670 --> 02:05:40,900
We take a boat and then
... we go to the zoo

1412
02:05:41,010 --> 02:05:42,700
Do they have 
giraffes?

1413
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:43,710
They do

1414
02:05:43,810 --> 02:05:45,400
And also hippopotamuses 
and elephants?

1415
02:05:45,710 --> 02:05:47,940
Hippopotamuses and 
elephants, all there

1416
02:05:48,050 --> 02:05:50,710
We are moving 
home now?

1417
02:05:51,820 --> 02:05:52,370
Yeah

1418
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:54,740
Once we're back 
from the zoo?

1419
02:05:54,850 --> 02:05:58,980
Can I play again 
with Shin and Sakura?

1420
02:06:00,130 --> 02:06:03,120
Let's play a lot

1421
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:12,870
Come

1422
02:06:25,250 --> 02:06:26,740
Kaoru ...

1423
02:06:28,820 --> 02:06:31,410
I can't keep 
up anymore

1424
02:06:44,770 --> 02:06:46,030
Are you Okay?

1425
02:07:01,490 --> 02:07:02,920
Alright

1426
02:07:19,940 --> 02:07:21,760
Let's buy something 
to drink

1427
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:24,540
I'm sorry ...

1428
02:07:24,740 --> 02:07:26,650
Why? It's OK

1429
02:08:42,860 --> 02:08:43,980
Please

1430
02:08:45,660 --> 02:08:46,460
Here too

1431
02:08:48,460 --> 02:08:49,890
Mom ...

1432
02:08:58,040 --> 02:08:59,440
It's 630 yen

1433
02:08:59,570 --> 02:09:00,560
Here

1434
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:03,170
perfect

1435
02:09:10,220 --> 02:09:11,180
Thank you 
for coming

1436
02:09:11,320 --> 02:09:13,310
Thank you

1437
02:09:13,590 --> 02:09:14,570
Let's go

1438
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:03,960
Kaoru

1439
02:10:04,270 --> 02:10:07,200
We must get on 
the boat in turn

1440
02:10:07,310 --> 02:10:09,100
Why?

1441
02:10:10,110 --> 02:10:12,100
Mom will follow 
you later

1442
02:10:20,220 --> 02:10:21,380
Please

1443
02:10:22,990 --> 02:10:25,110
Let's go 
together.

1444
02:10:29,460 --> 02:10:30,520
Yes

1445
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:43,410
Come

1446
02:10:50,180 --> 02:10:51,550
Go

1447
02:11:35,790 --> 02:11:37,560
You're Erina 
Akiyama

1448
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:40,660
I'll take you 
back home

1449
02:11:40,770 --> 02:11:43,030
Infant protection here
to protect little Erina

1450
02:11:43,130 --> 02:11:45,100
Mommy! Mom!

1451
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:46,730
You're Kiwako 
Nonomiya, right?

1452
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:50,110
Suspected for the abduction
of Erina Akiyama

1453
02:11:50,110 --> 02:11:51,440
arrested at 19:10

1454
02:11:51,540 --> 02:11:53,200
Let's go

1455
02:11:53,810 --> 02:11:55,310
Mommy!

1456
02:11:55,310 --> 02:11:57,610
I'm taking you back
to Mom's place

1457
02:12:00,080 --> 02:12:01,110
All right, all right

1458
02:12:02,820 --> 02:12:06,220
Please wait!

1459
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:07,990
This child!

1460
02:12:10,290 --> 02:12:12,760
Hasn't eaten yet

1461
02:12:16,100 --> 02:12:18,090
Thank you

1462
02:12:27,780 --> 02:12:29,250
Shall we go?

1463
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:35,250
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!
where are you going?

1464
02:12:35,390 --> 02:12:36,440
It's OK

1465
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:38,780
Mommy! Mommy!

1466
02:13:28,310 --> 02:13:29,830
Wait, what happened?

1467
02:13:30,340 --> 02:13:31,710
Wait

1468
02:14:20,420 --> 02:14:21,620
Excuse me

1469
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:29,890
Here, a long time ago

1470
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:33,870
You took a picture

1471
02:14:57,800 --> 02:14:59,520
Show me your face?

1472
02:16:27,110 --> 02:16:30,690
Kyoko Miyata & Kaoru

1473
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:32,790
As for the photo

1474
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:36,630
Kiwako Nonomiya 
took it

1475
02:16:38,460 --> 02:16:40,860
She came here?

1476
02:16:41,070 --> 02:16:42,860
About 5 years ago

1477
02:16:43,600 --> 02:16:46,630
SHe asked if I had
pictures of that time?

1478
02:16:49,110 --> 02:16:50,730
That person ...

1479
02:16:52,610 --> 02:16:55,910
Kiwako Nonomiya
told you something?

1480
02:16:56,650 --> 02:16:58,010
No, Nothing

1481
02:17:00,350 --> 02:17:02,440
She didn't say anything

1482
02:17:02,790 --> 02:17:04,850
She just took the photo

1483
02:17:18,070 --> 02:17:19,540
Come

1484
02:18:31,540 --> 02:18:32,800
Kaoru

1485
02:18:40,650 --> 02:18:42,210
Thank you

1486
02:18:44,960 --> 02:18:47,890
Mommy was happy with you

1487
02:19:02,210 --> 02:19:04,670
Yes, raise your hands

1488
02:19:17,520 --> 02:19:18,510
Yes

1489
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:22,050
What sweetie?

1490
02:19:24,060 --> 02:19:25,860
I don't need anything else

1491
02:19:25,960 --> 02:19:27,900
With you by my side

1492
02:19:29,270 --> 02:19:31,760
I have everything I need

1493
02:19:35,870 --> 02:19:37,240
I love you

1494
02:19:38,040 --> 02:19:39,170
Kaoru

1495
02:19:55,560 --> 02:19:57,030
Chin up!

1496
02:20:53,820 --> 02:20:55,280

02:20:58,620 --> 02:21:00,090
Erina!

1498
02:21:11,300 --> 02:21:12,790
You're ok?

1499
02:21:14,040 --> 02:21:17,700
I had no grudge

1500
02:21:19,640 --> 02:21:22,340
I didn't have any grudge

1501
02:21:23,210 --> 02:21:25,270
For mommy also

1502
02:21:26,280 --> 02:21:28,270
For daddy also

1503
02:21:31,220 --> 02:21:33,250
For you also

1504
02:21:37,800 --> 02:21:40,890
I wanted to return 
to this island

1505
02:21:42,930 --> 02:21:44,400
The truth is

1506
02:21:45,300 --> 02:21:47,400
I wanted to return

1507
02:21:49,770 --> 02:21:54,370
I though it 
was forbidden

1508
02:21:58,080 --> 02:21:59,880
It's fine

1509
02:22:00,680 --> 02:22:03,950
When this child is
born we'll come here

1510
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:08,830
I ...

1511
02:22:09,160 --> 02:22:10,750
I will work

1512
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:12,820
Yeah

1513
02:22:13,430 --> 02:22:15,130
If I work I can afford to

1514
02:22:15,300 --> 02:22:18,030
show her many things

1515
02:22:18,840 --> 02:22:19,960
Yeah

1516
02:22:20,100 --> 02:22:24,300
buy her beautiful clothes
and delicious foods

1517
02:22:24,410 --> 02:22:27,840
I'll take away 
all her worries

1518
02:22:27,980 --> 02:22:28,970
Yeah

1519
02:22:29,810 --> 02:22:31,870
I'll tell her 
it's all fine

1520
02:22:33,980 --> 02:22:36,920
That she's my
favorite in the world

1521
02:22:37,420 --> 02:22:39,690
I'll tell her often

1522
02:22:41,830 --> 02:22:43,690
Every problem 
can be solved

1523
02:22:44,030 --> 02:22:45,690
When she's born

1524
02:22:45,830 --> 02:22:48,320
We'll show her to 
your Mom and dad

1525
02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:50,770
We'll let 
them hug her

1526
02:22:54,170 --> 02:22:56,700
Will they love her?

1527
02:22:58,140 --> 02:23:00,980
She'll be so cute 
they'll love her

1528
02:23:03,750 --> 02:23:06,810
I don't know why...

1529
02:23:09,420 --> 02:23:11,910
I already love 
this child

1530
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:16,790
I haven't seen 
her face yet

1531
02:23:19,400 --> 02:23:21,160
Why is that?
