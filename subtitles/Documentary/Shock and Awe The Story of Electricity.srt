1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,100
When I assemble charges, I have to do work,
we discussed that earlier.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,840
And we call that
electrostatic potential energy.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,260
Today, I will look at this energy concept
in a different way,

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,580
and I will evaluate the energy
in terms of the electric field.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:29,479
Suppose I have two parallel plates
and I charge this one with positive charge,

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,280
which is the surface charge density
times the area of the plate,

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,120
and this one, negative charge,

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,680
which is the surface charge density negative
times the area of the plate.

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,800
And let's assume that the separation between
these two is h

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,660
and so we have an electric field,
which is approximately constant

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:56,179
and the electric field here
is sigma divided by epsilon zero.

12
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:01,360
And now, I'm going to take the upper plate,
and I'm going to move it up.

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:08,160
And so as I do that, I have to apply a force,
because these two plates attract each other,

14
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,399
so I have to do work.

15
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,060
And as I move this up, and I will move it
up over a distance x,

16
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,040
I am creating here, electric field
that wasn't there before.

17
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,020
And the electric field that I'm creating has
exactly the same strength as this,

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,679
because the charge on the plates
is not changing when I am moving,

19
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,960
the surface charge density is not changing,
all I do is, I increase the distance.

20
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:41,048
And so I am creating
electric field in here.

21
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:45,469
And for that, I have to do work,
that's another way of looking at it.

22
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:47,619
How much work do I have to do?

23
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:53,860
What is the work that Walter Lewin has to do
in moving this plate over the distance x?

24
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,760
Well, that is the force that I have to apply
over that distance x.

25
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,580
The force is constant and so I can simply
multiply the force times the distance,

26
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,800
that will give me work.

27
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:12,240
And so the question now is, what is the force
that I have to apply to move this plate up?

28
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,600
And your first guess would be that the force
would be the charge on the plate

29
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,700
times the electric field strength,
a complete reasonable guess,

30
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,000
because, you would argue,
"Well, if we have an electric field E

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,040
and we bring a charge Q in there,
then the electric force is Q times E,

32
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,940
I have to overcome that force,
so my force is Q times E."

33
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,020
Yes, that holds most of the time.

34
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,480
But not in this case.

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,359
It's a little bit more subtle.

36
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,920
Let me take this plate here
and enlarge that plate.

37
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,079
So here is the plate.

38
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,540
So you see the thickness of the plate, now,
this is one plate.

39
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,799
We all agree that the plus charge
is at the surface,

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,020
well, but, of course,
it has to be in the plate.

41
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,240
And so there is here
this layer of charge Q,

42
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,000
which is at the bottom of the plate.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,220
And the thickness of that layer may only be
one atomic thickness.

44
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,340
But it's not zero.

45
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,280
And on this side of the plate,
is there electric field,

46
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,040
which is sigma
divided by epsilon zero.

47
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,500
But inside the plate, which is a conductor,
the electric field is zero.

48
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:26,820
And therefore, the electric field is, in this
charge Q, is the average between the two.

49
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:35,140
And so the force on this charge, in this layer,
is not Q times E, but is one-half Q times E.

50
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,339
So I take the average between these E fields,
and this E field is then this value.

51
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,400
And so now I can calculate
the work that I have to do,

52
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:53,560
the work that I have to do is now my force,
which is one-half Q times E,

53
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,440
and I move that over a distance x.

54
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:04,680
And so what I can do now
is replace Q by sigma A,

55
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:12,440
so I get one-half sigma A
times E times x

56
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:19,320
and I multiply upstairs and downstairs
by epsilon zero, so that multiply by one.

57
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,120
And the reason
why I do that is,

58
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,120
because then I get another sigma
divided by epsilon zero here--

59
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,880
divided by epsilon zero, and that is E,
and therefore,

60
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,680
I now have that the total work that I,
Walter Lewin have to do--

61
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:40,680
has to do is one-half epsilon zero,
E-squared times A times x.

62
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,380
And look at this.

63
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,820
A x is the new volume
that I have created,

64
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,599
it is the new volume
in which I have created electric field.

65
00:04:50,600 --> 00:05:01,620
And this, now, calls for a work
done by Walter Lewin,

66
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:12,560
per unit volume and that, now, equals
one-half epsilon zero times E squared.

67
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,840
This is the work that I have done
per unit volume.

68
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:23,940
And since this work created electric field,
we called it "field energy density".

69
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,740
And it is in joules
per cubic meter.

70
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,180
And it can be shown that, in general,
the electric field energy density

71
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:40,240
is one-half epsilon zero E squared, not only for this
particular charge configuration,

72
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,180
but for any charge configuration.

73
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:49,320
And so, now, we have a new way of looking
at the energy that it takes to assemble charges.

74
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Earlier, we calculated the work that we have
to do to put the charges in place.

75
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:02,240
Now, if it is more convenient, we could calculate
that the energy, electrostatic potential energy,

76
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:09,740
is the integral of one-half epsilon zero E-squared,
over all space--

77
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,720
if necessary, you have to go all the way
down to infinity--

78
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,160
and here I have now dV,
this is volume.

79
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,420
This has nothing to do with potential,
this V, in physics, we often run out of symbols,

80
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,920
V is sometimes potential, in this case,
it is volume.

81
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,540
And the only reason why I chose h there
is I already have a d here,

82
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,660
so I didn't want two ds.

83
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,660
Normally, we take d
as the separation between plates.

84
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:41,760
And so this, now, is another way of looking
at electrostatic potential energy.

85
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,360
We look at it now only from the point of view
of all the energy being in the electric field,

86
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,760
and we no longer think of it, perhaps,
as the work that you have done

87
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,200
to assemble these charges.

88
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,460
I will demonstrate
later today

89
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:02,340
that as I separate the two plates
from these charged planes,

90
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,000
that indeed,
I have to do work.

91
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:07,380
I will convince you
that by creating electric fields

92
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,440
that indeed,
I will be doing work.

93
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,580
So from now on,
we have the choice.

94
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,479
If you want to calculate what the electrostatic
potential energy is,

95
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,320
you either calculate the work
that you have to do

96
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,580
to bring all these
charges in place,

97
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,659
or, if it is easier, you can take
the electric field everywhere in space,

98
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,080
if you know that and do
an integration over all space.

99
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,320
We could do that, for instance,
for these two parallel plates now

100
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,540
and we can ask what is now
the total energy in the field.

101
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:47,800
And at home, I would advise you, to do that
the way that it's done in your book,

102
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,840
whereby you actually assemble the charges minus Q
at the bottom and plus Q at the top,

103
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,140
and you  calculate how much work
you have to do.

104
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,300
That's one approach.

105
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,540
I will now choose the other approach,
and that is, by simply saying

106
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:07,380
that the total energy in the field
of these plane-parallel plates,

107
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,080
is the integral of one-half epsilon
zero E squared,

108
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,719
over the entire volume
of these two plates.

109
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,640
And since the electric field is outside
zero, everywhere,

110
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,060
it's a very easy integral,
because I know the volume.

111
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,400
The volume that I have, if the separation is h--
so we still have them h apart--

112
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,280
this volume that I have is simply A times h,
and the electric field is constant

113
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:39,419
and so I get here that this
is one-half epsilon zero.

114
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:46,260
For E, if I want to, I can write sigma divided
by epsilon zero, I can square that

115
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:52,480
and dV in doing the integral over all space,
means simply I get A times h,

116
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,380
it is the volume of that box.

117
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,080
So I get A times h.

118
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,700
And so this is now the total energy that I have,
I lose one epsilon here,

119
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,340
I have an epsilon zero squared
and I have an epsilon.

120
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:10,380
I also remember that the charge Q
on the plate is A times sigma,

121
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,000
and that the potential difference V,
this now is not volume,

122
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,840
it's the potential difference between the plates,
is the electric field times h.

123
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,060
The electric field is constant,
it can go from one plate to the other,

124
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,060
the integral E dot dl
in going from one plate to the other,

125
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,939
gives me the potential difference.

126
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:36,660
And so I can substitute that now in here,
I can take for A, sigma,

127
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,180
I can put in the Q and you can also
show that this is one-half Q V.

128
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,760
V being, now, the potential difference between
the plates.

129
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,319
And so this is a rather fast way
that you can calculate

130
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,560
what the total energy is in the field,
or, say, the same thing,

131
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,040
the total work you have to do
to assemble these charges.

132
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,620
Or, to say it differently, the total work
you have to do to create electric fields.

133
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:09,080
You have created electric fields
that were not there before.

134
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:20,500
I now will introduce something that we haven't
had before, that is the word "capacitance".

135
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:29,920
I will define the capacitance of an object
to be the charge of that object

136
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,439
divided by the potential
of that object.

137
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:41,460
And so the unit is coulombs per volt,
this V is volt, now, it's potential.

138
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:47,640
But we never say that it is coulombs per
volt in physics, we write for that a capital F,

139
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:53,360
which is Farad, we call that.
One farad is the unit of capacitance,

140
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,320
undoubtedly called
after the great maestro Faraday,

141
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,340
we will learn more about Faraday
later in this course.

142
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:06,340
So let us go to a sphere
which has a radius R

143
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:11,280
and let us calculate what the capacitance is
of this sphere.

144
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,240
Think of it as being a conductor, and we bring
a certain charge Q on this conductor,

145
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:23,960
it will then get a potential V, which we know
is Q divided by four pi epsilon zero R.

146
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:33,620
We've seen this many times and so, by definition,
the capacitance now is Q divided by the potential,

147
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:39,780
and therefore, this becomes
four pi epsilon zero R.

148
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,560
So that is the capacitance
of a single sphere.

149
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:50,680
And so we can now look at the values
as a function of R.

150
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,680
I have here some numbers,
I calculated it for the VandeGraaff

151
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,000
and I calculated it for the Earth.

152
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,280
If you want one Farad capacitance,
that's a real biggie,

153
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,520
you need a radius of 9 times ten
to the 9 meters,

154
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,400
that's the four pi epsilon zero
that comes in there.

155
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,939
That's huge, that's twenty-five times
the distance from the Earth to the moon,

156
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,780
that's a big sphere to have a capacitance
of one farad.

157
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,480
The Earth itself, with a radius
of sixty-four hundred kilometers,

158
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,580
would have seven hundred microfarad,

159
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,360
the VandeGraaff, thirty centimeters radius,
would be 30 picofarad,

160
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,640
the pico is ten to the minus twelve.

161
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,680
And if you take a sphere with a
radius of one centimeter,

162
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:38,300
then you have, roughly, one picofarad,
ten to the minus twelve farad.

163
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,439
So this gives you a rough idea
about the size of objects

164
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,660
and how they connect
to their capacitance.

165
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,540
So if I bring all these spheres,
at the same potential,

166
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,219
so I charge them all up
to the same potential,

167
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,900
then the one
with the largest capacitance,

168
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,980
will have the most charge.

169
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,640
And that, of course, is where
the word "capacitance" comes from,

170
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:07,720
it is the capability of holding charge
for a given electric potential.

171
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,680
Don't confuse that with electric fields
because if you bring all these spheres

172
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,520
at the same potential, then the one
with the strongest electric field,

173
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,079
that's the one which has the short--
smallest radius,

174
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,020
we discussed that last time.

175
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:28,140
Now, I will look at the situation
a little bit differently.

176
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:35,920
I have here a sphere, B,
positively charged

177
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,959
and I place it close to another sphere, A,
which is negatively charged.

178
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:47,780
And so, by my definition,
I can say that the capacitance of B

179
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:54,160
is the charge that I have on B
divided by the potential of B.

180
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,300
That will be my definition.

181
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:04,260
But, there is here, this object
which charged negative.

182
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:09,580
And how did we define potential?
Potential was work per unit charge.

183
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:15,200
I go to infinity, I put plus q in my pocket,
I approach B

184
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,740
and the work I have to do
per unit charge

185
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,820
is the potential of B,
that's the definition of potential.

186
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,560
But B is repelling me.

187
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,219
So I have to do positive work.

188
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,500
But A is now attracting me.

189
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,200
And so the work I have to do is less,
the work per unit charge.

190
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,260
And so, because of the presence of A,
the potential of B goes down

191
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:41,220
and therefore,
the capacitance of B goes up.

192
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:47,180
And so now you see that the presence
of this charged sphere here

193
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:52,959
has an influence, an important impact,
on the capacitance of B and therefore,

194
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:58,780
it is really unfair to call this
the capacitance of B.

195
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,199
We think of it as the capacitance of B
in the presence of A.

196
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,180
So it's no longer just B alone.

197
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,280
And so I'm now going to change
the definition of capacitance.

198
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,079
And I'm going to change it
in the following way.

199
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,540
I have two conductors.

200
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,240
And these two conductors have the
same charge, but different polarities.

201
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,020
And now the capacitance
of this combination of two conductors

202
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:29,699
is the charge on one of them--
which is the same, of course,

203
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,700
on the charge of the other,
except different polarity--

204
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,860
divided by the potential difference.

205
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:44,300
So that now,
is my new definition of capacitance.

206
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,920
So we always deal with two objects,
not with one in isolation,

207
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,959
if you have the charge
on one of the two,

208
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,600
and you divide it by the potential
difference between the two.

209
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,660
You may say, "Well,
it's a little artificial

210
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,040
to have two conductors
and one is positively charged

211
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,319
and the other has exactly the same
amount of negatively charge."

212
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,180
Well, it is not so artificial
as you may think.

213
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,599
Remember, then, we have this Windhurst
machine, which I was cranking

214
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,220
and I was charging one plate positive
and the other one negative.

215
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,540
Without my doing anything,
if one becomes positive,

216
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,339
the other one becomes negative
by exactly the same amount,

217
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,840
because you cannot create
charge out of nothing.

218
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,380
So if you charge one thing positive,
chances are that something else

219
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,480
is charged negative by the same amount,
but with opposite polarity.

220
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,520
So it's not so artificial,
that you have two conductors

221
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:37,560
with the same charge
but opposite polarities.

222
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:44,180
So now, we have two conductors there,
so if we go to this-- these two parallel plates,

223
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,099
the question now is,
what is now the capacitance then,

224
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,340
according to our new definition
of these parallel plates?

225
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,960
Well, that capacitance C,
is the charge on one plate

226
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,060
divided by the potential difference
between the two plates.

227
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,240
And the charge on one plate is sigma A.

228
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,800
And the potential difference between the plates
is the integral of E dot dl,

229
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,619
they are separated there by a distance h.

230
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:16,159
I will change that now to a d,
because that's more commonly done,

231
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,660
that the separation
between plates is d.

232
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,240
There was a reason
why I didn't want to put a d there,

233
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,839
because I didn't want to get you confused,
but now there is no confusion.

234
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,159
And so the potential difference is
the electric field between the plates

235
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,480
times the distance d.

236
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,320
But E itself is sigma
divided by epsilon zero.

237
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,520
So we get here sigma
divided by epsilon zero, divided by d,

238
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:49,000
I lose my sigma, and so, two parallel
plates have this as the capacitance.

239
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,580
It's linearly proportional with the area of
the plates, that's intuitively pleasing.

240
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,960
The larger the plate, the more charge you
can put on there.

241
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,160
And it's inversely proportional with the distance
between the plates.

242
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,340
The smaller you make the distance,
the larger is the capacitance.

243
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,419
Well, that goes back to this idea,
that the closer A is to B,

244
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,460
the larger effect that will have
on the capacitance.

245
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:15,100
And if you bring them very close together,
this potential will go down

246
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,800
and so the capacitance will go up.

247
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:20,360
So it's not too surprising
that you see d here downstairs.

248
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:28,080
The closer you bring the plates together,
the higher the capacitance will be.

249
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,139
Let us look at a-- uh--
at some numbers.

250
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:38,200
Suppose I have a a plate,
very large,

251
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,420
twenty five meters long
and five centimeters wide--

252
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,820
twenty five meters long
and five centimeters wide.

253
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,020
I have two of them.

254
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,480
Called a plate capacitor.

255
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,780
And let the distance between them, d,
let d be-- ooh, let's make it very small,

256
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:04,460
because we want a real big capacitor,
point oh one millimeters.

257
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,560
Very small gap between them.

258
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:13,679
So, now I substitute the numbers in there,
I can calculate the area,

259
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,600
Calculate the area here for the plates
in square meters of course,

260
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,240
multiply by epsilon zero
and divide it by d in meters

261
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,620
and when you do that, you find that
the capacitance of this big monster

262
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,060
is only one microfarad.

263
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,280
It's not very much.

264
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,180
And when you go to Radio Shack and you buy
yourself a one microfarad capacitor,

265
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,780
you don't buy something that is
twenty five meters long and yea big.

266
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:46,600
Well, you may actually have-- you may
actually buy that without you realizing that.

267
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:53,860
Because these large plates, these very long
ribbons of conductors,

268
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,479
two very close together, separated by
some insulating material,

269
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,920
very thin,
they're rolled up often.

270
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,580
And you don't notice that, but they are rolled up
and they are put in a little canister,

271
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,840
and that then gives you
a parallel plate capacitor.

272
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:13,220
I brought one with me, that is one
that I have used for several years,

273
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,840
but today I decided to cut it open for you
so that you can look inside

274
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,679
and then you actually will see the eh--
you're going to see there,

275
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:28,060
this is the canister in which it was--
and so I cut the canister open

276
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,600
and when you look here, you see,
there is this conductor--

277
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,480
looks like aluminum foil--
and then there is insulating material

278
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,920
and then you find more conductor,
on the other side.

279
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,860
And so you--
and it's rolled up.

280
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:45,050
Here, if I unroll it here--
I'm breaking it, but that's OK--

281
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:49,470
so you see the idea
of a parallel plate capacitor,

282
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,720
how it can be rolled up nicely
and you not realizing that

283
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,400
you're really talking often about meters,
many meters of material.

284
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,980
Now, through chemical techniques,
the distance d

285
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,900
can easily be made
a thousand times smaller than this.

286
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,060
And if the distance is
thousand times smaller,

287
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,399
then you would get a capacitance
of one thousand microfarads.

288
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,580
Compare that with the Earth, which is only
seven hundred microfarads.

289
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:25,300
So a capacitor like this
is one thousand microfarads.

290
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,180
If we bring the potential difference
over here,

291
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,980
then we get a tremendous amount
of charge on here.

292
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:37,140
In fact, if I hold this in my hands
and if I assume that the potential difference

293
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,400
between my left hand and my right hand
is ten millivolts,

294
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,340
then I would bring on this capacitor,
ten microcoulombs.

295
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,000
That is a tremendous amount of charge.

296
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,480
In fact, ten microcoulombs
is the maximum charge

297
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,200
we can ever put
on the big VandeGraaff,

298
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,840
we calculated it last time.

299
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:59,129
If we put more on the VandeGraaff,
it goes into discharge.

300
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,490
And by simply holding this
in my hands,

301
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:05,640
I can put ten microcoulombs here
on this capacitor.

302
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,920
Now, you may say, "Well, yes, but, uh,
potential difference

303
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,660
between your right hand and your left hand,
ten millivolts, isn't that funny?"

304
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,340
No, not really.

305
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:19,120
Uh, in the future, I will give a lecture and
then discuss electrocardiograms.

306
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,100
And you will see then,
that there is a potential difference

307
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,899
between the left side of your body
and the right side

308
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,080
which is several millivolts.

309
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,260
So it is not as artificial
as you may think.

310
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:37,100
Actually, we'll take a cardiogram in--
in class, so you can see it really working.

311
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:44,159
How much energy can I store in a capacitor?
Well, we already calculated that.

312
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:50,020
We had the energy, is it uh--
this was the plate capacitor,

313
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:57,320
one-half Q V
and we can now substitute for, uh--

314
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,020
we can substitute in there
the capacitance C

315
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:10,580
and the C is Q divided by V
and so this is also one-half C V-squared

316
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,580
that's one and the same thing.

317
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,020
So either you take the charge on the capacitor,
multiply it by V,

318
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:22,000
or you take the capacitance
and multiply it by V-squared.

319
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,740
The capacitance is never a function of the
charge that is on the object.

320
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,780
Here, if you look here, the capacitance is only
a matter of geometry.

321
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,980
And when you look there, the plate capacitor,
it's only a matter of geometry,

322
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:40,080
never does the charge
show up in there.

323
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:46,520
So I mentioned that I can bring
ten microcoulombs on this capacitor,

324
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,840
and yet, on the VandeGraaff,
I can also only bring ten microcoulombs,

325
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,159
that's the maximum I can do
before it goes into breakdown.

326
00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:01,640
We can think of a capacitor as a device
that can store electric energy.

327
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:08,500
I will now return to my promise that I was
going to demonstrate to you

328
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,480
that I have to do positive work
when I create electric fields.

329
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,200
In other words, when I take
these two charged plates,

330
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,660
and I bring them further away from each other,
that I do positive work.

331
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:25,400
And how am I going to show that to you?
I have two parallel plates.

332
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,020
They're on the table there, you're going to
see them shortly, projected there.

333
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:35,580
And we have, here, a current meter--
I put an A in there for amperes,

334
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:42,100
symbolic for current meter--
and I'm going to have a power supply

335
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,000
and put a potential difference over here,
this is the capacitance C--

336
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,840
we normally use for capacitor
the symbol of two parallel lines

337
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,300
I'm going to put a potential difference
V over the capacitor of thousand volts.

338
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:02,600
So let me put a delta here to remind you that
it's the difference between the two plates.

339
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:09,480
As I do that, as I connect the power supply
to these two ends, charge will flow on here,

340
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,040
and so you will see
a very short surge of current.

341
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,520
So the amp meter will give you, only for
the short amount of time that I am charging,

342
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,400
[wssshhht]

343
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,340
will see you -- will show you that there is
charge flowing.

344
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,179
And you will see that.

345
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:26,120
But that's not really the goal of my demonstration.

346
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:31,719
What I'm now going to do, is,
I'm now going to increase the separation,

347
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,960
the instance d of these two plates.

348
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,900
And remember that the potential difference
over the capac-- over the plates,

349
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,920
which I call now a capacitor,
is the electric field times the distance

350
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,740
and the electric field is constant.

351
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,920
If I charge the capacitor up with a certain
charge, there is plus Q here,

352
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,580
there's minus Q there
and then I remove the power supply,

353
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,159
it's no longer there,
that charge is trapped,

354
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,820
that charge can never change.

355
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:03,399
And so if the charge doesn't change,
the charge surface density doesn't change,

356
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,360
and so the electric field inside
remains constant.

357
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,040
So exactly what we did there.

358
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:15,120
And now I'm going to move them further apart,
therefore I'm going to make d larger

359
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,780
and that can only happen if the potential difference
between the plates increases.

360
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:24,360
And I will start off with thousand volts,
whereby d is one millimeter

361
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,260
and then I will open up this gap
up to ten millimeters.

362
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:32,720
And then I have a potential difference of
ten thousand volts.

363
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:40,780
But since the energy in the capacitor is one-half
Q times the potential difference V--

364
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:44,860
this V is the same as this delta V--
and if Q is not changing,

365
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:49,600
but if I go from V from one thousand volts,
to ten thousand volts,

366
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,540
it's very clear
that I have done work,

367
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,340
I have increased
the electrostatic potential energy.

368
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,959
And this is what I want to show you,
we're going to have that there--

369
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:05,380
so I've changed my television and
I will have to change the lights a little bit

370
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,580
so that you can see that.

371
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:14,919
Well, turn this one off, this one off,
and all dim [?]--

372
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:21,760
let's wait for the light to settle
and we want also the-- the current meter.

373
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:26,910
So the one on the right there is the, uh--
the amp meter, the current meter,

374
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:33,230
and you see here these two plates,
they are separated now by about one millimeter.

375
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:39,330
I have here a very thin sheet, transparency
which I can move in between

376
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:44,010
to make sure that they don't make contact--
and here is my power supply

377
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:49,930
and I have there, this, uh, propeller-type thing
which is some kind of a volt meter.

378
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,770
And if it's going to move
in this direction,

379
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,750
that means that the voltage
between the plates increases.

380
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:02,810
And so I'm going to charge it now, with a
potential difference of, uh, thousand volts,

381
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:09,050
and as I do that, you will see a very short
surge here on this amp meter.

382
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:13,330
That's not very spectacular, but at least
you can see, for the first time in your life,

383
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:18,330
that charge is actually flowing from my power
supply onto the plates.

384
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,620
Then you will see [pssshhht],
and that's it.

385
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,959
There will only be a current as long as the
charge is flowing.

386
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:30,820
So let my first do that, look at the amp meter
there, three, two, one, zero.

387
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:34,419
That's all it took
to charge these plates.

388
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,060
It's now fully charged,
thousand-volt difference

389
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,860
and now, as I'm going
to increase the gap,

390
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,139
there's no reason for any charge
to go away from the plates,

391
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,360
so the amp meter will do nothing,

392
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,840
but you're going to see this propeller
which indicates the potential difference

393
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,480
between the plates,
you're going to see it move,

394
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,560
because I'm doing all this work,

395
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,980
I'm going from one millimeter
to ten millimeters,

396
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,980
I'm creating all this electric field
and this hard work pays off

397
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:07,340
in terms of increasing the potential
from thousand volts to ten thousand volts.

398
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:13,399
So there I go, I'm two millimeters now,
look at the volt meter, there it's going...

399
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,300
Aargh, three millimeters,
I'm doing all this hard work

400
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,139
while you're doing nothing--
four millimeters...

401
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm creating electric field--
you should be proud of me,

402
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,580
I'm creating electric field,
look at that.

403
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,220
The electric field remains constant
between the plates,

404
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,600
because the charge is trapped,
the charge can't go anywhere.

405
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,939
I'm now at seven millimeters,
seven thousand volts, eight thousand volts,

406
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,760
I'm at nine millimeters, nine thousand volts--
notice that the amp meter does nothing,

407
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,460
no charge is flowing to the plates,
no charge is flowing from the plates,

408
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:50,720
I'm not at ten millimeters and now
I have created a huge volume,

409
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,600
electric field, and the potential difference
is ten times larger

410
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,580
than it was before, and so you see,
that I indeed, have done work.

411
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:05,740
You see it here
in front of your own eyes.

412
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,940
All right, let's get this down,
and I'll take the--

413
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:18,000
bring the lights back up
and we go back to normal.

414
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:29,500
I have here a hundred microfarad capacitor--
it's a dangerous baby--

415
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,380
and we can charge that up
to three thousand volts,

416
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,720
and when we do that,

417
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:41,080
we get three-tenths of a coulomb of charge
on that capacitor.

418
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:47,780
So the, um, I'll give you some numbers--

419
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:52,240
so it is one hundred microfarads,

420
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,060
I'm going to put a potential difference over it
of three thousand volts,

421
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:01,060
that gives it a charge Q of
oh point three coulombs

422
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,540
and that means that
one-half C V squared,

423
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:07,700
which is the energy that is stored, then,
in the capacitor,

424
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:12,100
is four hundred and fifty joules.

425
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,100
And this will take fifteen minutes.

426
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,179
And so I'm going to charge it now,
because at the end of the lecture,

427
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,680
I need a charge capacitor
for a demonstration.

428
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:29,220
And so I can show you there
the potential difference over the capacitor,

429
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,280
which will slowly change--

430
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,000
and we'll keep an eye on it
during the lecture

431
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,080
and then, by the time it's fully charged,
we will have reached the end of the lecture

432
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,159
and then we can continue.

433
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,240
So here is, then, this monster,
the hundred microfarad--

434
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:54,280
I call it a monster because the amount of energy
that you can pump in there is frightening,

435
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,200
it's four hundred and fifty joules.

436
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:06,120
And my power supply is here, that will deliver,
comfortably, the three thousand volts.

437
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,939
In fact, this is the voltage
of the power supply,

438
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,260
this is about thirty eight
hundred volts.

439
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:17,300
And so, now, the idea is that I'm going to
charge this capacitor--

440
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:21,560
always have to be very slow and careful
that I don't make mistakes,

441
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,899
because this is really a device that could be
lethal if you are not careful.

442
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,940
So I think we're OK.

443
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,600
Uh, the moment that I'm going
to charge this capacitor,

444
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,780
the reading there will show you
the potential difference over these plates

445
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:41,820
and it will take a long time for that
to go up to three thousand volts.

446
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:48,379
And so I think I'm ready to go
and I'm going to charge it now.

447
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:54,400
So you see now that the potential difference
over the plates is very low, it's near zero,

448
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,100
but if you wait just a-- a few seconds,
you will see, very slowly,

449
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,879
that, um, it is charging up
and fifteen minutes from now,

450
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,800
we will be very close to the
three thousand volt mark

451
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,500
and then we will return to this.

452
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:14,780
So we'll leave it on just for now,
while it is charging.

453
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:21,080
The idea of a photo flash is
that you charge up a capacitor

454
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:26,300
and that you discharge it
over a light source.

455
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:34,220
So the idea being that you have a capacitor--
let me erase some of this--

456
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:39,420
and that we charge the capacitor up,
put a certain amount of energy in there

457
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:44,560
and then we dump
all that energy in a bulb.

458
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:49,080
So here is the capacitor,
we're going to charge it up,

459
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,460
we have a switch here
and here is a light bulb

460
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,640
and when we throw the switch,

461
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,060
then all the energy
will be going to the light bulb,

462
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,940
if this is positively charged
and this is negatively charged,

463
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:07,260
a current will start to flow
and you will see a flash of light.

464
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:12,420
I have, here, a capacitance
of thousand microfarad.

465
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:17,460
So C equals thousand microfarad.

466
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:21,040
I'm going to put a potential difference
over that capacitor

467
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:30,080
of one hundred volts, which then gives me
a energy of one-half C V squared,

468
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,560
which is five joules.

469
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:38,380
In fact, this is not just one capacitor,
but these are twelve capacitors

470
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,140
which I hooked up
in such a way

471
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:44,259
that the twelve capacitors
of eighty microfarad each

472
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:49,560
are a combined capacitor
of one thousand microfarads.

473
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:55,779
And so I'm going to charge it up, and then
I'm going to discharge the capacitor

474
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:00,660
through the light and then you will be able to see
some lights, perhaps,

475
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:05,180
depending upon how  much energy
we dump through there.

476
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:08,540
So concentrate now on this light bulb.

477
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:13,520
The hundred volts-- you should see here,
do you see it?

478
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,920
So it's set at hundred volts now

479
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,760
and I'm now going to charge it,
and the moment that I charge,

480
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,260
you will see the voltage
over the capacitor

481
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,680
and so it takes a while
for it to charge up,

482
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,560
so it goes very [unintelligible] down to zero
and then slowly comes back to a hundred,

483
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,200
it may take five or ten seconds.

484
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,700
So if you're ready, then there we go.

485
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,560
Took only five or six seconds.

486
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,259
And so now we have a hundred volts,
so we have five joules stored in there

487
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:43,540
and I'm going to discharge that now
over this light bulb,

488
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:47,180
if you're ready,
three, two, one, zero.

489
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,200
A little bit of light.

490
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,060
I can tell that you're disappointed.

491
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,880
[laughter]

492
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,720
It's not very exciting.

493
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,839
It's not really my style, is it?

494
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,940
[laughter]

495
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:02,120
Well, what we can do,
we can increase the voltage a little bit.

496
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,339
Uh, we could go to two hundred and fifty volts,
in which case,

497
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,820
since it goes with V-squared,
we would have six times more energy,

498
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,000
so then we have thirty joules,

499
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,060
so let's see whether that's
a little bit more exciting.

500
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:19,259
So now I have to jack up the voltage
to two hundred fifty volts--

501
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,360
now you see the power supply again--
two hundred fifty volts--

502
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,900
we're getting there, we don't have--
oh, boy, huh, am I lucky, on the button.

503
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,680
So two hundred fifty volts
and now I can charge up again

504
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,020
will take a little longer,

505
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,160
so you'll see the voltage
over the capacitor,

506
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,660
hundred forty, hundred seventy,
two hundred, two fifty, there we are.

507
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,839
And now we can see whether
we get a little bit more light.

508
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,960
So you go from five joules now,
to thirty joules.

509
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,290
Three, two, one, zero.

510
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,890
Waahaa, now we're getting somewhere.

511
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:57,980
Now you really see
how a photo flash works.

512
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:03,800
Now, we all, of course,
have destructi-- destructive instincts.

513
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,840
And so you wonder...

514
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,480
[laughter]

515
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,500
Right?

516
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,200
You- you're thinking
the same thing that I do.

517
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,620
Shall we try three hundred forty volts?

518
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:21,339
And see whether the bulb [ptchee]
maybe explodes?

519
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,840
[laughter]

520
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,500
I don't know how high this
voltage supply can go, let's see.

521
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,380
Let's - let's go all the way.

522
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,240
Three hundred thirty seven volts.

523
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,020
OK.

524
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,440
So that would mean that we have
fifty joules, roughly.

525
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,920
It goes as the voltage squared.

526
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:44,240
Well, let's charge again,
so we're charging now.

527
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,879
Two hundred, two eighty,
three hundred,

528
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,860
there we go,
three hundred and thirty seven volts.

529
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,240
Now let's see--

530
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,580
Aaah! We did it! It broke!

531
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,580
[laughter]

532
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:13,960
I have a photo flash
and I have the photo flash here

533
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:21,560
and this photo flash has a capacitor
of about five thousand microfarads,

534
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,460
A real biggie.

535
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,060
And we can charge that up to a potential
difference of one hundred volts,

536
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:32,420
even though the batteries in there
are only six volts, there is a circuit in there--

537
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:36,700
we'll learn about that later-- which converts the six
volts to a hundred volts,

538
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,540
and so we can charge up this capacitor
to a hundred volts.

539
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:45,340
And that means that the one-half C V squared,
the energy stored, then, in that capacitor,

540
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,280
will be twenty five joules.

541
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,960
And I can dump that energy
over the light bulb

542
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,360
and then we see a bright
flash of light,

543
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:59,240
because this discharge can occur
in something, like, only a millisecond.

544
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,819
So you get a tremendous amount of light,
only for that millisecond.

545
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,160
And I want to demonstrate that to you.

546
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:11,540
And the only way I can demonstrate that to
you is by aiming this flashlight you.

547
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:15,759
I don't want to damage your eyes,
so I warn you in advance.

548
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,520
So I am charging up, now, my capacitor,
it will take a while

549
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,180
and I'm going to take your picture.

550
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,000
I might as well.

551
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,180
But, um, it's going to be very dark
in the back, there

552
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:32,879
and so I've asked Marcos and Bill
to also have some flashlights,

553
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,580
which go off at the same time
that my flashlight goes off.

554
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:41,580
Now, you may say, "Well, how can you do that,
because if this flash only lasts a millisecond,

555
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,259
how can you synchronize that?"

556
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,280
Well, the way that's done
is that those flashlights

557
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,960
are waiting for my light signal
to reach them,

558
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,760
and that goes
with the speed of light.

559
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,280
Takes way less than a millisecond
to get there,

560
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,640
and they go at the same time
that they receive my light flash.

561
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,379
And so we call them flash-assists.

562
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,220
And so let's-- let's see
whether we can do this.

563
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:06,540
I-- I have a green light here,
that means I can take my picture,

564
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:12,180
and-- yeah, you can-- oh, you don't have
to comb your hair, but -- you're looking good.

565
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,859
OK, let me-- let me, let me focus,
because that's important--

566
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,880
so make sure you see the flash.

567
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,600
You ready for this?

568
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,160
[click]

569
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,359
Did you see the flash?
Did it flash? Oh, it did.

570
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,440
Oh, you can say yes.

571
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,220
So, um, did the--
did the light-assists also flash?

572
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,359
OK, but you haven't seen that, yet,
right?

573
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,040
Because you were looking at them.

574
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:36,010
You should have looked--
you really should have looked at me.

575
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:39,570
So why don't we take a picture,
Marcos, Bill,

576
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:44,390
aim the fli- li- the flash-assists
at the students here

577
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,799
and then we'll try it again.

578
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,720
You ready?

579
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,439
OK.

580
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,320
Oh, boy.

581
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,600
Why don't you say cheese for a change?
OK, look at me--

582
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:01,240
oh, boy, you're looking great,
you really -- oh, you're, you're out of focus.

583
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,799
[laughter]

584
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,880
Uh, one person's sleeping there,
oh, we'll let him sleep.

585
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,540
[click]

586
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,380
That's OK.

587
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:14,460
Did that work? Did you see the flash?
You did, eh? Twenty five-- twenty five joules.

588
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,340
But those haven't seen it yet.

589
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,080
So Marcos, Bill, make sure that we go
this way

590
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:25,020
and give them a chance
to see this light flash.

591
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:29,420
So we get a little bit of assistance there,
the lights--

592
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,300
and let's see how this works,

593
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,360
make sure that you see the flash,
very good, you can--

594
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:42,280
going to see another twenty five joules
going through this light bulb--

595
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:47,020
very good--
oh, oh, oh, yes, yes, uh, yes,

596
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:51,400
your hand is in front of your mouth, sir,
yes, that's OK, thank you.

597
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:51,900
[click]

598
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:56,760
Very good, did you see the flash?
Did the f- did the-- did the assist go?

599
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,340
So that's the idea of--
of photo flashes.

600
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:05,680
So you dump a lot of energy in a very short
amount of time

601
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,180
and you get a very bright flash.

602
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:17,399
Professor Edgerton at MIT became very famous
for his flashlights.

603
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:23,220
He invented flashes that can handle
way more energy than this flash

604
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:28,740
and they can dump that energy
in less that one microsecond.

605
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:32,299
And so this opened up the road
to high-speed photography

606
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,760
and that made it possible
to study the motion of objects

607
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,440
on time scales of microseconds
and even shorter than that.

608
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:49,180
And I'd like to show you some of the pictures
that were taken with Doc Edgerton's flashes.

609
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:57,480
The first slide -- you see a bullet coming
from the right going for a light bulb.

610
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,960
The exposure of this, uh, picture
is only one-third of a microsecond,

611
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,960
during which the bullet probably moved
only a third of a millimeter,

612
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,360
so it looks like
it's completely standing still.

613
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,540
And the bulb is heading for disaster,
but it doesn't know that yet.

614
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,480
[laughter]

615
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:21,900
Uh, the bullet, uh, moves, uh, in hundred
microseconds about eight centimeters,

616
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:26,460
and the next picture is taken
a hundred microseconds later,

617
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,640
again one-third
of a microseconds exposure.

618
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,759
So if we can look at that--
there, you see,

619
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,420
so the bullet now
just penetrates the light bulb

620
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,020
and then the next picture is another
hundred microseconds later,

621
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:42,580
and there you see the bullet
emerging from the light bulb.

622
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:48,299
And, uh, this, uh, light bulb
has hardly realized that it is broken.

623
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,040
But it's beginning to dawn on it, and--

624
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,440
[laughter]

625
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,100
and then the next slide--

626
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,960
is one wonderful picture of a boy
who is popping a balloon,

627
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,660
and you see half the balloon
doesn't even know yet--

628
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,779
[laughter]

629
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:08,100
that it is broken.

630
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:15,020
Doc Edgerton also developed
a lot of, um, strobes.

631
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:22,980
A strobe, I have one here, is an instrument
that repeatedly discharges,

632
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,900
um, energy over a--
over the light bulb--

633
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:36,840
and so you get repeated flashes
and that then, gives you an instrument like this.

634
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,760
[laughter]

635
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,440
Uh, you've seen them in use--
uh, they are being used at airplanes,

636
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,260
just for warning signals.

637
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:48,800
And you've also seen them on tall
towers near airports, also warning signals,

638
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,920
but there are lot of more things
you can do with strobes.

639
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,420
And later in 802, uh, I will show you,
for instance, that you can measure

640
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:59,700
the rotation rate of motors with flash lights,
with these, uh, stroboscopes,

641
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,839
and the motors are going to play
a more important role in 802 than, uh,

642
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,880
than you may have guessed
before you took this course.

643
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,600
You can also measure
with strobes the rotation,

644
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,140
the speed of your record player,
if you still have one

645
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:20,319
and then you can adjust it so that
it just has the right speed that is required.

646
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,640
So you have a lot of things
you can do with strobes

647
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:27,339
and some of which
we will see also in 802.

648
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:34,100
So, now,
I return to my capacitor there.

649
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,000
And let's see how it is doing.

650
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,280
Ah, boy, we are close to the three thousand,
which was my goal.

651
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,480
It takes a -- you see,
a good fifteen minutes,

652
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,000
to actually reach
the three thousand volts

653
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,940
on this huge capacitor
and to get in there, the energy,

654
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:55,840
the four hundred fifty joules
that I wanted.

655
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,360
And why is it
that I want to show you this?

656
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,680
Well, I want you to appreciate
the idea of a fuse.

657
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,740
You have lots of fuses at home.

658
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:07,319
A fuse is a safety device.

659
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:12,320
A fuse is something that melts,
something that breaks

660
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,540
if the current that you are using is too high.

661
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:23,580
Suppose you have a short, electric short
without realizing it, in your desk lamp,

662
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,779
and a very high current could start to flow,
then the fuse will say,

663
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:28,840
"Sorry, you can't do that"

664
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:34,960
the fuse will melt, and then that's--
prevents you from a disaster,

665
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,960
which, actually,
might give you a fire.

666
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,640
And we already showed, in a way,
the idea of a fuse,

667
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:46,319
because when we broke this light bulb,
that was, in a way, a fuse.

668
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:51,000
We dumped too much energy through that
light bulb, and so, the light bulb itself [crack]

669
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,100
was already like a fuse.

670
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:59,540
This is really more like a fuse that we are
used to, it is a-- we have a wire there,

671
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:04,160
which is an iron wire,
which is twelve inches long,

672
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,940
and it has a thickness of
thirtythousandths of an inch.

673
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:14,520
And we're going to dump the four hundred fifty
joules through that wire.

674
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:22,840
So the idea is very much like we had the--
the photo flash, we, um, have all this energy

675
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:27,220
in the capacitor, and instead of dumping it
through the light bulb,

676
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:31,220
which was this system,
we now have here, a wire,

677
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:35,500
and when I throw this switch,
the energy will go through the wire.

678
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:40,320
And chances are that you may see
the wire glowing a little bit

679
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,360
and then it would melt and that would then
give you the idea of a fuse.

680
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,440
And it's also possible that
after we have done that,

681
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,240
that there may still be energy left
on this capacitor

682
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,859
and I can show that to you too, then,
because I can short out

683
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:59,100
the two ends of the capacitor
and see whether we still see some--

684
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:03,540
some sparks, which would indicate
that there's still some energy left.

685
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:10,020
So if you are ready-- I'm always a little bit
scared with this demonstration--

686
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,000
not so much about what's going happen,
that thing will probably just melt

687
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,400
and maybe we'll see
a little bit of light,

688
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,260
that's not the issue--
but I'm afraid of this baby,

689
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:20,480
because that has, now,
a tremendous amount of energy.

690
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,640
So I stop the charging--
so let's do that--

691
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,879
and if you're ready,
then I will try to

692
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,520
dump all that energy
through this wire.

693
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,440
Three, two, one, zero.

694
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,960
[loud bang]

695
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,980
[low rumbling sound due to slowmotion]

696
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,960
This is the way a fuse works.

697
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,640
This is very effective, as you see.

698
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,960
And if you hear this happening
in your basement, then, well--

699
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,380
maybe that's a fuse.

700
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:01,200
We can now check whether there is
energy left on that capacitor.

701
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,379
Maybe not very much, but it's unlikely that
everything was dumped in the iron,

702
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:10,540
so let's see whether there is some left,
if I'm going to short it out with this--

703
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,320
conducting bar and see
whether we can get a spark.

704
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:13,820
[spark]

705
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,120
And we can, so there's still
some energy left.

706
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,920
OK, see you Friday.

707
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,920
[applause]
