00:01:40,992 --> 00:01:43,938
Any living system on our beloved planet,

5
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,352
is an eloquent expression of the Universe's astonishing ability

6
00:01:48,377 --> 00:01:50,515
to come to a perfect balance

7
00:01:50,713 --> 00:01:53,334
and then to do what life is ment to do:

8
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:55,115
to thrive.

9
00:01:55,576 --> 00:01:58,632
Thriving is the natural flow of life

10
00:02:29,553 --> 00:02:33,224
Consider what is surely on of the greatest wonders of all

11
00:02:33,343 --> 00:02:37,752
how a tiny egg and a single irrepressably plucky sperm

12
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:42,921
can unleash a process that brings forth in end another one of us

13
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:48,223
a being of vast ability and unlimited potential,

14
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:53,185
with a brain capable of complex and
soaring self reflection,

15
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:56,405
legs made to dance and run,

16
00:02:56,977 --> 00:03:00,183
fingers nimble enough to weave a basket

17
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:02,080
play a violin,

18
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:03,753
caress a face.

19
00:03:04,611 --> 00:03:06,800
If nature teaches us anything,

20
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:09,143
is that life is meant to work

21
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:13,198
and like every living thing, our purpose is to thrive.

22
00:03:21,321 --> 00:03:24,108
And yet, for the majority of people on the planet

23
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:26,429
life is not about thriving,

24
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:28,284
it's about surviving,

25
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:30,497
just trying to hang on.

26
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:35,178
Is this really the best that we can do?

27
00:03:35,543 --> 00:03:39,256
Did the Universe labor for nearly 14 billion years

28
00:03:39,391 --> 00:03:43,815
only to bring forth a species that will end up as an enemy to life itself

29
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:45,560
and to its own home?

30
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:47,638
I don't think so!

31
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:49,931
My name is Foster Gamble

32
00:03:49,956 --> 00:03:53,946
and I have spent nearly a lifetime trying to figure out, what happened

33
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:56,201
what is happening, that could account

34
00:03:56,226 --> 00:03:59,780
for this staggering agony and deprivation on this planet.

35
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,138
As a young man, driven by the misery I saw

36
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:06,470
and by my fear for our survival,

37
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:08,574
I set out on a journey,

38
00:04:08,678 --> 00:04:10,724
seeking to answer questions like:

39
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:13,874
Is it even possible for humans to thrive?

40
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,677
If so, why aren't we?

41
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:21,783
My research led me to places, I never expected to go

42
00:04:21,808 --> 00:04:25,919
revealing surprising discoveries, that seemed unrelated at first

43
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:29,555
but which turned out to be crucially connected, as you'll see.

44
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,492
I found a code

45
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:37,098
a pattern in nature that's been embedded in arts and icons, throughout the centuries.

46
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:43,008
I believe this code holds the key to a new source of clean, sustainable energy

47
00:04:43,302 --> 00:04:46,882
that could completely revolutionize the way all people live.

48
00:04:47,272 --> 00:04:50,751
I came to understand how our economic system is rigged

49
00:04:50,902 --> 00:04:53,715
and I found out, what we can do about it.

50
00:04:54,986 --> 00:04:57,747
My journey will reveal ways we can reclaim our power,

51
00:04:57,771 --> 00:05:01,747
to create liberating healthy systems, everywhere on Earth.

52
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,826
I realized that we are not a mistake, we are simply mistaken!

53
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:12,169
We've been blinded to our brilliance,

54
00:05:12,376 --> 00:05:13,975
insure of our strength,

55
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:15,968
ignorant of our genius,

56
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:20,460
unaware of our true power and magnificense.

57
00:05:21,302 --> 00:05:24,853
But all that is about to change!

58
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:29,459
I invite you to share with me the highlights of my unlikely journey!

59
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,688
I created this navigator,

60
00:05:32,347 --> 00:05:34,621
to take us through time and space.

61
00:05:35,137 --> 00:05:37,110
Let me show you around!

62
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:41,682
On this screen we can access what I call "our vitals":

63
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:45,259
it's the critical data, we don't get from the corporate media,

64
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:48,732
which in the U.S. has consolidated from 50 companies,

65
00:05:48,757 --> 00:05:51,564
down to 5 in just over 25 years.

66
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,350
We'll use this to check on, how we're really doing.

67
00:05:56,581 --> 00:06:00,959
The right screen tracks how to chart a healthy sustainable course

68
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:02,858
for living on planet Earth.

69
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:06,223
I call these the "navigating insights".

70
00:06:08,883 --> 00:06:11,046
And this will be our compass.

71
00:06:11,324 --> 00:06:14,876
Instead of a needle seeking north in our earth's magnetic field,

72
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:18,100
our compass is the shape of the field itself

73
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:21,141
and that shape, as you will soon see,

74
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,965
has amazing technological and social ramifications.

75
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,703
After a lifetime quest

76
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:33,588
I've come to believe that this pattern actually holds the key to a world that works for everyone.

77
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:36,118
So let's go!

78
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:11,650
<b>THRIVE</b>

79
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:17,377
<b>What on Earth will it take?</b>

80
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,327
I grew up in a world of privilege and power,

81
00:07:36,352 --> 00:07:40,180
attending elite private schools and then Princeton University.

82
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:44,465
As a direct descendant of one of the founders of Procter & Gamble,

83
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:47,588
I was growed to be a leader in the establishment,

84
00:07:48,013 --> 00:07:49,990
but I chose a different path.

85
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:59,789
<b>Uncovering The Code</b>

86
00:08:02,346 --> 00:08:05,285
I began to wake up when I was in elementary school.

87
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:10,361
Adults were teaching me that the way to protect myself from a nuclear explosion

88
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:13,464
was to dock under my desk and cover my head.

89
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:16,933
That's when my serious questioning began.

90
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:21,583
A couple of years later, I had a direct experience of universal energy.

91
00:08:21,608 --> 00:08:26,403
It happened one day when I was riding on a school bus, gazing out the window.

92
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,920
I had a vision of the world pool pattern

93
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:32,784
and I just knew that the flow of energy I was seeing

94
00:08:32,824 --> 00:08:36,750
was the same in atom, as in our entire solar system.

95
00:08:37,045 --> 00:08:41,704
I felt deeply, that I too was somehow made of that same pattern.

96
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:45,832
This vision was that originally got me into science,

97
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:48,798
into trying to figure out how the universe works

98
00:08:48,823 --> 00:08:52,979
and how we humans fit in the overall pattern of life-energy.

99
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,621
Years later I learned that the pattern I saw,

100
00:08:56,646 --> 00:08:59,186
is known by some in the scientific world.

101
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:04,434
It turn's out that in 1921 Albert Einstein got a Nobel prize for discovering,

102
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:07,832
that when energy is released in the Universe

103
00:09:07,898 --> 00:09:10,888
There are little packets of wholeness, that emerge

104
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,969
This pattern actually tells us a lot about how life evolves.

105
00:09:18,263 --> 00:09:22,417
Considering the enduring wonders of creation throughout the universe

106
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:26,609
and how unsustainable so many of our human systems are,

107
00:09:26,721 --> 00:09:30,645
I figured learning how the universe creates and sustains life,

108
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,608
would actually be quite useful.

109
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:37,989
Each of these little packets of wholeness, that Einstein discovered,

110
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:40,287
called a quantum,

111
00:09:40,557 --> 00:09:44,537
is made out of its surroundings, but is distinct within it,

112
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,109
like a whirlpool in water.

113
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:52,695
These packets are always the same pattern, nomather what size

114
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:57,175
and they are surprisingly relevant to issues as seemingly disconnected,

115
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,065
the wars in the Middle East, the global financial collapse

116
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,816
and how we achieve justice for everyone.

117
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:06,741
We are about to explore how.

118
00:10:07,988 --> 00:10:11,117
Mathematicians call this pattern the Torus.

119
00:10:12,022 --> 00:10:15,146
The energy in a torus flows into one end,

120
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,233
circulates around the center

121
00:10:19,012 --> 00:10:21,111
and exits out the other side.

122
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:26,543
It's balanced, self regulating and always whole.

123
00:10:27,997 --> 00:10:33,173
I was first officially introduced to the torus by scientist and inventor Arthur Young.

124
00:10:35,499 --> 00:10:37,547
Futurist Duane Elgin explains

125
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:41,153
how the torus is the primary pattern that nature uses for life

126
00:10:41,178 --> 00:10:42,862
at every scale.

127
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:46,838
The Evolution means to unfold, to roll out.

128
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:49,970
So the question is, what is the Universe rolling out?

129
00:10:50,018 --> 00:10:53,097
And what the Universe is rolling out is self organising systems

130
00:10:53,122 --> 00:10:56,106
and you can see this at every scale.

131
00:10:56,131 --> 00:10:58,742
Self organising system is a technical term

132
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:01,824
for a system taking a hold of itself,

133
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:04,613
knowing itself, essentially.

134
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:06,988
And if we go to nature,

135
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:12,845
we can look and see these self organising forms, throughout.

136
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:16,082
We can see it in the cross section of an orange

137
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:18,345
the cross section of an apple.

138
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,259
We can see it in the dynamic nature of a tornado.

139
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:27,580
We can see it in the magnetic field around the Earth,

140
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:31,374
a similar magnetic field, around an individual.

141
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:36,432
We can see it in the structure of an entire whirlpool galaxy.

142
00:11:36,726 --> 00:11:40,947
We can see it in the structure of a small atom.

143
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:44,570
And, every scale, throughout this entire history,

144
00:11:44,595 --> 00:11:47,938
the Universe has one single project

145
00:11:47,963 --> 00:11:49,613
it's growing toruses!

146
00:11:49,638 --> 00:11:52,590
the Universe is a torus growing factory

147
00:12:02,397 --> 00:12:06,678
These toroidal dynamics are visible at various scale.

148
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,527
One of them is at the galactic level,

149
00:12:09,552 --> 00:12:14,617
which are huge spinning structures, with billions of stars in them.

150
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:20,776
Looks like, typically, big arms of galaxies,

151
00:12:21,055 --> 00:12:22,884
spinning around

152
00:12:22,988 --> 00:12:29,691
and we have vortex, that goes to the center out

153
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:34,267
to the edge of the galactic halo,

154
00:12:34,562 --> 00:12:36,430
that surrounds them.

155
00:12:36,534 --> 00:12:42,895
Stars move from this galactic disk out to the halo,

156
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,589
down the vortex and back out again.

157
00:12:46,614 --> 00:12:51,973
Stars as Arcturus, for instance, we know, have done that path already.

158
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:58,450
That's the appropriate description even for the atmosphere of our planet.

159
00:12:58,585 --> 00:13:03,600
The weather goes from the north pole down to the equator and then back up

160
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:07,218
and the south pole, up to the equator and then back down.

161
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:11,772
Even the dynamics on the surface of the Sun are very similar.

162
00:13:12,185 --> 00:13:16,387
Of course here we are looking at it from an external perspective,

163
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:18,558
on a small scale model.

164
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:24,378
When we look at the solar system embedded in the galaxy

165
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:27,836
embedded in the cluster,

166
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:31,548
embedded in a super cluster,

167
00:13:32,676 --> 00:13:39,046
we're travelling in the sea of infinite torus flow.

168
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:52,084
The torus is like the breath of the universe,

169
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:56,728
it's the form that the flow of energy takes at every scale of existence.

170
00:13:57,252 --> 00:14:01,517
But there's also underlaying structure, in how the flow fits together,

171
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:03,402
sort of like a skeleton.

172
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,697
It is called the vector equilibrium

173
00:14:06,214 --> 00:14:09,546
a term coined by one of the XX century's greatest thinkers

174
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:11,294
Buckminster Fuller.

175
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,881
Inspired by Fuller's visionary work,

176
00:14:15,906 --> 00:14:21,925
I spent decades for searching the dynamics of the vector equilibrium and the torus.

177
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:26,726
I became so excited by the potential of the toroidal energy form,

178
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:31,001
that in 1997, I co-founded a multidisciplinary think tank,

179
00:14:31,026 --> 00:14:33,075
called The Sequoia Symposium,

180
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,690
to study the pattern and explore its applications.

181
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:40,033
Our collective research convinced me,

182
00:14:40,057 --> 00:14:44,030
that the torus and the vector equilibrium are primary patterns,

183
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:48,134
fundamental to the creation of the universe at all scales.

184
00:14:49,499 --> 00:14:51,974
The Sequoia Symposium gatherings,

185
00:14:52,054 --> 00:14:56,142
I learned of inventors, who claimed they were using the torus dynamic

186
00:14:56,167 --> 00:15:00,652
as the basis for devices that generated energy without combustion.

187
00:15:01,343 --> 00:15:03,561
This revolutionary development

188
00:15:03,824 --> 00:15:08,841
accessing what's sometimes called zero point or radiant or free energy,

189
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,897
is now being called most simply, new energy technology.

190
00:15:13,922 --> 00:15:16,644
Given that so much of the suffering in our world

191
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:19,585
is the result of lack of access to energy

192
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:23,348
I realized that free, unlimited, clean energy

193
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:26,183
would be one of the greatest breakthroughs in history.

194
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:28,443
It could not just improve,

195
00:15:28,468 --> 00:15:32,114
but actually transform the quality of life on this planet.

196
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:36,512
So I began to wonder, who else knew about this pattern

197
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:39,659
or about the powerful potential energy source?

198
00:15:40,827 --> 00:15:45,490
Some of the scientists of the symposium showed me how the torus has been encoded,

199
00:15:45,515 --> 00:15:47,971
by different cultures for millennia.

200
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:51,649
Apparently ancient cultures have embedded this code

201
00:15:51,674 --> 00:15:54,329
in the most enduring forms then possible,

202
00:15:54,417 --> 00:16:00,452
in stories, in icons, in alphabets, in buildings.

203
00:16:01,342 --> 00:16:04,583
Here we are at one of the world's oldest sacred sites:

204
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:07,710
the Osirian temple, at Abydos, Egypt.

205
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,748
Very few writing is found in the Osirian temple.

206
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:20,176
However, there is one very significant piece of information in that temple.

207
00:16:21,018 --> 00:16:27,224
It is a very faint, but clear and precise drawing.

208
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:32,347
It's not edged into the rock, it's not carved,

209
00:16:32,372 --> 00:16:37,833
it's burned in to the atomic structure of the rock,

210
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:40,788
in some extraordinary way.

211
00:16:41,662 --> 00:16:46,259
Nassim has decoded the Osirian symbol in three dimensions.

212
00:16:46,593 --> 00:16:48,913
Since our world is not two-dimensional,

213
00:16:48,938 --> 00:16:52,496
it makes sense, the code relaying information about our world,

214
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:55,818
also wouldn't be limited to flat designs.

215
00:16:56,914 --> 00:17:02,210
His three-dimensional version of the Osirian symbol starts with a vector equilibrium

216
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:04,746
a perfectly balanced force field

217
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:07,649
with 12 equal energy lines radiating out.

218
00:17:08,182 --> 00:17:12,507
They stabilize the center, like the 12 spokes of a wheel.

219
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:20,500
The primary pattern of balanced energy flow around this structure,

220
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:21,936
is the torus.

221
00:17:27,453 --> 00:17:30,360
Here we extend to the next larger scale

222
00:17:30,385 --> 00:17:34,138
with a total of 64 pyramids, called tetrahedra.

223
00:17:38,698 --> 00:17:40,896
If we then put spheres in

224
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:44,617
representing the toroidal energy fields surrounding each of the pyramid

225
00:17:45,952 --> 00:17:48,260
and then we drop away the pyramids,

226
00:17:49,998 --> 00:17:56,483
we end up with a matrix, that is amazingly an exact overlay for the Osirian icon,

227
00:17:57,094 --> 00:17:59,486
a three-dimensional model of the same pattern,

228
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,829
that was burned in the rock wall of the Egyptian temple

229
00:18:02,854 --> 00:18:04,790
thousands of years ago.

230
00:18:05,663 --> 00:18:09,452
Now we travel across continents, from Egypt to China,

231
00:18:09,707 --> 00:18:14,841
where the same geometry appears in another sacred site, built in 1420.

232
00:18:15,524 --> 00:18:18,263
Then you go to the Forbidden City,

233
00:18:18,288 --> 00:18:20,736
the sun gods reside

234
00:18:20,951 --> 00:18:25,638
and where you find that the ancients, the "foo dogs"

235
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,150
the guardians of the knowledge.

236
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:32,366
They guard the knowledge under their paw.

237
00:18:33,501 --> 00:18:38,955
The same geometry, with 64 energy units, is encoded again.

238
00:18:39,115 --> 00:18:41,749
I started wondering, is it just a coincidence,

239
00:18:41,774 --> 00:18:46,861
that the exact same design appears in significant places on two different continents?

240
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,491
But then, Nassim showed me, that this geometry of 64,

241
00:18:51,516 --> 00:18:57,022
is encoded time and again in cultures across the centuries and from all over the world.

242
00:18:57,515 --> 00:19:00,008
The Hebrew kabbalistic tree of life

243
00:19:00,144 --> 00:19:03,008
creates the same structure, we just saw,

244
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:06,713
with the vector equilibrium again embedded at every level.

245
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:11,244
The ancient Chinese system of wisdom, called the I-Ching,

246
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:14,006
is based on 64 hexagrams,

247
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:16,457
symbols with six lines in a set,

248
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:18,860
some coninuous, some broken.

249
00:19:19,456 --> 00:19:23,269
These can be put together as the six edges of a tetrahedron

250
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:27,334
and together would form the 64 tetrahedran crystal.

251
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:36,118
Ephesus, Turkey

252
00:19:36,143 --> 00:19:40,001
Golden Temple of Sikhs', Amritsar, Punjab, India, sec. XVI

253
00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:44,685
The same pattern shows up in modern scientific research.

254
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,968
The double helix has an alphabet of 64 codons,

255
00:19:49,032 --> 00:19:52,278
that are used to encode our human DNA.

256
00:19:54,757 --> 00:19:59,064
I had seen that there was advanced knowledge of the living geometry of the universe

257
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:00,800
thousands of years ago.

258
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:03,677
But how on Earth did they know about it?

259
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,953
Most of the stories of ancient Egypt and Mayans and Incas

260
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:12,622
talk about sun gods coming to the Earth

261
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:19,020
and teaching them engineering and writing and all of their science.

262
00:20:19,664 --> 00:20:21,452
I started to wonder,

263
00:20:21,477 --> 00:20:27,656
if all these sun gods were not advanced civilizations,

264
00:20:27,681 --> 00:20:31,095
coming from another part of our galaxy.

265
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:37,098
These texts and of many ancient cultures describe them as coming in flying boats

266
00:20:37,123 --> 00:20:41,673
or, in the Vedic tradition, flying machines, etc.

267
00:20:45,824 --> 00:20:50,365
There are many mentions of these sun gods coming through time.

268
00:21:01,155 --> 00:21:04,184
Could these early pilots from beyond our world

269
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:08,061
be the ones responsible for sharing the knowledge of this code?

270
00:21:08,237 --> 00:21:12,714
Could they actually be tapping its power to propel themselves through the cosmos?

271
00:21:16,814 --> 00:21:19,958
This isn't were I thought my research would lead me

272
00:21:20,014 --> 00:21:22,826
and these notions were rocking my world.

273
00:21:23,438 --> 00:21:27,029
But Nassim is impressive evidence to back up his theories

274
00:21:27,054 --> 00:21:31,093
and I could see no other rational way, advanced math and physics concepts,

275
00:21:31,175 --> 00:21:34,005
would have been recorded over 3000 years ago.

276
00:21:34,433 --> 00:21:37,359
I sort out one of the most knowledgeable investigators:

277
00:21:37,384 --> 00:21:38,797
Dr. Steven Greer,

278
00:21:38,822 --> 00:21:42,470
the founder of the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

279
00:21:43,338 --> 00:21:47,933
He's conducted hundreds of interviews with top ranking government and military witnesses.

280
00:21:48,477 --> 00:21:51,135
And so, if we talk about extraterrestrial intelligence,

281
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,654
we're talking about civilizations,

282
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,143
that have reached the point of being sentient, like we are,

283
00:21:59,366 --> 00:22:04,233
but whose technologies and perhaps social capabilities are such,

284
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,402
that they've been able to become interstellar

285
00:22:05,803 --> 00:22:08,403
or interplanetary civilisations.

286
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:12,909
And we look at the fact that, in most concerned estimates in Milky Way galaxy,

287
00:22:12,934 --> 00:22:18,058
that there are at least 10 000 earth-like planets, that have intelligent life on them

288
00:22:18,693 --> 00:22:23,057
and at least half of them are likely to be as advanced or more advanced than ours.

289
00:22:23,406 --> 00:22:26,605
It's almost a certainty, that there's intelligent life out there,

290
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:31,169
that has mastered the laws of the universe,

291
00:22:31,488 --> 00:22:33,998
beyond what's currently taught at MIT and Caltech,

292
00:22:34,308 --> 00:22:39,034
to be able to transfer through space time, in real time

293
00:22:40,328 --> 00:22:42,872
through vast distances of interstellar space.

294
00:22:43,032 --> 00:22:45,896
We have over 4 000 cases

295
00:22:46,143 --> 00:22:49,073
were these objects have landed on terraforma

296
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:51,083
and left physical evidence.

297
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,696
We have over 3 500 pilot cases.

298
00:22:54,903 --> 00:22:56,967
We have hundreds of cases,

299
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:02,186
including ones from the highest ranking investigator of the FAA, John Callahan

300
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:05,798
and numerous other operators, where these objects have been tracked on radar,

301
00:23:05,823 --> 00:23:08,415
going tens of thousands of miles per hour

302
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,196
or dematerializing and then reappearing in another point in the sky.

303
00:23:12,221 --> 00:23:17,353
Yes, there have been ET visitations, there have been crashed craft,

304
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:21,858
there have been material and bodies recovered.

305
00:23:22,232 --> 00:23:26,827
We have contact with aliens,

306
00:23:27,177 --> 00:23:29,771
not originating from some foreign country,

307
00:23:29,923 --> 00:23:32,082
but from some other solar system.

308
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:34,299
And I've been a party to that.

309
00:23:34,324 --> 00:23:37,559
There were documents that I have seen,

310
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,774
referred to the USS Roosevelt

311
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:44,320
having several instances of UFO flyovers

312
00:23:44,345 --> 00:23:48,229
and particularly, after they took on board nuclear weapons.

313
00:23:48,254 --> 00:23:52,439
And my CEO told me, what you got in your log did never happen.

314
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:55,357
The crew coming on duty and the crew coming off duty

315
00:23:55,382 --> 00:23:58,511
all saw the UFO just hovering in mid air.

316
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,004
It was a metallic, circular object

317
00:24:01,203 --> 00:24:05,047
and, from what I understand, the missiles were all shut down.

318
00:24:05,206 --> 00:24:07,168
That meant it went dead.

319
00:24:07,494 --> 00:24:09,628
And something turned those missiles off.

320
00:24:09,653 --> 00:24:12,889
Now remember, all the set was flying in several thousand miles per hour.

321
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:16,501
So this thing fires a beam of light at the warhead, hits it

322
00:24:16,526 --> 00:24:18,581
and then this thing flies up, like this,

323
00:24:18,606 --> 00:24:21,759
meanwhile, we're all going like this, fires another beam of light,

324
00:24:21,887 --> 00:24:25,258
goes around like this, fires another beam of light

325
00:24:25,283 --> 00:24:27,219
goes around like this, fires another beam of light

326
00:24:27,244 --> 00:24:29,683
and then flies out the way it came in

327
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:33,382
and the warhead tumbles to outer space.

328
00:24:34,652 --> 00:24:39,044
The feeling at the time was that it must have been extraterrestial

329
00:24:39,148 --> 00:24:43,048
They took the film and they spooled off the part, that had the UFO on it

330
00:24:43,173 --> 00:24:47,897
and they took a pair of scissors and cut it off, they put that on a separate roll, they put it in the briefcase,

331
00:24:48,001 --> 00:24:50,583
they handed Major Mansmann back the rest of the film

332
00:24:50,608 --> 00:24:54,466
and said: "I don't need to remind you, major Mansmann,

333
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,448
of the severity of the security breach.

334
00:24:57,552 --> 00:25:00,006
We'll consider this incident closed! "

335
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:05,965
But who do you tell, that you were involved in a UFO incident,

336
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,987
without them looking at you as if you're not wrapped too tight?

337
00:25:09,186 --> 00:25:12,876
<i>Mexico military releases photos of alleged UFOs</i>

338
00:25:12,901 --> 00:25:16,229
<i>French get a look at the nation's UFO files</i>

339
00:25:16,254 --> 00:25:19,922
<i>Vatican says alien life may exist</i>

340
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:24,365
Out of all the evidence for the existence of UFOs

341
00:25:24,461 --> 00:25:29,459
one extraordinary phenomenon continues to astonish and inspire me.

342
00:25:30,436 --> 00:25:34,970
The appearance throughout the world of so-called "crop circles".

343
00:25:35,892 --> 00:25:41,316
These elaborate designs appear mysteriously swirled into crops of grain,

344
00:25:41,396 --> 00:25:46,009
in such a way, that the stocks are bend over, yet remain alive.

345
00:25:47,518 --> 00:25:52,233
More than 5 000 of these patterns have appeared in over 30 countries

346
00:25:53,067 --> 00:25:54,832
most of them in England.

347
00:25:56,238 --> 00:25:59,941
The media has led many people, including me at first,

348
00:26:00,156 --> 00:26:03,448
to write these crop patterns off as hoaxes,

349
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,378
the nighttime work of a few pranksters.

350
00:26:07,252 --> 00:26:09,928
Of course there have been fake versions,

351
00:26:10,024 --> 00:26:12,329
but those made by human hands are crude,

352
00:26:12,354 --> 00:26:15,867
compared with the vast majority of these elegant creations.

353
00:26:16,804 --> 00:26:21,058
Could hoaxers have created all 5 000 of these patterns?

354
00:26:22,035 --> 00:26:24,249
Could a few people with ropes and boards

355
00:26:24,265 --> 00:26:28,464
have created something as complex and beautiful as this one,

356
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,306
made in the dead of night, in a driving rain

357
00:26:31,331 --> 00:26:33,996
and leaving no footprints on the soil?

358
00:26:35,242 --> 00:26:40,639
The electromagnetic field over the area, where the crop's been laid down to create the image,

359
00:26:40,664 --> 00:26:43,395
is often electrostatically charged.

360
00:26:44,189 --> 00:26:48,053
Some of these areas are littered with strange magnetic particles.

361
00:26:51,221 --> 00:26:55,903
One of the most amazing crop designs is not a circle, but a rectangle

362
00:26:55,928 --> 00:27:01,848
that seems to be a direct response to a message sent out into space in 1974.

363
00:27:05,483 --> 00:27:07,674
The message was a radio signal

364
00:27:07,699 --> 00:27:12,251
depicting our planet's location in the solar system and Earth's people,

365
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:17,597
in hopes that it might be received and interpreted by an extraterrestial intelligence.

366
00:27:18,881 --> 00:27:22,287
27 years later, in 2001,

367
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:24,901
This crop design appeared in England,

368
00:27:25,115 --> 00:27:28,683
along with, what could be a self-portrait of the sender.

369
00:27:28,716 --> 00:27:32,214
This message maches the format of the NASA signal

370
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:35,615
and describes a different solar system from ours,

371
00:27:35,868 --> 00:27:37,737
a picture of the sender,

372
00:27:37,762 --> 00:27:39,698
non-human DNA

373
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,546
and a microwave antenna they apparently use to communicate,

374
00:27:44,634 --> 00:27:47,704
rather than radio antenna, that we used.

375
00:27:50,025 --> 00:27:52,951
The antenna symbol had appeared a year earlier,

376
00:27:52,976 --> 00:27:54,990
in exactly the same field,

377
00:27:55,015 --> 00:27:58,018
right next to a working radio wave antenna

378
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:01,708
like the one NASA used to send out the original signal.

379
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:09,766
NASA continues to officially deny extraterrestial contact of any kind.

380
00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:16,542
And yet, year after year,

381
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:19,301
these spectacular creations appear.

382
00:28:35,806 --> 00:28:39,519
So what might these remarkable designs mean?

383
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,045
Here are some two-dimensional versions,

384
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,810
that seem to be revealing the torus, in 3D.

385
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,680
And here is the vector equilibrium,

386
00:29:35,087 --> 00:29:37,515
and the related pattern of 64,

387
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,219
that we saw encoded in the art of so many ancient cultures.

388
00:30:07,012 --> 00:30:11,793
When I saw the coherence between the crop circles and ancient encodings,

389
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:16,716
I thought regardless of whoever created them and wherever they're from,

390
00:30:16,741 --> 00:30:19,975
there must be an important purpose to these designs.

391
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,989
They're so coherent

392
00:30:22,426 --> 00:30:26,961
I've come to believe that the pattern of the torus and the vector equilibrium

393
00:30:27,311 --> 00:30:30,940
especially in the form of the 64 tetrahedran crystal,

394
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:33,947
is showing us how energy works in the universe,

395
00:30:33,972 --> 00:30:36,487
so that we can learn to align with it.

396
00:30:36,862 --> 00:30:39,079
I believe that they are giving us a model

397
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:43,814
for accessing energy in a clean, safe and limitless way

398
00:30:44,434 --> 00:30:46,615
and the new means of propulsion.

399
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:50,607
What more important message could there be to get to us

400
00:30:50,632 --> 00:30:53,005
and especially now, from their perspective,

401
00:30:53,108 --> 00:30:57,392
as we're beginning to extend our careless reach beyond our planet?

402
00:30:58,835 --> 00:31:01,452
I got further confirmation of this notion,

403
00:31:01,477 --> 00:31:03,407
when I met Dr. Jack Kasher,

404
00:31:03,432 --> 00:31:06,698
a former professor of physics at the University of Nebraska,

405
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:09,396
who has also researched UFO fenomena.

406
00:31:09,532 --> 00:31:11,719
Presentating at The Sequoia Symposium,

407
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,863
Dr. Kosher showed a remarkable series of drawings,

408
00:31:14,888 --> 00:31:17,088
by a woman named Lane Andrews,

409
00:31:17,113 --> 00:31:21,295
who claimed to have been invited on to extraterrestial spacecraft.

410
00:31:21,637 --> 00:31:26,307
I was startled to see her detailed scetches of the toroidal energy field,

411
00:31:26,332 --> 00:31:28,323
that she said, propelled the vehicle

412
00:31:28,348 --> 00:31:30,380
and protected the passengers.

413
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:37,596
I subsequently interviewed James Gilliland.

414
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,291
James has many hours of UFO footage

415
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:43,726
from his ranch near Mount Adams in Washington State.

416
00:31:43,822 --> 00:31:47,956
He also claimed to going on board of alien spacecraft.

417
00:31:47,981 --> 00:31:51,385
What blew my mind was that he had never never met Lane Andrews

418
00:31:51,455 --> 00:31:53,973
and had no knowledge of her experience,

419
00:31:53,998 --> 00:31:57,529
yet he described a phenomenon, that was amazingly similar:

420
00:31:57,966 --> 00:32:00,983
numerous ships with spinning rings of light.

421
00:32:04,364 --> 00:32:06,297
Could it simply be coincidental,

422
00:32:06,322 --> 00:32:09,741
that James and Lane describe the same torus dynamic

423
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:15,493
and that both of these people have been harassed extensively by government and military agencies ?

424
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:19,707
To some the idea of UFOs may seem crazy

425
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:24,286
and yet from another perspective it is completely plausible.

426
00:32:24,533 --> 00:32:28,159
The Earth is about 4.5 billion years old,

427
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:31,527
that's 4,500 million years old.

428
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,061
What if there is another planet, that is almost exactly like ours,

429
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,553
almost exactly

430
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:39,525
4.501 million years old?

431
00:32:39,613 --> 00:32:41,602
They're million years ahead of us,

432
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:46,081
and on a galactic scale they're almost our twin brothers.

433
00:32:46,415 --> 00:32:48,938
So where are we gonna be in a million years?

434
00:32:48,963 --> 00:32:51,950
We have solved all these problems and there's another way,

435
00:32:51,975 --> 00:32:55,739
weather it's wormholes or warping space.

436
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:00,264
There's got to be a way to generate energy

437
00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:02,948
so that you could pull it out of the vacuum.

438
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:07,589
And the fact that they are here, shows us, that they found a way.

439
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:13,851
This is a major shock to the human system, that is in progress.

440
00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:16,629
I understand why people of our generation,

441
00:33:16,654 --> 00:33:20,071
people who aspired to positions of political leadership, etc..,

442
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:23,746
never dear go near that question, because it's a worldview change,

443
00:33:23,771 --> 00:33:26,573
it is a fundamental worldview change.

444
00:33:26,598 --> 00:33:30,333
So here we are, a relatively immature species,

445
00:33:30,358 --> 00:33:33,068
struggling with possible self-destruction!

446
00:33:33,942 --> 00:33:35,741
If aligning with the torus

447
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:40,210
does hold the key to a new form of clean, safe energy access,

448
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:42,123
imagine the implications!

449
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:47,048
This could be the most important technology breakthrough of our times!

450
00:33:48,385 --> 00:33:52,872
So who wouldn't want to have an energy source, that's unlimited and freely available?

451
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:55,971
That turned out to be a key question,

452
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,322
that's what led me down the next rabbit hole.

453
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:18,282
It turns out that scientists as far back as the early 1900

454
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:21,841
have been developing alternative ways to access electricity

455
00:34:21,866 --> 00:34:23,632
without combustion.

456
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:29,505
Nikola Tesla believed he had tapped into what he called "radiant energy".

457
00:34:30,164 --> 00:34:34,197
Many scientists believe he was accessing what's now called free energy.

458
00:34:34,712 --> 00:34:37,206
But before Tesla could finish the project,

459
00:34:37,318 --> 00:34:39,940
its financier, banker JP Morgan,

460
00:34:40,056 --> 00:34:43,541
who had a monopoly on the copper used for electrical lines,

461
00:34:43,637 --> 00:34:48,588
recognized how Tesla's invention could transmit electricity without wires.

462
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,718
he then shut down Tesla's funding.

463
00:34:52,711 --> 00:34:56,217
Tesla's lab was burned down and he was ostracized,

464
00:34:56,281 --> 00:35:00,909
all for trying to implement his vision of unlimited energy for everyone.

465
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:11,209
A modern day inventor Adam Trombly was inspired by Tesla's work

466
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,723
and by the possibilities of the torus.

467
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:18,126
Trombly built a dynamo, a direct current generator,

468
00:35:18,151 --> 00:35:21,439
that accessed electrical power right out of the air.

469
00:35:21,971 --> 00:35:26,989
We were trying to demonstrate that by mimicing the magnetic field of a planet

470
00:35:27,014 --> 00:35:31,212
and rotating this device, we can actually create a dynamo, that would work.

471
00:35:31,292 --> 00:35:34,328
And, in fact, it did work, and it does work.

472
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:37,639
So when we contemplate nature, when we contemplate Jupiter

473
00:35:37,664 --> 00:35:40,370
or we contemplate a dynamo like the earth rotating in space,

474
00:35:40,395 --> 00:35:43,123
we basically have a magnet, that is rotating in space

475
00:35:43,346 --> 00:35:47,762
the lines of flux of the magnet are pulling down and through

476
00:35:47,787 --> 00:35:51,110
in this toroidal pattern of the magnetic field.

477
00:35:51,459 --> 00:35:54,611
It's also expanding and contracting - it's breathing.

478
00:35:54,636 --> 00:35:58,128
It's taking in the energy of space literally and transforming it.

479
00:35:58,183 --> 00:36:01,107
Right here in this toroid, we have enough energy

480
00:36:01,132 --> 00:36:03,493
to transform the entire earth.

481
00:36:03,518 --> 00:36:07,338
And that's not just a theoretical statement, it's literally true!

482
00:36:07,784 --> 00:36:09,831
If we contemplate the implications of this

483
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:14,786
means that every single place on Earth suddenly has power,

484
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:18,238
every single person on Earth suddenly has power.

485
00:36:18,461 --> 00:36:20,905
We have universal abundance!

486
00:36:21,423 --> 00:36:26,834
Trombly had been invited to demonstrate one of his generators at the UN and the U.S. Senate

487
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:30,881
but these events were undermined by the first Bush administration,

488
00:36:31,207 --> 00:36:34,964
then the device itself was taken in a government raid.

489
00:36:37,433 --> 00:36:39,904
Trombly's experience isn't unique.

490
00:36:40,095 --> 00:36:42,344
Almost every time I found an inventor,

491
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:45,870
with a promising new technology in the field of free energy,

492
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:48,720
he told us similar story of suppression.

493
00:36:48,797 --> 00:36:50,695
Inventor John Bedini

494
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:55,519
began working with Tesla's theories of radiant energy, decades ago

495
00:36:55,544 --> 00:36:58,916
and has produced a sortment of battery charging devices

496
00:36:58,941 --> 00:37:02,431
that generate more energy, than it takes to run them.

497
00:37:03,035 --> 00:37:06,600
He announced, that he was going to start offering them at low cost.

498
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,440
Soon after that he was attacked in his lab

499
00:37:09,465 --> 00:37:11,909
and swore not to produce the devices.

500
00:37:12,672 --> 00:37:16,512
For his own safety, he had to let go of marketing free energy.

501
00:37:17,632 --> 00:37:21,807
These are all devices from labs I personally visited.

502
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:37,276
The quality of this footage is obviously poor

503
00:37:37,301 --> 00:37:39,627
and I'm not expecting this to convince you.

504
00:37:40,136 --> 00:37:44,930
My point is, that being there with these inventors, accompanied by experts

505
00:37:44,955 --> 00:37:48,266
and seeing these new energy devices in operation

506
00:37:48,418 --> 00:37:50,956
convinced me that the technology is real

507
00:37:51,251 --> 00:37:55,171
and the implications of that to me are absolutely thrilling.

508
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:00,483
Canadian John Hutchison not only created some free energy batteries

509
00:38:00,674 --> 00:38:03,960
but also used Tesla's theories to counter gravity,

510
00:38:04,071 --> 00:38:06,627
to make objects float.

511
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:09,904
This could revolutionize the field of propulsion.

512
00:38:10,729 --> 00:38:12,246
His lab was raded

513
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:16,435
and equipment was taken by police and government officials in 1978,

514
00:38:16,436 --> 00:38:18,036
1985,

515
00:38:18,237 --> 00:38:20,046
and again in 2000.

516
00:38:20,641 --> 00:38:23,927
One of the scientists we were going to interview for this film,

517
00:38:23,952 --> 00:38:25,925
was Dr. Eugene Mallove,

518
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,344
an engineer from MIT and Harvard

519
00:38:28,424 --> 00:38:30,884
and editor of "Infinite Energy" magazine,

520
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:36,385
which covers both theoretical and technological developments in the new energy field.

521
00:38:43,282 --> 00:38:47,317
Dr. Mallove was mysteriously beaten to death in 2004.

522
00:38:49,897 --> 00:38:53,668
If these inventors were all hoaxers and charlatans,

523
00:38:53,843 --> 00:38:58,811
I wonder why are they being suppressed so consistently and so brutally?

524
00:38:59,272 --> 00:39:02,113
I asked free energy inventor Adam Trombly,

525
00:39:02,138 --> 00:39:05,178
why he thought this technology was being suppressed

526
00:39:05,203 --> 00:39:07,932
and if the UFO phenomenon was related.

527
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:13,553
We've had major military people, taking great risk to themself, say, yes, these things are real.

528
00:39:13,578 --> 00:39:16,076
Why do you think the military-industrial complex

529
00:39:16,101 --> 00:39:18,123
doesn't want that statement to be made?

530
00:39:18,473 --> 00:39:23,492
Because you start thinking about, what kind of technology is behind that.

531
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:25,769
That's the bottom line.

532
00:39:25,794 --> 00:39:28,050
The suppression of UFO phenomena

533
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:31,402
is hand in hand with the suppression of so-called free energy.

534
00:39:31,427 --> 00:39:36,327
The energy is extracted from the fabric of space around us,

535
00:39:36,399 --> 00:39:38,827
which means it can not be metered.

536
00:39:39,026 --> 00:39:44,213
This is a direct threat to the single largest industry in the world: energy

537
00:39:44,238 --> 00:39:46,605
It's goodbye Exxon Mobil,

538
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:48,630
goodbye oil,

539
00:39:48,741 --> 00:39:50,545
goodbye coal

540
00:39:50,729 --> 00:39:54,645
goodbye linear transmission of electricity through power lines.

541
00:39:54,852 --> 00:39:56,931
All that gone!

542
00:39:57,535 --> 00:40:02,354
Unfortunately, it's someone's 200 trillion dollar piggy bank.

543
00:40:02,454 --> 00:40:07,427
The proven oil, gas and coal reserves are worth over 200 trillion dollars.

544
00:40:12,206 --> 00:40:14,468
This information coming out ...

545
00:40:15,905 --> 00:40:19,764
would completely change geopolitical power ...

546
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:26,389
more than anything else in recorded human history.

547
00:40:28,841 --> 00:40:31,115
And would happen in a generation!

548
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:34,817
I started to examine the breakthrough solutions

549
00:40:35,103 --> 00:40:37,006
and, to much to my surprise,

550
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:42,112
These concepts have been proven in hundreds of laboratories throughout the world.

551
00:40:42,137 --> 00:40:45,637
And yet, they have not rally seen the light of day.

552
00:40:45,998 --> 00:40:48,342
Rather than smashing things together

553
00:40:48,367 --> 00:40:50,532
and trying to control the explosion,

554
00:40:50,557 --> 00:40:53,697
these new technologies rely on blending,

555
00:40:53,722 --> 00:40:57,097
of dancing with what naturally is.

556
00:40:59,216 --> 00:41:03,308
The common denominator of all the free energy devices, I have seen,

557
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:07,643
is that it mimic, in one way or another, the torus energy shape.

558
00:41:08,429 --> 00:41:11,201
You don't have to believe in free energy technology,

559
00:41:11,226 --> 00:41:14,534
to be concerned about the repression of ideas and inventions.

560
00:41:14,749 --> 00:41:16,452
I found myself thinking,

561
00:41:16,477 --> 00:41:19,423
what better way to justify our dependence on oil,

562
00:41:19,441 --> 00:41:21,264
coal, nuclear

563
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:23,903
and other dangerous and dirty technologies,

564
00:41:23,928 --> 00:41:27,626
and to claim there's no better, cheaper alternatives?

565
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:31,293
It was my beloved wife and creative partner Kimberly,

566
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:35,435
who kept bringing me back to the human implications of my scientific research.

567
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:41,824
For me, as intrigueing as the torus and ETs and free energy are,

568
00:41:42,057 --> 00:41:44,359
the most compelling question was:

569
00:41:44,447 --> 00:41:49,363
Would understanding these things really help alleviate human suffering in any way?

570
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,934
And it turnes out, it can!

571
00:41:52,688 --> 00:41:57,528
So much of the pain on the planet has to do with the lack of access to energy.

572
00:41:58,195 --> 00:42:00,030
Can you stay warm?

573
00:42:00,714 --> 00:42:02,990
Can you get food and water?

574
00:42:03,713 --> 00:42:06,010
Can you get hospital care?

575
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:09,641
All that has to do with energy access.

576
00:42:10,063 --> 00:42:12,234
If there is a fundamental pattern

577
00:42:12,259 --> 00:42:15,864
- which makes sense to me, that evolution would be efficient in that way

578
00:42:16,024 --> 00:42:19,709
and we can align with that pattern to create new technologies,

579
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:21,762
that would solve these problems,

580
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:24,151
that it's worthy to me to open my mind

581
00:42:24,176 --> 00:42:26,420
to these socially taboo subjects.

582
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:30,540
If the new energy technologies were to be set free worldwide,

583
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:33,481
the change would be profound.

584
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,941
It would affect everybody,

585
00:42:35,966 --> 00:42:38,596
it would be applicable everywhere.

586
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:41,645
These technologies are absolutely

587
00:42:41,646 --> 00:42:46,246
the most important thing that's happened in the history of the world.

588
00:42:45,905 --> 00:42:48,348
So given the stakes, I decided to ask:

589
00:42:48,373 --> 00:42:51,519
Who's benefiting from suppressing scientific research?

590
00:42:52,044 --> 00:42:56,726
Whose wealth and power are threatened by access to clean free energy?

591
00:42:57,261 --> 00:43:01,452
Who has a motive to set up a world, where so few have so much

592
00:43:01,532 --> 00:43:03,638
and so many have so little?

593
00:43:04,552 --> 00:43:09,444
As an independent researcher, I followed one of the cardinal rules of investigative journalism:

594
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,969
If a story doesn't make sense, follow the money!

595
00:43:16,417 --> 00:43:21,789
<b>Following the Money</b>

596
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,773
Our being dependent on oil

597
00:43:25,798 --> 00:43:29,956
insures, that energy corporations continue to reap phenomenal profits.

598
00:43:30,822 --> 00:43:35,379
I see them commiting huge resources to undermine energy alternatives

599
00:43:35,475 --> 00:43:37,827
to control global reserves

600
00:43:37,852 --> 00:43:40,407
and maintain high oil prices.

601
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,741
They have enough money and influence,

602
00:43:42,766 --> 00:43:46,218
to suppress anything that might threaten the monopoly.

603
00:43:46,243 --> 00:43:49,476
So who's behind the huge energy corporations?

604
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,059
The Rockefeller's oil empire got started in 1870,

605
00:43:54,084 --> 00:43:56,725
when John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil

606
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,164
and became America's first billionaire.

607
00:43:59,633 --> 00:44:04,132
Standard Oil has since morfed into Exxon Mobil and others.

608
00:44:05,053 --> 00:44:08,055
And Rockefellers control our food as well!

609
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:10,126
They were primarly responsible

610
00:44:10,151 --> 00:44:14,222
for the global shift to large-scale petroleum-based agriculture

611
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:19,787
I remember the so-called "green revolution" in the 60s and 70s.

612
00:44:20,399 --> 00:44:23,803
Like most people, I thought it was a great thing.

613
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:29,044
It was however based on the planting of huge plots with a single crop,

614
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:34,728
using vast amounts of oil-based fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides.

615
00:44:35,689 --> 00:44:41,237
The Green Revolution was the brainchild of the Rockefeller Foundation's natural science division,

616
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:44,661
in partnership with large agricultural corporations.

617
00:44:45,138 --> 00:44:47,208
Petroleum-based agriculture

618
00:44:47,233 --> 00:44:50,508
provided vast new profits for the oil industry,

619
00:44:50,644 --> 00:44:52,902
but never lived up to its promises

620
00:44:52,927 --> 00:44:56,000
of ending hunger and promoting health.

621
00:44:56,462 --> 00:44:59,930
The Green Revolution did at first increase productivity,

622
00:44:59,955 --> 00:45:03,900
because every bit of soil was being used for immediate production,

623
00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:06,932
but its true cost can now be seen.

624
00:45:07,217 --> 00:45:10,256
Taxpayers pay billions in subsidies,

625
00:45:10,344 --> 00:45:13,005
to giant agricultural corporations.

626
00:45:13,387 --> 00:45:17,015
Small family farms have all but disappeared.

627
00:45:17,365 --> 00:45:19,832
Biodiversity is destroyed,

628
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,974
toxic chemicals poison farmworkers and pollute the land,

629
00:45:24,149 --> 00:45:26,515
water and our food supply,

630
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:29,000
endangering the health of us all,

631
00:45:29,057 --> 00:45:34,355
as of 2010, aproximally one in every seven people worldwide

632
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,663
did not have enough to eat.

633
00:45:37,941 --> 00:45:42,505
The giant corporations were brought us chemicals for chemical industrial agriculture.

634
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:47,360
And we were talking about three instruments to consolidate the food chain.

635
00:45:47,432 --> 00:45:50,600
The first was genetic engineering as a way of control.

636
00:45:51,997 --> 00:45:56,405
The second was patenting seed and patenting life as a way of control,

637
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:59,322
declaring seeds to be private property

638
00:46:00,005 --> 00:46:03,774
treating the saving of seeds by farmers as a crime,

639
00:46:03,807 --> 00:46:06,461
as a theft of intellectual property.

640
00:46:06,835 --> 00:46:10,983
And the third was so-called free trade treaties,

641
00:46:11,008 --> 00:46:16,000
that would drop ordinary people, farmers, growers off their freedom,

642
00:46:16,025 --> 00:46:17,596
to save seed.

643
00:46:17,621 --> 00:46:22,033
The design of "terminator" technology to create sterile seed

644
00:46:22,058 --> 00:46:26,517
in order to impose even more dependence of humanity

645
00:46:26,542 --> 00:46:29,641
on a handful of corporations, it would be ultimate step in this.

646
00:46:30,372 --> 00:46:32,816
We are of what we are doing with seeds,

647
00:46:32,841 --> 00:46:34,762
literally, for the first time

648
00:46:34,787 --> 00:46:39,127
creating a new colonization, which I call the colonization of the future.

649
00:46:40,868 --> 00:46:44,312
<i>Who controls the food supply, controls the people;</i>

650
00:46:44,361 --> 00:46:47,847
<i>who controls the energy, can control whole continents;</i>

651
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:51,319
<i>who controls the money, can control the world. Henry Kissinger, 1973</i>

652
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:55,508
So in two srucial areas, energy and food,

653
00:46:55,533 --> 00:46:59,484
same elite banking families and their corporations have taken control

654
00:46:59,937 --> 00:47:02,619
and the consequences have been devastating.

655
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:05,383
For me it was overwhelming at first,

656
00:47:05,408 --> 00:47:07,916
to discover such a monopoly of influence,

657
00:47:07,941 --> 00:47:09,766
but I knew it was important,

658
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:13,031
like learning you have a tough, but treatable disease,

659
00:47:13,056 --> 00:47:18,008
it helps to understand, what's causing it and how it operates, if the goal is to cure.

660
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:20,293
So I continued my investigation.

661
00:47:20,444 --> 00:47:23,875
If oil and food are controlled by the big banking families

662
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,653
where else does their influence show up?

663
00:47:26,733 --> 00:47:30,276
As I followed the money, I began to see the same pattern of control

664
00:47:30,301 --> 00:47:32,625
in just about every area of our lives

665
00:47:32,737 --> 00:47:35,432
and always found the same families in charge,

666
00:47:35,457 --> 00:47:38,257
either directly through their banks and corporations,

667
00:47:38,282 --> 00:47:41,154
or indirectly through their major foundations.

668
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:45,943
Again it was the Rockefellers, who created the National Education Association,

669
00:47:46,047 --> 00:47:50,136
with help from the Carnegie Foundation and later from the Ford Foundation.

670
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:53,470
What the captains of industry wanted from our schools,

671
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:56,028
was an obedient and docile work force,

672
00:47:56,053 --> 00:47:59,533
who would be manageable employees and eager consumers.

673
00:47:59,558 --> 00:48:05,554
Schools are to establish fixed habits of response to Authority.

674
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:07,943
That's why it takes 12 years

675
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:10,576
for you to respond reflexibly,

676
00:48:10,649 --> 00:48:15,298
when anyone in the position of authority, tells you what to do.

677
00:48:16,966 --> 00:48:22,001
Like education, health is another area dominated by big money and corporations.

678
00:48:22,668 --> 00:48:27,201
The American Medical Association, for example, is largely funded by the Rockefellers,

679
00:48:27,226 --> 00:48:31,515
who use their funding to influence AMA research and decision making.

680
00:48:31,857 --> 00:48:35,007
The average MD has four years of medical school,

681
00:48:35,032 --> 00:48:37,460
takes one course in nutrition,

682
00:48:37,808 --> 00:48:40,427
two and half hours in many cases

683
00:48:40,452 --> 00:48:44,007
and these materials used - curriculum materials -

684
00:48:44,032 --> 00:48:46,429
are supplied by the National Dairy Council

685
00:48:46,454 --> 00:48:48,426
and the National Livestock and Meat Board

686
00:48:48,451 --> 00:48:51,022
and other industries, including the Sugar Association,

687
00:48:51,047 --> 00:48:54,159
with products to sell, that actually undermine our health in the first place

688
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:58,872
Unfortunately, the way the system of medicine is set up,

689
00:48:59,341 --> 00:49:06,405
medical education is primarly funded by pharmaceutical companies,

690
00:49:06,795 --> 00:49:12,819
so there's a motive to make and sell as many drugs as possible.

691
00:49:13,018 --> 00:49:17,262
It is also a time effective way of making money

692
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:22,010
for the phycician, for the pharmaceutical company, for the whole medical establishment.

693
00:49:22,487 --> 00:49:27,158
But it's really perpetuating the problems, it was ment to alleviate.

694
00:49:27,183 --> 00:49:30,692
<i>Side effects may include nausea, dry mouth and constipation.</i>

695
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:33,214
<i>Increases in white blood cells, which can be serious ...</i>

696
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:36,327
<i>Sexual side effects, diarrhea, nausea and sleepiness.</i>

697
00:49:36,352 --> 00:49:38,534
<i>Can lead to coma or death.</i>

698
00:49:39,749 --> 00:49:42,665
How far will these forces go, to make a profit?

699
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:45,432
Would they actually suppress cures for diseases,

700
00:49:45,457 --> 00:49:48,378
the way they suppressed free energy technology?

701
00:49:48,704 --> 00:49:52,623
Sadly my research has shown me, the answer is yes.

702
00:49:52,957 --> 00:49:57,047
One well documented example is the case of Dr. Royal Rife.

703
00:49:57,849 --> 00:50:02,640
In the 1920s Dr. Rife invented one of the most advanced microscopes of his time.

704
00:50:03,085 --> 00:50:07,070
He also developed a new technique he called coordinated resonance.

705
00:50:07,166 --> 00:50:10,774
which was apparently able to destroy cancerous tumors,

706
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,548
as well as viruses.

707
00:50:13,191 --> 00:50:18,669
In 1934, in clinical trials affiliated with the University of Southern California,

708
00:50:18,773 --> 00:50:23,327
Rife's treatment was tested on 16 terminally ill cancer patients.

709
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:27,822
Within three months, they were all sucessfully cured.

710
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:32,397
Soon after, a lab testing Rife's technology was burned down

711
00:50:32,422 --> 00:50:34,574
and a fatuous lawsuit was filed.

712
00:50:35,447 --> 00:50:37,654
Through the efforts of Morris Fishbein,

713
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:40,642
head of the jurnal of American Medical Association,

714
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:43,488
Rife was essentially shut down and ruined,

715
00:50:43,513 --> 00:50:47,143
his brilliant and promising work all but forgotten.

716
00:50:48,335 --> 00:50:50,456
It was really hard for me to consider,

717
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:53,275
that someone might actually be supressing cures.

718
00:50:53,807 --> 00:50:57,617
and cancer has run through my family like a raging river.

719
00:50:58,713 --> 00:51:01,787
I found out that it's all about patents.

720
00:51:02,256 --> 00:51:06,612
If a pharmaceutical company can patent and make money from treatment,

721
00:51:06,637 --> 00:51:09,062
especially one, that we have to keep on using,

722
00:51:09,087 --> 00:51:10,691
then that's what we get.

723
00:51:10,753 --> 00:51:13,138
Otherwise we don't even hear about it.

724
00:51:13,401 --> 00:51:16,117
It's not just Rife, who got shut down.

725
00:51:16,292 --> 00:51:20,822
Rene Caisse had an old indian ojibwa formula, that was effective.

726
00:51:21,195 --> 00:51:25,145
Harry Hoxsey and Max Gerson had natural remedies, that worked.

727
00:51:25,265 --> 00:51:30,094
But you know and you look them out, the AMA makes them sound like complete crooks.

728
00:51:30,364 --> 00:51:33,699
And that's for following the money has been so helpful,

729
00:51:33,724 --> 00:51:38,681
because the same powers, who control the AMA and their research and funding,

730
00:51:38,706 --> 00:51:40,693
control the pharmaceuticals.

731
00:51:40,781 --> 00:51:44,383
So there's a multi-trillion dollar financial incentive,

732
00:51:44,408 --> 00:51:47,225
to supress cures, that can't be patented.

733
00:51:47,552 --> 00:51:49,465
Knowing that cures exist,

734
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,135
has not taken away the anguish I feel

735
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,294
from losing so many people, I love, to cancer.

736
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:59,373
It's giving me something really satisfying to do with the pain

737
00:51:59,684 --> 00:52:03,361
and I believe when we take the love and devotion that we have,

738
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:07,436
for anyone who's died and who will die unnecessarily

739
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,503
and are direct it to developing and getting these cures out

740
00:52:10,528 --> 00:52:12,246
to people, who need them,

741
00:52:12,271 --> 00:52:15,779
we can break this cancer legacy and heal.

742
00:52:24,148 --> 00:52:26,219
As difficult as it was for me,

743
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:30,206
I've come to an inescapable and profoundly disturbing conclusion:

744
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:34,449
I belive that an elite group of people and the corporations they run,

745
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,290
have gained control over not just our energy,

746
00:52:37,311 --> 00:52:40,963
food supply, education and health care,

747
00:52:40,988 --> 00:52:44,042
but over virtually every aspect of our lives.

748
00:52:44,106 --> 00:52:47,401
And they do it by controlling the world of finance,

749
00:52:47,426 --> 00:52:49,392
not by creating more value,

750
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:52,946
but by actually controlling the source of money.

751
00:52:53,859 --> 00:52:58,184
When I followed the money, I found that it took me up the levels of a pyramid.

752
00:52:59,026 --> 00:53:02,623
Here we are at the bottom level, going about our daily lives!

753
00:53:03,036 --> 00:53:04,737
Above us is government,

754
00:53:04,762 --> 00:53:07,435
people who are given a monopoly on force

755
00:53:07,491 --> 00:53:11,388
and use it to tax and control us, whether or not we agree.

756
00:53:11,793 --> 00:53:13,750
But who controlls them?

757
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,653
At the next level are the corporations.

758
00:53:16,678 --> 00:53:22,001
Many would say that it is now corporations and not nation states, that rule the world.

759
00:53:22,026 --> 00:53:24,379
They call it a"corporatocracy".

760
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:27,907
To acquire the world's resources and control the markets,

761
00:53:27,932 --> 00:53:31,016
this corporatocracy must to have access to cheap money.

762
00:53:31,151 --> 00:53:35,406
The big corporations get their loans with special rates from big banks,

763
00:53:35,431 --> 00:53:39,437
which means that those who control the major banks, the money elite,

764
00:53:39,462 --> 00:53:41,840
ultimately control the corporations.

765
00:53:42,436 --> 00:53:47,452
As I followed the money, I learned that almost everything I once believed about money,

766
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:49,452
is simply not true.

767
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:53,881
It's interesting how few questions we actually ask

768
00:53:53,906 --> 00:53:56,325
about very everyday things,

769
00:53:56,350 --> 00:54:01,701
like when we go into a bank and we ask for a loan, say $ 50,000 dollars, 50,000 pounds.

770
00:54:01,845 --> 00:54:03,813
What actually happens?

771
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:06,631
See, most people live their lives,

772
00:54:06,656 --> 00:54:10,301
based on a kind of vague image of what happens.

773
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:13,908
What actually happens, is you ask for 50,000 pounds,

774
00:54:13,933 --> 00:54:16,877
they type into your account 50,000 pounds.

775
00:54:16,902 --> 00:54:18,769
That's all they do!

776
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:23,472
They don't mint any coins, print any money

777
00:54:23,536 --> 00:54:26,201
they don't move any precious metal anywhere

778
00:54:26,226 --> 00:54:29,576
they just put 50,000 pounds into your account in a computer screen.

779
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:33,541
From that moment, you start paying interest

780
00:54:33,566 --> 00:54:37,582
on money, that has never, does not and will never exist.

781
00:54:39,479 --> 00:54:44,074
It turns out, that banks actually have about 9 times as much money loaned out,

782
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:46,613
as they have on reserve in their vaults.

783
00:54:46,876 --> 00:54:51,476
This is possible because of what's referred to as fractional reserve lending.

784
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:56,501
The way it works is that the Federal Reserve or the central bank in any country

785
00:54:56,701 --> 00:55:00,994
is legally allowed to determine the amount of bank must have on reserve.

786
00:55:01,208 --> 00:55:04,023
In the U.S. it's currently around 10%.

787
00:55:04,881 --> 00:55:07,952
So if you deposit $ 10,000 dollars into the bank,

788
00:55:08,127 --> 00:55:12,402
the bank sets aside 10% or $ 1,000 dollars

789
00:55:12,427 --> 00:55:15,204
and then loans out the rest of your money.

790
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:19,061
The way it works is, say another person comes into the bank

791
00:55:19,086 --> 00:55:21,991
and asks for a car loan of $ 9,000 dollars.

792
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:25,708
At this moment, the bank loans out the $ 9,000 dollars,

793
00:55:25,733 --> 00:55:27,671
from your original deposit.

794
00:55:27,751 --> 00:55:29,634
It isn't there anymore!

795
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:33,468
The borrower then pays the person selling the car

796
00:55:33,651 --> 00:55:36,319
and they go to deposit the money into another bank,

797
00:55:36,353 --> 00:55:39,353
which is part of the same central banking system.

798
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:43,351
This $ 9,000 dollars is treated as a new deposit

799
00:55:43,376 --> 00:55:45,449
and the process continues.

800
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,417
The money gets redeposited and reloaned,

801
00:55:48,442 --> 00:55:51,400
until the initial deposit of $ 10,000 dollars

802
00:55:51,552 --> 00:55:54,127
becomes $ 100,000 dollars.

803
00:55:55,176 --> 00:55:59,985
The banking system just created $ 90,000 dollars by loaning out your money.

804
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:04,570
Apparently it began with the goldsmiths in the seventeenth century,

805
00:56:04,595 --> 00:56:06,713
when people were trading in gold.

806
00:56:07,055 --> 00:56:11,915
Gold was heavy to carry around, so people stored the actual metal in vaults

807
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:14,180
and traded receipts instead.

808
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:17,154
Those receipts were the first paper money.

809
00:56:17,369 --> 00:56:21,749
Since only a few people would withdraw their gold at any given time,

810
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:24,583
the vault owners, basically the new bankers,

811
00:56:24,686 --> 00:56:28,922
began creating receipts for more metals, than they actually held.

812
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:32,975
They loaned out those receipts and charged interest on money,

813
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,647
on gold that they didn't really had.

814
00:56:36,172 --> 00:56:40,079
That's how our so-called fractional reserve system was born.

815
00:56:40,548 --> 00:56:44,060
In this system the bankers get to make money out of nothing,

816
00:56:44,085 --> 00:56:47,434
while the rest of us have to work hard to earn it.

817
00:56:47,459 --> 00:56:49,980
It has created a modern form of serfdom,

818
00:56:50,005 --> 00:56:54,679
where the mass of society is now working, to pay off their debt to the banks

819
00:56:58,429 --> 00:57:01,319
<i>"It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand </i>

820
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,620
<i>our banking and monetary system,</i>

821
00:57:03,669 --> 00:57:07,612
<i>for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution</i>

822
00:57:07,613 --> 00:57:11,213
<i>before tomorrow morning. Henry Ford, 1922"</i>

823
00:57:11,381 --> 00:57:13,622
Under this fractional reserve scheme

824
00:57:13,647 --> 00:57:15,799
we inevitably become debt slaves

825
00:57:15,824 --> 00:57:18,465
to a ruling class of financial elite.

826
00:57:18,529 --> 00:57:21,622
Not because they are better or smarter than anyone else,

827
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:23,880
but because they have rigged the system

828
00:57:23,905 --> 00:57:27,854
to benefit themselves at the expense of most people on the planet.

829
00:57:28,505 --> 00:57:31,925
Catherine Austin Fitts is an expert on this issue.

830
00:57:32,135 --> 00:57:35,318
He was assistant secretary of housing and urban development

831
00:57:35,343 --> 00:57:37,658
under president George Bush senior

832
00:57:37,722 --> 00:57:40,513
and then an adviser to the Clinton administration.

833
00:57:40,609 --> 00:57:44,383
Lets set up a game of Monopoly and you want to buy a part place,

834
00:57:45,363 --> 00:57:50,204
What I can continually do is just print money, give myself more money,

835
00:57:50,696 --> 00:57:53,746
lower the value of your money by printing more.

836
00:57:53,826 --> 00:57:56,239
No mather how hard working you are

837
00:57:56,541 --> 00:57:58,563
or how successful you are

838
00:57:58,588 --> 00:58:01,284
I can always end up buying you for free.

839
00:58:01,816 --> 00:58:05,499
So how come if you or I make money, it's called counterfeiting

840
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:09,041
but if the banks do it, it's increasing the money supply?

841
00:58:09,589 --> 00:58:12,247
How did the banks get this power?

842
00:58:13,176 --> 00:58:15,118
This is Jekyll Island,

843
00:58:15,143 --> 00:58:19,891
where in 1910, representatives from the Rockefeller family, Rothschilds,

844
00:58:19,946 --> 00:58:22,159
Morgans and other private bankers

845
00:58:22,184 --> 00:58:23,969
gathered secretly,

846
00:58:23,994 --> 00:58:27,684
to draft the legislation, that would create the Federal Reserve.

847
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:32,716
Ed Griffin literally wrote the book on what happened on Jekyll Island.

848
00:58:33,447 --> 00:58:37,998
Central banks are banking cartels,

849
00:58:38,403 --> 00:58:41,721
which have gone into partnership with the respected governments,

850
00:58:41,722 --> 00:58:44,322
on the countries where they operate

851
00:58:43,654 --> 00:58:50,622
and they've been given monopolistic power over the creation of the nations money supply.

852
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:55,620
That what the politicians handed to them as a gift, you might say, for the partnership

853
00:58:55,645 --> 00:58:59,112
Now, in return, what do the bankers do for the politicians?

854
00:58:59,311 --> 00:59:03,620
I promise to create money out of nothing, now that they got this legal power to do it,

855
00:59:03,645 --> 00:59:05,797
anytime the government needs it.

856
00:59:05,965 --> 00:59:07,711
And since 2008,

857
00:59:07,736 --> 00:59:12,196
we witnessed the greatest fake money printing run in recorded history.

858
00:59:13,165 --> 00:59:16,764
This financial sleight of hand disguises the cost,

859
00:59:17,019 --> 00:59:18,865
hides who's to blame

860
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:22,355
and leaves us as debt slaves working to pay off the bill.

861
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:28,392
I find it revealing, that in the same year the Federal Reserve was founded, 1913

862
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:31,590
the internal revenue service was also established.

863
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:33,925
An income tax was then instigated,

864
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:38,131
so you and I would have to pay the politicians debt, plus interest,

865
00:59:38,156 --> 00:59:39,571
to the bankers.

866
00:59:39,596 --> 00:59:45,067
The problem is we have a privately owned central bank system, in U.S.

867
00:59:45,092 --> 00:59:48,530
disguised as a government-owned system.

868
00:59:48,555 --> 00:59:53,756
If you look in the phone book here in the Washington DC area,

869
00:59:54,343 --> 00:59:58,644
you look up for Federal Reserve and the blue government pages, it's not there.

870
00:59:58,677 --> 01:00:01,997
It's in the white pages, right next to Federal Express.

871
01:00:02,022 --> 01:00:04,673
It's a privately owned central bank.

872
01:00:04,698 --> 01:00:07,650
What is the proper relationship ...

873
01:00:07,675 --> 01:00:10,782
What should be the proper relationship between the Chairman of the Fed

874
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:12,915
and a president of U.S.?

875
01:00:13,908 --> 01:00:17,527
- Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency.

876
01:00:17,552 --> 01:00:19,539
And that means basically, that ...

877
01:00:20,786 --> 01:00:28,109
there is no other agency of government, which can overrule actions that we take.

878
01:00:29,705 --> 01:00:35,419
... There is no other agency of government, which can overrule actions that we take.

879
01:00:35,959 --> 01:00:40,612
We have a private bank, that prints money on behalf of the Treasury.

880
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:43,981
The Federal Reserve prints money on a debt based system,

881
01:00:44,006 --> 01:00:46,002
which creates scarcity,

882
01:00:46,257 --> 01:00:49,328
but it puts a group of insiders in a position,

883
01:00:49,482 --> 01:00:53,441
of having access to all the data about economy, when we don't.

884
01:00:53,966 --> 01:00:58,551
So you have a small group of bankers, who understand the idea of how money works in economy

885
01:00:58,759 --> 01:01:01,328
and gives them the ability to print money

886
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:04,606
in a way that the insiders are protected

887
01:01:04,631 --> 01:01:06,492
and everybody else is drained.

888
01:01:07,032 --> 01:01:11,394
Catherine went on to compare a healthy economy to a vibrant torus,

889
01:01:11,419 --> 01:01:15,444
balanced, freely flowing and energized throughout,

890
01:01:15,612 --> 01:01:18,684
in contrast to what's happening in our current economy.

891
01:01:19,002 --> 01:01:24,683
What we have is a system that's very dynamic

892
01:01:24,945 --> 01:01:26,939
and it's trying to optimize.

893
01:01:27,868 --> 01:01:32,543
But intertwined in the core of it, we have a tapeworm.

894
01:01:33,353 --> 01:01:35,845
The way a tapeworm works in your body

895
01:01:35,985 --> 01:01:38,762
is to inject the chemical into your body,

896
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:42,836
that makes you crave what's good for the tapeworm and bad for you.

897
01:01:43,043 --> 01:01:49,253
We have a parasite, that's very much manipulating and engorging itself

898
01:01:49,254 --> 01:01:51,854
at the expense of the whole.

899
01:01:51,806 --> 01:01:53,868
We live in a tapeworm economy,

900
01:01:53,893 --> 01:01:56,271
where the financial elite are the tapeworm,

901
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:58,021
and they're feeding on us

902
01:01:58,348 --> 01:02:00,973
and don't like it, when people blow their cover.

903
01:02:01,854 --> 01:02:06,577
After Catherine began exposing government corruption at the highest levels,

904
01:02:06,602 --> 01:02:10,382
the FBI raided her company and ceased its assets.

905
01:02:10,565 --> 01:02:13,620
She was dragged through the courts for ten years,

906
01:02:13,645 --> 01:02:15,830
before being found innocent.

907
01:02:17,005 --> 01:02:19,065
So we got the Federal Reserve,

908
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:23,136
a privately owned corporation with a monopoly on creating money,

909
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:25,478
but with no countability,

910
01:02:25,503 --> 01:02:28,977
backed up by a government with a monopoly on force.

911
01:02:29,773 --> 01:02:31,711
The country got sold on the Fed

912
01:02:31,736 --> 01:02:34,855
as an institution that would help stabilize the economy

913
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,482
and remain independent of politics.

914
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:40,734
But in fact, in close to a century of existence,

915
01:02:40,759 --> 01:02:43,712
The Federal Reserve has done just the opposite.

916
01:02:44,387 --> 01:02:47,977
Since they took charge, we've been robbed through inflation

917
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:52,355
and the purchasing power of the dollar has declined more than 96%.

918
01:02:54,442 --> 01:02:56,403
And the wealth gap makes it clear,

919
01:02:56,429 --> 01:02:59,037
most of the money is going to a very few.

920
01:03:03,370 --> 01:03:06,949
Only 16 years after the Federal Reserve was in power,

921
01:03:07,109 --> 01:03:09,709
America experienced the Great Depression.

922
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:14,435
My research revealed that before the great crash in 1929,

923
01:03:14,563 --> 01:03:17,838
elite bankers pulled their money out of the stock market.

924
01:03:18,275 --> 01:03:20,778
After the crash they used that money,

925
01:03:20,803 --> 01:03:23,878
to buy up cheap stocks and smaller failing banks

926
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,590
for pennys on the dollar.

927
01:03:26,027 --> 01:03:29,146
Among the bankers who consolidated their wealth this way, were

928
01:03:29,171 --> 01:03:32,499
the Rothschilds, Rockefellers and Morgans.

929
01:03:33,151 --> 01:03:37,322
A similar scenario played out in the 2008 financial collapse,

930
01:03:37,347 --> 01:03:39,649
with the same bankers benefiting.

931
01:03:39,674 --> 01:03:41,868
In the years leading up to the collapse,

932
01:03:41,893 --> 01:03:46,825
the biggest banks, including Bank of America, City Group and Chase,

933
01:03:47,262 --> 01:03:50,513
controlled by the Rothschilds, Rockefellers and Morgans,

934
01:03:50,831 --> 01:03:53,279
were bundling and trading bad loans,

935
01:03:53,304 --> 01:03:55,910
that they knew would eventually fail

936
01:03:58,791 --> 01:04:01,432
It's like putting rotten oranges in a box

937
01:04:01,457 --> 01:04:03,949
and selling them as grade AAA.

938
01:04:04,411 --> 01:04:07,631
The bundlers of the dept knew it was only a matter of time,

939
01:04:07,656 --> 01:04:09,824
before someone would open that box

940
01:04:09,849 --> 01:04:12,307
and see that the content was worthless,

941
01:04:12,332 --> 01:04:15,479
They were the ones, who packed the boxes in the first place

942
01:04:16,527 --> 01:04:19,276
When the rotten oranges, what we hear about is

943
01:04:19,301 --> 01:04:23,593
unsound loans, derivatives and credit default swaps

944
01:04:23,721 --> 01:04:27,200
were finally discovered, everyone was impacted.

945
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:33,761
People lost their homes, their jobs, their businesses and their retirements.

946
01:04:34,277 --> 01:04:38,145
Meanwhile, the biggest banks, who created the problem in the firstplace,

947
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:40,708
were the ones who got bailed out.

948
01:04:40,733 --> 01:04:42,209
Why is that?

949
01:04:42,281 --> 01:04:45,538
Why would the Federal Reserve give trillions to the banks,

950
01:04:45,563 --> 01:04:49,404
even though the majority of Americans were against bailing them out?

951
01:04:49,724 --> 01:04:51,898
And why not help those most in need,

952
01:04:51,923 --> 01:04:55,007
rather than the perpetrators of financial collapse?

953
01:04:56,063 --> 01:05:00,735
My research led me to believe that the same people who created the Federal Reserve

954
01:05:01,045 --> 01:05:04,370
the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers and the Morgans,

955
01:05:04,529 --> 01:05:07,661
still control it and use this scheme,

956
01:05:07,686 --> 01:05:10,675
to bail themself out at our expence

957
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:15,860
<i>"[The banks] are still the most powerful lobby on Capital Hill</i>

958
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:19,034
<i>and they, frankly, own the place. "</i>

959
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:24,764
I'm convinced that the near collapse of the economy in 2008,

960
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:28,090
resulted from an orchestrated "pump and dump" scheme,

961
01:05:28,145 --> 01:05:30,539
designed and executed by the big bankers,

962
01:05:30,564 --> 01:05:33,278
to consolidate wealth and power.

963
01:05:34,014 --> 01:05:37,303
David Icke explains how he sees the Federal Reserve

964
01:05:37,328 --> 01:05:40,162
rigging the so-called "business cycles".

965
01:05:40,416 --> 01:05:43,061
Stage One is like throwing a fishing line out

966
01:05:43,467 --> 01:05:44,884
Stage One ...

967
01:05:45,484 --> 01:05:50,417
you put lots of money - units of exchange - into circulation.

968
01:05:50,442 --> 01:05:53,011
You do this by pushing interest rates down

969
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:55,426
by making lots of loans.

970
01:05:55,641 --> 01:05:59,324
This is the part of a cycle, we call a boom.

971
01:05:59,745 --> 01:06:02,633
Because there's lots of units of exchange in circulation

972
01:06:02,658 --> 01:06:04,808
there's lots of money changing hands.

973
01:06:04,857 --> 01:06:09,179
That generates lots of economic activity, that generates jobs

974
01:06:09,204 --> 01:06:14,159
and as more and more money is spent, there's more demand.

975
01:06:14,184 --> 01:06:18,876
So companies take out more loans, and fresh air money

976
01:06:19,004 --> 01:06:21,496
to increase their production.

977
01:06:21,552 --> 01:06:24,107
People get confident in their everyday lives:

978
01:06:24,132 --> 01:06:27,428
"Hey, you know, I work for this company, they got lots of orders,

979
01:06:27,453 --> 01:06:29,929
it's really going great, my job is safe

980
01:06:29,954 --> 01:06:31,984
I tell you what, we can have a bigger house."

981
01:06:32,009 --> 01:06:34,195
Then they start to change it!

982
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:37,825
What they do is they pull the fishing line in.

983
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,630
They push interest rates up!

984
01:06:40,655 --> 01:06:45,935
Now fewer people are taking out loans

985
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:51,025
and they make the criteria for having a loan from the bank stronger anyway

986
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:54,653
And also, now, as interest rates have gone up,

987
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:59,220
a larger part of people's income is going to bay back the extra interest

988
01:06:59,245 --> 01:07:02,227
and not being circulated in buying things.

989
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:03,444
Suddenly ...

990
01:07:03,985 --> 01:07:06,614
there's nothing like as much money in circulation

991
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:09,619
and therefore, fewer things are being bought.

992
01:07:10,578 --> 01:07:13,980
Companies start to go down in terms of their profits,

993
01:07:14,005 --> 01:07:16,181
they start to shed jobs

994
01:07:16,206 --> 01:07:18,319
and they start to go out of business.

995
01:07:18,391 --> 01:07:21,548
People lose their jobs, they can't pay the mortgage anymore,

996
01:07:21,573 --> 01:07:23,981
of the big house they took out in the good times.

997
01:07:24,133 --> 01:07:28,641
Now, what the banks are doing, is starting to roll the fishing line in,

998
01:07:28,666 --> 01:07:32,650
because, as they go bankrupt, companies and individuals

999
01:07:32,826 --> 01:07:35,023
banks get the real wealth,

1000
01:07:35,048 --> 01:07:40,585
the property, the land, the resources, they signed the loan,

1001
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:43,840
for lending nearly figures on a screen.

1002
01:07:44,086 --> 01:07:48,799
Now this economic cycle of fishing line out, fishing line back,

1003
01:07:48,824 --> 01:07:51,393
lots of units in circulation - pull them in,

1004
01:07:51,418 --> 01:07:53,677
has been going on for centuries.

1005
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:55,594
And what it's done ...

1006
01:07:56,475 --> 01:08:01,681
it's stolen and accumulated the real wealth of the world

1007
01:08:01,706 --> 01:08:03,820
in the hands of the few.

1008
01:08:04,492 --> 01:08:09,762
<i>"Give me control over a nation's currency and I care not who makes it's laws"</i>

1009
01:08:10,381 --> 01:08:14,213
At the international level, central bankers use the World Bank

1010
01:08:14,293 --> 01:08:16,220
and International Monetary Fund,

1011
01:08:16,245 --> 01:08:20,989
to make more money, while exploiting the resources of countries they lend to,

1012
01:08:21,133 --> 01:08:23,526
bankrupting them in the process.

1013
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:26,772
The central bank of central banks

1014
01:08:26,797 --> 01:08:30,353
is the Rothschild created Bank for International Settlements.

1015
01:08:34,688 --> 01:08:36,802
The elite are positioning themselves

1016
01:08:36,827 --> 01:08:40,707
to control access to virtually everything we need to survive.

1017
01:08:41,458 --> 01:08:43,624
Nomather were you go in the world,

1018
01:08:43,649 --> 01:08:46,307
the money is controlled by the banking system.

1019
01:08:49,046 --> 01:08:51,980
They decide if people eat or if they don't eat,

1020
01:08:53,624 --> 01:08:57,131
who's a billionaire and who lives on less than a dollar a day.

1021
01:09:00,217 --> 01:09:02,600
He who controls the money, controls the world

1022
01:09:02,625 --> 01:09:05,669
and very few control the money.

1023
01:09:09,241 --> 01:09:13,114
At this point, my view of the world had been turned upside down.

1024
01:09:13,631 --> 01:09:18,041
I was struggling with the realisation that the failure and suffering of so many

1025
01:09:18,248 --> 01:09:21,605
is actually a success and fulfillment for a few,

1026
01:09:22,129 --> 01:09:27,041
the elite central bankers, who fooled the world into letting them create money.

1027
01:09:27,703 --> 01:09:30,169
They already have vast fortunes.

1028
01:09:30,194 --> 01:09:32,115
So what is their endgame?

1029
01:09:32,283 --> 01:09:34,422
What is their ultimate agenda?

1030
01:09:38,247 --> 01:09:43,573
<b>Uncovering The Global Domination Agenda</b>

1031
01:09:46,961 --> 01:09:49,707
<i>"When an honest man discovers he is mistaken,</i>

1032
01:09:49,733 --> 01:09:52,220
<i>he will either cease being mistaken,</i>

1033
01:09:52,353 --> 01:09:54,702
<i>or cease being honest. "</i>

1034
01:09:57,711 --> 01:10:02,140
I kept running across compelling evidence and credible experts,

1035
01:10:02,165 --> 01:10:05,084
saying that the secret agenda of the banking elite

1036
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:08,128
is nothing less than total global domination.

1037
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:11,140
At first I resisted the idea,

1038
01:10:11,275 --> 01:10:15,511
but I was committed to finding out, what was keeping us from thriving,

1039
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,554
nomather where it might lead

1040
01:10:18,396 --> 01:10:21,811
One night I woke up at 3 am, with a burning question:

1041
01:10:21,993 --> 01:10:25,787
If this small group wanted to dominate the entire world,

1042
01:10:25,953 --> 01:10:28,997
What would they need to control, to accomplish it?

1043
01:10:29,609 --> 01:10:32,536
I jumped out of bed and started making a list.

1044
01:10:35,705 --> 01:10:38,378
First and foremost they had to control money.

1045
01:10:38,403 --> 01:10:39,988
And they do!

1046
01:10:40,290 --> 01:10:43,537
Controlling money allows them to run anything else.

1047
01:10:44,236 --> 01:10:46,038
They need to control energy.

1048
01:10:46,063 --> 01:10:47,263
And they do!

1049
01:10:48,152 --> 01:10:51,605
They already control big agriculture and world trade

1050
01:10:51,772 --> 01:10:54,254
they're buying up water supplies worldwide.

1051
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:57,374
They've got health in their pocket

1052
01:10:57,399 --> 01:11:00,152
and they are trying to suppress natural alternatives.

1053
01:11:01,002 --> 01:11:03,968
Mainly, they have to control what information we get

1054
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:05,885
and how we react to.

1055
01:11:07,289 --> 01:11:12,387
In America, the Internet, our greatest tool for communication and grassroots organizing

1056
01:11:12,412 --> 01:11:15,091
is currently not controlled or censored,

1057
01:11:15,362 --> 01:11:18,693
but its open status is being attacked from all sides.

1058
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:24,152
Governments, corporations and the UN are all attempting to take control,

1059
01:11:25,288 --> 01:11:28,892
for complete domination dissent has to be controlled.

1060
01:11:28,972 --> 01:11:30,972
They need to take away our rights,

1061
01:11:30,997 --> 01:11:32,820
spy on ordinary citizens

1062
01:11:32,845 --> 01:11:35,675
and track every aspect of our lives.

1063
01:11:37,795 --> 01:11:39,093
As the day dawned,

1064
01:11:39,118 --> 01:11:43,371
I knew that a powerful elite had almoust everything set up to rule the world

1065
01:11:43,737 --> 01:11:47,509
and I had a frighting realization, that Big Brother is not just coming,

1066
01:11:47,597 --> 01:11:49,048
he's here now!

1067
01:11:49,318 --> 01:11:51,309
We're already in the matrix,

1068
01:11:51,389 --> 01:11:53,286
So how do we get out?

1069
01:11:53,527 --> 01:11:56,385
To envision that, I realized I needed to discover

1070
01:11:56,410 --> 01:11:59,608
what their ruling structure looks like and how it works.

1071
01:11:59,714 --> 01:12:01,913
A relatively small group of families,

1072
01:12:01,938 --> 01:12:05,686
especially the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Morgans and Carnegies,

1073
01:12:05,758 --> 01:12:08,847
along with the Harrimans, Schiffs and the Warburgs,

1074
01:12:08,935 --> 01:12:12,621
have been leading the controlling elite in the west for generations.

1075
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:16,933
I'm not implying that every individual in these families

1076
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:20,447
is aware or active in the global domination agenda.

1077
01:12:21,123 --> 01:12:24,250
However, I am convinced that the heads of these dynasties

1078
01:12:24,275 --> 01:12:26,781
control the corporate and banking interests

1079
01:12:26,861 --> 01:12:30,891
to carry out the sinister scheme that's destroying so many lives.

1080
01:12:32,145 --> 01:12:36,606
Those secretly driving the agenda have been known by many names.

1081
01:12:37,146 --> 01:12:41,654
Late reports confirm that they meet throughout the world behind closed doors

1082
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:43,592
to discuss their agenda.

1083
01:12:43,617 --> 01:12:47,117
Then like clockwork, their plans begin to show up in the media

1084
01:12:47,165 --> 01:12:51,368
finance, corporate, government and military arenas.

1085
01:12:51,804 --> 01:12:56,082
Of course not everyone involved in these groups is in on the decision making.

1086
01:12:56,154 --> 01:12:59,474
There is a hierarchy of knowledge and participation.

1087
01:13:01,792 --> 01:13:06,502
One of the primary symbols of the controlling elite is the all-seeing eye.

1088
01:13:06,678 --> 01:13:08,726
It's on the dollar bill,

1089
01:13:08,792 --> 01:13:11,254
it's on the American mass surveillance system,

1090
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:14,167
initially called "Total Information Awareness"

1091
01:13:14,628 --> 01:13:17,826
it's on the British intelligence agency MI-5

1092
01:13:18,097 --> 01:13:21,837
and it even oversees the Supreme Court complex in Israel,

1093
01:13:21,862 --> 01:13:25,227
designed and funded entirely by the Rothschilds.

1094
01:13:25,691 --> 01:13:29,490
I believe they've taken the majestic image of the Cheops pyramid

1095
01:13:29,594 --> 01:13:32,170
and it's legendary metallic capstone

1096
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:35,448
and perverted the meaning, to represent those at the top,

1097
01:13:35,483 --> 01:13:39,221
being able to track and control all those under them.

1098
01:13:43,372 --> 01:13:46,975
One of the painful ways this information has been used

1099
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,126
is by people who want to promote anti-semitism.

1100
01:13:50,402 --> 01:13:53,119
They wrongly call this a "Jewish agenda"

1101
01:13:53,144 --> 01:13:55,138
and continue the ongoing racism,

1102
01:13:55,163 --> 01:13:58,469
that undermines and destroys so many lives.

1103
01:13:59,285 --> 01:14:03,069
Let me be clear: this is definitely not a Jewish agenda

1104
01:14:03,967 --> 01:14:08,633
It's been documented the central bankers even funded both sides of WW II

1105
01:14:08,919 --> 01:14:13,839
as well as some of the corporations associated with Hitler's atrocities against the Jews.

1106
01:14:14,466 --> 01:14:16,530
Since these people have more money

1107
01:14:16,555 --> 01:14:19,513
than their families would need for generations

1108
01:14:19,596 --> 01:14:22,334
and since they have the power to create money

1109
01:14:22,359 --> 01:14:25,238
I don't believe wealth is their endgoal.

1110
01:14:25,728 --> 01:14:30,228
After you have all the material things that you could possibly want in life,

1111
01:14:30,253 --> 01:14:32,451
what is left to excite you?

1112
01:14:32,515 --> 01:14:35,469
And for many people the answer is power!

1113
01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:37,226
Global power!

1114
01:14:37,251 --> 01:14:39,988
They became intellectually elite,

1115
01:14:40,013 --> 01:14:44,526
they began to think that they had a plan, that was better than anybody else's plan,

1116
01:14:45,019 --> 01:14:49,426
they got the idea, that freedom is dangerous.

1117
01:14:49,514 --> 01:14:52,440
If you give people freedom, you know what?

1118
01:14:52,465 --> 01:14:56,591
They propably not going to use it wisely like we think they should.

1119
01:14:56,806 --> 01:14:58,950
We are smarter than they are

1120
01:14:58,991 --> 01:15:02,792
and for their own good, we should rule them.

1121
01:15:04,476 --> 01:15:09,645
As I came to accept the idea of a ruling elite planning for total global domination,

1122
01:15:09,757 --> 01:15:11,731
I began to hear the same people,

1123
01:15:11,756 --> 01:15:15,089
actually talking more boldly and publicly about it,

1124
01:15:15,114 --> 01:15:17,812
only they call it the "new world order".

1125
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:20,798
<i>When we are successfull</i>

1126
01:15:20,823 --> 01:15:22,374
<i>and we will be</i>

1127
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:25,208
<i>we have a real chance of this new world order.</i>

1128
01:15:25,233 --> 01:15:27,407
<i>It is a new world order</i>

1129
01:15:27,432 --> 01:15:31,590
<i>with significantly different and radically new challenges. </i>

1130
01:15:31,615 --> 01:15:35,551
<i>The new world order can be created - it's a great opportunity!</i>

1131
01:15:36,676 --> 01:15:42,491
<i>"There is urgent need for a true world political authority."</i>

1132
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:45,188
Given the condition of our world,

1133
01:15:45,213 --> 01:15:48,562
a new world order can sound like a great idea,

1134
01:15:48,672 --> 01:15:53,116
but I had to distinguish between what I was discovering about global domination,

1135
01:15:53,246 --> 01:15:56,023
a one world government run by an elite few

1136
01:15:56,174 --> 01:15:59,347
and the reality of our global interconnectedness,

1137
01:15:59,546 --> 01:16:03,649
which is the realization that at a fundamental and even spiritual level,

1138
01:16:03,674 --> 01:16:06,473
are not separate, we are all connected.

1139
01:16:06,957 --> 01:16:11,083
But the agenda for global domination is really the exact opposite.

1140
01:16:11,432 --> 01:16:13,824
It's a "divide and conquer" strategy

1141
01:16:13,849 --> 01:16:16,327
to keep us all betted against eachother

1142
01:16:16,352 --> 01:16:18,849
thinking that it's the democrats or republicans,

1143
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:21,411
the liberals or conservatives, who are the problem,

1144
01:16:21,474 --> 01:16:25,132
when both parties are ultimately serving the same plan.

1145
01:16:25,601 --> 01:16:29,462
I belive we're heading toward a totalitarian world authority,

1146
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:33,417
actually a military dictatorship run by a tiny elite,

1147
01:16:33,442 --> 01:16:35,751
who have all the power and make all the rules.

1148
01:16:35,926 --> 01:16:40,288
If they succeed, there will be nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.

1149
01:16:40,558 --> 01:16:42,408
Think about it!

1150
01:16:45,849 --> 01:16:48,338
The whole notion of conspiracy

1151
01:16:48,363 --> 01:16:50,366
has been so ridiculed,

1152
01:16:50,391 --> 01:16:53,684
that it's socially challenging just to consider it

1153
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:56,513
and there's always a reasonable sounding story

1154
01:16:56,538 --> 01:16:59,329
to explain any one incident at a time.

1155
01:16:59,876 --> 01:17:02,102
I personally used to try to justify

1156
01:17:02,127 --> 01:17:07,150
how the same people consistently ended up with more money and more control,

1157
01:17:07,175 --> 01:17:13,048
by thinking: "They must just be taking advantage of the situation, but not actually causing it."

1158
01:17:13,946 --> 01:17:18,346
But after nearly a decade of putting the issues and the evidence together,

1159
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:21,470
I am convinced, it is not random

1160
01:17:21,495 --> 01:17:25,046
and if few very powerful banking elite families

1161
01:17:25,071 --> 01:17:27,198
and their political and corporate partners

1162
01:17:27,223 --> 01:17:31,052
do have an agenda to dominate and control the rest of us.

1163
01:17:32,132 --> 01:17:35,774
Once I got the reality and the scope of the agenda,

1164
01:17:35,799 --> 01:17:39,695
I really had to think, how much do I want to know about this.

1165
01:17:39,862 --> 01:17:44,058
Do I want to focus on the worst of what human beings are capable of?

1166
01:17:44,527 --> 01:17:47,943
We decided it is worth knowing who these people are

1167
01:17:47,968 --> 01:17:50,487
and how their organizations operate,

1168
01:17:50,607 --> 01:17:54,433
because on the other side of the rage and the sadness

1169
01:17:54,568 --> 01:17:56,848
are clarity and strength,

1170
01:17:56,873 --> 01:18:00,626
the power we have to focus our efforts effectively,

1171
01:18:00,651 --> 01:18:03,606
now that we understand what's really going on.

1172
01:18:05,042 --> 01:18:08,788
The greatest prison, where people live in,

1173
01:18:09,042 --> 01:18:12,280
is the fear of what other people think.

1174
01:18:12,352 --> 01:18:15,966
What happened to me, as a result of the ridicule I went through,

1175
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:20,124
is that I stepped out of the fear of what other people thought

1176
01:18:20,498 --> 01:18:22,966
and it's only when you do it,

1177
01:18:22,991 --> 01:18:26,513
that you realize, what a prison you lived in before.

1178
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:31,920
And what it gave me was a personal understanding,

1179
01:18:32,365 --> 01:18:36,928
of how easy it is for a few to control the many.

1180
01:18:36,953 --> 01:18:38,828
All you have to do

1181
01:18:38,908 --> 01:18:41,908
is dictate the norms in society,

1182
01:18:42,076 --> 01:18:46,483
what is considered right and wrong, moral and immoral, good and bad,

1183
01:18:46,508 --> 01:18:49,235
sane and insane, possible and impossible

1184
01:18:49,966 --> 01:18:50,728
and

1185
01:18:51,483 --> 01:18:55,106
you build what I call a "a hustle-free zone"

1186
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:59,808
and if you live your life within that zone of perception belief

1187
01:18:59,936 --> 01:19:02,041
and what you say and think,

1188
01:19:02,066 --> 01:19:04,992
then people will leave you alone because you are normal.

1189
01:19:05,422 --> 01:19:08,303
Once you step out of that place

1190
01:19:08,328 --> 01:19:10,869
and you start to express your uniqueness,

1191
01:19:11,084 --> 01:19:13,306
what the Illuminati have created,

1192
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:19,024
is a whole human population of the prison wardens,

1193
01:19:19,049 --> 01:19:23,556
who are jumping on those, that are stepping out of the norm.

1194
01:19:24,597 --> 01:19:26,401
And it's interesting,

1195
01:19:26,426 --> 01:19:30,282
when you get to the edge of that hustle-free zone by what you say and think,

1196
01:19:30,441 --> 01:19:35,315
you're not thinking: "If I do, that about the head of the World Bank?".

1197
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:36,221
No!

1198
01:19:36,246 --> 01:19:38,898
We say "What will mother think?"

1199
01:19:39,081 --> 01:19:42,658
or the guys down the bar or people at work, what would they say?.

1200
01:19:43,024 --> 01:19:46,884
And what the Illuminati have done, by creating the norms,

1201
01:19:47,202 --> 01:19:52,456
they have created an absolute army of people,

1202
01:19:52,631 --> 01:19:55,490
to impose those norms on eachother.

1203
01:19:57,126 --> 01:20:01,150
Their grand strategy for global dominance is already being implemented.

1204
01:20:01,699 --> 01:20:04,130
They're carving up the world into superstates,

1205
01:20:04,155 --> 01:20:06,293
that transcend national boundaries,

1206
01:20:06,318 --> 01:20:08,582
so that we are easier for them to manage.

1207
01:20:09,178 --> 01:20:13,294
They have already established the European Union and the African Union.

1208
01:20:14,326 --> 01:20:17,825
Politicians from the U.S., Canada and Mexico,

1209
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:21,451
under the title of the Security and Prosperity Partnership,

1210
01:20:21,538 --> 01:20:23,390
have been working on the northern part,

1211
01:20:23,415 --> 01:20:27,303
of what could arguably be called plans for an American Union.

1212
01:20:27,862 --> 01:20:29,837
This has been going on for years,

1213
01:20:29,862 --> 01:20:32,774
without citizen or congressional consent.

1214
01:20:33,143 --> 01:20:35,763
A Pacific Union is already in process.

1215
01:20:39,732 --> 01:20:43,138
This is the organizational chart for global tyranny,

1216
01:20:43,583 --> 01:20:45,953
the structure for complete control.

1217
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:50,557
Here are two of the most powerful men in Europe,

1218
01:20:50,582 --> 01:20:53,520
talking about moving to a single world government.

1219
01:20:53,624 --> 01:20:55,936
<i>It is extremely important ...</i>

1220
01:20:57,016 --> 01:21:02,401
<i>that we, in this new ownership of global governments,</i>

1221
01:21:02,426 --> 01:21:05,236
<i>had particulary on both sides of the Atlantic,</i>

1222
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:08,902
<i>the implementation of the same rules, in the same fashion.</i>

1223
01:21:09,173 --> 01:21:13,009
<i>2009 is also the first year of global governance,</i>

1224
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:16,977
<i>with the establishment of G20 in the middle of the financial crisis.</i>

1225
01:21:17,176 --> 01:21:18,953
On the international level,

1226
01:21:18,978 --> 01:21:22,390
the central banking elite have put up huge organizations in place,

1227
01:21:22,415 --> 01:21:24,191
to implement their policies,

1228
01:21:24,216 --> 01:21:26,692
including the World Trade Organization,

1229
01:21:26,936 --> 01:21:28,766
the World Health Organization,

1230
01:21:28,791 --> 01:21:32,023
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

1231
01:21:33,429 --> 01:21:37,532
John Perkins is a man who knows from decades of his own experience,

1232
01:21:37,557 --> 01:21:40,107
as a so-called "economic hitman",

1233
01:21:40,234 --> 01:21:43,897
how the collusion of banks, corporations and governments

1234
01:21:44,151 --> 01:21:46,739
has taken over countries around the world.

1235
01:21:47,237 --> 01:21:50,391
We used many techniques, but propably the most common

1236
01:21:50,574 --> 01:21:55,764
is that we go to a country that has resources that are corporations covered,

1237
01:21:55,789 --> 01:21:56,796
like oil

1238
01:21:56,884 --> 01:21:59,741
and will arrange a huge loan to that country,

1239
01:21:59,765 --> 01:22:02,936
from a organization like the World Bank or one of his sisters.

1240
01:22:02,961 --> 01:22:06,484
But almost all of the money goes to U.S. corporations,

1241
01:22:06,509 --> 01:22:08,084
not to the country itself,

1242
01:22:08,109 --> 01:22:10,616
corporations like Bechtel and Halliburton,

1243
01:22:10,822 --> 01:22:13,864
General Motors, General Electric
- These type of organizations.

1244
01:22:13,889 --> 01:22:16,849
And they build huge infrastructure projects in that country:

1245
01:22:16,874 --> 01:22:20,167
power plants, highways, ports, industrial parks,

1246
01:22:20,192 --> 01:22:23,883
things that serve the very rich and seldom even reach the poor.

1247
01:22:23,908 --> 01:22:27,572
In fact the poor suffer, because the loans have to be repaid

1248
01:22:27,604 --> 01:22:31,619
and they're huge loans and the repayment on the names of the poor will not get education,

1249
01:22:31,643 --> 01:22:33,825
health and other social services

1250
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:37,651
and the country is left holding a huge debt by intention.

1251
01:22:37,858 --> 01:22:40,863
We go back to the economic hitmen of this country

1252
01:22:40,888 --> 01:22:42,088
and say:

1253
01:22:42,113 --> 01:22:45,797
"Look, you owe us a lot of money, you can't repay your debts,

1254
01:22:45,822 --> 01:22:48,538
so give us a pound of flesh. "

1255
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:51,579
As soon as one of those anti-american presidents is elected,

1256
01:22:51,604 --> 01:22:55,704
one of us goes in and says: "Hey, congratulations Mr. president!

1257
01:22:56,188 --> 01:23:00,191
Now that you're president, I just want to tell you that I can make you very very rich

1258
01:23:00,216 --> 01:23:04,396
- You and your family - it's several hundred million dollars in this pocket,

1259
01:23:04,535 --> 01:23:06,872
if you play the game our way.

1260
01:23:06,897 --> 01:23:11,613
If you decide not to, in this pocket I have a gun with a bullet with your name on it,

1261
01:23:11,685 --> 01:23:15,651
in case you decide to keep your campaign promises and throw us out.

1262
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:18,310
Sell our oil companies, your oil, real cheap

1263
01:23:18,335 --> 01:23:20,817
or vote with us at the next UN vote

1264
01:23:20,842 --> 01:23:24,654
or send troops and support of ours to some place in the world, such as Iraq. "

1265
01:23:24,782 --> 01:23:27,950
And in that way we managed to build a world empire,

1266
01:23:27,975 --> 01:23:30,980
with very few people actually knowing, that we've done this.

1267
01:23:31,005 --> 01:23:36,290
Like many people, I thought a conspiracy for global domination could not really work,

1268
01:23:36,315 --> 01:23:39,571
because basicly people are just not that competent.

1269
01:23:39,769 --> 01:23:42,696
I thought there'se no way, they could pull out such a scheme

1270
01:23:42,721 --> 01:23:45,733
at the necessary level of control and secrecy.

1271
01:23:45,758 --> 01:23:49,750
One false hopes is, this is all happening because government is incompetent

1272
01:23:49,775 --> 01:23:52,695
and it's a giant mistake and people really don't know.

1273
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:56,854
And of course that's great air cover for the fact that this really does know, where it's going

1274
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:00,741
and it's going where it wants to go and it's being successful at it.

1275
01:24:01,456 --> 01:24:06,215
- Still I wondered how could something that is so big and corrupt be kept secret?

1276
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:11,095
- It's a simple structure and if it wasn't simple, it wouldn't work

1277
01:24:11,897 --> 01:24:15,280
And it can be likened to a compartmentalized pyramid.

1278
01:24:15,691 --> 01:24:17,801
If you look at any organization today,

1279
01:24:17,826 --> 01:24:22,680
Whether it is a transnational corporation, university, government, secret society,

1280
01:24:22,966 --> 01:24:24,888
they're all structures of pyramid.

1281
01:24:25,151 --> 01:24:29,317
And as the CIA and other intelligence agencies talk about.

1282
01:24:29,436 --> 01:24:32,677
They have this "need to know" system

1283
01:24:33,256 --> 01:24:37,108
Only let people know as much they need to make their contribution and no more.

1284
01:24:37,347 --> 01:24:42,071
So, you take a bank, an individual bank, not that there is such a thing.

1285
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:47,098
At the bottom you got the people you see when you pass a check over the counter in the bank.

1286
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:52,375
They don't know what the bank manager behind them knows and is discussing.

1287
01:24:52,471 --> 01:24:54,825
They only know, what they need to know, to do their job.

1288
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:56,758
The bank manager in the office behind them,

1289
01:24:56,759 --> 01:24:59,159
he or she doesn't know, what's happening at the next level

1290
01:24:59,283 --> 01:25:01,613
and they don't know what's happening at the next level

1291
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:06,860
and, eventually, you got a tiny few people at the peak of the pyramid of that banking structure,

1292
01:25:07,795 --> 01:25:10,969
are the only ones, that know, what the real agenda of the bank is

1293
01:25:10,994 --> 01:25:14,506
and what the direction is that they are going and why.

1294
01:25:15,031 --> 01:25:17,081
This kind of compartmentalisation

1295
01:25:17,106 --> 01:25:19,277
explains how the Manhattan Project,

1296
01:25:19,302 --> 01:25:22,008
which developed the atom bomb in WW II

1297
01:25:22,112 --> 01:25:26,339
was kept secret, despite having 130,000 people working on it.

1298
01:25:28,835 --> 01:25:32,559
When I first found out the scale and intentions of the agenda,

1299
01:25:32,584 --> 01:25:35,185
I felt like a had a flu for about two weeks.

1300
01:25:35,837 --> 01:25:37,900
But then it dawned on me!

1301
01:25:37,925 --> 01:25:41,384
Here is this well planned, well orchestrated attempt,

1302
01:25:41,409 --> 01:25:43,626
to squelch human potential

1303
01:25:43,651 --> 01:25:46,560
and still, our brilliance shines through.

1304
01:25:47,132 --> 01:25:50,648
Even though we've been systematically distracted and repressed

1305
01:25:50,673 --> 01:25:54,308
people have come up with innovative, ingenious solutions

1306
01:25:54,333 --> 01:25:57,491
to a huge number of problems, that we face.

1307
01:25:57,722 --> 01:26:00,076
It's not our fault, that we didn't recognized,

1308
01:26:00,101 --> 01:26:02,991
how organized and intentional this scheme is.

1309
01:26:03,016 --> 01:26:05,186
It's our challenge!

1310
01:26:08,909 --> 01:26:13,050
I looked at the kind of world, the controling elite have already given us

1311
01:26:13,075 --> 01:26:16,747
and I had to ask: "What kind of world would we be living in

1312
01:26:16,772 --> 01:26:21,843
if they had absolute and complete domination over everyone, everywhere? ".

1313
01:26:23,298 --> 01:26:25,515
In this new world order of theirs

1314
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:28,847
a tiny number of people would exercise total control,

1315
01:26:28,926 --> 01:26:30,876
over the lives of everyone,

1316
01:26:30,901 --> 01:26:33,434
through a system on intrusive surveillance,

1317
01:26:33,593 --> 01:26:36,920
violent suppression of dissent and dept slavery.

1318
01:26:37,476 --> 01:26:42,338
Imagine tiny islands of opulence surrounded by a sea of misery,

1319
01:26:42,624 --> 01:26:46,134
where the mission of the military is to protect the have's,

1320
01:26:47,023 --> 01:26:48,955
from the have not's.

1321
01:26:51,099 --> 01:26:54,585
I've come to believe that their endgame is truly ominous

1322
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:58,808
and that they will stop at nothing, to continue implementing their plan.

1323
01:26:59,562 --> 01:27:03,089
As difficult as it may be for Americans to accept,

1324
01:27:03,114 --> 01:27:05,998
I'm now convinced, the agenda of the global elite

1325
01:27:06,141 --> 01:27:11,262
includes destroying the financial strength and sovereignty of the U.S.

1326
01:27:12,182 --> 01:27:15,556
With its history of free speech and armed revolt,

1327
01:27:15,581 --> 01:27:20,047
America represents the major hurdle to global consolidation of power.

1328
01:27:20,357 --> 01:27:23,426
If they can suceed in bringing down this country,

1329
01:27:23,451 --> 01:27:28,620
I believe the international elite intend to transfer the power and productivity of Americans

1330
01:27:28,740 --> 01:27:30,770
to their one world dictatorship,

1331
01:27:30,993 --> 01:27:33,476
gradually taking over our lives,

1332
01:27:33,501 --> 01:27:37,156
by what David Icke calls "the totalitarian tiptoe".

1333
01:27:37,872 --> 01:27:38,943
Think about it!

1334
01:27:38,968 --> 01:27:42,294
They got us so deep in debt, we can never repay it,

1335
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:43,982
they're collapsing the dollar

1336
01:27:44,007 --> 01:27:47,572
and they're intending to replace it with a global IMF currency.

1337
01:27:48,041 --> 01:27:51,727
This press for a global cashless electronic currency

1338
01:27:51,752 --> 01:27:56,842
would enable a central authority to financially disable any individual or group

1339
01:27:56,867 --> 01:27:58,428
in an instant.

1340
01:27:58,651 --> 01:28:01,000
Now, for the first time in history,

1341
01:28:01,025 --> 01:28:03,278
international taxes are being proposed

1342
01:28:03,303 --> 01:28:06,222
under the pretence of adressing climate change.

1343
01:28:08,056 --> 01:28:09,858
Like a Trojan horse

1344
01:28:09,883 --> 01:28:14,899
the suggested treaty unvealed, that the 2008 Copenhagen Climate Conference,

1345
01:28:14,939 --> 01:28:17,564
appeal to our concern for the environment,

1346
01:28:17,589 --> 01:28:21,726
while distracting us from the fact, that this unprecedented carbon tax

1347
01:28:21,751 --> 01:28:26,142
would be paid to the World Bank and enforced by global police.

1348
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,591
There are ways to adress our obvious need to curtail pollution

1349
01:28:30,616 --> 01:28:33,712
without creating a tax base for tyranny.

1350
01:28:34,015 --> 01:28:36,443
You want to change society in a way that,

1351
01:28:36,468 --> 01:28:41,139
you know, that if you do it openly, you know, you're gona get adverse reaction

1352
01:28:41,164 --> 01:28:44,381
So you don't do it openly, you play problem-reaction-solution.

1353
01:28:44,406 --> 01:28:45,672
Stage 1:

1354
01:28:45,697 --> 01:28:47,285
you create a problem.

1355
01:28:47,310 --> 01:28:51,486
It could be a terrorist bomb, it could be a 9/11, it could be a run on a currency

1356
01:28:51,511 --> 01:28:54,725
it could be a stock market collapse, a government collapse.

1357
01:28:55,424 --> 01:29:00,043
You tell the people your version of:

1358
01:29:00,068 --> 01:29:02,181
a) Who did it!

1359
01:29:02,206 --> 01:29:04,019
and b) Why?

1360
01:29:05,290 --> 01:29:07,249
And at this point,

1361
01:29:07,274 --> 01:29:09,719
problem-reaction-solution would fall down,

1362
01:29:09,791 --> 01:29:13,966
if we had a media, that was in any way related to journalism.

1363
01:29:17,284 --> 01:29:21,664
Instead, the mainstream media is a public relations office,

1364
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:23,600
for the official version of events.

1365
01:29:23,625 --> 01:29:25,460
<i>Turnes out president George W. Bush was right,</i>

1366
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:28,736
<i>about Saddam Hussein hiding weapons of mass destruction.</i>

1367
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:35,165
The virtually only way or source of information the public have about the event,

1368
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:36,911
is from the mainstream media.

1369
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:40,142
And they're looking at stage 2 of problem-reaction solution

1370
01:29:40,167 --> 01:29:45,342
is the reaction of outrage of key, key, key fear

1371
01:29:45,676 --> 01:29:48,476
and they want the public to say to the government:

1372
01:29:48,786 --> 01:29:52,468
"Something must be done ... this can't go on ... what are you going do about it?".

1373
01:29:52,493 --> 01:29:54,544
And this allows stage three,

1374
01:29:54,569 --> 01:29:56,846
which is those who created the problem,

1375
01:29:56,871 --> 01:30:00,051
clean that public reaction with a false story

1376
01:30:00,109 --> 01:30:04,618
to then openly offer the solution to the problems they have themselves created.

1377
01:30:05,269 --> 01:30:07,819
The idea of using tragedy

1378
01:30:07,844 --> 01:30:10,346
- manufactured or simply utilised -

1379
01:30:10,521 --> 01:30:13,432
was deeply significant in my finally understanding,

1380
01:30:13,457 --> 01:30:16,949
how far these people will go to achieve their goals.

1381
01:30:16,974 --> 01:30:21,914
It's a documented fact, that we entered the Vietnam war under false pretenses.

1382
01:30:22,152 --> 01:30:24,761
Former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara

1383
01:30:24,786 --> 01:30:30,083
has acknowledged, that the attack on a ships in the Gulf Tonkin didn't actually take place.

1384
01:30:30,797 --> 01:30:34,432
<i>Our judgement, that we have been attacked on that day, was wrong.</i>

1385
01:30:34,567 --> 01:30:36,245
<i>It did matter!</i>

1386
01:30:43,052 --> 01:30:45,421
More recently, former President Bush

1387
01:30:45,446 --> 01:30:48,205
used nonexistent weapons of mass destruction,

1388
01:30:48,293 --> 01:30:50,854
as a pretext for invading Iraq.

1389
01:30:52,338 --> 01:30:57,033
Tactics like this are sometimes referred to as "false flag" operations.

1390
01:30:57,232 --> 01:31:02,200
An increasingly more people believe that 9/11 was a "false flag" operation

1391
01:31:02,225 --> 01:31:03,561
by the global elite,

1392
01:31:03,586 --> 01:31:06,763
in order to set the stage for taking over Middle East oil

1393
01:31:06,788 --> 01:31:10,032
and dismantling U.S. constitutional protection.

1394
01:31:35,752 --> 01:31:40,140
Most of what's needed for a police state is actually already in place.

1395
01:31:41,011 --> 01:31:42,694
Right now in America

1396
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:46,060
any of us can be imprisoned without a warning or due cause

1397
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:50,422
and we can be kidnapped, tortured and assassinated legally

1398
01:31:50,447 --> 01:31:54,230
if the government decides, what we're doing is a threat to their plan.

1399
01:31:54,413 --> 01:31:57,295
All they have to do, is name us as a suspect

1400
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:59,659
in their so-called war on terror.

1401
01:32:00,430 --> 01:32:02,580
We're being watched more and more.

1402
01:32:02,902 --> 01:32:08,012
In 2010 there were 30 million surveillance cameras recording us in the U.S. alone.

1403
01:32:09,058 --> 01:32:14,403
When we demonstrate, we're now relegated to what's euphemistically called "free speech zones".

1404
01:32:14,428 --> 01:32:16,739
Zones for free speech?

1405
01:32:18,041 --> 01:32:20,311
Every phone call and e-mail we send

1406
01:32:20,336 --> 01:32:24,015
is collected and archived and can be inspected at any time.

1407
01:32:25,171 --> 01:32:29,893
our Drivers licenses and passports have computer chips implanted in them,

1408
01:32:29,918 --> 01:32:31,948
to track our every move.

1409
01:32:31,973 --> 01:32:34,838
And now, hospital patients are getting these same chips

1410
01:32:34,863 --> 01:32:36,917
implanted under their skin.

1411
01:32:37,169 --> 01:32:40,971
In fact, it was Procter & Gamble who developed these chips,

1412
01:32:40,996 --> 01:32:43,498
initially for tracking their products.

1413
01:32:44,292 --> 01:32:46,807
It's always offerd as a way to help,

1414
01:32:46,871 --> 01:32:50,010
But even an Assistant Director of CIA

1415
01:32:50,035 --> 01:32:53,516
has admitted it's an entry point to getting all of us chipped,

1416
01:32:53,541 --> 01:32:56,006
for better tracking and control.

1417
01:32:58,855 --> 01:33:00,717
These would be controllers

1418
01:33:00,741 --> 01:33:03,767
through the U.S. Space Command have outlined a plan

1419
01:33:03,792 --> 01:33:06,057
called "full spectrum dominance."

1420
01:33:06,327 --> 01:33:08,519
Sophisticated satellite surveillance

1421
01:33:08,544 --> 01:33:12,612
as well as directed energy and laser weapons, which are already developed,

1422
01:33:13,232 --> 01:33:16,593
have the ability to target dissenters anywhere on Earth.

1423
01:33:18,609 --> 01:33:23,707
I believe they are also trying to insure they can deal effectively with any resistance.

1424
01:33:24,224 --> 01:33:26,262
FEMA containment camps

1425
01:33:26,287 --> 01:33:28,503
and railroad cars with shackles

1426
01:33:28,528 --> 01:33:32,567
have been recently constructed or refurbished all over the U.S.,

1427
01:33:32,655 --> 01:33:34,686
for use in what officials call:

1428
01:33:34,708 --> 01:33:37,687
"Times of pandemic or civil unrest."

1429
01:33:39,129 --> 01:33:42,851
<i>"Social experiment in China under Chairman Mao's leadership,</i>

1430
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:46,675
<i>is one of the most important and successful in human history. "</i>

1431
01:33:46,676 --> 01:33:47,676
David Rockefeller, 1973

1432
01:33:50,992 --> 01:33:55,845
<i>That "social experiment" killed more than 70 million Chinese people during "peacetime".</i>

1433
01:33:55,870 --> 01:33:59,574
There's one more brutal realisation about the global domination agenda,

1434
01:33:59,599 --> 01:34:01,426
that I need to share.

1435
01:34:01,487 --> 01:34:04,103
This was a horrible one for me to grasp,

1436
01:34:04,128 --> 01:34:07,878
but, without it, this investigation would be dangerously incomplete

1437
01:34:08,212 --> 01:34:12,064
and our solutions strategies would be inadequately enformed.

1438
01:34:13,137 --> 01:34:15,950
In my research I came across convincing evidence,

1439
01:34:15,975 --> 01:34:21,413
that their plan actually includes the elimination of the majority of the worlds population.

1440
01:34:22,187 --> 01:34:24,250
As sick as it sounds, it makes sense,

1441
01:34:24,275 --> 01:34:26,543
that they would be better positioned to succeed,

1442
01:34:26,568 --> 01:34:28,746
in their quest for absolute control,

1443
01:34:28,771 --> 01:34:31,775
if there are fewer of us to manage.

1444
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:34,513
Every time I thought, "They wouldn't do that"

1445
01:34:34,736 --> 01:34:36,678
I discovered I was wrong.

1446
01:34:37,727 --> 01:34:39,601
I found startling documentation,

1447
01:34:39,626 --> 01:34:42,895
that eugenics is one of the core pillars of their plan.

1448
01:34:43,412 --> 01:34:47,537
Eugenics is the practice were some people get to decide, who's worthy to breed

1449
01:34:47,538 --> 01:34:49,638
and who's not

1450
01:34:49,703 --> 01:34:52,546
Sterilization is one of the many insidious ways,

1451
01:34:52,571 --> 01:34:55,125
this covert plan is being implemented.

1452
01:34:58,332 --> 01:35:02,377
In 1904, the Carnegies funded the first eugenics laboratory

1453
01:35:02,402 --> 01:35:04,626
in Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island.

1454
01:35:05,317 --> 01:35:10,221
The Rockefellers funded involuntary sterilization of people of color,

1455
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:12,516
through their eugenics programs

1456
01:35:12,541 --> 01:35:15,609
and funded the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany,

1457
01:35:15,634 --> 01:35:18,205
to further the racial supremacy agenda,

1458
01:35:18,230 --> 01:35:20,227
later adopted by Hitler.

1459
01:35:21,346 --> 01:35:25,837
In 2007, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Homeland Security

1460
01:35:26,068 --> 01:35:28,059
funded a proposed project -

1461
01:35:28,084 --> 01:35:30,429
the aerial spray over 7 million people,

1462
01:35:30,454 --> 01:35:32,898
in urban areas of northern California.

1463
01:35:33,771 --> 01:35:36,430
After citizens organized against the plan,

1464
01:35:36,455 --> 01:35:40,411
officials were forced to reveal, that the spray included multiple toxins,

1465
01:35:40,436 --> 01:35:44,347
that can cause disease and disrupt the reproductive cycle.

1466
01:35:44,745 --> 01:35:48,169
Fortunately, civil resistance stopped the project.

1467
01:35:49,915 --> 01:35:52,720
The U.S. government has been caught over 30 times,

1468
01:35:52,745 --> 01:35:56,661
covertly experimenting with toxic chemicals on its own citizens.

1469
01:35:56,686 --> 01:36:00,462
From soldiers, prisoners and the Native American reservations,

1470
01:36:00,487 --> 01:36:02,760
to entire towns and counties.

1471
01:36:04,047 --> 01:36:07,300
Mass covert sterilization of women and girls,

1472
01:36:07,325 --> 01:36:10,317
usually using secret additives to vaccines,

1473
01:36:10,405 --> 01:36:12,504
has been exposed in Brazil

1474
01:36:12,671 --> 01:36:13,963
Puerto Rico,

1475
01:36:13,988 --> 01:36:15,188
Nicaragua,

1476
01:36:15,213 --> 01:36:17,113
Mexico and the Philippines.

1477
01:36:18,201 --> 01:36:21,662
Thise have been under the auspices of such programs as:

1478
01:36:21,846 --> 01:36:24,550
John D. Rockefeller's Population Council,

1479
01:36:24,575 --> 01:36:28,105
The U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare

1480
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:30,924
when Nelson Rockefeller was under secretary,

1481
01:36:30,949 --> 01:36:34,098
and the Rockefeller founded World Health Organization.

1482
01:36:35,062 --> 01:36:37,001
Novartis and Syngenta,

1483
01:36:37,026 --> 01:36:39,836
in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture

1484
01:36:39,861 --> 01:36:41,513
and the Department of Defense,

1485
01:36:41,538 --> 01:36:45,131
have field tested a spermicidal strain of GMO corn,

1486
01:36:45,156 --> 01:36:48,045
that would render male consumers infertile.

1487
01:36:48,347 --> 01:36:50,466
This was quietly announced as a

1488
01:36:50,491 --> 01:36:53,776
"... contribution to the world overpopulation problem."

1489
01:36:54,459 --> 01:36:56,752
The list goes on and on.

1490
01:36:57,228 --> 01:37:00,497
Right now, global human fertility is plunging.

1491
01:37:00,966 --> 01:37:03,567
I'm convinced that this is no accident.

1492
01:37:03,893 --> 01:37:05,076
For me,

1493
01:37:05,101 --> 01:37:09,228
being willing to consider and research a direct depopulation agenda,

1494
01:37:09,253 --> 01:37:11,763
was critical to my getting a whole picture

1495
01:37:12,017 --> 01:37:16,405
and to generating responses, that could be sufficient to the task we face.

1496
01:37:16,935 --> 01:37:18,985
I know this might sound crazy,

1497
01:37:19,010 --> 01:37:22,615
but imagine that it's 1932 and we're in Germany.

1498
01:37:22,735 --> 01:37:27,088
If I told you, that in the next decade, millions of people would be exterminated,

1499
01:37:27,271 --> 01:37:30,578
you would say "impossible, no one would do such a thing".

1500
01:37:39,104 --> 01:37:42,322
This is what depopulation looks like today.

1501
01:37:45,188 --> 01:37:48,021
I'm convinced that I'm not overstating the case.

1502
01:37:48,395 --> 01:37:50,068
Could I be wrong?

1503
01:37:50,187 --> 01:37:51,387
Perhaps.

1504
01:37:51,674 --> 01:37:53,511
But what if I'm not?

1505
01:37:57,297 --> 01:38:01,214
We are at a critical fork in the road of human evolution.

1506
01:38:01,818 --> 01:38:06,077
One road is leading toward tyranny and possible self destruction.

1507
01:38:06,903 --> 01:38:10,472
The other would lead us to a peaceful, healthy civilization,

1508
01:38:10,599 --> 01:38:13,043
based on honouring the rights and freedom

1509
01:38:13,091 --> 01:38:15,481
of every single person on the planet.

1510
01:38:23,730 --> 01:38:26,000
To set off in this new direction,

1511
01:38:26,025 --> 01:38:28,883
it's up to you and me to clear that road.

1512
01:38:28,908 --> 01:38:31,668
The time has come to say: "Enough."

1513
01:38:31,693 --> 01:38:33,591
"There is another way!"

1514
01:38:33,806 --> 01:38:39,179
I belive, that together we have the knowledge, the resources and the solutions,

1515
01:38:39,214 --> 01:38:41,352
to meet that challenge.

1516
01:38:44,944 --> 01:38:49,757
<b>Creating Solutions</b>

1517
01:38:51,970 --> 01:38:56,422
I see this process as nothing less, than a struggle for the soul of humanity.

1518
01:38:57,344 --> 01:38:59,836
It begins with a shift in worldview,

1519
01:38:59,861 --> 01:39:02,899
answering the question: "Who are we really?".

1520
01:39:03,289 --> 01:39:05,249
What is human nature?

1521
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,739
Are we humans what the elite would have us believe,

1522
01:39:08,764 --> 01:39:10,735
stupid greedy creatures,

1523
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:14,708
who, if left of our own devices, would evolve into violence and chaos?

1524
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:18,903
And so, for our own good, must be ruled over by a self appointed elite?

1525
01:39:19,554 --> 01:39:23,010
Or are we naturally caring and creative?

1526
01:39:29,944 --> 01:39:34,249
I belive, when people are healthy and have what we need to survive,

1527
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:38,530
we can create a world based on integrity, ...

1528
01:39:39,816 --> 01:39:41,174
freedom,

1529
01:39:41,649 --> 01:39:43,334
and compassion,

1530
01:39:44,047 --> 01:39:46,818
a world where everyone can thrive.

1531
01:39:47,802 --> 01:39:51,332
Which of these two views will shape our future?

1532
01:39:51,533 --> 01:39:53,910
That's our choice, now!

1533
01:39:57,236 --> 01:40:02,110
The agenda of the ruling elite is the product of a destructive worldview,

1534
01:40:02,317 --> 01:40:05,557
based on their beliefs, that there's not enough to go around,

1535
01:40:05,677 --> 01:40:08,224
that some people are more deserving than others

1536
01:40:08,367 --> 01:40:13,037
and that their safety depends on maintaining absolute control over the rest of us.

1537
01:40:13,307 --> 01:40:17,118
In short, their worldview is based on scarcity and fear.

1538
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:19,651
But as powerful as they are,

1539
01:40:19,676 --> 01:40:23,683
the architects of the new world order can not create their threatful vision,

1540
01:40:23,708 --> 01:40:25,390
without our collusion.

1541
01:40:25,488 --> 01:40:29,071
To stop them, to render their agenda obsolete,

1542
01:40:29,350 --> 01:40:32,579
We have to wake up, we have to take action.

1543
01:40:33,136 --> 01:40:36,405
It is like the last effort,

1544
01:40:36,541 --> 01:40:39,453
of a particular fase of civilization,

1545
01:40:39,478 --> 01:40:40,995
it's its last gasp really.

1546
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:45,984
And now we often use the metaphor of the caterpillar becoming the butterfly.

1547
01:40:46,009 --> 01:40:49,526
Because the caterpillar crunches its way through the ecosystem,

1548
01:40:49,551 --> 01:40:53,379
it's very destructive, it eats 300 times of its weight in a day

1549
01:40:53,404 --> 01:40:56,906
until it's so bloated that it hangs itself up and goes asleep

1550
01:40:56,931 --> 01:41:00,114
and its skin turns into a hardened chrysalis.

1551
01:41:00,218 --> 01:41:03,392
Then in its body you get these imaginal cells

1552
01:41:03,417 --> 01:41:05,655
- Biologists actually call them that -

1553
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:07,872
forming within the caterpillars body.

1554
01:41:07,897 --> 01:41:13,236
The caterpillar's body then actually becomes a nutritive soup for those cells.

1555
01:41:13,261 --> 01:41:15,737
But what's important about that metaphor

1556
01:41:15,762 --> 01:41:19,897
is that the old and the new coexist for a while.

1557
01:41:20,041 --> 01:41:23,849
And it's the job of the caterpillar to preserve its life

1558
01:41:23,905 --> 01:41:26,631
It's a desperate government, that we have now

1559
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:28,754
trying to control oil in the Middle-East

1560
01:41:28,779 --> 01:41:32,175
and one in now to promote nuclear energy and all these things,

1561
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:33,600
they know better,

1562
01:41:33,625 --> 01:41:37,860
but they have to play out the role of predicting themselves - it's their job.

1563
01:41:38,067 --> 01:41:41,937
And if you love butterflies, you don't go around steping on caterpillars.

1564
01:41:42,033 --> 01:41:45,064
So we can't hate them, it doesn't do any good.

1565
01:41:45,079 --> 01:41:46,917
But if you want alternative energy,

1566
01:41:46,942 --> 01:41:52,516
you don't ask an oil economy administration to produce it for you.

1567
01:41:52,541 --> 01:41:55,014
We have to produce it, we imagine our cells

1568
01:41:55,039 --> 01:41:59,058
have to show, that it's cheaper, more efficient and more effective.

1569
01:41:59,217 --> 01:42:01,809
Our job is to build the new world.

1570
01:42:01,813 --> 01:42:04,116
If we had the vision and a worldview

1571
01:42:04,141 --> 01:42:07,812
that says "our crisis is a birth" and everybody is needed,

1572
01:42:07,892 --> 01:42:11,120
and everybody will have more of what they really want,

1573
01:42:11,145 --> 01:42:14,011
You could turn this desperate world into

1574
01:42:14,036 --> 01:42:17,999
a renaissance of human creativity and love.

1575
01:42:20,095 --> 01:42:23,687
It may seem that the controlling elite has all the cards,

1576
01:42:23,799 --> 01:42:26,250
but we have many advantages of our own.

1577
01:42:26,813 --> 01:42:29,035
First lets talk numbers

1578
01:42:29,107 --> 01:42:33,473
Very few people consciously perpetrating the domination agenda.

1579
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:36,290
Most of those helping to implement the plan

1580
01:42:36,315 --> 01:42:39,251
don't understand the whole picture, of what they're part of.

1581
01:42:39,792 --> 01:42:44,331
By my calculations, we outnumber the actual architects of the plan,

1582
01:42:44,356 --> 01:42:47,823
by more than a million to 1, in the U.S. alone.

1583
01:42:49,205 --> 01:42:52,021
Entrepreneur and environmentalist Paul Hawken,

1584
01:42:52,046 --> 01:42:56,640
estimates that there are now well over one million organizations in the world,

1585
01:42:56,791 --> 01:43:00,055
that work toward social and environmental justice

1586
01:43:00,365 --> 01:43:04,700
comprising the largest social movement in the history of humankind.

1587
01:43:06,288 --> 01:43:09,066
This movement, when connected electronically

1588
01:43:09,091 --> 01:43:10,917
could become the network of networks,

1589
01:43:10,942 --> 01:43:15,339
that will be the most powerful activist force for change, ever.

1590
01:43:16,268 --> 01:43:22,498
If you look at the people, who are involved with restoring this Earth

1591
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:24,705
and stopping the damage

1592
01:43:24,730 --> 01:43:26,780
and resisting the depredation

1593
01:43:26,805 --> 01:43:29,278
and nurturing change,

1594
01:43:29,303 --> 01:43:32,453
in reimagining, what it means to be a human being

1595
01:43:32,683 --> 01:43:36,749
and if you're not optimistic, then you might want to get your heart checked, you know

1596
01:43:36,765 --> 01:43:45,355
because there is an extraordinary, beautiful, gorgeus, fierce group of people in this world,

1597
01:43:46,062 --> 01:43:48,450
who are taking this on.

1598
01:43:49,816 --> 01:43:52,355
The second important advantage for us

1599
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:55,556
is that all the power centers, that the elite controls

1600
01:43:55,581 --> 01:43:57,807
require our participation.

1601
01:43:58,212 --> 01:44:00,808
If enough of us have withdraw our support,

1602
01:44:00,833 --> 01:44:02,721
their plan can't work.

1603
01:44:02,746 --> 01:44:04,626
This is true of the central banks,

1604
01:44:04,651 --> 01:44:05,851
the military,

1605
01:44:06,097 --> 01:44:07,660
the corporate media,

1606
01:44:07,685 --> 01:44:09,465
the government and more.

1607
01:44:10,021 --> 01:44:14,455
And following the models of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.

1608
01:44:14,566 --> 01:44:18,203
we have the power of nonviolent nonparticipation.

1609
01:44:19,211 --> 01:44:23,059
It takes tremendous energy, resources and deception,

1610
01:44:23,084 --> 01:44:25,503
to try to dominate the lives of others.

1611
01:44:25,924 --> 01:44:28,314
In moving toward freedom, on the other hand,

1612
01:44:28,339 --> 01:44:31,309
we have on our side the evolutionary life force

1613
01:44:31,412 --> 01:44:34,189
and what Gandhi called "Satyagraha"

1614
01:44:35,126 --> 01:44:37,678
the simple power of truth.

1615
01:44:39,695 --> 01:44:44,880
In India we have thousands of villages, which are now freedom zones.

1616
01:44:45,547 --> 01:44:47,747
So we will not accept patenty,

1617
01:44:47,866 --> 01:44:49,570
we will not cooperate with it,

1618
01:44:49,595 --> 01:44:52,230
just like Gandhi did not cooperate with authorities.

1619
01:44:52,255 --> 01:44:56,466
We will not allow chemicals and genetically engineered crops

1620
01:44:56,491 --> 01:44:58,244
to enter our ecosystems,

1621
01:44:58,269 --> 01:45:00,430
because they threaten biodiversity.

1622
01:45:00,962 --> 01:45:02,996
And this freedom movement,

1623
01:45:03,021 --> 01:45:06,009
which is a freedom movement for all species,

1624
01:45:06,034 --> 01:45:07,982
not just for individual humans,

1625
01:45:08,007 --> 01:45:09,983
is something that's going so fast

1626
01:45:10,008 --> 01:45:13,983
and is reflected in the movement for GMO-free zones in Europe.

1627
01:45:14,032 --> 01:45:15,742
I turn my back

1628
01:45:15,767 --> 01:45:18,400
and there's another thousand GMO-free zones:

1629
01:45:18,464 --> 01:45:21,825
90% of Italy, 90% of Austria.

1630
01:45:21,945 --> 01:45:27,453
The freedom zones, around the seed, around the food,

1631
01:45:28,001 --> 01:45:30,802
are creating massive shifts.

1632
01:45:31,493 --> 01:45:34,721
In Bolivia, a grassroots movement took to the streets,

1633
01:45:34,746 --> 01:45:37,192
relentlessly banging pots and pans

1634
01:45:37,217 --> 01:45:40,039
and eventually stopped the foreign corporate takeover

1635
01:45:40,064 --> 01:45:41,843
of their water resources.

1636
01:45:42,288 --> 01:45:44,887
Although very little is shown in the corporate media,

1637
01:45:44,983 --> 01:45:49,380
there are countless success stories going on every day, all over the world.

1638
01:45:49,405 --> 01:45:52,701
<i>The population of Hawaii approved the resolution against forced vaccination</i>

1639
01:45:52,726 --> 01:45:55,972
<i>A man invented a machine that converts plastic into oil</i>

1640
01:45:55,997 --> 01:45:58,921
<i>Harvard medical students rebel against relationship with Big Pharma</i>

1641
01:45:58,946 --> 01:46:02,238
<i>A small farmer wins a moral battle over Monsanto</i>

1642
01:46:02,263 --> 01:46:05,569
<i>EU foiled in bid to force France and Greece to allow GM crops</i>

1643
01:46:05,594 --> 01:46:09,101
<i>Bayer ordered to pay $ 136.8 million in U.S. rice case</i>

1644
01:46:09,126 --> 01:46:13,983
<i>Going organic: more farmers switching from conventional dairy methods</i>

1645
01:46:14,745 --> 01:46:16,679
I wasn't willing to make this film,

1646
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:21,012
until I knew, there were responses, that are a mach for the crisis.

1647
01:46:21,337 --> 01:46:23,405
And now the power of the Internet

1648
01:46:23,430 --> 01:46:27,486
enables us to share the breadth and the depth of this research.

1649
01:46:27,915 --> 01:46:30,843
We've spent years creating a vast website,

1650
01:46:30,868 --> 01:46:32,653
www.thrivemovement.com,

1651
01:46:32,678 --> 01:46:34,258
that brings it all together

1652
01:46:34,283 --> 01:46:39,022
and makes the information and what we can do about it, acessible to everyone

1653
01:46:39,094 --> 01:46:41,464
Here you have your very own navigator module

1654
01:46:41,489 --> 01:46:44,626
to go deeper in to the main subjects covered in this film:

1655
01:46:44,651 --> 01:46:48,065
code, problem and solution.

1656
01:46:48,296 --> 01:46:50,694
You can study strategies and tactics

1657
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:53,989
and connect with others, to take high level actions.

1658
01:46:54,108 --> 01:46:58,056
Every fact stated in this film has been independently verified

1659
01:46:58,081 --> 01:47:00,420
and the reference is on our website.

1660
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,895
This sector navigator facilitates whole-system-thinking,

1661
01:47:05,942 --> 01:47:10,217
that recognizes, that actions in one area impact all the others.

1662
01:47:11,122 --> 01:47:14,486
The center of the sector navigator is worldview,

1663
01:47:14,511 --> 01:47:17,696
because it determines how we experience everything that happens

1664
01:47:17,721 --> 01:47:19,702
within and around us.

1665
01:47:20,353 --> 01:47:23,220
In every sector you'll find critical issues,

1666
01:47:23,245 --> 01:47:27,123
resources, group strategies and individual actions,

1667
01:47:27,148 --> 01:47:30,679
to peacefully an productively affect real change

1668
01:47:31,426 --> 01:47:35,068
Our resource tree will link you to the people,

1669
01:47:35,426 --> 01:47:36,832
organizations

1670
01:47:36,857 --> 01:47:38,087
and media

1671
01:47:38,127 --> 01:47:42,969
that we most recommend to help you get more fully educated and engaged.

1672
01:47:43,407 --> 01:47:47,343
I was encouraged to find, that there are a minimum number of actions,

1673
01:47:47,368 --> 01:47:51,392
which working together, can tip the scales, if not endless.

1674
01:47:51,829 --> 01:47:53,839
Once we see the big picture,

1675
01:47:53,864 --> 01:47:57,479
we look at what each of us can do, to help accomplish it.

1676
01:47:57,504 --> 01:48:02,121
Let's take a look at the strategic antidotes to their economic domination.

1677
01:48:02,225 --> 01:48:06,555
We need to: stop any more bailouts of banks or corporations,

1678
01:48:07,603 --> 01:48:10,013
dismantle the Federal Reserve,

1679
01:48:10,275 --> 01:48:14,010
withdraw taxpayer support from central banking agencies,

1680
01:48:14,035 --> 01:48:16,216
such as the IMF and World Bank

1681
01:48:16,938 --> 01:48:21,001
allow development of alternative currencies and independent banks

1682
01:48:21,168 --> 01:48:23,613
and refuse international taxes.

1683
01:48:24,344 --> 01:48:29,359
My main emphasis is on solutions in the U.S., because that's what I know best,

1684
01:48:29,394 --> 01:48:32,114
But just as the predicament is global,

1685
01:48:32,139 --> 01:48:35,665
so are the principles on which the solution strategies are based.

1686
01:48:35,690 --> 01:48:39,314
Here is some tactical actions, that we can take as individuals,

1687
01:48:39,339 --> 01:48:43,465
that don't take much time or money, to make a real difference right now.

1688
01:48:43,490 --> 01:48:44,862
What can I do?

1689
01:48:46,926 --> 01:48:50,645
Get informed, speak up and connect with others!

1690
01:48:52,701 --> 01:48:54,479
Bank locally!

1691
01:48:54,504 --> 01:48:57,832
When we move our money out of the big centralised banks,

1692
01:48:57,857 --> 01:49:00,721
and it's in locally owned banks and credit unions,

1693
01:49:00,746 --> 01:49:05,445
we defund the problem and fund the solutions, all in one move.

1694
01:49:07,866 --> 01:49:10,645
Buy and invest responsibly!

1695
01:49:10,866 --> 01:49:13,926
Every dollar you spend sends a message.

1696
01:49:14,926 --> 01:49:18,815
Join the movement to audit and end the Federal Reserve!

1697
01:49:18,991 --> 01:49:20,892
It's robbing us!

1698
01:49:22,353 --> 01:49:26,468
Join the coalition to keep the Internet fair and open!

1699
01:49:26,572 --> 01:49:29,552
Don't let anybody take control over!

1700
01:49:31,473 --> 01:49:33,609
Support independent media!

1701
01:49:33,634 --> 01:49:36,116
Get your information from diverse sources

1702
01:49:36,141 --> 01:49:39,801
and think about, who's funding the news you get!

1703
01:49:41,191 --> 01:49:44,892
Support organic non-GMO farming!

1704
01:49:46,417 --> 01:49:49,588
Join movement to bring about honest elections,

1705
01:49:49,613 --> 01:49:52,329
including traceable paper ballot

1706
01:49:52,366 --> 01:49:54,881
and campaign finance reform.

1707
01:49:54,963 --> 01:49:57,469
Congress can only be accountable to us,

1708
01:49:57,494 --> 01:50:00,501
when corporations stop funding them.

1709
01:50:01,468 --> 01:50:05,431
Advocate for renewable and new energy technology!

1710
01:50:05,456 --> 01:50:09,281
Bring the conversation about free energy out into the open!

1711
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:12,704
It will transform the power dynamic on this planet

1712
01:50:12,729 --> 01:50:15,433
faster than anything in recorded history.

1713
01:50:18,071 --> 01:50:20,563
Sign up for critical mass action!

1714
01:50:20,707 --> 01:50:23,191
It's a strategy to leverage our power

1715
01:50:23,216 --> 01:50:26,838
by waiting until a huge number of us agrees to participate,

1716
01:50:26,863 --> 01:50:29,028
before taking an action.

1717
01:50:29,180 --> 01:50:32,442
Imagine a million of us acting in unison!

1718
01:50:32,467 --> 01:50:35,470
Then again, imagine even more!

1719
01:50:40,903 --> 01:50:44,526
I've been inspired by how many grounded solutions

1720
01:50:44,551 --> 01:50:47,628
and real life problem solvers there actually are.

1721
01:50:48,605 --> 01:50:52,904
Aqeela Sherills is one person whose work has specially touched me.

1722
01:50:53,532 --> 01:50:57,227
He helped broker a gang truce between the Crips and Bloods.

1723
01:50:57,561 --> 01:51:02,072
One of the things that we discovered in the process of waging peace in the neighborhood,

1724
01:51:02,302 --> 01:51:04,591
was that conflict is healthy.

1725
01:51:04,980 --> 01:51:08,537
It's unresolved conflict, that actually leads to violence.

1726
01:51:08,601 --> 01:51:10,778
When we first launched a peace treaty,

1727
01:51:10,803 --> 01:51:13,204
we had a lot of success in the first year.

1728
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:17,252
Gang homicides dropped 44% in the neighborhood based upon our actions.

1729
01:51:17,311 --> 01:51:19,106
Aqeela describes what happened,

1730
01:51:19,131 --> 01:51:23,150
when two rival gang leaders finally met after the truce.

1731
01:51:23,278 --> 01:51:27,016
The brother came and told me, "I know you got some hard feelings for me

1732
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:29,607
maybe I got some hard feelings for you,

1733
01:51:29,632 --> 01:51:31,598
but because of this truce,

1734
01:51:31,639 --> 01:51:34,044
I'm willing to put all of that to aside. "

1735
01:51:34,124 --> 01:51:37,129
And he stuck out his hand

1736
01:51:37,368 --> 01:51:39,465
he hugged him and he said he closed his eyes,

1737
01:51:39,490 --> 01:51:44,795
because he was prearing for a sharp knife to enter his back.

1738
01:51:44,907 --> 01:51:47,153
He was waiting for a bullet,

1739
01:51:47,178 --> 01:51:49,124
to be shot in his stomach.

1740
01:51:49,315 --> 01:51:53,815
But after a few moments

1741
01:51:54,030 --> 01:51:55,876
he realized that ...

1742
01:51:57,012 --> 01:51:58,821
it was genuine.

1743
01:52:01,393 --> 01:52:04,686
I belive that having a clear picture of our potential,

1744
01:52:04,829 --> 01:52:07,921
is as important as uncovering, what stands in its way.

1745
01:52:08,414 --> 01:52:11,940
So I want to take you to a possible world of the future.

1746
01:52:12,416 --> 01:52:16,796
It's a world the elite would have you believe is an impossible pipedream,

1747
01:52:17,146 --> 01:52:20,993
but I'm convinced it's a world that is utterly within our grasp.

1748
01:52:23,453 --> 01:52:26,672
We can create a world where people can thrive

1749
01:52:27,244 --> 01:52:29,454
where we can feel safe and secure.

1750
01:52:30,225 --> 01:52:33,408
The air, water and food are clean.

1751
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:38,122
A world were communities are capable producing their own energy and food

1752
01:52:38,361 --> 01:52:40,577
and trade is open and fair.

1753
01:52:41,411 --> 01:52:43,772
Rather than focusing on punishment,

1754
01:52:43,797 --> 01:52:47,572
instead justice restores lives and losses.

1755
01:52:48,216 --> 01:52:51,763
Insurance pays doctors to keep people healthy.

1756
01:52:52,161 --> 01:52:54,321
Education is voluntary,

1757
01:52:54,346 --> 01:52:57,661
serving the needs of individuals instead of corporations.

1758
01:52:58,153 --> 01:53:01,385
We get honest feedback from independent media.

1759
01:53:02,021 --> 01:53:04,837
There are no subsidies and no bailouts.

1760
01:53:05,425 --> 01:53:09,508
Imagine that with an honest money system, little or no taxes

1761
01:53:09,533 --> 01:53:11,900
and low electric or fuel bills,

1762
01:53:11,925 --> 01:53:15,480
you would have the money to pay off your home and car

1763
01:53:15,703 --> 01:53:18,352
and be free to save and invest.

1764
01:53:18,916 --> 01:53:23,651
You would enjoy more wealth, freedom and security.

1765
01:53:23,898 --> 01:53:27,073
All while working the same or propably less.

1766
01:53:27,470 --> 01:53:30,320
Let's say I started a mutual fund for my neighborhood

1767
01:53:30,345 --> 01:53:33,046
and all the neighbors had stock.

1768
01:53:34,229 --> 01:53:38,382
And, so they heal the environment and their stock went up in value.

1769
01:53:38,399 --> 01:53:41,726
So instead of getting drained financially, they're making money.

1770
01:53:42,243 --> 01:53:45,087
They're making money from things that make their kids safer

1771
01:53:45,112 --> 01:53:47,521
and prevent the planet from dying.

1772
01:53:47,633 --> 01:53:50,230
So you kind of have one's cake and eat it too.

1773
01:53:50,255 --> 01:53:52,668
Instead of working all week to make money

1774
01:53:52,708 --> 01:53:55,521
and then coming home and trying to save the planet on the weekends,

1775
01:53:55,546 --> 01:53:59,242
you can spend Monday to Friday making money saving the planet

1776
01:53:59,267 --> 01:54:01,276
and then go to the beach.

1777
01:54:02,514 --> 01:54:04,721
This vision of a thriving world,

1778
01:54:04,746 --> 01:54:07,744
is based on what could be called the liberty perspective.

1779
01:54:08,195 --> 01:54:11,279
There's a simple principle that underlies this approach:

1780
01:54:11,304 --> 01:54:12,907
of non-violation.

1781
01:54:13,050 --> 01:54:15,926
Nobody gets to violate you or your property

1782
01:54:15,951 --> 01:54:17,994
and you don't get to violate anyone else,

1783
01:54:18,019 --> 01:54:20,455
exept in genuine self defense.

1784
01:54:21,130 --> 01:54:25,272
This is the one rule I found, that every single person agrees with,

1785
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:27,267
at least for themselves.

1786
01:54:28,037 --> 01:54:33,156
I believe that non-violation is the true north of humanity's moral compass

1787
01:54:33,244 --> 01:54:35,684
and our core navigating insight.

1788
01:54:36,288 --> 01:54:39,801
This insight can guide us and protect each and every individual

1789
01:54:39,826 --> 01:54:43,223
as we set up voluntary self-sustaining systems.

1790
01:54:43,723 --> 01:54:48,406
It is a way of living that I can stand for wholeheartedly and without reservation.

1791
01:54:49,423 --> 01:54:54,237
I've been profoundly influenced by the work of Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises,

1792
01:54:54,262 --> 01:54:57,208
who developed a whole philosophy and an economic system,

1793
01:54:57,233 --> 01:54:59,944
based on the core ethic of non-aggression.

1794
01:55:00,708 --> 01:55:05,414
Motivated by having witnessed the ravages of communism and fascism in Europe,

1795
01:55:05,629 --> 01:55:08,567
he commited his life to finding a just way.

1796
01:55:09,084 --> 01:55:11,423
He recognised, that those systems

1797
01:55:11,543 --> 01:55:14,240
as well as socialism and even democracy,

1798
01:55:14,265 --> 01:55:17,805
wrongly assume, the rights of the collective, or the group

1799
01:55:17,980 --> 01:55:20,887
to be more important, than those of the individual.

1800
01:55:21,919 --> 01:55:25,372
I had always gone along with the view, that more people will thrive,

1801
01:55:25,397 --> 01:55:28,460
if we consider the group's needs above the individuals,

1802
01:55:28,515 --> 01:55:30,651
but when I took a closer look,

1803
01:55:30,676 --> 01:55:32,854
I found that doesn't really work that way.

1804
01:55:32,966 --> 01:55:35,437
In the name of what's best for the group,

1805
01:55:35,462 --> 01:55:38,673
governments have been responsible for most of the war,

1806
01:55:38,792 --> 01:55:41,354
death and destruction on the planet.

1807
01:55:41,465 --> 01:55:46,079
More than 200 million individuals were killed in the twentieth century alone.

1808
01:55:48,826 --> 01:55:53,375
So how would applying the principle of non-violation change this dynamic?

1809
01:55:53,947 --> 01:55:58,591
It would take us from incremental change of a fundamentally flawed system,

1810
01:55:58,616 --> 01:56:00,721
to a complete transformation,

1811
01:56:00,746 --> 01:56:03,963
where not just some, or even the majority,

1812
01:56:04,036 --> 01:56:07,697
but everyone could truly have the opportunity to thrive.

1813
01:56:09,364 --> 01:56:12,632
In order to impliment the principle of non-violation,

1814
01:56:12,784 --> 01:56:16,434
it makes sense to me to honestly re-examine our past,

1815
01:56:16,459 --> 01:56:19,466
because it doesn't work to try to build a healthy living system

1816
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:21,800
on top of an unhealthy one.

1817
01:56:22,308 --> 01:56:26,169
We have to go back to the most fundamental acts of injustice,

1818
01:56:26,194 --> 01:56:28,399
upon which the country was founded.

1819
01:56:28,424 --> 01:56:30,969
In the seizure of the lands of the people

1820
01:56:30,994 --> 01:56:33,784
and the slaughter of their women and children,

1821
01:56:34,221 --> 01:56:40,391
and the rendering destitute most of the remnants of these people,

1822
01:56:40,495 --> 01:56:43,381
is such an ingrievous wrong,

1823
01:56:44,103 --> 01:56:47,671
that we believe, that we have to deal with that,

1824
01:56:47,696 --> 01:56:50,290
to come to grips with that, in a fundamental way,

1825
01:56:50,315 --> 01:56:54,586
understanding that they are not wrongs, that were done and completed,

1826
01:56:54,817 --> 01:56:56,297
a 150 years ago.

1827
01:56:56,322 --> 01:56:59,272
They're wrongs, that are continued every single day.

1828
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:03,354
So you have through the history of North America and the U.S.

1829
01:57:03,379 --> 01:57:05,696
over 500 treaties signed

1830
01:57:05,721 --> 01:57:07,552
with indigenous nations,

1831
01:57:07,648 --> 01:57:11,257
were every single one of them now has been violated.

1832
01:57:11,559 --> 01:57:14,113
In fact, tremendous amount of wealth

1833
01:57:14,138 --> 01:57:16,871
have been generated from indigenous people's lands and resources

1834
01:57:16,896 --> 01:57:21,596
and billions of dollars every year is still being generated by corporations in European nations,

1835
01:57:21,621 --> 01:57:25,704
based on the continous exploitation of indigenous people's lands and resources.

1836
01:57:25,784 --> 01:57:29,115
If we didn't have large corporations and Western governments

1837
01:57:29,140 --> 01:57:31,637
defining how you and I were to relate to each other,

1838
01:57:31,662 --> 01:57:34,001
living here in North America now together,

1839
01:57:34,026 --> 01:57:37,748
how would we relate to one another, how would we make it different.

1840
01:57:38,796 --> 01:57:41,789
It's going to take time and courageous effort,

1841
01:57:41,814 --> 01:57:44,803
to shift the consciousness and accomplish the tasks,

1842
01:57:44,828 --> 01:57:47,853
that will move us toward the world, I'm talking about.

1843
01:57:48,107 --> 01:57:52,614
And yet I know of no greater gift, that we could give to future generations.

1844
01:57:53,194 --> 01:57:55,392
We can't do everything at once.

1845
01:57:55,479 --> 01:58:00,025
I envisioned three overlapping stages of the solutions process.

1846
01:58:02,398 --> 01:58:07,254
In stage one we bring as much integrity as possible to our current systems.

1847
01:58:07,652 --> 01:58:10,542
If we cut the U.S. military budget in half,

1848
01:58:10,630 --> 01:58:14,934
it would still roughly equal to defense spending of the entire rest of the world.

1849
01:58:15,538 --> 01:58:18,848
Between that and getting rid of the Federal Reserve

1850
01:58:18,873 --> 01:58:21,882
over a trillion dollars a year would be freed

1851
01:58:22,058 --> 01:58:24,459
enough to feed everyone on our planet,

1852
01:58:24,484 --> 01:58:28,176
deal with social issues and heal our environment.

1853
01:58:28,955 --> 01:58:32,968
Many people believe that widespread starvation and poverty are inevitable

1854
01:58:33,159 --> 01:58:38,103
but compared to war, eliminating poverty and restoring the environment are cheap.

1855
01:58:38,818 --> 01:58:41,756
According to Lester Brown's "Earth Policy Institute"

1856
01:58:41,781 --> 01:58:46,480
it would take under $ 200 billion dollars a year to restore the earth's environment

1857
01:58:46,505 --> 01:58:48,701
and meet global social goals.

1858
01:58:50,519 --> 01:58:54,439
But this stage isn't the endgoal of the liberty perspective.

1859
01:58:54,565 --> 01:58:57,064
While stage one has lot of the compassion,

1860
01:58:57,089 --> 01:59:00,133
typically associated with liberal-democratic agenda,

1861
01:59:00,364 --> 01:59:03,058
stage two reflects much of the wisdom

1862
01:59:03,083 --> 01:59:05,781
of the traditional conservative worldview.

1863
01:59:06,322 --> 01:59:08,797
In stage two we shrink government's role,

1864
01:59:08,822 --> 01:59:10,816
to protect the individual liberty

1865
01:59:10,841 --> 01:59:13,382
and storing things we share in common,

1866
01:59:13,407 --> 01:59:16,912
like ecosystems and the airwaves we use to communicate.

1867
01:59:19,326 --> 01:59:21,794
As the system gains integrity

1868
01:59:21,819 --> 01:59:24,117
and will move to sound currency,

1869
01:59:24,142 --> 01:59:28,771
people will have enough money to have more control over everything that affects them.

1870
01:59:29,835 --> 01:59:32,588
Stage three grows out of the increasing freedom,

1871
01:59:32,604 --> 01:59:35,012
that people gain in stages one and two,

1872
01:59:35,037 --> 01:59:38,275
as they have more money and more time.

1873
01:59:38,593 --> 01:59:43,155
There is no involuntary tax and therefore no involuntary governments.

1874
01:59:43,696 --> 01:59:45,949
There is no monopoly on force.

1875
01:59:46,104 --> 01:59:48,931
There are rules, but no rulers.

1876
01:59:49,741 --> 01:59:52,225
Rigorously protecting individual rights

1877
01:59:52,257 --> 01:59:55,789
turnes out to be key for honouring our interdependence.

1878
01:59:56,002 --> 01:59:59,684
We can be distinct, and unified, at the same time.

1879
02:00:01,137 --> 02:00:03,950
As utopian as this can sound at first

1880
02:00:03,975 --> 02:00:07,521
I'we been thrilled to see how much practical thinking has been done

1881
02:00:07,546 --> 02:00:10,617
to deal with tough issues like health care,

1882
02:00:10,642 --> 02:00:13,151
crime and education.

1883
02:00:14,597 --> 02:00:19,446
These three stages validate the best of both the liberal and conservative perspectives

1884
02:00:19,471 --> 02:00:21,867
that have divided us for so long

1885
02:00:21,892 --> 02:00:24,397
and then reconcile them at a new level,

1886
02:00:24,524 --> 02:00:26,548
around non-violation

1887
02:00:26,683 --> 02:00:29,547
a core ethic we all share.

1888
02:00:30,603 --> 02:00:33,167
Stage three honours human incentive

1889
02:00:33,192 --> 02:00:36,674
and finally includes the rights of not just many,

1890
02:00:36,699 --> 02:00:39,484
not just most, but everyone.

1891
02:00:43,484 --> 02:00:49,297
The torus provides a template for a society based on integrity and wholeness.

1892
02:00:49,845 --> 02:00:52,251
It conserves, what's working.

1893
02:00:52,403 --> 02:00:55,915
It has built in feedback, so it can self-correct and innovate

1894
02:00:55,940 --> 02:00:58,082
to maintain balance.

1895
02:00:58,598 --> 02:01:01,836
We can apply these and other features of the torus dynamic

1896
02:01:01,861 --> 02:01:04,140
to our human social systems.

1897
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:09,559
I truely believe that aligning conciously with a fundamental life energy pattern,

1898
02:01:09,584 --> 02:01:11,003
at every level:

1899
02:01:11,028 --> 02:01:12,139
physical,

1900
02:01:12,164 --> 02:01:13,364
emotional,

1901
02:01:13,389 --> 02:01:14,547
mental,

1902
02:01:14,572 --> 02:01:17,124
interpersonal and environmental

1903
02:01:17,236 --> 02:01:22,141
it's ultimately the art, science and the celebration of love.

1904
02:01:22,214 --> 02:01:24,628
That's what we're here to learn!

1905
02:01:26,176 --> 02:01:29,183
The fundamental insight of our interconnectedness

1906
02:01:29,208 --> 02:01:31,692
changed the way I approach everything.

1907
02:01:31,970 --> 02:01:35,811
In my own life I found a practical expression of this philosophy,

1908
02:01:35,882 --> 02:01:39,368
in the modern non-violent martial art of Aikido.

1909
02:01:40,487 --> 02:01:42,418
It offers powerful guidance

1910
02:01:42,443 --> 02:01:47,871
on how to respond effectively and non-aggressively to the global domination agenda.

1911
02:01:48,904 --> 02:01:51,661
Morihei Ueshiba, its founder,

1912
02:01:51,772 --> 02:01:57,456
talked that to practice Aikido, one must mimic the movement of atoms and galaxies.

1913
02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:02,043
As free energy technology blends with the toroidal pattern,

1914
02:02:02,068 --> 02:02:04,174
to access unlimited power,

1915
02:02:04,199 --> 02:02:06,661
Aikido, the way of harmony

1916
02:02:06,796 --> 02:02:09,750
blends with the energy of an attacker ...

1917
02:02:12,988 --> 02:02:14,905
redirecting it ...

1918
02:02:16,017 --> 02:02:18,322
to peaceful resolution.

1919
02:02:23,295 --> 02:02:26,440
<i>Aikido is not a technique to fight and defeat an enemy.</i>

1920
02:02:26,464 --> 02:02:32,420
<i>It is a way to reconcile the world and make human beings one family.</i>

1921
02:02:33,349 --> 02:02:37,227
Gandhi and King applied these principles of non-aggressive power,

1922
02:02:37,252 --> 02:02:39,758
at the economic and social levels.

1923
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:43,932
If we respond with violence to the domination agenda,

1924
02:02:43,957 --> 02:02:45,761
other than in self-defense,

1925
02:02:45,786 --> 02:02:49,602
it would only continue the old "us versus them" paradigm

1926
02:02:49,721 --> 02:02:53,527
and provide an excuse for even more police state measures.

1927
02:02:53,885 --> 02:02:58,085
I believe, that it's essential, both morally and strategically,

1928
02:02:58,229 --> 02:03:00,819
that we take the path of non-aggression.

1929
02:03:02,208 --> 02:03:04,381
There is another aspect of the torus,

1930
02:03:04,406 --> 02:03:09,441
that has profound implications for how we can respond to the challenges before us.

1931
02:03:09,926 --> 02:03:13,544
It is the absolute stillness, the zero point,

1932
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:16,702
that lies at the center of each toroidal system.

1933
02:03:17,282 --> 02:03:20,904
I believe that you and I, as well as every other being,

1934
02:03:20,929 --> 02:03:23,018
are torus energy fields,

1935
02:03:23,043 --> 02:03:24,517
centered by stillness

1936
02:03:24,542 --> 02:03:26,464
and each connected to one another

1937
02:03:26,489 --> 02:03:29,736
into the boundless consciousness of a living universe.

1938
02:03:30,245 --> 02:03:33,091
As much as I benefit from the experience of others,

1939
02:03:33,116 --> 02:03:35,944
as highlighted here with the navigating insights

1940
02:03:36,198 --> 02:03:38,553
and as valuable as daily feedback is

1941
02:03:38,578 --> 02:03:40,931
about what's really going on in the world,

1942
02:03:40,956 --> 02:03:43,252
as we see with the vitals

1943
02:03:43,309 --> 02:03:46,317
I'we come to recognize that our primary compass

1944
02:03:46,342 --> 02:03:48,939
is our own inner guidance.

1945
02:03:49,431 --> 02:03:52,104
As we learn to quiet the noise

1946
02:03:52,129 --> 02:03:54,367
and amplify the inner signal

1947
02:03:54,392 --> 02:03:55,979
we can better hear the voice,

1948
02:03:56,004 --> 02:03:59,850
that naturally knows and offers wise direction.

1949
02:04:00,787 --> 02:04:03,671
We have an entire inner life,

1950
02:04:03,696 --> 02:04:06,818
a vibrant and lively inner life,

1951
02:04:07,041 --> 02:04:12,574
that is truely the navigator of the path, that we take on the outside.

1952
02:04:12,829 --> 02:04:17,541
If your inner life is the driver of how you show up in the world,

1953
02:04:17,803 --> 02:04:22,712
it makes sense, that if you want to have anything to do with where you're going,

1954
02:04:22,737 --> 02:04:27,260
that you have to be in relationship with that inner life, with that driver.

1955
02:04:28,824 --> 02:04:33,805
As we develop increased relationship to who's in the driver seat,

1956
02:04:34,512 --> 02:04:38,477
what happens is that here is a synergy, it's a symbiotic relationship,

1957
02:04:38,565 --> 02:04:43,909
that our inner lives are actually able to be more in tandem

1958
02:04:43,934 --> 02:04:46,210
of we're choosing to go

1959
02:04:46,235 --> 02:04:48,335
and we're able to get there.

1960
02:04:48,986 --> 02:04:53,252
We are not nearly as insignificant in our impact, as we think we are.

1961
02:04:54,809 --> 02:04:59,039
In order to heal the world, we have to start telling a different story to ourselves,

1962
02:04:59,343 --> 02:05:03,295
we have to start engaging a different story with others.

1963
02:05:03,320 --> 02:05:07,480
It's a collective story, that manifests as the world.

1964
02:05:07,703 --> 02:05:12,009
Humanity is now in a very interesting evolutionary phase,

1965
02:05:12,034 --> 02:05:15,710
in which we move from hostile, aggressive competition,

1966
02:05:15,735 --> 02:05:18,181
which is in the nature of young species,

1967
02:05:18,206 --> 02:05:22,281
into a more mature mode of cooperation, collaboration.

1968
02:05:22,401 --> 02:05:24,192
There is no question in this country,

1969
02:05:24,217 --> 02:05:30,133
that money, that capital, is being increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few

1970
02:05:30,356 --> 02:05:34,179
and those, who are so powerful, are concentrating it farther,

1971
02:05:34,204 --> 02:05:38,025
but there is a force, that's more powerful and that's the power of the people.

1972
02:05:38,145 --> 02:05:40,041
When we look at the crisis now,

1973
02:05:40,066 --> 02:05:43,240
it is so easy to fall out of love with life,

1974
02:05:43,447 --> 02:05:46,536
is so easy to become pessimistic and desperate.

1975
02:05:46,910 --> 02:05:48,861
But, from my perspective,

1976
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:51,456
the crisis has matured to the point,

1977
02:05:51,576 --> 02:05:54,466
of being on the threshold of mass awakening.

1978
02:05:54,491 --> 02:05:59,460
And that feeling inside me

1979
02:05:59,929 --> 02:06:02,967
gives me the vitality, to know,

1980
02:06:02,992 --> 02:06:05,930
that no matter how small, what I'm doing, looks to me,

1981
02:06:05,955 --> 02:06:08,442
in the face of these huge problems,

1982
02:06:08,681 --> 02:06:11,997
that the impulse of evolution is not small.

1983
02:06:12,187 --> 02:06:16,494
And when it's in everybody, who's waking up, it's huge.

1984
02:06:17,764 --> 02:06:20,343
And as more and more of us are waking up,

1985
02:06:20,368 --> 02:06:23,491
linking up and daring to speak up,

1986
02:06:23,555 --> 02:06:27,104
the scheme for global domination is being exposed

1987
02:06:27,343 --> 02:06:32,766
and we're discovering solutions, that can create the world, we earn for and deserve.

1988
02:06:33,473 --> 02:06:35,709
Again and again, throughout history,

1989
02:06:35,734 --> 02:06:39,723
when people have recognized tyranny, rearing its cruel head,

1990
02:06:39,748 --> 02:06:42,981
they've come together and stood up for liberty.

1991
02:06:43,624 --> 02:06:46,988
I am confident humankind will look back at this period

1992
02:06:47,013 --> 02:06:50,821
and be proud, that when we saw, we acted.

1993
02:06:51,471 --> 02:06:54,344
Thank you for coming on this journey with us!

1994
02:06:54,369 --> 02:06:57,673
I'm convinced, we have what it takes to thrive.

1995
02:06:57,864 --> 02:06:59,977
Lets make it happen!

1996
02:07:00,002 --> 02:07:10,002
