I will have extracted

do solemnly swear
that by the end of the year...

00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,512
The difference between
coal and rock?

10
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,951
Do you see this chunk?

11
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,793
I'm going to put it to the test now.

12
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,914
You see, it's rock.

13
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,673
This rust-colored lump is coal, see?

14
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,708
Coal.

15
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,073
And then you've also got
these pieces,

16
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,074
they're dark brown and look like coal,
little pieces like this.

17
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,197
I check each shovelful for coal
and keep every piece,

18
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,038
no matter how small it is.

19
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,470
There's definitely coal here.

20
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,478
If you dig deeper into this hole,

21
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,912
there's definitely coal, back there,
good coal,

22
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,432
great big chunks.

23
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,875
Now everything's frozen
so it's not as good.

24
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,117
This time of year I can fill one sack a day.

25
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,517
But in the summertime
I'll get 2 to 3 sacks.

26
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,234
Honest, 2 to 3 sacks.

In times of peace as well as war...

40
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,755
miners always love their country.

prepared to fight the enemy.

43
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:03,910
You can't compare us with Stakhanov,
that was something completely different.

44
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,435
We're not driven by enthusiasm.

45
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,029
We're not being pushed:
dig more, dig faster.

46
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,593
That was all just a show.

47
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,873
Yeah, just a show,
nothing but a big show.

48
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,316
No, Stakhanovism wasn't a show,

49
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,193
it was a movement
to stimulate the coal industry.

50
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,152
No, Wolodja,
we don't need enthusiasm.

51
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,794
Sure, but we're motivated
by something else.

52
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,797
Our enthusiasm comes from the
will to survive.

53
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,194
We work to survive.

54
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,039
If you don't work,
you'll freeze to death.

55
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,719
And that's that.

56
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,957
When Petrowitsch
enters the mine he says:

57
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,037
"Hello, mine."

58
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,829
It's a kind of substitute prayer.

59
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,838
You come in and say,
"Hello, mine,"

60
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,191
go in further and say,
"Hello, place," and so on.

61
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,710
Or: "Tremble, mine!

62
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,388
"Here comes the drunken coal digger!"

63
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,998
We slaughtered the cow today.
We have meat again.

64
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,437
This son of a bitch is driving me crazy.
Come here, Witja.

65
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,792
Pickax?
- You don't need it.

66
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,951
Okay, buddy, here we go!

67
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,719
We used to work in government mines,

68
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,518
but they're all shut down now.

69
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,470
We had to find new jobs,
but there weren't any.

70
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,276
How we found this place?
They used to work this mine ages ago.

71
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,199
The pits were already here.

72
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,915
We went in,
saw there was still coal in there,

73
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,476
and that's how we started
excavating here.

74
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,118
It was as simple as that.

75
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,634
Not just sometimes,
we're scared the whole time.

76
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,510
It just has to cave in 10cm
and that's the end of us.

77
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,434
There'd be no way
to get us out of here.

78
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,310
Is there still some in there?
- Yes.

79
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,831
Our grandfathers used to call
veins like these "mousetraps."

80
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,952
C'mon, slow down a little.
- Don't have a heart attack.

81
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,711
Just keep pushing and
we'll be done soon.

82
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,951
My daughter told me her school
is all damp and clammy.

83
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,918
There's water
seeping in from above.

84
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,556
Everyone keeps their
coats on in class.

85
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,639
Shit, all they do is take off their
scarves and mittens.

86
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,995
Those fuckin' idiots.

87
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,673
The dumplings are good,
just a little cold already.

88
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,429
Ah, they were cooked in oil,
that's why they cool down faster.

89
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,796
We should have
taken a break earlier.

90
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,758
We should have worked faster.

91
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,998
Is your goat doing better?

92
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,990
Yes, she's better.
the doctor prescribed her some vitamins.

93
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,271
Tanja feeds her with a syringe.
She's healthy and eating again.

94
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,478
One of mine died.

95
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,398
What, a kid?
- Yeah.

96
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,398
What happened?
- No idea. It wasn't eating.

97
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,598
Borislawa fed and fed it,
then it kicked the bucket.

98
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,998
We're doing it right. My wife says,
"I'm not feeding them like before.

99
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,272
"I'm following the book.
Even if they're scrawny.

100
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,393
"Let them be scrawny.
I'll feed them when they get bigger."

101
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,511
Who knows,
maybe it's the right way.

102
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,751
Don't get stuck.

103
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,590
Stop! Easy does it!

104
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,957
Wait till he's on his feet.

105
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,712
Here we go!

106
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,915
How our life together has been
up until now?

107
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,596
It's been good, right?
- Yes, very good.

108
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,555
Life itself is full of happiness.

109
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,599
Especially when we were
young, it was wonderful.

110
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,519
During vacations we'd drive all over,
everywhere.

111
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,432
Yes, we had a car
and could drive to the seaside.

112
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,598
We always went some place.
We had everything then.

113
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,999
Even now, we take outdoor trips with
the boys. We celebrate every holiday.

114
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,309
And our celebrations are usually
happy rollicking parties.

115
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,196
But - we've lived together
for 21 years...

116
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,119
and have never celebrated our anniversary.

117
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,514
In fact, we never really celebrated
our wedding.

118
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,316
I used to come here on my breaks,
I was studying at Perm University in the Urals.

119
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:28,756
I was in my third year and afterwards
I was supposed to stay there to work.

120
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,470
He asked me,
"Do you really want to stay there?"

121
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,989
We were celebrating New Year's
with friends.

122
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,829
On January 2, he woke up
in the morning and said to me:

123
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,510
"You know what, we should get married.
Then I'll know you're coming back."

124
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,235
I captured her.

125
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,273
Hi.

126
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,998
Who do we have here?
- This is our little Knopochka.

127
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,434
Why are you carrying her?
Did you just feed her?

128
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,030
She's so little, our Knopochka!

129
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,072
Say: "How do you do?"

130
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,516
Is she doing alright now?
Is she okay?

131
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,918
Yes, she's all better now.

132
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,873
Is there anything to eat?

133
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,755
Yes, I made <i>pelmeni</i>.
Shall I run a bath for you?

134
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,793
Yes, run me a bath.

135
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,991
Are you tired?

136
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,039
I'm exhausted.

137
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,637
Do you want to lie down?

138
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,394
I just want to sleep.

139
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,068
You've been lying on your back
all day anyway.

140
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,152
I'm hungry.

141
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,237
Your dinner
is coming right up.

142
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,955
Meanwhile you can run my bath.

143
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,752
In a second.

144
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,228
Of course our pit is illegal
according to the law.

145
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,511
But we see things differently.

146
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,836
The state doesn't give us
work or wages.

147
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,828
But we have to survive somehow.

148
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,430
Yes, and feed our families,
our children.

149
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:48,677
I'm not getting rich.
I'm not making a profit.

150
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,477
I'm doing this to survive,
no more and no less.

151
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,156
At least you could work
the next eight months.

152
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,110
I'm not complaining,
but I think I'm sick.

153
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,396
In any case I'm staying home tomorrow.

154
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,632
Do you like this job?

155
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,637
I think it's great.

156
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,235
To warm us up
I brought a little something to drink.

157
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,348
Otherwise...

158
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,072
Sure we'd rather have
a good job,

159
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,430
a job where we weren't
always so dirty,

160
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,949
where we could wear clean clothes.

161
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,591
But we don't have that.

162
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,315
We should have gone to college.

163
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,351
And what good would
that have done us?

164
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,632
Knowledge is power.
- But what good would it have done?

165
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,717
No good.
You finish your studies...

166
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,514
and then none
of the companies will hire you.

167
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,234
Everything's closing,
everything's falling apart.

168
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,959
That's the way it is.

169
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,753
As a girl, I wanted to become a dancer,
I loved to dance, didn't I?

170
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,832
I loved to dance.

171
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,954
Now I dance with
sacks of coal in the mine.

172
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,196
That looks terrific.

173
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,198
You haul 1.5 to 2 tons a day and
you're all danced out.

174
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,555
What do you want to do tonight?

175
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,197
I can't wait to take a bath.
- Want to come over to our place?

176
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,519
I don't know yet, I'm tired.

177
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,439
We could watch TV together.

178
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,589
It's too far for me,
I have to get up early tomorrow.

179
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,518
On "The Word of Life"
they always say:

180
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,109
"You commit a sin
when you work in the mines.

181
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,675
"Stay home and pray
and God will provide."

182
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,393
Yeah right, God will provide...

183
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,114
A loaf of bread will fall
from the sky, or what?

184
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,674
<i>Alexei Stakhanov</i>

185
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,633
Now it's burning.

186
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,837
Okay, Slawa,
here's to you, don't forget us...

187
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,233
and may you enjoy
your hard-earned retirement.

188
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,630
Let your things burn so you'll
never have to wear them again!

189
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,075
Come, drink!

190
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,717
Here, Sergej, here.
After all, we're celebrating your retirement.

191
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,390
Yes, congratulations and enjoy retired life!
- Thank you.

192
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,872
GHOSTS

193
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,630
Kawah Ijen, INDONESIA

194
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,992
A friend of mine dreamt...

195
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,036
that a goat head
had to be sacrificed every year.

196
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,877
The goat head has to be taken up
and buried in the sulfur.

197
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,951
If this sacrifice, which is to be made
once a year, is neglected,

198
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,835
an accident is sure to happen.

199
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:25,673
Once a woman fell into the volcano.

200
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,356
No one knows exactly how it happened.

201
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,314
What is certain is that
she fell down it and died.

202
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,555
I can tell you exactly how it happened
with a friend.

203
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,992
He was working in Sari Enam.

204
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,476
While he was breaking off chunks of sulfur,

205
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,871
he suddenly slipped...

206
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:08,315
and fell into the boiling sulfur
and was burned to death.

207
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,758
What do you drink
when you drink?

208
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,273
It varies. Sometimes Johnnie Walker,
sometimes something else.

209
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,718
What's important is
that it gets you all fired up...

210
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,715
and then you go into a bar
where there are fist fights.

211
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,071
Sometimes your own body
is all bruised and swollen.

212
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,270
Why do you have to get drunk first?

213
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,075
So that you are calm
and feel no fear.

214
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,477
I used to be able to take on 4 men.

215
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,231
Even 6 of them
was no problem for me.

216
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,716
I beat up the biggest one...

217
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,514
and the other ones ran away.

218
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:33,670
I do the same thing
when I take on 4 men.

219
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,997
I throw the one I beat up outside in the grass
and leave him lying there.

220
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,237
Then I go home.

221
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,839
Is he dead then?

222
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,749
No, just unconscious -
after that I leave him alone.

223
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,397
Don't they come after you
for beating people unconscious?

224
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,912
Of course they come after you
so you hide.

225
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,156
Is that why you came here?

226
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,557
Yes, I fled straight here to
Banyuwangi.

227
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:09,074
I heard there was sulfur work
on Kawah Ijen.

228
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,473
I came here...

229
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,198
because it's better than getting
mixed up in brawls somewhere else.

230
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,833
Are you one of Ijo's regular customers?
Or Enti's? Is she good?

231
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:26,753
She's fantastic! She's so slender.

232
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,436
But what's the fat one's name?
Tagiri?

233
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,394
Yes, Tagiri.

234
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:40,720
She's real fat.

235
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,877
I like the way she moves, though.

236
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,359
But moves aren't everything.

237
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,913
What counts is the satisfaction.

238
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,076
Oh yes, the satisfaction.

239
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,794
Yes exactly,
what counts is the satisfaction.

240
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,915
Yeah, instead of going to Tagiri,
or whatever her name is,

241
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:05,157
I go down to Banyuwangi
after weighing in.

242
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:10,154
There you pay 150 thousand,
200 thousand at the most.

243
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,113
A room costs
50-75 thousand extra,

244
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,235
you have a little fun,
you come back up here,

245
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:24,159
climb the mountain, go back down and
have your load weighed.

246
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,989
What else have they given you?
- Cookies.

247
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,919
Cookies? Is that all, never a kiss?

248
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,030
What?
- A kiss?

249
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,277
Yes, sure, once.

250
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,198
It happened to me once before too.

251
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:47,349
Three months ago I saw a woman
and said to her: "Morning."

252
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,917
"You come from?"
She said: "France."

253
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,236
And I asked her:

254
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,510
"What is name?"
Aha, your name is Nofia.

255
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,759
What language is that?
- We shook hands. English.

256
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,871
Can you speak English?
- A little.

257
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,311
Enough for a short conversation.

258
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,796
After we shook hands,
I said:

259
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,718
"I want to kiss you."

260
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,515
"Please." Then I kissed her
and felt elation.

261
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,395
My nose was still dirty
from the sulfur kitchen.

262
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,149
But I was allowed to kiss her.
That was very pleasurable.

263
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,475
Show him a ten.

264
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,398
Ten? Do we want to buy it?

265
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,068
Yeah, for 10 it's OK.
- We don't have a 10.

266
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,236
Do you see the vapors
over there?

267
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,549
How many kilos are you carrying?
- 115 kilograms.

268
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,432
Really? That's a lot.

269
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,198
Yes, of course.

270
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,993
If we let our emotions get the better of us...

271
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,598
and let the teasing
that turns our ears red get to us,

272
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:35,717
we will quit our jobs
and in doing so harm ourselves.

273
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,317
How much can you carry?

274
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,715
70kg, and you?

275
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,513
Me too.

276
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,714
But we manage those 70kg pretty well.

277
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:52,751
One shouldn't overdo things.

278
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,794
Forget what the others say about us.

279
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:02,672
And who knows,
one day we'll get away from this place.

280
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:10,432
We're climbing up the mountain,
we're climbing up the mountain,

281
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:15,276
climbing up, up, up,
high up to the mountain top.

282
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,639
Do you like to listen to
dangdut?

283
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,989
No.

284
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:13,278
Me either,
I prefer western music.

285
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,789
What's that?

286
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,354
Bon Jovi, Scorpions,
that kind of stuff.

287
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,358
What kind of name is Bon Jovi?

288
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:32,758
That's the name of the band.
One of the members is named Bon Jovi.

289
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:42,589
He's the singer,
songwriter, and director.

290
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,631
And do you understand them?

291
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:50,710
Yes, I understand them. But I can't afford
their CDs, they're too expensive.

292
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,949
The band is made up of four people:

293
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,070
Nicolas, Brian,

294
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,673
Adam, and Bon Jovi.

295
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,355
That many?
And only one is Bon Jovi?

296
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:15,873
Yeah, like dangdut.
He plays the guitar.

297
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,236
That means the group is called Bon Jovi?

298
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:27,597
Yes, they made the name of the
band out of his name.

299
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,109
LIONS

300
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,996
Innards! Skin! Head!

301
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,989
Skin! Innards!

302
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,312
Innards! Skin! Head!
Innards! Skin! Head!

303
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,348
Mallam!

304
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,639
Hey, boy!
Hold this goat for me for a sec.

305
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,228
Mallam!

306
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,319
Be right there.

307
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,275
I come.

308
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,393
You got it lying down already?

309
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,073
You got it lying down?

310
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,310
Watch your foot!

311
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,238
That will be 40 naira.

312
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:55,031
Who does this one belong to?
Bayo, pay please.

313
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,240
I have the money.

314
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,117
You have to pay immediately.

315
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,832
Don't ask me, I can pay you.

316
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,875
Don't ask me, I can pay you.

317
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,229
I've always paid.

318
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,078
Sometimes you make problems.

319
01:01:44,518 --> 01:01:46,156
My name is Ishaq Mohammed.

320
01:01:47,558 --> 01:01:51,995
My workday begins between
6 and 7 a.m.

321
01:01:52,358 --> 01:01:56,510
Usually I get up at 5
in order to be at work on time.

322
01:01:58,518 --> 01:02:04,309
Killing goats
doesn't bother me.

323
01:02:05,998 --> 01:02:08,796
Before I slaughter a goat,
I utter God's name.

324
01:02:12,638 --> 01:02:17,268
Normally we slaughter
350 goats a day.

325
01:02:18,398 --> 01:02:22,596
Sometimes it's only 300.

326
01:02:23,598 --> 01:02:26,749
Other days it's only 150.

327
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:30,314
But there are times when
goats are in short supply -

328
01:02:30,878 --> 01:02:33,597
and then we might have
no more than 10 or 15.

329
01:02:33,798 --> 01:02:36,676
And sometimes we even have
no goats at all.

330
01:03:00,998 --> 01:03:04,832
Now. You roast skin and I roast
goats, all our folk can be one.

331
01:03:05,158 --> 01:03:06,989
This one he roasts heads.
- What about him?

332
01:03:07,198 --> 01:03:08,472
He roasts skin too.

333
01:03:08,678 --> 01:03:09,190
You roast skin?

334
01:03:09,398 --> 01:03:11,309
And you? What do you roast?

335
01:03:11,518 --> 01:03:12,553
I roast everything.

336
01:03:12,758 --> 01:03:16,034
Everything? Humans too?
- Everything but human beings.

337
01:03:17,638 --> 01:03:20,106
Any animal, I can roast it.

338
01:03:21,078 --> 01:03:23,638
See, look. I roasted this.
I did a good job.

339
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:24,270
Let me see.

340
01:03:24,478 --> 01:03:27,629
Soak it and it'll turn white...
- It's black like you!

341
01:03:27,918 --> 01:03:29,476
Nobody wants that.

342
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:35,353
Where are the customers? C'mon!
I roast goats! I'm available!

343
01:03:39,678 --> 01:03:43,307
I don't tire, I don't tire,
I want always to go back to my fire.

344
01:03:43,518 --> 01:03:44,871
We pray to God
to give our...

345
01:03:45,078 --> 01:03:47,717
governors and heads
of states the wisdom...

346
01:03:47,918 --> 01:03:50,876
to keep our borders open...

347
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:53,956
so that we can continue
to export meat.

348
01:03:54,158 --> 01:03:56,467
This is the only way we
can eat.

349
01:03:56,678 --> 01:04:02,116
We kill it and roast it.
We the poor people can just work.

350
01:04:05,718 --> 01:04:08,312
Roasting is very important.

351
01:04:08,518 --> 01:04:11,316
The butcher's trade would be no good
without roasting.

352
01:04:11,518 --> 01:04:13,110
Not everybody likes
skinned meat.

353
01:04:13,318 --> 01:04:17,027
Roasted meat is much more delicious
than skinned meat.

354
01:04:18,078 --> 01:04:18,715
Listen up!

355
01:04:18,918 --> 01:04:20,112
What do you want to say?

356
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:22,991
I'm roasting a goat for Mr. Chinedu.

357
01:04:23,198 --> 01:04:25,553
He don't want to pay
me better money.

358
01:04:25,758 --> 01:04:27,476
And the government?

359
01:04:27,678 --> 01:04:30,397
The government? I am the government!
- Oh yeah?

360
01:04:30,598 --> 01:04:32,554
Yeah. The government belongs to me!
And my fire is the best!

361
01:04:32,758 --> 01:04:34,714
How do you like this job?

362
01:04:35,118 --> 01:04:37,348
This job wears me out.

363
01:04:37,558 --> 01:04:40,072
It makes me happy,
it feeds me.

364
01:04:40,278 --> 01:04:43,429
And it's much more honorable
to work than to steal.

365
01:04:43,638 --> 01:04:46,436
Stealing is a disgrace.
But this one, I am very proud of it.

366
01:04:46,638 --> 01:04:49,027
Yes, that's exactly right.
If you steal,

367
01:04:49,238 --> 01:04:51,468
they cut off your head.

368
01:04:51,678 --> 01:04:56,513
They slit your throat,
and they roast you.

369
01:05:16,358 --> 01:05:17,871
Clean water for sale!

370
01:05:30,358 --> 01:05:34,112
I don't worry about tomorrow,
A-Boy is my name...

371
01:05:36,638 --> 01:05:38,674
A-Boy is my name...

372
01:06:03,158 --> 01:06:06,867
Where is the head butcher in this
slaughterhouse of Port Harcourt?

373
01:06:07,358 --> 01:06:10,828
I, the son of a lion, come to
your doorstep.

374
01:06:11,118 --> 01:06:14,997
May God protect you,
head butcher!

375
01:06:15,198 --> 01:06:19,237
Of all the famous slaughterers
you are the king.

376
01:06:19,438 --> 01:06:22,077
You are blessed with rich customers.

377
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:25,270
The poor
benefit from your generosity.

378
01:06:26,038 --> 01:06:29,314
The government pays tribute to
your slaughterhouse.

379
01:06:29,558 --> 01:06:32,516
Everyone in the River State
buys his meat from you.

380
01:06:32,758 --> 01:06:35,352
May almighty Allah bless you.

381
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:39,551
Of all the famous slaughterers
you are the king.

382
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:03,349
God bless all of you!

383
01:07:06,238 --> 01:07:08,115
Of all slaughterers
you are king.

384
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:11,515
You are the rich man whose abundance
overflows to the poor.

385
01:08:58,478 --> 01:09:00,594
Skin! Innards! Head!

386
01:09:02,198 --> 01:09:04,632
Skin! Innards! Head!
Skin! Innards! Head!

387
01:09:04,838 --> 01:09:06,351
Skin! Innards! Head!

388
01:09:08,638 --> 01:09:09,912
Isn't 4,500 enough for you?!

389
01:09:10,118 --> 01:09:11,756
Skin is expensive at the moment.

390
01:09:11,958 --> 01:09:15,030
The neck skin is good,
but there's nothing on the legs.

391
01:09:15,558 --> 01:09:16,434
That's ridiculous.

392
01:09:16,638 --> 01:09:19,869
I'm telling you the neck is good,
the legs aren't.

393
01:09:22,478 --> 01:09:25,151
Ask Mallam,
but I think the skin is good.

394
01:09:25,358 --> 01:09:28,316
Okay, I'll give you another 100 naira,
because it's you.

395
01:09:30,758 --> 01:09:33,477
100 naira, what do you say?

396
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:39,950
Tell him I'll pay 4,600.
But that's it.

397
01:09:43,278 --> 01:09:44,506
Come here, feel the skin.

398
01:09:45,398 --> 01:09:47,958
Skin! Innards! Head!

399
01:09:49,158 --> 01:09:51,035
Make way!
Make way!

400
01:11:46,078 --> 01:11:48,592
Usually we work
three hours a day.

401
01:11:50,078 --> 01:11:53,673
Depending on the workload
we'll wash up to 70 goats a day.

402
01:11:59,558 --> 01:12:02,675
I don't know if I'm the best
and the fastest here,

403
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:05,758
but I thank God for my skills.

404
01:12:06,118 --> 01:12:09,269
Other people have other skills,
but I thank God for mine.

405
01:12:15,318 --> 01:12:18,469
I believe this job makes me special.

406
01:12:24,438 --> 01:12:26,906
You know why we mark the
cow heads?

407
01:12:27,118 --> 01:12:29,074
We do this so
we can tell them apart.

408
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:33,157
Lots of cow heads
are taken to be roasted.

409
01:12:34,278 --> 01:12:38,351
Here you can see clearly.
The marking: EA.

410
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:40,869
The other head says the same thing:
EA.

411
01:12:41,078 --> 01:12:44,195
Everyone here has his own marking.

412
01:12:44,558 --> 01:12:46,594
If you use someone else's mark,

413
01:12:46,878 --> 01:12:53,192
you're stigmatized as a thief and bring all
sorts of problems upon yourself.

414
01:14:17,758 --> 01:14:19,271
God will punish you!

415
01:14:34,638 --> 01:14:37,198
In the name of God, the Beneficent,
the Merciful.

416
01:14:37,398 --> 01:14:40,549
Praise be to God,
Lord of the Worlds.

417
01:14:40,758 --> 01:14:44,353
Praise be to God,
Owner of the Day of Judgment.

418
01:14:44,718 --> 01:14:47,790
Thee alone we worship;
Thee alone we ask for help.

419
01:14:47,998 --> 01:14:50,751
Show us the straight path.
Amen.

420
01:15:51,118 --> 01:15:52,631
When the cow heads
come to us,

421
01:15:52,838 --> 01:15:55,875
we cut the horns.
After the cutting of the horns,

422
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:59,713
we throw them on the fire.

423
01:16:00,518 --> 01:16:02,349
When the hair is all singed,

424
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:05,550
we bring them down off the fire
and clean them.

425
01:16:05,878 --> 01:16:08,153
Then we roast them a second time.

426
01:16:08,558 --> 01:16:10,594
Now you have to check the heads,

427
01:16:10,798 --> 01:16:12,356
when this side's done,
turn 'em over.

428
01:16:12,558 --> 01:16:17,109
When the second side's done,
put 'em on the face, then on the cut-side...

429
01:16:17,638 --> 01:16:21,756
When that side is all done,
you take 'em out, drop 'em on the ground.

430
01:16:21,958 --> 01:16:24,950
Then you wash 'em up good.

431
01:16:25,758 --> 01:16:30,434
Then after they wash 'em,
the owner comes and carries them away.

432
01:16:30,638 --> 01:16:33,755
Where they take 'em -
is not our business anymore.

433
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:43,789
Then the owners come back
to give us our money.

434
01:16:43,998 --> 01:16:48,708
They pay us 100 naira
for washing one cow head.

435
01:16:49,078 --> 01:16:50,557
Depending on the workday...

436
01:16:50,758 --> 01:16:54,228
each of us earns
a little over 1000 naira a day.

437
01:16:54,438 --> 01:17:01,594
And after work I earn some money
on the side with my motorcycle taxi.

438
01:17:01,838 --> 01:17:03,157
That's how it is.

439
01:17:28,398 --> 01:17:33,074
5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, ten thousand naira.

440
01:17:33,358 --> 01:17:38,557
11, 12, 13 dollars...
Give me 14 dollars.

441
01:17:38,878 --> 01:17:41,950
Don't have it.
- Don't tell me that.

442
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:45,787
Don't tell me! Give me, give me!
I don't like that now!

443
01:17:46,198 --> 01:17:48,075
Alhaja, come!

444
01:17:49,638 --> 01:17:52,471
You know
how much you owe me?!

445
01:17:52,838 --> 01:17:54,635
I'll tell you!

446
01:18:37,438 --> 01:18:40,475
Go back and get your own!
There's enough back there.

447
01:18:40,678 --> 01:18:43,238
No, these are the last two.
- Stop it!

448
01:18:44,038 --> 01:18:46,916
Hey man, sit down
and cool it!

449
01:18:47,438 --> 01:18:50,032
This is mine! Let go!

450
01:18:52,558 --> 01:18:55,436
Why are you pulling?
Stop it!

451
01:18:56,918 --> 01:18:59,273
Go get a new piece!
- There's no more left.

452
01:19:35,078 --> 01:19:36,830
Make way! Make way!

453
01:19:40,318 --> 01:19:41,114
Make way!

454
01:19:42,998 --> 01:19:44,272
Make way!

455
01:20:10,558 --> 01:20:12,947
He who was born
with and through blood...

456
01:20:13,398 --> 01:20:15,958
will pass through
all forms of suffering.

457
01:20:18,718 --> 01:20:21,391
Especially if he began
life in a place...

458
01:20:21,598 --> 01:20:24,112
that has yet to learn
the meaning of civilization.

459
01:20:27,758 --> 01:20:30,147
We are born into suffering...

460
01:20:31,038 --> 01:20:34,155
because in this country
nothing is as it should be.

461
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:40,031
So everyone here
does his job patiently.

462
01:20:40,718 --> 01:20:43,755
And if God in His infinite mercy should...

463
01:20:43,958 --> 01:20:46,711
bestow us with success,

464
01:20:47,518 --> 01:20:49,156
so be it.

465
01:20:50,718 --> 01:20:54,154
Skin! Innards! Head!
Skin! Innards! Head!

466
01:21:08,278 --> 01:21:11,237
BROTHERS

467
01:21:55,878 --> 01:22:02,477
My village is a beautiful garden
where flowers of every kind grow,

468
01:22:02,678 --> 01:22:05,715
but being separated from you
causes me great pain.

469
01:22:06,158 --> 01:22:10,231
As my wayfaring friend
breathed his last breath,

470
01:22:10,438 --> 01:22:14,272
he turned his face
toward the village...

471
01:22:14,918 --> 01:22:18,957
so he could take leave of life
more easily.

472
01:22:25,478 --> 01:22:29,551
Many travelers have come,

473
01:22:29,878 --> 01:22:34,156
but you were never
among them.

474
01:22:34,878 --> 01:22:38,507
O my beloved,

475
01:22:38,718 --> 01:22:41,676
in this place full of scrap metal
and filth...

476
01:22:41,878 --> 01:22:44,711
I yearn for you so dearly.

477
01:22:45,398 --> 01:22:48,947
I beseeched the
British government,

478
01:22:49,158 --> 01:22:53,754
to stop sending ships
so that I can return to you.

479
01:22:54,718 --> 01:22:58,870
I come from far away,
let me lie beside you.

480
01:23:00,558 --> 01:23:06,269
A garden without flowers
is no garden at all.

481
01:23:06,758 --> 01:23:10,717
Here I am a stateless person,

482
01:23:12,958 --> 01:23:15,950
with empty hands.

483
01:23:17,958 --> 01:23:23,078
You have hurt me,
I am so distraught.

484
01:23:42,758 --> 01:23:46,876
Most of the workers here
are Pashtuns.

485
01:23:48,638 --> 01:23:50,629
The Pashtuns are a poor people.

486
01:23:50,998 --> 01:23:54,593
That's why they are here.

487
01:23:54,958 --> 01:23:57,518
As for me,
I've been working here 14 years,

488
01:23:57,958 --> 01:24:00,188
but only because
I have no other options.

489
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:05,509
I wouldn't be able to find
any other work.

490
01:24:07,838 --> 01:24:10,398
I came here when I was 16.

491
01:24:10,598 --> 01:24:13,715
I worked for two years and
became a master.

492
01:24:13,918 --> 01:24:15,271
Then I went home.

493
01:24:15,478 --> 01:24:17,469
I came back in 1991...

494
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:19,555
and now it's already 2004.

495
01:24:19,758 --> 01:24:22,636
In all these years
nothing has changed,

496
01:24:22,838 --> 01:24:24,396
everything is exactly
the same.

497
01:24:24,598 --> 01:24:27,112
The pay has never
really been enough.

498
01:24:27,318 --> 01:24:28,876
Neither back then,
nor today either.

499
01:24:29,078 --> 01:24:30,431
Work, work, work.

500
01:24:30,638 --> 01:24:33,994
For my entire adult life
this work is all I've ever known.

501
01:24:56,918 --> 01:24:59,955
We're like brothers to each other.

502
01:25:00,158 --> 01:25:02,194
And we have to trust each other.

503
01:25:02,438 --> 01:25:04,588
After all, we're all we've got.

504
01:25:04,798 --> 01:25:07,596
If one of our fellow workers
has a problem,

505
01:25:07,838 --> 01:25:12,787
we all get together
and see what we can do...

506
01:25:12,998 --> 01:25:18,152
and whether we can
solve the problem.

507
01:25:18,438 --> 01:25:22,033
There is never
quarreling among the workers.

508
01:25:22,238 --> 01:25:25,230
Fighting would only sap our energy,

509
01:25:25,438 --> 01:25:27,827
which is something we can't afford.

510
01:25:28,038 --> 01:25:30,711
Of course this is a shitty job,

511
01:25:31,078 --> 01:25:34,627
but even so,
we all get along well.

512
01:28:34,998 --> 01:28:37,068
God gave us this task,

513
01:28:37,278 --> 01:28:40,395
we're glad
to be able to do this at least.

514
01:28:41,078 --> 01:28:42,796
This job is death itself.

515
01:28:43,438 --> 01:28:46,555
One false step
and it's an 80-meter drop.

516
01:28:46,758 --> 01:28:48,510
Or a hunk of steel falls
on your head.

517
01:28:48,878 --> 01:28:51,597
Or the residual oil
and gases could ignite.

518
01:28:51,798 --> 01:28:53,868
Death is always with us.

519
01:28:54,198 --> 01:28:58,237
We have to defeat our fear or we
can't do this work.

520
01:28:58,438 --> 01:29:01,714
But what choice does one have?

521
01:29:01,918 --> 01:29:03,670
We stay here a whole year.

522
01:29:03,878 --> 01:29:06,836
Then maybe we get to go home
for a month or 45 days.

523
01:29:07,038 --> 01:29:09,677
Then we have to come back.
There's no way out.

524
01:29:09,878 --> 01:29:13,234
The time spent at home
always seems much too short.

525
01:29:13,438 --> 01:29:15,747
We tell our families
our jobs are very good.

526
01:29:15,958 --> 01:29:17,789
That we enjoy
working on the ships.

527
01:29:17,998 --> 01:29:20,671
But you only get work here
if you agree to anything.

528
01:29:29,598 --> 01:29:32,874
Have the workers
step back!

529
01:29:36,598 --> 01:29:38,668
Jalabe! Jalabe, you too!

530
01:30:37,798 --> 01:30:38,833
Do you want tea?

531
01:30:39,038 --> 01:30:40,756
No, thanks.

532
01:30:43,838 --> 01:30:46,068
This cap
is as good as new, look.

533
01:30:47,318 --> 01:30:49,070
Let me see,
what does it say?

534
01:30:49,278 --> 01:30:50,347
Friend.

535
01:30:50,758 --> 01:30:52,589
It says:
My Friend.

536
01:30:57,118 --> 01:30:59,268
So how are we going to cut
the next piece?

537
01:30:59,838 --> 01:31:01,066
Straight,
right?

538
01:31:02,558 --> 01:31:05,630
It doesn't matter.
From back there, straight down.

539
01:31:47,798 --> 01:31:49,914
Why don't you cut a bigger hole?

540
01:31:50,758 --> 01:31:52,908
You barely fit through.

541
01:31:58,398 --> 01:32:01,071
Greetings, my friends.
How are you?

542
01:32:01,438 --> 01:32:03,588
How much for a photo?
- 20 rupees.

543
01:32:03,798 --> 01:32:05,470
Isn't that expensive?

544
01:32:05,678 --> 01:32:08,192
That's the normal price.

545
01:32:11,038 --> 01:32:12,266
We pay in advance,
right?

546
01:32:12,478 --> 01:32:14,230
Of course.
10 rupees now...

547
01:32:14,438 --> 01:32:16,269
and 10 tomorrow
when you get the photo.

548
01:32:35,478 --> 01:32:37,355
Take off your cap.

549
01:32:40,478 --> 01:32:41,797
Excellent.

550
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:56,433
What is good and what is bad...

551
01:33:56,638 --> 01:34:00,233
is for Allah to know.

552
01:34:00,638 --> 01:34:03,869
We do our work
and the rest is in God's hands.

553
01:34:04,078 --> 01:34:06,433
If we are injured,
we are actually glad,

554
01:34:06,638 --> 01:34:10,074
or we don't mind,
because good and bad come from God.

555
01:34:10,638 --> 01:34:15,553
We fear neither injuries
nor death.

556
01:34:16,838 --> 01:34:22,276
We are born to die.

557
01:34:31,078 --> 01:34:32,272
Hurry up!

558
01:34:33,998 --> 01:34:36,148
You've been down there
for three hours!

559
01:41:33,998 --> 01:41:37,547
<i>Here live the foreman Nani Mrachman</i>
<i>and the torch cutter Omar Khan.</i>

560
01:41:37,758 --> 01:41:41,307
<i>No trespassing without their</i>
<i>express permission.</i>

561
01:41:43,678 --> 01:41:46,750
"When I think of you,

01:41:46,998 --> 01:41:48,875
"You're far away from me.

"You are a traveler, like myself.

564
01:41:54,198 --> 01:41:56,951
"Now our paths go separate ways,

565
01:41:57,158 --> 01:41:59,626
"but my heart is with you."

FUTURE

568
01:45:54,918 --> 01:45:58,593
Hard work is like a load
placed before us,

569
01:45:58,798 --> 01:46:00,595
challenging us to shoulder it.

570
01:46:01,238 --> 01:46:04,150
Some loads are light,
some heavy.

571
01:46:10,638 --> 01:46:12,788
If a man wants to succeed
in his work,

572
01:46:12,998 --> 01:46:15,592
that is, to achieve
the anticipated results,

573
01:46:16,118 --> 01:46:17,631
he must bring his ideas...

574
01:46:17,838 --> 01:46:20,147
into correspondence with the laws of...

575
01:46:20,358 --> 01:46:22,394
the objective external world.

576
01:46:22,598 --> 01:46:24,634
Otherwise he will fail
in his practice.

577
01:46:36,278 --> 01:46:39,714
The masses have
boundless creative power.

578
01:46:39,918 --> 01:46:43,706
They can organize themselves
in places and branches of work...

579
01:46:43,918 --> 01:46:47,115
where they can give full play
to their energy.

580
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:51,834
They can concentrate on production
in breadth and depth and create...

581
01:46:52,038 --> 01:46:54,871
more and more undertakings for
their own well being.

582
01:47:01,798 --> 01:47:04,870
The world is yours,
as well as ours,

583
01:47:05,078 --> 01:47:07,467
but in the last analysis,
it is yours.

584
01:47:07,718 --> 01:47:10,186
You young people,
full of vigor and vitality,

585
01:47:10,398 --> 01:47:13,071
are in the bloom of life,
like the sun...

586
01:47:13,278 --> 01:47:15,314
at eight or nine
in the morning.

587
01:47:15,798 --> 01:47:17,789
Our hope is placed on you.

588
01:47:18,718 --> 01:47:20,436
The world belongs to you.

589
01:47:20,638 --> 01:47:23,357
China's future belongs to you.

590
01:47:24,558 --> 01:47:26,469
<i>Mao Tse-tung</i>

591
01:48:41,798 --> 01:48:44,153
You can't compare
the present with the past.

592
01:48:44,358 --> 01:48:46,792
Technology has
advanced enormously.

593
01:48:47,158 --> 01:48:49,911
Today you don't need
as much muscle power.

594
01:48:51,478 --> 01:48:53,787
Today, strength alone
is not enough,

595
01:48:53,998 --> 01:48:56,068
you need know-how, too.

596
01:48:56,278 --> 01:49:02,148
I don't believe we should just
toil mindlessly as we did in the past.

597
01:49:07,598 --> 01:49:09,190
Yes, but one still
has to work.

598
01:49:09,758 --> 01:49:11,749
Of course we still have to work.

599
01:49:11,958 --> 01:49:13,550
But intelligently and
systematically -

600
01:49:13,758 --> 01:49:17,034
and at the same time
we must improve ease and efficiency.

601
01:49:17,318 --> 01:49:20,071
The work must be done
in any event...

602
01:49:20,518 --> 01:49:21,997
Yes, no way around that.

603
01:49:29,198 --> 01:49:32,634
Today we are confronted with
strong competition...

604
01:49:33,398 --> 01:49:38,267
because these days technology counts more
than the work process...

605
01:49:38,478 --> 01:49:41,197
and we are always modernizing
our machines.

606
01:49:44,118 --> 01:49:45,995
I still hope
the old furnaces...

607
01:49:46,198 --> 01:49:47,790
will be preserved as
museum pieces.

608
01:49:47,998 --> 01:49:50,432
After all, they represent
Angang history.

609
01:49:50,638 --> 01:49:55,234
The first row of blast furnaces was
left here by the Japanese.

610
01:49:58,198 --> 01:50:02,032
Half a century
has gone by since then.

611
01:50:02,358 --> 01:50:04,076
They bear
testimony of our past.

612
01:50:04,278 --> 01:50:07,714
This makes it possible
for a nation to demonstrate...

613
01:50:07,998 --> 01:50:12,116
whether or not it
has made progress.

614
01:50:23,918 --> 01:50:32,155
China has shifted from a
planned to a market economy...

615
01:50:32,758 --> 01:50:38,151
and the present situation
can no longer be compared with the old one.

616
01:50:38,718 --> 01:50:41,437
We are the older generation of
Angang workers...

617
01:50:41,638 --> 01:50:43,674
and of course we want
our children...

618
01:50:43,878 --> 01:50:45,755
to follow in our footsteps.

619
01:50:45,958 --> 01:50:50,349
We are willing to sacrifice ourselves
as the worker heroes of the past...

620
01:50:50,678 --> 01:50:54,273
in the name of the steel industry.

621
01:50:55,198 --> 01:50:58,156
But times have changed
and we have to adapt.

622
01:50:58,358 --> 01:51:01,668
We cannot decide
whether our children will do the same.

623
01:51:02,678 --> 01:51:05,272
We can't force...

624
01:51:05,478 --> 01:51:07,912
our children to take up
our professions.

625
01:51:59,158 --> 01:52:02,036
Furnaces no. 2 and 3 are
currently under construction.

626
01:52:02,278 --> 01:52:04,075
Progress is continuing steadily.

627
01:52:04,638 --> 01:52:07,198
We are competitive in the
international market.

628
01:52:07,398 --> 01:52:10,913
Looking back over the past few years,

629
01:52:11,518 --> 01:52:14,874
one can say that the
situation has improved steadily.

630
01:52:24,598 --> 01:52:28,113
All around us, the area
has grown into a modern city...

631
01:52:29,998 --> 01:52:32,193
just this place here...

632
01:52:32,398 --> 01:52:34,912
still looks the same.

633
01:52:35,118 --> 01:52:37,552
Here one can still feel the past...

634
01:52:38,318 --> 01:52:39,637
and one's own childhood.

635
01:52:39,838 --> 01:52:42,591
Sometimes my classmates and I come
here to take pictures.

636
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:45,551
We imitate the figures...

637
01:52:46,118 --> 01:52:50,111
and pose like the soldiers
and our ancestors up there.

638
01:52:50,838 --> 01:52:54,547
We think these poses look really
funny and avant-garde.

639
01:52:56,358 --> 01:52:59,316
EPILOGUE

640
01:53:18,478 --> 01:53:22,357
Duisburg-Nord Country Park, Germany

641
01:53:26,158 --> 01:53:29,468
once the Duisburg-Meiderich Steelworks

642
01:55:33,198 --> 01:55:34,597
Here molten iron flowed,

643
01:55:34,798 --> 01:55:37,392
here thousands of fires burned
in the night.

644
01:55:37,638 --> 01:55:42,393
At the Duisburg-Meiderich smelting works the
blast furnaces ran 24 hours a day,

645
01:55:42,958 --> 01:55:45,347
365 days a year.

646
01:55:45,958 --> 01:55:48,233
Here iron ore surrendered
the raw material...

647
01:55:48,438 --> 01:55:51,635
without which modern life
would be unthinkable.

648
01:55:52,718 --> 01:55:56,347
37 million tons in more than 80 years.

649
01:55:56,638 --> 01:55:58,868
From 1903 till 1985.

650
01:56:00,038 --> 01:56:02,268
Then came the last shift.

651
01:56:02,478 --> 01:56:05,197
But not the end;
rather a new beginning.

652
01:56:05,398 --> 01:56:09,516
The smelting plant was transformed
into a unique leisure park.

653
01:56:11,918 --> 01:56:15,433
When night falls in Duisburg,
the blast furnaces flare up.

654
01:56:15,638 --> 01:56:17,515
In neon green
and fantastic colors.

655
01:56:17,718 --> 01:56:20,596
ARTificial light
in the truest sense.

656
01:56:20,838 --> 01:56:23,068
The British light artist Jonathan Park...

657
01:56:23,278 --> 01:56:27,794
guides Duisburgians home
with this spectacular installation.

658
01:56:28,278 --> 01:56:31,634
Experience the glowing furnaces
live and in color -

659
01:56:31,838 --> 01:56:34,398
on weekends and holidays.

660
01:56:35,078 --> 01:56:38,957
And let yourself be guided through the
blue-green-red night.

661
01:56:40,758 --> 01:56:43,511
Have we left anyone sitting
in the dark?
