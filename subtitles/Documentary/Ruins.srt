1
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,290
Help me! Somebody help!

2
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,920
Somebody, help!

3
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,740
Help me!

4
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,450
Gin!

5
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,150
Read them and weep.

6
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,490
Finally!

7
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,200
- All right.
- You ready?

8
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,200
- War.
- War?

9
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,730
We're not playing war.
War's not even a game.

10
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,200
- We are too playing war. Come on.
- It's total chance, Stace.

11
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,970
Winner picks the game, Jeff.
That's your rules.

12
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,900
Thank you, Amy.

13
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,030
Okay. War.

14
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,540
Okay. Who wants
a little Mexican hair of the dog?

15
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,200
<i>Señorita</i> Margarita.

16
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,250
- I'll have some.
- You'll definitely have some.

17
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,410
- Come on, Jeff.
- No, keep that away from me.

18
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,850
Well, that's not what you were saying
last night.

19
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,720
Seriously, Mr. Nude Lifeguard.
What was up with that?

20
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,590
I don't know
what you guys are talking about.

21
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,660
One, two, three, four, I declare war.

22
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,200
You're burning up, honey.

23
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,270
- What do you mean?
- You're all red.

24
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,700
- No, I'm flushed. I'm just hot.
- You're not flushed.

25
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,860
- I finally won.
- Good.

26
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,370
- I knew you would.
- You did?

27
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,670
- Okay.
- I did. Of course I did.

28
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,770
- Shit!
- What?

29
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,870
I lost my earring.

30
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,420
Why don't you look
under the towel there?

31
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,580
Is it under your chair?

32
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,950
- Look under your towel.
- It's not.

33
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,560
- Under your towel.
- Why would it be under our towel?

34
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,420
- I don't know, I think I was...
- Did you come lay under here?

35
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,360
- We're gonna find it, honey.
- It's my favorite earring.

36
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,460
It's probably in the pool.

37
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,810
I found it. It's yours, I think.

38
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,240
Yeah?

39
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,070
- Thank you so much!
- Thank you.

40
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,880
It's not a problem.

41
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,540
Hey, do you want a drink?

42
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,150
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

43
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,650
It's got ice in it.

44
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,260
It's okay.

45
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,380
It's blended.

46
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,120
- That means it has ice, Eric.
- Thank you.

47
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,100
- Where are you from?
- Munich, originally.

48
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,790
Stace, it's just ice.

49
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,300
No, it's not. The water system here
is contaminated with human feces.

50
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,840
Okay? So your drinks are, like, blended
with hepatitis B. Yes. Hepatitis B.

51
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,810
How do you know each other?

52
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,430
They're best friends,
and we're their boyfriends.

53
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,670
Cool.

54
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,840
How about you?
Are you here by yourself?

55
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,750
No, with my brother,
but he left with some girl, yeah.

56
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,350
Left here? Mexico or...

57
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,950
Oh, no, no. She's an archaeologist.
He went with her to a dig site.

58
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,360
- And what are they digging?
- Like an excavation?

59
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,160
Yeah, it's ruins, I think. A Mayan temple.

60
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,630
Kind of like the ones

61
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,970
- that nobody here wanted to go to...
- Yes, Jeff.

62
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,700
...the entire time that we've been here.

63
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,900
Apparently, it's not even
in the guidebooks.

64
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,570
VIP only.

65
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,540
Yeah. See, Jeff,
that's something I would do.

66
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,540
- Oh, yeah?
- Sounds like fun.

67
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,150
Well, if you're interested,
I'm going there tomorrow.

68
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,220
Heinrich was supposed to be
back by now,

69
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,910
but he must be having a good time.

70
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,560
So what do you guys think?

71
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,060
Ancient Mayan temple
off the beaten path?

72
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,190
I don't know,
a little culture before we leave?

73
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,060
I wanna go.

74
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,230
- You will?
- Yeah.

75
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,280
Since I just kicked Jeff's ass in cards,
I got nothing left to do here.

76
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,400
Wow!

77
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,400
Wow.

78
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,880
- Wow.
- Say something.

79
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,070
Eric?

80
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,350
Well, yeah, I mean, as long as I'm back
for make-your-own-taco night, I'm in.

81
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,620
Amy?

82
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,960
Do we have to wake up early?

83
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,360
Hey, <i>malaka...</i>

84
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,640
You come to beach tonight? To party?

85
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

86
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,040
They are supposed to be
coming with me tomorrow,

87
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,480
but maybe it's a big mistake.

88
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,280
They're all fucking crazy in the head.

89
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,330
So, there was this hotel heiress
who dyed her hair blonde.

90
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,900
But the carpet didn't match the drapes.

91
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,740
So she stripped it away.

92
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,150
What is it? What's the joke?
What's so funny? I'm not...

93
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,270
You don't want to know, Mathias.

94
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,120
But the hardwood floor underneath it
was all scuffed up and dirty!

95
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,160
So she buffed it.

96
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,990
But then it was too slippery.

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,520
Who's gonna dance with me?

98
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,730
Come on. Come on.

99
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,030
I'm just not feeling this one.

100
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,300
Jeff, buddy, we got two days left.
I wanna see some moves.

101
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,380
It's just like playing the trombone.

102
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,210
Jeff used to play the trombone
in high school.

103
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,570
- Jeffrey on the trombone, nice!
- He won a prize.

104
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,080
Thank you for sharing that
with everybody.

105
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,020
Now he's gonna be a doctor.

106
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,590
And he's gonna win a prize for that.

107
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,990
Mathias!

108
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,560
Hey, the Greeks!

109
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,700
Hey, what's up? How are you?

110
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,060
Amy! Amy! No, no! No!

111
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,860
- Amy! No, no, no, no!
- Amy!

112
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,900
I'll take some. I'll take some.

113
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,700
I have her.

114
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,770
Amy, it's time to go to bed. Let's go.

115
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,110
No, I don't want to.

116
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,580
Come on.

117
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,350
All right, I'm calling it a night, guys.

118
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,430
- Good night. Give me a kiss.
- Come here.

119
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,760
- Give me a kiss.
- Stay.

120
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,090
- See you, buddy!
- Make sure she gets home.

121
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,600
- Night, Jeff!
- Okay?

122
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,100
- I'll see you guys tomorrow morning.
- All right.

123
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,290
- Yeah.
- Be good, man.

124
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,930
- My boyfriend, the rock star!
- See you, Ame.

125
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,400
- Matteo!
- Mathias.

126
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,700
Mathias.

127
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,300
Show me a German dance. Come on.

128
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,110
You want a German dance?

129
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,950
Like a waltz?

130
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,080
- Come on!
- Yeah...

131
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,280
Drag you?

132
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,620
Nobody wants to dance!

133
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,320
- You want me to dance? I can't dance.
- It's so beautiful!

134
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,720
So, how much you wanna bet
she kisses him?

135
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,420
She's freaking out 'cause Jeff's med
school is like 2,000 miles away, okay?

136
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,990
- You do a twirl.
- Okay, how much?

137
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,300
- She's not gonna kiss him.
- That's nice.

138
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,130
- Yeah, it's good, yeah?
- Yeah, how do you do that?

139
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,970
All right, you know what?

140
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,810
Oral sex. Winner receives.

141
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,240
Oral sex. Okay.

142
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,750
- All right, more of the hips.
- Use the hips. Like this.

143
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,520
Jeff's a nice guy, yeah.

144
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,750
Come here. Come here.
I wanna tell you a secret.

145
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,820
Amy!

146
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,130
Amy!

147
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,530
- Yes!
- Amy!

148
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,630
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

149
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,710
I will dance with you, okay?

150
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,750
Crazy Greeks.

151
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,990
No. The place that they went, here.

152
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,430
It's only on this old map.
It's gone from the guidebook.

153
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,200
What are you doing?

154
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:24,340
He's making a copy of the map from
the girl Heinrich met, for his friends.

155
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,040
Yes, your friends look like
they could use a map.

156
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,210
All right. Give me a couple of minutes?

157
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,450
- Rally the troops?
- Yeah. Yeah.

158
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,110
- Half an hour in the lobby?
- Yeah.

159
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,880
- Okay.
- All right.

160
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,200
Do you know
what they do to people down here

161
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,790
who don't honor their bets?

162
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,230
Bus leaves in like 15 minutes.

163
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,930
They smash their hands.

164
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,570
No, they do. They take broomsticks,

165
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,580
and they just like, whack,
smash their hands.

166
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,610
I mean, it's a true story.
It's kind of brutal, but it happens.

167
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,110
What are you gonna do?

168
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,610
- Get up! Get up!
- Come on!

169
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,080
Come on! Jeff's gonna be pissed
if we miss it.

170
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,380
The terrible wrath of Jeff,

171
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,080
followed, I'm sure, by the even more
frightening whining of Amy.

172
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,420
She's not that bad.

173
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:13,290
No, but I bet she's feeling pretty
awkward right about now, don't you?

174
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,260
Don't say anything.

175
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,960
I mean it. Not a word.

176
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,130
- Come here.
- Come on!

177
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,260
Look, be a shame
to smash these pretty little hands.

178
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,770
Will you please get in the shower?

179
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,400
Come here for a second. Come here.
Come here.

180
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,410
You know,
you're in Mexico now, <i>muchacha.</i>

181
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,410
<i>Muchacha?</i>

182
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:35,680
And you can't just lose a bet like that
and expect to walk away free.

183
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,750
How much do I owe you again?

184
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,820
I'll be quick. So quick.

185
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,790
Okay.

186
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,000
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

187
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,400
You don't sound fine, honey.

188
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,030
Hey, that's really helpful, thanks.

189
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,640
Here you go. Come on.

190
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,050
Let's get going.

191
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,480
- Maybe I shouldn't go.
- What?

192
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,990
You're gonna be back tonight.
I'll just, like, sleep until then.

193
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,660
You wanna spend
our last day sleeping?

194
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,700
I'll just hang out, like read or something.

195
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,170
Amy. Come on.

196
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,870
People come from all over the world
just to see these ruins.

197
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,210
And this one isn't even on the map.

198
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,180
I'm not taking you
to some tourist trap, honey.

199
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,680
Don't you wanna have some experience
or something to shoot,

200
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,120
other than just the beach, the pool,
the beach, the pool?

201
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,350
Well, you're already dressed.
You might as well just go without me.

202
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,120
Hey.

203
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,870
But I don't wanna go without you.

204
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,250
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah?

205
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,250
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

206
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,420
Ready?

207
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,620
What are you so happy about?

208
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,400
Watch out for that.

209
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,070
I'm sorry.

210
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,770
Wow.

211
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,670
- Amy, there's a puppy!
- Heinrich?

212
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,810
Hello?

213
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,810
- What?
- I don't know.

214
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,320
So, now what?

215
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,080
We take taxi.

216
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:57,020
- How far?
- 18 kilometers.

217
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,460
Hey, how many miles is that?

218
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,960
It's about 11. Maybe a little bit more.

219
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:07,530
Then there's a path,
which we hike for 4 kilometers.

220
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,970
2.5 miles.

221
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,800
Okay, no one said anything
about a hike.

222
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,470
Amy!

223
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,670
- Stacy!
- Come here!

224
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,470
Well, I don't see any cabs.
That's a bit of a problem.

225
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,810
What?

226
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,310
- Yeah.
- I don't know what you're saying.

227
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,020
There we go.

228
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,250
Why?

229
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,160
No, it's good. Is there a mirror?

230
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,180
How much, you drive us here?

231
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,750
No, no. This place, no good.

232
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,510
I'll drive you to pyramid.
<i>Muy grande.</i> Everybody go.

233
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,950
I take you. I take you.

234
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,120
Yes.

235
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,790
- Hey! Amy, Stace!
- Bye, puppy!

236
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,690
I wanna stay with the puppy.

237
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,690
- Let's go!
- You guys ready?

238
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,790
- We got new hats.
- Very nice.

239
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,870
- This is the taxi?
- Yeah, this is it. Come on. Let's go.

240
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,440
My pants are gonna get dirty.

241
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,640
Hey, Jeff. Can you give me some water?

242
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,950
Take a picture.

243
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,040
Take a picture.

244
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,950
- Is this it?
- Yeah, this must be.

245
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,780
How you feeling?

246
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,750
- Yeah.
- Okay.

247
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,420
Oh, my God, I'm so glad that's over.

248
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,590
You okay?

249
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,670
- My jeans are all dirty.
- Do you have a <i>teléfono?</i>

250
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,670
Thanks.

251
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,110
Bye, puppy!

252
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,910
Wait, how are we gonna get back?

253
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,720
We're gonna call him when we get out.

254
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,410
With what?
We're not gonna get a signal out here.

255
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,750
My phone should work.
It's a world phone.

256
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,260
Hello? Can you hear me now?

257
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,420
It's not funny, Eric.

258
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,360
It's like a 20-mile hike
I'm gonna do in flip-flops.

259
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,730
Eleven.

260
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,560
It's a little funny.

261
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,200
Yeah, it's working.

262
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,740
- Problem solved.
- Can I have my sunglasses?

263
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,270
Is that your brother's Jeep?

264
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,340
Yeah, it is.

265
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,680
It's not funny.

266
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,940
It's a little funny.

267
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,110
We go. Coming?

268
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,050
Yeah, yeah. Come on, let's go. Ready?

269
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,280
- Yeah.
- Come on.

270
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,250
Want a piggyback ride?

271
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,380
- No.
- No?

272
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,900
So, there was this girl who got really,
really drunk one night.

273
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,460
But she sobered up really,
really quickly.

274
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,930
Who is this?

275
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,300
Just the stupid game
that they were playing last night.

276
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,430
But not before she stuck
her tongue down some guy's throat.

277
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,740
Eric.

278
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,540
How much further is it?

279
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,610
We cross a stream,
then there should be a path to the left.

280
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,450
If we seen a village,
then we've gone too far.

281
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,820
Wait, there's a village?

282
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,720
Yeah. A Mayan village.

283
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,820
Why did we leave the hotel again?

284
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,770
Whoa!

285
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,600
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

286
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,400
Just almost fell.

287
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,240
- Fucking stinks.
- Whoa.

288
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,640
You stink.

289
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,140
- How much further past the stream is it?
- You're funny.

290
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,110
Right after, it says.

291
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,110
Yeah, well, I don't see any path.

292
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,250
Can I have some... Thanks.

293
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,120
My legs are sore.

294
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,530
Look!

295
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,090
Don't scare them.

296
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,690
I'm not gonna scare them. Hello!

297
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,810
They look sad.

298
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,610
Hello?

299
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,310
- You guys wanna go talk to them?
- Yeah.

300
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,580
Maybe they can guide us.

301
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,220
I don't think they speak Spanish.

302
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,520
Look.

303
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,820
Where's he going?

304
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,360
It's here. This must be it.

305
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,900
That's the path?

306
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,400
Why was it covered?

307
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,560
I don't think that's the right path.

308
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,110
- It's on the map?
- Yeah.

309
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,270
It's on the map.

310
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,880
Jeff, do you see how old
that map looks?

311
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,910
And it was covered.
Why would it be covered?

312
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,280
Maybe the archaeologists don't want
people to find their site, guys.

313
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,680
Great. They're gonna be thrilled
to see us then.

314
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,350
No, maybe they just found something
valuable, you know,

315
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,440
and they don't want people to rob it,

316
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,460
and just get the Mayans
to keep people away.

317
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,220
- How far away is it?
- It's not far.

318
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,760
- Just feels weird.
- Well, what do you wanna do?

319
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,730
Just turn around
and walk all the way back?

320
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,950
A hidden path
in the middle of the jungle.

321
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,990
So, do you think
those kids were Mayans?

322
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,260
I mean, aren't the Mayans extinct?

323
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,600
Didn't they die
of some fucked up disease?

324
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,770
That's great, Eric.

325
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,810
We could be walking through
an ancient graveyard right now.

326
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,640
Like a bone depository or something.

327
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,470
- I doubt it.
- Yeah, I doubt it.

328
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,170
Did you just mimic me?

329
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,980
No, no, I was agreeing with you.

330
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,250
He was totally mimicking you.

331
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,010
Was I? Was I really?

332
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,310
Wow.

333
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,480
Oh, wow.

334
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,500
- Finally!
- I think this is it.

335
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,120
See, honey?

336
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,160
Wow.

337
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,930
- It's beautiful.
- It is.

338
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,160
- Can I have my glasses?
- Yeah.

339
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,000
- Aren't you glad you came?
- Here.

340
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,280
Look, that's it.

341
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,610
Well, we made it.

342
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,240
Can I have a drink? Thank you.

343
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,050
Hey, Stace.

344
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,350
Mexico!

345
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,820
I know I'm a dork.

346
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,220
Mathias?

347
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,060
Is that a tent?

348
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,220
Where?

349
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,230
Up there in the corner.

350
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,560
Good job!

351
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,920
Heinrich!

352
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,360
Maybe he wants some money.

353
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,450
What, like a toll or something?

354
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,970
Amy. Stop.

355
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:13,750
What the fuck do they want?

356
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,050
Show a picture of your brother.

357
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,590
On the phone.

358
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,820
Wait.

359
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,130
- We're trying to find...
- You seen him?

360
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,420
- Ame, don't move!
- Stop!

361
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,930
- Amy! Amy!
- Okay.

362
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,260
Don't move. Just don't move.

363
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,420
- Give to them! Give to them <i>fotografía!</i>
- Jeff!

364
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:58,970
- Give to me camera.
- Ame, don't move!

365
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,190
Hey!

366
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,870
- What the hell was that?
- Dimitri.

367
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,540
Want the camera?

368
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,040
Easy. Easy, just...

369
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,880
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

370
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,540
Stop!

371
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,030
- Amy! Amy!
- Oh, God!

372
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,360
Jeff!

373
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:36,900
Heinrich!

374
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,940
I need to stop.

375
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,410
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
- Stace. Stace. Look at me.

376
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,210
- I can't breathe.
- Stacy! Look at me!

377
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,350
Come on, we gotta go! Come on!

378
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,190
There's more coming!

379
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,430
Heinrich!

380
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,580
Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

381
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,180
Oh, my God, Dimitri!

382
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,410
Oh, my God.

383
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,190
Why would they do that?

384
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,850
I can't breathe.

385
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,930
Eric, get your phone out.

386
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,360
There's no signal.

387
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,730
Really? Because if there was a signal
on the road you should be able to...

388
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,710
- No, I didn't get one.
- What do you mean?

389
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,370
- No, I mean, I never said...
- "Can you hear me now?"

390
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,600
- What the fuck was that, Eric?
- What the fuck? It was a joke!

391
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,310
Stop! Stop! Both of you, stop! Please!

392
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,280
Mathias had a signal.

393
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,610
Where's your phone?

394
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,880
The man. He took it.

395
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,830
Is it the dig?

396
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,330
Heinrich?

397
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,510
Maybe there's another way down.

398
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,700
Heinrich?

399
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,000
My God...

400
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,010
Heinrich!

401
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,780
Oh, shit.

402
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,020
Oh, Jesus.

403
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,740
I'm sorry.

404
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,260
They keep coming.

405
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,120
They're setting up camps.

406
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,730
Why are they doing this?

407
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,960
Jesus Christ, they killed them both.

408
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:55,530
I mean what about the girl.
What happened to her?

409
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,470
- The one that Heinrich...
- Just stop it, Eric.

410
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,700
I mean, is she okay? Is she even here?
What happened?

411
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:02,800
Just stop it okay. Stop talking.

412
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,640
- Give the water, Amy.
- What happened?

413
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,950
It's the plant.

414
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,710
He's having some sort of
allergic reaction to it.

415
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,810
Why are they doing this?

416
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,480
Maybe they're preparing for something.

417
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,180
Like a sacrifice.

418
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,300
It has something to do with the ruins.

419
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,260
They won't come up here.
Now that we're here,

420
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,830
they won't let us leave.

421
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,960
So, what do we do,
just wait for someone to find us?

422
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,160
Who?

423
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,970
The Greeks.

424
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,980
Dimitri left them a copy of the map
before we left.

425
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,040
Yeah, and what if they decide
not to come, Jeff?

426
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,160
Then somebody else will.

427
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,350
We're supposed to check out
of the hotel tomorrow.

428
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:52,390
The hotel's gonna call the police.

429
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,550
When?

430
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,960
Tomorrow or the day after.

431
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,700
- Our flight is tomorrow, Jeff.
- I know, Amy.

432
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,170
But we know what happens if we leave.

433
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,570
Yeah, but what are we gonna eat?
Like, where do we sleep?

434
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,680
We should save this.

435
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,300
Hey, she's thirsty.

436
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:13,470
I know. We just don't have that much.

437
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:17,350
Well, why do you get to decide, Jeff?

438
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,390
Okay. Well, we can all decide.

439
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,510
But just keep in mind that each of us
needs a half a gallon of water

440
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,860
every day, just to survive.

441
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,090
And right now,
we don't even have a day's worth.

442
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,000
Maybe he's right.

443
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,200
What is that?

444
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,500
Hold on.

445
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:40,780
A cell phone?

446
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,040
A cell phone?

447
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,740
- Heinrich's.
- Are you sure?

448
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,680
Yeah, it's his ringtone.
We had the same phone.

449
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,580
How can there be a signal?
There's not a signal up here.

450
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,410
It's definitely a phone.

451
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,390
Amy, in the orange tent,
there's a lantern hanging

452
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,720
and some matches on the ground.
Can you get them?

453
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,880
Eric?

454
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,050
- Eric.
- Yeah.

455
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,690
- Come figure this out. Drop that there.
- Okay.

456
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,100
Come on. Amy? All right, pull it now.

457
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,530
This thing needs to be off, right?

458
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,190
Come on.

459
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,940
Okay, okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

460
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,740
- You got it?
- Yeah, that's it. Let's do this.

461
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,280
- Okay.
- Sure? You ready?

462
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,370
Yeah.

463
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,030
- Jeff? Jeff?
- Yeah?

464
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,840
The rope, I think...

465
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,670
- Whoa. Up, up, up!
- Wait, wait, wait!

466
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:53,440
- Pull it up! Up!
- Pull him up! Hurry!

467
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,610
- What?
- Hurry!

468
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,310
What is it? What?

469
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,980
Oh, shit.

470
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,950
Mathias!

471
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,490
- Mathias?
- Mathias?

472
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,530
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus Christ.

473
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,700
- Oh, Jesus. Fuck. Fuck.
- Oh, my God.

474
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,000
Is he...

475
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,870
No, I can hear him.

476
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,840
One of you has to go.

477
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,380
Go? Go where?

478
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,250
Down. We're gonna check
the rest of the rope

479
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,750
and make sure it's secure.
And then one of you can...

480
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:34,190
Why do we have to go?
Why can't you or Eric?

481
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,590
'Cause you're not strong enough.

482
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,660
We need to work the crank.

483
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,160
I'll go.

484
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,670
- You will?
- Yeah.

485
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,330
Let me check.

486
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,240
Thank you.

487
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,180
Just help him into the sling,
and then we're gonna pull him out.

488
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,280
Once we get him out,

489
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,050
we're gonna drop the rope
and pull you back up, okay?

490
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,630
- Stace?
- Yeah?

491
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,190
- You okay?
- Yeah.

492
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,530
Hey. You okay?

493
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,790
Yep.

494
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,900
Here you go.

495
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,100
- Stace, you gotta step off.
- We got you.

496
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,270
Okay.

497
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,510
- Okay?
- Okay.

498
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,180
You got it?

499
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,190
Stacy?

500
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,520
What?

501
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,290
It's the end of the rope!

502
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,800
I'm not at the bottom!

503
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,730
How much further is it?

504
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,930
Can you jump?

505
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,510
Can I what?

506
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,080
Can you jump?

507
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,440
Please. Help me.

508
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,810
Okay.

509
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,420
Stace?

510
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:00,760
You okay?

511
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,540
I cut my knee!

512
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,150
Can you see Mathias?

513
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,110
Yeah, but it's dark!

514
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,620
We're gonna send the matches down.

515
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,990
Hurry!

516
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,620
Come on. Think.

517
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,320
What can we use?

518
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,460
What about the tents?

519
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,840
You know, we could take one down,
cut the nylon into strips.

520
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,720
I'm scared.

521
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,090
I can't move my legs.

522
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,000
You guys?

523
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:11,060
You guys, I think he broke his back!
He can't move his legs!

524
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,730
And it smells!

525
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,530
Like what?

526
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,940
Like shit!

527
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,910
We're gonna have to build a backboard.

528
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,780
No way. We can't move him.

529
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,440
Look, we are not
leaving him down there, okay?

530
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,450
How about the backpack frames
and the tent poles?

531
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,560
Are you listening to yourself?
Okay, this is insane.

532
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,180
We have to wait for help, okay?

533
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,760
Stacy, we have to build a backboard!

534
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,460
Okay.

535
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,590
Amy, there's tape in the tent.

536
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,630
Jeff, we cannot move someone
with a broken back, okay?

537
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,570
- Amy, we have no choice.
- You know that!

538
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,440
You have to go down
and help lift him on!

539
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,560
No.

540
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,200
- We have to tell them.
- Tell who?

541
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:54,080
We have to tell them.
Maybe they could call someone.

542
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,240
They can send for help.

543
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,840
Amy, they're not gonna send for help.

544
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,950
No, we have to try, Jeff.

545
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,620
Amy. Amy! Amy!

546
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,680
Amy!

547
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,630
Amy.

548
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,800
Amy! Ame.

549
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,980
Help us, please.

550
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,040
We need your help.

551
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,310
Someone's been hurt.

552
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,820
Amy, they can't understand you.

553
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:38,120
Say it in Spanish.

554
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,490
They don't speak Spanish, Ame.

555
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,960
- Just try!
- Ame.

556
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,660
Amy, they've already killed Dimitri.

557
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,240
I know you're scared.

558
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,500
I didn't want to come.

559
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,540
- Look at me. Amy. It's gonna be okay.
- I said I...

560
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,040
- I shouldn't be here.
- We're gonna get out of this.

561
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,480
Okay? Ame?

562
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,710
Please.

563
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,750
- They have to help us.
- Ame.

564
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,180
They have to. No, they have to!

565
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,720
Ame, Ame! Amy!

566
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,190
I don't want us to get shot, Ame. Please.

567
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,860
- Why won't you fucking help us?
- Ame!

568
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,760
- Why won't you fucking help us?
- Ame!

569
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,770
Ame. Ame.

570
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,400
His mother was right there.

571
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,870
He touched the vine.

572
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,810
We all have.

573
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,150
Stacy?

574
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,880
Can you see it?

575
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,270
Is there anyone there?

576
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,010
I can't see it!

577
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,280
I wanna come back up!

578
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,260
- Okay.
- Okay.

579
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,800
- You okay?
- Yeah.

580
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,970
All right, let's go.

581
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,940
Stace, I'm coming down!

582
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,830
A few more feet!

583
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:35,160
That's all there is!

584
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,530
- We have to send it back up.
- No, no.

585
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:41,340
Amy, I can't stay down here any longer.

586
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,540
We can just lift him.

587
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,840
One of us at his shoulders,
the other person at his feet.

588
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,010
What if he twists?

589
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,550
It's only a couple of feet, Amy.
We can just lift him.

590
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,860
Can you still do it, Ame?

591
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,690
Okay!

592
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,660
I'm gonna try!

593
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,030
Mathias.

594
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,370
- Mathias, we're gonna lift you, okay?
- Okay.

595
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:15,200
We're gonna lift you up and out of here.

596
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,950
Okay.

597
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,750
- His hips.
- Are you sure?

598
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:29,880
If you lift him at the feet
he's gonna bend at the waist.

599
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:34,050
Yeah, but I lift him here from his hips,
it's gonna arch his back.

600
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,900
His knees.

601
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,930
Okay, quickly. On three, okay?

602
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,060
One, two, three!

603
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,840
Oh, my! Oh, my God!

604
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,440
Just get him on!

605
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,960
Pull him up!

606
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,650
Maybe we should carry him into the tent.

607
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,990
Squeeze my hand.

608
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:41,650
So he's not cold.

609
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,790
I don't think we should move him again.

610
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,130
Yeah, but we can't leave him out
in the open like this at night.

611
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,000
Let's see if we can find him
some aspirin or something, okay?

612
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:58,040
To keep his blood moving. Guys?

613
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:04,840
Look in the tents. Check the backpacks.
See what you guys can find.

614
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,370
Guys?

615
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,670
Guys?

616
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:35,610
Look. Dimitri's plane ticket.

617
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,080
How does that help us?

618
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,950
He was supposed to leave
tomorrow morning.

619
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,580
On a 7:05 flight.

620
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,280
So when he doesn't show up tomorrow,

621
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,290
his friends are definitely gonna know
that something's wrong.

622
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,720
How will they know where we are?

623
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:51,060
They have the map.
Dimitri copied the map for them.

624
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,870
So they'll be here tomorrow.

625
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:59,240
We just have to make it through tonight.
That's it.

626
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:04,470
Maybe one of us should keep watch
while the other guys sleep.

627
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,740
Sleep?

628
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,920
It's working.

629
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,500
How is he?

630
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,430
We gotta keep his legs clean.

631
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,330
That's how it'll happen if it does.

632
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,610
If what does?

633
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,780
If he dies here.

634
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:47,290
Infection.

635
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,420
Jeff, he's not gonna die.

636
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:55,690
- Ame?
- Yeah?

637
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,790
I never should've said to lift him up,
should I?

638
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,160
I never should have said to lift him.

639
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,860
- Don't, Stace. Please.
- It's my fault.

640
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,630
Stace?

641
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,210
We're gonna get him
to the hospital tomorrow, okay?

642
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,280
He's gonna be okay.

643
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,470
Okay?

644
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:19,320
We just gotta rest.

645
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,320
Come on, Stace.

646
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:26,480
The Greeks will be here tomorrow.

647
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:28,060
Stace, come on.

648
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,140
Give me your hand.

649
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,360
Come closer.

650
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,680
- Eric!
- What?

651
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,590
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

652
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,750
- Eric!
- What?

653
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:21,260
- Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!
- Okay, okay.

654
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,690
Oh, my God. It's inside my leg.

655
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,560
Get it out! Get it out! Get it out!

656
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,190
- Get it out, get it out, get it out!
- Okay, okay.

657
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,600
Okay. Okay.

658
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,170
Oh, my God!

659
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:34,200
Okay, okay, okay.

660
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,710
Get it out.

661
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,040
What happened?

662
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,770
Help me.

663
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,610
Something's wrong.

664
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,880
Please. Something's wrong.

665
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:50,050
It's okay.

666
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,850
- Moving! I can feel it moving!
- Stop! No. I got it out!

667
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,390
- It's moving!
- Stace. What?

668
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:54,520
The vine, it was inside her.

669
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:57,520
- Show me my legs.
- Okay.

670
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:59,430
- Show me them!
- Okay.

671
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:02,360
Jeff!

672
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:05,570
- Jeff!
- Help me, please!

673
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,800
- Get it off me! Get it off!
- Jeff!

674
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:13,570
Help me!

675
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,810
Help me! Help me!

676
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:18,280
Take them off me!

677
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:21,750
Mathias! You just sit there and breathe.

678
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,820
Breathe, Mathias.

679
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:28,400
I'm gonna make a tourniquet right now.
I'm gonna cut off this bleeding, Mathias.

680
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,260
It's on our clothes.

681
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:34,890
It's... It's growing on us.

682
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:46,770
The phone.

683
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:57,080
I don't know how long these'll burn,
so you're gonna have to be quick.

684
00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:00,320
I'd wait to light them
till you're both down there.

685
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:03,620
Link arms. One of you look to the right,
the other, your left.

686
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:06,530
You'll cover more ground that way.

687
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:09,970
Search a spot and then move on. Okay?

688
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:42,190
Okay!

689
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,340
Okay.

690
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:09,220
Be careful.

691
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:23,370
Okay.

692
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,050
Amy, wait, wait.

693
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,450
Come on. We have to find it.

694
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,760
Just stay next to me.

695
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:01,010
Amy?

696
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:07,280
- That's where it's coming from.
- I can't.

697
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:10,190
- Come on.
- I don't wanna go in there. Amy.

698
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,020
We have to.

699
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:15,660
We have to find it.

700
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,630
It's okay, come on.

701
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,040
Okay.

702
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:37,620
Okay. Ame?

703
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,970
Hello?

704
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:12,020
Oh, my God.

705
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,820
The phone.

706
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:26,870
- It was just ringing.
- Let me see.

707
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:28,900
Yeah. It's cracked.

708
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:44,610
Amy.

709
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:14,880
Amy! Amy!

710
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,950
Oh, my God!

711
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:24,220
Go!

712
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,890
Run, Stace! Go!

713
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:38,300
Amy!

714
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,910
Amy!

715
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:54,440
Jump on!

716
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,120
Pull us up! Pull it up!

717
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:58,320
Pull!

718
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,130
Go!

719
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,030
Come on!

720
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:12,800
Come on!

721
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,300
- Are you okay, Ame?
- Get it off!

722
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:18,470
Did you find the phone, Amy?

723
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,570
- It's not a phone!
- Amy!

724
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:22,010
No, there is no fucking phone!

725
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:25,310
What happened?
Stace, what happened?

726
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:34,930
What do you mean,
the flower was making the ring?

727
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,430
It was vibrating
and it was ringing like a cell phone.

728
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,760
How? Amy, how does it do that?

729
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,900
I don't know, Eric. I don't know.

730
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:46,670
It was moving. It was alive.
It knows we're here.

731
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:48,100
We just have to go.
We have to go. We just...

732
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,830
We can't do that, Stace.

733
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:53,740
Jeff, you didn't see it. Okay?

734
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,340
I'm not staying here.

735
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:59,940
If we try to leave, they kill us.

736
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:04,450
Mathias can't move.
I can't just leave him here.

737
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:10,020
Okay, maybe we don't all have to go.
I mean, I could go. I can get help.

738
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,860
They have guns, Eric.

739
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:17,460
There are 50 of them, 60.
They killed that little kid, Amy.

740
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,300
Okay, so you guys make a distraction.

741
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,460
I can make it to the Jeep.

742
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:22,300
- I can do it.
- It's too dangerous, Eric.

743
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,810
- We have to wait.
- Wait for what, huh?

744
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:27,440
For the Greeks.

745
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,550
Jeff, the Greeks can't find
their own fucking hotel room.

746
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:30,710
- Eric.
- They're not gonna come out here

747
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:33,950
- and rescue us.
- We're being quarantined here.

748
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:36,320
We are being kept here to die!

749
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,250
This doesn't happen!

750
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:43,060
Four Americans on a vacation
don't just disappear!

751
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,170
Somebody,

752
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:54,140
the police, our parents,

753
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:57,900
the Greeks,

754
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:00,640
somebody,

755
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:03,110
somebody is going to find us.

756
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:06,190
We just have to be alive when they do.

757
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:15,590
Where are those keys, Amy?

758
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:19,130
- Amy, where are the keys?
- They're in the backpack.

759
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:23,230
No. We stay close.
We wait until we're found.

760
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,240
We keep someone always on guard.
We keep our wounds covered.

761
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:30,800
And we look out after each other.
That is the only way.

762
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:35,340
Somebody's coming.

763
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:38,580
Somebody's coming.

764
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,840
One swallow apiece.

765
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,980
Stace.

766
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,990
It's still in there. I can feel it.

767
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,690
See, look how puffy it is.

768
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,390
That's just swelling. It's natural.

769
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:04,100
It's just what happens
when you cut yourself, okay?

770
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,730
He won't last much longer like this.

771
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:12,840
- We have to cut them off.
- Cut what off?

772
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:18,940
- His legs.
- Tell me you're joking.

773
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:24,580
- He'll die if we don't.
- Just please tell me you're joking.

774
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:28,180
He'll get infected, if he isn't already.
Septicemia.

775
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,730
Well, what the hell is septicemia, Jeff?

776
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:35,860
An infection, usually in the bones,
when it's exposed to bacteria.

777
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,630
You're fucking crazy.

778
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:41,070
No, I'm telling you,
he won't last through the day like this.

779
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:42,970
Without anesthesia?

780
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:46,750
He has no feeling beneath his waist.

781
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:49,320
The tourniquets are already in place.
We're gonna cut below them.

782
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:50,810
With what?

783
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:55,680
A knife?

784
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:00,590
We have to break the bones first
and then cut.

785
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:03,360
Well, we're not cutting his legs off
with a fucking hunting knife, Jeff.

786
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,190
There's no flesh
covering his bones, Eric.

787
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:08,160
He is going to die.

788
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:15,610
Okay. Okay, fine. Let's fucking vote.

789
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:19,510
You know, raise your hands
if you want to cut off his legs.

790
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:29,180
Stacy, what are you doing?

791
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,190
He's in med school, Eric.

792
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,620
Yeah. Yeah, he's in med school.

793
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:36,820
He's not a surgeon. He's not a doctor.
He's in school.

794
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:38,800
I'm entitled to my vote, Eric.

795
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,460
You do it.

796
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,390
Cut them off.

797
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,360
Cut them off.

798
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,210
Yeah.

799
00:59:56,950 --> 01:00:01,320
I'll break the bones first, with the stone,
then use the knife to cut through.

800
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:02,580
Okay.

801
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,490
We're heating the pan to cauterize
the wounds to stop the bleeding.

802
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:08,320
You're not gonna be able to feel a thing,

803
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:13,330
but if you want to bite down on this,

804
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:15,490
you can, just in case.

805
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:19,000
Eric, you ready?

806
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,540
You should wait in the tent.

807
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:49,530
Grab his feet.

808
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,930
That foot. Turn it up.

809
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:35,610
Hold him down! Eric! Eric!

810
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,010
God!

811
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:48,420
Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!

812
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:53,560
It's okay.

813
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:55,230
- Eric!
- Jeff!

814
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:57,400
Hold him fucking still!

815
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:21,720
Jeff!

816
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,300
Jeff, he felt it, didn't he?

817
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,630
Jeff!

818
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:33,370
- He has nerve damage.
- Yeah.

819
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:36,170
He can't feel anything
beneath his waist.

820
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,470
He was screaming, Jeff.

821
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:39,170
He was screaming.
He was telling you to stop.

822
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,340
He was screaming. How could
he not feel it when he was screaming?

823
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:43,640
It's just the visual.

824
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:46,840
- It was him looking down and seeing it.
- This is so not okay!

825
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:49,220
We didn't have a choice, Amy.

826
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,330
Amy. It's...

827
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,330
Oh, my God. Holy shit.

828
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:00,090
Oh, God.

829
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:01,720
What the fuck.

830
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,670
Look, how can it do that?

831
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:34,860
Check your phone.

832
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:41,210
Let me see.

833
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:58,010
I just wanna go home.

834
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:24,020
Do you think Stacy's gonna be okay?

835
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:31,430
Yeah.

836
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:35,770
I mean, I got it out. I saw it come out.

837
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:40,600
Yeah, she just really believes...

838
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,580
You know how she is.

839
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,780
She gets something in her head and...

840
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:55,790
she convinces herself.

841
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:11,970
Do you think that
they're ever gonna find us?

842
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,470
Honestly?

843
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,810
I think making a run for it
is our only chance.

844
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:29,980
I know.

845
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,630
Amy, come here, come here.

846
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,810
Eric.

847
01:06:58,490 --> 01:07:00,250
What the fuck?

848
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,020
What?

849
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,920
I heard you.

850
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:06,620
- You heard me what?
- I heard you fucking her.

851
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:07,860
Excuse me?

852
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,800
- Don't lie to me, Eric. I heard you.
- Stace.

853
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:12,960
I heard you. I heard you fucking her!

854
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,130
Stacy, come on.

855
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,370
How could you do that to me?

856
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:19,810
How could you guys fucking sit there
and fuck when I'm in the tent?

857
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,880
Stace, you need to calm down.

858
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:23,950
Don't tell me what I should do.

859
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:25,380
Stacy, you know I wouldn't do that.

860
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,140
- I heard you, Eric.
- We were just talking. I was just...

861
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:31,550
- I heard you moaning, Amy.
- I was crying, Stacy.

862
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:34,560
- What's going on?
- My boyfriend is fucking your girlfriend!

863
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:37,180
- That's what's going on.
- She's just crazy and irrational.

864
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:40,660
- You think she's never cheated on you?
- Stacy.

865
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:44,030
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you, bitch!

866
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:46,730
Fuck you! All you ever cared about
is your fucking self!

867
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:49,670
- Stacy, stop it.
- Don't fucking touch me!

868
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:52,400
Relax. You're scared.

869
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:56,140
She would've slept with Mathias
if I hadn't stopped her.

870
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:01,180
Mathias.

871
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,790
Well, thank God we cut his legs off.

872
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:50,230
Shut up.

873
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,300
It's eating me like it's eating him.

874
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:02,210
- Stace.
- No. It's inside. It's inside of me.

875
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:03,780
Stacy.

876
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:06,970
It's in my side, Amy. It's in my... It's...

877
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:11,650
I'll show you. It's here.
If you just cut here and here...

878
01:09:11,790 --> 01:09:12,780
- Stacy.
...and here.

879
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:15,320
- Stacy.
- Stacy, you're okay.

880
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:17,050
- You're okay.
- You're not listening!

881
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,150
- Stacy, you're fine.
- You're not listening!

882
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:21,490
You are not listening!

883
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:23,830
You're not listening to me!

884
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:45,820
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>

885
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,360
What the fuck?

886
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:52,290
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>

887
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,420
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>

888
01:09:57,530 --> 01:09:59,590
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>

889
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:11,810
They don't want us to spread it.
That's why they won't let us leave.

890
01:10:15,490 --> 01:10:17,510
They're salting the soil

891
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:24,530
to keep it contained.

892
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:36,600
It's old. It has to be. Really old.

893
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:41,770
Because the birds, the insects,

894
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:45,280
somehow they've learned
not to land here.

895
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:50,940
And the horses. Remember?
How frightened the horses were?

896
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:52,780
It didn't happen.

897
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,190
What she said about Mathias.

898
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:03,930
- I didn't...
- You don't have to say anything.

899
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:05,400
But I do.

900
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,130
- Because I don't want you to...
- Amy.

901
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:14,870
Look at us.

902
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:23,550
Would it matter to you?

903
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:32,090
Guys?

904
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:37,770
Show them.

905
01:11:55,690 --> 01:11:57,150
- Okay. Stace.
- I didn't mean to.

906
01:11:57,290 --> 01:11:59,780
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I know.

907
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:03,450
We're gonna start with the one
in your leg. Okay, Stace?

908
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:10,520
It's okay.

909
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:16,130
I'm sorry.

910
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:20,040
- It's okay.
- You might wanna close your eyes.

911
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:23,980
I wanna see. I wanna see it.

912
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:35,020
Stacey, keep breathing, okay?

913
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,920
Through your nose.

914
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:40,360
Good. Just keep breathing,
keep breathing.

915
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:43,190
Keep breathing.
Keep breathing. Keep breathing.

916
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:46,570
- Okay. Okay. All right, he's almost done.
- I got it.

917
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:50,740
It's okay.

918
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:53,330
Okay?

919
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:56,110
Should I stop?
Stacy, do you want me to stop?

920
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:57,340
No.

921
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:09,680
- I'm scared. No.
- It's okay. Keep breathing.

922
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,790
Okay, okay.

923
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:16,930
Okay, okay.

924
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:25,910
It's almost out.

925
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,340
No! Oh, no!

926
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:33,880
Oh, my God!

927
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:36,850
Okay, it's okay.

928
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:39,720
- He got all of it.
- The shirt up.

929
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:42,090
Hold the other one.

930
01:13:42,230 --> 01:13:44,720
It's okay. I'm here.

931
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,930
Please.

932
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:18,460
Stace.

933
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:22,460
There's more of it. There's more.

934
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:27,760
Right here. Under. Under the muscle,
like by the bone there.

935
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:29,670
There's nothing there, Stacy.

936
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:33,770
- Yes, can we cut it?
- There's no more cutting.

937
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:36,570
I wanna cut it. I wanna cut it.

938
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:37,940
- I wanna cut it. I wanna...
- Hey, don't!

939
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:41,750
Hey! You can't. You can't keep cutting.

940
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:45,750
- It's just everywhere. It's in my head.
- No.

941
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:48,120
- It's okay. You're okay.
- No, no.

942
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:52,090
- Yeah, you're okay.
- No, no. I'm not okay. I'm not okay.

943
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:57,160
You keep saying I'm okay. I'm not okay.
Why do you keep saying that to me?

944
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:03,710
Here, this might help.

945
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,790
What? What?

946
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:34,330
Amy, did you see it?
You saw it, didn't you?

947
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:37,460
You saw it in my head. I felt it.

948
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:38,730
Amy.

949
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:42,980
Amy, please tell me.

950
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,670
- Stacy.
- Why won't you look at me?

951
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:47,310
Stacy, Stacy...

952
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:49,510
- You saw it?
- It's okay.

953
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:52,750
- You saw it? Did you see it?
- No, I... There's nothing there.

954
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:55,410
There's nothing there, okay? I swear.

955
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:58,220
It's in my head. I feel it, you guys.

956
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:08,900
- Let's move her in the tent.
- Okay.

957
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:13,570
No one's coming. I'm going tonight.

958
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:23,480
<i>I wanna cut it.</i>

959
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:52,410
<i>I wanna cut it. I wanna cut it.</i>

960
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:59,640
<i>I wanna cut it. I wanna cut it.</i>
<i>I wanna cut it.</i>

961
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,170
Stacy, what are you doing?

962
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:32,340
Oh, my God!

963
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:40,550
It's okay. It's okay.

964
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:43,590
I just... I just have to get this one out.

965
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:46,090
It's okay.

966
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:51,600
Just have to get this one.

967
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,470
- Stacy?
- No. No.

968
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,870
- Stacy, give it to me.
- No. No.

969
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,870
- Give it to me right now.
- No!

970
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:04,410
Jeff?

971
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,140
I'm very sorry.

972
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,580
- I have to get this piece right here...
- Stacy.

973
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:12,750
...in my...
- Stacy, give me the knife. Stacy.

974
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:14,920
Stacy, give me the knife, okay?

975
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:16,720
Don't touch me!

976
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:31,130
Easy, stay down.

977
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:33,470
Eric! Eric!

978
01:19:35,010 --> 01:19:36,910
- Eric!
- Oh, my God!

979
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,440
Stay down.

980
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:42,110
Eric! Eric!

981
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:48,850
Eric! Amy!

982
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,360
Come here. Come here.

983
01:19:51,490 --> 01:19:54,160
Amy! Eric! Eric!

984
01:19:57,630 --> 01:19:59,860
Eric! Amy! Amy!

985
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:07,540
Amy, I didn't mean to! I'm sorry!

986
01:20:08,910 --> 01:20:10,140
It hurts.

987
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:11,870
- It's okay.
- I didn't mean to!

988
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:15,680
- Stacy.
- Eric! Eric! It hurts.

989
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:17,550
Don't move. Don't move.

990
01:20:17,690 --> 01:20:19,020
Eric?

991
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:24,150
Eric? Eric? Eric!

992
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,620
Eric? Eric?

993
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,120
No! No.

994
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:31,660
No! No!

995
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:35,640
- Eric! Eric!
- Come here. Come here.

996
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:39,640
Eric! Eric! Eric!

997
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:44,840
Stacy.

998
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:50,410
- Amy. Amy, it hurts.
- No.

999
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,660
- No. No.
- It hurts.

1000
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,390
Kill me. Amy, kill me.

1001
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:03,730
Amy.

1002
01:21:04,970 --> 01:21:08,030
Kill me. Kill me!

1003
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:09,730
- Jeff.
- Amy!

1004
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:14,210
- Kill me! Kill me!
- It's okay.

1005
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:16,010
Stace.

1006
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:17,940
You have to, Amy.

1007
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:21,380
Kill me! Amy!

1008
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:25,050
- Yes! Kill me! Kill me. Kill me!
- No!

1009
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:28,060
- <i>Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!</i>
- Amy.

1010
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:41,600
Jeff.

1011
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,410
Kill me!

1012
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:50,910
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!

1013
01:22:08,030 --> 01:22:10,260
Once you're past the clearing,

1014
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:16,800
you run as fast as you can, okay?

1015
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:21,940
Okay?

1016
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:29,680
When you get to the Jeep,

1017
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:41,000
you don't wait for anything. Anything.

1018
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:47,160
And if these don't work, then you run,

1019
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:51,970
and you don't stop
until you reach the town.

1020
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:59,240
You promise me that you'll still be here?

1021
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:03,550
Okay.

1022
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:09,550
You don't even know her name.

1023
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:19,590
You don't know any of our names.

1024
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:37,280
I'm Jeff. Jeff Dean MacIntyre.

1025
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:40,480
Winnetka, Illinois.

1026
01:24:43,890 --> 01:24:45,680
Twenty-two years old.

1027
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:51,250
I was gonna be a doctor.
That was my dream.

1028
01:24:57,670 --> 01:24:59,460
That's all I wanted.

1029
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,380
You should know her name, too.

1030
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:21,510
Her name

1031
01:25:22,890 --> 01:25:24,360
is Amy!

1032
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:30,300
And she is not gonna die
on this fucking hill!

1033
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,530
Jeff!

1034
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:59,650
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1035
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:01,090
Please.

1036
01:27:24,410 --> 01:27:25,710
Okay.

1037
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:32,750
Okay.

1038
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,710
- Dimitri!
- Dimitri!

1039
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:10,000
Dimitri!
