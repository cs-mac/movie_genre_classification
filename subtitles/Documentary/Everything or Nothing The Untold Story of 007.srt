India! India! India! India!

India! India! India! India!

00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,120
'And now a quick recap
of the two dismissals.'

6
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,800
'Sehwag leg before to Malinga.'

7
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,600
'Caught right plum
in front of the wickets.'

8
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,640
'And Sachin Tendulkar caught
behind off a very thick edge.'

'Muttiah Muralitharan!'

'The Wizard of the Emerald Isle'

11
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,360
'being introduced
into the attack!'

12
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,880
Excuse me, Gary.
- Yes.

13
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,000
If a wicket goes down,
I think I should go in.

14
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,880
But Yuvi is padded up
and ready.

15
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,080
No, it's Murali.
I think I should go in.

16
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,560
You sure?
- Yes.

17
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,160
Just tell him, I'll.. I'll go.

18
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,800
'Go, go, go, go, go!'

19
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,280
'Has to hurry,
chance of a run out!'

20
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,320
'Gambhir survives!'

21
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,640
'Catch it!'

22
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,400
'That's a stunning catch!
Kohli has to depart!'

23
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,760
'India now in a..'

24
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,160
Go Dhoni!

25
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,360
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

26
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,280
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

27
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,240
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

28
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,240
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

29
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,160
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

30
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,200
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

31
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,720
Pan Singh Dhoni?

32
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,920
Congratulations, it's a boy.

33
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,080
Mr. Ghosh.

34
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,720
Congratulations, it's a girl.

35
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,120
Thank you.

36
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,520
Rascals, you have a sister.

37
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,480
Both are okay, Dhoni.

38
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,200
Mother and daughter.

39
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,720
But Doctor,
the nurse just said

40
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,960
it's a boy.

41
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,320
Huh! Did she say boy?
- Yes.

42
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,280
Just a minute.

43
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,920
What did Pan Singh Dhoni have?
- A boy.

44
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,440
And Ghosh?
- Girl.

45
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,360
Oh!

46
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,720
You're right. It's a boy.

47
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,960
And Mr. Ghosh, congratulations
for the baby girl.

48
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,560
Okay?

49
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,640
Unbelievable.

50
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,160
If they continue like this someday
the babies will get exchanged!

51
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,840
Mr. Dhoni.

52
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,440
Just don't argue with him.
- Okay, sir.

53
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,040
Just listen to what
he says and say yes.

54
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,640
Right, sir. - Actually,
Mr. Deval is rarely wrong.

55
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,440
He has played for Ranji.

56
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,240
And he was also the Vice-President

57
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,880
of the Bihar Cricket Association.

58
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,320
Understood?
- Yes, sir.

59
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,440
Pause here.

60
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,400
Who commissioned this AV, Roy?

61
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,720
Mr. Sinha did.

62
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,280
There's something I must
tell him over the phone.

63
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,360
Remind me later.

64
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,520
Yes, sir.

65
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,760
Rakesh, we're in the 90s now.
- Right, sir.

66
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,600
Change the sitar music
in the background.

67
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,840
Yes, sir.

68
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,520
And reshoot the ground
footage in three months.

69
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,040
Is there anything wrong
with the ground footage?

70
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,560
You call this a ground!

71
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,680
Is this where you want
our children to practice

72
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,480
and compete with kids
from other states?

73
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,200
Reshoot this ground
in three months.

74
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,480
We're putting in
a turf wicket here.

75
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,760
I'm going to completely
revamp this stadium.

76
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,400
Sir, may I ask you something,
if you don't mind?

77
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,400
Why aren't Bihar's players
regulars in the national team?

78
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,840
Isn't that what you want to ask?

79
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,920
Yes, sir.

80
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,520
We love politics more
than cricket. Get it?

81
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,280
See you.
- Yes.

82
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,680
Budhia.
- Yes, sir.

83
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,960
Why haven't you
watered the ground yet?

84
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,360
The pump operator, Pan Singh,
is refusing.

85
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,480
What do you mean
by he's refusing?

86
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,240
He's saying
that there's no water.

87
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,720
Get him here.
- Yes, sir.

88
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,240
What's going on?
- Don't worry, sir.

89
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,280
Pan Singh, Mr. Deval is
calling you to the ground.

90
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,120
What happened now?

91
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,840
Be strict with these people.
- Yes, sir.

92
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,400
Do you see
the condition of the ground?

93
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
Hello, sir.
- Hello.

94
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,360
Why haven't you
watered the ground yet?

95
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,800
Sir, right now the water is being
supplied to the family quarters.

96
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,560
I'll water the ground
if there's any left.

97
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,920
What's the problem
in doing it now?

98
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,000
If the family quarters
don't get enough

99
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,040
I'll have to answer to them.

100
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,200
And what about the stadium?

101
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,920
If the families need to eat

102
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,520
the children also need to play.
- Yes, sir.

103
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,200
Do you expect the
children to play on this?

104
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,120
You're right, sir.

105
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,720
Then water the ground right now.

106
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,120
Sir,
it'll be wrong to do it now.

107
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,040
I have a suggestion.

108
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,440
I'll water the field
at night after 11.

109
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,880
That will solve everyone's problems.

110
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,240
What time do you sleep?

111
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,960
Currently I'm in the morning shift.

112
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,880
So I sleep by 9 p.m.

113
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,440
Can you sleep at 9 p.m.
and wake up at 11 p.m. again?

114
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,160
Yes, don't worry about that.

115
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,720
Goodbye, sir.

116
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,040
What do you mean he won't play?

117
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,120
Try to understand, Mrs. Shukla.

118
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,240
The match is just three days away

119
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,040
and now you're saying he won't play.

120
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,720
If he doesn't play, who's
going to do the wicket-keeping?

121
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,680
His father is getting furious.

122
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,120
His board exams are
just around the corner.

123
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
If he wastes his time playing cricket

124
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,560
then when will he study?

125
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,160
But the exams start
after two months.

126
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,320
Exactly my point,
only two months are left.

127
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,560
Wicket-keeping won't
do him any good.

128
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,600
And if his percentage
drops even by a notch

129
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,920
his father will create a ruckus.

130
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,360
Look,
your son plays really well.

131
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,960
You're ruining his life
for a few marks.

132
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,520
Let him play,
he'll make it really big someday.

133
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
How big?

134
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,720
At the most he'll go
from Ranchi to Jamshedpur.

135
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,840
No, Mr. Banerjee,
please spare him.

136
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,160
His father wants to
make him a lawyer.

137
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,760
He wants to send him to Kolkata.

138
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,400
Come, Pintu. Come on.
- Mrs. Shukla.

139
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,040
Listen to me!

140
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,480
His present is still uncertain

141
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,160
and she wants to shape his future.

142
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,920
Chittu, come here.

143
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,160
Yes, sir?

144
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,320
Who's that boy?
- Goalkeeper? - Yes.

145
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,080
That's Mahi. He's my classmate.

146
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,800
Look, don't tell him I asked.

147
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,720
Ask him if he's interested
in playing cricket.

148
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,400
What did he say?

149
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,680
He said, 'Are you mad?
Who wants to play with a tiny ball?'

150
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,520
Come..

151
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,960
Come.

152
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,200
Come..

153
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,760
Jayanti,
tell Mahi to do his homework!

154
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,240
Mahi, do your homework!

155
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,400
Just five more minutes.

156
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,800
Come.

157
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,200
Mahi, dad is home!

158
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,440
'...the world of architecture.
Architecture..'

159
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,880
'The Taj Mahal is one of the seven..'
- Here.

160
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,760
'...wonders of the world..'

161
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,960
'Which he built for his wife..'

162
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
They sat down to study
after they saw my cycle.

163
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,360
Of course.

164
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,960
Why don't you two fix
a daily routine for yourselves?

165
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,960
2 hours for studies and
then 2 hours for playing.

166
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,080
Mahi has already fixed
a routine for himself.

167
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,040
2 hours for playing and then
another 2 hours for playing.

168
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,480
Let it be, I'll deal with them.

169
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,120
I have to go tonight.

170
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,840
Why? Overtime again?
- No. It's a small thing.

171
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,360
You haven't been
well the past two days.

172
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,920
Let it be.

173
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,080
I've already said that I'll do it.

174
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,960
It's not too much work.

175
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,640
The ground has completely
dried up as well.

176
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,880
'Monuments are built by..
Between 16th and 17th century..'

177
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,840
Come back soon.

178
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,080
Budhia, switch on the lights
and start the water-pump!

179
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,240
Okay!

180
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,000
Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

181
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,360
Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

182
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,800
Did you do your
history homework?

183
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,920
Hey!

184
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,480
Sir, me?
- Yes. Come here.

185
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,040
What's your name?

186
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,640
Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

187
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,280
You're a good goalkeeper.

188
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,000
I saw you play yesterday.
Keep it up.

189
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,600
Thank you, sir.

190
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,800
What other sports do you like?

191
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,920
Badminton. Table Tennis.

192
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,520
Would you like to play cricket?
- No, sir.

193
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,240
No interest in cricket?

194
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,600
Not really.

195
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,600
Scared of playing with a hard ball?
- No, sir.

196
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,280
The wicket-keeper trials
are after school today.

197
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,920
Play for me.

198
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,520
Okay, sir.

199
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,320
Excuse me, sir.

200
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,800
I'm not scared of playing
with the hard ball.

201
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,080
Thank you, sir.

202
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,720
Catch the ball!

203
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,720
Yes, catch it.

204
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,240
Catch it.
Yes. Don't drop it.

205
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,160
Oh!

206
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,560
You're completely useless

207
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,320
in sports and studies.

208
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,240
Let's see you catch some more.
Come on.

209
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,520
What's your problem?
Can't you see the ball?

210
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,960
It's a red ball!
Can't you see it?

211
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,840
You can't do anything right.

212
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,520
Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

213
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,960
Shabbir, give him a pair of gloves.

214
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,520
Wear those gloves.
You come here.

215
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,560
Now go.
Go, stand on the mark, come on.

216
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,840
Ready?
- Yes, sir.

217
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,120
Throw.

218
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,360
You don't
punch the ball in cricket.

219
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,040
You catch the ball. Understood?
- Yes, sir.

220
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,240
Ready.

221
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,600
Come on, throw, throw.

222
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,680
Are you trying to
catch a ball or a fish?

223
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,400
Catch it. No problem!

224
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,080
Concentrate!

225
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,720
Keep your eyes on the ball
right till the end!

226
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,360
Very good!
Yes, that's it. Correct.

227
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,440
Very good. Very good.

228
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,600
Very good.

229
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,600
That's it! That's it!

230
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,280
Very good!

231
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,560
Good. Very good!

232
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Come here.
Hey, stop!

233
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,160
Would you like to do wicket-keeping
for the school team?

234
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,240
Sir, I like to bat more than
anything in cricket.

235
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,200
Concentrate on your
wicket-keeping first.

236
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,440
But sir..
- I said wicket-keeping.

237
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,880
You must practise everyday
for two hours after school. Okay?

238
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,320
Can I keep the gloves?

239
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,040
Keep them.

240
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,360
Shabbir,
give him the inners as well.

241
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,080
Take care of them.

242
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,440
Yes, sir.
- They are school property.

243
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,280
I'm only allowing this
as a special case.

244
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,240
Sister!

245
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,840
Sister!
- What?

246
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,480
Look.
- What is that?

247
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,840
Wicket-keeping gloves.

248
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,240
I've been selected
for the school team.

249
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,080
All play and no work
will ruin your life.

250
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,840
All work and no play
will help you succeed.

251
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,520
All work and no
play will ruin my life.

252
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,000
All play and no work
will make me succeed.

253
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,160
Mahi, wait!

254
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,360
Mahi!

255
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,280
Mom,
Mahi wants to say something.

256
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,560
Tell her.

257
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,320
What is it, Mahi?

258
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,040
Mom, I've been selected
for the school's cricket team.

259
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,440
So?

260
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,720
So, I have to practise for
2 hours every day after school.

261
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,920
And your studies?

262
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,360
I'll do it when I come back.

263
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Honestly.
Just talk to dad.

264
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
Please, Mom.

265
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,160
And his studies?
- He'll do it after he comes back.

266
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
What do you mean by he'll do it?
- He'll manage.

267
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,720
His heart is set on it.

268
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,280
Come here.

269
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,400
Yes, Dad.

270
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,120
When did you catch
this cricket fever?

271
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,640
Today.

272
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,600
Fine, but don't let
it affect your studies.

273
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,200
Not even a bit.
- Yes.

274
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,600
What am I?

275
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,480
What do I do?
- You're a pump operator.

276
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,320
That's why I keep insisting
that you study.

277
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,480
Don't be like me.

278
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,280
Sports has its own importance.

279
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,120
But only if you study hard
will you be successful.

280
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,400
Understand?

281
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,800
Yes.

282
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,360
Go.

283
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,800
It's so hard to get
a government job these days.

284
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,960
"Smear 'Malai' on the face
of the sun."

285
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,040
"Ride the foolish clouds."

286
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,240
"Smear 'Malai' on the face
of the sun."

287
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,120
"Ride the foolish clouds."

288
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,440
"We open our books to study"

289
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,520
"and they teach us
about the Panipat War."

290
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,720
"Listen to your heart
and be a brave-heart."

291
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,480
"Fear will get you nothing."

292
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,280
"All work and no play
will help you succeed."

293
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,880
"All play and no work
will ruin your life."

294
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,440
"All work and no play
will ruin your life."

295
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,000
"All play and no work
will make you succeed."

296
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,440
How much is that for?

297
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,040
Rs. 400 for that one.
- Oh, no!

298
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,880
And this one?
- Rs. 200.

299
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,040
Fine, how much for this one?
- Rs. 80.

300
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,800
Hurry up,
I'm getting late for practice.

301
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,000
Who told you to schedule
the practice on Sunday?

302
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,680
Yes
- Fine, final price is 60.

303
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,240
I won't pay more than 50.

304
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,360
He won't give it.
Let's go, let's go.

305
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,320
50 isn't possible.
- Okay, fine.

306
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,720
Ma'am..

307
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,560
Good shot! Who's next?

308
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,360
What are you doing?
You're bowling so short.

309
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,000
Come on, Sanjay.

310
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,880
Good ball, good ball. Next!

311
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,160
Great!
- Good shot again!

312
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,120
Next, quickly!

313
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,080
Aakash?
- Yes, Mahi.

314
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,120
Will you let me bat for a while?

315
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,560
Mr. Banerjee only
makes me do wicket-keeping.

316
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,400
What are you doing?
Bowl properly.

317
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,520
No.. I said 50.

318
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,280
Okay, 55 and it's yours.

319
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,960
Oh, God!
- 50 and that's final.

320
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,040
Just give it to her!
- Okay.

321
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,760
Weigh it first. Come on.
- Quickly.

322
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,080
Give him 50.
- I am, hold on.

323
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,200
Fine?
- Fine, fine.

324
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,560
Cut the pieces.

325
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,200
Mahi is stretching like
he's going to whack the ball.

326
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,040
Sanjay, bowl him an easy ball.

327
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,480
Whoa!

328
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,040
Good shot, Mahi, good shot!

329
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,080
Here's your money.
Take it.

330
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,960
What's the hurry?

331
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,320
You don't understand anything.
- Yes!

332
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,720
Because you're the
only smart one!

333
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,000
Taking me shopping during
practice hours.

334
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,480
Wait, wait, wait.

335
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,840
Now hurry up.

336
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,040
Are you seated?
- Yes.

337
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,160
Get off, get off.
Get off quickly!

338
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,080
Be careful! - Okay.
- Godspeed!

339
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,160
Good shot, Mahi!

340
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,040
Hello, Mr. Pan Singh.
- Hello. Hello.

341
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,440
Let's buy some bangles.
- Yes, sure.

342
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,360
Mom, Mom.

343
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,880
Mom, listen.

344
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,120
Huh?

345
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,720
What?
- Mom..

346
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,080
Mom.
Can I buy that?

347
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,960
Lord Hanuman?
- No, the one next to that.

348
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,960
Which God is that?

349
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,800
And that's a strange
crown he's wearing.

350
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,240
What will you do with that?

351
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,240
Mom,
just buy that for me please.

352
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,760
Look, he has hung Sachin's
poster on the wall.

353
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,480
Why did you buy it?

354
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,840
What could I do?

355
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,360
I saw his expression
and I couldn't say no.

356
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,760
Don't think too much.

357
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,440
You know what happens
to sportsmen, don't you?

358
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,440
I know he likes to play, but..

359
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,080
All I want is for him to
study and get a decent job.

360
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,920
Is that all?
Will that make you happy?

361
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,440
Yes, it will.

362
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,640
What if Mahi isn't happy with that?

363
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,920
What do you mean?

364
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,440
I watch him

365
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,640
and kids his age.

366
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,040
My heart says

367
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,960
that he is not going to stop
at these small milestones.

368
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,640
Just wait and watch.

369
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,960
From the bus stand end,
right arm over the wicket.

370
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,120
And that's.. That's a miss!
- Oh, no!

371
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,840
That was a really good ball.

372
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,320
Hey..
- Straight to the keeper's hand.

373
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,080
It's getting really hard
for DAV School to score.

374
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,080
Prashant Sharma is
a really good bowler.

375
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,640
In the previous match
he took three wickets

376
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,880
and did a hat-trick.

377
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,560
Making things difficult
for DAV School.

378
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Let's see what DAV School's
strategy is going to be.

379
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,920
Come on. Come on!

380
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,480
The match is
at an interesting point.

381
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,960
DAV needs 12 runs to win,
with just 4 balls remaining

382
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,560
and 3 wickets in hand.

383
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,200
And now the next ball.

384
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,160
And that's out!

385
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,520
He's clean bowled.

386
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,320
It seems like the match is
slipping out of DAV's hands.

387
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,320
DAV needs 12 runs to win.

388
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,960
There are 3 balls left

389
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,760
and I can see a new player
coming to the ground.

390
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,960
Careful.
- His name is Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

391
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,320
I know you won't listen.

392
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,280
Will you score if I give you
the strike? - I'll try.

393
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,960
Then I would rather try myself.

394
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,960
Come on..

395
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,480
It's going to be tough
for DAV School.

396
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,640
Prashant Sharma is bowling
from the Khairali end.

397
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,800
Prashant Sharma, gesturing

398
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,320
for a change in the
fielding positions.

399
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,360
Mahendra Singh Dhoni ready for
bowler Prashant Sharma.

400
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,760
Bowling right hand over the wicket.

401
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,360
And he has smashed that!

402
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,960
The ball is soaring
through the air!

403
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,200
Go, Mahi!

404
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,920
The second ball from
Prashant Sharma.

405
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,040
The viewers are waiting.

406
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,440
This is a golden opportunity
for DAV Shyamali.

407
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,680
Two balls to go
and six runs required.

408
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,200
Prashant Sharma.

409
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,560
Six!

410
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,400
Yay!

411
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,400
Hit towards the bus stand!

412
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,600
With that six, DAV has stolen
the match from under their nose.

413
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,760
The sky is clear and it's
a good a day to play cricket.

414
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,760
DAV Shyamali
and Khairali's captains

415
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,840
are in the middle of
the field for the toss.

416
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,840
Heads.

417
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,440
And DAV Shyamali has
won the toss.. - Batting.

418
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,760
...and elected to bat first.

419
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,320
What do you think, Mr. Tiwari?

420
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,600
Right or wrong?

421
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,920
Mr. Shukla, let's see
how the match plays out.

422
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,080
Well said.

423
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,840
This is the batting order, follow it.
- Okay.

424
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,320
Excuse me, sir.
- What?

425
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,480
I haven't got a chance to bat
for the last 8 matches.

426
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,320
You'll get it today,
their bowling is really strong.

427
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,960
With your permission,
can I open today?

428
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,520
What?

429
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,040
Sir, Shabbir and Anuj
open every time.

430
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,560
Give me one chance too.

431
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,080
Fine,
we'll see in the next match.

432
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,920
The next match is with RPS.
- So?

433
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,440
What's the point in
scoring against a weak team?

434
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,720
They are both
padded up and ready.

435
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,120
I'll talk to them, sir.
Just a minute.

436
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,560
Hey, listen!

437
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,360
Mr. Shukla

438
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,960
both teams are really enthusiastic.

439
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,800
Anything can happen in today's game.

440
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,080
That's what I predict.
Let's see what happens.

441
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,240
Sir, Anuj is ready.
Can Shabbir and I open?

442
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,880
First tell me what you said to them.

443
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,720
Mr. Banerjee!
- Yes, coming.

444
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,120
Go.
- Thank you, sir.

445
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,640
Listen.
- Yes, sir?

446
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,360
Don't be in a hurry to return.
- Yes, sir.

447
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,280
Shabbir Hussain and
Mahendra Singh Dhoni

448
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,720
will be opening
for DAV Shyamali.

449
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,000
Play carefully.

450
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,240
Mr. Banerjee won't
give you a second chance.

451
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,560
I'll take the strike,
just don't get me run out.

452
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
What?

453
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,760
Mahendra Singh Dhoni

454
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,800
usually comes in at No. 6

455
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,200
but is set to open today.

456
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,800
What are your thoughts on
this Mr. Tiwari? Right or wrong?

457
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,960
Let's see how the match plays out.

458
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,200
First ball of the over.

459
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,960
Shorakat Chowdhary.
Pacing towards the pitch

460
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,960
and the first ball.

461
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,280
And he has smashed it!

462
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,280
Six runs!
- Brilliant!

463
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,280
Wait a minute, I know that boy!

464
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,640
He's a hard hitter, Mr. Shukla.

465
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,160
He hit two straight sixes

466
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,320
and won the last
match for his team.

467
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,560
He's really good!

468
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,840
How many viewers do you
see on the ground right now?

469
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,640
Roughly 15-16 people.
Why are you asking?

470
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,800
Mr. Shukla,
let this boy play for an hour.

471
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,720
And you'll see a different
scenario altogether.

472
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,360
That's superb!
- Beautiful shot!

473
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,760
Six runs!
- Great shot!

474
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,560
Mahi is smashing the ball.
- What do you mean?

475
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,640
How many wickets did we lose?

476
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,040
He has opened the innings today.

477
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,280
Girish, look after the shop.

478
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,680
The next bowler is ready

479
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,560
and he has bowled to Dhoni.

480
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,880
And Dhoni has hit that
hard for 4 runs!

481
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,360
Awesome!
- Well done!

482
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,560
What a player!

483
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,560
Amazing!
And that's a 50!

484
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,920
Amazing!
You're playing really well.

485
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
Keep at it. Play carefully.

486
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,640
Ma'am, Mahi is smashing the ball!

487
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,840
That's great!
- That calls for a holiday. - Yes.

488
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,480
Dhoni's batting is
spreading its magic.

489
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,800
Children are
flocking to the ground!

490
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,880
Yes, yes, yes!

491
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,640
That's great!
That's Dhoni's second century!

492
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,280
Double century for him!

493
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,200
I'm proud of you.

494
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,640
He has unravelled the opposition!

495
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,400
Hello. - Hello, please
connect me to Mr. Somi.

496
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,960
Please hold, I'll connect you.

497
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,960
Call for you.

498
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,680
Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Somi.

499
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,040
Param speaking from Ranchi.

500
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,160
Param, I gave you this
number only for emergencies.

501
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,320
This is an emergency.

502
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,080
Remember that boy, Dhoni?

503
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,240
I spoke to you about
sponsoring his cricket kit.

504
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,160
Yes, you keep calling
up regularly for him

505
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,840
and I keep saying no.

506
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,400
What's his name? Dhoni.

507
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,840
Yes, that's him.

508
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,480
You know,
he scored 213 runs in 150 balls.

509
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,520
And in a single day.

510
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,720
His game is getting
better day by day.

511
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,280
I just wanted to
give you this good news.

512
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,680
Okay, are you done?

513
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,240
Can I hang up now?
- Yes.

514
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,480
I'll call you again tomorrow
for the sponsorship.

515
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,240
And I'm coming
to Jalandhar at the month's end.

516
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,880
Goodbye.
- Don't come!

517
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,520
Hello, Param.

518
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,160
Lord.

519
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,520
How much?

520
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,200
'And now for sports news.'

521
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,040
'India was eliminated from
the 1999 World Cup competition.'

522
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,440
'While playing against
New Zealand in Trent Bridge'

523
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,680
'India won the toss'

524
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,640
'and elected to bat first.'

525
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,120
'Ajay Jadeja made
the highest score'

526
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,640
'of 76 runs on behalf of India.'

527
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,280
'India made 251 runs in 50 overs.'

528
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,440
'The New Zealand team..'

529
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,120
Come on, Mahi, it's quite late.

530
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,040
Chotu, I don't think this one's
going to last for too long.

531
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,440
Why do you hit so hard?
Use it gently.

532
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,080
I hit gently.
It's you who thinks I hit hard.

533
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,160
Girish, close the shop.

534
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,600
May I ride it?
- Here.

535
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,680
Chotu,
the MRF bat which Sachin uses..

536
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,160
How much does that cost?

537
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,800
MRF only makes tires.

538
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,240
Sachin has been paid to
put the MRF sticker on his bat.

539
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,840
People pay good players

540
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,920
to put their stickers on their bats.

541
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,320
That's great.

542
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,920
And Dad, everyone says
that Mahi plays really well.

543
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,960
And if he keeps playing like this

544
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,480
someday he will make it really big.

545
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,080
When do his exams begin?
- Day after tomorrow.

546
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,600
And you know, his Under-19
trials are coming up too.

547
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,720
Just a second.

548
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,720
How are your studies coming along?
- Just fine.

549
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,480
My exams start day after tomorrow.

550
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,880
Will you pass?

551
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,320
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

552
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,520
The Office Leagues
begin day after tomorrow.

553
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,600
Trials begin at 11 a.m. everyday.

554
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,240
But will you appear
for your exams?

555
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,280
The exam starts at 8 a.m.

556
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,920
If I finish my paper by 10:30

557
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,800
and catch the 10:45 passenger train

558
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,640
I'll make it to the ground on time.

559
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,920
Yes.

560
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,800
Will you finish your 3 hour
paper in 2.5 hours?

561
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,640
It's difficult,
but I'll get through.

562
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,840
That must be Chittu with the notes.

563
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,200
I'll be right back.

564
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,880
What?

565
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,320
Listen, listen! - Water.
- Don't worry so much.

566
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,800
Drink some water.
- I'll drink the water

567
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,760
but how will he finish his 3 hour
paper in 2.5 hours?

568
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,880
Like I said,
let him do what he's doing.

569
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,480
Leave him be.
You worry too much.

570
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,720
"The roads run faster
than your feet can."

571
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:17,200
"What you want from life
is way beyond the ordinary."

572
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:23,120
"The roads run faster
than your feet can."

573
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:27,960
"What you want from life
is way beyond the ordinary."

574
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:33,040
"Why think too much?
Where do you want to go?"

575
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,680
"Just go where destiny takes you."

576
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:43,600
"Impatience."

577
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,320
"Impatience."

578
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:55,400
"Impatience."

579
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,680
"Impatience."

580
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,880
No, Param.

581
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,920
We never sponsor any
non-established player.

582
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,160
That's not our policy.

583
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,680
Sir, the boy's very special.

584
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,680
He just needs your support.

585
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,880
Exactly, it's not
possible to support him.

586
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,040
Goodbye.

587
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,960
You can support
Pakistani players

588
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,520
but not someone
from our own country.

589
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,840
No drama, no emotional drama..
Understand?

590
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,360
Tell me something.

591
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,120
What's his name?
- Dhoni. - Dhoni.

592
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,800
Is Dhoni like Tendulkar?

593
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,320
No. Dhoni is Dhoni.

594
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,640
All that boy needs
is an opportunity

595
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,880
and someday
he'll make it really big.

596
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,400
And one day you will
remember what I said.

597
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,800
Okay,
when are you going to Ranchi?

598
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,040
My train leaves tonight.

599
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,640
Fine, you go on.
I'll think about it

600
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,720
and get back to you
in two days. Okay?

601
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,120
Then why don't I
stay back for two days?

602
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,320
I'm sure you'll think
of doing some good.

603
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,960
And you'll be doing
that poor boy a favour.

604
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,440
How do you benefit from all this?

605
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,880
Why are you advocating that boy?
What's his name?

606
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,040
Dhoni.
- Yes, Dhoni.

607
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,400
What's your interest in all this?

608
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,880
I have a very big interest.

609
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,240
Even I loved cricket.

610
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,480
But had no talent.

611
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,960
But this boy is really talented.

612
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,600
If he makes it big someday

613
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,560
it will make me feel like
I played too.

614
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,080
"Clouds will bow down
before you"

615
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:18,960
"as long as you feel this way."

616
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,720
"Your wealth and your treasure"

617
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,080
"are this determination
and this passion of yours."

618
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:37,440
"Why stop the inevitable?"

619
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:43,080
"Just go where destiny takes you."

620
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,200
"Impatience."

621
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,760
"Impatience."

622
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,320
"Impatience."

623
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,920
"Impatience."

624
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,120
Dhoni, 2 balls and 5 runs.

625
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,440
Good shot!
- Yay!

626
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,760
Hello, sir. You called me.
- Yes, Pan Singh. How are you?

627
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,720
Fine, sir. - I've heard a lot
of praise for Mahi's game.

628
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,760
Yes.

629
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,840
Don't worry about his career.
- Yes.

630
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,680
Cricket will shape his career.
- By the grace of the Goddess.

631
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,440
He has great potential.

632
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,240
It shouldn't be wasted, that's all.

633
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,320
What stipend is the
Steel Authority giving Mahi?

634
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,800
Rs. 625 monthly, sir

635
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,040
and Rs. 25 for practice as well.

636
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,640
Will Mahi join
the Central Coal Fields?

637
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,560
I already had a word with them.

638
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,840
His stipend will be 1500.

639
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,680
Mahi's stipend will be higher
than any new player's till now.

640
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,360
It's a good team.

641
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,960
Mahi will benefit a lot.

642
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,920
With your support, he will.

643
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,800
If he gets a job and
then if he becomes permanent..

644
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,160
He's too young for that.

645
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,840
We'll see when the time's right.

646
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,160
You've been generous to so many.
If you consider him as well..

647
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,720
He's like my boy.
Of course I'll look after him.

648
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,520
Okay. - Will the Steel Authority
guys let him quit?

649
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,480
I'll talk to them.

650
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,040
Let me know if they don't let him.

651
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,720
I'll make sure that
they let him quit.

652
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,080
Get some sweets for everyone,
come on.

653
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,600
Yes, of course.

654
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,040
Come on..
- You're doing great.

655
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,440
Just keep bowling like that.
I'll stand here at mid-off.

656
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,320
It's the last ball, come on.

657
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,080
Come on, come on!

658
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,960
1 ball to go and 5 runs needed.

659
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,320
Bowl at his feet,
okay? His feet.

660
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,920
Come on. Bunty, forward.
- Come on, come on!

661
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,400
Santosh.
- Yes.

662
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,600
Where did you learn to
play that shot? - Liked it?

663
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,080
I call it the 'Slap-shot'.

664
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,560
Will you teach me?
- Will you buy Samosas for me?

665
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,080
Of course.
- Then I'll teach you.

666
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,480
Then tomorrow..
- Mahi!

667
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,600
Mahi, your family has
been looking for you.

668
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,080
See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

669
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,800
Your father has been
looking for you.

670
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,800
What happened?
- I don't know what happened.

671
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,080
He said, 'Pan Singh,
this is just the beginning.'

672
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,360
I was really glad to hear that.

673
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,680
Quiet. Quiet.
- Yes.

674
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,440
What happened?
- Hi.

675
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,920
Yes, Dad.

676
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,040
You were looking for me.
- Me?

677
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,680
Yes.
- No.

678
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,400
This..
- This arrived today, by courier.

679
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,600
Mom even gave Rs. 2
to the courier boy.

680
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,640
You know, Mahi,
Mr. Deval called me today.

681
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,640
He's asked you to join Coal Fields.

682
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,000
1500 stipend.

683
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,720
And he was also saying that
he'll make your job permanent.

684
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,360
It's a joyous day today.

685
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,560
I'll be right back, Dad.

686
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,080
Mahi, Mahi, listen!

687
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,560
Where are you going?

688
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,400
Anything else? - That's all.
- Rs. 210.

689
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,200
What's wrong?
Why are you so serious?

690
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,320
The kit bag has arrived.

691
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,920
Are you insane?

692
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,640
This is just a kit bag.

693
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,240
Just focus on your game.

694
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,920
The Lord will take
care of the rest.

695
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,440
And yes, I want a century
in the next match.

696
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,640
Go on.

697
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,640
What are you doing?

698
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,640
You scared me. It's beer.
Do you want a sip?

699
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,960
It gets you high.

700
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,640
Have you lost your mind?

701
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,480
Do you want to be
a cricketer or an addict?

702
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,440
Mahi,
just a little doesn't matter.

703
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,080
This is your party, right?
Just let me have some fun.

704
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,440
Don't make me furious, Santosh.

705
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,080
If I see you drinking again,
I won't talk to you.

706
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,400
Mahi, don't get angry!

707
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,760
Listen, Mahi!

708
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,720
Welcome everyone to the
Keenan Stadium, Jamshedpur.

709
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,400
This is the final match
of the Cooch Behar Trophy

710
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,960
between Bihar and Punjab.

711
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,320
Bihar's captain Vikas Kumar
and Punjab's captain

712
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,080
the talented Yuvraj Singh,
are standing

713
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,560
in the middle of the field
for the toss. - Heads.

714
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,640
Batting.

715
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,760
All the best!

716
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,600
Bihar wins the toss
and elects to bat.

717
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,760
What do you say, Mr. Shukla?

718
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,040
Very good decision.

719
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,160
You can't give away wickets.

720
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,400
It's a four day match

721
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,120
and you guys must bat
for at least 2 and 1/2 days.

722
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,440
If you wish to play the Under-19
World Cup, then let me tell you

723
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,160
that there are two people here

724
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,120
from the All India Junior
Selection Committee.

725
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,520
The World Cup is next month.

726
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,120
The team will be announced
in a few days

727
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,920
and this is your opportunity.

728
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,760
Rattan Kumar and S. Vich
heading towards the field.

729
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,200
And he's bowled.

730
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,800
Wonderful shot!

731
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,200
There's a fielder under it.

732
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,480
And that's a catch!

733
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,240
Come on!

734
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,720
And that's out!

735
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,080
Dhoni, we must save our wickets.
Play carefully.

736
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,120
He doesn't know you too well yet.

737
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,960
The next batsman coming up
is Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

738
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,120
The entire responsibility
lies on Dhoni now.

739
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,040
Let's see how he performs today.

740
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,840
Mahendra Singh Dhoni
had already judged the ball

741
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,240
and he hit that over
Yuvraj Singh's head.

742
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,480
You can see Yuvraj
staring him down.

743
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,600
Dhoni's ready.

744
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,200
Yuvraj's next ball

745
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,360
straight to the
wicket-keeper's gloves.

746
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,080
Mahendra Singh Dhoni
couldn't judge the ball.

747
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,240
Yuvraj staring directly
at Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

748
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,400
Did you notice their
attitude towards each other?

749
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,720
And that's a fitting reply!

750
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,680
Catch it!

751
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,680
And with that
Dhoni completes 50 runs.

752
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,280
50, Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

753
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,720
Come on, guys!

754
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,240
At the end of Day 1, Bihar's
score is 254 runs for 5 wickets.

755
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,480
Mahendra Singh Dhoni has
scored a total of 70 runs, not out.

756
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,880
And Ratan Kumar is
playing at 77 not out.

757
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,080
What would you like to say,
Mr. Shukla?

758
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,640
Just make 200 runs more tomorrow.

759
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,480
Then we'll see who can stop you
from playing for India Under-19.

760
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,040
You'll get selected,
you don't need to worry.

761
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,760
What a player!

762
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,240
The weather is really cold.

763
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,800
The next ball of this over

764
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,200
to Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

765
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,080
The next ball.

766
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,520
And he has hit that hard!

767
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,440
The ball's straight up in the air.

768
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,280
Sodhi's right under the ball.

769
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,680
And that's out!

770
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,680
Sodhi has taken a wonderful catch!

771
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,320
Mahendra Singh Dhoni is out!

772
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,280
When did he return?
- This morning.

773
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,360
I see. - He didn't go home.
- Okay.

774
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,240
He came here and threw me out.
- Oh?

775
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,760
He has locked the door
from the inside.

776
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,360
He always does this.

777
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,880
Open the door!

778
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,960
Won't you guys let me sleep?

779
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,320
What happened?
- What happened where?

780
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,880
What happened at the finals?

781
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,040
You're laughing.
- Take a seat.

782
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,720
Chittu, get some water.

783
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,160
Will you tell me already?
- Take a seat, and I'll tell you.

784
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,520
Don't get so..

785
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,520
Here you go.

786
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,560
He'll tell us after
drinking water.

787
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,120
So, on Day 2
I got out after scoring 84 runs.

788
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,520
The entire team got out at 357 runs.

789
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,640
Now Punjab comes to bat.

790
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,560
They lose their first
wicket at 60 runs.

791
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,600
Then Yuvraj Singh comes to bat.

792
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,200
The score at the end of Day 2,
108 for 1 wicket.

793
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,760
Hurry up,
tell me what happened next.

794
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,480
It's when I hurry that I mess up.
Let me tell you properly.

795
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,680
On Day 3,
they lose only one wicket.

796
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,600
The score at the end of Day 3
is 431 for 2 wickets.

797
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,600
Yuvraj Singh hit a double century.

798
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,200
He hit a lot.

799
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,800
Broke all records.

800
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:43,240
Last day, Day 4,
Punjab's total score was 839.

801
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,440
Yuvraj's individual score was 358.

802
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,120
One run more than the Bihar team's
entire score.

803
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,320
We never got to play
the second innings.

804
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,680
Do you know where we lost the match?

805
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,160
Where?

806
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,560
Not on the cricket ground

807
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,480
but on the basketball
court at night.

808
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,560
What are you blabbering?

809
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,920
Any new movie playing?

810
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,640
'Captain Mohammad Kaif,
R. S. Ricky'

811
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,720
'Manish Sharma, R. S. Sodhi'

812
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,200
'Arjun Yadav, Yuvraj Singh'

813
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,040
'Venugopal Rao, Niraj Patel'

814
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,920
'Wicket-keeper Ajay Ratra,
Shalabh Srivastava'

815
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,720
'Mritunjay Tripathi,
Mihir Diwakar'

816
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,320
'S. Vidyut and Anup Dave.'

817
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,120
There are three more players

818
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,640
whose selection was debated upon.

819
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,840
But they couldn't secure
a place on this team.

820
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,120
Opening batsman Gautam Gambhir.

821
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,480
Wicket-keeper Amit Deshpande.

822
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,320
And left-hand spin-bowler
Rakesh Dhurv.

823
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,720
They didn't even
mention Mahi's name.

824
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,960
Chotu, come here.

825
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,680
A dozen fritters
and 1 kilo sweetmeats.

826
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,680
I'm telling you,
this is all a set-up.

827
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,280
Why else would Mahi
not be selected?

828
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,160
You fool..

829
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,960
Mister, take this.

830
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,800
Bring all of it on a plate, it's hot.
- Okay.

831
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,520
What happened?
Why are you all so quiet?

832
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,320
Mahi..
- Mahi, your..

833
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,520
I didn't get selected, I know.

834
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,360
Look, this tournament
has made me realise

835
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,880
that what I did wasn't enough.

836
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,520
I must work harder.

837
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,120
So, it's an important day
for me today.

838
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,840
I'm giving this fritter
and sweetmeat party

839
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,720
so I don't forget this day.

840
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,640
Will you guys start or should
I leave? - Mahi, listen.

841
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,600
Where are you going?
You didn't get cold drinks.

842
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,680
First eat this.
- Let's start.

843
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,800
I think you didn't
get enough fritters.

844
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,960
Have some.

845
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,320
How much for the pomfret?

846
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,960
Rs. 80.
- That's too much.

847
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,120
Why do you haggle so much?

848
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,720
Just buy what you want.
- I have to.

849
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,920
I can't pay whatever they ask for.

850
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,640
Pack them. - Keshav! How are you?
- All good, Chanchal.

851
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,120
Mister, weigh this. - Are you
enjoying yourself? - Yes, I am

852
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,320
enjoying myself.

853
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,640
Tell him to hit harder this time.
- Tell who?

854
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,400
Dhoni, who else?

855
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,400
I want a better performance
at the Duleep Trophy this time.

856
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,240
Duleep Trophy?
- Don't you know? - No!

857
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,400
He's been selected
from the East Zone.

858
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,160
It was published
in the newspaper today.

859
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,840
He has a match against Central
Zone day after, in Agartala.

860
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,240
Show him today's newspaper.

861
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,960
Give me the newspaper.
- Here.

862
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,440
There.
- Take a look.

863
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,880
He doesn't know.

864
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,040
Hold this, hold this!
- What happened?

865
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,160
You go home,
something important has come up.

866
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,560
I'll be right back.

867
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,480
Well, that is..
- Param!

868
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,800
Param!

869
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,480
Do you know Dhoni's been
selected for Duleep Trophy?

870
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,160
Come on.

871
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,560
What..

872
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,200
You've been selected
for Duleep Trophy.

873
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,640
The match is day after tomorrow.

874
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,360
But I didn't receive any letter.

875
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,000
It must be stuck
at some association.

876
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,560
Didn't Mr. Deval inform you?
- No.

877
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,080
I've all the details.

878
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,560
You must report at Dum Dum
Airport at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

879
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,680
But how do I get to
Kolkata tomorrow morning?

880
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,440
We..
- Mahi, go and talk to Mr. Deval.

881
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,120
He'll arrange something.

882
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,280
Sir has asked you to wait.

883
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,880
Gentlemen, let's take a break.

884
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,320
Yes, sir.
- Right, sir.

885
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,720
Give that to me.
- Come..

886
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,440
Yes, Mahi. - Sir, I've been
selected for Duleep Trophy.

887
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,640
Really?

888
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,280
And the match is day after tomorrow
at Agartala

889
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:26,720
and I have to report tomorrow
at Kolkata Airport.

890
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,200
What!
- Sir.

891
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,200
Wait here.

892
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,560
Have you sent a letter for Mahi?

893
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,440
But somebody should have
informed us.

894
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,320
How can he report tomorrow?

895
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,160
But then, he will lose
one big match.

896
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,600
Such a big competition
and you guys are so irresponsible!

897
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,640
Sir.

898
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,440
The news is right.

899
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:58,880
I guess your letter's
stuck at Jamshedpur.

900
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,880
What do I do now?

901
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,400
There's a flight tomorrow
from Kolkata at 9 a.m.

902
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,560
Yes, sir.

903
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,760
You missed the chance.

904
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,840
Sir..
- Sir, should we try by road?

905
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,280
If we leave now,
we'll reach by 9 a.m.

906
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,480
Do you know the condition
of the roads?

907
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,240
Sir, we'll take turns to drive.

908
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,040
No, no, you can't make it.

909
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,680
Just arrange for a car and we'll
handle the rest. - Yes, sir.

910
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,280
The Accounts Department
is also shut.

911
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,680
You guys manage
something on your own.

912
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,400
I'll reimburse your expenses later.
Okay?

913
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,760
Mahi, call me when you get there.

914
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,960
Why would we come here
if we had the money for a car?

915
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:46,720
What a man!

916
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:49,720
I think he didn't forward
the letter. - Will you be quiet?

917
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,400
How will we arrange something
at this late hour?

918
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,160
Let it be.
- What's the problem, Mahi?

919
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,080
We'll manage now.
And get it reimbursed later.

920
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,240
But how?
- Just go and pack your bags.

921
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,880
We'll get the car.
- Go on, come on.

922
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,440
You go on. - Leave..
- Come on, go and pack. Quick!

923
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,600
Do you guys have some money?

924
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,760
What?

925
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,240
You just said that you have money!

926
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,480
My intentions are right,
but I am short of money.

927
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,760
And Mahi must go.

928
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:11,960
We must do something.

929
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,960
Do you have anything?
- I may have something.

930
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:18,080
And you? - Yes..
- I'll take a look.

931
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,640
I'll arrange for something
as well. - Come on.

932
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,240
Let's meet at Deepak's garage
at 12 o'clock tonight.

933
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,600
Okay?
- Come on. Hurry up.

934
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,680
Let's go, let's go.

935
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:25,800
Chittu, you're back home.

936
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,920
Chittu, you're going?
- Yes, I'll be back soon.

937
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,400
We'll pay the rest
after we come back. - Okay.

938
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:49,960
Fine.
- Come on, get in, get in.

939
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,360
He's here!

940
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,040
Come on, give it to me.
- Drive safely. - Bye!

941
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,440
Get in.

942
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,640
Come on.

943
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,800
Bye, Mahi.
All the best!

944
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,520
Param, should I drive?

945
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,160
Mahi, wake up.
We've reached the airport.

946
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,080
Mahi, wake up.
We're here.

947
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:28,240
Quickly. Quickly.

948
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,840
We're here.

949
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,960
Mahi, we worked really hard.
Hit a century for us.

950
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,560
Mahi won't stop,
he'll definitely hit it. - Come on!

951
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,680
Of course, he will.
He'll make a century.

952
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,400
What happened? - The flight
took off half an hour ago.

953
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,640
Mahi..
- I'll be back in two minutes.

954
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,040
Mahi.

955
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,800
Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

956
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,600
You called for me, sir?
- Come in, Satyaprakash.

957
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,640
Doesn't Mahendra Singh Dhoni
play with you?

958
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,680
Yes, sir.

959
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,520
He's my junior. But plays well.

960
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,760
Will he join Railways?

961
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,080
Will he become a ticket-collector?

962
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:22,440
Don't know, sir.

963
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,960
Heard of
Bondamunda Railway Station?

964
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,880
Sir, I'm better off in Kharagpur.

965
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,440
Offer him a job
on behalf of the Railways.

966
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,440
Mahi!

967
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:12,960
Mahi!

968
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:14,480
Chittu.

969
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,120
Mahi!

970
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,040
What happened?

971
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,600
Your dad's looking for you!

972
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,600
Come quickly!

973
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,600
What did you do this time?
- I did nothing.

974
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,880
Maybe, that's why
he's looking for you.

975
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,720
Brother.

976
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,360
Your son will go very far.
- Yes. - Where were you?

977
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:37,800
Congratulations, Mr. Pan Singh.

978
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,400
The Railways has a Sports quota.

979
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,560
And Mr. Animesh loves cricket.

980
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,040
He's looking for a good
wicket-keeper batsman

981
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,680
for the South-Eastern Railways.

982
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,200
And he's had his eye on Mahi
for a long time.

983
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,240
Is his job as a TC confirmed?

984
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,440
Mr. Animesh will test Mahi.

985
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,480
If he passes that,
his job's guaranteed.

986
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,240
He will pass the test.

987
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,960
This is great news.

988
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,760
His first posting
will be in Kharagpur itself.

989
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,840
After that we'll try
to relocate him to Ranchi.

990
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,120
And with everything included

991
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,720
he'll get Rs. 5000 in hand
on the 1st of every month.

992
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:09,200
With the Goddess' blessings,
Mahi will become a ticket-collector.

993
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,720
What more can one ask for?

994
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,560
Why don't you tell dad
if you don't want to go?

995
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,640
Did you see dad's face?
- Yes.

996
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,480
And he'll need money too.

997
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,600
Don't try to sound so responsible.

998
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,400
Tell me something, Sister.

999
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:54,480
Will I ever do
anything with my life?

1000
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,600
Why not!

1001
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,720
Wait and watch, someday you
will be very successful, Mahi.

1002
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:04,680
Satya was saying
that if you do your job well

1003
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:07,080
then you could
be the boss someday.

1004
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:12,880
What happened?

1005
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,800
Should I have said something else?

1006
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:20,640
I will miss all of you.
- Me too.

1007
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,280
Mr. Animesh bowls personally
to every player

1008
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,640
before selecting him for the team.

1009
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,480
You just play well.

1010
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,640
What does he normally bowl?
- Everything.

1011
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:40,960
On his own?
- Yes.

1012
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:53,920
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

1013
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,320
Dhoni, sir.
- Good morning, sir.

1014
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,960
I've heard a lot about you.

1015
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,440
Wear your pads.
- Yes, sir.

1016
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,680
Is it too fast?

1017
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,520
Should I bowl slower?
- No, sir. It's fine.

1018
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:07,840
Try that again.

1019
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:13,800
Catch it!

1020
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,760
Dhoni, I'm going to bowl
a bouncer next.

1021
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:19,960
Wear your helmet.

1022
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,200
Sir, sir!

1023
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,360
Sir.

1024
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,640
Please get out or
he will keep bowling all day.

1025
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,760
Your job depends on it.

1026
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,560
I won't get out to get a job.

1027
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,920
Well played, good shot.

1028
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,440
Sir.
- Your bat swings are really good.

1029
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:07,960
But try to hit straight.

1030
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,200
Play in the V,
mid-off and mid-on.

1031
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:11,880
And don't hit too many
over-the-heads.

1032
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:12,880
Yes, sir.

1033
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,720
Practice every day
after your duty hours.

1034
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,520
You practice as much as you work.

1035
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,200
Would you be able do it?
- Yes, sir.

1036
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:20,960
The railway trials
are in two months.

1037
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,960
You must perform well.
- Yes, sir.

1038
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,120
You can join duty next week.
- Thank you, sir.

1039
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,400
Amazing.

1040
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:32,360
Very good.

1041
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:38,040
Are these the quarters?
- No, they're at the back.

1042
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,320
That is Mr. Animesh's bungalow.

1043
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,960
The one adjacent
to the boundary wall.

1044
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,760
He's made a cement pitch out there.

1045
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,120
And we stay here

1046
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,040
so that he can call us for practice
any time he wants.

1047
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,200
Come.

1048
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,400
Come in.

1049
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,360
Can I keep this here?
- Yes.

1050
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,200
There are two rooms here.
- Yes.

1051
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,160
This one

1052
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,040
and this one.

1053
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:24,880
Close that door.

1054
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,600
If you don't close that door,
you can't open this one.

1055
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,640
I see.

1056
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,400
Come.

1057
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,200
This is the bathroom

1058
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:35,760
and this is the kitchen.

1059
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,200
There's tea, sugar,
vegetables, everything.

1060
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,880
Every ingredient to cook a meal.

1061
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:41,960
Great.

1062
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,000
Come.

1063
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,760
And this is our garden.

1064
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,440
In the railways,
gardens are bigger than the rooms.

1065
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,040
We have planted trees here.

1066
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:00,720
Come.

1067
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,800
Always keep this door closed.
- Yes.

1068
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,560
Sometimes snakes crawl in.
- Through here?

1069
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,560
Yes.

1070
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:11,960
It's nice, quite big.

1071
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,840
No, three other guys live here.
- Okay.

1072
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,320
They have their day shift,
they'll be here soon.

1073
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,840
I told Mr. Das
not to teach me all that.

1074
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,960
That was right, Deepak.

1075
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:23,960
They are here.

1076
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,080
Hey! - How's everything?
- Just great.

1077
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,480
Remember I told you about Mahi?
- Yes.

1078
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:30,520
This is him.

1079
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,760
Mahi, this is Robin.
- Hello.

1080
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,280
Deepak, Jayesh.
- Hello.

1081
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,400
He's too young.
How could they give him a job?

1082
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,240
Play a match with him
and you will know. - Really?

1083
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,800
Yes! - But where will you sleep?
- Anywhere.

1084
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:41,720
Doesn't matter.

1085
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,320
Eat your meal
and hit the sack early. - Okay.

1086
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,920
You should've seen how
he whacked Mr. Animesh's balls

1087
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:45,800
all over the ground.

1088
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,200
He bowled a spinner
and he hit it for a six.

1089
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,120
Fast ball, again six.

1090
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,560
Six, six, six..

1091
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,720
Mister, where does Mr. Sarkar sit?
- There.

1092
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,120
There?
- Yes, in the opposite room.

1093
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Just a second.

1094
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,560
Good morning, sir.

1095
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,760
Mahendra Singh Dhoni
reporting, sir.

1096
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,200
Come.
- Sir.

1097
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,640
This is your table and chair.
- Sir.

1098
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,120
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning. File this.

1099
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,080
Okay, sir.

1100
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,920
Did you take your 'picking-up duty'?
- I did yesterday.

1101
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,400
That's Mr. Das.
- Good morning, sir.

1102
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,120
And that's Mr. Singh.
- Good morning, sir.

1103
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,200
8013 UP will arrive
on Platform No. 1.

1104
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,520
It was supposed to arrive
at 8:30 a.m.

1105
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,440
but it's running late.

1106
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:41,720
Find out the arrival time.
- Sir!

1107
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,480
You will find Ghoshal
in the TC compartment.

1108
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,520
Give him this paper

1109
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,600
and keep whatever he gives you.
- Sir.

1110
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:50,120
8029 DOWN will arrive
on Platform No. 2 at 9:30 a.m.

1111
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,440
You will find Shukla there.

1112
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,880
Give him this paper

1113
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,600
and then keep the sheet
that he gives you.

1114
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,600
Go.
- Okay, sir.

1115
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,080
8013 UP Platform No. 1, Ghoshal.

1116
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,920
8029 DOWN, No. 2,
Shukla at 9.30 a.m.

1117
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:06,480
Excuse me!

1118
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:07,800
Move aside!

1119
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,840
'The train will now
arrive on Platform No. 3'

1120
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:14,320
'instead of Platform No. 1
at 9.30 a.m.'

1121
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,240
'Your attention please.'

1122
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,040
'8013 UP Steel Express'

1123

1124
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,200
'than its expected time.'

1125
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:26,920

'Thank you.'

1128
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:32,600
Both will arrive at the same time!

1129
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:33,840
'May I have your attention please!'

1130
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,920
'8013 UP Steel Express'

1131
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,600
'from Tata to Howrah,
is running late by one hour.'

1132
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,640
Sir, sir.. Mr. Shukla..

1133
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:59,360
Who is Shukla?
I'm Abhijeet Ghoshal.

1134
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,360
Here you go.
- Do you have the ticket?

1135
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,280
Go and check there.

1136
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,040
This is for 8029 DOWN.

1137
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,080
Sir.
- Where do you want to go?

1138
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,960
Sir, this one.

1139
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,440
Just a minute. I'll check.

1140
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:09,520
Please hurry up, the other train's
leaving. I've another copy..

1141
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,320
Stop yelling.. - Just a minute.
- ...and let me do my work.

1142
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:13,600
I'm giving it to you.

1143
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,480
Sir, help me with my seat, please.
- Come here.

1144
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,200
Sir, check my ticket, please.

1145
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,440
Here you go.

1146
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,040
Move aside, please!

1147
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:29,960
One second, one second.

1148
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,520
Sir, both the trains
arrived at the same time.

1149
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,040
I tried, but..
- How hard did you try?

1150
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,920
Sir, I tried my best.
- Fine.

1151
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,040
Train no. 465 is arriving.
- Sir.

1152
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,480
Take the fine book and go
to Gate No. 3. - Okay, sir.

1153
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,640
All of them are repeat offenders.

1154
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:17,920
Fine them heavily.

1155
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,000
Okay, sir.
- Now, go.

1156
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,800
How is Dhoni doing?

1157
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,840
He missed a train on the first day.

1158
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:27,080
And I already gave him
the 'Platform No. 3' experience.

1159
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:30,160
He's your responsibility, Sarkar.
- Yes, sir.

1160
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,280
He's a special case.
- No worries, sir.

1161
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,520
But Mr. Das and Mr. Singh

1162
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:40,240
are not taking his recruitment
too well.

1163
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,240
We'll see.

1164
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,960
May I ask you something, sir?

1165
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:45,240
Yes.

1166
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:47,680
What's so special about him?

1167
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,200
Do you still play cricket?

1168
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,000
Sometimes, sir.

1169
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:59,400
Play one match with him
and you will find out.

1170
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:10,240
You're back, Mahi!
- Yes.

1171
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:15,280
How was your first day?
- It was a Yorker.

1172
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,080
Eat something,
we have to go and practice.

1173
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,680
Are you catching a ball or a fish?

1174
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,280
Catch! Oh!

1175
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:33,680
Well taken!

1176
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,600
Very good!

1177
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:39,440
Very nice!

1178
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:45,680
Please move.

1179
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,120
Ticket!
Your ticket, please!

1180
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:46,480
Come, Dilip.

1181
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,040
Morning, sir.
- Good morning.

1182
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:49,800
Sit.
- Thank you.

1183
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,720
How are you?
- All well, sir.

1184
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:55,480
Did you see yesterday's match?

1185
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:56,840
I did, sir.

1186
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:58,800
The boys have done us proud.

1187
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,920
Kaif and Yuvraj were brilliant.

1188
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,080
They were too good.

1189
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,240
John is doing everything right.

1190
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:09,680
Whether Sourav should have taken
off his jersey is still debatable.

1191
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,680
Otherwise, Indian Cricket
is in good hands.

1192
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,240
We must think about
the future as well.

1193
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:15,920
Of course. Of course.

1194
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,400
Last year,
Makarand Waingankar joined

1195
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:21,200
Karnataka State Cricket Association
as a consultant.

1196
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,800
Makarand has achieved
some fantastic results

1197
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,880
in getting new talents
from smaller districts.

1198
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,400
Some really good players
are coming up

1199
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,040
who are outperforming
these state-level players.

1200
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:35,040
BCCI would like to do
the same thing.

1201
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,280
We want to open TRDW

1202
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,320
which is the
Talent Research Development Wing.

1203
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:44,000
And the focus
will be on B-tier towns.

1204
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:45,200
Sounds nice, sir.

1205
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,120
But this will only work when

1206
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,880
this body reports
directly to the Board.

1207
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,560
If it goes through
the State Cricket Association..

1208
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:52,920
Precisely.

1209
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,040
TRDW will report directly
to the board

1210
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,920
and the players
will be sent directly

1211
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,400
to the National Cricket Academy.

1212
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,920
The board wants to appoint
you as the Chairman.

1213
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:05,720
What do you say?

1214
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:09,560
Sir, I'll be honoured.
- Good.

1215
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,640
Brijesh will assist you.

1216
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,240
Think about the structure.
- Sure.

1217
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:16,560
Let me call a meeting next week

1218
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,960
and let's get this going.
- Sure, sir. Sure.

1219
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:27,400
Keep that file on my table
in the morning. - Okay, sir.

1220
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,080
Dhoni. Why are you sitting here?

1221
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:42,640
Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

1222
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,720
Just like that, sir.

1223
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:44,800
Sit, sit.

1224
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:47,240
Sit.

1225
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,240
Sir, my roommates
are out on duty.

1226
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:55,480
So, whether I sit in my room
or here, it's the same thing.

1227
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,600
And what were you thinking?
- Nothing, sir.

1228
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,320
Just like that..
Nothing important.

1229
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,040
You should open up.

1230
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:04,720
It lightens your heart.

1231
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,160
Sir, I keep wondering
as to what I am doing.

1232
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,080
I'm a cricketer, but working
as a TC at Kharagpur Station.

1233
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,760
It's not that I think
the job is small.

1234
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,440
But I don't know
how I'll play ahead.

1235
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:23,120
Only I know what's going on
in my life every day.

1236
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:27,440
First I jog between
8013 UP and 8029 DOWN.

1237
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:30,640
Then I stand at Gate No. 3
and collect fines.

1238
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,000
Neither my game's improving

1239
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,160
nor am I getting any
opportunity to progress.

1240
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:36,720
Still playing 'Ranji'.

1241
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:39,920
How long will this go on?

1242
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,360
Sometimes I feel like quitting
everything and going back.

1243
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,920
But then I think of dad.

1244
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:50,160
Every night when
I return to my room

1245
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:53,200
I feel like I'm returning
to the pavilion after getting out.

1246
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,840
You asked why I'm sitting here.

1247
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,400
This is what I keep thinking
no matter where I sit.

1248
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:08,640
Oh, God!
Were you thinking all that?

1249
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:13,080
Sorry, sir..
But I'm start feeling depressed.

1250
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,680
Well, tell me something.

1251
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,280
What do you do when
you get bowled a full toss?

1252
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:23,760
Sir?

1253
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:26,440
What do you do when
you get bowled a full toss?

1254
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,160
I hit it.

1255
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:30,960
And a juicy half-volley?
- Drive.

1256
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,520
If it's a good out-swinger?

1257
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:33,760
Leave it.

1258
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,240
If it's a good in-swinger?

1259
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:39,560
Defend. - And when you get
an unplayable bouncer?

1260
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,560
I duck.
- That's it. That's life.

1261
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:47,960
Imagine that all these are bouncers
and you need to duck.

1262
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,440
Don't think too much.

1263
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:52,960
You won't get
the same ball each time.

1264
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:55,640
You've to play on your merit
and stand your ground.

1265
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:59,000
The scoreboard will keep moving.

1266
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:01,760
Sir.

1267
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:05,080
And don't worry too much
about your job.

1268
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,720
As long as I'm here, you can play

1269
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,440
anywhere you want,
whenever you want.

1270
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:13,320
I will take care of your attendance.
Don't worry.

1271
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:15,600
Thank you, sir.

1272
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:19,080
Sir, may I play
the tennis tournament?

1273
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,040
They play on 18 yards
instead of 22.

1274
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:24,360
But I think it will be good for me.
- Yes, of course. Go and play.

1275
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,800
But everyone's saying
it will ruin my game.

1276
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,400
Ruin your game?
- Yes, sir.

1277
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:29,840
Which fool says that?
- Sir..

1278
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,840
Your game hasn't improved yet
that it will get ruined.

1279
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:35,400
Your plus point is that
you're a complete natural.

1280
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:36,880
Understood?
- Sir.

1281
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,160
Let's go.

1282
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:39,360
Come on.

1283
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:43,080
Don't be too serious for
absolutely no reason. Understand?

1284
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:44,840
And why aren't you
cutting your hair?

1285
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:47,200
I'm thinking about letting it grow.

1286
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,400
And you must work
on your spoken English.

1287
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:50,360
Yes.

1288
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,040
It will come in handy
in the future. - Yes, sir.

1289
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:57,680
"The path is studded with stones.
I don't care."

1290
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:01,920
"The guise of dreams are blurred.
I don't care."

1291
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:05,200
"My heart is imploded.
Let it be."

1292
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:09,640
"Now come what may,
I don't care."

1293
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:32,720
"Chancily acts my heart and
recklessly does what it wants."

1294
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:37,120
"Wildly beats my heart
just like a thunderbolt."

1295
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:42,040
"It looks for odds in the cloud
and shares an untamed courage."

1296
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,080
Just two more steps
and straight to the Indian Team.

1297
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,640
Exactly.
- For sure! - Yes.

1298
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,440
Listen carefully, Mahi.

1299
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:50,480
First see where the selectors
are sitting. - Okay.

1300
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,200
And hit a six towards them.
- Okay.

1301
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,720
"I don't care!"
- Play well!

1302
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,800
"I don't care!"

1303
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:03,440
Next.

1304
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:12,160
Mishra, next.

1305
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:14,080
Where do they come from?

1306
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:15,520
Look at his hair.

1307
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:18,920
Yes, Mahi. How was it?

1308
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,600
I only got three balls for keeping
and one over for batting.

1309
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:23,760
Why do they call if that's
all they want you to do?

1310
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:24,960
Did they treat everyone like that?

1311
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:26,800
No, I guess I was the special case.

1312
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:31,000
"Whether it's false or true,
dreams are dreams."

1313
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:33,200
"You can keep
the light of the stars."

1314
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:35,400
"All the fireflies are mine."

1315
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:38,160
"Wildly beats my heart,
unstoppable it is."

1316
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:40,360
"My heart beats with
an untamed courage"

1317
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:41,960
"stubborn is it's throbbing."

1318
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,880
"Be it make or break!"

1319
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,280
"I don't care!"

1320
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,680
"I don't care!"

1321
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,080
"I don't care!"

1322
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:00,080
"I don't care!"

1323
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:06,680
This can't go on!
- He hasn't come in to work again.

1324
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:11,120
I'm worried about Mahi.

1325
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,560
He's going nowhere.

1326
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:14,760
He quit everything

1327
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,680
and ran away to Dhanbad
to you for six months.

1328
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:19,880
There was a huge ruckus
in the office.

1329
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:22,400
Mahi's game has reached
a completely different level.

1330
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:25,640
Do you know? He's hit
25-30 centuries in six months!

1331
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,000
And when he's batting

1332
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,720
it feels like he's venting his anger.
- Exactly!

1333
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,240
He's so talented
that sometimes I fear

1334
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:33,280
he'll do something wrong
out of frustration.

1335
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,120
Let's go.

1336
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,120
Yes, everything's fine. - I tried
explaining things to him, but..

1337
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:40,360
Travelling all over
Bihar and Jharkhand.

1338
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:42,880
Ask me where I haven't played!

1339
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,200
Well, I'm in a bad mood nowadays,
so only playing football.

1340
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,520
Okay, I'm hanging up now.
Talk to you later.

1341
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:51,600
Bye.

1342
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:54,680
How's everything, Mahi?

1343
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:00,880
Hey!

1344
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:06,600
This is exactly what
I was talking about.

1345
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:10,360
I think he's gone crazy.
- What happened?

1346
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:12,520
The phone's not been
working since 15 days.

1347
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:14,200
The line's dead.

1348
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:15,240
The phone's dead?
- Yes.

1349
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,600
Who was he talking to?

1350
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:20,880
What will we do now?

1351
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:22,880
The phone's actually dead.
- I know!

1352
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:26,240
His family will say, I took him
to Kharagpur and drove him insane.

1353
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:29,040
Well, I feel..
- Hey!

1354
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:34,120
What?
- What's this, Mahi?

1355
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,160
What's all this?
- You got worried! - Go away!

1356
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:41,960
W-Why are you hitting me?

1357
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:52,880
'Shot pulled away for 4 by
Tendulkar.' - Wow! - What a shot!

1358
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:54,560
Catch up! - That wasn't from
the middle of the bat.

1359
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:56,120
That's Sachin!
- The ball is coming slow.

1360
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,480
Wow.

1361
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:00,120
Great.

1362
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:03,160
Wonderful, Sachin..
- 'Up in the air..'

1363
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:06,320
'McGrath underneath it!'
- Oh, no!

1364
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:08,040
'India lose their first wicket..'
- What the heck!

1365
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,960
Why did you have to play that shot?
- 'Sachin Tendulkar..'

1366
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:11,560
What kind of a shot was that?
- He should've asked you

1367
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:12,880
before he played that shot.
- We've lost the World Cup!

1368
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:16,640
Does anyone want tea?
- These guys will definitely lose it.

1369
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:19,760
Don't say that. Please don't
say such negative things.

1370
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,160
Be quiet and stop bothering me.

1371
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:26,880
Didn't Kaif, Mongia and Yuvraj
start at the same time as Mahi?

1372
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:27,880
Yes.

1373
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,160
All of them have
played the World Cup.

1374
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,960
I wonder what's going
to happen to Mahi.

1375
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,440
Can you speak a little softer?

1376
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:48,080
No, sir.

1377
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:50,280
I understand, sir.

1378
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,440
Excuse me, sir.
Sir.

1379
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:55,240
I will definitely look into it.

1380
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:56,880
Thank you, sir.
Bye.

1381
01:31:58,240 --> 01:31:59,240
Sir, you called for me.

1382
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,720
A notice has been
sent in your name.

1383
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,040
Someone's complained about you.

1384
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:05,080
About your attendance.

1385
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:10,040
Sir, the bouncers don't
seem to stop coming.

1386
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:12,760
I've been ducking
for three years now. And now this.

1387
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:16,280
Look, Mahi, the enquiry
is day after tomorrow at 10 a.m.

1388
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:18,880
Two officers are coming down
from the Head Office.

1389
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:20,720
I have a suggestion.

1390
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,960
Before they can question you

1391
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,800
you have your defence ready..

1392
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:32,920
Did you understand?

1393
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,760
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

1394
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:41,240
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

1395
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:44,160
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

1396
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:56,120
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

1397
01:34:56,320 --> 01:35:02,160
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

1398
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:31,920
Bless you.
When did you arrive?

1399
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:33,480
In the evening.

1400
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,480
All okay?
- Yes.

1401
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:38,600
You've lost weight.
Have you been eating properly?

1402
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:40,480
Yes, it's all okay.

1403
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:43,120
I hope you will
stay longer this time.

1404
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:45,720
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

1405
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:46,880
Yes, tell me.

1406
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:50,520
I'm quitting
my job with the Railways.

1407
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,120
I cannot handle both.

1408
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:01,000
I can either work or play cricket.

1409
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,280
If I concentrate on cricket,
the head office sends a notice.

1410
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:06,800
So I've decided to shift
my focus entirely on the game.

1411
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:07,960
And then we'll see.

1412
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:09,680
I just want to play cricket now.
- And when

1413
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:11,640
you grow old
and can't play anymore

1414
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:13,800
how will you make ends meet?

1415
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:15,560
You can't play cricket forever.

1416
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:18,360
I will find another job,
don't worry.

1417
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:23,760
Since you've decided already,
do what you want.

1418
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,280
You don't have to tell me anything.

1419
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:29,720
Dad, please don't say that.

1420
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:33,360
If I get caught up with
this security of a daily job

1421
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,560
then I will never move up in life.

1422
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,560
Just give me some time.

1423
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,640
I just want to give it
one last try.

1424
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,160
If nothing concrete
happens in a year

1425
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,000
then I will do as you say.

1426
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:45,800
You shouldn't have
quit your job, Mahi.

1427
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:47,240
Dad..
- No, no.

1428
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:55,040
Welcome, audience.

1429
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:58,680
East Zone Vs. Central Zone,
for the Deodhar Trophy.

1430
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:01,120
A very important match
is being played today.

1431
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:04,840
The 'Talent Research Development
Wing' officers are sitting here.

1432
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:08,560
And they will keep an eye
out for talented players.

1433
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:11,720
'Check where
the selectors are sitting.'

1434
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:13,640
'And hit your six towards them.'

1435
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:29,560
And the first ball of the over.

1436
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:35,000
Oh, my God, that's a six!

1437
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:37,560
Six!

1438
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:40,040
Beautiful!

1439
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,360
And he has swung his bat again.

1440
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,840
Yes, Prakash.

1441
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:52,120
Yes, I've heard his name.

1442
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:54,120
Really?

1443
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:57,360
And again!
- What a shot. Wonderful.

1444
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:00,920
Who is that player?
- Good morning, sir.

1445
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:02,360
Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

1446
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:05,480
Where is he from? - Jharkhand.
- He plays really well, sir.

1447
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:07,880
He hits really big sixes.

1448
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:10,040
He's batting really well.
- Absolutely, sir.

1449
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,720
Very nice.

1450
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:15,960
Dinesh Karthik,
extremely talented.

1451
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:19,160
Naman Ojha, he's a safe
wicket-keeper and an okay batsman.

1452
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,840
Mahendra Singh Dhoni
and Deep Dasgupta.

1453
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:24,520
Dhoni's performance in the
Deodhar Trophy was quite good.

1454
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:28,200
He's a good batsman but his
keeping technique is very poor.

1455
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:30,520
But Gopal,
technique isn't everything.

1456
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:32,920
If he's getting results
with his poor technique

1457
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,480
then I don't
see a problem in that.

1458
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:35,840
Look, sir, in my opinion..
- One second, one second.

1459
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:39,080
Does he have poor technique
or is he an unconventional player?

1460
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,120
There's a difference
between the two.

1461
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:47,760
Great shot!

1462
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:51,120
Mahi! - You've been selected
in the India A Team!

1463
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:53,600
You're in the Zimbabwe
and Kenya Tour! Yes!

1464
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,480
Mahi, it's published in the papers.

1465
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,800
Come on.

1466
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:01,960
Didn't you hear, Mahi?

1467
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:05,320
Mahi!

1468
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,520
We're giving him good news
and he isn't listening.

1469
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:08,680
Let's go, celebrate.

1470
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:10,280
You guys go on,
I'll finish the game and join you.

1471
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:14,040
He's unbelievable. We're going
to celebrate. - Yes, let's go.

1472
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:28,720
Mahi, one more game?
- One second.

1473
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:45,640
I'll go now, it's time.
- Bless you.

1474
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:47,360
And keep calling.
- Okay.

1475
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:49,080
Take care.
- Take care and eat properly.

1476
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:50,280
Mahi, your train is about to leave.

1477
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:51,920
I'll call you.
- Yes, please.

1478
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:53,600
We'll miss you. Take care.

1479
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:54,880
Sir.. - Come on.
- All the best.

1480
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:56,720
Come on, get on.

1481
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:59,040
The train's leaving.

1482
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:00,760
Take care, Mahi.

1483
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,560
Hit it out of the park!

1484
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:05,160
Bye. Bye.
- Bye!

1485
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,880
Play well and take care, Mahi!

1486
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:31,880
Go Mahi!

1487
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:36,080
The Man of the Match
and hands down..

1488
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:38,040
All the commentators..
M.S. Dhoni!

1489
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:42,480
I'll request you to give away
the Man of the Match Award.

1490
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:45,480
You seem to be in love
with this pitch.

1491
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:48,240
Yes, definitely. This is
a very good wicket to bat on.

1492
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:51,200
Apart from first 10 overs.

1493
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:54,080
After the shine is gone, I think

1494
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,360
it's all for the games
that are played by the batsman.

1495
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,200
Here comes Mahi!

1496
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:02,600
There he is.
- Amazing!

1497
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:06,720
Hi!
- Why is everyone here?

1498
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,120
How are you, Mahi?

1499
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:09,840
Bless you. How are you?
- Hi, Mahi.

1500
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:14,600
Sir, one photograph.
One photo.

1501
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:17,720
Sir, a bit to the left.
Smile please, sir.

1502
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:23,720
Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

1503
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:24,880
Dhoni.

1504
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,280
Dinesh Karthik.

1505
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:27,800
Dhoni.

1506
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:30,560
Sourav?
- Let's try Dhoni.

1507
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:35,520
Goodnight.
- Bye, goodnight.

1508
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:14,080
India has got off to
a very slow start here.

1509
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:15,960
Now let's see how
the match progresses.

1510
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,960
They really need a partnership
at this point of time.

1511
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:20,840
Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the
debutant is coming in to bat.

1512
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:23,840
India are really under
pressure at 180 for 5. - Mahi!

1513
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:26,280
Let's see what the boy from
Ranchi can do.

1514
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,000
He's an explosive
wicket-keeper - batsman.

1515
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:29,960
Mohammad Rafique
continues to bowl.

1516
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:34,400
Chance of a run out!
He's got him!

1517
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:36,480
Mahendra Singh Dhoni!

1518
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:39,160
Why did he have to run?
- What happened?

1519
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:42,440
Kaif called for a run
and sent him back.

1520
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,200
It's his fault. He got him out.

1521
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:45,160
Chittu, enough.

1522
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:47,040
Dhoni's just short
of his crease.

1523
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:48,960
This can be a turning
point in the match.

1524
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:50,480
What happened?
- Run out!

1525
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:53,320
He's always so impatient!
Got out on the first ball.

1526
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:56,880
How about some tea?

1527
01:42:56,920 --> 01:43:00,120
Has to depart in his
first One Day International.

1528
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:03,720
And that must be
a huge disappointment

1529
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,400
to the very, very young,
talented man.

1530
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:10,360
Tapash Baisya bowling right-arm
over, medium pace to Dhoni.

1531
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:12,840
Struggling with timing.
- No, no, no, wait, wait.

1532
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,280
It's not an easy track.
- Careful.

1533
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:16,320
The ball not quite coming
on to the bat. - Hit it.

1534
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,120
Beaten again outside the off stump.
- What is this boy doing?

1535
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:21,680
The ball not really bouncing.
- Calm down.

1536
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:24,520
Can't he be a bit patient?

1537
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:29,880
Taken at short mid-wicket.
Good sharp catch by Bangladesh.

1538
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:32,720
And they would feel
that they've..

1539
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:34,320
What's he doing?
- ...got their foot into the door

1540
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:36,280
in this massive contest.

1541
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:39,520
He only has one match now.

1542
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:41,160
He won't get so many opportunities.
- It's okay.

1543
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:44,520
I think that's a no-ball.
- Stop it, Chittu.

1544
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:47,280
Catch at mid-wicket..
- How about some tea?

1545
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:52,280
And Dhoni is gone for 12
and India are 155 for 6.

1546
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:00,680
Now this has been an excellent
batting display from the Indians.

1547
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:03,640
What.. What great stroke play!

1548
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:07,880
Pitched up
and Dhoni climbs into it!

1549
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:12,480
That's huge! It's a six!

1550
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:16,360
India 347 for 5.
- Yes.

1551
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:17,880
Why does he keep hitting sixes?

1552
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:21,040
How about some tea?

1553
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,400
He was in great form today.

1554
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:27,480
If he had played
higher up in the order

1555
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:28,520
he would've definitely
scored a century.

1556
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:29,600
Stop it, Chittu.

1557
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:31,640
I wonder what's
going to happen now.

1558
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:34,280
He only made 19 runs
in 3 matches.

1559
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:37,520
I wonder if he'll get a chance
in the Pakistan Tour.

1560
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:41,120
India's run-rate has come down
a little bit in the last 5 overs.

1561
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:42,720
Dravid is set here.

1562
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,360
It's in the air!
Six!

1563
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:52,320
And taken at deep mid-wicket.

1564
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,280
You should start praying.

1565
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:56,240
He should've played defensively.

1566
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:57,920
Only 3.5 overs to go.

1567
01:44:58,120 --> 01:44:59,880
He was playing for
the team not himself.

1568
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:04,080
So, Dhoni departs and a string
of low scores continues.

1569
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:06,240
What are you doing?

1570
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:10,400
And why doesn't he cut his hair?

1571
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:12,120
I wonder how he'll
stay in the team.

1572
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:13,440
Let's see where the
match goes from here.

1573
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:37,120
Excuse me.
- Yes, ma'am.

1574
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:39,400
Can you please get me
Sachin's autograph? Please.

1575
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:41,840
Sorry, ma'am,
the cricketers are very tired.

1576
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:43,800
And they have requested
to be left alone.

1577
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:45,480
I hope you understand.

1578
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:57,720
Hi.
- Hi.

1579
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:02,800
Are you with the cricket team?
- Yes.

1580
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:05,760
Do you know Sachin?

1581
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:09,480
Yes.

1582
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:11,280
Can you please get
me his autograph?

1583
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:14,400
No.. - Please. - No..
- Please..

1584
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:15,840
I'm his biggest fan.

1585
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:17,240
But right now..
- Please!

1586
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:22,960
What's your name?
- Priyanka.

1587
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:25,320
Priyanka.. - Please..
- Give it to me.

1588
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:26,640
Thank you.

1589
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:29,640
His condition was really
surprising.. - I know!

1590
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:32,480
Sir, one autograph please.
- Sure.

1591
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:34,360
She is a huge fan of yours.

1592
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:37,920
Priyanka.

1593
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:44,240
Thank you.

1594
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:49,560
Thank you.

1595
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:58,840
What do you do?

1596
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:02,920
I'm a keeper-batsman.

1597
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:04,720
Oh?
- In the Indian Team.

1598
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:12,200
Sorry, I didn't know.
- Why are you sorry?

1599
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:16,560
You don't know because I have not
done anything worth remembering.

1600
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:21,280
In four matches I have
0, 12, 7 not out and a 3.

1601
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:25,360
I don't know whether I'll get
a chance to play the next match.

1602
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:27,360
It's okay.

1603
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:50,000
If you keep staring at me,
how will I sleep?

1604
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,760
Sorry.

1605
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:00,760
You know what.

1606
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:06,560
You will get to play tomorrow

1607
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:08,840
and you will have a great match.

1608
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,920
How come you're so sure?

1609
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:18,560
Just one of those things.

1610
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:21,680
All the best.

1611
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:27,840
If it really happens
and if I want to thank you

1612
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:30,520
then how can I..

1613
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:32,640
I mean..

1614
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:36,000
So, ma'am?

1615
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:46,440
Thank you.

1616
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:48,360
Your name?

1617
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:52,320
Watch it on TV tomorrow.

1618
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,760
Yes, Santosh.
- How are you, Mahi?

1619
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:21,360
Fine, but you've been
drinking again.

1620
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:25,480
No, Mahi, I swear, not at all.
- Swear on me.

1621
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:28,560
Let it be.

1622
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,160
Santosh,
I'm going to beat you up.

1623
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,280
You always..
- Let's talk about cricket.

1624
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:37,640
Why don't they move you up?
- They were saying

1625
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:39,640
that they will try sending me in
at No.3 in some game.

1626
01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:42,520
But I have no clue whether
I'm in tomorrow's match.

1627
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:45,640
I'll call you later.

1628
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:51,800
Hello. - 'Dhoni, you're in the 11.'
- Thanks, Dada.

1629
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:52,960
Good luck.

1630
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:02,960
That's it.

1631
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:08,880
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1632
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:13,480
Mahi, take a look.

1633
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:24,720
Chisel 50 grams more.
- Okay.

1634
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:27,520
Here, chisel off 50 grams more.

1635
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,760
Mahendra Singh Dhoni
promoted up the order.

1636
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:38,160
Looking to get the full Monty.

1637
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:40,440
Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

1638
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:45,720
Why are you bathing
since so long? Come out.

1639
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:48,440
I don't want to watch
the match today.

1640
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:55,240
Drives and drives well through the
off-side. Finds the boundary!

1641
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:02,720
Yay!

1642
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:06,160
That's beautifully timed,
through the off-side.

1643
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:09,560
He finds the fence again.
And a half century

1644
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:11,640
for Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

1645
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:14,760
I've always been saying
that Mahi should go in early.

1646
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,160
Stop it, Chittu.

1647
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:23,360
Yes!

1648
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:29,800
Don't throw your wicket.
Well done.

1649
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:37,840
It's outside the boundary.

1650
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:40,120
Mister, give me a carom board.
- I don't have it.

1651
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:41,360
There's one right beside you.

1652
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:42,640
It got drenched in the rain
and the wood has swollen up.

1653
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:44,440
But it's all wrapped up.

1654
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:47,320
Do you know better or do we?
Who's the shop-keeper?

1655
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:49,840
Come back tomorrow. - What
kind of a shop-keeper are you?

1656
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:07,160
There he goes on the on-side!

1657
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:11,400
What happened?
- Nothing, you continue.

1658
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:15,920
He pumps the air in delight.

1659
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:19,240
A first One Day International 100
for Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

1660
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:20,480
Bravo.

1661
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:25,760
And it's always a great feeling,
getting your first ever 100

1662
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:27,760
in One Day International cricket
for your country.

1663
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:31,720
And it's obvious that this
young man is thrilled to bits.

1664
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:35,960
Later, boy, later.

1665
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:40,480
Sir. Mahi played very well.

1666
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:41,960
Take some more, sir.

1667
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:44,640
Hello, ma'am.

1668
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:46,120
Give everyone, everyone.
- Mahi played really well.

1669
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:47,240
Take some sweets.

1670
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:50,200
You too, ma'am.

1671
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:54,240
Hello, sir.
Mahi was amazing yesterday.

1672
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:14,240
'You will get to play tomorrow'

1673
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:16,240
'and you will have a great match.'

1674
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:47,920
Hello.
- Hello.

1675
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:50,880
Priyanka?
- Speaking.

1676
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:52,680
Thanks.

1677
01:53:55,720 --> 01:53:56,880
Hello.

1678
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:01,920
Congratulations,
Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

1679
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:04,600
Thank you.

1680
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:08,240
Everyone in India
now knows your name.

1681
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:11,040
Maybe someone's prayers worked.

1682
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:13,960
Maybe?

1683
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:16,680
Would you like to meet?

1684
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:19,920
You will have to come to Delhi.
That's where I live.

1685
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:22,280
I came to Vizag on
official business.

1686
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:24,440
I'm at the airport,
heading back home.

1687
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:26,120
Oh!

1688
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:30,160
By the way,
if you change your mind

1689
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:31,840
then Delhi isn't too far.

1690
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:36,040
It wouldn't have mattered
even if it had been far.

1691
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:38,040
See you soon.

1692
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:40,960
I'll be waiting
for your autograph.

1693
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:43,360
Bye.

1694
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:17,480
"This moment stands still."

1695
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:23,240
"It is mine and yours."

1696
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:27,840
"Let me live this
moment to the fullest."

1697
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:34,960
"I'll be lost in you and
you'll be lost in me."

1698
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:39,400
"We'll find each other
sometime again."

1699
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:43,560
"I'll keep seeing you."

1700
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:46,320
"You'll keep seeing me."

1701
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:52,560
"We'll see each other
sometime again. Sometime again."

1702
01:56:14,360 --> 01:56:18,760
"Why does it hum
without a reason?"

1703
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:24,040
"Why does it smile
without a reason?"

1704
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:29,800
"My eyes have begun to glitter."

1705
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:35,920
"How shall I conceal
my dreams now?"

1706
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:41,720
"Say words that are fragrant"

1707
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:47,720
"fill your eyes with laughter."

1708
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:52,800
"This bewilderment,
where else to look!"

1709
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:59,280
"I'll be lost in you and
you'll be lost in me."

1710
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:04,840
"We'll find each other
sometime again."

1711
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:10,560
"I'll keep seeing you.
You'll keep seeing me."

1712
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:15,560
"We'll see each other
sometime again."

1713
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:18,400
"Sometime again."

1714
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:31,520
Hair, hair.
One second.

1715
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,480
Do I look at this one or that one?

1716
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:36,160
Okay. On action?
- Yes!

1717
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:38,120
Finolex pipes are..

1718
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:39,760
I forgot my lines.

1719
01:57:40,160 --> 01:57:42,080
Action! - The secret
behind my active life.

1720
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,920
Low fat cooking with
Nature Fresh Acti-Lite Oil.

1721
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:47,920
Whether there's pressure
in the game or the water

1722
01:57:48,040 --> 01:57:50,960
Finolex pipes are
unbreakable like me, always.

1723
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:54,600
Conquer the world with
Sanjay Ghodawat Institutes.

1724
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:03,000
Where will you be going from here?
- Ranchi.

1725
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:05,680
And Pakistan?
- On 5th January.

1726
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:07,200
For how long?

1727
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:09,800
Until 20th February.

1728
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:12,480
3 tests and 5 one-day matches.

1729
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:15,120
Will you miss me?

1730
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:20,640
No.

1731
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:23,280
Why?
- Missing you will distract me.

1732
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:25,760
And you cannot afford
to have distraction

1733
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:27,280
when you're playing
for your country.

1734
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:30,520
Why do you even meet me?

1735
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:34,560
Because I like it.

1736
01:58:35,200 --> 01:58:37,320
Don't you like it?
- I do. - Then?

1737
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:39,400
In fact, I want
to meet you every day

1738
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:41,440
and always be with you.

1739
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:53,120
Priyanka, I recently
started playing for India.

1740
01:58:55,680 --> 01:58:57,160
I need time.

1741
01:59:02,640 --> 01:59:03,720
What happened?

1742
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:06,400
You look worried.

1743
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:08,120
Why would I be worried?

1744
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:10,800
I just don't want you to feel hurt.

1745
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:13,160
Do you really like me that much?

1746
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:18,240
It's not that.
- So, you don't like me?

1747
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:19,920
You're trapping me.

1748
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:26,520
Mahi.

1749
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:30,160
I think I really love you.

1750
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:39,960
Don't worry,
I don't need an answer.

1751
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:47,720
Do you have Chittu's number?
- Yes.

1752
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:48,960
My phone will be switched off.

1753
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:51,080
So, if you have any message,
give it to him.

1754
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:53,160
I will call you back.

1755
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:01,800
Mahi, are you sure?

1756
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:06,000
We do have a lot of time, right?

1757
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:08,680
Of course.

1758
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:33,280
There you go!
India win by 5 wickets!

1759
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:35,680
They take a 2-1 lead
in the series.

1760
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:39,400
I would first of all like
to congratulate the Indian team

1761
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,040
for playing exceptionally well.

1762
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:45,320
And may I specially
congratulate Dhoni

1763
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:47,960
for being the architect
of the victory.

1764
02:00:50,640 --> 02:00:53,440
And may I, may I tell Dhoni

1765
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:54,840
that I saw a placard

1766
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:57,360
asking you to have a haircut.

1767
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:59,560
But if you were
to take my opinion

1768
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,400
you look good in this haircut.

1769
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:02,760
Don't have a haircut.

1770
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:04,560
Okay!

1771
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:16,640
What is this?
How do I switch this thing on?

1772
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:18,320
Here you go.

1773
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:19,800
Hello.

1774
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:21,160
Dad, it's Mahi.

1775
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:24,560
Yes, Mahi.
You played really well today.

1776
02:01:25,480 --> 02:01:27,320
Everyone was praising
your game today.

1777
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:30,000
Did Musharraf say anything else?

1778
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:31,920
No, Dad.

1779
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:34,720
Are you happy?

1780
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:38,360
Yes, I'm very happy.

1781
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:41,800
I'm happy to be proven wrong.

1782
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:45,240
Just keep playing well.

1783
02:01:46,280 --> 02:01:47,960
Make your country proud.

1784
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:51,040
And don't let all this
go to your head.

1785
02:01:52,440 --> 02:01:53,480
Yes.

1786
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:55,720
Hang up.
Get some rest.

1787
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:15,960
'This call could not be completed
due to insufficient balance.'

1788
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:39,960
Hi, is there a PCO around?
- Yes, take the next left.

1789
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:42,160
Thank you. - Mr. Dhoni!
- Yes.

1790
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:44,520
Mr. Dhoni, you were amazing today.

1791
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:46,560
I swear, I really enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

1792
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:47,920
You want to make a call, right?
- Yes.

1793
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,840
Then do it from here.
- No, I want to make an ISD call.

1794
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:52,160
Do it from here, no problem.
- It's okay, I'll manage.

1795
02:02:52,240 --> 02:02:54,960
Come on, this is unbelievable.

1796
02:02:55,120 --> 02:02:57,960
You can call from here,
I'll wait outside.

1797
02:02:58,240 --> 02:03:00,400
Sure?
- Yes, of course. Make the call.

1798
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:11,480
Hello.

1799
02:03:11,680 --> 02:03:13,200
Were you waiting
next to the phone?

1800
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:15,440
I knew you would call today.

1801
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:17,440
How does it feel, Mr. Mahendra?

1802
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:19,480
How do you feel, ma'am?

1803
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:22,240
Feels like I made you
win the match.

1804
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:27,080
Do you want anything from here?
- Win the series.

1805
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:29,280
Anything else?

1806
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:31,200
Just come back soon.

1807
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:34,160
Why are you whispering?

1808
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:37,680
Because my family's having dinner
in the next room.

1809
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:39,680
Oh!

1810
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:43,760
Should I tell them about you?

1811
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:49,320
Let's discuss this when I'm back.

1812
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:53,960
You get so worried.

1813
02:03:56,120 --> 02:04:00,320
Well, I haven't even told
my best friend how much I love you.

1814
02:04:00,720 --> 02:04:02,080
Who is your best friend?

1815
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:04,480
You.

1816
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:09,760
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day, Mahi.

1817
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:11,440
What do I buy for you?

1818
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:14,800
Buy a nice watch for me.

1819
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:16,520
Something that's
affordable and durable.

1820
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:18,160
Done.

1821
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:19,800
What will you get for me?

1822
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:22,080
I don't believe in Valentine's Day.

1823
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:23,960
You..

1824
02:04:31,680 --> 02:04:32,760
Mahi.

1825
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:33,840
Yes?

1826
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:39,600
Mahi, are you sure we have time?
- Of course.

1827
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:41,960
See you soon.

1828
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:43,280
See you.

1829
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:46,040
See you.

1830
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:24,840
"I can feel you in me
whenever I breathe."

1831
02:05:25,160 --> 02:05:31,360
"The crossway of your heart"

1832
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:37,560
"I pass through every day."

1833
02:05:37,880 --> 02:05:42,160
"You tease me like the free wind"

1834
02:05:42,240 --> 02:05:46,280
"and I aberrate like loose sand."

1835
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:50,640
"Who'll love you as much"

1836
02:05:50,680 --> 02:05:54,960
"as I love you."

1837
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:36,960
"The quest of my vision
stops with you."

1838
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:41,760
"What more is left to express?"

1839
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:45,360
"Nothing is left unsaid."

1840
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:49,880
"My eyes long for your eyes."

1841
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:53,320
"and you're unaware of that."

1842
02:07:07,160 --> 02:07:11,040
"I gaze at your eyes"

1843
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:15,560
"while hiding
my feelings from you."

1844
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:19,960
"Who'll love you as much"

1845
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:24,360
"as I love you."

1846
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:46,080
That's pitched up!
Hammered over mid-on!

1847
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:48,320
India win by 8 wickets.

1848
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:51,880
And once again, it's that man
at the finishing line.

1849
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:53,560
Mahendra Singh Dhoni

1850
02:07:53,640 --> 02:07:55,400
quietly earning a name

1851
02:07:55,480 --> 02:07:56,800
of a finisher.

1852
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:16,840
Hello, Mahi.
You were spectacular today.

1853
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:18,640
It was really fun.
- Great.

1854
02:08:19,080 --> 02:08:21,000
Did Priyanka call you?

1855
02:08:21,120 --> 02:08:22,120
No.

1856
02:08:22,200 --> 02:08:23,320
I've been trying to call her
since 3-4 days.

1857
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:24,840
But her phone's not reachable.

1858
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:26,760
Did she give you
an alternate number?

1859
02:08:26,840 --> 02:08:28,400
Yes, I do have her
friend's number.

1860
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:30,480
Find out.
- Okay.

1861
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:31,800
When are you coming to Ranchi?

1862
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:32,840
Day after tomorrow.

1863
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:34,960
Find out and let me know.
- Okay.

1864
02:08:35,080 --> 02:08:36,160
See you.

1865
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:45,560
Mahi! Mahi..
- One second, just a second.

1866
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,400
Here.

1867
02:08:48,920 --> 02:08:49,960
Let's go.

1868
02:08:50,600 --> 02:08:51,640
Mahi.

1869
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:54,040
Mahi, there's a horde
of media outside.

1870
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:55,160
The car's parked at the back.

1871
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:57,320
But my bag..
- We'll deal with that, let's go.

1872
02:08:57,400 --> 02:08:58,400
Move, move!

1873
02:08:58,520 --> 02:08:59,480
Move.

1874
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:03,000
Mahi!

1875
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:05,040
Mahi!

1876
02:09:05,160 --> 02:09:07,120
Mahi!

1877
02:09:07,200 --> 02:09:09,040
Mahi!

1878
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:10,920
Mahi!

1879
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:15,360
Where's Chittu?
- He called.

1880
02:09:15,600 --> 02:09:17,120
He said he'll meet you
directly at home.

1881
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,280
Give me your phone.

1882
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:32,120
Yes.
- Mahi speaking.

1883
02:09:32,440 --> 02:09:36,480
Oh.. - Why aren't you
answering my calls?

1884
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:39,800
Well, I was stuck and..

1885
02:09:42,600 --> 02:09:44,560
Did you find out?

1886
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:47,680
Yes.. Well, no.

1887
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:50,280
I mean,
I'll tell you when we meet.

1888
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:54,960
What's wrong, Chittu?

1889
02:09:56,080 --> 02:10:00,720
Well..
P-Priyanka met with an accident

1890
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:02,560
on the 14th.

1891
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:31,520
Please stop the car.

1892
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:34,880
Why? What's wrong, Mahi?
- Please stop for a minute.

1893
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:39,400
There's something I need to do,
you guys go ahead.

1894
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:41,680
What.. I mean, we'll wait.

1895
02:10:41,800 --> 02:10:43,160
How will you get back home?
- I'm telling you.

1896
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:00,680
'Mahi, are you sure?'

1897
02:11:01,960 --> 02:11:03,720
'We do have a lot of time, right?'

1898
02:11:55,880 --> 02:11:58,600
India beaten by Bangladesh
by 5 wickets.

1899
02:12:11,560 --> 02:12:13,520
The faces say it all.

1900
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:53,560
Mahi!

1901
02:12:57,520 --> 02:12:58,600
Good morning, sir.

1902
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:00,160
How are you, sir?

1903
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:05,040
Watching your success
makes me proud.

1904
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:07,320
It's all thanks
to people like you, sir.

1905
02:13:08,360 --> 02:13:11,520
There's something I have wanted
to tell you for a long time now.

1906
02:13:11,880 --> 02:13:13,000
Yes, sir?

1907
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:15,520
Mahi, it's not like
I didn't want to

1908
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:19,600
or couldn't send you
to Kolkata that day.

1909
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:23,920
But since I was busy
with meetings

1910
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:28,480
I didn't realise that you..

1911
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:34,360
Don't hold that against me.

1912
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:37,440
Don't think like that, sir.

1913
02:13:40,240 --> 02:13:41,560
Keep going like this.

1914
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:44,480
And don't get complacent.
- Yes.

1915
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:48,080
You still have a long way to go.
- Yes.

1916
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:50,680
And aggression suits you.

1917
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:53,560
Don't try to play defensive.

1918
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:01,640
Bless you.
- Thank you, sir.

1919
02:15:10,160 --> 02:15:11,360
What a setting

1920
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:14,760
for the first World T-20 final!

1921
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:16,400
We are in Johannesburg

1922
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:18,120
and at 'The Bullring'

1923
02:15:18,160 --> 02:15:20,720
one of the great stadiums
in world cricket.

1924
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:24,760
13 needed from 6.

1925
02:15:26,120 --> 02:15:27,800
That's a huge wide!

1926
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:34,480
Misbah goes big!

1927
02:15:35,560 --> 02:15:37,760
It's huge, it's a six!

1928
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:40,360
Just six needed now for Pakistan!

1929
02:15:43,600 --> 02:15:47,320
And M.S. Dhoni walking up
to his bowler to have a chat.

1930
02:15:49,040 --> 02:15:50,920
Sree!

1931
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:01,200
It's up in the air..
Sreesanth

1932
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:02,640
takes it!

1933
02:16:02,680 --> 02:16:04,720
India have beaten Pakistan

1934
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:07,760
to win the World T-20 title!

1935
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:10,720
The celebrations begin!

1936
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:19,600
It's a young Indian team
that lifts the T-20 World Cup

1937
02:16:19,720 --> 02:16:22,200
with all the big boys resting.

1938
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:35,880
Now he's going to wreak havoc.

1939
02:16:46,720 --> 02:16:47,680
Yes.

1940
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:49,960
Mahi, time for the tele-conference.

1941
02:16:50,040 --> 02:16:51,080
Sure.

1942
02:17:00,520 --> 02:17:01,960
Hi, M.S.
- Hi, sirs.

1943
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:03,400
Hi.
- Hi.

1944
02:17:03,880 --> 02:17:06,560
So, as you know, today's
agenda is to.. - Excuse me, sir.

1945
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:09,600
Before we start this discussion,
can I say something?

1946
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:10,800
Yes, sure.

1947
02:17:10,840 --> 02:17:12,600
Sir, if we want to win

1948
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:14,400
we must take some tough calls.

1949
02:17:14,640 --> 02:17:16,680
I'm taking a tough call today
as a captain

1950
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:19,560
and I want you, sirs, to take
an important call as selectors

1951
02:17:19,640 --> 02:17:21,320
who want the betterment
of Indian cricket.

1952
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:23,520
What's the matter, M.S?

1953
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:27,240
Sir, three players
no longer fit the ODI team.

1954
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:32,080
They are very slow
as fielders, sir

1955
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:33,960
and the format
needs fitter players.

1956
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:36,240
Age is not the issue, sir,
fitness is.

1957
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:38,600
But M.S, they are still
very good as batsmen.

1958
02:17:38,640 --> 02:17:39,800
No doubt, sir.

1959
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:41,080
But due to their fielding

1960
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:42,680
we never succeed
in choking the opposition.

1961
02:17:42,760 --> 02:17:44,360
The result is that they
keep rotating the strike

1962
02:17:44,400 --> 02:17:45,800
and we can't build
pressure on them.

1963
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:47,560
And here in Australia,
the grounds are bigger.

1964
02:17:47,880 --> 02:17:50,280
This also has an adverse effect
on the other team members.

1965
02:17:50,320 --> 02:17:51,880
It reduces their morale.

1966
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:53,640
I'm a sportsman myself.

1967
02:17:53,680 --> 02:17:55,560
I can understand they
don't want to give up

1968
02:17:55,920 --> 02:17:57,160
but the fact of the matter is

1969
02:17:57,200 --> 02:17:58,520
that we just can't
have them in the team.

1970
02:17:58,560 --> 02:17:59,800
Sir, a bowler will take wickets

1971
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:02,600
a good batsman will
make runs in some matches.

1972
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:05,960
But a good fielder will save
runs for you in every match.

1973
02:18:06,920 --> 02:18:08,880
We've just lost
the test series, M.S.

1974
02:18:09,960 --> 02:18:11,640
Do you think we can
turn it around in One Days?

1975
02:18:11,680 --> 02:18:13,280
Sir, I can't promise you that.

1976
02:18:13,600 --> 02:18:15,600
But this will definitely
start a process.

1977
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:18,440
And I think we should also
be looking at the 2011 World Cup.

1978
02:18:18,720 --> 02:18:22,800
The sooner we make a core team,
the better chances we'll have.

1979
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:25,800
But M.S, the World Cup
is three years later.

1980
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:28,560
Sir, only three years
to the World Cup.

1981
02:18:28,680 --> 02:18:29,960
We have to let these three go.

1982
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:31,720
At least for this tour,
and then decide.

1983
02:18:31,880 --> 02:18:34,240
This will have
large scale implications.

1984
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,040
And he is a huge servant
of Indian Cricket.

1985
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:39,080
Precisely, sir,
we're all servants

1986
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:40,840
and we're all
doing national duty.

1987
02:18:40,920 --> 02:18:42,960
I know they will feel bad.

1988
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:44,280
The media is going to burn us.

1989
02:18:44,360 --> 02:18:45,600
People will feel bad.

1990
02:18:45,640 --> 02:18:49,000
But if we're right and if we
achieve results in the future

1991
02:18:49,160 --> 02:18:51,680
then people will understand
why we did what we did.

1992
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:55,480
I think, sir, more than players
we need characters.

1993
02:18:55,560 --> 02:18:57,240
Characters who want
to express themselves.

1994
02:18:57,320 --> 02:18:58,640
Characters who are desperate.

1995
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:00,640
If we invest in the youth today

1996
02:19:00,720 --> 02:19:02,320
only then can we expect
results in the future.

1997
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:07,760
M.S, we'll reconnect with you
in 10 minutes. - Right.

1998
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:09,120
Sure, sir.

1999
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:17,560
He's pretty new to this game.

2000
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:20,320
He'll understand
when it's his time.

2001
02:19:20,840 --> 02:19:23,760
How I see it is that he has
got results in T-20 World Cup.

2002
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:25,760
He's eyeing One Day World Cup.

2003
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:02,880
That's mistimed in the air
and Chawla takes it!

2004
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:05,440
India win the
Commonwealth Bank Series!

2005
02:20:05,880 --> 02:20:07,320
They've beaten Australia

2006
02:20:07,360 --> 02:20:08,640
by 10 runs.

2007
02:20:16,960 --> 02:20:19,960
Orient fan's air
reaches every corner.

2008
02:20:20,240 --> 02:20:21,440
Switch to smart.

2009
02:20:22,160 --> 02:20:24,080
Lava never lets you down.

2010
02:20:28,040 --> 02:20:32,120
For instant pickup, I use Gulf
Pride 4T Plus Bike Engine Oil.

2011
02:20:32,680 --> 02:20:35,560
Whether the fight's on the field
or against pimples on the face

2012
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:38,480
I will always win with
Garnier Men Face wash.

2013
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:40,560
Whether it's cricket or insurance

2014
02:20:40,600 --> 02:20:42,440
a long relationship
is all about trust.

2015
02:20:42,480 --> 02:20:44,040
Exide Life Insurance.

2016
02:21:05,480 --> 02:21:06,400
Yes.

2017
02:21:06,520 --> 02:21:08,600
M.S. these guys have arrived.
- Coming.

2018
02:21:48,600 --> 02:21:50,240
Excuse me.
- Yes, sir.

2019
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:53,720
I think I've misplaced my keycard.
- No problem, sir.

2020
02:21:53,760 --> 02:21:55,200
Please follow me.

2021
02:21:57,080 --> 02:21:58,400
This way, please.

2022
02:22:00,840 --> 02:22:02,360
Please, sir.

2023
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:08,160
Sir, could you help me
with your name, please?

2024
02:22:09,720 --> 02:22:11,640
Sorry?
- Sir, your name.

2025
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:14,280
Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

2026
02:22:14,320 --> 02:22:15,760
Okay.

2027
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:19,800
Sir, your room number?
- 601.

2028
02:22:22,400 --> 02:22:24,480
Right.
Could I have some ID, please?

2029
02:22:26,440 --> 02:22:27,960
I don't have any ID.

2030
02:22:28,040 --> 02:22:31,320
Actually, it's in my room
and I've locked myself out.

2031
02:22:32,040 --> 02:22:34,560
Sorry, sir,
I need to see some ID.

2032
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:39,120
Sakshi, right?
- Yes, sir.

2033
02:22:39,400 --> 02:22:41,120
Sakshi, tell me something.

2034
02:22:41,320 --> 02:22:43,680
Why will I pretend
to be Mahendra Singh Dhoni?

2035
02:22:44,560 --> 02:22:46,280
I don't know, sir.
It's..

2036
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:48,200
Actually, I am interning
with this hotel

2037
02:22:48,240 --> 02:22:50,080
and this is what we've
been instructed to do.

2038
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:53,760
Okay, Sakshi,
why don't we do this?

2039
02:22:53,840 --> 02:22:56,120
You take my keycard,
we'll go to my room.

2040
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:58,480
And then I'll show you my ID.
Will that be okay?

2041
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:00,120
Yes..

2042
02:23:00,320 --> 02:23:02,360
Mr. Sanjay, could I do that?
- Yes, please.

2043
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:05,320
See, we can.
- Sure, sir. Please.

2044
02:23:07,240 --> 02:23:08,320
This way.

2045
02:23:35,320 --> 02:23:36,720
Just a second.

2046
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:51,320
Thank you, sir.
- Okay.

2047
02:23:51,400 --> 02:23:52,560
Have a good day, sir.
- Thank you.

2048
02:23:52,600 --> 02:23:53,800
Thank you.
- You too.

2049
02:23:58,920 --> 02:24:00,120
There she is.

2050
02:24:03,320 --> 02:24:04,480
What happened, guys?

2051
02:24:04,520 --> 02:24:07,200
Sakshi, do you really
not know who it is?

2052
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:13,400
I.. I'm so sorry, sir.
I didn't recognise you.

2053
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:17,040
Thank you. It's okay.

2054
02:24:18,080 --> 02:24:19,880
Actually, I don't like cricket,
so I'm..

2055
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:22,080
I'm so sorry,
I didn't mean it like that.

2056
02:24:22,680 --> 02:24:24,120
I'm really sorry,
I didn't mean to..

2057
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:26,200
Can I have your autograph?
- I'm sorry?

2058
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:27,920
Just a second.

2059
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:30,440
Damn!

2060
02:24:32,360 --> 02:24:33,760
You were doing your job.

2061
02:24:33,960 --> 02:24:35,520
You really didn't
care about anything.

2062
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:36,720
It's rare.

2063
02:24:38,080 --> 02:24:40,480
Can I have your autograph?
- But sir, I..

2064
02:24:40,680 --> 02:24:42,520
It's okay.
- That's so embarrassing.

2065
02:24:42,600 --> 02:24:44,040
How can I..
- Go for it.

2066
02:24:44,760 --> 02:24:45,960
Okay.

2067
02:24:54,720 --> 02:24:57,440
Have a good day, sir.
- I'm having one, Sakshi.

2068
02:24:57,480 --> 02:24:58,840
Sir, thank you.

2069
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:16,280
'Does Dhoni not want
to play with Viru?'

2070
02:25:16,480 --> 02:25:18,640
'Do the two have
personal differences?'

2071
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:21,200
'Are Viru and Dhoni fighting?'

2072
02:25:21,240 --> 02:25:23,120
'Is Mahi angry with Viru?'

2073
02:25:23,160 --> 02:25:27,720
'Why has Mahi removed Viru
from the One Day team?'

2074
02:25:27,760 --> 02:25:30,840
'Is this the reason
for the divide in Team India?'

2075
02:25:56,560 --> 02:25:59,800
All right, leadership skills
in hospitality do demand

2076
02:25:59,840 --> 02:26:02,040
understanding of the open
communication model

2077
02:26:02,120 --> 02:26:03,480
by Johari Window.

2078
02:26:03,720 --> 02:26:06,560
It was evolved by two people,
Joseph and Harry.

2079
02:26:06,600 --> 02:26:07,840
Now the first..

2080
02:26:12,320 --> 02:26:15,400
With themselves and others,
which was created

2081
02:26:15,440 --> 02:26:19,120
by psychologists Joseph Luft
and Harrington Ingham.

2082
02:26:27,480 --> 02:26:28,480
Hello.

2083
02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:31,160
Hi, Sakshi,
Mahendra Singh Dhoni speaking.

2084
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:36,960
Hi.

2085
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:41,960
Well, I'm coming to Kolkata,
day after tomorrow.

2086
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:45,480
But I'm in my college
in Aurangabad.

2087
02:26:45,760 --> 02:26:46,800
Oh..

2088
02:26:49,480 --> 02:26:51,480
Aurangabad isn't really that far.

2089
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:55,240
If you make up your mind

2090
02:26:55,320 --> 02:26:56,640
then Delhi isn't too far, Mahendra.

2091
02:27:00,280 --> 02:27:04,160
Hello.
- Okay, bye.

2092
02:27:31,240 --> 02:27:33,080
Hello.
- Where are you?

2093
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:35,920
It's 4 a.m.
I'm in my hostel, obviously.

2094
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:37,920
You said Aurangabad isn't too far.

2095
02:27:37,960 --> 02:27:39,920
But I had to go through hell
to get here.

2096
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:43,560
You're in Aurangabad!

2097
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:46,920
I'm staying in Hotel Rama,
Room No. 304.

2098
02:27:47,320 --> 02:27:48,760
I'm here for just two days.

2099
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:51,240
Come and meet me
if you're in the mood.

2100
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:52,680
Bye.

2101
02:28:01,960 --> 02:28:03,320
Ritu. Ritu.

2102
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:05,440
Ritu, listen.
- What?

2103
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:07,560
Do you know
Mahendra Singh Dhoni?

2104
02:28:08,040 --> 02:28:09,000
Yes.

2105
02:28:09,040 --> 02:28:10,360
He's really hot.

2106
02:28:10,600 --> 02:28:11,960
Would you like to meet him?

2107
02:28:12,480 --> 02:28:14,200
I just met him
day before yesterday.

2108
02:28:14,360 --> 02:28:16,400
He kissed me on my cheeks.

2109
02:28:16,720 --> 02:28:19,440
Things were getting interesting
when the alarm started ringing.

2110
02:28:37,640 --> 02:28:38,800
Here you go.

2111
02:28:39,880 --> 02:28:42,840
Greetings, ma'am.
- Greetings.

2112
02:28:46,440 --> 02:28:49,120
Who are we going to meet?
- Come on.

2113
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:51,960
You're creating such suspense.

2114
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:57,320
Sakshi, you better tell me
where we are going!

2115
02:28:57,360 --> 02:28:58,400
Just wait.

2116
02:28:58,480 --> 02:29:00,680
Ritu! Ritu! Ritu!
Ritu! Sorry, sorry.

2117
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:01,560
Please wait.

2118
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:03,040
See, 315 is here.

2119
02:29:03,080 --> 02:29:05,160
304 must be here somewhere.
- Okay.

2120
02:29:09,040 --> 02:29:10,840
What.. - Hello.
- Hi.

2121
02:29:11,800 --> 02:29:12,840
Come in.

2122
02:29:19,440 --> 02:29:20,920
Just a moment.
- Sure.

2123
02:29:20,960 --> 02:29:24,320
Mahendra Singh..
- Ritu, shut up, shut up. Please.

2124
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:26,840
That's Mahendra Singh Dhoni.
Oh, my God!- Just chill.

2125
02:29:26,880 --> 02:29:29,400
I knew you would
bring a friend along. - Chill!

2126
02:29:29,440 --> 02:29:31,000
Yes, this is my friend, Ritu.

2127
02:29:31,960 --> 02:29:33,040
Hi, Ritu!

2128
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:34,760
Say 'hi'.

2129
02:29:34,840 --> 02:29:35,960
Hi.

2130
02:29:37,360 --> 02:29:39,880
He's so cute.
- Take me for sight-seeing.

2131
02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:42,520
If people see you,
it will create a huge ruckus.

2132
02:29:42,680 --> 02:29:43,800
Keep quiet!

2133
02:29:44,400 --> 02:29:45,960
No one will recognise me.

2134
02:29:46,720 --> 02:29:48,840
Come.
- Let's go.

2135
02:29:49,960 --> 02:29:50,960
Let's go.

2136
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:16,160
"Until I simmer
in the warmth of your heart.."

2137
02:30:16,560 --> 02:30:23,280
"Until I travel
to the moon with you.."

2138
02:30:23,520 --> 02:30:30,760
"Stay near me
and don't talk of going away."

2139
02:30:31,160 --> 02:30:38,160
"Stay with me
and don't talk of going away."

2140
02:30:46,920 --> 02:30:53,640
"Until I simmer
in the warmth of your heart.."

2141
02:30:54,360 --> 02:31:00,960
"Until I travel
to the moon with you.."

2142
02:31:01,320 --> 02:31:08,280
"Stay near me
and don't talk of going away."

2143
02:31:08,960 --> 02:31:15,720
"Stay with me
and don't talk of going away."

2144
02:31:30,960 --> 02:31:32,120
What happened?

2145
02:31:40,240 --> 02:31:41,440
Nothing.

2146
02:31:46,880 --> 02:31:48,040
What next?

2147
02:31:49,800 --> 02:31:51,040
What do you mean?

2148
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:54,240
I mean

2149
02:31:56,040 --> 02:31:58,400
you come to Aurangabad
to meet me.

2150
02:31:58,680 --> 02:31:59,720
Yes.

2151
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:01,960
I come to meet you in Mumbai.

2152
02:32:02,320 --> 02:32:03,400
Yes.

2153
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:08,480
What happens next?

2154
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:26,880
Next..

2155
02:32:28,800 --> 02:32:31,760
I'll drop you to Aurangabad.

2156
02:32:46,320 --> 02:32:49,040
"That which would suit you"

2157
02:32:49,280 --> 02:32:52,800
"that which would make
you look stunning.."

2158
02:32:53,120 --> 02:32:56,640
"What's that gift
which I could offer you?"

2159
02:32:56,880 --> 02:33:00,400
"What's that gift
which I could offer you?"

2160
02:33:01,520 --> 02:33:08,120
"The lines of my hand.."

2161
02:33:08,480 --> 02:33:11,960
"Let me gift them to you."

2162
02:33:12,240 --> 02:33:15,760
"Let me gift them to you."

2163
02:33:16,480 --> 02:33:23,520
"Until my eyes are
filled with your beauty.."

2164
02:33:24,080 --> 02:33:30,760
"Until I die and live
in your melody.."

2165
02:33:30,960 --> 02:33:38,320
"Stay near me and don't
talk of going away."

2166
02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:45,600
"Stay with me and don't
talk of going away."

2167
02:33:57,040 --> 02:33:58,920
Ma'am, how long
have you been with Dhoni?

2168
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:00,960
What relationship do you
and Dhoni share?

2169
02:34:03,360 --> 02:34:05,360
Sakshi, do you love Dhoni?

2170
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:18,520
Move back! Please!

2171
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:23,280
Sakshi, are you okay?
Don't worry, let's go.

2172
02:34:24,160 --> 02:34:25,280
Come.

2173
02:34:35,160 --> 02:34:36,320
Excuse me.

2174
02:34:36,600 --> 02:34:37,600
Good afternoon.

2175
02:34:37,680 --> 02:34:39,120
Mr. Satyaprakash?
- Yes.

2176
02:34:39,320 --> 02:34:40,520
Sir, this way please.

2177
02:34:48,760 --> 02:34:49,720
This way.

2178
02:34:49,800 --> 02:34:50,840
Yes, sir.

2179
02:34:52,040 --> 02:34:53,280
No, I understand, sir.

2180
02:34:56,440 --> 02:34:57,720
Just a second, sir.

2181
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:02,320
No, sir.

2182
02:35:03,560 --> 02:35:05,160
Sir, the entire team-selection
discussion

2183
02:35:05,240 --> 02:35:06,760
gets leaked to the media.

2184
02:35:06,840 --> 02:35:07,800
I only express my
point of view

2185
02:35:07,880 --> 02:35:09,320
and the next day,
in the media, they say

2186
02:35:09,960 --> 02:35:11,720
'Dhoni didn't want
that particular player.'

2187
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:15,160
Sir, one of our own selectors
is leaking the news to the media.

2188
02:35:16,760 --> 02:35:19,560
You tell me, sir. How is my
team supposed to trust me?

2189
02:35:19,640 --> 02:35:21,280
A captain is only
as good as the team.

2190
02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:25,840
And secondly sir,
if you can't give me my team

2191
02:35:25,960 --> 02:35:27,480
then I don't want
the captaincy either.

2192
02:35:29,960 --> 02:35:31,640
Sir, I have no interest
in the captaincy

2193
02:35:31,720 --> 02:35:32,960
because I can't be a puppet.

2194
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:35,360
Thanks, sir.

2195
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:40,840
How are you, Satya?

2196
02:35:41,160 --> 02:35:42,640
I won't be fooled again.

2197
02:35:44,600 --> 02:35:46,320
There was no one on the phone,
right?

2198
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:48,680
You were only pretending.

2199
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:54,760
You're right, you caught me.
- I knew it.

2200
02:35:57,320 --> 02:35:59,480
You now speak such good English,
Mahi.

2201
02:36:01,080 --> 02:36:02,800
You've become a big man.

2202
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:05,320
What big?

2203
02:36:07,160 --> 02:36:10,720
When you play, millions of
people hold their breath.

2204
02:36:11,160 --> 02:36:12,360
Because of you.

2205
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:17,160
Forget that.
How is everyone in Kharagpur?

2206
02:36:17,760 --> 02:36:18,880
All okay.

2207
02:36:19,880 --> 02:36:21,200
I came over because
I wanted to see you.

2208
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:22,520
You did the right thing.

2209
02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:25,240
See you.

2210
02:36:25,320 --> 02:36:27,480
I'm a nobody and
you must be a busy man.

2211
02:36:27,560 --> 02:36:30,360
I'll make some tea for us.
- No, no. I'll leave now.

2212
02:36:38,320 --> 02:36:39,600
Okay, see you.
- See you.

2213
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:43,480
Can I say something?
- Of course.

2214
02:36:44,280 --> 02:36:47,200
That lady who showed
me the way here. - Yes?

2215
02:36:47,400 --> 02:36:50,400
She was wearing
very short clothes.

2216
02:36:52,080 --> 02:36:53,640
I'll do something about it.

2217
02:36:55,200 --> 02:36:56,280
Bless you.

2218
02:37:15,520 --> 02:37:19,000
Hello.
- How are you? All okay?

2219
02:37:19,480 --> 02:37:22,440
All well. You?
- Fine.

2220
02:37:23,200 --> 02:37:24,840
Well, my second test
starts tomorrow.

2221
02:37:25,160 --> 02:37:26,400
So my phone will
be switched off.

2222
02:37:28,160 --> 02:37:30,200
Mahi, mom was asking about you.

2223
02:37:32,440 --> 02:37:34,120
What did you say?

2224
02:37:35,040 --> 02:37:38,040
What I always say,
that we're friends.

2225
02:37:40,240 --> 02:37:41,960
There's nothing wrong
with that, Sakshi.

2226
02:37:43,640 --> 02:37:45,400
Are we just friends, Mahi?

2227
02:37:47,920 --> 02:37:49,400
Mahi, I like you.

2228
02:37:51,280 --> 02:37:53,880
I trust you,
but this stupid news..

2229
02:37:55,040 --> 02:37:57,080
All this makes me really upset.

2230
02:37:58,560 --> 02:37:59,760
I get hurt.

2231
02:38:01,800 --> 02:38:04,480
And I think I love you
and that's why I get hurt.

2232
02:38:05,160 --> 02:38:07,600
So, avoid everything like I do.

2233
02:38:08,840 --> 02:38:10,800
I'm not like you, Mahi.

2234
02:38:12,360 --> 02:38:17,000
My world is different from
yours. It's much smaller.

2235
02:38:18,680 --> 02:38:20,480
I just don't know
what you're thinking.

2236
02:38:21,480 --> 02:38:23,840
I don't know how
important I am to you.

2237
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:26,160
Well, at least you know
that you're important to me.

2238
02:38:27,240 --> 02:38:29,520
Sometimes it's better to say it,
Mahi.

2239
02:38:35,160 --> 02:38:36,440
Sakshi..

2240
02:38:36,520 --> 02:38:37,760
Look at me,
you have a game tomorrow

2241
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:39,920
and there I go again.

2242
02:38:40,840 --> 02:38:42,720
Well,
tomorrow is Valentine's Day.

2243
02:38:43,640 --> 02:38:45,000
What should I buy for you?

2244
02:38:47,320 --> 02:38:49,080
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day,
Mahi.

2245
02:38:49,280 --> 02:38:50,960
What should I buy for you?

2246
02:39:04,440 --> 02:39:06,440
I don't believe
in Valentine's Day.

2247
02:39:07,080 --> 02:39:08,320
Of course.

2248
02:39:09,880 --> 02:39:11,520
Have a good match, Mahi.

2249
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:36,160
Yes, Mahi.

2250
02:39:36,840 --> 02:39:39,480
Sakshi, my world
isn't bigger than yours.

2251
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:42,280
In fact, it's only
as big as a cricket kit bag.

2252
02:39:42,920 --> 02:39:44,080
You'll have to
endure all this.

2253
02:39:44,360 --> 02:39:45,840
So, think before you answer.

2254
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:49,120
Will you marry me?

2255
02:39:53,960 --> 02:39:55,360
Are you sure, Mahi?

2256
02:39:55,440 --> 02:39:58,040
As sure as I'm of getting
a century in the next match.

2257
02:40:02,840 --> 02:40:04,240
Will you marry me, Sakshi?

2258
02:40:10,240 --> 02:40:11,720
Yes, Mahi!

2259
02:40:13,520 --> 02:40:14,640
Yes.

2260
02:40:33,120 --> 02:40:40,280
"Until I fill up your life
with unconditional love.."

2261
02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:47,520
"Until I learn you as my prayers
a hundred times and over.."

2262
02:40:47,680 --> 02:40:54,720
"Stay near me and don't
talk of going away."

2263
02:40:55,320 --> 02:41:02,600
"Stay with me and don't
talk of going away."

2264
02:41:33,680 --> 02:41:39,760
"You've come into my arms"

2265
02:41:40,400 --> 02:41:43,520
"with millions of sunrises."

2266
02:41:44,320 --> 02:41:47,800
"With millions of sunrises."

2267
02:41:48,720 --> 02:41:55,480
"You've been brought
from the skies"

2268
02:41:55,560 --> 02:41:58,920
"for me."

2269
02:41:59,360 --> 02:42:03,280
"Only for me."

2270
02:42:03,920 --> 02:42:10,800
"Until my fingers
say something to your tresses.."

2271
02:42:11,320 --> 02:42:18,200
"Until my desires sail
in the stream of your love.."

2272
02:42:18,360 --> 02:42:25,320
"Stay near me and don't
talk of going away."

2273
02:42:25,880 --> 02:42:33,360
"Stay with me and don't
talk of going away."

2274
02:42:52,480 --> 02:42:54,960
The Wankhede Stadium on their feet.

2275
02:42:55,240 --> 02:43:00,200
So, Sri Lanka end up 274 for 6
after their 50 overs.

2276
02:43:00,240 --> 02:43:01,520
The target for India

2277
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:04,720
when they come out to bat.. 275!

2278
02:43:04,760 --> 02:43:06,760
Now that is a massive score

2279
02:43:06,800 --> 02:43:08,080
in a World Cup final.

2280
02:43:08,200 --> 02:43:10,760
No team has ever won it
in their home country

2281
02:43:10,880 --> 02:43:14,280
and India have
a job on their hands.

2282
02:43:14,680 --> 02:43:16,720
The crowd expectant.

2283
02:43:17,160 --> 02:43:19,560
They are in anticipation.

2284
02:43:37,440 --> 02:43:40,840
What do you think, Mr. Tiwari?
Who's going to win?

2285
02:43:41,960 --> 02:43:43,960
Let's see how the match plays out.

2286
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,880
We're going to lose
today! - Shut up!

2287
02:43:47,400 --> 02:43:49,760
Stupid guy! - India
about to start their innings

2288
02:43:49,840 --> 02:43:52,840
as the two Indian openers
come out to bat.

2289
02:43:52,920 --> 02:43:55,720
Virender Sehwag
and Sachin Tendulkar.

2290
02:43:58,520 --> 02:44:01,880
Malinga on his way.
Sehwag is the man on strike.

2291
02:44:04,760 --> 02:44:07,440
Howzat! - Rapped on the pads,
a finger goes up!

2292
02:44:07,480 --> 02:44:08,720
This is close!

2293
02:44:08,880 --> 02:44:11,640
And Sehwag wants to go upstairs.

2294
02:44:20,400 --> 02:44:24,400
He is in big, big trouble
as the finger goes up. - Oh, no!

2295
02:44:24,440 --> 02:44:27,960
Virender Sehwag dismissed.
India lose their first wicket.

2296
02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:36,520
Edged and taken! It's Tendulkar
who has to depart.

2297
02:44:36,880 --> 02:44:40,880
India lose their second wicket
with just 31 runs on the board.

2298
02:44:40,920 --> 02:44:43,480
Pin drop silence around
the Wankhede Stadium

2299
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:45,520
as the Master departs

2300
02:44:45,600 --> 02:44:48,480
for the final time
in World Cup cricket.

2301
02:44:48,600 --> 02:44:50,960
And a young Turk comes
out to the centre

2302
02:44:51,080 --> 02:44:53,440
with number 18 on his back.

2303
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:55,280
Virat Kohli!

2304
02:45:11,720 --> 02:45:13,360
Crucial moment in the game.

2305
02:45:13,600 --> 02:45:15,480
Muttiah Muralitharan.

2306
02:45:15,520 --> 02:45:19,440
The Wizard of the Emerald Isle
being introduced into the attack.

2307
02:45:34,280 --> 02:45:35,640
Excuse me, Gary.
- Yes.

2308
02:45:35,760 --> 02:45:37,880
If a wicket goes down,
I think I should go in.

2309
02:45:38,080 --> 02:45:40,000
But Yuvi is padded up and ready.

2310
02:45:40,240 --> 02:45:42,120
No, it's Murali.
I think I should go in.

2311
02:45:42,480 --> 02:45:43,560
You sure?
- Yes.

2312
02:45:43,600 --> 02:45:45,040
Just tell him, I'll.. I'll go.

2313
02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:53,960
No..

2314
02:45:55,240 --> 02:45:59,040
Has to hurry. Chance of a
run out. Gambhir survives.

2315
02:46:10,560 --> 02:46:11,520
Catch it!

2316
02:46:11,560 --> 02:46:14,160
It's a stunning catch.
Kohli has to depart.

2317
02:46:14,240 --> 02:46:16,280
India now in a spot of bother.

2318
02:46:16,360 --> 02:46:18,440
A 114 for 3.

2319
02:46:38,080 --> 02:46:40,120
Yuvraj Singh has to wait.

2320
02:46:40,640 --> 02:46:42,800
The skipper rolls up his sleeves

2321
02:46:42,840 --> 02:46:44,640
and makes his way out
to the centre.

2322
02:46:44,720 --> 02:46:46,480
Mahendra Singh Dhoni

2323
02:46:46,560 --> 02:46:48,400
promotes himself
in the batting order

2324
02:46:48,480 --> 02:46:50,280
and this is a World Cup final.

2325
02:46:50,360 --> 02:46:53,920
India 3 down, the skipper
making his way to the middle.

2326
02:47:03,120 --> 02:47:05,840
This is a massive moment
in the World Cup.

2327
02:47:05,920 --> 02:47:07,360
Huge moment in the game.

2328
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:10,400
He's not had the best of World Cups
with the bat so far.

2329
02:47:10,520 --> 02:47:14,160
But the captain here trying
to make a statement.

2330
02:47:52,320 --> 02:47:54,280
Hit harder, Mahi!

2331
02:48:10,880 --> 02:48:12,840
Come on!

2332
02:48:25,760 --> 02:48:27,280
Mahi, what a shot!

2333
02:48:31,960 --> 02:48:32,920
Didn't I tell you?

2334
02:48:33,080 --> 02:48:34,400
Didn't I tell you
that if Mahi comes up

2335
02:48:34,440 --> 02:48:36,120
he's going to hit really hard?

2336
02:48:36,320 --> 02:48:39,080
Massive ruckus from
the Indian captain.

2337
02:48:39,120 --> 02:48:40,920
This is a World Cup final.

2338
02:48:41,520 --> 02:48:42,920
He's in the zone!

2339
02:48:42,960 --> 02:48:46,320
He now realises that he has
reached a half century.

2340
02:48:46,400 --> 02:48:49,800
The crowd senses there's something
special in the offing.

2341
02:48:49,920 --> 02:48:52,280
52 needed off 53

2342
02:48:52,400 --> 02:48:54,360
and Perera on his way.

2343
02:48:55,120 --> 02:48:56,120
He's gone!

2344
02:48:56,200 --> 02:48:57,760
Looking to give himself room

2345
02:48:57,840 --> 02:49:00,040
Gautam Gambhir
misses it altogether.

2346
02:49:00,360 --> 02:49:01,920
It's cleaned up here by Perera.

2347
02:49:01,960 --> 02:49:05,680
And Sri Lanka believe
they still have a chance.

2348
02:49:05,800 --> 02:49:09,240
This is a World Cup final.
275 the target.

2349
02:49:09,320 --> 02:49:12,920
India now 223 for 4.

2350
02:49:27,560 --> 02:49:30,160
11 needed off 16.

2351
02:49:36,720 --> 02:49:40,080
That's whipped away on the on-side.
He finds the boundary.

2352
02:49:40,200 --> 02:49:42,560
There's dancing in the aisles.

2353
02:49:42,600 --> 02:49:44,440
The whole of the country

2354
02:49:44,480 --> 02:49:46,840
senses a World Cup win!

2355
02:49:56,680 --> 02:49:58,600
4 runs to win.

2356
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:01,120
11 balls remaining.

2357
02:50:02,120 --> 02:50:04,160
What a moment this is!

2358
02:50:04,400 --> 02:50:06,080
History in the making!

2359
02:50:06,120 --> 02:50:08,360
India have never won a World Cup

2360
02:50:08,400 --> 02:50:10,440
in the last 28 years.

2361
02:50:10,720 --> 02:50:15,000
The nation on their feet..
- India. - India..

2362
