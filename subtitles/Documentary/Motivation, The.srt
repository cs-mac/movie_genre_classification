1
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,570
Not here. It's Taken.

2
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,570
Excuse Me, Excuse me...

3
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:37,570
ZERO MOTIVATION

4
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,570
Soldiers, the bus is broken down. Please leave the bus. Another bus is coming.

5
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:03,570
Soldiers, please, everyone off the bus.

6
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:9,570
Everyone off, please.

7
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,570
Take us home!

00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:42,570
Episode 1: The Replacement

9
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,570
Kill me now.

10
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,570
Come on, let's go. We're late.

11
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,570
I can't take another step. Go on without me.

12
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:11,570
I missed two buses because of you. If I'm late Rama's gonna' kill me.

13
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,570
Why doesn't anyone answer my letters?

14
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,570
You want me to carry your backpack? It won't help.

15
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,570
My soul is what's heavy.

16
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,570
I just can't go into that base and start another lame week.

17
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,570
Stop it, Dafta. It'll go by fast.

18
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:33,570
We'll do some shenanigans. It'll be fun. We'll set a new Mine-Sweeper record.

19
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,570
Excuse me?

20
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,570
This is Shizafon base, right?

21
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,570
Shivzaon. Yeah, this is it.

22
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,570
Oh good, I thought I was in the wrong place. I'm new here.

23
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,570
Poor thing. I feel your sorrow.

24
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,570
Excuse her, she doesn't like Sundays. 

25
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,570
Wait. What's your name?

26
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,570
Tehila. What's your position?

27
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,570
Receptionist. Where?

28
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,570
In an office. What office?

29
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,570
What is this, an interrogation? I'm going in.

30
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,570
You don't get it? She's my replacement.

31
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,570
That's Good.

32
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,570
What time is it? I have to serve coffee to the dickheads.

33
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,570
"Just so you know...there are a lot of fags on this base..."

34
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,570
The private says: "Oh, really?" The Sergeant says:

35
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,570
"Yeah. You want me to point them out?"

36
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,570
So the Private answers: "Yeah". The Sergeant says: 

37
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,570
"No problem, but first I want a kiss."

38
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,570
So I guess we're not getting coffee this morning?

39
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,570
You'll get it. My soldiers are working on it right now.

40
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,570
Good, because if you want to command a hundred soldiers

41
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,570
you'd better learn how to command 5 of them.  Absolutely. Ok.

42
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,570
We're having the multi-branch drill this week so...Ber, go ahead.

43
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,570
Ok, we'll be training in area Oscar-4 Tarantula Sector.

44
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,570
Blanks only. Section 280 is closed for the drill.

45
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,570
What makes you think she's your replacement? 
 What do you mean? It's obvious.

46
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:57,570
My letters finally reached someone who read them and wants to help.

47
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,570
Wait, where did you come from?

48
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,570
Boot camp.

49
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,570
Where were you sent?

50
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,570
Here.

51
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,570
You see?

52
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,570
This is the Personnel Office. Your new home.

53
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,570
This is your desk and you can put your backpack here.

54
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,570
Oh, there you are, disobedient soldier. Don't even ask what happened.

55
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,570
All of the Officers are waiting.

56
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,570
They're thirsty and dying to eat.

57
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,570
I'm not even going to ask. Thank you.

58
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,570
The bus broke down, I swear

59
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,570
I don't care if aliens were blocking all the roads in Southern Israel.

60
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,570
You need to be here at 9:30 sharp.

61
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,570
It's my fault. She missed two buses in Be'er Sheba waiting for me.

62
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,570
You don't have to come to the base together all the time. You're like glue. We're not in kindergarten. Who's she?

63
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,570
This is Tehila...Okay, it doesn't matter now.

64
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,570
You have two minutes to serve breakfast. Clean this up after.

65
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,570
What? Exactly.

66
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,570
Get rid of that stain right away.

67
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,570
You don't have to salute. Boot camp is over.

68
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,570
That bitch! Why is she yelling at me?

69
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,570
I'm supposed to clean her uniform? What am I, her slave?

70
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,570
Don't worry about it, Ignore her. We'll make her coffee and she'll calm down.

71
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,570
Coffee? That bitch, she can go fuck herself.

72
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,570
Along with all the officers up her ass.

73
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,570
Rama, our Lieutenant, she's a little uptight.

74
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,570
She's retarded.

75
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,570
Come.

76
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:23,570
"Soon, you'll talk to me again..."

77
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,570
"And my body will feel your warmth"

78
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:32,570
"And your breathing... "

79
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:38,570
This is the seating order of the officers so you'll know what coffee to serve to which officer.

80
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,570
Get it? It's really simple.

81
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,570
Hey, Nati.
Anat.

82
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,570
What, you don't remember me?

83
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,570
You probably didn't recognize me without the tears, huh?

84
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:54,570
Dafi, from personnel. Oh, right, without the hoodie.

85
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,570
Look, they sent me a replacement and I'm moving to Kiryat.
 
86
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,570
Oh really? Yeah. That's great.

87
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,570
Good luck. Thanks.

88
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:50,570
"Wounds and kisses..."

89
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,570
"All the lies and all the silence"

90
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,570
"Come back like gamblers with their deck of cards..."

91
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,570
"and shiny shoes".

92
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:07,570
"balancing integrity in a cardboard box, everyday phenomenon."

93
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,570
"I leave, I leave that day,"

94
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:18,570
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la...Ooowooo...wooowooo"

95
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,570
Shut up!

96
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,570
"She said, 'thank you, I'm hopeless'

97
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,570
"and not afraid to be bad..." Shut up! Shut up!

98
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,570
"So, I stayed there..."

99
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,570
Personnel Department.

100
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,570
Yes. Just a sec. Is this Meirav?

101
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,570
Hi, Tsrifin.

102
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,570
Okay, there are a lot of forms here.

103
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,570
Vacation forms, transfer forms...
 Ok, bye.

104
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,570
No, no, no, those are personal files. What are you looking for?

105
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,570
Ah, okay. Anyway...

106
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,570
this is all the personnel stuff.

107
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,570
Girls, this is my replacement, Tehila.

108
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,570
Replacement? What replacement?

109
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,570
I'm Moving to the City. No kidding?

110
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,570
How did that happen?

111
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,570
Jealous, huh?

112
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,570
Anyway, Tehila, these are your colleagues.

113
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,570
This is Liyat. She's Rama's secretary, and this is Livanat.

114
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,570
I'm the Human Resources Officer. Not a receptionist.

115
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,570
Wow! You really have no idea what we do here.

116
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,570
Well, it's not like we actually do anything.

117
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,570
You'd be surprised. We work really hard. Maybe if you came to the office sometime you'd see.

118
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,570
Dafi, if you put your backpack on my desk one more time

119
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,570
I'm gonna' shove it up your ass. Stop it! Let's not start that again.

120
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,570
This desk is for both of us

121
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,570
Not for both of us. Just me. Rama said so.

122
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,570
This is Irena. She came here from the ordinance corps. She's also new here.

123
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,570
New, my ass. I've been here two months already.
 Personnel Department. Hello.

124
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,570
Poor girl. She's overwhelmed. Two years sounds like a lot but time goes by really fast.

125
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,570
Yes, it does.

126
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,570
Hi, girls! Hello! Hello!

127
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,570
What have you been up to?

128
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:51,570
In this drawer there are staplers, pins, thumbtacks, separators, straight blades, envelope opener,

129
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:58,570
pencil sharpeners, plastic glue, ink pens, pen fillers, staplers..
 Stop, you're giving me a headache.

130
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:05,570
Staple gun. The most expensive item in the office.

131
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,570
This thing is deadly.

132
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,570
Nothing works like these on the big posters. Not thumbtacks, not scotch tape.

133
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,570
There are only two of them and they're numbered. We hide them here.

134
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:22,570
Even if G*d forbid, you become a POW and they torture you, you tell no one. Got it?

135
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,570 
Boaz? Yeah?
You got a minute?

136
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,570
For you, even 60 seconds.

137
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,570
I wanted to update you about my application to become a Captain.

138
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,570
I heard there's only one more opening and I need a recommendation from you.

139
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,570
There's still time before the Commission, right?

140
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,570
Yes, but I'd rather take care of it ahead of time.

141
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,570
How many candidates are there?
It's me and three other officers from the division.

142
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,570
Excellent. Competition is a good thing. You'll have plenty of time to impress us.

143
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,570
There's going to be an inspection soon, correct?
Yes.

144
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,570
It's a great chance to earn some points.

145
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,570
Absolutely. I'll do the best I can.
I'm sure.

146
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,570
Girls! Are you on vacation?

147
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,570
What do you mean by, "moving to the City"?

148
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,570
Exactly what is says. Nothing more.

149
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,570
Don't you talk back to me. I don't have the time or patience for this.

150
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,570
We're not supposed to get new recruits until the end of the month.

151
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,570
No, Rama, it's all good, everything is organized, I...

152
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,570
It's just that I've made some contacts with some officials in the city.

153
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,570
What kind of contacts?

154
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,570
I've been sending letters.

155
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,570
A lot of letters. To who? 

156
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,570
To the mental health officer, to the head of personal affairs, to the general staff.

157
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,570
The Chief of Staff's Advisor for Women's Relations, and frankly, to the Chief of Staff himself.

158
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,570
What?

159
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,570
Right, Zohar? We ended up sending him a letter, right?

160
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,570
To the Chief of Staff? Yeah, I think so.

161
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,570
You sent a letter to the Chief of Staff?

162
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,570
What did you write to him?

163
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:59,570
That you're a spoiled secretary who the Army invented a non-existent position for?

164
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,570
Paper-shredding sergeant, because she doesn't know how to type or transfer a phone call?

165
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:06,570
That you want to transfer to the City because the desert dries out your hair?

166
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,570
Well, obviously, we wrote it a little differently.

167
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,570
This bypassing of authority is unheard of.
 I don't think the Chief of Staff dealt with it personally.

168
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,570
He probably forwarded it to a personal affairs officer or something like that.

169
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,570
I can't believe this disgrace.

170
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,570
Everything is so organized with the combat soldiers.

171
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,570
And the non-combatants are thrown around like garbage.

172
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:24,570
And stop moving binders around here! Close the door!

173
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:28,570
You'll have wait till I have time. Does it look like I have nothing else to do?

174
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,570
You don't have to do anything. I'll take care of it all.

175
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,570
You've become cocky.

176
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,570
You were a good girl before you fell in love with Zohar.

177
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,570
Why am I always to blame?

178
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,570
Are you trying me?
No.

179
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,570
It's 1:07 and I still haven't received the mail.

180
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,570
It's been on your desk for an hour.

181
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,570
00:00

182
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:49,570
What about the uniform? Did you get rid of the stain?
I'm working on it.

183
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,570
Perfect! Continue.

184
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,570
This is what do you do all day?

185
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,570
Personally I don't see the point of shredding 10 pounds of paper every day.

186
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:24,570
I shred a lot of paper but do it as you see fit.

187
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,570
In general, as the paper shredding Sergeant, the position is really a lot what you make of it.

188
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,570
Sssh! Sorry.

189
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:39,570
These girls really think highly of themselves. Mabas' receptionists are really stuck up.

190
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,570
What is 'Mabas'?

191
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,570
That's the base commander.

192
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,570
Don't worry, you'll understand everything and meet everyone.
 Do you know all the soldiers on base?

193
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,570
Everyone on base? No way. Do you have any idea how many soldiers are stationed here?

194
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,570
How many? There are...

195
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,570
A lot! You're funny.

196
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:03,570
Now you can relax for a bit. Basically, you can take a nap every afternoon.

197
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,570
But you know, don't tell anyone about it.

198
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,570
I can't believe you're leaving. It's a disaster.

199
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:31,570
It's alright. You'll have some peace. You won't have to listen to me cry all day.

200
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,570
Yeah right, with those two idiots singing duets all day?

201
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,570
That's Guy Shefi.

202
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,570
He just looked at you.

203
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,570
Really? Yes! Well, go talk to him.

204
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,570
Are you crazy? What am I going to say?

205
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,570
I don't know. Say, "Hi".

206
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,570
Look, his friends are cute too.

207
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,570
If we become a couple, I'll introduce you to them.

208
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,570
Let's start with actually talking to him.
 I will if you stay.

209
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,570
What does that have to do with anything?

210
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,570
We'll talk every day on the phone.

211
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:13,570
You'll come to visit me, we'll drink ice coffee at Checker's. We'll talk on the phone every day.

212
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,570
The phone? Can you save seats on the bus with the telephone?

213
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,570
Set new high scores on all the computers in the office?

214
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,570
You're not going to like it there.

215
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,570
You won't have anyone to talk to. No one to eat with.

216
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:42,570
Ladies and gentlemen! After an impressive game by the Spanish champion...

217
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,570
will the Israeli competitor manage to overcome her?

218
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,570
Here she goes. She's marking the monitor fiercely.

219
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:52,570
They tell me she went through rigorous training in the IDF! And now...

220
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:58,570
Yay! I broke the record! Woo hoo!
 No way, move over. I feel like I'm on a roll.

221
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:07,570
Zohar Ben Ari approaching the mission...
 Haven't you had enough of this nonsense?

222
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,570
Rama"

223
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,570
In regards to Tehila, I fully trained her today.

224
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:19,570
So you can go ahead and test her, and if everything is alright...

225
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,570
Well, I could actually be leaving tomorrow.

226
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:27,570
Come to my office first thing tomorrow morning and we'll take care of it.

227
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,570
Do you think this is funny?

228
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,570
You told me to get rid of the stain.

229
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,570
I removed it.

230
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,570
That joke just cost you denial of a vacation.

231
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,570
Forgive her. I'll sew it. It'll be unnoticeable, I promise.

232
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,570
You need to worry about the trash cans.

233
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,570
They're full of papers,

234
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:59,570
You're not going anywhere before you shred all of this, get it?

235
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:25,570
Damn it. I think it's Shapiro, that son of a bitch.

236
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,570
Wait a second!

237
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,570
Wait a minute!

238
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,570
Eitan.

239
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,570
What are you doing here?

240
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,570
I'm stationed here.

241
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,570
What? How can that be?
Can I come in?

242
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:03,570
Girls aren't allowed in here. The Disciplinary NCO is going around the barracks.

243
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,570
Hold on, hold on, listen. This is a bad time. Let's talk tomorrow.

244
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,570
You have no idea how worried I was. Why didn't you call or answer my texts?

245
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,570
Because I told you, I'm very busy now.
 What's the matter. You didn't have fun at the Kineret?

246
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,570
No, it was...it was great.

247
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,570
I can't stop thinking about what we did there. In the water, inside the tent...

248
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,570
Well, it...it was summer, and...

249
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,570
We only met like...

250
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,570
Eight times. We slept together five nights.
 
251
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,570
Not including the night in the Kineret. I don't count that one since we didn't sleep.

252
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,570
We said we would meet on New Years. I made you a surprise and suddenly you didn't answer me.

253
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,570
Listen, you really have to leave.
 You have to see the surprise.

254
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,570
No, no it's not right, okay?

255
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,570
I didn't get back to you because I'm really busy and because...

256
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:47,570
I've never loved anyone like this before. You have no idea how you stole my heart.

257
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,570
Okay, but...it's over. I'm not interested anymore.

258
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,570
How come?

259
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,570
Because...I don't know...it's just not...

260
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,570
So, why did you text that you think about me a lot?

261
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,570
I don't remember.

262
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,570
For four months all I've thought about is you. Nothing else.

263
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:07,570
Only, Eitan, Eitan, Eitan, Eitan, Eitan.

264
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,570
Wait, you didn't...you didn't actually enlist, right?

265
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,570
How did you get in here?

266
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:17,570
I had to see you. I couldn't take it anymore.

267
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:30,570
Aren't you the new soldier from Personnel?

268
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:35,570
No, she's not a soldier. She's a psycho I met once and...

269
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,570
we met a few times and that's it. Nothing happened. 
 Nothing?

270
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,570
Do you know what he texted me?

271
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,570
When I found your home number, your mom picked up and said you were home

272
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,570
and a minute later she said you weren't home.

273
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,570
Did you tell your mom to lie to me?

274
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,570
You have no idea what you're getting yourself into. Impersonating a soldier is a felony.

275
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,570
If we report you, you're going to get arrested. Right, Anati?

276
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,570
Don't you remember that night in the Kineret, you told me...
 Enough with the fucking Kineret! It was a long time ago!

277
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,570
It was a while ago! I also have a girlfriend now.

278
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,570
Do me a favor, pull yourself together

279
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,570
and leave this base before you get caught.

280
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:11,570
Leave the same way you came in.
 Where did you get a uniform and a unit badge?

281
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,570
This is unreal.

282
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,570
Listen, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't answer your texts, okay? I'm Sorry.

283
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,570
Would you like me to walk you outside and we'll talk a little bit?

284
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,570
Ok, that's it.

285
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,570
If you don't leave right now, I'm going to call the Military Police.

286
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,570
It's no problem. Do you really want to ruin your life?

287
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,570
You've already ruined my life.

288
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:36,570
Tehila, is everything alright?

289
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,570
Yes.

290
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:42,570
Okay, we're in the barracks. If you need anything, just say so.

291
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:26,570
"Fleeting meeting,"

292
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:30,570
"parting forever."

293
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:37,570
"He is looking for a man, but his feet stumble."

294
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:41,570
"He will not be able to find,"

295
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:46,570
"one that was lost..."
 Eating from the floor? Disgusting.

296
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:51,570
I'm telling you, Zohar, nothing disgusts her. That's the way it is at the kibbutz, huh?

297
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,570
Yeah. And how is it in the ghetto?
 Watch it!

298
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,570
Don't worry about her. Ignore her.
 Yeah, ignore me.

299
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,570
"My last day"

300
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,570
"is near..."

301
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,570
Dafi...Dafi.

302
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,570
Do you really think he looked at me today?

303
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:17,570
I'm worried about Tehila. How long does it someone to take a shit?

304
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,570
She's probably constipated. Like you were when you first got here.

305
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,570
Can you shut up already? I'm trying to go to sleep.

306
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,570
Who, them or us?
 Both.

307
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,570
"We are..."

308
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,570
Livanat...

309
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,570
Fuck!

310
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,570
Shit!

311
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,570
Yes?

312
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,570
I'm coming.

313
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:29,570
We don't have to wait for the CID investigation

314
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,570
to know this was a disaster.

315
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:36,570
It's not enough that a soldier in our unit committed suicide.

316
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,570
She wasn't even a soldier.

317
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,570
She was an impostor.

318
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,570
Five Sergeants sitting in one office and no one even thought about it?

319
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:47,570
She didn't have a military ID card, no dog tag...
 She did have them, Rama.

320
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:52,570
I heard she stole a drill instructors' backpack in a bathroom in Be'er Sheeva.

321
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,570
But if a soldier is coming and no one reported him and he's not on any lists,

322
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,570
You need to report to me immediately!

323
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,570
You said you didn't have time for it.

324
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,570
Come again?

325
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,570
That's what you told Dafi. That you didn't have time for this nonsense.

326
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,570
You have a bad attitude, you know that?

327
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,570
Yeah, you've told me like 700 times.

328
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,570
I'm not supposed to individually take care of every soldier that arrives on this base.

329
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,570
You know why? Because it's not my job.

330
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:13,570
I'm supposed to oversee your job, not do it myself.

331
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:18,570
If one of you would have bothered to call and find out, or told me there was a problem

332
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,570
You could have saved her life.

333
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:21,570
And your ass.

334
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,570
My ass?
Yeah. What's the deal with blaming us?

335
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,570
You're the officer here. Be accountable for this.

336
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,570
I will be accountable for this.

337
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:33,570
For the fact that my soldiers have the worst attitudes. I will be held accountable for that.

338
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,570
I swear, Zohar, I will make a person out of you. You won't go on vacation on my shift.

339
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,570
You're denied of vacation.
 You already did that.

340
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,570
So, another one. Would you like another?

341
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,570
It's already three. How about learning to count?

342
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:49,570
You're right. I'm wrong. Make it four vacations. Shall I continue?

343
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,570
Rama.

344
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,570
Let's go over the details again.

345
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:10,570
She arrived with Dafi yesterday morning at 10:00 AM.

346
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,570
Let's continue this conversation in the conference room, okay?

347
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:34,570
I'm going to kill myself too. It's the only way people will pay attention to me here.

348
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:41,570
If you kill yourself they'll pay attention to you, but you won't be able to enjoy it because you'll be dead.

349
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,570
Have you thought about that? I don't care!

350
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,570
I'm going to kill myself and you need to report that I threatened to do it.

351
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,570
Kill yourself first, then we'll report it.

352
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,570
You don't believe me? We do.

353
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,570
Why not? We wanna see it.

354
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:56,570
I'll drink some white-out. It says, 'Danger. Not for consumption'.

355
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:59,570
Well, now it's empty, but just wait until we get supplies.

356
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:03,570
You'll regret you didn't believe me.  I have some, here you go.

357
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,570
What else are you hiding in that drawer?

358
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:10,570
All this was waiting for you in the registration office, mail Sergeant.

359
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,570
Thanks. Do you know what they call the personnel office on this base?

360
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:16,570
"The Flea Market."

361
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:23,570
That's what they call the personnel offices on every base.
 Not my office! Not over my dead body!

362
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:30,570
Paper Shredding Sergeant, do you think that in-between all your writing and complaining to the Chief of Staff

363
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:36,570
you might find some time to do your job?

364
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:04,570
We thought we didn't recycle anymore so we threw everything together.

365
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:08,570
Can you shred this too please?

366
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:23,570
"Sincerely, Dafta Tsafrir, 6125824"

367
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:27,570
Chief of General Staff. Subject: "Personal request for transfer."

368
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,570
What's this?

369
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,570
You never sent my letters?

370
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,570
Dafi... I can't believe you've been lying to me all this time.

371
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:50,570
I wasn't lying. Yes you were, and you pretended to help me. 
Hey!

372
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:54,570
I worked really hard on these letters and you never sent them!

373
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,570
You didn't send them!

374
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:00,570
I saved you from the humiliation,

375
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,570
They would probably end up in the trash or...

376
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,570
or even worse, on some wall as a joke.

377
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,570
You think my biggest dream is a joke?
Your biggest dream is a little lame, don't you think?

378
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:16,570
I mean...making coffee in the City instead of here. At least here you have me.

379
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,570
Do you think you can find a best friend like me just anywhere?

380
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,570
I hope I never find a friend like you again.

381
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:26,570
Yeah, I have no idea where you can find someone that will wait an hour and a half for you in Be'er Sheeva

382
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,570
so you don't have to walk in to the base alone.

383
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,570
So, you're doing me a favor?

384
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,570
Okay, I'm sorry!

385
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:41,570
I was pissed off at the Army for no reason. You're the one that doesn't give a damn about me,
and you're the reason I'm still here.

386
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:46,570
You know what? Go ahead and send your whiny letters, you naive baby.

387
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:49,570
Let's see who will actually care?

388
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,570
Maybe the Chief of Staff!

389
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:03,570
Explain to me what's so appealing about the City for you?

390
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:10,570
At the end of boot camp they let me choose three bases

391
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:15,570
so I wrote, "Town, City, Town." I understand that, but why?

392
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:19,570
Usually, someone who wants to serve in the City wants to be closer to home

393
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,570
but you're from Haifa.

394
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,570
But I'll live in Tel Aviv and have a real life.

395
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,570
You know that Kiryat is a commuter base.

396
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,570
For a soldier that doesn't live in Central Israel, the IDF has to organize them a place to live,

397
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,570
and pay for a portion of the rent. It's not that simple.

398
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:36,570
But I can't stay here any longer, Anati. Anat.

399
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:50,570
Fill out the reasons for the transfer request and put it in my mailbox.

400
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:53,570
I'll try to forward the request but it'll take some time.

401
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:59,570
I hated my old base too but I didn't act like it was such a tragedy.

402
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,570
So how did you leave?

403
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,570
I went in for Officer Training.

404
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,570
Thanks.

405
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,570
Is everything alright?

406
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,570
"I remember her, I..."

407
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,570
You start with this line, "and then step into me."

408
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:50,570
"I remember it, I remember it from the store..."

409
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:53,570
"I remember it, I remember she bought some semolina."

410
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,570
"I've remembered it a long time, since the third grade..."

411
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,570
Personnel Department. Yes...

412
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:04,570
Hi, can I please get a transfer form?

413
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:07,570
Hi! What?

414
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:11,570
A transfer form. This is the personnel department, isn't it?

415
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:14,570
What, are you leaving?

416
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:20,570
Can you give this to Dafi? I forgot to give it back to her.

417
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,570
So, do you have one?
 What?

418
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:27,570
A transfer form. Yeah. She Has it.
 Okay, thanks.

419
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,570
I'm not kidding, Rama.

420
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:33,570
Can you repeat that?

421
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:36,570
I said I want...
 Louder! To think bigger,

422
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:42,570
to think about what I can give and not about what I can take.

423
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,570
I'd like to be an officer like Rama.

424
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:48,570
I'm honored to have such a role model.

425
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,570
Very impressive.

426
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:56,570
And it's important for me to say that, Rama isn't to blame for...the incident.

427
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,570 
It was us, the receptionists that made the mistake. Myself.

428
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:02,570
It seems like there are plenty of mistakes here.

429
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:07,570
The guilty person was the front gate guard who allowed a civilian in with a fake military ID card.

430
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,570
Ah, okay.

431
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,570
Anyway, it wasn't Rama.

432
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:14,570
Boaz, are you with me? I'm still on the line.

433
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:16,570
Anything else?

434
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:21,570
Yes, Shakedi, I'm here. Are you sitting down? I'm about to tell you something insane. Listen...

435
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:27,570
Wow Dafi, you really put it together huh? Who's next? Liati, right?

436
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,570
G*d forbid. We didn't say that, Rama.

437
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,570
You also want to go to officer training?

438
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,570
Ok, is everyone here?

439
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:37,570
I am very proud of our Dafi.

440
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:42,570
Who came here six months ago...
 Seven and a half months ago.

441
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:45,570
She had a lot of difficulties as we all know, but

442
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:51,570
she's decided to become a solider with high motivation, and get rid of bad influences.

443
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:56,570
And now, she's going to become an officer to the glory of Israel.

444
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:59,570
Cheers!
Hold on, I'm not done yet.

445
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:04,570
I ask that we not only consider it a personal case for Dafi

446
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:08,570
but proof that each of us

447
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:13,570
has a point from which everything starts

448
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,570
and from which

449
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:18,570
the sky is the limit.

450
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,570
Cheers!
 I would also like to say thanks

451
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:26,570
to Rama, who gave me a chance, and wrote me a great recommendation.

452
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,570
Cheers!
 Yeah cheers.

453
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,570
Just don't get drunk.

454
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:34,570
Yeah, you can totally get drunk off of grape juice.

455
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,570
I'll be in my room.

456
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:40,570
Her dream about being a receptionist in the city? It's going to come true.

457
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,570
I'll be an officer in the City.

458
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,570
How do you know where you'll be placed?

459
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,570
You know Guy Shefi, the officer?

460
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,570
So, he is transferring there, and he's going to place me in his department.

461
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:52,570
Hey, don't you think it's hilarious that the most spoiled soldier

462
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:56,570
that has to take a nap, that won't touch anything,

463
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:00,570
that showers in her bathing suit, that has as many allergies and medical excuses 

464
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:04,570
as grains of sand in this desert, is going to be an officer in the IDF?

465
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:08,570
So what are you going to be?
 I'll be the head officer in a Lt. Colonel's office.

466
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,570
Wow! That's good.

467
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,570
Zohar, did you drink all the wine?

468
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,570
The City cake.

469
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:25,570
This is Azrieli Mall, above the Ayalon South interchange.
 Where will you be?

470
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:37,570
It's grape juice!

471
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,570
Are you crying?

472
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:46,570
No, I just hate throwing up.

473
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:51,570
It's the only thing stopping me from being an anorexic, bulimic like you.

474
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,570
Here, drink.

475
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:24,570
Of all the guys on base, you have to choose him?

476
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:27,570
It's just coincidence.

477
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,570
He's leaving anyway.

478
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:35,570
I was saving you from the humiliation.

479
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:57,570
Episode 2. The Virgin.

480
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,570
C'mon, Irena, when?

481
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:34,570
At 14.
 Oh, it's not that bad.

482
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:38,570
I thought it was a lot earlier. With who?

483
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,570
Some guy. He was my neighbor.

484
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:44,570
I was 17, on July 17th. Such a nice date.

485
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:50,570
I did it in the summer between 10th and 11th grade. In summer camp with one of the camp counselors.

486
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,570
Zohar, what about you?

487
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,570
Zohar. What?
What do you mean, "what"?

488
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:58,570
I didn't hear what you guys were talking about.
 Yeah right.

489
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:02,570
Greetings. I'm not checking, nagger.
 You were just here yesterday.

490
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,570
Can you check?
Not now, okay? Go see her.

491
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,570
Oh, c'mon. Check for me. It'll only take a second. When am I getting discharged?

492
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,570
Dude, I'm the mailman.

493
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,570
If you want, get inside an envelope and I'll mail you to your mom.

494
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,570
Okay, Okay, come here for a sec. Yogev...

495
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:18,570
Interesting. They say all the action is at the kibbutz.

496
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:24,570
So go there on your way to Russia. Tell them you came to volunteer.

497
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,570
Is it possible I'm the only virgin in Southern Israel?

498
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,570
I'm the only virgin in my kibbutz, that's for sure.

499
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:34,570
All the ugliest girls have already done it besides me.

500
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:42,570
Stop counting us all the time!
 Quiet.

501
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,570
We're not going to multiply.

502
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,570
Ne'ama.

503
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:54,570
It's also clear that I'm the only virgin on this base.

504
00:38:54,570 --> 00:39:01,570
It's true that everyone here is a slut, but I dont want to feel that different.

505
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,570
Liat.

506
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,570
Zohar.

507
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:18,570
God, please make me normal.

508
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,570
I don't want to die a virgin.

509
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:24,570
I mean, I don't want to die in general, but

510
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,570
Not as a virgin for sure.

511
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:29,570
Girls, let's pay attention.

512
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:36,570
I know it's tough and hot and you're tired, but it's important to pay close attention.

513
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,570
Shira isn't feeling well. She's going to pass out.

514
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,570
Yeah, Rama. I'm going to pass out.

515
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,570
So, Shira can go sit in the shade.

516
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,570
Can I go with her to the shade, in case she needs help?

517
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:52,570
No! If she needs help she'll tell us.

518
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:58,570
Now that we've taken care of all the patients, I have something to say.

519
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:02,570
Hilit and me went through officer training together.

520
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:06,570
Instructional Base #12. "Respect and Power."

521
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,570
We went through a lot together and she's like my twin sister.

522
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:13,570
Here you go, Hilit.

523
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:19,570
What am I supposed to do when I see a suspect approaching the base?

524
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:22,570
Like...someone with a fake military ID card?

525
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:27,570
No, a real suspect. What should I do?

526
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,570
Shout?

527
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:34,570
When I'm on guarding duty at the front gate, and the security of the base is my responsibility

528
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:37,570
and I see a suspect approaching

529
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:41,570
and all I have at my disposal are my awareness, my efficiency,

530
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:45,570
my responsibility for base security, and my M-16.

531
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:48,570
What should I do?
Shoot?

532
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:51,570
Just like that? Shoot?

533
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:55,570
What if I kill an innocent person?

534
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:59,570
Just for this kind of situation, there's a suspect handling procedure.

535
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:03,570
If a suspect approaches the front entrance, I first shout: "Stop!"

536
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,570
Repeat after me.

537
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:05,570
Stop!

538
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:10,570
He doesn't stop, so I shout: "Stop and identify yourself!"

539
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,570
"Stop and identify yourself!"

540
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,570
He still doesn't stop.

541
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,570
I shout: "Stop or I'll shoot!"

542
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:20,570
Stop or I'll shoot!
Still, he doesn't stop.

543
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:23,570
Now, pay attention. I cock my weapon for intimidation purposes.

544
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:27,570
If he still doesn't stop, I fire into the air. If he still doesn't stop, I shoot at his legs.

545
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,570
But...
Let me finish, I'll allow questions after.

546
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:33,570
But what if he does stop?

547
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:38,570
No, seriously. What if he does stop?

548
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:41,570
If he does stop, call me.

549
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,570
Now Zohar, because you ask all these questions.

550
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:47,570
You have the honor of covering the first guard shift.

551
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,570
At least you'll be first at something.

552
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,570
What did you say?

553
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,570
Okay, girls. Let's continue.

554
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:57,570
Answer me, bitch! Did you say: "At least be first at something?"

555
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:01,570
Calm down. I said: "not a very good twin sister".

556
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:04,570
Girls! Let's continue.

557
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:20,570
Would you like some advice?
No.

558
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,570
Some free advice.
 I don't want it.

559
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:27,570
You need a man.
 Oh. That's the advice.

560
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:30,570
You need to get laid and the sooner the better.

561
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:33,570
"You need to get laid and the sooner the better."

562
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:36,570
You're quite the romantic poet.

563
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:40,570
If you want romance, you need to pop your cherry first.

564
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:43,570
Nobody will want you like you are.

565
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:46,570
An uptight virgin with cobwebs on her pussy.

566
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:49,570
Wow, you really are disgusting.

567
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:53,570
How can a girl with so many facial creams be so disgusting on the outside?

568
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:56,570
You better listen to me. Find a man, now.

569
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:01,570
The first man you see, have sex with him as soon as possible, before it's too late.

570
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:06,570
Ok, Irena. Maybe in Russia a woman needs a man to justify her existence.

571
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:09,570
Drop the old sayings. You're in the Western World.

572
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:10,570
Idiot.

573
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:12,570
Look at an Atlas.

574
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,570
I used to live in the West. Now I'm here.

575
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:26,570
Gil Mesika and Liran Stoler, you're at the front entrance.

576
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,570
Rotem Ganon, and Nimrod Cohen, you're in the open.

577
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:34,570
Shir Ben Ezra and Adi Bracha, you're on patrol.

578
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,570
Gal Mizrahi and Shuki Solomon, you're in the guard tower.

579
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:43,570
Oleg Kovalski and Ran Saporta, you're at the rear entrance.

580
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:46,570
So, who's left?
 Just me.

581
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:49,570
Zohar. Right.

582
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:52,570
You're protecting the arsenal.

583
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:56,570
What...by myself? I don't have a partner?

584
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:59,570
Weaponry is a one man guard position because it's inside the base.

585
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:03,570
You stand here, and once an hour walk around the building.

586
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:05,570
You're not allowed to sit or use your phone.

587
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:09,570
So, what? I'm supposed to stand here for 4 hours without doing anything?

588
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:12,570
You asked for equal rights. Here they are.

589
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:14,570
Where are you going to be?

590
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:17,570
Where am I going to be when, I mean, while when I'm on guard duty?

591
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:19,570
Asleep.

592
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:23,570
You'll probably be in all kinds of girls' dreams.

593
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:26,570
What?
 Do you have a girlfriend?

594
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:30,570
Ok, have a good one. Bye.

595
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:33,570
I said, do you have a girlfriend?

596
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:37,570
Boyfriend.

597
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:42,570
If something happens, call the officer on duty.

598
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:46,570
Don't worry, nothing's going to happen.

599
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:50,570
Nothing will happen because this is my life.

600
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:54,570
I wish some guy would come. Doesn't have to be a stud, but...

601
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:57,570
okay, not a catch. Mediocre. Average.

602
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:00,570
Someone that would want me.

603
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:07,570
Who's there?

604
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,570
Stop or I'll shoot!

605
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:12,570
What is it? Oh my G*d, put the weapon down!
 Who are you?

606
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:15,570
Meir. I'm looking for the store.

607
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:17,570
You're not from the base?

608
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:20,570
No, I'm from Maglan. We're training here.

609
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:24,570
Can you stand in the light for a second?

610
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:32,570
You guys are serious around here, huh?

611
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,570
Yeah, sorry.

612
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:40,570
I'm Zohar. Hi.
 Hi Zohar. Nice to meet you.

613
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:43,570
So, where's the store?

614
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:47,570
I'd show you but I can't leave my post.

615
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:50,570
No problem, just tell me how to get there.

616
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:53,570
Hold on, how long are you guys staying here?
Until...

617
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:55,570
the day after tomorrow?

618
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:58,570
So...If you like..maybe...

619
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:01,570
tomorrow night I can show you where it is and

620
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:04,570
other places on base. If you like.

621
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:07,570
Ok, cool. So tomorrow at...

622
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:11,570
10 PM work for you? Ok, cool.
 So tomorrow at...

623
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:16,570
Yeah. Yeah, it works for me.
 Great, we're on.

624
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:20,570
But still, can you tell me where the store is?

625
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:23,570
The guys are waiting for their smokes and...

626
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:27,570
Yeah, it's right there. Walk down this path a couple of meters. The red door.

627
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:31,570
Oh. Thanks.

628
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:37,570
So tomorrow? At 10, in the store.

629
00:46:56,570 --> 00:47:00,570
Oh, my G*d!

630
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:17,570
Oh, come on! Help me up, will you?

631
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:20,570
I'm not dead yet.

632
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:25,570
Give her a hand.

633
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:31,570
Where am I supposed to sleep now, on the floor?

634
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,570
You can sleep on the empty bed.

635
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:37,570
Oh, now it's called "the empty bed".

636
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:40,570
That girl slit her veins and peeled the skin off her body

637
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:42,570
and you expect me to sleep in her bed?

638
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:44,570
Quiet! I'm trying to sleep.

639
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,570
Sorry for disturbing you! I almost died!

640
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:49,570
Why just almost?

641
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:53,570
I'm not going to sleep in her bed. I'm sorry, but that's where I draw the line.

642
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,570
They changed the mattress, Zohar. It's not that bad.

643
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:59,570
You sleep there if it's not that bad.

644
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:02,570
"Hear my voice

645
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:05,570
"distant friend of mine..."

646
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:08,570
"do you hear my voice..."

647
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:11,570
"where are you now?"

648
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:20,570
I'll sleep on her bed, alright? Get in my bed and be quiet.

649
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:23,570
Coward. Paranoid virgin.

650
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:27,570
What's that got to do with anything?

651
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:32,570
Well done, Irene. Really nice of you.
Take note of this.

652
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:40,570
It smells weird here.
Good night.

653
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:42,570
Smells like...

654
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:44,570
Russian sausages.

655
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:49,570
You'd kill for a Russian sausage in that bed.

656
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:57,570
There is no such thing as ghosts, Liati.

657
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:02,570
So, not a ghost. Maybe a demon that's possessing her.

658
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:08,570
There aren't any ghosts, or demons, or little gnomes that do our work at night.

659
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:13,570
Look at her. She's acting so strange.

660
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:26,570
I'm the adjutancy inspection officer.

661
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:29,570
What am I going to pick?

662
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:38,570
August 2003, Headquarters. Let's take a look.

663
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:42,570
What do we have here? August 24th, logistics report.

664
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:46,570
It says here that the soldier...

665
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:48,570
Och..Oochi...

666
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:52,570
"Ochperkovich." Ochperkovich, Tomer didn't attend logistics on this date

667
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:57,570
because of vacation. That's what it says.

668
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:04,570
Now, soldier. Please show me the supporting documentation for it.

669
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:10,570
Human Resources inspections are the crucible for combatants. It's the biggest test for personnel.

670
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:16,570
Every attribute of every soldier on every date, needs to be coordinated and documented.

671
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:21,570
Vacations, ranks, court marshals, absenteeism, transfer forms, everything!

672
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:24,570
It only takes one mistake in order to fail.

673
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:27,570
And the inspection is random.

674
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:29,570
Random is incidental.

675
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:33,570
Do you understand what that means? 
 What does it mean?

676
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:36,570
That we could use a little luck?

677
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:41,570
That we need to go through every binder, every page, check and update

678
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:44,570
because those who count on luck, Zohar, we've seen what happens to them.

679
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:47,570
Rama, we'll never be able to update everything here.
Do you realize the mess in this office?

680
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:51,570
According to my calculations, if we get into a rhythm,

681
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:54,570
We should be able to get through everything by Thursday,

682
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,570
And get four hours of sleep per night.

683
00:51:56,570 --> 00:52:01,570
It's in our hands and we won't just pass this inspection. We'll pass with flying colors.

684
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:04,570
Let's go girls. Let's have some fun!

685
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:09,570
Now, I understand there's some sort of issue about a ghost that's possessing Irena.

686
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:12,570
Irena, is this true? Irena?

687
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:17,570
Irena, you just have to put the pages in the plastic covers, okay?

688
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:28,570
It says Shimi Samouha wasn't here for like a week.

689
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:31,570
It doesn't say why, nothing.

690
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:34,570
Here, send him on vacation.

691
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:40,570
Fuck, it's never-ending!

692
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:44,570
You see how fast time flies?

693
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:54,570
Good joke with the ghost thing, really.

694
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:58,570
Who would have thought you'd be so brilliant with the idea and the acting.

695
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:03,570
I really think something happened to her.

696
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:25,570
Rama? Yeah.

697
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:30,570
Irena's not doing well at all. I think I should take her to the infirmary.

698
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:35,570
To the infirmary? What exactly are they going to do? An exorcism?

699
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:38,570
It's better if a professional sees her,

700
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:41,570
so we don't have another...

701
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:43,570
Tehila incident.

702
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:46,570
Okay, go. And get back ASAP.

703
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:50,570
Every minute you're not here is less sleep for the other girls.

704
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,570
Sure.

705
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:01,570
Irena, well done.

706
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:07,570
You do realize we just escaped hell

707
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:13,570
and the devil himself opened the gate for us.

708
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:19,570
Aren't we going to the infirmary?
Are you crazy? Let's go to the barracks.

709
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:22,570
But you told Rama I need to go to the infirmary.

710
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:27,570
Go to the infirmary if you want. I just have to go.

711
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:32,570
I had a neighbor in Oropinsk that got stabbed

712
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:35,570
and I saw his hand coming out of the drawer.

713
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:39,570
Irena, enough with the creepy thing. You're starting to scare me.

714
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:41,570
Why are you putting on make up?

715
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:44,570
Remember telling me I had to lose my virginity ASAP?

716
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:45,570
No.

717
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:49,570
Well, you did, and you were right. That's exactly what I'm going to do.

718
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:51,570
Can I come with you?

719
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:53,570
What? No!

720
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:57,570
Why don't you go to your friends room?
I don't have any friends.

721
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:02,570
Then go read a Russian book.

722
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:08,570
You said you'd take me to the infirmary.

723
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:11,570
So, go to the infirmary, psycho.

724
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:14,570
Be thankful I got you out of the office, and stop following me.

725
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:17,570
Please don't leave me alone.

726
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:21,570
But I'm going to attend to some private business. You know?

727
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:23,570
Come on, Irena.

728
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,570
I found a cute guy and he's into me.

729
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,570
He's not from here and he's leaving tomorrow.

730
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:31,570
I won't be in the way.

731
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:33,570
How so? It's a date!

732
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:39,570
If you don't let me come along, I'll tell Rama we didn't go to the infirmary.

733
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:47,570
I see the "ghost" didn't change your lousy attitude.

734
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:54,570
You're going to be invisible like air, got it? Air!

735
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:25,570
You're early.

736
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:28,570
So are you.

737
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:30,570
I like it.

738
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:32,570
I like you too.

739
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:44,570
This is Irena. She's sitting with us for personal reasons, but she won't be in the way.

740
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:48,570
Awesome. Hi, Irena.
Hello.

741
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:57,570
Boot camp was horrible. The worst five months of my life.

742
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:02,570
They kicked our asses. Treated us like the holocaust.

743
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:05,570
Like the holocaust?
 Irena, what did we talk about?

744
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:07,570
You know, meaning it was really bad.

745
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:10,570
You can't use that expression any way you wish.
 Irena!

746
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:13,570
But it's true. The drill Instructors were actually nazis.

747
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:15,570
Huh. So, what did they do?

748
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:18,570
First of all, they killed six million of us.

749
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:23,570
We went on vacations by train only.

750
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:26,570
Irena, I'm kidding. Loosen up. Smile a little.

751
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:28,570
What...

752
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:32,570
What...how long have you been in the unit?

753
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:36,570
About 11 months.
 Cool. The commanders aren't nazis there?

754
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:38,570
No way. They're great.

755
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:41,570
But never mind, these jokes offend Irena.

756
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:47,570
How the hell do they offend Irena? What does it have to do with her?
The Russians weren't even in the Holocaust.

757
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:50,570
Okay, I'm gonna get us some drinks. What are you having?

758
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:53,570
Diet Coke.
 Diet Coke for the lady, and for you?

759
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:58,570
Nothing.
Diet Coke and nothing coming your way.

760
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:02,570
What's your deal? We agreed you're gonna be like air.

761
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:04,570
I didn't order anything.

762
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:08,570
Just go back to the barracks. Can't you see we're starting to connect?

763
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:12,570
Vacation, huh? She was enslaving us until now.

764
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:16,570
Do you mind switching tables? It's just that someone's already sitting here.

765
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:19,570
Who? Who? Now you're talking in two voices? Someone!

766
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:22,570
So, it's not enough that we do your work,

767
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:25,570
Now we have to eat standing like horses while you sit on your ass?

768
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:29,570
Eat in the barracks, blood suckers!
 We feel like sitting here.

769
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:33,570
I'm telling you, I'm in the middle of something and this seat is taken!

770
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:36,570
No problem. I'll get another chair.

771
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:38,570
Hi!

772
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:42,570
What's up? My sister.

773
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:11,570
Look. You have nine cans here. Let's see you knock

774
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:14,570
them all out at once.

775
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:34,570
Get away from me, maniac!

776
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:36,570
You were gone for a while.

777
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:38,570
Like anybody noticed.

778
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:46,570
I did. You. It's because of you all the idiots came to our table.

779
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:48,570
They saw you.

780
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:51,570
Turns out I'm the air on this date.

781
01:01:18,570 --> 01:01:22,570
Damn it, there's no privacy around here.

782
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:26,570
Where should we go?
 You tell me.

783
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:36,570
Everything alright?
 Yeah.

784
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:40,570
All this time in the infirmary?
 Where?

785
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:43,570
The infirmary, yeah.
  Welcome back.

786
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:46,570
We're almost done with the soldiers. Tomorrow we'll finish the officers.

787
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:49,570
What would really be helpful is if you guys would clean up this mess.

788
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:55,570
Okay. So...I'm just gonna go get the broom.
 The broom's right here.

789
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:57,570
So I'll...

790
01:01:57,570 --> 01:02:00,570
I'll get some rags from the other office. We'll clean thoroughly here.

791
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:40,570
Hold on. Just a sec.

792
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:46,570
Can you be a little more gentle?

793
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:49,570
What?
More gentle.

794
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:52,570
I'm just...not used to it.

795
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:55,570
You want it to be gentle?
Yeah.

796
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:57,570
A little.

797
01:02:57,570 --> 01:03:00,570
if you want it gentle, go find a civilian.

798
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:02,570
I'm just coming from training, sweetie.

799
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:12,570
Hold on, hold on.

800
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:18,570
What happened, sweetie? 
I thought you wanted it.

801
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:37,570
Hold on...No...Wait...

802
01:03:37,570 --> 01:03:39,570
Hold on...No, stop.

803
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:43,570
Stop!

804
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:48,570
Stop or I'll shoot.

805
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:51,570
Put the gun down!

806
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,570
You get dressed!

807
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:56,570
Not you!

808
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:00,570
What do you think you're doing?
Huh?

809
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:04,570
What do you think you're doing to this girl?
What makes you

810
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:07,570
think you can stick your ugly dick wherever you want?

811
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:10,570
That's a lady in front of you, not a garbage can.

812
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:13,570
I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry for interrupting you.

813
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:15,570
Go.
Where?

814
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:17,570
Over there!

815
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:27,570
Pick up your stuff.

816
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:33,570
Walk!

817
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:35,570
Stop!

818
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:38,570
See that trash can?

819
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:41,570
Fuck it!

820
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:45,570
What?
Fuck that trash can.

821
01:04:45,570 --> 01:04:49,570
Now! Was I not clear?
What...

822
01:04:49,570 --> 01:04:51,570
What do you mean by, 'fuck the trash can?'

823
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:55,570
What you were doing to Zohar, do it to the trash can.
But...

824
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:08,570
What? Suddenly you can't?

825
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:10,570
You're insane.

826
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:14,570
What were you thinking, that you can bang whoever you want?

827
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:23,570
Give me his clothes.

828
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:28,570
Leave and don't come back.

829
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:35,570
I need my rifle back.
 I can't give it back to you.

830
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:38,570
Irena, give him back his rifle. What are you doing?

831
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:40,570
He'll kill us.

832
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:44,570
Give me back my rifle and I won't do anything to you. I swear.

833
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:46,570
They'll put me in military prison.

834
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:49,570
Haven't I gone through enough?

835
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:58,570
Thank you.

836
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:14,570
Rama!
Rama!  No more Rama. You're done.

837
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:17,570
Just so you know, I almost got raped and killed.

838
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:19,570
Why can't I believe a word coming out of your mouth?

839
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:22,570
Ask Irena if you don't believe me.

840
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:24,570
I have no idea what she's talking about.

841
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:31,570
Irena! You were just pointing an M-16 rifle at a soldier, about to kill him!

842
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:32,570
What the hell are you talking about?

843
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:36,570
You're no longer possessed! That's what happened! Rama, listen.

844
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:40,570
Tehila's ghost possessed Irena while she was sleeping in her bed.

845
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:44,570
And then she sent Irena to avenge all the assholes that hurt her and...

846
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:47,570
And now Tehila's ghost left Irena's body

847
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,570
And that's the reason Irena doesn't recall any of it!

848
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:55,570
I called the infirmary and asked if you were there. 
Guess what?

849
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:59,570
Right, we weren't in the infirmary, but that has nothing to do with it.

850
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:02,570
What would you do if you were me?

851
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:05,570
What?
I'm asking you.

852
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:06,570
What would you do?

853
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:09,570
In regards to what?
 In regards to you!

854
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:14,570
What would you do if you were me?

855
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:20,570
I can't imagine a situation like that.

856
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:25,570
Go to the barracks.
 Good night.

857
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:36,570
Your friends are working their butts off and so am I. We're giving everything to this office.

858
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:38,570
And what does it look like?

859
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:40,570
Disgusting.

860
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:42,570
When I come back in the morning,

861
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:45,570
I don't want to recognize this place, because it's going to be spotless.

862
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:51,570
Organized, tidy, without this dust and these extra papers all over the place.

863
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:52,570
A new office!

864
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:54,570
But it's going to take me the whole night.

865
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:57,570
Why not do it all together tomorrow morning?

866
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:58,570
What wasn't clear about my orders?

867
01:07:58,570 --> 01:08:02,570
I don't understand why you're calling me out and giving me the most brutal punishments

868
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:04,570
I'm doing this for you.

869
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:09,570
Because one day you'll wake up and realize that you spent two years in the IDF and didn't do anything.

870
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:12,570
Didn't leave your mark.

871
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:16,570
While there are soldiers that sacrifice their lives.

872
01:08:16,570 --> 01:08:23,570
So here it is, your chance to contribute a little to the Army.

873
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:21,570
Careful. It's still wet here.

874
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:02,570
Where are all the pages?

875
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:07,570
You told me to shred all the extra papers.

876
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:12,570
Those in the trash cans. Not the ones we need.

877
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:18,570
We don't need so much paper. It just makes our lives complicated.

878
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:24,570
So where are the old records?

879
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:26,570
In your office.

880
01:10:51,570 --> 01:10:53,570
Rama?

881
01:10:55,570 --> 01:10:56,570
Rama?

882
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:15,570
Episode 3: The Commander

883
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:26,570
Mitzpe Ramon (Town in the Negev)

884
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:30,570
Officers' Training School

885
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:38,570
One, attack. Two, freeze. Three, elbow. Four, knee, the knee, the knee.

886
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:40,570
Knee, good. Now switch.

887
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:42,570
Let's go, Let's go!

888
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:46,570
68, two...

889
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:50,570
69, training is almost over, Up!

890
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:54,570
Yelena, you're not trying! 70!

891
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:58,570
Up! I can do this all day. 71, I have time.

892
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:04,570
Up! 90 degree knees, 72!

893
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:08,570
How do you expect to get attention if you can't do sit ups?

894
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:13,570
76! Faster! Up!

895
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:15,570
77!

896
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:37,570
You'll never finish training like that, Dafi. 87!

897
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:42,570
Up! Look at you. 88, Disgrace!

898
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:44,570
Up!

899
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:47,570
Responsibility! Question:

900
01:12:47,570 --> 01:12:50,570
What is so unique about accomplishing the goal?

901
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:55,570
Yeah.
Equality. Good. Moving on.

902
01:12:59,570 --> 01:13:02,570
Hi, this is Zohar. Don't leave me voicemails because I can't hear them.

903
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:04,570
So get lost. Bye.

904
01:13:04,570 --> 01:13:07,570
The soldiers in training, in order to calculate who's going to ask for sick days and when...

905
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:08,570
Personnel Department. Hello.

906
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:10,570
Hi, may I speak to Zohar?

907
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:15,570
Who is this, Dafi? Yeah. Can I speak to Zohar?

908
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:16,570
Zohar is in prison.

909
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:18,570
What? Why?

910
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:19,570
She shredded the entire office.

911
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:21,570
Why are you whispering? I can't hear you.

912
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:23,570
Because Rama doesn't want us to talk about it.

913
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:26,570
Anyway, Zohar got three months prison time.

914
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:28,570
Three months in prison?

915
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:40,570
I was just planning on moving up the ranks in the Army. I mean, go far and...

916
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:43,570
I know it was pretty bad after we failed the inspection,

917
01:13:43,570 --> 01:13:47,570
but look how the office has progressed since then. 
 Greatly.

918
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:51,570
Look, we don't have the quota to promote you.

919
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:53,570
What, but... why isn't there a quota?

920
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:59,570
There was only one quota for non-combatants and the Education Office got it.

921
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:04,570
Rama, It's ok. You're getting discharged.

922
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:07,570
Is it because I'm a woman?

923
01:14:07,570 --> 01:14:11,570
The education officer is a woman.

924
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:12,570
Yeah, I...

925
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:15,570
Rama, you've been outstanding, and no one can take that away from you.

926
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:18,570
Don't think I overlooked the fact that you're talented and dedicated.

927
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:22,570
But looking at other aspects, personal communication, and the ability to command efficiently

928
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:25,570
are also very important for a military career.

929
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:03,570
To Rama and Liat. Good luck in your future endeavors.

930
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:14,570
Thank you, Boaz.

931
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:18,570
Damn. Shira left...now you.

932
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:21,570
Namonet is leaving as well. It'll be just me very soon.

933
01:15:21,570 --> 01:15:27,570
Guys, today we are saying goodbye to an officer that gave 110 percent of herself.

934
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:29,570
So, a round of applause for Rama.

935
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:32,570
Rama, good luck with your civilian life.

936
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:36,570
I also prepared something.

937
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:46,570
Franz Kafka once said: "The chains that cuff humanity..."

938
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:49,570
"...are made of office paper."

939
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:53,570
And really, after we lost all the records, I was lost.

940
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:58,570
But in the past few weeks, we started the digital records restoration,

941
01:15:58,570 --> 01:16:03,570
broke loose from the papers, and I'm proud to announce that we are the most advanced

942
01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:06,570
and eco-friendly office in the IDF.

943
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:09,570
And big thanks to Zachi, our great computer systems officer,

944
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:11,570
who worked day and night.

945
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:13,570
Cheers!
 Hold on.

946
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:19,570
I would like to end on a personal note...

947
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:21,570
Excuse me, Boaz?

948
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:26,570
Ofer is waiting in the office. He says it's urgent. The region just got hot.

949
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:29,570
Okay, get the operations officer and company officer for an evaluation. Nir, come.

950
01:16:29,570 --> 01:16:32,570
Rama, good luck with your civilian life.

951
01:16:32,570 --> 01:16:34,570
Thank you, Boaz.

952
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:39,570
Have fun! Thank you.

953
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:46,570
You can go ahead and eat the pie if you like. My mom made it.

954
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:49,570
Thanks, Zachi.

955
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:53,570
Well...

956
01:16:54,570 --> 01:16:57,570
Okay, good luck...I'll be in the office for now.

957
01:16:57,570 --> 01:16:58,570
Good luck, Rama.

958
01:17:03,570 --> 01:17:06,570
First Lieutenant, Daphne Tsafrir!

959
01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:12,570
First Lieutenant, Shira Pinchas!

960
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:16,570
First in class, Tama Lahav...

961
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:44,570
Dafi, the commanders are very proud of you.

962
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:47,570
I'm speaking on behalf of all of us.

963
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:50,570
You arrived here as a soldier that didn't believe in herself.

964
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:55,570
You came a long way in empowering yourself and now, 
there is an officer sitting before of us

965
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:57,570
a success.

966
01:17:57,570 --> 01:18:01,570
You're going from here to additional training and this is your placement.

967
01:18:01,570 --> 01:18:03,570
Good luck.

968
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:18,570
No, this can't be. It's a mistake.

969
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:21,570
For sure, I'm supposed to be placed in the city.

970
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:26,570
I'm supposed to be placed in the City. It's...it's all been taken care of.

971
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:30,570
No. No. It's not a mistake. It's correct.

972
01:18:34,570 --> 01:18:35,570
Dafi?

973
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:42,570
We've all been so impressed by your motivation.

974
01:18:42,570 --> 01:18:48,570
You remember that we're here to serve the military. Right?

975
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:55,570
For six months I've been suffering this training

976
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:58,570
and what helped me make it was believing I'd be placed in the City.

977
01:18:58,570 --> 01:19:02,570
It's too exaggerated. There's a war going on out there. Pull yourself together.

978
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:04,570
War? I'm just a non-combatant officer!

979
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:09,570
What? Our soldiers are getting killed and here you are, crying over your placement?

980
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:14,570
Come on, Dafi. Let's not be disgraceful.

981
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:24,570
In regards to the medical aspect, evacuation is based on two ambulances in Ze'ev.

982
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:27,570
This week we're expecting a heat index of 3, so we're supplying a water tanker of course.

983
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:31,570
We need to pay attention that everyone drinks because last week three trainees were evacuated.

984
01:19:31,570 --> 01:19:34,570
It was a long hour until that wretched doctor found them. One is still in the hospital.

985
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:36,570
And listen, I don't want to have anymore incidents.

986
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:38,570
Okay, did the maintenance officer update you?

987
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:43,570
Okay. Pay attention to the next move. Zohar...Quiet

988
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:46,570
What about that coffee? All the officers are waiting.

989
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:47,570
Hold on...

990
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:51,570
I'm going to break the record.

991
01:19:51,570 --> 01:19:56,570
Let's not be disgraceful.There's a war going on out there and you're playing computer games?

992
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:57,570
What do you want? I'm sweeping mines over here!

993
01:19:57,570 --> 01:20:00,570
It's really dangerous.

994
01:20:06,570 --> 01:20:08,570
The crowd is on its feet.

995
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:10,570
All the Mine Sweeper champions...

996
01:20:10,570 --> 01:20:17,570
and she's clearing her targets with no fear.

997
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:21,570
Who's the boss? Me!
 Alright, shut up, shut up, shut up.

998
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:25,570
Thank you, G*d! I broke the world record!

999
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:27,570
You really have an attitude.

1000
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:30,570
This talk sounds familiar.

1001
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:33,570
Is that what they teach you at officer training? Respect?

1002
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:36,570
You'll get up right now and take these trays for me.

1003
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:38,570
I can't get up. We're in the middle of a bet.

1004
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:39,570
Excuse me?

1005
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:42,570
We're betting who can last the longest without getting off their chair.

1006
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:48,570
With all due respect, I have no intention of losing to these green soldiers.

1007
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:51,570
Zohar, I already prepared everything. Just serve this please.

1008
01:20:55,570 --> 01:20:57,570
Give me a push, come on!

1009
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:02,570
Zohar, stop it!

1010
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:06,570
Zohar! You will get off of that chair right now.

1011
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:11,570
But this is a new start. Finally, they won't check out our asses.

1012
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:16,570
Zohar Ben Ari, you just got denied your vacation.

1013
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:18,570
I understand that you want to act like a commander

1014
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:21,570
because you're upset that you got screwed and have to stay here for double the time, but

1015
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:25,570
I'm sorry. I'm going to have fun here and not suffer.

1016
01:21:25,570 --> 01:21:27,570
My time is valuable.

1017
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:30,570
Even if I can't wait for it to be over.

1018
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:34,570
So, take it down a notch with this, "denial of vacation" thing.

1019
01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:36,570
Are you trying me?

1020
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:39,570
Don't repeat her like that. Poor thing, she's sick.

1021
01:21:39,570 --> 01:21:42,570
She has First Lieutenant sickness.

1022
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:44,570
But it will pass, right, Dafi?

1023
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:48,570
Okay, well it seems you're enjoying each others company.

1024
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:52,570
So from now on, every punishment Zohar gets will carry on to all of you.

1025
01:21:52,570 --> 01:21:55,570
Is that clear? You have 10 seconds to get in formation.

1026
01:21:55,570 --> 01:21:59,570
Formation? There's only four of us.
 Let's go.

1027
01:22:05,570 --> 01:22:08,570
When welcoming an officer, the office soldiers will stand at attention.

1028
01:22:08,570 --> 01:22:09,570
Two, three...Attention.

1029
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:12,570
What are you? A Drill Instructor?

1030
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:15,570
Give me a hundred sit ups.
 Yeah, right!

1031
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:18,570
Okay, like I said before, the punishment carries on to all of you and

1032
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:21,570
now you need to give me a hundred sit ups.

1033
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:25,570
Quickly, or it's going to be 200.

1034
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:33,570
One, two, two...

1035
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:34,570
Have you lost your mind?

1036
01:22:34,570 --> 01:22:41,570
I'm your officer now. Get it already.

1037
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:42,570
I'm an officer now.

1038
01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:47,570
"I will appreciate if you consider my difficulties of being in a desert"

1039
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:49,570
"that triggers my allergic reactions."

1040
01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:54,570
"I'm under close observation by orthopedists and surgeons"

1041
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:58,570
"And so, I would be able to contribute more if I am stationed in the City rather than Shizafon Base."

1042
01:22:58,570 --> 01:23:00,570
It's important for me."

1043
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:50,570
You're so mean.

1044
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:54,570
Zohar, look at me.

1045
01:23:54,570 --> 01:23:56,570
Commander.

1046
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:59,570
You can't make me look at you.

1047
01:23:59,570 --> 01:24:00,570
Especially not while I'm eating.

1048
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:04,570
Don't you have even a little respect for our past friendship?

1049
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:08,570
Friendship? You just cared about getting out of here.

1050
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:10,570
A true friendship is to stick together.

1051
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:14,570
A true friendship is that you care about somone, with no regards to their location.

1052
01:24:14,570 --> 01:24:17,570
And you only care about yourself.

1053
01:24:17,570 --> 01:24:20,570
Stop playing, we're having a conversation.

1054
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:23,570
I can't stop playing, my dear,

1055
01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:29,790
because I'm about to set another record.

1056
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:33,570
I'm going to delete them. All these games.

1057
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:37,570
Delete? You don't even know where "Enter" is.

1058
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:39,570
You barely even know how to turn it on.

1059
01:24:39,570 --> 01:24:43,570
Here it is. Pretty simple.

1060
01:24:47,570 --> 01:24:50,570
Don't Touch it.
 Move, Zohar, you're in the way.

1061
01:24:50,570 --> 01:24:53,570
I'm just reminding you that mine and your highest scores in "Average Mine Sweeper" are on this computer.

1062
01:24:53,570 --> 01:24:55,570
Been set to "Minesweeper" on this computer.

1063
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:57,570
I don't care about the high scores anymore.

1064
01:24:57,570 --> 01:25:02,570
These high scores are the best achievements you will ever have.

1065
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:18,570
Don't move.

1066
01:25:19,570 --> 01:25:21,570
Cut the bullshit.

1067
01:25:23,570 --> 01:25:25,570
The next one will be right between your eyes.

1068
01:25:25,570 --> 01:25:27,570
Zohar, Stop! You're insane.

1069
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:31,570
Get off the computer.
 No.

1070
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:12,570
Dafi, I'm warning you.

1071
01:26:36,570 --> 01:26:41,570
Dafi! Don't you touch my computer!

1072
01:26:41,570 --> 01:26:43,570
Dafi!

1073
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:46,570
Don't you touch my computer!

1074
01:26:55,570 --> 01:26:58,570
Did something happen in your office?

1075
01:26:58,570 --> 01:27:00,570
It's really private.

1076
01:27:00,570 --> 01:27:01,570
I'm talking about the server rack.

1077
01:27:01,570 --> 01:27:05,570
The what? The master server system. Did anyone touch it?

1078
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:08,570
Because I'm missing some information.

1079
01:27:10,570 --> 01:27:13,570
It's Zachi from computing. Can you please open up?

1080
01:27:16,570 --> 01:27:23,570
I need your statement about the incident. What exactly happened there?

1081
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:26,570
We had a...

1082
01:27:27,570 --> 01:27:29,570
an argument.

1083
01:27:30,570 --> 01:27:34,570
I meant to delete all the games from the computers but accidentally

1084
01:27:34,570 --> 01:27:37,570
I clicked on the...
 She's lying.

1085
01:27:37,570 --> 01:27:40,570
I deleted a bunch of things to piss her off.

1086
01:27:40,570 --> 01:27:44,570
Wait, so it wasn't you?
 No, no, it was actually me.

1087
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:47,570
She tried to stop me but she was too late.

1088
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:50,570
Aren't you the one that shredded the entire personnel records once?

1089
01:27:50,570 --> 01:27:53,570
Yes, but there's no connection between the incidents.

1090
01:27:53,570 --> 01:27:59,570
Really. Back then I was following my ideology and now...

1091
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:01,570
It was a mistake.

1092
01:28:01,570 --> 01:28:03,570
Do you know that what you did is unrecoverable?

1093
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:05,570
All our work went down the drain. Three months worth of work

1094
01:28:05,570 --> 01:28:08,570
that doesn't have any written backup because, thanks to you, there is no paper trail!

1095
01:28:08,570 --> 01:28:10,570
Zachi, calm down.

1096
01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:11,570
I will not calm down.

1097
01:28:17,570 --> 01:28:24,570
You shouldn't have done that. Now they're gonna' go after you.

1098
01:28:24,570 --> 01:28:27,570
I doubt it.

1099
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:30,570
It's not ok. I'll tell them I'm to blame.

1100
01:28:30,570 --> 01:28:34,570
Don't worry about it. You're an officer now.

1101
01:28:35,570 --> 01:28:38,570
You need to hold yourself to higher standards.

1102
01:28:46,570 --> 01:28:51,570
So, how was officer training?

1103
01:28:51,570 --> 01:28:54,570
A nightmare. How was prison?

1104
01:28:54,570 --> 01:28:57,570
Not bad. It was actually alright.

1105
01:28:58,570 --> 01:29:00,570
Anything is better than the kibbutz.

1106
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:02,570
Come in, please.

1107
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:07,570
Not every orchestra is the right fit for a trumpeteer.

1108
01:29:07,570 --> 01:29:10,570
There is a trumpeteer that's good for the philharmonic orchestra, another one is good for the local orchestra.

1109
01:29:10,570 --> 01:29:14,570
The challenge is to find the right fit.

1110
01:29:15,570 --> 01:29:21,570
Along this corner. You see? All across the corner.

1111
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:27,570
Well, what did you get?

1112
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:31,570
He said I'm not suitable for an operational position so he's demoting me to a position with less responsibility.

1113
01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:33,570
Really? Where?

1114
01:29:33,570 --> 01:29:36,570
In the City.

1115
01:29:37,570 --> 01:29:41,570
I'm moving to the City.

1116
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:52,570
It soon became clear that that the only thing Dafi didn't delete from the computers

1117
01:29:52,570 --> 01:29:55,570
...were the games we were playing.

1118
01:29:55,570 --> 01:29:59,570
I've decided to stop looking for guys. I quit playing "Mine Sweeper..."

1119
01:29:59,570 --> 01:30:03,570
...and now I've devoted my life to..."Solitaire".

1120
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:11,570
She's been like that all day.

1121
01:31:27,570 --> 01:31:31,570
They left me to rest in the infirmary and time flew by quickly.

1122
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:33,570
Discharged.

1123
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:37,570
No more mail Sergeants. Everything by email.

1124
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:45,570
"I sent you a letter over a week ago."

1125
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:51,570
"I asked to move to another office because this one smells like whitewash, the window is facing East and I'm allergic to the sun."

1126
01:31:51,570 --> 01:31:53,570
"So, is my request being considered?

1127
01:31:53,570 --> 01:31:55,570
That's good.  Add, "Thanks for considering it".

1128
01:31:55,570 --> 01:31:58,570
Shit!
