1
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,817
<i>In February 2002, an independent
unit interviewed Fidel Castro.</i>

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,540
<i>He was offered the power
to cut and erase at any time.</i>

3
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,216
<i>Over the course of 3 days and nights
Mr. Castro never chose to cut.</i>

4
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,934
<i>What follows is culled
from 30 hours of conversation.</i>

5
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,854
<i>First films of Cuban rebel leader
Fidel Castro.</i>

6
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,931
<i>Castro's plan of action</i>

7
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,774
<i>to fight by any means until
the Batista regime is toppled.</i>

8
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,500
<i>Behind Batista stand
the army, the police and,</i>

9
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,855
<i>apparently, Cuba's labor unions.</i>

10
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,695
<i>Batista seemed upset
about reports in the American press</i>

11
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,534
<i>of police brutality
and corruption but confident</i>

12
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,293
<i>in the face of
an unpredictable future.</i>

13
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,015
<i>This is the band
that for 16 months</i>

14
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,251
<i>has held out in the rugged
Sierra Maestre mountains</i>

15
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,093
<i>near the island's eastern tip.</i>

16
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,410
<i>Ill-supplied, they make
many of their weapons</i>

17
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,457
<i>in crude jungle workshops.</i>

18
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,292
<i>The ragged, underfed,
poorly-armed rebels</i>

19
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,690
<i>cut off communications
and supply lines</i>

20
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,330
<i>in a campaign of sniping
and sabotage. Castro himself</i>

21
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,537
<i>has become a figure of legend</i>

22
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,452
<i>since he invaded Oriente province</i>

23
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,054
<i>from a small boat.
It is</i>

24
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,780
<i>an unequal battle of idealists
against tough professional forces.</i>

25
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,179
<i>Says Castro, “If I lose,
PH start over again.</i>

26
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,377
<i>If Batista loses,
he loses for good.“</i>

27
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,938
JANUARY 1959, HAVANA, CUBA

28
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,090
<i>Tyranny</i>

29
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,978
<i>has been vanquished.</i>

30
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,291
<i>The joy is overwhelming.</i>

31
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,854
<i>Nevertheless,</i>

32
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,656
<i>there is still much to do.</i>

33
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,538
<i>Our political philosophy</i>

34
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,178
<i>is representative</i>

35
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,819
<i>democracy</i>

36
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,530
<i>and social justice
in a well-planned</i>

37
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,690
<i>ECONOMY.</i>

38
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,539
The Cuban revolution.

39
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,251
It was a small island,
a small revolution.

40
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,259
But it goes through time.

41
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,494
There is a discrepancy...

42
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,900
A small island,

43
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,376
a big revolution.

44
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,451
If today you had not succeeded,

45
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,219
would you be on a soapbox

46
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,418
now in the park,
talking about revolution?

47
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,892
No, I would be dead.

48
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,975
<i>When we have</i>

49
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,896
<i>fulfilled our promise
of a new government,</i>

50
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,937
<i>I will cut my beard.</i>

51
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,578
Let me take a closer look
at myself.

52
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,697
If I get close...

53
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,257
Let me see
where it looks best.

54
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,496
You guys

55
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,494
should do what your boss says.

56
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,695
And me too.

57
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,820
PALACE OF THE REVOLUTION,
HAVANA, CUBA

58
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,330
At any point, if he says "Cut"
or I say "Cut"

59
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,218
or we both say "Cut"...
either one,

60
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,769
you stop and we'll talk.

61
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,170
Maybe he wants to go again,
like an actor.

62
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,694
He gets a second take
and let's go again.

63
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,978
This is an acting exercise
that he will fail.

64
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,451
And after that we'll go into
a completely spontaneous mode.

65
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,494
Okay, action.

66
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,417
Commander, it's late
but you need to sign these.

67
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,570
What are you saying?

68
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,534
I can sign just a few.

69
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,177
With just a few we'll move ahead.

70
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,370
What's the longest
he's written recently?

71
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,338
The longest things I've written
recently are speeches for T.V.

72
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,778
You don't write poetry?

73
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,211
No, but when I write,
I like the words

74
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,216
to have a certain harmony.

75
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,098
I like combining words

76
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,016
so there's a cadence, a rhythm,

77
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,375
when I write them down.

78
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,939
I could produce so much more

79
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,176
by talking.

80
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,774
Who knows the thousands

81
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,449
of episodes, anecdotes, I've told.

82
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,214
How much of your day

83
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,572
is spent on administrative,
how much on

84
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,132
creative and how much of your day
is spent on physical maintenance?

85
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,499
The least possible on
administrative matters.

86
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,579
The most on speaking with comrades,

87
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,660
discussing different issues.

88
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,654
Is that creative?

89
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,977
Yes, because we find
solutions to problems.

90
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,893
One should...

91
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,573
gather information.

92
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,889
Get to know problems.

93
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,936
And try to find solutions.

94
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,532
- There are all kinds of problems.
-What about maintenance?

95
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,658
I don't waste
any time shaving.

96
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,891
I once calculated...

97
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,410
the meaning...

98
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,134
that I saved months
of my life that way...

99
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,460
Assuming it takes
15 minutes to shave.

100
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,137
When I was...

101
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,930
a young man...

102
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,216
I spent a lot of time on sports.

103
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,739
The pleasure of sport.

104
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,451
Nowadays, the maintenance I do

105
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,609
is to stay healthy.

106
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,538
This office is my track.

107
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,211
I measure the number of steps.

108
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,450
Can you show us a circle?

109
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,570
Right away.

110
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,651
First,

111
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,140
I look at my watch...

112
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,778
I check my pulse.

113
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,689
Then...

114
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,089
I start walking.

115
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,499
He counts his steps...
it's like a prisoner a bit.

116
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,729
I've no other choice.

117
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,049
I'm a prisoner.

118
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,818
When I come in here...
this is a cell.

119
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,651
When he gets bad news,
how does he take it?

120
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,491
Good news...

121
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,500
I receive calmly,

122
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,698
even though
it makes me happy.

123
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,575
That's for sure.

124
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,098
As for bad news,

125
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,259
I'm used to that.

126
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,614
Doesn't it hurt the same?

127
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,893
Some news is harder to take.

128
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,379
For example, one day...

129
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,580
I remember when I received
the news of my mother's death,

130
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,016
I felt very deep pain.

131
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,177
And when Che died.

132
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:25,012
<i>(1928-1967) Ernesto “Che“ Guevara, Commander
of the Cuban Revolution, killed in Bolivia.</i>

133
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,296
There are moments of grief...

134
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,576
not only about news
but also about events

135
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,819
you are involved in.

136
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,376
He must have been frustrated in
the Elian Gonzalez in Miami affair.

137
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,416
Well,

138
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,413
that was the first time
we claimed someone.

139
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,014
Illegal actions
have happened all the time.

140
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,499
We committed ourselves to a fight
to win a battle that was not

141
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,616
juridical...

142
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,296
but political.

143
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,210
I had a special feeling then.

144
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,330
When we first received
the father's request

145
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,099
to claim his son,

146
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,019
I saw that from
the legal point of view

147
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,698
we would never get support.

148
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,972
But first I needed to know
what the father was like.

149
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,209
Because to take on
a battle like that,

150
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,132
I needed justification.

151
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,018
Eight times

152
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,096
the couple tried to have a baby.

153
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,416
It was their eighth attempt.

154
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,816
They cried...
I felt so sorry for them.

155
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,254
And I realized...

156
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,057
the cause was just,
that every effort should be made.

157
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,414
And I was not wrong.

158
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,012
I know that you don't use
psychiatrists very much.

159
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,014
In all the grief he's had

160
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,535
in his life, has he ever felt

161
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,735
that he wanted to talk

162
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,935
to a psychiatrist?

163
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,450
That's never crossed my mind.

164
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,056
- Never crossed your mind?
-Never.

165
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,733
Perhaps it's something
to do with self-confidence.

166
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,490
Quite honestly, I've never

167
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,014
been asked that.

168
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,890
Oliver...

169
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,290
perhaps it's because
ever since I was a child

170
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,016
I had to solve

171
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,772
important problems by myself.

172
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,856
I was sent to Santiago
de Cuba when I was

173
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,896
5 or 6 years old.

174
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,698
That was my first hard experience.

175
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,978
I got used to solving
my own problems.

176
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,092
So he said he became strong
in his head and his heart

177
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,695
because his mother abandoned him?

178
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,411
No, she was my ally,

179
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,809
when I demanded to be sent
to boarding school.

180
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,896
My father

181
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,210
owned a lot of land.

182
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,133
That was their livelihood.
But I

183
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,891
demanded to be sent there.

184
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,890
In the strongest possible terms.

185
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,652
When I was in my second year
at university,

186
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,137
I joined an expedition

187
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,538
<i>to overthrow</i>

188
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,374
Trujillo in Santo Domingo.

189
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,810
Was he willing
to die at this age?

190
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,171
Yes.

191
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,493
Was he tortured?

192
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,218
They wanted to torture me.

193
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,176
But I was never tortured...

194
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,217
After he was arrested,

195
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,018
why didn't Batista shoot him?

196
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,739
He knew he was a leader.

197
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,176
He knew we didn't have
a penny, nor any resources.

198
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,010
They underestimated...
They underestimated us.

199
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,133
Do you believe in destiny or fate?

200
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,814
I do not believe in destiny.

201
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,095
To paraphrase

202
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,773
Napoleon,
"The moment my destiny

203
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,897
is over, I can be broken

204
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,414
by a puff of wind

205
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,569
or a match."
What does he think?

206
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,174
I do not think like that.

207
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,211
If I thought like that,

208
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,490
it would appear as if I had arrived
at the end of my destiny.

209
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,093
But we have never given up

210
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,295
our fight.

211
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,258
Not for one second.

212
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,979
And the day

213
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,454
I die, whatever the reason,

214
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,054
I would not think...

215
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,818
that it was destiny...

216
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,730
that ended my work.

217
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,130
I would think that
even after my death...

218
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,174
I believe today...

219
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,176
in the future of Cuba,

220
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,013
in the future of our cause.

221
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,977
And perhaps that is the test.

222
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,577
Why Hemingway?

223
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,779
He was a winner for Fidel?

224
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,370
Yes, I admire Hemingway very much.

225
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,850
But Hemingway
blew his brains out.

226
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,771
According to his philosophy.

227
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,817
If he were Salvador Allende and
they were closing in on his palace,

228
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,618
would he commit suicide?

229
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,575
I would fight

230
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,060
to the death.

231
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,217
And if the situation were such

232
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:56,698
that my gun stopped working
or I didn't have...

233
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,336
Yes, my decision would be to die.

234
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,936
There's no doubt in my mind.

235
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,416
At that moment
did he believe in God?

236
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,212
I have never been a believer.

237
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,619
Simply...

238
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,773
because the methods used
in school to persuade me

239
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,252
regarding religion
were dogmatic methods.

240
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,658
So this is one life
and it's over?

241
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,378
I am totally
convinced of that.

242
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:40,210
Which version of your life would you
like to see for the closing chapter?

243
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,296
Version one...

244
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,612
You're a grandfather,

245
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,379
many children...

246
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,737
the benevolent patriarch,

247
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,652
loved by the people,

248
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,614
you die in bed...

249
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,093
it's a great life.

250
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,650
Or...

251
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,979
the new world order happens,

252
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,936
they throw Fidel in chains.

253
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,810
With billions of people watching,
you give the most eloquent defense

254
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,696
of human rights and dignity...

255
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,129
ever heard.

256
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,213
What would you do?
Version one or version two?

257
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,534
Neither.

258
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,372
I always try to be as rational
as possible in my thinking.

259
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,218
I have an idea
of how relative glory can be.

260
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,379
Look... Jose Marti
expressed it in a phrase.

261
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,129
"All the glory in the world

262
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,333
fits in a grain of corn."

263
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,577
I have never thought about glory...

264
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,738
never given a thought to how
I want to be remembered.

265
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,454
History is relative.

266
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,050
Mankind could become extinct...

267
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,730
the sun could die out...

268
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,259
So what is...

269
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:21,936
fame

270
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,499
and celebrity worth?

271
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,330
One day, none of that will exist.

272
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,738
Is the 21st century going to be

273
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,299
about the new world order or not?

274
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,373
If it is not attained
relatively soon,

275
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,534
then...

276
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,218
our species will vanish.

277
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,853
We cannot go on
destroying the environment

278
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,256
and keep on wasting

279
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,774
Ol-ll" natural resources

280
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,252
and destroying
man's living conditions.

281
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,699
There's no need
even for mathematics there.

282
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,893
Simple arithmetics

283
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,016
would show

284
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,819
that either present problems

285
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,209
must be solved

286
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,499
or mankind will not
be able to survive

287
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,251
the new century we are beginning.

288
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,893
I am inclined to believe

289
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,937
that rationality will prevail

290
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,170
and mankind will survive.

291
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,577
But in a short period of time...

292
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,937
within 40 or 50 years,
there will be

293
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,569
almost 10 billion people on earth...

294
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,414
It would not be

295
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,333
worthwhile living on the planet

296
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,934
we are being left with.

297
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,617
Fidel doesn't believe that the war

298
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,930
on drugs will ever
be licked, does he?

299
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,539
I think society is defenseless
against drugs.

300
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,740
We have managed
to protect ourselves...

301
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,497
from drugs entering.

302
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,817
We have reduced
drug abuse to a minimum.

303
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,453
Cuba has one of the lowest rates
of drug abuse...

304
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,971
I think that natural drugs
will soon be replaced

305
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,574
by artificial ones,

306
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,569
much cheaper to manufacture,
like ecstasy.

307
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,890
Is revolution possible
against the new world order?

308
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,855
A change.

309
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,693
Let's call it a "change."

310
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,411
The present order, to my mind,

311
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,729
is unsustainable.

312
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,578
Would he like to see
McDonald's here in Havana?

313
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,815
<i>Number one...</i>

314
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,416
<i>The Cuban Electric Company.</i>

315
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,099
<i>Number twenty-four...</i>

316
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,093
<i>The United Fruit Company.</i>

317
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,092
I have been critical...

318
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,055
But it would be more
justified than in India.

319
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,532
It is an example...

320
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,810
of the tendency towards
a homogeneous culture

321
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,777
and the destruction
of cultural identity.

322
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,935
One culture emanating from
the one nation that has power

323
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,816
and the monopoly of the media.

324
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,020
<i>It was perfectly well-planned.</i>

325
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,416
<i>And it': a perfectly
well-known story.</i>

326
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,532
<i>For many years now</i>

327
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,577
<i>the imperialists,
when they realized</i>

328
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,376
<i>that one day</i>

329
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,259
<i>the colonies would be liberated,
started organizing</i>

330
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,854
<i>their movements.</i>

331
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,058
<i>Cabinda province is rich</i>

332
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,369
<i>with oil.</i>

333
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,252
<i>That is one of the reasons
why the imperialists want</i>

334
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,377
<i>to take over Angola.</i>

335
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,334
<i>So they organized the F.L.N.A.,</i>

336
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,216
<i>using people from the CIA.</i>

337
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,093
<i>Some imperialists ask</i>

338
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,890
<i>why the Cubans help the Angolans...</i>

339
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,529
<i>what our interests there are.</i>

340
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,410
<i>They think that
when a country acts</i>

341
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,336
<i>it is only for oil, copper,
diamonds or other natural resources.</i>

342
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,896
<i>No.</i>

343
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,299
<i>Our interests are not</i>

344
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,815
<i>materialistic.
And the imperialists</i>

345
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,494
<i>obviously can't understand that.</i>

346
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,294
<i>Their criteria is based solely
on chauvinistic, nationalistic,</i>

347
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,656
<i>selfish reasons.
We are carrying out</i>

348
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,098
<i>an internationalist duty
in helping the people of Angola.</i>

349
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,138
That is a nice one.

350
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,733
We have about 120 paintings.

351
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,700
We did not go to the museum...
This one,

352
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,010
look what this man did.

353
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,209
Portocarrero.

354
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,170
That's the city, isn't it?
He paints that a lot.

355
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,853
The swamp...

356
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,453
this is the mainland.

357
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,889
The swamp.

358
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,292
So what do you watch here?

359
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,413
Very little lately.

360
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,777
I have not been to the movies
in the last 10 years.

361
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,210
I have been too busy.

362
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,652
Not even a holiday...

363
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,693
Since the collapse

364
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,489
of the socialist model...

365
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,973
when we were left

366
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:07,338
in a sort of special period
of hardship and double blockade...

367
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,815
I have not taken a single holiday.

368
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,653
Did he see "Gladiator"?

369
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,776
I think I saw it, on video.

370
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,260
Did he see "Titanic"?

371
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,815
"Titanic," yes, I've seen it.

372
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,538
On video too.

373
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,050
It's a movie to see
on a big screen.

374
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,812
Yes, it was an interesting movie,
as a show.

375
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,489
When you were a young man... What
actresses were you in love with?

376
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,699
Almost all of them,
but now I cannot remember...

377
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,251
- I cannot remember the names.
-Rita Hayworth?

378
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,853
Sophia... the Italian girl.

379
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,489
Yes, Sophia Loren.

380
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,778
She was one of the many

381
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,850
I liked.

382
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,018
Brigitte Bardot

383
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,340
can count me
as one of her admirers.

384
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,417
What men did he like?

385
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,699
Charlie Chaplin.

386
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,175
I can watch all his movies.
I could see them all again.

387
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,693
Movies with Cantinflas,

388
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,453
they still seem new to me.

389
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,974
Depardieu...

390
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,093
I've seen some of his movies.

391
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,373
When he played Louis XIV's chef,

392
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,818
he had to put on
a lot of weight.

393
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,249
But he put on so much
that he stayed fat.

394
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,899
He's the funniest man...

395
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,337
I've met him several times.

396
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,818
There's one scene in life
which is very powerful.

397
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,371
When...

398
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:43,376
I think it was right around the 59,
one half million people were

399
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,736
in a square, shouting

400
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,899
"Fidel.

401
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,819
Fidel, Fidel."

402
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,254
And I realized that you...

403
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:58,732
that you were speaking for the
Revolution and it's not personal but

404
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,378
it must have been
a great moment in your life.

405
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,130
You experience

406
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,415
satisfaction when you see

407
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,934
the support of the people,

408
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,696
but...

409
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,170
it seems that
in the last few years,

410
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,217
since the child was kidnapped,

411
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,214
we had here...

412
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,900
mass rallies,

413
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:25,492
larger than... in the first years
of the Revolution.

414
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,449
Here is a strong man,
he doesn't go to a psychiatrist...

415
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,411
This is the final justification.

416
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,414
Now I'll look bad,
I'll look like a liar.

417
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,099
And I've told the truth.

418
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,173
Because the theory of
the strong man and the weak man

419
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,293
has not... been raised.

420
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,418
I do not read everything they
write about me in the U.S.

421
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,456
One knows what one should read.

422
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,773
Tomorrow we can talk about weak men,
and his weaknesses and his regrets.

423
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,019
My answer to that question
may be rather subjective.

424
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,693
I'm usually very self-critical.

425
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,136
Not so much regarding
the things I have done,

426
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,019
or the mistakes I have made...

427
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,090
but of the things that could
have been done better.

428
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,775
I'd even say we are

429
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,174
sometimes ashamed
of things we have done,

430
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,497
even though I feel we have done
10 times better than any other

431
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,253
Latin American country.

432
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,011
We found a country that

433
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,092
had a 30% illiteracy rate,

434
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,331
60% functional illiterates.

435
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,130
And it is probably an exaggeration

436
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,416
to say that

437
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,773
10% of the people

438
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,095
were well-educated.

439
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,493
At the time of the victory

440
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,934
of the Revolution,

441
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,497
there must have been...

442
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,931
between 30,000 and 40,000

443
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,977
university graduates.

444
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,973
Today there are

445
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,539
over 700,000 graduates.

446
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,214
One of the Revolution's
greatest advances

447
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,536
is that even prostitutes
are graduates.

448
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,060
You know how many
prostitutes there were

449
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,415
before the Revolution?

450
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,975
-100,000.
-And now?

451
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,175
Very few.

452
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,449
However, one is aware that

453
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,173
we could have done better.

454
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,378
Above all when you see all

455
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,769
the possibilities.

456
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,615
He says it would be better
if you come on this side.

457
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,929
Over here.

458
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,049
I'll do it, I'll do it.
No, no... Fidel, I'll do it.

459
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,454
Here we have cigars.

460
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,931
- I don't know what's in there.
-I do not smoke any more.

461
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,256
Could be candies.

462
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,249
- I can tell it's an old box.
-I haven't smoked for 17 years.

463
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,215
Candies!

464
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,135
Very good.

465
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,854
I think I see a pistol.

466
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,691
Yes, that's all.
There is a book over there.

467
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,453
I moved my gun from there...

468
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,931
or there'd have been
no room for you.

469
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,694
Oh, yes.

470
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,813
You know how to use it, Fidel?

471
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,776
Perhaps I still remember.

472
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,690
Let me see what
you have over there.

473
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,178
What someone gave me.

474
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,697
"The Round Table."

475
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,580
"The Round Table."
And that is a book.

476
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,929
It's an old book.
He doesn't read up to date.

477
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,972
Just as well I don't bring
secret papers with me.

478
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,140
They would have been exposed.

479
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,018
Do people know that he's
in this car? Is he spottable?

480
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,454
Yes, everybody knows.

481
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,777
Does he like
to drive around at night?

482
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,656
More in the past.

483
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,135
Because I was less

484
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,290
of a slave

485
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,295
to my office.

486
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,698
I traveled around a lot.

487
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:39,571
Was he shocked or not when he found
out that Kennedy had an open car...

488
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:43,859
no... the security? The windows
were open on all the parade route.

489
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,250
The car was driving very slow.
Was he surprised by that?

490
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,851
I always had my doubts

491
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,931
because when you shoot

492
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,770
with a telescopic sight

493
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,409
it's hard to hit the target

494
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,696
from such a distance.

495
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,693
When you fire the gun moves

496
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,576
and you have to re-aim.

497
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,295
You couldn't fire
several times in a row.

498
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,053
I have never believed

499
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,780
the theory about the lone gunman.

500
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,571
One well-aimed shot

501
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,292
is all he could have managed.

502
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,577
A conspiracy seems very likely.

503
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,574
Then there's that strange thing
about the presumed assassin dying

504
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,334
of sadness and honor...

505
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,812
It's hard to explain it all.

506
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:50,816
Are we going into the crowd? No
questions... We just walk and talk?

507
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,337
The idea is to visit
the school in a few minutes.

508
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,219
Shall I leave my bag here?

509
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,091
- If...
-It's safe?

510
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,533
If there are no secret papers,

511
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,929
you can leave it.

512
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,255
- Where are you from?
-Nicaragua.

513
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,330
- Venezuela.
-Guatemala.

514
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,490
Bolivia.

515
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,733
Is tuition very low?

516
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,497
It's all free.

517
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,418
Both for Americans and for
all the international students.

518
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,649
American Dominican.
Thank you for coming.

519
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,491
American Dominican.

520
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,650
Oliver.

521
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,131
American Dominican.

522
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,450
- Where are you from?
-I'm from New York City, Manhattan.

523
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,692
- Trini Martinez from Oregon.
-Oregon. How's it going?

524
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,130
And you?

525
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,332
El Salvador.

526
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,894
She's from Argentina.

527
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,537
You'll become a doctor,
go back to New York?

528
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,258
Yes.

529
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,732
Do you have planned parenthood
and abortion here?

530
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,774
Yes, abortion is legal.

531
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,818
When it was illegal

532
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:48,132
in the years before the Revolution,

533
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:55,698
illegal abortion was very common.

534
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:02,336
With terrible consequences
for the health. Many women died.

535
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,898
Now it is the woman's choice.

536
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,698
So you don't have women who are
having 7 or 8 children anymore?

537
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,854
That's not very common now
as women are more educated.

538
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,372
They play a part in society.

539
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,810
I think we've
spoiled their classes.

540
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,094
You know, it's the uniform.

541
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,140
If you came down with a pair of
Bermuda shorts, American flip-flops

542
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,338
and an ugly T-shirt...
nobody would notice him.

543
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,578
It's just a joke.
He doesn't smile.

544
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,579
We will show...

545
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,534
the security people
how to do their job.

546
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,730
So that when Bush comes...

547
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,693
If he travels here, you're
in trouble. I can tell you that.

548
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,009
No problems.
We'd take care of him.

549
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,814
No, he'll take care of you.
You'll be in the prison.

550
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,937
He'll be back in prison.

551
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,651
You can be sure of that.

552
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,095
Is Gorbachev
a hero of his or not?

553
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,295
He was...

554
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,530
He had...

555
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,134
good intentions.

556
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,930
That country needed improvements,

557
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,534
not destruction.

558
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,929
Which Russian leader

559
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,613
cut off the aid to Cuba?

560
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,855
The Soviet leader

561
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,172
who cut off aid to Cuba was...

562
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,013
the U.S. government.

563
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,855
Understand?

564
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,453
I'll explain.

565
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,457
When the USSR collapsed

566
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,859
aid was interrupted.
Gorbachev was there.

567
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,135
But he was less powerful.

568
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,010
We had some agreements
from before him

569
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:55,136
which expired when he was leader.

570
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,972
He was drinking with...

571
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,258
Khrushchev, he was drinking
with Brezhnev, he was drinking

572
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,855
with Yeltsin...

573
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,497
All three are major drinkers.

574
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,293
Did he drink with them?

575
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,059
No, it was difficult
to compete with Yeltsin.

576
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,897
Which of these men
amused him most?

577
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,739
I got on with Khrushchev best.

578
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,610
Khrushchev was
the shrewd peasant type.

579
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,416
He was the one who...

580
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,931
initiated cooperation
with Cuba and felt sympathy

581
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,090
for Cuba.

582
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,930
<i>Revolution is</i>

583
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,659
<i>for any country the most violent</i>

584
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,651
<i>means of change,</i>

585
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,610
<i>bringing as it does
death, destruction and hatred.</i>

586
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,816
<i>The Cuban Revolution
ruled out one dictator,</i>

587
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,654
<i>but it produced another...
Fidel Castro.</i>

588
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,212
<i>Little did
the Cuban people suspect</i>

589
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,654
<i>that Castro would betray</i>

590
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,731
<i>their cause and deliver them
into the hands</i>

591
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,652
<i>of the most ruthless
of all tyrannies...</i>

592
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,330
<i>into the iron grip of communism.</i>

593
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,692
When you were in
the guerrilla army up in the jungle,

594
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,850
did anybody get fed up,

595
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,978
anybody was like pissed off
and wanted to quit?

596
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,050
Of course.

597
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,611
Did people say, "This Castro
doesn't know what he's doing."?

598
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,851
But nobody ever complained about

599
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,249
the Castros directly.

600
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,094
Some complained about...

601
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,778
the hardships of the struggle,

602
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,250
the great effort...

603
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,013
what we would have at the end.

604
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,089
Who inspired them?

605
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,853
We were inspired by

606
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,297
Cuban pro-independents,
who were brave fighters.

607
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,734
Maximo Gomez, Marti,

608
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,176
Maceo, who organized an invasion...

609
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,255
30 years with machetes and horses...

610
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,170
They were
our inspiration throughout.

611
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:30,015
The tactics we used were
the result of observation

612
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,893
and meditation

613
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,739
and of inspiration.

614
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,499
Tell me about Nixon.

615
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:48,218
The first time I met him
was in March 1959.

616
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,650
He was Vice President.

617
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,740
We talked...

618
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,615
I explained our situation to him,
shared my ideas with him...

619
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,579
And he immediately
drafted a report.

620
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,729
He wrote...

621
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,289
that I was...

622
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,371
a communist.

623
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,376
At that time,
to talk about land reform

624
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,049
identified you as a communist.

625
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,574
From the very beginning

626
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,374
he gave me the impression
of being a hypocrite...

627
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,449
a small-minded politician...

628
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,090
vain.

629
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,455
Furthermore, it was he

630
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:40,136
who recommended that
an expedition be organized

631
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,290
to destroy us.

632
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,338
At what point did he actually

633
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,936
in his own thinking commit to the
Soviet Union as an ally

634
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:52,737
and antagonize

635
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,696
the United States?

636
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,373
One: when

637
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,417
we were deprived
of the sugar quota

638
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,218
and were left
without a sugar market,

639
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,457
and when the oil supply
was cut off.

640
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,651
That was a political
economic moment.

641
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,534
There was a sense of gratitude...

642
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:17,060
It was not yet
a political commitment...

643
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,414
nor military.

644
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,734
But the fact is

645
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,130
that the expedition was already

646
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,734
being organized

647
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,776
in Guatemala

648
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,419
for the invasion.

649
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,178
And so we started requesting

650
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,777
the purchase of weapons
from the Soviet Union.

651
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:43,094
Kennedy inherited

652
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:48,969
the Eisenhower administration's
plans to invade Cuba.

653
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,215
Plans in an advanced stage.

654
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,020
Hardly 2 months passed before

655
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,733
everything was under way.

656
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,171
Kennedy did not have

657
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,616
much experience.

658
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,376
He trusted the U.S. institutions
too much.

659
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,655
<i>These charges</i>

660
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,811
<i>are totally false</i>

661
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,577
<i>and I deny them categorically.</i>

662
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,694
<i>The United States has committed
no aggression against Cuba,</i>

663
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:21,739
<i>and no offensive
has been launched from Florida</i>

664
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,970
<i>or from any</i>

665
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,131
<i>other part of the United States.</i>

666
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,289
Actually...

667
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,250
the reason for the missiles here

668
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,412
was that the Soviets
had information

669
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,018
that there was a plan

670
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,134
to invade Cuba.

671
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,133
Khrushchev had made
a deep commitment to Cuba.

672
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:10,371
Even at the time
of the invasion he made

673
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,213
very strong statements.

674
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:19,411
He spoke about
strategic missiles, implying

675
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,730
that Cuba would be supported.

676
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,131
And there was a moral factor
that had to be considered.

677
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,177
We did not like the idea...

678
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:33,015
We would have taken
whatever risks were necessary

679
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,576
rather than

680
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:41,534
appear as a Soviet military base
in the Western hemisphere.

681
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,652
So, from the military
point of view,

682
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,572
things were very bad.

683
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,778
They'd allowed the Americans
to use their surveillance planes

684
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,329
to survey the whole area
and locate the missiles.

685
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,619
They put our country
in great danger. We...

686
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,215
thought we would be obliterated.

687
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,014
We would be the first to disappear.

688
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,615
Your critics in America

689
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:13,738
and the historians
continue to say that

690
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,777
in the October 26th letter
to Khrushchev

691
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,337
you called for nuclear war.

692
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,849
Socialism or death.

693
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,859
It's been interpreted that way.

694
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,730
I did not ask them to attack.

695
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,653
I said,
"If this country is attacked...

696
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:36,378
If this country is attacked

697
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:42,576
with 40,000 Soviet troops..."
There was an agreement...

698
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,657
My conviction was that

699
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,572
after the invasion,

700
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,931
the Americans would not
take long to launch an attack.

701
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,579
We did not have
a Russian translator.

702
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:05,291
There was an ambassador

703
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,856
who spoke Spanish

704
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,059
very poorly. So,

705
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,291
that note, I...

706
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,654
I doubt

707
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,618
that he received a clear message.

708
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,772
I can only imagine

709
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:28,249
what the ambassador translated.

710
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:32,089
After,

711
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,694
Khrushchev sent me a letter

712
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,369
defending himself
from my accusations.

713
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,451
He said he had obtained a guarantee
from the U.S. not to invade Cuba.

714
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,579
A verbal guarantee.

715
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,852
And he said we had suggested

716
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,293
a first strike.

717
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,850
<i>We will not prematurely
or unnecessarily</i>

718
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:04,179
<i>risk the course
of worldwide nuclear war</i>

719
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,738
<i>in which even the fruits
of victory would be</i>

720
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,174
<i>ashes in our mouth.</i>

721
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,294
<i>But neither will we shrink
from that risk</i>

722
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,178
<i>at any time it must be faced.</i>

723
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,651
Kennedy committed himself.

724
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,576
He believed it because...

725
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,935
It was a game of words.

726
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:41,130
Khrushchev resorted to

727
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,940
the naive and superficial notion...

728
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,049
of the intentions behind

729
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,449
those weapons...

730
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,531
He said he had no intention
of using them, for him...

731
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,297
That was the argument he used.

732
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,375
Mr. Castro could not
have pushed the trigger?

733
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:13,456
No, if we had done nothing...
we were afraid that they would

734
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,655
be destroyed.

735
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:21,574
And we would be left
with all the radioactivity.

736
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,939
What should Khrushchev
have asked for Cuba?

737
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,815
The return of Guantanamo base.

738
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,411
An end to the blockade.

739
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,133
An end to the terrorist attacks...

740
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,769
Five points.

741
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:01,574
I think the sticking point for
Kennedy was that if Cuba existed as

742
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:04,573
a Socialist model in the hemisphere
it would have been dangerous.

743
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,610
The Russians understood that.

744
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,173
So they put
their own interests first.

745
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:19,173
Yes, and I wrote about that.

746
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:22,295
They could not
have won the point

747
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:25,054
because America
would always hate Cuba...

748
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,331
Great tension
was created worldwide.

749
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:32,649
No one in the world was willing
to have a nuclear war

750
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:36,456
over a military base there.

751
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,250
Or an economic blockade of Cuba.

752
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,450
No one would have gone
to war for that.

753
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,529
And we were new...

754
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,893
We could not pretend
to have more experience.

755
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,379
We didn't understand

756
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,497
the balance of power,

757
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:03,459
what military might they had...

758
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,133
At the time of the invasion,

759
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,813
the Revolution was 2 years old.

760
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:14,653
At the time of
the missile crisis, 3 years.

761
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:21,134
I think that we did
what we had to do.

762
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,651
And we did it relatively well.

763
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:28,654
But I do not think
we could have known

764
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:35,372
how erratic
our friends and allies

765
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,099
could be.
They did not understand

766
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:38,409
the Third World.

767
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,816
Nor the theater of operations.

768
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:48,099
They only thought about tank
brigades, artillery,

769
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,615
motorized infantry,

770
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,453
conventional troops.

771
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:55,213
And irregular warfare
cannot be fought

772
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,093
with conventional troops.

773
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,739
They are only for parades.

774
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,049
But we engaged

775
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:03,974
in irregular warfare

776
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,370
and we defeated our enemies.

777
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,731
If Mr. Castro knew

778
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,016
that the CIA
had been behind the coup

779
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,979
of 54, then he had
more reason not to trust

780
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:33,016
the United States.

781
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:37,299
Especially knowing how the United
States had acted historically.

782
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:41,489
But many...
It was not the only intervention.

783
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:43,654
There was Santo Domingo...

784
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,130
And in Central America

785
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,813
on several occasions.

786
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:50,256
The CIA already existed,
of course.

787
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:53,892
And he knew all this?

788
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:57,256
Yes, everyone knew about it.

789
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,377
Except Americans.

790
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,816
Because they told
the Americans one thing...

791
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:07,009
That it was
a Communist government,

792
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:10,691
and a danger to
the national security of the U.S.

793
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,777
And that is a sacred expression.

794
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,410
Whenever it is invoked,
there is a reaction.

795
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:21,378
A conditioned reflex.

796
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:25,451
"Such and such a thing
is a threat to national security."

797
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,770
<i>Affecting homeland security.</i>

798
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,339
<i>National security...</i>

799
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,695
That word is sacred.

800
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:42,616
In Vietnam there were always
stories about Cuban advisers.

801
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:48,500
No, it was Cubans
who were studying the Vietnamese.

802
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,538
To get experience.

803
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,735
How many Cubans were there?

804
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,171
Never more than 20, I think.

805
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,379
I can't be completely sure.

806
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,295
But I know it was
a very small group.

807
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,579
Later it was said

808
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,854
<i>that there were
security advisers there.</i>

809
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:10,333
And that they had taken part

810
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,850
in the torturing of prisoners.

811
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,170
And I tell you that
that is

812
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:16,330
absolutely untrue.

813
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,452
I read the POW accounts

814
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,770
in Hanoi.
We're talking about...

815
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:25,252
I would assume two dozen men
who claim there was a Cuban

816
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:30,092
who at first...
at first watched...

817
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,494
but then participated

818
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,695
in the beatings.
It was very brutal.

819
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,979
If that were true,

820
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:44,292
I assure you we would
have had them tried in a court.

821
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,410
Believe us or not,

822
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:53,299
I assure you that
in 43 years of Revolution

823
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,338
never have we tortured anyone.

824
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,530
It's a principle
of ours since the way.

825
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,294
That was what Batista used to do,

826
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,694
and we would never
resort to those methods.

827
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,453
The Vietnamese did not want

828
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:09,530
any foreigners

829
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,815
among their troops.

830
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,218
They never asked
the Chinese for help.

831
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,050
They never asked the Russians.

832
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,169
Oh, yes, they were very zealous...

833
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,571
Deeply nationalistic.

834
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,900
And the Vietnamese
were not criminals.

835
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:34,016
The Vietnamese did not
execute their prisoners.

836
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,135
There was quite
a bit of brutality.

837
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:37,577
Well...

838
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,413
He must know more than me.

839
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:43,379
You know that we
were invaded by 1,500 men.

840
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,213
We took 1,200 prisoners.

841
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:50,338
In fighting which lasted 68 hours

842
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,171
there were hundreds of wounded.

843
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,489
Over 100 casualties.

844
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:58,930
We were attacked

845
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,329
by surprise,

846
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:03,734
by planes with Cuban insignias.

847
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:10,415
That was the source
of our... indignation.

848
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,170
And rage.
A great deal of rage.

849
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:18,816
You tell me if any
of those 1,200 prisoners...

850
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,573
I myself went...

851
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,330
I arrived there...

852
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:25,576
Ask Almeida,

853
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:26,889
ask anybody.

854
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,013
Go into the streets...

855
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:33,180
and ask if they have ever
heard about torture.

856
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:38,374
It does not fit in
with the way we think.

857
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,533
I would not have the morality
to criticize anybody.

858
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,771
What about the Huberto Matos case?

859
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:46,011
Well...

860
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:48,296
what he did was very risky.

861
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,212
He was a real coward.

862
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,699
He was in the war
for the last 8 months.

863
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,571
Minimal war merits...

864
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,738
He wanted to get
the regiment to rebel.

865
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,457
The trial

866
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:13,530
was here.

867
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,575
I went to it,

868
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:17,538
with all the documents.

869
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:22,058
And he was sentenced to 25 years.

870
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:24,736
It was an act of treachery.

871
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,779
A dangerous act.

872
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,129
Do you think
we should walk around?

873
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:23,695
The light's going.

874
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:27,899
They should tell us to go
somewhere open and not too crazy.

875
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:35,972
Wherever we go,
it will be like that.

876
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:42,539
- It has to be a surprise.
-...the Hemingway bar?

877
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,938
I'll take you,
I'll be your guide.

878
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:51,096
Now he will be the guide.

879
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,133
He will be your tourist guide.

880
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:50,572
<i>And we say to Mr. Reagan...</i>

881
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:57,576
<i>that we are not afraid
of his threats.</i>

882
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,330
What is a dictator?

883
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:02,096
Does anyone really know?

884
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:05,618
Is it bad to be a dictator?

885
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:09,297
Because I've seen the U.S.
governments, for example,

886
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:13,616
being very friendly with
the greatest dictators.

887
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:17,418
Marx speaks of the dictatorship
of the proletariate.

888
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:21,939
Not of personal dictatorship.

889
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:31,335
I have always tried
to solve basic problems

890
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:34,693
through persuasion

891
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:37,339
and moral authority.

892
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,969
You will not find a picture

893
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:41,130
over the last 43 years

894
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:44,098
of police
oppressing the people.

895
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:53,452
People all over the world call him
the "movie star dictator."

896
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:55,099
What don't they like?

897
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:58,051
Do they say I'm a bad actor?

898
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:02,009
The new Evita Perén, in a way?

899
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,939
Nobody denies
the real achievements.

900
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,371
I have heard

901
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:10,417
some strange things about me.

902
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,540
But...

903
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:17,653
I don't see any similarity.
I do believe that Evita Perén

904
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:21,651
genuinely felt for
the cause of her people.

905
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:24,614
And that the people
responded to her.

906
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:28,170
And she had almost more support

907
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:30,489
than Perén.

908
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,979
It doesn't offend me

909
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:36,370
if you make comparisons with her.

910
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:46,896
I did not borrow
my ideas from anyone.

911
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:50,337
I have always done
my job, my duty...

912
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:54,735
I admit I am a dictator...
a dictator to myself.

913
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:59,019
I am a dictator to myself,
a slave

914
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:00,250
of the people.

915
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,660
That's what I am.

916
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:09,890
<i>Carlos shot a documentary
in the barrios here,</i>

917
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:11,812
in Cuba, Havana.

918
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:17,131
He says that in every block...
the blocks that he was shooting,

919
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:19,258
there was always
one informant type,

920
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:20,854
who reports...

921
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:26,138
So people have to be cool
and they have to conform.

922
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,379
It was his imagination.

923
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:33,655
What we did today...

924
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,132
What we did today,

925
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:37,411
we could do

926
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:39,378
in any neighborhood.

927
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:43,532
On any street in Havana.
We can go by ourselves.

928
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:48,098
And today you saw me
order the head of the bodyguards

929
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,136
to get out of the car.

930
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,779
But he's not there.
The small-time people

931
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:58,056
drive everyone nuts, right?

932
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:01,292
At school there's always a squealer
who makes trouble for the people.

933
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:05,172
All states have a bureaucracy.

934
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,898
And people who do different things.

935
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:10,937
Maybe he's got to
simplify the system

936
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,932
so that these guys
don't get rewarded.

937
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:21,170
I don't like giving...

938
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:24,057
These are different things...

939
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:27,299
It's not giving orders,
it's persuading people.

940
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:29,895
I have been accused
of talking too much,

941
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:33,295
but I like to persuade people.

942
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:36,259
I don't use complicated terms.

943
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,570
I converse with people.

944
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:58,133
It's hard for me to keep still.

945
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:06,578
What started the universe?
Was there an organizing principle?

946
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:15,651
I think that most things
are yet to be known.

947
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:19,091
We're only beginning to understand
the organism, cells,

948
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:21,295
genes.

949
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:24,175
The Pope said recently

950
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:27,169
that the theory of evolution

951
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:28,416
is not...

952
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,737
incompatible

953
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:35,418
with the doctrine of creation.

954
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:37,658
The Pope also says...

955
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,738
he doesn't talk about hell,

956
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:43,292
he talks about fear of God.

957
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:45,218
Is he an atheist?

958
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:47,850
I do not believe.

959
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:51,850
I do not believe in all
that man has created.

960
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:54,973
You're an atheist but
you receive the Pope graciously.

961
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:57,695
Do you believe

962
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,737
that religion is an opiate

963
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:01,895
for the people?

964
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,812
It all depends.

965
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:08,179
If religion is used
to create values,

966
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:10,456
to do good, to comfort people,

967
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:14,138
then it is not opium.

968
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:16,858
But if religious beliefs

969
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:20,900
are used to defend a bad cause,

970
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:24,291
then it becomes opium.

971
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:28,971
Religion gives consolation
to many people,

972
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:32,020
human beings have
a tendency to believe.

973
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,059
What is the meaning of your life?

974
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,578
I feel satisfied with it,

975
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:41,533
of having done what I have done.

976
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:45,734
It gives me pleasure

977
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:48,289
when we advance in new ideas.

978
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:52,411
I feel absolute tranquility

979
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:57,299
with the work done
by the Revolution.

980
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:00,336
I would not
change it for anything.

981
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:07,450
Does he feel that life's meaning,

982
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,258
the meaning of life
for human beings,

983
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:12,173
is to bring one closer

984
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:14,900
to understanding oneself?

985
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:19,209
Life is a matter
of acquiring values,

986
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:22,613
of acquiring knowledge.

987
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:26,498
Of doing something
worthwhile with your life.

988
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,575
To practice self-control?

989
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:31,611
Yes.

990
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:35,296
Everything we do

991
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:38,339
is to give real possibilities
to the people,

992
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:41,176
to help them to develop

993
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:43,251
their full potential.

994
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:47,499
In the field of education,
of health...

995
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,179
the cultivation of values.

996
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:51,536
Che!

997
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:01,338
One of the most
admirable things about Fidel

998
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:05,496
is that of being
a historical figure, a paradigm

999
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:09,134
who is constantly referring
to past experiences.

1000
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:11,458
But he is still of the present.

1001
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:14,933
And he tells us how
the future is going to be.

1002
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:22,012
People don't live forever.

1003
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:24,217
Man's genetic potential

1004
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:25,734
is 120 years.

1005
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:28,854
Turtles, 300 years.

1006
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,857
Could we modify genes
and live longer?

1007
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:34,414
It would be better.

1008
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:37,299
Research...

1009
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:40,329
could lead to the fountain
of youth but I think

1010
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:43,410
that if men
could live for 500 years,

1011
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,536
they would get terribly bored.

1012
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,213
So he would live forever?

1013
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:57,338
No. Because the mind
is used to the idea

1014
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:01,093
that there is
a limited amount of time.

1015
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:03,738
Tell him Viagra will help.

1016
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,414
Help me to think?

1017
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:16,092
As doctors say, it boosts
the circulation of the blood.

1018
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:20,054
- I could be a CIA agent.
-That's right.

1019
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:25,898
Then they would say, "Oliver
went to Havana to deliver Viagra."

1020
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:33,090
They might think that it would
help to kill this enemy with

1021
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:34,250
a heart attack.

1022
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,811
He'd get the decorations
he didn't get in Vietnam.

1023
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:44,697
Were you decorated in Vietnam?

1024
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:46,814
Were you wounded in combat?

1025
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:49,017
Yes, he was decorated.

1026
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:50,690
You were wounded twice?

1027
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:56,416
That is the courage you now need

1028
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,254
to do what you are doing.

1029
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:16,050
Who's going to come after you?

1030
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:23,136
That... all depends

1031
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:25,977
on whether it is
in 20 years' time...

1032
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:30,131
or 10 years' time...

1033
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:33,337
or 6 months' time...

1034
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:38,934
As I have always been in danger
of being assassinated,

1035
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:45,493
since the Revolution,
I believe I have the authority

1036
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:52,139
to go on with the Revolution.
It will not be easy.

1037
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:54,219
I have more confidence

1038
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,575
in the ideas,

1039
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:59,178
in the political culture
of our people,

1040
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,298
than in men.

1041
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:04,815
You love her, don't you?

1042
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:07,176
I mean she's your wife,
almost an alter-ego.

1043
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:14,374
- Who is he talking about?
-"Her." That's me.

1044
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:15,891
Yes.

1045
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:19,213
She's been
my translator for years.

1046
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:22,850
I know. your minds...
You must be husband and wife.

1047
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:26,773
How long have you been here?

1048
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:28,135
Almost 30 years.

1049
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:32,374
Almost 30 years.
Very often...

1050
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,610
she knows what I'm thinking

1051
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:38,251
and she goes ahead of me.

1052
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:40,294
What about in his heart?

1053
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:41,655
Does he love you?

1054
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:46,450
Yes.

1055
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:47,940
In my heart, yes.

1056
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,893
What is he getting at?

1057
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:54,050
I want him
to acknowledge his heart.

1058
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:01,617
Yes, he wants to know everything.

1059
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:07,139
It is hard to get away
from his questioning.

1060
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:11,211
- You love him though.
-Yes, of course, I love him too.

1061
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:16,491
I asked earlier if
you had a picture of Dalia.

1062
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:23,899
I have some pictures.

1063
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:28,014
But it does not seem
proper to show them.

1064
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:30,490
That is what
I have always believed.

1065
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:35,973
The other girls are visible. Is it
that her pictures are hard to find?

1066
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:37,574
Which other girls?

1067
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:41,496
Nati... the first wife...

1068
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,090
Mirta.

1069
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,649
Cecilia.

1070
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:54,099
There are some names

1071
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:56,734
I do not recognize.

1072
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:59,019
There must be a mistake.

1073
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:01,934
No, one was Nati.

1074
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:05,099
Nati, I know her.

1075
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:07,058
Celia Sénchez?

1076
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:10,170
I know Celia Sénchez.

1077
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:12,174
And the first wife.

1078
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:16,538
Yes, but you said before
"Cecilia" instead of Celia.

1079
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:19,658
- It's a different name in Spanish.
-Let me say...

1080
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:22,657
it has always been
a habit with me

1081
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:26,736
that I don't think I have a right
to talk about relationships

1082
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:29,130
I have had with ladies.

1083
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:33,733
That is my first rule.

1084
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:37,929
Not even with
the mother of his sons?

1085
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:46,172
She may be the mother
of my sons and she may not be.

1086
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:51,698
Well, she's married officially, no?

1087
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:52,817
No.

1088
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,018
A formality I have avoided.

1089
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:01,259
I married once.

1090
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:03,619
I did not need to again.

1091
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:06,458
So...

1092
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:08,219
really...

1093
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:15,129
when you asked me about Mirta...

1094
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,333
She knew she was marrying
a revolutionary.

1095
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:24,940
Why do people say
Celia was the great love?

1096
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:29,017
She was an extraordinary woman.

1097
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:33,458
It was a different
kind of relationship.

1098
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:38,012
And I've never talked about that.

1099
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:50,376
It has not been
a life without love.

1100
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:53,453
It has has been a life...

1101
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:56,255
with love.

1102
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:00,020
It is a story I do not
have the right to make public.

1103
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:09,295
He reminds me of my father.

1104
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:11,531
For that generation,
it's a little bit

1105
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,976
harder to talk about
private affairs.

1106
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:17,935
<i>Fidelito.</i>

1107
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:23,651
<i>- Hello, Fidel Junior.
-Hi.</i>

1108
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:27,132
<i>That': a very good-looking puppy
you have there. ls he yours?</i>

1109
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:28,893
<i>No, somebody</i>

1110
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:31,017
<i>gave it to my father.</i>

1111
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:34,299
Has he been a good father?
I mean he's been so busy.

1112
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,776
Politically, as a revolutionary,

1113
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:44,851
I refuse to mix
my family with politics.

1114
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:48,454
Really, the idea of First Ladies...

1115
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:51,530
seems ridiculous to me.

1116
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:53,930
The time I have devoted
to my children

1117
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:56,979
has not been so much.

1118
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:00,932
If you measure
my being a good father

1119
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,377
by time spent with them,

1120
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:08,659
then perhaps
I have not been a good father.

1121
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:12,179
But I am capable of feeling...

1122
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:16,333
and I do feel for them

1123
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:19,379
even though I do not spend
all day with them.

1124
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:24,057
When I am with them

1125
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:28,252
I try to make the most of
the time we have together.

1126
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:50,177
Why, if Mr. Castro...
I feel he's very popular

1127
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,092
with young people, a new generation
70 or 80 percent...?

1128
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:56,219
Why not have an election now?

1129
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:01,739
That is the wrong

1130
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:03,656
question.

1131
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,378
Because it is based

1132
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:07,575
on the assumption

1133
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:10,736
that there is no
electoral system in Cuba,

1134
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:14,056
and that there
are no elections here.

1135
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:16,330
Possibly

1136
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:20,698
our elections are much more
democratic than in other countries.

1137
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:22,259
He should study

1138
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:27,214
our electoral system,

1139
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:30,893
the participation
of all our citizens,

1140
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:33,616
who elect delegates
from every region.

1141
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:35,490
The Party

1142
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:38,056
does not put up candidates.

1143
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:42,012
It is the citizens who choose.

1144
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:44,820
You cannot start
from the assumption

1145
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:46,459
that there are no elections.

1146
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:50,979
What about the government's

1147
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:53,370
discrimination
against homosexuals?

1148
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:58,254
At the beginning
in this country there was

1149
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:02,734
a machista spirit...

1150
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:05,334
<i>machista...</i>

1151
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:14,538
and prejudice.
Over the years

1152
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:16,737
that has declined

1153
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:19,770
to the point where
there is practically

1154
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:25,737
no kind of problem.

1155
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:32,057
It has been difficult due to
our male-dominated heritage.

1156
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:34,251
What about the black population?

1157
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:35,376
Well...

1158
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:39,298
the black population
is the poorest.

1159
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:44,334
But it also benefited most

1160
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:45,854
from the Revolution.

1161
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:47,135
Thanks to him,

1162
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,256
I have what I have.

1163
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:50,934
"I have what I should have,"
as Nicolas Guillén said.

1164
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:53,529
Thanks to him.

1165
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:56,738
Believe me, from my heart...

1166
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:59,610
They are the most revolutionary.

1167
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:04,295
Are there any black
political leaders?

1168
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:09,809
Yes, we have black
political leaders,

1169
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:12,210
but we are still not satisfied.

1170
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:15,215
I think that we have still not

1171
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:20,409
achieved the true possibility
of equal opportunities.

1172
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:25,811
What's going to happen
in Colombia right now?

1173
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:27,975
There came a point

1174
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,855
where the ceasefire was broken...

1175
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:36,169
and negotiations
were broken off.

1176
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:41,536
And this may lead to

1177
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:42,895
a very bloody war.

1178
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:46,777
So he sees another Vietnam?

1179
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:49,090
What I see is a civil war.

1180
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:52,336
I could not
compare it to Vietnam

1181
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:57,574
because events do not take place
in exactly the same way.

1182
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:01,336
Without any doubt it will be

1183
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:05,340
complicated as there
are different forces.

1184
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:15,698
If there is a power structure
that runs the world,

1185
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:19,930
would you want Nelson Mandela

1186
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:21,738
to have a neutron bomb?

1187
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:32,375
No. I know something about that...

1188
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:35,576
My deepest conviction

1189
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,570
is that

1190
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:42,611
he does not even know
where those weapons are.

1191
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:45,937
I spoke with Mandela about that.

1192
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:49,980
I asked him what he knew
about those nuclear weapons.

1193
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:53,336
And what the military had told him.

1194
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:56,419
Where were they? And he said,

1195
01:21:57,340 --> 01:21:58,853
that he'd been told

1196
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:03,372
that they had been destroyed,

1197
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:06,576
that they had been disarmed.

1198
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:11,697
There's a movie in America now

1199
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:16,696
showing America as powerful,
America patriotic, nationalistic...

1200
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:22,094
fighting wars against

1201
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:23,290
terrorism...

1202
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:24,609
drugs...

1203
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:31,937
The army is very scary,
the weapons are very scary.

1204
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:33,056
Where is this going?

1205
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:39,533
That's the same question
many of us ask.

1206
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:43,451
I think that the world

1207
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:47,099
will become more
and more ungovernable.

1208
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:52,137
It is impossible

1209
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,618
to establish a world order

1210
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:58,492
based on force.

1211
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:03,457
The solution to the world's
problems is not a military one.

1212
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:09,419
I have the hope
that the American people

1213
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:12,449
will play a decisive role

1214
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:17,092
in defending changes

1215
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:19,699
for a more humane order.

1216
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:23,852
Che said many Vietnams
will bring down America.

1217
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:27,812
From a strategic point
of view, his way of thinking

1218
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:31,177
was right.
Not "bring down America."

1219
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:35,613
I never heard Che say
"bring down America."

1220
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:37,896
The U.S. is the U.S. people.

1221
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:41,099
First of all put
an end to corruption,

1222
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:43,259
and put an end

1223
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:44,535
to abuses,

1224
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:48,178
to repression in this hemisphere.

1225
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:50,531
That was Che's first priority.

1226
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:53,138
He meant the fight

1227
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:55,018
against colonialism...

1228
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:58,298
That is what Che meant by that.

1229
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:02,458
People who I have talked to before

1230
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:05,936
told me that Che, he came back

1231
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:07,215
from Africa,

1232
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:10,700
they told me he had
two nervous breakdowns,

1233
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:14,730
and he came back here,
went to a clinic,

1234
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:16,770
he had a 48-hour

1235
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:19,090
meeting with Fidel and then he...

1236
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:21,857
he slammed the door
on the way out

1237
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:25,134
and then he went to Bolivia.

1238
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:34,892
If history is written like that,

1239
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:38,377
then I would never read it again.

1240
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:44,574
<i>Here is a letter</i>

1241
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:47,892
<i>from our comrade
Ernesto Guevara...</i>

1242
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:49,891
<i>“Fidel,</i>

1243
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:53,651
<i>I feel I have fulfilled that part</i>

1244
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:55,697
<i>of my duty</i>

1245
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:58,090
<i>that bound me
to the Cuban Revolution</i>

1246
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:02,299
<i>on its territory
and now [leave you,</i>

1247
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:04,019
<i>the comrades,</i>

1248
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:06,569
<i>and your people,
which is also mine.“</i>

1249
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:08,770
The truth is...

1250
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:11,976
that when he joined us in Mexico

1251
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:14,655
he asked for one thing.

1252
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:17,130
That when the Cuban Revolution
was complete,

1253
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:20,737
he wanted to go on.

1254
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:24,050
And he did not want,

1255
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:25,654
for reasons of state,

1256
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:30,933
us to forbid him to go.

1257
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:33,250
That was the idea he had in mind.

1258
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:36,496
I heard that

1259
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:37,695
he pissed off people.

1260
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:40,410
That he was not a compromiser.

1261
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:44,216
And I heard that
he embarrassed Cuba

1262
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:47,577
because he attacked the Russians and
the Russians were upset with him.

1263
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:49,139
He was critical

1264
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:53,492
of the use
of capitalist categories

1265
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:58,459
to build socialism.

1266
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:02,054
Did the Soviets tell Fidel
to get rid of him, put him away?

1267
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:05,334
Never. That would be
like asking me

1268
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:09,417
to get rid of Raul.

1269
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:11,890
A man would say the motivation
might very well be that he was...

1270
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:14,210
Che goes to Africa,

1271
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:18,579
where he has a mostly successful
experience, comes back

1272
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,731
and Cuba must seem
very small to him.

1273
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:23,414
He wants to expand right away.

1274
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:26,178
I sent him to Africa,

1275
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:28,899
and I'll tell you why.

1276
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:31,491
He was very impatient.

1277
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:34,215
He wanted to go

1278
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:35,495
to South America.

1279
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:38,573
I did not believe
that conditions were still right

1280
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:43,531
and that we still had to fulfill
our mission in Africa.

1281
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:45,095
Because

1282
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:48,214
he was very impatient

1283
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:51,177
and guerrillas need to be young.

1284
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:53,935
Some people said

1285
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:55,654
that Fidel could have

1286
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:58,380
put more pressure in Bolivia

1287
01:26:58,540 --> 01:26:59,610
to help Che.

1288
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:02,770
That was a combined operation.

1289
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:05,579
It would have taken time.

1290
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:10,059
It was a guerrilla struggle
in its first phase.

1291
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:13,299
When you initiate it,

1292
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:17,092
the terrain, the people
are unfamiliar.

1293
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:22,892
And I wanted him to get
there with the utmost safety.

1294
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:26,255
But differences arose between him...

1295
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:31,858
rivalry on the part of

1296
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:36,855
the leader of the
Communist Party leader.

1297
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:39,779
There were contradictions.

1298
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:43,413
<i>Other lands</i>

1299
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:48,654
<i>call for my modest efforts.</i>

1300
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,299
<i>To my children, to my wife,
I do not leave</i>

1301
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:56,291
<i>anything material,
and I do not regret it.</i>

1302
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:59,178
<i>I am happy that it is so.</i>

1303
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:03,177
<i>I do not ask for anything
for them because the state</i>

1304
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:05,616
<i>will provide all they need to live</i>

1305
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:06,975
<i>and to be educated.</i>

1306
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:18,809
I'm going to quote

1307
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:21,176
an actor, Vittorio Gassman.
He was interviewed

1308
01:28:21,340 --> 01:28:23,331
when he was 70.
He said,

1309
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:25,377
"Life should be lived twice.

1310
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:29,898
The first time is a rehearsal, and
the second time we'd live for real."

1311
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,292
Always back to philosophy.

1312
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:40,336
I wish...

1313
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:43,697
we could think of life

1314
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:46,378
as in two parts.

1315
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:48,458
One part as a rehearsal

1316
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:51,056
and the other part

1317
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:53,175
as the real thing.

1318
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:58,216
It happened to him,
to me, to everyone.

1319
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:02,817
Yes, but there are things
in all our lives...

1320
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:05,494
So possibly twice...

1321
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:09,616
It's enough to be born just once.

1322
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:11,895
Did he make mistakes?

1323
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:16,138
Yes, like everyone.

1324
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:22,417
Life is a process
of learning ideas, values.

1325
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:27,090
We are not born with ideas.

1326
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:31,496
We are not born with values.

1327
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,537
We are taught those things.

1328
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:39,536
Or to a certain extent
we teach them to ourselves.

1329
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:46,652
Is there any
specific moment, regret,

1330
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:48,254
political, personal,

1331
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:50,855
that you would just
go back now and change it?

1332
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,499
If I were born again...

1333
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:00,576
I would be the same as I am now...

1334
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:08,851
given that I was born
under the same circumstances.

1335
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:18,970
<i>Let us not fool ourselves
into thinking</i>

1336
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:23,335
<i>that what lies ahead will be easy.</i>

1337
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:28,974
<i>Perhaps what lies ahead</i>

1338
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:31,130
<i>will all be</i>

1339
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:32,290
<i>more difficult.</i>

1340
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:44,329
I have

1341
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:47,652
to take you to the airport.
That's my only guarantee.

1342
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:49,051
Let's go.

1343
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:57,617
Oliver, don't waste
another minute.

1344
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:01,252
It's a Mexican plane.

1345
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:23,013
No flowers or gifts,
we'll mail them to you.

1346
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:28,771
Life is good to you.

1347
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:33,212
Same here.

1348
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:38,257
It was good because
it brought you here.

1349
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:42,380
Many, many thanks.

1350
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:43,291
Thank you.

1351
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:48,459
Good luck.

1352
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:02,499
Leave him here
so we can feed him up.

1353
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:05,700
That would be good,
to do some volunteer work.

1354
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:34,652
<i>Those who would give up essential Liberty
to obtain a little temporary Safety</i>

1355
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:37,932
<i>deserve neither Liberty
nor Safety. Benjamin Franklin.</i>
