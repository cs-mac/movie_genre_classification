[10 years later, the border
between Joseon and Later Jin.]

3
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:40,176
[Episode 39]

4
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:55,887
Look!

5
00:00:55,887 --> 00:00:58,864
It seems like our Joseon citizens
have escaped from Later Jin again!

6
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:01,847
Sound the alarms
and alert the General! Quickly!

7
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:03,076
Yes, sir!

8
00:01:10,364 --> 00:01:13,486
Hang in there! We're almost there!

9
00:01:13,487 --> 00:01:19,962
We'll be under Joseon protection as soon
as we reach that tower! Hang in there!

10
00:01:27,144 --> 00:01:30,151
The Joseon prisoners have run away!

11
00:01:30,152 --> 00:01:32,786
Catch them! Catch them all!

12
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:46,539
General.

13
00:01:57,521 --> 00:01:59,391
Are you okay, Miss?

14
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:07,590
I... I think this is the end for me.

15
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:13,626
What are you talking about? Didn't you
leave your husband behind in Hanyang?

16
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:16,891
You need to go back and see him again!

17
00:02:16,893 --> 00:02:21,718
Get up now. We just have
to pass that tower over there.

18
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:25,588
Our Joseon soldiers will protect us!

19
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:35,221
Get up now. Quickly! Quickly!

20
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:38,221
General, you can't do that.
Those people are Joseon citizens.

21
00:02:38,222 --> 00:02:41,842
They are innocent prisoners who were
captured by the Later Jin soldiers.

22
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:45,427
Those people have escaped
so they could survive, sir.

23
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:47,400
Don't you think I know that?

24
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:52,137
However, what about the treaty we
agreed upon when we surrendered to them?

25
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:54,975
If they don't serve their time...

26
00:02:54,977 --> 00:02:57,518
not a single one of them
will be able to return to Joseon.

27
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,179
If we accept them, then the Later Jin
will see it as an act of war.

28
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,395
General, please!

29
00:03:04,971 --> 00:03:09,480
Get the soldiers ready. We will
shoot them if they try to cross over.

30
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:30,324
What... what is that?

31
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:34,067
Are the soldiers aiming their guns at us?

32
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:47,472
Look here! We're from Joseon!
We're Joseon citizens, you punks!

33
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:15,493
Oh my gosh, what do I do?
Where... where do I go?

34
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:22,781
Ma'am, are you okay?
Oh my! Oh my, look at this sweat!

35
00:04:22,782 --> 00:04:24,293
Goodness, this sweat.

36
00:04:24,294 --> 00:04:29,230
I'm fine. I'm still... I'm still...

37
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:33,303
Oh my! Oh my, this won't do.

38
00:04:33,304 --> 00:04:36,127
I think we need to notify
Lord Joo Won right away.

39
00:04:36,128 --> 00:04:40,793
No, he's in the palace right now.

40
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:42,819
Today, there's going to be...

41
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:46,735
Ma'am! What do we do?
Oh, goodness!

42
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:50,326
Oh my goodness, the baby is ready
to come out. It's ready to come out!

43
00:04:52,882 --> 00:04:54,978
- Princess!
- Ma'am!

44
00:04:56,469 --> 00:05:00,465
This won't do. We don't have time
to wait for the midwife to come.

45
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:14,542
Ma'am! Your Highness!
Your Highness!

46
00:05:14,543 --> 00:05:22,002
Your Highness, please push
a little more! Your Highness!

47
00:05:24,104 --> 00:05:26,022
Your Highness!

48
00:05:26,023 --> 00:05:29,062
A little more. Just a little more!

49
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:41,086
So, how is it going?

50
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:45,032
It's taking longer than we expected.
There is still no news yet.

51
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:49,070
How many hours has it been already?

52
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:56,578
Ma'am, is Lord Joo Won
inside the royal library?

53
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:59,918
The crown prince is in the middle
of his studies. Why do you ask?

54
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,685
There is an urgent message
from Lord Joo Won's residence.

55
00:06:01,686 --> 00:06:04,385
Princess Jungmyung is in labor!

56
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:06,058
What?

57
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:18,543
[Crown Prince Sohyun]

58
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:25,545
It's been two hours already.

59
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:28,850
I can't believe there isn't any news yet.

60
00:06:30,082 --> 00:06:33,052
Please focus on your studies,
Your Highness.

61
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:36,696
Worrying won't change anything.

62
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:41,109
Teacher, does it look
like I can study right now?

63
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,032
Look at this. I'm so nervous
that my hands are all sweaty.

64
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:47,849
Next is the Book of Odes.
The consumption chapter.

65
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:52,713
Please look kindly upon me
just this once, Teacher.

66
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,455
Your Highness,
why are you being so fretful?

67
00:06:58,456 --> 00:07:02,722
When a woman is in labor,
there is nothing a man can do.

68
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,586
You must be calm at times like this.

69
00:07:05,587 --> 00:07:09,311
- Teacher!
- Your Highness, it's Court Lady Kim.

70
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:12,389
There is an urgent message
for Lord Joo Won.

71
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:16,333
You may enter.

72
00:07:20,492 --> 00:07:22,066
What's going on?

73
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,827
You must return home immediately.

74
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:28,286
Princess Jungmyung has started her labor.

75
00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:33,145
What? Princess Jungmyung?

76
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:37,364
When?

77
00:07:37,365 --> 00:07:42,575
It's so soon. When did it start?
How is her condition?

78
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:46,684
- Teacher.
- Yes?

79
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:51,088
You told me to be calm and prudent.
What's going on here?

80
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:55,286
Your Highness.

81
00:07:55,287 --> 00:07:57,901
The truth is, Princess Jungmyung
had two breached pregnancies before

82
00:07:57,902 --> 00:08:01,180
and she suffered very much
trying to give birth to them.

83
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:05,633
You said there's nothing a man can do
when a woman is in labor.

84
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:08,535
You know quite a bit.

85
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,239
Forget it, Teacher.

86
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:21,045
Then... how about we call it a day, okay?

87
00:08:23,747 --> 00:08:26,779
We must continue your studies.
Even if it's late tonight.

88
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,237
Of course.
How can I avoid your nagging?

89
00:08:30,238 --> 00:08:33,136
Don't worry, and just go.

90
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,514
Well... please excuse me then.

91
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:39,274
Yes, yes.

92
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:41,924
- Quickly, quickly!
- Yes.

93
00:08:43,696 --> 00:08:46,850
Okay, so how is her condition right now?

94
00:08:48,586 --> 00:08:51,978
He's always been so rigid,
like a birch tree.

95
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,398
At times like this, he is such
a worry wart, don't you agree?

96
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:59,139
When it concerns Princess Jungmyung.

97
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,972
Yes, it seems so.

98
00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:08,000
How is the Crown Princess doing?

99
00:09:22,005 --> 00:09:23,810
Father!

100
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:25,889
Man Young.

101
00:09:27,677 --> 00:09:29,764
- You came.
- Yes, Father.

102
00:09:29,765 --> 00:09:31,480
How is Princess Jungmyung?

103
00:09:36,673 --> 00:09:38,390
Joo Won!

104
00:09:42,227 --> 00:09:45,221
Goodness! It came out!
It came out!

105
00:09:45,222 --> 00:09:49,523
It's another strong and stout son!

106
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:58,704
What about the Princess?
How is she doing, Ok Joo?

107
00:10:06,112 --> 00:10:10,423
Oh my word, look at him smile.

108
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:13,851
How can a newborn baby
be so sweet like this?

109
00:10:16,102 --> 00:10:20,116
Weren't the two young masters
like this, too?

110
00:10:20,117 --> 00:10:24,449
My husband was hoping for a little girl.

111
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:27,207
Goodness, what are you talking about?

112
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:31,954
There are people who can't have sons
even if they try. You have three.

113
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,429
Princess.

114
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,339
Husband.

115
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:43,956
Hello, sir.

116
00:10:44,764 --> 00:10:48,222
Congratulations, My Lord.

117
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:58,211
You must've been so worried.

118
00:10:58,212 --> 00:11:01,031
I had no idea you were in labor.

119
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:06,009
Why did you come here?
This wasn't anything to worry about.

120
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:09,851
Nonsense. There's nothing more
important than this for me.

121
00:11:11,102 --> 00:11:13,062
Husband.

122
00:11:14,038 --> 00:11:16,586
I should've been by your side.

123
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:19,538
- I had no idea.
- No, it's fine.

124
00:11:20,641 --> 00:11:24,065
The baby was in a hurry to come out.

125
00:11:27,173 --> 00:11:31,237
But, what about the palace?
What about the Crown Princess?

126
00:11:31,238 --> 00:11:33,900
It's your first grandchild, Your Majesty.

127
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,790
What?

128
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,807
My first grandchild, you say?

129
00:11:45,794 --> 00:11:51,065
- Is it a boy this time?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

130
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:55,015
The Crown Princess finally gave
birth to a son, Your Majesty.

131
00:11:58,201 --> 00:11:59,785
My goodness.

132
00:12:00,315 --> 00:12:02,817
What good news.

133
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,841
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

134
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:11,235
It's been such a long time since the
palace had something to celebrate over.

135
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:13,371
Yes, it has.

136
00:12:13,908 --> 00:12:16,146
Sukwon...

137
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:22,134
This country has only been in turmoil.

138
00:12:23,428 --> 00:12:27,842
The Crown Prince and Princess
have given me such a joyous gift.

139
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:56,552
Princess... good job.

140
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:59,401
Thank you so much.

141
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,264
[Gang Bin]

142
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:03,380
Your Highness.

143
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:06,736
In a difficult time like this.

144
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:12,040
Still, I can't believe I have a son.

145
00:13:20,117 --> 00:13:21,668
Is that so?

146
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:23,586
Princess Jungmyung had a safe delivery

147
00:13:23,586 --> 00:13:26,146
and the Crown Princess
also gave birth to a son?

148
00:13:26,148 --> 00:13:28,333
Yes, My Lord.
That is what they say.

149
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:38,618
It seems we have hope again.

150
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,664
Even so, new life will always be born.

151
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:48,632
Don't you think a day like that
will come for this land, too?

152
00:13:59,644 --> 00:14:01,350
Husband.

153
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,226
Yes, Princess.

154
00:14:03,832 --> 00:14:06,043
That will happen for certain.

155
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,510
It's a war, Your Majesty!

156
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:21,564
The Later Jin's army is closing in!

157
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:25,988
Your Majesty, we must flee!
The palace will be seized!

158
00:14:28,725 --> 00:14:30,401
To where?

159
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:33,488
Where do we flee again?

160
00:14:35,789 --> 00:14:39,709
Granted, the Later Jin's army
could not be stopped.

161
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:44,577
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am!

162
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,322
- Your Majesty!
- Princess.

163
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:51,588
I pray...

164
00:14:52,900 --> 00:15:00,315
I pray you and this country
will be safe... I pray...

165
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:12,291
- Mother!
- Ma'am!

166
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:15,435
- Your Majesty!
- Mother!

167
00:15:15,437 --> 00:15:18,221
- Your Majesty!
- Ma'am!

168
00:15:18,222 --> 00:15:21,832
My Lord. Lord Won Ik.

169
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,187
You guys...

170
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:33,884
will have to endure this difficult time.

171
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:37,173
Forgive me...

172
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,110
for leaving first.

173
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:45,737
My Lord!

174
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,353
Lord Won Ik.

175
00:15:53,414 --> 00:15:55,375
My Lord.

176
00:16:01,052 --> 00:16:03,937
We've lost many precious people.

177
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,038
Please save us!

178
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:29,153
Please let us rest in Joseon!

179
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,778
Sir! Sir!

180
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:35,718
Please do not return us
to the Later Jin!

181
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:39,322
I beg you! Sir, please save us!

182
00:16:39,322 --> 00:16:41,514
Sir, please...

183
00:16:43,105 --> 00:16:45,905
Why are you taking us back
to the Later Jin?

184
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:53,888
We don't want to go back!

185
00:17:10,216 --> 00:17:13,618
Hey, Soo Deok.
Am I doing this right?

186
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:17,266
Come on now! Since you've never been
married, of course you don't know!

187
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,571
Hand it over.

188
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:23,015
Honey.

189
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:26,057
- You still have a ways to go?
- No, it's almost done.

190
00:17:26,057 --> 00:17:27,838
What about the feast?

191
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,623
What feast?
It's just going to be a modest meal.

192
00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:33,666
I'm just going to make a
couple of jeons, that's all.

193
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:34,843
I see.

194
00:17:34,844 --> 00:17:37,564
Goodness, that's better than
nothing in this day and age.

195
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:39,797
It's more than enough.

196
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,006
Oh my, where did you get
these peppers? They're so tiny.

197
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:48,486
Your Highness, congratulations
on the birth of your first son.

198
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,890
Thank you, Prince Bongrim.

199
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:01,701
If Mother was alive to see this...
She would've been so happy.

200
00:18:02,596 --> 00:18:04,382
[Prince Bongrim]

201
00:18:09,146 --> 00:18:12,778
However, hope will come, Princess.

202
00:18:16,565 --> 00:18:18,192
Ma'am.

203
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:21,152
- Mother.
- Mother.

204
00:18:21,153 --> 00:18:23,497
Man Yong. Man Young.

205
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:28,149
The two young masters
wanted to see their little brother.

206
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,974
Sit down.

207
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:39,958
What do you think?

208
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:43,115
Even in the midst of tribulation,
we must end it.

209
00:18:43,784 --> 00:18:46,579
That's only if we do not give up.

210
00:18:46,997 --> 00:18:50,643
Court Lady Jung, prepare the coach.
I need to leave.

211
00:18:50,644 --> 00:18:55,856
Pardon? Ma'am, what do you mean?

212
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:58,343
How can you leave right now,
in your condition?

213
00:18:58,344 --> 00:19:03,593
I'm all right and we don't have
time for this, so please hurry.

214
00:19:12,854 --> 00:19:16,586
- You came, Lord Ryoo.
- Yes.

215
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:21,234
Are the other officials who
want to see me here as well?

216
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:22,820
Huh?

217
00:19:22,821 --> 00:19:25,082
Yes, they're all inside
the assembly hall right now.

218
00:19:28,731 --> 00:19:32,509
Seriously, it would be nice
to get some rest on a day like this.

219
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,286
Seriously, this is quite annoying.

220
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:37,699
I swear.

221
00:19:38,855 --> 00:19:40,365
Father.

222
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,245
Is that so?

223
00:19:43,246 --> 00:19:47,922
An incident like that
occurred at the border again?

224
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:52,284
During the last war against Later Jin...

225
00:19:52,285 --> 00:19:55,890
About 50,000 of our people
were taken as prisoners.

226
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:59,508
But we couldn't do anything
to bring them back.

227
00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:06,173
The prisoners decided to escape
and risk their lives so they could live.

228
00:20:06,175 --> 00:20:09,801
Goodness, everyone knows that.

229
00:20:09,802 --> 00:20:13,514
- Teach us what we don't know, Lee Pan.
- Secretary.

230
00:20:13,515 --> 00:20:16,504
Do you think Lee Pan
is trying to teach right now?

231
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:20,559
He is telling us the officials
should not forget about those people!

232
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:27,718
Therefore, we've been negotiating
constantly, have we not?

233
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:31,842
By returning the
prisoners to the Later Jin.

234
00:20:31,843 --> 00:20:35,259
Yes, of course we're doing that.

235
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:40,786
But you know it is not
an ideal situation, Father.

236
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:43,375
You're right.

237
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:48,726
I hear the wealthy nobles have
been making deals with the Later Jin

238
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,339
in order to get their
captured family members back.

239
00:20:53,632 --> 00:20:57,599
Because of that, the price of the
prisoners is going up drastically.

240
00:20:58,154 --> 00:21:02,502
Later Jin is refusing
to negotiate with us.

241
00:21:07,628 --> 00:21:09,345
I swear...

242
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:11,970
Father! Over there!

243
00:21:14,532 --> 00:21:16,788
So Jung!

244
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:23,115
- Father!
- My baby! My precious daughter!

245
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,500
There's no need to worry anymore.
It's all fine now.

246
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,851
- Goodness...
- Take it.

247
00:21:28,852 --> 00:21:31,221
It's okay, it's okay.

248
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:38,053
This is the money we promised.

249
00:21:43,715 --> 00:21:45,173
Yes.

250
00:21:45,173 --> 00:21:47,027
But there are rumors going around

251
00:21:47,028 --> 00:21:51,011
that our own officials are
involved in those deals as well.

252
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:54,695
Because of that...

253
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:59,195
the price of the prisoners have increased
to several thousand pieces of silver.

254
00:22:00,314 --> 00:22:07,600
The poor and weak citizens are not
capable of getting their family back.

255
00:22:22,106 --> 00:22:28,048
Your Majesty!

256
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:34,798
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

257
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:42,562
Please stop the illegal dealings
of the nobles!

258
00:22:43,538 --> 00:22:45,191
If this continues...

259
00:22:45,192 --> 00:22:52,072
People like us will never be able
to get our family back, Your Majesty!

260
00:22:52,073 --> 00:23:03,282
Your Majesty!

261
00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:07,489
So, it's settled.

262
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:13,916
Due to the officials' selfishness,
the people have no other choice!

263
00:23:14,717 --> 00:23:18,728
In the end, the Joseon people are risking
their lives to flee their imprisonment.

264
00:23:18,729 --> 00:23:24,896
But we are forcing them to return!

265
00:23:24,897 --> 00:23:31,009
Yes, well... that's very unfortunate.

266
00:23:32,526 --> 00:23:36,026
Our hands are tied behind our backs.

267
00:23:36,027 --> 00:23:39,657
The Later Jin will throw a fit
if we don't return the prisoners.

268
00:23:39,658 --> 00:23:42,293
Talking about this without
taking any proper measures...

269
00:23:44,485 --> 00:23:47,076
Why do you think this happened?

270
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:51,487
Why do you think we're in this situation,
and we can't do anything about it?

271
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,335
You startled me.

272
00:23:54,336 --> 00:23:59,067
Why are you taking your anger out
on me? Is this war my responsibility?

273
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:02,670
That's right! It is your responsibility!

274
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:11,032
It's a crime that we can't do anything
about it. It's all our responsibility!

275
00:24:17,512 --> 00:24:20,246
I mean, seriously,
what is the matter with him?

276
00:24:20,247 --> 00:24:24,521
Did we feign ignorance,
or am I Huang Taiji?

277
00:24:24,522 --> 00:24:27,035
Why is all of that my responsibility?

278
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,534
Come to think of it,
you kind of look like him.

279
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:34,669
Really? That barbarian
dares to look like me?

280
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:37,326
Yes, I've seen a
picture of him before...

281
00:24:37,327 --> 00:24:41,396
That's enough. Now is not the time
to be talking about nonsense like that!

282
00:24:45,787 --> 00:24:47,314
And you.

283
00:24:47,315 --> 00:24:48,800
Tell it to me straight.

284
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:52,000
Rumors are that your father
secretly got your sister back

285
00:24:52,002 --> 00:24:54,621
by dealing with the Later Jin.
Is that true?

286
00:24:56,152 --> 00:24:59,312
And that he gave them
1,000 pieces of silver in return.

287
00:25:00,503 --> 00:25:02,560
The thing is...

288
00:25:02,561 --> 00:25:06,167
Look, I'm Kim Gyung Jing.

289
00:25:10,403 --> 00:25:13,398
Fine, it's just between us.

290
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:17,500
The truth is, we gave them
500 pieces of silver on top of that.

291
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,495
- What?
- Be quiet!

292
00:25:20,496 --> 00:25:23,398
1,500 pieces of silver, then?

293
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:26,833
That rotten barbarian's word
doesn't match up.

294
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:29,795
At first he only asked for 1,000 pieces
of silver, but he knew we had money

295
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:31,544
so he just kept asking
for more and more...

296
00:25:31,545 --> 00:25:37,185
Look here! Look here, Gyung Jing!
Are you serious right now?

297
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:46,481
Sir, why are you worried
about such a thing?

298
00:25:48,484 --> 00:25:54,095
Then... was your daughter
supposed to wait for her death?

299
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:57,855
Of course not.

300
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:02,589
But as a man of power...

301
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:05,538
Yes, because of your high position

302
00:26:05,538 --> 00:26:08,474
you were able to make such a deal
with the Later Jin through me.

303
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:16,682
I did my best to help you out,
but it seems this is all my fault.

304
00:26:16,684 --> 00:26:19,528
Somehow, I feel sad about it.

305
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:23,528
No, not at all!
That's not right, either.

306
00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:26,848
You're the one who got me connected
to the Later Jin. You're our savior.

307
00:26:27,672 --> 00:26:32,290
Please drink, My Lord. It's a rare tea
I bought from a Later Jin merchant.

308
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,420
Ah, yes, yes.
Thank you.

309
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:41,483
Well... this is definitely different.

310
00:26:42,715 --> 00:26:47,979
Now then, I believe it is
your turn to interfere, sir.

311
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:53,075
A problem just occurred with Later Jin
they're hoping will be taken care of.

312
00:26:53,076 --> 00:26:58,253
- When you say 'problem'...
- What do you think it is?

313
00:26:58,254 --> 00:27:03,761
The prisoners who recently escaped
are causing them a headache.

314
00:27:04,862 --> 00:27:07,913
Well... Sir... I'm not very
familiar with that issue.

315
00:27:07,913 --> 00:27:17,529
My Lord, the Later Jin are
planning something grand right now.

316
00:27:17,531 --> 00:27:20,132
And that plan will be revealed soon.

317
00:27:23,334 --> 00:27:25,834
I do not think it is wise

318
00:27:25,834 --> 00:27:28,747
to test their patience at a
time like this, don't you agree?

319
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:33,121
If there is a problem...
we must take care of it for them.

320
00:27:37,685 --> 00:27:41,486
Yes, if it's about that incident,
I've received a report about it as well.

321
00:27:42,707 --> 00:27:46,470
I heard our army was returning the
escaped prisoners to the Later Jin

322
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:50,037
but they were attacked by
unidentified individuals.

323
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:51,737
That's not the only thing.

324
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:55,481
There are rumors that they are scheming
with certain officials of this court.

325
00:27:55,483 --> 00:27:58,327
If not, that would be impossible.

326
00:28:00,777 --> 00:28:05,437
Your Highness, by any chance, do you
know anything in regards to this incident?

327
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:10,531
We must be very careful right now.

328
00:28:10,532 --> 00:28:14,838
But I'm afraid that Your Highness
might get caught up in this mess.

329
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:19,784
There is no way.
You're talking nonsense.

330
00:28:21,315 --> 00:28:25,893
Like you said,
we must be very careful right now.

331
00:28:26,815 --> 00:28:30,476
So, I'm going to get
to the bottom of this.

332
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:32,463
Your Highness.

333
00:28:34,148 --> 00:28:38,340
Crown Princess, I must
speak to you for a moment.

334
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,250
Sure, what is it?

335
00:28:47,252 --> 00:28:50,548
Princess Jungmyung
is waiting for you outside.

336
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,627
She wants to pay her respects to you.

337
00:28:53,628 --> 00:28:56,892
Is that so? Princess Jungmyung is here?

338
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,951
Princess Jungmyung.

339
00:29:07,499 --> 00:29:09,682
Welcome.

340
00:29:09,682 --> 00:29:11,870
Your Highness.

341
00:29:12,864 --> 00:29:15,321
Prince Bongrim, you're here too.

342
00:29:15,322 --> 00:29:17,092
Yes, Ma'am.

343
00:29:17,093 --> 00:29:19,978
I heard news of you several days ago.

344
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:22,374
Is it okay for you
to already move around like this?

345
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:26,130
Regardless, I need to pay my respects
to the Crown Prince and Crown Princess.

346
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:29,888
Is it not a joyous occasion the
whole palace has been waiting for?

347
00:29:32,435 --> 00:29:36,810
Please come inside, Ma'am. My son and
the Crown Princess are waiting to see you.

348
00:29:37,425 --> 00:29:39,053
Yes, Your Highness.

349
00:29:54,617 --> 00:29:56,519
Father.

350
00:30:10,748 --> 00:30:13,744
The former queen was a thorn in my side,
and when she finally died...

351
00:30:14,401 --> 00:30:17,096
I thought my time was coming.

352
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:20,874
Princess Jungmyung and the
crown princess all have sons.

353
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:23,169
Why can't I have one?

354
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,997
You must be at ease, My Lady.

355
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:28,672
Then the baby will come to you.

356
00:30:28,673 --> 00:30:31,185
But I can't be at ease.

357
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:35,423
I am not in the King's favor right now.

358
00:30:35,423 --> 00:30:39,598
Plus, Kim Ja Jeom,
who always looked out for me

359
00:30:39,598 --> 00:30:44,269
is now out of the king's favor
and is working outside of the palace.

360
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:51,375
I hear all of that
is the Crown Prince's fault.

361
00:30:53,574 --> 00:30:57,613
His Majesty trusts
the Crown Prince very deeply.

362
00:30:57,614 --> 00:31:01,018
I hear he confides in him
about many national affairs.

363
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:03,978
Kim Ja Jeom was pushed aside
because of that.

364
00:31:05,617 --> 00:31:09,393
And behind that...
was Princess Jungmyung.

365
00:31:09,394 --> 00:31:11,993
I'm sure that sly fox was there.

366
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:17,355
The Crown Prince took her husband
as his teacher.

367
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:20,758
Yes, but the king is not
suspicious of it at all.

368
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:22,997
I'm telling you, it's strange.

369
00:31:22,998 --> 00:31:27,046
No matter how much I tell him,
he pretends not to hear it.

370
00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:32,397
Even if I tell him that the Crown Prince
follows the Princess more than him.

371
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:40,977
So... you came to pay your respects
to the crown prince and his princess.

372
00:31:41,781 --> 00:31:43,625
Yes, Father.

373
00:31:44,265 --> 00:31:46,269
Then, Aunt Jungmyung as well.

374
00:31:46,894 --> 00:31:49,487
I'm sure that's the case
for Aunt Jungmyung, too.

375
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,166
Since it's the law for the royals
to pay respects to each other.

376
00:31:56,813 --> 00:31:58,804
Absolutely, Father.

377
00:31:58,805 --> 00:32:04,759
A royal grandson is born. It would be more
of a problem if she didn't come at all.

378
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:19,580
Yes, that is why I came.

379
00:32:19,581 --> 00:32:23,384
It would be more of a misunderstanding
if I did not come and pay my respects.

380
00:32:23,384 --> 00:32:25,310
You made the right decision, Ma'am.

381
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:29,291
In any case,
I had to see you immediately.

382
00:32:30,168 --> 00:32:32,634
Is there something going on,
Your Highness?

383
00:32:32,636 --> 00:32:34,731
It is about the border incident.

384
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:41,290
It seems the officials
will start an investigation soon.

385
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:45,632
- An investigation will start?
- Yes.

386
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:50,192
It was decided at the meeting
initiated by Yong San.

387
00:32:55,987 --> 00:32:58,091
He's handsome.

388
00:33:00,796 --> 00:33:05,017
Look at this rascal.
He looks exactly like you.

389
00:33:05,782 --> 00:33:08,977
This innocent and stubborn-looking face.

390
00:33:09,746 --> 00:33:11,764
He's going to be exactly
like you some day.

391
00:33:11,765 --> 00:33:13,859
Is that an insult?
To become like me some day?

392
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:17,091
No way, I'm so jealous of you.

393
00:33:17,648 --> 00:33:20,190
You have three kids already.

394
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:27,011
But... shouldn't you get married again?

395
00:33:27,012 --> 00:33:28,915
Once was enough.

396
00:33:29,603 --> 00:33:31,441
Not a chance.

397
00:33:32,825 --> 00:33:34,529
In Woo.

398
00:33:34,531 --> 00:33:38,026
It was a forced marriage.

399
00:33:38,752 --> 00:33:42,310
And she suffered every day for it.

400
00:33:43,184 --> 00:33:45,980
She lost her life during the war, too.

401
00:33:48,774 --> 00:33:52,489
That kind of tragedy
should never happen again, Joo Won.

402
00:33:52,973 --> 00:33:55,994
So, there's no time for us to be
dilly-dallying around like this.

403
00:34:20,278 --> 00:34:22,088
Princess Jungmyung.

404
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:27,972
Gam Jo Gam, what about
the favor I asked of you?

405
00:34:33,914 --> 00:34:37,463
This is the money you received
from selling your land, Ma'am.

406
00:34:38,313 --> 00:34:40,164
You can trust him.

407
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:43,853
It was an urgent sell,
but he sold it for a good price.

408
00:34:43,854 --> 00:34:45,793
Thank you.

409
00:34:45,795 --> 00:34:49,322
Please sell the rest of my other
properties as soon as possible.

410
00:34:49,322 --> 00:34:53,255
But Ma'am, why do you want
to keep selling that good land?

411
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:57,559
That is none of your business.

412
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:01,800
All you have to do
is sell it for her, got it?

413
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:08,072
I'm going to go outside the palace
to get some fresh air.

414
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:11,231
If anyone is looking for me,
just relay that to them, Princess.

415
00:35:12,202 --> 00:35:13,958
Your Highness.

416
00:35:14,751 --> 00:35:19,445
Must you do this?
Isn't there another way?

417
00:35:22,105 --> 00:35:24,887
Princess, what do you mean?

418
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:27,864
I am your wife.

419
00:35:27,865 --> 00:35:32,090
I know what you are thinking.

420
00:35:32,884 --> 00:35:34,269
Princess...

421
00:35:35,153 --> 00:35:39,389
But Your Highness... I am scared.

422
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:44,213
If His Majesty finds out what you're
doing with Princess Jungmyung...

423
00:35:44,215 --> 00:35:46,874
Yes, I know.

424
00:35:47,485 --> 00:35:51,463
I know that by doing this
I am going against my father's will.

425
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,318
Your Highness.

426
00:35:54,318 --> 00:36:01,177
But I can't allow our innocent people
to die in a foreign land.

427
00:36:05,994 --> 00:36:10,075
They have lost their faith
in this country's rule and government.

428
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:16,726
Now it's our turn
to risk our lives for them.

429
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,639
My Lord!

430
00:36:24,112 --> 00:36:27,005
- My Lord!
- What happened?

431
00:36:27,007 --> 00:36:28,865
Has there been any word
from Jang Bong Soo?

432
00:36:28,865 --> 00:36:31,595
Yes, they will be
taking the path to Uiju.

433
00:36:31,596 --> 00:36:34,353
It seems they will be
reaching the country safely.

434
00:36:34,354 --> 00:36:36,038
My Lord.

435
00:36:53,925 --> 00:36:56,413
Sir. Jang Bong Soo.

436
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:01,965
Oh it's you, Ja Gyung.

437
00:37:01,967 --> 00:37:06,278
I received word
that you would come here.

438
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,809
Good.

439
00:37:10,675 --> 00:37:12,242
Here.

440
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:19,037
This is the gunpowder we're going to use,
from the Weapons Bureau.

441
00:37:19,038 --> 00:37:23,738
And this... is money given
to us by Princess Jungmyung.

442
00:37:25,628 --> 00:37:27,423
What about you, sir?

443
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:30,896
Are you really going to join us?

444
00:37:30,896 --> 00:37:33,686
That's right.
I'm going to join you guys today.

445
00:37:33,688 --> 00:37:39,287
My wife is one of those prisoners.
How can I just give this to you and leave?

446
00:37:39,288 --> 00:37:41,293
Sir.

447
00:37:52,652 --> 00:37:53,829
My Lord.

448
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:56,255
- Is everyone here?
- Yes, My Lord.

449
00:37:56,257 --> 00:37:58,593
But the young master has still not...

450
00:38:01,074 --> 00:38:02,896
What happened?

451
00:38:02,898 --> 00:38:06,108
He received a message during
training and left right away.

452
00:38:07,751 --> 00:38:09,460
Is that so?

453
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:33,896
Princess Jungmyung.

454
00:38:35,306 --> 00:38:36,740
My Lord.

455
00:38:36,742 --> 00:38:39,925
Everyone is waiting.
Please come inside.

456
00:38:43,394 --> 00:38:47,269
Let's start the meeting now.

457
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:56,735
As you all know, Later Jin is being more
aggressive due to the prisoners escape.

458
00:39:01,012 --> 00:39:06,483
But... just what on earth
are you all doing?

459
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:11,782
Where and who is causing this mess...

460
00:39:12,994 --> 00:39:16,289
How is it that we can't find out?

461
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:21,902
- Please let us go!
- Please save us!

462
00:39:21,903 --> 00:39:25,909
- Don't send us back!
- Please save us, sir!

463
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:29,219
Please!

464
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:34,199
Soldiers and a boat to Later Jin
will be waiting for us.

465
00:39:35,025 --> 00:39:37,307
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

466
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:40,034
Sir, please save us!

467
00:39:40,035 --> 00:39:43,488
Please do not send us back!

468
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:47,766
- What are you doing? Let's go!
- Sir! Sir!

469
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:53,094
Sir! Sir!

470
00:39:53,095 --> 00:39:56,492
- Get going!
- Please!

471
00:40:13,105 --> 00:40:16,581
- What is going on here?
- General, I think it's an attack!

472
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:19,193
- They're trying to save the prisoners.
- What?

473
00:40:19,195 --> 00:40:22,097
How did they know about our plan?

474
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:43,184
You must not shoot the prisoners!
We have to save them, no matter what!

475
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,800
Do not retreat!
We cannot let go of these prisoners!

476
00:41:01,117 --> 00:41:05,251
General, it's impossible! Their guns
are much more advanced than ours!

477
00:41:05,253 --> 00:41:07,021
What?

478
00:41:07,021 --> 00:41:09,918
We must retreat, General!
The gunpowder is almost gone!

479
00:41:09,918 --> 00:41:13,318
- We will die if we continue!
- Damn it!

480
00:41:34,327 --> 00:41:37,559
Really? So, who is that person?

481
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:39,846
Every time there is an attack...

482
00:41:40,387 --> 00:41:43,329
They come armed with guns and firepower!

483
00:41:43,331 --> 00:41:45,869
And time after time...

484
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:52,930
They knew the secret whereabouts
of the prisoners!

485
00:42:09,423 --> 00:42:13,878
Hurry! We must leave immediately
and get them to safety!

486
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,972
Thank you! Thank you!

487
00:42:24,284 --> 00:42:26,372
It's okay.

488
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:34,425
Let's go. Can you walk?

489
00:42:38,093 --> 00:42:40,005
Wife.

490
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:48,856
Honey.

491
00:42:51,146 --> 00:42:52,947
Wife.

492
00:42:57,371 --> 00:42:59,050
Honey.

493
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,224
Wife.

494
00:43:02,672 --> 00:43:04,365
Sir.

495
00:43:09,177 --> 00:43:10,762
Wife.

496
00:43:24,325 --> 00:43:30,199
Without a doubt,
they have money and power.

497
00:43:31,853 --> 00:43:35,001
And they have intel.

498
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:39,117
- Is the money in transit?
- Yes, Your Highness.

499
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,139
The rescued prisoners were being chased.

500
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:46,517
The money will be used
to find them a new place to live.

501
00:43:47,402 --> 00:43:49,884
What about the gunpowder and weapons?

502
00:43:49,885 --> 00:43:52,923
That is being provided
by the Weapons Bureau.

503
00:43:52,923 --> 00:43:57,528
The Weapons Bureau will be audited in
several days. Will there be any problems?

504
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:01,124
I'll take care of that from my end,
so do not worry.

505
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:04,347
My Lord.

506
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:07,293
Lord Gang Joo Seon is still safe.

507
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:10,918
He has not been able to get any
particular information, Ma'am.

508
00:44:13,378 --> 00:44:15,617
And...

509
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:35,796
these secret border missions will continue
and be provided for by the east palace.

510
00:44:37,851 --> 00:44:44,068
And without a doubt, there is a
powerful supporter behind that movement.

511
00:44:45,871 --> 00:44:48,224
We must find him.

512
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:52,916
We must find that power, no matter what.

513
00:44:52,916 --> 00:44:58,459
Many more eyes and ears
will follow us from now on.

514
00:45:00,128 --> 00:45:04,994
All of you will have to be very careful.

515
00:45:07,572 --> 00:45:13,843
I will not give a single innocent life
to the enemy anymore.

516
00:45:14,496 --> 00:45:20,889
Yes, even if that means I have to
disobey every royal command and law.

517
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:26,644
To me, it's more important than a royal
command and more precious than any law.

518
00:45:27,536 --> 00:45:29,300
This country.

519
00:45:30,601 --> 00:45:33,796
I am going to protect
the lives of my people.

520
00:45:34,889 --> 00:45:39,608
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

521
00:45:49,097 --> 00:45:54,788
What did you say?
The army at the border got attacked again?

522
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:56,666
Yes, Your Majesty.

523
00:45:56,668 --> 00:45:58,769
They were unable
to return the prisoners to Later Jin

524
00:45:58,771 --> 00:46:02,266
because of the surprise attack last night.

525
00:46:02,267 --> 00:46:04,831
They lost everyone, Sire.

526
00:46:04,831 --> 00:46:11,722
So... will those barbarians
send a special envoy again?

527
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:16,958
Are they going to send one
and insult me again?

528
00:46:34,983 --> 00:46:38,387
- Where is Later Jin's emissary?
- He's waiting inside right now.

529
00:46:45,434 --> 00:46:47,599
Look here, sir!

530
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:51,817
Do you think we went easy on you during
the war so we could be insulted like this?

531
00:46:51,818 --> 00:46:53,584
Please calm down.

532
00:46:53,585 --> 00:46:56,469
We still do not know who the culprit is.

533
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:58,856
It is only a scheme
to save the poor souls.

534
00:46:58,856 --> 00:47:02,093
Joseon has no intentions
of going against Later Jin.

535
00:47:02,094 --> 00:47:05,322
If that is the case,
then you must show us that loyalty.

536
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:09,360
Our Khan is looking kindly upon you, sir.

537
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,452
- Don't you think this is unfair?
- Please do not worry.

538
00:47:13,454 --> 00:47:17,882
The officials are involved now,
and the prisoners will be captured soon.

539
00:47:17,883 --> 00:47:21,215
No, no. That is not enough.

540
00:47:21,217 --> 00:47:27,115
Once you catch those prisoners, Joseon
will have to submit to us completely.

541
00:47:28,766 --> 00:47:32,675
The Khan has finally made a decision, sir.

542
00:47:34,182 --> 00:47:36,181
Chief Inspector.

543
00:47:36,825 --> 00:47:39,505
- When you say it's Khan's decision...
- Yes.

544
00:47:39,505 --> 00:47:45,802
So, that titled envoy
will come to Joseon soon.

545
00:47:59,202 --> 00:48:01,164
Ma'am, you're here.

546
00:48:01,847 --> 00:48:03,936
Have you heard the news?

547
00:48:03,938 --> 00:48:06,800
I heard Jang Bong Soo's wife
was rescued last night.

548
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,672
- Is it true?
- Yes, Ma'am.

549
00:48:09,673 --> 00:48:13,642
They've been traveling all night and
she's hiding in the storage right now.

550
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,253
Thanks, Eun Sol. Here you go.

551
00:48:28,255 --> 00:48:30,865
Go ahead and changes your clothes first.

552
00:48:33,664 --> 00:48:36,916
Oh my word, that lovely face of yours.

553
00:48:37,637 --> 00:48:41,199
I can't believe how much you changed.

554
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,481
Ms. Ok Joo.

555
00:48:43,994 --> 00:48:49,157
Change your clothes quickly and
let's get you something to eat, okay?

556
00:48:49,157 --> 00:48:50,740
Eun Sol.

557
00:48:50,742 --> 00:48:53,518
Yes, I'll go and make
some porridge for her.

558
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:56,731
- Great.
- Hey... wait for me.

559
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:59,343
You can't make that by yourself.

560
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,990
Change your clothes first.

561
00:49:06,992 --> 00:49:11,526
I'm... not sure if I deserve
this kind of hospitality.

562
00:49:11,527 --> 00:49:14,827
What do you mean?
You did nothing wrong.

563
00:49:15,922 --> 00:49:20,056
I hid behind our child during the war.

564
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,684
I don't deserve to live.

565
00:49:24,686 --> 00:49:28,490
Woman, are you serious right now?

566
00:49:29,797 --> 00:49:33,447
What about me?
Haven't you thought about me?

567
00:49:33,447 --> 00:49:35,192
- Huh?
- Honey...

568
00:49:35,193 --> 00:49:39,021
We lost our only child during
the war against those barbarians.

569
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:42,490
When I found out you were captured
by them, how do you think I felt?

570
00:49:42,492 --> 00:49:47,608
I was sick with worry if you got
hurt or if you were even alive.

571
00:49:48,173 --> 00:49:51,413
- Every day was torture for me.
- Honey.

572
00:49:52,481 --> 00:49:55,702
I swear to you, nothing happened to me!

573
00:49:55,704 --> 00:50:00,326
If something did happen to me,
I'd rather die...

574
00:50:01,753 --> 00:50:06,570
Stop! That's enough!
Don't say such things.

575
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:10,362
Who cares if something did happen.
It doesn't matter to me.

576
00:50:10,896 --> 00:50:13,427
You're back, and that's all that matters.

577
00:50:13,429 --> 00:50:16,056
That is all that matters.

578
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:38,383
One of the rescued prisoners
was Jang Bong Soo's wife?

579
00:50:38,384 --> 00:50:40,122
Yes, Your Highness.

580
00:50:40,123 --> 00:50:43,902
This all thanks to your support, Sire.

581
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:50,768
If you had not given us
that intel about the border...

582
00:50:50,769 --> 00:50:53,151
We would not have been able
to save those prisoners.

583
00:50:53,775 --> 00:50:55,588
No, Princess Jungmyung.

584
00:50:55,588 --> 00:50:58,527
If it wasn't for your strength and support

585
00:50:58,527 --> 00:51:01,467
I would not have had
the courage to continue.

586
00:51:02,115 --> 00:51:03,934
Your Highness.

587
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:06,780
But this is only the beginning.

588
00:51:06,782 --> 00:51:08,594
Because of these past events

589
00:51:08,595 --> 00:51:13,008
any officials connected to Later Jin
will pursue you more aggressively.

590
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:17,802
Also, I don't know
what kind of countermeasures

591
00:51:17,802 --> 00:51:20,110
Later Jin will attack us with.

592
00:51:21,197 --> 00:51:25,320
- And the King will comply.
- I know.

593
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:28,715
But we will come up with a plan as well.

594
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:33,351
More than ever, you must protect
yourself and your family first.

595
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:36,206
Do you understand?

596
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:41,577
Yes, Your Highness.
You too, Sire.

597
00:51:59,932 --> 00:52:02,541
You've come
to the east palace again, Ma'am.

598
00:52:02,543 --> 00:52:04,498
Prince Bongrim.

599
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:09,122
Please forgive me, but I would
like to talk to you for a moment.

600
00:52:09,123 --> 00:52:11,854
Do you have the time?

601
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:24,697
Find out if there's anything going on

602
00:52:24,697 --> 00:52:27,785
between the Crown Prince
and Princess Jungmyung.

603
00:52:30,554 --> 00:52:33,441
If you find evidence
that they have conspired together...

604
00:52:34,038 --> 00:52:37,626
you will be able
to turn the King's heart around.

605
00:52:41,121 --> 00:52:46,913
Get the coach ready.
I'm going to see the Crown Princess.

606
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,150
Yes, Ma'am.

607
00:53:00,358 --> 00:53:03,914
Prince Bongrim, what do you mean by that?

608
00:53:03,916 --> 00:53:06,572
You want me to keep my distance
from the Crown Prince?

609
00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:12,403
No, you know very well
what I'm talking about.

610
00:53:13,452 --> 00:53:18,210
The whole world knows that you and
the King are at odds with one another.

611
00:53:20,851 --> 00:53:26,159
You're afraid that the King will spurn
the Crown Prince because of me.

612
00:53:27,822 --> 00:53:30,501
I'm very sorry for saying this.

613
00:53:31,418 --> 00:53:34,000
I'm the Crown Prince's brother, Ma'am.

614
00:53:34,001 --> 00:53:38,422
Moreover, I have no choice
but to look out for him.

615
00:53:40,121 --> 00:53:41,956
Prince Bongrim.

616
00:53:41,956 --> 00:53:45,628
My father and brother's relationship
must not break.

617
00:53:46,298 --> 00:53:51,501
The royal family has suffered many
tragedies because of these problems.

618
00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:00,791
So, please do not leave
even a trace of bad luck behind.

619
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:04,172
If you care about Prince Sohyun...

620
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:10,086
Please... please do this.

621
00:54:19,251 --> 00:54:21,559
I've already received your gifts.

622
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:24,693
Why are you giving me
these trinkets again, Sukwon?

623
00:54:26,204 --> 00:54:31,528
Princess, saying those words
is not enough to communicate my heart.

624
00:54:31,528 --> 00:54:36,900
Words are not enough to express one's joy.

625
00:54:40,514 --> 00:54:45,405
I have always wanted to support you.

626
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:52,499
When the former queen was alive,
I could not bring myself to interfere.

627
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:56,333
I was afraid it wasn't
my place to do that.

628
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,878
Sukwon.

629
00:55:01,501 --> 00:55:09,492
But from now on,
I will support and take care of you.

630
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:17,972
I have seen the Crown Prince grow
since he was a little boy.

631
00:55:17,972 --> 00:55:20,579
Granted, I'm not his birth mother...

632
00:55:21,802 --> 00:55:25,666
But the Crown Prince is like a son to me.

633
00:55:30,557 --> 00:55:34,697
Thank you for those kind words.

634
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:39,905
I am happy to know that you
think of him with a mother's heart.

635
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:45,072
Princess.

636
00:56:00,943 --> 00:56:02,336
My Lord.

637
00:56:02,336 --> 00:56:06,063
Did anything happen last night?
What about my father?

638
00:56:06,064 --> 00:56:08,610
It's hard to see your face these days.

639
00:56:15,226 --> 00:56:16,718
Father.

640
00:56:18,173 --> 00:56:19,974
What is it?

641
00:56:20,663 --> 00:56:22,871
Did something happen?

642
00:56:22,872 --> 00:56:27,021
No. I have matters to attend to
at the training center.

643
00:56:29,291 --> 00:56:31,534
There are also things I have
to take care of right away

644
00:56:31,535 --> 00:56:33,535
due to the border incident
several days ago.

645
00:56:35,523 --> 00:56:41,940
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Come inside.

646
00:56:49,858 --> 00:56:55,532
What is this? Just what in the world...
What does all this mean?

647
00:56:55,534 --> 00:57:00,255
Father, what should we do?
This is a royal letter from Later Jin.

648
00:57:00,255 --> 00:57:02,847
How can I give this to the King?

649
00:57:03,807 --> 00:57:05,613
I swear...

650
00:57:05,614 --> 00:57:09,068
Father, I'm the secretary,
and I have to give this to the King.

651
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:11,489
I'm really scared.

652
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:16,405
Father, can't you
give this to him instead of me?

653
00:57:16,407 --> 00:57:21,189
What if he gets angry
and throws something at me?

654
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:27,405
Ah goodness.
By any chance, is this what I think it is?

655
00:57:27,405 --> 00:57:32,599
Later Jin's plan that
Kang Joo Seon talked about?

656
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:34,889
Damn it.

657
00:57:36,237 --> 00:57:38,286
Goodness.

658
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:47,500
Did you just say the Khan
has sent a royal letter?

659
00:57:48,929 --> 00:57:54,358
That's right. It probably arrived
at the palace by now.

660
00:57:56,815 --> 00:57:59,500
Just what on earth is
the letter about, Father?

661
00:58:00,873 --> 00:58:05,407
What is it that it's making you
so nervous like this?

662
00:58:08,088 --> 00:58:09,776
Father.

663
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:17,557
Your Majesty!

664
00:58:21,733 --> 00:58:23,481
Your Majesty.

665
00:58:23,483 --> 00:58:25,541
Your Majesty!

666
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:29,775
How dare they! Those damn barbarians!

667
00:58:29,776 --> 00:58:33,355
Sir, then you mean...

668
00:58:33,356 --> 00:58:37,099
The one thing we're afraid of
is coming to fruition.

669
00:58:37,101 --> 00:58:41,297
The Khan's true ambition
is being revealed.

670
00:58:47,461 --> 00:58:50,027
I heard you two were here.

671
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:52,961
- We need to talk...
- Princess Jungmyung.

672
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:54,785
Princess Jungmyung.

673
00:58:56,088 --> 00:58:58,164
What is the matter?

674
00:58:58,733 --> 00:59:00,956
Did something happen?

675
00:59:06,454 --> 00:59:11,517
Your Highness,
what should we do about this?

676
00:59:19,802 --> 00:59:22,498
Where is that letter the Khan has sent?

677
00:59:22,499 --> 00:59:24,021
Father!

678
00:59:34,941 --> 00:59:37,365
- Father.
- Your Majesty.

679
00:59:37,979 --> 00:59:43,581
What is this, Crown Prince?
What are these barbarians talking about?

680
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:48,026
They want us to be under their rule now?

681
00:59:48,027 --> 00:59:53,135
And they want me to call
that bastard my king?

682
00:59:55,302 --> 00:59:59,253
Also... what is this?

683
00:59:59,253 --> 01:00:04,534
They want the Joseon army to join theirs?

684
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:15,943
Sir, then that means...

685
01:00:15,943 --> 01:00:19,007
Yes, that is correct, Ma'am.

686
01:00:19,008 --> 01:00:22,644
It's a declaration to Joseon
to cut off all ties with the Ming dynasty.

687
01:00:26,097 --> 01:00:29,751
But, Joseon cannot do that.

688
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:33,708
How can the royal family
and officials do that?

689
01:00:33,709 --> 01:00:38,943
That is why this should be considered
another act of war, Princess.

690
01:00:41,249 --> 01:00:45,494
Yes, this is a second declaration of war.

691
01:01:15,429 --> 01:01:25,429

692
01:01:30,465 --> 01:01:35,173
Later Jin is full of confidence now.

693
01:01:35,175 --> 01:01:38,936
They plan on conquering Joseon.

694
01:01:38,938 --> 01:01:41,443
Ultimately, the Crown Prince
must get involved.

695
01:01:41,445 --> 01:01:43,617
He must greet the Later Jin's party.

696
01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:47,191
Both of them will get into trouble.
You must stop the Crown Prince.

697
01:01:47,192 --> 01:01:52,469
When the country is in turmoil, shouldn't
our family prepare the next king?

698
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:55,396
The Crown Prince.
The Crown Prince, you say?

699
01:01:55,398 --> 01:01:59,096
I'm telling you what you need to do now.

700
01:01:59,097 --> 01:02:01,410
That war is going to happen again.

701
01:02:01,411 --> 01:02:04,137
That is why it breaks my heart more

702
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,862
because I have to go
against my father's will.
