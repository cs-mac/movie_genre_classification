1
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,480
Jerusalem will be swarming with pilgrims
getting ready for the Passover.

2
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,680
Will he go straight to the city?

3
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,400
He said that he would be
put to death there.

4
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,600
And that he would rise again.

5
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,720
Master, master!

6
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,440
Martha and Mary, the sisters of
your friend in Bethany

7
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,000
have sent me here to find you.
Lazarus is very ill, near death.

8
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,120
Go. Tell them I'll be there

9
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,800
- Master, master! He's coming
- Master! Martha's coming

10
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,640
He's arriving!

11
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,360
My Lord.

12
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,440
Lord.

13
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:37,440
If you had been with us,
my brother would not have died.

14
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:44,440
But I know that even now, whatever you
ask of God, God will give it to you,

15
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,360
because I believe you are the Christ,
the son of God.

16
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,080
He who has come into the world
to give us eternal life

17
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,680
Where do you live?

18
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,520
Come and see.

19
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,160
Lord. Lord.

20
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,160
I prayed and prayed for you
to arrive.

21
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,600
You could have kept Lazarus
from dying.

22
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,040
Take away the stone

23
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,800
But he's been dead four days master.
His body must already be decaying!

24
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,400
Take away the stone.

25
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,360
Give me a hand!

26
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:58,960
Father, thank you for hearing my prayer.

27
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,480
Now those who stand round me may believe

28
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,240
that I am resurrection and the life.

29
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:19,040
And those who believe in me
shall never die.

30
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,200
I went down into the countries
underneath the earth,

31
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,560
to the people's of the past,

32
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:55,360
but you lifted my life from the pit,
Lord, my God.

33
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,920
Lazarus! Come forth!

34
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:59,000
He that believes in me, but he were
dead, yet shall he live.

35
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,960
Too much, too much! Keep it! Ah!
He always complains!

36
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,280
Give your sheep.

37
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,560
Give your sheep.

38
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,960
Thank you!

39
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,400
Lord our god, the Lord is one.

40
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,960
It is that thou art the Lord, our God,
the God of our fathers.

41
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,600
Save your life Father, I'll save you-

42
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,440
Here are the documents you
wished to see, master Zerah.

43
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,040
Thank you.

44
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,720
And I am extremely flattered that you
wished to see me, but why may I ask?

45
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,520
Master Zerah, with respect,

46
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:39,680
there are many people in Israel who feel that your
influence in the Sanhedrin offers great hope for the future,

47
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,200
and I can think of no better introduction
to the high priest, Lord Caiaphus.

48
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,000
Well, since you know so much about me, then you won't
be surprised that we know about your rabbi from Nazareth.

49
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,040
Miracles. Raising the dead extraordinary.

50
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,960
No, I wish that my duties give me
time to see your Jesus myself.

51
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:10,440
I wish you had, then you would need no persuading
that he is the only man that can bring peace to Israel.

52
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,360
- What?
- Well, the zealots know it and so-

53
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,240
So, you might be surprised to learn,
do your temple guards.

54
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:27,880
Romans, they're faithfully practical, they would welcome
any body who can bring peace, and if it was a peace
that cost him nothing,

55
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,040
so much the better.

56
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,520
The Sanhedrin should proclaim Jesus
king ofJudea, and tell the Romans-

57
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,600
What? "Look Caesar, we have a new
ruler, one from the royal house of David.

58
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,680
One in whom we have every confidence, who
preaches peace, tolerance and love even to you Romans,

59
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,840
therefore you can calmly withdraw
your troops. We no longer need them"?

60
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,800
You actually put it very well.

61
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,320
I would have to put it very well indeed for the Romans
to take away their troops and their procurates,

62
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,120
not to mention their tax collectors.

63
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,080
I was told of your wit, and this is
hardly the time for it.

64
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,560
Alright.

65
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
You and I should not quarrel.

66
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,480
What do you want me to do?

67
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,120
Let Jesus of Nazareth prove himself
before the Sanhedrin.

68
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,160
I think I can promise you that
he shall have that opportunity.

69
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,720
Rabbi, Many days see to you.

70
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,920
Please, Jesus save me.

71
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,280
Welcome to our city!

72
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,240
Hail Jesus!

73
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,880
He raised Lazarus from the dead!

74
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,720
- Who is this Jesus ofNazareth?
- He's a prophet, a great prophet.

75
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,920
A prophet, on a donkey?

76
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:26,120
I saw you with Jerusalem's daughters.
Behold thy king!

77
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,600
Son of David! Master,
you are the hope of Israel.

78
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,440
You are our prophet and our savior!

79
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,000
Jesus has come to save us!

80
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,880
Hosanna! Hosanna!

81
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:07,440
Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna!

82
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,440
You cannot buy anything in our
temples with Roman money,

83
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,320
you must change it for our
sheckles, you know that!

84
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,760
- But it's cheap!
- Well if you don't like it-

85
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,800
...You are turning the house of our
lord into a market place! It's a shame!

86
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,080
That much?

87
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,480
Don't tell.

88
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,520
It's some rate that all the
other saucer, dear friend.

89
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,800
It's come true ten-

90
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,640
Take two instead of one
they are all greatfull.

91
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,840
Who fight with lambs.
Who fight with lambs.

92
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,600
Jerusalem, the faithful city.

93
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,760
She that was full ofjustice,
has become a harlot!

94
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,040
Stop him! Have you gone mad?
Have you not heard?

95
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,360
What are your multitude of
sacrifices to me, says the Lord?

96
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,240
Bring forth no more vain offerings!"

97
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,720
Look at my money! Thieves!

98
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,960
This is a house of prayer,

99
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,480
and you have turned it
into a den of thieves!

100
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,840
Stop!

101
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:32,120
Rabbi, my name is Zerah.
I'm a scribe of this holy place.

102
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,920
And I, like my brethren, have followed
your mission with great interest.

103
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,160
We have heard good things about
you, and are glad,

104
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,200
but what you have done today
shocks and surprises us.

105
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,440
Do you wish to destroy
this sacred temple?

106
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,960
Atemple is not merely of stone.
It is a house of God.

107
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,960
It cannot be destroyed as long as
God lives here.

108
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:20,200
Destroy this temple, and in three
days, I will make it rise again.

109
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:31,520
It took centuries to build this temple,
and you think you can build it in three days?

110
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,640
You said it,

111
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,320
but you have not understood.

112
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:54,200
Rabbi, I understand better than
you think.

113
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:10,480
Master That scribe had every intention of greeting you
in a friendly manner. He wanted to understand your mission.

114
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,920
Was it wise to discourage him?

115
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,520
He has one of the most open minds
in the Sanhedrin.

116
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,120
Open your heart,
Judas Not your mind.

117
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,360
Open your eyes and your heart.

118
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,480
Master Zerah! Master Zerah!

119
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,440
Ah, My dearJudas!

120
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,920
You're quite right. Your master
has very little political sense.

121
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,360
But he is an extraordinary man

122
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,760
and we shall continue to watch is
mission with great interest.

123
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,000
He's there.

124
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,640
Master I am Barrabas, a zealot.

125
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:27,240
Before he was murdered,
Amos sent word to us, "Trust you."

126
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,040
My brothers are ready.

127
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,240
Some of them are temple guards.

128
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,840
Our day of revenge against
the Romans has come.

129
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,720
Everyday their grip becomes tighter.
Our people have become used to oppression.

130
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,120
With you to lead them,
and with our swords behind you,

131
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,760
they will rise up,
we can teach them to fight.

132
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,320
Some of the priests of Sagisis
have said "Obey the laws of Caesar.

133
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,120
They do not speak for
the Jewish people.

134
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,640
Tell us what to do,
whatever you say we will follow you.

135
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,680
Then love your enemies

136
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,560
and forgive those who use
and persecute you.

137
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,680
The day of forgiveness is at hand.

138
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,160
Forgive Herod?

139
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,120
Forgive the Romans?

140
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,960
Forgive them all.

141
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:35,320
But the, the Romans have butchered hundreds
of innocent people, young people, old people,
lives ended without mercy, without trial.

142
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,840
Surely you can't mean to
forgive that, master?

143
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,400
We should fight the sword
with the sword.

144
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,360
All who take out the sword
shall perish by the sword!

145
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,200
But we must end the
weeping in Israel!

146
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:53,880
Barrabas
Your zeal blinds you to the truth.

147
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,960
The new Jerusalem will not
build up by murder and uprising.

148
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,320
If we still have god we'll fill
the land as water fills the sea.

149
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,880
The lion will lie down to the lamb.

150
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,440
There will be no more killing
or destroying

151
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,640
and the voice of weeping
shall be heard no more.

152
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,920
While we wait for that day to come,
our people live in mourning and lamentation.

153
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,000
Barrabas,

154
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,920
you wish to follow me.

155
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,320
I have come to take on my
shoulders the sins of the world.

156
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,080
You who'd follow me must
be willing to do the same.

157
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,080
Oh no.

158
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,400
Barrabas!

159
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,360
I'm sorry if I disturb you, Rabbi

160
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,600
But I would like to ask
you a great favor.

161
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,840
I have servant in my house.
I've had him a long while,

162
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,800
and he's good. Love him more
like a son than a servant.

163
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,040
He's very sick, dying I fear.

164
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,720
Rabbi, in all humility...

165
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,080
You would like me to
come to your house.

166
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,640
Very well, I will come with you.

167
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,280
No. I am unworthy that
you should enter unto my roof.

168
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,000
I know that if you say the word,
my servant will be healed.

169
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,120
I am a man under authority,

170
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,400
but I myself have authority over a hundred
soldiers and if I say to one of them,

171
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,200
do this, I know that he will do it

172
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:56,000
and if I say to another go there
I know that he will go.

173
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,640
I need not see, I know.

174
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,040
So it is enough that you give
the word, and it will be done.

175
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,320
Do you hear this man?

176
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,680
I have seldom found such faith
among the people of Israel.

177
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:25,880
Go home, your faith has
cured your servant.

178
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,820
So he's a friend of the Romans.

179
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,680
Theseus! Theseus!

180
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,360
The Romans are right! Marcus
is well, your servant is cured!

181
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,720
- What?
- Come on

182
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,160
Come on! Come and see for yourself.
I can't believe my eyes! He's cured!

183
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,200
Come on! Come to your house!

184
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:42,800
Master! Master! Here he is! Here
he is! Over here! The master is here!

185
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,440
Stop it! Leave me alone!

186
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,440
He does too well as a blind figure!

187
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,200
He knows if he could see,
no one would give him anything.

188
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,440
Leave me alone! Don't touch me!

189
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,480
Don't touch me, I say!

190
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,320
Master, that man was born blind. If he has
accepted that's the way it is, then why change it?

191
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,840
He lives in darkness.

192
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,340
And as long as I am in the world,

193
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,420
I am the light of the world.

194
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,580
No! Don't! Leave my eyes alone!
I don't want you to touch them!

195
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,140
No, don't touch my eyes!

196
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:26,740
You are hurting me! They're burning!

197
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,860
What have you done to them?
What have you put on them?

198
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,340
Go and wash his eyes.

199
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,380
Come on, Let's take him. Come on.
Make way! Make way!

200
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:42,100
Come with us and see!
The master has cured the blind man!

201
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,420
Can he see? We're not through yet!
Give him a bath!

202
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,260
He hasn't touched water all his life!

203
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,700
Give them a good wash!

204
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,900
I can see!

205
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,740
I am not blind anymore!

206
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,180
I can see you!

207
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,660
And you!

208
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,860
I can see! Brothers!

209
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,380
Brothers!

210
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,340
I am not blind anymore.

211
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,180
I can see everything!

212
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,140
Now I know what it means to see!

213
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,140
It's a miracle!!

214
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,980
I can see the world!
My eyes can see!

215
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:01,980
Brothers! I can see all of you!
All of you!

216
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,140
Where is he?

217
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,500
Where is he? Where is he?

218
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,120
Master

219
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,840
I can see.

220
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,080
I can see.

221
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,360
Do you believe in the son of man?

222
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:56,800
Who is he master,
that I may believe in him.

223
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:03,600
You're seeing him.
It is he that is speaking to you.

224
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,600
I believe. Lord.

225
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,120
Make way, make way there!

226
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,000
Make way, the priest is coming!

227
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,680
Out of the way! Habbukuk is here!

228
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,520
This lying cheat was never blind.

229
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,920
We at the temple know that he was
only pretending to be blind to earn his living!

230
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,360
He's right, he's a liar.

231
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,080
I've know him a long time,
he's never been blind!

232
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,880
And what's your story?
That you can give sight to the blind?

233
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:45,160
I came into this world to give sight
to those who cannot see.

234
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,720
And to take away sight from
those who can.

235
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:57,080
What do you mean by that?
That we who are righteous are blind?

236
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:04,520
If you were blind,
you would be without sin,

237
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:13,040
but since you say "We see",
your sin remains.

238
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,880
This man works for the devil!

239
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,240
Cheat!

240
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,840
Woe to you scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites all!

241
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,440
When you shut off the kingdom of
heaven against men,

242
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,520
you do not join yourselves,
nor do you let others enter.

243
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,280
Blind guides.

244
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,640
You are stray and inept,
and swallow camel.

245
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:55,880
You bow before the letter of the law,
and violate the heart of the law

246
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,880
justice! Mercy! Good faith.

247
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:06,880
You are like white washed tombs,
all fair and clean without,

248
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,760
but within full of death
and bones and all corruption.

249
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,960
You see these stones, do you not?

250
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:23,760
I tell you there will not be left here one
stone upon another that will not be throne down.

251
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,280
Yours is a house of damnation,

252
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,600
the home of the ligard and spider.

253
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,320
Serpents through their vipers.

254
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,040
How can any of you escape damnation?

255
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,720
You shall not see me here again,
not until you learn to cry,

256
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,440
"Blessed is he who comes
in the name of the Lord,

257
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,200
for I and my Father are one
and the same."

258
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,480
He is a blasphemer!

259
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,200
This is the man!

260
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,520
You don't speak for
the people of Israel!

261
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,800
Listen to the teachings of our God!

262
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,000
He should be stoned to death!

263
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,240
He's a blasphemer!

264
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,280
Wonder what's going on?

265
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,000
I don't like it, I'll take a look.

266
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,680
- Look after, stand, will you?
- All right

267
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,800
Caspar!

268
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,320
A righteous man. A righteous man.

269
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,160
Kill the Romans!

270
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,080
Come on!

271
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,760
He's not the messiah!
He's a false prophet.

272
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,040
He a friend of the Romans!

273
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,080
Stone him! Stone him! Stone him!

274
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,360
Traitor! Traitor to Israel!

275
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,280
Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!

276
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,480
He speaks the truth!

277
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:38,240
Stone him to death!
Stone him to death!

278
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,320
Peter!

279
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,400
If you please,
I've come to offer my help.

280
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,560
Master Nicodemus.

281
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,440
Yes, I must advise you.
You are in danger.

282
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,920
Please persuade your master to
keep away from public places.

283
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,080
God must have sent you,
master Nicodemus. You speak to him.

284
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,160
Of all people,
he will listen to you. Come.

285
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,080
Master!

286
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,200
Rabbi.

287
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,040
There is to be a meeting
at the Sanhedrin.

288
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,720
You have many enemies there,

289
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:06,720
but also friends who know that
you are a teacher come from God,

290
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:12,920
for no man that shows the signs
or has the words that you impart,

291
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,960
unless God giveth them.

292
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:23,680
And yet, my heart is troubled,
and my mind confused.

293
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,320
You must help me to see the truth.

294
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,000
Accept the man to be born again,
Nicodemus.

295
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,800
He cannot see the kingdom of God.

296
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,680
Born again?

297
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,800
Can a man enter his mother's
womb the second time?

298
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,680
That which is born of the
flesh is flesh.

299
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,360
That which is born of
the spirit is spirit.

300
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,680
Do not marvel that I said to you,
"You must be born again."

301
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:14,320
The wind blows where it will,
and you hear the sound of it,

302
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,880
but you don't know whence
it comes or whether it goes.

303
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,520
And so it is with everyone
who is born with the spirit.

304
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:31,080
God so loved the world that
he sent his own son,

305
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:36,000
that whosoever believed in him
should not perish, but have eternal life.

306
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,480
God sent his son to the world
not to condemn it,

307
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,320
but that the world should
be saved through him.

308
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,680
He came to Jerusalem. The crowd
went wild for his arrival and we did nothing!

309
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:05,960
He then scolded the merchants, so they
sent us beasts for sacrifice from the courtyard
to the temple and we did not intervene!

310
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,760
How many times have we protested that the disgrace
of buy traders being allowed in the precincts of the temple?

311
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,520
But then we allowed him to preach
in the holy temple itself, and at no time,

312
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,240
no time did he recognize
your authority, Caiaphus,

313
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,600
nor made sufficient
to the elders of Israel.

314
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,640
We must denounce him
in the name of the people of Israel!

315
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:33,120
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure that we have that right.

316
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:39,400
Can we honestly say that we represent the
true thoughts and aspirations of the people of Israel?

317
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,280
What are you saying?

318
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:46,120
I've often wondered if we, as elders are
too cut off from them and their real problems.

319
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,880
How can we guide them if we do not
know what's in their hearts?

320
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,200
But without our guidance
they would be lost!

321
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,800
People, people will run after
any new thing.

322
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,280
They have taken up with this man,
with his hijinx and his exaggerated promises.

323
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,960
I have seen him,
I have seen him preach.

324
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,120
His words reach into men's hearts,
not like ours.

325
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:14,440
It's not through the old rituals, the old formulas,
but a new vision which seems to answer all their hopes.

326
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:20,760
A message of comfort, of goodness, of purity,
of the virtues of humility.

327
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,240
We've heard it all before, from the John
the Baptist and hundreds of others.

328
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,520
Yes, how's those who follow
to hate him as the Messiah?

329
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,360
He's a blasphemer! He's an imposter!

330
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,960
With respect to those more learned
than I, there is one possibility

331
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,320
that it seems no one
here is ready to consider...

332
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,640
What is it?

333
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:52,280
The possibility that
Jesus of Nazareth

334
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:57,480
may be in fact be the messiah
awaited by our people.

335
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,560
A carpenter from Galilee?

336
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:09,280
suddenly, he never misses a chance
to identify himself with them.

337
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,280
Exactly!

338
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:17,080
I only know that like our brother
Joseph, I've heard him preach.

339
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:22,160
I was moved lifted out of my soul,

340
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:28,320
and seemed to see all things
in a new and blinding light.

341
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:37,360
I was aware of wonders, signs
that God may be with him,

342
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,920
and through him, with us.

343
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,800
Do you realize what you are
saying, Master Nicodemus?

344
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,160
Let him speak!

345
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,320
Listen to him! Let him speak!
Don't shut him down!

346
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,400
The coming of the messiah
is the heart of our faith.

347
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,720
Why should he not come now?

348
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:04,200
Why do we dream our liberator will be
revealed in glory, a new Solomon, a new David?

349
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,400
Is God not allowed to choose
who he wishes?

350
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,280
Even the son of a poor carpenter
from Nazareth?

351
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,440
David began life as a shepherd.

352
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:17,360
Who are we to decide the way in which
God should choose to help his people?

353
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:23,720
We are grains of sand,
chalk blown in the wind.

354
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,240
May the Lord open our
eyes to his wisdom.

355
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:34,580
Master Nicodemus,
I have always respected you.

356
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:39,420
How am I to understand your
defense of this man,

357
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,260
whose missions seems to be
to divide our people?

358
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:49,740
Even this noble assembly
has been torn asunder by him.

359
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:56,740
This Jesus of Nazareth must be
an extraordinary man.

360
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:04,060
But is there not one among you who
understands the the real significance of this matter.

361
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:09,780
It is not the Galilean's words that are important.
The so called miracles,

362
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:15,780
even the fact the frenzied crowds hail
him as the messiah, it's not important.

363
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:26,740
The central core of this case is
that this man dares to proclaim...

364
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:31,100
I can hardly make myself say it.

365
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:37,660
This man dares to proclaim himself

366
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:43,020
the, the son of God.

367
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:52,860
This man, while claiming to
uphold the law,

368
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:59,060
perverts our most fundamental beliefs.

369
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:12,620
Our losses, the prophets who claims
to say in the name of God things

370
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:19,100
which God has not commanded,
that prophet must die.

371
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:27,220
if this man Jesus is a false prophet
and a blasphemer,

372
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:33,700
is it not better for one man to die,
than a for a whole nation to perish?

373
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,580
However, under Roman occupation,
Caiaphus,

374
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:44,540
the people of Israel may put a goat to
death, but not a man.

375
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:49,460
Thank you, Zerah for reminding
us of our realities.

376
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:57,180
Then he must be charged and
found guilty by the Romans.

377
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,700
But Caiaphus,
we have not found him guilty yet!

378
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:05,420
Surely our law does not condemn a man before
first giving him hearing before the elders of Israel?

379
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:10,900
No matter how serious his offense, we cannot
simply hand over one of our brothers to the Romans.

380
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:16,820
Caiaphus, after the Passover let me
persuade Jesus to come to us and explain to us

381
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:21,260
what is in his heart and his mind
when he says he is the son of God.

382
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,360
No!

383
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,000
Caiaphus to delay would be
too dangerous.

384
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:31,040
We all know what steps Pilate would
take against our people if the unrest continues.

385
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,400
Zerah, he must beaken tonight.

386
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:39,320
It could cause even more trouble among the
crowds if our temple guards go searching for him.

387
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:44,700
I think I know the way to reach him.

388
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:54,020
Zerah, don't forget Jesus of Nazareth
is one of our brothers.

389
00:55:05,021 --> 00:55:05,976
Judas?

390
00:55:06,101 --> 00:55:10,777
I've not been able to find you. You weren't
seen with the Master for the Iast few days.

391
00:55:10,901 --> 00:55:12,857
Where have you been?

392
00:55:15,421 --> 00:55:17,377
I've been trying to think.

393
00:55:22,581 --> 00:55:24,537
Trying to decide what to do.

394
00:55:24,661 --> 00:55:26,891
You seemed to be very sure of what to do.

395
00:55:27,021 --> 00:55:28,977
Oh, I was.

396
00:55:31,781 --> 00:55:33,737
But not now.

397
00:55:35,181 --> 00:55:37,137
I'm confused.

398
00:55:39,101 --> 00:55:42,059
l always believed action - political action -

399
00:55:42,941 --> 00:55:44,897
..would solve everything.

400
00:55:45,021 --> 00:55:50,220
l thought it was enough
to think clearly and act clearly, but...

401
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:55,297
But I fear my...

402
00:55:55,661 --> 00:55:57,617
..Master does not agree with me.

403
00:56:00,381 --> 00:56:04,613
He doesn't need my ideas.
He says the heart is more important.

404
00:56:07,461 --> 00:56:09,417
Perhaps he's right.

405
00:56:10,621 --> 00:56:12,577
Have I hardened my heart?

406
00:56:13,581 --> 00:56:16,141
Am l fit to be one of his disciples?

407
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:20,456
I...

408
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:25,937
l should go home.

409
00:56:28,341 --> 00:56:30,297
Judas, don't lie to yourself.

410
00:56:33,701 --> 00:56:35,817
The truth is that, in your heart,...

411
00:56:36,741 --> 00:56:40,097
..you no longer believe
that Jesus of Nazareth...

412
00:56:40,221 --> 00:56:42,291
..is the Messiah.

413
00:57:01,261 --> 00:57:04,094
There's only one way to know the truth.

414
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:07,611
You knew that the very first time
that you came to see me.

415
00:57:08,901 --> 00:57:12,211
Let Jesus prove himself...

416
00:57:13,061 --> 00:57:15,017
..before the Sanhedrin.

417
00:57:15,981 --> 00:57:17,937
lt's too late.

418
00:57:20,141 --> 00:57:22,097
He won't accept it.

419
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,300
Why?

420
00:57:28,421 --> 00:57:33,017
There are many influential members
of the council who admire Jesus.

421
00:57:33,141 --> 00:57:35,291
He would be fairly judged.

422
00:57:36,421 --> 00:57:39,219
lf he is the Messiah,
God will not abandon him.

423
00:57:41,141 --> 00:57:43,097
If he is not,...

424
00:57:43,741 --> 00:57:48,132
..then you will have helped to save lsrael
from yet another false prophet.

425
00:58:42,781 --> 00:58:46,217
~ Alleluia!

426
00:58:52,661 --> 00:58:55,221
We are happy to eat
this Passover with you.

427
00:58:57,341 --> 00:59:00,413
l have longed with all my heart
to share it with you.

428
00:59:09,901 --> 00:59:12,973
lt was for this Passover
that l came into the world.

429
00:59:29,261 --> 00:59:31,821
I shall not be with you much longer.

430
00:59:31,941 --> 00:59:33,897
What?!

431
00:59:35,341 --> 00:59:37,332
You will look for me, but...

432
00:59:37,461 --> 00:59:39,497
..where I am going you cannot come.

433
00:59:44,221 --> 00:59:46,781
Master, l will follow you wherever you go.

434
00:59:48,061 --> 00:59:50,017
l will lay down my life for you.

435
00:59:51,781 --> 00:59:53,339
Peter,...

436
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:58,219
..this very night
before the cock crows twice...

437
00:59:59,781 --> 01:00:03,012
..you will have denied three times
that you even know me.

438
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,972
Oh, my Lord! Never!

439
01:00:14,901 --> 01:00:16,459
Never!

440
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:19,657
l will never deny you.

441
01:00:22,981 --> 01:00:24,937
You will all lose faith.

442
01:00:28,221 --> 01:00:31,896
The shepherd shall be struck
and the sheep will be scattered.

443
01:00:31,981 --> 01:00:35,735
- l will not lose faith!
- Peter... Peter...

444
01:00:38,381 --> 01:00:40,337
I have prayed for you,...

445
01:00:42,581 --> 01:00:45,220
..and, once you have recovered,...

446
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:48,890
..you in your turn
must give strength to your brothers.

447
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:06,497
Truly l tell you...

448
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:10,497
..one of you is about to betray me.

449
01:01:38,581 --> 01:01:40,537
Master,...

450
01:01:42,101 --> 01:01:44,057
..I'm sick at heart.

451
01:01:45,261 --> 01:01:47,217
Who will betray you?

452
01:01:48,061 --> 01:01:50,017
Is it I?

453
01:01:53,781 --> 01:01:56,853
He who dips his bread in the dish
when I dip mine,...

454
01:01:59,501 --> 01:02:01,457
..he shall be the one.

455
01:02:30,901 --> 01:02:33,131
What you are going to do,...

456
01:02:33,261 --> 01:02:35,217
..do it quickly.

457
01:03:03,261 --> 01:03:05,217
Where's he going?

458
01:03:07,261 --> 01:03:09,217
I don't know.

459
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:37,977
Blessed be thou, O Lord our God,...

460
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:44,096
..who has blessed us with thy Laws,...

461
01:03:45,861 --> 01:03:48,421
..and made bread issue from the earth.

462
01:03:50,021 --> 01:03:51,977
From now on...

463
01:03:58,301 --> 01:04:03,295
..this will not be the bread of the passage
of our fathers from bondage to freedom.

464
01:04:05,061 --> 01:04:07,017
This Passover...

465
01:04:08,661 --> 01:04:10,617
..is for you today...

466
01:04:13,261 --> 01:04:15,900
..the passage from the bondage of death...

467
01:04:19,781 --> 01:04:23,330
..to the freedom of life.

468
01:04:36,261 --> 01:04:38,217
This is the bread of life.

469
01:04:46,861 --> 01:04:48,817
Whoever eats of this bread...

470
01:04:49,141 --> 01:04:51,097
..shall have eternal life.

471
01:05:16,461 --> 01:05:18,019
Eat it,...

472
01:05:20,821 --> 01:05:22,379
..for this...

473
01:05:23,221 --> 01:05:25,177
..is my body.

474
01:05:27,861 --> 01:05:30,056
Do this in remembrance of me.

475
01:06:01,581 --> 01:06:03,537
From now on...

476
01:06:03,661 --> 01:06:07,290
..this cup will not only be
a memorial and sacrament...

477
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:11,016
..of the covenant God made
with our fathers on Mount Sinai.

478
01:06:16,901 --> 01:06:18,857
This is my blood,...

479
01:06:19,901 --> 01:06:23,974
..the blood of the new covenant,
which is to be poured out for many.

480
01:06:31,501 --> 01:06:34,573
l shall not drink again
of the fruit of the vine...

481
01:06:38,581 --> 01:06:40,856
..until the day l drink it with you...

482
01:06:44,621 --> 01:06:46,976
..in my Father's kingdom.

483
01:07:12,341 --> 01:07:14,730
And now I give you
a new commandment,...

484
01:07:17,141 --> 01:07:20,019
..that you love one another
as l have loved you.

485
01:07:24,101 --> 01:07:26,217
Greater love hath no man than this,...

486
01:07:29,021 --> 01:07:32,172
..that a man lay down his life for a friend.

487
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:39,377
And if you love one another...

488
01:07:42,581 --> 01:07:45,459
..all men shall know that
you are my disciples.

489
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:57,657
Father,...

490
01:08:00,261 --> 01:08:02,217
..the hour has come.

491
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:07,339
Glorify thy Son
that thy Son may glorify thee.

492
01:08:11,141 --> 01:08:13,609
Keep in thy name
those thou hast given me.

493
01:08:17,461 --> 01:08:19,417
l do not pray for these only...

494
01:08:21,861 --> 01:08:23,817
..but also for those...

495
01:08:25,221 --> 01:08:27,781
..who believe in me through their word.

496
01:08:44,141 --> 01:08:45,699
I am the way,...

497
01:08:49,141 --> 01:08:50,699
..the truth,...

498
01:08:53,981 --> 01:08:55,539
..and the life.

499
01:09:36,901 --> 01:09:38,857
Peter!

500
01:09:44,261 --> 01:09:45,819
Father,...

501
01:09:46,501 --> 01:09:48,457
..if it is possible,...

502
01:09:49,621 --> 01:09:51,577
..let this cup pass from me.

503
01:10:06,061 --> 01:10:08,017
Let it be...

504
01:10:09,741 --> 01:10:11,697
..as you,...

505
01:10:12,621 --> 01:10:14,577
..not l, would have it.

506
01:10:17,461 --> 01:10:19,417
(distant howling)

507
01:10:23,461 --> 01:10:25,417
(barking)

508
01:11:39,621 --> 01:11:41,577
This is your hour, Judas.

509
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:46,976
The hour of shadows.

510
01:11:51,021 --> 01:11:52,977
Oh, Master.

511
01:12:04,021 --> 01:12:05,977
You betray your master...

512
01:12:06,981 --> 01:12:08,937
..with a kiss.

513
01:12:19,581 --> 01:12:21,537
That is the man. Arrest him.

514
01:12:23,941 --> 01:12:26,136
Quiet. Don't make any noise.

515
01:12:27,941 --> 01:12:30,330
You go that way.

516
01:12:30,461 --> 01:12:32,417
Try not to wake them.

517
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:35,215
Judas!

518
01:12:36,021 --> 01:12:37,852
What's happening?

519
01:12:37,981 --> 01:12:40,256
You traitor!

520
01:12:40,381 --> 01:12:42,497
You betrayed him!

521
01:12:42,621 --> 01:12:48,139
Peter, the only way the Master can save
himself is by speaking to the Sanhedrin!

522
01:12:48,261 --> 01:12:51,492
Leave him alone! Let him go!

523
01:12:51,621 --> 01:12:53,213
They'll kill him!

524
01:12:53,341 --> 01:12:54,899
Jesus!

525
01:12:55,021 --> 01:12:56,090
Andrew!

526
01:12:56,221 --> 01:12:57,620
John!

527
01:12:57,741 --> 01:12:59,777
Jesus!

528
01:12:59,901 --> 01:13:01,254
No, Peter!

529
01:13:03,261 --> 01:13:04,933
Get away, scum!

530
01:13:05,061 --> 01:13:06,892
- Arrest them all!
- Zerah!

531
01:13:07,021 --> 01:13:08,977
It was me you sought.

532
01:13:09,901 --> 01:13:12,461
You have found me. Let them go.

533
01:13:15,021 --> 01:13:16,977
Take him away!

534
01:13:17,621 --> 01:13:19,816
Take him to the Sanhedrin!

535
01:13:19,941 --> 01:13:21,897
We must do something!

536
01:13:25,261 --> 01:13:26,819
No!

537
01:13:27,621 --> 01:13:30,374
We must do something for him!

538
01:13:30,501 --> 01:13:32,571
Brothers, better save ourselves!

539
01:13:58,821 --> 01:14:01,733
Where did they take him?
Where have they taken him?!

540
01:14:01,861 --> 01:14:05,012
- He's the one who got the soldiers.
- Zerah...

541
01:14:05,901 --> 01:14:07,380
Zerah...

542
01:14:07,501 --> 01:14:09,059
Zerah.

543
01:14:09,861 --> 01:14:12,694
I must speak to Zerah.
I must speak to Zerah!

544
01:14:12,821 --> 01:14:15,210
Is he in here? Did they bring him here?

545
01:14:15,341 --> 01:14:16,854
Who?

546
01:14:16,981 --> 01:14:18,937
Jesus!

547
01:14:19,181 --> 01:14:21,137
Master Zerah, please,...

548
01:14:21,261 --> 01:14:23,252
..I don't understand this man.

549
01:14:23,381 --> 01:14:25,531
- Zerah... Zerah...
- Yes?

550
01:14:26,581 --> 01:14:30,290
Where is this meeting with Caiaphas?
I must be there with Jesus!

551
01:14:30,421 --> 01:14:31,649
Meeting?

552
01:14:31,781 --> 01:14:33,214
There's no meeting.

553
01:14:33,341 --> 01:14:34,694
What?

554
01:14:35,381 --> 01:14:37,337
There's a trial.

555
01:14:37,461 --> 01:14:40,021
Your Jesus is accused of blasphemy.

556
01:14:46,861 --> 01:14:50,058
You've been an invaluable
help to us, Judas.

557
01:14:50,181 --> 01:14:52,775
Come and see me when all this is over.

558
01:14:55,981 --> 01:14:56,936
Oh!

559
01:15:10,141 --> 01:15:12,609
Well, you got what you wanted.

560
01:15:13,661 --> 01:15:15,174
So get out of here.

561
01:15:15,301 --> 01:15:17,690
Come on, get out of here, move yourself!

562
01:15:22,021 --> 01:15:26,651
I've never understood how that liar
could have fooled so many people.

563
01:15:26,781 --> 01:15:28,931
You believed in him, didn't you?

564
01:15:29,061 --> 01:15:32,690
Well, l admit l believed in him,
but we all believed in him.

565
01:15:32,821 --> 01:15:36,450
- Now you know the truth!
- He said many things that l liked.

566
01:15:36,581 --> 01:15:38,537
And he did some good things.

567
01:15:38,661 --> 01:15:40,891
Good things?
They were tricks of the devil!

568
01:15:41,021 --> 01:15:45,219
All right! We know that he was a
liar and a blasphemer and he betrayed us.

569
01:15:45,341 --> 01:15:46,820
And now he will pay.

570
01:15:48,221 --> 01:15:51,531
I'm sorry to wake you up,
but they've arrested the Nazarene.

571
01:15:51,661 --> 01:15:55,097
- They did?
- Yes. In the garden of Gethsemane.

572
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:00,574
Master Nicodemus...

573
01:16:21,901 --> 01:16:23,857
Brethren! Brethren!

574
01:16:25,221 --> 01:16:27,291
Brethren!

575
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:32,580
Caiaphas, that he is bound like
a common thief! lt's most unseemly, sir.

576
01:16:35,541 --> 01:16:38,055
Jesus, it is not our intention...

577
01:16:39,101 --> 01:16:41,057
..to treat you as a criminal.

578
01:16:41,181 --> 01:16:42,739
But...

579
01:16:42,861 --> 01:16:46,695
..we want you to explain
to this assembly...

580
01:16:46,821 --> 01:16:48,777
..the nature of your teachings.

581
01:16:48,901 --> 01:16:52,576
What is this doctrine...

582
01:16:52,701 --> 01:16:56,137
..you and your disciples
are spreading through Judaea?

583
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:01,497
l have spoken openly...

584
01:17:03,221 --> 01:17:05,177
..for all the world to hear.

585
01:17:06,821 --> 01:17:09,733
l have taught in the synagogues
and in the Temple.

586
01:17:09,861 --> 01:17:11,817
I have said nothing in secret.

587
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:14,219
So...

588
01:17:15,421 --> 01:17:17,377
..why do you ask me?

589
01:17:20,381 --> 01:17:22,337
Ask those who heard me.

590
01:17:24,021 --> 01:17:26,489
They are my witnesses.

591
01:17:27,861 --> 01:17:28,850
Caiaphas,...

592
01:17:28,981 --> 01:17:30,539
..I have heard him preach.

593
01:17:30,661 --> 01:17:35,451
l find nothing in his doctrine which
denies the basic principles of our faith.

594
01:17:35,581 --> 01:17:39,574
Rabbi, we fail to understand
the meaning of many of your sayings.

595
01:17:39,701 --> 01:17:42,659
For instance,
there are witnesses who say that...

596
01:17:42,781 --> 01:17:45,932
..you claim that
you could destroy the Temple...

597
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:49,656
..and rebuild it in three days!

598
01:17:49,781 --> 01:17:52,853
No-one could rebuild the Temple
in three days.

599
01:17:52,981 --> 01:17:56,132
What he's said must have
some symbolic meaning. Come...

600
01:17:56,261 --> 01:17:58,775
l heard him say
he could rebuild it in two days!

601
01:17:58,901 --> 01:18:01,859
Three days, four days, do you hear?

602
01:18:01,981 --> 01:18:05,735
- Witnesses can't even agree.
- How can we remember every detail?

603
01:18:05,861 --> 01:18:09,570
There was a riot,
which Jesus himself provoked,...

604
01:18:09,701 --> 01:18:12,738
..but for which the Romans
will hold us responsible!

605
01:18:12,861 --> 01:18:14,772
The riot was provoked by Barabbas!

606
01:18:14,901 --> 01:18:18,814
The Romans need no excuse!
We know what they have done to us!

607
01:18:18,941 --> 01:18:20,977
All of us here can remember...

608
01:18:22,021 --> 01:18:24,660
..the occasion, not so many years back,...

609
01:18:26,021 --> 01:18:31,573
..when over a thousand of our people
were nailed to the walls of Jerusalem...

610
01:18:31,661 --> 01:18:37,293
..because there weren't enough scaffolds
to satisfy the Romans' lust for blood!

611
01:18:37,381 --> 01:18:41,533
None of us, I'm sure,
wants to give any more victims...

612
01:18:41,661 --> 01:18:43,970
..to Pontius Pilate... than we can prevent.

613
01:18:44,101 --> 01:18:45,978
Of course not, Joseph.

614
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:50,538
We're all agreed upon that.
As Caiaphas has said, this is not a trial.

615
01:18:50,661 --> 01:18:53,812
We... We left our homes,
we came here tonight,...

616
01:18:53,941 --> 01:18:58,935
..hoping that Jesus of Nazareth would
explain to us the purpose of his mission,...

617
01:18:59,061 --> 01:19:02,212
..and help to heal the divisions
in our community.

618
01:19:02,341 --> 01:19:07,017
Brother, we have often heard that you
have come to bring love and brotherhood.

619
01:19:07,141 --> 01:19:11,851
I beg you,
bring peace to our gathering tonight.

620
01:19:13,341 --> 01:19:15,297
Tell me,...

621
01:19:17,181 --> 01:19:20,332
..it has been said
that you proclaimed yourself...

622
01:19:21,741 --> 01:19:23,697
..the Son of God.

623
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:27,817
I ask you now,...

624
01:19:27,941 --> 01:19:32,776
..in the name of the Eternal,...

625
01:19:35,301 --> 01:19:37,610
..are you...

626
01:19:37,741 --> 01:19:39,971
..the Messiah,...

627
01:19:40,101 --> 01:19:43,298
..the Son of God?

628
01:19:53,541 --> 01:19:54,656
I am.

629
01:19:55,941 --> 01:19:57,897
He must be mad!

630
01:20:12,301 --> 01:20:14,337
And you shall see the Son of Man...

631
01:20:15,581 --> 01:20:19,460
..sitting at the right hand
of the power of God.

632
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:21,572
Hear, O lsrael,...

633
01:20:22,821 --> 01:20:25,130
..the Lord our God,...

634
01:20:26,381 --> 01:20:28,417
..the Lord is one!

635
01:20:41,701 --> 01:20:43,657
We have heard enough.

636
01:20:44,701 --> 01:20:47,852
Let him be taken before
the procurator, Pontius Pilate,...

637
01:20:49,621 --> 01:20:52,419
..in whose hands lies the final authority...

638
01:20:53,341 --> 01:20:55,297
..for trial and judgment.

639
01:21:19,061 --> 01:21:21,097
They got him at last!

640
01:21:21,221 --> 01:21:23,132
Let me get closer!

641
01:21:24,621 --> 01:21:26,976
They should crucify him!

642
01:21:27,101 --> 01:21:29,057
Son of God?!

643
01:21:29,861 --> 01:21:31,374
Kill him!

644
01:21:31,501 --> 01:21:33,219
Stone him!

645
01:21:33,341 --> 01:21:34,694
Blasphemer!

646
01:21:34,821 --> 01:21:36,777
Well, what happened to him?

647
01:21:38,061 --> 01:21:40,939
They're sending him to Pontius Pilate.

648
01:21:41,061 --> 01:21:43,336
We know how that will end up, don't we?

649
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:48,695
Wait a minute! I know you.

650
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:51,176
You were with that Jesus!

651
01:21:51,301 --> 01:21:54,179
- You're one of his followers.
- No, l don't know him.

652
01:21:54,301 --> 01:21:56,053
But he is. Look!

653
01:21:56,181 --> 01:21:59,218
And l know him.
He is one of his followers.

654
01:21:59,341 --> 01:22:02,777
- Yes! I've seen him! I've seen him!
- No!

655
01:22:02,901 --> 01:22:04,857
He's a liar! Arrest him!

656
01:22:05,581 --> 01:22:07,856
l tell you, l don't know him!

657
01:22:09,381 --> 01:22:10,609
Help me!

658
01:22:10,741 --> 01:22:12,333
What's going on?

659
01:22:12,461 --> 01:22:14,531
He's a friend of Jesus, a disciple.

660
01:22:14,661 --> 01:22:16,617
Don't let him go!

661
01:22:17,781 --> 01:22:19,737
Please...

662
01:22:20,781 --> 01:22:22,339
They're mistaken.

663
01:22:22,461 --> 01:22:25,100
I don't know this Jesus they speak of...

664
01:22:25,221 --> 01:22:27,212
..nor have I ever heard of him.

665
01:22:27,341 --> 01:22:30,378
Go! Just keep quiet here!

666
01:22:30,501 --> 01:22:32,890
Don't you know you're on sacred ground?

667
01:23:50,501 --> 01:23:51,980
Free Barabbas!

668
01:23:52,101 --> 01:23:53,659
Set Barabbas free!

669
01:23:54,501 --> 01:23:56,856
- Let Barabbas go!
- He's one of us!

670
01:23:56,981 --> 01:23:58,334
Free Barabbas!

671
01:23:58,461 --> 01:24:01,259
You had no right to arrest him!
Free Barabbas!

672
01:24:11,301 --> 01:24:13,257
- Welcome, Proc...
- Welcome?!

673
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:17,932
I Ieave for one week and I come back to
a mob in the street, and you dare to say...

674
01:24:18,061 --> 01:24:20,017
.."welcome"!

675
01:24:21,981 --> 01:24:23,937
Who's this Barabbas?

676
01:24:24,941 --> 01:24:28,854
He's a Zealot we arrested.
His followers have disturbed the crowds.

677
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:32,212
l don't think their noise
will disturb my judgment.

678
01:24:33,901 --> 01:24:35,414
Look,...

679
01:24:35,541 --> 01:24:38,009
..take a hundred men and clear the street.

680
01:24:38,141 --> 01:24:40,097
I'm tired.

681
01:24:40,581 --> 01:24:42,572
With respect,...

682
01:24:42,701 --> 01:24:45,010
- ..Procurator...
- Please, l'm so tired!

683
01:24:45,141 --> 01:24:47,860
Jerusalem is full of people.
There are many hotheads.

684
01:24:47,981 --> 01:24:52,497
Yes, and they'll cool when they see
the example we make of their Barabbas.

685
01:25:11,101 --> 01:25:13,661
Pontius Pilate,
l'm afraid there's another case.

686
01:25:13,781 --> 01:25:16,739
- Another one?
- Yes, submitted by the Sanhedrin itself.

687
01:25:16,861 --> 01:25:21,059
- lt concerns a Galilean preacher.
- I am not interested in their preachers...

688
01:25:21,181 --> 01:25:23,092
..or their prophets. You know that.

689
01:25:23,221 --> 01:25:25,177
Yes, of course, I know that.

690
01:25:25,701 --> 01:25:30,456
The Sanhedrin, whose co-operation
has been very useful to us,...

691
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:33,613
..consider it extremely important.

692
01:25:35,581 --> 01:25:37,014
Even urgent.

693
01:25:37,141 --> 01:25:39,575
Urgent?! Urgent to whom?!

694
01:25:44,781 --> 01:25:46,339
I'm sorry.

695
01:25:47,101 --> 01:25:48,659
I'm sorry.

696
01:25:49,421 --> 01:25:51,377
Maybe next week.

697
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:54,539
But first...

698
01:25:55,461 --> 01:25:57,417
..we'll deal with Barabbas.

699
01:25:58,781 --> 01:26:02,933
Pilate, there's a delegation
from the Sanhedrin waiting outside.

700
01:26:03,421 --> 01:26:05,491
lt is led by Zerah himself.

701
01:26:05,621 --> 01:26:09,500
They have this preacher,
this Jesus of Nazareth, with them.

702
01:26:09,621 --> 01:26:11,577
They want you to judge him.

703
01:26:11,701 --> 01:26:13,180
Judge him?

704
01:26:13,301 --> 01:26:16,418
Zerah himself? lt must be important.

705
01:26:16,501 --> 01:26:18,457
No. No, no, no.

706
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:21,738
I don't want to get involved
in their religious quarrels.

707
01:26:21,861 --> 01:26:24,819
This is the monthly report of the province.

708
01:26:30,221 --> 01:26:34,214
lt's wise not to offend them unnecessarily.
I think you should see them.

709
01:26:35,421 --> 01:26:37,377
Well, have them brought in.

710
01:26:40,261 --> 01:26:42,172
Don't stand there. Bring them in.

711
01:26:42,301 --> 01:26:47,500
Pilate, I regret... l'm afraid
we must go out to them.

712
01:26:49,181 --> 01:26:50,580
We must go to them?

713
01:26:50,701 --> 01:26:52,657
Yes, according to their...

714
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:55,099
..beliefs...

715
01:26:55,221 --> 01:26:57,974
Well, they cannot
come into a house of a Roman,...

716
01:26:58,101 --> 01:27:00,171
..not on Passover.

717
01:27:00,301 --> 01:27:02,257
They would be defiled.

718
01:27:07,621 --> 01:27:09,179
Defiled.

719
01:27:10,541 --> 01:27:12,497
I forgot about that.

720
01:27:14,221 --> 01:27:15,779
All right.

721
01:27:17,221 --> 01:27:19,177
We'll go to them.

722
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:22,257
Bring them to the Great Hall.

723
01:27:28,301 --> 01:27:31,054
How does one govern such people?

724
01:27:44,301 --> 01:27:45,859
Procurator,...

725
01:27:46,541 --> 01:27:49,738
..we have found that this man,
Jesus of Nazareth,...

726
01:27:49,861 --> 01:27:54,810
..distorts our people's views on the
relationship between God and the state.

727
01:27:54,941 --> 01:27:59,412
Furthermore,
he perverts the very heart of our religion.

728
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:03,461
l'm not concerned with
your religious laws.

729
01:28:03,581 --> 01:28:08,132
My function as governor here is to keep
the peace and administer Roman justice.

730
01:28:08,261 --> 01:28:14,177
We know that, Procurator, but this man
also threatens the established order.

731
01:28:14,301 --> 01:28:17,691
lf he were not a criminal,
we would not have brought him to you.

732
01:28:17,821 --> 01:28:22,133
He calls himself the Christ,
which means the Anointed One.

733
01:28:26,021 --> 01:28:27,739
Thank you.

734
01:28:27,861 --> 01:28:29,419
I too know some Greek.

735
01:28:31,101 --> 01:28:32,932
What else has he done?

736
01:28:33,061 --> 01:28:35,939
Has he spoken against the Emperor
or against Rome?

737
01:28:37,381 --> 01:28:41,340
Well, Procurator, not directly, no, but...

738
01:28:41,461 --> 01:28:46,171
Not directly? Then you'll have to
judge him according to your Law.

739
01:28:50,981 --> 01:28:54,860
Procurator, for us
this man Jesus is a blasphemer.

740
01:28:54,981 --> 01:28:59,930
lf we were a self-governing nation,
we'd have the right to exact punishment...

741
01:29:00,021 --> 01:29:02,012
..under the Law of Moses.

742
01:29:02,141 --> 01:29:05,577
He entered Jerusalem
calling himself the King of the Jews!

743
01:29:05,701 --> 01:29:07,657
A claim we totally reject!

744
01:29:09,181 --> 01:29:11,137
King of the Jews?

745
01:29:11,261 --> 01:29:16,176
Well, whatever else he may have done,
such a claim is treason.

746
01:29:18,021 --> 01:29:19,977
True, too. All right, all right.

747
01:29:20,501 --> 01:29:22,457
l'll talk to him.

748
01:29:23,581 --> 01:29:25,537
Your Jesus!

749
01:29:25,661 --> 01:29:27,060
Not ours.

750
01:29:27,181 --> 01:29:29,570
Then whose? Whose?!

751
01:29:29,701 --> 01:29:31,931
Bring him in!

752
01:29:49,781 --> 01:29:52,739
Is this the man you think so dangerous?

753
01:29:53,501 --> 01:29:54,456
This?

754
01:29:56,221 --> 01:29:58,177
The man that aspires to be a king?

755
01:30:01,901 --> 01:30:02,856
Come.

756
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:04,937
Come, come, come!

757
01:30:12,661 --> 01:30:14,219
Now,...

758
01:30:15,301 --> 01:30:20,250
..the leaders of the Sanhedrin accuse you
of preaching perverted doctrines.

759
01:30:23,541 --> 01:30:24,496
Come.

760
01:30:32,301 --> 01:30:35,452
They also say you call yourself
the King of the Jews.

761
01:30:37,221 --> 01:30:39,177
Well, are you King of the Jews?

762
01:30:48,221 --> 01:30:50,177
lf my kingdom were of this world,...

763
01:30:50,301 --> 01:30:54,180
..my followers would have fought
to prevent me from being captured.

764
01:30:54,301 --> 01:30:56,257
Oh, you speak of a kingdom.

765
01:30:58,021 --> 01:30:59,977
Therefore you must be a king.

766
01:31:00,101 --> 01:31:02,217
Are you a king?

767
01:31:06,421 --> 01:31:07,979
I am.

768
01:31:13,861 --> 01:31:15,817
I was born for one purpose.

769
01:31:17,941 --> 01:31:19,897
To bear witness to the truth.

770
01:31:22,661 --> 01:31:25,300
All who can accept the truth
hear my voice.

771
01:31:28,461 --> 01:31:30,417
And what is...

772
01:31:31,221 --> 01:31:33,177
..the truth?

773
01:31:44,301 --> 01:31:45,256
Hm!

774
01:31:47,741 --> 01:31:49,697
No, this man's no criminal.

775
01:31:51,101 --> 01:31:53,057
He's a dreamer.

776
01:31:53,181 --> 01:31:54,773
Take him away!

777
01:31:54,901 --> 01:31:59,099
Have him flogged as a token of
Roman justice. That should wake him up.

778
01:32:12,541 --> 01:32:14,099
Procurator,...

779
01:32:15,541 --> 01:32:17,930
..we, the leaders of the Sanhedrin,...

780
01:32:18,781 --> 01:32:20,851
..have always had the same aim as you:

781
01:32:20,981 --> 01:32:25,259
The peaceful administration of our
country for the good of our people, and...

782
01:32:25,381 --> 01:32:27,337
Oh, please, please, please!

783
01:32:27,461 --> 01:32:29,497
Don't talk to me about the people.

784
01:32:30,581 --> 01:32:32,936
As long as they obey,...

785
01:32:33,061 --> 01:32:36,610
..you care as much about
your children of lsrael...

786
01:32:36,701 --> 01:32:39,773
..as we do the mob in Rome.

787
01:32:39,901 --> 01:32:41,857
Now, Zerah,...

788
01:32:44,421 --> 01:32:46,776
..let us speak... directly.

789
01:32:49,141 --> 01:32:51,735
Why does the Sanhedrin...

790
01:32:51,861 --> 01:32:54,534
..consider this man so dangerous...

791
01:32:54,661 --> 01:32:58,859
..that they send you yourself here
to make sure that he is condemned?

792
01:33:00,101 --> 01:33:02,615
Perhaps for the same reasons as you.

793
01:33:02,741 --> 01:33:04,777
lf you knew him as well as we do,...

794
01:33:05,421 --> 01:33:08,379
..you would also find him dangerous.

795
01:33:35,461 --> 01:33:38,658
That's enough!
Put his clothes back on.

796
01:33:46,541 --> 01:33:49,613
I saw him enter Jerusalem as a king!
Look at him now!

797
01:33:49,741 --> 01:33:51,254
He's a king?!

798
01:33:51,381 --> 01:33:53,451
The King of the Jews!

799
01:33:53,581 --> 01:33:55,537
We should dress him like a king.

800
01:33:55,661 --> 01:33:59,336
- Give me your cloak.
- Don't use mine. Use one of those.

801
01:33:59,461 --> 01:34:01,417
Here it is!

802
01:34:02,501 --> 01:34:05,061
Come on! Here we are. Turn around.

803
01:34:05,901 --> 01:34:07,937
Look at him!

804
01:34:08,061 --> 01:34:10,575
Hey, wait! If he's a king,...

805
01:34:10,701 --> 01:34:12,419
..he needs a crown.

806
01:34:12,541 --> 01:34:14,611
Hail, Your Majesty!

807
01:34:14,741 --> 01:34:17,380
High and mighty Majesty!

808
01:34:32,501 --> 01:34:34,457
I have it!

809
01:34:35,581 --> 01:34:37,537
A king's crown!

810
01:34:37,661 --> 01:34:40,129
Look what he's got! He's got his crown!

811
01:34:45,021 --> 01:34:47,581
- He needs a sceptre.
- Majesty!

812
01:34:47,701 --> 01:34:49,657
A perfect fit, Your Majesty.

813
01:34:52,181 --> 01:34:54,137
Now he's the king!

814
01:34:55,461 --> 01:34:57,850
Tiberius will be getting worried!

815
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:55,731
Ecce homo.

816
01:35:55,861 --> 01:35:57,817
Behold the man.

817
01:36:01,101 --> 01:36:05,572
Well? What have you got
to say for yourself now?

818
01:36:07,861 --> 01:36:09,419
Speak!

819
01:36:28,301 --> 01:36:30,257
Who are you?

820
01:36:41,741 --> 01:36:43,697
What are you?

821
01:36:45,261 --> 01:36:47,217
Well, say something!

822
01:36:50,021 --> 01:36:52,660
Don't you want to defend yourself?

823
01:36:53,821 --> 01:36:55,777
Do you want to die?!

824
01:36:56,821 --> 01:37:00,734
Don't you realise I have the power
to release you or have you crucified?!

825
01:37:10,821 --> 01:37:13,779
You would have no power over me...

826
01:37:15,701 --> 01:37:18,977
..if it had not been given you from above.

827
01:37:49,341 --> 01:37:50,899
Quintilius...

828
01:37:54,141 --> 01:37:56,177
Isn't there an ancient custom...

829
01:37:57,021 --> 01:37:58,977
..honouring Passover...

830
01:37:59,581 --> 01:38:03,130
..where the Procurator
can release a prisoner...

831
01:38:03,261 --> 01:38:05,217
..sentenced to death...

832
01:38:06,581 --> 01:38:08,537
..as an act of mercy?

833
01:38:09,821 --> 01:38:11,459
Yes.

834
01:38:11,581 --> 01:38:13,537
That custom still exists.

835
01:38:14,541 --> 01:38:16,497
And we have two prisoners?

836
01:38:18,421 --> 01:38:21,174
- Barabbas?
- And Jesus.

837
01:38:24,261 --> 01:38:26,217
So let the people decide.

838
01:38:37,741 --> 01:38:39,697
I've made my decision.

839
01:38:45,061 --> 01:38:47,017
The people will decide.

840
01:38:47,141 --> 01:38:50,497
- Zerah...
- Take him away!

841
01:38:52,981 --> 01:38:56,417
Get down to the prison
and bring Barabbas.

842
01:39:13,301 --> 01:39:15,656
Barabbas, remember? Barabbas! Good.

843
01:39:17,261 --> 01:39:19,138
Here, here! Listen to me!

844
01:39:19,261 --> 01:39:22,571
You two! When I give you the cue,
you shout for Barabbas.

845
01:39:22,701 --> 01:39:28,412
Barabbas is depending on you. He has
fought for you. Shout for Barabbas.

846
01:39:30,021 --> 01:39:31,977
No, we must save Jesus!

847
01:39:34,101 --> 01:39:37,616
- When did they arrest him?
- Last night in the garden of Gethsemane.

848
01:39:37,741 --> 01:39:40,050
- That's near where l live!
- Be prepared.

849
01:39:40,181 --> 01:39:44,891
Barabbas must be freed at all costs.
Now look, we can put our men all over.

850
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:46,977
Do you understand?

851
01:39:47,101 --> 01:39:50,173
Do you understand?
We meet at the Temple.

852
01:40:30,461 --> 01:40:32,213
As a sign...

853
01:40:32,341 --> 01:40:34,696
..of his magnanimity...

854
01:40:34,781 --> 01:40:36,578
..and his benevolence,...

855
01:40:36,661 --> 01:40:39,380
..our divine Emperor has decided...

856
01:40:39,501 --> 01:40:42,015
..that the custom of releasing...

857
01:40:42,861 --> 01:40:44,738
..one prisoner,...

858
01:40:44,861 --> 01:40:46,817
..sentenced to death,...

859
01:40:46,941 --> 01:40:49,853
..in honour of your Passover,...

860
01:40:49,981 --> 01:40:51,937
..shall continue.

861
01:40:54,741 --> 01:40:56,140
We have...

862
01:40:56,261 --> 01:40:58,217
..two prisoners.

863
01:40:58,941 --> 01:41:00,499
One,...

864
01:41:00,621 --> 01:41:02,100
..Jesus of Nazareth,...

865
01:41:02,221 --> 01:41:04,689
..accused of treason,...

866
01:41:04,821 --> 01:41:07,210
..by proclaiming himself...

867
01:41:09,101 --> 01:41:11,057
..King of the Jews.

868
01:41:11,181 --> 01:41:14,935
Can you work a miracle now, Jesus?!
Ha-ha-ha!

869
01:41:18,541 --> 01:41:20,816
Anyone shouting for him
had better watch out.

870
01:41:20,941 --> 01:41:24,377
- Look at him, the King of the Jews!
- What's happened to him?

871
01:41:25,941 --> 01:41:27,897
Call yourself a king?!

872
01:41:28,381 --> 01:41:30,337
Or...

873
01:41:31,301 --> 01:41:32,256
..Barabbas,...

874
01:41:33,501 --> 01:41:38,131
..accused of sedition
and murdering a Roman auxiliary.

875
01:41:38,261 --> 01:41:40,934
That's the man they call the Son of God?!

876
01:41:41,061 --> 01:41:41,971
Barabbas!

877
01:41:42,101 --> 01:41:43,420
Barabbas!

878
01:41:43,541 --> 01:41:46,419
Free Barabbas! He's one of us!

879
01:41:47,341 --> 01:41:50,777
- Freedom for Barabbas!
- Why don't you free yourself, Jesus!

880
01:41:50,901 --> 01:41:53,290
Which...

881
01:41:53,421 --> 01:41:54,934
..of the two...

882
01:41:55,061 --> 01:41:57,017
..shall be released to you?

883
01:41:59,141 --> 01:42:01,097
Jesus of Nazareth,...

884
01:42:01,781 --> 01:42:05,012
- This must not happen!
- ..guilty of proclaiming himself...

885
01:42:05,141 --> 01:42:08,292
- ..King of the Jews,...
- Look, he's wearing a crown!

886
01:42:08,421 --> 01:42:09,979
..or...

887
01:42:13,141 --> 01:42:14,176
..Barabbas?

888
01:42:16,541 --> 01:42:21,057
Release Jesus! He is the true prophet!

889
01:42:21,981 --> 01:42:26,338
- He's our saviour! Release him!
- Jesus is a man sent from God!

890
01:42:26,461 --> 01:42:28,338
Free Barabbas!

891
01:42:28,461 --> 01:42:30,133
False prophet!

892
01:42:30,261 --> 01:42:32,331
He betrayed us! Kill the Nazarene!

893
01:42:32,461 --> 01:42:33,689
Jesus!

894
01:42:33,821 --> 01:42:35,379
Jesus!

895
01:42:35,501 --> 01:42:36,934
We want Barabbas!

896
01:42:37,061 --> 01:42:39,256
Free Barabbas! Barabbas!

897
01:42:40,301 --> 01:42:41,450
Jesus!

898
01:42:41,581 --> 01:42:42,775
Jesus!

899
01:42:42,901 --> 01:42:44,539
- Barabbas!
- Jesus!

900
01:42:44,661 --> 01:42:46,617
Shut up, you slut!

901
01:42:47,941 --> 01:42:48,896
Jesus!

902
01:42:49,021 --> 01:42:50,739
Free him!

903
01:42:50,861 --> 01:42:52,180
Take the Nazarene!

904
01:42:52,301 --> 01:42:54,212
He's a false prophet!

905
01:42:54,341 --> 01:42:56,297
Free Barabbas!

906
01:42:58,821 --> 01:43:00,777
We can't let him go.

907
01:43:01,701 --> 01:43:04,056
- We can't let Barabbas get away.
- Yes.

908
01:43:05,821 --> 01:43:08,289
- The soldiers won't like that!
- Wait...

909
01:43:10,301 --> 01:43:11,859
Pilate,...

910
01:43:11,981 --> 01:43:14,449
..you're not going to free Barabbas,...

911
01:43:14,581 --> 01:43:16,537
..an assassin and enemy of Rome?

912
01:43:19,421 --> 01:43:20,900
I wonder...

913
01:43:21,021 --> 01:43:22,977
..who is the real enemy?

914
01:43:23,101 --> 01:43:26,855
Jesus of Nazareth must be saved!

915
01:43:33,501 --> 01:43:35,457
Let it be written...

916
01:43:35,581 --> 01:43:38,334
..that Jesus of Nazareth...

917
01:43:39,861 --> 01:43:41,817
..is guilty of treason...

918
01:43:42,861 --> 01:43:44,817
..by proclaiming himself...

919
01:43:45,541 --> 01:43:47,497
..King of the Jews.

920
01:43:47,621 --> 01:43:50,419
And his sentence,...

921
01:43:52,621 --> 01:43:54,577
..to be crucified.

922
01:43:56,941 --> 01:43:59,296
Release Barabbas now!

923
01:44:02,141 --> 01:44:04,735
Do not kill him! He is innocent!

924
01:45:00,021 --> 01:45:02,489
Mark, where's the last prisoner?
Come on!

925
01:45:02,621 --> 01:45:04,054
Here's your man.

926
01:45:04,181 --> 01:45:06,137
Come on.

927
01:45:07,261 --> 01:45:09,217
Ah, the King of the Jews.

928
01:45:09,341 --> 01:45:13,414
- Hurry up, this crowd worries me.
- Here, take him.

929
01:45:52,461 --> 01:45:54,417
Come on! Make room! Make room!

930
01:45:54,541 --> 01:45:56,736
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

931
01:45:59,341 --> 01:46:01,809
- He is a false prophet!
- ls that justice?!

932
01:46:05,621 --> 01:46:08,260
Get back! Get back! Make way!

933
01:46:13,981 --> 01:46:15,937
Have you no heart!

934
01:46:16,061 --> 01:46:18,370
Save yourself, Jesus!

935
01:46:24,661 --> 01:46:26,333
Keep this mob back!

936
01:46:26,461 --> 01:46:28,929
Use your spears!

937
01:46:29,061 --> 01:46:33,020
You betrayed us! You betrayed us!
We believed you, and you betrayed us!

938
01:46:51,541 --> 01:46:53,896
Get back, you scum! Come on! Come on!

939
01:46:59,061 --> 01:47:00,653
He's a traitor!

940
01:47:01,981 --> 01:47:03,778
He's a prophet!

941
01:47:10,421 --> 01:47:11,536
Traitor!

942
01:47:11,661 --> 01:47:14,016
Crucify him!

943
01:47:27,781 --> 01:47:29,692
Oh, Lord!

944
01:48:21,741 --> 01:48:23,697
Argh!

945
01:48:26,461 --> 01:48:28,417
Argh!

946
01:48:53,701 --> 01:48:55,657
Arrest him! Arrest him!

947
01:49:01,021 --> 01:49:05,060
Take down that sign! lt is an insult!
He is not the King of the Jews!

948
01:49:05,181 --> 01:49:08,139
- Those are the orders we received!
- Take down that sign!

949
01:49:08,261 --> 01:49:09,979
Out of the way!

950
01:49:10,101 --> 01:49:12,899
You cannot kill him!
You have no right to do it!

951
01:49:17,901 --> 01:49:19,857
Now, all of you, stay back!

952
01:49:29,421 --> 01:49:31,377
Father,...

953
01:49:32,701 --> 01:49:34,657
..forgive them.

954
01:49:36,661 --> 01:49:38,617
They know not what they do.

955
01:50:26,021 --> 01:50:26,976
Hey!

956
01:50:27,101 --> 01:50:29,057
- Who are you?
- She is his mother.

957
01:50:29,181 --> 01:50:30,739
Can you prove it?

958
01:50:30,861 --> 01:50:32,499
Hey!

959
01:50:33,501 --> 01:50:35,457
She is his mother.

960
01:50:40,301 --> 01:50:42,257
Go to him.

961
01:50:51,621 --> 01:50:53,851
- And who are you?
- Please.

962
01:50:55,221 --> 01:50:57,177
l'm one of the family.

963
01:51:00,861 --> 01:51:02,499
Is that right?

964
01:51:03,781 --> 01:51:04,736
Yes.

965
01:51:05,821 --> 01:51:07,777
She is one of the family.

966
01:51:09,261 --> 01:51:11,217
Go, then.

967
01:51:13,901 --> 01:51:16,369
The Romans won't let you get close.

968
01:51:43,861 --> 01:51:45,817
women sobbing)

969
01:52:39,341 --> 01:52:40,899
John,...

970
01:52:44,621 --> 01:52:46,577
..behold your mother.

971
01:52:57,461 --> 01:52:59,019
Woman,...

972
01:53:02,661 --> 01:53:05,175
..behold your son.

973
01:53:24,941 --> 01:53:26,897
He saved others.

974
01:53:27,021 --> 01:53:30,093
Why can't he save himself now?

975
01:53:39,341 --> 01:53:41,411
He was despised...

976
01:53:41,541 --> 01:53:43,497
..and rejected of men.

977
01:53:44,541 --> 01:53:46,691
Man of sorrows,...

978
01:53:46,821 --> 01:53:48,777
..and acquainted with grief.

979
01:53:49,701 --> 01:53:51,657
He was oppressed...

980
01:53:52,261 --> 01:53:54,217
..and afflicted, yet...

981
01:53:55,101 --> 01:53:57,740
..he opened not his mouth.

982
01:53:57,861 --> 01:54:00,421
He was brought as a lamb to slaughter,...

983
01:54:00,541 --> 01:54:02,497
..and as a sheep...

984
01:54:02,621 --> 01:54:05,260
..before its shearer is dumb...

985
01:54:06,941 --> 01:54:08,454
Surely...

986
01:54:08,581 --> 01:54:10,890
..he hath borne our griefs,...

987
01:54:11,021 --> 01:54:13,296
..and carried our sorrows.

988
01:54:13,421 --> 01:54:17,972
Yet we did esteem him stricken,
smitten of God, and afflicted.

989
01:54:20,061 --> 01:54:23,212
But he was wounded
for our transgressions,...

990
01:54:23,341 --> 01:54:26,333
..he was abused for our iniquities,...

991
01:54:26,461 --> 01:54:29,498
..and... through his wounds,...

992
01:54:31,261 --> 01:54:33,217
..we are healed...

993
01:54:38,101 --> 01:54:40,057
..and...

994
01:54:42,021 --> 01:54:44,376
..born again.

995
01:54:54,021 --> 01:54:55,977
Eli,...

996
01:55:00,141 --> 01:55:02,097
..Eli,...

997
01:55:06,141 --> 01:55:09,258
..lama sabachthani?

998
01:55:52,021 --> 01:55:53,977
Father,...

999
01:55:59,101 --> 01:56:01,057
..into thy hands...

1000
01:56:03,981 --> 01:56:05,937
..I commit my spirit.

1001
01:56:12,261 --> 01:56:14,217
It...

1002
01:56:15,781 --> 01:56:17,737
..is...

1003
01:56:20,261 --> 01:56:22,217
..accomplished.

1004
01:57:34,421 --> 01:57:37,572
Hey, you, the family!
Come on, you can take the body.

1005
01:59:20,141 --> 01:59:21,256
Hey! Stop!

1006
01:59:22,461 --> 01:59:25,214
Who are you? Where are you going?

1007
01:59:28,221 --> 01:59:31,452
We are the family of Jesus of Nazareth,
who lies here.

1008
01:59:32,981 --> 01:59:34,858
What do you want?

1009
01:59:34,981 --> 01:59:36,937
To enter the tomb.

1010
01:59:38,861 --> 01:59:39,816
Why?

1011
01:59:43,261 --> 01:59:45,217
To anoint the body.

1012
01:59:45,981 --> 01:59:47,699
To bring fresh linen,...

1013
01:59:47,821 --> 01:59:49,777
..herbs and spices.

1014
01:59:50,821 --> 01:59:52,812
It is our custom.

1015
01:59:57,221 --> 02:00:00,179
Why didn't you do that
when you brought him here?

1016
02:00:00,301 --> 02:00:02,861
The Sabbath began.
We could not buy them.

1017
02:00:03,581 --> 02:00:05,458
What do you think?

1018
02:00:05,581 --> 02:00:08,095
They're only three women. Let them go.

1019
02:00:08,221 --> 02:00:12,294
l suppose it'll be all right.
You'll need an army to move that stone.

1020
02:00:12,421 --> 02:00:16,175
All right, then. Let's go together,
but we'll need some help.

1021
02:00:16,781 --> 02:00:18,851
Hey, Lentulus, wake up!

1022
02:00:18,981 --> 02:00:20,733
Come with us!

1023
02:00:20,861 --> 02:00:22,817
Marcus, you watch the bridge!

1024
02:00:24,061 --> 02:00:26,939
All those priests, too.
Are they still around?

1025
02:00:31,981 --> 02:00:35,132
Can't wait to get away from this place,
back to Rome.

1026
02:00:42,461 --> 02:00:44,417
Where are you going?

1027
02:00:48,141 --> 02:00:50,609
Why do you seek the living
among the dead?

1028
02:00:53,981 --> 02:00:55,937
Jesus is not there.

1029
02:01:08,781 --> 02:01:10,737
He's gone!

1030
02:01:13,021 --> 02:01:14,977
Come!

1031
02:01:23,221 --> 02:01:25,177
Jesus is not here.

1032
02:01:37,021 --> 02:01:40,331
- Are you sure?
- I swear by Jupiter, HercuIes and Mars!

1033
02:01:40,461 --> 02:01:42,736
You've been awake all night
and haven't moved.

1034
02:01:42,861 --> 02:01:46,740
That's right! We were given strict orders.
Nobody's been near that tomb.

1035
02:01:46,861 --> 02:01:49,500
Those Jewish priests
were with us all the time.

1036
02:01:49,621 --> 02:01:51,896
Well, then, who moved the stone?

1037
02:01:56,701 --> 02:01:59,454
- Who is it?
- Me. Philip.

1038
02:02:02,421 --> 02:02:04,377
- Did anyone follow you?
- No.

1039
02:02:06,221 --> 02:02:08,781
- Are you sure?
- Of course l'm sure.

1040
02:02:11,341 --> 02:02:13,297
Are they still looking for us?

1041
02:02:13,421 --> 02:02:17,096
On every corner one sees
Temple guards and Roman soldiers.

1042
02:02:17,421 --> 02:02:20,413
This place isn't safe.
We must go somewhere else.

1043
02:02:20,541 --> 02:02:24,011
- But where can we go?
- I wish we could go to Galilee.

1044
02:02:25,901 --> 02:02:27,573
Peter...

1045
02:02:27,701 --> 02:02:29,657
Peter!

1046
02:02:30,861 --> 02:02:32,579
Tell us,...

1047
02:02:32,701 --> 02:02:34,134
..what should we do?

1048
02:02:34,261 --> 02:02:36,980
We must do what the Master
would have wanted.

1049
02:02:38,701 --> 02:02:40,817
The Master's dead, Peter.

1050
02:02:46,181 --> 02:02:49,139
- I thought you said you weren't followed!
- I wasn't!

1051
02:02:56,901 --> 02:02:58,857
- Mary...
- Peter!

1052
02:03:01,501 --> 02:03:03,457
All of you,...

1053
02:03:04,301 --> 02:03:06,257
..I have seen him.

1054
02:03:06,381 --> 02:03:08,337
Seen who?

1055
02:03:09,501 --> 02:03:10,729
The Master.

1056
02:03:12,021 --> 02:03:13,739
You've seen him?

1057
02:03:13,861 --> 02:03:15,135
Yes.

1058
02:03:17,261 --> 02:03:18,819
He is risen.

1059
02:03:26,821 --> 02:03:27,970
I saw him.

1060
02:03:28,101 --> 02:03:29,659
I saw him!

1061
02:03:29,781 --> 02:03:33,615
This morning we went to the tomb,
and near the tomb was a man...

1062
02:03:34,501 --> 02:03:36,457
..and a young boy.

1063
02:03:36,981 --> 02:03:41,179
And the man said to me, "Why do you
look for the living among the dead?"

1064
02:03:43,181 --> 02:03:45,137
"Jesus is not here."

1065
02:03:45,861 --> 02:03:49,251
So we went to the tomb
and we saw the stone was upturned.

1066
02:03:50,261 --> 02:03:53,571
The grave... the tomb was open.

1067
02:03:57,101 --> 02:03:59,490
We looked for him.

1068
02:03:59,621 --> 02:04:01,577
He was not there.

1069
02:04:08,501 --> 02:04:12,414
- You mean his body wasn't there?
- Has it been stolen?

1070
02:04:12,541 --> 02:04:14,896
No, no, no. Let me finish.

1071
02:04:16,301 --> 02:04:18,531
When we were leaving the cemetery,...

1072
02:04:18,661 --> 02:04:20,617
..I saw another man.

1073
02:04:21,261 --> 02:04:23,217
He saw how distraught we were.

1074
02:04:25,141 --> 02:04:27,097
He said, "Woman,...

1075
02:04:29,461 --> 02:04:31,417
..why do you weep?"

1076
02:04:33,421 --> 02:04:35,377
And then he said my name.

1077
02:04:36,661 --> 02:04:38,617
"Mary..."

1078
02:04:40,181 --> 02:04:42,137
"Mary."

1079
02:04:43,461 --> 02:04:46,021
And it was then that I saw...

1080
02:04:46,221 --> 02:04:48,177
..it was Jesus.

1081
02:04:50,421 --> 02:04:52,377
l fell to my knees...

1082
02:04:52,501 --> 02:04:54,856
..and I reached for him.

1083
02:04:55,381 --> 02:04:57,337
"Touch me not,...

1084
02:04:58,261 --> 02:05:01,412
..for I have not yet
ascended to my Father", he said.

1085
02:05:03,301 --> 02:05:05,257
"But go to my brothers,...

1086
02:05:05,381 --> 02:05:07,372
..and tell them."

1087
02:05:20,221 --> 02:05:22,177
You don't believe me.

1088
02:05:23,861 --> 02:05:25,817
You don't believe me!

1089
02:05:31,701 --> 02:05:33,657
l tell you, l saw him!

1090
02:05:33,781 --> 02:05:35,737
- It was our Lord!
- Mary...

1091
02:05:35,861 --> 02:05:37,658
Mary!

1092
02:05:37,781 --> 02:05:39,737
John...

1093
02:05:39,941 --> 02:05:41,340
Oh, John...

1094
02:05:42,381 --> 02:05:44,337
You don't believe me.

1095
02:05:44,461 --> 02:05:46,019
You!

1096
02:05:46,861 --> 02:05:48,533
Mary...

1097
02:05:48,661 --> 02:05:50,617
You're tired.

1098
02:05:51,501 --> 02:05:53,059
Please!

1099
02:05:54,421 --> 02:05:56,377
Please go.

1100
02:05:57,261 --> 02:05:59,217
I saw him, John.

1101
02:05:59,341 --> 02:06:01,297
I saw him.

1102
02:06:03,821 --> 02:06:05,777
Women's fantasies.

1103
02:06:07,221 --> 02:06:08,779
Fantasies?

1104
02:06:09,781 --> 02:06:11,737
Was his death a fantasy?!

1105
02:06:12,221 --> 02:06:14,177
I saw him die!

1106
02:06:14,301 --> 02:06:16,257
I was there and I wept at his feet!

1107
02:06:17,181 --> 02:06:19,741
Why should he not then appear to me?!

1108
02:06:21,061 --> 02:06:23,017
He is risen.

1109
02:06:32,461 --> 02:06:34,417
He told me to tell you,...

1110
02:06:36,941 --> 02:06:38,897
..and I have done so.

1111
02:06:50,541 --> 02:06:55,695
You wouldn't believe her! When he raised
Jairus's daughter, you didn't believe it!

1112
02:06:55,821 --> 02:06:58,779
What do you mean?
You believe her story?!

1113
02:07:03,341 --> 02:07:05,297
Well, do any of you believe it?

1114
02:07:06,141 --> 02:07:08,450
Do you, Andrew?

1115
02:07:08,581 --> 02:07:10,537
Do you, James?

1116
02:07:12,141 --> 02:07:14,097
And you, Matthew?!

1117
02:07:23,141 --> 02:07:24,699
Do you,...

1118
02:07:25,741 --> 02:07:27,299
..Peter?

1119
02:07:31,901 --> 02:07:33,459
Yes.

1120
02:07:35,301 --> 02:07:36,859
How can you?

1121
02:07:38,741 --> 02:07:40,697
Because he said so.

1122
02:07:43,181 --> 02:07:45,137
Because he wanted it to be so.

1123
02:07:48,621 --> 02:07:50,737
He wanted everything to happen...

1124
02:07:53,141 --> 02:07:55,097
..just as it did.

1125
02:07:59,061 --> 02:08:01,017
And I have always believed him.

1126
02:08:01,141 --> 02:08:03,211
But... Peter,...

1127
02:08:03,341 --> 02:08:06,651
..you denied him.
You denied him three times!

1128
02:08:06,781 --> 02:08:08,339
Yes!

1129
02:08:09,581 --> 02:08:12,095
I denied him because I was a coward!

1130
02:08:14,821 --> 02:08:16,777
We are all cowards!

1131
02:08:18,581 --> 02:08:22,256
We accused Judas of being a traitor,
but we all betrayed him!

1132
02:08:24,341 --> 02:08:26,013
We all...

1133
02:08:26,141 --> 02:08:27,893
..abandoned him.

1134
02:08:28,021 --> 02:08:33,414
At least our brothers in the Sanhedrin
who condemned him didn't know him!

1135
02:08:33,541 --> 02:08:35,497
The Romans...

1136
02:08:37,741 --> 02:08:39,697
..did not know him.

1137
02:08:39,821 --> 02:08:41,777
But we...

1138
02:08:43,301 --> 02:08:45,257
We ate with him.

1139
02:08:47,221 --> 02:08:49,177
We lived with him.

1140
02:08:51,341 --> 02:08:53,297
We knew he was the Christ!

1141
02:08:54,421 --> 02:08:56,377
And still we betrayed him!

1142
02:08:59,541 --> 02:09:01,896
Brothers, don't you... can't you see?

1143
02:09:05,461 --> 02:09:07,417
Thomas...

1144
02:09:12,701 --> 02:09:14,896
You asked me if I believe he is risen.

1145
02:09:17,061 --> 02:09:19,017
Yes, I do.

1146
02:09:20,221 --> 02:09:22,735
For l know in my heart he will not...

1147
02:09:23,741 --> 02:09:25,697
..abandon us.

1148
02:09:27,781 --> 02:09:30,170
I know in my heart he has forgiven me...

1149
02:09:36,221 --> 02:09:38,291
Us.

1150
02:09:53,061 --> 02:09:55,017
Forgiven all of us.

1151
02:10:08,981 --> 02:10:10,937
This is precisely what I feared.

1152
02:10:11,061 --> 02:10:14,610
His disciples must have removed
the stone and taken away the body.

1153
02:10:14,741 --> 02:10:17,619
lmpossible!
I had guards here as you requested.

1154
02:10:17,741 --> 02:10:20,050
And your priests were here, too.

1155
02:10:38,141 --> 02:10:40,416
Now it begins.

1156
02:10:49,821 --> 02:10:51,777
lt all begins.

1157
02:11:03,301 --> 02:11:05,257
lt was written...

1158
02:11:07,221 --> 02:11:09,177
..the Son ofMan will suffer,...

1159
02:11:11,421 --> 02:11:13,377
..and on the third day...

1160
02:11:13,981 --> 02:11:16,859
..will rise again from the dead
to enter his glory.

1161
02:11:19,621 --> 02:11:21,657
You are my witnesses to this.

1162
02:11:25,821 --> 02:11:28,893
Now my Father in heaven
is reconciled to the world.

1163
02:11:31,621 --> 02:11:33,577
And as he sent me...

1164
02:11:35,621 --> 02:11:37,577
..so I am sending you.

1165
02:11:48,181 --> 02:11:50,137
Receive the Holy Spirit.

1166
02:11:53,421 --> 02:11:55,981
Go like lambs among wolves.

1167
02:12:00,501 --> 02:12:03,857
Make disciples of all nations.

1168
02:12:06,381 --> 02:12:09,134
Baptise them in the name of the Father,...

1169
02:12:09,261 --> 02:12:11,217
..and of the Son,...

1170
02:12:11,341 --> 02:12:13,616
..and of the Holy Ghost.

1171
02:12:13,741 --> 02:12:17,256
Teach them the gospel
and the commandments l gave you.

1172
02:12:19,501 --> 02:12:21,093
Now...

1173
02:12:21,221 --> 02:12:24,293
..I am leaving the world again,...

1174
02:12:24,421 --> 02:12:27,572
..and going to the Father.

1175
02:12:32,701 --> 02:12:34,657
Oh, Lord, stay with us.

1176
02:12:37,181 --> 02:12:39,137
The night is falling.

1177
02:12:40,821 --> 02:12:42,777
The day is almost over.

1178
02:12:48,341 --> 02:12:50,297
Don't be afraid.

1179
02:12:52,421 --> 02:12:54,377
I am with you every day...

1180
02:12:56,301 --> 02:12:58,257
..till the end of time.

1181
02:14:58,181 --> 02:15:00,900
