1
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:43,275
Well, Dmitri, every search for a hero...

2
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:46,635
must begin with something that every hero requires...

3
00:00:48,275 --> 00:00:50,215
a villain.

4
00:00:50,275 --> 00:00:55,115
Therefore, in the search for our hero, Bellerophon,

5
00:00:55,185 --> 00:00:57,745
we created a monster,

6
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:01,945
Chimera.

7
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,250
I beg you, Dmitri, come to Sydney...

8
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,260
and accompany me to Atlanta immediately.

9
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,620
However we travel, I must arrive at my destination...

10
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,760
within 20 hours of departure.

11
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,260
Folks, we're two-and-a-half hours from Atlanta.

12
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,860
Look out your window now. We have
a great view of the Rocky Mountains.

13
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:01,140
You keep staring at that watch as if
your life depended on it, Doctor.

14
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,140
Oh, yes.

15
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,610
I suppose I'm a bit anxious.

16
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,170
You'll soon be with old friends.

17
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,880
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.

18
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,790
I'm sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.

19
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,320
I'm sorry too.
You are sorry, and I am sorry.

20
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,130
You don't know Gradski thought the world of you.

21
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,500
Did he... know...

22
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,230
before the end that you two had succeeded?

23
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,140
Yes, he knew. Just...

24
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,900
Not in time to save him.

25
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,570
No.

26
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,580
After you've been infected with Chimera
for 20 hours, nothing can save you.

27
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,450
Not even Bellerophon.

28
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,650
You can carry them together... safely?

29
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,660
Yes.

30
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,930
And you'll get us to safe place with
them in Atlanta, thank God.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,840
This is your captain again.
We've experienced a slight...

32
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,030
but abrupt drop in cabin pressure.

33
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,440
As a precaution, I've released the oxygen masks.

34
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,940
Please put them on and sit back, relax.

35
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,210
There's nothing to worry about.

36
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,380
Are you concerned?

37
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,390
Not so far.

38
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,320
Just put on your oxygen mask.
I'll see what's going on.

39
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,090
Okay.

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,270
Denver Center, this is Trans-Pac 2207, 747 heavy.

41
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,400
We're unable to maintain cabin pressurization.

42
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,600
We've initiated a descent to one six thousand.

43
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,770
Captain...

44
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,890
It seems we have a problem, Dmitri.

45
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,050
You keep calling me Dmitri.
You really shouldn't.

46
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,650
You are not Dmitri?

47
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,980
No.

48
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,580
Wallis, hold on to this.

49
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,220
Ulrich, remember to pull the...

50
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,100
Remember to pull the NO2 tank and dump it.

51
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,360
All done, chief.

52
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,810
Terrain. Terrain.
Pull up. Pull up.

53
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,810
Terrain.

54
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,650
Okay, dive, dive!
Checkpoint Charlie in three,

55
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,710
two, one, go!

56
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,890
Terrain. Terrain.
Pull up. Pull up.

57
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,600
Terrain. Terrain.
Pull up. Pull up.

58
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:57,040
Terrain. Terrain. Pull up. Pull up.

59
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,380
Good morning, Mr. Hunt.

60
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,380
Your mission, should you choose to accept it,

61
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,110
involves the recovery of a stolen item designated ''Chimera.''

62
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,620
You may select any two team members,

63
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,990
but it is essential that the third team
member be Nyah Nordoff-Hall.

64
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,490
She is a civilian and a highly capable professional thief.

65
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,360
You have 48 hours to recruit Miss Nordoff-Hall...

66
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,300
and meet me in Seville to receive your assignment.

67
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,170
As always, should you or any member
of your IMF team be caught or killed,

68
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,170
the secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions.

69
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,270
And, Mr. Hunt, the next time you go on holiday,

70
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,310
please be good enough to let us know where you're going.

71
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,750
This message will self-destruct in five seconds.

72
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,580
If I let you know where I'm going...

73
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,250
then I won't be on holiday.

74
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,990
I see you found it.

75
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,120
What are you doing here?

76
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,830
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?

77
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,660
Huh. You're not just a pretty face after all.

78
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,120
Do you mind if I'm on top?

79
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,460
No. Either way works for me.

80
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,150
- You'll never find it there.
- Damn it!

81
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,690
Find what?

82
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,200
His ex's Bulgari necklace that goes up for auction on Tuesday.

83
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,400
And are you gonna tell me where it is?

84
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,510
Far left.

85
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,850
This is very disconcerting.

86
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,480
Hey, you put me here.
I just do as I'm told.

87
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,660
Right.

88
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,550
Hmm!

89
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:52,250
Now, who are you, and what's it gonna cost me?

90
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,590
- I wouldn't do that.
- What?

91
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,100
That.

92
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,810
No, no, no.
Tranquilo. Tranquilo.

93
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,000
Mr. Keys, it is you.

94
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,270
It is Mr. Keys, our security engineer. Apologize!

95
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,810
No, no. No need to apologize.

96
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,280
Now, Miss Hall, my associate has your
necklace in a very safe place.

97
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:23,760
But obviously we do feel the alarm should
have gone off a little sooner.

98
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,760
- Isn't that right, Miss Hall?
- Hmm? Oh, absolutely.

99
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,820
Much, much too long, I'd say.

100
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,760
Under the circumstances, I think we'd recommend...

101
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,860
resetting the sensors to respond to a lighter load.

102
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,060
How do you feel about 40 kilos, Miss Hall?

103
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,010
Perfect.

104
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,340
Shall we?

105
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,710
- Miss Hall.
- Hmm?

106
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,680
Haven't you forgotten something?

107
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,990
What are you trying to do, señorita?
Rob me?

108
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,360
The thought had crossed my mind.

109
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,090
I'm missing something here, aside from
my half-million-pound necklace.

110
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,830
Even after I screwed up the job,

111
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,960
I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.

112
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,530
At least you walked.

113
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,600
Why did you watch me go through it all?

114
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,910
I wanted to see how good you were.
I was hoping we might work together.

115
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,570
Sounds terrific.
Muchacho.

116
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,980
Now be serious.
Whatever you're talking about,

117
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,350
you couldn't possibly want me after tonight's performance.

118
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,910
- You didn't do that badly.
- You apologizing for me?

119
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,150
Quite the gentleman. Gracias.

120
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,820
Not really. I triggered the alarm.

121
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,660
Sorry.

122
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:52,880
I don't do laundry, cook, or put up with cheeky bastards

123
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,010
who set me up on their territory
so they can poach on mine.

124
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,230
Hola.

125
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,750
Hi. Would you mind slowing down?

126
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,360
Where did you get this number?
I don't even have it.

127
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,200
Would you like it?

128
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,250
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen.

129
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,060
- Listen to what?
- I need your help.

130
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,930
- And I think you could use mine.
- Your help?

131
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,440
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about Scotland Yard,

132
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,030
Interpol, every Dutch authority.

133
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,440
- I can make them all go away.
- Oh, bloody hell.

134
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,070
You're a spy!
Well, if you want me,

135
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,770
you've gotta catch me!

136
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,240
Whoa!

137
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,630
You having fun?

138
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,510
Sorry.

139
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,260
Idiota.

140
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,820
Sorry.

141
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,490
Watch the road.
Watch the road.

142
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,460
What's your name?

143
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,060
Ethan Hunt.

144
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,070
Well, Ethan Hunt,

145
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,110
what is it you want to talk to me about?

146
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,070
A lot more than I thought.

147
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:33,240
Awfully short notice.

148
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,180
Care to wait a decent interval?

149
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,780
Who wants to be decent?

150
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,470
So what have you got against spies?

151
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,950
When they've got your recruiting technique?

152
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,780
This wasn't exactly by the book.

153
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,950
They've got a book for this?

154
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,430
Oh, they've got a book for everything.

155
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,990
So, this thing these blokes pinched...

156
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,500
I don't know that they pinched it.

157
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,730
I don't even know that they're blokes.

158
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:04,100
What am I doing here?

159
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,340
And I thought I'm supposed to be...

160
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,470
some kind of thief to catch a thief.

161
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,540
So do I... sort of.

162
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,180
Damn, you're beautiful.

163
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,880
Espresso? Cappuccino?

164
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,190
- No, thanks.
- Sit down. Sit down.

165
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,250
Festival's a pain in the ass.

166
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,300
Honoring their saints by setting them on fire.

167
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,530
Lets you know what they think of saints, doesn't it?

168
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,370
Damn near set me on fire on my way over here.

169
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,740
Sorry I barged in on your vacation.

170
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,540
I'm sorry I didn't let you know where I was.

171
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,810
Don't be. It wouldn't be a vacation if you did.

172
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,280
You're sorry, and I'm sorry.

173
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:09,050
Why did you phrase it like that?

174
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,920
- Like what?
- ''You're sorry; I'm sorry.''

175
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:16,220
You've gotta be kidding.

176
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,740
Well, Dmitri, once again I need your help.

177
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,740
Just as in the old days, huh?

178
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:34,210
When you saved our lives, saved our very sanity.

179
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,070
Dmitri...

180
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,880
we have this little problem.

181
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,350
Every search for a hero...

182
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,790
must begin with something that every hero requires...

183
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,020
a villain.

184
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,860
Therefore, in the search for our hero, Bellerophon,

185
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:00,340
we created a monster, Chimera.

186
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,370
I beg you, Dmitri,

187
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,970
come to Sydney and accompany me
to Atlanta immediately.

188
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,880
However we travel, I must arrive at my destination...

189
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,080
within 20 hours of departure.

190
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:20,350
I fear I can entrust this to no one but you.

191
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:26,190
Dmitri, as we say, I'm sorry and you're sorry.

192
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,700
Do you have any idea what the hell he's talking about?

193
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,530
- An idea? Yeah.
- Like?

194
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,970
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry...

195
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,870
and a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.

196
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,640
-Is he still in Sydney?
-Dr. Vladimir Nekhovich is dead.

197
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,650
So is his colleague Gradski, but that happened earlier.

198
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:51,090
We had Nekhovich on a flight from Sydney
that crashed in the Rockies.

199
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,350
- Dead?
- Are you listening to me?

200
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,690
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me,
how did you get him on that flight?

201
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,670
Oh, you were there.

202
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,410
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.

203
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,570
Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice.

204
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,670
Now, he doubled you, what, two or three times?

205
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:24,180
- Twice.
- What did you think of him?

206
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,720
We had our reservations about each other.

207
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,390
Isn't it a little late to be asking me that?

208
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:40,030
No, not necessarily. Airline records list a Captain
Harold Macintosh as the pilot of flight 2207.

209
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:46,000
As far as the media and all government agencies are
concerned, Captain Macintosh died on the flight.

210
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,240
But, in fact, he missed it.

211
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:54,420
He did, however, make the next flight in cargo.

212
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:58,080
Stuffed into a rather small suitcase, considering his size.

213
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,590
Now, someone on that flight planned an operation...

214
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,530
designed to bring the plane down
and make it look like an accident.

215
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,430
Someone skillful enough to bring
the whole thing off without a hitch.

216
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,490
So there's one thing we know that Ambrose doesn't.

217
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:15,100
You do think it was Ambrose?
You're not surprised?

218
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:19,040
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless
he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.

219
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:24,710
The question is why? What was this, uh,
Chimera, Nekhovich was carrying?

220
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,550
Only Ambrose knows that.

221
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:33,420
In any case, you must recover this...
whatever... Chimera, and bring it to us.

222
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:37,620
In order to do that, I have to figure out
how he plans to make money with it.

223
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,460
That is where Miss Hall comes in.

224
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,070
Excuse me?

225
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,040
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship
which he took very seriously.

226
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,910
She walked away, and he's been
wanting her back ever since.

227
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,070
We believe she's our surest and
quickest way of locating him.

228
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,140
And then what?

229
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:03,610
Well, make sure she continues to see him,
gets him to confide in her, and report to you.

230
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,930
You made it sound as if I was recruiting
her for her skills as a thief.

231
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:27,140
Well, then I misled you, or you made the wrong assumption.

232
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:31,150
Either way, we're asking her to resume a prior relationship,

233
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,450
not do anything she hasn't already done.

234
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,040
Voluntarily, I might add.

235
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,220
No, she's got no training for this kind of thing.

236
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:47,290
What, to go to bed with a man and lie to him?
She's a woman. She's got all the training she needs.

237
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,030
I don't think I can get her to do it.

238
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,510
- You mean it'll be difficult.
- Very.

239
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,770
Well, this is not Mission Difficult, Mr. Hunt,
it's Mission Impossible.

240
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,170
Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.

241
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:07,680
I'm open to suggestion. If you can think of
a quicker way, you're welcome to try.

242
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:13,090
You might take a look at these if you have any further
qualms about getting her to do the job.

243
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,460
How many people are capable of something like that?

244
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,960
Sean Ambrose, for one.

245
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,870
Right.

246
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,340
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.

247
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,580
But it is what you'd like me to do.

248
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,400
What? Oh, let my conscience be my guide, is that it?

249
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,630
Something like that.

250
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,830
I don't have a conscience.
I'm a bloody thief.

251
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,570
Are you gonna try and force me to do this?

252
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,080
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone,

253
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,780
not when there's a chance my life
could end up in their hands.

254
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:17,050
- Is that the only reason?
- Can you think of a better one?

255
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,780
Me? No. But I was just hoping that you might,

256
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,090
thinking that somewhere, this got
personal as well as physical!

257
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,290
Would it make you feel any better
if I didn't want you to do this?

258
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,800
- Yeah, much.
- Then feel better!

259
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,270
You know, Sean will never be anything but suspicious...

260
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:12,670
if I pitch up saying, ''Hey, honey, I'm home.''

261
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,140
What wouldn't make him suspicious?

262
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,870
That I needed him in some urgent way.

263
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,050
Destitute.
In serious trouble.

264
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,310
The kind I couldn't possibly sort out myself.

265
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:32,550
Serious trouble, Nyah, is something
that I can always arrange.

266
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:39,400
This transponder chip is completely untraceable.

267
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,930
It transmits your location to a satellite...

268
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:47,100
which can be read by only this computer.

269
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,610
We can then track you to within three feet.

270
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,610
Anywhere.

271
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,580
Since your arrest, I've been sending news bulletins...

272
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,520
to every law enforcement agency.

273
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:01,420
I know Sean Ambrose,

274
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,390
and I guarantee that after that airline crash,

275
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,620
he's monitoring everyone of them.

276
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,100
He knows you're there.

277
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,070
And he has the means to get you out.

278
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,510
Nyah...

279
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,140
Nyah...

280
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,150
I'm not gonna lose you.

281
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:26,840
Ethan Hunt? G'day, mate.
I'm William Baird. Billy's okay.

282
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,500
Anything you need me to get,
move or watch, just let me know.

283
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,880
I'll have a look around.

284
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:38,250
- Shit.
- Yes, it is.

285
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,480
This ain't funny.

286
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,820
I just bought these $800 Gucci shoes,

287
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,020
and you got me in a helicopter with this man?

288
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,070
Computer's up. We got her.

289
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,600
Let's put in the coordinates and get a visual.

290
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,480
Visuals aren't coming up.

291
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,490
The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.

292
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,930
Yeah, I heard about you, Luther.
Just wanna say it's an honor...

293
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,430
and a pleasure to be working with you blokes.

294
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:14,200
Come on. Isn't there any way we can speed this up?

295
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:17,210
With what? This is the only computer that'll do this.

296
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,910
Ohhh!

297
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:17,400
Ethan, here we go.

298
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,440
Aye.

299
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:31,450
Now, there's a bloke who knows
how to give a proper welcome.

300
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,620
Don't get me wrong, mate.
You were very friendly also.

301
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,620
- Is it him?
- It's him, Billy.

302
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,360
- So we've got him!
- We don't know what we've got.

303
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,800
'Cause we don't know what he's got,

304
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:50,100
where he's got it or what he's doing in Sydney with it.

305
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:00,280
- Not much luggage.
- I left in a bit of a hurry.

306
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,470
I'm incredibly grateful, Sean.

307
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:06,280
How in the world did you find me?

308
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,690
How I usually find you, Nyah.

309
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,130
Magic.

310
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:33,180
Mmm, mmm!
No flies on her.

311
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:36,880
No bugs, either.
No transmissions.

312
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,880
She's clean.

313
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,250
All cats are.

314
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:50,660
- Your room?
- Mmm.

315
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:58,160
- And my room?
- Hmm.

316
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:16,820
She did it. She's in the compound.

317
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:23,590
Yeah? We just rolled up a snowball and tossed it into hell.

318
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:27,330
Now we'll see what chance it has.

319
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,560
Try it on.

320
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:35,340
Go ahead.

321
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,140
I'm dying to see if I remembered your size.

322
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:17,470
You're not interested in seeing how it looks?

323
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,490
Oh, I am.

324
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,660
Later.

325
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,340
Every search for a hero...

326
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,390
must begin with something that every hero requires...

327
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,510
a villain.

328
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:59,990
Therefore, in the search for our hero, Bellerophon,

329
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,830
we created a monster, Chimera.

330
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,870
Nekhovich was a molecular biologist.

331
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,130
Why is he going on about an old Greek myth?

332
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,470
Nekhovich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.

333
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:16,710
In the myth,

334
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,440
Bellerophon was a prince who killed the Chimera.

335
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:24,080
A monster with the head of a lion...

336
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:27,020
and the tail of a serpent...

337
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:30,420
who plagued the ancient world.

338
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:33,320
I think Nekhovich created a monster virus named Chimera...

339
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:36,420
and the antivirus to kill it,

340
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,330
named Bellerophon.

341
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,200
That simple, huh?

342
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,830
Why not?

343
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:05,960
£37 million.

344
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:10,500
Now, that's a promising bid for Nekhovich's work.

345
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,370
Don't look so worried, Hugh.
We're halfway there.

346
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,840
We'll need this at the track...

347
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,180
if we're gonna get the other half.

348
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:38,620
Well, then... sorted.

349
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:48,770
Not everything.

350
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:51,280
Why do you think she's really here?

351
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,320
From her point of view or mine?

352
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:59,650
Well, she wasn't exactly gagging for it...

353
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,590
when she left you six months ago.

354
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:07,150
The question is, do you trust her?

355
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,930
One considers her timing, of course.

356
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:20,600
Getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.

357
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:25,340
Suggestive, even borderline suspicious,

358
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:28,180
but hardly conclusive.

359
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,650
Well, you've thought about it, at any rate.

360
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,030
Tell me, Hugh,

361
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,630
you don't exactly hang on Nyah's
every word and gesture, do you?

362
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,770
That's a fairly ratty nail that.

363
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:00,680
Sean, please!

364
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:06,310
Suppose she is some sort of Trojan
horse sent in by IMF to spy on us.

365
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:08,790
Why should I deny myself the pleasure of a ride or two?

366
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:15,320
Or don't you think I can learn more
from her than she can from me?

367
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,870
I do! I do! I do! I do!

368
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:20,730
Now, Hugh,

369
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,970
you must realize that some of us...

370
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,270
have the burden of sex to deal with.

371
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:30,180
And I may or may not know why she thinks she's here,

372
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:34,810
but I'm willing to take the risk, because, Hugh,

373
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,320
I am gagging for it.

374
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,910
Come on!

375
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:08,180
Darling! You won!

376
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:12,410
- I suppose I did.
- What made you pick that nag?

377
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:14,620
He's never won a bloody thing.

378
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:18,060
- ''Thief in the Night.''
- Say no more.

379
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:21,220
I'm, uh...

380
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,990
I'm off to grab a drink.
Do you still favor the Bellinis?

381
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:26,630
Mmm.

382
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:45,250
''Naturally Vain.''

383
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,310
Pardon me?

384
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:51,720
Naturally Vain... in the fourth.

385
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:55,160
Check her out. She's due.

386
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:11,570
You can speak as if I'm right by your side.

387
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:13,580
Where are you?

388
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:16,240
Mounting enclosure just off the track, 2:00.

389
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:32,760
How's it going?

390
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,670
Just like old times.

391
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,370
Just like old times?

392
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,470
Just about.

393
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:47,310
Tell me who you've run into at Ambrose's.

394
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:51,290
Near as I can tell, there's about a half
dozen other blokes about the place.

395
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:55,720
Maybe more.
Hugh Stamp, old friend of Sean's.

396
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:59,020
He's the only one I recognize.
And a bit of a creep and then some.

397
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,460
We know him. He's over your left
shoulder, looking at you right now.

398
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:07,830
Ambrose has photos of newspapers
with money piled on them.

399
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,800
Thirty seven million on the London Times.

400
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,170
What's that about?

401
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,730
Bids from possible Chimera buyers.

402
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:30,450
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar.

403
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:34,720
Big bloke. Ginger hair.
They're into something.

404
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,390
- Who is this guy?
- Checking now, Ethan.

405
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:54,780
John McCloy, CEO Biocyte Pharmaceuticals.

406
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:57,680
In 1989, acquired Biocyte in a hostile takeover.

407
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,380
He was Nekhovich's boss.

408
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,890
Right. He worked for him as a research scientist at Biocyte.

409
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,920
Ambrose is showing something
to McCloy on a digital camera.

410
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,200
Whatever McCloy's looking at, he's not happy about it.

411
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,140
Ambrose just pulled...

412
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,210
the camera's memory card and put it into an envelope.

413
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:32,980
Put it in his inner left jacket pocket.

414
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,490
Confirm left jacket pocket.

415
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,150
Roger that.

416
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:44,400
Nyah. Nyah, Ambrose is on his way back to you.

417
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,130
- There's an envelope inside...
- His left jacket pocket.

418
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,800
That's right.

419
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:53,330
- Where do I meet you?
- Betting table 12, off the paddock.

420
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:57,070
- Are you sure you're up to this?
- I'll muddle through.

421
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,810
- There you are!
- See anything you like?

422
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,410
Well, yeah. ''Naturally Vain.''

423
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:07,110
But they're about to close the betting, and I haven't a bean.

424
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:10,090
- Nyah!
- Would you mind terribly?

425
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,030
Not at all. But, um, you are gonna pay for it.

426
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:18,000
- And with interest.
- I have no doubt.

427
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:22,400
Hold on.

428
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,880
Put down a thousand for me.

429
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,320
- To win?
- What else?

430
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,850
-Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
-No worries, mate.

431
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:53,610
Luther, digital camera ready to transmit.

432
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,620
Betting table 12.

433
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,030
- There you go.
- Fine.

434
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:15,700
Oh, sorry about that, mate.

435
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,440
Say again?

436
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:24,780
Whatever you're about, in future, watch your step.

437
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:27,510
Never know who you might run into.

438
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:31,210
So where's the loo?

439
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:35,660
Thanks, mate.

440
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,840
How'd you do?

441
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,480
Don't turn around.

442
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,610
I managed.

443
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,150
You turned around.

444
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:14,530
What are you gonna do?
Spank me?

445
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:41,520
I'm booted up.
Go, Ethan.

446
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,570
Are you getting this?

447
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:04,470
''Sergei Gradski.

448
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:07,450
20 hours after exposure.''

449
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,320
God.

450
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:57,630
Stamp 's out of the loo.

451
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:00,640
He's coming out of the tunnel, heading your way, mate.

452
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,330
- I want you out of Ambrose's place.
- What are you talking about?

453
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:06,810
What's happened?
What did you see?

454
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:11,970
Okay, he's coming up behind you, Ethan.

455
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:15,780
You've done your job.
I want you out of Australia.

456
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:18,180
- Thirty steps.
- How do you suggest I go about it?

457
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:21,620
He's touched your heart.
You need to think it over.

458
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:24,180
Fifteen, fourteen, twelve, eleven.

459
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,250
I want you out of there now.
Give me the earpiece.

460
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:30,130
- Nine, Ethan. Eight.
- If you don't get out of there,

461
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,000
I'm coming in and getting you out.

462
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,940
Ethan, get out of there!

463
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:39,670
You placed your bet, ma'am?

464
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:43,540
Just.

465
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:47,170
Horses are ready to race.

466
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:50,240
They're off!

467
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,200
Come on! Come on! Your nag's making
a run for it on the outside!

468
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:06,560
Come on! Come on!

469
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:11,830
You picked another winner!

470
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:21,910
I thought you were going to dinner.

471
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:25,250
Hugh, take care of the Nekhovich memory card.

472
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,290
Where is it?

473
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:33,460
In the envelope in my jacket pocket.

474
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:38,560
My right jacket pocket.

475
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,770
We at our state-of-the-art solar-powered Biocyte building,

476
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,210
recognize that eternal vigilance is the price of health,

477
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:49,540
whether it's funding the teaching center
at the Royal Prince Edward Hospital,

478
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:52,100
removing aerosol products from the market...

479
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:55,350
or braving the influenza quarantine
at Bruny Island late last month.

480
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:59,880
At Biocyte, your life is our life's work.

481
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:04,420
We've got an opportunity here.

482
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:08,390
I'm not going to miss it.

483
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,720
George, take me home.

484
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,640
George?

485
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:04,310
George!

486
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,090
What the hell?

487
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:20,790
George!

488
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:30,370
George! George!

489
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,810
Sean?

490
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:44,250
Sean?

491
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:24,180
Shhh.

492
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:27,790
Easy.

493
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,790
Oh, Ethan.

494
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,850
Are you okay?

495
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:34,530
Yeah, I am now.

496
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:24,240
- What is this?
- A visit from an old friend.

497
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:29,150
You crashed on the plane. You're dead.

498
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:33,590
Dead, certainly. But dead is a little extreme.

499
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,850
On the other hand, when my colleague
Gradski had your pulse...

500
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:43,530
and your blood pressure, he had less than a day to live.

501
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:50,440
You are infected with Chimera, my friend.

502
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:56,670
No use, my friend.

503
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:00,580
The medical staff wants no part of this.

504
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:04,090
Doctors don't fancy the idea of dying
any more than anybody else.

505
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,750
How could I possibly be infected?

506
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:11,420
That's exactly what Gradski said 27 hours before he died.

507
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:15,800
You've got the antidote, you miserable bastard!

508
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:18,170
- You stole Bellerophon! All of it!
- My, my, my.

509
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,760
I need it! I need it now, you whacked-out Russian Gypsy!

510
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:26,870
And what about Gradski, who you
deliberately infected with Chimera?

511
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:28,540
How was I to know they needed...

512
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:30,450
to be treated with Bellerophon within 20 hours?

513
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:34,610
- By asking me.
- You still don't get it, do you?

514
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:38,890
I needed to know just how bad
the disease was in the real world,

515
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,290
not just the lab.

516
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,090
You were genetically splicing together strains of influenza...

517
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,830
to create a cure for all influenzas.

518
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:50,630
But you were also creating a disease so terrible in Chimera,

519
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,070
the cure would be priceless.

520
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:56,300
I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.

521
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:58,670
It's not that difficult to understand, is it?

522
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:02,940
Look, I've got the virus.
You've got the cure.

523
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:05,180
I need them both.

524
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:07,840
Time was a shot of penicillin would knock off...

525
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,220
every bloody bug in the zoo. Not anymore.

526
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:15,090
If I couldn't make money killing the microscopic little shits out there,

527
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:19,120
well, you'd help me put one out there
that I could make money on.

528
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,530
Well, there it is.
I've confessed.

529
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,730
I, John C. McCloy,

530
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,070
am in business to make money.

531
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:34,410
Now, forget any deal you may have
made with that thug Ambrose.

532
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,140
Get me treated, and let's go back to work.

533
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:40,310
You know,

534
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:44,450
I think it's a little late for that.

535
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:48,690
Do give my regards to Gradski...

536
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,920
if you see him.

537
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:03,510
Well...

538
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,510
I've heard...

539
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:14,340
all I need to hear.

540
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,620
Nyah...

541
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:24,460
it's imperative that we do nothing to alarm Ambrose.

542
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:27,000
What?

543
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:29,860
You told me to get out of there as soon as possible.

544
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:33,600
-I thought you were here to collect me!
-Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

545
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:37,300
Listen to me.
There's no time to talk.

546
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:42,040
It is critical, absolutely critical,

547
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:45,950
that you do whatever Ambrose asks.

548
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,150
Do you understand me?

549
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:57,860
Don't worry.

550
01:02:57,930 --> 01:03:02,160
It will all be over...
very soon.

551
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:11,260
That's a promise.

552
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,700
Go on.

553
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,460
Go on. Off you go.

554
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,420
Luther, we know this much.
Nekhovich gets on a plane...

555
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,260
to go to the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta.

556
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:58,360
He's carrying a virus he created, Chimera,

557
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,570
and the cure for that virus, Bellerophon.

558
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,670
Ambrose doesn't have the virus.

559
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:08,680
That's why Ambrose needs McCloy.

560
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:13,640
So we go into Biocyte, kill Chimera,

561
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,680
Ambrose has a cure without a disease,

562
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,020
and we're home free.

563
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:24,290
You were right. Hunt stung McCloy tonight.

564
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:26,660
So he knows.

565
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:31,230
He'll be going into Biocyte.

566
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:35,770
Good. Then we'll know where he'll be, don't we?

567
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:40,810
Well done, Hugh.

568
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,850
Well done.

569
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:57,800
Oi! You're home, mate. Home.

570
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:02,700
Where's George?

571
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:04,800
My regular driver?
Where is he?

572
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:07,570
He's gone home sick.
Touch of the flu.

573
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:12,480
-Is the building up and running yet?
-Mmm.

574
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:20,190
-That's not exactly it.
-Sorry, but this is a Biocyte facility.

575
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:23,660
Their storage structure.
I'll have it up in a minute.

576
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:29,760
- Okay, take a look at this.
- Start from the inside out.

577
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:32,990
All storage and production of Chimera is done here,

578
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:35,730
in this lab on the 42nd floor.

579
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,830
Hunt's target will be the Chimera,

580
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:43,840
stored and manufactured at Biocyte on the 42nd floor.

581
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:48,540
If you look at Hunt's operational history, and I have,

582
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:52,920
he invariably favors misdirection over confrontation.

583
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:57,580
He'll never break into Biocyte from
the bottom where security is heaviest.

584
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:59,850
No garage entrances.

585
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:04,490
Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.

586
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:08,000
Not goin' in from the ground.
Show me the atrium.

587
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:12,400
The atrium?
One of a kind.

588
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:15,240
Runs down through the center of the building.

589
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:18,800
Provides 24-hournaturallight via
mirrors and daylight storage cells.

590
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,280
Optimal growing conditions for the virus.

591
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:24,580
Ends in a glass floor which doubles
as part of the lab ceiling.

592
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:32,120
Uh-uh. The atrium roof closes at sundown.

593
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:35,590
And if the louvers are up for more
than 40 seconds at night,

594
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:37,720
the civil emergency alarms are tripped.

595
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,730
Those, even I can't stop.

596
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,400
Ethan, we have a total of 40 seconds...

597
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:46,030
to get you in and the cables out.

598
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:50,010
No, Hunt will prefer to enter Biocyte somewhere from the top...

599
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,910
where security is minimal.

600
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:55,750
He'll undoubtedly engage in some aerobatic insanity...

601
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:59,340
before he'll risk harming a hair on a security guard's head.

602
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:17,100
- Check-check. Got copy?
- You're five-by-five.

603
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:23,030
Luther, how we doin'?

604
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:26,210
Not there yet, Ethan. I'll give you the word.

605
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,650
Billy, ready to go?

606
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,620
Okay, package away in five...

607
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:38,660
I'm not ready. The louvers aren't moving.

608
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:41,020
Come on, Luther! We gotta go!

609
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,960
Wait, there's a glitch in the access code.

610
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:55,170
Luther, we're out of time. On the count.

611
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,410
Please, baby, open up, open up.

612
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,470
- Five, four,
- Come on!

613
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:03,780
three, two, one!

614
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:06,320
- I'm going now!
- Ethan, wait!

615
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:45,890
Twenty five, twenty four, twenty three,

616
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:49,950
twenty two, twenty one, twenty.

617
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:53,400
Ethan, you've got 19 seconds to clear the cable.

618
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,050
Okay, retracting cable!

619
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:11,040
Come on!

620
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:15,020
Nine, eight, seven, six,

621
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:18,620
five, four, three, two...

622
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:23,230
Cable's clear!

623
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:40,380
Transponder activated.
Reading package and cable clear.

624
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:51,050
He'll breach the lab at the only possible time,

625
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:54,150
whether you break in from the ground or the roof.

626
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:57,200
It's 2300 hours, one minute...

627
01:09:57,270 --> 01:10:00,830
when the air filtration generators will
cover the sound of Hunt's break-in...

628
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:03,630
and the rotating guards make the building vulnerable...

629
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:05,370
to our break-in from below.

630
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:09,870
Ethan, the generator's about to go active.

631
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:13,870
Just a friendly reminder. We'll be
out of contact for eight minutes.

632
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,800
I'm betting Hunt will destroy Chimera...

633
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:51,770
rather than attempt to preserve any part of it.

634
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,500
He'll have to do it in two places.

635
01:10:54,580 --> 01:11:00,040
First, the incubation room where the growth vials are kept.

636
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:05,950
And finally, in the inoculation chamber...

637
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:10,690
holding the last remaining Chimera
virus in three injection guns.

638
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:15,460
He won't be allowed to destroy the virus in those guns.

639
01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:33,280
What's this?
You're on time, for once?

640
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:35,410
Not exactly, sport.

641
01:11:40,990 --> 01:11:44,190
John C. McCloy.

642
01:12:04,010 --> 01:12:06,910
Billy, I think we've got a problem.

643
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:10,580
Nyah's on the wing up early. Billy, do you copy?

644
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:13,590
Yeah, I got you, Luther.
Sorry, exactly where is she?

645
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:16,450
- In the building.
- Say again, mate.

646
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:19,360
Sounds like you're saying she's in the building.

647
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:21,860
I am. She is.

648
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:25,800
Uh, well, then she's not likely to be alone, is she, mate?

649
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:28,060
She's in the elevator, headed towards Ethan.

650
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,300
The question is...
How many of them?

651
01:12:30,370 --> 01:12:32,810
I can't get through to Ethan, not till the generators go.

652
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,070
- Yeah, well, when's that?
- Not for another...

653
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:37,140
five-and-a-half minutes.

654
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:16,650
Chimera in vitro pH and temperature level...

655
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:19,480
outside optimal range.

656
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:23,250
Chimera in vitro pH and temperature level...

657
01:13:23,330 --> 01:13:25,420
outside optimal range.

658
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:29,830
Chimera working seed stock pH at critical level.

659
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:33,200
Alert. Chimera stock life threatened.

660
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:37,760
Alert. Chimera stock life terminated.

661
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:45,570
Come on, Ethan. Come on.

662
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:04,130
Subject is contaminant-free.

663
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,500
Zero contaminant factor.

664
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:20,180
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

665
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:24,020
Luther, what the hell can we do?

666
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:26,110
What can we do?

667
01:14:26,190 --> 01:14:30,150
Hope he kills all the bugs before
the yellow dot gets to the red one.

668
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,740
However we travel,

669
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:27,980
I must arrive at my destination
within 20 hours of departure.

670
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:35,120
How was I to know that he needed to be treated...

671
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:38,130
with Bellerophon within 20 hours?

672
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:02,950
Get him.

673
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:27,470
How much longer before you can reach him?

674
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:30,380
We've got 29 seconds before the generators turn off,

675
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:32,380
then Ethan will be back on-line.

676
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,750
Ahh!

677
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:21,840
Luther! Luther!

678
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:55,370
Hold your fire!

679
01:17:55,450 --> 01:17:58,010
Hold your fire, damn it!

680
01:18:12,130 --> 01:18:15,360
Well, Hunt...

681
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:17,700
how've you been?

682
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,340
Fighting a bit of a cold.

683
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:24,570
Aww.

684
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:30,410
You know, that was the hardest part
of having to portray you...

685
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:34,710
grinning like an idiot every 15 minutes.

686
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:38,120
I would've thought the hardest part was
curbing that pressing need of yours...

687
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:40,160
to get your gun off.

688
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:43,390
You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747...

689
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:45,980
you never figured out where Chimera really was.

690
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:48,590
- I knew where it was.
- Oh.

691
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:51,600
Then you knew the only way Nekhovich
could smuggle the live virus...

692
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:55,430
is by injecting himself and using his own
bloodstream as a petri dish.

693
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:58,530
You knew that... while you were knocking him off,

694
01:18:58,610 --> 01:19:01,540
destroying the very thing you came for.

695
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:11,590
Stop! Put a sock in it!

696
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:18,420
Hit that bloody gun, and you'll spray
the virus all over the place!

697
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:21,790
There it is, guys.

698
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:24,990
The last of it.

699
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:27,230
What was the top bid?

700
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:30,330
Why? You gonna make me a better offer?

701
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:33,570
Than £37 million? Not really.

702
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:36,340
Oh!

703
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:40,680
Somebody has been slipping you our mail.

704
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:44,950
Come on out here, you bad girl.

705
01:19:56,730 --> 01:20:01,930
Sean, she doesn't belong here. Let her go.

706
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:05,270
She wouldn't be here...

707
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:08,610
if it wasn't for you, Hunt.

708
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:19,940
From this moment, you are responsible
for what happens to her.

709
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:23,020
And if you're looking out for her well-being,

710
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:28,030
I suggest you advise her to pick up
the injection gun and bring it to me.

711
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:31,070
Ball's in your court, Hunt.

712
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:42,800
Nyah's in the building. Do you copy?

713
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,040
Thank you.

714
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,360
How do you know he won't shoot
you the minute he's got it?

715
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:07,430
Please. One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions.

716
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:11,100
You know women, mate.
Like monkeys they are.

717
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:15,240
Won't let go of one branch till they get a grip on the next!

718
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:20,220
Get it, Nyah. I'll cover you.

719
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:55,820
I am waiting.

720
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,630
Things haven't exactly worked out the
way you thought they would, Ethan.

721
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:13,430
Sorry.

722
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:32,110
You bitch!

723
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:51,800
You're not gonna shoot me, Sean. Not this bitch.

724
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:55,500
'Cause she's worth £37 million.

725
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:29,910
- What did you think you were doing?
- I wasn't thinking!

726
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:33,350
Just trying to stop you from getting hurt, that's all!

727
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:36,720
You who don't have a conscience.

728
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:38,720
I guess I lied.

729
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:09,650
You can't get us both out of here, can you?

730
01:24:22,230 --> 01:24:24,200
I'm infected with Chimera.

731
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:27,000
You know you don't have a choice. Just do it.

732
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:30,340
Do it now!

733
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:54,130
We've got 19 hours and 58 minutes!

734
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:57,600
I'll get Bellerophon into your system before then!

735
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:05,140
Just stay alive!
I'm not going to lose you!

736
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:17,310
Feel like pleading for your life?

737
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:25,820
Well, then, how about dying...

738
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:29,490
so you can make me a lot of money?

739
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:38,830
In just a few hours time, you can be assured...

740
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:42,860
of going down in history as the Typhoid Mary of Oz.

741
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:46,480
G'day.

742
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:53,050
There's not a chance of locating Nyah
until can access the satellite.

743
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:56,680
And there's not a chance of doing that
until I can get this computer fixed.

744
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,020
How much time does she have left?

745
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:02,820
Not long. But whatever happens,
Nyah will take care of Nyah.

746
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:05,190
-What do you mean?
-Unless we dose her with Bellerophon,

747
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:08,030
Nyah will kill herself.

748
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:10,260
So first things first.

749
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:07,790
Ethan, Ambrose and his team have arrived...

750
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:10,260
over the bridge, and Nyah's not with him, mate.

751
01:28:10,330 --> 01:28:12,260
Copy that.

752
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:22,770
You all right, mate? Looks like pretty
heavy security from here.

753
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:26,900
What's it look like from there?

754
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:28,910
Risky.

755
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:50,490
Simon? Simon!

756
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:53,160
Stay here.

757
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:11,980
Breached the structure at the 10:00 grating.

758
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:27,790
It's a DNA match.
The blood's loaded with Chimera.

759
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:38,570
And they certainly have Bellerophon.

760
01:30:40,610 --> 01:30:43,050
Well, then you've got both the virus and the antivirus,

761
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:45,380
which means I've got 30 million for you.

762
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:49,980
Not exactly.
We don't want just your cash.

763
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:54,120
- What do you want?
- Stock, Mr. McCloy.

764
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:58,750
Stock options, to be a little more precise.

765
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:09,670
Cut her loose... right in the center of town.

766
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:12,010
The more crowded the better.

767
01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:17,200
Ethan, just picked up an Ambrose call.
Nyah's been dropped off.

768
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:20,710
- Where is she?
- Somewhere in Sydney.

769
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:34,950
Somewhere in Sydney?
Care to harden the target?

770
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:36,590
I can't until...

771
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:38,890
I can get the GPS up on our computer. It's down.

772
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:43,590
The clock is ticking.

773
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:46,330
How quickly can you manufacture more of the antivirus?

774
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:48,740
No time at all, once I've got it.

775
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:52,970
Good. Biocyte stock is just a few weeks
away from going through the roof.

776
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:55,340
- What are you talking about?
- An outbreak of Chimera.

777
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:59,410
- Where?
- Downtown Sydney, for a start.

778
01:31:59,490 --> 01:32:01,420
You create the supply, Mr. McCloy.

779
01:32:01,490 --> 01:32:03,420
We've just created the demand.

780
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:05,420
Three million people in Sydney...

781
01:32:05,490 --> 01:32:07,520
and 17 million people in Australia...

782
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:10,390
are going to need Bellerophon within the next few days,

783
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:12,760
not to mention the rest of the world.

784
01:32:12,830 --> 01:32:15,300
Now, this is how it's going to work.

785
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:17,770
- Wallis, the shares outstanding are?
-93.4 million.

786
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:22,770
Which means, Mr. McCloy, we need to
get our hands on 480,000 options.

787
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:25,710
We'll borrow your 30 million to buy those options.

788
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:29,510
Your stock has never sold above $31 a share.

789
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:32,020
When your stock goes north of 200,

790
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:35,990
which it will, those options will be worth billions,

791
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:41,390
and I will own 51% of Biocyte.

792
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:44,400
This is outrageous.

793
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:47,230
I will not let you take control of my company.

794
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:50,030
Sit down.

795
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:32,770
You'll be a billionaire.
It's better than being broke.

796
01:33:32,850 --> 01:33:34,510
I have terrorists and...

797
01:33:34,580 --> 01:33:37,240
other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.

798
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:45,850
The ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy.

799
01:34:41,150 --> 01:34:44,580
Run that bastard down.

800
01:34:56,830 --> 01:35:00,990
We're running short on time, Mr. McCloy.

801
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:05,970
We have got to conclude our business.

802
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:11,170
Yes. Start the transfer.

803
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:20,340
Follow it... and let me know.

804
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:28,680
Uh!

805
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:30,980
Raise your hands very slowly.

806
01:36:31,060 --> 01:36:33,350
Sure you want me to do this?

807
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:37,920
Raise your hands very slowly.

808
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:14,430
Ethan, Ethan, do you copy? Do you copy?

809
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:21,810
Keep it going!

810
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:33,510
Sean, this rat's reached the end of the maze.

811
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:36,210
Is he alive?

812
01:37:36,290 --> 01:37:38,920
Yeah, more or less.

813
01:37:40,590 --> 01:37:42,690
Bring him to me.

814
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:44,350
Go!

815
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:54,240
Sean, transfer completed.

816
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,940
Well done, Stamp.
Well done.

817
01:38:36,890 --> 01:38:39,020
Stop mumbling!

818
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:42,260
I'm afraid he's got no choice.

819
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:44,850
I believe I broke his jaw.

820
01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:47,460
Stamp, I'm impressed.

821
01:38:47,530 --> 01:38:50,260
Right. We don't have a lot of time, Hunt.

822
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:52,770
What ever you got to say, say it now.

823
01:38:54,940 --> 01:38:58,000
How about giving us a big smile?

824
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:02,540
- No?
- What are you doing?

825
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:08,650
Get down on your knees.

826
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:15,330
Now, this is what's known...

827
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:18,130
as getting your gun off.

828
01:40:28,420 --> 01:40:30,390
There he is!

829
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:42,390
Ethan!

830
01:40:57,250 --> 01:41:00,340
Just back off and pinpoint your positions!

831
01:41:58,850 --> 01:42:01,080
Luther, clear the bridge for me!

832
01:42:04,850 --> 01:42:08,250
Hunt's heading for the bridge, coming in at 12:00 high.

833
01:42:25,070 --> 01:42:27,370
Oh, I'm mad now.

834
01:43:05,810 --> 01:43:08,110
Ha-ha!

835
01:43:37,940 --> 01:43:41,110
-You all right, mate?
-That punk put a hole in my Versace!

836
01:44:44,710 --> 01:44:47,410
Ethan, the computer's up.
I've got Nyah.

837
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:49,310
She's moved out of the city.

838
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:51,510
She's on the north head bluff approaching the cliffs.

839
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:53,780
- But I can't get a visual.
- Copy!

840
01:44:53,850 --> 01:44:56,450
She's only got a little time left!

841
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:58,790
Track ahead and pick her up!

842
01:45:05,530 --> 01:45:10,200
-I can't get a good shot.
-Ethan, we won't be able to cover you!

843
01:45:10,270 --> 01:45:13,930
My earpiece is failing!
You've got me on GPS!

844
01:45:14,010 --> 01:45:16,170
Bring her to me!

845
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:26,620
Billy, north head bluff. Haul ass.

846
01:45:53,610 --> 01:45:56,980
- Get out there and keep firing!
- I can't see anything!

847
01:45:57,050 --> 01:46:00,580
Slow down, mate!
Slow down!

848
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:01,580
Range is 2K.

849
01:50:53,590 --> 01:50:55,790
Ahhh!

850
01:51:34,970 --> 01:51:38,300
Go ahead.
Use it, Hunt.

851
01:51:38,370 --> 01:51:41,310
It's not a bad way to go.

852
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:45,070
It's a lot better than the way that bitch is gonna die.

853
01:52:32,030 --> 01:52:34,090
Hey, there she is!

854
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:41,200
Hunt!

855
01:54:43,930 --> 01:54:46,870
You should've killed me.

856
01:56:26,570 --> 01:56:28,830
Miss Hall's blood, it appears,

857
01:56:28,910 --> 01:56:31,570
has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus,

858
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:33,580
not even antibodies.

859
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:35,910
Yes. I gathered as much.

860
01:56:35,980 --> 01:56:38,910
But you were under specific instructions, Mr. Hunt,

861
01:56:38,980 --> 01:56:41,970
to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.

862
01:56:42,050 --> 01:56:45,890
I'd be very interested to know how,
after you managed this recovery,

863
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:48,550
it subsequently got destroyed.

864
01:56:48,630 --> 01:56:52,120
By fire. It's the best way, really.

865
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:55,760
Oh. Well, Mr. Hunt,

866
01:56:55,830 --> 01:57:03,630
as for Miss Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal
record will certainly be expunged.

867
01:57:03,710 --> 01:57:07,110
Wiped out. I'm assuming you approve.

868
01:57:10,180 --> 01:57:12,110
I do.

869
01:57:12,180 --> 01:57:16,350
Yeah. Where is she now, by the way? Any idea?

870
01:57:16,420 --> 01:57:19,120
I don't know.
Not exactly.

871
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:22,380
So, what are your plans?

872
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:26,400
I don't know. Uh, some sort of vacation.

873
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:29,020
I'll let you know where I'm going.

874
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:32,130
You don't have to do that.

875
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:35,040
It wouldn't be a vacation if you did.

876
01:58:25,190 --> 01:58:27,120
Let's get lost.
