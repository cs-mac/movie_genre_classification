1
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,112
Wow! Bob, take it easy!

2
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,399
- Easy? Where does that get you?
- On dry land, I hope!

3
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,839
It's doing 150 or better.

4
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,232
He's coming in, believe it or not.

5
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,631
Help Miss Daniels off.

6
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,833
- I'm making another run.
- It's not safe out there!

7
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,399
That's why you'll just watch.

8
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,110
- It's starting to kick up, Mr Merrick.
- You keep this engine toned, that's all.

9
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,548
What's wrong with him?
Hasn't he got any brains?

10
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,518
He doesn't have to.
He's got four million bucks.

11
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,435
He must be doing better than 180 now.

12
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,159
<i>I knew that would happen!</i>

13
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,676
Miss Daniels, phone Emergency
right away! Come on, Joe, hurry up!

14
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,757
- He's starting to breathe, Bill.
- I'll switch off the ventilator.

15
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,832
- That was a close one.
- Bob Merrick just lives right.

16
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,991
- Is that the ambulance?
- Yeah. Nothing more we can do here now.

17
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,153
All right, everybody. There's nothing
to see. You can take off now.

18
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,516
<i>181. Come in, 181. 181, come in.</i>

19
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,389
Go ahead.

20
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,837
<i>Return the resuscitator to Dr Phillips'
home as soon as possible. Emergency.</i>

21
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,319
181. Understood.

22
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,994
They want the resuscitator
right away, Bill.

23
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,834
Leaving assignment now. Victim
being picked up by a hospital ambulance.

24
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,434
<i>- Return the resuscitator...
- Yes, I know.</i>

25
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,080
Returning the resuscitator to Dr Phillips.

26
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,150
- Did they say why they wanted it?
- Just to rush it back to Dr Phillips' house.

27
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,230
Hurry. Dr Phillips. An accident.

28
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,356
- What's the trouble, Miss Ashford?
- Take it inside to Dr Phillips, Bill.

29
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,955
- Did you see Mrs Phillips' car anywhere?
- No, we didn't.

30
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,474
Oh, I hope they get back in time.

31
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,551
181 reporting. We're at Dr Phillips'.

32
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,950
Is it too chilly to eat on the terrace? We
could fix the tables with hurricane lamps.

33
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,477
Helen, it's a lot of swank for practically
no reason. You bought out half the town.

34
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,836
Isn't a wedding anniversary
enough reason to have a party?

35
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,912
<i>- Wait till you get married.
- But a six months anniversary?</i>

36
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,198
I've never been married six months before
and I want to tell the world that I love it.

37
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,033
Shouldn't you have given Dad some hint?

38
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,556
I should say not!
He'd have nine reasons at the hospital

39
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,631
why he couldn't come home for dinner.

40
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,951
Wayne can invent an emergency
operation at the drop of a hat

41
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,998
if he knows he's to be
the guest of honour at a dinner party.

42
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,275
<i>Now what's the matter?</i>

43
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,033
I was just thinking
of the toast I'd give you two.

44
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,035
To Wayne Phillips, a great surgeon,
a fine man and my wonderful father.

45
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,714
And to you.
Love and affection to my mother.

46
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,553
Mother? Oh, Joyce, you wouldn't.

47
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,713
You married my father. You're certainly
the only mother I've ever known.

48
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,950
And I'm all in favour of the arrangement.

49
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,391
I sure feel sorry for them.

50
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,277
Oh, Joyce, it's so pleasant. We can have
dinner outside without any trouble at all.

51
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,830
- Helen...
- Nancy, what are you doing over here?

52
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,070
- Oh, Helen...
- What's the matter?

53
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,593
- It's Wayne.
- What?

54
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,830
He's had an accident.
Dr Dodge is with him.

55
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,480
- Where is he?
- Here. Oh, Helen...

56
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,030
Helen...

57
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,829
<i>- Wayne had an attack and...
- No.</i>

58
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,911
Dad!

59
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,311
Those poor girls.

60
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,556
He was such a wonderful man.

61
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,756
He did so much for people.

62
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,033
Why, Dr Dodge? Why?

63
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,112
How many times
I've been asked that question.

64
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,430
I've never learned the answer.

65
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,508
Nancy, you go in with her.

66
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,196
Joyce, I know there's nothing I can say.

67
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,709
What happened, Derwin?

68
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,759
Nancy and I had come from the hospital
to go sailing with him this afternoon.

69
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,389
He must have had the occlusion
just a few minutes before we got here.

70
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,950
We saw him down at the pier,
all slumped over.

71
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,759
- The resuscitator didn't help at all?
- No. It wasn't here.

72
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,637
- It wasn't here?!
- No.

73
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,475
But Dad's kept it here for years because
he had a coronary. You knew that.

74
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,949
In heaven's name, where was it?

75
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,952
Bob Merrick capsized his boat
at the other end of the lake.

76
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,033
- The police came for it just before this...
- Bob Merrick!

77
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,188
Oh, you don't know him.
I do.

78
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,230
He's a stupid, spoilt darn fool.

79
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,439
And now, to think Bob Merrick is alive
because of Dad's resuscitator

80
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,750
and Dad is dead...

81
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,831
I could kill him!

82
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,551
Helen...

83
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,711
Helen...

84
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,998
I loved him so much, Derwin.

85
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,640
With all my heart.

86
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,429
And we only had
these few short months together.

87
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,435
I don't know how you're supposed to do it.
Just take the barge out and get her up.

88
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,034
Don't bother me with excuses. Get it done.

89
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,759
When does Campbell get in from Detroit?

90
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,071
I don't want anybody else
touching those engines. Don't argue.

91
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,551
- If I may take your temperature.
- Nonsense. I'm not even lukewarm.

92
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,111
That's better. And have Jerry call me
as soon as he hears about the insurance.

93
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,715
- Am I getting out of here today?
- The very instant you're able to leave

94
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,995
we shall be happy to sign your discharge.

95
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,072
- But first...
- This is ridiculous. I'm perfectly healthy.

96
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,472
A small respiratory infection,
a slight concussion, but no subdural clot.

97
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,758
A subdural clot, Doctor, is a haematoma
anywhere in the cranial cavity.

98
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,719
Thank you. I merely wondered where
you acquired that piece of information.

99
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,633
Let me have a line.
I was in med school when my father died.

100
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,312
<i>I haven't wasted all my time.</i>

101
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,630
Why did you quit?
Too rough for a Merrick?

102
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,234
I'll tell you why. My father died at 42...

103
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,992
Hello. Val?

104
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,479
Who?

105
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,959
No.

106
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,158
Suddenly it seemed sensible to enjoy life
while I could. Let me have another line.

107
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,471
My, how you've succeeded

108
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,151
Hello, Val.
How have you been, baby?

109
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,593
Don't go in, Nancy. You have to make
a formal request to take his temperature.

110
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,274
When I think Dr Phillips died
so that he could live.

111
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,635
Yes. What a complete waste.

112
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,388
- Have you talked to Helen today?
- No. Not since yesterday.

113
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,916
She's coming over this morning
to go through the doctor's things.

114
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,276
You can count on it, baby.
It's a date. Goodbye.

115
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,518
Would you do me a favour? Get Dr Phillips
down here to look at me so I can get out.

116
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,876
- Here.
- Look, I haven't got a temperature.

117
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,110
It's immaterial to me, Mr Merrick,

118
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,955
but I'm going to take your temperature
one way or another.

119
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,759
- A human being.
- Under the tongue, please.

120
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,831
Where have you been all week?

121
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,798
What kind of an establishment is this?
Will you tell me?

122
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,429
I've been here five days
and I'm treated like a leper. No visitors.

123
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,159
- It seemed advisable.
- My doctor doesn't even come.

124
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,629
No, when Dr Albert talked to Dr Dodge,

125
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,599
he agreed the case didn't warrant his
coming up. He's very busy in New York.

126
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,036
Then why don't I get Wayne Phillips?
It's his hospital, isn't it?

127
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,395
It's obvious I get to pay his bill.

128
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,315
- Don't look shocked. I'm used to it.
- I wasn't shocked, Mr Merrick.

129
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,994
- I was only thinking.
- You were thinking what?

130
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,073
I was thinking, when your father left you
the Merrick Motor Company millions,

131
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,153
what a pity he couldn't also bequeath you
a little common courtesy.

132
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,630
I don't know where you got
those pyjamas, or these cigarettes -

133
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,553
your pharyngitis
is bad enough without them.

134
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,031
In words of one syllable, Mr Merrick,
you talk too much.

135
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,240
Now that's settled, how about getting Doc
Phillips to give me my separation papers?

136
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,199
The reason the staff
may have seemed so distant, Mr Merrick,

137
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,999
is that Dr Phillips died a few days ago.

138
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,870
It was rather sudden
and he was quite admired by all of us.

139
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,476
- All you had to do was tell me.
- It hasn't been easy to talk about.

140
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,950
When will I get out? I have
too many things to do that can't wait.

141
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,838
I can't say. Perhaps in a few days.

142
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,039
Wanna bet?

143
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,315
Brightwood Hospital.

144
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,996
- Miss Phillips, these came this morning.
- Oh, thanks.

145
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,594
- Is Mrs Phillips in?
- Yes, she is.

146
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,753
They're still coming. Amazing, isn't it?
Oh, I'm sorry.

147
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,072
Yes, thank you.
All right, we'll see you. Goodbye.

148
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,478
That was Tom.
He's in the village and coming over.

149
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,915
He seemed a little more urgent
than he had to be.

150
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,118
I suspect that lawyer of mine just wanted
to spend the afternoon with you.

151
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,749
Dottore Vittorio Laradetti, Rome.

152
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,118
I had no idea there were so many people
who respected Dad so much.

153
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,556
And who felt so much in his debt.
From all over the country.

154
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,631
From all over the world.

155
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,238
Listen to this, Joyce.

156
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,155
"Dear Mrs Dr Phillips, you don't know me,
but I owe everything to Dr Phillips. "

157
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,151
<i>Yes, come in.</i>

158
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,677
Sorry, but there's another lady
here to see you. A Mrs Eden.

159
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,751
She says she has to talk to you.

160
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,719
- Want me to talk to her?
- No... Have her come in, Nancy.

161
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,313
- Mrs Eden.
- Thank you.

162
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,789
- Mrs Phillips, Mrs Eden.
- How do you do, my dear?

163
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,838
- How do you do? Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

164
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,676
We'll have to be very firm
about visitors, for her sake.

165
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,753
Yesterday afternoon there were eight.
This morning it's beginning again.

166
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,752
Apparently Dad had helped them
meet some crisis.

167
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,116
- Money?
- No, not always. Sometimes just advice.

168
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,671
But when you try to pin them down
as to how they became indebted to Dad,

169
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:20,153
they stammer and dodge, as though they
belonged with him to some secret society.

170
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,754
It's strange.

171
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,118
Dr Phillips insisted that it be kept secret.

172
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,159
But now that he's dead,
I suppose I can talk about it, don't you?

173
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,389
Certainly.

174
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,395
It came to $4,000 all together,
and I want to pay you back.

175
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,199
Why didn't you return it to Dr Phillips?

176
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,192
Oh, my dear, I tried so many times,
but he wouldn't take it.

177
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,272
He'd become excited and say,
"You haven't told anyone?"

178
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,635
I'd say, "Of course not. You told us not to. "

179
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,158
Then he'd say, "That's right, Mrs Eden.
Any help I give you is just between us. "

180
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,870
- And he wouldn't let you repay it?
- He said he couldn't because...

181
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,474
he'd already used it all up.

182
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,075
And then he'd say to invest it.
"Invest in what?" I'd say.

183
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,515
And he'd say, "Any poor devil. "

184
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,034
Wasn't that strange?

185
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,113
Mrs Eden, what did he mean when he said
"used it all up"?

186
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,192
I've tried to think so many times.

187
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,919
<i>Don't you know, Mrs Phillips?</i>

188
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,154
No. It's very odd. In four letters this week,
there's exactly the same expression.

189
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,073
But it is a debt,
and I want to take care of it.

190
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,628
You don't owe me anything, Mrs Eden.

191
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,235
If Dr Phillips couldn't accept this,
then neither can I.

192
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,199
Well... if that's what you want,
Mrs Phillips, but...

193
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,670
You keep it and use it...
for any poor devil.

194
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,910
All right.

195
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,629
He was a very remarkable man,
wasn't he?

196
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,711
Yes, he was.

197
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,512
Perhaps more remarkable
than any of us knew.

198
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,753
- Hello, darling. How are you?
- Much better now that you're here.

199
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,912
- How's Helen feeling?
- Oh, you know.

200
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,551
- Oh, golly, Tom. I've missed you.
- I've missed you too.

201
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,349
Hello, Tom.
Thank you for coming all this way.

202
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,638
Helen. I wish I'd been able to
come up Sunday, but I've been swamped.

203
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,315
I wanted to talk to both of you
about the estate.

204
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,960
The estate? I hadn't even thought of it.

205
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,713
Neither had I.
I should have been a better attorney.

206
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,954
I've made a complete survey
of Wayne's finances, and I...

207
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,956
<i>- I doubt you'll have any money at all.
- Not even insurance?</i>

208
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,113
Wayne had a $100,000 policy,
but he borrowed the maximum on it.

209
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,159
- The rest might pay the taxes and debts.
- But what happened, Tom?

210
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,038
But some of Dad's fees -
the Talleyrand operation...

211
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,875
When Wayne removed the neoplasm from
the Talleyrand boy, he received $25,000.

212
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,636
It was all withdrawn within seven weeks
in four cheques, all made out to "cash".

213
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,111
The account's full of cash withdrawals.
Where did all this money go, Helen?

214
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,431
Wayne didn't discuss money with me.
I really wouldn't know.

215
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,637
That leaves you and Joyce
with the house and little else.

216
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,837
And the hospital
is liable to be in very rocky shape too.

217
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,195
Can't something be worked out, Tom?

218
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,955
I want to go over his records and find out
what other assets he might have.

219
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,429
Those you'll let me collect for you, that is.

220
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,876
And after that, well,
we'll see where you stand exactly.

221
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,838
Well, thank you very much
for all your trouble.

222
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,912
And you do as you feel best.

223
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,991
- Will you excuse me?
- Certainly.

224
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,517
I have to go to the house. The gardener's
confused about what bulbs to lift this fall.

225
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,433
I promised I'd do it.
It can't wait any longer.

226
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,159
I'll see you both at the house.

227
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,310
- Can I help?
- I suspect you could help... tremendously.

228
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,791
Are you all right?

229
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,268
Adequate as can be.

230
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,272
- Going to the village?
- Yes. Can I give you a lift?

231
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,918
You certainly can.

232
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,389
I'll make it. I'll make it.

233
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:00,676
- What seems to be the trouble?
- Long story. You wouldn't be interested.

234
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,509
You live around here?

235
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,874
Yes.

236
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,918
I should have collapsed
on one of these roads long ago.

237
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,514
- I meant it in the nicest way.
- I'm sure you did.

238
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,434
- You don't sound like it.
- I'm sorry, but I have a lot on my mind.

239
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,511
That's all right. So do I.

240
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,797
Can't we talk about it better
after I take you to lunch?

241
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,871
I think not.

242
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:34,989
Before you decide I'm just a character
who stumbled out of the woods, Miss P...

243
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,197
Monogram on your purse.
20/20. Always keep 'em open.

244
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,158
<i>My name is Phillips -
Mrs Wayne Phillips.</i>

245
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,111
Oh.

246
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,714
I'm sorry, Mrs Phillips.

247
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,475
You know,
I just heard about your husband.

248
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,872
I'm really sorry.
He must have been a really great person.

249
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,520
It's a rough way to go.

250
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,068
Maybe they'll get
another resuscitator now.

251
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,913
Resuscitator?
Did they try to use one on him?

252
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,310
We'd have had his at the house,
but there was an accident on the lake

253
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,709
and the police took it there.

254
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,916
You mean...

255
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,434
the accident Bob Merrick had?

256
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,714
Yes. Bob Merrick.

257
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,035
So...

258
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,590
Bob Merrick is alive,

259
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,433
and only because your husband...

260
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,472
<i>Let me out up here, will you?</i>

261
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,470
- Thanks.
- Are you sure you're all right?

262
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,792
He can't have just disappeared.
Miss O'Malley, flash Dr Dodge.

263
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,110
All right, thanks.

264
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,679
There's work to do.

265
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,878
<i>Have Dr Dodge
report to the front desk immediately.</i>

266
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,910
- Helen. What's the matter?
- I just gave a man a ride on the lake road.

267
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,230
He's in shock or exhausted.
He's in the car.

268
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,311
Frank, get a stretcher.

269
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,151
It's Bob Merrick.

270
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,951
Who?

271
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,355
Come on.
I want you to rest a little while, Helen.

272
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,353
It's... It just came
before I was ready for it.

273
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,431
I know, darling.

274
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,235
- I'm all right, Nancy.
- Don't talk about it.

275
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,913
Come in and lie down a little while.

276
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,839
I don't know, Nancy.
Maybe it's just as well.

277
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,313
I'll never have to see him again.

278
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,633
Brightwood Hospital.

279
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,269
Mrs Phillips?
I'm sorry, I can't ring her.

280
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,509
Yes, Mr Merrick?

281
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,397
- Is my bill ready?
- Yes, sir.

282
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,519
Mrs Phillips is in Dr Phillips' office
and she's asked me to hold her calls.

283
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,275
Thank you.
I will give Mrs Phillips your message.

284
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,551
Your bill, Mr Merrick.

285
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,471
You've answered so many questions
that have been puzzling me, Mr Randolph.

286
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,633
Several people in the last few days
have mentioned Wayne's way of life.

287
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,635
And when they talk about "using it all up",
I had no idea what they meant.

288
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,995
I'm so happy that you could tell me.

289
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,309
You don't talk much about this belief.

290
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,675
When someone's ready for it,
they accept it.

291
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,914
Perhaps Wayne felt you weren't ready -
or that you were pretty perfect without it.

292
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,797
Well, I must be going.

293
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,555
Wayne mentioned so many times
how anxious he was for me to meet you.

294
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,870
I'm sorry it was
under these circumstances.

295
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,317
I flew up from Mexico as soon as I heard.
I thought possibly I might be able to...

296
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,153
Make it a little easier for me?
Well, you have.

297
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,468
Thank you.

298
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,348
- We'll be seeing you very soon, I hope.
- Yes. I'll be back in my studio now.

299
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,630
Mrs Phillips, I want to talk to you.

300
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,188
- I'm very busy.
- Oh, I was just leaving.

301
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,033
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, and thank you.

302
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,995
You and I don't have anything
to talk about.

303
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,799
- I know how you feel about me.
- Please leave me alone.

304
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,871
Your husband was an eminent surgeon.

305
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,875
Everybody's saying that a character like
me is still around while your husband is...

306
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,951
Here.

307
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,988
- And what is that supposed to do?
- Supposed to do?

308
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,071
Most people'd be very glad to get it.

309
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,754
Will paying thousands
help you forget it happened?

310
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,992
It's all very simple to you - a cheque
can take care of anything, any time.

311
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,799
Most people would be very happy
to receive $25,000.

312
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,713
Was it my fault?
I didn't ask you for your resuscitator.

313
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,075
Smash up somebody's car,
write out a cheque.

314
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,515
Get in a mess with a showgirl,
write out a cheque.

315
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,388
And when a man dies, write out a cheque
to his widow - account paid in full.

316
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,869
- Listen...
- Leave me alone!

317
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,433
<i>When you go to Mexico City,
you must hear Rosario.</i>

318
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,559
His voice is just divine.
It does things for me.

319
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,030
Good for you.
But he doesn't sound like my type.

320
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,109
Pardon me.

321
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,397
It's one of the most beautiful things
I've ever seen.

322
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,438
- The owner must have spent a fortune.
- Good for him.

323
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,638
It's got all kinds of gadgets.
It's got... red-spoke wheels...

324
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,229
<i>What did they do to you in that joint?</i>

325
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,108
I know your big trouble, honey.
You need Val to take care of you.

326
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,033
<i>The principal difficulty seems to be,</i>

327
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,672
the anaesthetics you get in these bars are
never as effective as the customer hopes.

328
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,752
- What, honey?
- Good night, baby.

329
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,476
- How about a drink, Val?
- No, thank you.

330
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,431
- Don't you want to take me home?
- That's an interesting idea.

331
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,512
I'll call you.
So long and farewell.

332
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,273
- Yes?
- I'm sorry to bother you this time of night.

333
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,954
I just clobbered my car in the ditch. Look.

334
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,600
That's all right. Come in.

335
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,797
Thank you for your hospitality.

336
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,953
It's a nice place you have here.
A very nice place indeed.

337
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,237
- Are you all right?
- Me? Of course.

338
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,995
It takes more than pranging up a car
to incapacitate old Bob Merrick,

339
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,752
pride of the Merrick clan.

340
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,637
You're Bob Merrick, eh?

341
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,029
- Who are you?
- Edward Randolph.

342
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,999
- How do you... Who?
- It's all right. I live here.

343
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,519
Edward... may I please bother you...
for a telephone, please?

344
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,113
- Of course.
- Wait a minute.

345
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,998
Gotta call somebody
to come and pick me up.

346
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,550
- Must tell 'em to wear their safety belts.
- Right back here.

347
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,029
- Where?
- Right back here.

348
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,111
Oh.

349
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,151
Go slow.

350
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,119
Hello?

351
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,713
Hello there.

352
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,270
- Ed, did you do these pictures?
- Yes.

353
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,349
Nice.

354
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,908
As far as I'm concerned,
Art is just a guy's name.

355
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,991
- Williams?
- Shouldn't you dial?

356
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,672
Shh! Williams.

357
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,354
This is Robert Merrick Esquire.

358
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,230
I had a little trouble with my car. Would
you come over and pick me up, please?

359
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,117
Williams?

360
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,749
Don't snore, old man. Wake up.

361
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,196
Hardest thing these days,
getting good help.

362
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,352
Very nice job.

363
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,639
Where have we met?
Don't tell me, don't tell me. I met you...

364
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,234
- Is that?
- It's a portrait I did of Wayne Phillips.

365
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,311
Phillips.

366
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,111
Phillips.

367
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,518
He's the man who's haunting me.

368
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,477
You know what?

369
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,599
I almost drowned, but a resuscitator
saved me. Whose is it? Dr Phillips'.

370
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,639
They shoot me to a hospital to make
old Merrick good for another 20,000 miles.

371
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,075
Whose hospital? Dr Phillips'.

372
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,436
<i>Then I meet her. A girl.
A girl who is...</i>

373
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,670
a very beautiful girl.

374
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,230
Whose wife is she? One guess, pal.

375
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,357
- Now look here, Merrick...
- Tell me where we've met.

376
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,159
In the hospital. In Dr Phillips' office.

377
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,231
Dr Phillips.

378
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,471
You see?

379
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,555
<i>He is haunting me.</i>

380
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,199
- I'm glad you made it.
- I'm not sure I have.

381
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,271
Try this anyway.

382
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,392
Do you mind telling me what happened?

383
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,632
Oh... I wrecked the car, in a ditch.

384
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,157
Yes. The right front wheel. I called your
house and asked someone to come over.

385
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,754
- I hope you don't mind.
- Not at all.

386
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,308
- Think a shower'd help?
- I certainly do.

387
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,392
Make it a cold one.
Up those stairs and to the right.

388
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,471
Thanks a lot.

389
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,268
I hope I wasn't too much trouble last night.

390
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,920
When I pass out,
I usually like to be in my own bed.

391
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,558
No trouble.

392
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,236
Oh, I know where I saw you.
With Helen Phillips.

393
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,995
That's right, Merrick.
Will you take these?

394
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,590
- Have you known her long?
- No.

395
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,434
But Wayne Phillips
was the best friend I had.

396
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,192
Coffee's ready.

397
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,669
Yes, the portrait you did of him.

398
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,399
It's really good. You're quite a painter.

399
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,596
Well, maybe I am now.

400
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,639
If so, I have Phillips to thank.
He's the one who unlocked everything.

401
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,029
- Phillips did?
- Yes. I met him some years ago

402
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,908
when I was still trying to find my way
in painting, getting nowhere.

403
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,152
I spent my life making fairly adequate
copies of the masters.

404
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,800
I always wanted to create like they did.

405
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,075
But I just never could.

406
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,674
Until Phillips showed me
how to get what I wanted.

407
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,513
How did he do that?
How could a surgeon help?

408
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,591
Well, he taught me...

409
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,468
He showed me how to establish contact
with a source of infinite power.

410
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,472
That sounds fine. What does it mean?

411
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,835
Well, let me put it this way.

412
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,791
This lamp isn't working now.

413
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,635
It's cold, and it's dark. All the parts
are there, it's a perfect light, but...

414
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,551
- It's just not turned on.
- Right.

415
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,633
But if I turn the switch
and establish contact,

416
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,234
the bulb will draw power
from the powerhouse

417
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,232
and it'll do what it was meant to do,
which is to make light.

418
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,551
So you're saying that
people have a sort of powerhouse too.

419
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,030
<i>Establish contact with that
and you can do what you're meant to do.</i>

420
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,830
<i>- You can fulfil your destiny.
- I can turn on a light.</i>

421
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,832
I don't think that's your destiny.

422
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,151
- Do you?
- No, I guess not.

423
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,360
Assuming there is a power of some kind,
how do you establish contact with it?

424
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,399
It's very simple:
Just be of real service to people.

425
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,789
Find people who need help,
and help them.

426
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,519
But always in secret.
Never let it be known.

427
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,670
And never ask to be repaid.

428
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,115
But why does it have to be kept secret?

429
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,716
That's probably
the most important part of this belief.

430
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,030
Let's go back to the powerhouse.

431
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,318
If the wires in the dynamo
are not protected by insulation,

432
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,312
the power will be dissipated.
The same goes for us.

433
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,234
Most personalities are just grounded.
That's all that ails them.

434
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,118
I see. You mean
keeping these good deeds secret

435
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,794
is like insulating
the power of your personality.

436
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,591
- Yeah, that's near enough.
- If it works, fine. Obviously it helped you.

437
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,240
Isn't there anything in the world
that you need

438
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,993
that you haven't been able to get
in the ordinary way?

439
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,071
Not a thing.

440
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,710
Except...

441
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,633
I'd like to square myself
with Helen Phillips.

442
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,596
Oh?

443
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:24,516
But if I just help out some poor joker,
why does it follow that she'll listen to me?

444
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,876
I think you might be surprised
at what follows

445
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,428
after trying this way of life.

446
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:38,436
Well, if it's as simple as all that,
why, I'll certainly give it a chance.

447
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,713
Wait, Merrick.

448
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,998
Don't try this unless you're ready. You
can't just try it for a week like a new car.

449
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,073
And if you think you can feather
your own nest with it, just forget it.

450
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,232
Besides, this is dangerous stuff.

451
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,035
One of the first men who used it

452
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,795
went to the cross at the age of 33.

453
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,991
Excuse me.

454
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,631
- Won't you come in, please?
- I understand that Mr Merrick...

455
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,235
- I'm here, Williams.
- Good morning, Mr Merrick.

456
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,399
Well, goodbye. And thanks. You take
good care of a drunk and his hangover.

457
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,995
I ought to know how by this time.
I've been there myself.

458
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,118
Mr Merrick!
It's good to see you around again.

459
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,952
Hello, Dan.

460
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,031
No. Another look you owe me.

461
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,635
- How's the family?
- Not so hot. We lost the baby, you know.

462
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,314
- Oh?
- The missus is still in the hospital.

463
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,030
- The bills are pretty rough.
- I'm sorry to hear it, Dan.

464
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,438
- Say, Dan.
- Yes, Mr Merrick?

465
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,114
How much do you need
for all the expenses?

466
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,589
About $300 would do it.

467
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,072
- Mr Merrick...
- It's yours. On two conditions.

468
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,151
- Anything.
- Don't tell anybody.

469
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,913
- I've got to tell my wife.
- No, not even your wife.

470
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,878
And never try to pay it back.
I don't want it.

471
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,552
- Anything you say.
- Good.

472
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,871
But this is sure a funny way
to help a guy out, isn't it?

473
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,758
I think you're absolutely right.

474
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,468
- I don't believe it!
- Your order, Mr Merrick?

475
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,794
It does work.

476
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,078
Thank you, Phyllis. Joyce and I will
see you again soon. We won't hibernate.

477
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,594
- I'm glad of that.
- Goodbye.

478
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,719
Mrs Phillips. This is more than
just a coincidence. I've got to talk to you.

479
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,190
- I was just leaving.
- You have two minutes, haven't you?

480
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,876
Perhaps I wasn't as diplomatic as I could
have been, but I did mean well, really.

481
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,635
We've all been under a strain.
Sorry if I said anything I shouldn't have.

482
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,714
What I can't understand is how we've
avoided knowing each other before this.

483
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,711
It wasn't intentional, I assure you.

484
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,792
I think we ought to correct
that mistake. Don't you?

485
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,950
Of course. I'm very late.

486
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,671
Mrs Phillips.

487
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,070
We haven't decided
where we're going to have dinner tonight.

488
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,550
I have a previous engagement.
Excuse me.

489
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,434
Please don't go!

490
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,273
I'd like to ask you...
about this theory of Dr Phillips'

491
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,715
that Edward Randolph
was telling me about.

492
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,315
<i>- Why would he talk to you about it?
- I guess he believes in it.</i>

493
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,868
<i>I guess I'm starting to,
after meeting you here.</i>

494
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,871
What has meeting me got to do with it?

495
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,713
Well, I... I just did something.

496
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,270
I'm going to go find somebody
that needs a couple of thousand bucks

497
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,078
and my worries will be over.

498
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,075
I think you've twisted my husband's
beliefs into something very cheap.

499
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,151
Taxi!

500
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,871
Wait a minute!

501
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,676
- 15 Lake Drive, please.
- Mrs Phillips.

502
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,678
- I wouldn't offend you for the world.
- Just drive on.

503
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,957
- Wait here. Mrs Phillips...
- Please don't start a scene.

504
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,713
I'm only trying to tell you that...

505
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,239
Look out!

506
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,637
Brightwood Hospital.

507
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,314
The line is busy. Will you hold?

508
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,510
<i>I'll try to locate him for you.</i>

509
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,631
Brightwood Hospital.

510
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,711
I'll take a message.

511
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,156
I can connect you now.

512
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,352
Brightwood Hospital.

513
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,273
- Is there any chance at all?
- No.

514
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,033
How about the x-ray findings?

515
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,829
They leave no hope.
She's lucky to be alive.

516
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,115
Will you tell them, Nancy?

517
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,952
- All right.
- Thank you.

518
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,351
Miss Ashford...

519
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,271
Joyce.

520
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,590
She's going to live.

521
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,717
And she'll be all right in time?

522
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,598
Not completely.
There's an inoperable lesion.

523
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,989
- What is it?
- Where?

524
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,877
Well... Her eyes.

525
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,428
Tell me, Nancy. Let me have it straight.

526
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,112
She'll be blind.

527
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,760
- Blind?
- It can't be.

528
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,191
<i>Oh, no!</i>

529
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,876
- Miss Ashford, could I see her?
- Haven't you done enough?!

530
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,430
- Joyce...
- It's the truth. Why shouldn't I say it?

531
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:19,709
<i>She'll never see again, thanks to you.
Write a cheque for that, Mr Merrick!</i>

532
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,794
No, Nancy. No.

533
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,997
Darling, don't you think
if you just talk to him once...

534
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:51,358
What good would it do?
What could he possibly say?

535
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,273
And what difference would it make now?

536
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,032
I don't blame him for anything, Nancy.

537
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:04,033
It's just that I feel it's better
if I don't see him at all.

538
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,476
Well... I'll send him away.

539
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,031
I'm sorry, Mr Merrick.

540
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,271
She won't see you.

541
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,432
Nancy?

542
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,590
Yes, darling.

543
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,353
I know I'm right.

544
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,556
He'll finally give up.

545
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,112
- Your things are on the beach, Helen.
- Thank you, Nancy.

546
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,430
- Is Judy there?
- Yes. She's waiting for us.

547
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,193
- Call me when you're ready to go down.
- I will.

548
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,475
- Some more tea, Helen?
- Yes, thank you.

549
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,232
- Is Nancy staying with you?
- No.

550
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,278
She comes and takes me down
to the beach, picks me up later,

551
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,920
whenever she can get away
from the hospital.

552
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,834
- I'm going to miss you terribly, Ed.
- Well, I hate to say goodbye.

553
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,115
But I've refused the gallery so many times,

554
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,953
and I do have to be in Chicago
at least once this year.

555
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:44,511
You've been wonderful all these months,
and I apologise for being a handful.

556
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,397
Uh-uh, Helen. Quiet.

557
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,029
Well, I'd have thrown me in the drink
if I were me. Thank you.

558
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,396
But, Ed, I get so tired
of learning how to eat and dressing

559
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,710
and finding out
where the heck things are.

560
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,078
I get so tense,
and then I'm a problem to everybody.

561
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,072
Of course you have to have
people around to help you.

562
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,720
So do several geniuses
that I could mention.

563
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,075
But you're such a good friend.

564
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,674
- And don't forget that.
- No.

565
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,433
Sorry I had to miss Joyce.
Say goodbye for me.

566
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,910
Yes, I will. She's in town.
It's about that accident insurance.

567
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,275
Thank goodness for that.
It's kept us going.

568
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,954
Well, goodbye. You'll be hearing from me.

569
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,632
God bless you.

570
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,790
- I'll get Nancy.
- No, not yet.

571
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,189
Where's my radar?

572
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,551
No, no, no. As a farewell present for you,
I'm going to try something.

573
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,155
For the first time, in your honour,
down to the cove all by myself.

574
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,028
- But you've never gone down there alone.
- Well, it's about time I start.

575
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,635
- I'd better go partway with you.
- Oh, no. Just stay and watch.

576
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,359
I know these steps by heart.

577
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,670
One...

578
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,115
two...

579
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,189
three...

580
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,751
Helen?

581
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,751
Where did Helen go?

582
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,192
- That's progress for you.
- It's remarkable!

583
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,271
Judy!

584
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,351
Hi, Helen!

585
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,117
Say, what do you know!

586
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,397
- You started exploring by yourself!
- How about that!

587
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,155
- I'm sorry I'm late, Judy.
- Me too. I gotta get back early.

588
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,915
I thought you weren't coming, so
I went ahead and read the whole chapter.

589
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,798
Serves me right for being late.
What happened?

590
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,839
Well, old Huckleberry's
on this crazy raft with Jim,

591
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,753
and they run into
this old, deserted houseboat.

592
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,638
- Huck... Here's a step.
- Oh. Thank you.

593
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,280
One, two, three, four, five steps.

594
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,238
Now let's see. Where was I? Oh, yes.

595
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,788
Huck thinks
maybe they can scrounge something,

596
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,998
so he starts to investigate
in all this dirt and disorder.

597
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:07,029
He opens this door and finds two fellas
talking in a very rough fashion.

598
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,635
Well, here we are. Take it easy, now.

599
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,032
These characters are very hostile indeed.

600
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,473
And?

601
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,916
Tune in tomorrow,
same time, same station.

602
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,718
Shall do.

603
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,836
What's going on out on the lake, Judy?

604
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,514
Oh, I'd say there's about a ten-knot blow,

605
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,956
and about a half-dozen snipes
having a race.

606
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,555
And a couple of stars
foolin' around by the yacht club.

607
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,553
And a real gone daddy
zoomin' around with his inboard.

608
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:42,236
Aw, some babe's water-skiing.
Not so hot. She's usin' both hands.

609
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,312
- Sounds like a big day.
- Yeah!

610
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,597
Hate to rush, Helen,
but OK if I do the newspaper now?

611
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,477
Sure. But what's the hurry?

612
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,950
Mother stuck me
with Susan Shacker's birthday party.

613
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,952
<i>Can you imagine me in a dress?</i>

614
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,669
Well... In Europe, things aren't so hot.

615
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,593
In the Pacific, things aren't so hot.

616
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,238
And in Washington...

617
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,313
If you want to know my opinion,
things are pretty fouled up all over.

618
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,630
Page 3. Here's a girdle and bra ad -
which I won't be needing for quite a while.

619
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,314
I'm a dog to run off, I know. But
what can you do with parents, eh, Helen?

620
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,994
Nothing, I guess.
But we'll be together tomorrow.

621
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:27,471
- Sure. Want me to take you back up?
- No, I'll sit here for a while. I'm all right.

622
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,154
OK. You're a big girl now.

623
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,798
- See you!
- Bye.

624
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,356
Hey, handsome!

625
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,078
Yeah, you, Tarzan!

626
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,073
I'm stuck!
Wanna help me launch my boat?

627
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:58,436
A girl's in real tough shape when she's got
no figure and no muscles either.

628
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,434
Thanks! Stick around!
I think we can use you!

629
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,317
Bye, Helen!

630
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,435
Goodbye!

631
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,471
Thank you for your help.

632
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,674
Sure.

633
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,639
I didn't know anyone else was here.
Do you come to the cove often?

634
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:28,432
Well... lately a little.

635
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,990
I've noticed you and Judy a few times.

636
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,428
Well, I'm Mrs Phillips.

637
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,238
And I hope any friend of Judy's
is a friend of mine.

638
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,038
How do you do, Mrs Phillips?

639
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:46,193
- And you're?
- Rob... My name's Robinson.

640
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,198
Well, you know,
it's a bit chillier than I thought.

641
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,068
Oh, dear. I'm sorry, but would you help me
find my shawl? I don't see.

642
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,832
Of course.

643
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,833
I'm very awkward, I guess,
but Judy's a wonderful builder-upper.

644
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,674
I don't think anybody could come through
any better than you have.

645
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:09,959
- With a subdural haematoma like yours...
- That's where I met you. At the hospital.

646
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,033
- You're a doctor.
- No. We've never met.

647
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,911
I know a little about medicine.
I studied to be a surgeon once.

648
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,790
<i>- But I have heard your voice, haven't I?
- I don't think so, Mrs Phillips.</i>

649
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,873
- Is there anything else I can do?
- No, thank you. I'm very comfortable.

650
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,952
Mrs Phillips, I wonder...

651
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,995
Would it be all right
if I came by occasionally?

652
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,197
Just for launching outboards
and general morale purposes?

653
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,475
- I hope I'm not imposing.
- Of course not.

654
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,596
We'll hope to see you again very soon.

655
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,671
Yes. Soon.

656
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,471
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

657
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,597
I hope that I've been able
to make myself clear.

658
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,195
What you say you want to do is
the best news that anyone could tell me.

659
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,636
But I warn you,
the investment of one's life in others

660
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,918
and the alignment of oneself
with the forces that lead up and on,

661
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,753
- this does not come cheap.
- I don't expect it to be.

662
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:40,311
Once you go into it, you're bound.
You'll never be able to give it up.

663
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,520
You'll find this furnishes
your motive power. It will obsess you.

664
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:50,196
But, believe me,
it'll be a magnificent obsession.

665
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,678
- Thank you, Williams.
- A Mr Masterson is here.

666
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,479
- Any mail?
- Yes, sir. On your desk.

667
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,396
- Sorry I'm late.
- I haven't waited long.

668
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,675
- Cigarette?
- Yes. Thank you.

669
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,832
How are plans developing?

670
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,912
I made the last deposit
to Mrs Phillips' account today.

671
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,194
Sit down.

672
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,475
That completes
the amount you wanted paid.

673
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,358
- Good. Any problems?
- No, but...

674
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,993
Joyce asked
some very pertinent questions.

675
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,390
It is a lot of money. But they're both
convinced it was insurance.

676
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,789
- You haven't mentioned this to anyone?
- No.

677
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,757
Good.

678
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,434
- You don't approve of me, do you?
- Well, I...

679
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,876
Perkins and Little
have been the Merrick attorneys for years.

680
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,349
<i>So I thought it strange
you called me last month.</i>

681
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,513
That's why. Nobody would suspect
anything from you as originating with me.

682
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:03,593
And you can start practising some more,
because here comes a high, fast one.

683
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,875
I talked to Dr Giraud
at the medical centre.

684
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,350
- The brain man?
- Yes. Best diagnostician in the country.

685
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,032
I once studied with him.

686
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,954
He says there's some chance -
a very, very small chance -

687
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,918
that Helen Phillips' prognosis
may not be hopeless.

688
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,796
Really?

689
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,078
He says if doctors like Emil Hofer in
Zrich, Fuss in Vienna, Lehman in Munich

690
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:28,154
could be persuaded to take her case, they
might be able to devise a way to operate.

691
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,112
But you couldn't get them all
over here in a million years.

692
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:36,876
We could get her over there. Hofer won't
leave Zrich, so it has to be Switzerland.

693
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,953
Today Dr Giraud heard from Fuss.
He and Lehman could be there this spring

694
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,871
for periodic consultations.

695
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,876
They're willing to tell her they're taking
the case as a gesture to her late husband.

696
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,635
You get all kinds of people
to do what you want, don't you, Merrick?

697
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,919
That's fine, but... the expense. Somebody
will have to be with her all those months.

698
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,355
Persuade her and Joyce to sell the house.

699
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,429
Who'd buy it?

700
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,751
I know somebody
who needs a place exactly like that.

701
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:08,594
He'll pay what some people might think
is a lot more than it's worth.

702
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:12,639
Think it over. Figure out the best way
to present it all to her.

703
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,474
Of course, don't let anyone
know about this either.

704
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,950
- No one.
- No, of course not.

705
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,715
Um... What are you
going to do with the house?

706
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,032
I don't want any part of it.
You'll find a worthy use for it.

707
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,111
Merrick, I, uh...

708
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,988
I take back
a lot of things I thought about you.

709
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,115
That's nice of you to say so.

710
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,880
- What's all this?
- False knots.

711
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,394
One of the first things you learn
in med school.

712
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,837
<i>You are wrapped up in this.
Well, goodbye. I'll be talking to you.</i>

713
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,150
Thanks. I'll find my way out.

714
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:05,916
<i>What you're asking is to change your
manner of living - which is your business -</i>

715
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,117
but also to pick up a career
which you dropped.

716
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,998
Probably the most demanding career
you could choose.

717
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:16,198
If you don't go on this time, we've tied up
good people and priceless facilities -

718
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,272
<i>- which is my business.
- I'm still asking it.</i>

719
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:25,833
If I can go back and graduate, will you
let me intern here at the medical centre?

720
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,840
All right, Bob Merrick. We'll try it.

721
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,390
I've done a lot of things in medicine
I was warned were impossible.

722
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,799
You won't regret it.

723
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,429
When you studied with me years ago,
why weren't you so enthusiastic?

724
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:47,640
- What a lot of time you've wasted!
- Yes, what a lot of time.

725
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,511
Thank you, Doctor.

726
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,990
The marshal gets on his white horse
and rides off with Wise Eagle.

727
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:01,392
The marshal says, "Wise Eagle, ya reckon
them varmints'll head through the pass?"

728
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,675
- Wise Eagle says...
- "Ug!"

729
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,718
The marshal says,
"We gotta head 'em off. Come on. "

730
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,598
Next picture's the sheriff's office.
The marshal says:

731
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,310
"Sheriff, what idea you got in that ornery
head of yours to stop them desperadoes?"

732
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,118
The sheriff says...

733
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,830
"Marshal, I don't like using shootin' irons,
but if I gotta use shootin' irons,

734
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,832
I tell you, there ain't no hombre
this side of the Pecos

735
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,673
is any better with shootin' irons,
less'n it's you. "

736
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,193
And Wise Eagle says...

737
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,589
Oh. "Ug!"

738
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,352
<i>We're gettin' better!</i>

739
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:37,195
Listen, you two. Forget about the funnies.
I can't keep quiet any longer.

740
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,875
- Silence, Judith.
- OK, Helen. Shoot.

741
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,919
First of all, some of the best eye doctors
in Europe are interested in me,

742
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,592
because of my husband, I guess.

743
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,148
They want me to come over
for a consultation.

744
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:52,949
- Helen, I couldn't be happier.
- Gee, that's marvellous! For free?

745
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,510
Practically. But not the trip itself -
that's the other good news.

746
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,830
So many wonderful things
have happened.

747
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,913
We have the most fabulous offer
for the house and the lake frontage.

748
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,991
Enough for an income for Joyce and me.

749
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:09,676
If the buyer takes the Brightwood acreage,
the hospital will be in good shape too.

750
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,637
It's about time your life turned.

751
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:17,511
It's ironic - I've never been to Europe,
and when I go, I won't be able to see it.

752
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,478
But what a place to open your eyes.

753
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,632
I have to leave by the end of the month
for Switzerland.

754
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,598
I'll miss you two, for a long time.

755
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,399
Heck, Helen. I'll write.

756
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,998
<i>Heck, Helen. I'll write.</i>

757
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:38,916
Switzerland sounds dreamy! You can get
a Swiss watch and learn to yodel!

758
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,039
She's practically lived on the beach.
This Robinson must be a dreamboat.

759
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:47,636
- Haven't you met him yet?
- She's keeping him all to herself.

760
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:52,271
I think it's wonderful. It looks as if
they really mean a lot to each other.

761
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,557
You know, it's very strange
knowing you only like this.

762
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,598
So well, it seems, and yet...

763
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,835
I've never seen your face.

764
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,311
<i>- Hi, Joyce!
- Hi, Judy!</i>

765
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,676
- Any room left on the beach for us?
- Sure. You kiddin'?

766
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:15,117
Helen, the news sounds just wonderful,
but I'm afraid I have to go.

767
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:20,069
Oh, no. No, don't go. It's Joyce,
and now you'll have a chance to meet her.

768
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,878
Joyce!

769
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,952
Happy Sunday, Helen.
Joyce dragged me along.

770
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:29,113
At long last, everybody.
This is Joyce Phillips, Tom Masterson,

771
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,715
and this is Robbie Robinson
I've been telling you so much about.

772
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,031
- Hello.
- How do you do, Mr... Robinson?

773
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,678
How do you do?

774
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,753
I'm sorry. I'm just on my way
to the village. I'm glad to have met you.

775
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,831
Don't forget tomorrow.

776
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,750
Goodbye, Helen.

777
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,831
Goodbye.

778
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,636
- Mr Robinson!
- Joyce!

779
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,312
Could I ask you a favour?

780
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,231
- Tom!
- Yes, Helen?

781
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:00,232
- Tom, what's wrong?
- Why, nothing, Helen.

782
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:04,029
- What is this?
- Look, Joyce, you don't understand.

783
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:08,318
I sure don't. Hasn't she had enough
trouble from you without this fantastic lie?

784
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,076
Believe me, I'm only trying
to make her life a little less lonely.

785
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:17,915
Fine. Wouldn't it be wonderful for her to
fall in love with someone named Robinson

786
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,195
and then open her eyes
and see that it's you?

787
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:23,875
That would make us all glad we're living,
wouldn't it?

788
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:28,033
Get out, Merrick.
Get out of her life and stay out.

789
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,311
So long, pardner!

790
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,432
- Goodbye, Helen.
- Goodbye, Tom.

791
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,919
Come on, Helen.

792
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,718
- Goodbye, Tom.
- Goodbye, Nancy.

793
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,552
Hurry up, Joyce.

794
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,358
I love you, darling.

795
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,198
I'm coming.

796
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,475
- Bye, darling.
- Goodbye, dear.

797
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,311
Hello, Merrick.

798
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,392
Everything's going to be all right.

799
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,798
Now, Mrs Phillips,
tell me if you see a little light.

800
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,436
Do you?

801
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,511
No.

802
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,230
Do you notice a light now?

803
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,357
No, I'm sorry, gentlemen.

804
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,832
Mrs Phillips, do you have headaches?

805
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:09,949
Yes.

806
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,237
Constantly, or periodically?

807
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,515
- Periodically.
- Mm-hm.

808
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,875
Where?

809
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,428
In the back of my head.

810
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,511
Any dizzy spells?

811
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,519
Occasionally.

812
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,795
Difficulties in walking?

813
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,560
No... No.

814
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,315
Well, I think that does it for today.

815
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,517
Well, Doctors? What's the verdict?

816
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,751
You must be patient, Mrs Phillips,
you know.

817
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,115
There are tests and tests.

818
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,714
We are making progress.

819
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:52,954
But I did distinguish some light yesterday,
and it was the same test, wasn't it?

820
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,439
What does it mean?

821
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:58,991
If you can bear with us, madame,
in time we'll find out.

822
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,029
Oh, I don't know
how they dare call this tea.

823
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,554
Back home it'd be a six-course lunch.

824
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,478
Why did I ever memorise
that calorie chart?

825
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:32,950
I'm glad that's finished.
Now I'm only three letters behind Tom.

826
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,554
- Want some tea, dear?
- Yes, thank you, Nancy.

827
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,631
- Joyce?
- Yes?

828
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:43,317
I'd like to send a note to Robbie Robinson,
if it wouldn't be too much trouble.

829
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,753
Well, no.

830
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:48,628
- Aren't you tired? It can wait, can't it?
- You should rest and relax,

831
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:53,953
- not worry about your social obligations.
- It's no obligation. He'll be interested.

832
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:57,112
And I want it to make the next plane -
just a note, Joyce.

833
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,668
And you can say...

834
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,796
that the tests have started

835
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,599
and we're all very optimistic.

836
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:08,559
And, uh... tell him that I miss him...

837
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,996
and to say hello to Judy...

838
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:16,790
and the only part of Switzerland
that we've encountered is a hospital.

839
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,599
...is a hospital.

840
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:30,517
How do you explain it, Doctor? Her letter
sounds so optimistic, yet your reports...

841
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:34,673
Now, now, Bob. How long
has she been there? A few weeks?

842
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,228
Only Fuss and Hofer have seen her so far.

843
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,357
Naturally their reports to us
are going to sound cautious.

844
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,557
Cautious? I'd say they were pessimistic.

845
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:48,953
Don't worry so much. Everything
which can be done for her is being done.

846
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,314
I know.

847
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:57,158
After all, we never anticipated
more than a medical possibility, did we?

848
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,478
A medical possibility.

849
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,514
Mrs Phillips! Good morning.

850
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,909
- You're Dr Fuss?
- Yes. Dr Fuss.

851
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,276
- Please, sit down, Mrs Phillips.
- Oh, and you're Dr Hofer.

852
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,351
<i>- Jawohl.
- Good morning, madame.</i>

853
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,590
- And you're Dr Lehman.
- You're right.

854
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:26,195
You see?
I'm beginning to recognise all of you.

855
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,669
Well, at long last, the great day.

856
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,832
I want you to know
that I've shot the works, too.

857
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:36,072
That's American slang.
That means a new dress, a new hat...

858
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:42,596
Now I want to know when
you're going to make a new girl out of me.

859
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:46,275
Mrs Phillips, you have been
close to medicine for a few years.

860
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:49,909
You know the relationship
of doctor and patient.

861
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,996
You know that there is very little
to be gained by not facing the facts.

862
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,071
Why, of course.

863
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:01,389
By all means, face the facts.

864
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,390
What are they?

865
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,994
We are very sorry, Mrs Phillips,

866
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:12,198
but we are agreed that, for the present,
we can do nothing.

867
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,871
No operation?

868
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,395
- Nothing?
- We've searched every avenue, I believe.

869
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:24,199
That's not to say there is no hope.

870
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:27,078
In a case like yours,
after several years sometimes...

871
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,752
Several years, Doctor?!

872
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:34,278
We feel that it would be unwise
and unkind to submit you to surgery now.

873
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:37,989
But you know that I'll let you experiment
if there's any chance at all -

874
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,196
the longest chance in the world.

875
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:44,558
We regret to say,
but the indications are not there.

876
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,552
Oh.

877
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:53,390
Well, if the indications
aren't there, then...

878
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:55,869
I guess that's that.

879
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:00,791
You've done everything that you could.

880
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,474
It was a gamble.

881
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:07,519
We all knew that it was a gamble
and I just...

882
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,068
well, I just lost, that's all.

883
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:15,353
But... I want to thank you.

884
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,149
I want to thank you
for being so kind to me and...

885
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:22,073
and giving me all your time.

886
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:26,152
I really can't thank you enough.

887
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,708
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

888
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,598
- And...
- Goodbye, Mrs Phillips.

889
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:35,629
The last must be Dr Lehman.

890
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:38,109
My child...

891
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,839
I am so sorry.

892
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:46,358
Well, I... I thought
I was going to get rid of these.

893
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:50,718
Isn't it nice that...
that I didn't throw them away?

894
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,351
She's sound asleep.

895
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,788
What has she done
that all this happens to her?

896
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:25,274
Golly. How she took it today...

897
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:30,397
I don't know how she stands up
under everything.

898
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,439
If it happened to me, I'd go to pot
in a handbasket. I think I'd even...

899
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:37,557
I'm proud of you, Joyce.

900
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:41,235
It hasn't been an easy year for you either.

901
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:46,030
Well, I'll go get these drops
and this new prescription filled.

902
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:50,796
- Nancy, do me a favour.
- Of course. What?

903
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:55,192
Stay away from here for a while
and relax yourself for a change.

904
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:00,070
All right. I do need some fresh air.
I'll be back in an hour.

905
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:22,638
- Darling. I thought you were asleep.
- I heard the door. Was it Nancy?

906
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:27,157
Yes. She went out for a while. I can get
you one of your pills and some hot milk.

907
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:29,708
Joyce, I don't need any sleep.

908
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,231
Oh, yes, I do too.

909
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,231
It's so awful in bed.

910
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:43,438
It's funny, but...
the night-time is the worst time.

911
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,080
It does get darker, you know.

912
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,556
And then, when I finally do get to sleep,

913
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:55,509
I know that, when I wake up
in the morning, there won't be any dawn.

914
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,719
Joyce...

915
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,360
Joyce, forgive me.

916
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,955
I didn't mean to parade my emotions.

917
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,674
Maybe I do need a pill.

918
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:13,320
Would you mind
getting me some warm milk?

919
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,868
Of course not.

920
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,349
Just sit down here.

921
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,838
I'll only be gone a moment.

922
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,596
I'll just go down to the hotel kitchen
and warm some milk.

923
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,830
- Are you all right?
- Yes, dear, I'm all right.

924
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,074
Joyce?

925
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,711
No.

926
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,351
It's Rob.

927
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,751
Rob?

928
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,477
Oh, I can't believe it.

929
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,438
- It's been so long.
- Much too long.

930
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:21,831
When you didn't come to the plane,
and you hardly wrote all these months...

931
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,718
<i>Oh, I'm so glad you're here!</i>

932
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,155
You must have known
how much I need you now.

933
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,468
<i>Darling.</i>

934
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,395
Robbie, my trip has been wasted.

935
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:39,031
- I found out today my case is hopeless.
- Don't talk about it.

936
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,317
I came to tell you you're gonna have
the time of your life with me.

937
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:46,712
I'll take you all the places you've been too
busy to visit, show you how to have fun.

938
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,712
- But I'll be such trouble.
- Listen, Helen.

939
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:54,590
You used to let me read you the funnies.
Let me be your eyes again.

940
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:58,389
Now get dressed.
Something to bowl everybody ever.

941
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:02,314
<i>I'm not only gonna show you the town,
I'm gonna show the town you.</i>

942
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,391
Oh, Robbie.

943
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,594
Joyce?

944
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,559
Joyce?

945
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:15,234
Yes, Helen?

946
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:19,677
Look who's here. Robbie Robinson.
It's like Old Home Week.

947
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,478
This is a surprise.

948
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,152
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

949
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:27,711
We're gonna get dressed up to the teeth.
I'm going to initiate that new net dress.

950
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:32,756
Joyce, will you please come and help me?

951
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,309
Oh!

952
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,597
Oh, I'm all right. I won't be very long.

953
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:48,755
- I'll be back in just a moment, Helen.
- All right, Joyce.

954
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,835
Bob Merrick, I...

955
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,911
I want to apologise.

956
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,274
You? For what?

957
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:04,878
That girl you just saw is quite a change
from the girl this afternoon.

958
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,713
They told her she's never going to see.

959
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:11,315
I know. I just came from the institute.

960
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,119
They've been keeping in touch with me.

961
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:17,909
Anybody that can do
what you've done for her is OK with me.

962
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,594
I never believed
names were too important anyway.

963
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,875
<i>- Joyce!
- Coming!</i>

964
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,798
It's wonderful being with you.

965
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,156
I don't want it to end, ever.

966
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,437
<i>Let's not think of it. Tonight is our night.</i>

967
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,715
<i>Yes, tonight is our night.</i>

968
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,198
Oh, and the fragrance in the air...
What is it?

969
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,316
- Lilacs?
- Mm-hm.

970
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:57,393
And there's a moon - as there should be.

971
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:02,508
Oh, and just ahead
there's lights of a little old town.

972
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,876
<i>Just as there should be.</i>

973
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,351
Excuse me a second, darling.

974
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,912
<i>- Ich nehme diesen hier.
- Danke.</i>

975
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,114
I thought you might like these.

976
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,435
- Lilacs?
- Mm-hm. For luck.

977
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,591
And more lilacs.

978
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,828
What's going on?

979
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,069
Let's find out.

980
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,310
<i>Wenn ich das erklren darf?</i>

981
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,312
<i>- Das ist ein lokales Volksfest.
- It's a local festival.</i>

982
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,994
<i>- Man verbrennt die Hexe.
- They're burning a witch.</i>

983
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,833
<i>- Damit wir eine gute Ernte haben.
- For a good harvest.</i>

984
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,912
<i>- Mit Musik und Feuerwerk.
- With music and fireworks.</i>

985
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:19,199
There she is, darling. Way up on top of
a pile of branches about 20 feet high.

986
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:23,068
Poor old gal's stuffed with straw,
just like our scarecrows back home.

987
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:28,029
And on the ground just below her, boys
and girls in peasant dress are dancing.

988
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,633
Now they're setting fire to her.

989
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,591
There she goes.

990
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:09,240
Fireworks bursting all over the place.

991
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,390
- Now everybody's starting to dance.
- I'd like to dance too.

992
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,072
You would?

993
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:28,311
I always dance
with my eyes closed anyway.

994
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,037
- I won't tell you what time it is.
- I don't want it to stop.

995
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:21,590
I don't want to lose this place,
or the music, or the night.

996
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,557
You don't have to lose it.

997
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,677
I'd forgotten how happy I could be.

998
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:31,197
You've helped me know that the world
isn't such a bad place after all.

999
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,750
- You don't hate it any more?
- Not any more.

1000
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,558
Could you... forgive anything now?

1001
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,312
I think so.

1002
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,391
Yes.

1003
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,471
Even... Bob Merrick?

1004
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:48,351
Why...

1005
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,831
Yes, Bob.

1006
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,512
Of course.

1007
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,591
How long have you known?

1008
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:02,959
I don't really remember when I first had
the feeling that... Does it really matter?

1009
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:07,158
I love you, and I want to marry you.

1010
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,998
Darling, if we only could.

1011
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:15,119
But I couldn't have you pitied
because of me. I love you too much.

1012
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:20,069
- Helen, I need you more than anything.
- Bob... Tomorrow.

1013
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,559
Let me tell you tomorrow.

1014
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,431
All right.

1015
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:31,597
Starting tomorrow, we'll never be apart.

1016
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,951
Tomorrow.

1017
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:50,639
Well... it's really good night this time.

1018
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,836
Oh, I wish it weren't.

1019
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,598
There's a brand-new day in a few hours.

1020
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:09,238
Even better.

1021
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,709
Nothing could be better, darling.

1022
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,791
I love you.

1023
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,871
Oh, Bob.

1024
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,391
Oh. The key.

1025
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:26,271
The key.

1026
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:34,831
Helen!

1027
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,194
- Did you have a good time?
- A wonderful time.

1028
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,759
How pretty.

1029
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,434
- Good night.
- Good night.

1030
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,398
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Yes.

1031
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:50,358
- Good night.
- Good night, Nancy.

1032
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:00,752
I'll take the flowers, Helen.

1033
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:03,638
Oh, they're so pretty.

1034
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:06,518
It was too wonderful, Nancy.

1035
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,989
He wants to do so much for me.

1036
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:12,231
Helen, what's the matter?

1037
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,989
He wants to marry me, Nancy.

1038
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,435
I love him. I can't let him do it.

1039
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:22,149
- Well, if you love him and he loves you...
- I don't know. I don't know.

1040
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,356
I don't know anything any more.

1041
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:27,318
- Nancy, please don't leave me.
- Of course I won't.

1042
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,391
You've got to help me.

1043
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,191
Helen?

1044
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:50,231
Nancy?

1045
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,911
Where is everybody?

1046
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:02,911
Hello?

1047
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,159
Oh, yes, please. Have him come up.

1048
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,798
Helen, Rob...

1049
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:33,157
Hello? Get me the desk, please.

1050
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,038
Come in.

1051
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,109
I see.

1052
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:45,192
Good morning.
Couldn't order a better day if we tried.

1053
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,475
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1054
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:52,035
Is Helen dressed?
I hope you're not allergic to lilacs.

1055
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:55,635
Bob... What happened
to you two last night?

1056
01:21:55,720 --> 01:22:01,033
- Did you tell her who you were?
- Yes. But she knew anyway. Joyce...

1057
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,554
I, uh... I asked her to marry me.

1058
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,871
Oh, Bob.

1059
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:12,550
- She's gone.
- She's?

1060
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:15,359
- Where?
- I don't know.

1061
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:18,193
Away with Nancy, early this morning.

1062
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:21,272
Oh, here. She left this note for you.

1063
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,152
"Dear Bob. Goodbye. "

1064
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:35,391
"I'm sure this is best for both of us. "

1065
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:39,473
"You have your study and work now,
and I could only be a burden. "

1066
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:42,358
"If you love me, don't try to find me. "

1067
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:46,877
"Just know you made me happier than
I dreamed I could ever be again. Helen. "

1068
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:53,034
I phoned downstairs.
Nobody knows where she went.

1069
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,111
- We've got to go after her.
- But, Bob...

1070
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,397
We'll talk about it on the way.
We've got to find her.

1071
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:04,511
Miss Phillips, Mr Merrick,
we are doing everything to trace them -

1072
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,636
as are the police all over Europe.

1073
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:11,396
But from Milano - nothing to report.
Paris - no findings. Rome - nothing.

1074
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,392
You'd think in five weeks
we'd be able to find some trace.

1075
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:15,913
I am truly sorry, sir.

1076
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,195
But, you know, even in your country,

1077
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:21,909
if someone really wants to disappear,
it is not too difficult.

1078
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:27,632
- However, we shall not give up.
- Thank you, Captain. Goodbye.

1079
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,992
I know what a sense of loss
and disappointment you both have,

1080
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,638
but look at these telegrams.

1081
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:38,076
Our Inter-Europa Agency
has tried everything, I assure you.

1082
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:40,799
<i>Da ist ein Telegramm fr mich?
Dankeschn.</i>

1083
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:45,351
<i>We have exhausted all possibilities.</i>

1084
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,668
Inter-Europa.

1085
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:50,514
<i>Oui, madame. Lundi, cinq... Exactement.</i>

1086
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,511
<i>Pas de quoi, madame.</i>

1087
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:01,989
But we will be in touch
with our New York people.

1088
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,514
And I will keep on the lookout here

1089
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:07,114
for the two of them
booking passage to America.

1090
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:10,954
<i>Here are your tickets.
Bon voyage. Have a nice trip.</i>

1091
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,508
It was a pleasure serving you.

1092
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,554
Darling, you're home.

1093
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,631
Oh, am I glad to see you!

1094
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,594
- Welcome home, Bob.
- Hello, Tom. Good to see you.

1095
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:45,070
- Nothing? No trace?
- None.

1096
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:49,756
She must come back to the States.
Sooner or later they'll get in touch.

1097
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,389
- Strange how things work out, isn't it?
- Yeah, strange.

1098
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:55,357
What are your plans?

1099
01:24:55,440 --> 01:25:00,434
I don't know. I guess I'll...
go up to Brightwood for a while.

1100
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,270
<i>The marshal gets on his white horse
and rides off with Wise Eagle.</i>

1101
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:30,319
<i>The marshal says, "Wise Eagle, ya reckon
them varmints'll head through the pass?"</i>

1102
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,277
<i>- Wise Eagle says...
- "Ug/"</i>

1103
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,239
- Mr Merrick?
- Yes.

1104
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:59,710
Mr Randolph had to leave Brightwood
for a few months.

1105
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:02,758
Will you excuse me?
I just came over to close up the house.

1106
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:04,831
Yes, certainly.

1107
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,839
<i>Once you go into it,
you're bound. You'll never give it up.</i>

1108
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:29,311
<i>You'll find it'll furnish your motive power.
It will obsess you.</i>

1109
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:33,279
<i>But, believe me,
it'll be a magnificent obsession.</i>

1110
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,750
- Chris, here's Doctor.
- Dr Merrick!

1111
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:21,115
- All ready to leave us, Chris?
- All set.

1112
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,191
- Good!
- I wanna show you something.

1113
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,271
Oh. All right.

1114
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:28,271
Look at me.

1115
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:31,673
Not dizzy or anything.
You sure know how to operate!

1116
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,194
Dr Barnes
had more to do with it than I did.

1117
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:40,150
Now I can go to that new school out
in the country. They got horses and dogs.

1118
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:43,038
<i>That's just fine. Goodbye, Chris.</i>

1119
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:46,954
Just a minute, Doctor.
Chris, I want to talk to Doctor a minute.

1120
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,156
Dr Merrick,
you've been wonderful to us.

1121
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:50,992
Not just here in the hospital.

1122
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:55,710
You arranged that school for Chris,
and my husband's job at the plant.

1123
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:59,679
- You haven't told him that I?
- No. That's just between us, like you said.

1124
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,877
But in a few years,
when Chris understands about money...

1125
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,599
No, Mrs Miller.
I told you there's nothing to repay.

1126
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:07,910
In a few years it'll be all used up anyway.

1127
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,390
- All used up?
- That's right, Mrs Miller. Goodbye.

1128
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:20,594
I had quite an experience at the golf club.
After 20 years I almost got a hole in one.

1129
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:25,470
I took her to a beautiful French restaurant,
but all she wanted was spaghetti.

1130
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:26,993
Bob Merrick!

1131
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:29,355
Dr Giraud! For heaven's sake!
How are you?

1132
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:32,398
<i>- You're underweight, but you look fine.
- I feel fine.</i>

1133
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:36,268
Doctors, please!
This is a very tense moment.

1134
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:37,829
Check.

1135
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,797
Say, what are you doing here?

1136
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:43,668
Just been seeing your chief. He told me
you did a nice job on that trephining.

1137
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:47,639
I told him I taught you all you know.
You'll be a real neurosurgeon after all.

1138
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:49,119
That's the idea, Doctor.

1139
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,873
Never hurts to take time off
to build up the batteries.

1140
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:55,316
I took a week off. Went to
Joyce and Tom Masterson's wedding.

1141
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,197
- When was that?
- Well, let's see.

1142
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:00,989
She's in Maternity now with her first baby.
It must have been a year ago.

1143
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:03,548
Maybe work is the best answer.

1144
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:07,078
You... never heard anything again?

1145
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:11,790
No. I never heard from her. Supposedly
she and Nancy came back to the States.

1146
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,791
<i>Dr Merrick, please.</i>

1147
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:16,633
You're being paged.
Must be an important man, Doctor.

1148
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:20,793
Don't stay away so long, Doctor.
We need critics around here. Goodbye.

1149
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:28,358
The book says
if they don't gain it back in five days...

1150
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:32,672
Book, shmook. There ought to be a law
new fathers couldn't read anything.

1151
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,955
<i>Come in.</i>

1152
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:36,559
- Hello, Doctor.
- Tom.

1153
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:38,790
- How's the little mother?
- A lot littler.

1154
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:43,237
I have a formal complaint. Some nurse
came and took my baby away.

1155
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:47,711
All you can supply is psychological
nourishment, which she doesn't need yet.

1156
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:50,268
- Everything all right?
- Fine. I go home Monday.

1157
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:52,874
Good. I'll look in on you tomorrow.

1158
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:56,748
- Give little Helen an extra hug for me.
- Sure.

1159
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,635
Goodbye, Doctor.

1160
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:02,995
He's doing his life over the hard way.

1161
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:07,073
I imagine any other way
would be the hard way now.

1162
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:17,871
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Good evening, Williams. Thank you.

1163
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:26,797
- Hello, Bob.
- Edward Randolph. Good to see you.

1164
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:29,314
How long have you been here?

1165
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:32,756
I phoned the hospital.
They said you were on your way home.

1166
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,671
And...

1167
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,556
What is it?

1168
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,154
Helen.

1169
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,629
- Do you know where she is?
- Nancy called.

1170
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:45,678
Said she was breaking her word -
thank goodness she did.

1171
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:48,911
- Helen must be desperately ill, Bob.
- What?!

1172
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,959
They're afraid of pneumonia,
other complications.

1173
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:56,712
- Where are they?
- In a little hospital in New Mexico.

1174
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,791
Shadow Mountain.

1175
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:05,079
I've already called about tickets.

1176
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:10,188
- How soon can we leave?
- The 9:00 plane. We'll get there at dawn.

1177
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:25,355
Doctor, that's their car.

1178
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,752
- At last you're here.
- Finally.

1179
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:44,559
- I've only done what she asked me.
- I know. How is she?

1180
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:47,632
In a coma. No change
since you called from the airport.

1181
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:52,714
- Dr Allan, Dr Merrick, Mr Randolph.
- How do you do? This way, Doctor.

1182
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:55,432
Nancy...

1183
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,949
She was admitted a month ago.

1184
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:31,148
May I see the history, please?

1185
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:39,674
It's the pneumonococcus now.

1186
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,433
When she was admitted,
headaches, nausea,

1187
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:44,636
not connected with her blindness at all.

1188
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:47,154
It's pressure.
Have you done a spinal puncture?

1189
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:51,756
One. Starting yesterday,
she deteriorated so fast, we had to.

1190
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:56,436
Another odd thing. This apparent paralysis
of the left arm and the respiratory centre.

1191
01:32:56,520 --> 01:33:00,433
Couldn't be a stroke.
The onset was so gradual.

1192
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:04,115
No. But it could be a fibroma.

1193
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,952
Her old injury.

1194
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:08,838
I know something about it.
It might have caused a clot

1195
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:10,990
which became organised and fibrotic.

1196
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:19,752
I...

1197
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,995
always dance...

1198
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:26,436
with my eyes closed.

1199
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:31,589
Well, Doctor? What do you suggest?

1200
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:34,752
If we could only get
Henry Giraud to fly out here.

1201
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:37,035
There isn't time for that.

1202
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:41,310
Is there?

1203
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:47,000
No, there's no time for that.

1204
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:50,277
I agree.
We should operate as soon as possible.

1205
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:52,112
Let's have a look at Surgery.

1206
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:56,073
- Doctor...
- This way?

1207
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:59,470
Doctor, I couldn't do it.
I've never used a Hudson Burr.

1208
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:04,076
- Isn't there anyone else?
- Here? This is just a private sanatorium.

1209
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:08,915
Four of us on the staff. Not one of us
could take that responsibility.

1210
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,991
<i>- Do you want it?
- I?</i>

1211
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,719
I don't have enough experience.

1212
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,473
- You can't expect me to...
- Bob.

1213
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:23,269
A chance in a thousand.

1214
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:25,430
A chance in a million.

1215
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:28,318
You've got to give it to her.

1216
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:34,836
Edward, I can't.

1217
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:39,357
You're not gonna let everything
you've lived for all these years slip away?

1218
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,750
You've gone so far, Bob. So far.

1219
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:47,952
I'd give my life to save her.

1220
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:52,511
You just give your skill.
You're ready for it.

1221
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:58,994
Now you're gonna repay that old, old debt
in a way that you never imagined.

1222
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:15,194
Nancy, will you help scrub?

1223
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,077
I'll be glad to, Doctor.

1224
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:10,639
Remove the dressing.

1225
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:17,150
2cc of Pentothal sodium.

1226
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:27,631
<i>We're almost ready, Doctor.</i>

1227
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:29,711
Dr Merrick?

1228
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:39,634
- What's the trouble?
- Doctor, you begin. I'll stand by.

1229
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:41,950
Just a moment, please, Doctor.

1230
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:46,670
You can't let that girl down.
You just can't!

1231
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:49,149
Nancy, I'm not up to it.

1232
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:52,430
I just won't be able to...

1233
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:08,352
Nancy, let's start.

1234
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,279
- Ready?
- Go ahead.

1235
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,351
All right, Doctor.

1236
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:30,831
It was the longest and roughest operation
I ever saw.

1237
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:34,071
Pretty feathery there for a while, wasn't it?

1238
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:37,835
It's going to be feathery
until she comes to.

1239
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:32,512
- You'd better get some rest now.
- No.

1240
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:35,592
Thank you, Nancy, but I couldn't sleep.

1241
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:40,075
- I'll make some coffee for you.
- All right.

1242
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:21,711
Doctor.

1243
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:27,550
Nancy?

1244
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:30,200
Nancy's here. I'm here.

1245
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:33,674
- Doctor?
- Yes.

1246
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:36,069
You must be quiet.

1247
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,071
It doesn't hurt so much.

1248
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:44,268
You're going to get better.

1249
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:47,151
Who is it?

1250
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,951
Who's here?

1251
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:54,711
It's Bob.

1252
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,391
Bob?

1253
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:02,716
Oh, Bob, I'm so glad you're here.

1254
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,915
Hold me.

1255
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,991
Hold me close.

1256
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,871
I didn't know.

1257
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,791
You didn't tell me.

1258
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,791
Lie still. Please.

1259
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,829
What is that?

1260
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:30,559
Helen, you've got to be quiet.

1261
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:33,955
But I think I see some light.

1262
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:37,315
Are you sure?

1263
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:40,437
You mustn't talk. Just rest.

1264
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:44,990
But I'm going to see! I know I am!

1265
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,871
Am I?

1266
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:51,155
Yes, my darling.

1267
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:53,674
You are going to see.

1268
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:56,518
I can see you.

1269
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:01,196
Please lie still. You must.

1270
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:04,954
Don't get excited. Not today.

1271
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:10,952
May I... May I get excited tomorrow?

1272
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,194
Yes.

1273
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,518
And you'll be with me?

1274
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:20,832
Yes, darling. I'll be with you tomorrow.

1275
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,950
Starting tomorrow,

1276
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:29,031
we'll never be apart.

1277
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:31,359
Tomorrow.

1278
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,511
Tomorrow.

1279
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:38,591
Oh, tomorrow.

1280
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:48,153
<i>Once you find the way,
you'll be bound.</i>

1281
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:50,276
<i>It'll obsess you.</i>

1282
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:54,638
<i>But, believe me,
it'll be a magnificent obsession.</i>
