00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,120
<i>They look like plums.</i>

7
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,470

8
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,730

<i> Episode 3</i>

10
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:42,550
Hey, your face... was it this serious?

11
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,270
That's bad.

12
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:52,380
Ca-ca-can you fix this?

13
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,020
Even if it's like this, to this extent, can you fix it?

14
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,080
You have to fix this. <i>You</i> have to fix this.

15
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,900
Even if you aren't the best doctor in the world,

16
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,610
even if you're a psycho, player, or fickly swindler,
 you have to fix me.

17
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,070
If not... if not, then you...

18
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,500



19
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,990
No... then I'm going to die here.

20
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,730
Fix me, please.

21
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,380
<i>♫ It looks like, it looks like spring will come... ♫</i>

22
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,500
Why should I? Huh?

23
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,510
Why should I treat the woman who made me suffer, by accusing me of being a murderer?

24
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,010
Are you nuts?

25
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,670
Hello? Has Korea's Gangnam's face become like this now!?

26
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,970
There is not even a ballpoint pen or a chair. Everything is gone!

27
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,580
<i>Come this instant!</i>

28
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,960
They say when it rains, it pours.

29
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,020
This doctor has terrible luck.

30
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,620
Why do you park this way with so little room?

31
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,590
The other cars have to go through the road.

32
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,320
Even when there's this many cameras, they broke in?

33
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,860
I'll check the cameras on this street, you get the ones over there.

34
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,790
- All of them?
- Yes. All of them.

35
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,060
Alone?

36
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,690
Yes.

37
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,030
<i>Wow, they sure took everything...</i>

38
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,920
Hong Do, why are you here? Are you alright?

39
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,060
I left your phone at your house, did you see it? I put it by the plants.

40
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,150
Are you the only detectives around here?

41
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,800
Well, there's nothing here, they took everything.

42
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,010
They must have come with a moving truck and taken everything. That's their method.

43
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,970
There are a lot of cameras (CCTV) out there. And when I came in,

44
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,350
I don't think the alarms rang.

45
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,180
You guys and this woman, really...

46
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,820
Why do you hang around?

47
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,060
I won't fix you. Go find the second best doctor in the world.

48
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,710
I don't believe you guys. Change me to another detective.

49
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,530
Anyways, this looks like the 5th time.

50
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,370
We're working on it, so just wait a little longer.

51
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,970
It's the 5th time and you haven't caught them?

52
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,040
Aigoo, these guys are at it.

53
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,650
<i>Firstly, tell us what is missing.</i>

54
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,690
I don't need anything else, I had 70 gold hearts and I need to find those.

55
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,220
-Where? 
-If you look out there, it was next to the bookcase.

56
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,370
You don't know the exact amount?

57
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,900
I think I counted to seventy.

58
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,700
When you first came in, you should have seen it. You have good memory. Hurry up and tell me.

59
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,010
Huh, how many? Hurry and tell me, louder. What did you say?

60
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,470
You shouldn't scream at a woman.

61
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,990
Hurry up and tell.

62
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,250
There were 8 pink ones?

63
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:09,470
That make it 72 then. It was 72.

64
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:14,770
Seventy-two. Let's first check about this, and then check the CCTVs.

65
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,640
<i>Yes.</i>

66
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,480
Why are so blunt about things?

67
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,310
Is there a CCTV in the office?

68
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,810
If I say no, are you going to believe me? Huh?

69
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,160
You guys find that out yourselves.

70
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,230
We have to find it. If you find it, contact me.

71
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,250
Ah. Hey, aren't you coming?

72
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,070
You must not want to be treated.

73
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:42,820
Hong Do, you are getting psychological treatment, right? I can look for another hospital for you. Hong Do...

74
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,590
<i>She's really strange.</i>

75
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,720
It was so hard for me to collect them.

76
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,940
The car isn't here either, this is bullsh*t!

77
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,110
Did you have to say it like that?

78
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,930
What?

79
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,140
Hey, just go. Go away while I'm saying it nicely.

80
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,710
You shouldn't talk with bad manners to the kind person who came to catch the thief.

81
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,620
No matter how uneducated you are.

82
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,530
Hey! I graduated from Harvard University.

83
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:18,790
I even have certificates for yacht, airplanes, and scuba diving. What else can I learn?

84
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:23,520
Your kidding me. Hey, you're useless. Get lost, go, go, go.

85
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,840
- What about the treatment?
- You're talking about the treatment.

86
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,410
Hey, look at the state of this hospital right now.

87
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,070
Go away, go, GO!

88
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,040
Just a moment ago you told me to follow you, now you're telling me to get lost!

89
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,560
Hey, hey, wait up. Hey. Take me to pick up my car.

90
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,990
-What in the world?
- Ugh. What's this smell?

91
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,640
Hey, do you wash your hair in the toilet?

92
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,810
Give it to me!

93
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:51,140
Hey, hurry and hop on. Hurry, hop on. Don't you want to get treatment?

94
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,730
We'll only grow apart if you act like this.

95
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,480
Let's go. Go, go!

96
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:01,100
Hey, you must be very desperate, even letting me take a ride.

97
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,780
Hey, were you pretending about having anthropobia?

98
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,040
Ah, I can't get a cold.

99
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,480
Why do you drive something that is so accident prone?

100
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,930
Hey. Why aren't you looking at the road? Where are you looking?

101
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:39,880
Ay, really, aigoo. Hey, I almost died because of you.

102
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,790
They fixed it up well.

103
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,380
Hey.

104
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,730
I think it's a good idea to use the helmet when you go out.

105
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,840
Why in the world would you want to get treatment?

106
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,220
- It doesn't affect how you live.
- It's none of your business.

107
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,030
-All you have to do is treat me.
- What?

108
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,440
Aren't you gonna answer? Don't you want the treatment?

109
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,680
I wanted to greet him.

110
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,090
What? Say it louder.

111
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,880
I wanted to say my greetings to him.

112
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,790
Comfortably, like everyone else. "Hello".

113
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,430
"Did you sleep well?" these things.

114
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,630
But what's with "Did you sleep well?".

115
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:24,470
It's a morning greeting that you say to someone,
 who slept with you.

116
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,350
Hey, don't picture it. Don't picture it!

117
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:35,730
You really want to date someone.

118
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:40,740
Fine. I'll just think that I'm saving a woman who never dated.

119
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,270
Let's get a consultation.

120
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,280
Since the hospital is in a bad state, I'll look for another place.

121
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,290
It's $350 per hour for consultations.

122
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,010
Why? Is it too cheap, compared to my skill? Don't you know how expensive things are in Gangnam?

123
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,020
Don't compare my prices to other people's prices!

124
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,320
You can measure how deep water is, but you can't measure a person's heart (the slang is saying you can't encrypt a person's thoughts and feelings).

125
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:15,360
But a psychological treatment is when we dig deeper.

126
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,380
- Crook.
- What?

127
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,650
Crazy punk, con-artist, hooligan, psycho, quack!

128
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,720
Bullsh*t, damn it, go screw yourself!

129
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:41,990
$350 per session? Then it's over $50 for ten minutes!

130
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,820
After paying that money, you're saying people are getting surgery from that guy?

131
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,220
His money is rotten!

132
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,520
I'm screwed.

133
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,160
I have to pack my luggage.

134
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,110
I decided to move into Grandfather's house.

135
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,130
<i> You rascal! Does moving take up the whole day?</i>

136
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,770
Don't make an excuse and come quickly while I'm speaking nicely.

137
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,530
I prepared the room you'll use-- Oh, get off of work.

138
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,930
Come and see it, and if you need things, you need to prepare them!

139
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,050
How long are you going to play? You're so lazy.

140
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,390
Are you fanning a burning house?

141
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,440
I'm never going there. Even if I bring up the question, why would I, in my hospital...

142
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,780
Ah, really. These stupid robbers.

143
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,820
Anyways, I'll take care of my business. I'm hanging up.

144
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,290
Opening my hospital again?

145
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:41,830
No... I'll just pretend that I'm starting fresh.

146
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,700
<i>Today Woo Yeon Woo's Dreaming Night has brought a very special guest.</i>

147
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,200
He was someone I've always wanted to meet.

148
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,220
Psychiatrist Hwa Tae Yong is here with us.

149
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,760
- Doctor, hello.
- Yes, hello.

150
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,970
Hwa Tae Yong?

151
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,140
The "great" Hwa Tae Yong?

152
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,060
I'm not really altering anything.

153
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,320
I just roughly clean...

154
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,680
You had to go there because no one wanted you.

155
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,690
- What kind of great thing is that? 
- <i>After reading your book, I really cried a lot.</i>

156
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,990
- Aigoo, seriously! You have a lot of reasons to cry! 
 -<i> The situations of you and the people in the book are very touching, but</i>

157
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,810
I respect how you treat the elders.

158
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,970
Is he Lee Soon Shin? Is he King Se Jong? Ha! She's respecting all sorts of things!

159
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,710
Hey, you should respect a passing mutt!

160
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,910
Ah!

161
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,920
You respect these kinds of things!

162
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:46,440
I got it. Ah, then Oppa will catch on quickly again.<i></i>

163
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,950
- Okay.
<i>- I feel it too...</i>

164
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,720
<i>You said you'll never take it, why did you change your mind? What's the reason?</i>

165
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,560
<i> I'm going to start from the beginning.</i>

166
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,830
What kind of smell is this? It's not like it's rotting, what is this?

167
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,970
What's with this? Did they cut off the electricity?

168
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,820
- Ah, this.
- Wow. Bravo, bravo.

169
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,400
Wow, the sunlight isn't even shining in, and it's reeking.

170
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:21,030
I have to get up from a place like this to be a resurrected hero! This is a visual that I wanted!

171
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,270
You're going to clean?

172
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:26,050
Grandma! Did you go to the bathroom?

173
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,590
<i> This man is very handsome! </i>

174
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,230
Do you want to eat with me and my son?

175
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,650
<i>- Grandma, do you like him?
- Yes.</i>

176
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,590
Do you want to get treatments from him?

177
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,120
He's a psychiatrist.

178
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,400
Ah, excuse me... ah.

179
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,310
Hey, hey, Ko Yi Suk, what's wrong?

180
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,040
- Hey.
- I'm alright. I'm alright.

181
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,720
Year 1952.

182
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,640
Wait a minute. 19...

183
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,940
19... 195...

184
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,350
About that grandma...

185
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:06,270
She's good at using the typewriter and she understood your words we...

186
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:11,360
Hey, don't talk nonsense.

187
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,520
What do you mean she's good at typing?

188
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,430
You have to trust her ability.

189
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,330
You told her to come, but then said that you don't need her.

190
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:23,490
And you said that you will call her later, but you are still ignoring her.

191
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,090
She's what?

192
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,450
What year? 19-

193
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:33,990
Hey, do you think this job is something anyone can do?

194
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,130
Do you think it'll be enough with playing Tazza well?

195
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:40,630
You have to pick the ingredients,

196
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,930
and she has to organize the things that don't make sense.

197
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:49,080
You have to know that. How will that Grandma know?

198
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,140
Aigoo. How is that grandma someone who can do everything?

199
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:59,400
She said that the only thing an elder can't do is to give birth. She is very intelligent.

200
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,120
Even if she is smart, she is still old.

201
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,220
You are older than her.

202
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,750
Hey, get out.

203
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,510
- Get lost.
- Yes.

204
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,170
It's not my fault. Then...

205
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,300
That, kid, really.

206
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,400
You had this before?

207
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,980
When I was treating Patient Park Man Dong.

208
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,920
I thought that it was only to him, but I didn't know that it would appear with other patients.

209
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,140
What is it? Is it the same symptom?

210
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,280
I didn't lose my conscious before.

211
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,290
When Park Man Dong tried to kill himself, there was a woman.

212
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,170
She has anthrophobia, but

213
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,270
when I'm near that woman my symptoms don't show up.

214
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:45,530
What is this? It's too early to determine it as PTSD.

215
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,430
We have to wait a month to see.

216
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,370
I thought that I avoided my mother's DNA, which caused her to have bipolar disorder.

217
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,310
I think I have a phobia of my patients.

218
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,730
Is it severe? Then you should take medication.

219
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,130
The medicine... I think the medicine is the helmet that she uses.

220
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,270
<i>What?</i>

221
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,330
Is there something like that?

222
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:10,400
There must be. Cancel all your consultations. You need to get treated first.

223
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,840
What do you mean treatment?

224
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,960
Where are you going? I'm sick.

225
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,580
To your house. Hey, lie some more.

226
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,900
You must have waited a lot for the call.

227
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,320
Yes, a little bit.

228
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,160
You can come at 7 o'clock on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. You only have to work a few hours.

229
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,840
Does the grandson of the family come often?

230
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,620
She said that he comes once in a while.

231
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,060
- Ah, Yi Suk?
- Yes.

232
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,560
Now he's going to live here.

233
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,640
Ah, yes, yes.

234
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:51,520
But he leaves early in the morning and comes late at night, so you will never see him.

235
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,560
But why are you like that?

236
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,060
Nothing, I just got curious with the picture.

237
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,940
Geum Shim bragged about him a lot, right?

238
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,120
Once he's here, I'll present him to you.

239
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,140
Yes.

240
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:12,640
Something with the bicycle. Bicycle.

241
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,520
A, B, C, D, E, you know the alphabet, right?

242
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,820
Huh? Okay. This is gonna take a lot of time.

243
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,660
Article, and then it goes one like that.

244
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,880
A, ar...A.

245
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,190
History, H, next one is...

246
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,450
- These are books, right?
- You're right.

247
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,510
Yes, I'll find them.

248
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:43,470
Where is it? Ar... Oh, oh.

249
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,250
You found it already?

250
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,080
How do I...(get the book)?

251
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,720
How to get up there?

252
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,680
Don't worry.

253
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,420
Oh God.

254
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,620
Okay, okay. Go up.

255
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,300
Okay.

256
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,180
History of...

257
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,890
"Bicycle Kingdom and Other Stories",

258
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,650
"Articles on Art Pics", "The History of Bicycles",

259
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,950
"Building Your Own Electric Bicycle".

260
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:52,500
The books are about the evolution of cars, its history, and electric cars.

261
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:58,420
I looked it up. There are better books than these, but I don't see them here.

262
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,710
So I'll borrow some from the library when I get off of work tomorrow.

263
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,360
Look here, this book...

264
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,160
Forget it. I said forget it.

265
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,420
I will pay for the books I need.

266
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:15,800
You should preview the book after borrowing it in the library.

267
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,750
Are you bragging in front of me?

268
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:26,000
You are saying that I can't read this?

269
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,260
You are mistaken. Okay?

270
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,850
- No-
- Those are the people who are different just and just write the ordinal.

271
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:40,470
I'm not just talking nonsense.

272
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,630
- Time and title! 
- No matter how much I try to brag,

273
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,190
I can't follow you.

274
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:52,650
You are the master of bicycles.

275
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,930
I don't have a degree for that.

276
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,210
There isn't anyone who can judge me (for the degree).

277
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,340
But still, you ride bicycles.

278
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,000
Your arm and leg muscles are very strong!

279
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,840
Does that happen when you ride a bicycle a lot?

280
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,320
Touch it once and talk.

281
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,520
It's ok, touch it.

282
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,880
You bad... Here touch my leg once.

283
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,470
Did you stay in the room all day?

284
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,890
What are you thinking about that you're like that?

285
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,770
Moon Sun.

286
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,550
This is no time to be like this.

287
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,470
Tomorrow is Father's birthday.

288
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,080
I need to buy a birthday present and go shopping.

289
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,380
Doctor, I think we should talk next time.

290
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:09,960
Moon Sun. Hwang Moon Sun?

291
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,110
Didn't Chairman have a birthday party last week?

292
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,900
I thought that he did.

293
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,710
It's all right.

294
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,820
Did you find out who?

295
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,860
- No. 
- Drink this.
- Thank you.

296
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,280
I think it's going to be hard to find the culprit, even if we look hard.

297
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,640
- Yes, hello?
- You know the phone number of that woman, right?

298
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,200
Why Cha Hong Do? What is it?

299
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,920
Her name is Cha Hong Do? It's as old-fashioned as herself.

300
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,870
<i> I told you that I can't tell you private information.</i>

301
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,880
What is your reason? Are you in a hurry?

302
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,500
It's a matter that can kill a person.

303
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,100
<i> I'm in a rush, so make her call me... No, that's fine. I will send you an address,</i>

304
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,900
so tell her to come to this address tomorrow.

305
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,370
And did you find the culprit?

306
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:13,610
We are checking the CCTV. As soon as possible--

307
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,800
This doctor is so rude!

308
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,630
- That annoying doctor? 
- Yeah!

309
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,050
He's a psycho.

310
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:26,120
And how can we catch the culprit with a CCTV like this?

311
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,070
<i> We can't see anything.</i>

00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,457
- Why did he open a hospital in a place like this?
- Be quiet.

314
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:39,270
Hello. I have two names.

315
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:43,870
I'm Cha Hong Do or Oh Hyung Min. Aren't they both pretty?

316
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:48,550
My job? I'm a secretary of the Chairman.

317
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,290
What college did I go to?

318
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,620
Why are you asking a question like that? So old-fashioned.

319
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,150
Highest level of schooling?

320
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,550
Middle school.

321
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,310
Detective Jang will be surprised if he finds out that I quit high school.

322
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,590
No, he's not the kind of person,

323
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,810
who will judge a person because of that.

324
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:29,810
Now, I'll cut this.

325

Wait, wait! Wait a minute!

335
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:47,560
Can you give me some of your time? Just for a little while.

336
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,540
It's weird to talk here, right?

337
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,270
Would you like to go that way?

338
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,610
I'll take your hand for a minute.

339
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:06,210
I don't want you to run away.

340

That way.

341
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,860
Hong Do, have you eaten?

342
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:24,890
It seems like I am assisting a grandma, because you are acting like this.

343
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,550
I was kidding. Was it not funny?

344
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:36,340
We're almost there. Just a little longer.

345
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,240
Hong Do, get in.

346
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:56,490
If it's like this, it will be more comfortable for you. Trust me and get in.

347
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,090
Here.

348
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,440
Oh, careful, careful.

349
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:30,070
I turned on the heater, so it will be warmer than outside. The window...

350
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:37,050
Excuse me, Hong Do. The window. The button, the button.

351
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:40,430
I'm saying it's this way.

352
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,350
Ah, that...

353
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,160
I'm sorry.

354
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,280
How is it? It's okay, right?

355
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,290
It hides your vision and stops the wind.

356
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,340
But what did you prepare for me today?

357
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,520
Oh, seaweed!

358
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,420
From all the side dishes that you make me, the seaweed is the best.

359
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,730
It's the best!

360
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:30,900
But do you know that I don't eat this seaweed as a side dish?

361
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,860
It's very delicious, crispy, and salty.

362
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,450
It's amazing with beer.

368
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,000
Seven years ago, the thief who was in your house...

369
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,290
was the first criminal that I saw on the actual scene.

370
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,200
From then on, I gained confidence.

371
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,800
And every time you thank me, I feel better because I am reminded of that time.

372
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:19,730
It makes me think that it was good becoming a cop, despite my family's wishes.

373
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:28,100
That's why I'm asking. I want to be your help.

374
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,910
If there's anything you need, tell me everything.

375
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:36,140
You could ask me to look up a hospital or become your friend,

376
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:41,500
or everything a man can do, such as fixing the light or the computer.

377

Rascal. He avoided well.

How can you be so cold?

388

How can you cut off a person so coldly?

389
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:45,250
- I have nothing to say to you.
- I do, okay?

390
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,190
You must have misunderstood because I look chic or cool,

391

but I am a warm-hearted person.

Are you like this

394
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,780
because I didn't let you take part in the broadcast?

395

Was it that lady from the swimming pool?

449
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:40,020
I don't know. There were many women.

The reason is you.

453
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:02,060
If you get bitten by a poisonous snake, you can make an antidote with the venom in the snake.

454
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,220
So you, who is an antidote, is poison.

Do you know what I'm saying?

456

You have to take responsibility.

How are you going to do that?

458
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:18,630
- You are seriously killing a person. 
- What? 
- What do you want me to do?

459
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,670
There isn't anything much you have to do.

460
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,920
All you have to do is be by my side when a patient comes, okay?

461
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,400
Well, I'll leave a spot for you over there.

462
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:36,260
To determine if you are my antidote and how my symptoms are, I have to experiment.

463
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,590
Let's clean this place first.

464
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,680
The inside is very earth-loving.

465
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:47,100
Then, how about my counselling?

466
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,710

467
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,130
You acted stupid, but you are actually using your brain.

468
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:55,170
You want a discount for the consultation?

469
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,860
Really... Fine, it's only because I'm feeling good today.

470
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,910
You can at least clean, right?

471
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,200
$300. Okay?

472
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,890
This woman is really funny.

473
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:17,120
I am sticking up to your pleading offer!

474
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,920
Ah, fine then! $250. Hey! I'll cut it down to $230!

475
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,640
What kind of woman is she?

476
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,690
I can't come on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings.

477
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,830
Do I seem that easy?

478
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,970
You, really. Just because I got tricked by you. I don't need it. Go, go.

479
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:39,040
Just think that we are doing each other a favor.

480
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:43,140
I know that you aren't that kind of good doctor, but you should try free consultations.

481
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,570
I'll just think that I'm helping you for free.

482
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,440
- Yes?
<i>- Go to the Gangnam police station now.</i>

483
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:54,200
They caught the robber? But why did they contact you?

484
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:58,170
Huh? A patient?

485
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,150
What kind of patient? Come here. Right now.

486
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:04,770
- Money...
- Only concerned about the money...

487
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,970
Okay, okay. Hurry, hurry. Just come here.

488
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,100
All right, I'm going now.

489
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:14,870
Ah, really! I'm going to go crazy! You should have called instead. Hey you!

490
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,920
- Where is the guardian?
- I'm trying to reach him, but he is not picking up.

491
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,330
Is he the psychiatrist that they contacted?

492
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,860
I don't know. But why are they together?

493
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,920
Can you turn it?

494
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:49,570
Go over there and cover her up or something! Quickly!

495
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:54,770
Oh, really. What are you looking at? Do you own thing.

496
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,970
- Ah, really. He looks like some sort of pig. 
 - Should we really try it?

497
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:03,740
He looks like a weasel. So annoying.

498
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:08,480
Cover her up correctly if you're going to cover her up. Her shoulders, shoulder! Yes, like that!

499
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,410
Wrap it around her!

500
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,690
Really.

501
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,880
- She's shaking. 
 - Are you cold?

502
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,030
You're not hurt anywhere?

503
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,390
What is your name? Huh?

504
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,010
I don't think she's shivering because she's cold.

505
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:29,730
Excuse me. Here.

506
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,870
Follow this. Here. Here, follow this.

507
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:37,120
Excuse me, Miss. Come to your senses.

508
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,150
Why did you take off your clothes? 
Is someone chasing you down?

509
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,710
Did you run away because somebody was chasing you?

510
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,930
Don't talk so aggressively.

511
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:49,110
Why? I did this to you when you couldn't talk. Don't you remember?

512
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,080
I didn't start talking because of you, okay?

513
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:57,240
What do you mean? The detectives thought that your mouth was glued together.

514
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,710
<i>I took off your helmet and opened your mouth. Don't you remember?</i>

515
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,410
<i>Are they even properly doing their job?</i>

516
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:07,010
Huh? How can you do your job like this?

517
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:10,830
- You can't even catch a robber. 
- Yeah, we...

518
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,040
Um...

519
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,190
They say if you eat something sweet, some of your tension will go away.

520
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:31,750
What are you doing, huh? Are you still eating these candies?

521
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,030
Why did you eat that? Detective Jang gave it to me.

522
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,390
Really.

523
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,730
Hey! Hey!

524
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:53,740
- G-give me some of those candies! 
 - I don't have any.

525
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:57,650
Don't you see the patient? Quickly, quickly!

526
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:03,450
Really. Give it to me now!

527
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,770
- Give me some. Hurry, hurry.
- I don't have any.

528
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:16,370
- I told you to give me some, quickly! 
 - I don't have any!

529
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,630
I only had two, but you ate both.

530
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,140
Ugh, this is so frustrating! Just give it to me already!

531
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,880
Just give me one! I'll buy you more!

532
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,870
I'll just get you a box.

533
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:32,580
I'l just buy you the factory.

534
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:37,100
- Just give me some! 
- I told you I didn't have any!
 - Ah, really, just give me some!

535
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,160
Where am I?

536
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,270
Have you come to your senses?

537
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,690
I think she's come back to her senses.

538
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,020
I can't see.

539
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,660
Do you know where this is?

540
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,730
<i>I told her that a diabetic patient needs to eat her meals.</i>

541
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:56,720
Last time, too, it happened because she fasted for two days, saying she was on a diet.

542
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,590
I don't know these medical things, but you have to take care of her well.

543
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,290
If something happens, there could be a big incident.

544
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:03,530
<i> Yes, I'm worried of that happening. </i>

545
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:08,140
She never caused trouble while growing up. You are sure that she does not have a psychological problem, right?

546
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,700
As I told you, it is hypoglycemia.

547
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,560
When you have diabetes, if you don't eat properly,

548
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,420
due to too much insulin, you can get hypoglycemia.

549
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:19,970
There are various symptoms for insulin shock; but the symptoms your daughter gets are just a bit unusual.

550
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,390
Yoohoo!

551
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:25,110
I wrote down the report. Let's go.

552
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,520
You're nice and smart.

553
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,340
She's so nice and pretty, but she never dated once.

554
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,560
She is so busy with work.

555
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,130
She's a curator, you see.

556
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,590
Let's just go, Mom.

557
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:40,860
How did such a girl run around the whole town?

558
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:45,420
No rumors will spread outside, will they? 
She has to get married soon.

559
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,990
<i> What do you mean marriage? I don't even have a boyfriend. </i>

560
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,220
Hurry, let's go.

561
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,560
Don't worry, we will take care of it well.

562
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,930
Yes, please don't worry.

563
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,690
Thank you. Then keep up the good work.

564
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:00,460
Make sure you eat before you get an insulin injection. Understood?

565
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,220
Please be careful.

566
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,240
<i> Goodbye. </i>

567
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,060
What are you doing there?

568
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,120
What happened?

569
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,780
You know the Team Leader?

570
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,470
Do I seem like someone who would do anyone any favors?

571
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:34,020
I just had something to talk about because I'm a doctor.

572
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:38,800
But that robber that wiped out my hospital. Is he Lupin or Hong Gildong?

573
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,330
He doesn't seem to be getting caught.

574
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,590
It will be resolved soon.

575
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,760
You're just talking big...

576
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,350
Hong Do, did you come safely?

577
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:49,760
I ate your seaweed well. It wasn't too salty. It was delicious.

578
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,560
Where are you going? I'll take you there.

579
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,740
No, you can't! We have a meeting later today.

580
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:59,550
We have to celebrate your new job.

581
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,170
Let's go, my employee.

582
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:06,080
Don't play around. Do your job well.

583
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,280
Hey, get off.

584
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:25,640
You don't even know if he is your friend or enemy.

585
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,320
That's why you still have a long way to go.

586
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,570
I am fixing your illness and giving you a job.

587
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:34,930
If you do well, I can support you so you can do well with Detective Jang.

588
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:39,120
Are you that happy?

589
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,550
Hey, but how are you going to seduce a man when you face is that red?

590
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:46,900
I know that to you, who is lacking, thinks of Detective Jang

591
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,010
as a prince on a horse; even if he is just normal,

592
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:51,560
but he won't like you if you keep pushing yourself forward.

593
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,890
You're not even a elementary school kid.

594
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:59,380
She didn't even have a mental problem. I came here for nothing.

595
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,290
I am always so unlucky when I meet you!

596
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,150
Let's rethink your coming to work for me.

597
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:06,080
That girl came to her senses after eating the candy I gave her.

598
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,600
As if you gave it to her because you knew...

599
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,820
You didn't even know yourself...

600
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,870
Move.

601
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:14,290
Move!

602
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:25,900
When I went to Georgetown, in the library, I found a book of Stanislavski,

603
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,020
and it inspired me greatly.

604
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:32,300
Back then, I got into acting.

605
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,380
Yamasaki Masakazu, Rob Cohen,

606
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,930
Stella Adler, Keith Jonstone.

607
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:45,440
When I read them, I feel that acting has become a part of me.

608
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,720
That's why rather than being taught by you,

609
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:57,080
I just need a little bit of advice or support.

610
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,400
I will show you Phantom.

611
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:52,670
Hey! There is a cockroach!

612
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:59,400
Hey, you can't wear a helmet, hat, mask, sunglasses or any sort of those things anymore, got it?

613
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,500
This is a hospital.

614
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:07,090
When patients see you with your helmet, don't you think they'll get scared and stop coming?

615
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:09,590
Now, let's clean!

616
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,340
If you're not going to help, how about getting out?

617
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:20,870
Where would I go? A patient might come.

618
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:22,820
I'm not that kind of doctor.

619
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,810
You consulted a patient after drinking.

620
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:29,170
Stop talking about what I already know.

621
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:32,450
Let's talk about something new, Free Helper.

622
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:36,600
But when you consult a patient, do I really have to be here?

623
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,010
Of course. That's what your job is.

624
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:42,030
Is that really okay?

625
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,880
The patients would feel uncomfortable.

626
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,460
You're the one who'll feel uncomfortable.

627
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,480
Aish.

628
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:54,800
But you're pretty good at talking comfortably to me.

629
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,610
This sausage is really good.

630
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:03,900
Oh, Detective Jang is here. Eat this.

631
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,070
Detective Jang.

632
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:05,960
What?

633
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,190
Detective Jang, this is the person who sued you.

634
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:11,090
Seriously.

635
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:15,460
Hello, Ko Se Ro.

636
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,600
Right.

637
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,320
Please sit down.

638
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,140
Yes.

639
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:28,950
I'm really sorry, but I don't remember anything about that time.

640
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:33,230
So you threw the stone, but you don't know if a worm was hit,

641
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:36,850
or tadpole was hit?

642
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,640
I understand.

643
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,910
I was chasing a girl with Detective Yang when...

644
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:44,350
No, I will just tell you how if affected me.

645
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:47,940
That day, I was in a middle of shooting for a movie.

646
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:54,570
It determined whether I will grow into an actress who will lead this generation.

647
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:56,580
It was a very important moment.

648
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:03,100
However, at that time, you two showed up and ruined it.

649
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:07,590
I know the shooting that day got cancelled, but outside of that, what is wrong?

650
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:10,450
It's not just a matter of being wrong.

651
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:14,870
You just stepped on a rising star's future.

652
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:19,300
A future of an actress, who could become Angelina Jolie or Meryl Streep.

653
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,750
Your prononciation is very good.

654
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:24,520
I don't expect you two to understand.

655
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,510
And nothing would change even if you said you understood.

656
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:32,600
The bikini, sunglasses, nail and pedicure that I spent money for that role...

657
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,060
These are the receipts.

658
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:41,230
And I don't think you can compensate for my future.

659
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,830
So I won't demand it.

660
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,850
Thank you.

661
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:53,030
$2,730... $2730!

662
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,270
You want me to compensate this?

663
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:57,030
Yes.

664
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:01,330
And apologize. Sincerely apologize.

665
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,180
When will you do my consultation?

666
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:16,020
Huh?

667
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,840
Come here.

668
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,260
I said to come.

669
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,540
Now.

670
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:29,190
You cleaned well, good work.

671
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:35,530
Wow, how does your face turn red so quickly?

672
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:38,610
How do you feel?

673
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:44,440
Your temperature went up.

674
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,220
And you probably can feel it. How do you feel?

675
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:52,450
Just try to express how you feel now in words.

676
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:53,650
I'm uncomfortable.

677
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:55,070
How are you uncomfortable?

678
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,120
Why do you keep asking?

679
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,690
Can you not ask me and just tell me how you can fix me?

680
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:03,980
Are you a doctor? What do you think you're...

681
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,250
Fine.

682
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,570
Again.

683
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:17,440
What is the most uncomfortable thing to you right now?

684
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,560
The way you look at me.

685
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,230
How do I look at you right now?

686
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:27,030
You're thinking that I'm ugly.

687
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,740
No.

688
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:34,060
Is it that fun to play with people's weaknesses?

689
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,420
What did I do? It's just the truth.

690
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,030
- What about you? / - What?

691
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:41,950
You have to be focused on the most in the world and be respected.

692
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:46,160
You don't care whether people are hurt, and you never relate.

693
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,850
Being afraid of people's stares may be my weakness,

694
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:53,700
you are just full of weaknesses! Weakness Man!

695
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:59,010
What the?

696
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:05,040
Now that I look at it, it must be true.

697
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:13,480
He said he would treat me.

698
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:17,070
And he throws a tantrum there.

699
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:20,710
I mean, what does he know that he keeps talking nonsense? Ah, seriously.

700
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:23,610
<i>Your trap!</i>

701
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:27,210
You're being punished.

702
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,130
He's going to tell me to come out again today. What should I do?

703
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:41,020
I still haven't prepared my mind yet.

704
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,650
Hello?

705
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:51,730
Hey, come to Oh Hospital in Seochodong. Don't make me wait.

706
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:54,560
H-hello?

707
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:01,070
Did he say "come"?

708
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:05,370
Not "get out"?

709
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,890
I told you I was going to pick you up,
 why did you come all the way here?

710
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:21,000
<i> If you have to stop by my house, it will take longer. It's more efficient this way.</i>

711
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,040
- Please get in.
- Yes.

712
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:27,930
How many adults are coming today?

713
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:30,260
<i>- I'll clean it.
- No, no.</i>

714
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:33,420
I told many family members to come.

715
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:36,230
- What?
- It's fun.

716
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,250
Hey, come slowly.

717
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:16,850
Why are you driving so recklessly?

718
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:23,810
Hey, why is your face like that? Is this because of yesterday?

719
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:27,180
I understand and apologize about everything, so calm down.

720
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,750
Did something happen with you?

721
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,740
For now, tell me later. Follow me.

722
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,630
Wait, wait. But...

723
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,070
I'll wait here.

724
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:42,970
Follow me. That crazy naked woman is in pain.

725
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:46,350
- Where?
- She says her heart (mind) hurts.

726
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:50,350
Why would she be in pain? I'm jealous of her.

727
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:55,340
That's right, you should be jealous about your body.

728
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:59,680
I am jealous. She has couple rings with her mom.
- Couple rings?

729
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,110
There relationship must be really good,

730
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:03,940
to have the same rings.

731
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,730
Really?

732
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:14,310
You must be dreaming about having
couple rings with Detective Jang.

733
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,710
Hey, I can't take it anymore, really.

734
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:22,150
Hey, follow me. I'm going crazy.

735
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,950
Did you have this kind of situation before?

736
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:30,980
No.

737
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:36,150
She doesn't have allergies, but she's been like this since that night two days ago

738
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:38,910
They say that she doesn't have food poisoning or an allergy.

739
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:43,320
I called you because the doctor was worried.

740
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:48,550
That's the lady I saw at the police station. Come sit here.

741
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:52,000
Don't worry, she's more comfortable that way.

742
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,110
I had a lot of work, so I think is because of the stress.

743
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:57,910
I don't have any problems mentally.

744
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:02,430
My mom told you to come uselessly. 
 Mom, go home and rest.

745
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:05,360
You slept here yesterday. If you keep doing that, it'll be bad for you.

746
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,030
It's okay.

747
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:14,130
You two have matching rings.

748
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:17,370
She said we should do it. Is it pretty?

749
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:19,860
Yes, it looks good.

750
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:27,470
Should we do this kind of game? Tell each other our weaknesses.

751
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:30,820
You must know each other's weaknesses.

752
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,270
What are your daughter's weaknesses?

753
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:36,700
My daughter is too nice, but that's it.

754
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,010
Then your mother's weakness?

755
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:41,800
Don't think too much about it, just say it comfortably one by one.

756
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:45,850
She treasures her mother too much,

757
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:51,130
so when she was young, she wrote that she respected her mother the most in the world.

758
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:53,290
Yeah.

759
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,640
You said that those symptoms showed up since two days ago.

760
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,120
Did something happened with that?

761
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,600
I'm not sure, I don't think anything happened.

762
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,320
I scolded her.

763
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,480
She kept saying nonsense, like

764
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:11,930
she's not going to get married or stay single forever. She is still immature.

765
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:13,880
She should just get married and have a child.

766
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,230
If you just get insulin and don't eat,

767
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:19,570
you knew that you would get insulin shock, didn't you?

768
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:27,270
You knew it? You knew so you didn't eat on purpose. But why?

769
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,170
Because you talk too much.

770
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:31,990
And?

771
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,870
- She thinks that she is always telling the truth. 
- And?

772
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:39,950
She thinks that she is the only one who is nice, kind, and respectful,

773
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:43,950
and she thinks that other people are all lacking, rude, and stupid.

774
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,690
She just thinks that she's the best.

775
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:47,180
What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

776
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:51,270
I didn't tell you because you might get upset.

777
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:53,190
I have no thoughts of getting married.

778
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:57,210
Because I know how hard it was to live after dad abandoned you,

779
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:01,250
I'm going to live alone. You aren't always right.

780
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:05,250
Don't you know how much I hate when you act like you are God and act all mighty?

781
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:10,100
I don't want to be like you. I don't like how you treat me like a child,

782
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:15,340
and I am sick of you cosplaying like a warm mother.

783
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:28,070
How did you know that

784
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:30,430
that woman did not like her mother?

785
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:35,470
Couple ring. No matter how well the mother and daughter get along, they all have things that they don't like about each other.

786
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:38,030
I just said it, but they exploded.

787
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:42,280
Then about her not eating on purpose
and running around naked,

788
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,210
was all because of her mother?

789
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:47,940
Would she have done that if she knew?

790
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:52,160
She just subconsciously thought about how much she doesn't like her mother.

791
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,280
And she got sick because she had to pretend that she likes something she doesn't.

792
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,550
- But I took it out of her.
- Wow.

793
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:02,190
You got to know all that just by the couple rings?

794
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:05,880
Why? Is it something good?

795
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,180
Then what will happen to that mother and daughter?

796
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,650
Their relationship looked good.

797
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:15,480
If you like something, do you like it forever? And if you don't like something, do you hate it forever?

798
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,770
People aren't that simple.

799
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:21,080
A little.

800
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:23,130
A little what?

801
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:25,270
It was a little...

802
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,670
great.

803
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:31,110
Who? Me?

804
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:33,080
Are you acknowledging me?

805
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,120
Yes.

806
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,750
Is that right? You? Hey.

807
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:42,130
Women, they like it when things are done great.

808
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:47,730
I got it. Hey, I'm happy. I'm going to give you a prize today.

809
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:48,830
A prize?

810
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:55,800
Before, you wanted to say to detective Jang "Did you sleep well?" Let's do that.

811
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:59,060
Nonsense. How am I going to do that?

812
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:03,010
I'll help you, okay? You can do it.

813
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:04,970
You don't want to?

814
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:07,160
If you don't want to, forget it.

815
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:38,080
All right. Let's say it.

816
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,680
The illness that I kept hidden in my heart.

817
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:47,750
Look at that woman. If she talked with her mother in advance, she wouldn't have gotten sick.

818
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,740
"Did you sleep well?"

819
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:00,280
I can't stand it.

820
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:03,750
"Did you sleep well?"

821
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,570
"Did you sleep well?"

822
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:10,590
Ah, no.

823
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:15,050
<i>♫ I want to love ♫</i>

824
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:19,910
Why is he calling me? It's so early.

825
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:22,700
Hello?

826
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:26,630
Hey! You know Detective Jang's house address, right? Tell me.

827
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:29,460
You're his stalker so you'll know!

828
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,920
Why do you want to know his address?

829
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:37,140
Did you even get memory loss now? Wow.

830
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:40,700
There's was something that you wanted to say in the morning.

831
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,440
Don't think about running away and quickly come out.

832
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,830
I'm going to see for myself.

833
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:50,810
You are really going to come? Are you coming to watch fire burn?

834
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:54,290
<i>Yes, I am going to see it for myself.</i>
In moments like this, you just

835
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:58,720
say "Thank you, Great Dr. Ko," just like that.

836
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,870
Got it!

837
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,200
"Did you...

838
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:16,570
sleep well?"

839
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:23,910
<i>Hey, Helmet, go for it.</i>

840
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:28,180
Until when are you going to stand there like that. It's already late.

841
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,900
Go. Cha Hong Do.

842
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:34,430
Oh, how frustrating!

843
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:38,890
Hey, go! Go! That's it.

844
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:49,450
I can't. Oh, I can't. I can't. I can't.

845
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:52,180
Go, hurry. I told you to go!

846
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:56,610
All right. Let's say one thing. Just one thing.

847
01:00:56,610 --> 01:01:01,070
Right. You just have to say one thing. One thing. You can do it.

848
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:06,660
Let's not panic, let's not panic. Just one thing.

849
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:10,520
<i>- Min Ho, take your lunch box.</i>
- I'm late!

850
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:15,070
Urgh, how frustrating. Today is ruined.

851
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:37,750
Oh, Hong Do. What's up so early?

852
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:40,170
You took off your helmet?

853
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:44,100
Did you...? Did you...?

854
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:49,870
Did you...? Did...? Did...?

855
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:52,170
Oh, sleep...

856
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,720
Detective Jang, I like you.

857
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:03,850
<i>♫ Stay, just like the day when we first met, stay ♫</i>

858
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:08,470
Did she do it? Did she?

859
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:11,620
Look at that expression.

860
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:37,150
<i> Didn't my method work well?</i>

861
01:02:37,150 --> 01:02:41,130
<i>I said that I liked him. I said "Detective Jang, I like you."</i>

862
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:43,520
<i>Say it to me. Think of me as Detective Jang.</i>

863
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,940
<i> Do you really hate it that much?</i>

864
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:46,390
<i>I couldn't dream of it.</i>

865
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:49,610
<i> Are you doing something with me? Am I a part of an experiment?</i>

866
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:52,030
<i> I thought that you were dumb, but you actually catch on quickly.</i>

867
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:55,190
<i> It's strong! You scene-maker!</i>

868
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:58,730
<i>Elder! Elder! Excuse me!</i>

869
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:00,140
<i>Aigoo!</i>

870
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:02,710
<i>I am getting married.</i>
