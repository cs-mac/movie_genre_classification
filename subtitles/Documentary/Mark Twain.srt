1
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:19,709
It all started one day...

2
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:22,014
...after Tom heard about
Becky Thatcher...

3
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:25,158
...going down to see 
Saint Louis with the judge.

4
00:02:25,593 --> 00:02:30,553
It just worked on him thinking
about her down there having fun.

5
00:02:30,898 --> 00:02:34,834
Time is slipping away,
and I'm getting older and older, Huck.

6
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:39,165
There's no wars breaking out,
no continents to explore.

7
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,104
No way a man can make
a name for hisself.

8
00:02:43,143 --> 00:02:46,476
And now Becky exploring.
What an outrage.

9
00:02:46,647 --> 00:02:50,014
I heard tell the Saint Louis 
papers been talking about...

10
00:02:50,184 --> 00:02:51,811
...some kind of balloon up there.

11
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:53,977
Suppose Becky will see it.

12
00:02:54,154 --> 00:02:56,349
But probably not.

13
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:02,920
-That's it.
-What?

14
00:03:03,097 --> 00:03:06,191
All the continents and stuff been
discovered by Christopher Columbus.

15
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:09,461
But for certain sure,
nobody has charted the skies.

16
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:11,696
What the sam hill are you
carrying on about?

17
00:03:11,872 --> 00:03:14,272
The balloon in the papers
near Saint Louis.

18
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:15,430
What about it?

19
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:19,545
You couldn't see an adventure
hanging from the end of your nose.

20
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:22,147
Full steam ahead.

21
00:03:29,056 --> 00:03:32,492
Get your paper right here.
Halley's comet coming.

22
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,890
Extra. Extra.

23
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:39,430
The countryside was humming
because of the balloon...

24
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,626
...and folks said there was 
a comet heading our way.

25
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:45,769
Penny a paper. Penny a paper.

26
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,805
--like even these ones.
He might let me at least...

27
00:03:49,977 --> 00:03:52,207
...you know,
get on and walk around....

28
00:03:53,614 --> 00:03:56,515
-It's taken me a long time.
-Doomed!

29
00:03:58,352 --> 00:04:03,187
But once lost,
I could not find it with a dog.

30
00:04:05,826 --> 00:04:09,990
-Great guns.
-Amazing.

31
00:04:10,164 --> 00:04:12,928
Surely, Mr. Twain,
you aren't fool enough...

32
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,092
...to actually travel
in that fantastic contraption.

33
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:20,070
The man with a new idea is a fool...

34
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,300
...until the idea succeeds.

35
00:04:23,477 --> 00:04:27,675
Why, Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn,
whatever are you doing here?

36
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:29,509
-Nothing.
-Why, Becky Thatcher...

37
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:31,810
...land sakes, what a coincidence...

38
00:04:31,985 --> 00:04:35,079
...you being here the same time
as Huck and me.

39
00:04:38,092 --> 00:04:40,287
Isn't he grand?

40
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:43,430
I got up close so I could see,
and he stopped.

41
00:04:43,597 --> 00:04:45,258
He let me shake his hand.

42
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:47,366
-You shook his--?
-Well, that's nothing.

43
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:52,028
He's invited us to be the first 
inspectors of his balloon.

44
00:04:52,206 --> 00:04:54,333
-He has?
-Is that just more of your hot air?

45
00:04:54,508 --> 00:04:57,306
Come, step lively, Huck.
We'd best be getting aboard.

46
00:04:58,045 --> 00:05:00,343
So long, Becky.

47
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:02,743
Tom....

48
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:07,220
Where you really going
in that thing, Mr. Twain?

49
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:09,514
Going traveling?

50
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,955
Travel has no longer
any charm for me.

51
00:05:13,127 --> 00:05:16,290
I've seen all the foreign 
countries I care to see...

52
00:05:16,463 --> 00:05:18,693
...except for heaven and hell...

53
00:05:18,866 --> 00:05:25,135
...and I have only a vague curiosity
as concerns one of those.

54
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:30,034
No, friends,
I go to meet the comet.

55
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,144
He's not really gonna do that.

56
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:36,840
-Yes indeed, I surely plan to.
-But that's dangerous.

57
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:39,178
Come on, Huck.
Come on, hurry up.

58
00:05:39,353 --> 00:05:42,186
You're nothing but a liar
and a stowaway, Tom Sawyer.

59
00:05:42,356 --> 00:05:43,846
You too, Huck Finn.

60
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:46,692
You mustn't.

61
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:52,831
I came in with 
Halley's comet in 1835...

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,058
...when I was born.

63
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:58,694
And I expect to go out with it.

64
00:06:03,143 --> 00:06:06,579
Oh, I'm looking forward to that.

65
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:21,124
-Welcome to the hurricane deck.
-It stopped.

66
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:24,423
-Whoopee, let's go.
-What in tarnation is this thing?

67
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:26,998
Be careful, Tom.

68
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:33,830
-Tom, where are you?
-Great Scott, what a contraption.

69
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,075
-Huck.
-Look at that, Tom.

70
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:44,240
I thought I saw someone.

71
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:46,818
Gee willikers.

72
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:50,245
Look at this.

73
00:06:55,596 --> 00:06:57,223
Huck.

74
00:06:58,398 --> 00:07:00,423
-Whoopee.
-Oh, no.

75
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:03,399
-We're on our way.
-Oh, no!

76
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,435
Great Scott, we gotta get off.

77
00:07:05,606 --> 00:07:07,767
Off? What's the matter with you?

78
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:09,499
Now, I'll be celebrated.

79
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:12,668
Tom Sawyer, the "aeronort."

80
00:07:12,913 --> 00:07:16,144
-That'll show that Becky Thatcher.
-Show her what?

81
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:20,719
Caught you out, didn't I, Tom Sawyer?
You are stowaways.

82
00:07:20,888 --> 00:07:26,019
-Becky, you're no balloon inspector.
-Neither are you.

83
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,118
Are you ever gonna catch it
when your Aunt Polly gets ahold of--

84
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:33,027
-Welcome to the hurricane deck.
-Boys. Tom. Huck.

85
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,998
-Mark Twain.
-And Becky Thatcher.

86
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:39,764
-How did he know our names?
-Hello, my angelfish.

87
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,707
More every day you remind me
of my wife, Livy, God rest her.

88
00:07:45,212 --> 00:07:49,012
Same combination
of innocence and sand.

89
00:07:49,182 --> 00:07:52,515
Same carefree laugh of a girl.

90
00:07:52,686 --> 00:07:55,883
What happened to Livy,
Mr. Twain?

91
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:58,020
To the helm.
We've work to do.

92
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:03,355
Mr. Twain, there's been
some kind of an accident.

93
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,260
I think a miscalculation.

94
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:10,494
-Not by a considerable sight.
-But we're taking off.

95
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:12,536
What a view.

96
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:15,900
-How are we gonna get down?
-You keep a tight tongue, Huck.

97
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:19,705
-This is bully up here, Mr. Twain.
-This is glorious.

98
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,643
-Did we ever strike it lucky.
-Yeah.

99
00:08:21,815 --> 00:08:24,841
-How high are we?
-How are we gonna get back down?

100
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:30,388
-Down is not our destination, my boy.
-Oh, no.

101
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:31,956
You mean we're--?

102
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,652
-Where are we going?
-To Halley's comet.

103
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:37,057
Halley's comet?

104
00:08:37,497 --> 00:08:40,762
-We'd get--
-Burned to a crisp.

105
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:43,797
It will be the greatest
disappointment of my life...

106
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:47,065
...if I don't meet up with that comet.

107
00:08:49,242 --> 00:08:52,541
-Have a look back here.
-The man's plumb crazy.

108
00:08:52,713 --> 00:08:56,615
-I wanna show you something.
-Well, I'm not. You stick with me.

109
00:08:57,784 --> 00:09:00,082
See here.
Now, we cross the Atlantic...

110
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:01,811
...catch this trade wind...

111
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:05,447
...to where the comet's parabola
comes close to the Earth.

112
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,092
Or close enough.

113
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:11,453
How come a writer knows so much
about piloting and navigating?

114
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:16,591
Because long before I was a writer,
I was a Mississippi riverboat pilot.

115
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:22,230
Say, that's an uncommon fine frog.

116
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:23,467
Well, that's Homer.

117
00:09:23,643 --> 00:09:28,740
You know, it was a frog like Homer
that put me in the writing business.

118
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:35,886
I wrote a story about The Celebrated
Jumping Frog of Calaveras County.

119
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:37,683
That's right here.

120
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:40,292
Home of Jim Smiley and
his famous frog, Dan'l Webster.

121
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:43,260
Famous frog?

122
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,661
Will you tell me what in tarnation
a frog could do to get hisself famous?

123
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:47,822
Oh, Tom.

124
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:51,459
I've been trying everything I know,
and I ain't even a little bit famous yet.

125
00:09:51,638 --> 00:09:53,629
Well, I'll tell you all about him.

126
00:09:53,807 --> 00:09:56,173
Just as it was told to me.

127
00:09:58,712 --> 00:10:00,805
What a fellow, that Jim Smiley.

128
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:04,473
Always betting on anything
that turned up.

129
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:09,088
Only thing is,
he made sure he won every bet.

130
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:14,355
He catched a frog one day
and took him home...

131
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:17,588
...and said he'd calculate
to educate him.

132
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:21,092
All a frog wants is educating...

133
00:10:21,268 --> 00:10:24,635
...and he can do most anything.

134
00:10:25,372 --> 00:10:27,567
And so he never done nothing
for three months...

135
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:30,767
...but sat in his back yard
and learned that frog to jump.

136
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:32,673
And you bet he did learn him too.

137
00:10:32,846 --> 00:10:38,284
All right, Dan'l, let's 
just see how far you can go.

138
00:10:43,557 --> 00:10:48,221
Come on back now.
One for accuracy.

139
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:58,962
Smiley knew a sucker
when he saw one.

140
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:06,776
What might that be
you got in the barrel?

141
00:11:06,947 --> 00:11:08,881
Well, it might be a parrot.

142
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:11,176
Might be a canary, maybe.

143
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:13,046
But it ain't.

144
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:16,419
It's only just a frog.

145
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:21,451
So it is.

146
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:23,895
What's he good for?

147
00:11:24,064 --> 00:11:27,033
Well, he's good enough
for one thing I should judge.

148
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,193
He can out-jump any frog
in Calaveras County.

149
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:38,609
Well, I don't see no points
about that frog...

150
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:41,406
...that's any better
than any other frog.

151
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:45,779
Maybe you just don't
understand frogs.

152
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:48,614
Anyway, I got my opinion...

153
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:50,779
...and I'll just rest 40 dollars...

154
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:55,792
...that he can out-jump 
any frog in Calaveras County.

155
00:11:56,463 --> 00:12:00,297
Well, I'm only a stranger here.

156
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:03,494
I ain't got no frog.

157
00:12:04,204 --> 00:12:06,536
But if I had a frog, I'd bet you.

158
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:11,040
That's all right.
I'll go get you a frog.

159
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:18,744
You hungry, frog?

160
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,282
Smiley went to the swamp...

161
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:30,828
...and slopped around 
in the mud for a long time.

162
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:40,899
Finally, he fetched a frog...

163
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:43,201
...and fetched him in
to give him to this fellow.

164
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:46,072
Eurekee!

165
00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:51,310
-Here he comes.
-There's your frog.

166
00:12:51,484 --> 00:12:54,044
The likes of that....

167
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,685
Putting my money on Smiley's frog.

168
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,260
-Me too.
-Count me in.

169
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:07,832
Now then, if you're ready,
set him alongside of Dan'l...

170
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:10,265
...with his forepaws even
with Dan'l's...

171
00:13:10,437 --> 00:13:12,200
...and I'll give the word.

172
00:13:13,373 --> 00:13:15,671
On your marks, get set...

173
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:16,934
...get!

174
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,978
Come on, jump.
Get in there, boy, would you?

175
00:13:21,147 --> 00:13:24,947
What's the matter with you?
Will you start jumping?

176
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:29,950
I said, get.

177
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:38,893
Get off that starting line.
Get going.

178
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:43,802
-Get off of that--
-Jump there. Come on now.

179
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:57,475
-Oh, no.
-Will you just jump?

180
00:13:57,651 --> 00:14:00,848
Jump. Jump, frog. Get going.

181
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:09,217
-We won, frog.
-What do you mean, you won?

182
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:13,492
Dag blame it, Smiley.
That was the last 40 dollars I had.

183
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:22,336
Well, as I said before...

184
00:14:22,642 --> 00:14:27,602
...I don't see no points about that frog
that's any better than any other frog.

185
00:14:27,781 --> 00:14:29,112
I do wonder...

186
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:33,218
...why in tarnation
that there frog just give up.

187
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:35,946
Wonder if there ain't something
the matter with him.

188
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:39,819
Appears to look 
mighty baggy somehow.

189
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:43,891
Why, blame my cats...

190
00:14:44,064 --> 00:14:47,056
...if he don't weigh 50 pounds!

191
00:14:49,102 --> 00:14:51,593
I've been hornswoggled!

192
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:53,739
He was the maddest man.

193
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:58,105
He took out after that fella,
but he never catched him.

194
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:06,147
Shucks, I could write a better
story than that one.

195
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:07,308
Tom!

196
00:15:07,487 --> 00:15:10,115
That's what I said myself
when I heard it.

197
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,088
It was a big success all the same.

198
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:15,386
I became a writer.

199
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:18,292
I haven't worked a day since.

200
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:23,964
-Now, that's a job I'd like to get.
-If you get out of here alive.

201
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,271
There she is.

202
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:41,014
How come you wanna catch
that comet so bad, Mr. Twain?

203
00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:46,687
The comet and I are a part 
of the plan, angelfish.

204
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,953
No doubt the Almighty 
has said here:

205
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:51,689
"Here goes those
two unaccountable freaks.

206
00:15:51,865 --> 00:15:57,132
They came in together,
they must go out together."

207
00:15:58,538 --> 00:16:03,237
Here, set your eyes
on this celestial schooner.

208
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:10,914
Now ain't that
a heartwarming spectacle.

209
00:16:11,084 --> 00:16:12,813
It's beauti--

210
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:18,680
Well, Tom and Huck and I,
well, see, we're not so sure--

211
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:22,794
That I know what I'm doing up here?

212
00:16:23,463 --> 00:16:27,058
Angelfish,
It's just like piloting a river.

213
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:29,565
You get to know the shape of it.

214
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:34,136
Like following a hall
at home in the dark.

215
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:39,142
And even if you feel some fear,
you know no harm can come to you...

216
00:16:39,312 --> 00:16:42,611
...because you've traveled
that hallway a hundred times...

217
00:16:42,782 --> 00:16:46,775
...in nothing but bare feet and faith.

218
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:01,760
What are we gonna do?

219
00:17:01,935 --> 00:17:03,232
You know your ownself...

220
00:17:03,403 --> 00:17:06,236
...we gotta find a way off
of this here balloon, Tom Sawyer.

221
00:17:06,406 --> 00:17:08,499
Adventure or no.

222
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:13,112
Okay now, Homer, over here.
Now over there.

223
00:17:13,513 --> 00:17:15,140
Well?

224
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:19,612
I got a plan
just starting to brew.

225
00:17:19,786 --> 00:17:21,117
Well, what is it?

226
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:24,723
First, we gotta get Becky off.
She talks too much.

227
00:17:24,891 --> 00:17:26,381
Can't keep a secret.

228
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,958
So me and Huck was thinking...

229
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:30,561
...we should set her down
and let Becky off.

230
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,789
Things are liable to get pretty rough.

231
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:36,595
There is nothing comparable
to the endurance of a woman.

232
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:38,327
But this is different, Mr. Twain.

233
00:17:38,505 --> 00:17:40,370
We're aeronorts,
and girls don't belong--

234
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,940
That's "aeronauts."

235
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:49,679
She would have to horn in
on this expedition.

236
00:17:53,253 --> 00:17:55,244
-To the main deck.
-There's that thing again.

237
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:57,912
Come on, let's go investigating.

238
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:03,560
-Tom, where you going?
-This thing's really amazing.

239
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,198
Gives me the creeps.

240
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:09,463
"Table of Contents."

241
00:18:10,803 --> 00:18:13,135
Welcome to the works of Mark Twain.
This is the Indexovator.

242
00:18:13,306 --> 00:18:16,332
Choose your story and 
proceed to the correct door.

243
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:18,670
Let's have a look around.

244
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:23,313
Okay, now, I gotta know about this
secret plan if we're gonna be partners.

245
00:18:23,483 --> 00:18:24,507
Okay.

246
00:18:24,684 --> 00:18:26,276
We're gonna watch and learn...

247
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:28,920
...just the most we can
about flying this here balloon--

248
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:32,080
-Welcome to Injun Joe.
-Look!

249
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:35,918
That was close. I don't ever
wanna meet that guy again.

250
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:38,188
He was scary.

251
00:18:38,364 --> 00:18:40,491
Well, what then?

252
00:18:41,234 --> 00:18:42,326
What you said.

253
00:18:42,502 --> 00:18:46,165
After we learn the most we can
about this here balloon...?

254
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:48,136
Welcome to
the library-billiard room.

255
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:50,499
Have you ever seen
a place like this, Huck?

256
00:18:50,677 --> 00:18:53,168
Tom, where you going?

257
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,975
Listen here, Tom. I want--

258
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:03,683
-Look at all this. What a contraption.
-Tom, I gotta know about the plan.

259
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:06,791
Guess those must be the classics
everybody's always talking about.

260
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,222
What's a classic?

261
00:19:08,394 --> 00:19:10,191
Something everybody wants
to have read...

262
00:19:10,363 --> 00:19:13,093
...but nobody wants to read.

263
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,158
-Library-billiard room.
-Oh, here you are.

264
00:19:16,336 --> 00:19:20,397
-Doggone it.
-What you guys doing?

265
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,835
-Oh, what does this thing do?
-Go ahead, give it a try.

266
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:28,469
That's my monument
to Adam and Eve.

267
00:19:28,648 --> 00:19:30,809
There she goes again.

268
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,348
Thanks.

269
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:39,857
-They're naked.
-So are we all the day we're born.

270
00:19:40,026 --> 00:19:42,722
But we learn to be modest.

271
00:19:43,663 --> 00:19:44,960
Not all over.

272
00:19:45,131 --> 00:19:47,429
Just in places.

273
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:54,671
But it's just as well,
I suppose.

274
00:19:54,841 --> 00:20:00,609
Naked people have little
or no influence in society.

275
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:05,609
The way I heard it, that Eve
caused nothing but trouble.

276
00:20:05,785 --> 00:20:09,721
Well, I heard that each found
the other a considerable nuisance...

277
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:11,880
...in the beginning.

278
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:14,618
Perhaps you would be
interested in my research.

279
00:20:14,794 --> 00:20:17,319
-Yes, sir, I surely would.
-And so would I.

280
00:20:17,497 --> 00:20:20,591
Well, have a look here.

281
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:23,401
The Diary of Adam and Eve.

282
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:28,666
It all started with the world's
first birthday party.

283
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:52,764
Oh, this is nice.

284
00:20:59,238 --> 00:21:00,466
What am I doing?

285
00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:03,139
There, okay.

286
00:21:06,345 --> 00:21:07,539
This is good.

287
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:16,712
This is cute.

288
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:35,005
Oh, what a surprise.
He's gonna love this place.

289
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:38,536
Adam.

290
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:41,179
This is for you.

291
00:21:48,855 --> 00:21:52,655
-Adam.
-Oh, yeah.

292
00:21:54,961 --> 00:21:56,861
Adam.

293
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:01,332
Adam.

294
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:04,061
-What?
-It's for you.

295
00:22:04,237 --> 00:22:07,673
-Hello?
-Oh, no.

296
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:01,386
Here we go.

297
00:23:36,362 --> 00:23:39,525
This was truly paradise.

298
00:23:39,699 --> 00:23:42,896
And Adam figured
to keep track of it all.

299
00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:44,536
But as it turned out...

300
00:23:44,704 --> 00:23:49,471
...someone else was
keeping track of paradise as well.

301
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:10,217
Saturday.

302
00:24:11,564 --> 00:24:12,758
I think it is a man.

303
00:24:12,932 --> 00:24:16,891
I had never seen one,
but it looked like one.

304
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:25,643
I feel more curiosity about it
than about any of the other reptiles.

305
00:24:25,811 --> 00:24:30,271
It has frowzy hair, no hips,
and tapers like a carrot...

306
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:32,781
...so I think it is a reptile...

307
00:24:32,952 --> 00:24:36,410
... though it may be architecture.

308
00:24:37,924 --> 00:24:42,691
I was afraid of it at first,
for I thought it was going to chase me.

309
00:24:49,402 --> 00:24:52,098
But it was only trying to get away.

310
00:24:52,772 --> 00:24:57,072
I waited a good while,
then gave it up and went home.

311
00:24:58,644 --> 00:25:00,509
Sunday.

312
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,174
Today, the same thing.
I've got it up a tree again.

313
00:25:07,253 --> 00:25:09,721
It is resting, I suppose.

314
00:25:09,889 --> 00:25:13,552
It looks to me like the creature
is more interested in resting...

315
00:25:13,726 --> 00:25:16,217
... than anything else.

316
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:21,555
Oh, no.

317
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:35,610
It was trying to catch the speckled
fishes that play in the pool...

318
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:37,510
...and I had to clod it...

319
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:42,086
... to try to make it go up
the tree again and let them alone.

320
00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:45,720
This new creature
is a good deal in the way.

321
00:25:46,325 --> 00:25:50,591
I wish it would hang out with the
other animals and leave me alone.

322
00:25:57,803 --> 00:26:00,533
The new creature eats
too much fruit.

323
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:05,370
This morning found it trying to shake
apples out of that forbidden tree.

324
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:06,943
Wanting to make friends...

325
00:26:07,313 --> 00:26:10,146
...I tried to get him
some of those apples.

326
00:26:10,316 --> 00:26:11,977
I failed...

327
00:26:12,151 --> 00:26:15,518
...but I think 
the good intention pleased him.

328
00:26:16,522 --> 00:26:18,183
Where's my--?

329
00:26:20,026 --> 00:26:22,017
Ladder.

330
00:26:26,298 --> 00:26:27,890
During the last day or two...

331
00:26:28,067 --> 00:26:31,195
...I have taken the work
of naming things off his hands.

332
00:26:35,174 --> 00:26:37,802
He is evidently very grateful.

333
00:26:37,977 --> 00:26:42,107
The new creature says,
"It looks like grass."

334
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:44,272
That is not a reason.

335
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,045
It is imbecility and high-handed,
it seems to me.

336
00:26:53,526 --> 00:26:56,393
Everything's named before
I can lodge a protest.

337
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:00,631
I get no chance
to name anything myself.

338
00:27:02,802 --> 00:27:05,168
He has no gift at that line.

339
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:09,535
I do not let him see
that I'm aware of his defect.

340
00:27:13,913 --> 00:27:18,873
The naming goes recklessly on
in spite of anything I can do.

341
00:27:22,188 --> 00:27:26,090
My life is not as happy as it was.

342
00:27:28,928 --> 00:27:29,917
Sunday.

343
00:27:32,498 --> 00:27:34,489
The new creature says
its name is "Eve."

344
00:27:35,835 --> 00:27:37,166
Well, that's all right.

345
00:27:37,336 --> 00:27:39,201
I have no objections.

346
00:27:39,371 --> 00:27:43,034
Says it's to call it Eve
when I want it to come.

347
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:45,707
In that case, I said it was....

348
00:27:45,878 --> 00:27:48,346
Superfluous.

349
00:27:49,115 --> 00:27:53,347
This morning, he used
a surprisingly good word.

350
00:27:54,687 --> 00:27:58,521
Yes, it is a large, good word
and will bear repetition.

351
00:27:58,691 --> 00:28:01,592
Superfluous.

352
00:28:01,827 --> 00:28:04,557
Superfluous.

353
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,925
Where did he get that word?

354
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:09,124
I don't think I've ever used it.

355
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:11,826
Superfluous.
Yes, yes, I like that one.

356
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:14,862
Friday.

357
00:28:20,346 --> 00:28:22,541
Adam! Oh, no, no, don't!

358
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,147
She took to beseeching him
to stop going over the falls...

359
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,721
...but they had no other use
that he could see.

360
00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:37,295
I went over the falls in a barrel.

361
00:28:37,463 --> 00:28:39,397
Not satisfactory to her.

362
00:28:39,565 --> 00:28:41,931
Went over in a tub.

363
00:28:44,537 --> 00:28:46,562
Still not satisfactory.

364
00:28:46,739 --> 00:28:49,037
Adam, please!

365
00:28:58,117 --> 00:29:01,712
What I need is a change of scene.

366
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:09,793
I escaped last night.

367
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:29,543
But she hunted me out.

368
00:29:33,052 --> 00:29:35,077
We'll immigrate again...

369
00:29:35,254 --> 00:29:37,586
...when the occasion offers.

370
00:29:38,757 --> 00:29:39,746
Sunday.

371
00:29:54,306 --> 00:29:56,399
Why, I--

372
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:05,081
For Adam, Sunday was getting
to be more and more trying.

373
00:30:05,251 --> 00:30:07,811
It was selected and set apart...

374
00:30:07,987 --> 00:30:10,922
...as the day of rest.

375
00:30:13,726 --> 00:30:18,789
I go to the water when 
I need someone to talk to.

376
00:30:19,832 --> 00:30:22,630
It is a good friend to me...

377
00:30:23,969 --> 00:30:26,767
...and my only one.

378
00:30:27,506 --> 00:30:30,339
It talks when I talk.

379
00:30:30,643 --> 00:30:33,771
It is sad when I am sad.

380
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:38,076
And it comforts me with sympathy.

381
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:45,822
She nearly strangled
and said it was most uncomfortable.

382
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:50,319
This made her sorry for the creatures
that live there, which she calls...

383
00:30:50,896 --> 00:30:53,091
-..."fosh."
-Fish.

384
00:30:53,265 --> 00:30:57,065
I don't see that they are
any happier than they were before.

385
00:30:57,236 --> 00:30:59,227
Only quieter.

386
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:05,772
He is avoiding me...

387
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:09,778
...and seems to wish
I would not talk to him.

388
00:31:09,948 --> 00:31:13,315
So I made friends with the animals.

389
00:31:21,327 --> 00:31:23,557
She thinks that things aren't right.

390
00:31:23,729 --> 00:31:25,959
The buzzard, for instance.

391
00:31:26,131 --> 00:31:30,067
She thinks it was intended
to live on decayed flesh.

392
00:31:32,137 --> 00:31:36,130
But we cannot overturn the whole
scheme to accommodate the buzzard.

393
00:31:39,211 --> 00:31:41,111
They both should fall...

394
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,748
...or they both should fly.

395
00:31:46,185 --> 00:31:48,346
I don't know which.

396
00:31:52,624 --> 00:31:54,489
One of these is a fake.

397
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,356
Congratulations, my dear.

398
00:31:57,529 --> 00:32:02,398
You have discovered
the law of gravity.

399
00:32:02,568 --> 00:32:05,128
Why so I have.

400
00:32:05,304 --> 00:32:09,104
I always say it's best to prove things
by actual experiment...

401
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:12,471
...or you'll never get educated.
Don't you agree?

402
00:32:12,644 --> 00:32:18,276
Oh, I do indeed.
Knowledge is not easily come by.

403
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,613
But there is a fine
adult-education course nearby...

404
00:32:21,787 --> 00:32:24,915
...if you're interested
in that sort of thing.

405
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,523
Really?

406
00:32:27,393 --> 00:32:30,658
She has taken up with a snake,
and I'm glad...

407
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:35,596
...because the snake talks,
and this enables me to get some rest.

408
00:32:35,768 --> 00:32:39,704
But he advised her
to keep away from that tree.

409
00:32:39,872 --> 00:32:43,535
He told her it would bring
death into the world.

410
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:45,301
But that's wonderful, Adam.

411
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:47,342
You'll have fresh meat
for the buzzards...

412
00:32:47,513 --> 00:32:51,313
...and the lions and tigers can quit
eating that ridiculous grass.

413
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:53,348
Have you ever looked
at their teeth, Adam?

414
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,884
They aren't herbivores.

415
00:32:55,053 --> 00:32:57,487
-I foresee trouble.
-If they were meant to eat grass...

416
00:32:57,656 --> 00:32:59,715
-We'll immigrate.
-...they'd have had cuds.

417
00:32:59,892 --> 00:33:04,124
He escaped, and rode all night
as fast as he could go...

418
00:33:05,764 --> 00:33:09,860
...hoping to get clear of the garden
and hide in some other country...

419
00:33:10,035 --> 00:33:13,698
...before the trouble
over that apple should begin.

420
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:16,534
I've got it. Come on.

421
00:33:42,835 --> 00:33:43,995
That does it.

422
00:33:48,407 --> 00:33:49,874
Too bad.

423
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:11,719
-Hellfire, hurricanes.
-Holy cow, what was that?

424
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:17,201
Bully, a lightning storm.

425
00:34:25,077 --> 00:34:26,704
All hands on deck.
Quickly now.

426
00:34:32,017 --> 00:34:34,850
-It's a blind night out.
-What a storm.

427
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,854
-Homer. Homer, come back.
-All hands, lay to.

428
00:34:39,024 --> 00:34:40,355
-Look out.
-We're gonna crash.

429
00:34:40,526 --> 00:34:42,221
Like hell we are.

430
00:34:44,463 --> 00:34:46,954
Get to your battle stations,
you landlubbers.

431
00:34:47,132 --> 00:34:50,124
-Huck, fasten that boom.
-Great Scott.

432
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:53,794
Becky, lower the pressure valve.

433
00:34:53,972 --> 00:34:55,735
Gotta find the mark.

434
00:34:55,908 --> 00:34:57,432
Tom!

435
00:34:58,911 --> 00:35:01,004
Fetch the sounding gun.

436
00:35:07,386 --> 00:35:10,878
Sound out.

437
00:35:11,056 --> 00:35:13,650
-Hey, look.
-Sound out.

438
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:16,283
I'm seeing things, Homer.

439
00:35:16,461 --> 00:35:19,430
The trigger. Pull the trigger!

440
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:24,565
Mark 15. I think.

441
00:35:24,736 --> 00:35:27,398
Fifteen? Can't be.

442
00:35:28,073 --> 00:35:29,836
Huck, look!

443
00:35:30,008 --> 00:35:31,407
What?

444
00:35:31,577 --> 00:35:35,377
-I thought I saw someone.
-Me too.

445
00:35:35,547 --> 00:35:37,310
We've hit a bar.

446
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:41,581
We're coming about.
Pull in the stabilizer.

447
00:35:46,925 --> 00:35:49,086
-Frog overboard.
-What should I do, Mr. Twain?

448
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:51,126
-Becky, take the wheel.
-Okay.

449
00:35:51,296 --> 00:35:52,820
-Steady as you go.
-Okay.

450
00:35:52,998 --> 00:35:55,865
-What's happening down there?
-Hang on there, little fella.

451
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:58,229
-I can't see. What's happening?
-Oh, no.

452
00:35:58,403 --> 00:35:59,495
Homer!

453
00:36:05,577 --> 00:36:07,442
I can't look.

454
00:36:07,613 --> 00:36:09,342
Hang on, Homer.

455
00:36:11,016 --> 00:36:12,540
Hang on.

456
00:36:13,385 --> 00:36:16,821
-He's got him.
-He got him!

457
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,679
Homer.

458
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:22,554
-Who's the leadsman?
-I am, sir.

459
00:36:23,662 --> 00:36:25,755
Devil reef ahead.

460
00:36:25,931 --> 00:36:30,891
Becky, hard astarboard.
Spin her. Spin her.

461
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:32,764
Spin her!

462
00:36:32,938 --> 00:36:38,706
-We're heading for the rocks.
-Helm alee. Port your helm.

463
00:36:40,412 --> 00:36:42,903
-No, not that way.
-To the starboard.

464
00:36:43,415 --> 00:36:45,110
Turn, Becky.

465
00:36:45,283 --> 00:36:47,547
-Mr. Twain?
-Starboard!

466
00:36:47,953 --> 00:36:50,615
The other way.
The other way!

467
00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:53,485
What? Oh, no.

468
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,358
-Oh, no.
-Back her, quick.

469
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,465
By God, back the immortal soul
out of her.

470
00:37:05,504 --> 00:37:08,598
The rocks! The rocks!

471
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:10,836
Oh, no!

472
00:37:13,145 --> 00:37:14,772
Ahead one half!

473
00:37:15,747 --> 00:37:17,112
Mr. Twain!

474
00:37:22,421 --> 00:37:24,252
Now we need altitude.

475
00:37:26,258 --> 00:37:28,590
Up ship.

476
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,387
We'll drop ballast.

477
00:37:30,562 --> 00:37:31,859
Now!

478
00:37:39,471 --> 00:37:41,132
Ahead full.

479
00:37:49,748 --> 00:37:51,648
Here, I'll take her now.

480
00:38:16,374 --> 00:38:19,309
We've lost valuable time.

481
00:38:19,478 --> 00:38:23,642
As deck hands,
you've got a lot to learn.

482
00:38:27,052 --> 00:38:30,510
Of course, training is everything.

483
00:38:30,689 --> 00:38:35,854
I mean, a cauliflower is just
a cabbage with a college education.

484
00:38:36,528 --> 00:38:39,929
I'll show you the ropes later on.
You go down and get warm.

485
00:38:40,098 --> 00:38:41,895
Let's go.

486
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:45,298
You cabbages.

487
00:38:47,372 --> 00:38:50,000
Welcome to the hurricane deck.

488
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:02,347
I don't think we're ever
gonna get back home.

489
00:39:02,854 --> 00:39:04,014
Oh, yes, we are.

490
00:39:04,189 --> 00:39:06,885
Tom has got a plan.
Don't you, Tom?

491
00:39:07,058 --> 00:39:08,457
What?

492
00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:12,022
-What in the...?
-Tom!

493
00:39:12,564 --> 00:39:13,553
Aunt Polly?

494
00:39:13,732 --> 00:39:16,064
Welcome to
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

495
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:18,759
Well, I lay, if I get a....

496
00:39:19,271 --> 00:39:22,798
-You, Tom, now you get going.
-But, Aunt Polly, I'm an aeronort.

497
00:39:23,008 --> 00:39:25,499
-I'm on a balloon with Huck.
-Aunt Polly?

498
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:29,238
-What's going on?
-Where'd he go?

499
00:39:30,115 --> 00:39:31,514
We're home.

500
00:39:32,851 --> 00:39:34,614
Oh, Huck, open the door.
Hurry up.

501
00:39:35,487 --> 00:39:36,852
Tom!

502
00:39:37,022 --> 00:39:38,182
That was close.

503
00:39:38,356 --> 00:39:41,189
She was gonna make me
whitewash that old fence again.

504
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,125
Tom Sawyer, you chowderhead.
Open that door.

505
00:39:45,297 --> 00:39:46,457
If you want off so bad....

506
00:39:46,965 --> 00:39:49,525
-Oh, no.
-Where did it go?

507
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:54,661
Close enough to home
to bark our shins, and now it's gone.

508
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,137
Look, somebody's coming.

509
00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:00,742
Oh, Mr. Twain.

510
00:40:00,912 --> 00:40:02,880
What's the matter?

511
00:40:04,382 --> 00:40:06,680
Welcome to
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

512
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:08,479
Am I already famous?

513
00:40:08,653 --> 00:40:11,850
Don't you care about nothing else,
you lummox?

514
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:13,786
Fame is a vapor.

515
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:18,692
The only earthly certainty
is oblivion.

516
00:40:18,864 --> 00:40:20,661
Welcome to
The Mysterious Stranger.

517
00:40:20,832 --> 00:40:22,595
What?

518
00:40:24,669 --> 00:40:25,931
Hello.

519
00:40:26,104 --> 00:40:27,196
Who are you?

520
00:40:29,341 --> 00:40:31,468
An angel.

521
00:40:33,511 --> 00:40:36,241
-What's your name?
-Satan.

522
00:40:38,216 --> 00:40:41,413
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

523
00:40:41,586 --> 00:40:44,111
Only it's sure a sorry name
for an angel.

524
00:40:46,992 --> 00:40:49,927
-Please, come in.
-A magician.

525
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,122
Come on.

526
00:41:00,605 --> 00:41:03,540
Amazing. It's like an island.

527
00:41:12,384 --> 00:41:15,046
-Did you see that?
-Mercy's sake.

528
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,881
How did you learn to do that?

529
00:41:18,356 --> 00:41:20,586
I didn't learn it at all.

530
00:41:20,759 --> 00:41:23,057
It comes naturally to me...

531
00:41:23,228 --> 00:41:26,686
...like other curious things.

532
00:41:26,865 --> 00:41:28,958
-Are you hungry?
-Sure am.

533
00:41:30,602 --> 00:41:34,163
What kind of fruit
do you like the most?

534
00:41:34,339 --> 00:41:35,636
-Oranges.
-Apples.

535
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:37,240
Grapes.

536
00:41:47,419 --> 00:41:49,216
-Where'd he go?
-What happened to him?

537
00:41:49,387 --> 00:41:51,082
There.

538
00:41:54,893 --> 00:41:57,088
-Oh, boy.
-Can we help?

539
00:41:57,629 --> 00:42:01,030
You may make some people.

540
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,564
I'll make the king and queen.

541
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:08,772
I'm a make a soldier.

542
00:42:13,945 --> 00:42:16,413
Look at that little village.

543
00:42:19,617 --> 00:42:21,278
There. Here's a buddy.

544
00:42:21,453 --> 00:42:24,183
Now we'll give them life.

545
00:42:24,489 --> 00:42:25,751
They're moving.

546
00:42:25,924 --> 00:42:27,824
Looks like my pap
on Saturday night.

547
00:42:29,928 --> 00:42:31,589
Look. They're moving.

548
00:42:31,763 --> 00:42:33,424
They're just like regular people.

549
00:43:00,191 --> 00:43:05,458
I find you humans quite interesting.

550
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:10,761
Even though you are 
a worthless, greedy lot.

551
00:43:13,104 --> 00:43:17,473
How annoying that sound is.

552
00:43:28,887 --> 00:43:30,479
Fools.

553
00:43:30,655 --> 00:43:34,751
What fascinations there are
on this planet.

554
00:43:34,926 --> 00:43:41,297
Strange mortals
with curious customs.

555
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,965
We'll have a storm now...

556
00:43:44,135 --> 00:43:46,797
...and an earthquake, if you like.

557
00:43:46,971 --> 00:43:51,340
You must stand aside,
out of danger.

558
00:44:30,248 --> 00:44:33,342
I can do no wrong...

559
00:44:33,618 --> 00:44:37,987
...for I do not know what it is.

560
00:44:38,156 --> 00:44:40,351
You murdered them.

561
00:44:40,758 --> 00:44:43,124
Never mind them.

562
00:44:43,294 --> 00:44:45,888
People are of no value.

563
00:44:46,064 --> 00:44:49,329
We could make more sometime...

564
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:52,061
...if we need them.

565
00:44:57,876 --> 00:45:01,744
Life itself is only a vision...

566
00:45:01,913 --> 00:45:03,778
...a dream.

567
00:45:03,948 --> 00:45:09,318
Nothing exists
save empty space and you.

568
00:45:09,487 --> 00:45:14,254
And you are but a thought.

569
00:45:24,936 --> 00:45:26,301
I wanna go home.

570
00:45:27,505 --> 00:45:29,996
-Welcome to Injun Joe.
-Reckon I'm getting out of here.

571
00:45:30,175 --> 00:45:33,144
No, Huck.
Not that way, Huck.

572
00:45:34,145 --> 00:45:37,945
-Mr. Twain, close the door!
-Mr. Twain, close the door!

573
00:45:41,953 --> 00:45:43,818
Remember your old friend,
Injun Joe?

574
00:45:51,296 --> 00:45:53,264
Mr. Twain, why did you do this?

575
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:56,298
I realized that
from the cradle up...

576
00:45:56,467 --> 00:46:00,198
...I have been like
the rest of the race...

577
00:46:00,538 --> 00:46:03,564
...never quite sane at night.

578
00:46:07,378 --> 00:46:09,312
But, Mr. Twain....

579
00:46:10,014 --> 00:46:11,447
Welcome To
The Damned Human Race.

580
00:46:12,884 --> 00:46:15,011
That does it.

581
00:46:20,124 --> 00:46:22,319
We're only waiting
for the right moment now.

582
00:46:22,493 --> 00:46:25,519
-Right moment for what?
-Yeah.

583
00:46:26,431 --> 00:46:29,332
Becky, do you swear not to tell?

584
00:46:30,468 --> 00:46:34,802
-Sure.
-On your grandmother's bones?

585
00:46:35,773 --> 00:46:38,742
-Well, do you?
-Yeah.

586
00:46:40,945 --> 00:46:43,573
We're gonna hijack this balloon.

587
00:46:43,982 --> 00:46:45,916
-What?
-Hijack?

588
00:46:46,084 --> 00:46:49,485
Can't you see it?
"Tom Sawyer, Aeronort...

589
00:46:49,654 --> 00:46:54,523
...Saves Airborne Friends from
Madman's Death Wish."

590
00:48:33,958 --> 00:48:35,357
When, Tom?

591
00:48:39,464 --> 00:48:41,193
Tomorrow.

592
00:49:12,797 --> 00:49:15,664
Okay, so you line that up
with the sun.

593
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:17,926
-Right?
-Yeah.

594
00:49:21,305 --> 00:49:23,170
Mr. Twain?

595
00:49:23,608 --> 00:49:25,371
What's this?

596
00:49:25,543 --> 00:49:29,070
Now you be careful there.
That's the central power panel.

597
00:49:32,717 --> 00:49:34,947
London. Right on schedule.

598
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,677
Good thing too.

599
00:49:36,854 --> 00:49:40,119
That comet won't be 
around again until I'm 150.

600
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:43,658
By that time,
I may have changed my mind.

601
00:49:46,497 --> 00:49:49,057
All right, scouts,
what did you uncover?

602
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:51,758
Well, the steering looks pretty easy.

603
00:49:51,936 --> 00:49:54,200
I found the power thrusters,
but I don't know--

604
00:49:54,372 --> 00:49:57,864
Well, I've found a way
to stop this ship cold.

605
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:03,906
-What's that?
-Welcome to Mark Twain's Notebook.

606
00:50:06,184 --> 00:50:07,776
I reckon it's Mr. Twain.

607
00:50:07,952 --> 00:50:13,219
I am the only man living
who understands human nature.

608
00:50:13,391 --> 00:50:15,985
God has put me in charge
of this branch office...

609
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,994
...and when I retire, there will be
no one to take my place.

610
00:50:21,566 --> 00:50:25,468
I shall keep on doing my duty...

611
00:50:25,636 --> 00:50:28,104
...for when I get over
on the other side...

612
00:50:28,272 --> 00:50:34,142
...I wanna use my influence to have
the human race drowned again.

613
00:50:34,312 --> 00:50:36,303
This time drowned good.

614
00:50:36,481 --> 00:50:40,417
No omissions. No ark.

615
00:50:49,026 --> 00:50:53,395
Sometimes the old man
seems powerful unhappy.

616
00:50:53,564 --> 00:50:56,294
I think he's lonely.

617
00:50:57,168 --> 00:50:58,897
I think he's asleep.

618
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:00,833
Thunderation, we struck it lucky.

619
00:51:01,005 --> 00:51:03,496
-This is our chance.
-What?

620
00:51:04,242 --> 00:51:06,301
We're gonna sashay on over there...

621
00:51:06,477 --> 00:51:09,412
...hog-tie Mr. Twain,
and hijack this here ship.

622
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:12,105
-I don't think--
-Don't be a couple of sissies...

623
00:51:12,283 --> 00:51:15,218
...in the face of a real adventure.

624
00:51:21,626 --> 00:51:24,151
Tom, is this necessary?

625
00:51:25,429 --> 00:51:27,954
There. That ought to hold him.

626
00:51:28,132 --> 00:51:30,965
Hey, don't set those keys there.

627
00:51:31,369 --> 00:51:34,896
The key always has to be
just out of the prisoner's reach...

628
00:51:35,072 --> 00:51:36,664
...so he can plan his escape.

629
00:51:36,841 --> 00:51:39,435
Confound it, that's foolish, Tom.

630
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:41,305
To the helm, aeronorts.

631
00:51:41,479 --> 00:51:44,915
-That's "aeronauts."
-Come on.

632
00:51:46,317 --> 00:51:48,808
Welcome to the hurricane deck.

633
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:52,512
-Look.
-We had you all tied up.

634
00:51:52,823 --> 00:51:57,556
No, no, no. That was just 
a little writer's block.

635
00:51:57,728 --> 00:52:00,788
I never saw such a escape artist.

636
00:52:00,965 --> 00:52:06,369
You look about as disappointed
as Presbyterians in hell.

637
00:52:06,537 --> 00:52:09,438
We'll never get home.

638
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:16,439
They're thinking we're gonna die
when we meet up with that comet.

639
00:52:24,322 --> 00:52:26,552
Suppose we do die...

640
00:52:29,327 --> 00:52:31,921
...is there truly a heaven or a hell?

641
00:52:33,097 --> 00:52:36,533
Oh, I don't know.
I don't want to express an opinion.

642
00:52:36,701 --> 00:52:40,501
You see, I'd have friends
in both places.

643
00:52:42,607 --> 00:52:46,771
Now, consider
Old Captain Stormfield.

644
00:52:48,212 --> 00:52:50,908
Come on over here, Tom.
I've got something to show you.

645
00:52:59,256 --> 00:53:00,245
Look at that.

646
00:53:00,424 --> 00:53:05,384
-Stormfield, is that you?
-Why, ahoy there, Mark Twain.

647
00:53:05,563 --> 00:53:07,758
Where might you be going?

648
00:53:07,932 --> 00:53:12,699
I might-- No, I most assuredly am
going to heaven.

649
00:53:13,104 --> 00:53:15,004
An optimist.

650
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,404
Racing his own comet too.

651
00:53:18,576 --> 00:53:20,544
Stormfield is a man with faith.

652
00:53:20,711 --> 00:53:25,273
Means he's willing to believe
in what he knows ain't so.

653
00:53:30,221 --> 00:53:32,086
What was that?

654
00:53:34,325 --> 00:53:36,725
Oh, my.

655
00:53:37,028 --> 00:53:40,589
Well, quick, where are you from?

656
00:53:45,703 --> 00:53:48,001
San Francisco.

657
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:53,340
-Is it a planet?
-Planet? Why, it's a city.

658
00:53:53,511 --> 00:53:55,843
And moreover, it's one
of the biggest and the finest.

659
00:53:56,013 --> 00:54:01,280
Well, that's delightful,
but we don't deal in cities here.

660
00:54:01,452 --> 00:54:05,616
Where are you from in
a more general way?

661
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:08,054
I beg your pardon?

662
00:54:09,393 --> 00:54:12,624
Put me down for California.

663
00:54:13,831 --> 00:54:15,856
Is it a constellation?

664
00:54:16,534 --> 00:54:19,094
Oh, my goodness, no. It's a state.

665
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:25,004
I'm from America,
the United States of America.

666
00:54:25,743 --> 00:54:28,211
-There ain't any such orb.
-Orb?

667
00:54:28,379 --> 00:54:30,847
What are you talking about,
young fella?

668
00:54:31,015 --> 00:54:34,280
It ain't an orb. It's a country.

669
00:54:34,452 --> 00:54:37,888
-Why, America is one of the finest--
-Silence!

670
00:54:41,225 --> 00:54:44,160
Now, once and for all,
where are you from?

671
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:50,130
-Just say I'm from the world.
-What world?

672
00:54:50,301 --> 00:54:55,739
-Why, the world, of course.
-"The world"?

673
00:54:56,073 --> 00:54:58,473
Well, there's billions of them.
Next.

674
00:54:58,642 --> 00:55:02,271
The one that has a sun and the moon
and Mars, Neptune, and Jupiter--

675
00:55:02,446 --> 00:55:03,811
Hold on.

676
00:55:03,981 --> 00:55:05,278
-Jupiter?
-Jupiter.

677
00:55:05,449 --> 00:55:06,473
Jupiter.

678
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:11,053
Seems to me we had a man from there
eight or 900 years ago.

679
00:55:14,759 --> 00:55:19,025
Did you come straight here
from your system?

680
00:55:22,466 --> 00:55:24,229
Yes, sir.

681
00:55:25,402 --> 00:55:31,068
That is not true.
And this is no place for a fib.

682
00:55:32,243 --> 00:55:36,111
You wandered from your course.
How did that happen?

683
00:55:37,414 --> 00:55:40,508
I'm sorry. I take back what I said.

684
00:55:40,684 --> 00:55:43,949
I confess. I raced a little
with a comet one day--

685
00:55:44,121 --> 00:55:47,420
Only just the least little bit.
Only the tiniest little bit.

686
00:55:47,591 --> 00:55:51,391
So that divergence has caused
all this trouble.

687
00:55:51,562 --> 00:55:55,293
Well, it's landed you at a gate that's
billions of leagues from the right one.

688
00:55:58,669 --> 00:56:00,261
Oh, go on in.

689
00:56:00,437 --> 00:56:04,498
You'll be safe forever, and you won't
have any more trouble. Next.

690
00:56:04,675 --> 00:56:06,472
I'm off.

691
00:56:08,112 --> 00:56:11,411
Well, quick, where are you from?

692
00:56:11,582 --> 00:56:13,550
Well, I beg your pardon, mister...

693
00:56:13,717 --> 00:56:15,480
...but ain't you forgot something?

694
00:56:15,653 --> 00:56:17,780
Forgot something?

695
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:24,358
-Not that I know of.
-Why, my harp.

696
00:56:24,528 --> 00:56:29,397
And my wreath and my halo and
my hymnbook and my palm branch.

697
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:32,693
I never heard of these things before.

698
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:34,269
Oh, trust me.

699
00:56:34,438 --> 00:56:39,398
You won't be conspicuous
in this district without it.

700
00:56:41,779 --> 00:56:44,304
Well, good day.

701
00:56:55,993 --> 00:56:58,120
Turns me on.

702
00:56:59,029 --> 00:57:02,521
Do it again to me, just like that.
Yes!

703
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,965
Sock it to me, sock it to me,
sock it to me.

704
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,766
Oh, yeah.

705
00:57:14,278 --> 00:57:16,610
Hey there.

706
00:57:19,483 --> 00:57:21,144
-Yes, man.
-Yes, man.

707
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:25,687
-Dare we do any more?
-Yeah! Yes, yes, yes.

708
00:57:30,895 --> 00:57:32,556
Well....

709
00:57:35,399 --> 00:57:37,993
Well, look who's here.

710
00:57:39,169 --> 00:57:40,830
You know, I begin to see...

711
00:57:41,005 --> 00:57:45,806
...that a man has got to be
in his own heaven to be happy.

712
00:57:47,511 --> 00:57:49,638
Oh, perfectly correct.

713
00:57:49,813 --> 00:57:54,409
Did you imagine that the same heaven
would suit all sorts of people?

714
00:57:54,952 --> 00:57:59,013
-Go that way.
-A million leagues or so.

715
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:00,716
Well, thank you, sir.

716
00:58:00,891 --> 00:58:02,950
-So long.
-Au revoir.

717
00:58:03,127 --> 00:58:06,426
It's been swell. It's been grand.

718
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:15,902
Harp, hymnbook, pair of wings.

719
00:58:16,073 --> 00:58:18,132
-Halo, size 13.
-Size 13.

720
00:58:18,309 --> 00:58:21,506
-For Captain Eli Stormfield of--
-San Francisco, you betcha.

721
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:24,341
Make him out a clean bill
of health and let him in.

722
00:58:24,515 --> 00:58:27,450
Show me a cloud. I'm all right now.

723
00:58:30,721 --> 00:58:32,780
I think--

724
00:58:32,957 --> 00:58:37,485
Oh, sorry, I forgot.
Supposed to be quiet.

725
00:58:38,729 --> 00:58:41,630
A harp, a hymnbook and wings?

726
00:58:41,799 --> 00:58:43,926
Good God, what a swindle.

727
00:58:45,769 --> 00:58:48,363
I'm led to consider a different path.

728
00:58:48,539 --> 00:58:52,669
Heaven for climate,
hell for company.

729
00:58:55,379 --> 00:58:58,348
Either way,
you gotta die to get there.

730
00:58:58,515 --> 00:59:02,178
Land sakes. Set her back!

731
00:59:02,353 --> 00:59:05,049
-What's that?
-Ah, the Sphinx.

732
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:08,888
Nothing to be afraid of. It's only the "Phanx."

733
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:11,425
That's "Sphinx."

734
00:59:15,032 --> 00:59:19,332
Now, with the right wind,
we should go aloft right here.

735
00:59:19,536 --> 00:59:21,197
The comet is still some time off.

736
00:59:21,372 --> 00:59:24,205
Best we should impose
on this great beast...

737
00:59:24,375 --> 00:59:26,536
...to secure our anchor.

738
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:29,577
We're cooked. That's the end.
We're goners.

739
00:59:29,747 --> 00:59:34,480
There is no sadder sight
than a young pessimist...

740
00:59:34,852 --> 00:59:38,083
...except an old optimist.

741
00:59:38,889 --> 00:59:40,151
Let's see....

742
00:59:40,724 --> 00:59:43,420
-We'll have to wait to ascend...
-Come on.

743
00:59:43,594 --> 00:59:47,621
...until exactly six o'clock.

744
00:59:50,868 --> 00:59:54,998
So when the alarm goes off,
the knife cuts the rope...

745
00:59:55,172 --> 00:59:57,936
...and the ax smashes the--

746
00:59:58,108 --> 01:00:00,338
-What?
-Thought I heard him coming.

747
01:00:00,511 --> 01:00:03,241
No, it's only Homer.

748
01:00:03,414 --> 01:00:05,177
I think that ought to do it.

749
01:00:05,949 --> 01:00:08,679
Why don't we just take the ax
and smash it now?

750
01:00:08,852 --> 01:00:12,219
What's the good of a plan
that's no more trouble than that?

751
01:00:12,389 --> 01:00:14,118
Timing's everything.

752
01:00:14,291 --> 01:00:17,021
You heard Mr. Twain. Six o'clock.

753
01:00:18,796 --> 01:00:20,354
Come on.

754
01:00:38,082 --> 01:00:41,984
My good old ancestor, Adam.

755
01:00:45,456 --> 01:00:50,223
How deep a debt of gratitude
we owe to Adam and Eve.

756
01:00:51,862 --> 01:00:54,456
They brought death into the world.

757
01:01:00,137 --> 01:01:01,604
The diary.

758
01:01:01,772 --> 01:01:03,603
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

759
01:01:04,908 --> 01:01:06,637
We never finished
Adam and Eve's story.

760
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:08,072
Oh, that's right.

761
01:01:08,245 --> 01:01:12,341
-I guess we have time.
-Sure, we've got plenty of time.

762
01:01:12,916 --> 01:01:14,747
Now, let's see, where were we?

763
01:01:14,918 --> 01:01:16,909
Oh, yeah.
Eve had just eaten the apple...

764
01:01:17,087 --> 01:01:19,578
...and rearranged the world a little.

765
01:01:22,025 --> 01:01:26,985
After the disaster, Adam found
a place outside the garden...

766
01:01:27,164 --> 01:01:30,133
...and was fairly comfortable
for a while.

767
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:48,211
I was not sorry she came.

768
01:01:48,385 --> 01:01:50,148
There are but meager
pickings here...

769
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,686
...and she brought
some of those apples.

770
01:01:53,157 --> 01:01:55,318
It was against my principles...

771
01:01:55,492 --> 01:01:59,189
...but I find that principles have
no real force...

772
01:01:59,363 --> 01:02:01,524
...except when one is well-fed.

773
01:02:25,389 --> 01:02:27,880
I find she's at least a companion.

774
01:02:28,058 --> 01:02:30,253
I would be lonely 
and depressed without her...

775
01:02:30,427 --> 01:02:34,090
...now that we've lost our property.

776
01:03:24,414 --> 01:03:25,711
Tuesday.

777
01:03:27,184 --> 01:03:31,052
She says it is ordered that 
we will work for a living hereafter.

778
01:03:31,555 --> 01:03:35,514
She will be useful.
I will superintend.

779
01:03:49,473 --> 01:03:51,373
-What is it?
-Fire.

780
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:56,236
-How do you know?
-It looks like fire.

781
01:03:56,413 --> 01:04:00,008
It annoyed him that I should know,
and he must ask.

782
01:04:00,183 --> 01:04:03,243
-How did it come?
-I made it.

783
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:05,718
-What are these?
-Coals.

784
01:04:05,889 --> 01:04:09,120
He picked one up, but changed
his mind and put it down again.

785
01:04:09,293 --> 01:04:11,318
Then he went away.

786
01:04:11,795 --> 01:04:14,889
Nothing interests him.

787
01:04:18,468 --> 01:04:21,335
I was mistaken about her
in the beginning.

788
01:04:21,505 --> 01:04:25,134
Perhaps it is better to live
outside the garden with her...

789
01:04:25,309 --> 01:04:27,539
... than inside without her.

790
01:04:28,178 --> 01:04:31,045
Would you like to see my etchings?

791
01:04:37,487 --> 01:04:39,580
Eve calls it "Cain."

792
01:04:39,756 --> 01:04:43,055
I believe she caught it
in the timber.

793
01:04:43,593 --> 01:04:46,061
It's a new and different
kind of animal.

794
01:04:47,698 --> 01:04:49,825
A fish, perhaps.

795
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,867
Sometimes she carries it
in her arms half the night...

796
01:04:53,036 --> 01:04:56,005
... when it complains
and wants to get to the water.

797
01:04:56,873 --> 01:05:00,274
I have never seen her do this
with any other fish...

798
01:05:00,811 --> 01:05:03,507
...and it troubles me greatly.

799
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:07,978
I have come to like Sundays.

800
01:05:09,319 --> 01:05:12,186
Superintending all the week
tires the body so.

801
01:05:15,959 --> 01:05:19,190
I have not seen a fish
that could laugh.

802
01:05:21,898 --> 01:05:24,093
This makes me doubt.

803
01:05:24,267 --> 01:05:27,430
I do not love Adam
on account of his brightness...

804
01:05:27,604 --> 01:05:31,165
... though I think in time
it will develop.

805
01:05:34,611 --> 01:05:36,374
He is self-educated...

806
01:05:36,546 --> 01:05:40,346
...and really knows
a multitude of things.

807
01:05:40,517 --> 01:05:42,849
But none of them are true.

808
01:05:45,088 --> 01:05:46,988
It isn't a fish.

809
01:05:47,157 --> 01:05:51,560
Now, in my judgment, it is either
an enigma or some kind of bug.

810
01:05:51,895 --> 01:05:54,830
I never had a thing perplex me so.

811
01:05:55,432 --> 01:05:59,869
Perhaps I could take it apart
and see what its arrangements are.

812
01:06:03,507 --> 01:06:08,638
It is not a kangaroo.
It is probably some kind of bear.

813
01:06:08,812 --> 01:06:10,211
Mama. Papa.

814
01:06:12,249 --> 01:06:14,717
This resemblance to words
is extraordinary...

815
01:06:14,885 --> 01:06:17,911
...and is a thing
which no other bear can do.

816
01:06:18,088 --> 01:06:23,287
This one will be less dangerous when
it has company of its own species.

817
01:06:23,693 --> 01:06:27,629
I will make an exhaustive search.

818
01:06:34,271 --> 01:06:36,569
Why do I love him?

819
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:41,143
I guess just because he is a man...

820
01:06:41,611 --> 01:06:44,774
...and because he is mine.

821
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:57,188
It has been a weary hunt...

822
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:00,420
...yet I have had no success.

823
01:07:01,131 --> 01:07:03,463
But without so much
as stirring from home...

824
01:07:03,633 --> 01:07:06,067
...she has caught another one.

825
01:07:06,603 --> 01:07:09,731
-Hi, Daddy.
-I never saw such luck.

826
01:07:17,214 --> 01:07:18,738
-They were children.
-Good.

827
01:07:18,915 --> 01:07:21,884
Adam and Eve
discovered it in time.

828
01:07:22,052 --> 01:07:26,887
It was their coming in that 
small shape that puzzled them.

829
01:07:29,159 --> 01:07:31,491
Abel is a good boy...

830
01:07:31,661 --> 01:07:35,654
...but if Cain had stayed a bear,
it would have improved him.

831
01:07:36,132 --> 01:07:40,091
-What's going on?
-Here we go.

832
01:07:52,048 --> 01:07:58,078
It is my deepest hope that we may
pass from this life together, but if--

833
01:07:58,255 --> 01:08:02,282
But if one of us must 
go first, let it be me.

834
01:08:02,459 --> 01:08:05,189
For he is strong,
and I am weak and am not--

835
01:08:05,362 --> 01:08:10,527
And am not so necessary
to her as she is to me.

836
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:14,363
Life without him would not be life.

837
01:08:14,538 --> 01:08:16,836
How could I endure it?

838
01:08:20,176 --> 01:08:25,478
Wind in the east.
I think we shall have rain.

839
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,678
-What is it?
-Well, it's a...

840
01:09:01,318 --> 01:09:04,651
-...valentine.
-Valentine?

841
01:09:04,821 --> 01:09:06,948
Where did you get that word?

842
01:09:07,123 --> 01:09:11,719
Well, it... 
It looks like a valentine.

843
01:09:12,662 --> 01:09:16,826
It's a good word
and bears repeating.

844
01:09:37,654 --> 01:09:39,986
The garden is lost...

845
01:09:40,156 --> 01:09:44,217
...but I have found him
and am content.

846
01:10:05,048 --> 01:10:08,074
Wherever she was...

847
01:10:08,251 --> 01:10:11,982
...there was Eden.

848
01:10:25,568 --> 01:10:30,301
I'm tired and old.

849
01:10:31,841 --> 01:10:36,574
I wish I were with my Livy.

850
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:50,126
That's really why you want
to meet the comet, isn't it?

851
01:10:51,961 --> 01:10:55,988
And I am looking forward to that.

852
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:08,172
But, Mr. Twain,
we're too young to die.

853
01:11:08,712 --> 01:11:11,545
Die? Fiddlesticks.
You're not gonna die.

854
01:11:11,715 --> 01:11:14,115
But how are we gonna get home?

855
01:11:14,284 --> 01:11:17,845
Soon as I get to that comet,
this vessel's all yours.

856
01:11:18,321 --> 01:11:20,221
-This ship?
-You mean it?

857
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:23,291
-Oh, bully!
-Oh, no.

858
01:11:26,496 --> 01:11:28,794
Tom, the power.

859
01:11:30,133 --> 01:11:31,122
Oh, no.

860
01:11:32,202 --> 01:11:34,067
Oh, no.

861
01:11:35,839 --> 01:11:38,273
What in tarnation?

862
01:11:38,441 --> 01:11:40,807
The power.
Dag blame it, what's going on?

863
01:11:40,977 --> 01:11:43,639
-We smashed the power panel.
-What?

864
01:11:43,813 --> 01:11:46,008
-We didn't know.
-We're trapped in here.

865
01:11:46,182 --> 01:11:48,673
If we can't get
to the emergency power switch...

866
01:11:48,852 --> 01:11:52,413
-...the air bag will blow us
all to hell. -Oh, no.

867
01:11:52,589 --> 01:11:57,822
-Tom Sawyer, I ought to knock your--
-The porthole. Come on.

868
01:11:57,994 --> 01:12:00,360
Tom, let me try.

869
01:12:02,031 --> 01:12:03,589
It's too small.

870
01:12:03,767 --> 01:12:05,997
-There must be a way.
-Wouldn't bet on it.

871
01:12:06,169 --> 01:12:07,431
Homer. He can do it.

872
01:12:07,604 --> 01:12:10,368
Homer? Huck, this is serious.

873
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:13,338
I been educating him.
He can do most anything.

874
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:14,977
It's a chance in a million.

875
01:12:15,145 --> 01:12:17,340
-At least give him a try.
-What else we got?

876
01:12:17,514 --> 01:12:18,572
All right.

877
01:12:19,149 --> 01:12:20,844
Huck, the emergency 
power button...

878
01:12:21,017 --> 01:12:23,451
...is just inside the back 
rail near the helm...

879
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:26,714
...one foot forward of 
the stabilizer control wheel.

880
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:30,758
What's the distance between my hand
and the stabilizer control wheel?

881
01:12:30,927 --> 01:12:34,454
About 14 feet.
Fourteen and a half feet.

882
01:12:34,631 --> 01:12:37,657
Homer, 14 and a half big ones
as the crow flies, inside the fence...

883
01:12:37,834 --> 01:12:41,565
...hold the backflips until you see
the driver, slide one big one due east.

884
01:12:42,672 --> 01:12:44,731
-What the...?
-It's the pressure.

885
01:12:44,908 --> 01:12:47,638
-Oh, no.
-Well, here goes.

886
01:12:47,977 --> 01:12:51,413
All right, Homer. One for accuracy.

887
01:12:55,985 --> 01:12:57,885
Drat. He missed.

888
01:12:58,054 --> 01:13:00,488
-I knew he couldn't.
-What are we gonna do?

889
01:13:00,657 --> 01:13:04,423
-Homer. Homer!
-Homer!

890
01:13:04,594 --> 01:13:08,963
Homer! Come on, you old toad.

891
01:13:09,132 --> 01:13:10,793
Hit the button.

892
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,697
Homer. Homer.

893
01:13:15,038 --> 01:13:18,007
Will you listen to me, Homer?

894
01:13:23,546 --> 01:13:26,447
-By jinks, he did it!
-Homer.

895
01:13:26,649 --> 01:13:28,742
-Now, look lively, you swags.
-All right!

896
01:13:28,918 --> 01:13:29,907
Let's go.

897
01:13:30,086 --> 01:13:34,147
-Explorers, name your names.
-Huck Finn the Red-Handed.

898
01:13:34,324 --> 01:13:37,293
-Becky Thatcher, Terror of the Skies.
-And Tom Sawyer, Aeronort.

899
01:13:37,493 --> 01:13:39,427
To your battle stations.

900
01:13:39,596 --> 01:13:40,927
Come on.

901
01:13:42,565 --> 01:13:44,192
Homer, you're a hero.

902
01:13:44,367 --> 01:13:45,459
Let's go.

903
01:13:49,772 --> 01:13:51,364
There it goes.

904
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:53,532
-Damn, we missed it.
-Let's catch it.

905
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:57,009
Aye, aye. Hard astarboard.

906
01:13:57,180 --> 01:13:59,978
Okay, here we go.

907
01:14:05,255 --> 01:14:06,722
We need altitude.

908
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:10,451
Jettison the superfluous.

909
01:14:12,228 --> 01:14:14,162
Toss the typesetter.

910
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:17,026
Worst damn investment I ever made.

911
01:14:23,339 --> 01:14:25,307
Shove the formal wear.

912
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:26,974
I have all I need.

913
01:14:29,612 --> 01:14:31,170
Hold on there.
Keep that manuscript.

914
01:14:32,515 --> 01:14:34,073
It won't be published for years.

915
01:14:34,918 --> 01:14:39,787
We are fast rising from 
affluence to poverty.

916
01:14:54,337 --> 01:14:55,929
It's way ahead of us.

917
01:14:56,105 --> 01:14:58,005
-Ahead full.
-Right.

918
01:15:01,511 --> 01:15:05,572
-Commission the auxiliary thrusters.
-Aye, aye, sir.

919
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:09,710
-All right, pour on the coal.
-Yes, sir.

920
01:15:11,554 --> 01:15:16,184
All hands lay to.
Raise the stabilizers!

921
01:15:16,359 --> 01:15:19,192
Put some steam into them.

922
01:15:20,129 --> 01:15:22,256
Stabilizers activated, sir.

923
01:15:26,903 --> 01:15:28,200
-Tom?
-Yes, sir.

924
01:15:28,371 --> 01:15:30,362
Lower the pressure valve.

925
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:35,172
-Okay, we're catching it.
-Here, let me help, Tom.

926
01:15:43,152 --> 01:15:44,744
Meteors.

927
01:15:46,622 --> 01:15:48,783
Watch out ahead, sir.

928
01:15:53,963 --> 01:15:59,162
Don't be afraid. Providence 
protects children and idiots.

929
01:15:59,702 --> 01:16:02,535
I know it's true. I've tested it.

930
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:09,675
-Tom!
-I got it.

931
01:16:14,784 --> 01:16:16,945
We're gaining on her.

932
01:16:19,088 --> 01:16:23,115
-We're hit.
-Fire up the handy retriever.

933
01:16:36,205 --> 01:16:38,002
We got one.

934
01:16:39,475 --> 01:16:40,464
Got another one.

935
01:16:51,154 --> 01:16:53,088
-They're thinning out.
-This is critical.

936
01:16:53,256 --> 01:16:54,689
We're entering the channel.

937
01:16:54,857 --> 01:16:56,757
Huck, pull back
the thrusters one half.

938
01:16:56,926 --> 01:17:00,054
-Aye, aye, captain.
-We must be very careful.

939
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:05,497
Getting shallow and murky.

940
01:17:05,668 --> 01:17:09,229
-Can't see.
-Larboard lead there.

941
01:17:09,405 --> 01:17:11,703
-To the sounding guns.
-Yes, sir.

942
01:17:12,842 --> 01:17:14,901
Sound out.

943
01:17:19,048 --> 01:17:20,811
Mark three.

944
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:23,718
-Mark three.
-Ahead one third.

945
01:17:23,886 --> 01:17:25,046
Yes, captain.

946
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:28,687
Half twain.

947
01:17:28,858 --> 01:17:30,553
-Starboard half twain.
-That's too close.

948
01:17:30,726 --> 01:17:32,660
-Mr. Twain!
-Good God.

949
01:17:32,995 --> 01:17:35,691
Hang on. Back two-thirds.

950
01:17:35,865 --> 01:17:39,494
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Tom, sound out.

951
01:17:40,336 --> 01:17:42,861
-Less twain.
-Port less twain.

952
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,973
Now stand by, Huck.

953
01:17:50,746 --> 01:17:54,238
-Mark twain.
-Mark twain.

954
01:17:54,417 --> 01:17:56,612
Mark twain.

955
01:17:56,786 --> 01:17:59,949
Now let her have it.
Every ounce you've got.

956
01:18:03,793 --> 01:18:05,693
Dad-blame.

957
01:18:15,471 --> 01:18:18,099
-Hang on.
-Okay.

958
01:18:29,485 --> 01:18:32,147
By jinks, we've done it!

959
01:18:32,321 --> 01:18:34,152
-We made it.
-Doggone it.

960
01:18:34,323 --> 01:18:35,483
That was bully.

961
01:18:36,359 --> 01:18:39,692
Great guns, that was well done.

962
01:18:39,862 --> 01:18:42,626
Cabbages to cauliflowers.

963
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:46,591
Yeah, okay, calm down, Homer.

964
01:18:53,075 --> 01:18:56,067
Come on out and show yourself.

965
01:18:56,245 --> 01:18:57,906
There you go,
scaring everybody again.

966
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:01,607
-Great Scott, look!
-And you haunted me long enough.

967
01:19:01,784 --> 01:19:03,046
Let's get this over with.

968
01:19:03,219 --> 01:19:04,846
-Two Mark Twains?
-What's going on?

969
01:19:05,021 --> 01:19:07,148
-How can there be two of you?
-This is craziness.

970
01:19:07,323 --> 01:19:11,089
Everyone is a moon
and has a dark side...

971
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:16,493
...which he never shows to 
anybody if he can help it.

972
01:19:16,666 --> 01:19:19,157
I've seen you before.

973
01:19:19,335 --> 01:19:23,567
You've been on this ship
the whole time, haven't you?

974
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,809
Why don't we tie that other one up
to keep him from going with you?

975
01:19:27,977 --> 01:19:30,377
-Yeah.
-He's such a rapscallion.

976
01:19:30,546 --> 01:19:32,446
He must come with me, Tom.

977
01:19:32,615 --> 01:19:34,207
I'm not whole without him.

978
01:19:34,383 --> 01:19:35,645
What about us?

979
01:19:35,818 --> 01:19:40,619
You shall ably sail the Mark Twain
around the world...

980
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:42,917
...for a long time.

981
01:19:43,092 --> 01:19:45,026
You are a capable crew...

982
01:19:45,194 --> 01:19:49,130
...and this ship,
a large enough body of work...

983
01:19:49,298 --> 01:19:50,959
...that you may live forever.

984
01:19:51,133 --> 01:19:53,465
Or long enough.

985
01:19:54,270 --> 01:20:00,266
My books are water.
Those of the great geniuses are wine.

986
01:20:00,443 --> 01:20:03,537
Everybody drinks water.

987
01:20:05,448 --> 01:20:06,813
Let me see.

988
01:20:06,983 --> 01:20:11,613
There are a number of things
I need to tell you before I go.

989
01:20:13,923 --> 01:20:17,882
Always obey your parents.

990
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:20,995
When they are present.

991
01:20:22,164 --> 01:20:24,689
Be respectful of your superiors.

992
01:20:24,867 --> 01:20:26,266
If you have any.

993
01:20:26,435 --> 01:20:31,896
Rise early, for it is the early bird
that catches the worm.

994
01:20:32,074 --> 01:20:36,033
I once knew a man who tried it,
got up at sunrise.

995
01:20:36,212 --> 01:20:37,941
Horse bit him.

996
01:20:41,617 --> 01:20:45,849
-It's time.
-I'm still considering whether to go.

997
01:20:46,022 --> 01:20:49,014
I have never seen
an atom of truth...

998
01:20:49,191 --> 01:20:51,557
...that there is a future life.

999
01:20:51,727 --> 01:20:55,720
Yet I am strongly inclined
to expect one.

1000
01:20:55,898 --> 01:21:00,631
Anyway, don't be such a sissy
in the face of a real adventure.

1001
01:21:03,372 --> 01:21:05,272
Well....

1002
01:21:05,441 --> 01:21:11,175
And I'm not as big a fool as Stormfield.
If I can't swear, I won't stay.

1003
01:21:29,932 --> 01:21:31,263
Look.

1004
01:21:34,103 --> 01:21:37,698
Mr. Twain,
where's the comet going now?

1005
01:21:37,873 --> 01:21:43,436
To Eden, angelfish.
Back to Eden.

1006
01:21:52,722 --> 01:21:56,658
I found this
in Adam and Eve's diary.

1007
01:21:57,226 --> 01:21:58,921
You can have it.

1008
01:22:02,732 --> 01:22:04,165
Yeah, well, I found these.

1009
01:22:10,172 --> 01:22:16,668
The human race, in all its poverty,
has only one truly effective weapon:

1010
01:22:16,846 --> 01:22:18,211
Laughter.

1011
01:22:18,381 --> 01:22:22,078
Against the assault of laughter...

1012
01:22:23,753 --> 01:22:26,654
...nothing can stand.

1013
01:22:31,861 --> 01:22:34,659
-Hang on.
-Grab a rail.

1014
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:36,388
Okay now, level her out.

1015
01:22:36,565 --> 01:22:39,625
Well, this is one adventure Mr. Twain
wouldn't get around to writing.

1016
01:22:39,802 --> 01:22:40,791
Steady as you go.

1017
01:22:40,970 --> 01:22:43,996
So I figured to get it all down
before I forgot a single thing.

1018
01:22:44,173 --> 01:22:46,107
Let me help you write it, okay?

1019
01:22:46,275 --> 01:22:48,835
-After all, I am pretty much the hero.
-Well, I....

1020
01:22:49,011 --> 01:22:51,946
When it's done, we'll get it
to a publisher, just like Mr. Twain.

1021
01:22:52,114 --> 01:22:54,514
-Okay, you start it.
-You're asking for it, Huck.

1022
01:22:54,683 --> 01:22:55,843
Okay, ready?

1023
01:22:56,018 --> 01:22:57,383
The Adventures of Mark Twain...

1024
01:22:57,553 --> 01:22:59,646
...by the great, famous,
world-renowned...

1025
01:22:59,822 --> 01:23:03,690
...celebrated author and aeronaut...

1026
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:05,656
... Tom Sawyer.
