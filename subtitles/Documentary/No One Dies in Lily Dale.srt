1
00:00:08,712 --> 00:00:10,914
Should we be doing this?
It's still a crime scene.

2
00:00:10,954 --> 00:00:14,077
Sack up, Billy. It's called
"investigative journalism" for a reason.

3
00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:17,040
Yeah, but don't we need a press pass
or a permit or something?

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,082
Press pass this!

5
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:22,324
You know, the police missed
something here, I can feel it.

6
00:00:22,364 --> 00:00:25,728
What do you say, Billy? Won't a Peabody
Award look great up on your...

7
00:00:51,432 --> 00:00:54,434
Yo, Chuck, speed up, man!
Yeah, man, speed up.

8
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:57,557
Guys, this is my dad's car.
So if I go any faster, he will kill me.

9
00:00:57,598 --> 00:00:59,120
Holy shit!

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,321
- Shit!
- Jesus, that was close.

11
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:02,802
You fucking assholes!

12
00:01:02,843 --> 00:01:05,764
We are in hillbilly country now, boys.
Squeal like a pig!

13
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:07,287
Yeehaw!

14
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:10,049
Chad, just cos they're not in your
fraternity doesn't mean they're freaks.

15
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:14,333
Actually, it does, Allison. You see,
you're either Omega Beta or you're a freak.

16
00:01:14,413 --> 00:01:16,575
- Omega Beta! Omega Beta!
- Fuck.

17
00:01:16,614 --> 00:01:19,497
- Chi, chi, chi!
- I'm in a oar full of morons.

18
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,621
No, if we were morons,
we wouldn't have thought to bring this.

19
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:25,703
OK, I stand corrected.
You are a fucking genius.

20
00:01:25,744 --> 00:01:28,227
Hey, Chuck, speed up, man.
They're gonna pass us.

21
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:29,587
Oh, jeez. Whoa, Jesus.

22
00:01:38,756 --> 00:01:41,359
Did you see the way
those guys looked at us?

23
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:43,721
Hey, guys! Guys!

24
00:01:45,402 --> 00:01:46,923
We forgot the beer!

25
00:01:46,962 --> 00:01:48,604
No!

26
00:02:22,197 --> 00:02:27,481
Sure you got everything
you need? Cos once you get up there...

27
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,010
Can I help you?

28
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,572
Uh, yeah. Where's your beer at?

29
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:42,335
Beer's in the back.

30
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:50,262
You see the way them kids looked?

31
00:02:53,746 --> 00:02:57,629
Read that list back to me.
OK, three-quarter-inch nails,

32
00:02:57,669 --> 00:03:00,792
hacksaw, baling hooks,

33
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:04,196
brush-clearing Scythe, clamps...

34
00:03:04,236 --> 00:03:05,958
Hey, Chad, do we need more bug...

35
00:03:06,037 --> 00:03:08,440
- "crosscutting handsaw...
- Chad?

36
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,682
- lubricated condoms...
- Chad?

37
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:12,122
Hand drill...

38
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:20,611
_.feminine napkins,
stone bit, one-eighth hole saw...

39
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:23,133
- Oh, my God!
- It's just me.

40
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:27,418
Let's get out of here.
This place is so creepy.

41
00:03:34,102 --> 00:03:37,588
- Dale, we need anything else?
- Pickled eggs. Six-pounder.

42
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:43,151
Oh, hot dog, Tucker. Have you ever
seen anything like that in your life?

43
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:47,156
There's nothing so special about them.

44
00:03:47,196 --> 00:03:51,359
- They're just your average college girls.
- Nothing average about that.

45
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,921
You know something, Dale?

46
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:55,323
She's just human. Why don't you
go over there and talk to her?

47
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:58,607
Talk to her? What?
What in the world would I say?

48
00:03:58,646 --> 00:04:03,691
I don't know. Tell her that you got a vacation home.
That'll probably impress her.

49
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,295
Are you out of your mind, Tucker?
These are college girls.

50
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:09,617
They grew up with vacation homes,
and guys like me fixing their toilets.

51
00:04:09,657 --> 00:04:12,699
You gotta have some faith in yourself, man.
Girls can smell fear.

52
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:15,542
Now come on!
You are a good-lookin' man...

53
00:04:15,582 --> 00:04:16,944
more or less.

54
00:04:16,984 --> 00:04:18,264
You got a damn good heart.

55
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:19,827
Yup.

56
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:23,229
I mean, that's two things right there.
Now, go on, get over there.

57
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,191
What's the worst that could happen?

58
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:29,076
You know something?

59
00:04:30,597 --> 00:04:33,919
- You're right, Tuck. I'm gonna do it.
- All right.

60
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,241
- I'm gonna do it right now.
- All right, hold up.

61
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:40,566
All right, now, whatever you say,
just smile and laugh.

62
00:04:40,606 --> 00:04:42,087
It shows confidence.

63
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:45,210
Smile and laugh. OK.

64
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,172
- Do it.
- All right.

65
00:05:02,226 --> 00:05:05,108
You guys, uh...goin' campin'?

66
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:13,116
Hey! Hey. Now, look...
we don't want any trouble, all right?

67
00:05:13,156 --> 00:05:14,877
- So just...back off.
- Whoa!

68
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:16,319
- OK. OK. I'm sorry.
- Back off!

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,082
Get in the truck.

70
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:25,527
That's a-a good-lookin' cooler...

71
00:05:34,496 --> 00:05:38,018
I told you, Tucker.
I'm a zero with the ladies.

72
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:41,143
They hate my face!

73
00:05:41,662 --> 00:05:42,983
Come on.

74
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:53,434
I ain't like you, Tucker, you know?
I can't talk to the ladyfolk the way you can.

75
00:05:53,474 --> 00:05:55,875
No one can. I mean, I...

76
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:59,878
I always get all stupid, and my hands get
clammy, and I just act like a big fat idiot.

77
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,483
You know what your problem is?
You got an inferiority complex.

78
00:06:03,523 --> 00:06:05,005
No, I don't.

79
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:06,645
- Yeah, yeah.
- No.

80
00:06:06,686 --> 00:06:09,849
Let me tell you something, life is short.
You got to go after what you want.

81
00:06:09,888 --> 00:06:11,169
Mm-hm.

82
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,453
Cos it sure as hell
ain't gonna just fall right in your lap.

83
00:06:14,493 --> 00:06:16,054
- That's true, I reckon.
- Aw, shit.

84
00:06:16,095 --> 00:06:18,457
- What are you doing?
- Shit, shit. We got a cop.

85
00:06:18,497 --> 00:06:19,978
Oh, I got you.

86
00:06:20,018 --> 00:06:23,102
I got a rag. Move your arm.
You spilled beer all over your crotch.

87
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:25,023
All right, he's pulling over.

88
00:06:25,864 --> 00:06:27,145
- Get up, Dale.
- I can't.

89
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:29,747
- Dale, he's coming.
- No, it's stuck on my sleeve.

90
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:31,068
- Get up.
- My hand is stuck on...

91
00:06:31,109 --> 00:06:33,592
Un-stuck it, then.
He's out of his car.

92
00:06:33,631 --> 00:06:35,352
He's out of his car?
He's coming.

93
00:06:35,393 --> 00:06:37,074
- Tucker!
- Get it...

94
00:06:41,678 --> 00:06:43,039
Yeah.

95
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:47,363
- Howdy, Officer.
- Hey.

96
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:50,847
- It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
- Yeah.

97
00:06:50,887 --> 00:06:51,887
License, please.

98
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:56,572
Uh, I lost my wallet a couple weeks back.
New one is in the mail.

99
00:06:59,054 --> 00:07:00,535
Temporary.

100
00:07:00,576 --> 00:07:02,137
Where you two headed?

101
00:07:02,177 --> 00:07:05,301
We're headed to our vacation home
up by Morris Lake.

102
00:07:06,902 --> 00:07:09,183
I sank every penny I had into it.

103
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:12,587
Me and Dale here, we're gonna go fix
'er up, maybe do a little fishin'.

104
00:07:12,626 --> 00:07:15,430
- Do a little fishin'.
- He's been striking out with the ladies.

105
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,233
I figured a little man time
might do him some good.

106
00:07:19,113 --> 00:07:24,878
There ain't nothing up there but pain and
suffering on a scale you can't even imagine.

107
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,324
I pulled you over cos
you got a broken turn signal.

108
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:32,966
Oh, yes, sir.

109
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:35,688
See that you, uh...

110
00:07:37,931 --> 00:07:39,131
get that fixed.

111
00:07:39,212 --> 00:07:41,053
That was very helpful.

112
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,422
- Man, that was tense.
- That dude's weird.

113
00:07:50,462 --> 00:07:51,663
There he goes.

114
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:53,745
Bye _

115
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:57,348
God, would you look at him?
You know what his problem is?

116
00:07:57,388 --> 00:08:00,232
He was jealous because
he can't afford a place of his own.

117
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,434
Ah. Well...

118
00:08:02,474 --> 00:08:05,797
Here's to the good life, huh?

119
00:08:07,437 --> 00:08:10,000
- Oh, yeah.
- To the good life, man.

120
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:28,337
I mean, what's a parasite?
Oh, look at this little truck right here!

121
00:08:28,378 --> 00:08:31,061
I know, I know.
Is that ours?

122
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:32,982
Wow. And another one right there.

123
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:51,479
Oh, my God.

124
00:08:53,161 --> 00:08:54,562
It's perfect!

125
00:08:54,603 --> 00:08:57,325
- And what did they call this, a fixer-upper?
- Yeah.

126
00:08:58,526 --> 00:09:01,049
- All right, let's go check it out inside.
- Yeah.

127
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:04,171
I can't believe this is ours! Oh, my God!

128
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:14,981
- Well, it's just a little dusty is all.
- It's a mansion!

129
00:09:25,551 --> 00:09:29,394
Whoever used to live here must have been
an archaeologist or something.

130
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:32,077
Yeah, archae... Yeah.

131
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:35,160
Look at this.
Must have been a real news junkie, too.

132
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:46,731
Chubby's Chili Dog Depot?
Buy three, get two free. No expiration date.

133
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:49,894
- All right.
- Score!

134
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:53,737
Tucker, look! They got my favourite
board game here, too.

135
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:57,342
You know what?
I tell you something, Dale.

136
00:09:57,381 --> 00:10:00,785
I cannot believe that I am standing
in my own vacation home right now.

137
00:10:00,824 --> 00:10:02,945
You know something?

138
00:10:03,866 --> 00:10:06,229
Dreams really do come true.

139
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:07,470
Look out!

140
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:11,714
- Whoa!
- Well, I guess we should fix that.

141
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:13,916
Yeah, that's a good idea.

142
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:17,319
You can get off me now.

143
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,762
If you have a reoccurring dream about sucking
a dick but never do it, are you gay?

144
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:22,283
- Yes.
- Really?

145
00:10:22,324 --> 00:10:23,444
- Guys!
- Are you serious?

146
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:25,848
- What?
- You guys want to hear a scary story?

147
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:28,049
No!
Chuck, no.

148
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:29,851
- Absolutely not.
- That's not funny.

149
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,814
- You're such a liar.
- It happened to my cousins, I think.

150
00:10:32,854 --> 00:10:36,858
Now, do you fuckers
want to hear a real story? Huh?

151
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:44,904
This story happened right here,
right in these very woods.

152
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:49,189
It was 20 years ago today.

153
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:56,636
The Memorial Day Massacre.

154
00:10:57,397 --> 00:11:01,880
How a bunch of college kids...
just like us...

155
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,522
they came out here to have a good time...

156
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:11,970
but little did they know that they weren't
the only ones in these here woods.

157
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:14,732
Pump Up The Jam)

158
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:17,295
Pump it up
While your feet are stompin'.

159
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:19,217
And the jam is pumpin'...

160
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:22,460
J' Pump it up a little more.

161
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,862
J* Get the party going on the dance Hoof.

162
00:11:24,902 --> 00:11:27,264
J' See, cos that's where the...

163
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:29,587
Get another one! Come on!

164
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,310
J' I'm gonna meet my maker.

165
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:34,871
J' I ain't afraid to die.

166
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:39,077
- Hey, what the hell are you doing?
- Yeah, put that back on.

167
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,278
No, no.
This is cool, I like this.

168
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:22,796
Only one person lived to tell this story.

169
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:26,199
The rest of them just disappeared...

170
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,243
and their bodies are buried beneath us.

171
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,768
Hey! Hey! There's a lake back there.

172
00:12:35,808 --> 00:12:37,810
Who wants to go skinny dipping?

173
00:12:37,849 --> 00:12:40,252
- I do.
- Yeah.

174
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:43,495
- All right.
- I'm not getting naked.

175
00:12:52,223 --> 00:12:54,186
Uh... That's OK, Tuck.

176
00:12:54,226 --> 00:12:55,947
You take that. That's yours.

177
00:12:57,268 --> 00:12:59,470
That's why you're never gonna
get ahead in life.

178
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,113
It's cos you don't stick up for yourself.

179
00:13:03,995 --> 00:13:06,758
Do not even think about it.

180
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:09,159
- But you just said...
- Are you kidding me?

181
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,282
- OW!
- Are you serious?

182
00:13:13,162 --> 00:13:14,164
What'd I just say?

183
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:17,727
- You said I gotta stick up for myself.
- I said, "Don't even think about it", though.

184
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:19,329
That was the last thing I said.

185
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:27,297
Hello?

186
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,660
Is someone there?

187
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,581
Guys?

188
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:38,507
Yargh!

189
00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:41,309
God, Chad! What the hell are you doing?

190
00:13:41,349 --> 00:13:44,231
- You are such an asshole.
- Come on, that was funny.

191
00:13:44,272 --> 00:13:45,674
No, it wasn't.

192
00:13:45,714 --> 00:13:48,116
You got nothing to worry about, Allie.
It's just me.

193
00:13:48,156 --> 00:13:49,998
You totally freaked me out.

194
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:53,801
You know, you can drop the act now.

195
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:57,685
- What act?
- Like you're better than everyone else.

196
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,927
- I don't think...
- Yeah, you do.

197
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:04,010
But that's OK, Allie, because I get it.

198
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,654
I mean, you are better than everyone else.

199
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:10,817
You and I, Allie...

200
00:14:10,857 --> 00:14:14,380
are cut from a different cloth.
You know what I mean?

201
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,383
- I'm not... I...
- All I'm saying is...

202
00:14:19,464 --> 00:14:22,988
I'm glad that we have this chance
to get to know each other better.

203
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,634
Chad, you're drunk.

204
00:14:27,674 --> 00:14:30,956
That's a good thing.
It lowers my inhibitions.

205
00:14:32,478 --> 00:14:33,918
OK, uh...

206
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,160
- Come on, stop.
- Why?

207
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,841
Why? Why stop?

208
00:14:38,683 --> 00:14:40,445
We're perfect for each other.

209
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:45,969
Let's talk about this later.
I'm gonna go catch up with everyone.

210
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,971
Come on, Allie. Come on...

211
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:53,096
Oh, it's so cold!
Here we go!

212
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:56,780
What's that all about?

213
00:14:58,621 --> 00:15:01,424
I don't know,
but I think we should go check it out.

214
00:15:01,464 --> 00:15:03,546
No. No, Tuck, you know what?

215
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:06,348
My guess would be that they
don't really want to see us right now.

216
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:09,953
- Yeah, I kind of want to see them.
- No, no.

217
00:15:10,913 --> 00:15:12,515
What the hell are you doing?

218
00:15:15,477 --> 00:15:16,518
- Damn it, Dale!
- What?

219
00:15:16,557 --> 00:15:19,001
I'm not gonna go around
one more time with you on this.

220
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,803
- OK.
- Hush.

221
00:15:20,842 --> 00:15:25,126
Whoo-hoo! I love camping!

222
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:28,529
Look.

223
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:33,694
Oh.

224
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:39,980
- Tucker!
- Shush!

225
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:46,946
God damn it, Dale!
What the hell is the matter with you?

226
00:15:46,986 --> 00:15:48,548
Me? What did I do?

227
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:51,711
When you see a college girl prancing
around in front of you half-naked,

228
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:55,995
- you do not yell out my name.
- Well, you were being a Peeping Tom.

229
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:58,597
You are hopeless,
do you know that? You're hopeless.

230
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,522
She didn't come up yet.

231
00:16:04,242 --> 00:16:05,965
- Tuck, paddle.
- Oh, Jesus.

232
00:16:07,645 --> 00:16:10,928
Hey! Lady?

233
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:13,653
Hey, lady!

234
00:16:13,692 --> 00:16:17,415
- Where'd she go, Tuck?
- Whoa, whoa, Dale!

235
00:16:20,097 --> 00:16:23,902
Help me get her in the boat! Come on!

236
00:16:24,702 --> 00:16:26,103
Get her legs!

237
00:16:26,143 --> 00:16:28,586
Oh! No!

238
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:31,468
- Hey, we got your friend!
- Oh, God!

239
00:16:31,508 --> 00:16:34,951
They got Allison! Come on!

240
00:16:36,753 --> 00:16:37,955
Hey!

241
00:16:38,995 --> 00:16:41,717
We got your friend! Why the hell
are they running away? Hey!

242
00:16:41,757 --> 00:16:45,441
Doesn't matter, Tucker, we gotta get her
back to the cabin. Come on, let's row.

243
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:47,964
- Shit!
- Oh, man.

244
00:16:48,844 --> 00:16:51,286
Shit.

245
00:16:52,047 --> 00:16:53,928
Chad! Chad!

246
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:56,052
The hillbillies...

247
00:16:56,091 --> 00:16:58,213
- What hillbillies?
- From the store!

248
00:16:58,254 --> 00:17:00,094
They captured Allison!

249
00:17:09,664 --> 00:17:10,825
Allie!

250
00:17:43,015 --> 00:17:45,016
Oh, God! No.

251
00:17:45,057 --> 00:17:49,140
- No, please! No, please, don't...
- Don't...don't cry.

252
00:17:49,181 --> 00:17:50,501
Please don't cut me open!

253
00:17:51,783 --> 00:17:56,787
Oh! It's the pancakes! You hate pancakes!
I'll go make you something else. I'll just...

254
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,790
Doesn't like pancakes.

255
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,033
Should have asked her if she liked
pancakes. Big fat stupid idiot!

256
00:18:03,674 --> 00:18:05,435
Pa... Pancakes?

257
00:18:08,398 --> 00:18:09,520
Allison!

258
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,641
I don't understand.
Where do you think they took her?

259
00:18:11,682 --> 00:18:15,204
- Maybe they took her to the hospital.
- You don't get it, do you?

260
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:17,166
Chuck, tell him what you saw.

261
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:20,490
Well, it was really dark,
but it looked like one of the guys was...

262
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,371
like...eating her face off.

263
00:18:23,532 --> 00:18:25,294
That is so disgusting.

264
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:27,376
Not to sound too cliché,
but shouldn't we go to the police?

265
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,977
And just leave Allison with them?

266
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:30,900
If they already ate her,
what difference does it make?

267
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,142
We don't need the police.
We can handle this on our own.

268
00:18:34,223 --> 00:18:38,105
What if I go? It's my dad's truck.
He told me I was the only one allowed to drive it.

269
00:18:38,145 --> 00:18:39,947
Fine. You wanna go, Chuck? Then just go.

270
00:18:40,027 --> 00:18:42,790
OK, awesome.
I'll be back in a jiffy, I swear.

271
00:18:43,391 --> 00:18:46,113
That's such bullshit.
Why does he get to go?

272
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:56,803
Hey, guys!
You better come look at this.

273
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:02,490
What is this place?

274
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,852
It's just a cabin.
It doesn't mean they're psycho killers.

275
00:19:05,892 --> 00:19:08,854
Oh, yeah? Then why don't you
go in there and talk to them?

276
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:10,776
All right. Maybe I will.

277
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,421
I said maybe.

278
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:40,444
There you go. Please don't tell me
that you hate eggs and bacon.

279
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,929
Wha-What am I doing here?

280
00:19:44,968 --> 00:19:48,092
Oh, you don't remember?
OK. Uh...

281
00:19:48,131 --> 00:19:50,654
Well, me and Tucker...

282
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:52,896
I mean, uh, I and Tuck...

283
00:19:53,615 --> 00:19:54,577
Well...

284
00:19:54,658 --> 00:20:00,183
- Tucker and I brung you here last night.
- Why?

285
00:20:00,222 --> 00:20:02,985
Because you were about
to go swimming with your friends,

286
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:05,828
and you climbed up on a bunch of rocks,
and you fell and banged your head

287
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:08,230
and then you fell into the water,
and then...

288
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,631
I dove in and rescued you.

289
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:15,997
- Wait, you...you were spying on us?
- No. No, what? No!

290
00:20:16,037 --> 00:20:18,160
No, we weren't spying.
No, I swear to God, no, no.

291
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:20,801
We were out there fishin'. OK?
I didn't... We didn't see...

292
00:20:20,841 --> 00:20:23,645
I didn't see...
Maybe Tucker might have seen a little...

293
00:20:23,684 --> 00:20:25,125
Where are my friends?

294
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:29,090
- They ran off into the woods.
- They just left me?

295
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,331
Yeah, but don't be mad at them.

296
00:20:31,372 --> 00:20:34,414
Some people just aren't
any good in a crisis,

297
00:20:34,454 --> 00:20:37,218
and that's why Tucker and I brung you here,

298
00:20:37,258 --> 00:20:39,940
hoping that they would
come get you in the morning.

299
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:44,743
I didn't have any girlie clothes, so...

300
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:46,586
it's OK, I...

301
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,948
I never really had much fashion sense,
anyway.

302
00:20:48,988 --> 00:20:51,270
- Me neither.
- Yeah.

303
00:20:53,472 --> 00:20:57,677
That's my dog, Jangers. He looks mean,
but he's just a big old marshmallow.

304
00:20:57,717 --> 00:20:59,758
You can just pet him round the nose.

305
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:01,839
- He's drooling.
- I know.

306
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,683
Anyway, um...I'm sorry
about all the mess around here.

307
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:09,687
Tucker just bought this place,
and, uh...you know...

308
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:14,091
Yeah, I'm sure it doesn't look like much
to a high-class girl like you,

309
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:18,616
but we've always just had sort of
a dream to have our own vacation home.

310
00:21:19,537 --> 00:21:21,218
But, uh...anyway...

311
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:24,982
you should relax and rest, OK?

312
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:27,424
Hey, what's...
what's your name?

313
00:21:27,464 --> 00:21:29,065
Uh...

314
00:21:29,106 --> 00:21:31,869
It's Tale. Ducker.
My name...

315
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:35,191
- My name is Dale.
- I'm Allison.

316
00:21:35,231 --> 00:21:37,312
But my...
my friends call me Allie.

317
00:21:37,353 --> 00:21:41,197
Well, it's a real pleasure to meet you,
Allie...son.

318
00:21:41,238 --> 00:21:44,279
And if you need anything else,
you just holler for me.

319
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,201
I'll be right in the little room here.

320
00:21:48,803 --> 00:21:50,366
- Uh, Dale?
- Yeah.

321
00:21:51,286 --> 00:21:53,448
Do you guys have
anything to do around here?

322
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:55,009
Do you like board games?

323
00:21:57,091 --> 00:21:58,893
What kind do you have?

324
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:03,217
We got this one right here.
It's my favourite. Trivi-Up.

325
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,901
- Yes!
- Come on, four out of seven.

326
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:09,663
No way, dude. You lost.

327
00:22:10,423 --> 00:22:13,347
Just shut up and walk, bitch.

328
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:28,000
Goddamn Romeo.

329
00:22:29,963 --> 00:22:31,923
Oh, well.

330
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:48,819
Oh, Jesus.

331
00:23:04,435 --> 00:23:05,876
Aargh! Aargh! Argh!

332
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:08,078
Run! Run for your lives!

333
00:23:08,157 --> 00:23:10,359
Yargh!

334
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,212
Here we go. Big roll. Five.

335
00:24:06,251 --> 00:24:08,734
One, two, three, four, five.

336
00:24:08,774 --> 00:24:10,416
OK, shoot.

337
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,059
Who was the fifth President
of the United States?

338
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:15,860
Oh, that's too easy.
That's James Monroe.

339
00:24:17,182 --> 00:24:20,345
God, you are right again.
You are killing me.

340
00:24:20,385 --> 00:24:22,507
I know. I'm sorry about that. I just...

341
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,390
I got this weird brain
where I'm dumb as a stump,

342
00:24:25,469 --> 00:24:28,954
- but I remember everything I ever heard.
- That sounds pretty smart to me.

343
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:33,197
No, trust me, I'm stupid.
I barely even made it past the third grade.

344
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,238
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.

345
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:38,883
There's a difference
between education and intellect.

346
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:44,047
Yeah?

347
00:24:44,928 --> 00:24:49,573
So, um, what is it that
you study in college?

348
00:24:49,612 --> 00:24:51,735
I'm getting my Bachelor's
degree in psychology.

349
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:54,056
Oh, a Bach... Oh.

350
00:24:55,097 --> 00:24:58,460
So, what kind of work
would you do with that?

351
00:24:58,501 --> 00:25:00,462
Oh, I don't know. I, um...

352
00:25:01,864 --> 00:25:03,745
I-I have these stupid dreams.

353
00:25:03,825 --> 00:25:05,307
Dreams are not stupid.

354
00:25:06,988 --> 00:25:12,673
Well, um...I just think that so many of the
major problems and conflicts in the world

355
00:25:12,714 --> 00:25:14,916
are caused by a lack of communication,
you know?

356
00:25:14,956 --> 00:25:15,996
- Yeah.
- And I just...

357
00:25:16,037 --> 00:25:19,279
I just always thought that
I'd make a really good therapist.

358
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,762
No, don't! Don't!

359
00:25:20,801 --> 00:25:24,685
Yeah, my parents say the same thing.
I should probably just give up.

360
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:28,848
No. I think you could do whatever you want.
It's just, that beam is a little bit rickety.

361
00:25:28,888 --> 00:25:31,612
Yeah, you could have just
pushed that thing right over.

362
00:25:31,652 --> 00:25:33,093
Hey, hey.

363
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:35,615
Oh, my God, Tucker,
what happened to your face?

364
00:25:35,655 --> 00:25:37,857
I sawed into a bees' nest.

365
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:40,138
Why?

366
00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:42,782
I didn't do it on purpose, you idiot.

367
00:25:42,863 --> 00:25:45,705
I might have avoided it
if you were out there helping me!

368
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,748
Yeah.

369
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:53,312
We came out here to work...

370
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:55,674
not sit around playing stupid board games!

371
00:25:55,714 --> 00:25:58,516
It was my fault, I...
I suckered him into playing.

372
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,998
No, that's not true. It was my fault.

373
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,563
How about I come over there
and pull those stingers out of your face?

374
00:26:04,602 --> 00:26:06,404
Then I'll help you with whatever you want?

375
00:26:06,444 --> 00:26:09,646
- All right, I'd like that. Thank you.
- OK.

376
00:26:09,686 --> 00:26:12,449
Let me help.
Wow, they really did a number on you.

377
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,253
- Be careful. Be careful.
- They really got you.

378
00:26:15,292 --> 00:26:16,413
Hi.

379
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:18,095
I saw your friend out there.

380
00:26:20,337 --> 00:26:24,781
He must be allergic to bees or something,
because he was runnin' like a bat outta hell.

381
00:26:24,861 --> 00:26:28,505
- I should go out there and find them...
- No, no! That's... No!

382
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:32,067
No, you need to rest,
so we'll go find your friends.

383
00:26:32,108 --> 00:26:35,231
- But I can just...
- No. No buts, OK?

384
00:26:35,272 --> 00:26:38,513
We'll go find your friends. You should relax.
Tucker and Dale are on the case.

385
00:26:38,554 --> 00:26:39,995
Ain't that right, Tucker?

386
00:26:41,796 --> 00:26:43,077
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

387
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:46,081
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. Good man. OK.

388
00:26:47,082 --> 00:26:50,245
Dale, just...
just be careful, OK?

389
00:26:50,284 --> 00:26:52,447
My friends can be kind of judgmental.

390
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,848
I'm gonna let Tucker
do most of the talking, anyway.

391
00:26:54,889 --> 00:26:57,851
He can win over just about anybody,
can't you? Real people person.

392
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:03,657
OK, here we go.
You just relax, OK? Get some rest.

393
00:27:10,744 --> 00:27:14,147
- They fucking killed him, man.
- They left his body here as a message.

394
00:27:14,187 --> 00:27:19,192
- Yeah, "Stay the fuck out of our woods."
- I can't believe this is happening.

395
00:27:19,232 --> 00:27:23,436
Would you fucking quit it with this thing?
It doesn't work out here!

396
00:27:24,516 --> 00:27:26,958
We gotta get to the road
and try to catch a ride out of here.

397
00:27:26,998 --> 00:27:30,522
We don't need a ride out of here.
Don't you get it?

398
00:27:30,562 --> 00:27:33,765
This is what it's all about.
It's us against them.

399
00:27:33,805 --> 00:27:36,607
Survival of the fittest!

400
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,732
What are you doing, man?

401
00:27:40,811 --> 00:27:42,052
That's my whole face.

402
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:44,415
You have serious issues, you know that?

403
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:48,058
- Quick. Somebody's coming.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit...

404
00:27:48,098 --> 00:27:51,542
And the answer was, "isosceles triangle".
You know what that is?

405
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:53,503
Is it a triangle?
Yeah.

406
00:27:53,544 --> 00:27:55,585
Tucker, you would have been proud of me.

407
00:27:55,626 --> 00:27:58,989
A smart little college girl like that,
and I was beating the crap out of her.

408
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:00,671
- Dale.
- Yeah?

409
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,393
You beat the crap outta everybody.
There's something wrong with your brain.

410
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:04,994
I know. You keep telling me that.

411
00:28:05,034 --> 00:28:09,319
Tell you what, when we get back I'll finish her
off real quick then we'll get back to work.

412
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,361
They're gonna kill her!

413
00:28:12,521 --> 00:28:16,404
- Somebody was just here.
- Oh, yeah. It's a hatchet.

414
00:28:18,247 --> 00:28:19,208
College kids!

415
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:24,933
- College kids!
- Say it again. Louder.

416
00:28:24,973 --> 00:28:28,376
- College kids!
- Hey, college kids!

417
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:31,540
College kids!

418
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,061
I don't see 'em.

419
00:28:34,182 --> 00:28:35,903
They must have run off.

420
00:28:36,303 --> 00:28:41,189
Well, hmm... Maybe we could leave
them a note in case they come back.

421
00:28:41,228 --> 00:28:42,430
All right. With what?

422
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,353
- Well, this'll work.
- All right. Please, hurry up.

423
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:50,837
- My face is as hot as a haemorrhoid.
- Yeah, you don't look so good. OK.

424
00:28:50,877 --> 00:28:52,919
- Careful.
- I'm gonna have to etch it in.

425
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,783
Uh-huh, I got my cootie shot.

426
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:20,985
You think that girl is hot...

427
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:23,308
- Dale?
- Yeah? Huh...

428
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:27,391
- Did you guys find my friends?
- Uh, whoa.

429
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,073
Whoa.

430
00:29:29,113 --> 00:29:31,394
- What?
- Huh? What?

431
00:29:31,474 --> 00:29:33,957
Your friends? No, no.
Uh, we left them a note.

432
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,079
They should be by here any minute.

433
00:29:38,762 --> 00:29:41,844
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I'm digging a shitter hole.

434
00:29:41,884 --> 00:29:43,926
I'm digging a crap... crapper hole.
It's a...

435
00:29:43,966 --> 00:29:46,568
It's a hole.
It's for the shithouse. Craphouse...

436
00:29:46,609 --> 00:29:49,171
- Outhouse hole.
- An outhouse hole.

437
00:29:49,891 --> 00:29:52,415
- Right. You mind if I help?
- What? No!

438
00:29:52,455 --> 00:29:55,899
No, no, it's not work for a pretty...
for a girl like you. That's...

439
00:29:55,938 --> 00:29:57,579
Oh.

440
00:29:57,619 --> 00:30:00,622
I grew up on a farm.
It was either help out or get out.

441
00:30:00,662 --> 00:30:01,983
That's a good rule.

442
00:30:02,023 --> 00:30:04,465
Yeah. So I've done this before,
believe it or not.

443
00:30:04,505 --> 00:30:05,508
Yeah.

444
00:30:11,432 --> 00:30:13,633
You gonna help,
or just stand there staring at me?

445
00:30:13,674 --> 00:30:17,077
- Uh... No, I'm gonna help. I'll just...
- I can't dig this on my own.

446
00:30:17,158 --> 00:30:18,558
Yeah, yeah.

447
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:22,203
- Yeah, you're doing a good job.
- Thank you.

448
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:34,734
That sick fuck.
He's making her dig her own grave.

449
00:30:34,774 --> 00:30:36,375
We don't have much time.

450
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,819
- Does everybody have their weapons?
- All set, man.

451
00:30:39,858 --> 00:30:43,701
All right, you guys go around, get the guy
at the wood chipper. You take the big guy.

452
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:49,628
I'm gonna just chill right here.

453
00:30:53,832 --> 00:30:55,474
OK, one more load and we're done.

454
00:30:56,434 --> 00:30:59,718
Hey, come on, get out. Here.

455
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,561
Now!

456
00:31:04,442 --> 00:31:05,683
Huh?

457
00:31:07,163 --> 00:31:09,486
Oh, good, look, your friends are here. Hey!

458
00:31:10,647 --> 00:31:11,968
Dale!

459
00:31:17,093 --> 00:31:20,377
Oh, God!

460
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,332
Are you OK?

461
00:32:02,696 --> 00:32:04,577
Allison, say something!

462
00:32:05,499 --> 00:32:08,782
- Tucker! Tucker!
- Holy mother of God!

463
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:10,903
You'll never beli... What happened to you?

464
00:32:12,145 --> 00:32:14,267
- Are you OK?
- What happened to me?

465
00:32:15,228 --> 00:32:19,592
Some kid, he just hucked himself
right into the wood chipper!

466
00:32:19,632 --> 00:32:21,993
- What?
- Headfirst right into the wood chipper!

467
00:32:22,035 --> 00:32:25,358
From his shoes and pants, it looked like
it might have been one of the college kids.

468
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:27,039
What the hell happened to her?

469
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:30,042
She got knocked out and fell
in the shitter hole right next to me.

470
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,843
Is that your blood?
What? No.

471
00:32:31,882 --> 00:32:35,086
No, it's college kid blood. One of them
suckers came running out of nowhere,

472
00:32:35,126 --> 00:32:37,408
speared himself through the gut
and died right on top of me!

473
00:32:37,448 --> 00:32:39,290
- Holy crap.
- I know!

474
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,531
Calm down. Don't cry.

475
00:32:40,571 --> 00:32:41,572
- Calm down!
- OK.

476
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:43,895
Get a hold of yourself!

477
00:32:46,176 --> 00:32:49,459
All right...
I know what this is.

478
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,381
- What?
- This is a suicide pact.

479
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:54,384
- It's a what?
- These kids are coming out here,

480
00:32:54,424 --> 00:32:58,107
- and killing themselves all over the woods.
- My God, that makes so much sense.

481
00:32:58,147 --> 00:33:00,670
Holy shit. We have got to hide
all of the sharp objects!

482
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,592
You know what else?
I think they're trying to kill her, too.

483
00:33:03,632 --> 00:33:05,515
Yeah. Think about it.

484
00:33:05,555 --> 00:33:09,318
That's why they acted so funny after
we saved her, because they want her dead.

485
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,761
- Why?
- I don't know. I don't know.

486
00:33:13,802 --> 00:33:16,965
It's good that you and I don't know -
if we knew they'd want to kill us, too.

487
00:33:17,006 --> 00:33:18,807
Yeah, that's a good point.

488
00:33:18,847 --> 00:33:21,289
OK, so what... what do we...

489
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:23,612
We go to the police?

490
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:25,333
- Call the police?
- Yeah.

491
00:33:26,374 --> 00:33:29,016
- And tell 'em what?
- Uh...we'll tell 'em what happened.

492
00:33:29,056 --> 00:33:31,218
That's a good idea, Dale.

493
00:33:31,298 --> 00:33:35,342
"Oh, hidey-ho, Officer.
We've had a doozy of a day.

494
00:33:35,382 --> 00:33:38,585
"There we were, minding our own business,
doing some chores around the house,

495
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,868
"when kids started killing themselves
all over my property."

496
00:33:40,908 --> 00:33:42,588
Well, that's what happened, Tucker!

497
00:33:42,628 --> 00:33:45,671
You would have to be a moron
to believe that, Dale.

498
00:33:45,712 --> 00:33:49,756
It doesn't matter what happened. What
matters is what looks like what happened.

499
00:33:49,796 --> 00:33:53,759
And what looks like what happened...
is pretty nasty.

500
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,521
So what the hell do we do?

501
00:33:56,802 --> 00:33:58,684
We gotta clean this mess up.

502
00:33:59,485 --> 00:34:01,847
- Right now.
- OK.

503
00:34:05,249 --> 00:34:07,612
You shouldn't be smoking anyway, Chloe.

504
00:34:07,692 --> 00:34:08,653
It's not good for you.

505
00:34:08,734 --> 00:34:10,615
Fucking dying isn't good for you, either,

506
00:34:10,655 --> 00:34:13,417
but that doesn't
seem to be stopping anybody!

507
00:34:13,457 --> 00:34:16,940
We gotta get out of here. I mean,
what the hell are we still doing here?

508
00:34:16,981 --> 00:34:18,703
How are we gonna get outta here?

509
00:34:18,743 --> 00:34:21,105
Dickwad over here sent Chuck off
with the truck!

510
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:22,546
Well, then let's walk.

511
00:34:22,586 --> 00:34:24,708
- 40 miles?
- You should have thought of that

512
00:34:24,748 --> 00:34:27,511
- before you wore your stripper shoes.
- Will y'all just shut up?

513
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:29,793
Listen, we gotta work together, OK?

514
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:32,476
We never should've come out here.
Whose stupid idea was this?

515
00:34:32,516 --> 00:34:33,516
Chad!

516
00:34:36,999 --> 00:34:40,283
You guys are all a bunch of
fucking pussies, you know that?

517
00:34:40,323 --> 00:34:44,086
I mean, a few little tiny murders...

518
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:46,248
and everyone just freaks out.

519
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:49,571
But do you know how lucky you all are, huh?

520
00:34:49,612 --> 00:34:53,455
- Huh?
- What the fuck are you talking about, man?

521
00:34:53,496 --> 00:34:57,339
How many people do you think
get a chance for something like this?

522
00:34:58,259 --> 00:35:01,504
- The chance to die?
- The chance to live.

523
00:35:01,543 --> 00:35:05,866
To be free from people always
telling you what you can and can't do.

524
00:35:05,906 --> 00:35:09,269
There's no rules out here.
It's us against them.

525
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,474
And if you don't think
you can handle that, well...

526
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,597
maybe you deserve to die.

527
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,522
That's fucked up.

528
00:35:22,883 --> 00:35:26,206
Shh. Y'all hear that?

529
00:35:26,285 --> 00:35:28,848
Chuck got the police!
Come on, you guys, let's go!

530
00:35:28,888 --> 00:35:31,370
No, you don't need the fucking cops!

531
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,573
The cops aren't gonna help us, man.

532
00:35:35,895 --> 00:35:38,417
Don't you fucking idiots know anything?

533
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:40,459
Fuck.

534
00:35:45,063 --> 00:35:48,707
Now, don't you worry.
Your friends are probably fine.

535
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:51,148
Probably just a little misunderstanding,
that's all.

536
00:35:51,189 --> 00:35:52,832
Oh, God! Look out!

537
00:35:52,871 --> 00:35:54,992
- Help us! Help us!
- Chloe?

538
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:56,234
They're dead!

539
00:35:56,275 --> 00:35:57,635
They died!

540
00:35:57,675 --> 00:35:59,396
Slow down, now.

541
00:35:59,476 --> 00:36:01,598
- They killed them!
- OK.

542
00:36:01,638 --> 00:36:07,283
Stay calm. Well, why don't you kids climb
in the back seat, and we'll go have a look?

543
00:36:10,647 --> 00:36:12,849
Those stupid fucks.

544
00:36:17,854 --> 00:36:21,897
I don't think
I have the stomach for this, Tuck.

545
00:36:21,937 --> 00:36:25,061
I know.
He's jammed in there pretty good.

546
00:36:27,023 --> 00:36:29,865
- The store better not charge me for this!
- Yup.

547
00:36:29,905 --> 00:36:33,507
All right, look, I'm gonna wedge it from
that side, and you pull him out on three.

548
00:36:33,548 --> 00:36:34,669
- OK.
- All right?

549
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,633
One. Two. Three!

550
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:39,994
Argh!

551
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:43,837
- Oh, Tuck! Oh, take it off! Take it off me!
- OK, help me get it off.

552
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:46,961
Get it off me. Not on the face!

553
00:36:48,402 --> 00:36:49,723
Oh! I'm gonna barf.

554
00:36:50,965 --> 00:36:52,846
You're OK, you're OK.

555
00:36:52,886 --> 00:36:55,569
- Here, grab a leg. Grab a leg.
- OK.

556
00:36:55,608 --> 00:36:56,771
Get him over to the truck.

557
00:36:58,852 --> 00:37:01,335
Oh, God. Oh, God.

558
00:37:01,374 --> 00:37:03,496
- He's heavy for half a guy.
- Oh, God.

559
00:37:09,782 --> 00:37:11,624
Oh, shit.

560
00:37:16,588 --> 00:37:18,471
- Let me do the talking.
- That's a good idea.

561
00:37:20,673 --> 00:37:22,074
You kids stay put.

562
00:37:24,315 --> 00:37:25,917
I'll handle this.

563
00:37:27,317 --> 00:37:29,721
Hey.
Hello, Officer.

564
00:37:29,762 --> 00:37:31,683
- Good to see you again.
- Yeah.

565
00:37:34,005 --> 00:37:37,167
- We have had a doozy of a day.
- A real doozy.

566
00:37:37,207 --> 00:37:40,571
- Uh, there we were...
- Yup.

567
00:37:40,611 --> 00:37:42,773
- minding our own business...
- Yup.

568
00:37:42,813 --> 00:37:45,696
- making improvements to my house...
- The new house.

569
00:37:45,735 --> 00:37:47,857
..when, all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

570
00:37:47,897 --> 00:37:52,502
these kids started killing themselves
all over my property.

571
00:37:52,543 --> 00:37:55,904
This one right here, he dove headfirst
right into the wood chipper,

572
00:37:55,986 --> 00:37:57,186
the woody right back there.

573
00:37:57,227 --> 00:38:02,111
There's another one up over there
who shoved a spear through his gullet.

574
00:38:02,191 --> 00:38:03,312
Straight through.

575
00:38:03,352 --> 00:38:06,114
I don't know how much experience
you've had with this,

576
00:38:06,154 --> 00:38:09,477
- but we were scared shitless.
- Scared shitless.

577
00:38:17,284 --> 00:38:21,930
You must think that I'm some
kind of moron to believe a story like that.

578
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,531
- No...
- Oh, no.

579
00:38:23,572 --> 00:38:26,774
- No, sir.
- Not a moron, just...open-minded.

580
00:38:26,814 --> 00:38:31,018
Let me get this straight, cos I'm having
trouble understanding something.

581
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,262
- What?
- You say you were just working,

582
00:38:35,302 --> 00:38:41,227
when this...kid...ran up and stuffed
his head into that wood chipper?

583
00:38:41,267 --> 00:38:43,230
- That's a fact.
- That is a fact.

584
00:38:43,269 --> 00:38:48,874
And I think maybe they might be trying
to kill the girl that we have inside.

585
00:38:48,914 --> 00:38:50,315
- What girl?
- You know what?

586
00:38:50,356 --> 00:38:53,639
She can maybe explain
the whole thing if, uh...

587
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:56,482
if I hadn't have knocked her
unconscious with a shovel.

588
00:38:56,522 --> 00:38:58,883
- That's...
- On accident.

589
00:38:58,924 --> 00:38:59,965
On accident.

590
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:04,128
You've got another one inside,
and you say she's unconscious?

591
00:39:04,169 --> 00:39:07,131
- Yeah, she's in my bedroom.
- That's...

592
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:13,018
You better show me what you done with her.

593
00:39:13,057 --> 00:39:16,100
- Right this way. Let's show him.
- OK, I'm gonna put this leg down.

594
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,622
Great idea.
Why don't you go and show him?

595
00:39:19,663 --> 00:39:21,064
Wait, where is he going?

596
00:39:22,065 --> 00:39:24,668
- No, don't go in there.
- Right this way, Sheriff.

597
00:39:28,912 --> 00:39:30,553
What's he doing?

598
00:39:31,354 --> 00:39:33,036
Why doesn't he fucking arrest them?

599
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:42,805
Her eyes are equal, reactive to light.

600
00:39:45,047 --> 00:39:47,449
- At least she's not braindead.
- Oh, thank God.

601
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:51,693
I told you boys to stay away from this place,
but you just didn't listen, did you?

602
00:39:51,733 --> 00:39:54,976
Now, you're looking at least two counts
of involuntary manslaughter,

603
00:39:55,056 --> 00:39:57,018
but you'd be lucky to get that.

604
00:39:57,098 --> 00:40:01,101
Officer, do we look like
a couple of psycho killers to you?

605
00:40:03,104 --> 00:40:05,947
Well, it's...
it's hard to say.

606
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:08,589
Looks can be deceiving.

607
00:40:08,629 --> 00:40:09,950
Oh, don't!

608
00:40:13,073 --> 00:40:15,315
Sheriff! You OK?

609
00:40:17,798 --> 00:40:19,198
Oh, shit!

610
00:40:19,238 --> 00:40:21,801
Come on!
What is going on?

611
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,003
- How's he even walking, Tuck?
- He looks like he's gonna walk it off.

612
00:40:25,044 --> 00:40:26,525
He's gonna be fine.

613
00:40:32,251 --> 00:40:33,892
Don't worry, I got it.

614
00:40:36,254 --> 00:40:38,257
It's Sher... Sher...

615
00:40:39,858 --> 00:40:41,820
Oh, my God! They fucking killed him!

616
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:43,742
Unlock the door!

617
00:40:44,902 --> 00:40:48,466
God damn it, Tucker!
I told you we should have fixed that beam!

618
00:40:48,506 --> 00:40:52,189
You are not putting this on me!
Do you understand me? This is your fault.

619
00:40:52,229 --> 00:40:55,592
In there playing board games
with that little girl when I'm out working!

620
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:04,881
Unlock the fucking door!

621
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,604
If you hadn't been playing
board games with that little girl inside,

622
00:41:08,685 --> 00:41:11,488
we would have had
a little more time to fix the beam!

623
00:41:11,568 --> 00:41:12,608
Heads up.

624
00:41:12,689 --> 00:41:14,730
- Fuck you, you motherfuckers!
- No, no, no!

625
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:19,134
Oh, you got to take
the safety off on the side there.

626
00:41:21,697 --> 00:41:22,818
Don't do...

627
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:25,220
Jesus! Oh, God!

628
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:29,143
You've got to start being more careful!

629
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,511
I don't think he understands!

630
00:41:38,513 --> 00:41:39,993
Om.

631
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:41,916
"You gotta take the safety off"?

632
00:41:42,756 --> 00:41:47,280
You're something, Dale. None of this
would have happened if it wasn't for you!

633
00:41:47,321 --> 00:41:48,682
- What?
- That's right!

634
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:52,005
For being such a goddamn Good Samaritan!
"My God, she's drowning, Tucker.

635
00:41:52,086 --> 00:41:56,570
- "Oh, let's save her." Hell!
- Well, at least she's still alive.

636
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:59,571
- Oh, halle-fuckin'-lujah!
- Don't you dare blame this on her!

637
00:41:59,612 --> 00:42:02,816
I'm not blaming this on her,
I'm blaming this on you!

638
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:04,337
Well, you know what, Tucker?

639
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:08,260
None of this would have happened
if we hadn't have gone fishin'!

640
00:42:08,301 --> 00:42:10,943
- That isn't even an option.
- I don't even like fishin'!

641
00:42:10,982 --> 00:42:12,424
You don't like...

642
00:42:14,546 --> 00:42:17,869
- What do you mean, you don't like fishin'?
- I-I mean...

643
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:19,991
I like... I like it OK.

644
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,232
You know... I'm sorry.

645
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:25,956
I'm sorry, Tucker.
Did I hurt your feelings? I'm sorry.

646
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:29,560
Yeah, you kinda did.

647
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,923
Cut it out!

648
00:42:35,285 --> 00:42:36,527
Tucker...

649
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:39,129
where's Jangers?

650
00:42:42,372 --> 00:42:43,934
- Shit.
- Stay here.

651
00:42:44,935 --> 00:42:46,016
Aah! Damn.

652
00:42:47,297 --> 00:42:48,857
Nuts...

653
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,902
Hey, hillbilly! Your move.

654
00:42:52,942 --> 00:42:54,503
Oh, son of a bitch!

655
00:42:54,543 --> 00:42:56,906
- They got my dog.
- Shit!

656
00:42:56,945 --> 00:42:59,067
We gotta do something.

657
00:42:59,108 --> 00:43:02,551
- Did you bring that nail gun in here?
- Yeah. Why?

658
00:43:04,032 --> 00:43:06,155
Stay low. Stay low to the ground.
Keep your hat!

659
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:13,881
Oh.

660
00:43:13,921 --> 00:43:15,643
All right.

661
00:43:16,604 --> 00:43:18,686
- Cover me.
- Uh...

662
00:43:18,727 --> 00:43:20,767
I ain't never shot at nobody before.

663
00:43:21,688 --> 00:43:25,532
If it helps,
think of 'em like moving two-by-fours.

664
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:27,214
Whoa!

665
00:43:28,215 --> 00:43:31,338
- Whoa!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

666
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:33,379
Now, you create a distraction.

667
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,622
I'm gonna go out the back door.

668
00:43:36,663 --> 00:43:38,905
- And, Dale...
- Yeah.

669
00:43:38,945 --> 00:43:40,065
Try not to shoot me.

670
00:43:41,387 --> 00:43:42,948
- OK, I'll try.
- All right.

671
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:46,632
- What the fuck is taking so long?
- I don't know.

672
00:43:49,114 --> 00:43:51,557
Hey, college kids! You want some of this?

673
00:44:12,136 --> 00:44:15,378
Ha-ha! You like that, college kids?
How's that taste?

674
00:44:15,418 --> 00:44:19,022
I got plenty more where that came from!
Bunch of freaks!

675
00:44:23,586 --> 00:44:24,908
Shit!

676
00:44:32,955 --> 00:44:36,358
Jesus, Dale.
Take it easy.

677
00:44:36,398 --> 00:44:37,440
Hey, hillbilly!

678
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,004
You shoot at us again, and your dog's dead!

679
00:44:42,844 --> 00:44:46,608
If you kill my dog,
I swear to God, I'll get really mad!

680
00:44:46,648 --> 00:44:47,889
Then bring out the girl!

681
00:44:51,973 --> 00:44:54,536
I'm gonna shoot your dog!

682
00:44:54,576 --> 00:44:56,057
I'm gonna get really mad!

683
00:44:56,097 --> 00:44:57,578
I'll get really mad!

684
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:02,583
Go home. Go!
No, you're going the wrong way, shithead!

685
00:45:06,947 --> 00:45:08,908
Oh!

686
00:45:08,948 --> 00:45:11,191
It is a beautiful day for a run, isn't it?

687
00:46:10,486 --> 00:46:12,168
Oh, God. Please, no.

688
00:46:20,495 --> 00:46:21,736
Are we done yet?

689
00:46:21,816 --> 00:46:25,060
I don't know, Naomi, is it covered?
We may only get one chance at this.

690
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,542
All right...trap's set.

691
00:46:29,184 --> 00:46:31,906
Hey...he's awake.

692
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:37,672
What the hell is wrong with you kids?

693
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:40,193
What is the matter with us?

694
00:46:40,233 --> 00:46:41,355
- Hold him steady.
- Yeah.

695
00:46:41,395 --> 00:46:43,317
Wait. Stop...

696
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,683
I've never stood so close
to pure evil before.

697
00:46:54,046 --> 00:46:58,170
- It kind of stinks.
- It was supposed to be 24-hour protection...

698
00:46:58,251 --> 00:46:59,732
OK! Don't...

699
00:46:59,811 --> 00:47:04,336
No, look, I know you kids are having fun,
but I am not a thrill-seeker!

700
00:47:04,416 --> 00:47:07,060
It's payback time, hillbilly.

701
00:47:07,819 --> 00:47:12,343
Payback... All right, look.
Just let me go... Just let me go.

702
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,185
I can get my cooler.

703
00:47:14,946 --> 00:47:17,669
Hey, I got 10 to 12 beers in there.

704
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:21,192
They're yours.
They're on ice right now, man!

705
00:47:22,192 --> 00:47:24,315
- This is for Mike!
- No!

706
00:47:27,837 --> 00:47:30,600
OW! You prick.

707
00:47:37,527 --> 00:47:38,930
- Dale?
- Allison.

708
00:47:39,689 --> 00:47:41,491
How are you feelin'?

709
00:47:43,253 --> 00:47:45,735
- A little fuzzy.
- Yeah.

710
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:48,817
Wha...

711
00:47:49,938 --> 00:47:51,221
What happ...

712
00:47:51,261 --> 00:47:52,981
- What happened?
- Oh...

713
00:47:54,824 --> 00:47:55,945
Well, uh...

714
00:47:57,345 --> 00:47:59,508
I can't...
I can't really say.

715
00:47:59,547 --> 00:48:00,589
Um...

716
00:48:02,711 --> 00:48:04,112
It was so awful.

717
00:48:06,034 --> 00:48:08,396
Oh, my God.
I'm embarrassed. I'm sorry.

718
00:48:08,436 --> 00:48:11,078
- I can't cry in front of a girl, God damn it.
- That's OK.

719
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,321
It's good to cry sometimes.

720
00:48:13,361 --> 00:48:15,322
It's OK, just...

721
00:48:15,363 --> 00:48:17,003
Just let it out. It's OK, all right?

722
00:48:20,166 --> 00:48:22,730
There you go. It'll feel better.

723
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:27,974
Come on, just take a deep breath.

724
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:34,781
There we go. Now...

725
00:48:36,061 --> 00:48:37,463
Now tell me what happened.

726
00:48:39,024 --> 00:48:41,948
Well...it's hard to say.

727
00:48:41,987 --> 00:48:43,149
Um...

728
00:48:45,111 --> 00:48:46,312
Your friends...

729
00:48:47,433 --> 00:48:49,994
Do some of your friends take medication?

730
00:48:50,795 --> 00:48:53,438
- Why?
- Because I think they forgot to take it.

731
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,162
What are you talking about?
What... Where are they?

732
00:48:58,242 --> 00:49:02,046
They're out there somewhere right now
tryin' to kill my best friend...and my dog.

733
00:49:02,086 --> 00:49:04,529
- I don't understand what you're talking...
- I know.

734
00:49:04,569 --> 00:49:07,011
It doesn't make any sense.
That's what the truth is.

735
00:49:07,051 --> 00:49:10,174
It's like all your friends just
decided to go nuts all at the same time.

736
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:14,377
The last thing I remember, I saw...
I saw Chad and...

737
00:49:14,417 --> 00:49:18,821
and then Todd was running at us, and...

738
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:22,745
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

739
00:49:22,785 --> 00:49:24,988
At first I thought they
were trying to kill you,

740
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:30,031
and then they started killing themselves
and then they tried to kill us,

741
00:49:30,072 --> 00:49:32,194
and now they're going after my dog...

742
00:49:32,274 --> 00:49:33,675
..Jangers.

743
00:49:33,754 --> 00:49:35,797
I guess they just like killing.

744
00:49:35,837 --> 00:49:39,120
No, there must be some kind of mistake.
My friends would never hurt anyone.

745
00:49:39,201 --> 00:49:40,843
Jesus, they're here!

746
00:49:40,882 --> 00:49:43,964
They're not gonna stop till they kill
all of us, I'm telling you. Hide!

747
00:49:44,005 --> 00:49:46,488
Dale, it's OK. Nobody wants to hurt you.

748
00:49:46,528 --> 00:49:48,930
- Die, hillbilly!
- It sure sounds like someone does.

749
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:51,291
I'm gonna go talk to them, OK?
Just stay there.

750
00:49:51,332 --> 00:49:54,334
- What? No, no.
- It's all just a big misunderstanding.

751
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:56,217
We'll clear it right up, OK?

752
00:49:56,256 --> 00:49:59,180
Allison, don't go out there!
You don't know what it's like out there.

753
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:04,543
Oh, my God.

754
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:12,952
- Ugh!
- Allison!

755
00:50:20,479 --> 00:50:22,040
Oh!

756
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:34,412
Did you see them?

757
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:38,656
- No.
- No?

758
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,381
That's from Tucker's shirt.

759
00:50:46,423 --> 00:50:48,386
What is that?

760
00:50:48,425 --> 00:50:49,786
Oh, my God!

761
00:50:49,826 --> 00:50:52,469
Oh, my God!
They cut off his bowlin' fingers!

762
00:50:54,791 --> 00:50:56,392
There's a note right there.

763
00:51:08,003 --> 00:51:11,807
"Now we got your friend. Try and get him!"

764
00:51:13,688 --> 00:51:16,772
Dale, how...
how long was I out for?

765
00:51:17,452 --> 00:51:18,813
A few hours.

766
00:51:18,854 --> 00:51:20,496
I don't understand what...

767
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,976
I gotta go help Tucker.

768
00:51:22,017 --> 00:51:23,378
God damn it.

769
00:51:24,699 --> 00:51:26,901
My best friend needs me.
I'm gonna get these kids.

770
00:51:26,981 --> 00:51:30,945
- Wait. We don't want to escalate things.
- We don't want to escalate things?

771
00:51:30,985 --> 00:51:33,547
No. They must have thought
you were trying to harm me.

772
00:51:33,587 --> 00:51:35,508
Oh, and why would they think that?

773
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:39,713
I... I don't know.

774
00:51:40,473 --> 00:51:41,796
I think you do know.

775
00:51:41,835 --> 00:51:46,199
Well, when we first saw you guys
back at that store...

776
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,562
we just thought that you looked...

777
00:51:50,602 --> 00:51:52,445
a little creepy.

778
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:55,528
I was nervous.
I don't know how to talk to girls, and I...

779
00:51:55,568 --> 00:51:57,449
Dale, I know that now, but we didn't then.

780
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,611
You thought I looked
like some kind of freak.

781
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:02,335
We misjudged you, Dale. I...

782
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:05,818
I'm really sorry.

783
00:52:05,857 --> 00:52:07,579
Don't be sorry. It's my fault.

784
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:12,263
I should have known that if
a guy like me talked to a girl like you,

785
00:52:12,343 --> 00:52:13,865
somebody'd end up dead.

786
00:52:14,786 --> 00:52:17,028
Dale, it's... Dale, it's not like that.

787
00:52:17,068 --> 00:52:19,470
If you do see your friends...

788
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:22,232
tell 'em that I never
wanted to hurt anybody.

789
00:52:23,354 --> 00:52:25,796
Dale, Dale, stop. Wait. No...

790
00:52:25,836 --> 00:52:26,996
Don't go there.

791
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,322
Oh, shit.

792
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:33,723
Tucker!

793
00:52:36,085 --> 00:52:38,247
Tucker, you cut there?

794
00:52:45,294 --> 00:52:46,255
Tuck!

795
00:53:06,594 --> 00:53:08,676
Oh, goddamn stupid college kids.

796
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,521
Tucker!

797
00:53:14,561 --> 00:53:17,084
- Dale!
- I'm comin' for you, buddy!

798
00:53:18,485 --> 00:53:19,846
Tucker?!

799
00:53:19,886 --> 00:53:21,767
Yeah.

800
00:53:21,807 --> 00:53:23,370
Tuck! Tucker!

801
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:26,573
- Dale...
- Hey!

802
00:53:27,533 --> 00:53:28,935
- Tucker.
- Dale, it's a trap.

803
00:53:29,615 --> 00:53:31,417
- It's a what?
- It's a trap.

804
00:53:31,498 --> 00:53:32,778
What?

805
00:53:33,779 --> 00:53:35,140
Oh, no. Oh, no! Tuck, no!

806
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,580
I don't wanna die! Please!

807
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:40,346
Oh, God! Tucker!

808
00:53:40,386 --> 00:53:41,747
Dale...

809
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:47,513
Oh. Oh... Oh...

810
00:53:48,354 --> 00:53:49,634
I never thought I'd say this,

811
00:53:49,674 --> 00:53:51,396
but I'm glad I'm not hung like a bear.

812
00:53:51,435 --> 00:53:54,478
That's funny.

813
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:56,320
Whoa...

814
00:53:58,042 --> 00:53:59,604
- Oh...
- Dale...

815
00:53:59,644 --> 00:54:03,086
that kid, he's got some serious issues.

816
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:05,369
I know. Let's get you down from there.

817
00:54:05,449 --> 00:54:07,410
Wait!

818
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:08,773
Sorry about that.

819
00:54:08,852 --> 00:54:10,454
This vacation sucks.

820
00:54:11,935 --> 00:54:13,536
Come on, let's go.

821
00:54:31,874 --> 00:54:33,635
Look at this place.

822
00:54:34,636 --> 00:54:38,880
- This is where evil lives.
- Let's just hope that Allison's still alive.

823
00:54:41,243 --> 00:54:42,444
Allison!

824
00:54:42,483 --> 00:54:43,965
- Allison!
- Chad?

825
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:46,728
- Chad?
- Shh!

826
00:54:46,767 --> 00:54:47,928
What are you guys doing?

827
00:54:48,008 --> 00:54:49,770
Saving you, stupid!
Come on. Let's go.

828
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:52,893
Why are you whispering?
There's no one else here.

829
00:54:54,094 --> 00:54:55,335
Oh.

830
00:54:58,498 --> 00:55:00,339
This place is really freaky.

831
00:55:00,379 --> 00:55:02,942
What have they done to you, Allie?
Huh?

832
00:55:02,982 --> 00:55:05,064
They haven't done anything to me.

833
00:55:05,105 --> 00:55:07,266
Chad, this has all been
a huge misunderstanding.

834
00:55:07,307 --> 00:55:11,189
We have to burn this place to the ground.
Destroy it completely.

835
00:55:11,229 --> 00:55:13,552
What? No, no. Chad...

836
00:55:14,153 --> 00:55:15,554
Chad! Stop.

837
00:55:16,435 --> 00:55:18,277
No, Chad, no. Chad, stop!

838
00:55:19,758 --> 00:55:23,202
You can't do this.
This is their vacation home.

839
00:55:23,242 --> 00:55:25,042
You guys have to listen to me, OK?

840
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:29,486
Tucker and Dale did not mean
to hurt anyone. They're really nice.

841
00:55:29,527 --> 00:55:31,449
You have no idea...

842
00:55:31,489 --> 00:55:34,692
what this is all about, do you, Allison?

843
00:55:34,732 --> 00:55:36,454
- Huh?
- No.

844
00:55:38,055 --> 00:55:40,777
These freaks are evil...

845
00:55:41,618 --> 00:55:44,462
and they deserve everything
that's coming to them.

846
00:55:44,502 --> 00:55:46,583
OK, just relax, all right?

847
00:55:46,622 --> 00:55:49,946
I'm just trying to explain
this is all a big misunderstanding.

848
00:55:49,986 --> 00:55:52,828
Tucker and Dale have been nothing
but gentlemen to me this entire time,

849
00:55:52,869 --> 00:55:55,992
- while you guys have been terrorizing them.
- But they started this!

850
00:55:56,033 --> 00:55:58,994
By doing what? Saving my life?

851
00:56:00,036 --> 00:56:03,718
Wait a minute. I remember reading
about this in my sociology class.

852
00:56:03,798 --> 00:56:05,361
It's called Stockholm syndrome.

853
00:56:05,401 --> 00:56:08,203
When someone who's been kidnapped
falls in love with their kidnapper.

854
00:56:11,045 --> 00:56:12,406
You're falling in love with him?

855
00:56:12,447 --> 00:56:14,689
No. W-What?

856
00:56:14,729 --> 00:56:18,413
- Chad, the... The what? This is...
- Tell me...

857
00:56:18,452 --> 00:56:23,016
you're not falling in love
with that freak, Allison.

858
00:56:24,378 --> 00:56:26,140
How could you love him?

859
00:56:27,741 --> 00:56:29,983
Chad, please. You don't understand.

860
00:56:30,023 --> 00:56:32,746
Well, are you or are you not
in love with him?

861
00:56:32,786 --> 00:56:34,507
- What is the matter with you?
- Tell me!

862
00:56:35,508 --> 00:56:38,872
Hey! Let the girl go.

863
00:56:39,352 --> 00:56:40,313
Tcha!

864
00:56:41,595 --> 00:56:45,277
- Are you OK, Allie?
- Allie? Did he just call you Allie?

865
00:56:45,357 --> 00:56:49,322
Wait. Everyone just stop for a second
and let's talk this out, OK?

866
00:56:49,361 --> 00:56:51,643
Nobody wants to hurt anyone.

867
00:56:51,683 --> 00:56:53,765
You could have fooled me.

868
00:56:53,805 --> 00:56:56,247
- Fuck off, hillbilly.
- Eat shit, body perm.

869
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:59,131
Wait! How about I make some tea,

870
00:56:59,171 --> 00:57:01,933
and we all sit and talk this out?

871
00:57:01,972 --> 00:57:06,337
Oh, yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
I'll provide the finger sandwiches.

872
00:57:07,418 --> 00:57:08,980
I'm gonna go get a beer.

873
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:12,583
OK, Chad, you...sit here, OK?

874
00:57:12,623 --> 00:57:14,745
In this chair.

875
00:57:14,825 --> 00:57:16,346
Dale, you...

876
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,990
you sit in this one.

877
00:57:26,196 --> 00:57:28,599
OK, good. Now, um...

878
00:57:29,439 --> 00:57:30,921
I'm gonna get the tea.

879
00:57:34,123 --> 00:57:37,406
Is that camomile tea? I can't have that.
It fucks with my asthma.

880
00:57:37,446 --> 00:57:39,008
It's Earl Grey.

881
00:57:39,047 --> 00:57:41,091
Oh, I love Earl Grey. That's great.

882
00:57:43,492 --> 00:57:47,896
Here's what we're gonna do.
I want you each to tell your side of the story,

883
00:57:47,936 --> 00:57:54,182
and as you're listening to the other person,
I want you to see yourself in their shoes.

884
00:57:54,222 --> 00:57:55,262
OK?

885
00:57:57,705 --> 00:57:58,786
OK.

886
00:57:58,865 --> 00:58:01,229
Now, it's important
that we communicate our feelings

887
00:58:01,309 --> 00:58:05,032
and understand each ether's perspective
before any progress can be made.

888
00:58:07,914 --> 00:58:08,915
OK.

889
00:58:09,276 --> 00:58:10,758
Chad, why don't you start?

890
00:58:12,279 --> 00:58:15,962
- Well, where should I fucking begin?
- Wherever you'd like.

891
00:58:16,843 --> 00:58:18,645
A long time ago,

892
00:58:18,685 --> 00:58:21,809
- before I was born...
- OK, maybe not that far back.

893
00:58:21,849 --> 00:58:23,490
This is important.

894
00:58:26,331 --> 00:58:30,055
You see, my parents, they were attacked
by hillbillies just like him.

895
00:58:32,299 --> 00:58:34,580
It was 20 years ago.

896
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,341
The Memorial Day Massacre.

897
00:58:38,263 --> 00:58:41,586
They brutally murdered everyone.
Just for fun.

898
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:45,070
My mother ran for her life.

899
00:58:45,109 --> 00:58:46,511
But they captured hen.

900
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,040
My father was helpless...

901
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:00,604
and he didn't even know
that she was pregnant with me yet.

902
00:59:02,966 --> 00:59:04,728
And they forced him to watch...

903
00:59:05,929 --> 00:59:07,890
while they tortured hen.

904
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,775
But my mom, she fought back...

905
00:59:14,858 --> 00:59:16,740
..and she escaped.

906
00:59:17,861 --> 00:59:20,102
But my father wasn't so lucky.

907
00:59:24,787 --> 00:59:27,029
His body was never found.

908
00:59:34,075 --> 00:59:36,197
By the time I was born...

909
00:59:36,238 --> 00:59:38,919
my mother was already institutionalized.

910
00:59:39,841 --> 00:59:43,043
I grew up hearing that story
from my grandmother.

911
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:51,892
OK. Um...

912
00:59:53,773 --> 00:59:56,055
Thank you for sharing with us, Chad.

913
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:12,512
- No, I'm not going in there!
- Hey, hey, hey.

914
01:00:12,551 --> 01:00:16,034
Now, Chad said if they were
gone longer than 15 minutes,

915
01:00:16,074 --> 01:00:17,796
we come in, guns blazing.

916
01:00:17,836 --> 01:00:22,480
- But you don't even have a gun.
- Damn it, woman! Don't argue with me!

917
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:37,253
Are they drinking tea? Oh!
I would totally love a cup of tea right now.

918
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:39,616
No!

919
01:00:39,656 --> 01:00:40,897
No way.

920
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:43,019
They're fucking trapped.

921
01:00:43,059 --> 01:00:45,381
Oh...yeah.

922
01:00:45,421 --> 01:00:48,304
Now, come on, we gotta do something.

923
01:00:51,628 --> 01:00:52,668
It's your turn.

924
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:56,152
OK, well...

925
01:00:57,352 --> 01:00:58,673
First of all...

926
01:01:00,396 --> 01:01:04,079
I am really sorry
that your family got massacred.

927
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,321
That is awful.

928
01:01:06,441 --> 01:01:10,646
Secondly...
I didn't have anything to do with that, OK?

929
01:01:10,686 --> 01:01:14,489
I mean, I would have been six years old
at the time, so...

930
01:01:14,569 --> 01:01:17,692
It may not have been you,
but it was definitely your kind.

931
01:01:17,732 --> 01:01:22,136
My kind? Now, hey, I can't even hurt a fish,
can I, Tucker? I can't even hurt fish.

932
01:01:22,176 --> 01:01:25,378
That's right.
He can't even hurt a fish.

933
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,220
I just can't do it!

934
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:31,265
OK. S-So now that you've both
expressed your side of the story,

935
01:01:31,305 --> 01:01:33,587
how do you feel?

936
01:01:33,627 --> 01:01:36,309
I feel better. I feel...

937
01:01:36,349 --> 01:01:38,431
I feel like a weight... Yeah, I feel good.

938
01:01:39,392 --> 01:01:42,796
Great. OK.
We're really making good progress.

939
01:01:44,396 --> 01:01:46,679
It's show time, freaks!

940
01:01:47,319 --> 01:01:49,442
Jason! No!

941
01:01:51,764 --> 01:01:52,764
Jesus Christ!

942
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:58,890
Oh, shit, baby! Why didn't you duck?
Why didn't she duck?

943
01:02:00,051 --> 01:02:01,492
Chad, st...

944
01:02:02,133 --> 01:02:03,415
Get him, Tucker!

945
01:02:05,296 --> 01:02:06,297
Dale!

946
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,821
Go back to hell where you belong, freak!

947
01:02:11,382 --> 01:02:13,223
- Oh, shit!
- Whoa!

948
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:15,425
Shit! Chad, what the fuck?

949
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:16,987
- Be calm. It's just the leg.
- Stop and roll.

950
01:02:17,028 --> 01:02:18,748
- I'm on fire!
- No, don't use that.

951
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:21,351
Aargh!

952
01:02:23,312 --> 01:02:24,354
Aargh!

953
01:02:24,434 --> 01:02:25,635
Stop, drop, and roll!

954
01:02:27,117 --> 01:02:28,918
- Get away from him!
- Stomp it out!

955
01:02:34,844 --> 01:02:37,046
He's crackling like a log!

956
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,327
Oh, that stinks.

957
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:43,171
- Oh, shit!
- I knew I shoulda moved that.

958
01:02:47,856 --> 01:02:49,457
Allie, run!
Run!

959
01:02:49,497 --> 01:02:50,498
Come on, let's go!

960
01:02:51,658 --> 01:02:53,580
Help me!

961
01:02:53,621 --> 01:02:55,584
Get off of me, you nasty bitch!

962
01:03:05,511 --> 01:03:06,914
My cabin.

963
01:03:07,835 --> 01:03:09,316
Your cabin.

964
01:03:10,317 --> 01:03:11,798
I'm a terrible therapist.

965
01:03:11,878 --> 01:03:14,840
What? No, that's not true.
Don't say that.

966
01:03:14,881 --> 01:03:17,164
I thought you did a great job in there.

967
01:03:17,203 --> 01:03:19,244
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

968
01:03:20,446 --> 01:03:23,128
I think we were
on the verge of a breakthrough.

969
01:03:24,489 --> 01:03:26,130
Thanks, Dale. That's really sweet.

970
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:28,254
- Uh, guys?
- Yeah.

971
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:34,218
I think we should go
to the pickup truck right now.

972
01:03:34,259 --> 01:03:35,980
Wait. Maybe we should help him.

973
01:03:39,184 --> 01:03:41,106
- Argh!
- Never mind. Let's just go.

974
01:03:41,146 --> 01:03:42,947
Get to the truck!

975
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:45,188
Tucker! Tucker!

976
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:48,512
He's coming!

977
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:52,916
- OK, come on, truck. Come on, truck.
- Come on, Dale. Go, go!

978
01:03:52,956 --> 01:03:55,438
- Do not flood it.
- Do you wanna drive?!

979
01:03:55,479 --> 01:03:57,360
- Guys, just go!
- Be careful with this.

980
01:03:57,401 --> 01:03:59,443
This is the only thing I got left.

981
01:04:01,124 --> 01:04:02,125
Go.

982
01:04:06,608 --> 01:04:10,253
Oh!
Crazy college kid can't catch us now!

983
01:04:10,293 --> 01:04:11,774
- Dale, look out!
- Huh?

984
01:04:26,427 --> 01:04:28,469
Jangers, not now, boy.

985
01:04:28,549 --> 01:04:31,393
Jangers, hey!

986
01:04:33,154 --> 01:04:34,836
Whoa. Jangers!

987
01:04:36,317 --> 01:04:37,438
Allie.

988
01:04:38,279 --> 01:04:39,760
Allison!

989
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:42,804
Jangers... Allison!

990
01:04:43,723 --> 01:04:44,924
She's gone.

991
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:47,527
What the hell... Tucker?

992
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:53,813
Tucker, what happened?
Tucker, what hap...

993
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:56,855
He took her.

994
01:04:56,896 --> 01:04:58,698
I tried to stop him.

995
01:04:58,738 --> 01:05:02,101
Whoa, take it easy.

996
01:05:02,142 --> 01:05:03,383
I tell you something, Dale.

997
01:05:03,462 --> 01:05:05,905
It's gonna be a long time
before I take a vacation again.

998
01:05:05,984 --> 01:05:09,707
Oh, shit. Tucker, this is all my fault.

999
01:05:11,068 --> 01:05:12,431
- Look at you.
- Nah.

1000
01:05:12,471 --> 01:05:16,075
I never should have talked to Allison.
You were right.

1001
01:05:16,114 --> 01:05:18,156
People like me and people like her
just don't mix.

1002
01:05:18,196 --> 01:05:20,277
- That's not true.
- It is true!

1003
01:05:20,318 --> 01:05:22,960
I never should have even
came out here with you.

1004
01:05:23,001 --> 01:05:25,083
Listen to me.

1005
01:05:27,725 --> 01:05:29,846
Do you remember when we was kids...

1006
01:05:30,967 --> 01:05:33,170
and we used to go catch frogs
down at that creek?

1007
01:05:33,211 --> 01:05:35,132
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do.

1008
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:40,336
Remember how we used to compete
to see who could catch more?

1009
01:05:40,376 --> 01:05:43,579
Yeah, but I don't think now's
the time to talk about it, Tucker.

1010
01:05:43,619 --> 01:05:48,184
And I used to tell you that I let you catch
more than me because I felt sorry for you.

1011
01:05:48,223 --> 01:05:51,026
I remember you used
to let me lick 'em all, too.

1012
01:05:51,066 --> 01:05:53,108
That always made me feel kinda funny.

1013
01:05:53,147 --> 01:05:55,390
Yeah. Well, the thing is...

1014
01:05:56,751 --> 01:05:58,594
I didn't let you catch more.

1015
01:05:59,514 --> 01:06:01,836
You caught 'em on your own.
You was quicker than I was.

1016
01:06:01,876 --> 01:06:03,839
- Come on, Tucker.
- It's true.

1017
01:06:03,878 --> 01:06:09,003
What I'm trying to tell you...
is that you're better than you think you are.

1018
01:06:10,084 --> 01:06:12,365
Listen to me. That girl sees it.

1019
01:06:13,367 --> 01:06:16,891
I've seen the way that the two of you
look at each other.

1020
01:06:19,372 --> 01:06:20,934
You know, I think that she...

1021
01:06:21,975 --> 01:06:23,816
really sees you for who you are.

1022
01:06:25,338 --> 01:06:27,540
Who knows?
Maybe after this is all done...

1023
01:06:28,701 --> 01:06:29,943
you two can...

1024
01:06:30,863 --> 01:06:33,025
_.date or something.

1025
01:06:33,065 --> 01:06:36,990
- I doubt it.
- Dude, that's what I'm talking about.

1026
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,751
I don't want any more negativity.

1027
01:06:40,072 --> 01:06:41,514
- OK.
- Stop it!

1028
01:06:41,554 --> 01:06:43,835
- OK.
- You are a good man.

1029
01:06:44,757 --> 01:06:46,037
You're smart...

1030
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:48,480
and you're strong...

1031
01:06:49,481 --> 01:06:51,723
and you're not as ugly
as you think you are.

1032
01:06:51,764 --> 01:06:55,766
Thank you, Tucker.
That means a lot comin' from you.

1033
01:06:55,806 --> 01:06:58,410
- Life is short.
- I know.

1034
01:07:00,051 --> 01:07:03,374
You gotta go after what you want.
Go after her, Dale.

1035
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:06,096
She needs you now more than ever,

1036
01:07:06,136 --> 01:07:10,381
especially cos she's always falling down
and hitting her head, knocking herself out.

1037
01:07:10,421 --> 01:07:14,183
- But I don't even know where he took her.
- Jangers'll know.

1038
01:07:16,747 --> 01:07:20,430
- OK, but I'm not leaving you here.
- No, no, no.

1039
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:23,032
I'll be fine. Go.

1040
01:07:28,557 --> 01:07:31,160
- Friends forever?
- Best friends forever.

1041
01:07:33,521 --> 01:07:34,642
Oh, Jesus!

1042
01:07:34,723 --> 01:07:36,284
- God! Fuck...
- I'm sorry.

1043
01:07:36,325 --> 01:07:37,886
OK.

1044
01:07:40,368 --> 01:07:41,930
That hurt very much!

1045
01:07:42,011 --> 01:07:44,172
I could tell. Just breathe in.

1046
01:07:44,212 --> 01:07:45,613
Out through your mouth.

1047
01:07:45,653 --> 01:07:47,495
Go get her. Go get her.

1048
01:07:49,096 --> 01:07:50,859
- Do me a favour.
- Anything.

1049
01:07:50,899 --> 01:07:53,861
Kick the shit out of that little
college dickhead for me, would you?

1050
01:07:53,901 --> 01:07:57,344
I'm gonna shove my boot down
his fuckin' throat. You stay here, OK?

1051
01:07:57,384 --> 01:07:58,826
Come on, Jangers, let's go.

1052
01:08:18,963 --> 01:08:21,046
Good boy, Jangers. Good boy.

1053
01:08:21,126 --> 01:08:24,609
OK. (Pants) You gotta let me
take it from here, OK, pup?

1054
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:27,652
Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doing.

1055
01:08:27,693 --> 01:08:29,615
More or less. OK, stay.

1056
01:08:34,419 --> 01:08:35,980
What is the matter with you?

1057
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,342
What is the matter with me?

1058
01:08:38,382 --> 01:08:42,666
Do you have any idea what
I've been through trying to save you?

1059
01:08:42,705 --> 01:08:43,708
No.

1060
01:08:44,628 --> 01:08:46,549
You've gone hillbilly on me, Allison.

1061
01:08:47,751 --> 01:08:49,752
Now, I'm willing to forgive you...

1062
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:51,755
but you're gonna have to beg.

1063
01:08:52,716 --> 01:08:53,757
Chad...

1064
01:08:56,839 --> 01:08:58,080
Oh!

1065
01:08:59,041 --> 01:09:01,684
That was just not a very nice apology kiss.

1066
01:09:01,724 --> 01:09:04,287
You see, we're making up, Allie,

1067
01:09:04,327 --> 01:09:06,289
so you have to be
more passionate than that!

1068
01:09:06,329 --> 01:09:07,850
- Chad, please...
- That's a start.

1069
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:09,411
- Please...
- You're getting warmer.

1070
01:09:09,451 --> 01:09:10,732
Just stop, please!

1071
01:09:10,773 --> 01:09:13,174
No. I'm not gonna stop.

1072
01:09:13,214 --> 01:09:15,177
I've only just begun.

1073
01:09:38,119 --> 01:09:41,562
You want a killer hillbilly?
I'll show you a killer hillbilly.

1074
01:10:02,941 --> 01:10:04,623
Allie! Allie! Hey, it's just me. Hey...

1075
01:10:04,662 --> 01:10:06,024
- It's OK.
- Dale?

1076
01:10:06,063 --> 01:10:07,706
- Yeah.
- What are you wearing?

1077
01:10:07,746 --> 01:10:10,949
What? Oh, I thought it might look
kind of intimidating. Does it?

1078
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:13,712
- Yeah.
- Sweet.

1079
01:10:15,112 --> 01:10:17,996
Dale, you wanna...
you wanna help me here?

1080
01:10:18,076 --> 01:10:19,717
Oh, yeah. Hang on, I'm comin'.

1081
01:10:20,997 --> 01:10:22,079
Hang on.

1082
01:10:24,481 --> 01:10:27,644
- OK, what do we got here?
- Thank you for coming for me.

1083
01:10:27,684 --> 01:10:30,807
It's no big deal.
I was headed over this way anyway, so...

1084
01:10:38,053 --> 01:10:39,816
How sweet.

1085
01:10:39,856 --> 01:10:44,500
The dim-witted hillbilly
is trying to save the girl of his dreams.

1086
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:45,821
What kind of knot is this?

1087
01:10:45,861 --> 01:10:48,503
You think you're gonna win,
but you're wrong.

1088
01:10:49,424 --> 01:10:52,067
It's time to say goodbye to the girl.

1089
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:54,189
You shouldn't have betrayed me, Allison.

1090
01:10:58,473 --> 01:11:00,636
No. Oh, jeez. No, no!

1091
01:11:00,675 --> 01:11:02,236
- Oh, Dale! Dale!
- OK. OK.

1092
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,281
- OK, OK.
- Dale!

1093
01:11:07,321 --> 01:11:10,163
Hold on! OK, rabbit comes out the tree,
rabbit goes around the tree...

1094
01:11:10,203 --> 01:11:12,166
- Dale, come on!
- OK! Jesus, OK!

1095
01:11:21,615 --> 01:11:23,417
Oh, that is really too bad.

1096
01:11:23,457 --> 01:11:27,821
Are you OK, huh?
Because I didn't mean to...

1097
01:11:32,825 --> 01:11:33,786
Dale!

1098
01:11:52,483 --> 01:11:54,725
Dale!

1099
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:01,251
Dale!

1100
01:12:12,742 --> 01:12:14,905
It's time for you to feel my pain.

1101
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:17,466
Bring it, frat bitch.

1102
01:12:39,608 --> 01:12:43,491
- Dale, over here!
- Come on! Let's get outta here.

1103
01:12:45,733 --> 01:12:48,536
Come on. Come on. Here! Come on!

1104
01:12:48,616 --> 01:12:51,698
Go! Go, get up there.
Go. Come on. Quick, quick, quick.

1105
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:55,663
- Dale, here!
- Oh, yeah, give me that.

1106
01:12:56,983 --> 01:12:58,265
Put a couple boxes on there.

1107
01:12:58,305 --> 01:13:01,748
Oh, Jesus H Christ!
That kid is tough as nails.

1108
01:13:01,787 --> 01:13:03,749
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1109
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:07,193
- OK. OK.
- Looks like no one's been here for a while.

1110
01:13:07,234 --> 01:13:10,075
Yeah. What we need to find
is some kind of weapon,

1111
01:13:10,116 --> 01:13:13,398
something preferably big and sharp
so I can stab him!

1112
01:13:13,438 --> 01:13:14,800
Nah! Shit...

1113
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:17,963
Oh, hey! This might work, huh?

1114
01:13:18,003 --> 01:13:19,004
Or not.

1115
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:28,292
Oh, my God. Dale?

1116
01:13:28,333 --> 01:13:30,415
- What?
- Come here and look at this.

1117
01:13:33,497 --> 01:13:34,498
Look.

1118
01:13:34,538 --> 01:13:36,540
- What?
- Something look familiar?

1119
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:40,184
- Hey, ain't that that dead Sheriff right there?
- No, that picture.

1120
01:13:40,224 --> 01:13:43,387
- Look at the guy in the middle.
- Oh, yeah.

1121
01:13:43,427 --> 01:13:46,469
He looks just like that
Kentucky fried college kid down there.

1122
01:13:46,509 --> 01:13:48,231
- Yeah.
- That's funny.

1123
01:13:48,271 --> 01:13:52,796
And it says here, "The single survivor
leads police to the Memorial Day Killer.

1124
01:13:52,835 --> 01:13:56,399
"The survivor is reported
to have been tortured and raped.

1125
01:13:56,438 --> 01:13:59,041
"She's now undergoing
psychiatric evaluation."

1126
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:04,046
Think about it. He said his mother
was captured and his father...

1127
01:14:04,086 --> 01:14:06,168
His father's body was never found.

1128
01:14:07,849 --> 01:14:09,532
I think we've just found him.

1129
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,652
Holy S-H-I-T.

1130
01:14:11,693 --> 01:14:13,655
Jesus Christ!

1131
01:14:13,695 --> 01:14:15,216
Chad!

1132
01:14:17,338 --> 01:14:19,339
- Time to die, freak!
- Wait!

1133
01:14:19,379 --> 01:14:20,662
Just wait! Wait, wait!

1134
01:14:20,702 --> 01:14:22,344
Wait, Chad! Wait!

1135
01:14:23,024 --> 01:14:24,625
- You're a hillbilly, too!
- Shut up!

1136
01:14:24,666 --> 01:14:26,226
No! Look!

1137
01:14:26,266 --> 01:14:28,228
That's your real father.
Right there!

1138
01:14:29,389 --> 01:14:31,031
No. No!

1139
01:14:31,071 --> 01:14:33,033
It's true, Chad. You're half hillbilly.

1140
01:14:35,675 --> 01:14:37,157
It can't be.

1141
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:42,122
They lied to me!

1142
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:45,525
How could they?

1143
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:47,406
Maybe they didn't want you
to know the truth.

1144
01:14:47,486 --> 01:14:49,207
There is no truth!

1145
01:14:49,848 --> 01:14:52,371
Everything is a lie!

1146
01:14:56,014 --> 01:14:58,336
- What did you do?
- Anthemis nobilis.

1147
01:14:58,376 --> 01:15:00,578
- What?
- It's the ingredient in camomile tea

1148
01:15:00,618 --> 01:15:04,903
that causes an anaphylactic reaction in
rare cases where people are allergic to it.

1149
01:15:04,942 --> 01:15:06,785
Like I said, I remember weird stuff.

1150
01:15:06,825 --> 01:15:09,707
But he'll be OK,
as long as we get him his inhaler.

1151
01:15:16,714 --> 01:15:18,235
Or not.

1152
01:15:27,764 --> 01:15:30,286
OK, here we go.
And, you ready?

1153
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:33,449
- Uh, yeah, wait. My teeth. Do I got any...
- Teeth are clear.

1154
01:15:33,488 --> 01:15:35,932
- Clear? OK, just give me a second.
- And we're rolling.

1155
01:15:39,294 --> 01:15:43,338
The chaos and confusion
of what transpired here last night

1156
01:15:43,378 --> 01:15:45,020
is still being unravelled.

1157
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:47,663
What appears to be a tragic mass suicide

1158
01:15:47,703 --> 01:15:51,026
involving a group of
mentally unstable college kids

1159
01:15:51,065 --> 01:15:55,990
may in fact be the work of a lone deranged
killer whose body has yet to be found.

1160
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:59,713
- The killings happened on the ....
- Knock knock. Hey!

1161
01:16:01,196 --> 01:16:04,437
- Hey, buddy. How you feeling?
- I'm feeling...

1162
01:16:05,118 --> 01:16:06,800
high on prescription medication.

1163
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,962
Yeah, looks like it.

1164
01:16:09,643 --> 01:16:11,404
They found my fingers.

1165
01:16:12,325 --> 01:16:13,686
Check it out.

1166
01:16:13,726 --> 01:16:15,688
- Yeah.
- I got to tell you...

1167
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:19,092
I don't remember that one looking that way.

1168
01:16:19,132 --> 01:16:21,253
Does that look funny to you?

1169
01:16:21,293 --> 01:16:22,615
No. No, not really.

1170
01:16:24,056 --> 01:16:26,420
That looks natural. It's good.

1171
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:28,300
By the way, I brought you something.

1172
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:30,342
- Shut your eyes, OK?
- All right.

1173
01:16:30,382 --> 01:16:31,903
OK, open them.

1174
01:16:32,864 --> 01:16:34,466
Oh...

1175
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:36,628
- Oh, buddy.
- That's a PBR, buddy.

1176
01:16:36,668 --> 01:16:39,631
That...
that's a thing of beauty.

1177
01:16:39,711 --> 01:16:41,273
- It's cold, too, should be.
- Oh, oh...

1178
01:16:41,312 --> 01:16:42,634
Look what else I got you.

1179
01:16:42,714 --> 01:16:45,356
A bendy straw,
your favourite sipping utensil.

1180
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:47,357
- - There you go.

1181
01:16:47,398 --> 01:16:49,641
Mmm. Mmm!

1182
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:52,723
Don't choke. I'm gonna let you rest.
You enjoy that, OK?

1183
01:16:52,763 --> 01:16:55,525
Drink the whole thing.
When I come back, I'm gonna have more.

1184
01:16:55,566 --> 01:16:56,846
- Dale?
- Yeah?

1185
01:16:57,567 --> 01:16:58,969
Did you ask her?

1186
01:17:00,371 --> 01:17:04,214
- Ask her what?
- Did you ask her out, for God's sake?

1187
01:17:04,254 --> 01:17:06,896
Oh. Well...

1188
01:17:08,336 --> 01:17:11,780
I was gonna, but then
I never actually got the chance, so...

1189
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:12,822
Dale!

1190
01:17:12,862 --> 01:17:15,865
You are hopeless,
you know that? You're hopeless.

1191
01:17:15,904 --> 01:17:19,949
Yeah. You're probably right about that.

1192
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:22,070
Except for...

1193
01:17:22,150 --> 01:17:26,274
she kinda mentioned to me
that she's a pretty darn good bowler, so...

1194
01:17:26,314 --> 01:17:27,315
we're goin' bowling.

1195
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:32,200
- You little dickhead.
- I'm outta here.

1196
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:35,884
OW.

1197
01:17:36,844 --> 01:17:38,725
Whoo! Yes.

1198
01:17:38,766 --> 01:17:43,051
- Dale Dobson, you are one lucky man.
- I guess it's just beginner's luck.

1199
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:46,373
That girl has got an amazing set...
of bowling fingers.

1200
01:17:46,413 --> 01:17:49,576
I know.
Listen, let me tell you something, OK?

1201
01:17:49,616 --> 01:17:52,339
Life is short, BJ.
You have to go after what you want,

1202
01:17:52,379 --> 01:17:55,101
because it sure as heck fire
ain't gonna just fall right into your lap.

1203
01:17:55,141 --> 01:17:57,584
- You know somethin'? You're right.
- I know.

1204
01:17:57,664 --> 01:18:00,385
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- OK. Right, now, listen to me, though.

1205
01:18:00,466 --> 01:18:02,909
Don't be nervous, and just be yourself, OK?

1206
01:18:02,988 --> 01:18:04,150
Yeah.

1207
01:18:04,190 --> 01:18:06,031
You got 'er. Go, buddy.

1208
01:18:07,633 --> 01:18:08,633
Hey.

1209
01:18:08,673 --> 01:18:11,276
- I'm pretty good at this, aren't I?
- You are. That was great.

1210
01:18:11,316 --> 01:18:15,600
Listen, Allie, I hope you don't think
this is too stupid or whatever,

1211
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,642
but I got you a little something.

1212
01:18:18,643 --> 01:18:21,045
Dale, that's so sweet.
You didn't have to do that.

1213
01:18:21,085 --> 01:18:22,327
I know. I wanted to.

1214
01:18:23,368 --> 01:18:25,089
Oh, my gosh.

1215
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:28,852
- You know what that is?
- Yes, it's a... it's a helmet.

1216
01:18:28,893 --> 01:18:30,414
It's a pink helmet.

1217
01:18:30,453 --> 01:18:33,978
I think, you know, it might just be better if
you wear that every day from now on, so...

1218
01:18:34,058 --> 01:18:35,939
- OK, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1219
01:18:35,979 --> 01:18:37,380
It's perfect.

1220
01:18:38,982 --> 01:18:40,663
So, listen, Dale, I'm, uh...

1221
01:18:40,743 --> 01:18:43,707
I'm really sorry about
everything that happened.

1222
01:18:43,747 --> 01:18:46,228
What do you mean?
For what? I had a great time.

1223
01:18:46,269 --> 01:18:50,153
I mean, except for all the people dying, when
they were bleeding on us and everything.

1224
01:18:50,193 --> 01:18:53,114
That wasn't so much fun,
but...you know...

1225
01:18:54,076 --> 01:18:56,118
I enjoyed every minute
I got to spend with you.

1226
01:18:56,158 --> 01:18:58,760
- Dale...
- You know what? Let me just say this,

1227
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:03,204
cos I don't know if we're ever gonna get
to spend this kind of time together again,

1228
01:19:03,245 --> 01:19:04,807
and I want to let you know that I...

1229
01:19:06,688 --> 01:19:08,250
I feel the same way.

1230
01:19:10,411 --> 01:19:12,373
- Really?
- Really.

1231
01:19:14,415 --> 01:19:15,977
BJ!

1232
01:19:17,578 --> 01:19:20,140
Oh, my God, should we go help her?

1233
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:21,222
Hell, no.

1234
01:19:26,346 --> 01:19:27,347
Whatever.
