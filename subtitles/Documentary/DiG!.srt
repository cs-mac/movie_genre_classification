1
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:11,964
MAN: <i>Dig it.</i>

2
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:15,519
Hey, wait. Bring that thing out here, man.
Let the kids dig this.

3
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:18,360
You getting that okay? Dig.

4
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,042
<i>Bring that back here.</i>

5
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:26,368
<i>Now listen to this.</i>

6
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:28,007
-I'll just say what I gotta say.
-Damn right!

7
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:31,877
I'm here to destroy this fucked up system.
I will do it. That's why I got the job.

8
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:35,723
I said, "Let it be me.
Use my hands. I'll use our strength."

9
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:37,401
Let's fucking burn it to the ground.

10
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:41,004
<i>1995, this is the year I met Anton Newcombe</i>

11
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:43,728
<i>and his band, the Brian Jonestown Massacre.</i>

12
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:47,927
<i>Anton was by far the craziest</i>
<i>and most talented musician I had ever met.</i>

13
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:50,523
<i>I'm Courtney Taylor from the Dandy Warhols.</i>

14
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:52,725
<i>Anton was my friend and my enemy,</i>

15
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:56,484
<i>the greatest inspiration</i>
<i>and, ultimately, the greatest regret.</i>

16
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,279
<i>This is the story of us and our bands</i>

17
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:02,041
<i>over seven years.</i>

18
00:01:32,249 --> 00:01:35,207
# ...up because here I come

19
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:43,728
# With a gift for everyone.... #

20
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,122
You guys took forever to get down here.

21
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:28,518
-Wait till I get the amps and just move in.
-Our car broke....

22
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:30,042
-Hi, I've been waiting to meet you.
-Ondi.

23
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:31,448
-Pleased to meet you.
-Hi.

24
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:34,760
-Where do you want to go play tonight?
-Right fucking here.

25
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:37,488
I guess we ought to take the shit back
to the practice space anyways.

26
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:38,888
No, let's go somewhere and play.

27
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:41,529
No, we gotta have a revolution, man.
We just got to usher the shit in.

28
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:44,681
If somebody wants to distribute our records
and allow us absolute freedom,

29
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:46,885
then I'm not opposed to
people making money.

30
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:49,087
It's just it's a mafia.

31
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,685
Until they can write the letter I'm writing,
they're the postman and I'm the letter-writer.

32
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:55,122
Period. End of discussion.

33
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,245
We got a party to go to tonight.
We got a party to play.

34
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:59,240
-Good to know.
-You're gonna play a party?

35
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:00,648
210 Waller Street.

36
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:02,765
Hi. Hello. Hello. You guys ready?

37
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,205
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce</i>
<i>a band that knows where I live,</i>

38
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:08,166
<i>the Brian Jonestown Massacre.</i>

39
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:10,001
(CROWD CHEERING)

40
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:24,645
# What she wants is she wants me to go-go

41
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:32,165
# Got turned off
'cause she's going too slow-slow

42
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,446
# I know what you want

43
00:03:37,529 --> 00:03:39,918
# So just reach out and grab it

44
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:48,717
# I thought of a tune to write her

45
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:49,964
# Go #

46
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:53,723
ERlC: <i>What's different about Jonestown?</i>
<i>It's real.</i>

47
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:56,642
It's the band that you love to hate,
and the band that you hate to love.

48
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,924
<i>Live performances are infamous for them.</i>

49
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:02,365
-It's about the twelfth time I've seen....
-Brian Jonestown.

50
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:05,805
-Twelve.
-Within six months.

51
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:08,847
I was completely blown away.
I had never seen anything like that.

52
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:12,922
It was, like, so retro and so the future.

53
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:15,000
<i>It was mayhem on stage.</i>

54
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:20,083
<i>Three guitar players, a tambourine player,</i>
<i>an insane singer, the music was fantastic.</i>

55
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:22,080
<i>I'd never seen anything like it.</i>

56
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:39,567
The only band I've made the effort to go see
in the last three years is Brian Jonestown.

57
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:45,406
Anton, to me, is the best '60s revivalist

58
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:47,559
there has been since the '60s.

59
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:51,005
What made it so interesting
was that it was not an act of invention.

60
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:55,002
It was not based off of any pretence
of crafting something new.

61
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:59,881
It was a thoroughly post-modern music.
It was a pastiche of everything.

62
00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:02,802
Musically, he's a genius.

63
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:05,718
Oh, I think he has an incredible ear for music

64
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:10,007
and for reinterpreting the past
and putting it in the future.

65
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:12,887
It's American heritage reinterpreted.

66
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:17,918
Anton created this kind of scene
and everyone else has built upon it.

67
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:20,809
This is one of my friend's bands that us....

68
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:25,964
Between us and a couple of other bands,
we're gonna kick off a full musical revolution

69
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:27,721
so forget about the other bands.

70
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:32,246
This is a whole other level of the American
underground that I'm gonna help expose.

71
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:35,241
So, tell me right now you've never ever heard
the Dandy Warhols before.

72
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:38,048
-INTERVIEWER: Never heard them before.
-Let's see what they sound like.

73
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,166
ANTON: <i>So get ready for a massive</i>
<i>concussion of rock and roll</i>

74
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:43,888
<i>with the Dandy Warhols.</i>

75
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:02,727
# Yeah.... #

76
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:06,728
We write our kinds of music together.
We're really good friends.

77
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:09,846
-INTERVIEWER: Really?
-We've got a full-scale revolution going on.

78
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:17,887
(SINGING ALONG)

79
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:21,161
-Really bitching.
-Are they in Portland?

80
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:23,763
Yeah, we're neighbours.
We're building a studio.

81
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:26,238
-Is that rad?
-You know where you're building a studio?

82
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:29,321
Yeah, we're getting down.
We're gonna take over the world.

83
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:31,761
Yeah.

84
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,647
And we're gonna show you how to do it, too.

85
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:38,483
-How to take over the world in five steps?
-Fuck, yeah. On your movie.

86
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:58,446
We actually got a tape of Anton's, like,
about the same time we formed the band.

87
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:03,280
And then a year later we went down
to San Francisco to play some parties and...

88
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:08,725
sure enough, Anton walked in
and we definitely recognised him instantly.

89
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:10,765
It could be nobody else.

90
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:12,919
We're playing and these two guys walk in

91
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:17,878
just like Mr Cool in their black-leather
junky jackets and all this stuff,

92
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:20,119
and we're like, "All right, who's that?"

93
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:21,801
They just looked amazing.

94
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:25,245
They had the fucking coolest hair
and they were styled out, like so hip....

95
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:28,526
It kind of intimidated us.
We were like, "Oh, my God!" you know.

96
00:07:28,609 --> 00:07:31,726
This is kind of what we expected
from a big city. It's like, "Oh, shit."

97
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:35,597
And then, we just like, hung out all night
and just got fucking loaded.

98
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:38,119
<i>Yes, won't you.... Won't you join us?</i>

99
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:41,237
<i>God, that E just wore off</i>
<i>in a hot second, man.</i>

100
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:44,560
COURTNEY: <i>It was awesome,</i>
<i>we had, like, the best time.</i>

101
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:46,082
<i>Right on, brother.</i>

102
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:48,729
-I swear they're the best band in America.
-INTERVIEWER: Wow.

103
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:50,686
They're so fucking amazing.

104
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:53,203
No label will touch them. They are so crazy.

105
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:57,760
I've never seen them eat. All I've seen
them do is drink liquor and snort drugs.

106
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:00,727
That's like.... That's all they do, you know.

107
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:20,448
That's funny.

108
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:25,880
Joel, do you want some more?

109
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:27,925
Yes, please.

110
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:29,757
Oh, my God.

111
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:33,404
This is a very strange gathering.

112
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,843
I suppose it's time for a costume change.

113
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:41,718
God.

114
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:48,201
They're just our buddies.
They're our alter egos in some way,

115
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:51,679
inspiring each other
to create and be successful.

116
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:56,528
COURTNEY: <i>Our bands played together a lot</i>
<i>over the next couple of years,</i>

117
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:58,406
<i>and it was rock.</i>

118
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:14,204
# 'Cause I
I believe it in my soul #

119
00:09:14,489 --> 00:09:17,686
People will always say, "Well, what music
do you like at the moment?"

120
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:20,841
and I would say Brian Jonestown Massacre
and the Dandy Warhols.

121
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:24,080
<i>Jonestown and the Dandys</i>
<i>have a window of opportunity.</i>

122
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:27,042
They can relate to suburban people,
drug people,

123
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:29,723
and they can also relate to literary people,

124
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:33,518
and also to people who have some
real knowledge of how music developed.

125
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:42,445
COURTNEY: <i>In 1996, my band,</i>
<i>the Dandy Warhols,</i>

126
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:44,918
<i>were in a studio in our hometown</i>
<i>of Portland, Oregon,</i>

127
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:47,603
<i>recording our first album</i>
<i>for Capitol Records.</i>

128
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:51,443
<i>Now, unlike the Brian Jonestown Massacre,</i>
<i>we had just signed with a major label,</i>

129
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:54,726
<i>and, of course, they thought</i>
<i>we were gonna be the next big thing.</i>

130
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:57,118
They have the potential to be a very big band

131
00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:02,966
because they have created a world
of their own. It's a Dandy Warhols world.

132
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:06,166
And they don't therefore belong
to any particular trend.

133
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:11,200
COURTNEY: <i>Our first record for Capitol</i>
<i>took two tries.</i>

134
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:15,965
<i>The first time it got rejected, they had</i>
<i>the gall to tell me that there was no songs.</i>

135
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:20,964
It just really pissed me off
and I got all...uppity about it

136
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:25,406
and, "Who are you to tell me what a song is,
you who have written so many songs?

137
00:10:25,489 --> 00:10:27,559
"How many? None?
Between the two of you, ever?"

138
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:32,484
So then, I think, I ended that by saying,
"I sneeze and hits come out."

139
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:35,728
To which Perry said,

140
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:37,879
"Well, then, if that's the case,

141
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:40,403
"I'm sure Capitol will have no problem

142
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:43,003
"finding the funds
to finance your handkerchiefs."

143
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:48,083
I think it's like something.... Like 85 to 90%
of all records made never recoup,

144
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:51,127
which doesn't mean to say
you really succeed, all you do is recoup.

145
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:53,962
So the odds are that the Dandy Warhols,
like everybody else, will fail.

146
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:04,685
Today, I mixed 13 songs.
I started at 7:00 am, was done by 1:00.

147
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:10,366
Found a drummer, taught him all the tunes,
didn't do anything else on my birthday.

148
00:11:10,609 --> 00:11:14,238
In 1996, the Brian Jonestown Massacre
had a record out.

149
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:16,763
They were on a lot of A&R hot lists.

150
00:11:16,849 --> 00:11:20,558
They were in hit magazines as one of
the bands that was the most courted.

151
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:22,765
It's a fabulous record.

152
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:26,041
People are jealous of our sheer ambition
that we have

153
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:30,839
and the fact that we're the most
prolific people, albeit in North America.

COURTNEY: <i>The Brian Jonestown Massacre</i>

INTERVIEWER: When he tells me
he doesn't wanna sign with major labels,

159
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:47,439
is he serious he wouldn't go that route?

160
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:49,201
He always talks about doing it, though.

161
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:51,723
-Yeah, I mean, that's the plan.
-That's why we came down here.

162
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:55,563
-That's why we came here.
-He wants to rip them off in some way....

163
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:57,441
He doesn't want them
to take advantage of him.

164
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:02,887
But in order not to get taken advantage of,
he wants to take advantage of everyone else,

165
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:06,962
and then you're just as corrupt as the system
that you're trying not to be corrupted by.

166
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:09,882
Five, six, seven. It's magic.

167
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:15,120
The guy does not....
He doesn't know how to support himself.

168
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:17,518
He's been homeless for five years or so.

169
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:22,205
Matt Hollywood was Anton's, like,
cranky little brother who...

170
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:28,006
probably wanted to be Anton,
knew he wasn't quite as talented as Anton.

171
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:32,082
Erm, still wrote some really,
really great songs, and sang them well,

172
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:35,718
but Anton never really let him
have the spotlight

173
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:38,846
the way that he could have or should have
or needed to.

(PLAYING INDIAN STYLE MUSIC)

175
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:47,009
I think Anton understands
that what he's doing

176
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:49,478
is part of a continuum of rock music,

177
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:54,120
almost like he is someone from the '60s
who just happens to be living here and now

178
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:59,124
and is totally lost and doesn't really
understand the ways that people do things.

179
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:02,204
I'm just saying don't fucking fuck with me.

180
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:04,757
I'm not fucking with you,
I'm trying to explain things to you.

181
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:06,601
If you don't wanna listen to
the way people feel,

182
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:10,921
if you don't want to listen to other people's
opinions, then go off and do it yourself

183
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:13,569
and be loved by your fucking self
and nobody will love you

184
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:15,526
because you don't want to
deal with other people.

-Cool, I won't have any headaches, either.
-Great.

186
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:20,558
I don't do anything wrong,
that's why I don't say sorry.

187
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:25,564
You do. That's the first step in being human,
realising that you do and making 'em better.

I don't do it fucking wrong.
I'm just telling you a fact.

00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:35,567
-You know, every religion makes people....
-I hate religion

192
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,446
because that's what fucked up your mind.

193
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:41,920
Every fucking spiritual belief,
you burn in hell for pretending to be God

194

200
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:07,204
And.... But I had to convince
a couple of other people from the company,

201
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:11,362
and I took my boss, Nancy Jeffries,
who was the head of the A&R department,

202
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:15,681
to a show in Los Angeles
that we set up especially for her,

203
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:18,567
so she could witness them
and make up her own opinion

204
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,721

and he'd have six other Antons
or five other Antons,

277
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:50,681

<i>Anton on all the guitars, and whatever.</i>

279
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:58,603
He's his own worst enemy
because he thinks success and credibility

280
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:02,648
are mutually exclusive terms,
which is an easy baggage to inherit,

281

but a very difficult one to
haul through every decision of your career

282
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:10,478
because, as a musician, you want to reach
the biggest possible audience,

283
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:14,244

-I used the money...
-INTERVIEWER: It cost you 17 bucks?

290
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:35,802
17 bucks to make
<i>Thank God for Mental Illness.</i>

291
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:38,562
No shit, and I'm gonna show you
because we're gonna go up to Oregon.

292
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:41,402
I'm gonna record a bunch more records
and you can see.

293
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:46,806
COURTNEY: <i>Anton had been threatening</i>
<i>to move to Portland for months,</i>

294
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:49,642
<i>but when he finally showed up</i>
<i>with all of his belongings,</i>

295
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:53,085
<i>we realised that he had intended</i>
<i>to move in with us.</i>

296
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:55,080
<i>We couldn't really take him in.</i>

297
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:57,399
I'm in Portland now. It's been a rough trip.

298
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,445
-INTERVIEWER: It was a rough trip?
-Yes.

299
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:01,360
Going up. Top floor.

300
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:05,283
Pantyhose, illegal drugs and cigarettes.

301
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:09,159
You're supposed to push "stop".
Oh, well. My hairspray.

302
00:20:10,129 --> 00:20:12,643
MAN: Protect your....

303
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:16,085
An after-rinse for that hold
for weather you just can't count on.

304
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:19,718
Hello, darling. I'm home. What's for tea?

305
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:22,519
INTERVIEWER: Do you find Portland
creatively inspiring, Anton?

306
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:24,406
No, I find it dismal.

307
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:28,243
It was a terrible mistake to come here,
but we did it,

308
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:31,048
and now that we're here,
there's nothing we can say, huh?

309
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,484
INTERVIEWER: Do you feel
like you're in exile here?

310
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:36,003
(SNICKERING) Baby, baby!

311
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:37,807
JOEL: I've gotten on with him.

312
00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:42,838
It's really been good for my hopeless,
isolated, life-is-shit kind of vibe.

313
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:45,762
INTERVIEWER: Did anybody in the band
invite Anton to move up here, or....

314
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:47,077
Well....

315
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:50,445
Or suggest it would be a good place
for Anton to move, or anything?

316
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:54,483
I don't know, it's like inviting Anton
to your house. This is a small town.

317
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:55,684
I don't know.

318
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:01,486
Maybe he expected to stay with us.

319
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:04,845
-We weren't gonna have him stay with us.
-And make a record with him and....

320
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:09,923
Yeah, and we went on with our lives
because we actually had stuff to do.

321
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:12,569
We had to get that record done.
We had to get it out.

322
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:14,446
-We....
-Yeah, we were being productive.

323
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:17,124
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

324
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,359
COURTNEY: <i>We played a New Year's show</i>
<i>that year,</i>

325
00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:21,360
<i>and Joel, of course, came to party.</i>

326
00:21:21,449 --> 00:21:24,964
<i>I didn't notice at the time,</i>
<i>but Anton didn't show.</i>

327
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:27,119
Any resolutions this year, Courtney?

328
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:29,518
Any revolutions for this year, Courtney?

329
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:32,959
Yeah, I'm gonna get this....
Like a tattoo of this here.

330
00:21:33,449 --> 00:21:36,247
I like this 'cause it
makes me feel like Amadeus.

331
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:44,043
Hence my theory the Dandy Warhols
are nothing but a bunch of fags.

332
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:49,802
Six, five, four, three, two, one.

333
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:51,881
Happy New Year!

334
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,562
Happy New Year.

335
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:21,039
Quiet, the artist needs quiet.

336
00:22:21,129 --> 00:22:25,088
The artist is gonna create a sound
for his concise purpose,

337
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:30,197
using a modular synthesising apparatus
from RadioShack.

338
00:22:30,969 --> 00:22:32,766
(SYNTHESIZED MUSIC PLAYING)

339
00:22:48,249 --> 00:22:52,128
One, two, three, four.

340
00:23:00,089 --> 00:23:02,125
# Ooh

341
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:09,758
# Say goodbye to Mum and Dad

342
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:13,718
# The two best friends I never had...

343
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:18,087
(RECORDED VERSION CUTS IN)
# ...to be knowing where I'm going

344
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:20,046
# How about you? #

345
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,402
Tony was raised in a very affluent society.

346
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:28,401
He had every advantage
a child could possibly have.

347
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:29,968
<i>I mean, he had a lot of disadvantages.</i>

348
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:32,279
<i>He was raised by a single parent.</i>
<i>He didn't have a father.</i>

349
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:36,328
Well, that was my fault.
Being an alcoholic, I left the family

350
00:23:36,409 --> 00:23:39,640
when he was about a year,
a year and a half old.

351
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:45,798
I had shown symptoms of schizophrenia.
I drank every day.

352
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:50,007
You have to look at....
Here's a very, very superiorly intelligent child

353
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:51,886
who knows what the curfew is,

354
00:23:51,969 --> 00:23:55,279
who knows that Newport Beach
strongly enforces the curfew,

355
00:23:55,369 --> 00:24:01,205
who has been arrested 50 times for it
and yet continues to do it.

356
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:04,565
So when they called me at work and said,
"You need to come and pick him up,"

357
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:07,686
when I went to the Newport Beach jail,
I said, "I'm not taking him.

358
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:10,567
"I'm not picking him up.
I'm tired of doing this."

359
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,447
And they said, "But you have to."
I said, "No, I don't have to."

360
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:16,407
"What are you going to do?
'Cause I'm not picking him up."

361
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:20,926
I told him the last time,
"Next time I won't come get you."

362
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:25,924
So he was taken to the adolescent unit
by the police, not by me.

363
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:30,048
I signed the papers as his guardian,
but he was taken there by the police.

364
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:33,727
I hate to see him repeat his life like myself.

365
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:36,166
Two divorces and...

366
00:24:37,489 --> 00:24:39,764
and not getting a chance to raise your kid.

367
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:43,325
There was times when Tony appeared
under the influence.

368
00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:45,400
There was times when he was growing pot

369
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:49,277
and I was the first one to call the police
and have them come here and get it.

370
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:53,044
<i>And I guess I sort of thought</i>
<i>eventually he'd get over all this nonsense,</i>

371
00:24:53,129 --> 00:24:57,884
<i>and he'd grow up, and he'd get a real job,</i>
<i>but he never has.</i>

372
00:24:57,969 --> 00:25:01,006
He feels starved for affection, I think. Love.

373
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:04,479
As a father, you know,
I probably failed immensely,

374
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:07,003
you know, and I feel guilty about that.

375
00:25:07,249 --> 00:25:11,527
If he has abandonment issues,
they're as much my responsibility as his.

376
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:16,763
I know this is the album he gave me,
<i>Thank God for Mental Illness.</i>

377
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:30,602
It's sad, isn't it?

378
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:34,045
-INTERVIEWER: Extremely sad.
-They are the best two friends I never had.

379
00:25:34,129 --> 00:25:39,078
He has no.... Really, as near as I can tell,
doesn't have any family he can fall back on.

380
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:43,682
He doesn't have any money,
doesn't have a home.

381
00:25:43,969 --> 00:25:48,679
It's enough to drive anybody crazy. I think
he's a little bit on the edge besides that,

382
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:52,125
but, you know, it's amazing he has....

383
00:25:52,729 --> 00:25:56,563
He can be as sane as he usually is.

384
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:58,242
Actually, he has nobody.

385
00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:01,287
You know, he gets help
because some people are with him.

386
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:07,001
We are all with him. But I don't think his
family has ever been very helpful for him.

387
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:10,479
When we got together, we all realised
our parents were all still married,

388
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:14,084
and we were like, "We're the most
well-adjusted band in America."

389
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:17,088
We're the most well-adjusted band
in America.

390
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:19,125
COURTNEY: <i>The BJM returned to LA.</i>

391
00:26:19,249 --> 00:26:23,242
<i>Anton promised Greg Shaw of</i>
<i>Bomp! Records, his next album</i>

392
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:26,878
<i>in exchange for the money to rent a house</i>
<i>in Los Angeles.</i>

393
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:31,042
<i>He and Joel invited the rest of the BJM</i>
<i>to take rooms in the house,</i>

394
00:26:31,129 --> 00:26:33,689
<i>so they could make the big industry push.</i>

395
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:36,841
<i>Even Jeff Davies, Anton's genius guitarist,</i>

396
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:41,480
<i>who'd battled heroin addiction,</i>
<i>returned from rehab, full of hope.</i>

397
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:45,361
JEFF: I've been on couches and floors
for so damn long,

398
00:26:45,449 --> 00:26:50,921
I am very digging the idea
of having a door that you can close.

399
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:54,206
-Where's Anton at?
-He's taken Courtney to the airport.

400
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:57,281
COURTNEY: <i>I'd been meeting with Capitol</i>
<i>as I was finishing the record.</i>

401
00:26:57,369 --> 00:27:01,806
<i>I wanted Anton's opinion on a song</i>
<i>everyone expected to be a massive hit.</i>

402
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:05,279
Anton, this is gonna be....
This is like such a ridiculous, like,

403
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:08,441
-super fucking thing.
-I can't.... Bring it up.

404
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:12,408
-I'm ready to get silly.
-Yeah.

405
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:18,161
(NOT IF YOU WERE THE LAST JUNKIE
ON EARTH PLAYING)

406
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:29,885
COURTNEY: <i>Anton didn't react at all.</i>

407
00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:33,803
<i>It kind of bummed me out,</i>
<i>but I think I knew why.</i>

408
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:39,682
Anton inspired Courtney to go
much farther than he's ever gone before.

409
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:44,843
It was definitely both of them
kind of wanting to be the other person.

410
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:49,082
I know Courtney's always wanted
that mad genius thing

411
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:53,879
but is unable or unwilling
to let himself go that far.

412
00:27:53,969 --> 00:27:56,802
Anton and Courtney,
love-hate relationship, I guess.

413
00:27:56,889 --> 00:28:00,086
I think they feel they're on the same level
in many ways, with creative ability.

414
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:02,524
<i>They challenge each other.</i>
<i>They fuel each other's fire.</i>

415
00:28:02,609 --> 00:28:07,524
COURTNEY: <i>I didn't have time to reflect</i>
<i>on Anton's lack of interest in my new song</i>

416
00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:12,524
<i>'cause mega-celebrity fashion photographer,</i>
<i>David LaChapelle, agreed to do our video.</i>

417
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:16,603
<i>Capitol threw down $400,000</i>
<i>to make this happen.</i>

418
00:28:16,689 --> 00:28:19,601
<i>Suddenly, it felt like</i>
<i>we were going to be big time.</i>

419

# I never thought you'd be a junkie
because heroin is so passé #

420
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:27,243
-Big money.
-Turn around and look at that thing.

421
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:34,121
I didn't know it was going to be
a deaf advertisement.

422
00:28:34,209 --> 00:28:36,120
Yeah, the '80s angle.

423
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:38,962
-The '80s angle?
-Yeah, it was a real '80s angle.

424
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:52,083
I'm not going to really collaborate.

425
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:54,524
You know, if it's great,
I'm gonna think you're fucking great.

426
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:57,043
If it's not,
I'm gonna be really pissed off at you.

427
00:28:57,129 --> 00:28:59,324
Courtney's having second thoughts
about the entire video.

428
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:02,526
If we could reshoot just the band stuff
once my hair grows out.

429
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:04,998
Okay, redo it, but we have to redo it
'cause of the hair....

430
00:29:05,089 --> 00:29:07,205
-I think they drove out....

00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:13,126
-Play fucking video games.
-I don't....

577
00:39:13,209 --> 00:39:17,680
I can play fucking computer games.
I can fucking escape into a fantasy world.

578
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:21,318
I can get you to Chicago
and also leave you here, you fucking turd.

579
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:24,128
And now you have us
and you have a fucking life.

580
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:26,598
No, you don't give me any life, man.

581
00:39:26,689 --> 00:39:29,965
-You're not life, you're just fucked up death.
-I've gotta go.

582
00:39:30,049 --> 00:39:34,008
I've been busting my ass
for you pussies for so long

583
00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:37,240
and I get your fucking mouth
and I get your shit.

584
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:40,365
I will fucking kill you.

585
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:44,761
COURTNEY: <i>Matt and Peter left,</i>
<i>intending to walk back to California.</i>

586
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,204
We're gonna go on no matter what.

587
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:50,008
INTERVIEWER: Not without Matt and Peter,
to New York.

588
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:52,478
It's going to go on no matter what.

589
00:39:55,249 --> 00:39:56,682
Not this trip.

590
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,237
This trip's going on no matter what.
I'm going to New York

591
00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:03,163
with or without these people,
whether they play or don't play.

592
00:40:04,289 --> 00:40:05,324
Well....

593
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:09,448
I'll turn it into a vacation if I have to.
I ain't out here for nothing, man.

594
00:40:10,529 --> 00:40:15,239
Basically the guys walked off,
away from our whole camp,

595
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,843
in the middle of the night, drunk as hell.

596
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:22,207
And Peter, being this young, immature
fucking stupid.... Here comes a cop.

597
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:27,238
...hippie fucking dumbass that he's being,
went with him,

598
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:30,480
and they walked away
from my scene completely.

599
00:40:30,569 --> 00:40:34,164
And we've been up
the alleyways back and forth.

600
00:40:34,249 --> 00:40:38,003
Here comes the sun. It's the next day.
We've been looking forever.

601
00:40:38,089 --> 00:40:39,761
And they're not here.

602
00:40:39,849 --> 00:40:43,762
I'm sober, and I drank a lot more
than they did, and I'm sober now.

603
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:47,808
They haven't come back,
therefore, what do we do?

604
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:52,883
Choice one, we leave Peter and Matt
in Chicago forevermore

605
00:40:52,969 --> 00:40:54,641
and never see them again.

606
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:58,521
DAVE: <i>We finally found them,</i>
<i>but we were miserable.</i>

607
00:40:58,609 --> 00:41:03,888
<i>We knew the whole time the Dandys were</i>
<i>out there somewhere living the highlife.</i>

608
00:41:07,409 --> 00:41:09,525
(EVERY DAY SHOULD BE A HOLlDAY)

609
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:35,998
# Summertime
If I was getting paid

610
00:41:36,089 --> 00:41:39,684
# For getting drunk and getting laid

611
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:42,243
# I'd grab a phone and call.... #

612
00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:44,763
COURTNEY: <i>We came back to Los Angeles</i>
<i>to discover that Capitol</i>

613
00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:48,000
<i>had not been promoting our choice</i>
<i>for a second single,</i> Boys Better,

614
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:52,287
<i>because our first single</i> Junkie
<i>hadn't broken the top 20 on US radio.</i>

615
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:57,046
<i>I called the label but couldn't get</i>
<i>anyone to assume responsibility.</i>

616
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:02,678
I'd really love to have a successful single.
I'd like to have, you know....

617
00:42:05,129 --> 00:42:06,608
Yeah.

618
00:42:07,249 --> 00:42:11,606
You haven't scheduled any time
like a week or whatever to do radio?

619
00:42:13,049 --> 00:42:17,281
As early as possible would probably really
be good for my band at least.

620
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:20,202
<i>You're saying that you don't carry</i>
<i>a lot of weight around Capitol?</i>

621
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:24,362
MAN: (ON PHONE) <i>I'm just telling you that</i>
<i>it's not up to me, really.</i>

622
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:27,168
COURTNEY: <i>Everybody says</i>
<i>it's not up to them around there.</i>

623
00:42:27,249 --> 00:42:32,369
<i>The suits were disappointed that we hadn't</i>
<i>turned out to be an overnight sensation.</i>

624
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,963
<i>Apparently, the</i> Junkie <i>video</i>
<i>had been put on hold</i>

625
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:37,563
<i>because Capitol repoed</i>
<i>the footage from LaChapelle.</i>

626
00:42:37,649 --> 00:42:39,640
<i>I thought they'd put too much</i>
<i>make-up on me.</i>

627
00:42:39,769 --> 00:42:42,647
Take my name off of it.
I talked to Courtney last night.

628
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:47,644
He doesn't want any close-ups in it.
He wants it to be a performance spectacle.

629
00:42:47,729 --> 00:42:50,607
He wrote me this smoochy-coochy letter.
"You, Salvador...."

630
00:42:50,689 --> 00:42:52,805
Compared me to Salvador Dali and Man Ray.

631
00:42:52,889 --> 00:42:55,244
And, "You do whatever you want,"
and this and that.

632
00:42:55,329 --> 00:42:58,765
As soon as I'm done with the video,
he thinks he can just start screaming at me

633
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:03,843
at the top of his fucking lungs
and acting like a huge spoiled Baby Huey.

634
00:43:04,009 --> 00:43:07,240
<i>He's not like an alternative rock star.</i>
<i>He's a pop star.</i>

635
00:43:07,369 --> 00:43:09,724
<i>I mean, he's like an R&B act or something.</i>

636
00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:12,607
You know, I'm "obsessed with the face",
how they look.

637
00:43:12,689 --> 00:43:16,568
I said to him, you know,
"This is how you look.

638
00:43:16,649 --> 00:43:22,007
"This isn't some weird, you know,
sort of special-effecty video

639
00:43:22,089 --> 00:43:28,119
"where, you know, this is like
pretty diffused light on you, and you look....

640
00:43:28,209 --> 00:43:30,325
"You know, Zia looks like how Zia looks.

641
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:33,560
"The dancers looked how they looked,
and you look how you look,

642
00:43:33,649 --> 00:43:35,799
"and that's how you look.

643
00:43:35,889 --> 00:43:38,449
-"This is you."
-INTERVIEWER: What did he say?

644
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:41,885
He started screaming
that he's done thousands of videos.

645
00:43:41,969 --> 00:43:43,766
He used the word "thousands".

646
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:46,647
"I've done thousands of videos
and I know how I look."

647
00:43:46,729 --> 00:43:49,118
COURTNEY: <i>Dealing with</i>
<i>diva fashion photographers</i>

648
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:53,361
<i>and evasive record label executives</i>
<i>was starting to really get me down.</i>

649
00:43:53,449 --> 00:43:55,804
<i>Seemed the only inspiration</i>
<i>I found at the label</i>

650
00:43:55,889 --> 00:43:59,962
<i>was looking through the pictures of</i>
<i>the shoot we staged at the Jonestown house.</i>

651
00:44:01,369 --> 00:44:04,441
Didn't we have fun
at the Brian Jonestown house?

652
00:44:05,489 --> 00:44:07,878
COURTNEY: <i>So I found</i>
<i>one of those drive-away car deals,</i>

653
00:44:07,969 --> 00:44:10,802
<i>caught up with</i>
<i>the Brian Jonestown Massacre in Detroit</i>

654
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:14,279
<i>and found out that Anton had written</i>
<i>a couple of songs for me.</i>

655
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:19,923
# Courtney Taylor

656
00:44:20,009 --> 00:44:22,523
# You're a hell of a guy, don't you know

657
00:44:23,249 --> 00:44:26,605
# I met you in there after the show #

658
00:44:28,689 --> 00:44:31,840
Okay, this song is called
<i>Not If You Were The Last Dandy on Earth.</i>

659
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:34,323
Ready?

660
00:44:34,409 --> 00:44:38,038
(NOT IF YOU WERE THE LAST
DANDY ON EARTH PLAYING)

661
00:44:51,249 --> 00:44:53,319
-It's psychotic art.
-Dude, that's so good.

662
00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:59,641
I will personally tolerate
more shenanigans from that fucking Anton

663
00:44:59,729 --> 00:45:03,165
than I will anyone else,
just because he makes and has made

664
00:45:03,249 --> 00:45:07,879
such unbelievably
powerful and important records.

665
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:14,841
(SINGING INDISTINCTLY)

666
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:18,604
# And the good times all ended

667
00:45:18,689 --> 00:45:22,284
# When the money was spent.... #

668
00:45:41,329 --> 00:45:45,004
Fuck that. I'd enjoy the concert much more
without any shit from you!

669
00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:49,958
<i>I work fucking hard. I work fucking hard.</i>

670
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:53,724
COURTNEY: <i>Well, they didn't know what to</i>
<i>call this one. A newspaper called it a riot.</i>

671
00:45:53,809 --> 00:45:56,562
<i>The audience had attacked the film crew</i>
<i>for filming the band</i>

672
00:45:56,649 --> 00:45:59,607
<i>and then jumped the band.</i>
<i>I thought it was fantastic.</i>

673
00:45:59,689 --> 00:46:04,558
I could've hit you in the fucking face!
You hit, you fuck with our people!

674
00:46:04,649 --> 00:46:07,607
I love this. This is great.
This doesn't happen to my band.

675
00:46:07,689 --> 00:46:11,125
Not to my band. This is cool.

676
00:46:11,209 --> 00:46:12,767
Yeah, that was funny.

677
00:46:12,849 --> 00:46:16,842
<i>It's pretty amazing that those guys</i>
<i>make it through any gig without fighting.</i>

678
00:46:17,129 --> 00:46:21,088
There's this great sense of expectation
and anticipation

679
00:46:21,169 --> 00:46:23,160
when one goes and sees
Brian Jonestown Massacre

680
00:46:23,249 --> 00:46:27,242
about exactly what could go down.
Will there be a knife fight?

681
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:30,321
<i>Will one of the band members</i>
<i>decide they hate the other person so much</i>

682
00:46:30,409 --> 00:46:32,320
<i>they're going to slam them in the head?</i>

683
00:46:32,409 --> 00:46:35,879
<i>Will they dissipate</i>
<i>and fall apart after one song?</i>

684
00:46:36,009 --> 00:46:39,968
<i>Or will someone antagonise the audience</i>
<i>so much that you'll end up in a brawl?</i>

685
00:46:40,049 --> 00:46:42,404
<i>I mean, you just never quite know</i>
<i>what's going to happen.</i>

686
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:44,002
<i>Or will they even make the show?</i>

687
00:46:44,089 --> 00:46:47,320
You go and see a show,
you talk to A&R people and say,

688
00:46:47,409 --> 00:46:51,721
"Oh, by the way, I flew down there and I saw
them and they're insane. They can't do it."

689
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:55,438
Too bad. We love them. We wish them
good luck but can't work with them.

690
00:46:55,529 --> 00:46:57,679
Are you gonna be a big waste of money?

691
00:46:57,769 --> 00:47:00,886
They dump all this money, you make
a record and then somebody kills....

692
00:47:00,969 --> 00:47:04,166
You guys kill each other
or split up or whatever?

693
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:18,805
MATT: <i>We've been driving since Detroit.</i>
<i>It's been quite a while.</i>

694
00:47:19,529 --> 00:47:23,488
<i>Been driving with</i>
<i>Dean and Anton in this car,</i>

695
00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:26,322
<i>trying to stay awake</i>
<i>and smoking a lot of grass</i>

696
00:47:26,409 --> 00:47:30,641
<i>and doing a lot of dope,</i>
<i>snorting China White.</i>

697
00:47:30,729 --> 00:47:34,608
-INTERVIEWER: How far are we going today?
-All the way, baby.

698
00:47:35,009 --> 00:47:39,605
Yeah, this is kind of nutty, you know.
Like, this is how bands break up.

699
00:47:39,689 --> 00:47:42,761
If they didn't know that.
Ours almost did, you know.

700
00:47:42,849 --> 00:47:44,123
Oh, gee.

701
00:47:44,209 --> 00:47:47,281
You get a pack of
fucking junkies on the road,

702
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:52,841
not eating much, drinking a lot,
doing dope and not sleeping,

703
00:47:52,929 --> 00:47:57,127
is anybody gonna get grumpy and irritable
and start fighting with each other at all?

704
00:47:57,209 --> 00:47:59,086
No, probably not.

705
00:47:59,169 --> 00:48:01,967
<i>It's not my tour</i>
<i>so I'm just having a good time.</i>

706
00:48:02,969 --> 00:48:04,687
<i>Can I get some reverb in the house?</i>

707
00:48:11,449 --> 00:48:12,928
All right.

708
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:20,597
I saw Dylan at Gertie's in 1963.

709
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,919
You know, I've been listening to this
for the last 35 years.

710
00:48:23,009 --> 00:48:26,558
These guys, whoever it is,
these guys have it. What's the name again?

711
00:48:26,649 --> 00:48:28,605
<i>-Brian Jones.... ?</i>
<i>-Town Massacre.</i>

712
00:48:28,689 --> 00:48:33,080
I saw this record, <i>Satanic Majesties,</i>
and I went home and listened to that record,

713
00:48:33,169 --> 00:48:36,161
probably about 100 times in a row,
and I was totally obsessed with it,

714
00:48:36,249 --> 00:48:38,888
and I didn't know
what the Brian Jonestown Massacre was.

715
00:48:38,969 --> 00:48:41,278
I didn't know if it was a new band
or an old band.

716
00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:43,883
<i>I didn't know if it was one person</i>
<i>or 100 people.</i>

717
00:48:43,969 --> 00:48:47,757
<i>I just loved this record and then saw in the</i>
<i>paper that they were playing three shows.</i>

718
00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:49,202
(WHOOPING AND CHEERING)

719
00:48:49,289 --> 00:48:50,768
You guys are great, man!

720
00:48:50,849 --> 00:48:52,646
And I went to all three shows.

721
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:56,722
<i>I'm having the greatest time of my life.</i>
<i>The first time I've ever been to New York.</i>

722
00:48:56,809 --> 00:49:00,688
ADAM: <i>On the third one I asked Peter Hayes,</i>
<i>who's now in Black Rebel Motorcycle Club,</i>

723
00:49:00,769 --> 00:49:03,920
<i>who was in the band at the time,</i>
<i>if he could introduce me to Anton.</i>

724
00:49:17,169 --> 00:49:21,879
I wanted to give Anton my number
so he could call me

725
00:49:21,969 --> 00:49:26,679
and I didn't have anything to write on
except for this card that I had in my wallet

726
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:28,441
of all my important phone numbers.

727
00:49:28,529 --> 00:49:32,158
I crossed out all my numbers. I wrote down
my number on there and gave it to him.

728
00:49:32,249 --> 00:49:35,047
I was like, "You're the only person
I need to talk to now."

729
00:49:39,249 --> 00:49:41,046
# ...inside

730
00:49:44,689 --> 00:49:48,762
# Won't beg you

731
00:49:50,369 --> 00:49:52,564
# Step inside

732
00:50:04,889 --> 00:50:07,562
# Let me take you down

733
00:50:07,649 --> 00:50:11,005
# To the place I'm going

734
00:50:16,449 --> 00:50:19,282
# More than treasures found

735
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:23,965
# It's just knowing you.... #

736
00:50:25,129 --> 00:50:27,563
I didn't know anything about their reputation

737
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,560
and I was like,
"Anyone who's making music this good

738
00:50:29,649 --> 00:50:32,402
"deserves to have a record deal
and deserves to be signed."

739
00:50:32,489 --> 00:50:34,639
<i>Hey, listen. Hey, Dennis.</i>

740
00:50:34,729 --> 00:50:37,607
<i>When people like you and Dave</i>
<i>that know us and are hanging out</i>

741
00:50:37,689 --> 00:50:40,442
<i>and fucking drunk guys</i>
<i>are hassling Matt in the front,</i>

742
00:50:40,529 --> 00:50:45,080
<i>you grab Matt or you grab a bouncer</i>
<i>or you grab the fucking drunk guy.</i>

743
00:50:45,169 --> 00:50:48,286
<i>I don't want no hassles out of people</i>
<i>like these leeches behind me</i>

744
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:51,202
<i>that fucking hang out</i>
<i>and don't do shit when you need it.</i>

745
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:54,520
I quit.
Anton is a great songwriter and an arranger,

746
00:50:54,609 --> 00:50:57,885
but he is so horrible in so many ways.

747
00:50:57,969 --> 00:51:02,326
I mean, we can talk about truths about me,
but luckily I'm not on trial and he is.

748
00:51:02,409 --> 00:51:06,163
-I won't. Who's on trial?
-Anton.

749
00:51:06,249 --> 00:51:08,365
-With who?
-That thing.

750
00:51:08,449 --> 00:51:10,405
He'll fire Dave on Easter Day.

751
00:51:10,489 --> 00:51:13,003
I've been sitting out here
in this damn van all day.

752
00:51:13,089 --> 00:51:16,525
I've been looking at all these penthouses
and all these gutters

753
00:51:16,609 --> 00:51:19,885
going eenie-meenie-minie-mo.

754
00:51:19,969 --> 00:51:21,322
It's really....

755
00:51:21,409 --> 00:51:25,288
Is Anton gonna be able to work something
out, get you guys back on the road?

756
00:51:25,369 --> 00:51:26,688
We're having the time of our life,

757
00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:30,398
the shows are getting better and better
and people are really going nuts.

758
00:51:30,529 --> 00:51:34,727
He's gonna totally try and negotiate
an immediate one-off record

759
00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:37,118
and, if he can advance us the money,
I'd go, "Cool."

760
00:51:37,209 --> 00:51:39,689
If I can get a third up front,
we'll buy a fucking van.

761
00:51:39,689 --> 00:51:41,008
Taxi!

762
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:45,767
COURTNEY: <i>The Brian Jonestown</i>
<i>left New York the next morning</i>

763
00:51:47,649 --> 00:51:51,005
<i>to play a round of shows in the South,</i>
<i>but only got as far as Homer, Georgia.</i>

764
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:54,922
How you doing?

765
00:51:55,009 --> 00:51:57,887
-Can I see your licence and insurance?
-Okay, it's hers.

766
00:51:57,969 --> 00:52:00,563
Okay. Well, need to see your licence anyway.

767
00:52:00,649 --> 00:52:02,128
-It got stolen.
-Huh?

768
00:52:02,209 --> 00:52:04,006
It got stolen in California. I'm on tour.

769
00:52:04,089 --> 00:52:06,603
-We're just gonna pick up a van....
-I have my licence, sir.

770
00:52:06,689 --> 00:52:09,681
She has all of her stuff.
We're making a documentary.

771
00:52:09,769 --> 00:52:11,043
Okay.

772
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:13,165
-What's your full name, son?
-My name's Anton.

773
00:52:13,249 --> 00:52:15,524
All right, pull over there
and let me run your licence.

774
00:52:15,609 --> 00:52:18,123
-Sure. Whereabouts?
-Just right over there anywhere.

775
00:52:18,209 --> 00:52:19,927
By this gentleman?

776
00:52:22,369 --> 00:52:24,121
How you doing today?

777
00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:31,044
Don't have anything illegal?
Any guns or drugs?

778
00:52:31,129 --> 00:52:33,768
No. You're welcome....
You can search the car right now.

779
00:52:33,849 --> 00:52:35,805
Okay. You don't have any problems
with a search?

780
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:38,084
No. In fact, I'll wave that right right now.

781
00:52:38,169 --> 00:52:41,127
-All right, would you step out of the vehicle?
-Sure.

782
00:52:41,769 --> 00:52:47,162
All the way, you know, from California,
Oklahoma, Minnesota, all that.

783
00:52:47,249 --> 00:52:49,843
This is, Georgia,
is the most beautiful state, I'd say.

784
00:52:49,929 --> 00:52:50,998
Really?

785
00:52:54,249 --> 00:52:55,568
Georgia.

786
00:52:55,649 --> 00:52:56,923
We're in Georgia.

787
00:52:57,009 --> 00:52:59,079
-Yeah, Banks....
-We're in Banks County?

788
00:52:59,169 --> 00:53:01,637
INTERVIEWER: And when's the gig tonight?

789
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:05,449
-When's the gig tonight?
-I don't know.

790
00:53:05,529 --> 00:53:08,680
I'm starting to figure
I shouldn't have come along for this ride.

791
00:53:08,809 --> 00:53:15,248
What I heard was, they searched the car
and there's weed and they get taken to jail.

792
00:53:15,329 --> 00:53:18,878
-I'm gonna advise you each of your rights.
-It's my own fault, whatever happens to me.

793
00:53:18,969 --> 00:53:20,402
But I consented to have a car search.

794
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:24,880
COURTNEY: <i>Anton was eventually bailed out</i>
<i>by Bomp! Records' Greg Shaw,</i>

795
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:27,244
<i>but the band broke up that night.</i>

796
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:31,402
<i>Anton played solo</i>
<i>all the way back to Los Angeles.</i>

797
00:53:32,729 --> 00:53:35,323
<i>The rest of The Warhols met up</i>
<i>with me in New York</i>

798
00:53:35,409 --> 00:53:37,843
<i>to play MTV and a few club shows.</i>

799
00:53:37,929 --> 00:53:42,923
<i>Weak album sales and an industry showcase</i>
<i>gone awry were kind of stressing us out.</i>

800
00:53:43,009 --> 00:53:45,921
It was the EMD Convention,
which is the distributors.

801
00:53:46,009 --> 00:53:50,082
All the retailers were there
from Europe, Japan, everything.

802
00:53:50,169 --> 00:53:53,639
We just sucked.
We just sounded like shit and I was just like,

803
00:53:53,729 --> 00:53:58,757
"Look, I'm not going to lie about it,
pretend we're rocking, man, feeling it."

804
00:53:58,889 --> 00:54:02,245
So I was like, "This sucks. This sounds like
fucking shit up here, you guys.

805
00:54:02,329 --> 00:54:03,921
"Can you just be patient for a minute?"

806
00:54:04,009 --> 00:54:06,443
Meanwhile, Girsh is in the back freaking out.

807
00:54:06,529 --> 00:54:09,805
"This is the fucking last time
they embarrass me, motherfuckers!"

808
00:54:09,889 --> 00:54:13,802
You know, how about, "Fuck you, man."
How about you get up on stage

809
00:54:13,889 --> 00:54:16,164
and fucking pull your pants down, you know.

810
00:54:16,249 --> 00:54:18,809
INTERVIEWER: But who was there?
Was it just like....

811
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:21,403
Industry, fucking huge industry.

812
00:54:22,169 --> 00:54:24,922
Everybody that Girsh
and those guys had said,

813
00:54:25,009 --> 00:54:27,523
"This is the Great White Hope.
This is the next huge band.

814
00:54:27,609 --> 00:54:29,486
"These guys are fucking amazing,
you know?"

815
00:54:31,729 --> 00:54:33,879
So, now, Japan's like, "Well, I don't know."

816
00:54:33,969 --> 00:54:37,325
Japanese guys are like,
"Maybe we'll put it out. Maybe we won't."

817
00:54:38,329 --> 00:54:41,799
The Dandy Warhols were
a very big popular band among A&R people.

818
00:54:42,049 --> 00:54:44,847
<i>I kept pulling up their SoundScans, too,</i>
<i>and I guess, you know,</i>

819
00:54:44,929 --> 00:54:47,397
<i>the A&R people were,</i>
<i>like, the only ones buying the record.</i>

820
00:54:47,489 --> 00:54:52,165
The record's SoundScan, first week,
at, what, below 3,000

821
00:54:52,249 --> 00:54:55,400
and has been dropping
for the two weeks since.

822
00:54:55,929 --> 00:54:58,921
<i>The Dandy Warhols are the reason</i>
<i>why people get laid off of record labels.</i>

823
00:54:59,009 --> 00:55:01,967
I think that people spend
so much money on these bands,

824
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:04,244
and they were making ridiculous videos,

825
00:55:04,329 --> 00:55:07,321
and, when it doesn't all pan out,
somebody's gotta pay for it, right?

826
00:55:07,409 --> 00:55:10,560
When you sign with a major label,
they always tell you things like,

827
00:55:10,649 --> 00:55:13,641
"You know, we're into careers, not hits."

828
00:55:14,329 --> 00:55:17,127
And you go,
"Wow, that's got a nice ring to it."

829
00:55:17,209 --> 00:55:19,484
Yet if you don't produce a hit,

830
00:55:19,569 --> 00:55:22,037
they don't really give a fuck
about your career, you know?

831
00:55:22,129 --> 00:55:26,327
ADAM: <i>Radio promotion costs</i>
<i>are ridiculously out of hand.</i>

832
00:55:26,409 --> 00:55:29,048
<i>Video costs are retarded.</i>

833
00:55:29,129 --> 00:55:31,882
<i>Executive salaries, expense accounts.</i>

834
00:55:31,969 --> 00:55:33,925
The music industry
is supposed to be this middleman

835
00:55:34,009 --> 00:55:35,283
between the artist and the consumer

836
00:55:35,369 --> 00:55:37,485
so that people can buy
the records that they like,

837
00:55:37,569 --> 00:55:42,085
but somehow the music industry
turned itself into this, like, evil beast

838
00:55:42,169 --> 00:55:45,764
that tries to screw the artists
and tries to screw the fans,

839
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:48,079
and it's really obvious.

840
00:55:48,169 --> 00:55:51,718
I have no respect for anyone working
for any major label

841
00:55:51,809 --> 00:55:55,040
in any capacity whatsoever in the executive.

842
00:55:55,129 --> 00:55:59,680
They're all liars.
They're all mediocre people with no talent.

843
00:55:59,769 --> 00:56:01,122
They don't know talent.

844
00:56:01,209 --> 00:56:04,963
They don't understand or like music
in any way whatsoever.

845
00:56:05,049 --> 00:56:08,086
I dread to think what they're like in bed
trying to have sex

846
00:56:08,169 --> 00:56:12,162
because, you know,
their mind and body are not connected.

847
00:56:12,249 --> 00:56:16,083
It's a fool's game to spend your life
blaming the record company.

848
00:56:16,169 --> 00:56:18,478
<i>Every label can break a band,</i>
<i>every label can't....</i>

849
00:56:18,569 --> 00:56:19,797
Ultimately it's in the band's hands,

850
00:56:19,889 --> 00:56:22,449
so anybody who thinks, like,
"Oh, now we've got a major deal.

851
00:56:22,529 --> 00:56:26,158
"We're home. We're safe.
We're gonna succeed." It's just bullshit.

852
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:29,366
Record companies screw up virtually
everything they possibly can screw up,

853
00:56:29,449 --> 00:56:31,326
not because they intend to, but that's just....

854
00:56:31,409 --> 00:56:34,287
It's probably the nature
of all corporate organisations.

855
00:56:34,369 --> 00:56:37,839
Major labels lose money
on nine out of ten records,

856
00:56:37,929 --> 00:56:39,726
and they have one record out of ten

857
00:56:39,809 --> 00:56:41,686
that makes enough money
to cover everything,

858
00:56:41,769 --> 00:56:45,125
and I don't think
there's another business in the world

859
00:56:45,209 --> 00:56:49,521
where you can have a 90% failure rate,
and still say you're successful.

860
00:56:49,609 --> 00:56:52,248
It's crazy. You should be able to make money
off every record.

861
00:56:52,329 --> 00:56:53,921
You just have to spend accordingly.

862
00:56:54,009 --> 00:56:56,603
lndie rock happened because of this.

863
00:56:56,689 --> 00:57:00,728
You know, because of what
we have experienced being on a major label.

864
00:57:00,809 --> 00:57:03,642
What every major label says
won't happen to you.

865
00:57:03,729 --> 00:57:08,883
They won't tell you what single to put out.
They won't pick your, like, pop song.

866
00:57:08,969 --> 00:57:13,759
I mean, that's just bad advertising
for the band, you know? Fucking clowns.

867
00:57:13,849 --> 00:57:16,886
If I had only been just a little bit smarter,
you know?

868
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:20,484
I mean, we're at a level where people
are getting to know it and acquire the music.

869
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:22,002
That hasn't been done from being signed.

870
00:57:22,089 --> 00:57:25,081
That hasn't been done
through your Buzz Bin video or anything.

871
00:57:25,169 --> 00:57:27,763
That's been done all on our own.
You're on the cover of magazines,

872
00:57:27,849 --> 00:57:31,364
not because of some suit is backing it
with his bread like everybody else.

873
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:33,519
We're there because
we get there on our own,

874
00:57:33,609 --> 00:57:35,998
and that is the vibe we exist on.

875
00:57:36,089 --> 00:57:38,922
I've been trying to talk Perry
into signing them for a long time.

876
00:57:39,009 --> 00:57:41,762
Like, look, this is the last real
rock'n'roll band,

877
00:57:41,849 --> 00:57:44,443
and they're fucking awesome.
They make great records, you know?

878
00:57:44,529 --> 00:57:47,566
You couldn't do anything, you know,

879
00:57:47,649 --> 00:57:50,368
like trying to control what happens
or anything like that.

880
00:57:50,649 --> 00:57:53,288
But just give them money.
They'll make great records,

881
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:54,927
put them out on the road,
and they'll do great.

882
00:57:55,009 --> 00:57:57,967
COURTNEY: <i>Before their first American tour</i>
<i>went south literally,</i>

883
00:57:58,049 --> 00:58:00,279

<i>had managed to attract</i>

884
00:58:00,369 --> 00:58:02,599

885
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:06,523
<i>Capitol may have finally listened to me</i>

<i>to represent him at the meeting,</i>

887
00:58:09,409 --> 00:58:11,764
<i>but Anton blew the deal within an hour.</i>

888
00:58:11,849 --> 00:58:14,886
I thought he was more together
when I first met him.

889
00:58:15,089 --> 00:58:18,001
He gave that illusion for a period of a week.

890
00:58:18,089 --> 00:58:20,080
I think, Anton, if he could really focus,

891
00:58:20,169 --> 00:58:22,478
could be in that elite group of people

892
00:58:22,569 --> 00:58:25,879
with, you know,
Lennon, McCartney, you know, Bob Dylan.

COURTNEY: <i>Meanwhile, Adam Shore</i>
<i>convinced TVT Records,</i>

894

<i>the largest indie label in America,</i>

895
00:58:30,809 --> 00:58:33,448

<i>was the best band in the country.</i>

896

<i>manic behaviour would again blow the deal,</i>

897
00:58:37,449 --> 00:58:40,009

898
00:58:40,649 --> 00:58:46,042
I've arrived in New York City.
I'm going to swanksville here.

899
00:58:47,569 --> 00:58:48,718

900
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:53,760
-Did you meet Joel?
-Yeah.

901
00:58:53,849 --> 00:58:57,637
Anton's got an ear infection,
and, this morning, we had to switch them up.

902
00:58:57,729 --> 00:59:02,041
He was just, he was not feeling like himself,
and the doctors were a little worried.

903
00:59:02,169 --> 00:59:04,399
I don't know, he said,
at one point or another,

904
00:59:04,489 --> 00:59:06,764
he got in some kind of accident
with his ears.

905
00:59:06,849 --> 00:59:11,001
COURTNEY: <i>The TVT execs seemed to buy</i>
<i>Dutcher's story about Anton's earache,</i>

906
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,159
<i>and Joel charmed them over dinner.</i>

-Two points off.
-Is that bad?

<i>we're gonna have any problems.</i>

Okay, Anton, I'm going to pick up the phone,
and then Steve's leaving.

924

<i>100% sure of,</i>

928
01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:14,318
<i>the Brian Jonestown Massacre</i>
<i>can make records.</i>

929
01:00:14,409 --> 01:00:18,197
They've made five records in two years,
and more and more and more.

930
01:00:18,289 --> 01:00:21,326
You almost have to stop them from making
records. They're making so many.

931
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:24,162
We're a record company,
so all we have to do is put out their records.

932
01:00:24,249 --> 01:00:27,082
Elektra and Sire and Apple
and all these labels,

933

You know, it's like, I like this band.
I brought the band and the CDs to my boss.

935
01:00:35,649 --> 01:00:38,607
He really liked it,
and within three weeks we had a deal.

936

You know, it's done. It's so easy.

937
01:00:40,609 --> 01:00:42,804
Like, why is everybody so scared?
What's the problem?

938
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:46,962
-That is your first signing?
-Yes. Yes.

939
01:00:47,529 --> 01:00:50,601
You know what? It's very easy.
Everyone should try it.

940
01:00:51,889 --> 01:00:52,878
Hi.

941
01:00:53,169 --> 01:00:55,364
You guys have no idea
who I just became yesterday.

942
01:00:55,449 --> 01:00:57,565
-Who?
-I'm very big. Very big.

943
01:00:57,649 --> 01:00:58,638
What?

944
01:00:59,009 --> 01:01:03,161
They don't want just Anton.
They want Anton, and myself, and yourself.

945
01:01:04,689 --> 01:01:08,807
And that's all right, you know? That's
a whole different gig, you know, by contract.

946
01:01:09,929 --> 01:01:13,763
Adam's really scared about what the fuck
is this between you guys and the Dandys?

947
01:01:13,849 --> 01:01:17,046
Yeah, I tried to explain it to him.
The history and whatnot.

948
01:01:17,129 --> 01:01:20,838
He's like, "I can't believe you're playing,
like, the Beatles versus the Stones gig

949
01:01:20,929 --> 01:01:23,648
"when you guys are, like,
so much better than them

950
01:01:23,729 --> 01:01:26,482
"and you're gonna totally transcend them
like lickety-split."

951
01:01:26,569 --> 01:01:30,357
And it's like, well, you know,
yeah, you know they're target number one,

952
01:01:30,449 --> 01:01:33,486
and then we'll move on, and from there
we'll go to Oasis, you know, whatever.

953
01:01:33,569 --> 01:01:36,242
They're just the first in the line, you know,

954
01:01:36,329 --> 01:01:39,127
that's kind of the whole gig,
you know what I mean?

955
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,804
I keep hearing little things in the press.

956
01:01:41,889 --> 01:01:47,202
There's just little mentions that....
You know, they'd be dissing us,

957
01:01:47,289 --> 01:01:49,200
and it's just like, why?

958
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:51,519
Just didn't understand

959
01:01:51,609 --> 01:01:56,683
that, supposedly, it was a rivalry
that they were trying to start up to get press,

960
01:01:57,129 --> 01:02:00,758
but they didn't tell us that,
so it was just sort of insulting.

961
01:02:00,969 --> 01:02:04,245
Well, this is a special little present
from our dear friend Anton.

962
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:09,164
We were in San Francisco, and we're playing
a show at the Purple Onion,

963
01:02:09,249 --> 01:02:11,763
and he just drove by in a truck,

964
01:02:12,089 --> 01:02:15,604
and I just happened to be outside,
and he said, "Here, here's a present for you.

965
01:02:15,689 --> 01:02:18,408
"I'll see you in a month. I'm going to lndia."

966
01:02:19,049 --> 01:02:21,358
There's a whole bunch of fun stuff in here.

967
01:02:21,449 --> 01:02:27,001
This lovely bar of soap
came attached to this nice little card

968
01:02:28,289 --> 01:02:31,122
with a little message, "Clean up your act!"

969
01:02:32,409 --> 01:02:34,127
"Courtney Taylor, surrender!"

970
01:02:36,609 --> 01:02:42,127
I was with Eric and we each found
these little things in here

971
01:02:42,809 --> 01:02:44,765
with individual names on them.

972
01:02:44,849 --> 01:02:46,441
Well, they're shotgun shells.

973
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:51,398
Mark Eiger had a restraining order
taken out against Anton.

974
01:02:51,489 --> 01:02:53,320
He's stalking us now.

975
01:02:54,049 --> 01:02:56,324
Making phone calls to Courtney's room...

976
01:02:56,409 --> 01:02:58,445
-Did you hear that, Bob...
-...in the morning.

977
01:02:58,529 --> 01:03:01,839
...Mike, and Heather
are trying to get them off the CMJ show.

978

INTERVIEWER:
Do you get tired of driving around?

979
01:03:03,649 --> 01:03:07,403
Yeah, I don't.... I mean, I feel bad
for everybody else in the band,

980
01:03:07,489 --> 01:03:12,005
but it's like,
I can't have Anton the insane guy....

981
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:16,799
I will not have him anywhere near me again
as much as I can avoid it.

982
01:03:16,889 --> 01:03:20,882
I will not share dressing rooms
with him or back-stages. Anything.

983
01:03:20,969 --> 01:03:22,800
I'll still buy their albums, though.

984
01:03:23,209 --> 01:03:24,767

tonight, Greg?

988
01:03:34,929 --> 01:03:36,840
We're going down to this stupid club

989
01:03:36,929 --> 01:03:38,999
to hang out in front of the place
and annoy people

990
01:03:39,089 --> 01:03:43,287
to show them just how lame we think
CMJ and the entire music industry is.

991
01:03:43,369 --> 01:03:47,442
You mean.... I can't possibly know that....

992

Hey. Go in back seat or the trunk, man.

995

Whoa, that was dumb.

998
01:04:13,529 --> 01:04:15,918
-If you have a stamp, you can get in.
-All right.

999
01:04:17,169 --> 01:04:23,039
I want him out of the building....
with the furry hat. Yes, he's not getting in.

-Thank you.

1004
01:04:46,089 --> 01:04:48,683
Sir? Capitol?

1005
01:04:48,849 --> 01:04:51,317
-Ready? Are you from Capitol?
-Er, no.

1006
01:04:51,409 --> 01:04:52,637
Take this anyways.

1007
01:04:52,729 --> 01:04:55,402
<i>Not If You're the Last Dandy on Earth.</i>
You two will never meet.

1008
01:04:55,489 --> 01:04:56,478
Take it anyways.

1009
01:04:56,569 --> 01:04:58,241
How did you get Jason Cropper's badge?

1010
01:04:58,329 --> 01:04:59,842
-Because you know what?
-He loves you?

1011
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:01,965
No, I'm the Son of God.
I take whatever I need.

1012
01:05:02,049 --> 01:05:03,926
That's how you got it there?

1013
01:05:04,009 --> 01:05:07,046
-Hey, Jackie.
-Fine.

1014
01:05:07,609 --> 01:05:09,679
-Keep this.
-All right.

1015
01:05:10,049 --> 01:05:13,519
-This is the Brian Jonestown Massacre.
-Oh, really?

1016
01:05:13,729 --> 01:05:16,163
This is the hot new single,
<i>Not If You're the Last Dandy on Earth.</i>

1017
01:05:16,249 --> 01:05:17,318
Oh, I was confused.

1018
01:05:17,409 --> 01:05:19,843
-INTERVIEWER: What do you think?
-About what?

1019
01:05:19,929 --> 01:05:21,282
Of the 12-inch.

1020
01:05:21,769 --> 01:05:23,043
I think it's great.

1021
01:05:27,969 --> 01:05:30,802
I read it wrong.
I thought he wanted to kill us all,

1022
01:05:30,889 --> 01:05:33,847
but he's actually someone else,
some secret alter-ego.

1023
01:05:40,409 --> 01:05:42,161
Did you see them, our signed copies?

1024
01:05:42,249 --> 01:05:46,800
It's his, like, little ideal. We could get this
whole Blur-Oasis thing going, you know?

1025
01:05:47,289 --> 01:05:51,123
Yeah, maybe if both our bands were selling,
like, five million records.

1026
01:05:51,209 --> 01:05:53,518
He was like,
"You don't even understand the....

1027
01:05:53,609 --> 01:05:55,918
"You don't realise how much money
I've gotten for us."

1028
01:05:56,009 --> 01:05:58,443
-Give me my cut.
-"I would never wanna hurt you, Zia.

1029
01:05:58,529 --> 01:06:01,601
"If I wanted to kill you guys,
I would have already did it."

1030
01:06:01,689 --> 01:06:04,009
-Great. All right, then.
-That's good to know.

1031
01:06:04,009 --> 01:06:04,998
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1032
01:06:05,729 --> 01:06:06,844
Come in.

1033
01:06:07,729 --> 01:06:09,242
-How are you?
-Good. How are you?

1034
01:06:09,329 --> 01:06:12,639
-I'm doing dandy. How are you?
-Thank you very much.

1035
01:06:13,609 --> 01:06:16,567
<i>"Not If You Were the Last Dandy on Earth."</i>
That's dandy.

1036
01:06:16,649 --> 01:06:18,367
-Cheers.
-Thank you.

1037
01:06:18,449 --> 01:06:19,962
No problem, sir. Goodnight.

1038
01:06:21,169 --> 01:06:23,399
I gave him $300 in tips today.

1039
01:06:23,969 --> 01:06:27,564
I told her it's $900
without tipping anybody in drinks.

1040
01:06:28,169 --> 01:06:30,842
If I charged $900 in tips
and then plus my drinks,

1041
01:06:30,929 --> 01:06:34,046
what do you think they're gonna say?

1042
01:06:34,249 --> 01:06:36,399
They're gonna say,
"You're not allowed on our label anymore

1043
01:06:36,489 --> 01:06:40,164
"because you charge $32,000 in tips."

1044
01:06:40,409 --> 01:06:42,400
Anton, this is Steve Gottlieb.

1045
01:06:42,729 --> 01:06:44,367
-How you doing?
-Anton, good to meet you.

1046
01:06:44,449 --> 01:06:45,962
This is Greg Shaw from Bomp!

1047
01:06:46,329 --> 01:06:47,648
-Greg Shaw.
-Hi, Greg.

1048
01:06:47,729 --> 01:06:49,879
Anton from the Brian Jonestown Massacre.

1049
01:06:49,969 --> 01:06:51,687
Hey, how you doing?

1050
01:06:51,769 --> 01:06:54,841
Hey, guess what?
Can you put them on hold for one second?

1051
01:06:57,009 --> 01:07:00,319
I will make you a shit-load of money.
You too, mister. You too, all right?

1052
01:07:00,409 --> 01:07:02,604
Go right ahead
and make all the money you want.

1053
01:07:02,689 --> 01:07:05,647
Okay, you're gonna need a backpack
or a duffle bag to carry this.

1054
01:07:05,729 --> 01:07:06,923
All right?

1055
01:07:07,049 --> 01:07:08,243
-Accounting?
-Yeah.

1056
01:07:08,329 --> 01:07:09,478
You guys handle the numbers?

1057
01:07:09,569 --> 01:07:10,968
-Brian?
-Guess what?

1058
01:07:11,049 --> 01:07:13,483
You're gonna have to be counting
a lot more money

1059
01:07:13,569 --> 01:07:17,278
because I'm gonna be making you a shit-load
of money, all right? Are you guys ready?

1060
01:07:17,369 --> 01:07:20,167
I'm not trying to, like,
jack you for everything that I can get.

1061
01:07:20,249 --> 01:07:21,602
It's quite the opposite, you know?

1062
01:07:21,689 --> 01:07:25,238
I turned down bigger things to do this
because I'm hoping that freedom

1063
01:07:25,329 --> 01:07:27,001
translates into something better.

1064
01:07:27,089 --> 01:07:29,887
I can play 80 instruments,
and I produce the records, right?

1065
01:07:29,969 --> 01:07:31,880
-But do you play an accordion?
-Yes, I do.

1066
01:07:31,969 --> 01:07:33,561
-You do?
-A didgeridoo?

1067
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:36,083
I play all that stuff.
Weird fucking Chinese shit I play.

1068
01:07:36,169 --> 01:07:39,844
There was never another artist on TVT
before or after

1069
01:07:39,929 --> 01:07:43,319
that had more excitement inside the label.

1070
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:51,840
The people who worked there
were so excited to work the record,

1071
01:07:51,929 --> 01:07:54,841
and they convinced
the music industry at large

1072
01:07:54,929 --> 01:07:57,568
that the Brian Jonestown Massacre
were the next great thing.

1073
01:08:02,609 --> 01:08:06,807
# I walked to New York and back from LA

1074
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:11,720
# I lived on a mountain and once by the bay

1075
01:08:12,009 --> 01:08:16,764
# I bought an apartment
and I slept in the hay

1076
01:08:17,089 --> 01:08:20,479
# But there's no place that's softer than.... #

1077
01:08:21,209 --> 01:08:22,608
Definitely not an act.

1078
01:08:22,689 --> 01:08:27,046
<i>If he wasn't playing music,</i>
<i>it's not like he would get another job.</i>

1079
01:08:27,129 --> 01:08:29,597
It's not like he's like,
"Okay, this music thing isn't working out,

1080
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:33,762
"I'm gonna go, like, work in an office."
Like, Anton can only do this one thing.

1081
01:08:33,849 --> 01:08:36,682
He is for real. What he's doing is for real.

1082
01:08:41,609 --> 01:08:45,966
# I prayed to Buddha, to Allah and Jim.

1083
01:08:46,529 --> 01:08:50,807
# I turned to Jesus and stayed there with him

1084
01:08:51,449 --> 01:08:55,886
# I fell in deep but I learnt how to swim

1085
01:08:55,969 --> 01:09:01,566
# Now there's nobody cleaner
than me or than him #

1086
01:09:08,969 --> 01:09:12,439
COURTNEY: <i>Unlike America,</i>
<i>European radio actually played our record.</i>

1087
01:09:12,529 --> 01:09:16,647
<i>Only days after its release, the album</i>
<i>was topping the charts in several countries.</i>

1088
01:09:16,729 --> 01:09:19,482
<i>Eric, our drummer,</i>
<i>had quit the band two weeks before,</i>

1089
01:09:19,569 --> 01:09:21,924
<i>so I brought my cousin Brent</i>
<i>to London instead.</i>

1090
01:09:22,009 --> 01:09:25,285
<i>Eric had wanted more of my songwriting</i>
<i>royalties, and I had refused.</i>

1091
01:09:26,049 --> 01:09:29,246
"I don't think about you, I think about me.
This is a business."

1092
01:09:30,289 --> 01:09:31,278
Oh.

1093
01:09:31,769 --> 01:09:34,681
Really? I write all the songs.

1094
01:09:35,329 --> 01:09:38,048
All the songs. I produce the records.

1095
01:09:38,369 --> 01:09:40,724
All the records, you know?

1096
01:09:41,089 --> 01:09:42,920
I do everything.

1097
01:09:43,489 --> 01:09:44,478
And....

1098
01:09:44,729 --> 01:09:47,607
And yet, I'm giving away half
of my songwriting money?

1099
01:09:47,689 --> 01:09:49,168
Half of it.

1100
01:09:49,489 --> 01:09:54,040
So that the band can pay rent, and have fun,
and enjoy it, you know.

1101
01:09:54,969 --> 01:09:56,607
And that's not enough?

1102
01:09:56,689 --> 01:09:58,202
Are you fucking stupid?

1103
01:09:58,289 --> 01:10:01,201
He said,
"We're going to Europe in two weeks".

1104
01:10:01,289 --> 01:10:04,167
And he says, "Do you think you can learn
all of our songs in two weeks?"

1105
01:10:04,249 --> 01:10:06,888
And I said, "Are you going to make me
sing already?" And he stops.

1106
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:10,678
He says, "Yeah, 'cause if you can't sing
there's no real reason for you to be here.

1107
01:10:10,769 --> 01:10:13,363
"'Cause, you know, we'll go out
and get a drink if you can't sing."

1108
01:10:14,209 --> 01:10:17,201
Stockholm to Madrid.
There's gonna be a bus.

1109
01:10:31,569 --> 01:10:35,960
# You were getting older
I was getting wiser.... #

1110
01:10:36,409 --> 01:10:40,084
We are not a heavy airplay band, you know,
we don't get the kind of airplay

1111
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:43,718
that Green Day got
or the Spice Girls, you know.

1112
01:10:43,809 --> 01:10:48,121
But it's mostly in America because here
in Europe you've got a lot of airplay, mostly.

1113
01:10:48,209 --> 01:10:49,198
Do we?

1114
01:10:49,289 --> 01:10:53,487
# You get what you got and you
learn how to like it #

1115
01:10:55,809 --> 01:10:58,642
You know our record
is number 16 in the UK?

1116
01:10:58,729 --> 01:11:01,846
That's pretty incredible.
Our tour was sold out.

1117
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:03,044
Brussels.

1118
01:11:03,369 --> 01:11:05,803
Copenhagen. We love it!

1119
01:11:05,889 --> 01:11:07,607
Stockholm. Malmö.

1120
01:11:07,689 --> 01:11:09,759
Madrid. Barcelona.

1121
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:11,521
Hello, we love it.

1122
01:11:11,609 --> 01:11:12,928
It's gone ballistic.

1123
01:11:13,009 --> 01:11:18,208
Erm, I've got some press cuttings in my bag
to look at, and it's gone a bit mad.

1124
01:11:18,289 --> 01:11:20,883
Everybody suddenly knows
who The Dandy Warhols are.

1125
01:11:20,969 --> 01:11:23,608
MAN: Tickets for tonight, buy or sell tickets.

1126
01:11:24,289 --> 01:11:26,928
Tickets, Dandy Warhols.

1127
01:11:31,289 --> 01:11:35,885
# Darling, you give me a rope

1128
01:11:35,969 --> 01:11:38,802
# I'll hang myself

1129
01:11:38,889 --> 01:11:41,528
# It doesn't take a genius

1130
01:11:41,609 --> 01:11:44,169
# To figure it out #

1131
01:11:53,529 --> 01:11:55,440
Including our parents?

1132
01:11:57,129 --> 01:11:58,118
WOMAN: Yeah.

1133
01:11:59,369 --> 01:12:01,166
-Exactly.
-And in England?

1134
01:12:01,249 --> 01:12:02,477
<i>About the same number.</i>

1135
01:12:03,289 --> 01:12:05,086
<i>40,000 something.</i>

1136
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:09,049
That's over a year in America,

1137
01:12:09,129 --> 01:12:12,644
and that took a little under two weeks
in England.

1138
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:15,038
COURTNEY: <i>Our tour was running</i>
<i>very smoothly</i>

1139
01:12:15,129 --> 01:12:17,848
<i>until a surprise visit by the French police.</i>

1140
01:12:29,409 --> 01:12:30,808
Yeah.

1141
01:12:30,889 --> 01:12:32,880
Courtney, the special box.

1142
01:12:33,969 --> 01:12:37,120
For where you smoke cocaine,
your special box.

1143
01:12:37,209 --> 01:12:38,801
Cannabis arrest.

1144
01:12:40,169 --> 01:12:44,082
I thought he was being real tricky,
like I was going to just fess up, you know....

1145
01:12:44,969 --> 01:12:47,881
COURTNEY:
<i>My band got away with paying a fine</i>

1146
01:12:47,969 --> 01:12:51,484
<i>equivalent to four Dandy Warhols t-shirts.</i>

1147
01:12:51,889 --> 01:12:54,608
<i>And we kept the grass.</i>

1148
01:12:55,729 --> 01:12:59,927
We are a lucky band
and they are a not lucky band.

1149
01:13:00,929 --> 01:13:04,604
Look what happens they get pulled over
by the police

1150
01:13:05,289 --> 01:13:07,007
in Georgia, or wherever it was.

1151
01:13:07,089 --> 01:13:10,126
<i>And look what happened when</i>
<i>we got pulled over by the police in France.</i>

1152
01:13:10,209 --> 01:13:11,198
<i>That's lucky.</i>

1153
01:13:11,289 --> 01:13:13,962
'Cause we could have had,
it could have all ended right there.

1154
01:13:14,049 --> 01:13:17,121
Not the band's career, but that tour.

1155
01:13:18,129 --> 01:13:20,484
If you were going to be
on the <i>Jerry Springer Show,</i>

1156
01:13:20,569 --> 01:13:22,048
what would your topic be?

1157
01:13:22,129 --> 01:13:23,801
And who would they invite on to slap you?

1158
01:13:23,889 --> 01:13:25,766
What is it? The Brian Jonestown Massacre?

1159
01:13:26,409 --> 01:13:28,445
"Stop stalking me."

1160
01:13:29,969 --> 01:13:32,688
"Write songs about some....
About your own fucking band."

1161
01:13:33,009 --> 01:13:34,840
They'd have that. Would that be the episode?

1162
01:13:34,969 --> 01:13:36,880
And then they'd have
The Brian Jonestown Massacre on.

1163
01:13:36,969 --> 01:13:38,607
And who is it? Who is this guy, now?

1164
01:13:38,729 --> 01:13:43,280
They're this band, they're great,
and they're really good friends of ours.

1165
01:13:43,369 --> 01:13:46,281
They're just, kind of,
not very well-adjusted people.

1166
01:13:46,369 --> 01:13:48,280
They're not right in the head.

1167
01:13:48,849 --> 01:13:51,079
It's kind of sad
to see them be so dysfunctional.

1168
01:13:51,169 --> 01:13:53,046
'Cause the potential.

1169
01:13:53,129 --> 01:13:56,041
Like, they're like <i>The Velvet Underground</i>
of the '90s.

1170
01:13:58,449 --> 01:14:01,566
COURTNEY: <i>By this time, Anton had set up</i>
<i>a really impressive home studio</i>

1171
01:14:01,649 --> 01:14:03,765
<i>with his recording budget from TVT.</i>

1172
01:14:03,849 --> 01:14:06,522
<i>He had his band around him again</i>
<i>and he was excited.</i>

1173
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:09,282
<i>Ready to begin his career as a signed artist.</i>

1174
01:14:10,649 --> 01:14:14,767
<i>Instead of renting a studio</i>
<i>and hiring a producer,</i>

1175
01:14:15,609 --> 01:14:18,169
<i>something I'm really proud of is</i>
<i>we bought Anton a studio</i>

1176
01:14:18,249 --> 01:14:19,284
<i>so he could do it himself.</i>

1177
01:14:19,369 --> 01:14:23,681
And not only that, but so he could
continually make music on his own, forever.

1178
01:14:23,769 --> 01:14:27,125
-This is a whole studio, right here?
-This is a whole recording studio.

1179
01:14:27,209 --> 01:14:31,122
COURTNEY: <i>The TVT deal got Anton</i>
<i>worldwide exposure as well.</i>

1180
01:14:31,409 --> 01:14:33,400
<i>We couldn't believe it when we heard</i>

1181
01:14:33,489 --> 01:14:35,366
<i>that they had been invited to Tokyo</i>
<i>to play some shows.</i>

1182
01:14:39,889 --> 01:14:42,608
There were a bunch of girls,
"Brian Jonestown Massacre".

1183
01:14:43,089 --> 01:14:46,843
And like, he was talking to them
and they started to cry and stuff.

1184
01:14:46,929 --> 01:14:47,964
And then they laughed.

1185
01:14:51,529 --> 01:14:54,248
# I may not know how you feel

1186
01:14:59,969 --> 01:15:01,846
# Desire

1187
01:15:03,689 --> 01:15:07,045
# I hope it's waiting for you

1188
01:15:09,889 --> 01:15:13,165
# You should be thinking of you

1189
01:15:16,009 --> 01:15:19,399
# You took your plan into town

1190
01:15:21,969 --> 01:15:25,325
# I could believe in you

1191
01:15:28,009 --> 01:15:31,558
# But baby you're not around

1192
01:15:43,729 --> 01:15:47,005
# Now there's nowhere to run #

1193
01:15:47,489 --> 01:15:49,366
That was so cool.

1194
01:15:49,449 --> 01:15:50,928
Anton jolly good!

1195
01:15:51,009 --> 01:15:53,364
-Anton?
-Cool!

1196
01:15:54,209 --> 01:15:55,324
-Nice to meet you.
-Anton.

1197
01:15:55,569 --> 01:15:56,763
COURTNEY: <i>The feeling of hope</i>

1198
01:15:56,849 --> 01:15:59,522
<i>that The Brian Jonestown Massacre</i>
<i>had had in Japan</i>

1199
01:15:59,609 --> 01:16:02,442
<i>died upon their arrival back in Los Angeles.</i>

1200
01:16:02,649 --> 01:16:04,765
<i>Anton started using heroin heavily</i>

1201
01:16:04,849 --> 01:16:08,159
<i>as he was supposed to start making his</i>
<i>most important record yet.</i>

1202
01:16:08,249 --> 01:16:11,161
Yo, dude, it's going to be interesting
how our record comes out

1203
01:16:11,249 --> 01:16:14,798
versus, like, The Dandys' approach
to everything like that.

1204
01:16:14,889 --> 01:16:15,958
Like how they did their shit.

1205
01:16:16,049 --> 01:16:18,199
WOMAN: How did they do their shit
versus how you do yours?

1206
01:16:18,289 --> 01:16:19,438
They had, you know,

1207
01:16:19,529 --> 01:16:21,247
a producer and they went to his studio

1208
01:16:21,329 --> 01:16:23,638
and that guy ended up getting more
gear for his studio.

1209
01:16:23,769 --> 01:16:25,521
Courtney got whatever, you know.

1210
01:16:26,609 --> 01:16:28,406
Tickets to go to Loveline and shit.

1211
01:16:28,489 --> 01:16:31,561
Didn't you see this?
How we got nominated for

1212
01:16:32,409 --> 01:16:36,368
the California music awards
for outstanding independent album.

1213
01:16:36,449 --> 01:16:38,883
Look at that, The Brian Jonestown Massacre.

1214
01:16:39,089 --> 01:16:43,367
The industry's thing's just negative
whenever I'm kind of down, you know?

1215
01:16:43,449 --> 01:16:45,007
Like loaded or something.

1216
01:16:45,089 --> 01:16:47,603
I take all these bad feelings, and then just...

1217
01:16:47,689 --> 01:16:49,725
put it into music, you know?

1218
01:16:49,809 --> 01:16:51,925
I let people interpret it how they will.

1219
01:16:52,209 --> 01:16:55,440
I regret the fact that I didn't know

1220
01:16:56,489 --> 01:17:00,721
how far gone Anton was in the beginning.

1221
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:02,721
You know, I realise now that,

1222
01:17:02,809 --> 01:17:06,040
sort of, I walked into a sort of a MASH unit,
you know?

1223
01:17:06,129 --> 01:17:07,881
And I'm working in triage.

1224
01:17:07,969 --> 01:17:12,645
You know, I had to put as many pieces
together to keep it working as I could.

1225
01:17:12,969 --> 01:17:15,927
<i>By December I realised he was</i>
<i>in no shape to make a record.</i>

1226
01:17:16,009 --> 01:17:17,681
I mean he couldn't get it done.

1227
01:17:18,449 --> 01:17:20,644
<i>And then we had to enlist the help of Muddy.</i>

1228
01:17:20,729 --> 01:17:21,923
Yeah, hi.

1229
01:17:23,169 --> 01:17:26,605
We need to rent a DA-38 or a DA-88

1230
01:17:26,849 --> 01:17:29,841
in the next, you know, five minutes.

1231
01:17:30,129 --> 01:17:33,041
Hey, you have Courtney's telephone number,
tell Courtney to call me.

1232
01:17:33,129 --> 01:17:34,198
I think Courtney's in Europe.

1233
01:17:34,289 --> 01:17:37,565
-Oh, really? He's playing, huh?
-I don't know, I didn't talk to him.

1234
01:17:38,089 --> 01:17:41,559
Fuck, I wonder when I'm going to hang out
with that guy? Probably never, huh?

1235
01:17:41,649 --> 01:17:46,439
He hates us anyways.
You know that? I'm sure of it now.

1236
01:17:46,529 --> 01:17:49,043
We'll never, ever play
with those guys again, I bet.

1237
01:17:49,369 --> 01:17:50,722
-Unless it's a part of like....
-MAN: Who?

1238
01:17:50,809 --> 01:17:54,245
The Dandy Warhols. Unless it's part of like
such KROQ Christmas fucking thing.

1239
01:17:54,329 --> 01:17:56,206
And he can't get out of it.

1240
01:17:56,289 --> 01:17:58,200
(BRITISH ACCENT) "We're fucking Oasis,

1241
01:17:58,289 --> 01:18:00,120
"and we're gonna
fucking take over the world."

1242
01:18:00,529 --> 01:18:02,918
COURTNEY: <i>Spirits were still good in the</i>
<i>backrooms of the house,</i>

1243
01:18:03,009 --> 01:18:05,682
<i>as the clock ticked on the</i>
<i>recording process up front.</i>

1244
01:18:05,769 --> 01:18:09,967
<i>But it was floundering under the weight</i>
<i>of constant drug abuse and fighting.</i>

1245
01:18:10,489 --> 01:18:11,717
Okay, that's it.

1246
01:18:13,049 --> 01:18:14,528
I know it's a party back here

1247
01:18:14,609 --> 01:18:16,998
but I may have to ask you guys
to go outside or go

1248
01:18:17,089 --> 01:18:19,683
because there's no way we can record,
you guys are just too loud.

1249
01:18:19,769 --> 01:18:21,999
Good God, man, we had no idea
you were recording.

1250
01:18:22,089 --> 01:18:23,408
We are recording.

1251
01:18:23,489 --> 01:18:25,002
We're going into the house.

1252
01:18:25,809 --> 01:18:28,642
It's a great sound of all these

1253
01:18:28,769 --> 01:18:31,886
hundreds of instruments,
because that's the beauty of Anton.

1254
01:18:32,049 --> 01:18:33,277
He loves music.

1255
01:18:33,489 --> 01:18:36,049
He had every possible instrument
you could think about.

1256
01:18:36,169 --> 01:18:38,285
He had it there and they were playing it.

1257
01:18:38,369 --> 01:18:42,840
But, he walked into the house
and he just felt like death was everywhere.

1258
01:18:43,449 --> 01:18:46,088
It was just a smack house.

1259
01:18:46,209 --> 01:18:47,562
It was reeking of death.

1260
01:18:47,649 --> 01:18:50,243
And I thought that was the last time
I would actually see them.

1261
01:18:50,329 --> 01:18:52,843
There's so much of our shit
that has to be done now.

1262
01:18:52,929 --> 01:18:53,964
Is it really a lot?

1263
01:18:54,049 --> 01:18:56,358
Well, a lot of the music
doesn't sound done to me.

1264
01:18:56,449 --> 01:18:57,882
COURTNEY: <i>You know, if it weren't for Matt,</i>

1265
01:18:57,969 --> 01:18:59,448
<i>this record would have never come out.</i>

1266
01:18:59,529 --> 01:19:01,645
<i>Anton wouldn't have been able to write</i>
<i>any more songs.</i>

1267
01:19:02,849 --> 01:19:04,760
I'm trying to make this good too, man.

1268
01:19:04,849 --> 01:19:08,205
Don't even do that intro, leave
whatever's there, record the rest of the song.

1269
01:19:08,289 --> 01:19:09,961
I'll punch it in if it's not right.

1270
01:19:10,049 --> 01:19:11,528
I don't care, just like....

1271
01:19:11,609 --> 01:19:14,919
Yeah, 'cause we got all sorts of time
to fix punches.

1272
01:19:21,969 --> 01:19:25,325
Want to put the controller right here?
I don't understand what the problem is.

1273
01:19:25,409 --> 01:19:27,161
That's not where
I want to stick the controller.

1274
01:19:27,249 --> 01:19:30,082
Well, Muddy, then go home so I can work.

1275
01:19:30,169 --> 01:19:31,648
-Okay, I will.
-Thank you.

1276
01:19:34,969 --> 01:19:38,200
Anton fucking kicking Muddy
out of the recording,

1277
01:19:38,289 --> 01:19:40,849
fucking saying,
"Muddy, maybe you should just leave,"

1278
01:19:40,929 --> 01:19:42,282
telling him to go.

1279
01:19:42,369 --> 01:19:44,087
Doing fucking dope again

1280
01:19:44,169 --> 01:19:48,048
when Michael Dutcher, our manager,
has told him that if he does it again,

1281
01:19:48,129 --> 01:19:50,484
he's going to quit
and not manage us anymore.

1282
01:19:50,569 --> 01:19:53,766
Anton is making a decision for all of us
that he wants to fail.

1283
01:19:54,129 --> 01:19:58,839
<i>All right, the name of our band</i>
<i>is The Brian Jonestown Massacre.</i>

1284
01:19:59,569 --> 01:20:01,525
<i>And, the reason why</i>
<i>we haven't been playing out</i>

1285
01:20:01,609 --> 01:20:03,201
<i>is because we've been</i>
<i>recording a new album.</i>

<i>It's called</i> Strung Out in Heaven.

I know, it's Matt.
It's cool. He's doing revenge.

Righteous, brother.

1313
01:21:50,569 --> 01:21:52,048
Bombs away.

1314
01:21:53,969 --> 01:21:55,960
It's like seeing the dark, dark side....

1315
01:21:56,089 --> 01:21:58,967
Of what drugs do.
Well, it's 'cause, like, all those '60s bands

1316
01:21:59,049 --> 01:22:01,483
got into drugs and they were famous first.

MATT: <i>There's just too much stress</i>
<i>on my soul.</i>

1318
01:22:04,369 --> 01:22:06,087
I just want to be around some people

1319
01:22:06,169 --> 01:22:08,080
that aren't hell bent
on destroying themselves.

1320
01:22:08,249 --> 01:22:12,208
Hello, this is Matt from
The Brian Jonestown Massacre.

1321
01:22:12,369 --> 01:22:15,839
Anton completely flipped out on me
last night and attacked me.

1322
01:22:15,929 --> 01:22:20,445
I've got a huge bump
on my head and a giant bite mark on my side.

1323
01:22:20,529 --> 01:22:25,728
And, uh...y'know,
I just wanted to talk to you about that.

1324
01:22:25,809 --> 01:22:29,358
And maybe, like,
what the future of this band's situation

1325
01:22:29,449 --> 01:22:31,041
and contract is going to be.

1326
01:22:31,129 --> 01:22:32,767
What are you going to do about Matt?

1327
01:22:33,929 --> 01:22:35,408
What is Matt going to do about Matt?

1328
01:22:35,489 --> 01:22:39,118
I don't babysit fucking 26-year-old guys
for a living.

1329
01:22:39,209 --> 01:22:41,439
Right? I make great records for a living.

1330
01:22:41,529 --> 01:22:43,042
Who's in the band now?

1331
01:22:43,129 --> 01:22:45,802
Who fucking gives a shit?
Who was ever in the band?

1332
01:22:46,289 --> 01:22:47,802
Whoever I say is in the band.

1333
01:22:48,009 --> 01:22:50,000
I don't really know the person that he is now.

1334
01:22:50,729 --> 01:22:55,007
I would rather almost just think of him
as if he's dead or something.

1335
01:22:59,609 --> 01:23:01,520
It's my fucking band, I invented it.

1336
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:04,646
These guys quit and join as they feel like it.

1337
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:05,923
And that doesn't matter.

1338
01:23:06,249 --> 01:23:08,888
I would never manage another person
like Anton again.

1339
01:23:08,969 --> 01:23:11,847
Because you can't have

1340
01:23:12,169 --> 01:23:15,161
the hardcore sit-down with him
at times and say,

1341
01:23:15,249 --> 01:23:18,241
"Guy, you know,
this is what's really happening in your life.

1342
01:23:18,329 --> 01:23:21,287
"You know, the illusion that you want
to build in your head is one thing

1343
01:23:21,369 --> 01:23:23,803
"but the reality is this."

1344
01:23:23,889 --> 01:23:26,642
I'm really tired, 'cause I've been
doing business for 24 hours

1345
01:23:26,729 --> 01:23:29,368
for fucking months,
I still haven't been off work yet.

1346
01:23:29,489 --> 01:23:32,561
And you've missed everything.
You don't even understand how big this is.

1347
01:23:32,649 --> 01:23:36,528
They're flying fucking photographers from
New York and making them do what I want.

1348
01:23:37,209 --> 01:23:39,325
You're going to follow me
to a location right now.

1349
01:23:39,409 --> 01:23:42,401
We're going to go.
We'll use your lD, your California lD, right?

1350
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:44,128
-You have one?
-No.

1351
01:23:44,209 --> 01:23:46,086
And we're gonna go pawn one of my guitars.

1352
01:23:46,169 --> 01:23:49,002
Okay? We're getting $300 to make this
photo shoot happen.

1353
01:23:49,369 --> 01:23:51,644
And have some scratch,
do you understand that?

1354
01:23:51,729 --> 01:23:53,481
-Right.
-So the movie gets better.

1355
01:23:53,569 --> 01:23:54,604
So let's go do that.

a Coca-Cola commercial for all of history?"

1361
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:09,406

1362
01:24:09,609 --> 01:24:10,928

1363
01:24:11,009 --> 01:24:13,477

1364
01:24:17,529 --> 01:24:19,724
-Watch out.
-Very scary.

Anton.

1366

Do you need one of these, Joel?

1367
01:24:23,689 --> 01:24:24,838
A scarf?

1368
01:24:25,849 --> 01:24:26,998
Yeah.

1369
01:24:27,089 --> 01:24:29,603
That guy who walked by,
who ran by with the white shirt on?

1370
01:24:29,689 --> 01:24:32,726
Yeah, he was walking beside me
and asked me,

1371
01:24:32,809 --> 01:24:36,643
"Excuse me, are you guys members of a cult
or are you just shooting a video?"

1372
01:24:36,729 --> 01:24:38,560
And I'm, like, um....

1373
01:24:39,249 --> 01:24:40,967
"That's a really good question, sir.

1374
01:24:41,049 --> 01:24:43,438
"I'm sorry that I can't answer it for you
right now.

"I'm still figuring it out myself."

Well, I want it to be funny and rad
and a curiosity.

1381

1389

I got more ideas than that whole
fucking little office of theirs.

COURTNEY: Recording <i>Thirteen Tales</i>
was probably the best recording experience.

1398
01:26:04,289 --> 01:26:08,168
The level of creativity was really intense.

Like, I saved up a lot of good karma, I think.

Like, when I paid for all the coke,
and everyone smokes my cigarettes, and....

You guys sounded great.

"God, I'm so glad I like them."

'Cause they're nice people.
What if I didn't like them?

1452

-Isn't that the worst?
-Yeah.

-It was great, though, man.
-Thanks

COURTNEY: <i>We had hit another peak.</i>
<i>We were playing sold-out shows</i>

1457
01:29:21,649 --> 01:29:24,846
<i>and festivals for 70,000 to 100,000 people.</i>

1458
01:29:24,929 --> 01:29:26,248
<i>And we were loving it.</i>

1459
01:29:29,769 --> 01:29:32,920
I guess TVT wound up losing a lot of money
on The Brian Jonestown Massacre.

1460
01:29:33,009 --> 01:29:35,842
At the beginning there was lots of success.
We shipped 30,000 records.

1461
01:29:35,929 --> 01:29:37,999
We went number three at CMJ.

1462
01:29:38,089 --> 01:29:40,478
<i>And then the sales didn't really come up.</i>

1463
01:29:40,569 --> 01:29:42,719
<i>There were eight people on the road.</i>

1464
01:29:42,809 --> 01:29:45,562
They did, you know, 147 shows,

1465
01:29:45,649 --> 01:29:48,721
but I think people wound up going
to the live show

1466
01:29:48,809 --> 01:29:51,687
to see if Anton
was going to punch his bass player,

1467
01:29:51,769 --> 01:29:53,999
or if Anton was going to walk out
on the show.

<i>into a Dandy Warhols version of</i>
<i>Andy Warhol's Factory.</i>

1540
01:34:13,169 --> 01:34:17,287
The idea of a community of artists

1541
01:34:17,369 --> 01:34:22,079
that are not being judged negatively
by what's weird or screwy about them

1542
01:34:22,169 --> 01:34:23,284
but being glorified.

1543
01:34:23,369 --> 01:34:27,920
He took the video budget
and instead of building sets

1544
01:34:28,009 --> 01:34:31,638
and having them torn down,
we had sets built permanently.

1545
01:34:32,249 --> 01:34:36,640
And now we'll be able to rehearse
and have our own shows in that room.

but come on.

1593
01:37:06,729 --> 01:37:09,323
You know, these kids are all gonna end up
in prison.

1594
01:37:09,409 --> 01:37:12,287
COURTNEY: <i>Last I heard,</i>
<i>Anton had cleaned up,</i>

1595
01:37:12,369 --> 01:37:13,882
<i>put together a whole new line-up</i>

1596
01:37:13,969 --> 01:37:16,642
<i>and gone on an independent tour</i>
<i>across America.</i>

1597
01:37:16,729 --> 01:37:21,564
<i>Though successful financially,</i>
<i>the tour was riddled with fights and anxiety</i>

1598
01:37:21,649 --> 01:37:25,119
<i>as Anton heard the news</i>
<i>of the birth of his son.</i>

1599
01:37:25,209 --> 01:37:27,484
<i>The last show of the tour</i>
<i>was in Los Angeles.</i>

1600
01:37:27,569 --> 01:37:30,720
<i>It's been a tough year.</i>
<i>Let me entertain you, okay?</i>

1601
01:37:30,809 --> 01:37:34,802
<i>Let me just do this. 'Cause I am sick.</i>
<i>I don't need to be here.</i>

1602
01:37:34,889 --> 01:37:37,767
<i>I don't have a record company.</i>
<i>I am the record company.</i>

1603
01:37:37,849 --> 01:37:40,886
<i>Listen to my voice, I am not joking.</i>

1604
01:37:40,969 --> 01:37:43,642
<i>I am not for sale, this is a gift for you.</i>

1605
01:37:43,729 --> 01:37:48,280
<i>You paid for it, enjoy it.</i>
<i>Don't piss in the fucking well.</i>

1606
01:37:48,369 --> 01:37:51,122
<i>I have a son. Listen.</i>

1607
01:37:51,209 --> 01:37:53,769
<i>I want to go meet my son.</i>
<i>I'll take your money,</i>

1608
01:37:53,849 --> 01:37:57,285
<i>see my son, and buy him something nice.</i>
<i>Let me entertain you.</i>

1609
01:37:58,529 --> 01:38:00,918
<i>Thank you, I love you too.</i>

1610
01:38:04,489 --> 01:38:08,846
<i>You may have seen her around town.</i>
<i>Her name is Sara. She's my sister.</i>

1611
01:38:09,209 --> 01:38:12,042
<i>She's going play a song for you now.</i>
<i>Sara come up here.</i>

1612
01:38:18,689 --> 01:38:21,203
# You were gone

1613
01:38:22,449 --> 01:38:24,724
# I felt

1614
01:38:24,809 --> 01:38:28,404
# I felt out of place

1615
01:38:28,489 --> 01:38:30,684
# Go on #

1616
01:38:32,489 --> 01:38:37,404
Just like how a shark has to keep moving
and if they stop they'll die.

1617
01:38:37,489 --> 01:38:40,481
I honestly don't know what would happen
to him if he were successful,

1618
01:38:40,569 --> 01:38:42,878
and he stopped having things to...

1619
01:38:44,769 --> 01:38:46,839
really battle against.

1620
01:38:55,529 --> 01:38:58,407
<i>Hey, you're gonna get your head kicked in.</i>
<i>Say it. Come up here.</i>

1621
01:38:58,489 --> 01:39:00,161
<i>And say it to my face, right now.</i>

1622
01:39:00,249 --> 01:39:03,844
<i>Say it to my face. I don't think that's funny,</i>
<i>I'm not into incest or child molestation.</i>

1623
01:39:03,929 --> 01:39:06,648
<i>Come up here, be a man.</i>
<i>Don't hide back there.</i>

1624
01:39:09,689 --> 01:39:10,678
MAN: Relax.

1625
01:39:12,809 --> 01:39:15,277
<i>Don't talk like that to ladies</i>
<i>when they're entertaining you.</i>

1626
01:39:15,369 --> 01:39:17,087
<i>I'll kick your fucking head in.</i>

1627
01:39:17,169 --> 01:39:19,285
<i>Come on back up here.</i>
<i>I'll hit you again, come on.</i>

1628
01:39:19,369 --> 01:39:21,678
Holy shit. He kicked me in the head.

1629
01:39:21,769 --> 01:39:23,566
<i>Hey, I'm gonna beat your fucking ass.</i>

1630
01:39:23,649 --> 01:39:26,800
<i>Hey, bouncers, bounce this guy</i>
<i>or else I'm gonna kill him in your club.</i>

1631
01:39:26,889 --> 01:39:29,562
<i>Hear this. Do you guys have him?</i>
<i>I'm stopping this show. Good night.</i>

1632
01:39:29,649 --> 01:39:31,879
MAN: (ON RADIO):
<i>Now restraining the lead singer.</i>

1633
01:39:31,969 --> 01:39:35,086
<i>He's on his way to you</i>
<i>with three security guards.</i>

1634
01:39:37,489 --> 01:39:38,968
<i>The police are coming to him.</i>

1635
01:39:39,049 --> 01:39:41,199
Anton.

1636
01:39:41,289 --> 01:39:44,247
-They're coming to you.
-That's fine.

1637
01:39:44,689 --> 01:39:47,999
-We are taking him back to the green room.
-That's fine.

1638
01:39:49,609 --> 01:39:50,962
Have a seat.

1639
01:39:52,489 --> 01:39:55,322
-They want me dead. I am not joking around.
-Do you think so?

1640
01:39:55,409 --> 01:39:57,639
I know for a fact it's over.

1641
01:39:57,729 --> 01:39:59,242
I've already won. My son's here.

1642
01:39:59,329 --> 01:40:00,808
I keep the door locked.

1643
01:40:00,889 --> 01:40:03,084
Today is a wonderful day to die.

1644
01:40:03,169 --> 01:40:04,522
Those guys are gonna kill me.

1645
01:40:04,609 --> 01:40:06,918
Just put your hands behind your back,
palms together. Face the wall.

1646
01:40:07,009 --> 01:40:09,887
-Careful with my fingers.
-You've got it.

1647
01:40:09,969 --> 01:40:12,403
Okay, now put your hands behind your back,
palms together.

1648
01:40:12,489 --> 01:40:15,606
There you go.
If you want, we can double handcuff him.

1649
01:40:15,969 --> 01:40:19,120
Sorry I didn't ever get to see my son,
but that's the breaks.

1650
01:40:19,209 --> 01:40:20,244
I didn't do nothing.

1651
01:40:20,329 --> 01:40:23,844
Our watch commander's probably going
to advise that we book him for ADW.

1652
01:40:23,969 --> 01:40:26,403
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Anytime you use....

1653
01:40:26,489 --> 01:40:28,719
-Anything besides your hands?
-Yes. Yeah.

1654
01:40:28,809 --> 01:40:29,798
When you use your feet,

1655
01:40:29,889 --> 01:40:32,039
because of the power
you can generate in your legs,

1656
01:40:32,129 --> 01:40:33,357
and you kick somebody in the head....

1657
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:38,006
I cannot get out. I'm in till Tuesday
and they're putting me with the bad guys.

1658
01:40:38,489 --> 01:40:42,801
Ondi, tell my son I love him. I'm never
going to see him again, d'you hear me?

1659
01:40:42,889 --> 01:40:44,368
I'm telling you the truth.

1660
01:40:48,289 --> 01:40:50,484
ANTON: <i>So we weren't even</i>
<i>going to play tonight,</i>

1661
01:40:50,569 --> 01:40:52,958
<i>but we want to make sure</i>
<i>that everybody knows</i>

1662
01:40:53,049 --> 01:40:54,607
<i>we're gonna fight the good fight.</i>

1663
01:41:06,889 --> 01:41:10,359
# Three words you have spoken

1664
01:41:15,049 --> 01:41:18,837
# You don't think we get old #

1665
01:41:20,569 --> 01:41:26,565
He's like, this brilliant monster creator of art

1666
01:41:26,649 --> 01:41:30,608
that generally is like three years ahead.
And I always think I'm catching up to him,

1667
01:41:30,689 --> 01:41:36,639
and then he comes up with something
that I just can't believe what he just did.

1668
01:41:36,849 --> 01:41:39,488
He's just always ahead. He's so amazing.

1669
01:41:40,529 --> 01:41:43,646
# Please play by the rules

1670
01:41:44,809 --> 01:41:48,404
# Please play by the rules

1671
01:41:48,929 --> 01:41:52,239
# If I knew my way out #

1672
01:41:52,329 --> 01:41:55,605
There's no way to have a revolution
if you stay underground.

1673
01:41:55,689 --> 01:41:57,361
What the fuck's the point of that?

1674
01:41:57,449 --> 01:42:00,168
<i>The whole point was for him</i>
<i>to get above ground as well.</i>

1675
01:42:00,249 --> 01:42:02,285
And then he could have his revolution.

1676
01:42:07,569 --> 01:42:08,888
ANTON: <i>There has been a revolution.</i>

1677
01:42:08,969 --> 01:42:11,608
Do you hear The White Stripes
on the fucking radio?

1678
01:42:11,689 --> 01:42:15,841
There's a big difference.
Because when I started, it was Pearl Jam.

1679
01:42:15,929 --> 01:42:17,601
<i>I just think the revolution happened.</i>

1680
01:42:17,689 --> 01:42:20,203
How many people
are imitating Pearl Jam right now?

1681
01:42:20,289 --> 01:42:23,440
Not that many.
How many imitators do I have?

1682
01:42:23,849 --> 01:42:26,204
I played a part in opening that up.

1683
01:42:26,289 --> 01:42:28,723
Why don't they tell people
who influenced them?

1684
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:31,369
They don't, because they're self-serving
fucking bastards.

1685
01:42:31,449 --> 01:42:35,761
Everyone that Anton's ever met
has gone on to make great music.

1686
01:42:35,849 --> 01:42:39,967
Peter from Black Rebel Motorcycle Club
used to be in Brian Jonestown Massacre

1687
01:42:40,049 --> 01:42:43,041
they're signed to Virgin.
Miranda Lee Richards, she signed to Virgin.

1688
01:42:43,129 --> 01:42:44,528
The Warlocks gave us

1689
01:42:44,609 --> 01:42:46,042
the Beachwood Sparks
and The Tyde and The Lilys,

1690
01:42:46,129 --> 01:42:48,802
which is all kind part of Anton's scene.

1691
01:42:48,929 --> 01:42:51,079
And he is exactly where he was before.

1692
01:42:51,169 --> 01:42:54,445
'Cause Anton was never really interested
in having a professional career.

1693
01:42:55,169 --> 01:42:57,399
He just wants to play rock'n'roll.

1694
01:42:57,489 --> 01:43:00,083
The fuckers, the bean-counters, the lawyers.

1695
01:43:00,489 --> 01:43:04,277
All these assholes, at every label, those are
the people that wreck the music business.

1696
01:43:04,369 --> 01:43:08,157
Not Napster, not some college kid
downloading shit,

1697
01:43:08,249 --> 01:43:09,682
the people without vision.

1698
01:43:10,369 --> 01:43:13,679
The music's strong enough that
there probably will be a generation

1699
01:43:13,769 --> 01:43:17,205
that discovers them
like this rare, fossilised gem.

1700
01:43:18,329 --> 01:43:20,479

<i>at the same level.</i>

1703
01:43:28,649 --> 01:43:31,004
And they'll be remembered forever.

1704
