1
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,963
Let's see what you got.

2
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:39,969
I need more runners.
I can't write the business fast enough.

3
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:41,964
You've got to see Granger.

4
00:02:48,855 --> 00:02:50,729
8720. Yeah.

5
00:02:51,358 --> 00:02:53,849
Yeah. Hold it a minute. Beat it, Mottola!

6
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:56,185
Mr. Granger? Chicago's on the line.

7
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:03,575
This is Combs. Why haven't you called?
Everyone else is in.

8
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:05,785
We had problems
with the law this morning.

9
00:03:05,872 --> 00:03:08,328
The mayor promised
to get tough on the rackets.

10
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:11,334
He shut everybody down
for two hours to make it look good.

11
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,459
Nothing serious. It just puts us behind.

12
00:03:13,547 --> 00:03:14,709
Been making your payoffs?

13
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:18,126
Yes! He does this every year.
There's nothing to worry about.

14
00:03:18,427 --> 00:03:22,341
<i>Finish your count and get it up here.
I don't want to be here all night.</i>

15
00:03:22,431 --> 00:03:26,298
The man's going to be real happy.
We cleared over $10,000 this week.

16
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:30,720
<i>- We cleared $22,000 here.
- You got the whole Chicago South Side.</i>

17
00:03:30,814 --> 00:03:33,768
How do you expect my eight lousy spots
to compete with that?

18
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:38,402
They did $14,000 in Evanston,
$16,500 in Gary and $20,000 in Cicero.

19
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:40,446
Looks like you're bringing up the rear.

20
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:43,403
I just got the count.
I'll put the take on the 4:15.

21
00:03:43,494 --> 00:03:45,368
We'll be waiting.

22
00:03:48,374 --> 00:03:50,117
Mottola!

23
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:55,496
Take this up to Chicago on the 4:15.

24
00:03:55,798 --> 00:03:58,336
They'll be waiting for it
at the clearinghouse.

25
00:03:59,135 --> 00:04:03,133
And don't stop for any entertainment.
Get a cab over on Seventh.

26
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:05,307
Cut it out!

27
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:08,093
8720.

28
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:23,992
Hey, you there! Stop!
Hey, you! Stop that man!

29
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:28,330
Stop him! He's got my wallet!
Stop him! Stop that man!

30
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,999
He's got all of my money!

31
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,708
Stop him!

32
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:37,588
Goddamn nigger-lover!

33
00:04:39,718 --> 00:04:42,043
I'll get you someday for this! Sucker egg!

34
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:44,553
Don't let him get away!
He's got my wallet!

35
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,300
He's got all my money!

36
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:49,347
- My wallet! He's got my wallet!
- We got it!

37
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:51,887
What happened?
Did he get you with the knife?

38
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,765
- You need a doctor. I'll call a cop.
- No, no! No cops!

39
00:04:58,946 --> 00:05:01,698
- You wanted by the law?
- No, it's okay.

40
00:05:03,826 --> 00:05:06,910
Are you nuts, carrying a wad like that
in this neighborhood?

41
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:10,994
Thanks. I'm obliged to you.
I've got to get going.

42
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:13,416
You ain't going nowhere on this leg.

43
00:05:13,502 --> 00:05:17,203
I've got to. Got to run some slots
in West Bend for a mob here.

44
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:21,713
I got a little behind in the payoffs.
They think I've been holding out on them.

45
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:24,679
They gave me until 4:00
to come up with the cash.

46
00:05:24,764 --> 00:05:26,803
If they don't get it, I'm dead.

47
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:29,263
It don't look good, Gramps.
It's almost 4:00 now.

48
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:32,768
I'll give you and your friend $100
to deliver it for me.

49
00:05:34,774 --> 00:05:38,273
I don't know.
The mug that hit you is mad at me.

50
00:05:38,361 --> 00:05:40,437
What if he's waiting around the corner?

51
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,484
He won't know you're carrying it.
You've got to help me.

52
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:49,242
I'm sorry. I'll help you get to a doctor, but
I ain't about to walk into no knife for you.

53
00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:52,665
How about you? All you got to do
is put it in the door slot.

54
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:56,334
- I'll give you the whole $100.
- What makes you think you can trust him?

55
00:05:56,421 --> 00:06:00,371
Butt out! I gave him back the wallet.
How far is this place?

56
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:04,465
1811 Mason. Put it in box 3-C.
You won't have no trouble.

57
00:06:06,223 --> 00:06:08,548
There's $5,000 there...

58
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:10,802
...and here's $100 for you.

59
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:15,599
Okay, I'll make your drop for you.
And don't worry, you can trust me.

60
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:22,195
If those goons search you,
you won't get far carrying it there.

61
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,487
- What'll we do?
- You got a bag or something?

62
00:06:24,575 --> 00:06:26,532
How about a handkerchief?

63
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,944
- Here's a handkerchief!
- Give it to me.

64
00:06:29,663 --> 00:06:32,368
- Give me the money.
- Just hurry, will you?

65
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:37,619
You got any more? Better give it all to me
if you want to keep it.

66
00:06:37,922 --> 00:06:39,464
They think I've been holding out.

67
00:06:39,548 --> 00:06:42,585
My wife got sick and I had to pay the bill.

68
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:45,256
Stuff it down your pants here.
Like that. Got it?

69
00:06:46,264 --> 00:06:47,295
Hurry, will you?

70
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,391
Ain't a tough guy in the world
that will frisk you there.

71
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,555
Thanks.

72
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:06,941
Where to?

73
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:09,442
- Which way is Mason?
- Twenty blocks south.

74
00:07:09,537 --> 00:07:12,491
- Go north, Joliet Station, fast!
- Right.

75
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,545
What's so funny?

76
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,335
I just made the world's easiest $5,000!

77
00:07:32,978 --> 00:07:35,647
- Come on, Luther! Come on!
- Hold on, man!

78
00:07:35,814 --> 00:07:37,059
Hustle!

79
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:43,521
In here!

80
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:48,151
Man, was that beautiful!

81
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,826
I thought for sure he was on to us.

82
00:07:50,913 --> 00:07:54,198
No, you had him all the way. All the way!

83
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:04,042
Good God! We're millionaires.

84
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:06,675
- Did you know he was that loaded?
- Hell, no!

85
00:08:06,762 --> 00:08:10,677
I just cut into him. I would've settled
for pawning one of them shoes.

86
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:13,309
Oh, God!

87
00:08:18,191 --> 00:08:20,860
Let's get out of here.
We'll split it up tonight.

88
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:59,023
Hiya, Marge!

89
00:09:10,536 --> 00:09:13,157
- Hi, kid.
- Hi, Hooker. She's on stage.

90
00:09:17,918 --> 00:09:20,243
Hi, Hooker. Getting married or something?

91
00:09:20,337 --> 00:09:23,587
Get used to it, Leonard.
I'm going to look this good from now on.

92
00:09:23,924 --> 00:09:26,332
- What do you say, Ed?
- Hi, Hooker.

93
00:09:50,243 --> 00:09:52,864
Are you getting married or something?

94
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,746
For Christ's sake, did you hear that?

95
00:10:01,838 --> 00:10:04,709
Harry drops four beats
in the middle of my goddamn routine!

96
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,753
- How long do I have to put up with that?
- Leonard, you're on.

97
00:10:08,261 --> 00:10:10,883
You want to get out of here tonight?
I got some dough.

98
00:10:10,972 --> 00:10:13,973
I can't. I got a 10:00 show. I need the $5.

99
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:17,010
I'll spend $50 on you.

100
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:18,771
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

101
00:10:20,065 --> 00:10:21,227
Okay.

102
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:24,898
...opens up his pants,
the duck sticks his head out.

103
00:10:24,987 --> 00:10:27,560
One lady says to the other,
"See what I see?"

104
00:10:27,656 --> 00:10:30,573
She says, "So what?
You've seen one, you've seen them all."

105
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:33,695
She says, "Yes, but this one
is eating my popcorn."

106
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:40,826
You see that guy Harry, he can't keep time.

107
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:44,004
Supposing there's
some Hollywood movie agent out there.

108
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:46,462
All those years of training
right down the drain.

109
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,041
Ain't seen you in months.
Thought you took a fall.

110
00:10:49,136 --> 00:10:51,544
Just a little hard times.
Everything's jake now.

111
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,382
How about a ten spot on the line?

112
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:56,428
There's a lot of action there on 28th Street.
Pay you $35.

113
00:10:57,478 --> 00:10:59,056
$3,000 on the red.

114
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:01,188
- $3,000?
- Are you nuts?

115
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,555
No, I feel lucky.

116
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,474
Hooker, I can't accept that.
It's too big a bet.

117
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,811
- There's a house limit.
- Take it.

118
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:09,607
- But Hooker here...
- Take it!

119
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:19,739
Twenty-two, black.

120
00:11:22,795 --> 00:11:24,455
Tough luck, kid.

121
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:26,875
Lucky for me it came up black.

122
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:29,802
A fella could get in trouble here,
losing a bet like that.

123
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:32,009
Listen, Jimmy, can't we do it again?

124
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,726
Don't worry about it. There's always more
where that came from.

125
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:48,773
"Don't worry about it," he says. $3,000!

126
00:11:49,281 --> 00:11:50,230
Thanks, Hooker.

127
00:11:50,324 --> 00:11:52,815
Comes in here with $50
he's going to spend on me!

128
00:11:56,705 --> 00:11:58,911
- Thanks for the evening.
- It's not over yet.

129
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:01,620
Next time you want to spend $50
on me, mail it.

130
00:12:58,476 --> 00:13:02,344
They found Mottola drunk in a dive
in Joliet. He never got on the train.

131
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:05,523
I don't want to hear about his day.
What happened to the money?

132
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:08,894
He lost it to a couple of con artists
on his way out of the spot.

133
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:11,229
- How much?
- $11,000.

134
00:13:15,118 --> 00:13:17,989
I better get on the phone to New York...

135
00:13:18,288 --> 00:13:21,123
...see what the big mick
wants to do about it.

136
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:24,200
I have a pretty good idea, though.

137
00:14:09,507 --> 00:14:12,212
- Doyle, can I talk to you?
- I'm busy, Floyd.

138
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:16,051
It's important. We had a little trouble
in Chicago today.

139
00:14:16,306 --> 00:14:19,093
One of our runners got hit for $11,000.

140
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,599
What makes you think
he just didn't pocket it?

141
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:26,767
We checked his story with a tipster.
He was cleaned by two grifters.

142
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,978
They working for anybody?

143
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:32,438
I don't know. Could be.
We're running that down now.

144
00:14:33,323 --> 00:14:36,906
Have some local people take care of them.
Nothing fancy.

145
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:39,745
We've got to discourage this kind of thing.

146
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:43,124
You follow?

147
00:15:03,062 --> 00:15:04,722
Johnny Hooker!

148
00:15:04,855 --> 00:15:07,809
- If you ain't a sharper in them linens!
- 'Evening, Louise.

149
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,896
Hey, Ma!

150
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:12,899
If I didn't know you better,
I'd swear you had some class.

151
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:16,865
Luther said you was something
to see today!

152
00:15:16,951 --> 00:15:18,113
I don't know, Alva.

153
00:15:18,202 --> 00:15:22,152
I got to get faster tying that bundle.
I still give them too much time to think.

154
00:15:22,248 --> 00:15:26,376
Bushwah! I used to make that switch
with slower hands than you got.

155
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:29,546
'Course, the Up and Down Broadway
was my best game.

156
00:15:29,672 --> 00:15:33,717
Me and Luther didn't make much on it,
but it wasn't so touchy.

157
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:37,669
Them marks can beat you up bad
when they catch you making that switch.

158
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:39,922
Come on, Leroy. We'll be late for church.

159
00:15:40,016 --> 00:15:42,685
Ma, they were closing in
on Machine Gun Kelly!

160
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:44,311
Who you rooting for anyhow?

161
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:46,020
- Hey, Hooker!
- Can't help you, Leroy.

162
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:47,849
- You can't beat the house.
- Nuts!

163
00:15:47,941 --> 00:15:51,476
- Since when do you go to church at night?
- Since they started late bingo.

164
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:54,903
I'll ask the Lord for some of that cash
while He's still paying off.

165
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,825
Luther, look in on the baby
from time to time, will you?

166
00:15:57,909 --> 00:16:00,994
- You too, Louise?
- Child, yeah, got to go pray. See you.

167
00:16:01,997 --> 00:16:03,788
Hey, Erie.

168
00:16:03,874 --> 00:16:07,207
- Gimme! Gimme, gimme!
- There's your cut.

169
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:10,127
Guy turned out to be an oil well.

170
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:13,214
- Which way'd he go?
- Due north. He was gonna take it all.

171
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,384
The bastard.
He can blow his nose all the way.

172
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:23,471
There you go, Luther. Six G's.

173
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,144
- You're late. Where have you been?
- I had a couple of appointments.

174
00:16:31,568 --> 00:16:33,478
How much did you lose?

175
00:16:39,535 --> 00:16:42,026
- All of it.
- In one goddamn night?

176
00:16:43,122 --> 00:16:45,115
Why are you spraying money
around like that?

177
00:16:45,207 --> 00:16:48,078
- You could've been nailed!
- There were no dicks there.

178
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:50,660
But you're a con man,
and you blew it like a pimp!

179
00:16:50,755 --> 00:16:53,328
- Didn't I teach you to be no pimp.
- What's eating you?

180
00:16:53,424 --> 00:16:55,216
I've blown money before.

181
00:16:55,384 --> 00:16:58,884
- No class grifter would've done it.
- You think my play is bad?

182
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:01,799
I think you're the best.

183
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:08,427
I wouldn't be getting out, otherwise.

184
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:13,852
- What are you talking about?
- I'm getting too old for this racket.

185
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:16,816
You hang on too long
and you start embarrassing yourself.

186
00:17:16,906 --> 00:17:19,148
We just took off on the biggest score ever.

187
00:17:19,242 --> 00:17:22,160
It's nothing compared to what
you could make on the big con.

188
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:23,870
But you played the big con.

189
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:28,368
You told me yourself it was some
dumb game for mama's boys and flakes.

190
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:35,213
Hell, I never played no big con.
I hung around and picked up a few things.

191
00:17:37,469 --> 00:17:40,803
Ain't no rich boys gonna trust
a hungry nigger enough to be conned.

192
00:17:41,848 --> 00:17:43,093
But I'll tell you...

193
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:46,514
...I've been looking for this one
all my life, Johnny.

194
00:17:46,645 --> 00:17:49,017
Now I have a chance
to step out when I'm ahead.

195
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:52,899
Come on!
What would you do with yourself?

196
00:17:53,152 --> 00:17:56,271
I have a brother in K.C.,
runs a freight outlet.

197
00:17:56,572 --> 00:17:58,730
I can go halfsies with him.

198
00:17:59,408 --> 00:18:02,777
It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.

199
00:18:05,831 --> 00:18:08,785
I got an old friend in Chicago
named Henry Gondorff.

200
00:18:09,293 --> 00:18:13,540
I want you to look him up.
There ain't a better inside man alive.

201
00:18:13,923 --> 00:18:16,793
- He'll teach you all you got to know.
- To hell with that.

202
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:19,964
I want to work with you.

203
00:18:20,638 --> 00:18:22,761
I'm out, Johnny.

204
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:31,891
Yeah, sure. If that's the way you want it.

205
00:18:33,693 --> 00:18:35,567
That's the way I want it.

206
00:18:38,698 --> 00:18:42,032
How do you like that Coleman?
After five years.

207
00:18:42,911 --> 00:18:46,196
- He knew he was holding you back.
- Yeah, but we were partners.

208
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:48,959
If it weren't for Luther,
I'd still be hustling pinball.

209
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:50,620
I don't need more than what I got.

210
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,914
You won't have anything
if you don't lay off the games of chance.

211
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:56,959
- There's a depression on.
- There's always a depression on.

212
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,422
If you saved a little,
you wouldn't have to grift.

213
00:18:59,511 --> 00:19:02,512
- I like grifting.
- You could buy yourself some things.

214
00:19:02,597 --> 00:19:04,056
- What?
- New clothes, a car.

215
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:06,383
I got clothes,
and I don't know how to drive.

216
00:19:06,476 --> 00:19:08,220
What else do you got to sell?

217
00:19:11,064 --> 00:19:13,686
Hey, Hooker! Come on, you son of a...

218
00:19:17,237 --> 00:19:18,696
Hi there, Snyder.

219
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:22,447
What's the matter? Things a little slow
down at the bunco department?

220
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:23,910
Somebody lose at dominoes?

221
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:26,781
You scored blood money today,
and you need a friend.

222
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:29,198
Go find yourself a shoplifter to roll.

223
00:19:34,004 --> 00:19:37,705
You got the wrong guy, pal.
I've been home with the flu all day.

224
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:40,416
- Stake out my toilet if you want.
- Keep talking!

225
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:57,064
I'll tell you what you did, smart boy.

226
00:19:57,528 --> 00:20:01,194
You tied into a loaded mark
on 47th across from Maxie's.

227
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:05,529
You and Coleman played the switch
for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.

228
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:10,451
If he hadn't been a numbers runner for
Doyle Lonnegan, it would've been perfect.

229
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,036
You're crazy.

230
00:20:15,338 --> 00:20:17,960
I ain't stupid enough
to play for no racket's money.

231
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:22,047
Not intentionally, maybe.
That don't cut no ice with Lonnegan.

232
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,390
- He'll swat you like a fly.
- Yeah, well...

233
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:28,969
...I'll square it with the fixer.

234
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,848
Nobody can buy you a prayer
if I put the finger on you.

235
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,726
Now, I figure your end of the score
was at least three G's.

236
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,694
- I want two, no matter what it was.
- My take was only one.

237
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,651
Then you'll have to come up
with another $1,000 somewhere.

238
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,623
All right.

239
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,384
You're a smart egg, Hooker.

240
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,976
No sense getting dead over $2,000.

241
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:25,946
Relax, Erie. I'll bill you.

242
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,245
- I thought you blew all your money.
- I did.

243
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:43,715
I gave him counterfeit. They'll spot it
the first place he tries to spend it.

244
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,010
Are you crazy,
giving him counterfeit money?

245
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,058
Wait up! Where you going?

246
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:15,332
What the hell are you gonna do
if Snyder puts the finger on you?

247
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:18,171
- You're committing suicide, kid.
- What's the difference?

248
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:22,335
If Snyder knows, so does everybody else.
He never gets anything first.

249
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:25,796
Hey, listen to me.
Don't go back to your place tonight.

250
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:29,174
Don't go anyplace you usually go.
You hear me?

251
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:31,800
Damn! There's no answer at Luther's.

252
00:22:32,353 --> 00:22:34,926
Look, you better get out of town
or something.

253
00:22:37,108 --> 00:22:39,231
Lady, let go!

254
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:43,483
- Ma'am! Ma'am!
- I want my nickel back for that telephone!

255
00:22:49,412 --> 00:22:52,247
No, sir. Nobody here did.

256
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:54,742
1521 North Bryant.

257
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:15,510
- Is he dead?
- I don't know. There was a big fight.

258
00:23:15,605 --> 00:23:18,440
I don't know.
Somebody must've pushed him.

259
00:23:23,405 --> 00:23:24,983
- Jesus!
- Luther!

260
00:23:25,866 --> 00:23:27,443
- Luther!
- Jesus!

261
00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:30,781
God! No!

262
00:23:30,996 --> 00:23:33,617
Luther!

263
00:23:33,874 --> 00:23:35,072
What happened?

264
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:38,168
Who would do such a thing to you, Luther?

265
00:23:42,132 --> 00:23:44,706
Come on! Let's get out of here.

266
00:23:45,803 --> 00:23:49,088
Come on! If Snyder catches you here,
you're dead!

267
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:55,219
- Get out of here!
- Out of the way.

268
00:23:55,312 --> 00:23:57,222
Help me! Help me!

269
00:24:45,697 --> 00:24:46,860
Excuse me.

270
00:24:47,282 --> 00:24:49,239
I'm looking for a guy
named Henry Gondorff.

271
00:24:49,326 --> 00:24:51,283
- Do you know him?
- No.

272
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:58,122
You sure?

273
00:24:58,836 --> 00:25:00,211
Beat it.

274
00:25:00,546 --> 00:25:01,921
Luther Coleman sent me.

275
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:07,418
- Are you Hooker?
- Yeah.

276
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,715
Why didn't you say so?

277
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:15,801
We heard about Luther last night.

278
00:25:16,312 --> 00:25:17,343
Come on.

279
00:25:24,528 --> 00:25:26,936
I thought maybe you were a cop
or something.

280
00:25:28,282 --> 00:25:29,824
It's the room in the back.

281
00:25:29,951 --> 00:25:32,442
He wasn't expecting you so soon, though.

282
00:25:33,704 --> 00:25:34,949
Thanks.

283
00:26:41,524 --> 00:26:43,600
The great Henry Gondorff.

284
00:26:45,528 --> 00:26:46,441
Turn it off!

285
00:26:50,908 --> 00:26:52,450
Are you sober?

286
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,952
Turn it off, will you?

287
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:14,634
Glad to meet you, kid.
You're a real horse's ass.

288
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,436
Luther said I could learn
something from you.

289
00:27:19,312 --> 00:27:20,854
I already know how to drink.

290
00:27:23,316 --> 00:27:25,225
Sorry about Luther.

291
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,528
He was the best street worker I ever saw.

292
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,905
He had you down as a big-timer.
What happened?

293
00:27:38,498 --> 00:27:41,583
I conned a senator from Florida
on a stock deal.

294
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,543
A real lop-ear. Thought he was gonna
take over General Electric.

295
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:48,917
Some chanteuse woke him, though,
and he put the feds on me.

296
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,753
You mean you blew it.

297
00:27:52,554 --> 00:27:54,926
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.

298
00:27:55,057 --> 00:27:57,726
He didn't tell me you was a screw-up either.

299
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:09,190
You played any big cons since then?

300
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:14,825
I lammed around a bunch of bohunk towns,
one kick ahead of the G-men.

301
00:28:15,453 --> 00:28:18,370
Would be still,
if Billie hadn't set me up here.

302
00:28:21,792 --> 00:28:24,793
Don't kid yourself, friend. I still know how.

303
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:35,669
Are you going to stay for breakfast,
or do you already know how to eat?

304
00:28:36,391 --> 00:28:38,217
I picked something up along the way.

305
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:44,517
Is Lonnegan after you too?

306
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:48,063
I don't know. I ain't seen anybody.

307
00:28:48,403 --> 00:28:50,360
You never do, kid.

308
00:29:04,753 --> 00:29:05,951
Doyle?

309
00:29:06,713 --> 00:29:07,876
Yeah.

310
00:29:10,842 --> 00:29:12,716
We just talked to Chicago.

311
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:15,721
They got one of the grifters last night.
A nigger.

312
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:20,473
- How about the other one?
- They're still looking for him.

313
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:25,056
- Who did Combs put on it?
- He gave it to Riley and Cole.

314
00:29:25,274 --> 00:29:28,773
They staked out the other guy's place
last night, but he never showed.

315
00:29:28,861 --> 00:29:31,067
They figure maybe he skipped town.

316
00:29:31,447 --> 00:29:33,155
Do you want to keep after him?

317
00:29:34,491 --> 00:29:36,733
You see that fella in the red sweater?

318
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:38,745
His name's Danny McCoy.

319
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:42,661
Works a few of the protection rackets
when he's waiting for something better.

320
00:29:43,626 --> 00:29:46,413
Danny and I have known each other
since we were six.

321
00:29:49,048 --> 00:29:51,753
Take a good look at that face, Floyd.

322
00:29:52,635 --> 00:29:56,134
Because if he ever finds out
I can be beat by one lousy grifter...

323
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:58,632
...I'll have to kill him and every hood...

324
00:29:58,724 --> 00:30:01,560
...who wants to muscle in
on my Chicago operation.

325
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:05,973
- You follow?
- Yes, sir.

326
00:30:08,026 --> 00:30:09,354
Good lad.

327
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:15,777
You feeling all right this morning, Henry?

328
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:17,358
Yeah, fine.

329
00:30:17,577 --> 00:30:20,150
You mind opening up the round
a little early today?

330
00:30:20,246 --> 00:30:22,323
We got some business
coming in before hours.

331
00:30:22,707 --> 00:30:25,198
- Sure.
- Check the main gearing, will you?

332
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,292
Man O' War started rattling yesterday
and threw a kid on its head.

333
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:35,918
Great little countess, that Billie.
She runs a spiffy house up there too.

334
00:30:36,012 --> 00:30:38,420
You plan to spend
the rest of your life here?

335
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:40,675
I could do a lot worse.

336
00:30:46,315 --> 00:30:48,984
Listen, am I gonna learn to play
the big con or not?

337
00:30:49,193 --> 00:30:52,194
- What's your hurry?
- I want to play for Lonnegan.

338
00:30:52,905 --> 00:30:54,862
You know anything about the guy?

339
00:30:54,948 --> 00:30:57,784
Yeah, he croaked Luther.
Anything else I got to know?

340
00:31:05,668 --> 00:31:06,996
All right.

341
00:31:07,711 --> 00:31:11,756
He runs a numbers racket on the South
Side, owns a packinghouse, a few banks...

342
00:31:11,924 --> 00:31:14,711
Yeah, and half the politicians
in New York and Chicago.

343
00:31:14,927 --> 00:31:17,881
Not a fix in this world will cool him out
if he blows on you.

344
00:31:17,972 --> 00:31:19,632
- I'll get him anyway.
- Why?

345
00:31:20,183 --> 00:31:22,852
'Cause I don't know enough
about killing to kill him.

346
00:31:41,287 --> 00:31:42,995
You can't do it alone, you know.

347
00:31:43,081 --> 00:31:45,489
It takes some guys and money
to make them look good.

348
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:48,039
- I know lots of guys.
- It's not like playing winos.

349
00:31:48,128 --> 00:31:49,955
- You can't outrun Lonnegan.
- I don't play for winos.

350
00:31:50,046 --> 00:31:52,253
You've got to keep his con
after you take his money.

351
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,914
- He can't know you took him.
- You're scared of him.

352
00:31:55,177 --> 00:31:57,668
Right down to my socks, buster.

353
00:31:57,971 --> 00:31:59,928
This guy would kill a grifter...

354
00:32:00,015 --> 00:32:03,135
...over a chunk of money that
wouldn't support him for two days.

355
00:32:05,354 --> 00:32:07,097
You're going to go for him.

356
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:13,233
I don't want a hothead looking to get even,
coming back saying...

357
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,025
..."It ain't enough."
'Cause it's all we're gonna get.

358
00:32:21,495 --> 00:32:23,238
Can you get a mob together?

359
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:26,580
After what happened to Luther,
I can't get more than 300 guys.

360
00:32:31,797 --> 00:32:35,249
Luther said you learn fast.
I hope he's right.

361
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,536
Lonnegan gets most of his income
from the numbers...

362
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:12,745
...but he's putting more money
in his savings-and-loan business.

363
00:35:12,836 --> 00:35:14,746
- Think he's moving out of the racket?
- No.

364
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:16,796
He owns most of the stock and it's traded.

365
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:20,132
My guess is he's just trying
to build himself a respectable image.

366
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:21,499
He came out of Five Points...

367
00:35:21,595 --> 00:35:24,549
...but he's telling everybody
he was born in Forest Hills.

368
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,182
He knows the market, though.

369
00:35:26,267 --> 00:35:28,722
I don't think we can take him
on a stocks deal.

370
00:35:29,311 --> 00:35:30,474
What about the numbers?

371
00:35:30,563 --> 00:35:34,643
It's run out of a packinghouse on 14th
by a guy named Combs.

372
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:37,938
Lonnegan comes out every three weeks
to check on it, but...

373
00:35:38,029 --> 00:35:41,279
...he stays away from the day-to-day stuff
in case it's raided.

374
00:35:41,365 --> 00:35:44,450
These are two of Combs'
favorite torpedoes: Riley and Cole.

375
00:35:44,535 --> 00:35:45,698
You ever seen them?

376
00:35:48,998 --> 00:35:51,572
- No.
- They're the ones who hit Luther.

377
00:35:52,335 --> 00:35:54,328
They also got the numbers runner
you conned.

378
00:35:54,504 --> 00:35:58,632
A guy named Mottola. Found him
in a quarry with a knife in his eye.

379
00:35:59,717 --> 00:36:02,505
Lonnegan's had seven or eight people
rubbed on his way up.

380
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:07,139
His pattern is to get close to a racket boss,
learn the operation, then move in on it.

381
00:36:07,475 --> 00:36:09,966
He's done it to Gorman,
O'Donnell, Buchalman.

382
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,806
He took the numbers from Sharkey.
All four of these guys are dead.

383
00:36:14,691 --> 00:36:16,684
He's vindictive as hell, Henry.

384
00:36:16,776 --> 00:36:20,691
Kills for pride. Doesn't add up
he'd let Hooker get away from him.

385
00:36:21,907 --> 00:36:24,279
You see anything, kid, you let us know.

386
00:36:24,576 --> 00:36:27,862
If they put you on the spot,
we got to fold the con. You got that?

387
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,740
Yeah. You sure it's got to be
one of these two guys?

388
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:34,870
No. They're just the only ones we know of.

389
00:36:46,765 --> 00:36:48,473
Time.

390
00:36:58,944 --> 00:37:01,899
Set me up five more beers,
will you, Danny?

391
00:37:10,915 --> 00:37:13,204
- You the owner here?
- That's right.

392
00:37:13,835 --> 00:37:15,163
Lt. Snyder, Bunco.

393
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:19,705
That's a Joliet badge, Snyder.
Don't cut much up here.

394
00:37:20,383 --> 00:37:22,625
Looking for a guy on the lam
for counterfeiting.

395
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:24,842
- Thought he might be here.
- Don't think so.

396
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:27,551
I know everyone in the place.
I bounce the lamsters.

397
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,550
All right if I look around in here?

398
00:37:29,642 --> 00:37:33,391
No, but you're welcome
to a free beer before you go.

399
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,397
I don't really need your permission.

400
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,076
I don't know what to do with this guy.

401
00:37:49,162 --> 00:37:52,827
He's an Irishman who doesn't drink,
doesn't smoke and doesn't chase dames.

402
00:37:52,916 --> 00:37:55,039
He's a grand knight
in the Knights of Columbus.

403
00:37:55,127 --> 00:37:56,502
He only goes out to play faro.

404
00:37:56,587 --> 00:37:59,706
Sometimes plays 20 hours at a time.
Just him against the house.

405
00:37:59,798 --> 00:38:01,921
- Roulette, craps?
- He won't touch them.

406
00:38:02,342 --> 00:38:06,043
The croupier at Gilman's says
he never plays anything he can't win.

407
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,093
Sports?

408
00:38:07,264 --> 00:38:11,428
He likes to be seen with fighters,
but doesn't go to the fights or bet on them.

409
00:38:11,602 --> 00:38:14,556
Jesus. Does he do anything
where he's not alone?

410
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:16,647
Just poker.

411
00:38:18,108 --> 00:38:20,101
And he cheats.

412
00:38:20,986 --> 00:38:22,979
Pretty good at it, too.

413
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,450
Where does he play?

414
00:38:30,538 --> 00:38:33,622
The porters say he runs a braced game
on the Century Limited...

415
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:37,622
...when he comes here from New York.
$100 minimum, straight poker.

416
00:38:37,962 --> 00:38:40,749
A lot of high rollers ride that train
just to play him.

417
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:43,549
That sounds good, J.J.

418
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:51,218
Which way are the rooms?

419
00:38:51,643 --> 00:38:53,552
Who told you this guy was in here?

420
00:38:53,645 --> 00:38:56,218
Nobody. I just know
what kind of woman he likes.

421
00:38:56,439 --> 00:38:58,847
I'm gonna check all the joy houses
till I find him.

422
00:38:58,942 --> 00:39:01,314
Maybe I could help you
if you tell me his name.

423
00:39:01,695 --> 00:39:04,612
I doubt it. Which way are the rooms?

424
00:39:05,365 --> 00:39:08,816
Right through there.
But I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

425
00:39:09,077 --> 00:39:12,826
- What are you gonna do, call the cops?
- I don't have to.

426
00:39:13,457 --> 00:39:16,991
You'd be busting in
on the chief of police just up the hall.

427
00:39:26,845 --> 00:39:29,597
We'll play it out here.
A huge duke is too simple.

428
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:32,386
With no fix, we'll need a con
with a sure-fire blow-off.

429
00:39:32,476 --> 00:39:34,765
I think we ought to play this guy
on the payoff.

430
00:39:34,853 --> 00:39:37,854
It's the tightest game we got.
It's not all over the papers yet.

431
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,558
Lonnegan is a fast egg. He's not going
to sit still for a standard play.

432
00:39:41,652 --> 00:39:44,688
What does that leave us?
We can't con the payoff to a banker.

433
00:39:45,865 --> 00:39:46,896
We'll use the wire.

434
00:39:47,491 --> 00:39:50,113
Haven't known a player
didn't wanna beat the ponies.

435
00:39:50,202 --> 00:39:53,737
- The wire's been out of date for ten years.
- That's why he won't know it.

436
00:39:53,831 --> 00:39:55,658
I'm not sure I know it.

437
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,956
It'll take two of us working the inside.

438
00:39:58,628 --> 00:40:00,667
Any objections to Hooker as second man?

439
00:40:04,842 --> 00:40:08,922
All right. We'll give Lonnegan the hook
on the train and play him here.

440
00:40:09,013 --> 00:40:11,006
Do you think I can get in that poker game?

441
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:13,768
Just show up with a lot of money
and look like a sucker.

442
00:40:13,851 --> 00:40:14,966
I also gotta win.

443
00:40:16,145 --> 00:40:19,515
By the way, any of you guys
been passing bad money lately?

444
00:40:24,571 --> 00:40:27,358
If he comes again,
stall him so I can get a look at him.

445
00:40:40,754 --> 00:40:43,874
Fella named Stenner had this place
until about six months ago...

446
00:40:43,965 --> 00:40:45,792
...but he had to give it up.

447
00:40:46,802 --> 00:40:50,337
It doesn't look so good,
but maybe you can fix it up a little bit.

448
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:53,764
Watch your step when you come in.
There's a dip down to the left.

449
00:41:08,908 --> 00:41:11,577
- How does it look, Eddie?
- It looks all right, Kid.

450
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:14,489
- It's big enough, and it's off the street.
- I don't know.

451
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,447
It's kind of short notice. I'm not sure
we can get it done by Saturday.

452
00:41:18,584 --> 00:41:22,712
Got to. Gondorff's riding the mark down
from New York on the Century.

453
00:41:22,922 --> 00:41:26,291
We'll take it. Do you manage that building
at the end of the alley?

454
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:29,301
- For 15 years.
- I'll need a corner room facing this way.

455
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:31,676
- How much a week?
- Only rents by the month.

456
00:41:31,764 --> 00:41:33,389
$250 for the two of them.

457
00:41:34,809 --> 00:41:38,510
- Last time I expect to see you down here.
- Never heard of the place.

458
00:41:38,604 --> 00:41:41,060
It's been a while
since I stocked the wire store.

459
00:41:41,357 --> 00:41:43,184
Not many mobs playing that anymore.

460
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:45,976
All we'll need is the bookie setup for now.

461
00:41:46,362 --> 00:41:49,696
I'll rent you everything
I got in the warehouse for $2,000.

462
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:53,904
That'll give you phones, cages,
blackboards and ticker gear.

463
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,205
If you want a counter and bar,
that's another $1,000.

464
00:41:57,666 --> 00:42:00,869
- That's pretty steep, Benny.
- Gondorff's still a hot item.

465
00:42:00,961 --> 00:42:03,997
- Where would I be if he gets hit?
- Just give us what you can.

466
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:05,251
We'll send a truck.

467
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,009
How do you want to work this?
Flat rate or percentage?

468
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:10,465
- Who's the mark?
- Doyle Lonnegan.

469
00:42:14,433 --> 00:42:15,975
Flat rate.

470
00:42:31,408 --> 00:42:34,030
The guy in the black hat with the gimp.

471
00:42:43,546 --> 00:42:45,538
He's not as tough as he thinks.

472
00:42:45,965 --> 00:42:47,625
Neither are we.

473
00:42:52,138 --> 00:42:53,881
- Mr. Shaw?
- Right.

474
00:42:53,973 --> 00:42:55,218
You wanted to see me?

475
00:42:55,308 --> 00:42:58,677
I hear there's a friendly poker game
on this train. Know about it?

476
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:00,228
- A little.
- Thank you, sir.

477
00:43:00,313 --> 00:43:02,768
- Can you get me in that game?
- I don't know.

478
00:43:02,857 --> 00:43:04,600
There's usually a waiting list.

479
00:43:09,155 --> 00:43:11,480
That'll get you first alternate, sir.

480
00:43:17,122 --> 00:43:18,830
I'll see what I can do.

481
00:43:23,253 --> 00:43:24,118
Twist!

482
00:43:24,212 --> 00:43:27,297
- Patty, me boy! How are you?
- How are you, Twist?

483
00:43:27,591 --> 00:43:31,458
Champ, you're looking like a million!
Good to see you!

484
00:43:31,553 --> 00:43:34,126
Goldie, you old son of a gun.

485
00:43:34,389 --> 00:43:37,307
I saw the Kid in Denver.
He says to say hello to you.

486
00:43:37,392 --> 00:43:39,599
Joiner, are you still working those shapes?

487
00:43:39,686 --> 00:43:41,643
Any number you want, Twist!

488
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:44,482
- Good to see you again.
- Okay, Lacey. Good to see you.

489
00:43:44,566 --> 00:43:46,725
- It's good to see you.
- Dukey, how are you?

490
00:43:46,818 --> 00:43:47,732
Come on in.

491
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,607
- When did you get back in town?
- A couple of days ago.

492
00:43:50,697 --> 00:43:52,856
You heard about Luther Coleman,
didn't you?

493
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,820
Yes. The boys were passing the hat
for Alva and the kids.

494
00:43:55,911 --> 00:43:59,743
- I never seen the guys so worked up.
- Don't worry about it, Dukey.

495
00:44:00,124 --> 00:44:02,615
We're gonna send
a little calling card of our own.

496
00:44:02,877 --> 00:44:06,957
Gondorff is setting up a wire store.
I'll need a 20-man boost right away.

497
00:44:07,214 --> 00:44:10,464
I got plenty of talent out there tonight.
Take your pick. Lace!

498
00:44:10,801 --> 00:44:13,838
This is a tough one.
These boys have got to be the quill.

499
00:44:14,305 --> 00:44:17,721
Get me the sheet. Let's see who's in town.

500
00:44:18,226 --> 00:44:20,384
Patty, give me the sheet.

501
00:44:20,478 --> 00:44:21,758
Sure.

502
00:44:38,204 --> 00:44:40,161
Gondorff's already on...

503
00:44:49,215 --> 00:44:51,173
Twist, you know this guy?

504
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,472
No, I never saw him before.

505
00:44:57,974 --> 00:44:59,172
He's a dick, though.

506
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:11,359
Hello, Snyder.

507
00:45:11,446 --> 00:45:14,068
- What are you doing up here?
- I'm on vacation.

508
00:45:14,616 --> 00:45:16,775
You seen that friend of yours lately?

509
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:21,028
No, no. He packed it in.
Enrolled in detective school.

510
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:31,168
If you see him...

511
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,087
...you tell him he better pay up
before I get to him.

512
00:45:44,814 --> 00:45:46,641
That son of a bitch.

513
00:45:49,694 --> 00:45:51,271
Thanks, Lace.

514
00:45:51,446 --> 00:45:53,106
Let's see what we got here.

515
00:45:53,614 --> 00:45:55,987
Horse Face Lee, Slim Miller...

516
00:45:56,117 --> 00:45:59,818
...Suitcase Murphy and the Big Alabama
are in from New Orleans.

517
00:46:00,413 --> 00:46:02,986
Crying Jonesy and the Boone Kid
from Denver.

518
00:46:03,124 --> 00:46:06,623
Dippy Burke and Limehouse Chappie
from New York.

519
00:46:07,504 --> 00:46:11,252
These and the guys outside should
give you 30 or more to choose from.

520
00:46:11,341 --> 00:46:12,752
Good, Dukey.

521
00:46:12,842 --> 00:46:15,512
Have them down at Stenner's
old pool hall before 6:00.

522
00:46:15,595 --> 00:46:18,964
- We'll run the route tonight.
- Okay, Twist, but...

523
00:46:20,183 --> 00:46:23,683
...if this thing blows up, remember,
I can't do you no good downtown.

524
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,218
Gondorff is federal.

525
00:46:25,355 --> 00:46:27,727
Dukey, if this thing blows up...

526
00:46:28,024 --> 00:46:30,646
...the feds will be the least
of our problems.

527
00:46:47,002 --> 00:46:48,165
Yeah?

528
00:46:51,507 --> 00:46:53,630
- You in?
- Yeah, I think so.

529
00:46:53,717 --> 00:46:56,469
I gave the kayducer a C-note.
Did you find out the deck?

530
00:46:56,554 --> 00:46:59,305
He usually plays with a Tallyho Fan
or a Tallyho Circle.

531
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:00,967
I got you one of each.

532
00:47:01,058 --> 00:47:04,095
He likes to cold-deck low, eights or nines.

533
00:47:04,937 --> 00:47:07,060
That's nice work, J.J. Here.

534
00:47:31,339 --> 00:47:33,296
- I'm sorry.
- Don't mention it, ma'am.

535
00:48:26,604 --> 00:48:29,177
She picked him clean. He never missed it.

536
00:48:30,691 --> 00:48:33,609
My God, it looks like
he's expecting a big night.

537
00:48:33,694 --> 00:48:35,770
Must be $15,000-$20,000 here.

538
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:41,317
- He's waiting for you in the card room.
- Let him wait.

539
00:49:27,624 --> 00:49:29,416
Just worry about your end, kid.

540
00:49:30,043 --> 00:49:31,703
If we ever get to it.

541
00:49:34,089 --> 00:49:35,334
Excuse me.

542
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,043
You sure you checked this guy out?

543
00:49:38,135 --> 00:49:40,626
He seemed like a pleasant man,
a lot of cash on him.

544
00:49:40,721 --> 00:49:43,805
$200 suit, expensive luggage.
I'll vouch for him.

545
00:49:43,891 --> 00:49:47,509
- Why isn't he here then?
- Don't worry. He'll be here.

546
00:49:48,187 --> 00:49:49,562
All right.

547
00:49:59,991 --> 00:50:01,568
What're you doing?

548
00:50:04,495 --> 00:50:08,160
Always drink gin with a mark, kid.
He can't tell if you cut it.

549
00:50:09,584 --> 00:50:12,419
- $2,000 for you, Mr. Clayton.
- Thank you.

550
00:50:12,503 --> 00:50:14,959
All right, gentlemen.
Should we not wait for him?

551
00:50:15,048 --> 00:50:17,503
- Let's go.
- I think that's a good idea.

552
00:50:17,759 --> 00:50:19,585
Mr. Clemens, give me the cards.

553
00:50:28,645 --> 00:50:30,803
Sorry I'm late, guys. I was taking a crap.

554
00:50:31,773 --> 00:50:33,267
The name's Shaw.

555
00:50:33,692 --> 00:50:36,479
Mr. Shaw, meet Mr. Jameson
from Chicago.

556
00:50:37,487 --> 00:50:39,895
Mr. Lombard from Philadelphia.

557
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:42,659
- And Mr. Lonnegan from New York.
- Pleased to meet you.

558
00:50:42,742 --> 00:50:44,071
Mr. Clayton, Pittsburgh.

559
00:50:44,619 --> 00:50:48,368
Any of you guys want to make a little book
in Chicago, I'm the guy to see.

560
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:51,375
Game is straight poker...

561
00:50:52,336 --> 00:50:53,960
...$100 minimum, table stakes.

562
00:50:55,839 --> 00:51:00,051
Mr. Shaw, this is a gentleman's game.
We assume you're all good for your debts.

563
00:51:01,345 --> 00:51:04,761
- How much would you like, Mr. Shaw?
- I'll start with $5,000.

564
00:51:10,437 --> 00:51:15,183
We usually require a tie at this table.
If you don't have one, we can get you one.

565
00:51:15,609 --> 00:51:17,935
Hey, that'd be real nice of you,
Mr. Lonneman.

566
00:51:18,779 --> 00:51:19,775
Lonnegan.

567
00:51:35,254 --> 00:51:38,458
Name's Curly Jackson.
Worked for Gad Bryan out of Baldwin.

568
00:51:38,549 --> 00:51:39,830
Jackson?

569
00:51:40,968 --> 00:51:42,961
Jackson, Jackson. Oh, yeah.

570
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,341
Ever play the wire, Curly?

571
00:51:45,431 --> 00:51:49,346
Roped for it long ago. I can shill,
mark board, anything you want.

572
00:51:49,978 --> 00:51:52,729
I don't run with riffraff,
and I only drink on weekends.

573
00:51:53,898 --> 00:51:56,187
Me specialty's an Englishman.

574
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:01,819
We got a rack of suits over there.
Pick yourself a nice tweed one.

575
00:52:02,115 --> 00:52:04,688
That's all right. I've got all my own stuff.

576
00:52:11,082 --> 00:52:12,411
Doyle?

577
00:52:13,126 --> 00:52:14,371
One.

578
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:15,951
Bill?

579
00:52:17,255 --> 00:52:18,880
I'll take one.

580
00:52:20,384 --> 00:52:21,961
- Shaw?
- Three.

581
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,968
And the dealer will take one.

582
00:52:33,021 --> 00:52:34,350
Bet $500.

583
00:52:36,608 --> 00:52:37,984
I'll call.

584
00:52:40,154 --> 00:52:41,648
Call and raise.

585
00:52:44,241 --> 00:52:45,439
- $300.
- I'm out.

586
00:52:45,993 --> 00:52:47,487
Fold.

587
00:52:51,415 --> 00:52:52,874
Your three...

588
00:52:54,251 --> 00:52:55,829
...and raise...

589
00:52:56,587 --> 00:52:57,369
...$500.

590
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:01,417
That's eight to me.

591
00:53:06,514 --> 00:53:07,759
Call.

592
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:13,515
Jacks on top.

593
00:53:14,147 --> 00:53:15,475
Beats me.

594
00:53:19,402 --> 00:53:20,731
Three tens.

595
00:53:26,284 --> 00:53:27,695
Tough luck, Lonnihan.

596
00:53:27,786 --> 00:53:30,703
That's what you get for playing
with your head up your ass.

597
00:53:30,789 --> 00:53:33,494
Couple more like that
and we can all go to bed early.

598
00:53:35,335 --> 00:53:38,206
The name's Lonnegan. Doyle Lonnegan.

599
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:41,666
You'll remember that,
or you'll get yourself another game.

600
00:53:43,218 --> 00:53:44,629
You follow?

601
00:53:50,976 --> 00:53:52,554
Bring it right up here!

602
00:53:54,313 --> 00:53:57,646
Eddie, we brought you a tap
into Moe Anenberg's wire.

603
00:53:57,733 --> 00:54:01,813
You'll get race results, odds,
scratches, pole positions, everything.

604
00:54:01,904 --> 00:54:04,193
And just as fast
as Western Union gets them.

605
00:54:04,281 --> 00:54:08,030
- Does J.J. know how to use that thing?
- All he's got to do is read.

606
00:54:12,081 --> 00:54:14,406
The name is Joe Erie.

607
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,910
Joe Erie.

608
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:22,788
- You played for any particular mobs?
- No.

609
00:54:23,509 --> 00:54:25,965
- You ever play the wire before, Erie?
- No.

610
00:54:28,097 --> 00:54:30,932
I never played no big con before, but...

611
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:34,512
...Luther Coleman was a friend of mine,
and I thought maybe...

612
00:54:35,396 --> 00:54:37,188
...there'd be something I could do.

613
00:54:38,691 --> 00:54:40,933
You got that nose
in Duke Boudreau's tonight?

614
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,361
Yeah.

615
00:54:48,701 --> 00:54:51,905
You got moxie, Erie. Get yourself a suit.

616
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,533
Thanks.

617
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:04,842
I'll bet three.

618
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,635
Call and raise $200.

619
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,553
Call.

620
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:15,555
- No.
- I'm out.

621
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:18,059
Call.

622
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:20,733
Aces over.

623
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,438
Three cowboys.

624
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:26,063
All red, queen high.

625
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:30,486
- Well, that finishes me.
- Don't worry about it, pal.

626
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,952
They wouldn't have let you in
if you weren't a chump!

627
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,199
Lombard'll be joining you in a few minutes.

628
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:41,833
I've had enough of this game
and quite enough of this company.

629
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,957
Check me out, Clemens.

630
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:47,174
I guess that just leaves the three of us.

631
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:51,045
Yes, Mr. Shaw. That just leaves us three.

632
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:54,302
Mr. Clayton, I think we should
take a break for five minutes.

633
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:56,801
Tempers seem to be running a little high.

634
00:55:57,313 --> 00:55:59,934
Come on, Linneman,
I was just starting to do good.

635
00:56:11,703 --> 00:56:14,869
- Stack me a cooler.
- We'll be in the station in an hour.

636
00:56:14,956 --> 00:56:17,198
The others are the losers.
You're still okay.

637
00:56:17,292 --> 00:56:20,625
Fix me a deck. Threes and nines.
I'll cut it in on Clayton's deal.

638
00:56:20,712 --> 00:56:22,206
What do you want Clayton to get?

639
00:56:22,297 --> 00:56:26,342
Nothing. I want him out of there early.
I'll bust that bastard bookie in one play.

640
00:56:30,972 --> 00:56:33,298
$400 to you, Mr. Jameson. You're even.

641
00:56:34,267 --> 00:56:36,011
It just wasn't my night.

642
00:56:52,369 --> 00:56:53,744
I need it.

643
00:56:53,829 --> 00:56:56,035
- You know what time we get in?
- No, I don't.

644
00:56:57,624 --> 00:56:58,953
Hey, where's your ante?

645
00:57:06,926 --> 00:57:10,544
Every time I had anything,
he stayed in front of me.

646
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:35,150
$500.

647
00:57:38,666 --> 00:57:40,410
Your five. $1,000.

648
00:57:42,712 --> 00:57:44,087
I'll fold.

649
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:47,831
I'll play.

650
00:57:49,678 --> 00:57:51,053
Cards?

651
00:57:52,347 --> 00:57:53,627
Two.

652
00:57:58,395 --> 00:57:59,308
Three.

653
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:29,213
$500.

654
00:58:31,929 --> 00:58:34,965
Your $500 and $1,000.

655
00:58:43,524 --> 00:58:46,442
Your $1,000. I'll raise you $2,000.

656
00:58:51,157 --> 00:58:53,233
Your $2,000.

657
00:58:57,497 --> 00:58:59,370
Mr. Clemens...

658
00:58:59,749 --> 00:59:01,789
...give me $10,000 more.

659
00:59:47,089 --> 00:59:48,334
I'll call.

660
00:59:50,342 --> 00:59:52,169
Four nines.

661
01:00:02,104 --> 01:00:02,970
Four jacks.

662
01:00:14,742 --> 01:00:16,782
You owe me $15,000, pal.

663
01:00:31,134 --> 01:00:32,877
Must've left my wallet in my room.

664
01:00:33,094 --> 01:00:34,921
Don't hand me any of that crap!

665
01:00:35,013 --> 01:00:37,136
When you come to a game,
you bring your money!

666
01:00:37,223 --> 01:00:39,181
How do I know you won't take a powder?

667
01:00:39,601 --> 01:00:41,060
I'll tell you what I'll do.

668
01:00:41,686 --> 01:00:43,928
I'll send a boy to your room
in five minutes.

669
01:00:44,022 --> 01:00:47,473
Better have the money or it'll be
all around Chicago that you welched.

670
01:00:47,567 --> 01:00:49,690
You won't be able to get a game of jacks!

671
01:00:50,362 --> 01:00:52,319
Cash me in for the rest of these bums.

672
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:10,169
You're on, kid.

673
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:13,506
But I tell you, it's a hard act to follow.

674
01:01:13,594 --> 01:01:15,919
- How did it go?
- We got working money.

675
01:01:18,766 --> 01:01:20,723
- He's steaming.
- Yeah.

676
01:01:20,809 --> 01:01:22,220
Watch yourself.

677
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:32,811
Doyle, I know I gave him four threes!

678
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,614
He had to make a switch!
We can't let him get away with it.

679
01:01:36,784 --> 01:01:40,034
What was I supposed to do?
Call him for cheating better than me?

680
01:01:59,432 --> 01:02:01,176
Name's Kelly. Shaw sent me.

681
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:12,275
Your boss is quite a card player, Mr. Kelly.
How does he do it?

682
01:02:13,989 --> 01:02:14,902
He cheats.

683
01:02:16,992 --> 01:02:20,076
In that case, I'll keep my money,
and we'll have another game.

684
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:22,197
You don't have any to keep.

685
01:02:26,251 --> 01:02:29,003
Here's your wallet.
He hired a dame to take it from you.

686
01:02:30,297 --> 01:02:32,539
He's been planning
to beat your game for months.

687
01:02:32,633 --> 01:02:35,717
He's been waiting for you to cheat him
so he could clip you.

688
01:02:36,887 --> 01:02:39,841
Who do you think you're talking to?
Nobody sets me up!

689
01:02:39,932 --> 01:02:42,553
Take him back to the baggage room!
Put one in his ear!

690
01:02:42,643 --> 01:02:44,552
There were four witnesses at that table!

691
01:02:44,645 --> 01:02:48,690
Then get that other son of a bitch
and dump them in the first tunnel.

692
01:02:48,774 --> 01:02:50,897
We'll be in the station in a few minutes!

693
01:02:50,985 --> 01:02:53,986
It ain't gonna look too good
killing a guy you owe money to.

694
01:02:55,364 --> 01:02:57,855
There's better ways of taking him down.

695
01:03:01,912 --> 01:03:05,661
What do you think Shaw would do to me
if he knew I was telling you this?

696
01:03:08,461 --> 01:03:09,836
Okay.

697
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:13,465
Why the rat?

698
01:03:19,639 --> 01:03:23,174
I want to take over his operation,
and I need you to help me break him.

699
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:33,316
- Where's my money?
- Shaw's got it.

700
01:03:33,653 --> 01:03:35,776
How the hell could I ask him for it back?

701
01:03:38,283 --> 01:03:40,074
We're pulling in.

702
01:03:46,833 --> 01:03:48,327
I'm giving you a lift home.

703
01:03:49,669 --> 01:03:52,670
- I was supposed to go with Shaw.
- Explain it to him somehow.

704
01:03:52,756 --> 01:03:55,425
- But he's expecting me.
- I'm giving you a lift home.

705
01:03:56,301 --> 01:03:57,215
You follow?

706
01:04:01,431 --> 01:04:04,136
Yeah, sure. Sure thing.

707
01:04:28,626 --> 01:04:32,291
- Why do you think you can beat him?
- I've been planning this for two years.

708
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:34,586
I know his organization
backwards and forwards.

709
01:04:34,674 --> 01:04:37,247
I need somebody who's respectable
but not legit.

710
01:04:37,343 --> 01:04:39,549
I'm a banker. That's legit in this state.

711
01:04:39,637 --> 01:04:41,677
Just put down a bet for me
at Shaw's place.

712
01:04:41,764 --> 01:04:45,264
I'll do the rest. I'll supply the money.
I'll supply the information.

713
01:04:45,977 --> 01:04:47,851
What about the money
you come to collect?

714
01:04:47,937 --> 01:04:50,724
I'll tell him you paid it.
I keep his books. He trusts me.

715
01:04:50,815 --> 01:04:54,267
If you help me, I'll pay back the money
he stole out of my own pocket.

716
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,483
- It's worth that much to you?
- Yeah.

717
01:04:57,197 --> 01:05:00,198
Oh, yeah. Maybe a couple of million.

718
01:05:06,998 --> 01:05:09,205
Where do you come from, Kelly?

719
01:05:10,502 --> 01:05:13,419
From the east side of New York.
A place called Five Points.

720
01:05:14,256 --> 01:05:17,173
- But I got out of there.
- Out and up, huh?

721
01:05:20,846 --> 01:05:25,259
I'll have to keep you away from this guy.
You're liable to get ideas.

722
01:05:42,993 --> 01:05:44,820
I'll be at Klein's Drug Store...

723
01:05:44,912 --> 01:05:48,495
...660 South Marshall at 1:30,
if you're interested.

724
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:52,078
If I'm not there by 1:45, I'm not coming.

725
01:07:05,536 --> 01:07:07,410
Hey, Hooker, how did it go?

726
01:07:07,496 --> 01:07:08,777
Jake.

727
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:14,085
- Everything go okay?
- Yeah, sure. Hell, easy.

728
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:26,548
- No sign of trouble?
- No.

729
01:07:26,641 --> 01:07:28,966
- What about Lonnegan?
- I gave him the breakdown.

730
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:31,977
- And?
- He's good. He threatened to kill me.

731
01:07:32,605 --> 01:07:35,523
If they don't do that,
you know you're not getting to them.

732
01:07:53,918 --> 01:07:55,413
Hello, Doyle.

733
01:07:56,421 --> 01:07:58,544
All right, Riley, what the hell happened?

734
01:07:59,257 --> 01:08:00,455
We missed him.

735
01:08:00,884 --> 01:08:03,007
Whoever he is, he made a fool out of you.

736
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:05,924
There was no way he could've known
we was in that room.

737
01:08:06,014 --> 01:08:10,094
- Somebody must've wised him up.
- What does Cole say about that?

738
01:08:10,811 --> 01:08:14,595
- I don't know. He took it hard.
- Get out of here, Riley.

739
01:08:15,816 --> 01:08:17,476
Put Salino onto it.

740
01:08:17,734 --> 01:08:21,400
Salino? Why waste our best people
on a small-time job?

741
01:08:21,822 --> 01:08:24,194
This is a nickel-and-dime grifter
we're after.

742
01:08:24,283 --> 01:08:26,359
- They'll get him.
- They had their chance.

743
01:08:26,452 --> 01:08:29,406
All they did was shoot up a neighborhood,
wake up a few cops.

744
01:08:29,496 --> 01:08:32,118
- But that was...
- I told you to put Salino onto it.

745
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:36,161
It may take a little more time,
but there won't be any holes.

746
01:08:36,253 --> 01:08:38,460
Tell Cole I wanna see him
when he comes in.

747
01:08:38,672 --> 01:08:41,876
He won't be coming in,
not to get bounced off a job, anyway.

748
01:08:41,967 --> 01:08:44,375
This is Salino's job, Vince.

749
01:08:45,388 --> 01:08:47,511
Cole wants to muscle in,
that's his business.

750
01:08:47,598 --> 01:08:49,887
He's breaking the rules
and Salino won't like it.

751
01:08:49,976 --> 01:08:51,600
Now, get me the books.

752
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:34,515
Those odds on the third race are wrong.

753
01:09:35,021 --> 01:09:36,681
Just a minute. I'll get them.

754
01:09:37,232 --> 01:09:40,150
Don't worry so much.
You're gonna be all right.

755
01:09:40,986 --> 01:09:43,559
Just stay to the back the first time around.

756
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:48,822
Put a little of this on your nose.

757
01:10:32,622 --> 01:10:33,820
Kelly?

758
01:10:38,836 --> 01:10:41,672
You should always look to the back, kid.

759
01:10:41,756 --> 01:10:44,247
I was afraid you wouldn't show.
We don't have much time.

760
01:10:44,342 --> 01:10:45,587
Get on with it, then.

761
01:10:47,345 --> 01:10:49,137
Sometime after 2:00...

762
01:10:49,264 --> 01:10:53,048
...a guy's gonna call on that phone
and give you the name of a horse.

763
01:10:53,977 --> 01:10:56,894
All you got to do
is take this $2,000 across the street...

764
01:10:57,105 --> 01:11:00,688
...to Shaw's place, and bet it on that pony.
There's nothing to it.

765
01:11:00,901 --> 01:11:04,898
Don't take too much time. We've only got
four minutes after you get the call.

766
01:11:05,322 --> 01:11:07,314
You'll not break him with a $2,000 bet.

767
01:11:07,532 --> 01:11:09,655
This is just a test.
The big one comes later.

768
01:11:09,743 --> 01:11:11,652
Be careful with that. That's all I got.

769
01:11:12,079 --> 01:11:14,367
You were gonna pay me back
out of your own pocket?

770
01:11:14,456 --> 01:11:15,120
I am.

771
01:11:15,624 --> 01:11:16,739
After the race.

772
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:21,163
I got to get back before Shaw misses me.
Good luck.

773
01:12:17,812 --> 01:12:20,101
Yeah? Go ahead.

774
01:12:20,357 --> 01:12:22,266
<i>The horse is Blue Note to win.</i>

775
01:12:22,359 --> 01:12:24,897
<i>- Fourth race at Narragansett.

776
01:12:47,176 --> 01:12:48,041
Yeah?

it's Speed Queen the winner!</i>

<i>Taking off at 23.</i>

785
01:13:49,614 --> 01:13:51,524
Look at that.

786
01:13:53,034 --> 01:13:54,493
He's got his apes with him.

787
01:13:55,871 --> 01:13:57,828
We'll have to do something about that.

788

<i>Bubblesome is 10, Beefsteak, 7...</i>

793
01:14:16,016 --> 01:14:19,219

794

799

I'd think you'd get tired of losing, Harrigan.

800
01:14:42,835 --> 01:14:45,670
Thank you, Mr. Williams.

801
01:14:45,755 --> 01:14:49,705
Blue Note, $2,000 to win fourth race,
Narragansett.

802
01:14:50,051 --> 01:14:51,960
Make sure you see the cash, Eddie.

803
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:54,878
He's got a name for betting money
he doesn't have.

804
01:14:57,684 --> 01:15:01,384
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this is Arnold Rowe,
your caller for the fourth race.</i>

<i>The flag is up, and they're off and running.</i>

808
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:16,319
<i>It's Bubblesome going to the front,
followed by Lady Higloss...</i>

<i>...and Blue Note trails the field.</i>

811
01:15:20,707 --> 01:15:23,281
<i>Around the clubhouse turn,

<i>Into the second turn,

815
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,667
<i>Lady Higloss driving
on the rail and Vote Boy.</i>

816
01:15:33,762 --> 01:15:36,336
<i>Then Bubblesome, Beefsteak,
Kerry Patch and Blue Note.</i>

817
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:37,345
Come on, Chancing!

818
01:15:38,559 --> 01:15:40,598
<i>Lady Higloss a half, Vote Boy by one.</i>

819
01:15:40,811 --> 01:15:44,310
Lady Higloss is a hell of a finisher.
Chancing's gonna have to open up.

820
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:49,433
Know anything about a horse
named Blue Note?

821
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:53,230
He never done much. Probably in there
just to round out the field.

822
01:15:53,449 --> 01:15:55,691
Chancing's where you
want to have your money.

823
01:15:59,663 --> 01:16:03,115
- Great tip you handed me, kid.
- Just give him time.

824
01:16:03,209 --> 01:16:04,205
<i>Chancing by one.</i>

825
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:06,369
<i>And here's Blue Note,
driving on the outside!</i>

826
01:16:06,462 --> 01:16:08,834
<i>- Nice work, Erie. He loves you.
- He's third!</i>

827
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:13,046
<i>Chancing is shortening stride,
and now it's Lady Higloss and Blue Note.</i>

828
01:16:13,386 --> 01:16:15,628
<i>They're head to head.
They're neck to neck.</i>

829
01:16:15,722 --> 01:16:18,758
<i>It's Lady Higloss, Blue Note.
Lady Higloss, Blue Note.</i>

830
01:16:19,017 --> 01:16:22,101
<i>And Blue Note wins it by a nose!</i>

831
01:16:22,228 --> 01:16:25,562
<i>Lady Higloss is second by three,
and Chancing is third by one.</i>

832
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,938
Who in the blazes is Blue Note?

833
01:16:30,236 --> 01:16:33,985
<i>The winner, Blue Note,
paid $16, $9.40 and $6.</i>

834
01:16:34,324 --> 01:16:38,322
So you want to have your money
on Chancing?

835
01:16:38,703 --> 01:16:40,743
<i>Chancing paid $3.80.</i>

836
01:16:40,872 --> 01:16:42,497
<i>Time for the mile and one-sixteenth.</i>

837
01:16:53,176 --> 01:16:55,418
<i>They're going to the gate at Belmont.</i>

838
01:16:55,554 --> 01:16:57,262
<i>And here are the late odds.</i>

839
01:16:57,389 --> 01:16:59,049
Those garbage men belong to you?

840
01:16:59,933 --> 01:17:03,598
Get them out of here and don't
bring them back. This is a class joint.

841
01:17:03,896 --> 01:17:05,306
Hey, you!

842
01:17:05,606 --> 01:17:07,183
- Kelly!
- Yes, sir?

843
01:17:07,483 --> 01:17:08,977
Run those bums out of here.

844
01:17:11,695 --> 01:17:14,945
- Mr. Shaw, could I...
- Don't give me any of your lip, kid.

845
01:17:15,324 --> 01:17:17,067
Now, run them out of here.

846
01:17:23,624 --> 01:17:26,708
<i>Time for the three-quarter mile: 1:11.4.</i>

847
01:17:26,961 --> 01:17:32,382
<i>The winner, Panic Relief,
paid $12.40, $8.20 and $5.</i>

848
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,086
<i>Barbara A, $6.20 and $4.</i>

849
01:17:36,345 --> 01:17:38,967
<i>Wilder paid $4.</i>

850
01:17:39,682 --> 01:17:42,351
<i>They're at the post at Belmont at 38.</i>

851
01:17:42,602 --> 01:17:45,935
<i>We're waiting on one.
I'll call Belmont next.</i>

852
01:17:46,731 --> 01:17:47,846
That's it, fellas!

853
01:17:52,946 --> 01:17:55,484
- I want to repeat that...
- All right, J.J.

854
01:18:00,745 --> 01:18:02,537
What do you say, pal?

855
01:18:12,465 --> 01:18:14,008
Yeah?

856
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:20,672
He's on his way.

857
01:18:34,446 --> 01:18:35,857
Hi, Mutt.

858
01:18:37,032 --> 01:18:38,443
Say, Jeff.

859
01:18:40,119 --> 01:18:43,036
- What'd I tell you?
- You got lucky once. That's not enough.

860
01:18:43,122 --> 01:18:44,949
Lucky, hell. I can do it every time.

861
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:49,205
- Why don't you then?
- It's better to do it all at once.

862
01:18:50,212 --> 01:18:52,620
We're gonna put down $400,000 next week.

863
01:18:52,715 --> 01:18:54,791
At 5-1 odds, that's $2 million.

864
01:18:55,009 --> 01:18:57,500
- Twenty percent is yours.
- Got a system, Kelly?

865
01:18:58,888 --> 01:19:01,509
No. You can still lose with a system.

866
01:19:01,682 --> 01:19:03,390
You're past-posting, aren't you?

867
01:19:08,606 --> 01:19:10,148
Could be.

868
01:19:10,692 --> 01:19:11,890
How?

869
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:13,891
You're gonna stay in?

870
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:15,648
Not until I get some answers.

871
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:22,783
I got a partner downtown.

872
01:19:23,371 --> 01:19:25,613
He runs the central office
of the Western Union.

873
01:19:25,707 --> 01:19:27,996
Race results from
all over the country come in...

874
01:19:28,084 --> 01:19:30,243
...and go across his desk to the bookies.

875
01:19:30,337 --> 01:19:34,797
All he does is hold them up until he can
call us to get a bet down on the winner.

876
01:19:34,883 --> 01:19:36,959
Then he releases the results
to the bookies.

877
01:19:37,052 --> 01:19:40,302
We clean up on a race
that's already been run. You can't miss.

878
01:19:40,388 --> 01:19:42,714
Unless the Western Union dicks
get ahold of it.

879
01:19:51,233 --> 01:19:52,976
You got the $400,000 yet?

880
01:19:53,443 --> 01:19:55,317
No, not yet, but...

881
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:59,862
- There's only $1,000 here.
- Make another bet tomorrow.

882
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:01,321
Where's my money?

883
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:03,818
- I got $16,000 coming.
- You owe me $15,000 already.

884
01:20:03,912 --> 01:20:07,079
If your setup's as good as you say,
there's plenty more to come.

885
01:20:07,166 --> 01:20:10,866
- I decide when to place the bets!
- Not if you want me to keep making them.

886
01:20:10,961 --> 01:20:13,998
I must talk to my partner.
We can't afford to expose too much.

887
01:20:14,089 --> 01:20:15,667
- I'll talk to him myself.
- No!

888
01:20:15,925 --> 01:20:19,341
You've been waiting a long time for this.
Don't ruin it for yourself.

889
01:20:19,428 --> 01:20:23,011
I'll pick you up tomorrow at 3:00.
You follow?

890
01:20:57,133 --> 01:20:59,506
I told him the tale, but he didn't go for it.

891
01:20:59,594 --> 01:21:01,753
He wants to see my partner
tomorrow at 3:00.

892
01:21:01,846 --> 01:21:03,305
<i>- 3:00?
- Yeah.</i>

893
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:06,640
We can't get a telegraph store set up.
Can we talk him out of it?

894
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:09,727
No. I would've stalled him,
but I didn't have any help.

895
01:21:11,106 --> 01:21:14,142
We'll have to play him on the fly.
I'll put Eddie to work.

896
01:21:14,234 --> 01:21:17,188
<i>- Let me know when you got something.
- Sure thing, tootsie.</i>

897
01:21:18,614 --> 01:21:20,523
All right, Hooker!

898
01:21:28,374 --> 01:21:30,331
Stop him!

899
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:43,531
Hooker! Hooker!

900
01:22:43,617 --> 01:22:46,487
I'll get you, you rat!

901
01:22:53,585 --> 01:22:55,911
Why didn't you tell me
about Snyder before?

902
01:22:56,004 --> 01:22:58,293
- I thought I'd lost him.
- You found him again.

903
01:22:58,382 --> 01:23:00,588
We'll have to do something about it.

904
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:03,760
- What else haven't you been telling me?
- Nothing. That's all.

905
01:23:03,846 --> 01:23:05,305
Hold still.

906
01:23:06,015 --> 01:23:07,924
Why did you move out of your room?

907
01:23:08,893 --> 01:23:10,636
It was too noisy.

908
01:23:11,061 --> 01:23:14,312
You can't play your friends like marks.

909
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:17,608
You know how easy it would be
for Lonnegan's guys to get you?

910
01:23:17,693 --> 01:23:19,271
All we need is a couple of days...

911
01:23:19,487 --> 01:23:21,776
...and we can nail the son of a bitch.

912
01:23:22,782 --> 01:23:24,905
You just won't learn, will you?

913
01:23:24,992 --> 01:23:28,444
I come in here, teach you stuff
that maybe five guys in the world know.

914
01:23:28,621 --> 01:23:30,661
Stuff most grifters couldn't do.

915
01:23:30,748 --> 01:23:34,200
- All you want to do is run down a bullet.
- I'm asking a couple of days.

916
01:23:34,294 --> 01:23:36,203
I can stay clear that long!

917
01:23:38,715 --> 01:23:41,632
Christ, they'll probably miss you
and hit me.

918
01:24:17,754 --> 01:24:19,913
- Hey.
- Hi.

919
01:24:20,883 --> 01:24:22,875
What will you have?

920
01:24:23,385 --> 01:24:27,134
- Give me the blue plate special.
- One blue plate special.

921
01:24:58,338 --> 01:25:00,211
- You're done?
- Yeah.

922
01:25:00,298 --> 01:25:03,583
- Guess I should've had the meat loaf.
- It isn't any better.

923
01:25:07,514 --> 01:25:09,755
- Hey, where's June?
- She quit.

924
01:25:10,099 --> 01:25:13,800
I'm filling in for her a couple of days
until I can get a train out of here.

925
01:25:14,187 --> 01:25:15,515
Yeah? Where are you going?

926
01:25:15,855 --> 01:25:18,809
I don't know.
Depends on what train I get on.

927
01:25:24,865 --> 01:25:27,819
- Keep it.
- Thanks.

928
01:25:44,468 --> 01:25:46,211
Let's go.

929
01:26:08,659 --> 01:26:11,613
Excuse me, ma'am,
but we're looking for Mr...

930
01:26:11,787 --> 01:26:13,330
Mr. Harmont's office.

931
01:26:13,414 --> 01:26:15,288
- Mr. Harmon?
- Yeah.

932
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:17,622
Got a work order for a painting job.

933
01:26:17,752 --> 01:26:19,579
- For Mr. Harmon's office?
- That's right.

934
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:21,710
Well, hold on. Just a second.

935
01:26:39,232 --> 01:26:41,805
- Where to?
- 110 South Wabash.

936
01:26:42,068 --> 01:26:44,690
110 South Wabash. Get going.

937
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:49,234
What happened to your face?

938
01:26:49,326 --> 01:26:51,817
Got into a fight with a raggle
down on 13th.

939
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,698
Cut me with her ring.

940
01:26:54,372 --> 01:26:55,915
You ought to lay off the skirts.

941
01:26:56,541 --> 01:27:00,160
You don't find any of my boys
messing around with that kind of trash.

942
01:27:09,179 --> 01:27:12,679
Brigham signed it, all right.
I can't understand why he didn't tell me.

943
01:27:12,766 --> 01:27:14,558
He's like all them supervisors.

944
01:27:14,643 --> 01:27:16,802
They think they're too good
for regular people.

945
01:27:16,895 --> 01:27:19,433
He says he was here
and the place was a mess.

946
01:27:19,523 --> 01:27:21,646
We'll hurry so we don't keep you
out too long.

947
01:27:21,817 --> 01:27:23,442
Why can't I work with you in here?

948
01:27:23,694 --> 01:27:26,944
We got to cover the floor and the furniture,
so we don't spill.

949
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:30,574
If you want to sit in here with a tarp
over your head, go ahead.

950
01:27:31,035 --> 01:27:32,114
How long will you be?

951
01:27:32,203 --> 01:27:34,528
An hour or two at the most.
It's a small job.

952
01:28:21,753 --> 01:28:23,461
We'll go in the side door here.

953
01:28:35,017 --> 01:28:36,926
Hiya, Les.

954
01:28:37,019 --> 01:28:38,513
Les, this is Doyle Lonnegan.

955
01:28:38,604 --> 01:28:40,929
- Mr. Lonnegan, this is Les Harmon.
- How do you do?

956
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:43,481
What did you bring him here for?

957
01:28:43,567 --> 01:28:45,560
I thought that he should see the operation.

958
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:48,737
I'm having the place painted.
We can't talk in here now.

959
01:28:50,282 --> 01:28:53,117
We'll have to find someplace else.
Excuse me, Mr. Lonnegan.

960
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:01,077
<i>Miss Barnes, I'm going home a little early.</i>

961
01:29:01,168 --> 01:29:04,917
<i>If there are any calls, tell them
they can reach me here tomorrow morning.</i>

962
01:29:06,799 --> 01:29:08,922
Mr. Lonnegan?

963
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:42,750
I want to see it one more time.

964
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:45,623
I can't do it.
We got telegraph inspectors everywhere.

965
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:47,422
One more time won't make a difference.

966
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:50,045
We got $400,000
coming in from the coast next week.

967
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:52,507
You gonna risk that on a lousy 15 G's?

968
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:55,883
If it works again tomorrow,
I'll finance the whole thing.

969
01:29:56,725 --> 01:29:59,892
$500,000. 60-40, we split.

970
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:03,264
We've already got a guy.
He's gonna give us half.

971
01:30:03,357 --> 01:30:06,311
- What am I supposed to say to him?
- Say to him what you want.

972
01:30:07,277 --> 01:30:09,187
Knowing your operation, if I were you...

973
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:11,486
...I'd be worried about making me happy.

974
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:14,325
Your guy says a week.
How do we know it won't be a month?

975
01:30:14,410 --> 01:30:17,529
Lonnegan's a banker. He can get
the money without any questions.

976
01:30:17,621 --> 01:30:20,575
We can't keep going into Shaw's
and cleaning up on long shots.

977
01:30:20,666 --> 01:30:24,082
- He's bound to get wise.
- All right. We'll go for short odds.

978
01:30:25,087 --> 01:30:26,712
You follow?

979
01:30:47,694 --> 01:30:49,567
Are you Lt. William Snyder?

980
01:30:51,197 --> 01:30:52,857
I don't know. What's up?

981
01:30:53,324 --> 01:30:55,151
FBI.

982
01:30:55,994 --> 01:30:58,366
Special Agent Polk would like
a few words with you.

983
01:30:58,455 --> 01:30:59,913
You got a couple of minutes?

984
01:31:00,665 --> 01:31:02,124
Yeah, sure.

985
01:31:29,736 --> 01:31:31,859
No. It's got to be south of the river.

986
01:31:31,947 --> 01:31:36,692
Probably this section in here.
31st, 39th, Morgan and Halsted.

987
01:31:36,785 --> 01:31:39,656
Now, that's this section here.

988
01:31:40,497 --> 01:31:44,080
Now, let's break it
into two sections along 35th.

989
01:31:45,211 --> 01:31:47,666
What the hell is this? I got work to do.

990
01:31:48,506 --> 01:31:50,545
Sit down and shut up, will you?

991
01:31:50,966 --> 01:31:53,636
Try not to live up to all my expectations.

992
01:31:54,887 --> 01:31:59,466
Take two men along. Work your way south
from 31st to 35th, Morgan and Halsted.

993
01:31:59,558 --> 01:32:02,096
Go into every place
and let me know what you find.

994
01:32:09,318 --> 01:32:12,522
We've been told, you know a hustle artist
named Johnny Hooker.

995
01:32:13,489 --> 01:32:16,063
- Do you know him?
- Yeah, but I don't know where he is.

996
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:20,620
Well, we do. He's chumming around
with a big C named Henry Gondorff.

997
01:32:21,873 --> 01:32:22,822
Ring any bells?

998
01:32:23,166 --> 01:32:25,324
Every bunco man in the country
knows Gondorff.

999
01:32:25,585 --> 01:32:28,835
Well, there's word he's gonna run a con
on the South Side here.

1000
01:32:29,464 --> 01:32:32,631
We've got a Florida warrant on him,
but it's a thin beef.

1001
01:32:32,717 --> 01:32:36,051
He can beat it in court
unless we catch him cold.

1002
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:39,052
All we want you to do
is pick up Hooker for us.

1003
01:32:39,224 --> 01:32:41,133
Why don't you pick him up yourself?

1004
01:32:42,144 --> 01:32:46,188
If word gets out the feds are in on it,
Gondorff will fold up the whole thing.

1005
01:32:46,398 --> 01:32:47,976
Wouldn't that be too bad?

1006
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:51,520
Then you'd have to move out
of this nice office you've got here.

1007
01:32:53,989 --> 01:32:56,361
Don't crack wise with me, flatfoot.

1008
01:32:56,992 --> 01:33:00,195
I spent too much time in dumps like this
eating Gondorff's dust...

1009
01:33:00,287 --> 01:33:03,490
...while you guys in the bunco squads
get rich tipping him off!

1010
01:33:03,707 --> 01:33:05,866
That's not gonna happen this time.

1011
01:33:06,502 --> 01:33:08,993
We're not gonna tell the police we're here.

1012
01:33:09,797 --> 01:33:13,664
You keep your mouth shut and do a job,
there'll be reward bucks in it for you.

1013
01:33:14,134 --> 01:33:18,132
And you better take it, 'cause
I can make you work for us without it.

1014
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:20,967
What the hell good is Hooker to you?

1015
01:33:21,767 --> 01:33:24,139
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.

1016
01:33:25,313 --> 01:33:27,886
- He'll never do it.
- I think he will.

1017
01:33:51,172 --> 01:33:53,165
He's there. Let's get on it.

1018
01:33:54,968 --> 01:33:56,842
What's the line on Exponent?

1019
01:33:58,263 --> 01:33:59,722
5-1.

1020
01:34:00,932 --> 01:34:02,759
- How's it going?
- Nothing yet.

1021
01:34:03,184 --> 01:34:06,139
I had a good one on the lead
at Lincoln Fields, but he faded.

1022
01:34:06,229 --> 01:34:11,057
Best we had the last hour was Love Potion
at Rockingham and she was 5-1.

1023
01:34:11,443 --> 01:34:14,230
All the long shots coming in today.

1024
01:34:14,863 --> 01:34:16,820
Take 4-1 if you have to.

1025
01:34:16,907 --> 01:34:18,366
Okay.

1026
01:34:20,327 --> 01:34:21,952
You can forget the boodle, Eddie.

1027
01:34:22,371 --> 01:34:25,325
He could hit us for $15,000 at 4-1.
We can't handle that.

1028
01:34:25,833 --> 01:34:27,742
- Give him the shutout.
- Okay.

1029
01:34:28,210 --> 01:34:30,666
Okay, Billie, here we go.

1030
01:34:31,422 --> 01:34:34,173
At the wire, it's Wrecking Crew,
the winner by five.

1031
01:34:34,258 --> 01:34:37,757
Black Mischief, second. Whichaway, third.

1032
01:34:38,095 --> 01:34:42,140
Wrecking Crew was 3-1. That's our boy.

1033
01:34:46,145 --> 01:34:47,094
Henry?

1034
01:34:51,233 --> 01:34:53,903
Here we go. We got a 3-1 at Belmont.
Wrecking Crew.

1035
01:35:19,471 --> 01:35:22,388
<i>- Yeah?
- In the sixth race at Belmont.</i>

1036
01:35:22,474 --> 01:35:25,225
<i>Wrecking Crew to win,
Black Mischief to place...</i>

1037
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:26,769
<i>...Whichaway to show.</i>

1038
01:35:37,948 --> 01:35:39,359
Wait here.

1039
01:35:43,829 --> 01:35:46,236
<i>The winner, Time to Go, paid $7...</i>

1040
01:35:46,498 --> 01:35:48,870
<i>...$5.40 and $3.80.</i>

1041
01:35:49,084 --> 01:35:52,204
<i>Joy Flag, $6 and $4.20.</i>

1042
01:35:52,588 --> 01:35:55,043
<i>Readily paid $3.80 to show.</i>

1043
01:35:55,632 --> 01:35:59,251
<i>The weather's threatening, but the track
is fast in Salem, New Hampshire.</i>

1044
01:36:02,222 --> 01:36:05,259
<i>Here's a late jockey change
there in the fifth at Rockingham.</i>

1045
01:36:05,518 --> 01:36:08,305
<i>R.C. Stark will ride Itsie-Bitsie.</i>

1046
01:36:10,272 --> 01:36:14,187
$5,000 on Black Mischief, across the board.
The sixth at Belmont.

1047
01:36:16,237 --> 01:36:18,810
Would you hurry up there, please?

1048
01:36:18,948 --> 01:36:22,649
<i>Wrecking Crew is 3-1, Vale of Tears, 4...</i>

1049
01:36:23,244 --> 01:36:25,996
<i>...Black Mischief, 5, Whichaway, 6...</i>

1050
01:36:26,247 --> 01:36:30,031
<i>...Chief Yeoman, 12, Peerless Pal is 20...</i>

1051
01:36:30,293 --> 01:36:32,914
<i>...and Mariato is 40.</i>

1052
01:36:33,004 --> 01:36:35,043
<i>And here we go for the sixth at Belmont.</i>

1053
01:36:35,131 --> 01:36:37,587
<i>It's five and a half furlongs.
They're at the post.</i>

1054
01:36:37,675 --> 01:36:38,920
<i>- Now.
- The flag is up.</i>

1055
01:36:39,010 --> 01:36:40,421
<i>- They're off!
- Belmont, $15,000.</i>

1056
01:36:40,512 --> 01:36:43,762
Excuse me, sir. We can't take any bets
once the race is started.

1057
01:36:43,890 --> 01:36:46,428
You can bet on another race if you care to.

1058
01:36:47,018 --> 01:36:49,770
<i>Going into the backstretch,
it's Wrecking Crew by two.</i>

1059
01:36:50,021 --> 01:36:53,971
<i>Whichaway a half, Black Mischief
and Vale of Tears riding on the outside.</i>

1060
01:36:54,067 --> 01:36:56,392
- Nothing, thank you.
- What happened?

1061
01:36:56,695 --> 01:36:58,687
I didn't get the bet down in time.

1062
01:36:59,698 --> 01:37:01,192
Jesus!

1063
01:37:03,493 --> 01:37:06,697
<i>Heading for home, it's Wrecking Crew
all alone by six lengths...</i>

1064
01:37:06,788 --> 01:37:08,745
<i>...Whichaway a length, and Vale of Tears.</i>

1065
01:37:08,832 --> 01:37:11,204
<i>It's Wrecking Crew,
Whichaway and Black Mischief.</i>

1066
01:37:11,293 --> 01:37:14,994
<i>And at the wire,
Wrecking Crew wins it by six lengths.</i>

1067
01:37:15,088 --> 01:37:16,962
<i>Black Mischief is second by a head...</i>

1068
01:37:17,049 --> 01:37:20,003
<i>...Whichaway is third,
followed by Vale of Tears.</i>

1069
01:37:21,512 --> 01:37:23,635
You should've had your money
on Wrecking Crew.

1070
01:37:23,722 --> 01:37:26,509
<i>It's raining and the track is sloppy
at Riverside Park.</i>

1071
01:37:26,767 --> 01:37:28,226
<i>There's a late scratch there.</i>

1072
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:31,726
<i>Transmutate is scratched
in the fifth at Riverside.</i>

1073
01:37:32,439 --> 01:37:34,895
<i>At Belmont, the winner, Wrecking Crew...</i>

1074
01:37:34,984 --> 01:37:37,439
<i>...paid $6, $4.20 and $2.80.</i>

1075
01:37:38,362 --> 01:37:41,233
<i>Black Mischief, $4.60 and $3.20.</i>

1076
01:37:45,786 --> 01:37:48,491
I'll have $500,000 here
by post time tomorrow.

1077
01:37:49,081 --> 01:37:51,489
Lay it on a race
where the odds are 4-1 or better.

1078
01:37:51,584 --> 01:37:54,205
- Make sure I get to the window.
- How am I gonna do that?

1079
01:37:54,295 --> 01:37:56,786
I don't know.
Figure it out for yourself, Kelly.

1080
01:38:25,035 --> 01:38:26,280
Finished?

1081
01:38:26,745 --> 01:38:29,948
Yeah. Meat loaf, apple pie
and a cup of coffee.

1082
01:38:36,838 --> 01:38:39,412
- Say, what time you get off work here?
- 2:00 a.m.

1083
01:38:39,633 --> 01:38:44,094
- Yeah? Doing anything tonight?
- Yeah. Sleeping.

1084
01:38:44,888 --> 01:38:46,169
Eighty-five.

1085
01:39:03,949 --> 01:39:06,867
- Is there a back door?
- What's wrong with the front?

1086
01:39:06,952 --> 01:39:10,203
There's a guy out there I don't need to see.
Don't look around.

1087
01:39:11,290 --> 01:39:13,615
- What does he want?
- He'd like to kill me.

1088
01:39:13,709 --> 01:39:17,458
Do me a favor. Go into the bathroom,
open the window and wait there.

1089
01:39:17,672 --> 01:39:20,341
Do what I tell you,
and everything will be jake.

1090
01:39:20,508 --> 01:39:21,587
Please.

1091
01:39:29,183 --> 01:39:30,808
Thanks. Good night.

1092
01:40:04,511 --> 01:40:06,136
It's taken.

1093
01:40:24,531 --> 01:40:26,654
Thanks. See you.

1094
01:40:31,122 --> 01:40:32,236
Shit.

1095
01:41:15,292 --> 01:41:18,246
Salino. Hey, I wasn't...

1096
01:41:42,027 --> 01:41:44,565
Hey! Got you, Hooker!

1097
01:41:45,656 --> 01:41:48,573
- Hey there, Snyder. Long time no see.
- Get going!

1098
01:42:17,063 --> 01:42:18,261
Chuck...

1099
01:42:19,857 --> 01:42:22,348
...get this to the Department right away.
- Yes, sir.

1100
01:42:39,419 --> 01:42:42,586
Hello, Hooker. Take them off.

1101
01:42:43,965 --> 01:42:45,625
Special Agent Polk, FBI.

1102
01:42:46,218 --> 01:42:47,213
Have a chair.

1103
01:42:50,806 --> 01:42:52,715
- You want a drink or something?
- No.

1104
01:42:54,601 --> 01:42:57,057
We want to talk to you
about Henry Gondorff.

1105
01:42:58,397 --> 01:42:59,855
Yeah? I don't think I know him.

1106
01:43:00,524 --> 01:43:04,023
Give yourself a couple of seconds.
You wouldn't want to lie to me.

1107
01:43:04,403 --> 01:43:07,487
Lt. Snyder says you've done
lots of confidence work in his town.

1108
01:43:07,573 --> 01:43:09,731
Oh, yeah? Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.

1109
01:43:11,368 --> 01:43:14,120
- You ain't got nothing on me.
- Yeah?

1110
01:43:15,372 --> 01:43:16,867
How about counterfeiting?

1111
01:43:20,294 --> 01:43:23,995
We've got a tip that Gondorff
is gonna run a con on the South Side here.

1112
01:43:24,882 --> 01:43:28,132
All you've got to do is tell us
when he's gonna play his chump.

1113
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:30,668
We come in at the sting,
make the pinch, and...

1114
01:43:31,097 --> 01:43:33,173
...you walk out free as a bird.

1115
01:43:34,350 --> 01:43:35,761
No.

1116
01:43:37,311 --> 01:43:41,261
You want to spend the next 20 years
in a federal penitentiary, starting tonight?

1117
01:43:42,567 --> 01:43:43,646
I'll make parole.

1118
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:47,362
Like hell. You won't even get a review.

1119
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:48,989
I'll chance it.

1120
01:43:52,285 --> 01:43:55,619
Okay. If that's the way you want it.

1121
01:43:56,331 --> 01:43:59,616
We might provide you with
a little company on your way up the river.

1122
01:43:59,709 --> 01:44:02,200
That wife of Luther Coleman's.
What was her name?

1123
01:44:03,046 --> 01:44:04,837
- Alva.
- Alva.

1124
01:44:04,923 --> 01:44:06,915
That's it. Alva Coleman.

1125
01:44:07,842 --> 01:44:10,001
Pretty fair grifter in her time.

1126
01:44:10,554 --> 01:44:12,760
Snyder's given us quite a folder on her.

1127
01:44:13,932 --> 01:44:16,553
Nothing major by itself, but...

1128
01:44:16,810 --> 01:44:19,977
...put them all together,
it could add up to a lot of years.

1129
01:44:21,565 --> 01:44:25,313
- You stink, mister.
- Don't be a sap.

1130
01:44:25,861 --> 01:44:27,438
It's not her I want.

1131
01:44:29,281 --> 01:44:33,361
If you're too dumb to save yourself, there's
no sense dragging her down with you.

1132
01:44:55,433 --> 01:44:57,141
It's over, Hooker.

1133
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:01,392
You can save me a lot of trouble.

1134
01:45:01,898 --> 01:45:05,730
But I'm gonna get Henry Gondorff
whether you help me out or not.

1135
01:45:21,167 --> 01:45:24,121
- You'll wait till the chump is played?
- Hell, yes.

1136
01:45:24,379 --> 01:45:26,585
We don't care about the mark.
He deserves it.

1137
01:45:26,673 --> 01:45:30,623
I mean completely played. You come in
before we beat him, and I'll kill him.

1138
01:45:31,428 --> 01:45:32,970
All right, Hooker.

1139
01:45:33,722 --> 01:45:37,387
But you try to take it on the lam,
and we'll shoot you down on sight.

1140
01:45:45,650 --> 01:45:48,058
As long as I get to finish the play.

1141
01:45:58,372 --> 01:46:00,661
What is it, kid? You're not saying much.

1142
01:46:00,749 --> 01:46:03,584
- Just got the jumps.
- Come in.

1143
01:46:04,253 --> 01:46:07,420
Things are a little slow.
I want to open the round for the girls.

1144
01:46:07,506 --> 01:46:08,751
Sure.

1145
01:46:13,971 --> 01:46:15,928
Take it easy.
We're not gonna lose him now.

1146
01:46:16,015 --> 01:46:18,720
We had him ten years ago
when he decided to be somebody.

1147
01:46:19,393 --> 01:46:22,180
Believe me,
I've seen enough to know. Ten.

1148
01:46:22,772 --> 01:46:24,266
- Twenty.
- Thirty.

1149
01:46:24,398 --> 01:46:26,806
- Go.
- Thirty-one.

1150
01:46:33,324 --> 01:46:36,029
How many guys you conned
in your life, Henry?

1151
01:46:36,494 --> 01:46:39,281
I don't know, 200, 300.

1152
01:46:39,622 --> 01:46:43,454
Sometimes we played two a day
when I was with O'Shea's mob.

1153
01:46:44,460 --> 01:46:46,500
Of course, Chicago was a rigged town.

1154
01:46:46,588 --> 01:46:50,372
The fix was in.
The dicks took their end without a beef.

1155
01:46:51,509 --> 01:46:53,881
We had it down to a business.

1156
01:46:55,472 --> 01:46:56,930
And it really stunk, kid.

1157
01:46:57,390 --> 01:47:01,009
No sense in being a grifter
if it's the same thing as being a citizen.

1158
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:06,435
I got packing to do. I'm gonna be
a hot number again after tomorrow.

1159
01:47:17,494 --> 01:47:20,744
I wouldn't ask you to do this
if it weren't for Luther.

1160
01:47:21,498 --> 01:47:25,543
Nothin's gonna make up for Luther.
Revenge is for suckers.

1161
01:47:25,878 --> 01:47:28,369
I've been grifting 30 years. I never got any.

1162
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:33,425
Then why're you doing it?

1163
01:47:34,428 --> 01:47:36,884
It seems worthwhile, doesn't it?

1164
01:47:44,063 --> 01:47:45,557
See you.

1165
01:50:05,999 --> 01:50:07,493
Looks like he missed you.

1166
01:50:07,918 --> 01:50:10,243
Yeah. This time, anyway.

1167
01:50:11,213 --> 01:50:13,289
Good night, Mrs. Hillard.

1168
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:23,881
I was wondering if you might want
to come out for a while...

1169
01:50:23,976 --> 01:50:25,767
...maybe have a drink or something.

1170
01:50:26,353 --> 01:50:28,476
You move right along, don't you?

1171
01:50:29,315 --> 01:50:31,307
Hey, I don't mean nothing by it.

1172
01:50:32,026 --> 01:50:34,433
I just don't know many regular girls, is all.

1173
01:50:35,112 --> 01:50:37,401
And you expect me
to come out just like that?

1174
01:50:37,573 --> 01:50:41,108
If I expected something,
I wouldn't still be standing here in the hall.

1175
01:50:41,202 --> 01:50:43,029
I don't even know you.

1176
01:50:44,038 --> 01:50:47,573
You know me. I'm just like you.

1177
01:50:48,626 --> 01:50:51,164
It's 2:00 a.m., and I don't know nobody.

1178
01:51:17,989 --> 01:51:20,314
Come on, Henry. Knock off.

1179
01:51:21,159 --> 01:51:23,068
You've done everything you can.

1180
01:55:54,688 --> 01:55:57,475
<i>- Yeah? Polk.
- Polk, this is Hooker.</i>

1181
01:55:57,733 --> 01:55:59,939
<i>- Ready?
- Yeah, go ahead.</i>

1182
01:56:00,485 --> 01:56:02,727
Everything's set.
There'll be a guy at the door.

1183
01:56:02,821 --> 01:56:05,028
Nobody's got heaters.
You won't have any trouble.

1184
01:56:05,115 --> 01:56:07,024
Okay. See you there.

1185
01:57:10,015 --> 01:57:13,715
She was gonna kill you, kid.
Her name's Loretta Salino.

1186
01:57:14,186 --> 01:57:17,140
Lonnegan's people set her up in the diner.
Come on.

1187
01:57:17,439 --> 01:57:19,432
Let's get out of here.

1188
01:57:20,275 --> 01:57:21,983
Come on!

1189
01:57:26,657 --> 01:57:28,281
Come on!

1190
01:57:33,914 --> 01:57:35,990
She could have killed me last night.

1191
01:57:36,583 --> 01:57:38,825
Too many people could have seen you.

1192
01:57:38,919 --> 01:57:42,335
She was a real professional.
Used to work in the Dutch Schultz mob.

1193
01:57:44,341 --> 01:57:46,168
Who are you?

1194
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:48,842
Gondorff asked me to look after you.

1195
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:04,149
We just got a tip that Gondorff's mark
is some big New York wheel.

1196
01:58:04,737 --> 01:58:07,489
As soon as we're inside,
you get him out of there fast...

1197
01:58:07,573 --> 01:58:08,949
...before the reporters show up.

1198
01:58:09,033 --> 01:58:12,034
I don't want any big shots around
to mess this up for me.

1199
01:58:12,245 --> 01:58:13,988
All right, let's go!

1200
01:59:15,267 --> 01:59:16,975
Let's go, guys!

1201
01:59:18,145 --> 01:59:19,853
The flag is up, kid.

1202
01:59:26,612 --> 01:59:28,937
- Anytime, J.J.
- I'm working on it.

1203
01:59:40,585 --> 01:59:42,494
We got one, Billie. Here we go.

1204
01:59:57,060 --> 01:59:59,468
<i>- Yeah?
- Place it on Lucky Dan...</i>

1205
01:59:59,562 --> 02:00:01,970
<i>...third race at Riverside Park.</i>

1206
02:00:21,710 --> 02:00:23,999
<i>...One minute 11 and three-fifths seconds.</i>

1207
02:00:24,296 --> 02:00:26,704
<i>They were off at 21.</i>

1208
02:00:28,008 --> 02:00:31,009
<i>Last call on the third at Riverside Park.</i>

1209
02:00:31,178 --> 02:00:32,838
<i>They're at the post.</i>

1210
02:00:33,472 --> 02:00:36,177
<i>At Havre De Grace,
the winner, Light Chatter...</i>

1211
02:00:36,642 --> 02:00:39,809
<i>...paid $5.40, $3.80...</i>

1212
02:00:40,187 --> 02:00:42,725
<i>...and $2.40. Blacksod...</i>

1213
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:45,682
$500,000 to win.

1214
02:00:46,819 --> 02:00:49,357
Lucky Dan, third race at Riverside.

1215
02:00:52,575 --> 02:00:53,689
You heard me.

1216
02:00:55,870 --> 02:00:58,740
Hold on, sir. I'll get the manager.

1217
02:00:58,956 --> 02:01:00,664
<i>...in the fourth at Belmont.</i>

1218
02:01:00,750 --> 02:01:03,419
<i>Jay Stout will ride Flying Cross.</i>

1219
02:01:05,129 --> 02:01:09,293
See that guy over there?
He just bet $500,000 on Lucky Dan.

1220
02:01:10,051 --> 02:01:12,340
<i>The winner at Rockingham Park...</i>

1221
02:01:12,679 --> 02:01:15,549
<i>...Enfin, paid $6. 10...</i>

1222
02:01:15,890 --> 02:01:18,642
<i>...$4.30 and $2.50.</i>

1223
02:01:23,648 --> 02:01:24,811
What's your problem?

1224
02:01:25,150 --> 02:01:29,017
I'm putting $500,000 on Lucky Dan
to win the third race at Riverside.

1225
02:01:29,237 --> 02:01:33,105
Can't lay that off in time.
A bet like that could break us.

1226
02:01:35,702 --> 02:01:37,861
Not only are you a cheat...

1227
02:01:38,371 --> 02:01:40,281
...you're a gutless cheat as well.

1228
02:01:45,462 --> 02:01:48,083
- What are the odds?
- 4-1.

1229
02:01:51,260 --> 02:01:52,754
Take all of it.

1230
02:02:04,064 --> 02:02:05,689
This is Arnold Rowe...

1231
02:02:05,774 --> 02:02:08,147
<i>...calling the third race at Riverside.</i>

1232
02:02:08,694 --> 02:02:11,612
<i>This is a claiming race for $1,500
for 3-year-olds and up.</i>

1233
02:02:11,947 --> 02:02:13,905
<i>It's been raining, and the track is muddy.</i>

1234
02:02:13,991 --> 02:02:17,941
<i>The flag is up and they're off and running.</i>

1235
02:02:18,329 --> 02:02:20,286
<i>Dr. Twink is going to the front...</i>

1236
02:02:20,373 --> 02:02:23,327
<i>...followed by Lucky Dan,
Ima Dreamer, Orkin...</i>

1237
02:02:23,626 --> 02:02:26,580
<i>...Josie G., Chi Chi and Little Star.</i>

1238
02:02:26,671 --> 02:02:29,458
Around the clubhouse turn,
it's Lucky Dan ahead...

1239
02:02:29,549 --> 02:02:31,874
<i>...Dr. Twink a length, Orkin a half...</i>

1240
02:02:32,009 --> 02:02:36,303
<i>...followed by Ima Dreamer,
Josie G., Chi Chi and Little Star.</i>

1241
02:02:36,597 --> 02:02:38,471
<i>Into the backstretch...</i>

1242
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:41,138
<i>...it's Lucky Dan a length, Dr. Twink a half...</i>

1243
02:02:41,227 --> 02:02:43,765
<i>...Orkin a head, Ima Dreamer by one.</i>

1244
02:02:44,147 --> 02:02:46,768
Sorry, I couldn't wait.
Everything going all right?

1245
02:02:47,650 --> 02:02:49,643
You got nothing to worry about.

1246
02:02:51,029 --> 02:02:53,152
I put it all on Lucky Dan.

1247
02:02:53,657 --> 02:02:55,815
$500,000 to win.

1248
02:02:57,160 --> 02:02:58,026
To win?

1249
02:03:00,580 --> 02:03:03,415
I said place! Place it on Lucky...

1250
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:05,576
That horse is gonna run second!

1251
02:03:05,669 --> 02:03:09,797
<i>Ima Dreamer a half, Dr. Twink a half
and Orkin by two, followed by Little Star.</i>

1252
02:03:11,133 --> 02:03:12,757
<i>It's a driving finish!</i>

1253
02:03:12,843 --> 02:03:15,416
There's been a mistake.
Give me my money back!

1254
02:03:15,512 --> 02:03:18,679
I tell you there's been a mistake!
Give me my goddamn money back!

1255
02:03:19,224 --> 02:03:21,798
All right, FBI! Don't anybody try to leave.

1256
02:03:21,894 --> 02:03:25,429
Stand on your feet, put your hands
over your head and move nice and slow.

1257
02:03:25,856 --> 02:03:27,054
Snyder!

1258
02:03:28,609 --> 02:03:32,393
Get them up against the wall.
Make sure they're not carrying anything.

1259
02:03:36,158 --> 02:03:38,910
Hello, Henry. It's been a long time.

1260
02:03:39,995 --> 02:03:41,454
But it's over.

1261
02:03:42,331 --> 02:03:44,075
Okay, kid, you can go.

1262
02:03:46,210 --> 02:03:48,748
All right, I said hands up. Keep them up!

1263
02:03:49,255 --> 02:03:52,422
Come on. Move them back! Put them up!

1264
02:04:12,028 --> 02:04:14,780
Get him out. Get him out!

1265
02:04:15,907 --> 02:04:18,398
Come on! Got to get you out of here!

1266
02:04:28,879 --> 02:04:31,120
- Come on!
- But my money's in there!

1267
02:04:31,423 --> 02:04:33,914
There's some dead guys too.
You can't get mixed up.

1268
02:04:34,009 --> 02:04:36,844
You don't understand.
There's $500,000 in there!

1269
02:04:48,023 --> 02:04:49,304
He's gone.

1270
02:04:55,823 --> 02:04:57,732
Okay, Henry, all clear.

1271
02:05:16,969 --> 02:05:19,295
Can you believe it? We pulled it off.

1272
02:05:19,514 --> 02:05:23,428
It's a nice con, Hickey. I thought you were
the feds myself when you came in.

1273
02:05:23,768 --> 02:05:26,639
No trouble, Henry.
Snyder went for it all the way.

1274
02:05:26,729 --> 02:05:30,063
You should've seen the rag
he lit under Lonnegan!

1275
02:05:35,488 --> 02:05:37,481
Well, kid, you beat him.

1276
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:41,572
You're right, Henry. It's not enough.

1277
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:46,748
But it's close.

1278
02:05:50,003 --> 02:05:53,039
Okay, guys, let's take this place apart fast.

1279
02:05:53,173 --> 02:05:56,293
You can pick up your splits from Eddie
at Boudreau's tonight.

1280
02:06:01,390 --> 02:06:03,181
Nice going, J.J.

1281
02:06:05,978 --> 02:06:07,306
Oh, Henry!

1282
02:06:24,413 --> 02:06:26,821
You're not gonna stick around
for your share?

1283
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,957
Nah. I'd only blow it.
