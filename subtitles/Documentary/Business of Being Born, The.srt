1
00:01:53,637 --> 00:01:55,753
The dream is always the same.

2
00:01:56,677 --> 00:01:59,555
Instead of going home,
I go to the neighbors'.

3
00:02:09,158 --> 00:02:10,910
I ring, but nobody answers.

4
00:02:12,118 --> 00:02:14,234
The door is open, so I go inside.

5
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:19,992
I look around,
but no one seems to be there.

6
00:02:28,758 --> 00:02:30,874
Then I hear the shower running.

7
00:02:31,638 --> 00:02:34,106
So, I go upstairs to see what's what.

8
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,713
Then I see her.

9
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:58,592
This... girl!

10
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,437
This incredible girl!

11
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:05,749
I don't know why she's there
because she doesn't live there...

12
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:08,589
...but it's a dream, so I go with it.

13
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,038
"Who's there?" she says.

14
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,068
"Joel," I say.

15
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,592
"What are you doing here?"

16
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,954
"I don't know.

17
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,472
"What are you doing here?"

18
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,436
"I'm taking a shower," she says.

19
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,192
Then I give her...

20
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,438
..."Do you want me to go?"

21
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,959
"No," she says.

22
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,917
"I want you to wash my back."

23
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,188
I'm getting enthusiastic about this dream.

24
00:03:40,441 --> 00:03:43,877
So, I go to her, but she's hard
to find through all the steam.

25
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:46,033
I keep losing her.

26
00:03:57,441 --> 00:03:59,318
Finally, I get to the door...

27
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:07,553
...and I find myself in a room full
of kids taking their College Boards.

28
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:11,353
I'm over three hours late!

29
00:04:11,562 --> 00:04:14,360
I've got two minutes
to take the whole test.

30
00:04:18,122 --> 00:04:20,192
I've just made a terrible mistake.

31
00:04:21,482 --> 00:04:23,438
I'll never get to college.

32
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:25,081
My life is ruined.

33
00:04:28,922 --> 00:04:32,756
Here's the game: Five-card draw
with a spit. Anaconda, high-low.

34
00:04:34,602 --> 00:04:37,070
Pass two to the right, one to the left...

35
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,551
What happened?

36
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:45,672
Last night?

37
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:47,761
That's right, with Kessler.

38
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:51,481
She was babysitting down the street.

39
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:52,757
We know that!

40
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:54,756
So, I went over there.

41
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,960
She was giving the kid a bath
and accidentally hit the shower thing.

42
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:02,432
All of her clothes were drying upstairs.

43
00:05:05,963 --> 00:05:08,431
So, she plops down on the kitchen floor...

44
00:05:10,684 --> 00:05:12,754
...she looks up at me and says...

45
00:05:13,444 --> 00:05:15,321
..."I think I'm in the mood."

46
00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:16,832
She said that?

47
00:05:18,604 --> 00:05:19,923
What did you say?

48
00:05:21,324 --> 00:05:23,155
I didn't have to say anything.

49
00:05:23,244 --> 00:05:24,518
What did you do?

50
00:05:25,884 --> 00:05:27,522
What do you think I did?

51
00:05:28,044 --> 00:05:31,514
I think you got the hell out of there,
ran home and whacked off!

52
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:36,323
I disagree.

53
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:39,396
Did you have your bike there?

54
00:05:41,005 --> 00:05:44,395
I think you jumped on your bike,
pedaled home and whacked off!

55
00:05:47,245 --> 00:05:49,156
That's what you think, right?

56
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:52,955
With Kessler sitting on the floor like that,
wanting me?

57
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:00,564
No guts, Goodson.

58
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:03,644
The problem was I just wasn't attracted
to her.

59
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:05,044
That should never stop you.

60
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,478
She seemed too big.

61
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:08,203
It could've worked out.

62
00:06:08,686 --> 00:06:10,438
I thought I'd get into trouble.

63
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:14,041
Sometimes you have to say,
"What the fuck!" Make your move!

64
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:17,958
That's easy for you to say.

65
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:22,279
You're all set.
You're probably going to Harvard.

66
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:26,802
Me, I don't want to make a mistake,
jeopardize my future!

67
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:30,962
Joel, let me tell you something.

68
00:06:33,806 --> 00:06:36,525
Every now and then, say, "What the fuck."

69
00:06:38,527 --> 00:06:40,597
"What the fuck," gives you freedom.

70
00:06:41,727 --> 00:06:43,638
Freedom brings opportunity.

71
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,883
Opportunity makes your future.

72
00:06:50,407 --> 00:06:51,840
Be right there.

73
00:06:57,727 --> 00:06:59,957
So, your folks are going out of town?

74
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,876
Tomorrow.

75
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:06,482
You've got the place all to yourself?

76
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:10,044
Yeah?

77
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:12,327
"What the fuck."

78
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:19,925
If you can't say it...

79
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:21,601
...you can't do it.

80
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:33,717
Joel, did you get your SAT scores?

81
00:07:36,808 --> 00:07:38,036
How did you do?

82
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,567
597: Math, 560: Verbal.

83
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:45,478
If you wanted to,
you could take them again?

84
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:46,968
- I guess so.
- Great.

85
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:49,239
Joel, I want to show you something.

86
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,402
Honey, did you pack my Mace?

87
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:53,207
Yes, in your cosmetic case.

88
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:00,639
Joel, do you hear something odd?

89
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:02,328
Something unpleasant?

90
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,245
No.

91
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:06,364
A preponderance of bass, perhaps?

92
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:08,806
No.

93
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,480
Is this the way I left the equalizer?

94
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,726
No.

95
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,604
This is not a toy for you and your friends.

96
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:22,047
If you can't use it properly,
you're not to use it at all.

97
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,282
My house, my rules.

98
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,400
Joel, I spoke to Bill Rutherford.

99
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,482
He interviews for Princeton.

100
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,083
I'll never get into Princeton!

101
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,002
I already arranged an interview.

102
00:08:39,091 --> 00:08:41,321
Friday night, the 4th, at our house.

103
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:42,925
Jesus, Dad!

104
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:46,928
Tell him about your involvement
with Future Enterprisers.

105
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:48,444
They like that.

106
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:53,320
There's $50 for food,
which is more than enough...

107
00:08:53,411 --> 00:08:56,528
...another $50 for emergencies
and an extra $25 just in case.

108
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:59,489
Don't forget to water the plants
on the patio.

109
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:01,967
I made a list, it's on the refrigerator door.

110
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:03,609
Dad, should I start your car?

111
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:04,840
The car will be fine, Joel.

112
00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:06,046
For the battery, I mean.

113
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:08,885
Please, you're not to use my car.
You're not insured for it.

114
00:09:08,972 --> 00:09:11,440
- Use the station wagon.
- Use my car, honey.

115
00:09:12,772 --> 00:09:14,603
Do we understand each other?

116
00:09:14,772 --> 00:09:15,648
Okay!

117
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:20,608
As far as the house is concerned,
just use your best judgment.

118
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:22,045
We trust you.

119
00:09:22,212 --> 00:09:23,611
Have a great time.

120
00:09:24,332 --> 00:09:25,287
Be good.

121
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:27,050
We will, honey. You too.

122
00:10:18,694 --> 00:10:21,413
"Just take those old records off the shelf

123
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,803
"I sit and listen to them by myself

124
00:10:26,254 --> 00:10:28,768
"Today's music ain't got the same soul

125
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:32,168
"I like that old time rock and roll!

126
00:10:33,574 --> 00:10:35,804
"Don't try to take me to a disco

127
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,814
"You'll never even get me out on the floor

128
00:10:40,935 --> 00:10:43,574
"In ten minutes I'll be late for the door

129
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,809
"I like that old time rock and roll!

130
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:50,854
"Still like that old time rock and roll!

131
00:10:52,215 --> 00:10:54,775
"That kind of music just soothes the soul

132
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:58,090
"I reminisce about the days of old

133
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:01,804
"With that old time rock and roll!"

134
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:25,451
Guess what?

135
00:11:25,536 --> 00:11:27,174
Dalby got into Harvard.

136
00:11:28,536 --> 00:11:30,128
He must have aced his Boards.

137
00:11:30,216 --> 00:11:31,365
780: Verbal.

138
00:11:31,736 --> 00:11:33,010
765: Math!

139
00:11:33,336 --> 00:11:34,212
Shit!

140
00:11:34,296 --> 00:11:36,856
Do you know what a Harvard MBA makes,
first year?

141
00:11:36,936 --> 00:11:37,891
$40,000.

142
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:41,527
My cousin went into dermatology.
First year, over $60,000!

143
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:43,535
Just for squeezing zits?

144
00:11:44,297 --> 00:11:47,255
Why don't you try it, Barry?
You have the experience.

145
00:11:48,697 --> 00:11:50,289
Thank you, you're very kind.

146
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,890
Listen, you guys.

147
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:54,606
Doesn't anyone want
to accomplish anything?

148
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:56,767
Or do we just want to make money?

149
00:11:57,497 --> 00:11:58,566
Make money.

150
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:00,336
Just make money.

151
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:02,250
Make a lot of money.

152
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:04,096
What about you, Joel?

153
00:12:06,297 --> 00:12:08,174
Serve my fellow mankind.

154
00:12:14,378 --> 00:12:15,697
Profit motive.

155
00:12:17,658 --> 00:12:18,932
Competition.

156
00:12:20,378 --> 00:12:21,652
Free enterprise.

157
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:25,815
Is there any company
that doesn't have a product in production?

158
00:12:25,898 --> 00:12:27,411
We're falling far behind.

159
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:28,851
You haven't exactly been helping.

160
00:12:28,938 --> 00:12:30,371
You wanted to be
the production executive.

161
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,848
Bullshit! Every sales manager I know
helps with production.

162
00:12:33,978 --> 00:12:34,933
Yeah? Who?

163
00:12:35,018 --> 00:12:36,849
Everyone! Just help me
with the production!

164
00:12:36,938 --> 00:12:39,248
I can't! I'm too busy
with marketing and sales!

165
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:41,057
How can you be busy
with marketing and sales?

166
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:43,289
I haven't given you the product yet!

167
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:45,888
Barry, just bring the goddamn thing
over tonight.

168
00:12:45,979 --> 00:12:49,369
I only did this because I thought
it'd look good on my record.

169
00:12:55,419 --> 00:12:56,977
Hi, Glenn. What's up?

170
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:59,454
- I heard your parents were away.
- Yeah.

171
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,294
I thought maybe I could borrow a room?

172
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:07,170
Barry is here and we're working.

173
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:08,852
We won't bother you.

174
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,852
We don't have anywhere to go.

175
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,339
You know how it is.

176
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,698
Sure. Take my room.

177
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,289
Thanks, Joel.

178
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,775
Ready?

179
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,693
The "Memo-Minder"!

180
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,696
Here's how it works.

181
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,853
A call comes in for your mom,
it's fairly important. What do you do?

182
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,172
You write the message down here,
hit the switch... you've got the light.

183
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:41,930
Now, a call for your dad comes in
and it's really important!

184
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,009
You're gonna get your ass kicked in
if he misses it.

185
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:46,295
So, what do you do?

186
00:13:46,381 --> 00:13:49,179
Write the message down there,
hit position two...

187
00:13:52,141 --> 00:13:55,372
$1.86 in parts, sell it for $9.95
and make a fortune!

188
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,894
I can't concentrate with this.

189
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:05,573
This is really annoying.

190
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:08,581
It's ridiculous!

191
00:14:11,742 --> 00:14:13,061
I'm out of here.

192
00:14:20,462 --> 00:14:22,692
Lock the door when you leave, Glenn.

193
00:14:26,222 --> 00:14:28,053
If you read me, grunt twice!

194
00:14:32,302 --> 00:14:33,257
Thank you!

195
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:10,944
I can't believe Glenn bringing
Statwiler over like that.

196
00:15:11,024 --> 00:15:11,820
Why?

197
00:15:11,984 --> 00:15:14,498
Because he boffed Hendricks last week!

198
00:15:14,864 --> 00:15:15,740
He did?

199
00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:18,736
Yes! And after the game on Saturday,
he fucked her.

200
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:21,143
- Barry?
- What?

201
00:15:21,424 --> 00:15:23,699
Boffing and fucking are the same thing.

202
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:25,739
They are?

203
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:29,655
Yes. What did you think it was?

204
00:15:29,904 --> 00:15:31,895
I thought it was something else.

205
00:15:32,144 --> 00:15:33,577
You're sure on this?

206
00:15:34,864 --> 00:15:36,058
I'm positive.

207
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:40,340
Shit!

208
00:15:50,705 --> 00:15:52,024
Sublime breasts.

209
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,819
They're what kind of breasts?

210
00:15:53,905 --> 00:15:55,418
Sublime breasts!

211
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:01,495
A couple of boys in daddy's car.

212
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:03,578
Do you want to race?

213
00:16:09,826 --> 00:16:10,781
Hit it.

214
00:16:31,986 --> 00:16:33,101
Okay. Good.

215
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:37,103
You've done the old man's car bit.
That's a good start.

216
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:41,418
Now, try this on for size.

217
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:45,260
"The Leather Castle.

218
00:16:46,307 --> 00:16:49,105
"Chicago's finest dominants
and submissives.

219
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:52,900
"Fully equipped dungeons.
Beginners welcome."

220
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:56,505
It sounds great, Miles.

221
00:16:57,427 --> 00:16:58,701
Here's one!

222
00:16:58,787 --> 00:17:01,096
"My daddy used to spank my bare bottom.

223
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:05,540
"Now he's gone. Will you take his place?

224
00:17:06,307 --> 00:17:07,501
"Call Misty."

225
00:17:07,747 --> 00:17:10,706
Come on, Joel. You've got to
take advantage of this!

226
00:17:11,188 --> 00:17:12,701
They come to your house!

227
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:16,497
"Countess Angelique seeks
young submissive with large ankles!"

228
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:18,703
This is it!

229
00:17:18,868 --> 00:17:22,543
"For a good time in the privacy
of your own home, call Jackie:

230
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:24,462
"555-4875."

231
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:29,539
Succinct, to the point,
down to business. What do you say?

232
00:17:33,348 --> 00:17:35,737
If you want to call, call for yourself.

233
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:39,022
A good time, Joel!

234
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:42,059
In the privacy of your own home!

235
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:44,461
What else can you ask for?

236
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:47,819
I'll make my own calls, thank you.

237
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:49,738
Then...

238
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:51,424
...call!

239
00:17:51,749 --> 00:17:52,784
Forget it!

240
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:57,183
Forget it!

241
00:17:57,749 --> 00:17:59,023
All right!

242
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:00,624
I'm calling.

243
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:03,503
You're calling?

244
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:06,061
Someday you'll thank me for this.

245
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:07,980
You'd better not mention me.

246
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,501
It's her answering machine.

247
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,902
Hi, Jackie, this is Joel Goodson,
345 Remson, Glencoe.

248
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,263
I'd like a good time in my home tonight.
Bye!

249
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,309
That was really cute.

250
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,301
Now, give me the number
so I can call her back.

251
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,381
Number? There's no number?

252
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,661
Give me the number, damn it!

253
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,224
There's no number.

254
00:18:39,831 --> 00:18:41,230
You're an asshole!

255
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:43,742
Gotta go. Catch you later.

256
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:49,305
Shithead!

257
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:55,548
Oh, God!

258
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,308
Hello, Joel. I'm Jackie. How are you?

259
00:20:17,314 --> 00:20:19,623
Nice to meet you, Jackie. I'm not Joel.

260
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:21,670
Joel stepped out for a moment.

261
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:24,473
I'll go call him.

262
00:20:31,954 --> 00:20:32,989
Holy shit!

263
00:20:36,754 --> 00:20:38,871
Dalby, get your ass over here!

264
00:20:39,315 --> 00:20:40,907
I'm playing cards, Joel!

265
00:20:41,155 --> 00:20:42,508
Just get over here!

266
00:20:42,595 --> 00:20:43,789
Is she there?

267
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,435
Yes, she is here,
and she is waiting for you!

268
00:20:46,835 --> 00:20:49,554
She's not waiting for me,
she's waiting for you.

269
00:20:50,195 --> 00:20:51,423
Are you coming?

270
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:53,867
No! I'm playing cards!

271
00:20:55,635 --> 00:20:57,034
You're not coming?

272
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:01,034
Get over here, Dalby!

273
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,950
Look, I'm sorry about
the misunderstanding.

274
00:21:18,756 --> 00:21:21,224
Joel, be a courageous person.
Open the door!

275
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:23,546
That way, you see, I can call a cab.

276
00:21:24,596 --> 00:21:26,188
Again, I'm really sorry.

277
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:30,351
As long as we come to an arrangement,
I'm in no mood for complaining.

278
00:21:30,436 --> 00:21:32,996
I mean, when you put
your good money down...

279
00:21:33,076 --> 00:21:36,193
...you gotta get what you wanted
in the first place. Know what I mean?

280
00:21:36,276 --> 00:21:39,314
When you buy a TV,
you don't buy Sony if you want RCA.

281
00:21:40,837 --> 00:21:43,226
I know we could get along
real well. But, hey!

282
00:21:43,317 --> 00:21:45,592
It's your hard-earned money, right?

283
00:21:46,357 --> 00:21:49,633
This way, we make an arrangement
and everyone is satisfied.

284
00:21:49,957 --> 00:21:51,231
You had carfare.

285
00:21:51,317 --> 00:21:54,150
A long ride. I don't ever come out this far.

286
00:21:55,317 --> 00:21:56,352
And your time.

287
00:21:56,437 --> 00:21:59,554
My time, my effort,
my infinite patience and understanding.

288
00:21:59,637 --> 00:22:00,592
Thank you.

289
00:22:00,677 --> 00:22:01,632
$75.

290
00:22:03,557 --> 00:22:04,512
Fair enough.

291
00:22:04,597 --> 00:22:06,986
Joel, I'm going to give you a number.

292
00:22:07,717 --> 00:22:09,276
You ask for Lana.

293
00:22:10,158 --> 00:22:12,069
- It's what you want.
- Thank you.

294
00:22:14,198 --> 00:22:16,712
It's what every white boy
off the lake wants.

295
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:49,879
All right, Goodson,
we know you're in there!

296
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:51,554
What's that?

297
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:54,510
I think someone's out there.

298
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:02,910
Joel, the house is surrounded.

299
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,679
Do exactly as we say,
and no one gets hurt.

300
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:08,435
Oh, shit!

301
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,911
Get off the babysitter! Put on your
pants, and come out with your hands up!

302
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,711
Please, Joel, do as they say!

303
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,998
Get off the babysitter!

304
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,310
Don't throw your life away like this.

305
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,951
Listen, you goddamn punk, you'll never
have a future! Not if I can help it!

306
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,911
You got that? No future!

307
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,995
Who is that?

308
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:40,436
My father!

309
00:24:35,162 --> 00:24:36,561
Hello? Lana?

310
00:24:37,883 --> 00:24:38,679
Yes?

311
00:24:40,203 --> 00:24:40,999
Hi.

312
00:24:53,723 --> 00:24:56,112
I'm a nice guy,
and I'd like to meet you tonight.

313
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,716
Fine. Where are you?

314
00:25:00,683 --> 00:25:02,036
Where do you live?

315
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:06,918
Glencoe.

316
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,283
What's your name?

317
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:15,674
Ralph.

318
00:25:16,764 --> 00:25:18,880
Ralph, can I have the address?

319
00:25:25,244 --> 00:25:26,154
345...

320
00:25:28,164 --> 00:25:29,233
...Remson.

321
00:25:30,524 --> 00:25:31,434
Ralph?

322
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:35,763
I'll see you tonight.

323
00:27:12,248 --> 00:27:14,159
Are you ready for me, Ralph?

324
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:11,444
This is a beautiful place, Ralph.
Is it all yours?

325
00:29:12,212 --> 00:29:13,850
It's my folks', actually.

326
00:29:14,772 --> 00:29:16,683
Do you know what it's worth?

327
00:29:18,812 --> 00:29:20,006
A lot, probably.

328
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,684
Oh, yeah! Real estate?

329
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:23,240
It's fabulous!

330
00:29:24,052 --> 00:29:26,646
Look, Lana... my name really isn't Ralph.

331
00:29:30,492 --> 00:29:31,766
It's Joel.

332
00:29:33,052 --> 00:29:34,724
I need $300... Joel.

333
00:29:37,813 --> 00:29:38,882
You're kidding?

334
00:29:38,973 --> 00:29:40,486
No, I don't believe I am.

335
00:29:40,573 --> 00:29:42,165
Can I send it to you?

336
00:29:45,053 --> 00:29:46,930
Can you send it to me, Joel?

337
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:50,331
I just don't have that much here
in the house.

338
00:29:51,133 --> 00:29:52,885
How much do you have?

339
00:29:53,813 --> 00:29:55,371
- I have $50.
- $50?

340
00:29:56,653 --> 00:29:58,723
What are we going to do about this?

341
00:30:04,693 --> 00:30:06,251
I have a bond at the bank I could cash...

342
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:08,404
I'm not good at waiting for people.

343
00:30:09,814 --> 00:30:11,008
I'll be quick.

344
00:30:11,454 --> 00:30:12,728
Give it a try.

345
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:52,010
I'm back!

346
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:06,094
I'm here for you.

347
00:31:25,976 --> 00:31:28,046
How could she? It's so stupid!

348
00:31:28,376 --> 00:31:29,729
Tell your mother it broke!

349
00:31:29,816 --> 00:31:32,410
That egg is worth a lot more than $300!

350
00:31:33,336 --> 00:31:34,974
What are you going to do?

351
00:31:35,576 --> 00:31:37,772
I'm gonna get it back,
is what I'm gonna do.

352
00:31:37,857 --> 00:31:38,573
Are you going to help?

353
00:31:38,657 --> 00:31:39,772
Sure. When?

354
00:31:41,497 --> 00:31:42,532
Right now!

355
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:45,974
I can't do it right now!
I have a trig. Mid-term tomorrow!

356
00:31:46,497 --> 00:31:47,850
Hey, "Mr. What-The-Fuck"...

357
00:31:47,937 --> 00:31:50,246
...what about "exploring
the dark side" and all that?

358
00:31:50,337 --> 00:31:52,055
Or was that just bullshit?

359
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:54,414
That was just bullshit, Joel.

360
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:58,292
I'm surprised you listened to me.

361
00:32:03,777 --> 00:32:05,051
Are you coming?

362
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,887
How can you even tell if she'll be here?

363
00:32:17,058 --> 00:32:19,697
I called Jackie and she said to try here.

364
00:32:21,178 --> 00:32:24,727
Great idea. Where else could
we get a hot chocolate for $4?

365
00:32:26,938 --> 00:32:28,007
She's here!

366
00:32:29,418 --> 00:32:30,533
Where?

367
00:32:31,578 --> 00:32:33,773
The blue dress... those legs...

368
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:36,573
That's her.

369
00:32:36,698 --> 00:32:38,212
She's fantastic!

370
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:49,451
She's looking right at us!

371
00:32:58,019 --> 00:32:59,498
She knows we're here.

372
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,614
That's it?

373
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,859
That's it, Joel?

374
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,698
I can't believe we came
all the way here for that!

375
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,731
At least she knows we're on to her, Miles.

376
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,617
Yeah, she must be terrified.

377
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,735
Joel!

378
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,699
Is this your car?

379
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,530
Maybe.

380
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,098
Could we talk a minute?

381
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,576
Okay.

382
00:33:38,421 --> 00:33:39,490
Let's talk!

383
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:42,495
Okay. In the car, all right? It's freezing.

384
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:55,339
Will you do me a favor?

385
00:33:56,421 --> 00:33:58,252
You want me to do you a favor?

386
00:33:58,341 --> 00:33:59,569
I just need a lift.

387
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:01,333
Look, I want my egg back!

388
00:34:04,221 --> 00:34:05,336
Get out of the car!

389
00:34:05,421 --> 00:34:06,695
Joel, better get moving.

390
00:34:06,781 --> 00:34:08,135
I want my egg back!

391
00:34:08,222 --> 00:34:09,974
You got it, all right? Just start driving!

392
00:34:10,062 --> 00:34:10,892
When?

393
00:34:11,422 --> 00:34:12,855
- Now!
- Open the door!

394
00:34:13,582 --> 00:34:14,697
When do I get it back?

395
00:34:14,782 --> 00:34:15,931
Start driving!

396
00:34:16,022 --> 00:34:18,536
Open the door!
Are you going to open the door?

397
00:34:18,622 --> 00:34:19,737
Hey, buster!

398
00:34:20,182 --> 00:34:20,978
Fuck! Will you just...

399
00:34:21,062 --> 00:34:23,018
- Get off the car!
- Just start driving!

400
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,501
Start driving, now!

401
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:28,018
Why don't you start the car, Joel?

402
00:34:29,022 --> 00:34:30,375
Fuck! Get out of here!

403
00:34:30,462 --> 00:34:32,373
Start the goddamn car, Joel!

404
00:34:32,702 --> 00:34:34,135
Lana, open the door.

405
00:34:36,222 --> 00:34:37,941
Where are you going? Lana!

406
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:39,861
Get out, or I'll kill you!

407
00:34:50,783 --> 00:34:52,136
Who was that guy?

408
00:34:52,383 --> 00:34:53,657
My manager.

409
00:34:54,263 --> 00:34:56,333
He gets a little crazy sometimes.

410
00:34:57,743 --> 00:34:59,415
This is my friend, Miles.

411
00:35:01,663 --> 00:35:03,574
Do you like excitement, Miles?

412
00:35:03,903 --> 00:35:04,858
Love it.

413
00:35:21,864 --> 00:35:23,775
Okay, where do you want to go?

414
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,695
I don't know, Joel.
I haven't given it a lot of thought.

415
00:35:27,784 --> 00:35:28,978
Tell me this:

416
00:35:29,184 --> 00:35:31,220
Am I going in the right direction?

417
00:35:33,184 --> 00:35:34,822
Oh, shit! Here he comes!

418
00:35:35,184 --> 00:35:36,412
Here who comes?

419
00:35:37,024 --> 00:35:38,538
That manager guy?

420
00:35:42,465 --> 00:35:43,534
Hey, Guido!

421
00:35:43,945 --> 00:35:45,424
Big man, Guido!

422
00:35:46,465 --> 00:35:47,864
Big man with a gun!

423
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:49,259
What are you going to do?

424
00:35:49,345 --> 00:35:50,858
Shoot us all? Stupid!

425
00:35:55,265 --> 00:35:56,823
This guy Guido...

426
00:35:57,345 --> 00:35:59,415
...he's a "manager"?
- That's right.

427
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:01,294
Or a pimp?

428
00:36:01,505 --> 00:36:03,097
Now, that's quick, Joel.

429
00:36:03,505 --> 00:36:06,224
Have you always been this quick,
or is this something new?

430
00:36:06,305 --> 00:36:07,819
I don't believe this!

431
00:36:07,906 --> 00:36:09,464
I have a trig. Mid-term tomorrow...

432
00:36:09,546 --> 00:36:12,344
...and I'm being chased by Guido,
The Killer Pimp!

433
00:36:36,706 --> 00:36:37,617
Miles?

434
00:36:39,107 --> 00:36:40,096
I think I can take him.

435
00:36:40,187 --> 00:36:41,825
What are you talking...

436
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,659
I'm really not enjoying this.

437
00:37:32,068 --> 00:37:33,979
I think I'm going to throw up.

438
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:45,503
I think I'm going to throw up on you, Joel!

439
00:38:06,629 --> 00:38:07,904
Porsche...

440
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,782
...there is no substitute.

441
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,699
Fuck you.

442
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,907
Hi, dear. It's Mother.

443
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,258
How are you?

444
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,705
Just checking in to say hello,
see how you're doing...

445
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:26,065
...and give you our flight information.

446
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,384
Wait a minute. Let me write this down.

447
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,218
Saturday, United, Flight 162 at 3:30.

448
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:40,025
That's right. How's everything else?
Do you have enough money?

449
00:38:41,031 --> 00:38:43,909
It never seems to go as far
as you think it will.

450
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:47,104
Yes, I know.

451
00:38:47,631 --> 00:38:49,030
I'm learning, Mom.

452
00:38:50,991 --> 00:38:52,310
How is Aunt Tudi?

453
00:38:56,791 --> 00:38:57,940
I will.

454
00:38:59,151 --> 00:39:00,550
See you then, bye.

455
00:39:02,951 --> 00:39:04,225
Your folks?

456
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:06,944
So, how are they?

457
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:08,910
Oh, they're just great.

458
00:39:09,032 --> 00:39:10,465
How about Aunt Tudi?

459
00:39:10,632 --> 00:39:13,146
Her hip is much better.
She sends her love.

460
00:39:18,512 --> 00:39:20,468
You were telling me about Guido.

461
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:21,986
I quit Guido.

462
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:25,587
How come?

463
00:39:30,192 --> 00:39:31,864
He thought he owned me.

464
00:39:33,352 --> 00:39:34,580
Nobody owns me.

465
00:39:38,353 --> 00:39:41,663
The problem is, I owe him for clothes
and hospital bills.

466
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:43,585
You were in the hospital?

467
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:46,432
I had this...

468
00:39:47,313 --> 00:39:48,507
...pain in my chest.

469
00:39:48,593 --> 00:39:50,709
I thought it was a heart condition.

470
00:39:52,593 --> 00:39:53,708
What was it?

471
00:39:53,993 --> 00:39:55,631
The doctor said nerves.

472
00:39:56,073 --> 00:39:57,472
Nice service.

473
00:39:58,353 --> 00:39:59,581
Reed & Barton.

474
00:40:02,353 --> 00:40:04,742
Thank you for breakfast. It was good.

475
00:40:06,993 --> 00:40:08,632
I'm going to school now.

476
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:15,831
I'll have to ask you to leave.

477
00:40:19,394 --> 00:40:20,463
I'm sorry.

478
00:40:21,554 --> 00:40:23,067
You won't let me stay?

479
00:40:24,274 --> 00:40:26,185
No, I have to go to school.

480
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:32,072
I'm really sorry.

481
00:40:36,274 --> 00:40:37,469
No, I'm sorry.

482
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:44,274
I'll be right back.

483
00:40:47,555 --> 00:40:49,386
You guys go ahead without me.

484
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:51,303
She's still here?

485
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:52,714
She won't leave.

486
00:40:56,195 --> 00:40:57,514
She won't leave.

487
00:41:02,755 --> 00:41:04,188
Lana, look...

488
00:41:05,235 --> 00:41:07,989
...I just want my egg back.
I want my house back.

489
00:41:09,076 --> 00:41:10,794
I have a lot of work to do.

490
00:41:12,996 --> 00:41:15,112
Did you have a good time last night?

491
00:41:18,516 --> 00:41:20,666
You mean when we got back here?

492
00:41:21,636 --> 00:41:23,467
I think you know what I mean.

493
00:41:29,716 --> 00:41:31,354
I had a great time.

494
00:41:34,596 --> 00:41:36,985
Don't tell me I owe you another $300.

495
00:41:39,037 --> 00:41:40,948
Did I say you owe me anything?

496
00:41:43,477 --> 00:41:44,114
No, you didn't.

497
00:41:44,197 --> 00:41:46,916
I don't remember saying
you owe me anything.

498
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:54,508
What about my mother's egg?

499
00:41:55,237 --> 00:41:58,434
You're the one who's going to college,
you figure it out.

500
00:42:02,557 --> 00:42:04,195
How much time do you need?

501
00:42:04,277 --> 00:42:06,871
I need long enough
to make a few phone calls.

502
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,718
I have to figure out how
to get my stuff back.

503
00:42:09,798 --> 00:42:12,949
Guido has probably locked me
out of the apartment by now.

504
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:14,387
All right!

505
00:42:16,198 --> 00:42:17,950
But will you do me a favor?

506
00:42:18,438 --> 00:42:19,757
Anything, cookie.

507
00:42:21,758 --> 00:42:23,396
Don't steal anything!

508
00:42:26,078 --> 00:42:28,831
If I come back here,
and find anything missing...

509
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:32,870
...l'm going straight to the police.
I'm not joking!

510
00:42:33,798 --> 00:42:36,187
Joel, go to school. Go learn something.

511
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:52,430
May I see your pass, please!

512
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:57,396
I'm sure you've all read
chapters six through eight...

513
00:42:57,799 --> 00:43:00,188
...so here's a little pop quiz to confirm it.

514
00:43:00,279 --> 00:43:02,839
Will you put your books on the floor,
please?

515
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,988
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

516
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,399
No. Glenn knows.

517
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,069
What about Barry?

518
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,388
He knows, too.

519
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,238
Don't tell anyone!

520
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,033
I won't! I won't!

521
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:46,598
Lab reports should be on my desk
by tomorrow afternoon.

522
00:43:47,561 --> 00:43:49,756
I won't accept any that aren't typed.

523
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:06,671
Term papers are due on Friday.

524
00:44:06,761 --> 00:44:09,322
They count for 50%
of this semester's grades.

525
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,437
Damn it!

526
00:44:21,802 --> 00:44:22,917
Hey, Miles, what's going on?

527
00:44:23,002 --> 00:44:24,515
I'm waiting for Glenn.

528
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:25,990
Glenn? Where is he?

529
00:44:26,082 --> 00:44:27,037
Inside.

530
00:44:27,802 --> 00:44:28,996
In the house?

531
00:44:29,082 --> 00:44:30,595
He wanted to meet her!

532
00:44:32,802 --> 00:44:33,791
What are you doing?

533
00:44:33,882 --> 00:44:34,837
I was inside.

534
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,196
I can see that.

535
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,596
You're home now.

536
00:44:41,003 --> 00:44:42,834
Yeah, I live here, remember?

537
00:44:45,563 --> 00:44:46,473
Glenn?

538
00:44:49,883 --> 00:44:52,033
Tell me you didn't do anything with her.

539
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:53,158
Who, Lana?

540
00:44:53,723 --> 00:44:54,792
Yeah, Lana.

541
00:44:55,003 --> 00:44:55,992
Nothing.

542
00:44:56,083 --> 00:44:57,357
I met her.

543
00:44:57,683 --> 00:44:58,752
She's nice.

544
00:44:59,323 --> 00:45:01,393
You're sure you didn't do anything?

545
00:45:01,803 --> 00:45:03,077
Yeah, I swear.

546
00:45:03,523 --> 00:45:05,798
You did it with her, didn't you, Glenn?

547
00:45:06,123 --> 00:45:08,354
I did not do it with her, Joel!

548
00:45:15,164 --> 00:45:16,563
Ask me about Vicki!

549
00:45:18,084 --> 00:45:19,153
Who is Vicki?

550
00:45:19,244 --> 00:45:20,518
Owe you one!

551
00:45:24,364 --> 00:45:27,003
Are you Joel? Nice place you have here.

552
00:45:28,524 --> 00:45:29,639
Where's Lana?

553
00:45:29,724 --> 00:45:30,793
In the den.

554
00:45:30,884 --> 00:45:32,283
I like your friend!

555
00:45:33,884 --> 00:45:35,556
Get out! I'm not kidding!

556
00:45:35,964 --> 00:45:37,398
What's your problem?

557
00:45:39,525 --> 00:45:41,197
Just leave! Please!

558
00:45:41,965 --> 00:45:44,525
Look, we're not ripping you off or anything.

559
00:45:48,845 --> 00:45:50,039
What is this for?

560
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,639
Fifty goes to the house! You're the house!

561
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,357
I am not the house!

562
00:45:57,965 --> 00:45:59,717
Just leave! I mean it!

563
00:46:01,645 --> 00:46:02,964
He's mad, Vicki.

564
00:46:03,245 --> 00:46:04,997
Already? I just got here!

565
00:46:05,485 --> 00:46:07,158
I think he wants us to go.

566
00:46:07,566 --> 00:46:09,045
Do you want us to go?

567
00:46:12,646 --> 00:46:13,681
Thank you.

568
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:40,439
I don't want any problems.

569
00:46:40,687 --> 00:46:42,518
Do you know what
you did to me last night?

570
00:46:42,607 --> 00:46:43,801
I don't care!

571
00:46:46,447 --> 00:46:48,836
I don't want to see you
or do anything with you anymore.

572
00:46:48,927 --> 00:46:50,155
Get in the car!

573
00:47:12,768 --> 00:47:13,803
Excuse me.

574
00:47:15,328 --> 00:47:16,841
What can I do for you?

575
00:47:17,448 --> 00:47:18,563
Who are you?

576
00:47:24,648 --> 00:47:26,798
Are you the kid I chased last night?

577
00:47:28,608 --> 00:47:30,883
Is there something I can help you with?

578
00:47:31,488 --> 00:47:33,319
You shouldn't drive like that.

579
00:47:33,408 --> 00:47:35,524
People get hurt all the time.

580
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:38,407
Are you a smart kid?

581
00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:41,087
You look like a smart kid.

582
00:47:41,289 --> 00:47:42,517
I'm okay.

583
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,440
Where are the girls? Inside?

584
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:49,489
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave.

585
00:47:54,209 --> 00:47:55,847
The door is locked.

586
00:47:56,809 --> 00:47:58,640
You're starting to give me a stomachache.

587
00:47:58,729 --> 00:48:00,367
Good! I hope it hurts!

588
00:48:01,489 --> 00:48:02,842
Are you going to open the door?

589
00:48:02,929 --> 00:48:05,363
Guido, go home!
We don't need you anymore!

590
00:48:05,489 --> 00:48:06,808
Shut your mouth!

591
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:09,924
Listen, maybe we don't work
for you anymore!

592
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:12,918
Then who do you work for?

593
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:15,080
Who? If you don't work for me?

594
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:17,401
Maybe we work for Joel, now.

595
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,649
She's only kidding.

596
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:22,239
I hope so.

597
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:26,600
Joel, you look like a smart kid.

598
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:31,521
I'm going to tell you something
I'm sure you'll understand.

599
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:34,361
You're having fun now, right?

600
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,481
Right, Joel? The time of your life.

601
00:48:39,331 --> 00:48:43,449
In a sluggish economy, never, ever fuck
with another man's livelihood!

602
00:48:45,491 --> 00:48:48,085
If you're smart, like I hope you are...

603
00:48:51,251 --> 00:48:53,845
...you aren't going to make me
come back here.

604
00:49:02,131 --> 00:49:03,450
Thank you, Joel.

605
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:07,965
It's very decent of you.

606
00:49:08,052 --> 00:49:10,486
Just as long as we understand each other.

607
00:49:10,772 --> 00:49:13,650
One night, then you'll find another place
to stay.

608
00:49:13,972 --> 00:49:16,247
As soon as we get in touch with Tandy,
we'll have a place.

609
00:49:16,332 --> 00:49:18,721
- Did you try her again?
- She's still out.

610
00:49:19,172 --> 00:49:20,605
And my mother's egg?

611
00:49:21,172 --> 00:49:23,766
If I can get my stuff back, I can get the egg.

612
00:49:24,852 --> 00:49:26,126
Then you'll leave?

613
00:49:26,212 --> 00:49:27,531
Then we'll leave.

614
00:49:28,692 --> 00:49:31,525
I don't know, Lana.
He has such nice friends.

615
00:49:31,892 --> 00:49:33,484
Clean, polite, quick.

616
00:49:34,612 --> 00:49:36,489
I think there's a future here.

617
00:49:54,693 --> 00:49:56,206
What are you studying?

618
00:49:57,493 --> 00:49:59,085
It's a workshop...

619
00:49:59,813 --> 00:50:01,326
...on free enterprise.

620
00:50:07,374 --> 00:50:10,332
We make a product,
and then we try to market it.

621
00:50:13,254 --> 00:50:14,972
Do you make a lot of money?

622
00:50:15,894 --> 00:50:17,213
No. Not really.

623
00:50:20,814 --> 00:50:21,963
No, but we...

624
00:50:23,174 --> 00:50:25,563
...get to compete with other
student companies.

625
00:50:25,654 --> 00:50:27,212
Actually, it's fucked!

626
00:50:28,174 --> 00:50:29,766
I'm just kidding.

627
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:32,805
It's really quite competitive.

628
00:50:36,934 --> 00:50:38,653
Do you ever get high, Joel?

629
00:50:40,535 --> 00:50:41,968
Yeah. All the time.

630
00:50:42,695 --> 00:50:45,653
You see, Vicki and I were thinking
about getting high.

631
00:50:46,775 --> 00:50:49,494
Maybe going out
and getting some ice cream?

632
00:50:52,055 --> 00:50:53,374
You want to come?

633
00:50:58,695 --> 00:51:01,084
I could go for some ice cream right now.

634
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,364
Are you stoned?

635
00:51:14,776 --> 00:51:16,687
No. I do not believe so.

636
00:51:18,896 --> 00:51:20,773
I think you're really wasted!

637
00:51:21,656 --> 00:51:23,612
This is not wasted, Barry.

638
00:51:24,016 --> 00:51:25,893
This is definitely not wasted.

639
00:51:30,696 --> 00:51:31,606
Barry?

640
00:51:35,256 --> 00:51:37,373
- I'm a little wasted!
- I know.

641
00:51:40,617 --> 00:51:43,211
- Don't let me do anything stupid.
- Don't worry.

642
00:51:47,017 --> 00:51:48,450
Want to take a walk?

643
00:51:55,177 --> 00:51:57,088
How do you like living at home?

644
00:51:59,337 --> 00:52:00,611
It's okay.

645
00:52:00,937 --> 00:52:02,450
I'll be out next year.

646
00:52:02,697 --> 00:52:04,813
I'll bet your folks are nice.

647
00:52:05,297 --> 00:52:07,209
They're gone till Sunday?

648
00:52:07,658 --> 00:52:08,488
Yeah.

649
00:52:09,738 --> 00:52:11,615
Because, I was thinking...

650
00:52:12,058 --> 00:52:13,650
I mean, after your friend came over...

651
00:52:13,738 --> 00:52:15,376
...I couldn't believe it!

652
00:52:15,538 --> 00:52:17,608
A kid our age walks in with a $100!

653
00:52:18,858 --> 00:52:19,768
Glenn.

654
00:52:20,498 --> 00:52:22,693
Where did he get that kind of change?

655
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:24,167
I don't know.

656
00:52:25,298 --> 00:52:27,209
He said he cashed a bond.

657
00:52:28,498 --> 00:52:30,409
You people have a lot of bonds.

658
00:52:33,938 --> 00:52:35,496
So, I was thinking...

659
00:52:37,299 --> 00:52:40,735
...if we ever got our friends together,
we'd make a fortune!

660
00:52:41,739 --> 00:52:43,172
Yeah. You're right.

661
00:52:44,779 --> 00:52:46,417
Do you want to do that?

662
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:47,615
Do what?

663
00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:50,259
Get our friends together
in the next few days.

664
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:54,096
No. I don't think so.

665
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:59,018
Make some money. Be a little enterpriser.

666
00:52:59,499 --> 00:53:00,898
Future enterpriser.

667
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,331
Be whatever you want to be.

668
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,610
What if I said I'd be your girlfriend
for the next few nights?

669
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:15,575
No charge?

670
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,528
Hey, I'm not pushing you on the idea.

671
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:23,980
It's just that my mind keeps working
all the time.

672
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:27,416
Nothing I can do about it.
It keeps working and working.

673
00:53:40,381 --> 00:53:41,700
You warm enough?

674
00:53:41,901 --> 00:53:42,936
I'm okay.

675
00:53:49,141 --> 00:53:50,779
How come you left home?

676
00:53:52,781 --> 00:53:53,577
Why?

677
00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:56,380
I was just wondering.

678
00:53:59,981 --> 00:54:02,734
Because my step-father
kept coming on to me.

679
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:07,493
What else do you want to know?

680
00:54:11,502 --> 00:54:13,732
Do you have any brothers and sisters?

681
00:54:15,182 --> 00:54:16,740
I have a brother.

682
00:54:17,262 --> 00:54:18,331
What else?

683
00:54:19,502 --> 00:54:21,015
If you don't want to talk...

684
00:54:21,102 --> 00:54:22,296
No, no. Ask me anything.

685
00:54:22,382 --> 00:54:24,532
I don't think you want to talk and it's okay.

686
00:54:24,622 --> 00:54:26,692
No, I really want to talk to you.

687
00:54:29,902 --> 00:54:31,176
What does he do?

688
00:54:32,142 --> 00:54:33,461
He's in school.

689
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,934
How come you're not in school?

690
00:54:38,383 --> 00:54:39,782
I'm not my brother.

691
00:54:46,303 --> 00:54:48,692
I'm really trying to be friends with you.

692
00:54:48,783 --> 00:54:51,900
But I'd appreciate it if you'd
stop trying to judge me...

693
00:54:51,983 --> 00:54:54,861
...while you're leaning on your
daddy's $40,000 car.

694
00:54:58,903 --> 00:55:00,336
I'll see you around.

695
00:55:07,024 --> 00:55:08,616
Was it something I said?

696
00:55:15,064 --> 00:55:18,101
You locked the door!
The keys are inside the car!

697
00:55:18,904 --> 00:55:20,940
Please! Stop! Stop! Stop!

698
00:55:37,105 --> 00:55:39,016
Please stop! Please stop!

699
00:56:10,226 --> 00:56:11,500
Thank you.

700
00:56:11,706 --> 00:56:12,775
Thank you.

701
00:56:54,227 --> 00:56:56,377
All right, everyone watch your feet!

702
00:57:13,468 --> 00:57:14,662
Are you okay?

703
00:57:17,748 --> 00:57:19,386
Do you want an aspirin?

704
00:57:23,348 --> 00:57:24,940
Does your dad own a gun?

705
00:57:29,268 --> 00:57:30,986
Who's the U-boat commander?

706
00:57:44,949 --> 00:57:48,498
You're right. You are absolutely
right to respond this way.

707
00:57:49,589 --> 00:57:51,625
I did not have a doctor's appointment.

708
00:57:51,709 --> 00:57:54,177
But I will tell you exactly what happened.

709
00:57:54,709 --> 00:57:56,222
"Unexcused." You see, Nurse Bolan...

710
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:59,187
...lf you write "unexcused,"
I fail two mid-terms.

711
00:57:59,349 --> 00:58:01,738
It'll wreck my whole grade point average!

712
00:58:02,709 --> 00:58:06,338
If you'd just stop and listen to me,
I'll explain everything.

713
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:15,340
The truth is, my parents are away,
and I met this girl.

714
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:19,830
A call girl, actually.
She came to my house.

715
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:23,262
Look, you're writing again!

716
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:24,942
This is not "unexcused"!

717
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:29,859
If you will just listen to me,
then you'll understand, Nurse Bolan.

718
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,341
Why? Why won't you listen to me?

719
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:35,307
I had a doctor's appointment.

720
00:58:39,671 --> 00:58:40,706
Excuse me.

721
00:58:41,591 --> 00:58:44,344
It wasn't the girl, it was my father's car.

722
00:58:45,111 --> 00:58:46,942
I put my father's car into Lake Michigan...

723
00:58:47,031 --> 00:58:48,942
...and I had to get it fixed.

724
00:58:51,351 --> 00:58:52,864
Just give me a break.

725
00:58:57,591 --> 00:58:59,229
Let me put it this way.

726
00:58:59,511 --> 00:59:03,982
I have spent the last four years
of my life busting my butt in this shithole!

727
00:59:07,352 --> 00:59:08,387
I'm sorry.

728
00:59:08,632 --> 00:59:12,830
I don't think I can leave until I get
just a little compassion from you.

729
00:59:18,872 --> 00:59:20,100
What did he get?

730
00:59:20,192 --> 00:59:21,989
Suspension, five days.

731
00:59:23,072 --> 00:59:24,790
They kicked him out
of Future Enterprisers, too.

732
00:59:24,872 --> 00:59:26,942
Shit! They trashed his whole record!

733
00:59:27,032 --> 00:59:29,182
What's he going to do about the car?

734
00:59:32,792 --> 00:59:34,384
Are you okay, Joel?

735
00:59:36,152 --> 00:59:37,347
I'm okay.

736
00:59:47,553 --> 00:59:48,781
I need a bike.

737
00:59:49,353 --> 00:59:50,308
He needs a bike.

738
00:59:50,393 --> 00:59:52,861
- Glenn, can I borrow your bike?
- Jesus, Glenn!

739
00:59:52,953 --> 00:59:54,466
Sure. Here, use mine.

740
01:02:18,758 --> 01:02:20,988
It was great the way her mind worked:

741
01:02:21,158 --> 01:02:23,069
No guilt, no doubts, no fear.

742
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:25,550
None of my specialties.

743
01:02:29,238 --> 01:02:32,753
Just this shameless pursuit of immediate
material gratification.

744
01:02:34,038 --> 01:02:35,391
What a capitalist!

745
01:02:38,679 --> 01:02:42,513
She told me I could make more money
in one night than I'd make all year.

746
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:44,635
Enough to pay for my father's car.

747
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:47,149
She told me she'd be my girlfriend.

748
01:02:50,279 --> 01:02:52,235
She told me a lot of things.

749
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:53,752
I believed them all.

750
01:02:54,679 --> 01:02:56,874
So, she introduced me to her friends.

751
01:03:02,359 --> 01:03:04,111
"Now when I was a young boy

752
01:03:05,959 --> 01:03:07,393
"At the age of five

753
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,230
"My mother said I was going to be

754
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,998
"The greatest man alive

755
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,073
"But now I'm a man

756
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,513
"Way past twenty-one

757
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:24,031
"I want you to believe me, baby

758
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,833
"I have lots of fun

759
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,795
"I'm a man"

760
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,671
I introduced her to my friends.

761
01:03:42,121 --> 01:03:44,032
We made Barry our treasurer.

762
01:03:47,081 --> 01:03:48,514
Lana did production.

763
01:03:49,641 --> 01:03:51,518
I concentrated on sales.

764
01:03:52,601 --> 01:03:54,796
So, you took her out to dinner twice.

765
01:03:55,161 --> 01:03:56,913
What did that cost you?

766
01:03:57,321 --> 01:03:58,356
About $30.

767
01:03:58,441 --> 01:03:59,430
With tip?

768
01:03:59,641 --> 01:04:00,915
Okay, maybe $35.

769
01:04:01,401 --> 01:04:02,720
Any movies?

770
01:04:03,161 --> 01:04:04,355
Three movies.

771
01:04:04,521 --> 01:04:05,556
$20.

772
01:04:06,682 --> 01:04:07,637
Parking?

773
01:04:07,722 --> 01:04:09,201
I park on the street.

774
01:04:09,482 --> 01:04:10,312
Gas?

775
01:04:11,882 --> 01:04:13,076
Maybe $6.

776
01:04:15,322 --> 01:04:18,041
All right, Stan, you're in for roughly $60.

777
01:04:24,562 --> 01:04:25,756
What happened?

778
01:04:27,242 --> 01:04:28,880
She slept with Jacobsen.

779
01:04:32,922 --> 01:04:34,480
That's all I'm saying.

780
01:04:36,763 --> 01:04:38,640
"I can make love to you, woman

781
01:04:39,803 --> 01:04:41,395
"In five minutes' time

782
01:04:42,923 --> 01:04:44,322
"Ain't that a man?"

783
01:04:50,683 --> 01:04:52,913
Do you know what he said... afterwards?

784
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:56,753
He said the lady had knowledge.

785
01:04:57,203 --> 01:04:59,398
He was glad to get that knowledge.

786
01:04:59,723 --> 01:05:01,042
Do you know why?

787
01:05:01,403 --> 01:05:02,233
Why?

788
01:05:02,843 --> 01:05:05,721
Because college girls can smell ignorance...

789
01:05:06,684 --> 01:05:08,003
...like dog shit.

790
01:05:08,524 --> 01:05:09,957
I'll think about it.

791
01:05:10,844 --> 01:05:12,197
Where are you going to school next year?

792
01:05:12,284 --> 01:05:13,353
Wisconsin.

793
01:05:13,724 --> 01:05:14,998
Wisconsin?

794
01:05:16,364 --> 01:05:17,433
Big school.

795
01:05:36,284 --> 01:05:38,003
All I'm saying is...

796
01:05:39,325 --> 01:05:40,758
...walk like a man.

797
01:06:07,806 --> 01:06:09,922
Joel! This is a great party!

798
01:06:11,726 --> 01:06:13,444
Are you having a good time?

799
01:06:21,486 --> 01:06:23,875
Excellent idea, Joel! Really excellent.

800
01:06:30,126 --> 01:06:32,686
Some of the girls are wearing
my mother's clothing.

801
01:06:32,766 --> 01:06:33,960
What's wrong with that?

802
01:06:34,046 --> 01:06:36,082
I don't want to spend the rest
of my life in analysis.

803
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:38,283
- Just talk to them, okay?
- All right.

804
01:07:21,408 --> 01:07:22,887
Is Howie Rifkin here?

805
01:07:23,288 --> 01:07:24,641
You're on, honey.

806
01:07:46,649 --> 01:07:49,209
Joel! Somebody is at the front door
for you.

807
01:07:49,529 --> 01:07:52,043
All right, thank you. I'll be right there.

808
01:07:53,089 --> 01:07:54,568
The thing is...

809
01:07:55,969 --> 01:07:57,846
...I don't have to pay for it.

810
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:01,683
I get it anyway.

811
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:09,724
I'm going to get going
or I'll miss the party.

812
01:08:14,810 --> 01:08:16,801
Whatever you want to do...

813
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:32,287
Excuse me. Can I help you?

814
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:34,039
Are you Joel?

815
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:35,486
Yes.

816
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:37,448
Bill Rutherford, Princeton Admissions.

817
01:08:37,531 --> 01:08:39,886
I believe we had an interview scheduled.

818
01:08:40,411 --> 01:08:42,288
If this is inconvenient for you...

819
01:08:42,371 --> 01:08:43,804
No, sir. It's fine.

820
01:08:53,691 --> 01:08:55,602
Is it okay if I have the room?

821
01:08:58,811 --> 01:09:01,769
Also, could you catch the phone
if anyone calls, please?

822
01:09:01,851 --> 01:09:04,809
I understand that you would like
to attend Princeton.

823
01:09:05,851 --> 01:09:07,524
Yes, sir, very much.

824
01:09:07,892 --> 01:09:09,211
Well, fine.

825
01:09:09,892 --> 01:09:12,406
Let's take a look at what we have,
shall we?

826
01:09:25,892 --> 01:09:27,371
Does this couch open?

827
01:09:28,132 --> 01:09:29,485
Lana, I'm in a meeting.

828
01:09:29,572 --> 01:09:30,891
We need the room.

829
01:09:31,612 --> 01:09:33,603
I need a few minutes, okay?

830
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:41,563
Now, you've taken your SAT's already.

831
01:09:41,893 --> 01:09:45,966
Math: 597, Verbal: 560. Correct me
if my information is inaccurate.

832
01:09:47,453 --> 01:09:50,525
Well, yes, but I was planning on taking
those again.

833
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:53,486
Fine. Now, your grade point
average is 3.14.

834
01:09:54,653 --> 01:09:56,291
You class rank: 52...

835
01:09:56,613 --> 01:09:59,923
...which places you in the 84th percentile.
Is that correct?

836
01:10:00,733 --> 01:10:03,293
Joel, this is my cousin, Ruben,
from Skokie.

837
01:10:03,613 --> 01:10:04,807
Can you get him in tonight?

838
01:10:04,893 --> 01:10:06,167
Not now, okay?

839
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:09,246
- He has to be back by 12:00.
- All right, later guys.

840
01:10:14,774 --> 01:10:15,809
Excuse me.

841
01:10:18,014 --> 01:10:19,766
And you wish to major in?

842
01:10:22,334 --> 01:10:23,369
Business.

843
01:10:24,294 --> 01:10:25,773
Business. Yes.

844
01:10:30,534 --> 01:10:32,172
I'll be out in a second.

845
01:10:36,735 --> 01:10:39,329
Fine, well, let's see what else there is.

846
01:10:39,775 --> 01:10:43,484
"Junior Varsity Tennis Team,
Recording Secretary, Spanish Club...

847
01:10:45,895 --> 01:10:48,011
"...Varsity Track Team: One year...

848
01:10:48,095 --> 01:10:50,893
"...Honorable Mention:
Cook County Science Fair...

849
01:10:52,255 --> 01:10:54,769
"...Future Enterprisers, Yearbook Staff...

850
01:10:56,615 --> 01:10:58,651
"...Student Council: Two years."

851
01:11:00,415 --> 01:11:02,883
Well, Joel, this is very respectable.

852
01:11:04,415 --> 01:11:06,805
You've done some very solid work here...

853
01:11:07,816 --> 01:11:10,205
...but it isn't quite lvy League, is it?

854
01:11:15,656 --> 01:11:17,214
You know, Bill...

855
01:11:18,656 --> 01:11:21,568
...there's one thing I've learned
in all my years.

856
01:11:22,176 --> 01:11:24,895
Sometimes you have to say,
"What the fuck."

857
01:11:25,896 --> 01:11:27,124
Make your move.

858
01:11:29,216 --> 01:11:30,615
I beg your pardon?

859
01:11:32,896 --> 01:11:34,409
So, how are we doing?

860
01:11:35,136 --> 01:11:37,173
Looks like University of Illinois!

861
01:11:37,377 --> 01:11:39,129
"All right, all right!

862
01:11:39,817 --> 01:11:41,853
"Dance, Music, Sex, Romance!

863
01:11:42,657 --> 01:11:44,887
"Everybody say, Oooh, all right!

864
01:11:47,937 --> 01:11:49,973
"Dance, Music, Sex, Romance!

865
01:11:54,017 --> 01:11:56,247
"Everybody clap your hands now!"

866
01:12:18,378 --> 01:12:20,812
Some of your friends are looking for you.

867
01:12:23,498 --> 01:12:25,534
What do you want me to tell them?

868
01:12:28,778 --> 01:12:30,973
Has that guy from Princeton left yet?

869
01:12:31,178 --> 01:12:34,090
No, he's still here.
He's talking to some of the girls.

870
01:12:34,178 --> 01:12:35,133
Talking?

871
01:12:35,778 --> 01:12:37,497
They're very good talkers.

872
01:12:40,419 --> 01:12:43,491
I don't think I'm going to say,
"What the fuck" anymore.

873
01:12:44,419 --> 01:12:46,887
This thing has gotten way out of control.

874
01:12:49,579 --> 01:12:51,217
I'm going to kill Miles.

875
01:12:51,939 --> 01:12:53,372
Oh, come on, Joel.

876
01:12:55,979 --> 01:12:58,971
Look at it this way.
You're making a lot of money.

877
01:12:59,619 --> 01:13:02,213
You're providing your friends
with an invaluable service.

878
01:13:02,299 --> 01:13:04,369
God knows, they needed the service!

879
01:13:05,419 --> 01:13:08,810
And, right now, you are one hot-shit
future enterpriser.

880
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:15,854
Don't worry so much. I'll be upstairs.

881
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:21,849
And... you have a girlfriend to boot.

882
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:23,816
Do I?

883
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,538
Phone call for Joel.

884
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:27,093
Here, I'll get it.

885
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:29,049
Well, do I?

886
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:32,773
What do you think?

887
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:34,978
I don't know. You tell me.

888
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:36,614
Yes? No? Maybe?

889
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:39,657
Yes.

890
01:13:42,301 --> 01:13:43,097
No.

891
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:47,291
Maybe.

892
01:13:51,901 --> 01:13:52,777
Joel!

893
01:13:53,981 --> 01:13:54,811
Dad?

894
01:13:54,941 --> 01:13:56,613
Who answered the phone?

895
01:13:56,701 --> 01:13:58,134
Just a friend, Dad.

896
01:13:58,301 --> 01:13:59,336
Do I know her?

897
01:13:59,421 --> 01:14:01,093
Have you ever made love on a real train?

898
01:14:01,181 --> 01:14:02,500
I don't think so.

899
01:14:02,941 --> 01:14:04,260
He's got a girl.

900
01:14:04,861 --> 01:14:06,818
Let's make love on a real train.

901
01:14:07,582 --> 01:14:08,617
Joel, are you there?

902
01:14:08,702 --> 01:14:12,217
I'm still here, Dad. How is Mom?
Is everything all right?

903
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:14,137
Let's go.

904
01:14:14,222 --> 01:14:15,860
Did I hear others there?

905
01:14:17,182 --> 01:14:18,820
Just a few friends, Dad.

906
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:23,975
Sounds like a party.

907
01:14:25,022 --> 01:14:25,977
A party?

908
01:14:26,622 --> 01:14:28,453
Come on, let's be alone together.

909
01:14:28,542 --> 01:14:31,500
I don't remember giving
permission for a party, Joel.

910
01:14:33,742 --> 01:14:35,573
Honey, can you hear me?

911
01:14:36,303 --> 01:14:38,533
There's nothing wrong
with having friends over.

912
01:14:38,623 --> 01:14:41,183
Just use your best judgment.
We trust you.

913
01:14:41,903 --> 01:14:44,781
We're coming in on United,
Flight 162 at 3:30.

914
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:46,057
"Trust."

915
01:14:46,703 --> 01:14:49,263
Seems to me if there were any logic
to our language...

916
01:14:49,343 --> 01:14:51,618
..."trust" would be a four-letter word.

917
01:14:53,503 --> 01:14:56,540
The evening worked out well.
We had a good cash flow.

918
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:59,733
Rutherford made a few new friends.

919
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:02,819
He said he'd do his best for me.

920
01:15:10,144 --> 01:15:12,214
Finally, it was time to close shop.

921
01:15:13,504 --> 01:15:15,176
The girls were exhausted.

922
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:18,463
Lana was hungry.
She wanted to go out for a bite.

923
01:15:19,584 --> 01:15:21,973
She wanted to make love on a real train.

924
01:15:23,024 --> 01:15:24,457
Who was I to say no?

925
01:15:26,464 --> 01:15:29,103
"I can feel it coming in the air tonight

926
01:15:36,385 --> 01:15:39,695
"And I've been waiting for this moment
for all my life

927
01:15:45,825 --> 01:15:47,736
"Can you feel it coming"

928
01:15:48,065 --> 01:15:50,295
I thought no one was going to be here.

929
01:15:52,385 --> 01:15:53,500
Be patient.

930
01:16:04,225 --> 01:16:05,817
"Well, I remember

931
01:16:07,026 --> 01:16:08,937
"I remember - don't worry

932
01:16:11,026 --> 01:16:12,937
"How could I ever forget?

933
01:16:14,146 --> 01:16:15,579
"It's the first time

934
01:16:17,106 --> 01:16:19,062
"The last time we ever met

935
01:16:23,506 --> 01:16:25,303
"But I know the reason

936
01:16:26,306 --> 01:16:28,342
"Why you keep the silence up

937
01:16:30,466 --> 01:16:32,263
"No, you don't fool me

938
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:35,258
"The hurt doesn't show

939
01:16:35,986 --> 01:16:37,898
"But the pain still grows

940
01:16:38,547 --> 01:16:40,697
"It's no stranger to you or me

941
01:16:44,067 --> 01:16:46,706
"I can feel it coming in the air tonight

942
01:16:53,907 --> 01:16:57,297
"Well, I've been waiting
for this moment for all my life

943
01:17:03,667 --> 01:17:05,976
"I can feel it in the air tonight"

944
01:20:47,355 --> 01:20:48,151
Hi.

945
01:20:48,315 --> 01:20:50,146
They stole the goddamn house, Lana!

946
01:20:50,235 --> 01:20:51,827
I'm not here right now.

947
01:20:51,915 --> 01:20:53,871
But if you'll leave your name and number...

948
01:20:53,955 --> 01:20:56,423
...I'll call you back as soon as possible.

949
01:20:57,195 --> 01:20:58,913
They took everything!

950
01:20:59,075 --> 01:21:00,144
This is unbelievable!

951
01:21:00,235 --> 01:21:03,671
My parents will be home in two hours,
Lana, and they took fucking everything!

952
01:21:03,755 --> 01:21:05,905
I don't know if you know
anything about this...

953
01:21:05,996 --> 01:21:07,668
...but you have to call me right away!

954
01:21:07,756 --> 01:21:09,587
I'm at the house: KL5-2121.

955
01:21:09,836 --> 01:21:11,906
Look, you've really got to help me!

956
01:21:12,716 --> 01:21:14,547
Time of your life, huh, kid?

957
01:21:15,116 --> 01:21:16,310
Where's Lana?

958
01:21:16,396 --> 01:21:17,909
Maybe she's on the choo-choo.

959
01:21:17,996 --> 01:21:20,510
I hear she's got this thing
about choo-choos.

960
01:21:20,796 --> 01:21:22,707
I want to know who took my stuff.

961
01:21:22,796 --> 01:21:25,310
I took your stuff, Joel, are you kidding?

962
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:27,907
Then you listen to me, buster!

963
01:21:27,996 --> 01:21:29,065
You a-hole!

964
01:21:29,356 --> 01:21:31,267
If I don't get my stuff back...

965
01:21:31,676 --> 01:21:32,506
Shit!

966
01:21:41,917 --> 01:21:42,952
"A-hole?"

967
01:21:43,757 --> 01:21:45,907
I want my furniture back, right now!

968
01:21:46,797 --> 01:21:47,991
Now, you listen to me.

969
01:21:48,077 --> 01:21:49,988
No, no! You listen to me!

970
01:21:51,357 --> 01:21:52,187
Shit!

971
01:21:58,637 --> 01:22:00,275
This is getting boring.

972
01:22:00,397 --> 01:22:02,911
Can I have my furniture back? Please?

973
01:22:04,077 --> 01:22:06,114
You listen to me, you little fuck!

974
01:22:07,438 --> 01:22:09,713
You not only took my two best girls...

975
01:22:10,078 --> 01:22:12,308
...you call me names and insult me!

976
01:22:13,598 --> 01:22:14,553
I'm sorry.

977
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:16,469
If I had any self-respect...

978
01:22:16,558 --> 01:22:18,708
...it wouldn't just be the furniture...

979
01:22:18,798 --> 01:22:21,631
...it would be your legs! Your arms!
Your head!

980
01:22:24,238 --> 01:22:25,751
Do we understand each other?

981
01:22:25,838 --> 01:22:26,907
Yes, we do.

982
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:29,473
No! Do we understand each other?

983
01:22:31,358 --> 01:22:33,269
Yes, we understand each other.

984
01:22:35,838 --> 01:22:37,875
Well, you're lucky in one respect.

985
01:22:39,119 --> 01:22:40,234
What's that?

986
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:42,998
I like you, Joel.

987
01:22:44,879 --> 01:22:46,312
Don't you know that?

988
01:22:55,599 --> 01:22:56,918
What time is it?

989
01:22:57,519 --> 01:22:58,588
It's 4:15.

990
01:22:59,759 --> 01:23:00,953
I'll find a cab.

991
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:02,870
Something must have happened.

992
01:23:04,399 --> 01:23:05,275
Taxi!

993
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:12,558
Joel, do you like music?

994
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,831
This is beautiful equipment.

995
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:17,837
What do you say, $300...

996
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:20,278
...amps, speakers, the works?

997
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:21,395
It's a bargain, Joel.

998
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:24,552
If you go downtown anywhere,
it'd cost you double that.

999
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:27,676
All right! The kid likes music!

1000
01:23:41,081 --> 01:23:43,276
How about some women's outfits?

1001
01:23:43,561 --> 01:23:45,472
You know, something for your mom?

1002
01:23:45,561 --> 01:23:46,994
Should fit her okay.

1003
01:23:47,241 --> 01:23:48,071
Yes.

1004
01:23:48,361 --> 01:23:49,237
What?

1005
01:23:49,481 --> 01:23:50,675
Yes, I'll buy it!

1006
01:23:50,761 --> 01:23:52,592
I didn't give you a price yet.

1007
01:23:52,681 --> 01:23:54,512
Can we get through this, please?

1008
01:23:54,601 --> 01:23:55,556
$125.

1009
01:24:00,521 --> 01:24:02,193
That's it, you have everything.

1010
01:24:02,281 --> 01:24:03,509
Wait a minute.

1011
01:24:06,922 --> 01:24:08,241
What about this?

1012
01:24:09,322 --> 01:24:10,516
What's that?

1013
01:24:11,082 --> 01:24:12,993
Some glass, artsy-fartsy thing.

1014
01:24:13,962 --> 01:24:16,078
What have you got left, Joel?

1015
01:24:16,202 --> 01:24:17,157
$40.

1016
01:24:18,282 --> 01:24:21,319
I don't think I can go $40
on the artsy-fartsy thing.

1017
01:24:21,882 --> 01:24:24,112
- What do you think, Vic?
- He's only got $40.

1018
01:24:24,202 --> 01:24:25,715
I only have $40.

1019
01:24:27,322 --> 01:24:28,641
We go $340?

1020
01:24:29,482 --> 01:24:31,313
I'll spot you the $300.

1021
01:24:31,642 --> 01:24:33,314
You're good for it, right?

1022
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:34,837
Certainly.

1023
01:24:34,922 --> 01:24:36,038
I think he is too.

1024
01:24:36,123 --> 01:24:36,999
Here!

1025
01:24:37,083 --> 01:24:37,993
Catch!

1026
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:50,998
To Joel!

1027
01:24:51,403 --> 01:24:54,918
Here's wishin' you good luck
on your future as a businessman!

1028
01:24:55,243 --> 01:24:58,041
Because, God knows,
you're going to need it!

1029
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:38,837
Don't, you'll break it!

1030
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:41,803
That's good. Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

1031
01:25:42,925 --> 01:25:47,157
I'd put all the Chinese things together,
and the Greek on a separate shelf.

1032
01:25:47,405 --> 01:25:49,999
I don't think you should mix centuries.

1033
01:26:05,485 --> 01:26:07,397
Mom! Dad! You're home!

1034
01:26:09,966 --> 01:26:11,240
Where were you?

1035
01:26:11,566 --> 01:26:12,681
I was here.

1036
01:26:12,846 --> 01:26:14,598
We called from the airport!

1037
01:26:15,246 --> 01:26:17,316
I must have been out back watering.

1038
01:26:17,486 --> 01:26:19,636
I thought you were coming
home tomorrow.

1039
01:26:19,726 --> 01:26:21,478
Sweetheart, I said the 5th.

1040
01:26:22,046 --> 01:26:24,196
No, you said the 6th. I wrote it down.

1041
01:26:24,286 --> 01:26:26,163
I'm sure I said the 5th.

1042
01:26:27,326 --> 01:26:28,839
Give me a hand with the luggage.

1043
01:26:28,926 --> 01:26:30,245
She said the 6th.

1044
01:26:34,046 --> 01:26:34,922
Joel?

1045
01:26:35,086 --> 01:26:36,076
Yes, Mom?

1046
01:26:37,487 --> 01:26:39,398
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1047
01:26:44,047 --> 01:26:45,685
What happened to my egg?

1048
01:26:46,047 --> 01:26:47,366
What do you mean?

1049
01:26:48,127 --> 01:26:49,640
There's a crack in it!

1050
01:26:51,647 --> 01:26:52,875
You're kidding!

1051
01:26:53,247 --> 01:26:54,965
No, Joel, I'm not kidding.

1052
01:26:55,247 --> 01:26:57,477
There's a small crack, inside the egg.

1053
01:26:57,807 --> 01:26:58,922
What's wrong?

1054
01:26:59,007 --> 01:27:00,326
My egg is ruined.

1055
01:27:00,927 --> 01:27:02,121
What happened?

1056
01:27:03,567 --> 01:27:04,761
I don't know.

1057
01:27:04,847 --> 01:27:06,076
You don't know.

1058
01:27:07,728 --> 01:27:09,764
Mom, maybe it was there before.

1059
01:27:10,048 --> 01:27:11,686
I don't think so, Joel.

1060
01:27:11,888 --> 01:27:13,765
How could you let this happen?

1061
01:27:16,688 --> 01:27:17,757
I'm sorry.

1062
01:27:17,888 --> 01:27:20,038
This is so damned irresponsible of you!

1063
01:27:20,128 --> 01:27:22,722
We'll get another one. Joel will pay for it.

1064
01:27:23,568 --> 01:27:25,126
Sure, I'll pay for it.

1065
01:27:26,288 --> 01:27:29,803
Where will you get the money
to pay for something like that?

1066
01:27:30,768 --> 01:27:32,884
I'm very disappointed in you.

1067
01:27:40,289 --> 01:27:41,563
She'll be all right.

1068
01:27:41,649 --> 01:27:43,799
Why don't you put in some yard work?

1069
01:28:41,571 --> 01:28:43,846
Do you have something to tell me?

1070
01:28:47,171 --> 01:28:48,206
No...

1071
01:28:48,971 --> 01:28:50,404
...I don't think so.

1072
01:28:51,171 --> 01:28:54,243
I just got off the telephone
with Bill Rutherford.

1073
01:28:57,011 --> 01:28:59,650
Apparently, you two had quite a meeting.

1074
01:29:04,451 --> 01:29:06,682
"Princeton can use a guy like Joel."

1075
01:29:08,692 --> 01:29:09,568
What?

1076
01:29:10,052 --> 01:29:12,441
"Princeton can use a guy like Joel."

1077
01:29:13,892 --> 01:29:15,211
His exact words!

1078
01:29:17,332 --> 01:29:18,811
That's unbelievable!

1079
01:29:18,932 --> 01:29:20,650
You're as good as in!

1080
01:29:21,012 --> 01:29:22,650
I knew you could do it!

1081
01:29:22,772 --> 01:29:25,411
Haven't I been telling you,
sometimes you have to say:

1082
01:29:25,492 --> 01:29:27,801
"What the heck!" Take some chances.

1083
01:29:27,892 --> 01:29:29,245
You were so right.

1084
01:29:29,492 --> 01:29:31,164
You've made me very proud.

1085
01:29:37,013 --> 01:29:38,605
I was just thinking...

1086
01:29:39,813 --> 01:29:42,202
...where we might be ten years from now.

1087
01:29:44,693 --> 01:29:46,490
You know what I think?

1088
01:29:46,653 --> 01:29:48,928
I think we're both going to make it big!

1089
01:29:49,013 --> 01:29:51,243
I'm very optimistic! I mean it!

1090
01:29:55,493 --> 01:29:57,131
Can I ask you something?

1091
01:30:01,813 --> 01:30:03,724
Was our night together...

1092
01:30:06,614 --> 01:30:08,332
...just to set up...

1093
01:30:09,334 --> 01:30:10,733
...Vicki and Guido?

1094
01:30:19,854 --> 01:30:20,809
No.

1095
01:30:22,454 --> 01:30:24,285
You don't believe me, do you?

1096
01:30:26,454 --> 01:30:29,332
My name is Russell Bitterman.
I'm from Wheaton High School.

1097
01:30:29,414 --> 01:30:32,850
Our product is a paper-towel
holder that sells for $8.95.

1098
01:30:33,974 --> 01:30:36,569
We made a profit of $850 last semester.

1099
01:30:43,175 --> 01:30:45,052
I don't want you to get hurt.

1100
01:30:47,255 --> 01:30:51,009
My name is Evonne Williams.
We sell decorative planters for $7.

1101
01:30:52,455 --> 01:30:55,049
We made a profit of $500 last semester.

1102
01:30:58,135 --> 01:31:00,808
Guess we won't see each other for awhile.

1103
01:31:01,335 --> 01:31:02,290
I know.

1104
01:31:04,215 --> 01:31:05,808
Are you going straight home now?

1105
01:31:05,896 --> 01:31:07,295
I don't know. Why?

1106
01:31:07,736 --> 01:31:10,808
It might be nice if we spent
the evening together.

1107
01:31:12,216 --> 01:31:13,774
I'd really like that.

1108
01:31:15,096 --> 01:31:16,973
How much have you got on you?

1109
01:31:18,616 --> 01:31:20,095
How much have I got on me?

1110
01:31:20,176 --> 01:31:21,325
I've got $20.

1111
01:31:21,976 --> 01:31:23,091
$20, Lana?

1112
01:31:24,136 --> 01:31:26,206
What are we going to do about this?

1113
01:31:26,296 --> 01:31:29,015
- Can I send it to you?
- Can you send it to me?

1114
01:31:29,856 --> 01:31:31,687
'Cause I don't have that much here.

1115
01:31:31,776 --> 01:31:33,255
How about I write you a check?

1116
01:31:33,336 --> 01:31:36,647
Do you think I'd accept a check from you?
What am I, stupid?

1117
01:31:37,817 --> 01:31:39,489
I have a bond at the bank.

1118
01:31:41,017 --> 01:31:42,609
My name is Joel Goodson.

1119
01:31:43,577 --> 01:31:45,408
I deal in human fulfillment.

1120
01:31:46,457 --> 01:31:48,846
I grossed over $8,000 in one night.

1121
01:31:50,617 --> 01:31:52,608
The time of your life, huh, kid?
