1
00:01:06,017 --> 00:01:10,558
It may be best to start recalling the origin of this word.

2
00:01:10,768 --> 00:01:12,850
In Greek, "photo" meaning light.

3
00:01:12,975 --> 00:01:16,975
And "graphein" was writing, drawing.

4
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:21,433
A photographer is literally someone drawing with light.

5
00:01:21,643 --> 00:01:26,475
Someone who writes and rewrites the world with light and shadow.

6
00:01:46,144 --> 00:01:49,101
Sierra Pelada, la pray Mine Brazil,

7
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:50,768
in front of me.

8
00:01:52,685 --> 00:01:56,559
When I reached the edge of that huge hole

9
00:01:57,686 --> 00:01:59,893
I raised the hair.

10
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:04,184
I had never seen anything like it.

11
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:09,685
There, I saw before me in a split second,

12
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:11,684
the history of mankind.

13
00:02:12,186 --> 00:02:14,685
The history of the construction of the pyramids,

14
00:02:15,062 --> 00:02:16,851
the Tower of Babel,

15
00:02:16,978 --> 00:02:18,852
King Solomon's Mines.

16
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,311
The sound of a single machine in there was no sound.

17
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:26,060
Only you could hear

18
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,770
the murmur of 50,000 people in a big hole.

19
00:02:34,103 --> 00:02:36,560
Conversations, noise, human noise

20
00:02:36,687 --> 00:02:39,602
mixed with touches manuals ...

21
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:43,603
Actually, I have traveled to the beginning of time there.

22
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:49,353
I could almost hear the murmur of gold in those souls.

23
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:05,561
We had to throw all that land.

24
00:03:05,813 --> 00:03:07,354
Not everything is gold,

25
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,562
They had to climb, get out, climb the small stairs

26
00:03:11,688 --> 00:03:13,896
then get to the big stairs,

27
00:03:14,022 --> 00:03:15,646
and come to the surface.

28
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:29,604
You're not thinking of falling.

29
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:35,981
And if you fall, there is a risk you take several.

30
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:41,772
I up several times a day

31
00:03:41,898 --> 00:03:44,231
and it never occurred to me that I might fall

32
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,688
because no one fell.

33
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:51,481
We were there to carry bags or to take pictures, in my case.

34
00:03:57,816 --> 00:04:01,564
The men went up there 50 or 60 times a day.

35
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:08,274
The only way down an inclined plane like that

36
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,898
He is running.

37
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:12,815
Si paras, te caes.

38
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:26,440
All these people together formed a very organized world.

39
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,941
But completely crazy.

40
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:45,650
They may look like slaves,

41
00:04:46,026 --> 00:04:48,191
but there was not a single slave.

42
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:52,441
If there was slavery there, it was the desire to be rich.

43
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:55,108
Everyone wanted to be rich.

44
00:04:57,068 --> 00:05:02,442
There you could find everything: intellectuals, lawyers,

45
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,484
Farm employees,

46
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,066
City workers ...

47
00:05:08,192 --> 00:05:11,610
They all came to look for an opportunity.

48
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,777
Because when we gave a gold mine,

49
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:22,985
everyone working in that part of the mine

50
00:05:23,236 --> 00:05:26,110
They had the right to choose a bag.

51
00:05:26,735 --> 00:05:29,568
And in those sacks they had chosen

52
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:31,610
slavery was hiding.

53
00:05:31,736 --> 00:05:35,818
It could be nothing or could be a kilo of gold.

54
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:40,110
At that time they played their independence.

55
00:05:42,403 --> 00:05:45,903
All men, when they begin to touch the gold,

56
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:47,653
They do not return.

57
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,653
I saw this picture for the first time in a gallery,

58
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,986
more than twenty years ago.

59
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:06,318
I did not know who had taken.

60
00:06:06,737 --> 00:06:12,069
I thought, "He must be a great photographer and an adventurer."

61
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:15,319
Behind it was a stamp and a signature.

62
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:17,778
Sebastião Salgado.

63
00:06:18,238 --> 00:06:20,320
I bought a copy.

64
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:26,404
The gallery drawer pulled more photos of the same photographer.

65
00:06:26,655 --> 00:06:29,529
What I saw moved me deeply,

66
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,112
especially this image,

67
00:06:32,363 --> 00:06:35,696
portrait of a blind woman Tuareg.

68
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:40,988
Even though tears cause I see every day,

69
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:44,280
So since then, it hangs on my desk.

70
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:49,155
I knew something of Sebastião Salgado.

71
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:51,655
Really they cared about people.

72
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:54,447
This meant a lot to me.

73
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:58,947
At the end of the day, people are the salt of the earth.

74
00:07:00,906 --> 00:07:04,281
It was a long time before we met

75
00:07:04,906 --> 00:07:08,906
and we talked about his life, his work and where it came from everything.

76
00:07:15,198 --> 00:07:19,822
The salt of the earth

77
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:48,324
We can put many photographers in one place,

78
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,323
always will draw very different pictures

79
00:07:52,408 --> 00:07:55,490
because necessarily come

80
00:07:56,491 --> 00:08:00,366
very very different sites.

81
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,033
Everyone has their way of seeing,

82
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:08,366
each according to his story.

83
00:08:10,368 --> 00:08:11,492
I think my story

84
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:17,534
It is that I learned my way to see here in this place.

85
00:08:19,117 --> 00:08:21,199
Here I have an ideal world.

86
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:26,075
Took long walks with my father,

87
00:08:26,325 --> 00:08:30,200
through this place, and we came here to watch.

88
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:36,450
Behind each of these mountains,

89
00:08:37,202 --> 00:08:39,659
there is a story, there is something to see.

90
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:49,785
Here I dreamed a lot.

91
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:54,660
He wanted to go beyond these mountains, he wanted to know.

92
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:08,035
A JOURNEY WITH Sebastiao Salgado

93
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:47,162
MOUNTAINS OF WEST PAPUA, INDONESIA, Village Yali, 2011

94
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:26,379
Sebastião was very bohemian, was always traveling.

95
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:28,892
He liked to travel as anyone.

96
00:13:28,927 --> 00:13:30,171
My father was like that.

97
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,422
It was not anywhere. It was like a shuttle.

98
00:13:36,505 --> 00:13:38,129
That was Tiao.

99
00:13:38,255 --> 00:13:40,880
I thought I was in Vitoria, and was here.

100
00:13:41,005 --> 00:13:45,504
O he was in the north, or making political propaganda.

101
00:13:46,422 --> 00:13:47,255
And as for studies,

102
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,587
if I had not had friends, he would have studied.

103
00:13:52,714 --> 00:13:57,380
Sebastião was left for studies. He gave a lot of work.

104
00:13:57,506 --> 00:13:59,547
But he studied economics.

105
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,423
I wanted to do law.

106
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,464
He studied one year, but did not like

107
00:14:06,674 --> 00:14:10,213
and he switched to economics, and did well.

108
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:15,006
This was Sebastião Salgado,

109
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:17,297
Father.

110
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,548
He bequeathed his name to his only son,

111
00:14:20,674 --> 00:14:24,756
who, though he remained all his life a restless traveler,

112
00:14:24,882 --> 00:14:29,048
He benefited from studies that his father forced him to take

113
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,048
in ways that would never have imagined.

114
00:14:33,425 --> 00:14:38,257
His studies in Economics endowed him sound knowledge

115
00:14:38,383 --> 00:14:41,673
markets, trade and industry.

116
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,756
So I knew what ruled the world.

117
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:51,425
For him, all started in Aimorés, a small town in Brazil.

118
00:14:52,301 --> 00:14:55,716
There the estate of his father stood under the big sky.

119
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:58,550
There were vast Atlantic forests.

120
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:01,966
The river then was still navigable.

121
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:06,175
But above all, endless trains were passing by

122
00:15:06,551 --> 00:15:09,801
bursting with minerals, iron ore

123
00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:12,633
going from there to the rest of the world.

124
00:15:13,176 --> 00:15:17,925
At the end of the day, this was and still is the largest mining area in the world.

125
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:23,967
That's where Sebastião grew. He was the only child among seven sisters.

126
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:25,426
What a life!

127
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:28,134
Every summer,

128
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,967
He played on the banks of the Rio Doce, the "sweet river".

129
00:15:33,093 --> 00:15:35,176
That's where we are.

130
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:36,634
So here we are,

131
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:39,092
our small crew.

132
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:40,842
Sebastian, ¿te ahí falls?

133
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:43,051
I learned one thing.

134
00:15:43,802 --> 00:15:46,510
Having a photographer in front of my camera

135
00:15:46,636 --> 00:15:49,593
It is very different from shooting anyone else.

136
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:53,342
Not standing still doing himself.

137
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:58,552
No. For professional bias, react and respond

138
00:15:58,886 --> 00:16:01,802
using his weapon, his camera.

139
00:16:02,386 --> 00:16:04,136
Returns the shot.

140
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:08,386
- Wim, I have a very nice picture of you. - I will not say it.

141
00:16:08,512 --> 00:16:09,885
I can imagine!

142
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,219
In this case, it was not just me ... fotografiándome

143
00:16:13,345 --> 00:16:14,178
Look at the picture.

144
00:16:14,428 --> 00:16:17,053
Two of us had on target.

145
00:16:17,178 --> 00:16:20,844
The other, my fellow director, was his eldest son, Julian.

146
00:16:21,345 --> 00:16:25,844
He had already accompanied his father with his camera on several trips,

147
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,887
as Papua New Guinea, who have already seen.

148
00:16:30,012 --> 00:16:35,304
Or here, to a remote island north of the East Siberian Sea.

149
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,928
I wish I could join them.

150
00:16:47,388 --> 00:16:52,429
Father and son Salgado invited me to continue this documentary with them,

151
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:55,179
I guess to add an external view of your adventure.

152
00:16:56,263 --> 00:16:58,138
I did not hesitate for a second.

153
00:16:58,264 --> 00:17:00,720
What more could you ask for?

154
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:04,345
At last I could get to know this man,

155
00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:06,763
discover what motivated him

156
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:10,638
and why his work had impressed me so much.

157
00:17:11,307 --> 00:17:15,805
I did not know I was going to discover

158
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:18,055
much more than a photographer.

159
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:24,806
Sebastião was 15

160
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:28,431
when he took the train and went to the small town forever

161
00:17:28,556 --> 00:17:32,056
to attend school in the provincial capital of Vitoria.

162
00:17:32,557 --> 00:17:36,889
So young, at first did not know what to do with money in their pockets.

163
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,889
I had never paid any money.

164
00:17:40,014 --> 00:17:42,723
On the farm, which produced all of them.

165
00:17:42,848 --> 00:17:45,681
So, at first, starved,

166
00:17:45,807 --> 00:17:49,181
dreading going to a store to order something to eat.

167
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:55,931
Ignorant of what had become of Sebastião

168
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:59,390
He had not appeared this girl in your life.

169
00:17:59,516 --> 00:18:00,765
Lelia.

170
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:04,890
I was 17, I was studying music and incredibly beautiful.

171
00:18:05,016 --> 00:18:07,139
It was love at first sight.

172
00:18:07,265 --> 00:18:09,140
When Sebastião won a scholarship

173
00:18:09,475 --> 00:18:12,515
to study for a Master in Economics from the University of Sao Paulo

174
00:18:12,766 --> 00:18:15,183
they moved there and married.

175
00:18:17,892 --> 00:18:19,224
It was the 60,

176
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,974
both they involved in left-wing movements,

177
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,848
as other students in Paris, Berlin or Chicago.

178
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:29,808
Brazil was under the rule of a brutal military dictatorship,

179
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:34,265
thus, the risk of being arrested, deported and tortured was constant.

180
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:38,766
In August 1969,

181
00:18:39,392 --> 00:18:41,934
Sebastian y su Lelia if marcharon of homeland

182
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,100
and they took a boat to France.

183
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,142
Sebastião while continuing his training as an economist,

184
00:18:49,351 --> 00:18:51,809
Lélia studying architecture.

185
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:55,684
A memorable day, she bought a camera for their work.

186
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:59,142
And we really had fun with her was Sebastião.

187
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:03,171
The first photograph was taken Lélia, of course.

188
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:08,434
Sebastião entered the International Coffee Organization

189
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,893
and they moved to London.

190
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:12,435
With the idea of ​​a career in the World Bank,

191
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:16,893
often he traveled to Africa to study development projects.

192
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:18,935
Lélia's camera was taking

193
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:22,726
and always he returned with many pictures.

194
00:19:24,311 --> 00:19:26,310
Realizing that those pictures

195
00:19:26,437 --> 00:19:30,185
They met him much more than economic reports,

196
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:33,560
both took a bold decision.

197
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:35,769
He had to take the enormous risk

198
00:19:36,562 --> 00:19:40,769
to abandon his promising career as an economist

199
00:19:41,063 --> 00:19:42,936
to start from scratch.

200
00:19:43,812 --> 00:19:48,519
They returned to Paris and spent all photographic equipment cost.

201
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:53,227
For a time, Sebastião tried photographing sports,

202
00:19:53,354 --> 00:19:56,645
made portraits, weddings and even naked,

203
00:19:56,771 --> 00:19:59,270
before finding his calling.

204
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,353
Those are my first photos.

205
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:09,562
We were in Tahoua.

206
00:20:10,354 --> 00:20:12,937
Two young mothers queuing

207
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:16,354
to receive food.

208
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,604
It was a time of great drought in Niger, 1973.

209
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:26,729
For Lelia was more difficult because she was pregnant.

210
00:20:26,855 --> 00:20:30,229
I remember once we were there,

211
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:34,479
in a friend's house in Niamey.

212
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,521
Then came the marabout of Niamey.

213
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:42,021
Lélia was wearing shorts, she was gorgeous.

214
00:20:42,897 --> 00:20:46,271
And the marabout came, sat down,

215
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:48,354
and said Lelia.

216
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,855
"Come out, sit on my lap."

217
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:53,814
"Oh," I said,

218
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,898
"Marabout sir, there is a small problem,

219
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:01,730
this woman is pregnant

220
00:21:02,357 --> 00:21:04,064
our first child.

221
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,355
You better stay here. "

222
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:11,356
He understood the need ...

223
00:21:13,441 --> 00:21:16,855
the lack of synchronization at that time.

224
00:21:17,106 --> 00:21:20,440
And finally, we talked so much that it was a kilo of sugar,

225
00:21:20,566 --> 00:21:23,273
as happy as if he had gone with Lelia.

226
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:32,690
His son Julian was born in Paris in 1974.

227
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:36,148
There's my future colleague and co-director.

228
00:21:36,982 --> 00:21:41,649
Lélia continued to support Sebastião around as a young mother.

229
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,899
He worked hard in their studies

230
00:21:44,024 --> 00:21:47,149
and to present the work of Sebastião everywhere.

231
00:21:47,275 --> 00:21:50,482
In magazines, newspapers and agencies.

232
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:51,607
And so,

233
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:54,732
after some relevant publications,

234
00:21:55,276 --> 00:22:00,733
both they found the courage to conceive her first major photographic project.

235
00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:05,276
"Other Americas".

236
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:10,150
It would take Sebastião throughout South America.

237
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:12,275
The small Juliano got used

238
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:15,983
the long absences of her father.

239
00:22:18,234 --> 00:22:21,901
OTHER AMERICAS

240
00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:27,234
After leaving Brazil in 1969,

241
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,359
I started to really miss Latin America.

242
00:22:31,735 --> 00:22:34,233
And I decided to make a trip

243
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,610
to neighboring Brazil.

244
00:22:36,736 --> 00:22:40,610
Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia ...

245
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:45,734
Also it sounded to see mountains of Latin America.

246
00:22:45,861 --> 00:22:47,443
The Andes.

247
00:22:48,527 --> 00:22:53,819
At that time, Latin America, there was a profound social upheaval.

248
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:56,901
Theology of Liberation.

249
00:22:58,153 --> 00:23:02,819
On that trip I met a young priest in Ecuador,

250
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,860
Gabicho named.

251
00:23:04,986 --> 00:23:09,444
We fear the same age, a young photographer and a young priest.

252
00:23:09,695 --> 00:23:12,403
He was the one who carried the word of God,

253
00:23:12,528 --> 00:23:18,360
farmers organized into cooperatives, introducing solidarity.

254
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:22,279
And when he had all these communities to reach,

255
00:23:22,404 --> 00:23:25,736
I could make impressive trips.

256
00:23:30,362 --> 00:23:32,986
Here we were more than 3,000 meters.

257
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:38,403
Sometimes we climbed slopes of 600 to 700 meters per day.

258
00:23:38,905 --> 00:23:43,029
But I greatly enjoyed living in this landscape,

259
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:44,945
in those communities.

260
00:23:47,988 --> 00:23:52,529
These are the Saraguros, a group of Indians in southern Ecuador.

261
00:23:52,655 --> 00:23:57,655
Very religious, but also heavy drinkers of alcohol.

262
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:02,987
More than half of the community, on weekends, men and women

263
00:24:03,113 --> 00:24:05,404
They are completely drunk.

264
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,488
The farmer left

265
00:24:11,156 --> 00:24:13,738
It called Lupe, Guadalupe.

266
00:24:14,114 --> 00:24:17,905
Lupe was my friend.

267
00:24:18,448 --> 00:24:21,530
At that time, I had very long hair,

268
00:24:21,656 --> 00:24:23,531
blonde and very long.

269
00:24:23,657 --> 00:24:26,863
And he had a big beard, redhead and blonde.

270
00:24:29,365 --> 00:24:31,989
One day we were walking through the mountains,

271
00:24:32,115 --> 00:24:35,738
He approached me and told me. "Look, Sebastião,

272
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:38,781
I know that you have sent from heaven. "

273
00:24:38,906 --> 00:24:42,781
Because according to legend Saraguros

274
00:24:42,907 --> 00:24:46,656
the gods, to the image of Christ,

275
00:24:46,782 --> 00:24:51,281
They return to Earth to see them, to observe

276
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,989
and see who deserved heaven.

277
00:24:54,115 --> 00:24:59,865
While touring the mountains, he took the opportunity to tell his life.

278
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,739
He firmly believed that I was there to observe them.

279
00:25:06,865 --> 00:25:10,782
And up there counting their behavior.

280
00:25:14,617 --> 00:25:19,657
I had never seen before, an entire people

281
00:25:19,783 --> 00:25:23,450
another rhythm of time.

282
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:30,075
The time I spent with Saraguros seemed a hundred years.

283
00:25:30,201 --> 00:25:32,575
Everything was so slow.

284
00:25:33,117 --> 00:25:37,075
It was another way of thinking, another speed.

285
00:25:39,243 --> 00:25:42,116
There were fatalism in their faces.

286
00:25:45,702 --> 00:25:48,617
This is in the state of Oaxaca in Mexico,

287
00:25:48,952 --> 00:25:52,366
is a group of peasants called mixes.

288
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:58,909
There, everything is medieval, the plow, all ...

289
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,534
It was the profound Latin America.

290
00:26:06,286 --> 00:26:09,034
He was a peasant village,

291
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:14,451
but more important was the music that community.

292
00:26:14,661 --> 00:26:18,035
It was a people who loved music.

293
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:24,285
All members of the community who could play an instrument

294
00:26:24,536 --> 00:26:26,785
They did not need to work.

295
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:29,410
They worked as musicians.

296
00:26:34,244 --> 00:26:37,077
They let me sleep a few days

297
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:41,368
in a cement room, very cold,

298
00:26:41,494 --> 00:26:45,618
to see if reluctant, if you really wanted to stay.

299
00:26:46,245 --> 00:26:48,619
As I managed to resist,

300
00:26:48,745 --> 00:26:51,744
I was taken from there and took me to a house.

301
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,786
I went more to the community.

302
00:26:54,995 --> 00:26:56,495
And for me it was a pleasure.

303
00:26:56,829 --> 00:27:00,412
We became friends and coexisted in harmony in the community.

304
00:27:08,412 --> 00:27:12,411
This is in northern Mexico, are the Tarahumara.

305
00:27:13,205 --> 00:27:17,370
They are great runners are runners.

306
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,412
They walk away.

307
00:27:19,955 --> 00:27:22,870
My God, it was hell follow these aborigines

308
00:27:22,996 --> 00:27:25,954
they were not walking, flying!

309
00:27:34,372 --> 00:27:35,871
This is a Tarahumara,

310
00:27:35,997 --> 00:27:40,621
with his face well marked, well lived.

311
00:27:43,498 --> 00:27:46,871
With her beautiful hair, great hair.

312
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:52,247
Several times they came to my camera

313
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:56,831
and they made me feel a sound technician.

314
00:27:57,873 --> 00:28:02,496
They told me things like I was recording them.

315
00:28:07,873 --> 00:28:12,914
The strength of a portrait is that in that split second

316
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:17,914
We understand a little the life of the person photographed.

317
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,915
The eyes speak volumes, the expression of the face.

318
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:27,873
When you do a portrait, is not you alone who takes the picture.

319
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:30,373
The person offers photo.

320
00:28:34,999 --> 00:28:37,832
Those trips were very important to me.

321
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:45,040
To return after years without stepping on my country, to be here.

322
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,041
The essence was the same, it was my continent, we were very close.

323
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:55,916
"Other Americas" led him to Sebastião eight years.

324
00:28:56,209 --> 00:28:59,250
On this trip to South America deeper

325
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:03,500
he simply disappeared for long periods.

326
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:07,750
Julian grew up with a father who was almost always absent.

327
00:29:08,293 --> 00:29:11,709
His parents could at least correspond.

328
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:15,959
Clearly this occurred before the current media.

329
00:29:17,377 --> 00:29:20,334
Each time he returned home to see his family

330
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,125
and edit your photos with Lelia.

331
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:26,960
Sebastião seemed like a great adventurer to his son.

332
00:29:27,086 --> 00:29:30,960
A superhero, rather than a photographer.

333
00:29:31,086 --> 00:29:32,084
i And cut!

334
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:36,709
I am, thirty years later.

335
00:29:36,835 --> 00:29:40,419
Finally, I joined my father in one of his missions.

336
00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:42,209
A Wrangel,

337
00:29:42,336 --> 00:29:45,418
a desert island in the Arctic Ocean.

338
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:48,251
Sebastião hoped to photograph

339
00:29:48,377 --> 00:29:51,168
the last great gathering of walruses.

340
00:29:52,544 --> 00:29:55,376
I wanted to find out who the man was,

341
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:59,210
the man he had only known as father.

342
00:30:01,212 --> 00:30:07,295
I wanted to find the photographer, adventurer, for the first time.

343
00:31:31,048 --> 00:31:32,631
Cursed Bear!

344
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,297
We had the bear.

345
00:31:34,423 --> 00:31:38,255
Incredible! It has made everyone from getting into the water.

346
00:32:17,093 --> 00:32:18,799
What are you thinking?

347
00:32:19,592 --> 00:32:21,550
What are you thinking, Father?

348
00:32:21,801 --> 00:32:26,008
I'm thinking, you know, doing this will be difficult.

349
00:32:29,342 --> 00:32:30,633
I do not know if it's okay.

350
00:32:46,509 --> 00:32:52,551
It is different when the bear is close, we can take a picture with him closely.

351
00:32:52,677 --> 00:32:55,008
But with a scenario that is not good.

352
00:32:55,426 --> 00:32:59,175
We have a document of the bear, but we do not have a photo.

353
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,093
This is not right.

354
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,634
There's nothing behind.

355
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,384
Nothing to frame the photo, to beautify the landscape.

356
00:33:14,428 --> 00:33:16,802
Not have stock, we have nothing.

357
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:53,143
Awesome!

358
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:56,686
The image I had in the end, are the teeth out,

359
00:36:56,812 --> 00:37:00,061
They could not discern the shapes of heads, stunning.

360
00:37:00,187 --> 00:37:02,978
Like we were in Dante's Inferno,

361
00:37:03,103 --> 00:37:05,269
with all those teeth,

362
00:37:05,395 --> 00:37:07,560
all these forms ... Incredible!

363
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:32,437
Father, talk to me a little of your 1979?

364
00:37:35,855 --> 00:37:39,645
In 79, Lélia was pregnant, expecting her second child.

365
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:41,979
It would be child already knew.

366
00:37:43,855 --> 00:37:46,062
And when Rodrigo was born,

367
00:37:46,188 --> 00:37:51,105
everything was going to be Down syndrome.

368
00:37:51,731 --> 00:37:55,396
It was nice, torn eyes,

369
00:37:55,522 --> 00:37:59,396
and I had the impression that it was completely normal.

370
00:37:59,522 --> 00:38:01,271
And also Lélia.

371
00:38:01,896 --> 00:38:08,146
The doctor did many tests. Three weeks await your response.

372
00:38:08,273 --> 00:38:10,396
The day I called the doctor

373
00:38:11,647 --> 00:38:14,481
I felt such a strong tension,

374
00:38:14,606 --> 00:38:17,189
when I saw the answer, I cried.

375
00:38:17,314 --> 00:38:19,313
He could not stop mourn.

376
00:38:24,857 --> 00:38:28,896
My little brother would never be able to go to school,

377
00:38:29,023 --> 00:38:32,398
or read and write like me.

378
00:38:32,524 --> 00:38:36,523
Rodrigo would be isolated in a world that we were never going to be able to share.

379
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,272
It was very difficult for my parents.

380
00:38:40,483 --> 00:38:42,607
But then something happened.

381
00:38:43,483 --> 00:38:47,023
Thanks to love, Rodrigo created his own language.

382
00:38:48,108 --> 00:38:49,107
Slowly,

383
00:38:49,524 --> 00:38:53,398
as a family, we learned to decipher their emotional alphabet

384
00:38:53,524 --> 00:38:55,939
and communicate without words.

385
00:39:00,274 --> 00:39:04,607
Poce later, my mother, my brother and I took a plane to Brazil.

386
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:07,566
The military dictatorship had fallen.

387
00:39:07,692 --> 00:39:13,190
Topic five years and did not understand how important this trip was going to be.

388
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:17,483
At one point, a man climbed one of the blinds

389
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:21,150
and sunlight flooded the interior of the aircraft.

390
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,317
A voice echoed in the cabin:

391
00:39:24,442 --> 00:39:26,567
"We are flying over Brazil."

392
00:39:26,692 --> 00:39:30,234
My mother looked out the window and said nothing.

393
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,942
He was seeing his homeland for the first time after many years.

394
00:39:35,444 --> 00:39:39,234
It was a moment of happiness, and yet, when I looked,

395
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:41,400
I was crying.

396
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:48,610
My father was in French Guiana and would come later.

397
00:39:49,901 --> 00:39:53,568
December 31, returning to Brazil.

398
00:39:53,694 --> 00:39:56,776
It was great to get to your country,

399
00:39:57,444 --> 00:40:00,526
After 10 years, half out.

400
00:40:01,527 --> 00:40:05,901
It was shocking. Lelia had left the Vitoria was not found.

401
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:10,526
Vitória urbanism had changed. Everything had changed.

402
00:40:11,652 --> 00:40:13,986
My region had changed.

403
00:40:14,652 --> 00:40:19,569
I met again with my parents. The I left young and strong.

404
00:40:19,778 --> 00:40:24,319
On returning I found an old man. My father was very old.

405
00:40:25,195 --> 00:40:26,486
But, at that time,

406
00:40:26,612 --> 00:40:30,110
I wanted to see Brazil further.

407
00:40:30,945 --> 00:40:33,069
My sister gave me a car

408
00:40:34,278 --> 00:40:37,652
and I traveled for six months in the northeast of Brazil.

409
00:40:37,779 --> 00:40:39,777
He did not know the northeast.

410
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:43,237
He had always dreamed of northeastern Brazil.

411
00:41:05,946 --> 00:41:08,778
I met these people on a funeral.

412
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:13,696
I parked on the side of the road and went with them.

413
00:41:15,904 --> 00:41:20,654
Infant mortality was very high in the northeast of Brazil.

414
00:41:21,155 --> 00:41:24,821
These are children who died before baptism.

415
00:41:26,656 --> 00:41:29,947
It is believed that unbaptized children

416
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,947
They have no right to go to heaven.

417
00:41:34,364 --> 00:41:38,904
They stay in a region between both worlds, called limbo.

418
00:41:40,406 --> 00:41:44,947
Children buried with his eyes closed, they were baptized.

419
00:41:45,073 --> 00:41:46,739
If his eyes were open ...

420
00:41:46,865 --> 00:41:50,280
and they buried him to find his way.

421
00:41:50,406 --> 00:41:55,115
Otherwise, it was wandering for eternity.

422
00:42:03,449 --> 00:42:07,823
At that time, the coffins were rented in the church.

423
00:42:07,949 --> 00:42:10,406
Rent the coffin was cheaper.

424
00:42:11,074 --> 00:42:14,406
The same coffin was used dozens of times.

425
00:42:21,075 --> 00:42:25,324
This is perfectly seen the coffins to rent ...

426
00:42:28,075 --> 00:42:30,157
and these are shoes.

427
00:42:30,283 --> 00:42:34,699
He sold everything: shoes, coffins, bananas, vegetables,

428
00:42:34,908 --> 00:42:37,741
ice cream, all ...

429
00:42:38,658 --> 00:42:44,324
It is an area of ​​the world where life and death are very close.

430
00:42:47,826 --> 00:42:52,075
Here is a prayer group

431
00:42:52,201 --> 00:42:55,782
exerting political work at the same time.

432
00:42:56,534 --> 00:43:00,032
In Brazil, we had and still have

433
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:03,242
a great movement of landless peasants.

434
00:43:03,451 --> 00:43:08,033
Many of them, the majority come from here.

435
00:43:08,826 --> 00:43:11,408
Proviene del northeast of Brazil.

436
00:43:18,285 --> 00:43:19,284
They are people

437
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:22,284
a great moral force,

438
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:24,868
great physical strength,

439
00:43:24,995 --> 00:43:29,951
despite being very fragile because they eat poorly.

440
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,618
Look at the dryness of the area. It is very dry.

441
00:43:35,327 --> 00:43:39,409
Why so, we have a piece of Sahel here in Brazil.

442
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,368
And here in the street,

443
00:43:44,494 --> 00:43:47,619
people leave for good.

444
00:43:47,954 --> 00:43:50,995
Sometimes the land is so dry, so hard,

445
00:43:51,121 --> 00:43:53,702
people migrate to cities in the south.

446
00:43:53,828 --> 00:43:56,994
They give up, leave the land.

447
00:44:18,247 --> 00:44:19,994
FARM SALGALO

448
00:44:19,995 --> 00:44:22,121
MINAS GERAIS, BRAZIL

449
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,620
We have spent many years suffering a shortage of rain.

450
00:44:40,705 --> 00:44:45,829
Here we had many cattle.

451
00:44:45,955 --> 00:44:48,205
Now we have nothing, it's over.

452
00:44:49,248 --> 00:44:51,265
The drought was great.

453
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,400
He finished with pastures, ended income.

454
00:44:55,955 --> 00:44:57,788
How it ended, Grandpa? Why it's over?

455
00:44:57,914 --> 00:44:59,805
It ended because of the drought.

456
00:45:02,414 --> 00:45:06,789
He stood around, but no one saw or a grass grow.

457
00:45:06,914 --> 00:45:08,956
Now we just have time.

458
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,830
Between your father and I,

459
00:45:11,956 --> 00:45:14,955
20,000 invested in that.

460
00:45:15,498 --> 00:45:16,623
Where you are?

461
00:45:18,581 --> 00:45:20,539
Here he abounded all.

462
00:45:21,164 --> 00:45:25,664
There were many birds many sparrows.

463
00:45:26,082 --> 00:45:29,665
Canarios, tico-ticos,

464
00:45:30,457 --> 00:45:31,956
zorzales ...

465
00:45:33,415 --> 00:45:37,164
There on the hill, there was a good kill.

466
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:41,248
And in that summit also he had a very good head.

467
00:45:42,082 --> 00:45:44,874
There is much erosion.

468
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,801
Now, for example, the land is bonded.

469
00:45:46,915 --> 00:45:51,155
If rains come, there no grass, nothing,

470
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:55,290
to hold, cause a disaster.

471
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:58,166
I have no idea ...

472
00:45:58,167 --> 00:46:01,730
to know how to stop erosion.

473
00:46:10,417 --> 00:46:13,500
He grandfather, he was in the hacienda happy?

474
00:46:13,626 --> 00:46:14,625
What?

475
00:46:14,751 --> 00:46:17,500
If I was in this hacienda happy?

476
00:46:19,667 --> 00:46:20,959
¿Si was happy?

477
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:23,958
I was happy to have my children.

478
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:26,666
I raised all, seven women,

479
00:46:27,209 --> 00:46:29,708
with six career as Tiao.

480
00:46:29,834 --> 00:46:32,958
I raised my children here with difficulty.

481
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:34,667
I was happy.

482
00:46:38,043 --> 00:46:39,682
Only wood I took over a hundred contos

483
00:46:42,252 --> 00:46:44,459
to take my children to school.

484
00:46:44,585 --> 00:46:47,960
All were raised with good nutrition

485
00:46:48,086 --> 00:46:50,251
with good clothes.

486
00:46:55,919 --> 00:47:00,168
Since I arrived in Brazil, the land of my grandfather have been.

487
00:47:00,544 --> 00:47:03,835
Burned and dry.

488
00:47:04,294 --> 00:47:09,168
When Sebastião returned to the farm after traveling the northeast of Brazil,

489
00:47:09,294 --> 00:47:13,293
the place had nothing to do with paradise he remembered as a child.

490
00:47:13,712 --> 00:47:16,918
But he worried about something else.

491
00:47:17,044 --> 00:47:20,627
The suffering he saw, changed.

492
00:47:21,378 --> 00:47:24,835
His role as a photographer took on new meaning.

493
00:47:24,962 --> 00:47:28,003
We understood how important it was for him to leave.

494
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:35,419
She missed him terribly, but I understood.

495
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,961
Sahel, THE END OF THE ROAD 1984-1986

496
00:47:47,087 --> 00:47:51,295
For his next project, which would lead to Sahel in Africa,

497
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:55,255
Sebastião began working with MSF.

498
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:03,755
I worked in Ethiopia in 1984.

499
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:09,462
And then I continued throughout the Sahel, 85 and 86.

500
00:48:09,713 --> 00:48:13,630
Finally, spend nearly two years in a row in this region

501
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:17,088
doing a story about hunger.

502
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,505
There was a refugee camp,

503
00:48:22,631 --> 00:48:25,796
the largest in the history of mankind so far.

504
00:48:26,047 --> 00:48:29,213
I had a wild desire to show that.

505
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:33,338
To show that there was a large part of humanity

506
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:36,422
He is living in poverty.

507
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:40,631
Which it was mostly a problem of deals

508
00:48:40,883 --> 00:48:44,422
not just a question of natural disasters.

509
00:48:47,173 --> 00:48:49,881
It was a Coptic region

510
00:48:50,006 --> 00:48:54,089
They are Christians in northern Ethiopia,

511
00:48:54,215 --> 00:48:56,548
of tremendous humility.

512
00:48:56,882 --> 00:48:59,631
They are unable, even with a child about to die,

513
00:48:59,757 --> 00:49:02,422
to take the lead of others.

514
00:49:02,548 --> 00:49:04,464
They prefer to wait.

515
00:49:11,049 --> 00:49:13,548
Look at the state are.

516
00:49:15,424 --> 00:49:19,258
In that state, one does not stand long.

517
00:49:19,674 --> 00:49:23,298
In those fields hunger killed many lives.

518
00:49:23,841 --> 00:49:27,090
Causes physical discomfort,

519
00:49:27,216 --> 00:49:30,174
but other diseases that they kill.

520
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:36,632
If we take the anger, we become dehydrated quickly.

521
00:49:36,758 --> 00:49:41,174
We can lose up to 12 liters of fluid a day due to diarrhea

522
00:49:41,634 --> 00:49:44,090
and die in two or three days.

523
00:49:49,092 --> 00:49:51,258
So young faces

524
00:49:52,301 --> 00:49:56,259
and so aged by suffering.

525
00:49:56,676 --> 00:50:00,009
If you look at the front, it is not elderly,

526
00:50:00,135 --> 00:50:03,841
it has aged are the eyes, which are empty.

527
00:50:04,093 --> 00:50:07,217
Look how young he is. Look at your baby.

528
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,675
He was her husband.

529
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:17,926
During the night because of the cold, many deaths they occur.

530
00:50:21,468 --> 00:50:25,425
Dying here is like a continuation of life.

531
00:50:25,551 --> 00:50:28,093
People get used to die.

532
00:50:29,844 --> 00:50:33,052
A husband to his wife washed before burial.

533
00:50:36,262 --> 00:50:40,594
With mountain clothes, dressed in goatskins.

534
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:46,344
A pretty young woman.

535
00:50:52,053 --> 00:50:54,302
According to Coptic beliefs,

536
00:50:54,428 --> 00:50:58,344
the body must be clean for the encounter with God.

537
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:01,636
It should be washed, wash it all

538
00:51:02,262 --> 00:51:04,678
although water is scarce.

539
00:51:08,471 --> 00:51:12,344
Every person killed is a piece of the world that dies.

540
00:51:20,596 --> 00:51:24,012
A father prepares his son for burial,

541
00:51:24,138 --> 00:51:26,637
to say the last goodbye.

542
00:51:29,888 --> 00:51:32,512
Usually it is the family that prepares its dead.

543
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,387
And know that the government

544
00:51:42,513 --> 00:51:47,429
retains food, not allowed to reach the population

545
00:51:47,555 --> 00:51:50,513
as happened there,

546
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:53,180
in that field in northern Ethiopia ...

547
00:51:53,598 --> 00:51:57,971
It was a brutal political dishonesty.

548
00:52:09,806 --> 00:52:12,597
Ethiopia Tigray Region, 1984

549
00:52:12,973 --> 00:52:17,555
I returned to Ethiopia in late 1984.

550
00:52:17,931 --> 00:52:22,597
By then, the guerrillas realized that the government was plundering the region.

551
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:25,848
They began to send people to Sudan.

552
00:52:26,432 --> 00:52:29,640
They went through the region of Tigray.

553
00:52:33,391 --> 00:52:35,931
There was an attack by two helicopters.

554
00:52:36,057 --> 00:52:39,766
They were Mi-24 combat helicopters very fast.

555
00:52:39,891 --> 00:52:42,431
They shot people with machine guns.

556
00:52:43,807 --> 00:52:46,307
I took a picture and ran.

557
00:52:50,183 --> 00:52:52,599
Many pregnant women walked

558
00:52:52,725 --> 00:52:58,306
hoping to be able to eat and drink water

559
00:52:58,433 --> 00:53:01,141
to reach the promised land.

560
00:53:05,183 --> 00:53:07,599
I had to go there

561
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,807
at least two more months.

562
00:53:11,184 --> 00:53:13,557
And when I arrived in Sudan,

563
00:53:13,767 --> 00:53:17,057
I had a lot of work with the arrival of these people.

564
00:53:21,309 --> 00:53:23,808
This man came from Ethiopia.

565
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:27,308
His son was exhausted, perhaps dead,

566
00:53:27,434 --> 00:53:29,725
but the man was carrying.

567
00:53:29,851 --> 00:53:33,059
When he got to the doctors the child was dead,

568
00:53:34,684 --> 00:53:37,018
after so much walking.

569
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:48,726
We had to decamp from MSF.

570
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:52,142
Water is essential in these camps

571
00:53:52,268 --> 00:53:54,059
and it was becoming a big problem.

572
00:53:54,185 --> 00:53:57,434
You had to move as quickly as possible.

573
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:05,726
They piled into the trucks of the United Nations

574
00:54:05,978 --> 00:54:09,435
to take them to another camp,

575
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:12,935
a beautiful and fertile land

576
00:54:13,187 --> 00:54:15,727
on the banks of the Blue Nile.

577
00:54:16,645 --> 00:54:20,852
I did about 300, 400 kilometers aboard these trucks.

578
00:54:24,729 --> 00:54:26,936
Two of my friends truck,

579
00:54:27,062 --> 00:54:31,228
They acted as if it were a Sunday afternoon either,

580
00:54:31,354 --> 00:54:34,935
and they were telling stories under a tree.

581
00:54:38,646 --> 00:54:41,895
Being close to the Nile, we had water.

582
00:54:42,021 --> 00:54:45,771
But here people died

583
00:54:46,021 --> 00:54:47,936
because there was no food.

584
00:54:48,229 --> 00:54:51,228
They reached the edge of poverty.

585
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:59,312
They forgot or could not bring food.

586
00:54:59,438 --> 00:55:02,229
There was a disorganization of food.

587
00:55:02,355 --> 00:55:04,562
They said there was, that there was.

588
00:55:04,688 --> 00:55:07,522
And when I got here there was nothing.

589
00:55:18,939 --> 00:55:21,063
Me fui a Mali.

590
00:55:21,899 --> 00:55:24,730
Here too there was a great drought.

591
00:55:26,481 --> 00:55:29,688
The skin of the people were like the bark of trees.

592
00:55:30,023 --> 00:55:33,772
Trees marked by wind and sand,

593
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:37,481
by sandstorms.

594
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,605
There were only women and children.

595
00:55:49,857 --> 00:55:52,481
The men went to Libya to work,

596
00:55:52,607 --> 00:55:57,814
or they migrated to Ivory Coast in search of work

597
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:01,732
with the promise to return and bring food for the family.

598
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,315
But very few returned.

599
00:56:14,358 --> 00:56:16,648
All were safe

600
00:56:16,775 --> 00:56:19,649
because MSF did a great job.

601
00:56:19,775 --> 00:56:22,899
They brought aid to the region.

602
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:29,232
This is a friend, Luc, a Belgian doctor.

603
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:34,899
It is measuring and weighing the child.

604
00:56:37,151 --> 00:56:40,733
After 15, 20 days, they were unrecognizable, healthier.

605
00:56:40,859 --> 00:56:43,565
But they were scarred for life

606
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:48,066
because they lacked things during growth.

607
00:56:53,401 --> 00:56:55,066
This kid was alone,

608
00:56:55,777 --> 00:56:58,984
with his little guitar in hand,

609
00:56:59,109 --> 00:57:02,651
He is carrying the remains of a shirt,

610
00:57:02,985 --> 00:57:04,735
but not wearing pants.

611
00:57:06,068 --> 00:57:10,068
Watch her determination, her posture.

612
00:57:10,194 --> 00:57:13,526
He is someone who knows where it goes.

613
00:57:13,652 --> 00:57:18,193
Looking for other groups of people,

614
00:57:19,027 --> 00:57:20,318
with your dog ...

615
00:57:20,444 --> 00:57:23,278
A boy of eight, nine years.

616
00:57:28,944 --> 00:57:31,611
Sebastian is encariñó

617
00:57:31,737 --> 00:57:34,943
with the people of the Sahel region.

618
00:57:35,069 --> 00:57:37,111
Again and again.

619
00:57:38,778 --> 00:57:43,318
Photos, the book and the exhibition of Lélia

620
00:57:43,444 --> 00:57:46,112
They called the world's attention on droughts,

621
00:57:46,237 --> 00:57:48,403
and the fate of millions of lives.

622
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:53,069
And unanswered questions about the cause of that situation.

623
00:57:55,112 --> 00:57:59,695
Then Sebastião turned to a topic that he spent another six years

624
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:04,029
and countless trips to almost thirty countries.

625
00:58:04,196 --> 00:58:05,486
WORKERS

626
00:58:05,612 --> 00:58:10,796
The third volume of photographs conceived with Lélia.

627
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,445
I wanted to pay a kind of homage

628
00:58:14,987 --> 00:58:18,904
all men and women who built our world.

629
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,408
The archeology of the industrial era.

630
00:58:24,113 --> 00:58:26,237
Sebastian y Lelia investigaron

631
00:58:26,363 --> 00:58:29,029
and planned "Workers" meticulously.

632
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:33,779
Then he again traveled to the four corners of the world.

633
00:58:35,946 --> 00:58:38,228
He photographed steelworkers in the Soviet Union,

634
00:58:38,447 --> 00:58:40,322
he lived with saboteurs ships in Bangladesh,

635
00:58:40,946 --> 00:58:43,946
sailed with fishermen in Galicia and Sicily,

636
00:58:44,403 --> 00:58:47,238
He showed the mechanical production of cars in Kolkata.

637
00:58:47,531 --> 00:58:49,655
He watched farmers in Rwanda,

638
00:58:49,781 --> 00:58:52,822
country had already visited, but as an economist.

639
00:58:53,406 --> 00:58:55,822
Now the mission was another.

640
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:59,738
His perspective had changed, but he was the same.

641
00:59:00,074 --> 00:59:03,863
Driven by the same empathy for the human condition.

642
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:07,198
With each episode of "workers"

643
00:59:07,663 --> 00:59:09,781
Sebastião was completely submerged

644
00:59:10,907 --> 00:59:13,321
in the field of manual labor.

645
00:59:13,448 --> 00:59:16,906
As the weeks passed with miners in the gold mines of Serra Pelada.

646
00:59:19,152 --> 00:59:24,493
In 1991, at the end of the first Gulf War,

647
00:59:24,528 --> 00:59:26,032
Iraqi troops withdrew

648
00:59:26,157 --> 00:59:29,753
and Saddam Hussein set fire to thousands of oil wells.

649
00:59:30,241 --> 00:59:35,323
Thousands of firefighters from around the world descended on those oil fields.

650
00:59:35,616 --> 00:59:38,741
Sebastião had to go too,

651
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:42,741
driven by curiosity of this explosive profession.

652
00:59:51,575 --> 00:59:54,698
When I saw the first images on TV,

653
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:59,074
I knew I had to do that report.

654
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:03,866
It was like working in a big theater.

655
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:06,699
Some 500 wells on fire.

656
01:00:06,825 --> 01:00:11,241
A scene set in huge, the size of a planet.

657
01:00:11,535 --> 01:00:15,867
No controlled us, we could go where we wanted.

658
01:00:17,368 --> 01:00:21,534
There were fumes, thick smoke, oil.

659
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:26,825
All that accumulated smoke was so dense that the sun did not pass.

660
01:00:27,286 --> 01:00:33,742
Sometimes it was dark 24 hours.

661
01:00:39,911 --> 01:00:42,075
After putting out the fire

662
01:00:42,201 --> 01:00:45,160
the ground was so hot,

663
01:00:45,286 --> 01:00:49,451
I had to throw a lot of water for cooling,

664
01:00:49,577 --> 01:00:54,244
if not, the temperature was so high that oil burn again.

665
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:57,327
Still, sometimes,

666
01:00:57,452 --> 01:01:01,661
There was an explosion that sounded like a cannon.

667
01:01:02,662 --> 01:01:04,910
The noise was deafening.

668
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:08,869
It was like working near the engine of a plane.

669
01:01:09,536 --> 01:01:11,701
Today I'm a little deaf.

670
01:01:11,995 --> 01:01:14,286
My deafness began then.

671
01:01:31,121 --> 01:01:32,452
These are Canadians,

672
01:01:32,579 --> 01:01:35,245
The Calgary Fire Department.

673
01:01:36,871 --> 01:01:39,453
They brought a nice red truck.

674
01:01:39,579 --> 01:01:43,038
And they had a rule: after putting out the fire,

675
01:01:43,163 --> 01:01:46,328
I had to wash the truck every night.

676
01:01:46,454 --> 01:01:49,787
The next morning, returned to be covered in oil.

677
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,788
A hell of a job!

678
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,038
I delayed my departure at least two or three times.

679
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:06,663
Until the day I had to leave.

680
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:10,039
It broke my heart

681
01:02:10,165 --> 01:02:13,538
having to leave such a huge show.

682
01:02:15,873 --> 01:02:17,788
I turned around,

683
01:02:17,914 --> 01:02:20,455
until near the end,

684
01:02:20,748 --> 01:02:24,622
when we passed a big wall.

685
01:02:24,748 --> 01:02:28,247
That day was a reporter for the New York Times.

686
01:02:28,956 --> 01:02:33,289
It was no longer anyone's territory. The war had destroyed everything.

687
01:02:33,706 --> 01:02:35,455
We broke the door.

688
01:02:35,706 --> 01:02:37,123
Upon entering,

689
01:02:37,915 --> 01:02:40,455
a species discovered

690
01:02:40,581 --> 01:02:42,039
Paradise

691
01:02:42,166 --> 01:02:44,205
become a hell.

692
01:02:44,831 --> 01:02:48,914
It was a kind of Garden of the royal family of Kuwait.

693
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:53,205
There were horses, thoroughbreds,

694
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:57,166
they had gone completely mad.

695
01:02:58,291 --> 01:03:01,915
The animals are the first to escape before a catastrophe,

696
01:03:02,041 --> 01:03:04,581
if they are free to escape.

697
01:03:04,916 --> 01:03:07,124
But there they were not.

698
01:03:08,208 --> 01:03:11,165
Birds found there, it was an oasis.

699
01:03:11,292 --> 01:03:13,499
Everything was well irrigated.

700
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:18,874
Birds that could not fly because they were glued feathers.

701
01:03:22,125 --> 01:03:25,874
Kuwaitis left to reach the disaster

702
01:03:26,708 --> 01:03:29,791
leaving the confined animals,

703
01:03:29,917 --> 01:03:33,582
together with the Bedouins, who are not considered human beings.

704
01:03:35,567 --> 01:03:39,997
"Workers" managed to unite the Sebastião Salgado economist

705
01:03:40,032 --> 01:03:42,125
with the artist in which he had become.

706
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:45,917
These photographs have been published in the best journals,

707
01:03:46,043 --> 01:03:48,083
the exhibition toured the world,

708
01:03:48,209 --> 01:03:50,959
and the book was published in many languages.

709
01:03:52,293 --> 01:03:55,501
Pero Sebastian y Lelia in pararon.

710
01:03:56,043 --> 01:04:00,875
They immediately began work on a new phase of his photography.

711
01:04:01,127 --> 01:04:05,251
They noted that another burning issue of our times

712
01:04:05,585 --> 01:04:08,334
It was the displacement of entire populations

713
01:04:08,461 --> 01:04:12,376
due to wars, famines and the role of the global market.

714
01:04:13,335 --> 01:04:16,835
As Europe closed its borders,

715
01:04:17,128 --> 01:04:21,626
Sebastião trying to shed light on the lives of the marginalized.

716
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:27,252
Again with Lelia, he began researching and planning.

717
01:04:27,377 --> 01:04:31,336
She was again the momentum of this new chapter

718
01:04:31,461 --> 01:04:33,710
which they called "Exodus".

719
01:04:34,253 --> 01:04:35,877
EXODUS

720
01:04:36,836 --> 01:04:40,877
It sparked global concern about the lives of these refugees

721
01:04:41,003 --> 01:04:43,044
de India, Vietnam, Filipinas,

722
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,211
South America, Palestine, Iraq

723
01:04:45,337 --> 01:04:47,128
and many other places.

724
01:04:48,046 --> 01:04:51,627
But Sebastião returned again and again to the continent

725
01:04:51,753 --> 01:04:55,545
I had captivated his imagination for some time already.

726
01:04:56,045 --> 01:04:57,628
A África.

727
01:05:08,546 --> 01:05:11,711
I was doing my project on population movements

728
01:05:14,462 --> 01:05:17,711
in 1994, when the Rwandan president's plane

729
01:05:18,297 --> 01:05:20,296
He was killed.

730
01:05:21,047 --> 01:05:24,379
It all started with a great movement of population to Tanzania

731
01:05:24,505 --> 01:05:29,379
due to the brutal repression against the Tutsis in Rwanda.

732
01:05:30,838 --> 01:05:34,462
And I was one of the first to arrive.

733
01:05:35,172 --> 01:05:37,337
It was a catastrophe.

734
01:05:37,463 --> 01:05:39,797
People who fled to Burundi,

735
01:05:40,047 --> 01:05:42,380
al Congo, a Uganda...

736
01:05:42,506 --> 01:05:44,671
They fled to everywhere.

737
01:05:48,922 --> 01:05:52,756
The streets were full of people.

738
01:05:55,798 --> 01:05:57,922
People resting on the side of the road,

739
01:05:58,048 --> 01:06:01,881
he carried all their belongings on bicycles ...

740
01:06:02,006 --> 01:06:04,964
People who fled with what they could.

741
01:06:06,631 --> 01:06:09,339
We follow the path in the opposite direction.

742
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,838
We went to the border.

743
01:06:12,964 --> 01:06:15,713
There was no security, no nothing.

744
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:19,924
I came to Rwanda and that was frightening.

745
01:06:20,131 --> 01:06:24,673
The death toll I met on these roads.

746
01:06:27,465 --> 01:06:29,298
It had broken Granada.

747
01:06:29,965 --> 01:06:34,464
Those who were not killed by the Granada were killed with machetes.

748
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:38,714
I understood the magnitude

749
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:42,674
the catastrophe he was seeing.

750
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:46,341
Genocide was committed in that country.

751
01:06:49,341 --> 01:06:54,133
Were about 150 kilometers to the outskirts of Kigali,

752
01:06:54,258 --> 01:06:57,008
and 150 kilometers of dead.

753
01:07:05,301 --> 01:07:08,758
I returned because my story was about you people.

754
01:07:08,884 --> 01:07:12,883
He was writing a book on refugees, on the exodus.

755
01:07:13,343 --> 01:07:15,467
I went into these camps

756
01:07:15,884 --> 01:07:17,592
and I began to see

757
01:07:17,718 --> 01:07:21,508
the number of people who left Rwanda.

758
01:07:23,677 --> 01:07:26,509
Hell settled in this paradise.

759
01:07:27,427 --> 01:07:29,967
It was frightening

760
01:07:30,093 --> 01:07:33,676
see how in such a beautiful savanna

761
01:07:33,802 --> 01:07:36,926
He had formed a megacity.

762
01:07:39,469 --> 01:07:43,342
Within days, there were almost a million people there.

763
01:07:49,969 --> 01:07:53,803
Amid all this anguish, something touched me very much.

764
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:57,635
It was seeing this mother with her little,

765
01:07:57,761 --> 01:08:01,510
and little confidence in her mother.

766
01:08:14,804 --> 01:08:16,344
Violence

767
01:08:17,054 --> 01:08:18,677
and brutality

768
01:08:18,804 --> 01:08:22,178
they are not a monopoly

769
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:24,261
of distant countries.

770
01:08:24,387 --> 01:08:27,636
It is here, in Europe, in the former Yugoslavia.

771
01:08:27,762 --> 01:08:29,762
It's very shocking.

772
01:08:32,471 --> 01:08:36,470
On a bus coming from Krajina, Croatia across ...

773
01:08:37,638 --> 01:08:40,011
One person was killed through that hole.

774
01:08:40,137 --> 01:08:44,137
Croats killed many people to leave Krajina.

775
01:08:44,846 --> 01:08:46,637
Violence is widespread.

776
01:08:46,764 --> 01:08:50,095
What I dislike most

777
01:08:50,305 --> 01:08:54,304
It is to see how much hatred is contagious.

778
01:08:55,055 --> 01:08:57,471
These people have seen violence.

779
01:08:57,846 --> 01:08:59,137
Entire families.

780
01:08:59,264 --> 01:09:03,430
All Krajina Serb population was expelled.

781
01:09:05,597 --> 01:09:09,971
From time to time they were driven from their homes

782
01:09:10,097 --> 01:09:12,346
looking for a place where to go.

783
01:09:12,472 --> 01:09:16,930
They had their neighbors in front and shooting at them.

784
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:34,847
This is a refugee camp near Tuzla,

785
01:09:35,472 --> 01:09:38,430
en la Bosnia central.

786
01:09:38,556 --> 01:09:41,514
They are families fleeing the enclave of Zepa,

787
01:09:42,183 --> 01:09:45,681
where Serbs killed thousands of young people.

788
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:51,889
We were there at the right time. Just as families arrived

789
01:09:52,474 --> 01:09:55,057
in a state of high anxiety.

790
01:10:06,558 --> 01:10:09,391
There were only women, elderly

791
01:10:09,808 --> 01:10:11,348
and children.

792
01:10:11,474 --> 01:10:15,890
The young men had been detained or killed.

793
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:25,016
It is rare that this happens in Europe,

794
01:10:25,142 --> 01:10:28,307
the late twentieth century.

795
01:10:28,642 --> 01:10:30,058
But here, the cars,

796
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:34,058
we can see that those people with a standard of living

797
01:10:34,184 --> 01:10:36,184
a European standard of living,

798
01:10:36,643 --> 01:10:39,350
with a European intellectual level.

799
01:10:39,684 --> 01:10:41,849
A European infrastructure.

800
01:10:42,226 --> 01:10:43,642
And who lost everything.

801
01:10:47,893 --> 01:10:51,850
Hundreds of kilometers filled with people and cars.

802
01:10:55,935 --> 01:10:57,810
We are a very fierce animal.

803
01:10:57,936 --> 01:11:00,810
We are a terrible animal, we humans.

804
01:11:02,269 --> 01:11:06,060
It is here in Europe, whether in Africa, Latin America, wherever.

805
01:11:06,186 --> 01:11:08,850
Our violence is extreme.

806
01:11:15,686 --> 01:11:17,893
Our history is a history of wars.

807
01:11:25,103 --> 01:11:26,601
It is a story without end,

808
01:11:26,728 --> 01:11:28,852
a history of repression,

809
01:11:28,978 --> 01:11:30,644
crazy story.

810
01:11:39,563 --> 01:11:42,312
The situation in Rwanda continued to evolve.

811
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:46,603
The Hutu army, which had the power, was defeated.

812
01:11:46,729 --> 01:11:51,812
And he retired to the Congo and the region of Goma.

813
01:11:53,146 --> 01:11:57,687
First, the Tutsis had fled the barbarity of the Hutus.

814
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,562
Then they were Hutus

815
01:11:59,687 --> 01:12:02,396
those fleeing Tutsi occupation.

816
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,562
So they all fled.

817
01:12:07,688 --> 01:12:09,521
In several days,

818
01:12:09,646 --> 01:12:12,603
in the month of July 1994

819
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:14,145
Goma region

820
01:12:14,271 --> 01:12:17,312
He welcomed more than two million people.

821
01:12:18,855 --> 01:12:21,395
And there catastrophe was installed,

822
01:12:24,397 --> 01:12:27,313
diseases such as cholera began to spread

823
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:31,229
and people started dropping like flies.

824
01:12:31,689 --> 01:12:35,104
There were at least 12,000 or 15,000 deaths a day.

825
01:12:38,939 --> 01:12:41,855
I took pictures of piles of dead like this.

826
01:12:42,439 --> 01:12:45,105
I saw that father approached with his child,

827
01:12:45,522 --> 01:12:47,022
and throw it there.

828
01:12:47,148 --> 01:12:51,355
He was chatting with fellow like that.

829
01:12:58,148 --> 01:13:01,229
We did not give supply to bury people.

830
01:13:02,273 --> 01:13:05,190
Machine brought a French army

831
01:13:05,441 --> 01:13:09,148
and caught galore, dozens,

832
01:13:09,399 --> 01:13:11,480
They threw them on the ground

833
01:13:11,606 --> 01:13:14,356
and covered with soil.

834
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:34,065
Everyone should see these images,

835
01:13:34,525 --> 01:13:37,440
to see how terrible it is our species.

836
01:13:44,067 --> 01:13:47,441
These orphans, I found them on the road ...

837
01:13:49,318 --> 01:13:50,774
Of these three children

838
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:54,483
the two with the most lively eyes will survive.

839
01:13:54,609 --> 01:13:58,650
The eyes of the morbid, he was dying.

840
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:04,067
When I left there, I was sick.

841
01:14:04,317 --> 01:14:06,733
Very sick. My body was sick.

842
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:10,442
It was not an infectious disease,

843
01:14:10,734 --> 01:14:12,692
my soul was sick.

844
01:14:17,569 --> 01:14:21,651
I went to Rwanda a year after the disaster

845
01:14:21,777 --> 01:14:26,569
for the return of Hutus, who were in the Congo

846
01:14:26,901 --> 01:14:28,818
and they had nowhere to go.

847
01:14:28,944 --> 01:14:33,276
The United Nations began to force them to return.

848
01:14:44,195 --> 01:14:48,485
We felt that the whole planet was covered in refugee tents.

849
01:15:01,653 --> 01:15:03,652
After working there,

850
01:15:03,777 --> 01:15:08,319
Tutsi authorities proposed visit me

851
01:15:08,445 --> 01:15:12,360
several places, scenes of repression.

852
01:15:19,029 --> 01:15:23,986
People took refuge in a church thinking that could be saved.

853
01:15:24,697 --> 01:15:27,195
All were killed.

854
01:15:33,737 --> 01:15:35,945
This was at a school,

855
01:15:36,363 --> 01:15:41,111
You can still see the blackboard with written when passing through.

856
01:15:41,238 --> 01:15:43,321
it was scary.

857
01:15:57,238 --> 01:16:01,404
Of people who left Rwanda, some two million people,

858
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:04,197
some returned to Rwanda,

859
01:16:04,323 --> 01:16:07,029
but the other feared a possible crackdown.

860
01:16:07,155 --> 01:16:12,197
A group of 250,000 people left the city of Goma

861
01:16:12,322 --> 01:16:14,573
and he went into the Congo forest.

862
01:16:17,699 --> 01:16:18,989
We lost.

863
01:16:19,115 --> 01:16:23,073
Everyone knew they were lost 250,000 people.

864
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:25,155
We did not know where they were.

865
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,697
Six months later,

866
01:16:30,282 --> 01:16:34,906
They began to appear Kisangani in central Congo.

867
01:16:37,325 --> 01:16:40,989
They were in the forest for six months.

868
01:16:42,115 --> 01:16:47,364
And here, the UN High Commissioner was taking me right there.

869
01:16:48,532 --> 01:16:51,656
There was a train and rode me.

870
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:56,115
The train, after leaving the food, he should return.

871
01:17:03,783 --> 01:17:08,783
I spent three days with these people kept coming.

872
01:17:08,909 --> 01:17:11,532
Groups and groups of people coming.

873
01:17:13,866 --> 01:17:17,366
But when you think about 250,000 people left,

874
01:17:17,492 --> 01:17:20,158
and 40,000 returnees ...

875
01:17:20,492 --> 01:17:24,533
210,000 people were missing.

876
01:17:34,452 --> 01:17:36,866
And in parallel, life continued.

877
01:17:36,992 --> 01:17:41,700
Men who cut hair.

878
01:17:42,617 --> 01:17:44,952
And this Congolese here,

879
01:17:45,076 --> 01:17:46,825
with his calculator

880
01:17:48,118 --> 01:17:53,659
dollars trying to collect people,

881
01:17:53,785 --> 01:17:57,034
currencies, and it was there trying to change them.

882
01:17:57,494 --> 01:18:01,910
In the middle of nowhere! Amid a forest isolated from everything.

883
01:18:09,327 --> 01:18:10,535
At one point,

884
01:18:11,036 --> 01:18:15,577
that the guerrillas Kisangani, which was protutsi,

885
01:18:15,703 --> 01:18:18,077
and he began to cast these people.

886
01:18:18,453 --> 01:18:19,993
To send them back.

887
01:18:20,119 --> 01:18:24,494
They had to walk another six months to return to Rwanda.

888
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:26,702
They began to kill some.

889
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:32,327
There, I met people who could not more.

890
01:18:32,954 --> 01:18:35,744
They had begun to rave,

891
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:37,785
They had lost his mind.

892
01:18:37,912 --> 01:18:39,493
They had gone mad.

893
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:48,286
In fact, this people who were expelled,

894
01:18:48,704 --> 01:18:50,994
We have not heard anything.

895
01:18:52,413 --> 01:18:54,870
I'm sure they were all killed.

896
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:07,745
This was my last trip, this sad adventure in Rwanda.

897
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:13,620
I went there.

898
01:19:15,205 --> 01:19:19,954
He does not believe in anything. He did not believe in the salvation of the human race.

899
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,746
We could not survive that.

900
01:19:22,872 --> 01:19:24,663
We did not deserve to live anymore.

901
01:19:24,789 --> 01:19:26,746
No one deserved to live.

902
01:19:36,914 --> 01:19:41,914
How many times I threw the camera down to mourn for what he saw?

903
01:19:48,289 --> 01:19:52,664
Sebastião had peered into the heart of darkness

904
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:56,371
and he questioned his work as a social photographer

905
01:19:56,497 --> 01:19:59,622
and witness to the human condition.

906
01:19:59,832 --> 01:20:04,040
What remained to be done after Rwanda?

907
01:20:11,291 --> 01:20:15,915
At that time, my grandfather's health worsened.

908
01:20:16,541 --> 01:20:20,665
My parents had to return to Brazil to take over the farm.

909
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:25,916
It was just barren land. They did not know what to do with that.

910
01:20:27,084 --> 01:20:31,291
Birds, alligators and forests had disappeared.

911
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:35,515
There was no childhood memories of Sebastião.

912
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:42,791
Then Lélia had a surprising idea.

913
01:20:42,917 --> 01:20:46,999
Why we not replant the forest that was here before?

914
01:20:49,751 --> 01:20:54,250
The forest that was here before and that covered these hills

915
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:56,374
It was the Atlantic Forest.

916
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,874
The Atlantic forest.

917
01:20:59,459 --> 01:21:01,750
No one had tried to replant.

918
01:21:02,251 --> 01:21:05,792
Let alone over 600 hectares.

919
01:21:06,376 --> 01:21:09,792
The suggestion came from his desire Lélia

920
01:21:09,918 --> 01:21:12,292
to maintain the spirit of the family.

921
01:21:12,417 --> 01:21:15,667
Anyway, they started using them

922
01:21:16,127 --> 01:21:18,459
and for the next 10 years

923
01:21:18,668 --> 01:21:23,168
what happened in that land was a miracle

924
01:21:23,294 --> 01:21:26,917
which it became, from that moment, the "Terra Institute".

925
01:21:33,586 --> 01:21:36,417
I remember during the first planting,

926
01:21:36,544 --> 01:21:40,335
sometimes dreamed that night was dying all.

927
01:21:42,127 --> 01:21:46,293
Because the soil was horrible. He was in such bad shape

928
01:21:46,419 --> 01:21:49,543
I wondered. Are the plants take root?

929
01:21:50,212 --> 01:21:54,252
In the Atlantic Forest there were 400 different species,

930
01:21:54,378 --> 01:21:57,295
we did not have 400,

931
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:02,085
but just we planted 100 species, 150 ...

932
01:22:02,377 --> 01:22:06,586
It is true that the first planting lost 60%.

933
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:10,420
In the second, 40.

934
01:22:10,545 --> 01:22:15,087
There were no books to teach to replant an Atlantic forest.

935
01:22:34,588 --> 01:22:36,545
I love coming here

936
01:22:37,089 --> 01:22:39,838
to see all these trees together.

937
01:22:40,089 --> 01:22:42,462
When you see this forest mass,

938
01:22:43,504 --> 01:22:47,463
an idea of ​​the effort involved in planting all this is done.

939
01:22:51,381 --> 01:22:53,046
When I was little,

940
01:22:53,380 --> 01:22:56,004
there was a small waterfall.

941
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,797
All year, here was a waterfall that fell.

942
01:22:59,923 --> 01:23:04,754
I came with my sisters and we made a picnic under the jump.

943
01:23:05,589 --> 01:23:08,047
There was still a lot of forest.

944
01:23:08,423 --> 01:23:09,546
Then

945
01:23:10,006 --> 01:23:13,547
when felled trees, the water disappeared.

946
01:23:14,631 --> 01:23:17,964
Now our forest is young, needs lots of water.

947
01:23:19,923 --> 01:23:24,255
But within 10 or 15 years, when everything stabilizes,

948
01:23:24,381 --> 01:23:28,505
I'm sure it will reappear another beautiful waterfall.

949
01:23:50,381 --> 01:23:51,549
They are

950
01:23:52,592 --> 01:23:54,756
many small roads,

951
01:23:54,882 --> 01:23:57,299
hundreds of small ways ...

952
01:23:58,008 --> 01:23:59,882
Cows go there.

953
01:24:00,757 --> 01:24:05,132
Each leg of cow that sits on a small perimeter,

954
01:24:05,258 --> 01:24:08,591
They are 200 or 250 kilos of blow.

955
01:24:08,717 --> 01:24:12,216
Crushes the earth, the dry,

956
01:24:12,343 --> 01:24:14,216
and no longer sprout again nothing.

957
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,674
It is very interesting to note the difference

958
01:24:18,342 --> 01:24:22,925
of what it was before the Terra Institute, smooth pastures like this

959
01:24:23,051 --> 01:24:26,341
and the other a fully recovered ecosystem.

960
01:24:26,467 --> 01:24:28,800
With ten million trees replanted.

961
01:24:51,010 --> 01:24:52,176
Here we see

962
01:24:52,427 --> 01:24:57,094
cicada singing until he dies.

963
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:01,260
I'm sure it was not the tree.

964
01:25:01,386 --> 01:25:05,134
Are the termites that are assimilating.

965
01:25:05,261 --> 01:25:07,259
He will be buried here.

966
01:25:16,510 --> 01:25:21,219
Sometimes, just we look at a tree and think about its verticality, in its beauty.

967
01:25:21,345 --> 01:25:26,635
But everything depends on it, our water, our oxygen ...

968
01:25:26,761 --> 01:25:28,678
It is home to everyone.

969
01:25:29,136 --> 01:25:32,094
Ants, small insects, cicadas ...

970
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:33,636
All are in the tree.

971
01:25:34,886 --> 01:25:39,219
It is very pleasant to touch a tree planting have helped.

972
01:25:39,637 --> 01:25:43,177
It is here, well established, well robust.

973
01:25:43,386 --> 01:25:46,761
Within 30 years it will be as well.

974
01:25:47,013 --> 01:25:49,845
He is still very young, is growing.

975
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:54,304
Look, the youngest there, very young, here.

976
01:25:54,430 --> 01:25:56,261
They may have erupted tonight,

977
01:25:57,137 --> 01:26:00,220
like Alice entering the wonderland.

978
01:26:00,887 --> 01:26:05,928
And most incredible is that it will become a tree 40 to 50 meters.

979
01:26:06,054 --> 01:26:09,137
And who will live 400 years, 500 years.

980
01:26:09,263 --> 01:26:11,762
Here there is a great power.

981
01:26:16,347 --> 01:26:20,637
Think that these trees have three months

982
01:26:20,763 --> 01:26:23,096
and will reach its climax at the 400 ...

983
01:26:24,389 --> 01:26:28,929
Maybe we can measure from here

984
01:26:29,055 --> 01:26:31,222
the concept of eternity.

985
01:26:31,515 --> 01:26:33,888
Perhaps eternity can be measured.

986
01:26:36,848 --> 01:26:39,722
The first few days after saying: "We will plant a forest"

987
01:26:39,849 --> 01:26:44,763
I thought the route was a seed to a small tree, a plant ...

988
01:26:44,889 --> 01:26:48,055
and that's it, but there is only a little plant, but a million.

989
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:51,138
And not just here.

990
01:26:51,265 --> 01:26:55,055
Also nearby. And more and more!

991
01:26:55,181 --> 01:26:58,515
And that's the most wonderful thing, this idea

992
01:27:00,557 --> 01:27:02,765
You may evolve, it can grow.

993
01:27:02,891 --> 01:27:06,139
He's not someone's idea, but of all.

994
01:27:08,016 --> 01:27:11,723
Sampling method can replicate almost everywhere.

995
01:27:11,849 --> 01:27:14,140
Of course, the species are not the same,

996
01:27:14,266 --> 01:27:17,015
but the way of acting is the same

997
01:27:17,599 --> 01:27:19,557
in all tropical forests.

998
01:27:32,767 --> 01:27:36,015
The land was the remedy to despair of Sebastião.

999
01:27:36,308 --> 01:27:41,057
The joy of seeing the trees grow, resurgent outbreaks,

1000
01:27:41,476 --> 01:27:46,766
He resurrected Sebastião passion for photography.

1001
01:27:47,266 --> 01:27:52,225
Although Lélia and he knew they could not return to their old ways.

1002
01:27:52,643 --> 01:27:54,141
We conclude

1003
01:27:54,267 --> 01:27:57,975
that would start a new photographic project on the environment.

1004
01:27:58,184 --> 01:28:01,351
Of course, the first idea that came

1005
01:28:01,477 --> 01:28:04,267
It was to denounce the destruction of forests,

1006
01:28:04,392 --> 01:28:06,851
or pollution of the oceans,

1007
01:28:07,102 --> 01:28:07,891
He did not care.

1008
01:28:08,017 --> 01:28:11,975
Then gradually we start thinking. Let's do a different project.

1009
01:28:12,643 --> 01:28:14,767
Let a tribute to the planet.

1010
01:28:15,143 --> 01:28:17,684
And we discover with surprise

1011
01:28:17,810 --> 01:28:20,642
nearly half of the planet

1012
01:28:21,185 --> 01:28:23,184
continues as the day of Genesis.

1013
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:30,517
Many of my friends told me. "Do not get into that.

1014
01:28:30,643 --> 01:28:34,392
It is very risky. You are a good human, social photographer,

1015
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:38,143
and now you will enter in the field

1016
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:42,268
Photographers landscapes, animals. "

1017
01:28:42,395 --> 01:28:44,768
I said, "It's okay, I'm going for it!

1018
01:28:44,894 --> 01:28:48,393
I will learn to photograph these things too. "

1019
01:28:48,519 --> 01:28:50,435
And so I began the first story.

1020
01:28:50,979 --> 01:28:53,393
Galapagos wanted it.

1021
01:28:53,728 --> 01:28:58,519
Darwin wanted to understand what he understood.

1022
01:28:59,562 --> 01:29:01,144
The same species,

1023
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:04,436
in very different ecosystems,

1024
01:29:04,562 --> 01:29:06,853
They have evolved very differently.

1025
01:29:09,396 --> 01:29:12,562
Looking at this detail of the leg of the iguana,

1026
01:29:12,688 --> 01:29:15,687
I can not help thinking

1027
01:29:16,187 --> 01:29:19,186
in the hand of a warrior of the Middle Ages.

1028
01:29:19,437 --> 01:29:23,270
With its metal to protect shells.

1029
01:29:26,438 --> 01:29:28,395
Looking at the structure of the hand,

1030
01:29:28,521 --> 01:29:32,271
I see that the iguana is also my cousin,

1031
01:29:32,813 --> 01:29:35,563
who we come from the same cell.

1032
01:29:38,938 --> 01:29:43,145
We were facing a being of this age.

1033
01:29:43,271 --> 01:29:45,063
We are dealing with an authority,

1034
01:29:45,189 --> 01:29:47,980
with all its wrinkles, with all this knowledge.

1035
01:29:48,730 --> 01:29:54,231
Certainly, when Darwin was here, that turtle was an adult.

1036
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:57,105
Maybe he saw Darwin. Who knows?

1037
01:29:59,939 --> 01:30:02,021
I remember one time I was very tired

1038
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:07,480
because he had walked through lava fields for a long time.

1039
01:30:07,607 --> 01:30:09,689
I had slept on the beach.

1040
01:30:10,564 --> 01:30:13,521
I felt something touch my leg.

1041
01:30:13,647 --> 01:30:16,314
I looked and it was a sea lion.

1042
01:30:16,732 --> 01:30:18,730
Had another installed across.

1043
01:30:18,856 --> 01:30:21,232
In the end, there were three sea lions.

1044
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:26,106
No man considered a predator, did not seem a threat.

1045
01:30:28,441 --> 01:30:31,189
It was my first story of nature,

1046
01:30:31,315 --> 01:30:34,607
the first time photographing animals.

1047
01:30:38,191 --> 01:30:41,898
For 8 years, I had time to see ...

1048
01:30:43,566 --> 01:30:45,607
and understand the most important thing.

1049
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:49,607
I am very nature as a turtle, like a tree,

1050
01:30:49,733 --> 01:30:51,274
like a stone.

1051
01:32:08,278 --> 01:32:10,526
His gaze remains extraordinary.

1052
01:32:13,445 --> 01:32:15,361
It is very deep.

1053
01:32:15,694 --> 01:32:18,527
I was up to me, I took a picture,

1054
01:32:18,653 --> 01:32:20,068
he put his finger in the mouth ...

1055
01:32:20,778 --> 01:32:24,276
He was looking for the first time in a mirror.

1056
01:32:24,402 --> 01:32:26,152
I was in front of him

1057
01:32:26,278 --> 01:32:29,152
and he removed his finger, put it.

1058
01:32:29,278 --> 01:32:31,070
He began to understand that it was him.

1059
01:32:31,196 --> 01:32:36,570
It was acknowledging his image. I felt completely identified.

1060
01:32:50,988 --> 01:32:53,070
It's a family like ours,

1061
01:32:53,196 --> 01:32:56,237
a grandfather, a father, children.

1062
01:32:58,696 --> 01:33:01,820
They will respect each other, you know?

1063
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:06,821
And when you go, you have to respect their ways.

1064
01:33:06,946 --> 01:33:09,613
You have to sit in a particular way,

1065
01:33:09,739 --> 01:33:12,530
you have to respect their territory.

1066
01:33:12,655 --> 01:33:15,113
And then you receive.

1067
01:33:16,947 --> 01:33:20,071
I also became friends with a whale.

1068
01:33:25,323 --> 01:33:26,655
These are whales.

1069
01:33:28,198 --> 01:33:29,447
In Argentina.

1070
01:33:32,198 --> 01:33:35,822
An adult as this measures 35 meters and weighs 40 tons, more or less.

1071
01:33:37,072 --> 01:33:39,322
He was approaching, came to the ship.

1072
01:33:39,449 --> 01:33:41,572
I could touch it.

1073
01:33:41,698 --> 01:33:44,364
And it was amazing. That skin so sensitive!

1074
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:46,030
While he is stroking,

1075
01:33:46,156 --> 01:33:50,572
He saw his tail shaking, at 35 meters.

1076
01:33:50,698 --> 01:33:52,115
A phenomenal sensitivity.

1077
01:33:52,949 --> 01:33:57,072
We had a small vessel of not more than seven meters.

1078
01:33:57,824 --> 01:34:00,448
I knew that if we looked strong, we could sink.

1079
01:34:00,574 --> 01:34:03,322
But he never touched the boat, never!

1080
01:34:03,449 --> 01:34:06,491
Sometimes he walked away and hit the sea with its tail.

1081
01:34:50,409 --> 01:34:55,075
Oh, it's another world, it's incredible.

1082
01:34:55,201 --> 01:34:59,908
I'll see if I have another photo here of the Nenets.

1083
01:35:01,077 --> 01:35:04,909
Check what does a Nenets.

1084
01:35:06,493 --> 01:35:07,868
It's your house.

1085
01:35:12,369 --> 01:35:16,118
I nenets this report with what was preparing a long time.

1086
01:35:17,077 --> 01:35:21,284
Were 18 people and about 6,000 reindeer

1087
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:23,910
They are living in constant migration.

1088
01:35:25,744 --> 01:35:28,743
Here should be the 7pm.

1089
01:35:28,869 --> 01:35:31,994
About 8 light a fire

1090
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:34,910
and make the only hot meal of the day.

1091
01:35:35,786 --> 01:35:39,160
After dinner, there are gatherings.

1092
01:35:39,286 --> 01:35:40,744
And the fire goes out.

1093
01:35:40,870 --> 01:35:46,619
While the fire burning is the temperature is pleasant: 15-20 degrees.

1094
01:35:46,952 --> 01:35:49,578
Two hours later, it is already 30 below zero.

1095
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:56,119
They are real cowboys of Siberia.

1096
01:35:56,245 --> 01:35:58,870
Always wear ties

1097
01:35:58,996 --> 01:36:02,161
around the neck, made of reindeer skin.

1098
01:36:03,121 --> 01:36:07,911
They wear leather boots with silver fox.

1099
01:36:08,621 --> 01:36:12,246
Sleep with their boots. A boot lasts a lifetime.

1100
01:36:27,496 --> 01:36:30,704
The Obi is a very special river,

1101
01:36:30,831 --> 01:36:32,786
a large river in Siberia.

1102
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:37,412
This is about 47 kilometers long.

1103
01:36:40,373 --> 01:36:44,622
When you pass the Obi, you enter the Arctic Circle.

1104
01:36:46,706 --> 01:36:49,122
We have no horizon line, we have nothing.

1105
01:36:49,248 --> 01:36:53,997
We are on a white plate on the size of the universe.

1106
01:37:05,998 --> 01:37:09,414
Genesis made Sebastião again travel the world

1107
01:37:09,789 --> 01:37:11,288
for nearly a decade.

1108
01:37:11,957 --> 01:37:16,582
It was to show nature, animals, places and people

1109
01:37:16,706 --> 01:37:19,539
They are living as the beginning of time.

1110
01:37:19,665 --> 01:37:22,248
A more optimistic view of the same planet

1111
01:37:22,374 --> 01:37:27,498
Sebastião had looked hurt and destroyed.

1112
01:37:29,083 --> 01:37:31,998
Genesis was to be his great work.

1113
01:37:32,125 --> 01:37:34,374
A love letter to the planet.

1114
01:37:49,749 --> 01:37:52,831
Zo'é had representations in writings of the sixteenth century Jesuits

1115
01:37:52,958 --> 01:37:56,416
Amazon coming and reported on a people

1116
01:37:56,542 --> 01:37:59,624
who wore a kind of tube in the lower lip.

1117
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:02,999
These Indians never been seen.

1118
01:38:03,125 --> 01:38:05,458
We thought it was a fable

1119
01:38:05,584 --> 01:38:07,875
or an invention of the Jesuits,

1120
01:38:08,001 --> 01:38:10,416
until the end of the forties,

1121
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:12,958
when we contacted them again.

1122
01:38:13,542 --> 01:38:17,666
Estado de Paré, Brasil Tribe Zoe, 2009

1123
01:39:42,837 --> 01:39:45,212
These Indians live in paradise.

1124
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:48,629
The only place I've seen in my life

1125
01:39:48,755 --> 01:39:51,962
where women have 3, 4 or 5 husbands

1126
01:39:52,546 --> 01:39:55,087
and many other women's husbands.

1127
01:39:56,380 --> 01:39:58,420
The woman has a husband hunter,

1128
01:39:58,922 --> 01:40:00,587
un fisherman husband,

1129
01:40:01,088 --> 01:40:04,545
a husband who works a little agriculture

1130
01:40:04,755 --> 01:40:08,920
a husband who is close to home and helps you do all ...

1131
01:40:09,131 --> 01:40:11,463
Women have tremendous power.

1132
01:40:11,589 --> 01:40:15,421
Have dominion over from men,

1133
01:40:15,547 --> 01:40:17,170
bastante considerable.

1134
01:40:49,923 --> 01:40:54,131
Something that has always seemed very interesting to these peoples

1135
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:58,131
It is that the people had a full awareness of their image.

1136
01:40:58,757 --> 01:41:00,757
When I was going to take a picture,

1137
01:41:01,383 --> 01:41:05,215
the person knew I was going to represent your image

1138
01:41:06,217 --> 01:41:09,423
At first they were somewhat interested, then let them be interested.

1139
01:41:11,008 --> 01:41:13,048
It was not his world.

1140
01:41:13,258 --> 01:41:16,632
However, I was very interested in my knife.

1141
01:41:16,924 --> 01:41:21,548
YPO my friend made me swear I'd give my knife.

1142
01:41:21,674 --> 01:41:23,966
But the head of the FNI

1143
01:41:24,425 --> 01:41:28,008
had made me promise not to give them anything,

1144
01:41:28,134 --> 01:41:31,383
to protect the purity of these Indians.

1145
01:41:32,009 --> 01:41:34,258
I said, "Look, we make a deal.

1146
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:39,091
The day that you go and strip the knife out the window of the plane.

1147
01:41:39,217 --> 01:41:41,759
I will follow the path of the plane

1148
01:41:41,885 --> 01:41:43,799
and I find the knife. "

1149
01:42:02,134 --> 01:42:04,510
These plants are very old.

1150
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:07,468
They are between 40 and 50 years.

1151
01:42:11,927 --> 01:42:14,134
The wonderful plants ...

1152
01:42:15,176 --> 01:42:16,675
ferns.

1153
01:42:16,844 --> 01:42:21,093
A shade plant, which grows in the middle of the jungle,

1154
01:42:21,261 --> 01:42:23,510
in the highest parts, here.

1155
01:42:24,995 --> 01:42:27,010
Hair reminds me of my mother.

1156
01:42:27,137 --> 01:42:29,760
My mother was a beautiful woman. Lot.

1157
01:42:32,594 --> 01:42:35,176
Those were your plants. When she died,

1158
01:42:36,303 --> 01:42:39,177
my father cared for him until he died.

1159
01:42:39,302 --> 01:42:41,635
After the we brought us.

1160
01:42:47,512 --> 01:42:49,220
Look, it's raining.

1161
01:42:49,595 --> 01:42:50,676
How pretty.

1162
01:43:09,013 --> 01:43:12,928
That land is very important to us.

1163
01:43:13,471 --> 01:43:16,803
We are closing a cycle with this land

1164
01:43:17,513 --> 01:43:21,179
and during that cycle she spent our lives.

1165
01:43:21,305 --> 01:43:22,970
He spent the lives of my parents,

1166
01:43:23,701 --> 01:43:26,034
step the life of my sisters,

1167
01:43:26,388 --> 01:43:29,303
and much of my life.

1168
01:43:29,555 --> 01:43:34,388
And now turn to add our lives to this.

1169
01:43:34,514 --> 01:43:36,263
My life and Leila again.

1170
01:43:37,514 --> 01:43:39,846
It remains our history.

1171
01:43:39,972 --> 01:43:43,804
It was part of my childhood and now it is my old age.

1172
01:43:44,015 --> 01:43:45,304
And the day I die,

1173
01:43:45,430 --> 01:43:51,054
We leave here the forest there was a bit before my time.

1174
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:54,472
Therefore, you will complete a cycle.

1175
01:43:54,765 --> 01:43:56,930
It's the story of my life.

1176
01:44:18,474 --> 01:44:21,431
The man whose photographs have told us

1177
01:44:21,557 --> 01:44:23,640
thousands of stories about our planet,

1178
01:44:23,766 --> 01:44:25,973
It leaves us a great history and a great dream:

1179
01:44:26,099 --> 01:44:28,181
the destruction of nature can be reversed.

1180
01:44:31,266 --> 01:44:36,057
More than a thousand fountains watering again "Terra Institute".

1181
01:44:36,183 --> 01:44:39,431
There are already planted 2.5 million trees.

1182
01:44:39,557 --> 01:44:42,098
The wildlife has returned, even jaguars.

1183
01:44:44,141 --> 01:44:47,432
The earth is no longer possession of Salgado,

1184
01:44:47,558 --> 01:44:49,849
now a national park that belongs to everyone.

1185
01:44:49,975 --> 01:44:53,974
Is the demonstration that devastated lands anywhere

1186
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:56,307
they can return to forest.
