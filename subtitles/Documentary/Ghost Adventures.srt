Bong Pal, are you okay?

7
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,038
Monk Myung Chul.

- Monk Myung Chul.

13

I can't breathe.

15
00:02:14,249 --> 00:02:16,352
Help me up.

16
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:30,463
Let's see that punk.

17
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,481
Goodness, this rascal.
The gods have looked kindly upon him.

18
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,791
He's still breathing.

19
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:53,563
Goodness, you suffered a lot too.

20
00:02:53,564 --> 00:02:57,362

23
00:03:31,408 --> 00:03:33,058
Good job.

24
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:02,423
Let's go, Mr. Joo Hye Sung. Let's go.

25
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:29,421
Monk.

26
00:04:30,582 --> 00:04:32,853
What is going to happen to
Professor Joo Hye Sung now?

27
00:04:32,854 --> 00:04:36,594
In some ways, he's a victim too.

28
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:41,916
In our eyes, yes. But to normal
people, he is just a murderer.

29
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:47,017
An evil spirit took over his body because
he had hatred in his heart at the start.

30
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:51,010
You can't overlook that crime.

31
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:54,460
Oh dear Buddha.

32
00:05:03,188 --> 00:05:07,832
I'm going to go home and get some rest.
You take Hyun Ji home.

33
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:09,455
Yes.

34
00:05:09,457 --> 00:05:12,308
I'll see you later.

35
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,334
Hyun Ji!

36
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:39,249
Let me look at you! Are you okay?

37
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,031
You're not hurt anywhere?

38
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:43,282
I'm okay.

39
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:49,142
- Dad.
- Let's go inside.

40
00:05:49,144 --> 00:05:54,903
Young man, I clearly told you that
I do not like you seeing Hyun Ji.

41
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:57,253
She's been in danger twice
already because of you.

42
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,813
- What if she got hurt?
- I'm sorry.

43
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:04,101
Mom, stop. Bong Pal did nothing wrong.

44
00:06:04,103 --> 00:06:07,517
Go inside the house with your dad.
Take her inside.

45
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,236
- Mom.
- Honey.

46
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:13,015
Let's go, Hyun Ji.

47
00:06:24,796 --> 00:06:28,733
We're going to leave here tomorrow.

48
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:32,194
If you have feelings for
Hyun Ji, then end it here.

49
00:06:32,195 --> 00:06:34,856
It's best for both of you.

50
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,301
I believe you understand me.

51
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,287
Ma'am.

52
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:54,193
Please give this to Hyun Ji.

53
00:06:58,693 --> 00:07:00,921
Please.

54
00:07:17,332 --> 00:07:19,015
No Hyun Joo.

55
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:22,928
Im Hyun Soo.

56
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,592
Park Ji Hoon.

57
00:07:33,274 --> 00:07:35,763
And Joo Jin Myung.

58
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:41,899
You remember these people, right?

59
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:47,233
Mr. Joo Hye Sung.

60
00:07:58,517 --> 00:08:00,323
Yes.

61
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,854
I remember.

62
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:32,666
I killed them.

63
00:08:38,657 --> 00:08:40,623
I...

64
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,253
killed all these people.

65
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:10,253
Hye Sung.

66
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:27,067
Hye Sung.

67
00:09:58,886 --> 00:10:01,809
- You're home.
- Yes.

68
00:10:06,854 --> 00:10:08,979
Is it okay to drink when you're injured?

69
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,911
There's no medicine for
getting beaten by a ghost.

70
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,734
Alcohol is the best
to overcome the pain.

71
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,807
There's no food either.

72
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:20,748
Just wait a little bit.

73
00:10:24,814 --> 00:10:26,623
Thanks.

74
00:10:28,642 --> 00:10:31,600
Gosh, this looks good.

75
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:40,042
Wow, you really know how to cook.

76
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,746
Is Hyun Ji leaving?

77
00:10:45,498 --> 00:10:48,146
Yes, she's leaving tomorrow.

78
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,440
I see. It's time for everyone
to go back to their normal lives.

79
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:54,324
You must be sad.

80
00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:57,051
- No, I'm fine.
- Good.

81
00:10:57,052 --> 00:11:01,175
It's not like distance is going
to break you two apart, right?

82
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:04,330
On days like this,
let's drink up and go to bed.

83
00:11:07,498 --> 00:11:10,003
Oh goodness.

84
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:18,162
This is nice.

85
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,878
Why did you do it? I know it wasn't you.

86
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:35,036
- Let's talk to the detective again...
- I did it.

87
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:42,232
The crimes I committed in my heart are
bigger than the ones I physically did.

88
00:11:44,863 --> 00:11:47,816
If I didn't have those bad
intentions in my heart back then...

89
00:11:49,282 --> 00:11:51,849
It wouldn't have come to be like this.

90
00:11:56,571 --> 00:11:58,466
My hand...

91
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:02,959
I killed those people in my heart.

92
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:06,835
That fact will never change.

93
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:08,761
- Hye Sung.
- And...

94
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:13,363
don't ever come here
again. If you see my face...

95
00:12:14,628 --> 00:12:17,247
It will only give you pain.

96
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:24,291
No, it's not true.

97
00:12:24,865 --> 00:12:26,963
I'm going to come every day.

98
00:12:26,964 --> 00:12:29,612
I'm going to come and see you.

99
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:32,759
I'm going to keep coming
until you forgive me.

100
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:36,021
I'm going to come even
if you refuse to see me.

101
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:39,932
I'm going to come every day to see you.

102
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,088
- What's Hyun Ji doing?
- She's talking in her room.

103
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:21,713
With who?

104
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:25,762
- I swear.
- Leave her alone. It's the last time.

105
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:36,194
I'm leaving today.

106
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:38,554
Our stuff is all packed and ready to go.

107
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:43,355
Bong Pal.

108
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:46,737
I hope you understand why Mom did that.

109
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:48,449
<i>I completely understand.</i>

110
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,672
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

111
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:54,184
- Thanks.
- <i>Study hard down there.</i>

112
00:13:54,185 --> 00:13:59,606
- <i>That way we'll be able to meet quickly.</i>
- I will.

113
00:13:59,607 --> 00:14:01,917
<i>Hyun Ji, let's go.</i>

114
00:14:02,647 --> 00:14:04,570
I have to go now.

115
00:14:43,575 --> 00:14:46,042
Hyun Ji, get in.

116
00:14:46,739 --> 00:14:47,839
Okay.

117
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:24,631
<i>I don't want to go.</i>

118
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,208
<i>I want to be with you.</i>

119
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:29,487
I don't want to send you off either.

120
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:31,523
Why aren't you here to see me?

121
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:34,583
I don't know when we'll
see each other again.

122
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:39,127
- Don't you miss me?
- I do miss you.

123
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:46,681
But I'm afraid I won't be able
to let you go if I see you.

124
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:49,892
- Bong Pal.
- <i>Hyun Ji.</i>

125
00:15:49,893 --> 00:15:55,249
<i>I want you to get back to your
normal life as soon as possible.</i>

126
00:15:56,103 --> 00:15:59,017
I don't want you to put
anything off because of me.

127
00:15:59,018 --> 00:16:04,948
<i>We'll be apart for now, but we can always
be together once you come to college.</i>

128
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:10,778
Once that happens, let's formally ask
for your mother's permission to date.

129
00:16:13,526 --> 00:16:18,310
I know it'll be hard...
but let's look forward to that day.

130
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,498
<i>Let's be patient and wait.</i>

131
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:23,271
Okay, I will.

132
00:16:26,004 --> 00:16:28,943
Take care of yourself until then.

133
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:58,473
This is how you're supposed
to eat a lettuce wrap.

134
00:17:13,142 --> 00:17:14,567
Where's my phone?

135
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:17,604
Hello?

Yes, this is the 24-hour exorcism

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,997
- That way what?
- You know what I'm talking about.

164
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:03,083
So what is it?

165

- You really don't know?
- I don't know.

166
00:21:05,191 --> 00:21:08,566
Is that right? Then you're
going to live alone forever.

167
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,393
Why should I live alone?

168
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,587
I'm going to live with you.

<i>After four years.</i>

170
00:21:14,061 --> 00:21:15,480
Why after four years?

171
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:18,708
By then, I'll have a stable career.

172
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:22,688
You'll be graduating about
that time, so it's perfect.

00:21:33,975 --> 00:21:36,960
- March fifth.
- That's coming up soon.

178
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:38,814
You're going to be busy.

179
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:43,588
How am I going to wait another year?

180
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,431
It'll pass soon enough.

the value of the property...

Okay, that's all for class today.

Here are the designated groups.
Take a look before you leave.

Good job on your first day of class.

It's just the two of us.
Who else would it be?

You have to be the next

Isn't this
a blood sausage soup restaurant?

238

I wanted a bowl of it to go.

No... it's not.

Why are you MIA lately?
Did you pass out the flyers?

251
00:26:19,883 --> 00:26:21,963
I did. I did pass the flyers out

252
00:26:21,965 --> 00:26:24,785
but I think we need to
hire a part-time employee.

253
00:26:24,786 --> 00:26:26,815
It's kind of hard doing
this all by myself.

254
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:28,245
A part-time employee?

How can that just easily
come out of your mouth?

I told you to cut off
meals at 5,500 won!

261
00:26:45,818 --> 00:26:47,191
5,500 won meals are hard to find.

262
00:26:47,192 --> 00:26:49,237
I just ate one for 5,000 won!

263
00:26:49,238 --> 00:26:51,946
We will never be able to pay
my grandma back at this rate!

264
00:26:51,947 --> 00:26:55,461
I got this investment because I believed
in you! You said it would be a hit!

265
00:26:55,462 --> 00:26:57,093
You said we could pay
it all back in a month.

266
00:26:57,094 --> 00:27:02,572
The thing is, if you look at the way
the economy is doing these days...

267
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:08,207
What about new freshman recruits?

268
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,748

Still?

270
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:18,768
We received a grant from the school
and we still have no new members?

271
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:23,545
We're going to jail
if the school finds out.

272

- Clean?
- Go ahead and start.

277
00:27:44,188 --> 00:27:46,324
You want me to clean?

278
00:27:46,325 --> 00:27:48,295
I'm the CEO.

279
00:27:48,296 --> 00:27:51,305
I have to do all the dirty work just
because you got the investment money.

280
00:27:51,306 --> 00:27:54,122
Yeah, I don't blame you
for rubbing it in my face.

281
00:27:54,123 --> 00:27:55,805
- Do we have coffee?
- Yes, we do.

282
00:27:55,806 --> 00:27:59,266
- How do you want it?
- Just black.

283
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:03,722
- Goodness, it's been a long time.
- Yes, Monk Myung Chul.

284
00:28:04,844 --> 00:28:07,980
I hope I'm not late.

285
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:11,523
The thing is, I've been
trying to get a hold of you

286
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:12,964
and you're not answering your phone.

287
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:16,944
Is there something going on?

288
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:22,386
The shamaness has told us that your
prayers and energy have no effect at all.

289
00:28:22,388 --> 00:28:26,355
Which shamaness is going around
saying such nonsense about me?

290
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:29,049
What do you mean nonsense?

291
00:28:45,504 --> 00:28:48,049
Why are you here?

292
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:54,538
Why can't you cross
over to the afterlife?

293
00:28:55,585 --> 00:28:59,713
Believe. Redeem your sorry soul!

294
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:11,667
Who is this pitiful-looking man?

295
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:13,394
Get rid of him.

296
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:20,065
What is this?

297
00:29:20,066 --> 00:29:21,893
She's from Daeryong Mountain.

298
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:23,723
She calls herself
the 1,000-year-old virgin shamaness.

299

A virgin shamaness?

300
00:29:25,438 --> 00:29:28,680
Why are there so many?
She's not a virgin shamaness!

301
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:30,341
She's just a con artist!

302
00:29:31,139 --> 00:29:35,475
You insolent fool! Leave immediately!

303
00:29:35,476 --> 00:29:39,492
You have no credentials or pedigree!
How dare you con these good people!

I can't believe you dragged this
good-for-nothing monk into the house!

306
00:29:46,716 --> 00:29:50,528
I'm a great and honorable
monk who catches evil spirits!

307
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:53,986
Leave if you're done! How dare you
impersonate a shamaness, you fake.

308
00:29:53,987 --> 00:29:57,095
Fake? Fake?

00:30:32,218 --> 00:30:34,228
Why did you push her?

318
00:30:34,229 --> 00:30:36,700
I didn't push her.

319
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,594
This woman couldn't control her
anger and she tripped and fell.

320
00:30:39,595 --> 00:30:41,689
She says she's a virgin shamaness.

321
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,969
Please check and see.
I think this woman is a fraud.

322
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:51,341
Why do you keep hitting me, woman?

323
00:30:52,468 --> 00:30:56,267
Stop her! She's attacking me!

324
00:30:57,097 --> 00:30:59,489
Calm down!

325
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:03,610
Have we met before?
You look familiar.

326
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,401
- I go to church.
- Hallelujah?

327
00:31:05,402 --> 00:31:06,701
Amen.

328
00:31:07,807 --> 00:31:10,033
Stop her!

329
00:31:12,411 --> 00:31:14,456
- Senior.
- Senior.

330
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:16,020
Where are you going?

331
00:31:16,021 --> 00:31:18,913
- I'm going home.
- Don't go home.

332
00:31:18,914 --> 00:31:21,555
There's the freshman
welcome party today.

333
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:22,931
Ah.

334
00:31:22,932 --> 00:31:25,670
- I'm not interested in those events.
- No, you have to go.

335
00:31:25,671 --> 00:31:28,266
You have to be there.

336
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:30,650
- Please go.
- Let's go together.

337
00:31:30,651 --> 00:31:32,881
Senior, let's go.

338
00:31:33,402 --> 00:31:35,269
Let's go.

339
00:31:36,006 --> 00:31:37,798
Are all the drinks poured?

340
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:41,106
- Do you all have drinks or not?
- We do!

341
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,694
It's rare to drink with us seniors!

342
00:31:43,696 --> 00:31:46,374
Economy major cheer on
the count of three, got it?

343
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:48,025
- Yes!
- One, two, three!

344
00:31:48,026 --> 00:31:50,604
Economy major!

345
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,759
There is a really pretty freshman
girl who got admitted this year.

346
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,198
I saw her too. She's totally hot.

347
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:02,456
Hello, I'm economy major
Kim Ji Eun, class of 2018.

348
00:32:02,457 --> 00:32:04,749
Please take good care of me.

349
00:32:06,261 --> 00:32:10,624
Hello, I'm economy major...

350
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:13,586
- She's so cute.
- Please take good care of me.

351
00:32:15,414 --> 00:32:18,558
Hello, I'm economy major
Lee Dong Min, class of 2018.

352
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,981
It's my goal to become
the Adam Smith of Korea. Thank you.

353
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:28,867
Hello, Seniors. I'm economy
major Kim Hyun Ji, class of 2018.

354
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:30,874
I'd appreciate your guidance.

355
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:32,619
Hey, she's the one!

356
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:36,216
- I have a question.
- Yes?

357
00:32:36,217 --> 00:32:38,523
By any chance, do you have a boyfriend?

358
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:46,296
Yes, he's here.

359
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,855
He's here?

360
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:02,698
Why did you lie about not passing?

361
00:33:02,699 --> 00:33:06,258
I did it on purpose
so I could surprise you.

362
00:33:06,874 --> 00:33:10,343
I had no idea. I was wondering how
I was going to wait another year.

363
00:33:10,344 --> 00:33:11,869
You said it'll pass soon enough.

364
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,888
I didn't mean it.

365
00:33:15,485 --> 00:33:18,500
But where are you staying?

366
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:20,590
At my uncle's.
It's close to your place too.

367
00:33:20,591 --> 00:33:22,569
Really? Good.

368
00:33:24,162 --> 00:33:27,109
- Aren't you happy to see me?
- Of course.

369
00:33:28,246 --> 00:33:31,650
From now on, I'm going
to stick to you like glue.

370
00:33:31,651 --> 00:33:34,390
You better be good to me from now on.

371
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:36,388
- Older sister?
- Of course, I'm older than you.

372
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,008
You're one year younger than me.

373
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:41,538
Older sister, my butt.

374
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,532
Let's get the nicknames out of the way.

375
00:33:44,533 --> 00:33:47,484
Bong Pal, repeat after me.

376
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:49,614
Older sister.

377
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:51,918
No.

378
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,666
You better listen to me.
One more time. "Older sister."

379
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:59,200
- Forget it.
- Why? Just say it once, okay?

380
00:33:59,201 --> 00:34:00,892
Older sister. Older sister.

381
00:34:00,893 --> 00:34:03,152
- No, I don't want to!
- Say "older sister"!

382
00:34:03,154 --> 00:34:05,100
Just say it this once. Please?

383
00:34:15,337 --> 00:34:18,698
- Now go in.
- Okay.

384
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,908
- Good night.
- Good night.

385
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,685
- What's the matter?
- I just like you so much.

386
00:34:52,582 --> 00:34:54,446
I like you a lot too.

387
00:35:02,263 --> 00:35:05,202
- Go in now.
- All right.

388
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,372
- Sweet dreams.
- You too.

389
00:35:25,828 --> 00:35:27,388
Hi, Monk Myung Chul.

390
00:35:33,118 --> 00:35:34,377
Hello.

391
00:35:35,038 --> 00:35:37,038
Where is Monk Myung Chul?

392
00:35:42,948 --> 00:35:44,457
Bong Pal.

393
00:35:51,488 --> 00:35:53,227
I'm sorry.

394
00:35:55,268 --> 00:35:56,746
Gosh, you're not a kid.

395
00:35:56,747 --> 00:35:58,476
How could you get into a fight, huh?

396
00:35:58,477 --> 00:36:00,827
In my field, there are
business ethics to follow.

397
00:36:00,828 --> 00:36:02,316
That shamaness didn't do it.

398
00:36:02,317 --> 00:36:04,508
That's why I... taught her a lesson.

399
00:36:05,658 --> 00:36:08,828
- Thank you. I will go now.
- Monk Myung Chul.

400
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,718
- Yes?
- Well...

401
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:15,896
You're not well and all.

402
00:36:15,897 --> 00:36:17,627
Why don't you stop working?

403
00:36:17,837 --> 00:36:20,507
Stop working and stay with me.

404
00:36:20,508 --> 00:36:22,586
- With you?
- Yes.

405
00:36:22,587 --> 00:36:25,308
Your place in the mountain
isn't very comfortable.

406
00:36:25,828 --> 00:36:27,517
I emptied the spare room.

407
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,258
Move in with me. I know it's such
a hassle to commute back and forth.

408
00:36:31,118 --> 00:36:32,456
Bong Pal.

409
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:36,127
You're the only family member I have now.

410
00:36:36,647 --> 00:36:38,127
Gosh.

411
00:36:45,027 --> 00:36:47,158
You know how to make people cry, huh?

412
00:36:49,297 --> 00:36:51,268
Do you have any sausage at home?

413
00:36:51,607 --> 00:36:55,047
On a day like this, it'll be great
to have soju and sausage.

414
00:36:57,247 --> 00:36:58,868
Let's go.

415
00:37:12,888 --> 00:37:14,468
What's wrong?

416
00:37:27,698 --> 00:37:29,158
Hyun Ji!

417
00:37:29,618 --> 00:37:31,238
Hey, Soo Jin.

418
00:37:31,678 --> 00:37:34,007
Do you have time tonight?

419
00:37:34,008 --> 00:37:35,737
What? What about tonight?

420
00:37:35,738 --> 00:37:37,947
Management department guys
asked three girls out on a blind date.

421
00:37:37,948 --> 00:37:40,357
- Can you please come with us?
- A blind date?

422
00:37:41,758 --> 00:37:44,336
Well, you know I have a boyfriend.

423
00:37:44,337 --> 00:37:47,746
We know that you're going out
with one of our seniors.

424
00:37:47,747 --> 00:37:50,706
Can you keep this from him
and come out with us this once?

425
00:37:50,707 --> 00:37:52,787
We were afraid
the guys would be a disaster.

426
00:37:52,788 --> 00:37:54,517
So we told them we'd bring
the prettiest girl in our department.

427
00:37:54,518 --> 00:37:57,226
They told me that they'd bring
the handsomest boys. Please.

428
00:37:57,227 --> 00:38:00,027
Come on, me the prettiest girl?

429
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:03,206
If Bong Pal finds out,
he will get really mad.

430
00:38:03,207 --> 00:38:05,007
Once people know you two are going out

431
00:38:05,008 --> 00:38:06,356
you will never be asked
on a blind date.

432
00:38:06,357 --> 00:38:09,667
You got into college and will graduate
without being on a blind date?

433
00:38:12,788 --> 00:38:14,957
Wow, she is really pretty.

434
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,768
With the other two,
she looks even prettier.

435
00:38:20,428 --> 00:38:23,697
Hello, I'm a freshman in
the Management department, Kim Tae Young.

436
00:38:23,698 --> 00:38:25,987
You're as pretty as we've heard.

437
00:38:25,988 --> 00:38:28,217
Really? Thank you.

438
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:30,927
What is this? Only three boys were
supposed to come meet us.

439
00:38:30,928 --> 00:38:33,847
They all begged me to come along.

440
00:38:33,848 --> 00:38:36,047
We managed to cut many others.

441
00:38:40,377 --> 00:38:41,988
Here.

442
00:38:47,488 --> 00:38:49,877
Thank you.

443
00:38:58,308 --> 00:39:00,357

449
00:39:21,848 --> 00:39:24,308
Can we go around
and introduce ourselves first?

450
00:39:25,508 --> 00:39:27,268
- Sure.
- Me first?

451
00:39:28,937 --> 00:39:30,937
What homework all of a sudden?

452
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,768
I guess I will just go then.

453
00:39:41,777 --> 00:39:44,606
Drink up! Drink up!

454
00:39:44,607 --> 00:39:48,077
Alcohol is coming. Drink up!

455
00:39:48,078 --> 00:39:49,868
It will make you want to dance.

- I can drink this.
- No way.

458
00:40:06,758 --> 00:40:09,207
- I will drink it.
- Come on.

459

463
00:40:52,238 --> 00:40:54,396
- I'm at home.
- Are you?

464
00:40:54,397 --> 00:40:57,407
Do you happen to know where Hyun Ji is?

465
00:40:57,408 --> 00:40:58,408
Hyun Ji?

466
00:40:59,377 --> 00:41:01,456
She said she's
at a café doing homework.

467
00:41:01,457 --> 00:41:03,607
Ah, she's doing her homework at a café...

468
00:41:04,598 --> 00:41:09,296
Pal, do you want to take a look

Sure.

00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:52,598
Senior Bong Pal.

477
00:41:58,897 --> 00:42:01,837
- By the way, who is this?
- Me?

478
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:07,397
I'm Hyun Ji's boyfriend.

479
00:42:17,828 --> 00:42:20,276
Bong Pal, are you really mad?

480
00:42:20,277 --> 00:42:23,717
I always wanted to
go on a blind date at college.

481
00:42:23,718 --> 00:42:25,718
Can you let it go this once, please?

482
00:42:26,788 --> 00:42:28,347
When you have a boyfriend... what?

483
00:42:28,348 --> 00:42:29,916
You went on a blind date
and you want me to let it go?

484
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:32,413
- I told them that I had a boyfriend.
- What?

485
00:42:32,437 --> 00:42:35,827
When we were introducing ourselves,
I told them I had a boyfriend.

486
00:42:35,828 --> 00:42:38,368
If you don't trust me,
go ask them.

487
00:42:38,817 --> 00:42:42,237
I just went there to feel
the craziness of college life.

488
00:42:42,238 --> 00:42:44,237
- You got into college for this, did you?
- Yes.

489
00:42:44,238 --> 00:42:46,146
- Why else?
- Oh my.

490
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,764
I was kidding.

491
00:42:48,788 --> 00:42:50,517
It took me seven years
to become a college student.

492
00:42:50,518 --> 00:42:52,186
I'm just loving it.

493
00:42:52,187 --> 00:42:55,007
I want to try everything
I haven't done before.

494
00:42:55,008 --> 00:42:57,658
So please don't be mad, Bong Pal.

495
00:43:01,308 --> 00:43:03,788
Bong Pal. Bong Bong.

496
00:43:05,928 --> 00:43:08,258
Bong Pal, please...

497
00:43:12,948 --> 00:43:15,546
I'm so sorry that I'm turning cute...

498
00:43:15,547 --> 00:43:18,307
- Gosh.
- You laughed, didn't you?

499
00:43:18,308 --> 00:43:21,127
- I did not laugh.
- Yes, you did.

500
00:43:21,538 --> 00:43:24,276
- I did not laugh.
- Come on, you so laughed.

501
00:43:24,277 --> 00:43:26,908
- Hey, you laughed.
- No, I did not.

502
00:43:31,178 --> 00:43:33,738
I hate to say goodbye.

503
00:43:35,127 --> 00:43:36,468
Me too.

504
00:43:41,598 --> 00:43:44,987
<i>Sweetie, where are you?
I'm up in Seoul now.</i>

505
00:43:44,988 --> 00:43:48,107
- <i>Come home early</i>.
- My mom must be here.

506
00:43:48,888 --> 00:43:51,617
- Bong Pal, just go.
- What?

507
00:43:51,618 --> 00:43:54,496
If my mom sees you,
she might say something.

508
00:43:54,497 --> 00:43:57,747
- Get home safe. I will go.
- Hyun Ji.

509
00:44:02,388 --> 00:44:04,327
Hey, what are you doing?

510
00:44:04,328 --> 00:44:05,967
Bong Pal, hold on.

511
00:44:05,968 --> 00:44:07,788
Bong Pal.

512
00:44:17,777 --> 00:44:21,018
- Hello.
- Hello...

513
00:44:21,207 --> 00:44:24,217
I heard you came up to Seoul.

514
00:44:24,218 --> 00:44:26,058
I wanted to come by to say hi.

515
00:44:28,187 --> 00:44:31,526
Ah, did you?

516
00:44:31,527 --> 00:44:34,518
Why don't you come in?

517
00:44:42,547 --> 00:44:46,456
By the way, isn't it too late
for you to hang out at this hour?

518
00:44:46,457 --> 00:44:49,218
Mom, please don't say anything to him.

519
00:44:50,808 --> 00:44:53,276
Did you come by because you
wanted to tell me something?

520
00:44:53,277 --> 00:44:56,868
I have a feeling that you didn't
just come by to say hi...

521
00:44:58,857 --> 00:45:00,618
Well, ma'am...

522
00:45:03,078 --> 00:45:10,134
Hyun Ji and I'd like to get
your permission to go out officially.

523
00:45:10,158 --> 00:45:15,387
Well, haven't you two been going out
without my permission all this time?

524
00:45:15,388 --> 00:45:18,726
No, we haven't seen
each other all this time.

525
00:45:18,727 --> 00:45:20,497
Can you stay out of it for now?

526
00:45:22,018 --> 00:45:24,271
Are you sincerely asking
for my permission?

527
00:45:24,272 --> 00:45:26,527
Yes.

528
00:45:26,538 --> 00:45:29,246
Then if I tell you not to see her

529
00:45:29,247 --> 00:45:31,457
will you never see her again?

530
00:45:31,727 --> 00:45:32,936
Mom.

531
00:45:32,937 --> 00:45:36,807
Honestly, I didn't have a good feeling
about you from the beginning.

532
00:45:36,808 --> 00:45:38,697
When my daughter came back
from near death

533
00:45:38,698 --> 00:45:41,456
you showed up out of nowhere
and followed her saying you liked her.

534
00:45:41,457 --> 00:45:45,377
What parents wouldn't
be suspicious to accept you?

535
00:45:46,587 --> 00:45:48,337
I understand.

536
00:46:02,087 --> 00:46:04,718
Mom, are you serious?

537
00:46:05,008 --> 00:46:08,186
- You mean it, right?
- Yes.

538
00:46:08,187 --> 00:46:09,916
You got into college
and are all grown up now.

539
00:46:09,917 --> 00:46:11,428
How can I possibly stop you?

540
00:46:11,868 --> 00:46:14,197
Well, he doesn't seem like a bad boy.

541
00:46:14,198 --> 00:46:16,086
Of course not. He's a very nice person.

542
00:46:16,087 --> 00:46:17,447
Plus, he does so well in school.

543
00:46:17,448 --> 00:46:19,996
He has a full scholarship
for all four years.

544
00:46:19,997 --> 00:46:21,996
And there aren't any sports he can't do.

545
00:46:21,997 --> 00:46:24,468
- You like him that much?
- Yes, I do like him.

546
00:46:25,638 --> 00:46:28,408
Thank you, Mom. I love you, too.

547
00:46:29,058 --> 00:46:31,086
What are you doing?
You're too big for this.

548
00:46:31,087 --> 00:46:32,758
Oh my.

549
00:46:38,917 --> 00:46:42,997
Today, Mrs. Yang
went out of her way to make this.

550
00:46:43,738 --> 00:46:45,518
Try.

551
00:46:54,598 --> 00:46:57,627
Excuse me, officer.

552
00:46:58,948 --> 00:47:00,727
Thank you.

553
00:47:15,408 --> 00:47:18,107
I made it when we had time for crafts.

554
00:47:18,689 --> 00:47:21,638
If you don't like it,
you don't have to wear it.

555
00:47:28,457 --> 00:47:30,618
I'm sorry.

556
00:47:31,277 --> 00:47:33,857
It's so pretty.

557
00:47:46,337 --> 00:47:52,868
It seems that it took us
too long to get to this point.

558
00:47:54,667 --> 00:47:56,868
I'm sorry, Hye Sung.

559
00:47:58,178 --> 00:48:00,957
Don't blame yourself anymore.

560
00:48:02,118 --> 00:48:08,738
Now I am not angry or resentful anymore.

561
00:48:16,187 --> 00:48:18,646
We can't go back

562
00:48:18,647 --> 00:48:24,187
but let's share what we couldn't before.

563
00:48:25,558 --> 00:48:27,758
Let's do that, Hye Sung.

564
00:48:34,547 --> 00:48:36,207
I will.

565
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,508
Mother.

566
00:48:58,218 --> 00:49:00,606
- Then...
- See you later.

567
00:49:00,607 --> 00:49:02,607
Sure, have a good day.

568
00:49:29,288 --> 00:49:31,517
I'm not picking this up.

569
00:49:31,518 --> 00:49:34,907
- I'm here to throw this away.
- I didn't say anything.

570
00:49:34,908 --> 00:49:37,246
I guess something is bothering you.

571
00:49:37,247 --> 00:49:39,448
What? Nothing is bothering me.

572
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,557
Now that I look at your face this way

573
00:49:58,558 --> 00:50:00,537
I see you have a face for good fortune.

574
00:50:00,538 --> 00:50:02,246
Um, do I?

575
00:50:02,247 --> 00:50:05,238
You shouldn't hurt yourself at your age.
Pleae be careful.

576
00:50:10,038 --> 00:50:11,868
Thank you.

577
00:50:19,578 --> 00:50:22,007
Oh my goodness.

578
00:50:22,008 --> 00:50:24,316
Come on.
I'm so out of your league.

579
00:50:24,317 --> 00:50:26,968
Well, he has an eye for beauty, I guess.

580
00:50:34,928 --> 00:50:38,563
Oh my, I'm sorry.

581
00:50:38,587 --> 00:50:40,127
It's okay.

582
00:50:41,848 --> 00:50:43,627
Here.

583
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:49,267
Haven't we met before?

584
00:50:49,268 --> 00:50:51,197
Do you know me?

585
00:50:51,198 --> 00:50:52,997
Se Ri!

586
00:50:55,508 --> 00:50:59,037
- Se Ri.
- Hon, what took you so long?

587
00:50:59,038 --> 00:51:01,186
I've been waiting for so long.

588
00:51:01,187 --> 00:51:03,776
I can't go out with someone
who isn't punctual.

589
00:51:03,777 --> 00:51:07,347
You're mad, aren't you?
I'm very sorry.

590
00:51:07,348 --> 00:51:10,067
- Hon, let me carry them for you.
- <i>Honey!</i>

591
00:51:10,428 --> 00:51:12,837
What is this guy doing here again?

592
00:51:14,247 --> 00:51:16,436
Honey, I was wrong.

593
00:51:16,437 --> 00:51:18,436
Please forgive me this once.

594
00:51:18,437 --> 00:51:21,307
Why won't you leave
me alone? So irritating.

595
00:51:21,308 --> 00:51:23,307
I told you that we were done.

596
00:51:23,308 --> 00:51:25,967
Why are you doing this?

597
00:51:25,968 --> 00:51:28,086
Se Ri doesn't want you.

598
00:51:28,087 --> 00:51:30,237
Because of you, she's changed.

599
00:51:30,238 --> 00:51:32,836
Why did you come on to her, huh?

600
00:51:32,837 --> 00:51:35,437
What do you mean I came on to her?

601
00:51:36,538 --> 00:51:39,997
Be a man and get lost, will you?

602
00:51:41,187 --> 00:51:43,488
- Honey.
- Se Ri.

603
00:51:46,058 --> 00:51:48,267
- Bong Pal.
- Seo Yeon.

604
00:51:48,268 --> 00:51:50,537
- Long time no see.
- It sure has been.

605
00:51:50,538 --> 00:51:52,757
I heard you got a job.

606
00:51:52,758 --> 00:51:56,496
- At a good company, I hear.
- Well, I'm just doing an internship.

607
00:51:56,497 --> 00:51:57,836
What brings you here at school?

608
00:51:57,837 --> 00:52:01,316
- I needed to get some academic papers.
- Academic papers?

609
00:52:01,317 --> 00:52:03,808
Honey, what are you doing here?

610
00:52:04,328 --> 00:52:07,376
- You're the one from last time...
- Hi, I'm his girlfriend.

611
00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:09,867
Ah, you have a girlfriend now, huh?

612
00:52:09,868 --> 00:52:11,996
- Congratulations. You two look good.
- Thank you.

613
00:52:11,997 --> 00:52:13,526
Thank you.

614
00:52:13,527 --> 00:52:16,917
- I will see you later.
- See you later.

615
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:21,788
What was that about?

616
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:25,316
Don't smile like that.
You look like a fool.

617
00:52:25,317 --> 00:52:27,027
I didn't smile.

618
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:31,776
By the way, can you call me that again?

619
00:52:31,777 --> 00:52:33,527
I don't want to.

620
00:52:35,457 --> 00:52:37,537
Hey, please.

621
00:52:37,538 --> 00:52:40,928
Hey, call me by that name again.

622
00:52:41,698 --> 00:52:44,317
Aren't you late for your class?

623
00:52:45,127 --> 00:52:47,777
I'm late. Excuse me. Sorry.

624
00:52:49,277 --> 00:52:51,777
Honey, pay attention in your class.

625
00:53:04,258 --> 00:53:07,206
How come there is
so much fat in this pork? I hate it.

626
00:53:07,207 --> 00:53:09,807
I like the stew with tuna in it.

627
00:53:09,808 --> 00:53:12,836
- Kimchi stew is better with pork in it.
- I agree. Isn't it?

628
00:53:12,837 --> 00:53:15,877
That was an insult to pork kimchi stew.

629
00:53:16,917 --> 00:53:19,987
- Kimchi stew is better with pork.
- I agree. Isn't it?

630
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,837
That was an insult to pork kimchi stew.

631
00:53:24,518 --> 00:53:25,726
When we're talking about kimchi stew

632
00:53:25,727 --> 00:53:28,468
it's obvious pork kimchi stew
is the best, isn't it?

633
00:53:28,768 --> 00:53:33,117
When the juice from the pork
meets sour and spicy kimchi

634
00:53:33,118 --> 00:53:36,037
it gives the stew deep flavor.

635
00:53:36,038 --> 00:53:39,097
- She doesn't know that, huh?
- I agree.

636
00:53:39,098 --> 00:53:41,617
Why would she throw away such good stuff?

637
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:43,456
You seem to know
about deep meat flavor, huh?

638
00:53:43,457 --> 00:53:46,687
It's not easy to know that
at our age, don't you think?

639
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:50,816
I'm Goo Dae Hyung, a sophomore
in the physical education department.

640
00:53:50,817 --> 00:53:53,046
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

641
00:53:53,047 --> 00:53:55,787
I haven't seen your pretty face
around here. You must be a freshman.

642
00:53:55,788 --> 00:53:57,416
- I am.
- A freshman, huh?

643
00:53:57,417 --> 00:53:59,787
- Did you join any clubs yet?
- Not yet.

644
00:53:59,788 --> 00:54:03,427
Not yet? Why don't you
join our club then?

645
00:54:03,428 --> 00:54:04,666
What kind of club is it?

646
00:54:04,667 --> 00:54:07,017
It's a club where we work
together to learn new flavors.

647
00:54:07,018 --> 00:54:08,647
It's called "Let's Eat."

648
00:54:09,957 --> 00:54:11,436
Among the nessecities of life,
food, clothing, and shelter

649
00:54:11,437 --> 00:54:15,416
food means more than
just feeding ourselves.

650
00:54:15,417 --> 00:54:18,876
It not only satisfies
our desire to feed ourselves

651
00:54:18,877 --> 00:54:25,143
but also helps with stress from social
lives and loneliness from isolation.

652
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:31,487
So our club is sort of promoting
the pleasure of dining together.

653
00:54:31,488 --> 00:54:32,762
So what do you think?
Doesn't it sound fun?

654
00:54:32,763 --> 00:54:34,038
No, not at all.

655
00:54:35,797 --> 00:54:38,657
- Hello, senior.
- How dare you?

656
00:54:38,658 --> 00:54:41,828
You just got up in the middle of
trying to sell medicine?

657
00:54:42,538 --> 00:54:46,087
- I'm sorry.
- Plus, you punk...

658
00:54:46,098 --> 00:54:49,757
You can't recruit people
at a sacred place like the cafeteria.

659
00:54:49,758 --> 00:54:51,538
Where are your ethics?

660
00:54:51,937 --> 00:54:54,537
- I'm sorry.
- Go over there and stay.

661
00:54:54,538 --> 00:54:56,507
Hyun Ji here will have an upset stomach.

662
00:54:56,508 --> 00:54:58,297
I will. Please enjoy your lunch.

663
00:55:04,948 --> 00:55:08,257
Ones who are so smooth
with words are not to be trusted.

664
00:55:08,258 --> 00:55:12,834
You're not going to fall for
what he says and join his club, are you?

665
00:55:12,835 --> 00:55:15,577
- It'll be a disaster.
- Of course not.

666
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:19,158
In Rang graduated,
but why are you still here?

667
00:55:20,518 --> 00:55:22,896
You can't talk about it so openly.

668
00:55:22,897 --> 00:55:24,997
It's top secret.

669
00:55:27,417 --> 00:55:33,597
Actually, do you have time after lunch?

670
00:55:33,598 --> 00:55:36,988
I have something to tell you.

671
00:55:46,917 --> 00:55:51,738
<i>[Life and Sundae Soup]</i>

672
00:55:56,937 --> 00:56:04,937
You've been given such
a fantastic opportunity to be here.

673
00:56:07,268 --> 00:56:12,566
Now your life will be divided into

674
00:56:12,567 --> 00:56:17,586
before and after
you experience Sundae Soup.

675
00:56:17,587 --> 00:56:20,158
Kim In Rang.

676
00:56:32,718 --> 00:56:35,207
These are
the light refreshments we prepared.

677
00:56:35,527 --> 00:56:37,437
I hope you enjoy them.

678
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:52,917
Here we go again.

679
00:56:53,377 --> 00:56:55,796
By the way,
Chun Sang isn't a student, is he?

680
00:56:55,797 --> 00:56:57,658
Isn't he a scam artist?

681
00:57:03,147 --> 00:57:07,447
By promoting
academic-industrial collaboration

682
00:57:07,448 --> 00:57:10,767
we, Sundae Soup, contribute to
local and national development

683
00:57:10,768 --> 00:57:15,537
and lead innovative cultural tradition.

684
00:57:15,538 --> 00:57:19,138
In doing so, we'd like to
contribute to your bright future.

685
00:57:23,618 --> 00:57:27,157
Once you join our Sundae Soup...

686
00:57:27,158 --> 00:57:28,737
No need to listen anymore. Let's go.

687
00:57:28,738 --> 00:57:31,017
Top-notch multi-communication.

688
00:57:31,018 --> 00:57:34,947
We provide speedy and accurate service.

689
00:57:34,948 --> 00:57:37,907
We provide 24-hour exorcism services.

690
00:57:37,908 --> 00:57:40,258
We can do it all. Where...

691
00:57:41,247 --> 00:57:42,509
Hey...

692
00:57:42,895 --> 00:57:43,895
Hey guys, Bong Pal.

693
00:57:46,138 --> 00:57:47,976
How could you just leave?

694
00:57:47,977 --> 00:57:49,226
We still have part two.

695
00:57:49,227 --> 00:57:51,746
I'm not going to join any clubs.

696
00:57:51,747 --> 00:57:54,828
- Why not?
- I need to study hard so I can graduate.

697
00:57:57,448 --> 00:58:01,316
Gosh, isn't this too harsh?

698
00:58:01,317 --> 00:58:03,726
You don't want to be the president
or even join the club?

699
00:58:03,727 --> 00:58:06,267
Why don't we just
get rid of the club then?

700
00:58:06,268 --> 00:58:08,267
But we can still work together, huh?

701
00:58:08,268 --> 00:58:10,447
We couldn't do any work without you two.

702
00:58:10,448 --> 00:58:14,597
Bong Pal, Hyun Ji.
We're begging you this once.

703
00:58:14,598 --> 00:58:16,177
If our business goes bankrupt

704
00:58:16,178 --> 00:58:20,607
I will owe my grandma so much
and she will break his arms and legs.

705
00:58:22,181 --> 00:58:25,153
She will break them.

706
00:58:25,154 --> 00:58:27,437
Please save my arms and legs.

707
00:58:27,897 --> 00:58:29,907
If we work together

708
00:58:29,908 --> 00:58:31,706
we could really hit a jackpot.

709
00:58:31,707 --> 00:58:33,928
Chun Sang, it's just that...

710
00:58:34,768 --> 00:58:38,707
- I don't need money anymore.
- Me neither.

711
00:58:41,127 --> 00:58:44,436
Guys, it's not about money, you know.

712
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,117
You need to keep in mind that

713
00:58:46,118 --> 00:58:49,638
we're not doing this
to make money, right?

714
00:58:52,178 --> 00:58:59,027
Have you forgotten
the sacred idea of Sundae Soup?

715
00:59:00,587 --> 00:59:04,586
Like a pot that is boiling 24 hours
at a rice soup restaurant

716
00:59:04,587 --> 00:59:08,157
let's try to help
those who are suffering.

717
00:59:08,158 --> 00:59:09,807
What do you think about the idea?

718
00:59:09,808 --> 00:59:13,437
Did you already forget our promise?

719
00:59:14,238 --> 00:59:16,587
Bong Pal. Hyun Ji.

720
00:59:17,348 --> 00:59:20,817
Your power comes
with great responsibilities.

721
00:59:26,948 --> 00:59:30,717
Will you really let
your power go to waste?

722
00:59:30,718 --> 00:59:34,577
Do you know how many kids
are waiting to be rescued?

723
00:59:34,578 --> 00:59:36,187
Hold on.

724
00:59:40,198 --> 00:59:43,606
Hello, this is 24-hour
exorcism service, Sundae Soup.

725
00:59:43,607 --> 00:59:48,277
I'm a representative, Kim In Rang.
How may I help you?

726
00:59:50,038 --> 00:59:54,836
A ghost? A ghost?

727
00:59:54,837 --> 00:59:57,916
Are you hurt? Calm down.
Take a big breath.

728
00:59:57,917 --> 01:00:00,126
Where are you at?
I will come right over.

729
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:02,317
I understand. All right then.

730
01:00:04,317 --> 01:00:06,328
Gosh, what do we do?

731
01:00:06,968 --> 01:00:09,098
These people's cry.

732
01:00:10,207 --> 01:00:16,147
We can shine some light on their misery.

733
01:00:16,768 --> 01:00:18,436
Let's do it together.

734
01:00:18,437 --> 01:00:20,618
- Let's go, please.
- Please.

735
01:00:21,538 --> 01:00:24,477
Someone is hurt.

736
01:00:25,437 --> 01:00:29,218
- Bong Pal.
- Yes?

737
01:00:30,678 --> 01:00:33,747
What Chun Sang was saying
isn't entirely wrong.

738
01:00:35,138 --> 01:00:37,038
What do you mean?

739
01:00:37,828 --> 01:00:40,867
It's hard to see ghosts.

740
01:00:40,868 --> 01:00:43,337
But we can help them at the same time.

741
01:00:43,908 --> 01:00:46,526
Why would you want to help ghosts?

742
01:00:46,527 --> 01:00:49,627
Aren't they the same as us?

743
01:00:49,638 --> 01:00:54,538
They haven't crossed over to the other
side and are just lost right now.

744
01:00:56,147 --> 01:00:58,097
Think about it.

745
01:00:58,098 --> 01:01:00,448
Not all ghosts are bad.

746
01:01:02,297 --> 01:01:08,058
They have their pain
and sadness just like us.

747
01:01:29,678 --> 01:01:32,868
My son. My son.

748
01:02:03,417 --> 01:02:05,737
- Monk Myung Chul.
- Yes?

749
01:02:05,738 --> 01:02:09,427
Why do you exorcise?

750
01:02:09,428 --> 01:02:12,277
It's a tough job, but doesn't pay much.

751
01:02:16,008 --> 01:02:19,316
I help with the lingering attachment
of the ghosts who can't leave yet.

752
01:02:19,317 --> 01:02:22,436
I help get rid of people's fear.

753
01:02:22,437 --> 01:02:26,487
That way, everybody finds their way back.

754
01:02:26,488 --> 01:02:28,487
They go back to the places
where they belong.

755
01:02:28,488 --> 01:02:29,916
That's why I do it.

756
01:02:29,917 --> 01:02:34,107
Do you think I can do the job?

757
01:02:36,308 --> 01:02:38,178
Bong Pal.

758
01:02:39,317 --> 01:02:41,296
When I found out that
you'd go around exorcising

759
01:02:41,297 --> 01:02:43,598
do you know why I was so against that?

760
01:02:45,357 --> 01:02:46,657
Not sure.

761
01:02:46,658 --> 01:02:49,896
It was because I could see
hatred in your eyes then.

762
01:02:49,897 --> 01:02:52,936
You can't see the world right
when you have so much anger in you.

763
01:02:52,937 --> 01:02:54,936
You were hurt by ghosts.

764
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:57,287
But not all ghosts are bad.

765
01:02:57,288 --> 01:03:00,206
In a way, we should feel sorry for them.

766
01:03:00,207 --> 01:03:02,957
Are you asking if you can do the job?

767
01:03:03,328 --> 01:03:05,997
It's up to you what you think.

768
01:03:06,348 --> 01:03:12,007
Making others happy makes you happiest.

769
01:03:12,008 --> 01:03:14,407
If your eyes can give the dead ones peace

770
01:03:14,408 --> 01:03:18,607
you're not cursed,
but you have a special gift.

771
01:03:23,377 --> 01:03:27,126
By the way, it's so unlike you
that you're saying all good things.

772
01:03:27,127 --> 01:03:29,607
When do I ever say bad things, punk?

773
01:03:30,178 --> 01:03:32,767
- I think this is your first time.
- What?

774
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:35,417
Please continue.

775
01:03:37,817 --> 01:03:40,467
Ah, it's so good.

776
01:03:40,468 --> 01:03:43,547
- This is really nice.
- Yes.

777
01:03:44,268 --> 01:03:46,177
How long has it been?

778
01:03:46,178 --> 01:03:49,336
Seriously, how long has it been?

779
01:03:49,337 --> 01:03:52,928
I love going together like this!

780
01:03:54,457 --> 01:03:56,607
Hyun Ji. Bong Pal.

781
01:03:57,268 --> 01:03:59,396
Let's do this for the rest of our lives!

782
01:03:59,397 --> 01:04:01,227
Do this forever!

783
01:04:03,187 --> 01:04:05,227
Let's go!

Bong Pal.

785

Yes?

786
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:47,288
Why did you change your mind so suddenly?

787
01:04:49,268 --> 01:04:51,496
- I want to know.
- Know what?

788
01:04:51,497 --> 01:04:54,008
The reason why we can see ghosts.

789
01:04:56,357 --> 01:04:57,997
Let's go.

790
01:05:04,797 --> 01:05:08,997
- Let's fight ghosts!
- Let's fight ghosts!
