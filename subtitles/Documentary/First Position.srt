Ladies, gentlemen, please
vacate the stage.

00:00:47,382 --> 00:00:48,440
I know you hear me.

4
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,414
I know you know what it means.

5
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:52,076
Clear the stage!

Hannah.

14
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:04,917
I started dancing
when she was four.

15
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:13,183
I love ballet.

16
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:14,522
I do not know.

17
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:18,121
I just like it so ...

18
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,291
It's hard to explain.

19
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:24,633
This is an air gun.

20
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:26,468
Maybe I should
shoot right now.

21
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:28,474
These are things
Ballet Training

22
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:30,976
and this is a foot extender.

23
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,175
It hurts a lot.

24
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:35,840
This one here,

25
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,111
you're supposed to do
whenever possible

26
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,243
and then five times

27
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:41,412
after flatly
no longer can do.

28
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:45,014
This is to help
to turn around.

29
00:03:58,139 --> 00:03:59,800
That is right!

30
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:02,231
Yes!

31
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:08,879
My ballet teacher called
Denys Ganio.

32
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,478
He is French.

33
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:19,058
He is very strict,
but not in bad vibes.

34
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,822
Is strict cool.
It's funny.

35
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:32,567
When you do something right,

36
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,903
you really corrected.

37
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,033
Him ..

38
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,870
Well, sometimes it's painful.

39
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:00,359
When I work with Aran,

40
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,129
I'm not working
with a 1 1 years.

41
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:05,330
Pas de Bourree.
Plie.

42
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:11,708
If we have one or two as he
in our life, it is much.

43
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,176
I was lucky to accept
my son at 20

44
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:18,650
in Ballet
of the Paris Opera.

45
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:21,987
Now I have to Aran
and I am full.

46
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,478
Youth America Grand Prix
is coming

47
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,811
and have been training
very hard.

48
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:52,078
Hopefully that will deliver results.

49
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:58,983
It feels good to have
worked so hard

50
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:02,153
and have that mentality.

51
00:06:02,263 --> 00:06:06,256
Then you feel like everything hurts
when you get home.

52
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,769
Children who are engaged
the ballet as a career

53
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:14,034
leave much of his childhood.

54
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,200
Do not go to parties or sleepovers

55
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,039
and nothing unravel
or those things.

56
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,169
Not possible.

57
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:22,607
Do not throw the camera.

58
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,516
There are two babies.

59
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,151
'' The family of Aran
currently lives

60
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:34,853
near a U.S. Naval Base
Naples, ltaly.''

61
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,329
Since we are
a military family,

62
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,989
we moved a lot.

63
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,694
Ryan finished working
Bethesda

64
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,963
and it was time to move

65
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,302
to another place where there was
ballet training.

66
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:50,138
So our only option
was to go to that place

67
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,939
and try to find ballet
somewhere

68
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:56,278
or six months did Ryan
in Kuwait.

69
00:06:56,384 --> 00:06:58,614
Ryan chose to go to Kuwait
Six months

70
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:01,210
for Aran could continue
with their training.

71
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,516
Now we are in Naples

72
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,785
and drive two hours
north to Rome

73
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,884
to find
the best training.

74
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:11,598
So when you're ...

75
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:12,927
when you're in the Navy.

76
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:15,662
You can not ... You do not choose
where to live, so ...

77
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:18,066
It's a small price to pay.

78
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,672
Rock School'',
the best dance education''

79
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:50,363
Slowly.

80
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,338
I was born in Sierra Leone,
West Africa.

81
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:58,173
My name was Mabinty Bangura.

82
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:01,271
When I was adopted,
changed it to Michaela.

83
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:09,154
It is a miracle that I'm here.

84
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:11,315
P. .. I can not ...

85
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:12,983
I can not believe I'm here.

86
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:15,892
When I was younger,
I used to think I was dreaming.

87
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:18,826
'' Michaela was born during the boom

88
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:21,197
Civil War 1 2 years
in Sierra Leone''.

89
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:24,794
Wherever eye,
saw someone die.

90
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,101
There was not even a reason.

91
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:33,374
My parents were killed
by the rebels,

92
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:39,044
so my uncle brought me
the orphanage and ...

93
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:41,519
I lived there.

94
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,185
That was very good.

95
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:51,286
Yes.

96
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:53,530
Very well.

97
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,966
Do you know?
I think it is from the beginning

98
00:08:58,072 --> 00:08:59,266
leg sometimes goes,

99
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,840
then you try,
and get up and later.

100
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:01,999
Do you understand the joke?

101
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:03,667
In other words ...
Yes, sorry ...

102
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,108
That, returns to passé
a second.

103
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,703
Resistance is also
at the last moment,

104
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:09,715
not just drop it.

105
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:10,806
- Punta.
- Yes!

106
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,010
- Yes, exactly.
- Oh, my God.

107
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,347
- Big difference.
- It's huge.

108
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:14,580
If I'm here judging,

109
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:15,916
that would be a big difference.

110
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,888
In truth, it's huge.

111
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:19,892
So we decided to make
with its variation

112
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:21,052
was to go beyond the limit,

113
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:22,493
because it has extreme power.

114
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:23,585
You can do many things.

115
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:24,959
It's very athletic.

116
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,795
Now I have to get her away
Eagle

117
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,563
and a little closer
to the swan.

118
00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:39,608
This is me and she is Mia.

119
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,739
We adopted the same time.

120
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,317
I do not know how to describe it,

121
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,443
but it was ... it was very difficult
go to sleep

122
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:49,022
and the other children at the orphanage

123
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:52,991
were afraid that something bad
happen and escaped.

124
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,028
Michaela handled it all
very well, as ...

125
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,894
Once, I tried to save
my teacher,

126
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,058
but like I lost
knowledge

127
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,136
and cut off the arms
and legs,

128
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:05,671
and just left there.

129
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:10,771
Then we came to the United States

130
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:14,211
and all concerned
for us.

131
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:15,942
It was great.

132
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:26,484
Good night, Mom!

133
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:29,256
Good night, princesses.

134
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:31,920
Good night.

135
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,226
Good night.

136
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:40,338
Elastic spend my night painting
for the braces.

137
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:43,638
This used underwear
under their tutus,

138
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:46,304
not come in dark brown.

139
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:49,974
Pinto this
for a brunette girl

140
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:52,143
because they are all what we call
flesh color.

141
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:54,312
Well, white.

142
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,981
Would you still like this
is dark brown?

143
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:58,991
Here?

144
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:02,085
This needs to become
in dark brown.

145
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,792
A mother once told me:

146
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,961
'' Everyone knows that girls
Black can not dance ballet.''

147
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,631
Do they speak well because she
is adopted

148
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:16,471
and imagine that they feel
the same for her

149
00:11:16,577 --> 00:11:19,478
what they feel they
for their children?

150
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,808
Or so they say

151
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:25,180
because, in reality, are so
insensitive about race?

152
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:28,449
'' Love, Family''

153
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:33,892
We always wanted
a large family

154
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:36,394
and I said to my husband:
'' Why not adopt

155
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:38,863
'' An African country affected
by war?

156
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:41,696
No one deserves to be caught
in a war zone.''

157
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,531
We were in the process
to adopt Mia

158
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:45,537
and said:'' There's another girl

159
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,698
'' And can not find
a family for her

160
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,036
'' Because he has vitiligo,

161
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:51,043
'' Has pigmentation

162
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:53,773
'' And everyone is afraid
of adoption,

163
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:56,441
'' Because they thought it was
Devil girl

164
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,108
because of its spots.''

165
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,277
He said:'' Oh ...

166
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,752
Well, we can adopt it.''

167
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,288
I said,'' Yes, I thought so.''

168
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:08,527
That's how we had to Michaela.

169
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:11,189
I remember when I was six,

170
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:14,859
had her first recital
and he said:

171
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,094
'' Mom, you see my spots?''

172
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:17,363
I said:'' No, not at all.

173
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:18,699
No notice''.

174
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:20,034
She said:'' Oh, that's good.''

175
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,664
He said:'' I just wanted to make sure

176
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,766
'' Because if you can not see
from the audience

177
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:27,244
then I know that I can be
a professional dancer.''

178
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,942
At the orphanage,
I found a magazine

179
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:35,112
with a ballerina en pointe
in a pink tutu.

180
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:37,315
I kept it and I thought,

181
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:41,155
if I ever take,
I want to become something.

182
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,729
He looked so happy.

183
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:47,028
Being on tiptoe,
I thought it was great.

184
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,469
Is the only
I lived for,

185
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:52,801
become this person,

186
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,466
be exactly
as that dancer.

187
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,410
Getting a scholarship is something
very large.

188
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:03,415
It gives you the opportunity
to go to a place

189
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:05,212
where you never thought to go.

190
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:06,718
He takes pressure off your parents,

191
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,721
who you are paying everything.

192
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,882
The thing is that there are many
stereotypes

193
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:13,892
they say that if you
a ballerina black

194
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,222
have terrible feet,

195
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:17,058
have no extension.

196
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,722
You're too muscular.

197
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:21,392
Not have sufficient grace.

198
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:25,563
I would like to know as
the delicate black dancer

199
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,867
ballet dancing.

200
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,813
'' Every year, more than 5,000
Dancers (from September 9 to 1 years)

201
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,650
'' Enter the semifinals
of Youth America Grand Prix

202
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:46,419
held in most of 1 5
cities around the world.''

203
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:53,762
'' Only the most talented
advance to the finals

204
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,131
'' And compete for scholarships
and valuable contracts

205
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,727
from prestigious institutions
Dance around the world.''

206
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,299
You have to keep working,
follow, follow, follow

207
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:03,899
and the day will come.

208
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,146
A ballet competition
is controversial.

209
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:09,806
People do not realize

210
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:14,513
how important it is
fututo for a dancer.

211
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,587
They know exactly what
they want to do with your life.

212
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,958
They need to start
find work at 1 7 years.

213
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:30,698
Entering at least 5,000
competition

214
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:32,795
for the semifinals

215
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,464
and only a few hundred

216
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:36,907
reach the end
in New York.

217
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,478
You have five minutes
on stage

218
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,878
to prove why
you deserve this opportunity

219
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,745
and not someone else.

220
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:45,944
When I'm Back
the stage, I always tell

221
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,920
'' Good luck'' or'' good job''
and I look like I'm crazy.

222
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,786
Because people
is super competitive.

223
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,826
When I say'' good luck''
I see it as,

224
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,896
'' Who are you?
Why are you talking about?''

225
00:14:56,997 --> 00:15:00,455
All evaluate each other
when they arrive.

226
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:04,867
You can see immediately
when you enter,

227
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:07,236
especially in the dressing room.

228
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:13,109
Five minutes to the show.
Five minutes.

229
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:22,013
From 263 to 270, please
out into the hallway.

230
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,521
We are about to begin.

231
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,652
The talent level here
is very high.

232
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,320
So it's a good place
for them,

233
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,898
because there directors
from different companies

234
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,527
worldwide
and disclosed.

235
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,897
My name is Joan Sebastian.

236
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:17,067
I'm from Colombia.

237
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:20,510
My dream
is to be a professional dancer.

238
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,389
This competition is very,
very important to me.

239
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:35,257
A scholarship can change my life.

240
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,159
Working for my family.

241
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:39,323
I remember all the time

242
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,663
my mom telling:
'' Keep going.

243
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:44,430
I know it will be wonderful,
the better.''

244
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:47,803
You're not jumping,
're flying, remember that.

245
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:48,966
Master, can play ...

246
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:51,909
and one, two, and three, and four?

247
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:06,157
Working this hard.

248
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,159
Sometimes you wake up

249
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:09,819
and your body is very tired.

250
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,330
Then you say:
'' Why am I doing this?''

251
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,332
It's like, no, I quit.

252
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:15,423
I want to go to Colombia.

253
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,593
I want to see my family,

254
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,871
but when you start
to take class

255
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:23,534
feel this magic thing
you have.

256
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:25,168
So it's like,
no, I want ...

257
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,178
I want to ...
I really want to do this.

258
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:38,357
How will you finish
your variation?

259
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,088
Well, I have to.

260
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,856
As a dancer,
I think he is very talented

261
00:17:43,964 --> 00:17:46,091
and I think it was made
to dance.

262
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:51,295
This is when I was dancing
ABT.

263
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:56,035
Memories to jump
were without pain.

264
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:00,841
One, two, three.

265
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,107
Mine is better.

266
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,518
Joan, leaving his family
so young

267
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:08,679
and coming to another country

268
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,984
where you do not speak the language.

269
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,524
Everything is completely different

270
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:14,355
and you have to start from scratch.

271
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,452
I can give a
phone card, please.

272
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,332
Sometimes I ask:
'' How is everything?''

273
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:21,992
He says:
'' Well,'' I miss my mom.

274
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,763
It's tough.

275
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:28,236
He will be responsible for helping
his family,

276
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,832
so has
a great responsibility.

277
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,296
The food is almost ready.

278
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:11,612
We are, indeed, Latinos

279
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:13,777
and we love beans.

280
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:15,946
- And rice.
- And rice.

281
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:19,048
Almost every day,
eat the same.

282
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:38,436
Many dancers
would like to have a career,

283
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:41,098
but very, very, very few
succeed.

284
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,766
You must have the correct physical.

285
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:44,241
You must have the correct technique.

286
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:46,175
You must have a good
economic situation,

287
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:49,009
because the ballet is very,
very expensive.

288
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:51,083
Shoes, clothes, trips,

289
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:55,177
inscriptions, instructors,
tuition.

290
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:58,854
Maybe you could buy
two cars.

291
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:04,221
It can cost $ 1, 500
by choreography,

292
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:05,889
but winning advertising

293
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:07,557
to do well
competency

294
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,431
it might be a job
in a company.

295
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:13,097
All the money we have paid

296
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:17,142
in the last 1 0, 1 5 years
you've been dancing

297
00:21:17,244 --> 00:21:18,905
be worth your university.

298
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:22,243
Hopefully now collect
the fruits, hopefully.

299
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:29,916
The daily income of the study ...

300
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:36,392
More private classes.

301
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:40,057
Each tutu, perhaps making
about 1 to 00 hours to,

302
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,363
depending on how many
layers of tulle.

303
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,665
It is very expensive to go

304
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:47,000
and buy them all the time.

305
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:49,041
A well-made tutu

306
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:52,373
can cost
between $ 1 500 and $ 2,000.

307
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:55,039
For me,
is like a wedding dress.

308
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:59,050
No ballet dress
1 for a girl four years.

309
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:00,980
Although we live in ltaly,

310
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:05,285
Aran has a manufacturer
Chicago favorite costumes.

311
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:12,363
These shoes premiered yesterday

312
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:15,195
and almost no use.

313
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:18,362
Sometimes, I try to find
stronger shoes,

314
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:21,133
to avoid having to spend
$ 80 daily.

315
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:47,892
Really, I love
see them dance.

316
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:50,902
I can see like five
or six hours a day

317
00:22:51,004 --> 00:22:53,472
without getting bored at all.

318
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:16,926
Many kids my age,

319
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,761
January 00% are not sure
what they want to do.

320
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:22,835
I know I want to dance ballet

321
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:25,131
for the rest of my life.

322
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,739
Those people who say I'm
losing my childhood ...

323
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:33,574
I think I've had
enough childhood

324
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,514
and ballet sufficient
until now.

325
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:45,920
Let ...
Leave your head.

326
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:49,086
I think dancing in a company
with my brother

327
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,857
when we are bigger,
that is my big goal,

328
00:23:51,965 --> 00:23:54,195
but it depends on him.

329
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,996
I mean, if he wants to achieve
that goal.

330
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,936
Yes, a high passé,
above, outside.

331
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:06,503
I think I'm better at ...

332
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:10,174
I think I'm better at emotion.

333
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:13,150
No emotion, but to smile.

334
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:21,385
I knew nothing,
nothing about ballet,

335
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:23,428
not even the first position
or nothing.

336
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:27,657
Before the start Miko
with ballet,

337
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:30,327
sulked
after his nap.

338
00:24:30,437 --> 00:24:31,836
I took her to ballet.

339
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:33,667
Suddenly
was well animated.

340
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:35,604
It was, well, well happy.

341
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:42,806
So I started to study

342
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:46,511
to have more knowledge
about ballet.

343
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,285
If we were not a family
ballet,

344
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:52,290
perhaps would weigh
about 4 kilos more.

345
00:24:52,392 --> 00:24:56,453
We would take more vacations,
would see more TV.

346
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:59,054
We would like
a normal family.

347
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,731
My ballet teacher, Viktor,

348
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,738
suggested it would be good idea

349
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,569
to study at home,

350
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:12,907
so that there were more hours
for ballet.

351
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:17,574
So I can improve
in less time.

352
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,675
I miss my friends,

353
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:23,415
because at home,
only my mom and my dog.

354
00:25:25,425 --> 00:25:27,188
Miko, we gotta go.

355
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:30,956
Otherwise,
arrive late for rehearsal.

356
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:37,964
Okay, Miko.
Let's get ready.

357
00:25:38,338 --> 00:25:43,241
Show us the wild child
the streets of Seville.

358
00:25:43,343 --> 00:25:44,901
Forward.

359
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,172
Energy. Dynamic.

360
00:25:56,256 --> 00:25:57,951
Yes.

361
00:25:58,258 --> 00:25:59,623
Open shoulders.
Perfect.

362
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,091
Arms in first position.

363
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:04,991
Up, up, up!

364
00:26:05,098 --> 00:26:06,429
Do not give up!
Be strong!

365
00:26:11,304 --> 00:26:13,772
Miko is a student
exceptional.

366
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:19,543
Thank you.
Good job.

367
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:23,707
I do not see Jules
is the same case.

368
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:27,343
Can you plunge the stomach?

369
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:31,684
You bring a suit ballet
young.

370
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:34,089
Can you work hard?

371
00:26:34,194 --> 00:26:35,752
Deal stomach.

372
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:37,659
Crush your breakfast.

373
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:39,922
I did not choose this variation.

374
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:44,231
I want to take the blame for everything
to Satoko.

375
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,504
Dream come true.

376
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:49,507
Your son is dancing now
<i> Swan Lake </ i>.

377
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:53,336
A softer plie, Jules.

378
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:56,313
Plie softer.
Pie pointed.

379
00:27:03,256 --> 00:27:04,814
I run!
Run, run, run, run.

380
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:06,983
Final position since.
Come on!

381
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:08,424
Big jump!

382
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:11,491
Big jump!

383
00:27:11,598 --> 00:27:14,089
Even bigger now.
Top!

384
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:30,147
In fact, reverence
is the best part.

385
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,309
Well, the good thing is that
I'm not cool

386
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:34,750
and he loves it.

387
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,457
Do not tell anyone of my friends
school I dance ballet,

388
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,824
because in my old school,
I said,

389
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:45,727
but all began
to ridicule me.

390
00:27:48,635 --> 00:27:54,540
Many men believe
that ballet is not what it is.

391
00:27:54,641 --> 00:27:57,075
He is very athletic.

392
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:04,011
Women have tutus
and ballet flats.

393
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:06,517
Men do things male.

394
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:09,019
There is much energy and focus.

395
00:28:09,122 --> 00:28:11,682
We heard stories
on children dancing

396
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:15,022
entering the secondary
and exit

397
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:17,824
by merciless teasing
and stereotypes.

398
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,490
Until now,
he is strong and understands

399
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,037
not worth listening to
to such people.

400
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,029
I must say,

401
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:30,473
I never imagined that my son
was a dancer.

402
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:31,634
I played baseball as a child

403
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:33,177
and assumed that my son was going to do

404
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,975
some baseball, basketball ...

405
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:38,744

more proud.

In the summer,
went to an adult class

414
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:42,507
and she was very scared

415
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,276
because all
They are very professional.

416
00:29:44,384 --> 00:29:48,286
Suddenly, we saw a child
of age ...

417
00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:50,618
An adorable toddler and wonderful.

418
00:29:50,723 --> 00:29:54,625
Gaya became interested
in ballet after that,

419
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:57,218
I think it was for Aran.

420
00:30:02,535 --> 00:30:06,335

something in his face changed.

As age is changing.

438
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:14,225
Something in the expression

439
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,665
and concentration
is changing.

440
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:21,604
It becomes adult
when he dances.

441
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:51,799
I can not breathe.

442
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:55,171

443
00:33:01,948 --> 00:33:04,849

will go into the final round.

444

00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:45,133
I think that's flexible.

493
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:47,795
It's pretty disgusting.

494
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:51,534
Many people tell me
I'm disgusting

495
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:55,080
because I can do strange things
as these.

496
00:36:55,181 --> 00:36:57,172
'' Parking princesses,
'' crane is used

497
00:36:57,283 --> 00:36:58,910
'' Princess''

498
00:36:59,018 --> 00:37:01,145
Street'' Princess''

499
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:05,347
My nickname at school
is Barbie,

500
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:09,188
I think because I can bend
in different directions

501
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:13,129
and I love the pink,
I have blond hair.

502
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:17,402
I started dancing
just for fun

503
00:37:17,503 --> 00:37:20,404
but now it is much more than that.

504
00:37:20,506 --> 00:37:25,739
I'm working to be
professional and is just ...

505
00:37:25,845 --> 00:37:29,747
It is a way to express,
besides talk.

506
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:31,077
My friends tell me as:

507
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:33,481
'' Why can not miss
one day at a dance class?''

508
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:37,044
They do not understand the discipline
of the dancers.

509
00:37:37,156 --> 00:37:38,885
Do not believe it is a race

510
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:41,221
or so I've been
working so hard

511
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:43,727
all your life.

512
00:37:49,068 --> 00:37:50,968
Rebecca Houseknecht.

513
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:56,039
'' The second dance of Rebecca
demonstrated to the judges

514
00:37:56,141 --> 00:38:01,204
that had the potential
to advance to the final round.''

515
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,851
I was fully prepared
for this competition,

516
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,853
was on stage and ...

517
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,354
For this variation
in particular

518
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:13,891
which is super easy
for her.

519
00:38:13,993 --> 00:38:16,894
I said:'' This is not my Rebecca''.

520
00:38:16,996 --> 00:38:18,725
However,
handled it pretty well.

521
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:22,892
I mean, not to cut down
veins.

522
00:38:23,002 --> 00:38:24,401
He handled it pretty well,

523
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:26,664
which is a tribute
maturity.

524
00:38:28,007 --> 00:38:29,406
It will do much better

525
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:31,408
in the finals in New York,
Is not it?

526
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,000
- Yes
- Yes

527
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:34,837
I need to relax.

528
00:38:34,947 --> 00:38:36,346
Yes.
You can see it in your face.

529
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:37,472
Yes.

530
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:40,416
Exhale and relax.

531
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,550
That's it.
That's it.

532
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:46,386
It's better.
It's better.

533
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:48,221
Then comes the little pirouette

534
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:50,818
to the arabesque position.

535
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:59,562
Why can not do that
with music?

536
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:01,765
- Do not know.
- Do not you know?

537
00:39:01,874 --> 00:39:03,341
Do it again.

538
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,940
It definitely helps to have
a beautiful body

539
00:39:08,047 --> 00:39:09,446
for ballet ...

540
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:11,277
Long legs and cute,
small head,

541
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:15,183
beautifully arched feet,
proportionate body.

542
00:39:15,287 --> 00:39:19,690
Tenacity is the main thing
you need a dancer.

543
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:22,124
I worry that Rebecca
is looking for work

544
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:24,354
at this particular time,
because companies

545
00:39:24,463 --> 00:39:26,863
are laying off dancers,
are not engaging them.

546
00:39:26,966 --> 00:39:30,493
It has everything and is ready.

547
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:32,934
You just need to trust her.

548
00:39:42,181 --> 00:39:43,876
Michaela semifinal round''''

549
00:39:43,983 --> 00:39:45,211
I have fear.

550
00:39:45,317 --> 00:39:47,046
There were, like, really good ...

551
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:48,210
People really skinny.

552
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,719
Ya know.
Wish I was ...

553
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:51,380
That green leotard.

554
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,889
It was great.

555
00:39:52,992 --> 00:39:54,220
Was it like super high?

556
00:39:54,326 --> 00:39:55,486
Yes ..

557
00:39:57,596 --> 00:40:00,326
lgual and go outside.

558
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:01,660
Outside?

559
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:03,758
Yes, because I can not stand
be here.

560
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:07,535
I'm starting to give heat.

561
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:20,516
Issue 1 1 4, Michaela??

562
00:40:29,328 --> 00:40:31,228
Michaela DePrince, January 4 years.

563
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,663
Dryad <i> Will Change </ i>
<i> of Don Quixote </ i>.

564
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:36,258
Bravo!

565
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:47,068
Been great!

566
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:53,306
It was the first time
I see you dancing,

567
00:41:53,412 --> 00:41:55,312
my love.

568
00:41:55,414 --> 00:41:56,972
You were enjoying it,

569
00:41:57,082 --> 00:41:59,516
smiling and were
doing well.

570
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:05,280
No more than people
the show.

571
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,448
This is great.

572
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:08,355
You danced better than ever.

573
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:14,460
I was impressed.

574
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:16,557
You were great.

575
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,264
I hold my breath ...

576
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:20,360
until it ends.

577
00:42:20,472 --> 00:42:21,905
Yes, sometimes,
hold your breath

578
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:22,996
almost all the time.

579
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:24,939
The dance was perfect today.

580
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,943
He was in total control.
So it was ...

581
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,603
Almost we break fingers

582
00:42:28,714 --> 00:42:30,705
to hold on so strong.

583
00:42:42,461 --> 00:42:45,259
This side and tip.

584
00:42:45,364 --> 00:42:48,925
Competition in the world
is so great.

585
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:53,027
If a girl like her,
but with better feet

586
00:42:53,138 --> 00:42:57,541
judges and directors would take it
her instead of Miko.

587
00:42:57,643 --> 00:42:59,042
I always joke and say:

588
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:01,203
'' Miko, I'll break your foot

589
00:43:01,313 --> 00:43:04,214
or I'll break your wrist.''

590
00:43:04,316 --> 00:43:07,547
That's what it takes
because elsewhere

591
00:43:07,653 --> 00:43:11,214
Children are working
non-stop, right?

592
00:43:11,323 --> 00:43:13,382
With devotion and with the idea

593
00:43:13,492 --> 00:43:16,893
you want to be
a great dancer

594
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:19,327
or a great dancer.

595
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:42,486
We moved two weeks ago
to be closer to the ballet.

596
00:43:42,588 --> 00:43:46,080
Then my husband changed
his office,

597
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:49,251
so workers
also had to move

598
00:43:49,361 --> 00:43:51,955
by Miko and Jules ballet.

599
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:55,094
My sons work
more hours than I

600
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,328
and work every day,
to Saturday and Sunday.

601
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:02,339
's Father because well I have not

602
00:44:02,441 --> 00:44:04,341
the guilt''
the entrepreneur''

603
00:44:04,443 --> 00:44:07,606
as my children, in fact,
work harder than me.

604
00:44:12,117 --> 00:44:14,608
Good face, good foot.

605
00:44:16,455 --> 00:44:17,786
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

606
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:19,379
All right, all right, all right.

607
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:20,719
Oh, my back.

608
00:44:20,826 --> 00:44:23,659
The other moms think I'm
too involved,

609
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:26,230
but I will not regret

610
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:28,492
have been able to do more
them.

611
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,434
So I think I try to do
best.

612
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:37,668
I love broccoli.

613
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:40,506
Dad, I bet I can
this put me in the mouth.

614
00:44:40,612 --> 00:44:42,011
I bet you can.

615
00:44:42,114 --> 00:44:43,274
No, no, no, no, no, no.

616
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:45,438
No, no, no, no.

617
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:46,539
Andale, J. J.
Do it.

618
00:44:46,652 --> 00:44:48,017
Metellus.

619
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,451
I have money wagered.

620
00:44:50,722 --> 00:44:52,212
Say:'''' Fat Bunny.

621
00:44:53,725 --> 00:44:55,625
Fat Bunny.

622
00:44:55,727 --> 00:45:00,221
I want to eat broccoli,
spinach and carrots.

623
00:45:00,332 --> 00:45:05,065
We cheese, but is 50%
less fat

624
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:08,105
and 30% fewer calories.

625
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:11,403
Nonfat yogurt
for Miko and Jules

626
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:15,241
and low-fat yogurt
for my husband and me.

627
00:45:15,347 --> 00:45:19,750
I have very carefully
to stay fit

628
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:24,845
and do not get fat.

629
00:45:28,527 --> 00:45:30,927
When we fight and my sister
I say fat,

630
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:32,860
I say anorexic.

631
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:35,427
But I'm not.

632
00:45:35,534 --> 00:45:36,592
Well, I'm not.

633
00:45:36,702 --> 00:45:38,101
Really, I am.
I love food.

634
00:45:38,203 --> 00:45:40,137
Yes, she is not anorexic.

635
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:42,331
Some people say I'm
too skinny

636
00:45:42,441 --> 00:45:47,640
and I should start to get fat,
but ...

637
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:50,510
But you have to be skinny
to dance ballet.

638
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:53,311
You must have a lot of energy

639
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:56,046
and for that, you need food.

640
00:46:02,728 --> 00:46:04,958
In fact, I think
the dancers eat much.

641
00:46:05,063 --> 00:46:08,157
Most, I think.
I do not know. We are.

642
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:19,334
I think we're just thin

643
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:22,607
because we burn all
calories.

644
00:46:22,714 --> 00:46:25,308
If you did not eat,
could not dance.

645
00:47:39,157 --> 00:47:41,682
Joan Sebastian Semifinal''''

646
00:47:55,073 --> 00:47:58,474
My dream is to go to the Royal Ballet.

647
00:47:58,577 --> 00:48:01,307
My inspiration is Carlos Acosta.

648
00:48:01,413 --> 00:48:04,814
He changed everything
in the world of ballet,

649
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:09,080
it was the first dancer
black at the Royal Ballet.

650
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:11,087
For some reason,
I feel something like

651
00:48:11,189 --> 00:48:12,952
to be Colombian.

652

00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:57,767
Punta. Punta.

657
00:49:11,316 --> 00:49:13,807
Higher, higher, higher.

658
00:49:16,154 --> 00:49:19,555
Number 202, Miko Fogarty,
January 2 years.

659
00:49:19,658 --> 00:49:21,387
<i> Urban Flower </ i>.

660
00:49:32,904 --> 00:49:36,135
I was thinking,
Why do you fall?

661
00:49:36,241 --> 00:49:39,904
I screwed up both.

662
00:49:40,011 --> 00:49:42,411
It's my fault.
No Miko's fault.

663
00:49:42,514 --> 00:49:45,415
What goes wrong
on stage is my fault,

664
00:49:45,517 --> 00:49:48,042
but to be good,
is for her.

665
00:49:49,754 --> 00:49:52,245
'' After falling, Miko will
to prove to the judges

666
00:49:52,357 --> 00:49:55,793

to the finals.''

667
00:50:10,442 --> 00:50:12,000
Miko Fogarty, January 2 years

668
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:15,136
<i> spring moments July 1 </ i>.

669
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:20,068
He was as anxious all

670
00:51:20,178 --> 00:51:21,372
as well ...

671
00:51:21,479 --> 00:51:24,380
Like a bird in its cage
wanting to escape.

672
00:51:24,482 --> 00:51:25,881
Then ...

673
00:51:25,984 --> 00:51:28,475
Then, yes, I did well.

674
00:51:30,055 --> 00:51:32,956
What I love about her,
fell.

675
00:51:33,058 --> 00:51:35,288
Never seen before
that fall well

676
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:39,227
and got up and danced as
if he had not fallen.

677
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:41,958
It's tiny, but strong.

678
00:51:43,301 --> 00:51:45,292
- Right?
- Yes

679
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:48,236
The strongest thing in the world.

680
00:52:19,104 --> 00:52:20,833
I think I did very well.

681
00:52:20,939 --> 00:52:25,672
I think Viktor will say:
'' You did better

682
00:52:25,777 --> 00:52:29,338
because you had an audience
front of you.''

683
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:34,282
Or something negative that is supposed
must be positive.

684
00:52:34,385 --> 00:52:38,151
You always do a good job
on stage

685
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:39,621
and that's important.

686
00:52:39,724 --> 00:52:40,952
Are you happy?

687
00:52:41,059 --> 00:52:42,117
Yes.

688
00:52:42,227 --> 00:52:43,455
Are you sure?

689
00:52:43,561 --> 00:52:45,552
Yes?
Well, well, well, well.

690
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:51,564
The way to bring their children
to New York

691
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,102
to make themselves known.

692
00:52:53,204 --> 00:52:57,402
'' Both Miko and Jules
advance to the finals.''

693
00:52:58,476 --> 00:53:00,467
'' Jules was the youngest child
in their division

694
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:03,138
and the judges gave
another chance.''

695
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:13,257
'' Joan Sebastian returns home
for the first time in over one year.''

696
00:53:35,046 --> 00:53:36,377
Here we are.

697
00:55:55,286 --> 00:55:58,517
It is a soup with chicken.

698
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:01,349
Every time we are together,
always do this.

699
00:56:01,459 --> 00:56:03,120
This is as traditional.

700
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:13,200
Oh!
God.

701
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:53,969
The scholarship is about $ 50,000

702
00:56:54,078 --> 00:56:58,412
and the minimum wage in Colombia
is $ 250 a month.

703
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:44,293
J. J. stopped taking classes
ballet.

704
00:57:44,395 --> 00:57:48,764
He said:'' I have no passion
for the ballet''.

705
00:57:52,203 --> 00:57:54,933
I think it's difficult for my mom
I quit seeing.

706
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:56,438
So she asks me:

707
00:57:56,541 --> 00:57:58,771
'' Really, tell me the truth.

708
00:57:58,876 --> 00:58:00,275
Like ballet or not?''.

709
00:58:00,378 --> 00:58:02,437
And I say something like:'' No''.

710
00:58:02,547 --> 00:58:03,878
Something like that.

711
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:07,541
I ...

712
00:58:13,224 --> 00:58:15,624
I never imagined that when
leave him,

713
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:17,626
I would be so sad.

714
00:58:17,728 --> 00:58:18,956
I like the ballet,

715
00:58:19,063 --> 00:58:22,123
but I never loved
as my sister.

716
00:58:22,233 --> 00:58:25,134
I miss him dance.

717
00:58:25,236 --> 00:58:29,468
I saw a boy dancing
<i> Swan Lake </ i>

718
00:58:29,574 --> 00:58:32,065
which he danced

719
00:58:34,212 --> 00:58:36,203
and music ...

720
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:43,648
I told his mom,
you can wear the costume of J. J.

721
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:46,416
So I could see.

722
00:58:48,259 --> 00:58:49,658
Ay, J. J.

723
00:58:53,631 --> 00:58:54,859
People do not realize

724
00:58:54,966 --> 00:58:57,662
how difficult it is to make
as a dancer.

725
00:58:57,768 --> 00:59:01,602
You have so many injuries
as professional athletes.

726
00:59:06,144 --> 00:59:08,203
People always think
that football players

727
00:59:08,312 --> 00:59:10,712
lacrosse, soccer

728
00:59:10,815 --> 00:59:12,214
are those that are injured,

729
00:59:12,316 --> 00:59:15,547
but ballet dancers
are injured every day

730
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:17,814
and must continue working.

731
00:59:21,893 --> 00:59:26,125
The skin on the bottom
my foot is clear,

732
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:27,458
as you cut

733
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:30,466
and the top of my foot
scraped

734
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:31,796
friction with the floor.

735
00:59:31,903 --> 00:59:33,734
The top of my foot
starts bleeding

736
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:35,305
and I get like scabs.

737
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,969
You're working your body
maximum

738
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:40,475
since we have
about five years.

739
00:59:41,145 --> 00:59:42,703
They are beautiful
in ballet slippers,

740
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:45,714
but when you take them off,
are not as nice.

741
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,274
They have a torn ligament

742
00:59:47,385 --> 00:59:48,784
or have a stress fracture

743
00:59:48,886 --> 00:59:50,114
and may be out for a year.

744
00:59:50,221 --> 00:59:52,280
Well, that can make
shatter a career.

745
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:54,790
Which causes further
working with injuries

746
00:59:54,892 --> 00:59:57,383
when they should not.

747
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:02,864
You make your body do things

748
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:04,696
that is not supposed to do,
it is not.

749
01:00:04,802 --> 01:00:05,860
But satisfactory.

750
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:07,437
- Not natural.
- It is not.

751
01:00:07,538 --> 01:00:09,529
If you only stay there.

752
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:12,198
Feel the heat.

753

'' Waiting Room
CT scans''

754
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,489
When you return to dance,

755
01:00:27,592 --> 01:00:30,254
you will feel like you never
happened.

756
01:00:41,439 --> 01:00:44,408
'' Three days before the end''

757
01:00:57,321 --> 01:01:00,017
I have tendinitis
in my Achilles tendon.

758
01:01:00,124 --> 01:01:01,614
I started hurting really bad.

759
01:01:07,265 --> 01:01:10,234
I'm doing half of what
others are doing.

760
01:01:12,903 --> 01:01:14,131
It is very painful.

761
01:01:14,238 --> 01:01:15,899
Never stops hurting.

762
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:19,600
It should not be competing,

763
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:22,178
but do not want to ruin
my career here, so ...

764
01:01:27,718 --> 01:01:29,618
We are three days
competition

765
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,781
and we are working with her,
their eyes fill with tears

766
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:37,452
and says:'' I do not think
I can do it.''

767
01:01:37,561 --> 01:01:40,394
If you can not,
Do not.

768
01:01:42,967 --> 01:01:45,026
He also knows that if he does

769
01:01:45,136 --> 01:01:47,866
and can not do well,

770
01:01:47,972 --> 01:01:51,135
then what is right?

771
01:01:53,611 --> 01:01:56,341
Michaela!
Stop. Stop.

772
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:00,708
Try to keep it warm.

773
01:02:00,818 --> 01:02:02,615
Do not overdo it, not worth it.

774
01:02:05,022 --> 01:02:06,421
Maybe I should stop dancing.

775
01:02:06,524 --> 01:02:09,084
Maybe this is not for me.

776
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:15,797
Oh, it is super cold.

777
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,333
Okay.

778
01:02:20,604 --> 01:02:22,504
Right now is just bloated

779
01:02:22,606 --> 01:02:24,335
and it hurts a lot.

780
01:02:24,442 --> 01:02:26,410
I can not do anything about it.

781
01:02:32,717 --> 01:02:35,880
Miko, can you check everything
what we have?

782
01:02:38,055 --> 01:02:39,613
Where did you put on makeup?

783
01:02:39,724 --> 01:02:40,952
Makeup goes here.

784
01:02:41,058 --> 01:02:43,458
Can you put makeup there?

785
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:52,720
It looks good.

786
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:54,229
It's cute, right?

787
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,993
A crown.
How fitting.

788
01:03:58,936 --> 01:03:59,960
Yes.

789
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:01,537

820
01:06:05,863 --> 01:06:07,057
Do not feel anything ...
No, no, no.

821
01:06:07,164 --> 01:06:08,529
Open up, open.
Stay, stay.

822
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:10,031
Where should you stay?
Opens.

823

Strive.

824
01:06:11,302 --> 01:06:12,929
Feel, feel.
Feel, feel.

825
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:29,642
Dancers, leaving the
scenario, please.

826
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:30,845
We are about to begin.

827
01:06:37,962 --> 01:06:40,692
Please take your seats,
please.

828
01:06:41,298 --> 01:06:44,961
Is your number?
Are you 446?

829
01:06:45,069 --> 01:06:47,731
Are you 444?
Okay.

444, Aran Bell, January 1st years

831
01:07:05,155 --> 01:07:08,454
presenting <i> La Chauve-souris </ i>.

832
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:35,938
It was great.
Thank you.

833
01:08:39,316 --> 01:08:41,375
It's really amazing.

834
01:08:41,485 --> 01:08:46,149
I came from lsrael to New
York for this competition.

835
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:53,423
My heart is beating right
strong, I'm super excited.

836
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:55,964
I'm so stressed,
but need to calm down

837
01:08:56,066 --> 01:08:57,465
and get into my character.

838
01:09:40,377 --> 01:09:44,370
I felt much as Coppélia.
It was so emotional.

839
01:10:08,806 --> 01:10:10,205
They both did very well.

840
01:10:10,307 --> 01:10:11,706
It was fantastic.

841
01:10:11,809 --> 01:10:13,037
- Thank you.
- Beautiful.

842
01:10:13,143 --> 01:10:14,303
Oh, my God.
I loved it.

843
01:10:16,647 --> 01:10:18,478
She could not see your number
because ...

844
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:21,913
But it is safe
you were perfect.

845
01:10:22,019 --> 01:10:23,213
Did you enjoy it?

846
01:10:24,454 --> 01:10:25,887
Sorry.

847
01:10:28,492 --> 01:10:30,221
New York is stressful.

848
01:10:30,327 --> 01:10:31,885
All are wonderful.

849
01:10:31,995 --> 01:10:33,724
Everyone has potential.

850
01:10:33,831 --> 01:10:36,493
Everyone wants to go
the same companies.

851
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:44,999
These children are so hard
themselves

852
01:10:45,108 --> 01:10:46,769
that if they make a small mistake,

853
01:10:46,877 --> 01:10:48,936
is difficult to deal
with them after

854
01:10:49,046 --> 01:10:51,276
because they're perfectionists.

855
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,396
Amber, look at me.

856
01:11:14,504 --> 01:11:15,732
Just tell me it was horrible.

857
01:11:15,839 --> 01:11:17,306
It was beautiful.

858
01:11:17,407 --> 01:11:20,570
Only that ... only the second
bourrée pas.

859
01:11:20,677 --> 01:11:23,077
It's a live performance.

860
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:25,580
Whatever happens,
happens, you know?

861
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:27,411
You can not do this.

862
01:11:27,517 --> 01:11:29,314
You should enjoy this moment.

863
01:11:29,419 --> 01:11:31,478
See, you're hard on yourself.

864
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:33,818
Vente.
Let's go.

865
01:11:33,924 --> 01:11:36,392
Amber. Amber.

866
01:11:37,594 --> 01:11:39,255
Amber??

867
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,959
The finals
are the best of the best.

868
01:11:45,068 --> 01:11:46,296
The greatest of the great,

869
01:11:46,403 --> 01:11:50,737
so for many who
much is at stake.

870
01:12:14,564 --> 01:12:16,464
She is very talented

871
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:18,033
and is beautiful.

872
01:12:18,135 --> 01:12:21,298
If you put it all together in
this lovely package,

873
01:12:21,405 --> 01:12:23,669
has everything going for it.

874
01:12:24,408 --> 01:12:26,467
The difficult thing for a dancer
right now

875
01:12:26,576 --> 01:12:29,636
is the fact that there
very little employment.

876
01:12:29,746 --> 01:12:34,149
With this in mind,
just follow your dream.

877
01:12:54,237 --> 01:12:55,829
It felt good.

878
01:12:59,776 --> 01:13:01,835
Some girls,
how they work,

879
01:13:01,945 --> 01:13:03,503
really are pointed.

880
01:13:03,613 --> 01:13:04,841
Present your foot.

881
01:13:04,948 --> 01:13:06,176
They turn

882
01:13:06,283 --> 01:13:08,945
and are very accurate.

883
01:13:12,723 --> 01:13:14,782
Many of them have
a facility,

884
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:16,882
a body, feet
and wonderful legs.

885
01:13:19,096 --> 01:13:20,324
You see them and say:

886
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:21,488
'' She does have that something.

887
01:13:21,598 --> 01:13:23,532
She's going to win.''

888
01:13:35,612 --> 01:13:40,515
Everyone is looking
combinations body

889
01:13:40,617 --> 01:13:44,849
training, passion
and personality.

890
01:13:55,332 --> 01:13:56,560
It is very rare.

891
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:58,998
It is one in a million.

892
01:14:03,807 --> 01:14:06,207
It is assumed that I have to see me
as Spanish.

893
01:14:06,309 --> 01:14:11,372
lmagino in Spain
have curly hair,

894
01:14:11,481 --> 01:14:15,542
so,
yes, I'm getting these.

895
01:14:19,056 --> 01:14:20,284
I'm half.

896
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:21,448
Half?

897
01:14:21,558 --> 01:14:22,718
Yes.

898
01:14:45,749 --> 01:14:48,149
Well, I feel butterflies.

899
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:50,879
Sometimes I have to go
to pee, but okay.

900
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:52,079
Right now no.

901
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:55,048
Good Luck.

Excuse me, sorry.

<i> La fille mal gardée </ i>.

913

Everyone is watching.

914
01:17:24,441 --> 01:17:25,669
You feel nervous.

915
01:17:25,775 --> 01:17:27,504
It's like:'' Oh, my God,
I'm here.

916
01:17:27,611 --> 01:17:29,010
I have to. I do''.

917
01:17:29,112 --> 01:17:32,013
You start feeling
exciting thing

918
01:17:32,115 --> 01:17:33,605
and then just dance.

could stunt my tendon

922
01:19:04,474 --> 01:19:07,136
and ruin the rest
of my career.

923
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:16,080
My teachers know
I'm not going to stop.

924
01:19:16,186 --> 01:19:17,744
Even when injured,
still in pain,

925
01:19:17,854 --> 01:19:20,687
even when sick,
continue dancing.

Fall <i> fast </ i>.

928
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:07,624
It hurt so much.

929
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:10,631
Seriously, I thought it was not going
be able to do any of this.

930
01:21:10,733 --> 01:21:13,827
I just had to remove
all bounds.

931
01:21:13,937 --> 01:21:15,234
I was so nervous,

932
01:21:15,338 --> 01:21:18,171
not even I realized
I had an injury.

933
01:21:18,274 --> 01:21:19,332
I forgot.

934
01:21:22,278 --> 01:21:24,337
I held my breath
all times.

935
01:21:24,447 --> 01:21:25,505
Did you like it?

936
01:21:25,615 --> 01:21:26,843

It was great.

but what I can see in five

and personality.

949
01:22:07,757 --> 01:22:09,691
They are some of the things
I'm looking for

950
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:12,727
and hunger
and the need to dance.

She was like:'' What?''.

Oh, my God.

982

Until now understood
what happened!

983

I am very proud of you.

985
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:41,698
You sores everywhere.

986
01:25:43,473 --> 01:25:45,703
In the junior division,

987
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:48,868

'' Medals.
Miko and Michaela Division''

989
01:25:52,849 --> 01:25:55,841
In the women's category ...

990
01:25:57,286 --> 01:25:58,617
I'm not sure
hearing

991
01:25:58,721 --> 01:26:01,451
a girl 2 years 1 win.

992
01:26:01,557 --> 01:26:03,957
I'm not expecting much.

993
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:05,357
The bronze medal,

994
01:26:06,729 --> 01:26:08,287
Miko Fogarty.

995
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:19,805
That is small.

996
01:26:20,176 --> 01:26:23,441
Yes, hard work rewarded.
Hard work rewarded.

997
01:26:24,781 --> 01:26:27,944
I'm super happy
and it's amazing.

998
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:31,611
I think I heard a scream Viktor
in the public

999
01:26:31,721 --> 01:26:34,053
when they said my name.

1000
01:26:34,157 --> 01:26:36,717
I can not believe.
I do not know.

1001
01:26:36,826 --> 01:26:39,818
Really,
I can not believe.

1002
01:27:05,154 --> 01:27:08,988
Here are our winners
junior division.

1003
01:27:16,432 --> 01:27:18,400
Expect much this time

1004
01:27:18,501 --> 01:27:20,059
and have an expectation
as high

1005
01:27:20,169 --> 01:27:23,070
it can change your career.

1006
01:27:23,172 --> 01:27:25,367
Today we are creating the future.

1007
01:27:25,474 --> 01:27:26,941
Some of the dancers
receive

1008
01:27:27,043 --> 01:27:28,476
professional practice or
work

1009
01:27:28,578 --> 01:27:31,172
with some ballet companies
represented here.

1010
01:27:33,249 --> 01:27:34,477
What Rebecca is looking

1011
01:27:34,584 --> 01:27:37,917
is the opportunity for a
position in a company.

1012
01:27:56,873 --> 01:28:01,606
Let's give them a round of applause
to all our winners.

1013
01:28:01,711 --> 01:28:05,010
Rebecca'' did not receive an offer
'' contract.

1014
01:28:06,749 --> 01:28:09,479
The most important
to win scholarships.

1015
01:28:09,585 --> 01:28:11,883
Most young people come to
become known in the future,

1016
01:28:11,988 --> 01:28:13,182
but higher come

1017
01:28:13,289 --> 01:28:15,018
because they want to win these scholarships

1018

1023
01:28:43,953 --> 01:28:48,856
I always think of the little
girl who was so ill,

1024
01:28:48,958 --> 01:28:51,449
I did not think he was going to
bring home alive.

1025
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:57,230
ABT I want now.

1026

01:29:29,498 --> 01:29:31,830
My life will change.

Also I love you.
Goodbye.

1034
01:30:20,516 --> 01:30:21,949
God.
Look at my parking lot.

1035
01:30:22,051 --> 01:30:23,348
Yes.

1036
01:30:23,452 --> 01:30:29,015
'' After the competition,
Rebecca graduated from high school.''

1037
01:30:35,164 --> 01:30:38,998
'' Two months later, a judge
Washington Ballet called.''

1041
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:57,180
Lower your shoulders.

1042
01:30:57,286 --> 01:30:59,220
Yes, well.

1043
01:30:59,789 --> 01:31:04,658
Requires stretching classes
extreme special.

1044
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:06,159
It is so sore that

1045
01:31:06,262 --> 01:31:10,528
is difficult to put my knees
together in first position.

1046
01:31:12,401 --> 01:31:14,562
My mom says that if you have
a knack

1047
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:15,898
as ballet or something,

1048
01:31:16,005 --> 01:31:18,439
the only way to enter the Ivy
League schools such as Harvard

1049
01:31:18,541 --> 01:31:21,601
or M.l.T.
is being really ready.

1050
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:24,008
So I got all these
workbooks.

1051
01:31:25,848 --> 01:31:27,873

with his family.''

1053
01:31:32,521 --> 01:31:35,649
'' His foot has healed.''

1054
01:31:35,758 --> 01:31:37,988
Once it is
a professional dancer,

1055
01:31:38,094 --> 01:31:39,322
I want to return to Sierra Leone

1056
01:31:39,428 --> 01:31:41,157
and open a dance school

1057
01:31:41,263 --> 01:31:44,289
so that other children have
the experience I had.

Strong arms.
Keep the second position.

1065
01:32:49,498 --> 01:32:53,400
I'm in London now
at the Royal Ballet.

1066
01:32:53,502 --> 01:32:56,027
I can complete my dream.

1067
01:32:56,138 --> 01:33:00,905
I want to be the main
or solo in a company.
