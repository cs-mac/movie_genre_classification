1
00:00:04,426 --> 00:00:06,529
<i>The defendant, Uri Denko,</i>

2
00:00:06,532 --> 00:00:08,608
and two associates,
invaded the home

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,943
of Boris and Irina Ostrovsky.

4
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:13,713
Mr. Ostrovsky had refused
to make Mr. Denko

5
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:17,299
a partner in his
diamond importing business.

6
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:20,052
Mr. Denko decided
he was going to change

7
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:24,840
Mr. Ostrovsky's mind--
at gunpoint.

8
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:28,644
When Mr. Ostrovsky still refused
to cooperate,

9
00:00:28,646 --> 00:00:31,797
the defendant put that gun

10
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:34,183
to the head of Irina Ostrovsky

11
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:36,152
and pulled the trigger.

12
00:00:36,154 --> 00:00:41,107
Boris Ostrovsky's beloved wife
died in his arms,

13
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:44,744
while their two children
slept upstairs.

14
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:48,698
The people will present
indisputable evidence

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,032
of this heinous crime,

16
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:55,204
including eyewitness testimony
from Boris Ostrovsky.

17
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,191
And then I will ask you
to do your duty...

18
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,346
...convict Uri Denko of murder.

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,135
Are the People prepared
to proceed?

20
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:10,186
We are, Your Honor.

21
00:01:10,188 --> 00:01:12,805
The People call Boris Ostrovsky.

22
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,783
The witness will be sworn in.

23
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:27,019
Raise your right hand.

24
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:28,120
Do you solemnly swear or affirm

25
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:30,489
that the testimony
you are about to give

26
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:32,708
is the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

27
00:01:36,414 --> 00:01:37,079
Counselor...

28
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:39,799
Your Honor...

29
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:44,720
One more word and you're
in contempt, Mr. Denko.

30
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:51,761
Please repeat the oath.

31
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:52,845
Do you solemnly swear or affirm

32
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:54,313
that the testimony
you are about to give

33
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:56,715
is the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

34
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:02,271
Your Honor, a moment
with the witness.

35
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:11,113
Boris, it's okay.
All right?

36
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:12,397
Calm down.

37
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:15,334
This man is an animal.

38
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:19,404
He threatened my children...

39
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,423
Your children are in Los Angeles
with your brother,

40
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:23,092
and LAPD has been notified.

41
00:02:23,094 --> 00:02:24,260
They are safe.

42
00:02:24,262 --> 00:02:26,462
You don't know that.

43
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,918
They're all I have left.

44
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:40,425
Your Honor,
the People request a recess.

45
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:46,782
A.D.A. Reagan!
A.D.A. Reagan!

46
00:02:46,784 --> 00:02:48,234
A.D.A. Reagan!
Miss Reagan!

47
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:49,368
A.D.A. Reagan,
are you concerned about

48
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,287
the state of mind
of your eyewitness?

49
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:52,154
Not at all.

50
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:53,372
He was clearly shaken

51
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:54,606
by the defendant's
courtroom outburst.

52
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:57,376
Mr. Denko's conduct
was outrageous

53
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,128
and he was reprimanded
by the judge.

54
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,629
Mr. Denko has
escaped conviction

55
00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:02,248
on two
previous murder indictments.

56
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,300
Do you really expect
a different result this time?

57
00:03:04,302 --> 00:03:07,219
Mr. Denko is a notorious
organized crime figure

58
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:10,389
who is responsible
for executing an innocent woman.

59
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:11,623
I expect justice.

60
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,758
Some have speculated

61
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,643
that your office
rushed this case to trial.

62
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:15,811
Are you worried that
you don't have enough evidence

63
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:16,896
for a conviction?

64
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:18,564
We have truth on our side.

65
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:20,299
That is all the evidence
we need.

66
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:22,467
A source from inside
the D.A.'s office says heads will roll

67
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:23,485
if Denko walks.
Mr. Mayor.

68
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:24,520
How do you respond?
Frank.

69
00:03:24,522 --> 00:03:25,905
I don't respond to...

70
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:28,490
That daughter of yours sure
knows how to work the camera.

71
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:31,243
Taught her everything she knows.

72
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:33,996
Think she can nail Denko?

73
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:35,664
Well, the case is sound,

74
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,533
and she's
an excellent prosecutor.

75
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:40,319
Not much on the agenda.

76
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,704
Our city slept soundly
last night.

77
00:03:41,706 --> 00:03:44,823
Deputy Mayor Glazer is
resigning.

78
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,325
He's taking a job
in Albany.

79
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:48,544
Well, we're sure gonna miss him.

80
00:03:48,546 --> 00:03:51,513
Listen, I'm the first to admit
Ron could be a little intrusive.

81
00:03:51,515 --> 00:03:53,349
The guy must have sent me
50 memos

82
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:55,885
on energy-efficient
window treatments at One P.P.

83
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:58,337
I guess you won't be attending
the farewell party.

84
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,005
Well, I wouldn't want
to get emotional.

85
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,641
We'll have a little party of
our own to mark the occasion.

86
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:05,527
Look, Frank,
I have a name in mind,

87
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:07,646
but I wanted
to run it by you first.

88
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,650
You want my opinion
on a political appointment?

89
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:12,601
Well, as you know,

90
00:04:12,603 --> 00:04:14,870
Deputy Mayor for Operations

91
00:04:14,872 --> 00:04:18,357
is my liaison for all the city's
essential agencies.

92
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,075
I want to make sure
you two

93
00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:21,410
have a good working
relationship.

94
00:04:21,412 --> 00:04:22,661
This someone I know?

95
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,230
Actually...

96
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:28,200
...you know her quite well.

97
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:37,376
She's a star, Frank.

98
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:39,461
She's smart, she's tough.

99
00:04:39,463 --> 00:04:40,930
The D.A. raves about her work.

100
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:42,798
You must be very proud.

101
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,600
I am.

102
00:04:44,602 --> 00:04:46,268
Listen, I know
what you're thinking--

103
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,937
that this is
a conflict of interest,

104
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:51,273
but as far as I am concerned,
you're both professionals

105
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:53,275
working in the best
interests of the city.

106
00:04:53,277 --> 00:04:54,526
Am I right?

107
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,528
Of course.

108
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,980
Good, Frank.

109
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:02,067
Very good.

110
00:05:07,924 --> 00:05:09,625
Finish your essay?

111
00:05:09,627 --> 00:05:12,761
My conclusion's
still kinda clunky.

112
00:05:12,763 --> 00:05:14,630
You want me to
take a look at it?

113
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:16,665
Want me to take a look
at your closing argument?

114
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:19,335
Well, that would be tough since
I haven't written it yet.

115
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:22,587
Didn't you say you can't
have a good opening argument

116
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,922
until you know
your closing argument?

117
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,057
Well, I know it.

118
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,175
I just haven't written it yet.

119
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:28,043
Kinda thin, counselor.

120
00:05:29,145 --> 00:05:32,014
I'm certainly glad that
you are not on the jury.

121
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,485
Yeah.

122
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,439
I'll be right down.

123
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,075
Everything okay?

124
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:44,943
No. I gotta go to work.

125
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:50,666
All right, let's get
a canvass going.

126
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:52,468
I want a three-block canvass
of the neighborhood.

127
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,339
You got it.

128
00:05:53,364 --> 00:05:54,504
Find out what the hell
happened to this guy.

129
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:55,554
What happened?

130
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:56,788
What happened?!

131
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,891
Well, Ostrovsky told the
uniforms that were guarding him

132
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:00,426
that he changed his
mind about testifying.

133
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:01,977
Said he wanted to go
home and see his kids.

134
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:02,928
Now look at him.

135
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,730
I calmed him down
after court.

136
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:05,848
He was okay when I--

137
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,317
Well, apparently,
he wasn't okay, Sis.

138
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,135
He spoke to
his brother in L.A.

139
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,770
The guy was getting
strange phone calls.

140
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,405
Ostrovsky heard
and he took off.

141
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:14,690
And no one tried
to stop him?

142
00:06:14,692 --> 00:06:15,858
Who's gonna stop him?

143
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,975
He declined police protection.

144
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,694
We have no right to hold him.

145
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:21,997
Uniforms tried to
follow him, they lost him.

146
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:23,882
20 minutes later,
he's dead.

147
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,285
Denko's crew was probably
sitting on his place.

148
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:31,590
Any witnesses?

149
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,375
Still canvassing,
but nothing yet.

150
00:06:33,377 --> 00:06:36,378
Still gonna be able to make your
case without his testimony?

151
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,498
Denko's accomplices
fled the country.

152
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,716
I mean, I've got neighbors

153
00:06:40,718 --> 00:06:42,885
who heard the gunshot,
saw the car;

154
00:06:42,887 --> 00:06:44,636
I've got physical evidence,
but without a witness, I...

155
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:45,921
Hold on. Look,

156
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:47,272
we've been working with
the Joint Task Force

157
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,174
for three years,
trying to track Denko down.

158
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,142
This guy's
the biggest gun runner

159
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:51,310
and shakedown artist
in the city.

160
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:52,644
We can't let him just walk away.

161
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,113
We got him cold on a homicide!

162
00:06:54,115 --> 00:06:55,064
Yeah, I know!

163
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,198
Well, then you
should know this guy

164
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,649
is the angel of death!
Come on!

165
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,352
This guy practically laughed in
our faces when we cuffed him,

166
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:02,071
said we're never gonna
take him down.

167
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:04,456
Can't let this guy walk away.

We still have one shot
to nail Denko.

173

What, uh, shoot him
in his cell?

Sophia Babikov.

The nanny said
she was upstairs with the kids

177
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:48,485
the night the wife was murdered,

178
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:50,136
and didn't see anything
or hear anything.

179
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:51,654
She was scared to death.

180
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:54,240
Yeah, and I always thought she
knew more than she was saying,

181
00:07:54,242 --> 00:07:55,942
but I had Ostrovsky,
so I figured

182
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:57,694
why put her
in the middle of everything

183
00:07:57,696 --> 00:07:58,912
if I didn't have to?

184
00:07:58,914 --> 00:08:01,698
Well... now we have to.

185
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,071
Thank you for coming, Sophia.

186
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:10,507
The police didn't
give me much choice.

187
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:17,780
They killed Mr. Ostrovsky.

188
00:08:17,782 --> 00:08:19,766
I know.

189
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:21,367
That's why I needed to see you.

190
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:24,854
I told you,
I didn't see anything.

191
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:26,005
Come on, Sophia.

192
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:27,807
We know that Denko's crew
was in the house

193
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:29,058
for about 30 minutes.

194
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,678
Even the neighbors heard
screaming and a gunshot.

195
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,696
You want us to believe that
you didn't hear or see anything?

196
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,818
Look, Sophia, um...

197
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,454
what Detective Reagan is trying
to say is, uh,

198
00:08:41,456 --> 00:08:44,707
you know,
maybe you remember something now

199
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:46,776
that, uh, you didn't before.

200
00:08:48,746 --> 00:08:50,313
I know you're
scared, Sophia.

201
00:08:50,315 --> 00:08:52,882
Uri Denko's hurt
a lot of people.

202
00:08:52,884 --> 00:08:54,700
And he's gonna continue
to hurt people,

203
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:58,171
unless we do something about it.

204
00:08:58,173 --> 00:09:02,541
But in order to do that, I need
you to tell me the truth.

205
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:16,522
I heard them break through
the back door.

206
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:21,394
I came downstairs...

207
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:25,081
just as they shot
Mrs. Ostrovsky.

208
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:31,070
They put... put
a gun to her head...

209
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:34,123
and killed her.

210
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:38,828
So you saw Uri Denko
shoot Mrs. Ostrovsky?

211
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,783
Yes.

212
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,271
The detectives are going to stay
with you, Sophia.

213
00:09:48,273 --> 00:09:50,523
They'll protect you
until you testify.

214
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:52,591
We're going to keep you safe.

215
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,195
Just like Mr. Ostrovsky?

216
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,136
<i>Deputy Mayor?</i>

217
00:10:03,138 --> 00:10:05,271
Wow.

218
00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:07,840
That's an incredible
opportunity.

219
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:09,575
Why me?

220
00:10:09,577 --> 00:10:11,828
I'm sure you have
more qualified candidates.

221
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,081
I want a fresh voice.

222
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:18,117
Someone smart... independent...

223
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:20,619
who gets things done.

224
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,505
I appreciate
the confidence.

225
00:10:22,507 --> 00:10:25,508
The Deputy Mayor of Operations
is my eyes and ears

226
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,510
in the major agencies: Police,

227
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:29,729
Fire, Emergency Management--
Sanitation.

228
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:31,014
I never said it was
all glamorous...

229
00:10:32,484 --> 00:10:33,799
Well, you do know that

230
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:35,068
I've never worked
in city government.

231
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,185
I've always been
a prosecutor.

232
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:37,553
That's exactly right.

233
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:41,474
You take a position, and you
convince a group of strangers

234
00:10:41,476 --> 00:10:43,142
to see things your way.

235
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:45,361
Yes, but these are not jurors.

236
00:10:45,363 --> 00:10:47,530
They're firemen,
paramedics, cops...

237
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:50,500
Your family is steeped
in city service.

238
00:10:50,502 --> 00:10:54,437
You speak the language.

239
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:55,605
And you don't back down.

240
00:10:55,607 --> 00:10:58,541
Would I have input on policy?

241
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:00,543
You'll be
in all the major meetings.

242
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:03,730
Working with the most powerful
people in the city.

243
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:06,683
Erin, you do a good job,

244
00:11:06,685 --> 00:11:08,935
you can write your own ticket.

245
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:14,023
I assume you've discussed this
with my father?

246
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:16,876
I have.
And he's very proud of you.

247
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:21,347
Well, then I have to ask,

248
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:24,817
by putting a Reagan in this job,

249
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:27,286
do you hope to
gain leverage with the NYPD?

250
00:11:27,288 --> 00:11:31,040
Would that be so bad?
Actually, yes.

251
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:34,377
I've never traded on the fact
that Frank Reagan is my father.

252
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:37,196
I'm not going to start now.

253
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:39,966
I'm very interested
in this job, sir.

254
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:43,052
But I need to know this offer
is not based on my last name.

255
00:11:43,054 --> 00:11:45,621
It isn't.

256
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:47,673
Okay.

257
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,894
Well, as you know,
I just started a trial.

258
00:11:51,896 --> 00:11:56,699
Can I have a few days?
Of course you can.

259
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,224
- Sarge?
- Yeah?

260
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:06,609
Sophia and the witness.

261
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:09,328
Hello, Sophia.
I'm Sergeant Gormley.

262
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,414
We're gonna take
good care of you.

263
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,731
Detective Torres and his partner

264
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,233
are gonna alternate
12-hour tours

265
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,285
with Detectives Curatola
and Reagan.

266
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:18,070
Yeah, they're not as
good-looking as us,

267
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,422
but they get the job done.

268
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:22,575
ATF Agent Schilling is gonna
coordinate logistics.

269
00:12:22,577 --> 00:12:26,262
I am worried about
my family in Russia.

270
00:12:26,264 --> 00:12:28,747
When this man finds out
I'm testifying...

271
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,801
ATF has reached out to the
embassy and Russian authorities.

272
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:33,219
Your family will be protected.

273
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:35,921
You're doing the right thing.

274
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:39,809
Yeah, we're going to
take good care of you.

275
00:12:41,612 --> 00:12:42,812
I take it you need me.

276
00:12:42,814 --> 00:12:44,930
Thought you might
like some good news.

277
00:12:45,816 --> 00:12:47,567
Glazer's history.

278
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:51,154
I know that.
Oh.

279
00:12:51,156 --> 00:12:53,623
Well, next time you talk
to the Mayor,

280
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,542
thank him for removing that
particular pain in my ass.

281
00:12:56,544 --> 00:12:59,662
Yeah, well, at least
Glazer was controllable,

282
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:01,230
the mayor's
replacement won't be.

283
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:03,149
He's picked
a replacement already?

284
00:13:03,151 --> 00:13:05,134
Oh, yeah.

285
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,787
Erin.

286
00:13:09,257 --> 00:13:11,090
Seriously?
Yeah.

287
00:13:11,092 --> 00:13:12,291
Oh.

288
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:13,893
Jim Erin's a pushover.

289
00:13:13,895 --> 00:13:16,646
No-- Erin.

290
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,216
Your Erin?

291
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:21,934
Yeah.

292
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:24,654
Oh, boy.

293
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:27,824
Well, she'd be twice
the DMO Glazer was.

294
00:13:27,826 --> 00:13:29,108
Yeah, so would a houseplant.

295
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,276
I didn't mean that Erin was--

296
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:33,246
I know what you meant.
You know I love Erin.

297
00:13:33,248 --> 00:13:34,580
But not for this.

298
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:37,917
The DMO is by definition an
adversary of this office.

299
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,286
Yeah, he'd be paying her
to go up against me.

300
00:13:40,288 --> 00:13:42,555
What do you think
he's up to?

301
00:13:42,557 --> 00:13:44,707
I'm not sure, I don't know
whether he's declaring war

302
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:46,825
or trying to make peace,
but either way the guy

303
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,961
doesn't brush his teeth
without an agenda.

304
00:13:48,963 --> 00:13:51,681
But never one that hits
this close to home.

305
00:13:51,683 --> 00:13:53,599
Yeah.

306
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:54,800
My home.

307
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:56,886
What are you going
to do to stop it?

308
00:13:58,022 --> 00:14:01,357
I don't know.

309
00:14:08,565 --> 00:14:10,700
I didn't say
it was your fault,

310
00:14:10,702 --> 00:14:12,785
but the AC's pumping out heat
and it won't stop.

311
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:15,104
It's like a coming attraction
for hell up here.

312
00:14:15,106 --> 00:14:16,873
Okay, thank you.

313
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,211
AC's on the fritz;
repairman's on his way up.

314
00:14:22,213 --> 00:14:24,964
Well, least it saves me
a trip to the gym.

315
00:14:24,966 --> 00:14:27,250
Tell me about it.
She fall asleep?

316
00:14:27,252 --> 00:14:28,584
Yeah.

317
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:30,553
Oh, really now?

318
00:14:30,555 --> 00:14:32,388
What's that,
your boyfriend again?

319
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,640
Yeah. Paul.

320
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:36,292
Oh, sorry. Paul.

321
00:14:36,294 --> 00:14:38,644
Now he's saying
he doesn't even think

322
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:40,513
I wanted to go to
Atlantic City this weekend.

323
00:14:40,515 --> 00:14:42,648
He does realize that
you have to work, right?

324
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,850
Uh, yeah, he obviously
does not care.

325
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:46,981
Hm, well, he sounds
like a real keeper.

326
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:50,072
He is.
Hm.

327
00:14:50,074 --> 00:14:52,942
He is.
Mm-hmm.

328
00:14:52,944 --> 00:14:54,744
Maybe, I don't know.
Yeah, maybe.

329
00:14:54,746 --> 00:14:57,229
No, he just,
he does not get the job.

330
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:01,567
You want, I should, you know,
go have a talk with him?

331
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:04,203
Oh, yes, Dr. Phil, please.

332
00:15:04,205 --> 00:15:05,705
Go have a talk with him.

333
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:07,707
Because the last guy,
Derek the Dentist,

334
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,575
you had a talk with him
and he fled the state.

335
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:11,594
Yeah, well, Derek
the Dentist was a shmuck

336
00:15:11,596 --> 00:15:12,795
and he wasn't
good enough for you.

337
00:15:12,797 --> 00:15:14,597
Well, Paul
is good enough for me.

338
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:16,515
He just, he's just pissed
that I have to

339
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:18,239
spend the weekend with you
instead of him.

340
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,930
Well...

341
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:20,604
Tell him there's nothing
to be jealous about.

342
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,976
Maintenance.

343
00:15:26,978 --> 00:15:28,644
Hey.

344
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:34,700
Slide your I.D. under
the door please, sir.

345
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:47,279
Police, turn around.
I'm just here to fix the heat.

346
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,281
I have to search you, sir.
Turn around.

347
00:15:57,307 --> 00:15:59,091
All right, hold that.

348
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:01,260
I got it.

349
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:04,730
He's clean, Jack.

350
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:06,965
Come in and get that air
conditioner fixed quick, all right?

351
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:10,987
All right. It'll just take me a minute.
I got it.

352
00:16:14,324 --> 00:16:16,025
It's too hot to sleep.

353
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:17,743
Okay, uh, well,
we're fixing it now.

354
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:18,961
Stay back here.

355
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:23,165
You electric workers' union?

356
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:25,618
Uh, yeah, about three years.

357
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,819
Mm-hmm.

358
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:28,987
I got a cousin in Local Three.

359
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,589
They take good care
of you guys, don't they?

360
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,875
Oh, yeah.

361
00:16:32,877 --> 00:16:35,333
Trouble is that's a welder's
union patch on your shirt.

362
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:36,496
Not an electrical.

363
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:37,847
Get your hands off the gun!

364
00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:39,098
Drop it!

365
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,466
Get down here or I'll
air-condition your head.

366
00:16:40,468 --> 00:16:42,018
Spread 'em!

367
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,469
Jackie!

368
00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:44,503
Yeah.

369
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:45,838
We gotta move-- now!

370
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,857
Get her outta here.

371
00:16:52,229 --> 00:16:54,613
All right, move.

372
00:16:56,117 --> 00:16:58,200
You said I'd be safe.
Where are you taking me?

373
00:16:58,202 --> 00:16:59,685
Relax, Sophia,
you're gonna be okay.

374
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:00,936
Stay right there.

375
00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:05,958
All right, move.

376
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,660
Come on.

377
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:10,996
Come on.

378
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:13,165
What do you think? We gotta
call this in, get a new location.

379
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,167
We can't do it.
We gotta go off the grid.

380
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:16,469
Stay.

381
00:17:19,756 --> 00:17:21,090
All right, come on.

382
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:22,808
Go.

383
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,511
Right here.

384
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:26,896
What are you thinking?

385
00:17:26,898 --> 00:17:29,047
The only people who knew
we were gonna be in that room

386
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,900
with Sophia are the people
on the task force,

387
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:33,152
and somebody planted that gun
before we got there.

388
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:34,470
Think we got a leak?

389
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:35,821
It's the only explanation.

390
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:37,106
Look, your place
is close by, right?

391
00:17:37,108 --> 00:17:38,724
Can we take her there?
Yeah.

392
00:17:52,392 --> 00:17:53,792
Hey.
Hi.

393
00:17:53,794 --> 00:17:55,094
Dinner?

394
00:17:55,096 --> 00:17:56,279
Yeah.

395
00:17:57,314 --> 00:18:01,517
I have pork chops
and asparagus,

396
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:03,820
and Linda is doing
the potatoes.

397
00:18:03,822 --> 00:18:05,137
You look nice.

398
00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:08,908
Thanks. Ostrovsky's funeral
is in a half hour,

399
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,809
so... just thought
I should attend.

400
00:18:10,811 --> 00:18:12,578
Good for you.

401
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,980
Where are you off to?

402
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:17,149
Oh, I got a speech
at the academy.

403
00:18:21,705 --> 00:18:25,491
You think we should talk about
this deputy mayor thing?

404
00:18:25,493 --> 00:18:26,792
Yeah.

405
00:18:26,794 --> 00:18:28,511
It sure came out of left field.

406
00:18:28,513 --> 00:18:30,263
Yeah.

407
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:33,516
Maybe after dinner.

408
00:18:33,518 --> 00:18:34,984
That'd be good.

409
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,836
Okay, it's a date.

410
00:18:37,838 --> 00:18:39,138
Works for me.

411
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,640
Oh, I forgot the applesauce.

412
00:18:40,642 --> 00:18:42,058
I'll pick it up on the way back.

413
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,476
Anyway, thank you.

414
00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:44,677
See you at dinner.

415
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:46,679
Yeah, knock 'em dead.

416
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,170
All right, so how do you want
to play this, Sarge?

417
00:18:56,323 --> 00:18:58,241
I alerted
the Chief of D's directly.

418
00:18:58,243 --> 00:19:01,377
No one on the task force knows
what went down.

419
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:02,879
Except the son of a bitch
tipping off Denko.

420
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:04,163
Exactly.

421
00:19:04,165 --> 00:19:05,197
I got personnel files

422
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:06,449
on the whole team.

423
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:08,200
All these guys got
time on the job.

424
00:19:08,202 --> 00:19:10,002
It won't be easy
to I.D. the leak.

425
00:19:10,004 --> 00:19:11,671
All right,

426
00:19:11,673 --> 00:19:13,806
Jack's gonna sit on the witness.
I'm gonna head into the squad.

427
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:14,974
All right.

428
00:19:14,976 --> 00:19:17,960
Okay, everything looks secure.

429
00:19:17,962 --> 00:19:20,346
And it's a very nice place,
by the way.

430
00:19:20,348 --> 00:19:22,615
Yeah, where'd you think,
I lived in a cave?

431
00:19:22,617 --> 00:19:25,735
No, I just didn't expect it
to be so girly.

432
00:19:25,737 --> 00:19:27,253
Well, I am a girl, Reagan.

433
00:19:27,255 --> 00:19:28,738
I know.

434
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,156
Ooh. Hello.

435
00:19:30,158 --> 00:19:31,223
Yeah, it's me

436
00:19:31,225 --> 00:19:33,109
and my cousin Andrea
in Boca.

437
00:19:33,111 --> 00:19:34,994
Mm! Well, that confirms
the girly part.

438
00:19:34,996 --> 00:19:36,946
All right, I'm gonna
head to the squad.

439
00:19:36,948 --> 00:19:38,447
If you so much as hear a peep,

440
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:39,865
put it over the air,
all right?

441
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:42,451
And do not open that door
for a soul.

442
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:43,953
No.

443
00:19:52,562 --> 00:19:54,397
Here you go.

444
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,253
Wow.

445
00:20:01,255 --> 00:20:03,306
You're very good.

446
00:20:05,592 --> 00:20:09,478
They're the woods
behind my mother's house.

447
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,963
When I was a little girl,

448
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:13,232
I named all these trees.

449
00:20:13,234 --> 00:20:15,234
So you think you'll
go back there after all this?

450
00:20:15,236 --> 00:20:16,769
Maybe.

451
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:19,288
If I'm still alive.

452
00:20:20,273 --> 00:20:23,442
You'll still be alive.

453
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:28,164
Eight people on the task force
had advance knowledge

454
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,749
of Sophia's location, right?

455
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:32,284
Out of our guys, I'm gonna give
me, you, and Jackie a pass.

456
00:20:32,286 --> 00:20:34,220
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

457
00:20:34,222 --> 00:20:36,339
Okay, that leaves Torres
out of our guys.

458
00:20:36,341 --> 00:20:38,641
According to his file, he worked
for O-CID for three years,

459
00:20:38,643 --> 00:20:39,759
including the Russian Mob.

460
00:20:39,761 --> 00:20:42,011
Maybe they got
their hooks in him.

461
00:20:42,013 --> 00:20:43,813
Guy's a decorated cop.
It ain't him.

462
00:20:43,815 --> 00:20:45,130
So was Tommy Delacorte.

463
00:20:45,132 --> 00:20:47,933
Now he's doing a dime
for a RICO case, Sarge.

464
00:20:47,935 --> 00:20:49,485
I don't know.

465
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:50,903
All right, well, what do you got
on the four ATF guys?

466
00:20:50,905 --> 00:20:53,322
We have Brookner, Schilling,

467
00:20:53,324 --> 00:20:55,491
Moncrieff and Isherman.

468
00:20:55,493 --> 00:20:56,942
They're all clean.

469
00:20:56,944 --> 00:20:59,078
They're sending OPR
to help us out.

470
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,162
Great.

471
00:21:00,164 --> 00:21:02,615
One of ours selling out.
Makes me sick.

472
00:21:02,617 --> 00:21:03,532
We'll get 'em.

473
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:10,823
Sophia's okay.

474
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:12,324
What the hell is going on?

475
00:21:12,326 --> 00:21:14,293
We're pretty sure
Denko's got an informant

476
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:15,761
inside the task force.

477
00:21:15,763 --> 00:21:17,963
Oh, well, that's just great.
Who the hell is it?

478
00:21:17,965 --> 00:21:19,048
We don't know yet.

479
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,033
Where's Sophia?

480
00:21:21,035 --> 00:21:22,852
She's fine.
She's stashed away with Jackie.

481
00:21:22,854 --> 00:21:25,471
I've already lost one eyewitness
in this case.

482
00:21:25,473 --> 00:21:27,556
I do not intend
to lose another one.

483
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:29,141
Right.

484
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:31,923
We need to get ESU in
for tactical support.

485
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:32,449
Whoa.

486
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:34,314
The situation's
under control, counselor.

487
00:21:34,315 --> 00:21:35,731
Really? You could've fooled me.

488
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:36,899
Look, come on.

489
00:21:36,901 --> 00:21:38,484
Bringing in more badges
just creates

490
00:21:38,486 --> 00:21:41,520
more opportunity for Denko
to get inside information.

491
00:21:41,522 --> 00:21:43,122
You gotta trust me on this one.

492
00:21:43,124 --> 00:21:44,657
This poor girl is scared
to death.

493
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:46,125
I know.
She trusted me.

494
00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:47,993
I put her life in your hands.

495
00:21:47,995 --> 00:21:49,295
I know.

496
00:21:51,331 --> 00:21:53,532
You better keep her alive.

497
00:21:57,036 --> 00:21:59,889
Guess you avoided
pissing her off growing up, huh?

498
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:01,090
Yeah.

499
00:22:01,092 --> 00:22:02,875
The problem is she's right.

500
00:22:06,396 --> 00:22:08,347
How'd the lecture go?

501
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:09,598
Tough to tell.

502
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,217
Even when I stink,
they give me a standing O.

503
00:22:12,219 --> 00:22:13,719
It's good to be the king.

504
00:22:13,721 --> 00:22:15,688
So, let's hear it.

505
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,189
What?

506
00:22:19,076 --> 00:22:21,226
We been working together
too long.

507
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:23,696
John Damiano.

508
00:22:23,698 --> 00:22:25,748
City Commissioner over at
Environmental Protection.

509
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,566
I've met him. Good man.

510
00:22:27,568 --> 00:22:28,951
Why am I holding his resume?

511
00:22:28,953 --> 00:22:33,205
Damiano is the consensus choice
of the agencies for DMO.

512
00:22:33,207 --> 00:22:36,425
They like him,
and he knows the turf.

513
00:22:36,427 --> 00:22:38,294
If they move forward,

514
00:22:38,296 --> 00:22:40,179
our little problem goes away.

515
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:42,932
Poole drops Erin in order
to preserve his relationship

516
00:22:42,934 --> 00:22:44,433
with the chiefs.

517
00:22:44,435 --> 00:22:46,702
And my name
never gets mentioned?

518
00:22:46,704 --> 00:22:48,087
That's right.

519
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:49,922
Pretty elegant solution.

520
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,611
The chiefs can do
whatever they think's right.

521
00:22:56,814 --> 00:22:59,148
I have no idea
what the mayor's up to,

522
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,317
but if he wants Erin,
he's gonna get her.

523
00:23:02,602 --> 00:23:04,987
She's my kid.

524
00:23:06,072 --> 00:23:08,324
You're a good dad.

525
00:23:08,326 --> 00:23:10,659
Don't remind me.

526
00:23:14,582 --> 00:23:16,966
Yeah, I understand.

527
00:23:16,968 --> 00:23:19,451
Thanks for your time,
Captain.

528
00:23:19,453 --> 00:23:21,137
Torres checks out clean.

529
00:23:21,139 --> 00:23:23,305
They all do.
I know.

530
00:23:23,307 --> 00:23:24,840
There's only one way
we're gonna find this leak.

531
00:23:24,842 --> 00:23:25,925
What, you wanna
put them in a room?

532
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:27,193
We got no choice.

533
00:23:27,195 --> 00:23:28,427
Come on, Sarge, they're cops.

534
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:30,729
They're not gonna fold
under questioning.

535
00:23:30,731 --> 00:23:33,349
Okay, we can call Denko's crew,
ask them which one of our guys

536
00:23:33,351 --> 00:23:35,133
is playing
for their team.

537
00:23:35,135 --> 00:23:37,653
You may be on to
something there.

538
00:23:37,655 --> 00:23:39,772
What are you talking about?

539
00:23:39,774 --> 00:23:41,974
Two birds, one stone.

540
00:23:45,912 --> 00:23:47,363
Sophia, food is here.

541
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:50,482
Uh, can't say much
about the borscht,

542
00:23:50,484 --> 00:23:53,452
but the, uh,
pierogies smell good.

543
00:23:54,604 --> 00:23:56,088
Hey, are you okay?

544
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,240
Did you speak to your aunt?

545
00:23:58,242 --> 00:24:02,595
The police had to move my mother
from her village in Russia.

546
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:06,131
Denko's guys were
looking for her.

547
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:07,383
I have to go home.

548
00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:08,834
Sophia, you can't do that.

549
00:24:08,836 --> 00:24:10,002
Yes, I can.

550
00:24:10,004 --> 00:24:12,304
I know the law.
I'm not under arrest.

551
00:24:12,306 --> 00:24:14,006
The subpoena says only

552
00:24:14,008 --> 00:24:16,275
that I must
be in court Monday.

553
00:24:16,277 --> 00:24:18,777
Yes, but you can't testify
from another continent.

554
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:20,563
I'm sorry. I have to go.

555
00:24:20,565 --> 00:24:21,931
Whoa, okay. Wait, whoa-whoa.

556
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:23,132
S-S-Sophia, listen to me.

557
00:24:23,134 --> 00:24:25,618
Denko pulled the same stuff
on Ostrovsky.

558
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,820
He threatened his children,
and the man was so scared

559
00:24:27,822 --> 00:24:30,489
he came out of hiding, and when
he did, they killed him.

560
00:24:30,491 --> 00:24:33,792
So I should let this man
kill my mother?!

561
00:24:33,794 --> 00:24:35,527
The authorities will
protect her.

562
00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:37,213
You don't know that.

563
00:24:37,215 --> 00:24:38,581
What I do know is if you leave,

564
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,699
they will kill you
before you get to the airport.

565
00:24:40,701 --> 00:24:42,218
I should never have agreed
to testify.

566
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,470
My aunt told me
not to get involved.

567
00:24:44,472 --> 00:24:45,921
But you got involved!

568
00:24:45,923 --> 00:24:48,924
You got involved because you are
strong and you are brave,

569
00:24:48,926 --> 00:24:50,509
and you are tired of running

570
00:24:50,511 --> 00:24:52,845
from men like Denko.

571
00:24:54,598 --> 00:24:58,734
The only way scum like that wins
is if you leave.

572
00:25:01,137 --> 00:25:03,055
I'll help you.

573
00:25:05,276 --> 00:25:06,692
I know.

574
00:25:07,744 --> 00:25:09,411
It's okay.

575
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:12,230
I know.

576
00:25:25,181 --> 00:25:29,768
Mmm, these potatoes
are amazing.

577
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,653
Yeah, I threw in a little cream
and gorgonzola.

578
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:35,006
So much for
a heart-healthy Sunday dinner.

579
00:25:35,008 --> 00:25:37,291
I made a plain batch for Henry.

580
00:25:37,293 --> 00:25:40,345
Oh, yeah? Good luck with that.

581
00:25:40,347 --> 00:25:43,848
So where are you
on the mayor's job offer?

582
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,134
Still reeling.

583
00:25:46,136 --> 00:25:48,236
It sounds like
an amazing opportunity.

584
00:25:48,238 --> 00:25:50,355
It is.

585
00:25:50,357 --> 00:25:52,424
It's a game changer
for me and Dad.

586
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,475
He's gonna support you,

587
00:25:54,477 --> 00:25:56,411
like he always does.

588
00:25:56,413 --> 00:25:57,996
I don't know about that.

589
00:25:57,998 --> 00:26:01,482
It's a whole new territory
for the both of us.

590
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,463
If I'm putting bad guys away,

591
00:26:03,464 --> 00:26:06,265
then I'm still
in the family business.

592
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:07,883
This job...

593
00:26:07,885 --> 00:26:11,103
I'd be responsible in areas that
are in direct conflict with his.

594
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:14,356
Yeah, well, you can't let that
dictate, though, right?

595
00:26:14,358 --> 00:26:17,777
Well, I can't ignore it, either.

596
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:23,930
Hey.

597
00:26:24,498 --> 00:26:25,966
Feel better, sunshine?

598
00:26:25,968 --> 00:26:29,436
Yeah, thanks. I didn't have
time to go home and shower.

599
00:26:29,438 --> 00:26:31,271
Your toilet seat,
is that heated?

600
00:26:31,273 --> 00:26:32,606
Nice, right?

601
00:26:32,608 --> 00:26:34,975
I gotta get the commissioner one
for Christmas.

602
00:26:34,977 --> 00:26:36,693
Look, this shirt,
it's really ripe.

603
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,762
Do you, uh,
got a washing machine?

604
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:39,930
Yeah, I, uh,

605
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,232
follow me.

606
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:47,704
Um, uh...

607
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,624
I, uh, think, uh...

608
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:53,693
you and Paul are
around the same size.

609
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,529
Well, in t-shirts, maybe.

610
00:26:58,167 --> 00:26:59,966
That's pretty soft.
It's not Fruit of the Loom.

611
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,534
No.

612
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,149
He's a bit of a clothes horse.

613
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,516
Must be a Wall Street guy.

614
00:27:04,518 --> 00:27:06,101
Mm-hmm.

615
00:27:06,103 --> 00:27:09,070
And he gets to keep
his clothes here, huh?

616
00:27:09,072 --> 00:27:10,488
Hmm!

617
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,524
A few nights a week, yeah.

618
00:27:12,526 --> 00:27:14,609
Well, he's a lucky man.

619
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:17,579
Thank you, Danny.

620
00:27:17,581 --> 00:27:19,564
I mean, 'cause he gets to use
the heated toilet seat.

621
00:27:19,566 --> 00:27:21,416
Right.

622
00:27:21,418 --> 00:27:23,251
Hey, Sarge.

623
00:27:23,253 --> 00:27:25,286
You guys okay over there?

624
00:27:25,288 --> 00:27:27,238
Yeah, we're good.
You ready to give it a try?

625
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,124
Good to go.

626
00:27:31,093 --> 00:27:32,710
Okay, listen up.

627
00:27:32,712 --> 00:27:34,745
I got Sophia Babikov's
new location.

628
00:27:34,747 --> 00:27:36,447
Let's get to work.

629
00:27:53,315 --> 00:27:54,699
<i>Da.</i>

630
00:27:54,701 --> 00:27:55,950
It's Schilling.

631
00:27:55,952 --> 00:27:58,002
I know where
they're keeping the girl.

632
00:28:05,277 --> 00:28:08,046
First, the Giants
win the Super Bowl,

633
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:09,631
and now
my own granddaughter's

634
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:11,616
gonna become
a crooked politician.

635
00:28:11,618 --> 00:28:14,219
Politicians run for office,
Grandpa.

636
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:16,354
The deputy mayor is appointed.

637
00:28:16,356 --> 00:28:18,489
Yeah, Erin's gonna be
a corrupt city official.

638
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:20,258
Thank you for that.

639
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,126
Well, no matter how you put it,

640
00:28:22,128 --> 00:28:23,127
it's a dirty business.

641
00:28:23,129 --> 00:28:25,146
Jack's running
for class president.

642
00:28:25,148 --> 00:28:27,765
But that's a totally different
thing, right, Pop?

643
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:28,733
If you say so.

644
00:28:28,735 --> 00:28:30,435
No, no, no.

645
00:28:30,437 --> 00:28:31,686
It's completely different.

646
00:28:31,688 --> 00:28:33,855
Yeah. Is Dad coming?

647
00:28:33,857 --> 00:28:36,807
Hmm, he can't, sweetie.
He's working.

648
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:39,027
What do you think about Erin
working for the mayor, Dad?

649
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:40,478
Well,

650
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,613
the mayor's a smart guy.

651
00:28:41,615 --> 00:28:42,947
I just wish I knew
what he was up to.

652
00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:45,166
Pass the potatoes, please.

653
00:28:45,168 --> 00:28:47,435
What is that supposed to mean?

654
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:50,171
It means the potatoes
are delicious

655
00:28:50,173 --> 00:28:51,339
and I'd like some more.

656
00:28:51,341 --> 00:28:53,157
No, what the
mayor is "up to,"

657
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:57,629
as if he's only offered me the
job because I'm your daughter.

658
00:28:57,631 --> 00:28:58,846
I didn't say that.

659
00:28:58,848 --> 00:29:00,465
He didn't say that.

660
00:29:00,467 --> 00:29:03,184
I think it's a smart move,
having an attorney in that job.

661
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:04,636
Yeah, and I think
Erin would make

662
00:29:04,638 --> 00:29:06,387
an outstanding deputy mayor.

663
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:08,172
Thank you.
Yeah, one that happens to have

664
00:29:08,174 --> 00:29:12,009
an inside track with
the police commissioner, right?

665
00:29:13,062 --> 00:29:14,529
Do you work
for the mayor, Grandpa?

666
00:29:16,365 --> 00:29:17,565
Yes, I do, Jack.

667
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:19,701
So if Aunt Erin
becomes deputy mayor,

668
00:29:19,703 --> 00:29:21,035
will she be your boss?

669
00:29:21,037 --> 00:29:22,437
No, not exactly.

670
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:24,155
They'll just be
working together.

671
00:29:24,157 --> 00:29:25,690
Okay.
Although Erin will

672
00:29:25,692 --> 00:29:27,041
be able to get Grandpa
in big trouble

673
00:29:27,043 --> 00:29:29,210
if he steps out of line.

674
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:32,547
Oh, your, um, your witness

675
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:34,632
testifies tomorrow
in the Denko case.

676
00:29:34,634 --> 00:29:36,367
Should put you
over the top, yeah?

677
00:29:36,369 --> 00:29:40,722
Yeah, if the task force can keep
her alive for the next 12 hours.

678
00:29:40,724 --> 00:29:42,840
Denko's no ordinary
defendant.

679
00:29:42,842 --> 00:29:44,709
Yeah, not with an informant

680
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:46,794
that's giving him
confidential information.

681
00:29:46,796 --> 00:29:49,347
Protecting witnesses
is not an exact science.

682
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:51,733
Oh, and one that I couldn't
possibly understand

683
00:29:51,735 --> 00:29:53,151
because I'm not a cop?

684
00:29:53,153 --> 00:29:54,118
I didn't say that.

685
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,386
He didn't say that.

686
00:29:55,388 --> 00:29:56,154
He didn't say that.

687
00:29:56,156 --> 00:29:57,855
Exc...
But honestly?

688
00:29:57,857 --> 00:30:00,858
No, you can't.

689
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:08,032
Sounds to me like it's an easy
way to defend incompetence.

690
00:30:08,034 --> 00:30:10,568
Those people are putting
their lives on the line

691
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,171
to protect your witness.

692
00:30:13,173 --> 00:30:15,707
I shouldn't have to sit there
and defend them.

693
00:30:18,627 --> 00:30:20,712
These potatoes are great, Linda.
You do something different?

694
00:30:22,214 --> 00:30:25,683
Taste the same to me.

695
00:30:32,391 --> 00:30:35,760
You know, um...

696
00:30:35,762 --> 00:30:39,364
you should probably
get some sleep.

697
00:30:39,366 --> 00:30:41,432
You have a big day tomorrow.

698
00:30:44,037 --> 00:30:45,903
What do you think?

699
00:30:47,456 --> 00:30:49,907
It's beautiful.

700
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:52,777
They're the mountains
near my village.

701
00:30:55,914 --> 00:30:59,417
It's for you.

702
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,455
It's very beautiful.

703
00:31:04,457 --> 00:31:05,423
Thank you.

704
00:31:05,425 --> 00:31:07,475
Thank you.

705
00:31:08,927 --> 00:31:12,013
Thank you for keeping me safe.

706
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:16,567
You're welcome.

I wish it was morning.

00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:23,350
Close your eyes.

711
00:32:23,352 --> 00:32:25,536
It'll be over soon.

712
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:32,459
Police! Drop it!

713
00:32:36,381 --> 00:32:37,598
Drop it!

714
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:42,102
Hands where I can
see 'em-- up!

715
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:46,673
Well, looks like
you got the wrong address.

716
00:32:56,201 --> 00:32:57,735
Come on.

717
00:32:57,737 --> 00:32:59,236
Leave the cuffs on.

718
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:14,718
I guess it's true
what they say, huh?

719
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,871
When the ship sinks,
the rats run for the exit.

720
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:19,706
Just heading out
for a pack of smokes.

721
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:20,891
Come on, Schilling, save it.

722
00:33:20,893 --> 00:33:22,542
The new address
you gave Denko's crew

723
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:24,561
was a setup,
and you took the bait.

724
00:33:24,563 --> 00:33:27,347
His guy gave you up before
I even read him his rights.

725
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,446
So you gonna arrest me?

726
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:30,896
I don't know.

727
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:32,181
That's up to you.

728
00:33:32,183 --> 00:33:33,482
I get it.

729
00:33:33,484 --> 00:33:36,351
You want me to run, so you can
put a bullet in my back.

730
00:33:36,353 --> 00:33:39,622
I wouldn't waste a bullet
on a scumbag like you.

731
00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:41,791
You walk out that door,
I won't have to.

732
00:33:41,793 --> 00:33:43,743
That bad tip you gave

733
00:33:43,745 --> 00:33:45,044
got one of Denko's boys killed,

734
00:33:45,046 --> 00:33:47,063
so the minute you hit
the street, you're a dead man.

735
00:33:47,065 --> 00:33:49,832
Go ahead.

736
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:52,201
I'm not stopping you.

737
00:34:08,602 --> 00:34:10,403
Heads up.
We're on the move.

738
00:34:10,405 --> 00:34:11,987
You ready to
go, young lady?

739
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:12,905
Yes.

740
00:34:12,907 --> 00:34:14,389
Actually, uh, just
one thing first.

741
00:34:14,391 --> 00:34:16,275
Yeah, we're ready
on this end.

742
00:34:16,277 --> 00:34:17,226
Okay.

743
00:34:17,228 --> 00:34:19,495
Someone wants
to talk to you.

744
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:26,068
Hello.

745
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,920
Mama!

746
00:34:27,922 --> 00:34:32,358
Figured she could use
the moral support.

747
00:34:42,353 --> 00:34:45,087
So much beauty

748
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:47,089
wasted in a courtroom.

749
00:34:47,091 --> 00:34:51,811
Can't wait to put you
in the cage where you belong.

750
00:34:51,813 --> 00:34:54,146
You need a witness to do this.

751
00:34:54,148 --> 00:34:56,449
Well, she's on her way.

752
00:34:56,451 --> 00:34:59,702
I hope she makes it.

753
00:34:59,704 --> 00:35:02,388
Morning traffic's a bitch.

754
00:35:10,497 --> 00:35:12,614
Heading to the car now.

755
00:35:12,616 --> 00:35:15,784
Estimating arriving at
the courthouse in 19 minutes.

756
00:35:15,786 --> 00:35:17,486
Roger that.

757
00:35:20,123 --> 00:35:22,258
All right, let's go.

758
00:35:24,394 --> 00:35:25,511
Not home yet.

759
00:35:25,513 --> 00:35:26,929
Keep your eyes open.

760
00:35:32,569 --> 00:35:34,770
You okay?

761
00:35:34,772 --> 00:35:36,505
Yes.

762
00:35:40,577 --> 00:35:44,146
My mother said
she's proud of me.

763
00:35:44,148 --> 00:35:45,698
She should be.

764
00:35:50,587 --> 00:35:52,371
What the hell
was that?!

765
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,709
We got company!
Jack, get down!

766
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:05,759
Danny, what the hell
are you doing?!

767
00:36:14,361 --> 00:36:16,779
Son of a bitch.

768
00:36:16,781 --> 00:36:18,347
That's what the hell I'm doing.

769
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:20,132
Works for me.

770
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,742
Secure that door!

771
00:36:37,751 --> 00:36:39,919
Glad you made it.
You ready?

772
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:43,806
Come on inside! Come on!

773
00:36:48,595 --> 00:36:49,895
You'll be okay.

774
00:36:49,897 --> 00:36:52,547
Heard you had some excitement
on the way in.

775
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:53,899
Yeah, well,
nothing we couldn't handle.

776
00:36:53,901 --> 00:36:55,434
Look, I've been tough on you.

777
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:57,353
I just wanted to say thank you.

778
00:36:57,355 --> 00:36:58,904
You'll get our bill.

779
00:37:00,824 --> 00:37:02,992
Take care of her.

780
00:37:02,994 --> 00:37:05,661
You know, if we hurry, I can
drive you down to Atlantic City.

781
00:37:05,663 --> 00:37:07,112
You can still
get there in time

782
00:37:07,114 --> 00:37:08,581
to hang out with
Mr. Wall Street.

783
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:10,399
No.

784
00:37:10,401 --> 00:37:12,334
I'll settle
for breakfast, though.

785
00:37:12,336 --> 00:37:13,419
Breakfast?
Yes.

786
00:37:13,421 --> 00:37:14,536
Sounds good.

787
00:37:14,538 --> 00:37:16,755
You know, you cannot
keep that T-shirt.

788
00:37:16,757 --> 00:37:19,258
What T-shirt?

789
00:37:20,894 --> 00:37:23,879
Ms. Reagan, are the People
prepared to proceed?

790
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:24,964
We are, Your Honor.

791
00:37:24,966 --> 00:37:27,016
The People call Sophia Babikov.

792
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,694
Raise your right hand.

793
00:37:39,529 --> 00:37:40,762
Do you solemnly
swear or affirm

794
00:37:40,764 --> 00:37:41,947
that the testimony

795
00:37:41,949 --> 00:37:43,983
you are about to give
is the truth, the whole truth

796
00:37:43,985 --> 00:37:45,451
and nothing
but the truth?

797
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,904
Your Honor!
Be quiet, Mr. Denko.

798
00:37:58,081 --> 00:38:00,049
Ms. Babikov?

799
00:38:08,341 --> 00:38:10,092
I do.

800
00:38:29,304 --> 00:38:30,972
That for me?

801
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:42,633
Thanks for coming.

802
00:38:42,635 --> 00:38:44,819
Thanks for asking.

803
00:38:44,821 --> 00:38:48,439
Remember when we used to come
down here when I was little,

804
00:38:48,441 --> 00:38:50,808
keep a lookout
for pirate ships?

805
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,410
You with that plastic sword,

806
00:38:52,412 --> 00:38:56,313
talking a mile a minute about
how that's what you wanted to be

807
00:38:56,315 --> 00:38:57,748
when you grew up.

808
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,835
That's right.

809
00:39:04,206 --> 00:39:06,841
I didn't mean to

810
00:39:06,843 --> 00:39:09,043
insult the department.

811
00:39:09,045 --> 00:39:10,545
It was out of line.

812
00:39:10,547 --> 00:39:13,264
I never thought for a second

813
00:39:13,266 --> 00:39:16,834
you weren't up to
being deputy mayor.

814
00:39:16,836 --> 00:39:20,271
I know it's been
awkward for you.

815
00:39:20,273 --> 00:39:22,506
Eh, it's tough when you get
caught between your job

816
00:39:22,508 --> 00:39:25,309
and the ambitions
of your kids.

817
00:39:25,311 --> 00:39:28,579
But I would never
stand in your way.

818
00:39:28,581 --> 00:39:31,148
I know.

819
00:39:32,368 --> 00:39:35,236
We Reagans aren't...

820
00:39:35,238 --> 00:39:37,939
real gushy, but...

821
00:39:37,941 --> 00:39:40,758
I couldn't be more proud of you.

822
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:45,713
As a woman, as a mother,
as an attorney.

823
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:49,584
And you'd make a great pirate.

824
00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:53,404
I think you can do
anything you set your mind to.

825
00:39:53,406 --> 00:39:56,090
Thank you.

826
00:39:56,092 --> 00:39:57,541
And the Denko case

827
00:39:57,543 --> 00:40:00,311
is a great way
to end your legal career.

828
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:04,348
I called Mayor Poole.

829
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,517
I turned down his offer.

830
00:40:08,353 --> 00:40:09,553
Because of me?

831
00:40:09,555 --> 00:40:11,455
No.

832
00:40:14,243 --> 00:40:17,495
This case was as
bad as they get.

833
00:40:17,497 --> 00:40:22,283
But I did my job, and a brutal
criminal is going to prison,

834
00:40:22,285 --> 00:40:27,038
and the world's a little bit
better because of it.

835
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,707
I can make a difference.

836
00:40:29,709 --> 00:40:31,759
I'm not ready to give that up.

837
00:40:34,096 --> 00:40:36,631
And a wise man
once said to me,

838
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:39,249
"If you find something
you love to do,

839
00:40:39,251 --> 00:40:41,269
you'll never work
a day in your life."

840
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:43,137
Not that wise.

841
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,924
Besides, I don't know

842
00:40:46,926 --> 00:40:51,479
if I want to spend my days
keeping a bunch of cops in line.

843
00:40:51,481 --> 00:40:54,448
I do enough of that at home.

844
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:58,450
