1
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:53,632
In the days before the event,

2
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,660
he had the whole world
wondering if he would show up.

3
00:01:07,648 --> 00:01:09,081
While he napped

4
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:12,175
or took walks
and ate sandwiches.

5
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:15,087
Henry Kissinger called

6
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:18,147
and asked him to go
for his country's honor.

7
00:01:20,594 --> 00:01:22,824
Soon after arriving,

8
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:24,329
he offended the Icelanders

9
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:26,332
by calling their country
inadequate

10
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,200
because they had
no bowling alleys.

11
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,932
He complained
about the TV cameras,

12
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:34,439
about the lighting,

13
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:36,442
about the table and chairs,

14
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,946
and the contrast of
the squares on the board.

15
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:44,450
His hotel room, he said,
Had too nice a view.

16
00:01:44,518 --> 00:01:48,420
None of this had anything
to do with chess, of course...

17
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:51,049
or maybe it did.

18
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:52,751
If he won,

19
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:56,592
he'd be the first
American world champion in history.

20
00:01:56,663 --> 00:01:58,096
If he lost,

21
00:01:58,165 --> 00:02:01,601
he'd just be another
patzer from Brooklyn.

22
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,564
On the 40th move
Of the 21st game,

23
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,575
he countered
Spassky's bishop to king-6

24
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:12,009
with a pawn to rook-4.

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,173
And it was all over.

26
00:02:16,984 --> 00:02:19,680
He came home An American hero.

27
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:24,087
He bragged to the world
he'd beat the Russians.

28
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:25,920
He delivered.

29
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,095
He can now command
The same money

30
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:32,358
as heavy weight prize fighters.

31
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:37,131
He was invited to dinner
By statesmen and kings.

32
00:02:37,204 --> 00:02:44,102
Then Bobby Fischer made the most
original, unexpected move of all.

33
00:02:44,236 --> 00:02:46,067
He disappeared.

34
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,019
Where is he?

35
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:56,026
Maybe he gave up.

36
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:57,527
Shh.

37
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,087
Do you see anything?

38
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,196
I think we lost him.

39
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,467
It's cold. Let's go home.

40
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,475
If he doesn't find us
in two hours,

41
00:03:11,543 --> 00:03:12,976
I say we go.

42
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:15,269
Hello, boys.

43
00:03:15,347 --> 00:03:16,541
Aah!
Aah!

44
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:32,291
Theo, what are you doing here?

45
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:34,594
I thought you wanted to go home.

46
00:03:57,589 --> 00:04:00,149
I have to buckle
my own shoes, right?

47
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:01,419
You said something

48
00:04:01,493 --> 00:04:04,257
about rolling on your own side
of the board, right?

49
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:05,694
This is my side.

50
00:04:05,764 --> 00:04:06,764
Remember that?

51
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:08,995
Roll it on your own side.

52
00:04:10,502 --> 00:04:11,730
You talk too much.

53
00:04:11,803 --> 00:04:13,566
You talk too much.

54
00:04:57,415 --> 00:04:58,439
Josh?

55
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:01,544
Josh?

56
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,959
Your move.

57
00:05:10,028 --> 00:05:11,393
Josh!

58
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,020
That's good.

59
00:05:37,021 --> 00:05:38,454
Well, there you go.

60
00:05:38,523 --> 00:05:40,991
Not too much, but that's good.

61
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:42,993
A little more.

62
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:44,494
Yeah. That's good.

63
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:47,497
You got to be careful
not to use it too much,

64
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:49,499
but you want just enough.

65
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,501
A little more.
That's great.

66
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:52,569
O.K.

67
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,003
That looks pretty good.

68
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:57,007
How's that look to you?

69
00:05:57,075 --> 00:05:58,508
Pretty good.

70
00:05:58,576 --> 00:05:59,576
Good.

71
00:05:59,577 --> 00:06:01,442
Now rub that in there.

72
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:04,448
See how the leather
drinks that up?

73
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:06,450
That's got a great smell, huh?

74
00:06:06,518 --> 00:06:07,518
Smell that.

75
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,046
Yeah. Great. O.K.

76
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:13,420
Now...

77
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:15,618
Ohh.

78
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:18,893
What's wrong?

79
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:20,954
I forgot to buy a ball.

80
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:22,465
Do you believe it?

81
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:25,970
You got to put a ball
in the pocket.

82
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:27,470
A hard ball...

83
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,473
to get the shape right.

84
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:35,979
Yeah.

85
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:38,549
That'll work.

86
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,450
O.K.

87
00:06:40,518 --> 00:06:42,452
Put that in like that...

88
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,249
bend that over.

89
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:45,983
All right.
Get in bed.

90
00:06:46,057 --> 00:06:48,890
Tomorrow I buy a real baseball.

91
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:52,529
You know what?

92
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:55,531
I don't believe this.

93
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,000
I can't believe it.

94
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,003
What?

95
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:01,538
You're 7.

96
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:06,867
Happy birthday.

97
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:11,014
Good night, Josh.

98
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:12,710
Good night.

99
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:54,057
Josh!

100
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:55,058
Bye.

101
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:56,492
How was school?

102
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:57,994
Good.

103
00:07:58,062 --> 00:08:00,496
O.K. Bye.

104
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:02,499
Bye. See ya.
How you doing?

105
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:03,567
Fine. Bye.

106
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:04,728
Bye-bye. See ya.

107
00:08:06,504 --> 00:08:08,938
Are you in the mood
for some pizza?

108
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:10,531
I don't know.
Are you?

109
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:12,667
Are you feeling all right?

110
00:08:12,744 --> 00:08:14,735
Yeah. Why?

111
00:08:14,812 --> 00:08:17,042
Where we going to get pizza?

112
00:08:17,115 --> 00:08:20,278
You want to go watch the men
in the park?

113
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,952
What men in the park?

114
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:25,489
I'm going to smack
this guy's ass, man.

115
00:08:28,826 --> 00:08:30,555
There's fire in the bush.

116
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:33,563
It ain't over.
We still got a minute.

117
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:36,065
When it slaps 12:00,
then it's over.

118
00:08:36,134 --> 00:08:37,362
Then it's over.

119
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:44,040
We playing chess.

120
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:46,042
What we playing here?

121
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,475
We playing chess.

122
00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:51,481
Now we playing chess.

123
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:53,449
Come on, Josh, let's go.

124
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:55,611
Is that the best you got?

125
00:08:55,687 --> 00:08:57,621
That's the best you got?

126
00:08:57,689 --> 00:08:58,917
You ain't got nothing.

127
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,651
You sure
you've played this game?

128
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:04,855
You want to go to Chinatown
and play Chinese checkers?

129
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:06,226
No, that ain't it.

130
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:07,730
You want that? O.K.

131
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,630
You can have that.

132
00:09:09,701 --> 00:09:12,761
But you can't have that.
That's my baby.

133
00:09:12,837 --> 00:09:14,270
You got to leave with that.

134
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,273
You can't trade queens with me.

135
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:18,275
I ain't in the trading business.

136
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:19,503
What you trying to do?

137
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:21,943
You're going to have
to do better than that.

138
00:09:22,013 --> 00:09:23,241
That's Kamran Shirazi.

139
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:24,542
That's Kamran Shirazi.

140
00:09:24,615 --> 00:09:27,982
That's Kamran Shirazi, man.

141
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:32,446
Shirazi!

142
00:09:32,523 --> 00:09:33,785
The Grandmaster's here.

143
00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:35,792
You come to hustle the hustler.

144
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,921
Don't look at my clock.
My time is fine.

145
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,931
I want to go home.

146
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,261
Come and take my money.

147
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:45,165
Let's go, Josh.

148
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:47,670
Come on, Grandmaster.
Show me something.

149
00:09:47,739 --> 00:09:51,436
All right.
Check to his majesty.

150
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:53,170
No, no. Back up.

151
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:55,178
Check yourself
before you wreck yourself.

152
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:56,941
You can't have it.

153
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,481
Mmm. Hello?

154
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:00,278
That's right. Run.

155
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:01,613
Run.

156
00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:03,483
Run.

157
00:10:03,554 --> 00:10:04,987
Somebody call the police.

158
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:06,887
The man is loitering.

159
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:18,672
Excuse me, sir.

160
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:25,684
I noticed your sign.

161
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:27,812
Where is your camera?

162
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:31,289
No. My son would like to play
a game of chess with you.

163
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:11,992
Check.

164
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:35,080
Nyet. Nyet.

165
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:36,155
It's over.

166
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,623
You lose.

167
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,559
Thanks.

168
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,766
What's his name?

169
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:47,834
Josh.

170
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:48,835
Josh what?

171
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:50,633
Don't tell him...
Waitzkin.

172
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:54,606
Josh Waitzkin.

173
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:57,735
I'm going to watch out
for you, Josh Waitzkin.

174
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:59,244
Tell these patzers

175
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:00,940
I watched you play
like Bobby Fischer.

176
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:02,175
Show them this.

177
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:07,448
Your boy used pieces in
combination to attack, lady.

178
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:08,920
Shut up, man.

179
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:09,989
Look what you did.

180
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,832
And here's the pitch.

181
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,164
A short grounder to second base.

182
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:23,635
Here's the throw.

183
00:13:23,704 --> 00:13:24,762
And he got it.

184
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,006
Hey, babe.

185
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,065
Hi.

186
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:32,512
Hi.

187
00:13:32,513 --> 00:13:33,513
Where's Josh?

188
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:35,448
He's over there.

189
00:13:35,516 --> 00:13:36,642
Hey, Josh.

190
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:37,717
How's it going?

191
00:13:37,785 --> 00:13:38,785
Eddie.

192
00:13:38,786 --> 00:13:40,310
Come here.

193
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:41,786
Give me a hand.

194
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:44,957
What did I miss?

195
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,356
No score.

196
00:13:46,427 --> 00:13:49,362
I took Josh to the park today.

197
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,022
He played chess.

198
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,225
Um...

199
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:57,236
Josh doesn't know
how to play chess.

200
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:00,296
Don't ask me how, but he does.

201
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:03,241
You going to write about sports
like your dad,

202
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,572
or you going to play?

203
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:06,704
I'll play second base
for the Yanks.

204
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,147
Make that
a four-game streak!

205
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:12,242
They could use a second baseman.

206
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:25,763
Careful.

207
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:26,833
Careful, careful.

208
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:28,426
Oh, here.

209
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:29,935
Hey...

210
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,436
Look what I found.

211
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:40,138
Want to play a game?

212
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:44,177
Why?

213
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:46,014
For fun.

214
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:51,423
Let's go to a dealership instead
and get some brochures.

215
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:54,359
Well, show him.

216
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,362
Your dad wants to see you play,

217
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,660
Like with the men in the park.

218
00:14:58,732 --> 00:14:59,960
Hey, it'll be fun.

219
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,763
Then we'll go to a dealership.

220
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:19,415
Now go easy on me.

221
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,681
It's been a while
since I've played.

222
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,288
Check.

223
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,902
Oh, uh...

224
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,534
checkmate.

225
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:20,910
You see,
I've got you here and here.

226
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,414
See?

227
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,916
Can we go to the dealership now?

228
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:27,887
Sure.

229
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:29,856
Pee and get your coat.

230
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,926
Yeah, I know.

231
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,929
I should've let him win one.

232
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,225
I gave him every opportunity.

233
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:40,163
He wasn't trying to win.

234
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,338
Oh, no?

235
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,939
Come on, Bonnie.

236
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,533
It doesn't matter.

237
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:52,340
No. Say what you mean.

238
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:56,280
You don't get it?

239
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,716
He doesn't want
to beat his daddy.

240
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,426
Dad.

241
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,428
She thinks you're
throwing the game.

242
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,260
You know what that means,
throwing the game?

243
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:14,467
No.

244
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:18,029
Well, this time, really try.

245
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:19,766
I was trying.

246
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,273
Well, I know you were,

247
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:25,471
but we're going to play one more
just for fun, O.K.?

248
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,377
Josh...

249
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:29,915
it's O.K. to beat him.

250
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:31,951
You won't hurt his feelings.

251
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,505
It's your move.

252
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:18,708
Your move, Josh!

253
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:39,685
I can't.

254
00:18:39,763 --> 00:18:42,197
I'm playing chess with my dad.

255
00:18:42,265 --> 00:18:45,359
Chess. It's a game,
like Monopoly.

256
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:46,435
Josh!

257
00:18:46,436 --> 00:18:48,063
Don't hang up.

258
00:19:01,384 --> 00:19:02,384
Hi.

259
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:18,394
Your move, Josh!

260
00:19:18,468 --> 00:19:20,834
Did you move that pawn?

261
00:19:20,904 --> 00:19:22,838
I moved a pawn, yeah.

262
00:19:22,906 --> 00:19:24,134
Yeah, that one.

263
00:19:24,207 --> 00:19:26,675
Move my horse
in front of my king.

264
00:19:26,743 --> 00:19:28,335
You mean your knight.

265
00:19:28,411 --> 00:19:30,174
Yeah.

266
00:19:35,218 --> 00:19:37,345
O.K.

267
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:40,651
He's going to lose his queen.

268
00:19:40,724 --> 00:19:42,851
Oh, really?

269
00:19:42,926 --> 00:19:44,359
Did you do it?

270
00:19:44,427 --> 00:19:45,427
Yeah.

271
00:19:45,428 --> 00:19:47,919
Can we go out now?

272
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:52,024
Well, the game's
not over yet, Josh.

273
00:19:52,102 --> 00:19:53,660
Yes, it is.

274
00:20:04,948 --> 00:20:07,678
Bobby Fischer was 6

275
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:10,219
when his mother moved the family

276
00:20:10,286 --> 00:20:12,982
to a small apartment
near Ebbets Field.

277
00:20:13,056 --> 00:20:14,114
At night,

278
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,488
when the traffic noise
died down,

279
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,892
you could hear the roar of the crowd
from the stadium.

280
00:20:22,065 --> 00:20:24,397
His sister brought home
games to amuse him

281
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:26,594
while their mother was at work.

282
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:29,902
Monopoly...

283
00:20:29,973 --> 00:20:31,440
Parcheesi...

284
00:20:32,642 --> 00:20:33,642
chess.

285
00:20:34,978 --> 00:20:37,913
Even though
she was five years older,

286
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:40,916
she was soon no match for him.

287
00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:42,417
It became more interesting

288
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:44,851
for him to play against himself.

289
00:20:44,921 --> 00:20:49,415
He'd play both sides
of the board equally hard,

290
00:20:49,492 --> 00:20:51,426
careful to be fair...

291
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:54,122
and he always won.

292
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:57,928
And up...

293
00:20:58,001 --> 00:20:59,001
3...

294
00:20:59,002 --> 00:21:00,765
4.

295
00:21:00,837 --> 00:21:01,701
Now over.

296
00:21:01,771 --> 00:21:03,204
Arms long, girls,

297
00:21:03,273 --> 00:21:04,365
and down.

298
00:21:04,441 --> 00:21:06,602
Let's go to the other side.

299
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:09,935
Long neck.

300
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:13,546
And plié.

301
00:21:13,616 --> 00:21:15,174
And down.

302
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:22,191
3...

303
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:24,023
4. Very nice.

304
00:21:24,093 --> 00:21:25,219
J'adoube.

305
00:21:25,295 --> 00:21:26,557
What are you doing?

306
00:21:26,629 --> 00:21:27,721
J'adoube.

307
00:21:27,797 --> 00:21:29,731
J'adoube?
You moved the piece.

308
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:31,391
No, I adjusted the piece.

309
00:21:31,468 --> 00:21:32,468
J'adoube.

310
00:21:32,469 --> 00:21:34,403
No, you moved it,
then took it back.

311
00:21:34,471 --> 00:21:35,529
No, I adjusted...

312
00:21:35,605 --> 00:21:37,539
Who are you with again?

313
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:39,541
No, you picked up the piece...

314
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:41,543
The Hadassah chapter
on Staten Island.

315
00:21:41,611 --> 00:21:43,044
I'll take it back.

316
00:21:43,112 --> 00:21:45,546
What did you have in mind?

317
00:21:45,615 --> 00:21:47,412
Lecture? Exhibition?

318
00:21:47,484 --> 00:21:50,578
I'm looking for
Bruce Pandolfini.

319
00:21:50,653 --> 00:21:52,621
What are you prepared to pay?

320
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,355
$30.

321
00:21:55,425 --> 00:22:00,624
Do you know how much I'm accustomed
to getting for a lecture?

322
00:22:17,947 --> 00:22:19,812
Want to play?

323
00:22:25,288 --> 00:22:27,222
Can I have one of those?

324
00:22:46,476 --> 00:22:47,966
Yes, I'll be there.

325
00:22:48,044 --> 00:22:52,037
Yes, l... I'm agreeing to the $30.

326
00:22:52,115 --> 00:22:53,912
Yes, I have it.

327
00:22:53,983 --> 00:22:55,507
Ahem.

328
00:22:55,585 --> 00:22:56,677
Bye.

329
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,368
I work for a newspaper.
I wanted...

330
00:23:13,436 --> 00:23:16,462
I don't know
where Bobby Fischer is.

331
00:23:19,642 --> 00:23:22,873
I was talking to the guy
who writes the chess column.

332
00:23:22,946 --> 00:23:27,383
He told me I could find
Bruce Pandolfini here.

333
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,385
I'm looking for
a teacher for my son.

334
00:23:30,453 --> 00:23:31,886
I don't teach anymore.

335
00:23:31,955 --> 00:23:34,753
He was sure that you did.

336
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,824
I don't.

337
00:23:54,477 --> 00:23:55,910
Come on, Josh.

338
00:23:55,979 --> 00:23:58,072
Just a second.

339
00:25:18,928 --> 00:25:20,190
Thanks.

340
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,133
What was the score?

341
00:25:25,201 --> 00:25:26,361
33 to 8.

342
00:25:26,436 --> 00:25:28,870
33 to 8?
What did you do?

343
00:25:28,938 --> 00:25:32,339
3 home runs, 3 triples,
and 2 singles.

344
00:25:32,408 --> 00:25:35,138
I almost had 4 home runs,

345
00:25:35,211 --> 00:25:37,008
but I slipped coming home
from third.

346
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,446
I ain't playing this game.

347
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,214
Oh, caught you looking.

348
00:25:43,286 --> 00:25:44,548
You want some smoke?

349
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,383
Never play defensive.
Always attack.

350
00:25:46,456 --> 00:25:48,390
Even when you retreat,
you attack.

351
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:49,458
You understand?

352
00:25:49,459 --> 00:25:50,459
Yeah.

353
00:25:50,493 --> 00:25:52,620
There you go.
Now you're playing chess.

354
00:25:52,695 --> 00:25:54,185
That's right.
Make him run.

355
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:57,061
Got me in trouble.
I'm on the run.

356
00:25:57,133 --> 00:26:00,068
What can I do?
Where can I go?

357
00:26:00,136 --> 00:26:01,000
Young Fischer.

358
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,332
Come after me.

359
00:26:02,405 --> 00:26:03,838
There you go.

360
00:26:03,906 --> 00:26:05,032
Outstanding.

361
00:26:05,108 --> 00:26:06,108
Outstanding.

362
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:07,838
Nothing I can do.

363
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,299
I'm in major trouble,
major trouble.

364
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:13,163
I got big problems now.

365
00:26:13,236 --> 00:26:14,669
What's this?

366
00:26:14,737 --> 00:26:16,295
This goes like this.

367
00:26:16,372 --> 00:26:17,805
And this goes like this.

368
00:26:17,874 --> 00:26:20,104
And this can go over pieces.

369
00:26:20,176 --> 00:26:22,110
That piece should go over here.

370
00:26:22,178 --> 00:26:24,009
And the pawn go...

371
00:26:25,181 --> 00:26:26,375
And the pawns...

372
00:26:26,449 --> 00:26:28,383
The pawns can take like this.

373
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:29,884
This is a pawn...

374
00:26:29,952 --> 00:26:32,318
You sneak in here again, Katya?

375
00:26:32,388 --> 00:26:33,388
Yeah.

376
00:26:33,389 --> 00:26:36,222
It's way past your bedtime.

377
00:26:36,292 --> 00:26:39,022
Say good night to your brother.

378
00:26:39,095 --> 00:26:40,095
Good night.

379
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:43,422
There.

380
00:26:45,902 --> 00:26:47,335
Mom?

381
00:26:47,403 --> 00:26:48,563
Yeah?

382
00:26:49,906 --> 00:26:52,340
Does Vinnie sleep in the park?

383
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:57,243
I have no idea where he lives.

384
00:26:57,313 --> 00:26:58,678
Well, I was thinking...

385
00:26:58,748 --> 00:27:01,979
maybe he could sleep
in my top bunk instead.

386
00:27:02,051 --> 00:27:04,986
Then when I get old enough
to sleep in it,

387
00:27:05,054 --> 00:27:06,988
he could sleep down here.

388
00:27:08,357 --> 00:27:11,053
You have a good heart.

389
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:16,558
And that's the most important thing
in the world.

390
00:27:23,072 --> 00:27:24,300
Good night.

391
00:27:24,373 --> 00:27:25,601
Good night, Mom.

392
00:27:57,907 --> 00:27:59,841
Glad you could make it.

393
00:28:06,182 --> 00:28:07,615
So how's it going?

394
00:28:08,684 --> 00:28:09,684
All right.

395
00:28:09,685 --> 00:28:11,619
Great.

396
00:28:11,687 --> 00:28:12,745
That's great.

397
00:28:13,856 --> 00:28:16,324
So what do you think?

398
00:28:16,392 --> 00:28:18,792
Have you ever been
to a tournament before?

399
00:28:18,861 --> 00:28:19,861
No.

400
00:28:19,862 --> 00:28:21,454
Ah. You're in luck then.

401
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,964
This is one
of the most prestigious.

402
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:26,627
The talent gathered here's
the strongest in the country.

403
00:28:26,702 --> 00:28:28,397
Everybody's here.

404
00:28:28,471 --> 00:28:31,133
Joel Benjamin...
Former U.S. Champion,

405
00:28:31,207 --> 00:28:35,109
among the six highest-rated players
in the country.

406
00:28:37,546 --> 00:28:41,812
The man in the corner's
Roman Dzindzichashvili...

407
00:28:41,884 --> 00:28:43,317
Two-time U.S. Champion.

408
00:28:43,386 --> 00:28:45,820
A few years ago, he was ranked

409
00:28:45,888 --> 00:28:49,221
among the top 10 players
of the world.

410
00:28:54,563 --> 00:28:56,326
Asa Hoffman.

411
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,333
He's the son of two lawyers.

412
00:28:58,401 --> 00:29:00,335
He grew up on Park Avenue,

413
00:29:00,403 --> 00:29:02,428
went to Columbia and Horace Mann

414
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:04,769
before dropping out
to play chess full-time.

415
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,604
He plays about 200 chess tournaments
a year.

416
00:29:07,676 --> 00:29:09,268
Asa.

417
00:29:09,345 --> 00:29:10,345
Asa.

418
00:29:14,183 --> 00:29:16,981
How much do you make
at the tournaments altogether...

419
00:29:17,053 --> 00:29:18,486
about $2,000 a year?

420
00:29:18,554 --> 00:29:21,489
Look at that. I got him thinking.
I got him thinking.

421
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:24,617
Maybe I can win a pawn.

422
00:29:32,868 --> 00:29:35,302
Clearly, you had me come here

423
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:37,896
so I could see all this.

424
00:29:37,973 --> 00:29:41,409
But if you really
wanted me to say no

425
00:29:41,477 --> 00:29:43,411
to letting my son play,

426
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:44,912
you wouldn't have bothered.

427
00:29:46,215 --> 00:29:49,878
You want me to think
you want me to say no,

428
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,819
but you actually...

429
00:29:52,888 --> 00:29:54,981
want me to say yes.

430
00:29:57,159 --> 00:29:59,559
You have no idea what I want.

431
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,094
What is chess, do you think?

432
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:08,102
Those who play for fun,
or not at all,

433
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,104
dismiss it as a game.

434
00:30:10,172 --> 00:30:13,608
The ones who devote their lives to it,
for the most part,

435
00:30:13,676 --> 00:30:16,110
insist it is a science.
It's neither.

436
00:30:17,913 --> 00:30:19,505
Bobby Fischer got underneath it

437
00:30:19,582 --> 00:30:21,174
Like no one before him

438
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,184
and found at its center...

439
00:30:23,252 --> 00:30:24,685
art.

440
00:30:24,753 --> 00:30:28,189
I've spent my life
trying to play like him.

441
00:30:28,257 --> 00:30:30,953
Most of these guys have.

442
00:30:31,026 --> 00:30:32,653
But we're like forgers.

443
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:35,487
We're competent fakes.

444
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:41,027
His successor
wasn't here tonight.

445
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:44,872
He wasn't here.

446
00:30:47,443 --> 00:30:50,378
He's asleep in his room
in your house.

447
00:30:52,781 --> 00:30:54,908
Your son creates like Fischer.

448
00:30:56,352 --> 00:30:58,877
He sees like him...

449
00:30:58,954 --> 00:31:00,421
inside.

450
00:31:00,489 --> 00:31:01,820
You can tell that

451
00:31:01,891 --> 00:31:04,485
by watching him
play some drunks in the park?

452
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,084
Yes!

453
00:31:09,131 --> 00:31:12,328
You want to know what I want?

454
00:31:12,401 --> 00:31:14,835
I'll tell you what I want.

455
00:31:14,904 --> 00:31:16,337
I want back

456
00:31:16,405 --> 00:31:19,704
what Bobby Fischer took with him
when he disappeared.

457
00:31:25,414 --> 00:31:26,847
Yeah, look at that.

458
00:31:30,085 --> 00:31:31,609
Oh!

459
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:37,358
You're his father.

460
00:31:37,426 --> 00:31:39,053
It's your decision.

461
00:31:55,444 --> 00:31:56,536
Josh.

462
00:31:56,612 --> 00:31:59,638
I... I'd like you to meet
a friend of mine.

463
00:31:59,715 --> 00:32:00,715
Hi, Josh.

464
00:32:00,716 --> 00:32:02,274
This is Bruce.

465
00:32:02,351 --> 00:32:03,375
Hi.

466
00:32:06,388 --> 00:32:08,822
Well, I'll let you two, um...

467
00:32:08,891 --> 00:32:10,324
I'll be downstairs.

468
00:32:52,935 --> 00:32:54,368
I love water basketball.

469
00:32:54,436 --> 00:32:58,372
Well, supposedly, he used to, uh,
really be someone.

470
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,375
Some sort of, uh...
master level...

471
00:33:02,544 --> 00:33:04,102
something or other.

472
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:05,305
Used to.

473
00:33:05,381 --> 00:33:08,475
Well, yeah. Well,
he doesn't play anymore...

474
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,142
on the circuit...

475
00:33:11,987 --> 00:33:15,013
or... or whatever, um...
they call it.

476
00:33:16,392 --> 00:33:17,825
Well, he's interesting.

477
00:33:32,908 --> 00:33:34,842
All right, this is it.

478
00:33:38,247 --> 00:33:40,715
Mr. Green
in the conservatory

479
00:33:40,783 --> 00:33:42,216
with the candlestick.

480
00:33:47,122 --> 00:33:48,248
Wrench.

481
00:33:50,225 --> 00:33:53,194
Frère Jacques

482
00:33:53,262 --> 00:33:55,127
Frère Jacques

483
00:33:55,197 --> 00:33:57,358
Dormez-vous?

484
00:33:57,433 --> 00:33:58,866
Dormez-vous?

485
00:33:58,934 --> 00:34:01,459
I need to talk
to your dad a minute.

486
00:34:01,537 --> 00:34:03,471
I'll see you
next week, O.K.?

487
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:05,239
I really had a great time, Josh.

488
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,240
Me, too.

489
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:08,049
Bye.

490
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,246
Bye.

491
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:12,256
The first lesson went
very well, I think.

492
00:34:12,324 --> 00:34:13,518
Oh, good.

493
00:34:15,827 --> 00:34:16,827
So, uh...

494
00:34:16,828 --> 00:34:18,591
uh, were you guys...

495
00:34:18,664 --> 00:34:19,756
talking about...

496
00:34:19,831 --> 00:34:21,264
chess up there?

497
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:23,824
No, it didn't come up.

498
00:34:26,338 --> 00:34:29,273
So I'll see you
next Saturday then?

499
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:32,001
Uh, right.

500
00:34:41,353 --> 00:34:42,353
That's great.

501
00:34:45,023 --> 00:34:46,023
So long.

502
00:34:50,395 --> 00:34:53,057
How about some Pac-Man
next week, Josh?

503
00:34:53,131 --> 00:34:54,393
Pac-Man and pizza.

504
00:34:54,466 --> 00:34:55,466
Great.

505
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:56,798
O.K.

506
00:34:56,868 --> 00:34:58,995
I'll see myself out.

507
00:34:59,071 --> 00:35:00,766
It was very nice meeting you.

508
00:35:09,581 --> 00:35:11,014
Mate is four moves

509
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:13,745
from the position
in front of you.

510
00:35:13,819 --> 00:35:17,755
Don't move until you figure it out
in your head.

511
00:35:17,823 --> 00:35:20,257
Don't look to me for a hint.

512
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:22,759
I can't do it without
moving the pieces.

513
00:35:22,828 --> 00:35:24,261
Yes, you can.

514
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:27,264
Clear the lines of men
in your head,

515
00:35:27,332 --> 00:35:28,765
one at a time,

516
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:31,268
and the king will
be left standing alone,

517
00:35:31,336 --> 00:35:34,271
Like a guy on a street corner.

518
00:35:37,843 --> 00:35:40,243
Here, I'll make it
easier for you.

519
00:36:07,973 --> 00:36:09,565
Knight to c8.

520
00:36:09,641 --> 00:36:12,041
Yes.

521
00:36:29,628 --> 00:36:32,256
I want to show you
something else.

522
00:36:43,008 --> 00:36:44,908
This is very rare.

523
00:36:44,976 --> 00:36:47,604
It says, "Master
Chess Certificate..."

524
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:49,112
awarded to..."

525
00:36:49,181 --> 00:36:52,116
and there's a blank here
for a name...

526
00:36:52,184 --> 00:36:55,085
"for highest achievement

527
00:36:55,153 --> 00:36:59,522
on this day of blank,
nineteen hundred and blank."

528
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,058
Careful with it.

529
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,894
It's a mysterious
and powerful thing.

530
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:13,665
It's only been given out...

531
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,573
I don't know...

532
00:37:16,641 --> 00:37:18,666
a few times in history.

533
00:37:20,812 --> 00:37:23,747
And then only
to those who achieve

534
00:37:23,815 --> 00:37:25,749
a lot of master-class
points.

535
00:37:25,817 --> 00:37:28,752
Then there's a big ceremony
and so on.

536
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,755
How do you get
master-class points?

537
00:37:31,823 --> 00:37:33,882
You earn them.

538
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,893
You just earned 10...

539
00:37:35,961 --> 00:37:38,828
for that knight to c8.

540
00:37:38,897 --> 00:37:40,592
10.

541
00:37:40,665 --> 00:37:41,665
10...

542
00:37:43,001 --> 00:37:44,093
master...

543
00:37:44,169 --> 00:37:45,761
class...

544
00:37:45,837 --> 00:37:46,997
points.

545
00:38:26,745 --> 00:38:28,337
O.K., Josh, let's go!

546
00:38:38,423 --> 00:38:40,857
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

547
00:38:40,926 --> 00:38:42,826
Take two!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

548
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:45,829
Hi.

549
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,563
You're overdressed, Bruce.

550
00:38:50,635 --> 00:38:53,103
Two, four, six, eight,

551
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:54,934
who do we appreciate?

552
00:38:55,006 --> 00:38:56,006
Eagles!

553
00:38:56,007 --> 00:38:57,007
Eagles!

554
00:38:57,008 --> 00:38:59,101
Yay, Eagles!

555
00:38:59,177 --> 00:39:00,872
O.K., yeah!

556
00:39:02,213 --> 00:39:03,544
Nice game, guys.

557
00:39:03,615 --> 00:39:06,209
Let's get that equipment in
and head on out!

558
00:39:06,284 --> 00:39:07,945
Good game, fellas.

559
00:39:15,126 --> 00:39:16,559
Come on, Josh.

560
00:39:16,628 --> 00:39:19,722
His chess ideas are like
pieces of his body

561
00:39:19,798 --> 00:39:21,390
he's reluctant to give up.

562
00:39:21,466 --> 00:39:24,060
For instance, he simply can't cope
with being told

563
00:39:24,135 --> 00:39:27,070
not to bring his queen out
too early in the game.

564
00:39:27,138 --> 00:39:28,571
Why shouldn't he?

565
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,575
He's won many a game
in Washington Square doing exactly that.

566
00:39:31,643 --> 00:39:33,235
Why is this suddenly wrong?

567
00:39:33,311 --> 00:39:35,745
Try getting him to brush his teeth
sometime.

568
00:39:35,814 --> 00:39:39,113
What I'm trying to teach him
and what he's learning there

569
00:39:39,184 --> 00:39:41,084
are two very different things.

570
00:39:41,152 --> 00:39:43,586
Park hustlers play
tactics, not position.

571
00:39:43,655 --> 00:39:46,089
They rely on wild,
unpredictable moves

572
00:39:46,157 --> 00:39:47,749
meant to intimidate
their opponents.

573
00:39:47,826 --> 00:39:50,761
Great in a two-minute
speed game for drug money,

574
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:53,923
but it'll cost Josh
dearly in real games.

575
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:56,524
Well, he's learning
some new words.

576
00:39:59,137 --> 00:40:02,595
Could you keep him from playing there
so much?

577
00:40:02,674 --> 00:40:03,674
Sure.

578
00:40:03,675 --> 00:40:04,972
No.

579
00:40:07,212 --> 00:40:10,079
Not playing in the park
would kill him. He loves it.

580
00:40:10,148 --> 00:40:12,548
Just makes my job harder.

581
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:15,748
Then your job's harder.

582
00:40:25,497 --> 00:40:27,089
What are you talking about?

583
00:40:27,165 --> 00:40:29,633
We're already packed.
We're, like, out the door.

584
00:40:29,701 --> 00:40:33,000
Make sure his laces are tied
if there's escalators.

585
00:40:33,071 --> 00:40:35,505
I don't know why
I O.K.'d this anyway.

586
00:40:35,573 --> 00:40:38,007
Well, you didn't.
He wants to do this.

587
00:40:38,076 --> 00:40:39,509
I should've dissuaded him.

588
00:40:39,577 --> 00:40:41,511
I grew up playing
in tournaments.

589
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:44,013
They have nothing to do
with what's important.

590
00:40:44,082 --> 00:40:46,346
They're about all
winning and losing. So?

591
00:40:46,418 --> 00:40:47,783
It's not chess.

592
00:40:47,852 --> 00:40:49,149
Ah. Chess is art.

593
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,482
That's right.

594
00:40:50,555 --> 00:40:53,490
No. Chess is you appreciating
the beauty of Josh's play

595
00:40:53,558 --> 00:40:55,150
at 60 bucks an hour.

596
00:40:55,226 --> 00:40:59,162
Will you be ready to go
in 30 minutes or not?

597
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,754
He's not coming.

598
00:41:00,832 --> 00:41:02,424
May I talk to him?

599
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,500
Hold on.

600
00:41:03,501 --> 00:41:04,501
Josh!

601
00:41:04,502 --> 00:41:05,628
I don't...

602
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,205
Telephone.

603
00:41:13,845 --> 00:41:14,937
Hi.

604
00:41:15,013 --> 00:41:17,345
Josh, how are you doing?
You excited?

605
00:41:17,415 --> 00:41:18,415
Yeah.

606
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:20,008
Listen, I can't make it.

607
00:41:20,085 --> 00:41:24,021
I've got some things
I have to take care of.

608
00:41:24,089 --> 00:41:25,215
Hmm.

609
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,290
That's O.K.

610
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:27,883
I'll be thinking of you.

611
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:29,790
You'll do great, I know it.

612
00:41:29,861 --> 00:41:32,295
And I'll see you
when you get back.

613
00:41:32,363 --> 00:41:33,363
O.K.

614
00:41:33,364 --> 00:41:34,456
Bye.

615
00:41:34,532 --> 00:41:38,229
O.K. bye. Don't bring
your queen out too soon...

616
00:41:56,054 --> 00:41:58,544
This is great.

617
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,059
Which one's yours?

618
00:42:18,498 --> 00:42:20,363
Over there by the steps.

619
00:42:20,433 --> 00:42:22,230
Oh. That...
That one's mine.

620
00:42:22,301 --> 00:42:23,734
All right, yeah.
What?

621
00:42:23,803 --> 00:42:25,794
Looks like they're friends
already.

622
00:42:28,674 --> 00:42:30,403
Uh, what's his rating?

623
00:42:38,351 --> 00:42:39,409
15.

624
00:42:41,187 --> 00:42:42,211
15 hundred?

625
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:45,187
Yeah.

626
00:42:48,528 --> 00:42:50,018
How old is he?

627
00:42:50,096 --> 00:42:51,791
7.

628
00:42:51,864 --> 00:42:53,422
7.

629
00:42:53,499 --> 00:42:57,299
Well, I doubt that they'll be playing
each other then.

630
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:59,634
Morgan's not rated 1,000 yet.

631
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:00,705
Oh.

632
00:43:07,813 --> 00:43:08,939
15 hundred?

633
00:43:11,117 --> 00:43:14,052
Questions during
the course of the game,

634
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,553
raise your hand.

635
00:43:15,621 --> 00:43:19,614
He was cheating. He tried to castle
when I had him checked.

636
00:43:19,692 --> 00:43:25,324
O.K., I want to remind you
to conduct yourselves

637
00:43:25,398 --> 00:43:26,831
Like adults.

638
00:43:26,899 --> 00:43:28,764
I don't want any trouble.

639
00:43:28,834 --> 00:43:31,769
And you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

640
00:43:31,837 --> 00:43:34,772
If you're going
to watch the game,

641
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,571
do so from behind the player.

642
00:43:38,644 --> 00:43:40,134
No throat noises.

643
00:43:41,681 --> 00:43:43,114
No comments.

644
00:43:44,517 --> 00:43:46,781
No eye contact.

645
00:43:46,852 --> 00:43:50,652
Nobody cares if you're
guilty or not.

646
00:43:50,723 --> 00:43:52,657
If you all behave yourselves,

647
00:43:52,725 --> 00:43:56,286
I think we'll all have
a very good time.

648
00:43:56,362 --> 00:43:57,795
I'm not kidding.

649
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,965
Listen, my son can't play
with these pieces.

650
00:44:02,034 --> 00:44:03,968
My daughter needs her own clock.

651
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:11,106
Oh, this is unfair.

652
00:44:11,177 --> 00:44:13,407
Start...

653
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:14,741
your clocks.

654
00:44:46,078 --> 00:44:48,911
I did not pull on my ear!

655
00:44:48,981 --> 00:44:50,915
You pulled on your ear!

656
00:44:50,983 --> 00:44:53,474
I did not!
I scratched my ear!

657
00:44:53,552 --> 00:44:55,486
- You're a liar!
- Break it up!

658
00:44:55,554 --> 00:44:57,146
He's out of his mind!

659
00:44:57,223 --> 00:44:58,247
Break it up!

660
00:44:58,324 --> 00:44:59,757
I don't care!

661
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:01,690
Take your hands off me!

662
00:45:01,761 --> 00:45:04,161
You're the one
who's trying to...

663
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,061
We just came to have fun.

664
00:45:06,132 --> 00:45:07,394
I don't understand this.

665
00:45:08,567 --> 00:45:09,567
Hey!

666
00:45:09,568 --> 00:45:10,967
Hey, what... Hey!

667
00:45:25,251 --> 00:45:29,745
See, you can call me
the man of many signals.

668
00:45:29,822 --> 00:45:30,822
Many signals.

669
00:45:30,823 --> 00:45:32,757
Knock it off, for Christ's sake.

670
00:45:32,825 --> 00:45:35,760
I don't want to "knock it off,
for Christ's sake."

671
00:45:35,828 --> 00:45:37,762
I'm a man of many signals.

672
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:40,765
Yeah, I pull
my nose, my elbow...

673
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:43,267
and whatever else
I want to pull.

674
00:45:45,338 --> 00:45:49,274
You play the game fair.
That's the way it's played.

675
00:45:49,342 --> 00:45:52,277
So... you see me
pulling my ear,

676
00:45:52,345 --> 00:45:53,869
it's not an itch.

677
00:45:55,348 --> 00:45:58,442
You might think it's an itch,
but it's not an itch.

678
00:46:00,353 --> 00:46:02,685
So watch for the subtleness.

679
00:46:04,023 --> 00:46:07,720
You're lucky you don't get nervous
at these things.

680
00:46:33,652 --> 00:46:34,744
Hi.

681
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:36,754
If your son wins his game

682
00:46:36,822 --> 00:46:38,414
and my son wins his,

683
00:46:38,491 --> 00:46:42,427
they'll be playing each other
in the final round.

684
00:46:42,495 --> 00:46:43,928
I can hardly wait.

685
00:46:43,996 --> 00:46:46,430
Hey! It's only a game.

686
00:46:48,334 --> 00:46:50,928
I'm going to get myself
a tuna fish sandwich.

687
00:46:51,003 --> 00:46:53,437
- Can I get you a sandwich?
- No, that's...

688
00:46:53,506 --> 00:46:56,100
I'm going to get you
a tuna fish sandwich.

689
00:47:17,296 --> 00:47:18,729
Queen takes pawn.

690
00:47:25,871 --> 00:47:29,307
Josh is in trouble.
He's down another pawn.

691
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:34,245
Don't you believe it.
Your boy'll pull it out.

692
00:47:35,481 --> 00:47:37,915
No, he's down too much material.

693
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,416
He's going to lose.

694
00:47:51,831 --> 00:47:53,696
Knight takes rook.

695
00:47:58,637 --> 00:48:00,969
Petey just hung his rook!

696
00:48:05,611 --> 00:48:08,045
He probably sacrificed it
for position.

697
00:48:08,113 --> 00:48:11,014
He's probably still got
the advantage.

698
00:48:31,303 --> 00:48:32,497
It's over.

699
00:48:36,175 --> 00:48:37,767
Wha... d...

700
00:48:43,616 --> 00:48:45,174
Who won?

701
00:49:30,796 --> 00:49:34,232
In school,
before he dropped out,

702
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,733
Bobby studied chess books

703
00:49:35,801 --> 00:49:38,429
while his teachers
taught other things.

704
00:49:39,886 --> 00:49:42,878
When they told him
to put his books away,

705
00:49:42,955 --> 00:49:44,388
or took them away,

706
00:49:44,457 --> 00:49:46,391
he studied in his head.

707
00:49:46,459 --> 00:49:49,895
When a science report
came back to him once

708
00:49:49,962 --> 00:49:52,294
with the words
"not satisfactory"

709
00:49:52,365 --> 00:49:53,798
written across the top,

710
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:55,299
he wrote under it

711
00:49:55,368 --> 00:49:58,030
just as big,

712
00:49:58,104 --> 00:49:59,104
"Tough."

713
00:50:00,773 --> 00:50:02,206
He was 14

714
00:50:02,275 --> 00:50:05,210
and had already beaten
the strongest adult players

715
00:50:05,278 --> 00:50:06,802
in the country

716
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:09,814
to become the youngest
U.S. champion ever.

717
00:50:17,256 --> 00:50:19,850
Welch is on the mound.
Now Casey signals.

718
00:50:19,926 --> 00:50:21,295
He winds up...
the pitch!

719
00:50:21,296 --> 00:50:22,296
He winds up...
the pitch!

720
00:50:31,273 --> 00:50:32,273
Bye, mom.

721
00:50:32,274 --> 00:50:33,298
Have fun.

722
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:35,707
We'll call you
when we get there.

723
00:50:35,777 --> 00:50:36,777
Bye!

724
00:50:43,652 --> 00:50:45,176
There's your dad.

725
00:50:52,227 --> 00:50:53,626
Yes!

726
00:50:53,695 --> 00:50:56,129
Look at this.
Look at this. See this?

727
00:50:56,198 --> 00:50:58,792
None of you patzers
ever won anything like this.

728
00:50:58,867 --> 00:51:01,461
Shut up.
We're trying to play a game.

729
00:51:01,536 --> 00:51:02,969
He gets it,

730
00:51:03,038 --> 00:51:04,665
throws to first...

731
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:05,798
Gets him!

732
00:51:05,874 --> 00:51:07,808
And one out.

733
00:51:09,745 --> 00:51:10,745
Thanks.

734
00:51:16,551 --> 00:51:20,988
That's a high-15
instead of a high-5.

735
00:51:21,056 --> 00:51:24,787
I think we got it
in the bag now.

736
00:51:25,861 --> 00:51:27,226
Come on, Bruce!

737
00:51:29,298 --> 00:51:30,298
All right.

738
00:51:40,108 --> 00:51:41,700
The windup and...

739
00:51:41,777 --> 00:51:42,777
the pitch!

740
00:51:44,713 --> 00:51:45,713
Great.

741
00:51:48,951 --> 00:51:50,145
He's out.

742
00:51:56,458 --> 00:51:57,891
Oop!

743
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:01,359
And in first place...
Josh Waitzkin.

744
00:52:24,753 --> 00:52:25,753
Mr. Waitzkin?

745
00:52:25,754 --> 00:52:27,346
Oh, Hi.
How you doing?

746
00:52:27,422 --> 00:52:29,856
Hi. I'm so glad
you could make it.

747
00:52:29,925 --> 00:52:31,859
Me, too.
This is really great.

748
00:52:31,927 --> 00:52:34,521
Isn't it? The children worked
very hard on it.

749
00:52:34,596 --> 00:52:37,531
I understand from Josh
you just got back from Washington.

750
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,032
I think that's super.

751
00:52:39,101 --> 00:52:40,534
Yeah, it was great.

752
00:52:40,602 --> 00:52:43,036
He told us all about the hotel.

753
00:52:43,105 --> 00:52:44,697
He was impressed with that.

754
00:52:44,773 --> 00:52:47,207
You've been taking him
a lot of places lately.

755
00:52:47,275 --> 00:52:48,708
I think it's good.

756
00:52:48,777 --> 00:52:50,711
It's important
for kids to travel.

757
00:52:50,779 --> 00:52:53,213
It's a great education.
They start to realize

758
00:52:53,281 --> 00:52:56,216
there's more to the world
than Washington Square.

759
00:52:56,284 --> 00:53:00,220
Yes. He's been talking a lot about
Washington Square, too.

760
00:53:00,288 --> 00:53:01,152
Uh...

761
00:53:01,223 --> 00:53:02,656
uh, let's see...

762
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:04,157
we've heard about hotels

763
00:53:04,226 --> 00:53:06,660
in, uh, Syracuse, Philadelphia,

764
00:53:06,728 --> 00:53:07,728
Boston...

765
00:53:07,729 --> 00:53:08,729
Washington now.

766
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:11,164
That seems to be
all he can remember.

767
00:53:11,233 --> 00:53:12,666
Not the White House

768
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:14,167
or the capitol building

769
00:53:14,236 --> 00:53:15,669
or the Lincoln Memorial.

770
00:53:15,737 --> 00:53:17,671
And you're wondering
why that is.

771
00:53:17,739 --> 00:53:20,173
It's because I'm a rotten father.
You're right.

772
00:53:20,242 --> 00:53:22,676
I drag him all over the country

773
00:53:22,744 --> 00:53:24,473
for my own selfish reasons.

774
00:53:24,546 --> 00:53:27,447
Fred! Is Josh falling behind
in his schoolwork?

775
00:53:27,516 --> 00:53:28,608
He is,

776
00:53:28,683 --> 00:53:31,083
but I'm more concerned about
other things...

777
00:53:31,153 --> 00:53:32,450
Like his friendships.

778
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:34,001
- There's a problem there?
- Possibly.

779
00:53:34,022 --> 00:53:36,456
Well, is there or isn't there?

780
00:53:36,525 --> 00:53:37,651
Mr. Waitzkin...

781
00:53:37,726 --> 00:53:40,217
I'm sure he's very good
at this chess thing,

782
00:53:40,295 --> 00:53:42,229
but that isn't
really the issue...

783
00:53:42,297 --> 00:53:43,297
Chess thing.

784
00:53:43,298 --> 00:53:44,298
I'm sorry?

785
00:53:44,299 --> 00:53:45,357
Chess thing.

786
00:53:45,434 --> 00:53:47,959
I'm sure he's good at it,
but I'm worried.

787
00:53:48,036 --> 00:53:49,469
To make an analogy...

788
00:53:49,538 --> 00:53:51,472
If it was like, say...

789
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,973
oh, I don't know...

790
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:54,041
um, cards,

791
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:55,109
pinochle.

792
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:56,110
Pinochle.

793
00:53:56,111 --> 00:53:57,111
For instance.

794
00:53:57,112 --> 00:53:58,112
Pinochle.

795
00:53:58,113 --> 00:53:59,113
Fred...

796
00:54:00,882 --> 00:54:02,372
Bonnie...

797
00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:04,043
She's comparing chess
to pinochle.

798
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:06,553
What am I supposed
to say to that?

799
00:54:06,621 --> 00:54:08,555
She's trying to make a point.

800
00:54:08,623 --> 00:54:10,056
Maybe we should listen.

801
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:13,322
Vinnie thinks he's spending
too much time at it, too.

802
00:54:13,395 --> 00:54:15,795
Vinnie? Vinnie's a drug addict.

803
00:54:15,864 --> 00:54:18,424
I'm supposed to listen to his
opinion, too?

804
00:54:19,534 --> 00:54:21,126
I'm sorry, but your analogy

805
00:54:21,203 --> 00:54:22,795
is a very bad one.

806
00:54:22,871 --> 00:54:25,431
If you want to make
a comparison to something,

807
00:54:25,507 --> 00:54:26,838
have it make sense.

808
00:54:26,908 --> 00:54:29,342
Compare it to math
or music or art,

809
00:54:29,411 --> 00:54:32,346
because otherwise it belittles him
and it and me.

810
00:54:32,414 --> 00:54:34,348
I don't mean to belittle you...

811
00:54:34,416 --> 00:54:37,681
Oh, but you are,
even the way you're looking at me.

812
00:54:37,752 --> 00:54:39,686
Mr. Waitzkin,
I think perhaps...

813
00:54:39,754 --> 00:54:43,190
I'll tell you how good he is.
He's better at this

814
00:54:43,258 --> 00:54:46,694
than I've ever been
at anything in my life.

815
00:54:46,761 --> 00:54:50,697
He's better at this
than you'll ever be at anything.

816
00:54:50,765 --> 00:54:52,699
My son has a gift.

817
00:54:52,767 --> 00:54:56,203
He has a gift,
and once you acknowledge that,

818
00:54:56,271 --> 00:54:57,704
then maybe

819
00:54:57,772 --> 00:55:00,536
we'll have something
to talk about.

820
00:55:02,878 --> 00:55:04,140
Josh.

821
00:55:05,213 --> 00:55:07,147
Chess is what it's called.

822
00:55:07,215 --> 00:55:09,149
Not the "chess thing."

823
00:55:09,217 --> 00:55:10,275
Chess.

824
00:55:20,095 --> 00:55:21,528
What's its number?

825
00:55:21,596 --> 00:55:25,032
It doesn't have a number.
It's a private school.

826
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,830
Only the public schools
have numbers.

827
00:55:27,903 --> 00:55:30,269
It's called Dalton.

828
00:55:32,741 --> 00:55:36,177
You can still see your friends
whenever you want...

829
00:55:36,244 --> 00:55:37,939
After school or on weekends,

830
00:55:38,013 --> 00:55:40,174
when there's not a tournament.

831
00:55:44,586 --> 00:55:46,053
Your friend Morgan goes there.

832
00:55:46,121 --> 00:55:47,554
Morgan goes there?

833
00:55:47,622 --> 00:55:48,782
Oh, yeah.

834
00:55:48,857 --> 00:55:51,883
He wouldn't go there
unless it was great, right?

835
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,393
Ah, it's the best.

836
00:55:53,461 --> 00:55:57,488
They, um,
even have a chess class.

837
00:55:57,566 --> 00:55:59,898
What's the yard like?

838
00:55:59,968 --> 00:56:01,731
The yard?

839
00:56:01,803 --> 00:56:04,738
Do they have good stuff
to climb on?

840
00:56:04,806 --> 00:56:06,034
I'm sure it does.

841
00:56:06,107 --> 00:56:10,043
Um, I haven't seen it,
but I'm sure it's great.

842
00:56:12,514 --> 00:56:16,917
So, um...
what do you think?

843
00:56:16,985 --> 00:56:20,751
If you say it's great,
then it has to be.

844
00:56:37,672 --> 00:56:39,105
It's a mistake.

845
00:56:50,986 --> 00:56:53,716
What was wrong
with the old school?

846
00:56:53,788 --> 00:56:57,224
I don't know.
I guess it was no good.

847
00:56:57,292 --> 00:56:59,226
And the new one's better?

848
00:56:59,294 --> 00:57:01,285
They have a chess class.

849
00:57:01,363 --> 00:57:03,354
They have a chess class.

850
00:57:11,506 --> 00:57:13,371
Are you O.K.?

851
00:57:24,786 --> 00:57:27,812
What the hell's
going on over there?

852
00:57:30,358 --> 00:57:31,916
Bobby Fischer.

853
00:58:02,057 --> 00:58:03,888
Young Fischer.

854
00:58:11,982 --> 00:58:13,074
Check.

855
00:58:14,451 --> 00:58:15,451
Check.

856
00:58:29,332 --> 00:58:31,391
Trick or treat.

857
00:58:38,408 --> 00:58:41,241
Why is black better?
Take your time.

858
00:58:41,311 --> 00:58:43,245
White has more pawn islands.

859
00:58:43,313 --> 00:58:45,076
Which is white's weakest island?

860
00:58:45,148 --> 00:58:46,581
The isolated pawn.

861
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:48,481
Only the king can save it.

862
00:58:48,552 --> 00:58:50,918
That's right.

863
00:58:50,987 --> 00:58:51,987
That's very good.

864
00:58:52,022 --> 00:58:54,354
You just earned
20 master-class points.

865
00:59:24,387 --> 00:59:27,322
You studying up
on your end game, Bruce?

866
00:59:28,892 --> 00:59:32,419
Josh, go get yourself a Coke.
We're through here.

867
00:59:34,397 --> 00:59:36,194
Get yourself a Coke.

868
00:59:42,773 --> 00:59:45,139
What do you want?

869
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:48,177
Hello. How are you?
How have you been?

870
00:59:48,245 --> 00:59:50,509
How's your health?

871
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,514
Any one of these
would be appropriate.

872
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,354
I want to join the club.

873
00:59:59,422 --> 01:00:02,255
Well, actually, not me,
my young friend Jonathan here.

874
01:00:07,264 --> 01:00:10,722
I suggest you bring him back
in a couple of years.

875
01:00:10,801 --> 01:00:12,735
We'd like an application,

876
01:00:12,803 --> 01:00:15,966
if it's not too much trouble.

877
01:00:51,908 --> 01:00:55,537
He's been my student
since he was 4 years old.

878
01:00:55,612 --> 01:00:59,480
His parents
have given him to me.

879
01:00:59,549 --> 01:01:01,483
Does nothing but play chess.

880
01:01:01,551 --> 01:01:02,984
No other interests.

881
01:01:03,053 --> 01:01:04,782
He goes to school?

882
01:01:04,855 --> 01:01:06,379
Oh, no.

883
01:01:06,456 --> 01:01:08,754
Well, that's great.
You should be proud of yourself.

884
01:01:08,825 --> 01:01:10,520
I am.

885
01:01:18,635 --> 01:01:21,263
You should watch him play.
He reminds me of you,

886
01:01:21,338 --> 01:01:23,272
only he never gives up.

887
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:24,340
Josh.

888
01:01:24,341 --> 01:01:26,901
It's not a part
of his character.

889
01:01:26,977 --> 01:01:30,811
He's not going to disappoint
his teacher.

890
01:01:52,903 --> 01:01:56,839
"And when he knew that the cottage
was entirely destroyed,"

891
01:01:56,907 --> 01:02:00,343
the monster screamed once more
in agony and hatred

892
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:04,346
"and retreated backward
to seek refuge in the woods."

893
01:02:07,417 --> 01:02:09,851
Wow! Then it gets really scary

894
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,353
because they chase him

895
01:02:11,421 --> 01:02:13,355
and light torches and stuff.

896
01:02:13,423 --> 01:02:16,153
So we'll get to that tomorrow.

897
01:02:17,427 --> 01:02:18,792
Good night, tiger.

898
01:02:18,862 --> 01:02:19,862
Good night.

899
01:02:29,372 --> 01:02:30,372
Dad...

900
01:02:36,379 --> 01:02:39,109
Maybe we shouldn't go
to the state finals.

901
01:02:49,392 --> 01:02:51,519
What are you talking about?

902
01:02:51,594 --> 01:02:53,027
Of course we're going.

903
01:02:53,096 --> 01:02:56,031
That's what we've worked
so hard for.

904
01:02:56,099 --> 01:02:57,828
If I win...

905
01:03:02,405 --> 01:03:05,340
Everybody will say,
"Well, of course he won.

906
01:03:05,408 --> 01:03:07,933
He's a top-ranked player."

907
01:03:09,012 --> 01:03:11,606
But if I lose...

908
01:03:13,817 --> 01:03:15,614
You won't lose, Josh.

909
01:03:15,685 --> 01:03:17,414
What if I do?

910
01:03:17,487 --> 01:03:19,045
You won't.

911
01:03:19,122 --> 01:03:20,555
I'm afraid I might.

912
01:03:20,623 --> 01:03:24,115
Josh... they're afraid.

913
01:03:25,195 --> 01:03:27,789
They're terrified of you.

914
01:03:34,971 --> 01:03:36,404
Now you get some sleep.

915
01:03:45,382 --> 01:03:48,317
Maybe it's better
not to be the best.

916
01:03:52,622 --> 01:03:56,456
Then you can lose,
and it's O.K.

917
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:17,346
It took people a while
to realize he was really gone.

918
01:04:18,715 --> 01:04:21,309
He disappeared before...

919
01:04:21,384 --> 01:04:23,443
Once for 18months

920
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,718
before the crushing defeat
of Petrosian in Belgrade.

921
01:04:29,959 --> 01:04:32,655
But when he didn't show up
in Manila in '75

922
01:04:32,729 --> 01:04:34,162
to defend his title,

923
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:36,255
they took it away from him

924
01:04:36,332 --> 01:04:39,267
and gave it back
to the Russians.

925
01:04:46,076 --> 01:04:47,509
O.K., let's go.

926
01:04:47,577 --> 01:04:49,511
I'm standing here
with Fred Waitzkin.

927
01:04:49,579 --> 01:04:51,513
I hope I pronounced that right.

928
01:04:51,581 --> 01:04:54,015
Fred, what's it like
being a chess parent?

929
01:04:54,084 --> 01:04:56,018
In my case, the hardest part

930
01:04:56,086 --> 01:04:59,214
is keeping track
of my son's toy cars,

931
01:04:59,289 --> 01:05:02,315
making sure he eats something
other than French fries...

932
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:10,599
Hi.

933
01:05:12,802 --> 01:05:13,928
Hi.

934
01:05:14,003 --> 01:05:16,801
Your son's the odds-on favorite,
I understand.

935
01:05:16,873 --> 01:05:19,808
He's rated number one
in his division, yes.

936
01:05:19,876 --> 01:05:22,743
So every other parent
in this room hates you.

937
01:05:22,812 --> 01:05:24,177
I'm just kidding, Fred.

938
01:05:28,718 --> 01:05:31,653
Thank you, sir.
He can go to his table now.

939
01:05:31,721 --> 01:05:32,721
Next, please.

940
01:06:04,295 --> 01:06:06,923
Oh, my God.

941
01:06:11,902 --> 01:06:13,563
That was quick.

942
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:17,937
I hate this part.

943
01:06:20,911 --> 01:06:22,708
What?

944
01:06:27,351 --> 01:06:29,683
No.

945
01:06:56,881 --> 01:06:58,849
Seven moves.

946
01:07:01,385 --> 01:07:02,545
Seven.

947
01:07:03,888 --> 01:07:08,825
How is it possible
to lose in seven moves?

948
01:07:12,897 --> 01:07:15,331
Maybe I don't really have it.

949
01:07:15,399 --> 01:07:17,390
Well, you know that's not true.

950
01:07:17,468 --> 01:07:18,833
That's not why this happened.

951
01:07:18,903 --> 01:07:21,770
I don't understand
why this happened.

952
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:23,636
Why did this happen?

953
01:07:27,344 --> 01:07:29,812
Well, think.

954
01:07:31,115 --> 01:07:32,548
Take your time.

955
01:07:32,616 --> 01:07:36,052
Take more time than you took
losing to that patzer

956
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,610
and figure it out.

957
01:07:37,688 --> 01:07:40,088
Did you fall for a trap?

958
01:07:40,157 --> 01:07:43,092
Did you bring your queen out early

959
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:46,960
even though Bruce warned you
time and again about that?

960
01:07:48,866 --> 01:07:51,266
Maybe he's just better than me.

961
01:07:51,335 --> 01:07:54,270
No, don't tell me
that kid's better than you

962
01:07:54,338 --> 01:07:55,805
because he isn't.

963
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:10,485
Why are you standing
so far away from me?

964
01:08:23,901 --> 01:08:25,391
Come here.

965
01:08:32,643 --> 01:08:34,008
It's O.K.

966
01:08:37,348 --> 01:08:38,542
It's O.K.

967
01:08:40,651 --> 01:08:41,879
I'm sorry.

968
01:08:45,356 --> 01:08:48,291
For all his natural ability,
Bobby Fischer studied harder

969
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:50,293
than any player who ever lived.

970
01:08:50,361 --> 01:08:52,295
He woke up thinking about chess.

971
01:08:52,363 --> 01:08:55,298
He went to bed thinking about it.
He dreamt about it.

972
01:08:55,366 --> 01:08:57,800
Why? Isn't it enough
to be a natural?

973
01:08:57,868 --> 01:09:00,302
If you don't care about winning,
it's enough,

974
01:09:00,371 --> 01:09:02,305
but he wanted to win.

975
01:09:02,373 --> 01:09:04,307
He had to be champion,

976
01:09:04,375 --> 01:09:07,310
and in order to do that,
he had to work,

977
01:09:07,378 --> 01:09:09,812
which is what we're going to do.

978
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,177
O.K.

979
01:09:11,248 --> 01:09:14,183
Promise you won't
argue moves with me,

980
01:09:14,251 --> 01:09:16,981
no matter how much
you think you're right.

981
01:09:17,054 --> 01:09:18,146
I promise.

982
01:09:18,222 --> 01:09:20,986
Everything I tell you
imagine is coming from him

983
01:09:21,058 --> 01:09:23,492
because I know
every game he ever played,

984
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,495
so, in effect, he's going to be
teaching you,

985
01:09:26,563 --> 01:09:28,224
and you'll become him.

986
01:09:28,299 --> 01:09:29,299
Promise.

987
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:30,300
All right.

988
01:09:31,335 --> 01:09:32,996
Some new rules...

989
01:09:34,638 --> 01:09:36,401
No more speed chess.

990
01:09:36,473 --> 01:09:39,909
I know you like it,
I know it's fun,

991
01:09:39,977 --> 01:09:41,410
but it's no good.

992
01:09:41,478 --> 01:09:44,845
It ruined Arbakov,
and it'll ruin you.

993
01:09:44,915 --> 01:09:47,850
And no more games
in Washington Square.

994
01:09:47,918 --> 01:09:51,513
They're patzers, and they're teaching
you all the wrong things.

995
01:09:51,588 --> 01:09:53,886
They're not patzers.

996
01:09:53,958 --> 01:09:55,050
They're losers,

997
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:58,390
and unless you want to end up
just like them,

998
01:09:58,462 --> 01:10:00,054
you'll stay away.

999
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:02,690
They're not patzers.

1000
01:10:04,935 --> 01:10:06,994
I mean it.

1001
01:10:09,273 --> 01:10:10,273
Now...

1002
01:10:17,614 --> 01:10:18,979
which one is you?

1003
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:21,279
What do you mean?

1004
01:10:21,352 --> 01:10:25,186
I mean, which one is you?

1005
01:10:25,255 --> 01:10:28,122
None of them.
They're just pieces.

1006
01:10:28,192 --> 01:10:30,126
This is you.

1007
01:10:49,847 --> 01:10:51,940
So what's your best move?

1008
01:10:52,016 --> 01:10:53,415
Rook to d 1.

1009
01:10:53,484 --> 01:10:55,418
What about taking on e5?

1010
01:10:55,486 --> 01:10:56,919
What about it?

1011
01:10:56,987 --> 01:10:59,421
You didn't consider it.
You're still not considering it.

1012
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:00,490
Sit up.

1013
01:11:00,557 --> 01:11:03,617
I'm right.
Rook to d 1 is the best move.

1014
01:11:03,694 --> 01:11:05,628
You didn't study the board.

1015
01:11:05,696 --> 01:11:07,926
You're moving
before I know the answers.

1016
01:11:07,998 --> 01:11:09,431
Give me your book.

1017
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,024
Why?

1018
01:11:11,101 --> 01:11:13,467
Give me your book.

1019
01:11:13,537 --> 01:11:14,663
Why?

1020
01:11:14,738 --> 01:11:17,036
You just lost
some master-class points, tiger.

1021
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:18,540
I can't lose points.

1022
01:11:18,609 --> 01:11:22,238
No? You just lost some more
for arguing with me.

1023
01:11:27,818 --> 01:11:29,786
Fine, Tim, it's not enough.

1024
01:11:29,853 --> 01:11:30,853
What's happening?

1025
01:11:30,854 --> 01:11:32,048
What's happening?

1026
01:11:32,122 --> 01:11:35,751
I hear a whole lot of talk
and don't get much for it.

1027
01:11:35,826 --> 01:11:38,226
Ooh, it hurts!

1028
01:11:43,267 --> 01:11:44,325
Damn!

1029
01:11:47,171 --> 01:11:48,331
Damn!

1030
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:55,538
Do you know what the word
contempt means?

1031
01:12:01,351 --> 01:12:05,515
It's to think of others
as being beneath you,

1032
01:12:05,589 --> 01:12:09,150
to be unworthy of being
in the same room with you.

1033
01:12:13,864 --> 01:12:16,332
I don't feel that.

1034
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,994
Well, you better start.

1035
01:12:21,505 --> 01:12:24,440
Because if you don't think
it's a part of winning,

1036
01:12:24,508 --> 01:12:25,600
you're wrong.

1037
01:12:25,676 --> 01:12:28,440
You have to have contempt
for your opponents.

1038
01:12:28,512 --> 01:12:29,945
You have to hate them.

1039
01:12:34,818 --> 01:12:36,911
But I don't.

1040
01:12:36,987 --> 01:12:39,148
They hate you.

1041
01:12:44,828 --> 01:12:46,386
They hate you, Josh.

1042
01:12:50,334 --> 01:12:52,268
I don't hate them.

1043
01:12:53,437 --> 01:12:57,271
Bobby Fischer held the world
in contempt.

1044
01:13:02,112 --> 01:13:03,977
I'm not him.

1045
01:13:13,657 --> 01:13:15,215
You're telling me.

1046
01:13:17,327 --> 01:13:18,726
In the primary division,

1047
01:13:18,795 --> 01:13:21,696
In first place with a perfect
six out of six...

1048
01:13:21,765 --> 01:13:23,528
Jonathan Poe.

1049
01:13:28,305 --> 01:13:31,240
Let's give a round of applause
for all the winners.

1050
01:13:41,318 --> 01:13:43,343
It's white's move.

1051
01:13:49,293 --> 01:13:51,818
Can we expect it any time soon?

1052
01:13:51,895 --> 01:13:54,125
How many points is it worth?

1053
01:13:54,198 --> 01:13:55,961
To make the opening move?

1054
01:13:56,033 --> 01:13:57,330
Yes.

1055
01:13:57,401 --> 01:13:59,926
Forget the points.

1056
01:14:00,003 --> 01:14:02,665
How much is it worth if I do it?

1057
01:14:02,739 --> 01:14:05,537
Do it for its own sake.

1058
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:09,375
I want to know how close I am
to getting the certificate.

1059
01:14:09,446 --> 01:14:10,446
Forget that.

1060
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:11,505
I want to know.

1061
01:14:11,582 --> 01:14:14,016
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

1062
01:14:14,084 --> 01:14:15,483
I don't care.

1063
01:14:15,552 --> 01:14:18,521
I don't understand.

1064
01:14:18,589 --> 01:14:21,683
It's white's move.

1065
01:14:27,297 --> 01:14:28,855
I want the certificate.

1066
01:14:28,932 --> 01:14:30,365
You want the certificate?

1067
01:14:30,434 --> 01:14:32,868
You have to have
the certificate?

1068
01:14:32,936 --> 01:14:35,871
You won't move until you get
the certificate?

1069
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:37,497
You win.

1070
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:40,668
Here's your certificate.
Fill it out.

1071
01:14:42,212 --> 01:14:44,476
Doesn't mean anything.
It's a piece of paper.

1072
01:14:44,548 --> 01:14:46,982
It's a Xerox
of a piece of paper.

1073
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:48,984
Do you want another one?

1074
01:14:49,052 --> 01:14:50,576
Do you want 10?

1075
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:54,818
You want 20?

1076
01:14:56,293 --> 01:14:57,521
30?

1077
01:14:57,594 --> 01:15:00,586
I've got a briefcase full of them.
They mean nothing.

1078
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:08,162
They mean nothing.

1079
01:15:13,443 --> 01:15:15,673
Get out of my house.

1080
01:15:34,364 --> 01:15:37,800
To put a child in a position
to care about winning

1081
01:15:37,868 --> 01:15:40,200
and not to prepare him is wrong.

1082
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:41,703
Get out of my house.

1083
01:16:00,324 --> 01:16:04,420
Look, I know you don't want to admit it,
but he's right.

1084
01:16:04,494 --> 01:16:07,930
I mean, you wouldn't sign your kid up
for little league

1085
01:16:07,998 --> 01:16:10,432
and then not get him a glove.

1086
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,933
You equip him.

1087
01:16:12,002 --> 01:16:13,002
It's over.

1088
01:16:13,003 --> 01:16:15,437
Bonnie, he's in a slump.

1089
01:16:15,505 --> 01:16:17,439
This is a slump.
It happens.

1090
01:16:17,507 --> 01:16:19,372
When you get into a slump,

1091
01:16:19,443 --> 01:16:22,378
you get out of it eventually.
You don't give up.

1092
01:16:22,446 --> 01:16:24,380
This is like baseball to you.

1093
01:16:24,448 --> 01:16:26,882
If you're afraid to lose,
you lose.

1094
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:27,950
He's afraid.

1095
01:16:27,951 --> 01:16:30,647
He's not afraid of losing.

1096
01:16:30,721 --> 01:16:32,313
He's afraid of losing your love.

1097
01:16:32,389 --> 01:16:34,323
How many ballplayers grow up

1098
01:16:34,391 --> 01:16:37,019
afraid of losing
their father's love

1099
01:16:37,094 --> 01:16:39,528
every time they come up
to the plate?

1100
01:16:39,596 --> 01:16:41,029
All of them!

1101
01:16:44,368 --> 01:16:46,802
He knows you disapprove of him.

1102
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:49,304
He knows you think he's weak,

1103
01:16:49,373 --> 01:16:51,466
but he's not weak.

1104
01:16:51,541 --> 01:16:53,532
He's decent.

1105
01:16:54,878 --> 01:16:57,312
And if you or Bruce
or anyone else

1106
01:16:57,381 --> 01:16:59,815
tries to beat that out of him,

1107
01:16:59,883 --> 01:17:02,818
I swear to God
I'll take him away.

1108
01:17:06,623 --> 01:17:10,059
When did you start to get serious
about chess?

1109
01:17:10,127 --> 01:17:11,651
Uh, I got serious, oh...

1110
01:17:13,363 --> 01:17:16,196
hmm, oh, well, I was always
pretty serious about it.

1111
01:17:16,266 --> 01:17:19,326
You know, when I was maybe 7.

1112
01:17:22,973 --> 01:17:26,909
People say they've received letters
from him over the years,

1113
01:17:26,977 --> 01:17:29,571
but never show them.

1114
01:17:31,381 --> 01:17:33,815
They say he lost his nerve,

1115
01:17:33,884 --> 01:17:36,978
and he'll never play again.

1116
01:17:38,355 --> 01:17:40,789
They say he lost his mind

1117
01:17:40,857 --> 01:17:44,293
and roams the streets
of Los Angeles hiding out

1118
01:17:44,361 --> 01:17:46,295
under assumed names.

1119
01:17:46,363 --> 01:17:47,363
Check.

1120
01:17:48,365 --> 01:17:49,365
Check.

1121
01:17:49,433 --> 01:17:51,867
Some people say...

1122
01:17:53,503 --> 01:17:54,503
he's dead.

1123
01:17:56,873 --> 01:17:59,808
I think he's lying low
and getting stronger,

1124
01:17:59,876 --> 01:18:03,505
waiting for just the right
moment to come back

1125
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:05,980
and reclaim his crown.

1126
01:18:33,577 --> 01:18:34,771
Hey, Josh.

1127
01:18:34,845 --> 01:18:35,971
Shh.

1128
01:18:41,307 --> 01:18:43,707
What happened to your room?

1129
01:18:44,844 --> 01:18:46,402
I cleaned it.

1130
01:18:53,219 --> 01:18:54,652
Hey, you know,

1131
01:18:54,721 --> 01:18:57,656
you don't have to
do this anymore.

1132
01:18:57,724 --> 01:19:01,160
You could give it up,
and that's all right with me.

1133
01:19:07,867 --> 01:19:08,959
In fact...

1134
01:19:10,904 --> 01:19:12,633
I want you to.

1135
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:17,309
How can I do that?

1136
01:19:17,377 --> 01:19:20,437
What do you mean?
You just do it.

1137
01:19:23,816 --> 01:19:26,080
But I have to win.

1138
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:30,288
No, that's what I'm saying...
You don't.

1139
01:19:30,356 --> 01:19:33,257
But you told me I did.

1140
01:19:33,326 --> 01:19:37,387
Well, I'm telling you now
that you don't.

1141
01:19:38,464 --> 01:19:40,261
But I do.

1142
01:19:40,333 --> 01:19:42,927
I do.

1143
01:19:43,002 --> 01:19:44,002
Why?

1144
01:19:46,339 --> 01:19:48,273
Because I have to.

1145
01:19:50,843 --> 01:19:51,867
Why?

1146
01:19:51,945 --> 01:19:54,379
It doesn't mean anything.

1147
01:19:54,447 --> 01:19:56,642
It's just a game.

1148
01:19:59,185 --> 01:20:00,812
No, it isn't.

1149
01:20:52,839 --> 01:20:54,329
Good morning.

1150
01:21:01,147 --> 01:21:02,739
These belong to you.

1151
01:21:33,813 --> 01:21:35,440
Want to play?

1152
01:21:42,322 --> 01:21:43,380
Two minutes.

1153
01:21:48,895 --> 01:21:49,895
What's that?

1154
01:21:49,896 --> 01:21:50,896
Schleimann attack.

1155
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:52,898
Where'd you learn that from,
a book?

1156
01:21:52,965 --> 01:21:54,364
My teacher taught me.

1157
01:21:54,434 --> 01:21:57,369
Forget it. Play like you used to...
From the gut.

1158
01:21:57,437 --> 01:21:59,871
Get your pawns rolling
on the queen's side.

1159
01:21:59,939 --> 01:22:02,373
Put it out.
Josh is playing.

1160
01:22:02,442 --> 01:22:05,377
He taught you how not to lose,
not how to win.

1161
01:22:05,445 --> 01:22:08,380
You got to risk losing.
You got to risk everything.

1162
01:22:08,448 --> 01:22:11,383
You got to go
to the edge of defeat.

1163
01:22:11,451 --> 01:22:12,451
But...

1164
01:22:12,452 --> 01:22:14,181
But what? Play.

1165
01:22:14,253 --> 01:22:17,120
Never play the board,
always the man.

1166
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:20,557
You got to play the man
playing the board. Play me.

1167
01:22:20,626 --> 01:22:23,060
You have to beat me,
not the board.

1168
01:22:23,129 --> 01:22:25,563
You're not who I have to play.

1169
01:22:25,631 --> 01:22:27,292
You're playing me now.

1170
01:22:30,236 --> 01:22:32,534
Better.

1171
01:22:32,605 --> 01:22:34,232
All right.

1172
01:22:34,307 --> 01:22:36,741
Better! Yes!
Come on, move.

1173
01:22:36,809 --> 01:22:38,470
Good!

1174
01:22:38,544 --> 01:22:39,841
Yeah!

1175
01:22:39,912 --> 01:22:41,743
All right!

1176
01:22:41,814 --> 01:22:43,213
Better!

1177
01:22:43,282 --> 01:22:44,909
Yeah!

1178
01:22:46,085 --> 01:22:47,882
Good move!

1179
01:22:47,954 --> 01:22:49,251
Yeah!

1180
01:22:49,322 --> 01:22:51,483
Yeah! Uh-huh!

1181
01:22:51,557 --> 01:22:52,683
Yes!

1182
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:53,987
Move!

1183
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:56,551
Ooh, yeah!
Good, good, good! Move!

1184
01:22:56,629 --> 01:22:58,358
Yeah, that's it!

1185
01:22:58,431 --> 01:23:00,365
Ooh, good! Yeah!

1186
01:23:00,433 --> 01:23:01,433
What's that?

1187
01:23:01,434 --> 01:23:02,799
Mate.

1188
01:23:02,869 --> 01:23:04,131
Yeah.

1189
01:23:37,370 --> 01:23:39,600
How's it going?

1190
01:23:39,672 --> 01:23:40,798
All right.

1191
01:23:40,873 --> 01:23:42,033
How's Josh?

1192
01:23:42,108 --> 01:23:43,769
Well, he's good.
Sit down.

1193
01:23:43,843 --> 01:23:46,676
Still planning on going to Chicago
for the nationals?

1194
01:23:46,746 --> 01:23:47,746
Yeah.

1195
01:23:47,747 --> 01:23:49,874
I've seen you both at the park.

1196
01:23:49,949 --> 01:23:53,009
Yeah. We've been
hanging out there a lot.

1197
01:23:53,085 --> 01:23:55,076
Think that's a good idea?

1198
01:23:56,689 --> 01:23:58,122
Yes, I do.

1199
01:23:58,191 --> 01:24:00,659
He's playing better than ever.

1200
01:24:00,726 --> 01:24:02,523
How would you know that?

1201
01:24:06,966 --> 01:24:07,966
You're right.

1202
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,662
I... I don't know.

1203
01:24:10,736 --> 01:24:14,604
But what I do know
is that he likes playing again

1204
01:24:14,674 --> 01:24:17,472
for the first time
in a long time.

1205
01:24:17,543 --> 01:24:19,704
I know you think
you're doing what's best,

1206
01:24:19,779 --> 01:24:23,772
but you're setting him up for
the biggest disappointment of his life.

1207
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:26,751
That other kid isn't
spending his afternoons riding bikes

1208
01:24:26,819 --> 01:24:29,481
and playing Pac-Man,
I can guarantee you that.

1209
01:24:29,555 --> 01:24:31,489
I'm doing the only thing

1210
01:24:31,557 --> 01:24:34,151
I know how to do for Josh.

1211
01:24:34,227 --> 01:24:36,559
I don't know what else to do.

1212
01:24:36,629 --> 01:24:39,621
Don't let him
go down there to lose.

1213
01:24:43,336 --> 01:24:46,464
That's what you can do for him.

1214
01:24:46,539 --> 01:24:47,904
You're his father.
Forbid it.

1215
01:24:47,974 --> 01:24:49,999
I can't do that.

1216
01:24:50,076 --> 01:24:51,100
Fred...

1217
01:24:51,177 --> 01:24:52,508
he's going to get killed.

1218
01:24:52,578 --> 01:24:55,206
There's not going to be
much left of him.

1219
01:24:55,281 --> 01:25:00,719
You have no idea what a fall like this
can do to you.

1220
01:25:00,786 --> 01:25:03,311
I think I do.

1221
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:10,889
You know what?

1222
01:25:10,963 --> 01:25:13,261
You should come down with us.

1223
01:25:13,332 --> 01:25:17,701
It would mean a lot to him to have
you there.

1224
01:25:19,639 --> 01:25:21,732
That I can't do.

1225
01:25:45,398 --> 01:25:47,059
There you go.

1226
01:25:47,133 --> 01:25:48,191
Thank you.

1227
01:25:48,267 --> 01:25:49,928
Thanks.

1228
01:25:50,002 --> 01:25:51,833
Come on, Katya.

1229
01:25:58,411 --> 01:26:01,642
O.K. That's not bad,
but that's not right, O.K.?

1230
01:26:01,714 --> 01:26:03,113
That's not what Casablanca did.

1231
01:26:03,182 --> 01:26:04,672
See?
You want to be patient.

1232
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:06,081
Fools rush in.

1233
01:26:06,152 --> 01:26:08,484
You want to go
to the 7th rank...

1234
01:26:08,554 --> 01:26:10,146
Hi, Morgan.

1235
01:26:10,222 --> 01:26:12,588
Josh, where you been?

1236
01:26:12,658 --> 01:26:14,182
Fishing.

1237
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:17,354
Whoa. Look at this.

1238
01:26:17,430 --> 01:26:21,127
No chess boards, no chess books.

1239
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,363
I wasn't allowed to talk about chess
for two whole weeks.

1240
01:26:24,437 --> 01:26:26,166
Just fish.

1241
01:26:26,238 --> 01:26:27,238
Whoa.

1242
01:26:27,273 --> 01:26:29,211
It was my dad's idea.

1243
01:26:29,345 --> 01:26:31,074
Hey, Kalev.

1244
01:26:31,147 --> 01:26:33,308
How's it going?

1245
01:26:33,382 --> 01:26:34,406
Fishing?

1246
01:26:34,483 --> 01:26:36,542
Sure.

1247
01:26:41,891 --> 01:26:44,758
The 200 young players
finding their seats behind me

1248
01:26:44,827 --> 01:26:47,887
represent some
of the strongest chess minds

1249
01:26:47,963 --> 01:26:49,897
of any age in the country.

1250
01:26:49,965 --> 01:26:53,423
Traveling from as far away
as Alaska and Hawaii,

1251
01:26:53,502 --> 01:26:55,993
they've come here to compete
against each other

1252
01:26:56,071 --> 01:26:58,733
over the course of the next two long,
grueling days.

1253
01:26:58,808 --> 01:27:00,105
To become champion,

1254
01:27:00,176 --> 01:27:02,076
one must win all seven games.

1255
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:03,771
That's right.

1256
01:27:03,846 --> 01:27:04,972
This is Donovan Clennan,

1257
01:27:05,047 --> 01:27:07,447
Director of the National
Scholastic Championship.

1258
01:27:07,516 --> 01:27:08,642
Tell me,

1259
01:27:08,717 --> 01:27:11,618
is the next Bobby Fischer
somewhere in this room?

1260
01:27:11,687 --> 01:27:12,687
Hi, Mom.

1261
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:31,271
This girl you're playing
is ranked 82nd.

1262
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:33,433
All right.
Get through it quick,

1263
01:27:33,509 --> 01:27:36,307
and you can rest
before the next round, O.K.?

1264
01:27:36,378 --> 01:27:37,436
O.K.

1265
01:27:37,513 --> 01:27:40,209
I'll see you in a little while.

1266
01:27:40,282 --> 01:27:41,282
Bye.

1267
01:27:41,283 --> 01:27:43,251
Bye.

1268
01:27:43,319 --> 01:27:44,877
Josh...

1269
01:27:46,622 --> 01:27:47,987
good luck.

1270
01:27:52,428 --> 01:27:57,058
Some of you maybe unfamiliar
with sudden death rules.

1271
01:27:57,132 --> 01:28:01,432
If you're writing moves down
while a player gets down

1272
01:28:01,503 --> 01:28:06,031
to where there's less
than five minutes left,

1273
01:28:06,108 --> 01:28:09,475
it's no longer
your responsibility to...

1274
01:28:09,545 --> 01:28:10,545
Hi.

1275
01:28:10,546 --> 01:28:12,138
Hi.

1276
01:28:12,214 --> 01:28:14,307
Is that clear?

1277
01:28:14,383 --> 01:28:15,611
Good luck.

1278
01:28:15,684 --> 01:28:17,049
One more thing...

1279
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:18,677
If you have a problem...

1280
01:28:18,754 --> 01:28:20,051
Morgan.

1281
01:28:20,122 --> 01:28:23,319
If you have a problem,
you don't have to discuss it

1282
01:28:23,392 --> 01:28:24,757
with your opponent.

1283
01:28:24,827 --> 01:28:27,660
All these people
with purple hats around here,

1284
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:29,493
they'll be wandering around.

1285
01:28:29,565 --> 01:28:32,500
Just put your hand up,
and they'll straighten it up.

1286
01:28:32,568 --> 01:28:35,594
O.K. Just hold up your hand,
and they'll see it.

1287
01:28:35,671 --> 01:28:38,731
Don't argue with your opponent.

1288
01:28:38,807 --> 01:28:40,035
That's ridiculous.

1289
01:28:40,109 --> 01:28:41,542
O.K. good luck.

1290
01:28:41,610 --> 01:28:43,077
Start your clocks.

1291
01:30:34,823 --> 01:30:36,791
Can I come in?

1292
01:30:56,412 --> 01:30:58,107
How are you feeling?

1293
01:31:02,418 --> 01:31:03,976
Scared?

1294
01:31:05,621 --> 01:31:07,919
I can't beat him.

1295
01:31:10,559 --> 01:31:11,992
You might be right.

1296
01:31:12,061 --> 01:31:14,495
I'm not supposed to say that,

1297
01:31:14,563 --> 01:31:17,726
but you'd know I was lying if I said
anything else.

1298
01:31:23,605 --> 01:31:25,129
I have something for you.

1299
01:31:33,415 --> 01:31:36,282
It says,

1300
01:31:36,351 --> 01:31:42,017
"This is to certify that Josh Waitzkin,
on this day,"

1301
01:31:42,091 --> 01:31:45,117
has in the eyes
of his teacher...

1302
01:31:48,297 --> 01:31:51,323
"attained the rank
of Grandmaster."

1303
01:32:19,962 --> 01:32:23,728
I have never been so proud
of anyone in my life.

1304
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:31,605
I'm honored to call myself
your teacher.

1305
01:32:42,284 --> 01:32:45,253
I'm so scared.

1306
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:46,320
I know.

1307
01:32:58,934 --> 01:33:03,166
Will you stay until it's over?

1308
01:33:03,238 --> 01:33:05,206
Will I stay?

1309
01:33:08,744 --> 01:33:12,202
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1310
01:34:00,095 --> 01:34:02,825
It's unsettling, isn't it?

1311
01:34:02,898 --> 01:34:06,334
When you realize there are only
so many things

1312
01:34:06,401 --> 01:34:08,767
you can teach a child.

1313
01:34:08,837 --> 01:34:11,271
And finally...

1314
01:34:13,075 --> 01:34:15,566
they are who they are.

1315
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,541
Good luck.

1316
01:34:24,486 --> 01:34:26,818
Good luck.

1317
01:34:29,958 --> 01:34:31,357
Start your clocks.

1318
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:50,640
What's happening?

1319
01:34:50,641 --> 01:34:52,040
Why isn't he moving?

1320
01:34:52,109 --> 01:34:53,804
Letting his time run.

1321
01:34:53,877 --> 01:34:55,777
Trying to psych Josh out.

1322
01:35:23,807 --> 01:35:26,435
Don't do it, Josh.

1323
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:28,102
Don't even think about it.

1324
01:35:28,178 --> 01:35:29,178
Bring her out.

1325
01:35:31,548 --> 01:35:32,606
Keep her back.

1326
01:35:32,683 --> 01:35:33,809
Bring her out, Josh.

1327
01:35:39,589 --> 01:35:40,589
Oh, Jesus!

1328
01:35:40,590 --> 01:35:42,285
What?

1329
01:36:20,364 --> 01:36:21,797
Is it over?

1330
01:36:21,865 --> 01:36:23,662
Over? He's setting him up.

1331
01:36:23,734 --> 01:36:25,599
Josh is setting him up now.

1332
01:36:25,669 --> 01:36:27,136
I taught him that.

1333
01:36:51,495 --> 01:36:52,689
Check.

1334
01:37:09,546 --> 01:37:10,638
There it is!

1335
01:37:19,222 --> 01:37:20,655
Trick or treat.

1336
01:37:57,094 --> 01:37:58,789
That was a mistake.

1337
01:37:58,862 --> 01:38:00,693
What was a mistake?

1338
01:38:00,764 --> 01:38:02,925
Who made a mistake?

1339
01:38:06,236 --> 01:38:08,170
Look deep, Josh. It's there.

1340
01:38:08,238 --> 01:38:10,468
It's 12 moves away,
but it's there.

1341
01:38:10,540 --> 01:38:12,007
You've got him.

1342
01:38:12,075 --> 01:38:14,441
Take his pawn with your pawn.

1343
01:38:14,511 --> 01:38:19,278
G takes F6 forking
his bishop and rook.

1344
01:38:19,349 --> 01:38:21,681
Don't take back
with your bishop.

1345
01:38:21,751 --> 01:38:24,879
You'll need that to guard e7.

1346
01:38:24,955 --> 01:38:26,388
He'll take back,

1347
01:38:26,456 --> 01:38:28,515
either with his bishop
or his knight.

1348
01:38:28,592 --> 01:38:31,527
When he does,
this is the hard part,

1349
01:38:31,595 --> 01:38:33,495
sacrifice your rook.

1350
01:38:33,563 --> 01:38:35,793
Capture him on f6
and get him to check.

1351
01:38:35,866 --> 01:38:37,231
King has to take your rook.

1352
01:38:37,300 --> 01:38:38,426
He takes f6.

1353
01:38:38,502 --> 01:38:41,232
Give him the knight to check e7,

1354
01:38:41,304 --> 01:38:42,965
forking his king and his rook.

1355
01:38:43,039 --> 01:38:44,904
He'll move to safety.

1356
01:38:44,975 --> 01:38:46,499
King f5.

1357
01:38:46,576 --> 01:38:48,635
Take his rook with your knight.

1358
01:38:48,712 --> 01:38:50,805
He'll take back with his king,

1359
01:38:50,881 --> 01:38:52,712
and you've got him.

1360
01:38:54,918 --> 01:38:57,409
Don't move until you see it.

1361
01:38:57,487 --> 01:39:00,615
I can't see it.

1362
01:39:00,690 --> 01:39:03,682
Don't move until you see it.

1363
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,990
I can't see it.

1364
01:39:06,062 --> 01:39:09,862
Don't move until you see it.

1365
01:39:09,933 --> 01:39:12,401
I'm sorry, Dad.

1366
01:39:14,237 --> 01:39:16,831
Here, I'll make it
easier for you.

1367
01:39:50,774 --> 01:39:52,332
He's got it.

1368
01:39:52,409 --> 01:39:54,468
He's got it?

1369
01:39:54,544 --> 01:39:56,512
How do you know he's got it?

1370
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:58,013
He's got it.

1371
01:40:05,789 --> 01:40:07,347
What?

1372
01:40:11,761 --> 01:40:13,661
Come on, move.

1373
01:40:18,902 --> 01:40:21,427
What's that supposed to mean?

1374
01:40:21,504 --> 01:40:23,335
What's that supposed to mean?

1375
01:40:23,406 --> 01:40:25,203
He's offering him a draw.

1376
01:40:25,275 --> 01:40:27,243
I'm offering you a draw.

1377
01:40:27,310 --> 01:40:29,574
Draw? You've got
to be kidding.

1378
01:40:37,220 --> 01:40:38,551
You've lost.

1379
01:40:38,622 --> 01:40:40,920
You just don't know it.

1380
01:40:40,991 --> 01:40:42,288
I've lost?

1381
01:40:42,359 --> 01:40:43,792
Look at the board.

1382
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:46,420
I have.

1383
01:40:46,496 --> 01:40:51,456
Take the draw,
and we'll share the championship.

1384
01:40:55,205 --> 01:40:57,969
Take the draw.

1385
01:41:05,515 --> 01:41:07,005
Move.

1386
01:42:00,614 --> 01:42:02,081
Check.

1387
01:42:38,051 --> 01:42:39,051
Good game.

1388
01:42:56,703 --> 01:42:57,703
Yay!

1389
01:42:57,704 --> 01:42:59,729
Hey, you did good.

1390
01:42:59,806 --> 01:43:02,070
All right!

1391
01:43:15,055 --> 01:43:16,147
Yes!

1392
01:43:16,223 --> 01:43:17,884
Josh, my man.

1393
01:43:17,958 --> 01:43:19,323
All right! All right!

1394
01:43:19,393 --> 01:43:20,393
My man!

1395
01:43:25,766 --> 01:43:28,496
I'm so proud of you.
I knew you could do it.

1396
01:43:28,568 --> 01:43:31,628
I told you. I told you.

1397
01:43:34,508 --> 01:43:36,373
Bobby Fischer played
in Washington Square Park, too.

1398
01:43:36,443 --> 01:43:37,774
See this? Look. Josh Waitzkin.

1399
01:43:37,844 --> 01:43:39,243
Morgan, what...

1400
01:43:39,312 --> 01:43:41,246
Morgan...

1401
01:43:41,314 --> 01:43:42,542
will you come here?

1402
01:43:51,391 --> 01:43:54,360
I tried to give him a way out.

1403
01:43:54,428 --> 01:43:56,658
I know you did.

1404
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:10,141
Why did you bring
the queen out so early?

1405
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:11,939
You know what I'm saying?

1406
01:44:12,012 --> 01:44:14,003
You know what I'm saying?

1407
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:17,572
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1408
01:44:17,651 --> 01:44:19,414
Are you listening to me?

1409
01:44:21,054 --> 01:44:23,488
What happened?

1410
01:44:23,557 --> 01:44:24,557
I lost.

1411
01:44:24,558 --> 01:44:25,889
That's all.

1412
01:44:28,261 --> 01:44:30,695
What did your dad say?

1413
01:44:30,764 --> 01:44:33,392
"You should have
taken out your knight"

1414
01:44:33,467 --> 01:44:35,492
instead of your queen.

1415
01:44:35,569 --> 01:44:37,696
"You took out your queen
too early."

1416
01:44:37,771 --> 01:44:40,103
I do that, too.

1417
01:44:42,175 --> 01:44:44,109
That's all he said?

1418
01:44:44,177 --> 01:44:45,667
Pretty much.

1419
01:44:49,216 --> 01:44:50,649
Morgan...

1420
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:55,153
you want to know a secret?

1421
01:44:57,457 --> 01:45:00,358
I'm going to tell you a secret.

1422
01:45:02,796 --> 01:45:07,290
You're a much stronger player
than I was at your age.

1423
01:45:09,536 --> 01:45:11,808
Thanks.
