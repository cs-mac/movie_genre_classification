1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,247
Ah, we're early.

2
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:16,548
Good.

3
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,084
Could've slept
an extra 20 minutes, man.

4
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:21,620
Well, now we have plenty of time
to eat our breakfast.

5
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,622
Huh? What do you want,

6
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,657
you want the onion or do you
want the everything?

7
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:27,559
I know what you want,
you want that everything.

8
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,595
There you go. Eat that up.

9
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:31,764
Okay.

10
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,567
Uh, there's no cream cheese.

11
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,770
Well, they must have forgotten it.
And you forgot to check

12
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:39,605
because you were
in such a rush to get here

13
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:41,340
so we could be early, right?

14
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:44,376
Well, being early is not
going to kill you, Travis.

15
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,578
You know what I'm going to do?
Take a nap.

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,214
Wait for everyone else
to get here.

17
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,485
You know, being early
is better than being late.

18
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:57,222
I don't want to be late.
I want to be on time.

19
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,657
If you don't leave
yourself a cushion

20
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,626
and something goes wrong,
then you are late.

21
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:02,261
Wes, something going wrong

22
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:04,630
is a perfectly valid
excuse to be late.

23
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:04,630
Good morning!

24
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:08,133
I love it when my
clients are eager

25
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,601
to get started.
Ah, yes.

26
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,570
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

27
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,606
if you're not early,
you're late.

28
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,146
Uh, maybe two to
three times a week.

29
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,451
Per week?!

30
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:27,486
Oh, to be young.

31
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,688
Just tell us, have you two
had sex yet today?

32
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,391
Wes?

33
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:34,693
I respect everyone here,
but this conversation

34
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,628
doesn't apply to us.

35
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,664
We don't live together.

36
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:43,735
We have romantic relationships
outside of this room.

37
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,571
- We're not a couple.
- All right.

38
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:48,640
Not in the traditional sense,
but you're a partnership.

39
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:49,875
And you're having
partnership issues,

40
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,510
which is why you're here.

41
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,579
Look, you can play whatever
word games you want here.

42
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:54,780
We're not a real couple.

43
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,648
I mean, we don't have...

44
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,851
No.
No. Yeah.

45
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,247
Listen to this:

46
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:31,717
"Cooper was unique in major bank
robbers in that he

47
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:34,453
successfully pulled off
his theft alone."

48
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,690
Well, the robbery
was successful.

49
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,826
The escape left something
to be desired.

50
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,562
Cooper here's a genuine star.

51
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:44,930
All the inmates loved him.

52
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:47,533
Sounds like you
want an autograph, Opie.

53
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:51,236
Your ass is still mine, convict.
Whatever you say, Red

54
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,705
You really think the money's
hidden all the way out here?

55
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,440
My bet is this is
all just an excuse

56
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,708
to get a little fresh air.

57
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,877
No money, no deal.

58
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,812
It's a lot of money.
People missed it.

59
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:04,483
What deal did you give him? He'll
be out in five with good behavior.

60
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:07,886
Good behavior...

61
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:11,356
See, that's always been
a problem for me.

62
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,361
Up on the right, boys.

63
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:37,849
Is that it?

64
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,321
Hah! Just like I told you.

65
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:43,755
Come see for yourself.

66
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,258
Here we are, boys.

67
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,960
Hello, beautiful.

68
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:48,961
Let's see it.

69
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:50,829
You got it.

70
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,798
Everybody back up.

71
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,934
Weapons down--
on the ground.

72
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:57,936
I am not kidding.

73
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:58,503
Hey!

74
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,242
Rest of you guys,
guns on the ground.

75
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,244
Do it!

76
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,022
Grenade!

77
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,957
<i>Ten years ago,</i>
<i>Cooper Willilams took</i>

78
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,894
five million dollars in cash
from a bank in Century City.

79
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,530
Now, we caught him
a half an hour later.

80
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,399
But we never found the money.

81
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,000
Hm.

82
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,635
Probably heard that he
escaped this weekend,

83
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,904
and our friends at the FBI
have asked for our help.

84
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,939
I don't have any friends
in the FBI.

85
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,842
Yeah, just once, I want to
dump a case on them. Yeah.

86
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,312
Cooper shot a cop while
he was escaping.

87
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,881
Last person to see him was
the DA, who he kidnapped

88
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,949
and then kicked out
of the car at Lancaster.

89
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,851
On the slight chance
that this money

90
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,987
might still be in Los Angeles,

91
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,822
they figure he'll
come back for it.

92
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,725
Now, Kate and Amy,

93
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,561
I want you to look up some of
Cooper's old associates.

94
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,963
There's also a book
written about him.

95
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:35,067
Travis, Wes,
go to see the author

96
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:37,102
and see if she can give us
some insight, huh?

97
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,970
Let me see the picture.

98
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,107
Seven...

99
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,977
Well, I took two off because
it's probably airbrushed.

100
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,647
Stop talking.
You're a pig.

101
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:51,616
You know you can report him for sexual harassment.
Oh, thanks for your support.

102
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,652
You're welcome.
Get out.

103
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:56,355
Okay.
Yes sir.

104
00:05:56,357 --> 00:06:00,025
<i>I've written about</i>
<i>a lot of crimes.</i>

105
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,526
But I've never been
in the middle

106
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,595
of an active investigation.

107
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:07,933
Have you heard from him?
Me? Oh, gosh, no.

108
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:10,369
I wish.

109
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,471
Well, I mean, that would be
good publicity for the book.

110
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:14,072
But, um, why would he
contact me?

111
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,941
He doesn't know
anybody on the outside.

112
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:20,612
And you spent all that time
interviewing him.

113
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:23,115
Why would he risk getting caught
by coming back to Los Angeles?

114
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:26,151
Yeah, I'm sure you're
right, but we have to do this.

115
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,720
So, do you have any idea where
he'd go if he did get out?

116
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,790
Look, I hate to say this,
but I think you guys

117
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,992
are wasting your time.

118
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,094
This guy is a genius.

119
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,562
My partner thinks
he's a genius.

120
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,701
Look, I've interviewed
hundreds of criminals,

121
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,436
And he is the
smartest one by far.

122
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:47,639
He his five million dollars
in half an hour

123
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:48,874
in one of the most
populated cities

124
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:51,076
- and no one's ever found it.
- Yeah...

125
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:54,045
Well, you may think it'd be a
great idea for your book

126
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,547
if he did contact you,
but remember,

127
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,183
this is a dangerous
armed felon.

128
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,585
If you hear from him,
you let us know, okay?

129
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,054
Promise. But I don't think
I'm going to hear from him.

130
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:06,792
He's...
A genius. Got it.

131
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,469
Something about this
writer that bothers me.

132
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:20,105
Just because a woman doesn't
respond to your advances,

133
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,607
doesn't mean there's
something wrong with her.

134
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,576
The way she talked
about him, it wasn't

135
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:27,112
author-subject, you know?
He's a genius, all that crap.

136
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,680
I think there's more.

137
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:31,583
Meanwhile,
back at the evidence...

138
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:34,119
I went full-out, Wes--
I gave her the smile,

139
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,822
the eye contact,
the empathetic nods...

140
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:38,590
Far be it for me to discredit
the forensic value

141
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:39,991
of the empathetic nod.

142
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,226
I'm telling you, if there
was anything in there,

143
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,662
they would have found
the cash 10 years ago.

144
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,130
Oh, yeah? So, you're saying
your not smarter

145
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,132
than any other cop
that's worked this case?

146
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,836
I'm smarter than at least one.

147
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,541
Okay, robber here, caught here.

148
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,844
Which means Cooper
couldn't have gone

149
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:02,013
outside this area
to hide his money.

150
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,850
You're already wrong.

151
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:07,752
The money had to be
at least 50 pounds. Thank you.

152
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:11,223
A man can't run much farther
than that with that much weight.

153
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:14,926
Five million dollars
weighs 110 pounds exactly.

154
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,928
Just... let me finish.
How do you...

155
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,797
So he couldn't have gone
any further that that.

156
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,699
But after he dumped it,
he still had to

157
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,868
make it to
where he was caught.

158
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,207
And that's a row
of office buildings.

159
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:32,077
What'd he do, hide it in
a plant for ten years?

160
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,045
Yeah, I don't know.
But I just

161
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,081
turned your big-ass circle
into one square block.

162
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,782
Here's the money.

163
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,150
Yeah, if it's anywhere.

164
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,724
That's a lot of office buildings.
Yeah, but what isn't there?

165
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:50,862
The Spencer building, that big
hideous glass building.

166
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,898
Oh, right, okay.

167
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,167
It says here, construction
started in November of '01.

168
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:59,204
Okay, that's three months
before the robbery. Mm-hm.

169
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:03,742
So if Cooper's back in town,
that's where he's going.

170
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:06,177
Glad I solved it.
No wait-wait-wait-wait-wait...

171
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,812
You gave up like
three minutes ago.

172
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,815
And then I solved it. Yeah.

173
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,918
I'm a wizard.

174
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,086
I am videotaping
our next conversation.

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,869
Keep it out front.
We're LAPD.

176
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,071
You just going to go
knocking on walls?

177
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,306
Well, we'll take
a look downstairs,

178
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:36,007
find out if anyone's
seen him.

179
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,709
Yeah, it's a long shot.

180
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,578
No, it's the only
shot we got.

181
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,251
How you doing today?

182
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,886
I'd rather be outside.

183
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:49,321
But other than that,
I'm all right.

184
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:52,257
Mm! I hear that.

185
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,892
Oh, the empathetic
head nod.

186
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,694
Good God.

187
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,295
We're detectives
with the LAPD

188
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:58,863
and we'd like
to see your basement.

189
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:00,131
Yeah, knock yourself out.

190
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,133
The other detective,
he's already down there.

191
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,238
I can't believe
I was right.

192
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,041
Say it again,
I'm going to shoot you.

193
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,943
If I were dead, you'd finally
be a better cop than me.

194
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,655
You all right?!

195
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,157
Cooper?!

196
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,361
Go! Go!

197
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:34,966
- Fire alarm...
- LAPD! Move! Move!

198
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:35,934
LAPD!

199
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,307
Where is it?!
Where is it?!

200
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,719
Nice work, gentlemen.
Did they valet your car?

201
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,355
Please tell me they valeted your car.
Okay, a little respect here.

202
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,124
We solved a 10-year-old
case in five minutes.

203
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:01,660
"From the moment
Cooper strode into the room,

204
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:02,427
"you could tell
he was different.

205
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,862
"He had the breezy insouciance

206
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:06,297
of a movie star who
just won his third Oscar."

207
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:06,297
Wow, that is bad writing.

208
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:11,236
W-W-Wait, this is why I got
nothing from her, man.

209
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:13,872
She's in love with him. A woman turning
you down isn't evidence of anything.

210
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,807
But taste.

211
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,045
A guy's in prison for years,

212
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:23,048
this ten walks in and fawns all over...
Thought she was a seven.

213
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,049
It's a prison ten.

214
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,417
It makes sense.

215
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:28,219
She's his only connection
on the outside.

216
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:31,690
And she's clearly crazy for him. Says you.

217
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,992
Hey, Captain, we, uh, wanted to... Shh!

218
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,467
On your case...

219
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:43,835
I found the car.

220
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,837
It was dumped
by a Metro station

221
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,706
about two miles from
where you lost them.

222
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,174
- No sign of Cooper.
- We were close.

223
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:51,309
Almost good work, boys.

224
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,778
Thanks, Cap.
Amazing you got what you did.

225
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,082
We were...
Almost caught him, I know.

226
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,120
Any ideas how we can
catch him for reals?

227
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,456
Nothing...

228
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,192
solid... no.

229
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:10,195
Except for the author--
Lisa Clark.

230
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,966
We, uh, we think there's
a relationship there.

231
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,068
We think he may try to make
contact; try to use her.

232
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,339
It's possible.
Thanks for the support.

233
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:24,442
I said it's possible. No, no,
no, I'm not appreciated.

234
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:27,212
Give me a break. It's your support.
Thank you, so supportive.

235
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:30,048
- Nah, well, I try...
- You were right once.

236
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,250
All right, so you got it.

237
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,519
We'll set up surveillance
and split the shifts

238
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,054
with Kate and Amy.

239
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:39,124
Captain, we feel good about
this, don't we, partner?

240
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:41,359
Yeah.
All right, fellas, look,

241
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,294
this is a textbook example

242
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,530
of a challenging task.

243
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,532
What do you say?

244
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:50,969
We close our eyes,
and we visualize

245
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,904
a positive outcome together.

246
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,973
Come on.

247
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:20,832
Hey, sweetheart.

248
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:23,101
How's your day going?

249
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:26,271
Good, good.

250
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:28,439
Hey, listen,
I been thinking, uh,

251
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,876
after I was meditating,
and I had an epiphany.

252
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:38,449
How about you and I
have a date night?

253
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,921
It's our best executive unit.

254
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,957
Everything is top of the line.

255
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,326
Oh, there is one thing:

256
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,195
The sauna's being retiled.

257
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:52,330
Hm.

258
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,899
- So?
- It's just, um...

259
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:57,335
Male tenants living together
tend to enjoy the sauna.

260
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,871
Hm.

261
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,873
Um...

262
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,609
We're not...
Sauna people, no.

263
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,878
Girl, he gets a heat rash, oh.

264
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,046
Don't you?

265
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,514
My little sensitive man.

266
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,350
I'll let you boys settle in.

267
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,922
Why are you pretending
we're gay? Will you stop it?

268
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:19,190
It's our cover.

269
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,326
Now, no one knows we're cops.

270
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,063
Great.

271
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,598
All right, the home phone
and the cell phone

272
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,099
are already tapped.

273
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,501
Our tech overheard
her saying she's got

274
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:31,903
a doctor's appointment

275
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,972
this afternoon, so we can
get on in there

276
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,373
and plant a bug then.

277
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,108
Yes, I did get a warrant.

278
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,611
Even though, no, you don't care.

279
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:42,914
All right.

280
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:49,387
So, I've got our friend
at her computer.

281
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,122
And, uh...

282
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,994
Ooh, it's yoga time!

283
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,062
While she's writing?

284
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,230
No, it's her neighbor.

285
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,637
Travis, now what
you're doing is illegal.

286
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,039
Ooh, Ooh...

287
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:12,010
This should be illegal
what she is doing to me-- uh!

288
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:15,079
Man, if I bent like that,
I'd snap in half.

289
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,417
Bird of Paradise pose.

290
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,020
She needs to drop her hip
and point her toes.

291
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:26,658
You can take the joy
out of anything.

292
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,093
Thank you.

293
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:38,069
Man, you cook this well and
still can't get a woman?

294
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:42,006
You know how to
bury a compliment.

295
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:45,076
And I've cooked for you before.
With Alex, but...

296
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,978
I always thought
she did the cooking

297
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,212
and you took all the credit.

298
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,052
Lisa's on the move.

299
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:54,052
Carter, this is Mitchell.

300
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:57,021
Target is leaving her apartment.

301
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:59,590
We'll pick her up when she
clears the building.

302
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,459
All right, copy that.

303
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,095
All right, that should
buy us at least a half an hour.

304
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:06,030
She's leaving early.
I knew I didn't like her.

305
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:09,067
Okay, now listen to me.
You listening? Mm-hm.

306
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,336
This is not a toy;
this is a delicate tool.

307
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:14,539
Do not scrunch, twist,
crinkle, bend...

308
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,341
I've planted a bug before.

309
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:19,010
Can you at least
wash your hands first?

310
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,311
Yeah, all right.
That's delicate.

311
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,047
Yeah... all right.

312
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,451
I'll be back.

313
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:29,520
Just, uh...

314
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,055
Just leave
that anywhere, Travis.

315
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,023
No, I'll get it later.

316
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:50,274
Okay... now we're going
to plant this bug,

317
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,777
and we're going to
get out of there...

318
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:55,213
Right, Travis?

319
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,149
Travis?

320
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,786
Travis, can you hear me?

321
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:06,758
Yeah.

322
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,627
Put in your earpiece!

323
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,599
Okay, can you hear me?

324
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,734
Yeah, I can hear you.
Testing...

325
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:20,171
Please don't say testing, one, two...
One, two, three...

326
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,073
Where you going?

327
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:23,641
Why are you going
into the kitchen?

328
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,779
See if she's got
some of these cookies.

329
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:29,647
Travis, you can't go in for
cookies right now.

330
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,382
We're on a stakeout.
You're planting a bug.

331
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,484
We're on a schedule.
You got to do this thing.

332
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,488
Okay...

333
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,323
When you're finished
with your cookies,

334
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,526
remember to put this thing
someplace high up.

335
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:44,262
Preferably not near
a wire in the wall.

336
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,168
Bingo.

337
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,103
Letters from Cooper.

338
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,208
All right.
Anything interesting?

339
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,846
Well, they were all
read by the prison,

340
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:03,681
so there wouldn't be.

341
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,716
But the fact that she kept them
proves my point.

342
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:08,252
Mitchell. Mitchell.
You there?

343
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,755
Target just turned around and is heading home.
All right, copy that.

344
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,091
Hey, Travis, you got to
get out of there.

345
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,559
She's on her way back
to the apartment.

346
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,260
You got to hurry hurry, okay?

347
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:20,264
Come on, get it,
get it, get it going.

348
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,103
You got it up there?

349
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,871
Travis?

350
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:29,140
Travis, I'm not getting anything
out of your microphone.

351
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:29,140
You want to check your mic?

352
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,147
Check your mic!
I don't know what you're saying!

353
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:37,715
Tra... something's wrong
with your microphone.

354
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,150
Check your mic.

355
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,284
What is in that?!

356
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,286
Why are you holding that?!

357
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,255
Put it down!
Get out of the apartment.

358
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,357
I don't know why you're
shaking the box around.

359
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,359
- What does that mean?
- I can't...

360
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,396
I heard that. Are you...?

361
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:53,798
Are you moving
your lips right now?

362
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,266
You're not saying anything?

363
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,235
Good work, Detective.
Good work.

364
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,748
Okay, all right,
where's the remote?

365
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,821
You know, this thing
goes in a cradle.

366
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,323
Can I just tell you,
you've outdone yourself.

367
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,192
I mean, you should have
your own show,

368
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:22,460
<i>The Anal Chef.</i>

369
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,231
Don't miss.

370
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,671
Are you expecting anyone?

371
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,439
Kate and Amy aren't supposed
to be here till 10:00.

372
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,581
Mr. T!

373
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:47,385
Let's get this party started.

374
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:48,519
Captain.

375
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,289
Hey, Wes, my man.

376
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,358
Ah, you guys ate already.

377
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,626
Eh, that's all right.

378
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:58,296
I bet I can finish this
chicken all on my own.

379
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:01,232
Is there really a winner
in a bet like that, Cap?

380
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:02,400
Any progress?

381
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:03,868
Not really, no.

382
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,603
Uh, kind of a dead end.

383
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:06,871
Drink up, me hearties.

384
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,375
Probably shouldn't on duty.

385
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,777
Near beer.

386
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,479
Come on, what kind of
a captain do you think I am?

387
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,281
Everything okay at home, sir?

388
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:18,716
You kiddin' me?
Couldn't be better.

389
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,451
This therapy saved our lives.

390
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,320
I don't have to tell
you guys that.

391
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:25,323
No, no, you don't, uh,
'cause you forced us to go.

392
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:28,359
- "Forced" is a strong word.
- It is a strong word.

393
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,861
It is.
It's what happened, though.

394
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:34,632
When is he going to leave?
I don't think he ever is.

395
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,634
If you're wrong
about this and Cooper

396
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:38,002
never tries to contact Lisa,

397
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:38,002
we're stuck
with him, forever.

398
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:41,372
No, no, no, don't even say that.
Don't even put

399
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:43,341
that thought out there
in the universe.

400
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,009
Hey, boys, we're going
to need some more beer.

401
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:47,678
I'll go!
No, I'll go get that for ya.

402
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,747
Don't you dare go get that.... What,
the hell you will, shoot for it.

403
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,984
No!

404
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,926
Wes, my man.

405
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,894
Park it.

406
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,933
So, you were telling me
about your parents.

407
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,269
Was I?

408
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:11,269
Kind of doubt it.

409
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:14,739
Probably wouldn't surprise
you to find out

410
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,674
that my old man was
a heavy drinker, huh?

411
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:19,610
I mean, I told him
I loved him once.

412
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,379
I actually said the words,

413
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:26,951
"I love you," to which he
responded, "I love food, too."

414
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,586
He never let me in.

415
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:31,355
Never once.

416
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:33,624
- Hey, Cap, was that a call?
- Pizza's on his way up, ma'am.

417
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,660
Nah, it's just the doorman
letting the pizza guy up.

418
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:37,428
Did she call for a pizza?

419
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,430
Travis, you better get in there.

420
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:40,931
Guy just delivered pizza.

421
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:43,034
<i>It could be Cooper.</i>

422
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,676
Freeze.

423
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:55,513
Don't move. Don't move.

424
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,619
I've got like
three bucks.

425
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:03,888
Take it.

426
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,057
All right, just relax.

427
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,625
I'm a cop.

428
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:09,927
Yeah, 'cause police
never shoot anyone.

429
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:25,743
Okay.

430
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:27,745
Who put the note
in the box?

431
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:30,715
Some guy was waiting for me
outside the shop.

432
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:33,451
He gave me 100 bucks to
put it in here. Whoa.

433
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:35,553
You told me you only had
three dollars, you little liar.

434
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:37,588
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Now, here's
what you're going to do.

435
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,490
You're going to take this box,
you're going to

436
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:40,925
deliver it
to the person who ordered it,

437
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,660
and you're not going to tell her
anything about us.

438
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:44,428
You understand?

439
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,464
Put the microphone pen
on him so he doesn't talk.

440
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:47,498
Microphone pen?
Yeah.

441
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,433
We only have
one microphone pen.

442
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:50,935
You sure you want to waste it?
They're expensive.

443
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:53,371
Put it on him. He's a liar.
Hey, all right. Relax.

444
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,677
Remember.

445
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,981
We're listening.

446
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,458
Cooper sent a note.

447
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,060
What'd it say?

448
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,795
It said, "Meet me
in MacArthur Park

449
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:19,697
at 6:00 p.m.
tomorrow."

450
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,098
Yep.

451
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,502
Travis, you were right--
she's in on it.

452
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:26,103
Was I?

453
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:27,938
I guess I was.

454
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,841
Listen, I'm not going to gloat
about it, guys, all right?

455
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,009
Thank you.

456
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:35,079
So I'll just simply
say, uh, you know...

457
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,615
Touchdown!

458
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,062
Are you done?

459
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,098
Wait.

460
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,100
I'm done now.

461
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,140
Uh, before we get started,

462
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:06,510
I did want to check in
on a couple of things.

463
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:08,712
Clyde, how is our new
strategy going?

464
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:10,514
It's not bad.

465
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:11,749
Uh, every time I get a,
uh, frustrated thought,

466
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:13,551
I count to ten
before I say it.

467
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,521
Oh, no, no, no, we're still
having the same fights.

468
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:19,590
They're just lasting longer now.

469
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:21,492
Clyde, would you say
that was fair?

470
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,096
Oh. He's counting.

471
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:28,199
Still a little work to do.

472
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:29,967
I, uh...
I've got something.

473
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:34,638
Wes and I
have moved in together.

474
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,574
Hey! Congrats.

475
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:38,008
Well, we're working on
a stakeout together.

476
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,510
Not really
living together.

477
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:40,778
Either way,

478
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,513
I see it as an opportunity
to work

479
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:43,948
on some of the roadblocks
the two of you have.

480
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,483
- How is it going?
- It's been...

481
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:46,984
it's been great.
It's been great.

482
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,253
Let's... you know what,
let's start with his cooking.

483
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:51,222
Ladies, don't let Wes
cook for your husbands,

484
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:53,491
or you'll lose them.

485
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:54,792
And, I mean, I'm...
I'm that guy

486
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:56,527
who's always lived alone,

487
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,862
but there's something great
about being able

488
00:24:57,864 --> 00:25:00,030
to flip on the game
and having someone there

489
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,766
to argue about it with.

490
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:04,268
You done?
Yeah.

491
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,870
I don't want,
uh, anyone in the room

492
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:07,137
to think I'm
exaggerating here

493
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:10,207
when I say that Travis...

494
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:13,878
Travis here is, uh,
the worst roommate

495
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,280
anyone has ever had.

496
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:17,848
He never
offered to help

497
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,650
with the cooking
or the shopping.

498
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:21,852
I guess he figures there's
some magical kitchen elf

499
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,187
that just makes food appear.

500
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,788
That's not...

501
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,690
When the meal is done,

502
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,859
he just, uh, drops the plate
wherever he's standing.

503
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,695
I guess he wants me
to clean that up.

504
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,797
The only time he's seen
the inside of the kitchen

505
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:36,901
is, uh, when he hid in
there when we had a guest.

506
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:38,202
Okay, you hid
in there, too, man.

507
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,637
I practically live in there!

508
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:41,572
Glasses sweating

509
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:42,740
all over every tabletop.

510
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:45,042
Used tissues
littering the room.

511
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,777
He is like
this selfish,

512
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:51,081
destructive... monster

513
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:54,618
just leaving a trail
of carnage in his wake.

514
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,253
And the worst
part about it is,

515
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,289
I've seen his apartment,
and it's spotless.

516
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:00,758
He knows how to clean--
or maybe he makes

517
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,727
the parade of women he has
over there clean up for him.

518
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,898
Okay.

519
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,733
Well, I think it's fair to say

520
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:12,002
that you both
had different experiences.

521
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:15,272
And you've been
silently harboring all of this,

522
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:17,107
just waiting

523
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,276
to vomit it all
out in therapy.

524
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:20,945
No wonder you and Alex
didn't work out.

525
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:23,147
Nobody has any idea
what you're thinking!

526
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,189
Should I start talking
about how it went

527
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:34,592
putting on my listening
ears this week?

528
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,932
Hey, guys.

529
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,200
Totally quiet.

530
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:44,668
We'll set up

531
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,170
in the park about 5:30.

532
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:48,372
FBI is set up in the hotel
across the street.

533
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:49,840
They've got agents
as homeless guys.

534
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:51,075
Whole nine yards.

535
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:52,610
Good.
Fine.

536
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,846
Everything all right
with you two?

537
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:57,615
Good.
Fine.

538
00:26:57,617 --> 00:27:00,117
Okay.

539
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,320
Have fun locked up
here together all day.

540
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,357
I'll be in the kitchen.

541
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,926
Let me know if you need
any help finding it.

542
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,628
With the Marcelini team

543
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,062
taking a nice lead as a group,

544
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:15,199
two-three coming off
a downward trend there.

545
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,137
They had a great
climbing day yesterday.

546
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,106
Really worked as a team
really well

547
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:24,174
and got Marcelini
right in front.

548
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:25,943
If you're waiting
for me to clean up,

549
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:27,711
you can keep waiting.

550
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:29,279
That's great.

551
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:32,216
I love it like this.

552
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:33,350
...that long, uphill stretch.

553
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:35,019
What'd you do to the TV?

554
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:37,388
Did you do something
to the remote?

555
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,056
Hmm?

556
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:40,824
Oh, you took
the batteries out.

557
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,359
Okay.

558
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:45,062
That's fine.

559
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:47,297
Um, I like bike...

560
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,733
the Tour de Whatever.

561
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:51,301
You hate it.

562
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:54,304
Which makes me love it more.

563
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,175
Don't you touch it.

564
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,443
Hey, Ice King, not everybody

565
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:01,712
wants to see their breath
indoors.

566
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:03,313
It's a perfect 72 degrees
in here right now.

567
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:04,748
Not anymore.

568
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,983
Travis, if you're cold,

569
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:07,751
you can put
another layer on.

570
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:09,687
If I'm hot,
I got to suffer.

571
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:11,455
You what?

572
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:14,191
I suffer.

573
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,859
We can do it all day.

574
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,394
I'll do it
all day, man.

575
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:20,164
Ow.

576
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,138
What is that?

577
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,207
Chicken parm.

578
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,915
Isn't that, uh...
isn't that your favorite?

579
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,420
I suppose you
didn't make me any.

580
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,255
Good work, Detective.

581
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:50,494
She's going.

582
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:52,496
Early again.

583
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,866
You must love her.

584
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,803
Good God.

585
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:02,005
Needs salt.

586
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,510
FBI in position.

587
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,181
LAPD in position.

588
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:19,523
Amy, you got eyes on her?

589
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:21,792
We got her.

590
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,297
Okay.

591
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,833
So, she was a little squirrelly
on the ride over here.

592
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:31,168
Something might be off.
Uh-huh.

593
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,170
We definitely
shouldn't move in

594
00:29:33,172 --> 00:29:34,972
till we know it's, uh,
Cooper, all right?

595
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:37,040
Mm-hmm.

596
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,011
Good talk.

597
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:43,480
You both really
blend in here nicely.

598
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,316
Hey, I got a jogger.

599
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,092
All agents, this is Valtini.

600
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:56,360
Get ready
to move in on my...

601
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:57,795
Can we just make sure?

602
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:59,830
Is it him? Is it Cooper?

603
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,166
I can't get a clear view.

604
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,872
I see him.

605
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:10,941
It's not him.
Repeat, not Cooper.

606
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:13,043
Pick him up.
Make sure.

607
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:14,545
She's heading back to her car.

608
00:30:14,547 --> 00:30:16,146
We'll stay with her.

609
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:20,918
Thanks for wasting
our time.

610
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,355
You see what's
going on here?

611
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:27,124
She's playing us, man.

612
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:29,593
She's testing to see if
she's being followed.

613
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,901
What happened in here?

614
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:41,004
Do you slobs expect us
to clean up after you?

615
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,607
I'm teaching Travis a lesson.

616
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:45,442
I'm driving Wes crazy

617
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:48,045
while he's trying
to teach Travis a lesson.

618
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:50,047
It's like a million degrees
in here.

619
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,582
Seriously?

620
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:53,283
Hey. You weren't here.

621
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:55,052
You don't know what he's like.

622
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:57,487
So, what was all that
in the park?

623
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,958
I think it was a test.

624
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,860
We know this
Cooper's careful.

625
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,628
He wanted to make sure
Lisa wasn't being followed,

626
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,496
so he set this whole thing up.

627
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,102
- Did someone buzz up?
- No, no calls.

628
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,910
It's him.
Cooper's in the apartment.

629
00:31:25,618 --> 00:31:27,918
What just happened?

630
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,189
She shot him.

631
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,227
Self-defense?

632
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,462
You murdered him
in cold blood.

633
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:39,529
I was watching.

634
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,465
You two warned me.

635
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:42,566
This was a dangerous felon.

636
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,334
Now, I keep a registered gun,

637
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:45,602
and when he showed up

638
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,004
and lunged at me,
I defended myself.

639
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:48,939
He opened his
arms to hug you.

640
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:50,407
And he looked
confused,

641
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,242
and you shot him.

642
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,477
Maybe that's
what it looked like,

643
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,412
but it's not what happened.

644
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,447
What about the
note in the pizza

645
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,182
and the meet in the park?

646
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:00,617
I'm a crime writer.

647
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:02,452
You wouldn't believe
the kooky ways

648
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:03,987
people try to get
in contact with me.

649
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:05,289
You saved the note.

650
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,491
Well, I save
all the letters I get.

651
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:10,260
You never know
what will come in handy.

652
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,561
Here's what I think.

653
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:14,431
I think you two fell in love.

654
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,934
He breaks out-- hell, maybe
you help him break out.

655
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:18,502
Maybe you planted
that gun.

656
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:21,505
And when he busts out and gets
the money and he comes to you

657
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:23,206
and says "Let's run away
together," you think,

658
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,242
"What kind of life
is living on the run?

659
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:30,514
If I shoot him,
I get all the money."

660
00:32:30,516 --> 00:32:32,950
I know how this all must look,

661
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:37,487
but I'm as surprised as you are
that he showed up.

662
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,523
Sorry.

663
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:43,360
You have any
questions, partner?

664
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,132
No, I'm good.

665
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,639
Hey, I saw her murder him.

666
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,274
If I tried
to indict her,

667
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:59,443
I'd get laughed out
of the grand jury.

668
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:01,078
You have a cop
as an eyewitness!

669
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,580
I've got an escaped
con carrying a gun

670
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:05,148
breaking into
her apartment.

671
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,616
Okay, what about the money?

672
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:07,718
That's the FBI's problem.

673
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,419
Missing money's
still missing money.

674
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,288
Captain, I'm telling you,
there is more to this

675
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,689
You got to believe me.

676
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,458
I'm sorry, guys.

677
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,625
You got Cooper.

678
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:18,462
And your instincts
were right.

679
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,107
Travis.

680
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,309
Travis.

681
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:35,178
What?
What are we gonna do?

682
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,415
We?
You could try having my back.

683
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,083
I just witnessed a murder.

684
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:42,152
You're not gonna get
a conviction,

685
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:43,687
and the DA just said
he doesn't care.

686
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:46,056
You know what, man?

687
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:48,525
You haven't had
my back this entire case.

688
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:49,793
If you have a theory,

689
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:52,162
I'd run it into the ground
with you.

690
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:55,198
I might argue with you,
yeah, but I'd have your back.

691
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,702
As a your partner,
you gotta let this thing go.

692
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,504
All we have to do is stay on her

693
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:02,172
and see if she's goes
for the cash.

694
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:04,708
You better hurry,
because she just left.

695
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,281
Where you going?

696
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:13,717
To stake out the pizza place.
Travis...

697
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,685
I don't care what she says,
Wes, all right?

698
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:18,088
I know Cooper sent that note.
And if I were him,

699
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:21,291
and I wanted to hide a message
in a pizza box, I would order it

700
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,126
from the nearest place
to where I'm hiding.

701
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:26,096
I'm betting anything the money
is still around there somewhere.

702
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:28,532
It's just a "feeling," but I'm
pretty sure I'm right about it.

703
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:30,300
All right, let's go.
No, no.

704
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:32,369
Do not do me
any favors.

705
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,851
How we doing
over here, Mike?

706
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:49,619
Any word
from your wife yet?

707
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,621
She'll be here. Traffic.
A few minutes, huh?

708
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:53,290
It's been over an hour,

709
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:55,459
and we're getting
pretty backed up.

710
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:57,761
Is there any chance I can
get you to wait at the bar?

711
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:00,630
I'll get you another order
of gnocchi on the house.

712
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:02,699
Look, just give her
a few more minutes, huh?

713
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:04,734
Just, just hold on. Oop!

714
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:08,572
Ah, here she is. Hey!

715
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:12,542
Yeah, I figured
traffic. What?

716
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:13,777
Sure.

717
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:22,786
Hey, look, I got a bottle
of wine chilling here.

718
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,458
Oh.

719
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,228
I'll see you
when you get home.

720
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,598
She, uh...

721
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,466
Caught in traffic.

722
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:39,803
Yeah.

723
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:42,339
Look, I'll take that
gnocchi to go, huh?

724
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:43,740
Of course.

725
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,951
Is this a bad time?

726
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:31,688
That, that's not gonna end well.

727
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,190
Hands up.

728
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:35,192
You know the drill.

729
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:39,696
Hands up. You know the drill.

730
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:53,410
One-hand cuffing, huh?
You police?

731
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:55,245
Prison guard.

732
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,814
I see.

733
00:36:57,816 --> 00:37:00,450
Oh, I see, okay.

734
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:01,918
The author comes to prison

735
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,820
to interview the inmate
for her new book.

736
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:06,756
You get to know
the prison guard

737
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:08,525
who's there for all
the interviews.

738
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:10,827
The prisoner has a bunch of
money hidden somewhere,

739
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:12,362
and you two get to thinking,

740
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:14,497
"Hmm, maybe we could get
our hands on it."

741
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:17,667
Congrats.
You almost solved the crime.

742
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:20,237
I've been getting a lot
of that lately.

743
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,272
Dude, she used you
to help Cooper escape.

744
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:25,408
She didn't use me.
It was my idea.

745
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,777
Oh, she let you think that,
too, huh?

746
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:31,381
Put him in the car.
We can't shoot him here.

747
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:32,749
Let's go.

748
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:42,525
All right, let me see
those hands.

749
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:44,494
Get 'em up!

750
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,406
Get her! Get her!

751
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:54,097
Hey, guys, we found your money.
It's right here.

752
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,432
Yeah, no need
to thank us.

753
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:58,368
We're happy
to help out.

754
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,903
I hate the FBI.

755
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:03,506
Look, uh,
you were right.

756
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:06,042
You would have had
my back.

757
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:08,912
I'm just happy
that I was right.

758
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,580
About everything.

759
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:12,682
Well, let's not forget
about who got the money,

760
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,551
who saved your ass.
Yeah, you cut it

761
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:16,619
a little close though, didn't ya?
Well, I saw her

762
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:17,854
pull that gun on you,
I figured I'd give you

763
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,456
a little distraction.
Worked out nicely.

764
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:20,590
Yeah, but if you'd been
there a few minutes earlier,

765
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:22,559
I might not have had
a gun on me at all.

766
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:24,961
Well, my partner taught me that being
late's as good as being early.

767
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,596
Oh, that is absolutely not
what I said.

768
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:28,465
That's not what you said?
That's not what I said.

769
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:30,567
I thought... What did you say?
No, what I said was that...

770
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:31,835
See? You don't even know
what you said.

771
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:40,977
Hey, I have something
to say to you.

772
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:42,812
Oh-oh.

773
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:46,916
You are a horrible
roommate.

774
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:51,488
and a terrible cook, but

775
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:54,791
you really pushed
this case along

776
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:56,993
and you got
good instincts.

777
00:39:56,995 --> 00:40:00,630
I'm gonna do what I can to
support that in the future.

778
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:02,799
No, you're not.

779
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,041
Hey...

780
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:15,945
you know how you said

781
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:18,882
that my place is spotless
in therapy?

782
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:22,452
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry
about that. I was...

783
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:23,820
Wes...

784
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,959
my home is permanent.

785
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:32,095
It's mine, man.

786
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,764
I know it can never
be taken away from me,

787
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,099
so I take care of it.

788
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:41,604
Growing up in foster homes...

789
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,207
I always knew it was
just a temporary stop

790
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:46,743
on my way to the next one.

791
00:40:46,745 --> 00:40:49,679
And I guess I figured
that if I cared about it...

792
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:55,685
I'd get real messed up
when I had to leave.

793
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:59,222
Yeah, I get that.

794
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,560
All right.

795
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,067
Crap, you know what?
I forgot my keys.

796
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:12,602
I'll see you
down there, okay?

797
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:14,938
All right, cool.
