1
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:36,317
It all started 27 years ago.

2
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:38,084
That's an orphanage.

3
00:00:38,157 --> 00:00:41,820
That's me in the basket.
I guess somebody didn't want me.

4
00:00:41,894 --> 00:00:44,385
I hear they did want the basket back, though.

5
00:00:44,464 --> 00:00:46,432
But it was fine in the orphanage.

6
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:48,626
That's me in the third row.

7
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:50,430
I wasn't very popular.

8
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:53,097
Of course, everybody wanted to be adopted.

9
00:00:53,172 --> 00:00:55,265
Luckily, lots of families came.

10
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:58,139
And everybody got to go live with a family.

11
00:00:58,211 --> 00:01:00,111
Oh, except me.

12
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:02,579
But I tried not to give up hope.

13
00:01:02,648 --> 00:01:04,616
Then, one day,

14
00:01:04,684 --> 00:01:07,881
something magical happened, just like out of a fairy tale.

15
00:01:07,954 --> 00:01:11,719
Do you remember the one where the wolf huffed and
puffed and blew the piggies' house down?

16
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:14,783
And he was wearing a glass slipper,
I think, and he had a pumpkin?

17
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:16,726
Plus there was that other thing?

18
00:01:16,796 --> 00:01:19,128
Well, the same thing happened to me,

19
00:01:19,198 --> 00:01:21,564
only vastly different.

20
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:23,067
I changed.

21
00:01:23,136 --> 00:01:26,628
And the next thing you know, people seemed to like me for once.

22
00:01:26,706 --> 00:01:30,767
And then pictures were taken, and suddenly
I found the family I always wanted.

23
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:34,743
Oh, I forgot to tell you, my name is Shelley.

24
00:01:34,814 --> 00:01:37,009
Now I live in the Playboy Mansion.

25
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:41,247
And this is where I want to live happily ever after.

26
00:01:57,637 --> 00:02:01,937
- Throw the ball to me, Kim.
- Oh, nice catch. Awesome throw.

27
00:02:03,543 --> 00:02:05,636
- Hey, Lauren.
- Hi, Shelley!

28
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:08,269
Hi, Hef! Hi, girls!

29
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:10,542
Hi, Shelley. Looking good.

30
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:14,717
- Marvin!
- Oh, hey, Shelley.

31
00:02:14,787 --> 00:02:16,152
Thank you.

32
00:02:16,222 --> 00:02:19,851
You guys have to try one of these.
Marvin makes the best margaritas.

33
00:02:19,926 --> 00:02:23,589
That's 'cause they're mangoritas.
I invented them myself.

34
00:02:23,663 --> 00:02:25,995
I added my own little Marvin twist to them.

35
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:29,364
Well, you're the best twister I know.

36
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:31,460
No, Shelley, you're the best twister.

37
00:02:31,537 --> 00:02:33,664
- Shelley.
- Hi!

38
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:36,970
Why are you keeping the rich, good-looking,
famous guys all to yourself?

39
00:02:37,043 --> 00:02:39,204
- You should introduce me.
- Oh, of course.

40
00:02:39,278 --> 00:02:42,304
Guys, this is Cassandra.
She's only been here for a few months,

41
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:44,815
but everybody loves her, because she's super-beautiful

42
00:02:44,884 --> 00:02:48,251
and she never throws up on anybody when she's drunk.

43
00:02:49,655 --> 00:02:52,590
So, Shelley, are you a centerfold?

44
00:02:54,193 --> 00:02:55,854
She wishes.

45
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:59,489
Yeah, I do. So keep all your fingers crossed.

46
00:02:59,565 --> 00:03:02,830
Hopefully Hef'll give me the good news
this weekend at my birthday party.

47
00:03:02,902 --> 00:03:05,962
I've got my "turn ons" all ready and everything.

48
00:03:06,038 --> 00:03:10,668
Being a centerfold is the highest,
most prestigious honor there is.

49
00:03:11,344 --> 00:03:14,745
It says, "I'm naked in the middle of a magazine.

50
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:17,512
"Unfold me."

51
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:20,347
I gotta tell you, it seems you've got a pretty good life here.

52
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:22,444
Oh, it's paradise.

53
00:03:22,522 --> 00:03:25,685
We are just one big family. I am so happy.

54
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:29,122
Why would I wanna live anywhere else?

55
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:18,110
I love this one. Don't you guys?

56
00:04:18,177 --> 00:04:21,977
We'll put this on the Mansion tab and have
it all sent over this afternoon.

57
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:25,211
Aren't we just the luckiest girls in the whole world?

58
00:04:25,284 --> 00:04:27,047
Yes, you are.

59
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,254
Your birthday party on Friday's gonna be so much fun!

60
00:04:30,323 --> 00:04:31,312
Shelley!

61
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,621
Oh, my God.
I bet you're gonna get Miss November.

62
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:44,492
Good morning, Shelley.

63
00:05:44,563 --> 00:05:46,690
Rise and shine, sweetheart.

64
00:05:49,101 --> 00:05:51,069
Good morning, Marvin.

65
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:55,437
Good morning, Pooter.
You're looking dapper.

66
00:05:57,009 --> 00:05:59,500
Your blueberry French toast is ready.

67
00:05:59,578 --> 00:06:00,909
Ooh-la-la.

68
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,208
That's French, right?

69
00:06:02,281 --> 00:06:04,044
Yeah, but more important than the food,

70
00:06:04,116 --> 00:06:06,448
I actually added something to your orange juice.

71
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:09,852
Oh, Marvin, thank you so much for telling me.

72
00:06:09,922 --> 00:06:12,152
Usually I don't find out until much later.

73
00:06:12,224 --> 00:06:15,716
Oh, no. To add zest to the drink,
first I put in some vanilla extract,

74
00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:19,822
then, of course, some egg yolks, and then,
I have a secret ingredient.

75
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:22,459
All right, you twisted my arm, it's chili powder.

76
00:06:22,535 --> 00:06:27,529
Yeah. It just explodes your taste buds,
so the drink just envelops your mouth.

77
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,234
Oh, I love having my mouth enveloped.

78
00:06:30,843 --> 00:06:32,276
What's that?

79
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,414
Is this from Hef? Is this my birthday gift?

80
00:06:36,482 --> 00:06:39,451
Oh, Pooter, is it finally happening?
Am I Miss November?

81
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:42,009
That's what I wished for when I blew out my candle.

82
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:44,613
Oh, my gosh, I just told you my wish.
Now it won't come true.

83
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,488
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to tell, it just came out.

84
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,619
My teeth couldn't stop it.

85
00:06:50,162 --> 00:06:52,892
I take it all back, I take it all back.

86
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:55,693
Okay, I'm ready.

87
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,631
"Dear Shelley..." Oh, my gosh, that's me.

88
00:07:01,707 --> 00:07:03,436
Wait, there's more.

89
00:07:04,176 --> 00:07:07,168
"Please move out of the Mansion immediately."

90
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:13,316
Move out?

91
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,124
"You have two hours to collect your
belongings and leave the premises.

92
00:07:23,496 --> 00:07:25,987
All my love, Hef."

93
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,997
Hef's kicking me out?

94
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,995
Why would he do that?

95
00:07:33,072 --> 00:07:35,734
This is my home. This is my family.

96
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:41,143
I hate to say this, Shelley, but maybe it's because of your age.

97
00:07:41,213 --> 00:07:43,374
But I'm 27.

98
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:46,577
Yeah, but that's 59 in Bunny years.

99
00:07:47,453 --> 00:07:52,049
But I just turned 27 last night.

100
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:54,786
It's almost like I'm still 26.

101
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,020
Or 58.

102
00:07:56,762 --> 00:08:00,027
I've gotta talk to Hef, maybe he'll let me stay.

103
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:01,893
Hef!

104
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:03,562
Hef!

105
00:08:04,136 --> 00:08:05,194
Hef!

106
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:06,929
Hef!

107
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,698
Where is he?

108
00:08:10,776 --> 00:08:15,213
He left for Vegas, Shelley.
I don't think he's that good with goodbyes.

109
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:19,110
Why is this all happening?

110
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,820
Where's my pink Prius?

111
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:28,424
The Prius actually belongs to the company.
This is the car you came here with.

112
00:08:29,461 --> 00:08:30,758
But...

113
00:08:36,802 --> 00:08:38,326
Come on, Pooter.

114
00:08:38,404 --> 00:08:40,804
We have to go find a new place to live.

115
00:08:40,873 --> 00:08:42,340
Come on, now.

116
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:44,433
Come here, Pooter.

117
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,570
Here, let me help, Shelley. Hey, Pooter.
Shelley's calling you now.

118
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:50,479
Come on, Pooter.
Go with Shelley, buddy. Pooter!

119
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:53,382
That hurts! Go with Shelley, Pooter!

120
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:57,218
Damn it!

121
00:09:03,162 --> 00:09:06,893
Why don't I just keep him here for a little while,
until he calms down?

122
00:09:06,966 --> 00:09:08,490
Okay.

123
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:10,296
Well, don't worry, Pooter.

124
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:13,236
I'm gonna find us a really nice place to live,

125
00:09:13,305 --> 00:09:15,466
and then maybe you'll wanna come live with me.

126
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,940
I'm sure he will.

127
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:19,569
Well, you take care, Shelley.

128
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:32,248
Bye.

129
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:46,241
I know it's an embarrassment to live in a
beat-up car, but don't lose faith, Pooter.

130
00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:50,720
I'm gonna get a great job soon, and find us
a super place to live, with a new family.

131
00:09:51,577 --> 00:09:53,568
I pinkie promise, Pooter.

132
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:06,119
Good evening, ma'am.

133
00:10:06,992 --> 00:10:10,359
You violated Code 753.
That's unlawful spitting.

134
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:12,959
I was just brushing my teeth.

135
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:15,432
You currently residing in this car, ma'am?

136
00:10:15,501 --> 00:10:17,765
I'm gonna have to issue another ticket.

137
00:10:17,836 --> 00:10:21,499
Would you maybe stop giving me tickets
if I told you I was having a really bad week

138
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:26,540
because I used to be a Playboy Bunny, but I got kicked out
of the Mansion because I'm 59 years old?

139
00:10:27,713 --> 00:10:32,446
I'm gonna have to ask you to step out
of the car and take a Breathalyzer.

140
00:10:32,518 --> 00:10:33,610
Okay.

141
00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:39,147
Noises.

142
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:41,954
I'm gonna need you to blow on this.

143
00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:43,187
Really?

144
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,789
I guess.

145
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:54,334
You tried to do what?

146
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:55,668
To a cop?

147
00:10:58,444 --> 00:10:59,877
Stupid!

148
00:10:59,945 --> 00:11:02,038
I was just doing what he said.

149
00:11:02,114 --> 00:11:03,877
He was in a uniform and everything.

150
00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:06,782
Don't worry, sweetie.
First-timers only get one night.

151
00:11:06,852 --> 00:11:09,150
You'll be back on the street selling in no time.

152
00:11:09,221 --> 00:11:12,748
But I'm not a prostitute.
I was just brushing my teeth.

153
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,527
I like your tights.

154
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,696
And, you know, you should really go for a more natural look.

155
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:28,740
All that heavy makeup just hides your beauty.

156
00:11:29,174 --> 00:11:30,573
I'm a dude.

157
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,972
Oh, well, you're good like that.

158
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,281
So, did you hear about the pool party at Jordan's?

159
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:21,986
It was unbelievable.

160
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:23,392
-Oh, last Saturday?
- Yes.

161
00:12:23,462 --> 00:12:26,625
- Oh, my God. He makes the best margaritas.
- Yep. It's because he uses mangos.

162
00:12:26,698 --> 00:12:28,928
- No. Really?
- He read about them somewhere.

163
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:30,059
Yeah, mangoritas.

164
00:12:30,135 --> 00:12:32,000
- Jordan's just so hot.
- I know.

165
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:33,129
So are all his friends.

166
00:12:33,205 --> 00:12:35,730
Yeah, seriously, I've tried to hook up with all of them.

167
00:12:35,808 --> 00:12:38,436
- No, you have not.
- Yes. Yes, I did.

168
00:12:39,578 --> 00:12:41,102
Two of them, I succeeded.

169
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,171
- Really?
- It was amazing.

170
00:12:43,248 --> 00:12:44,681
Who knew?

171
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,809
I was so excited.

172
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,250
Looks like a mini-Playboy Mansion.

173
00:13:10,642 --> 00:13:12,303
- Hi.
- Hi.

174
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,204
Hi.

175
00:13:17,216 --> 00:13:18,774
Can I help you?

176
00:13:19,418 --> 00:13:21,852
Yes. I would like to live here, please.

177
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,822
Oh, I know, right?
But you have to be asked to live here.

178
00:13:25,891 --> 00:13:29,224
- Do you go to this school?
- This is a school?

179
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:31,959
Where are the desks?

180
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:36,529
No. This is a sorority house at a school.

181
00:13:36,602 --> 00:13:42,640
And you do look like an older, sluttier version
of the type of girl we would want.

182
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:46,542
But, I'm sorry, you're not a student.
It was so nice talking to you.

183
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:49,137
- But I really think it's...
- So nice.

184
00:13:52,251 --> 00:13:56,381
And our piano is from Tuscany.
Very high-end.

185
00:13:56,455 --> 00:14:02,200
I believe that every detail of the house should be
a reflection of the girls who live here.

186
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:05,526
Hi. Do you ladies go to school here, too?

187
00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:07,224
Not anymore.

188
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:10,925
We're the housemothers of the sororities on campus.

189
00:14:11,003 --> 00:14:12,470
That's so dope.

190
00:14:12,538 --> 00:14:15,098
Do you live in the houses with the girls?

191
00:14:15,174 --> 00:14:16,471
Yes.

192
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:18,510
That's even dopier.

193
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:20,939
So, what do housemothers do?

194
00:14:21,013 --> 00:14:26,111
We oversee the meal plans, chaperone the social events,
make sure the girls stay out of trouble.

195
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:29,780
Oh, my gosh. That's exactly what I
used to do back at the Mansion.

196
00:14:29,855 --> 00:14:31,254
Can I be one, too?

197
00:14:31,323 --> 00:14:35,419
I'm sorry. This is a sorority, not a brothel.

198
00:14:35,494 --> 00:14:38,327
A brothel?
Oh, I'm not looking to make soup.

199
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:40,262
I'm looking to be like you.

200
00:14:40,332 --> 00:14:42,357
I wanna be a housemother.

201
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:44,632
We have standards.

202
00:14:44,703 --> 00:14:49,106
Standards that you clearly do not meet.
But it was nice to meet you.

203
00:14:49,608 --> 00:14:50,632
But I just want to...

204
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:51,835
- So nice.
- So nice.

205
00:15:01,253 --> 00:15:05,314
Try Zeta. Their last housemother was
hospitalized with hallucinations.

206
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,687
Awesome.

207
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:09,692
Awesome.

208
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:25,703
Hello?

209
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:36,748
Dean Simmons. Please, please.
We are trying so hard. I promise you.

210
00:15:37,322 --> 00:15:39,483
This seems really unfair.
And I'm not gonna attack you.

211
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:42,322
I don't want you to feel attacked by all of us,
so I'm just gonna say "me."

212
00:15:42,394 --> 00:15:45,090
To me, this feels really unfair.

213
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:48,621
Natalie. Look, I feel the same way you do.

214
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,826
But the fact remains,

215
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:53,530
you guys have not met your requirements
for three years running now.

216
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:56,665
And I'm under a lot of pressure from other sororities

217
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:58,936
complaining that we're bending the rules for you.

218
00:15:59,011 --> 00:16:02,378
By "other sororities," do you happen to mean Phi lota Mu?

219
00:16:02,447 --> 00:16:05,610
I really don't think it matters who complained.

220
00:16:05,684 --> 00:16:08,551
Natalie, rules are rules.

221
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,948
Drama queen.

222
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,653
Oh, I'm sorry I scared you.

223
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:20,129
Do you think you could help me out of here, though?

224
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:21,722
What? Yeah.

225
00:16:22,668 --> 00:16:23,692
Thanks.

226
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:25,964
I'm so sorry, I think I broke your Z.

227
00:16:26,038 --> 00:16:29,838
Oh. No, it's okay.
It falls off, like, every time we open the door.

228
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:32,570
Well, at least you still have T and A.

229
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:35,205
T and an A. Who are you?

230
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:42,142
My name is Shelley, and I'm here to be your housemother.

231
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:47,224
Well, it's nice to meet you, Shelley.

232
00:16:48,293 --> 00:16:50,227
But, unfortunately, he...

233
00:16:52,264 --> 00:16:54,061
It's a little too late.

234
00:16:54,132 --> 00:16:59,999
We're about to lose our charter, so if we don't have a house,
we won't really be needing a housemother.

235
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:03,965
Well, why are they gonna take your house away?

236
00:17:05,177 --> 00:17:10,274
Because we get no pledges, and everyone
kind of thinks we're losers.

237
00:17:10,749 --> 00:17:14,776
That's so sad.
Why does everyone else get all the pledges?

238
00:17:14,853 --> 00:17:17,583
Well, they have great parties, and

239
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,820
boys actually like them.

240
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,061
I'm an expert at parties and boys.
I'm a Bunny.

241
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,598
Men write to me from prison, sometimes in their own blood.

242
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,531
I mean, I assume it's theirs, who knows? I don't.

243
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:33,566
I'm sorry, I'm nervous right now, because I really wanna
help you guys, because I know I can do it.

244
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:35,731
Wow, a Bunny?

245
00:17:36,108 --> 00:17:37,973
Like a centerfold?

246
00:17:38,043 --> 00:17:43,106
Oh, bless your heart, no.
Just a couple of small pictorials,

247
00:17:43,181 --> 00:17:47,447
"Girls of the Midwest," "Girls with GEDs,"
"Girls of Charlie Sheen."

248
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,584
But now I'm a homeless person.

249
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,487
God, I'm so sorry.

250
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:55,319
Good luck.

251
00:17:55,394 --> 00:17:58,022
Wait, but I can really help you guys.

252
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:01,966
So if we don't get pledges, we lose our charter?

253
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:05,127
- We need 30.
- Thirty pledges? There's seven of us, dude.

254
00:18:05,203 --> 00:18:07,603
Technically, seven and half now.

255
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:08,798
Hey!

256
00:18:08,874 --> 00:18:12,207
Oh, nothing a little fertilizer can't help.

257
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,912
Not you, Tanya.
I was talking about Harmony.

258
00:18:16,982 --> 00:18:20,076
Actually, 7 and 3l4 as of Tuesday last week.

259
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:22,912
Guys, we're never gonna get that many pledges.

260
00:18:22,988 --> 00:18:26,151
This is just their way of shutting us down.

261
00:18:27,225 --> 00:18:28,692
This is awful.

262
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,785
Hey, Joanne, just FYI,

263
00:18:30,862 --> 00:18:34,025
you've got refrigerator magnets stuck to your brace again.

264
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:35,430
Actually, we need that.
That's our grocery list.

265
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,627
I knew that. I knew that.

266
00:18:37,702 --> 00:18:40,000
- No, you didn't.
- Did so.

267
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:43,269
- Why do we need knee-highs?
- Oh, my God.

268
00:18:44,943 --> 00:18:47,605
Oh, my God. There's boys on our lawn.

269
00:18:50,015 --> 00:18:51,607
Are they lost?

270
00:18:51,683 --> 00:18:52,775
Nice.

271
00:18:53,518 --> 00:18:56,851
The Leaning Panther. I like that. Yoga's hot.

272
00:18:58,256 --> 00:18:59,985
So, are you a Zeta?

273
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,527
Oh, I wish.

274
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:08,424
Yeah, I do, too, because Zeta would be
my new favorite hizzety-hang.

275
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,397
Well, she is not a Zeta,

276
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:15,104
because she's our new hizzety-housemother.

277
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,407
She'll be hizzy-tizzies...

278
00:19:18,477 --> 00:19:20,672
She'll be here all the time.

279
00:19:21,546 --> 00:19:23,241
You're hiring me?

280
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:25,739
Oh, give me some of that.

281
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:28,481
Oh, God bless her.

282
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:31,849
- Why are they acting like that?
- Yes.

283
00:19:32,824 --> 00:19:36,521
Oh, that's boys just being boys.

284
00:19:37,229 --> 00:19:38,787
Thank goodness.

285
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:48,672
Oh, my gosh! I am just so happy that you guys want me here.

286
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,731
You are not gonna be sorry.

287
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:53,209
So this is how we're gonna get pledges?

288
00:19:53,278 --> 00:19:57,476
Hiring an archaically superficial reflection of the male fantasy?

289
00:19:57,549 --> 00:19:59,779
Well, guys like her.

290
00:19:59,885 --> 00:20:04,822
And since guys don't like us, I figured she could help.

291
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:09,918
So, in order to be in a sisterhood, now we have to be popular?

292
00:20:09,995 --> 00:20:14,625
No, no. In order to keep our house, though,
we do have to be popular. Yes.

293
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:17,896
So, I figured Shelley here could teach us how.

294
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:20,995
Okay, look, don't get me wrong. I love guys.

295
00:20:21,106 --> 00:20:23,939
But I lived in a house filled with girls for nine years,

296
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:28,912
and I know that there's nothing better
than just being with your sisters,

297
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,349
sharing, talking all night, painting each other's bodies,

298
00:20:34,152 --> 00:20:37,610
baking penis cookies, playing with monkeys...

299
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,223
- Where'd you live?
- The Playboy Mansion.

300
00:20:47,532 --> 00:20:51,059
No, that doesn't make her a hooker. Sorry.

301
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:58,501
She's shy. She's just...

302
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,544
She's so shy. That's Lilly, also, by the way.

303
00:21:02,614 --> 00:21:03,774
Lilly.

304
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,251
And this here is Harmony.

305
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,617
Harmony.

306
00:21:12,557 --> 00:21:14,718
And Carrie Mae.

307
00:21:14,793 --> 00:21:16,260
Carrie Mae.

308
00:21:16,328 --> 00:21:19,092
And then Joanne, over there.

309
00:21:19,164 --> 00:21:20,495
Joanne.

310
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,258
Wow, you hired the Exorcist. That's great.

311
00:21:25,337 --> 00:21:26,929
What is that?

312
00:21:27,005 --> 00:21:29,473
Is that like a Yoda thing, or what?

313
00:21:30,075 --> 00:21:32,100
It's fun, but, what...

314
00:21:32,177 --> 00:21:36,637
Oh, no, no. It's just this thing I do to remember people's names.

315
00:21:36,715 --> 00:21:37,739
Natalie.

316
00:21:37,816 --> 00:21:41,843
So, thank you guys so much for letting me be your housemother.

317
00:21:42,687 --> 00:21:44,518
No, it's no problem.

318
00:21:46,324 --> 00:21:48,087
Because you just...

319
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,657
This is just gonna be great.

320
00:21:50,729 --> 00:21:51,821
But I have to go take a shower,

321
00:21:51,896 --> 00:21:55,161
because I haven't had one since I slept in
my car and spent the night in jail.

322
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:56,393
Sweet.

323
00:21:58,703 --> 00:22:01,035
- Hi, girls.
- Oh, my God!

324
00:22:01,106 --> 00:22:03,336
Shelley! Hi. Where's your robe?

325
00:22:03,408 --> 00:22:05,069
Oh, I just like to air dry.

326
00:22:05,143 --> 00:22:07,304
Oh, she just likes to air dry.

327
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:09,313
My God, you're so vapid.

328
00:22:09,381 --> 00:22:11,178
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much.

329
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:14,150
You're like the hundredth person who's told me that.

330
00:22:14,219 --> 00:22:18,451
Shell? Just a quick little side note,

331
00:22:18,523 --> 00:22:21,960
I don't think that some of the girls in this house
have even seen their own bodies naked,

332
00:22:21,993 --> 00:22:26,362
so they probably don't really want to see
your perfectly engineered boobs.

333
00:22:26,431 --> 00:22:31,130
Well, I'm just walking around in the body God
and Dr. Borkman gave me.

334
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:37,265
Hey, Shelley, why don't you throw some clothes on?

335
00:22:37,342 --> 00:22:39,674
We've got a lot of work to do.

336
00:22:40,412 --> 00:22:43,540
This year, we are gonna get lots and lots of pledges.

337
00:22:43,615 --> 00:22:44,877
Okay.

338
00:22:44,949 --> 00:22:48,350
Oh, we also need to raise money for our philanthropy.

339
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,320
What's a phila-canopee?

340
00:22:50,989 --> 00:22:54,083
Oh, no. It's a philanthropy.

341
00:22:54,793 --> 00:22:55,885
It's like a charity.

342
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,588
Oh, I love charity.

343
00:22:58,663 --> 00:23:03,299
One time, at the Mansion, I even let Bob Saget
grind on me during a slow dance.

344
00:23:06,438 --> 00:23:11,200
Oh, and here's a list of ideas I came up with for fundraisers,
you know that might make us a little more popular.

345
00:23:11,342 --> 00:23:15,540
So, please take a read.

346
00:23:15,613 --> 00:23:17,843
"Start a beekeeping club."

347
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:20,146
We could have the masks, even.

348
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,552
"Paleolithic bake sale."

349
00:23:24,656 --> 00:23:28,092
Hi! Dinosaurs!
Like, everyone saw Jurassic Park.

350
00:23:29,728 --> 00:23:31,525
"B. Y. O . M."

351
00:23:31,596 --> 00:23:32,824
Bring your own man?

352
00:23:32,897 --> 00:23:35,422
No. Bring your own mouse!

353
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:37,528
Which is better.

354
00:23:37,602 --> 00:23:40,093
Because they're cute and they're little and you can hold them.

355
00:23:40,171 --> 00:23:44,835
And also, another thing that I thought of was,
you could dress them up.

356
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:47,810
It's the whole fun part of it, is you can put them in little outfits.

357
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:50,313
You can make, like, an Abraham Lincoln mouse.

358
00:23:50,381 --> 00:23:52,576
And you could do like Joan of...

359
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,915
Why do everyone's eyes glaze over when I talk about this?

360
00:23:55,987 --> 00:23:57,614
Whoa. No.

361
00:23:57,689 --> 00:24:01,216
No, they weren't glazing.
They were just taking a break.

362
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,020
Natalie, these are super, super-great ideas.

363
00:24:05,096 --> 00:24:07,564
Thank you. I worked really hard.

364
00:24:07,632 --> 00:24:11,033
But we might wanna try something a little more

365
00:24:11,536 --> 00:24:12,594
sexy.

366
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:17,734
Car wash. Come get your car washed.

367
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:21,437
Here we are at the Zeta House Car Wash.

368
00:24:21,513 --> 00:24:24,482
I have a car, and I'm great at washing it.

369
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:28,077
I am so offended right now.

370
00:24:28,686 --> 00:24:30,677
Come on, guys, let's give her a chance.

371
00:24:30,755 --> 00:24:33,121
- Car wash.
- Car wash!

372
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:35,284
You said you needed to raise money.

373
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,627
Well, washing cars is a fun and sexy way
to make all the money that we need.

374
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:44,096
So, car wash!

375
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:46,368
Car wash.

376
00:24:47,372 --> 00:24:49,465
We're having a car wash.

377
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:50,803
Car wash.

378
00:24:51,376 --> 00:24:54,106
No, I can't bend that way.

379
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,079
Hey, watch this, guys.

380
00:25:01,953 --> 00:25:03,113
Hi, guys.

381
00:25:03,188 --> 00:25:04,382
Dude, that's wild.

382
00:25:04,455 --> 00:25:06,719
Oh, my God. Shelley, that's Colby.
I'm in love with him.

383
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:10,557
Oh, that's so sweet.
How long have you guys been going out?

384
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:15,163
No. We are not going out.
I've never even talked to him.

385
00:25:16,034 --> 00:25:17,831
And he's coming this way. What do I do?

386
00:25:17,902 --> 00:25:19,164
Do sexy.

387
00:25:20,538 --> 00:25:24,338
Wash these cars, you sexy bitches!

388
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:27,139
They are filthy. And so are you!

389
00:25:27,946 --> 00:25:29,937
Did she just call us bitches?

390
00:25:30,014 --> 00:25:31,811
Did she just call us sexy?

391
00:25:31,883 --> 00:25:34,181
Wash! Wash! Wash!

392
00:25:34,252 --> 00:25:37,346
Wash! Wash! Wash! Wash!

393
00:25:40,058 --> 00:25:41,650
- Hey, girls.
- Hi.

394
00:25:42,493 --> 00:25:45,621
Okay, that's the first time we've ever spoken, so... First time.

395
00:25:45,697 --> 00:25:46,789
Hi!

396
00:25:47,432 --> 00:25:51,368
We're just washing cars and being sexy.

397
00:25:51,436 --> 00:25:52,425
Mostly sexy.

398
00:25:52,503 --> 00:25:55,495
So, does anybody want a wet T-shirt?

399
00:25:56,441 --> 00:26:00,002
- Yeah.
- Or, you know, maybe some wet pants.

400
00:26:04,782 --> 00:26:07,910
Someone went accident in her sexy pants.

401
00:26:07,986 --> 00:26:11,581
So, anyway, we're having some drinks over at Theta later.

402
00:26:11,656 --> 00:26:13,556
- Theta.
- Totally.

403
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:15,684
You wanna come over?

404
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,920
Yes.

405
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:20,693
Well, we are a little thirsty.

406
00:26:20,765 --> 00:26:23,097
Maybe you guys are, too.

407
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:26,261
Why don't you have a drink right now?

408
00:26:26,337 --> 00:26:28,430
I'll take a little sip.

409
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:34,701
I am so sorry.

410
00:26:35,847 --> 00:26:39,408
Thought I'd help you wash the testosterone off your face, Colby.

411
00:26:39,484 --> 00:26:41,008
Well, cool.

412
00:26:41,085 --> 00:26:44,953
So, what time can we drop by for drinks?

413
00:26:46,357 --> 00:26:48,325
Now that you mention it,

414
00:26:49,027 --> 00:26:50,722
the guest list is looking pretty full.

415
00:26:50,795 --> 00:26:53,229
So, maybe next time, all right?

416
00:26:53,298 --> 00:26:54,856
Hey, Super-brace!

417
00:26:54,933 --> 00:26:57,731
Il can. Il can.

418
00:26:57,802 --> 00:27:01,169
Not cool, man. Let's go.
Come on, come on, let's go.

419
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,108
Well, I think we're done here, sexy bitches.

420
00:27:05,176 --> 00:27:07,235
Thanks a lot, Mona.

421
00:27:07,312 --> 00:27:09,940
The one chance I get to talk to Colby,
and you completely ruin it.

422
00:27:10,014 --> 00:27:13,512
Yeah, because the whole peeing in your pants thing
was really working out well for you.

423
00:27:13,584 --> 00:27:14,917
Thank you.

424
00:27:14,986 --> 00:27:18,581
My car's still dirty, so I'll be out here if you need me.

425
00:27:21,626 --> 00:27:23,685
Do you want a car wash?

426
00:27:25,463 --> 00:27:26,760
Me?

427
00:27:26,831 --> 00:27:29,425
Oh, no. No. I have a bike.

428
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,695
Besides, I gotta get back to work.

429
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:34,135
Oh, yeah. I know all about work.

430
00:27:34,672 --> 00:27:37,072
I'm at work right now, actually.

431
00:27:37,141 --> 00:27:39,302
Oh, do you wash cars?

432
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,038
No. I'm the Zeta Sorority Housemother.

433
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,342
You seem a little young to be a housemother.

434
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:46,644
Really?

435
00:27:47,552 --> 00:27:49,713
You think I'm young?

436
00:27:49,787 --> 00:27:51,880
Oh, thank you.

437
00:27:51,956 --> 00:27:53,480
Thank you.

438
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:57,255
I'm sorry to invade your space, but I needed that.

439
00:27:58,997 --> 00:28:01,192
So, what's your job?

440
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:03,290
Oh... Job.

441
00:28:04,102 --> 00:28:07,162
I manage a nursing home.

442
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,234
It's so great you give nurses a place to live.

443
00:28:13,011 --> 00:28:16,174
Actually, it's a nursing home for senior citizens.

444
00:28:16,581 --> 00:28:19,414
An old folks'... Old people. Old people.

445
00:28:20,018 --> 00:28:21,849
I know lots of old men.

446
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,912
Hairy and not hairy.
But I don't mean to brag.

447
00:28:26,557 --> 00:28:28,388
So, they live there?

448
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,451
Like an orphanage for old people?

449
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:35,363
Well, yeah. I mean, that's one way you could look at it. Yeah.

450
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:41,166
Their parents are gone, and they live in a big building all
by themselves, wondering where everybody went,

451
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:43,366
and I think I'm gonna cry.

452
00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:49,737
Listen, if you want, you know,
you could stop by the nursing home,

453
00:28:49,814 --> 00:28:56,222
because we always need volunteers to help out and
visit with the old people, if you're interested.

454
00:28:56,587 --> 00:28:59,488
Yeah. I'd love to.

455
00:29:01,526 --> 00:29:05,462
My name is Shelley.
And I like long walks and hate rude people.

456
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,390
Oh, that's good to know. I'm Oliver.

457
00:29:09,467 --> 00:29:11,765
- OLiver.
- Yes.

458
00:29:11,836 --> 00:29:16,205
I like taking long walks with rude people.
Only on short piers, though.

459
00:29:20,912 --> 00:29:22,504
That's funny.

460
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,480
- You're funny.
- Thank you.

461
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:25,982
- Bye.
- Bye.

462
00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:30,813
Guys.

463
00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:33,948
Okay, this isn't my fault. Don't like...

464
00:29:34,025 --> 00:29:35,959
I know it was a disaster, but she's...

465
00:29:36,027 --> 00:29:39,292
You guys, I just had the best idea for our phila-tropy.

466
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:40,694
Philanthropy.

467
00:29:40,765 --> 00:29:43,893
We are gonna volunteer at Oliver's nursing home.

468
00:29:43,968 --> 00:29:45,629
Who is Oliver?

469
00:29:45,703 --> 00:29:48,763
He's this guy I just met. He's really sweet.

470
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,205
And he's kind of cute, too.

471
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:52,774
Well...

472
00:29:52,844 --> 00:29:57,645
I don't know if you guys can recognize this,
but Shelley is meeting guys.

473
00:29:57,715 --> 00:30:00,479
And if she knows how to meet guys,
then we will learn how to meet guys.

474
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:04,544
Then more girls'll wanna hang out with us.
Hence, more pledges.

475
00:30:05,123 --> 00:30:06,715
Yeah. Hence!

476
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:08,520
Okay, here's what we need to do.

477
00:30:08,593 --> 00:30:15,213
We need to get all dressed up, and then we need to go to a club
and drink fruity drinks and dirty-dance with each other.

478
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,397
- Why?
- To bond, y'old grumpy.

479
00:30:19,837 --> 00:30:22,397
Yeah, y'old grumpy. To bond.

480
00:30:22,473 --> 00:30:25,670
The music's playing.
Our bodies are swaying.

481
00:30:25,743 --> 00:30:27,142
You know what I'm saying?

482
00:30:27,211 --> 00:30:31,079
You know? We could like play some form of dodge ball, maybe.

483
00:30:33,684 --> 00:30:36,653
We could tie our shoes together, our tennis shoes,

484
00:30:36,721 --> 00:30:39,349
and we could throw them over telephone wires.

485
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:43,222
Because I see that everywhere, and it seems like
people would have fun doing that.

486
00:30:43,194 --> 00:30:45,219
Like, "How hard can you throw?"

487
00:30:45,296 --> 00:30:48,527
You know what I mean? Like how...
What are you...

488
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:53,896
Or we could go to a club.

489
00:31:08,085 --> 00:31:11,452
Six Virgin Marys and one Kamikaze.

490
00:31:11,522 --> 00:31:15,253
Here's to Zetas, to making you guys the best sorority ever.

491
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:20,930
Oh, Mona, that guy is totally checking you out.

492
00:31:20,998 --> 00:31:23,899
- Go flirt with him.
- Right.

493
00:31:23,968 --> 00:31:26,630
Think of it as research, Mona. Research.

494
00:31:26,704 --> 00:31:28,695
Get over there. Get on that horse!

495
00:31:28,773 --> 00:31:30,900
Go, go. Go!

496
00:31:35,246 --> 00:31:36,577
You like what you see, stud?

497
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:39,411
I'm not really sure what I'm looking at, metalface.

498
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:41,974
Let me guess, is it a Hannibal Lecter thing?

499
00:31:42,053 --> 00:31:43,486
Yeah, it is.

500
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,354
There's a big box of cutesicles.

501
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,125
Carrie Mae, go work your magic.

502
00:31:54,198 --> 00:31:56,325
The only magic I've ever done was try to figure out a way

503
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,530
to stay in college for nine years and not
go back to my trailer park in Idaho.

504
00:32:00,605 --> 00:32:03,506
So, figure out a way into his heart.

505
00:32:03,574 --> 00:32:07,408
Just go over there and talk to him about any old thing.

506
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:14,150
Excuse me, you know where the crapper is?

507
00:32:14,218 --> 00:32:16,812
I have to drop off some timber.

508
00:32:18,656 --> 00:32:20,123
Go away.

509
00:32:21,459 --> 00:32:23,324
What'd I do?

510
00:32:23,394 --> 00:32:25,828
It's okay. It's just, Carrie Mae, sometimes

511
00:32:25,896 --> 00:32:29,730
men like their women with a little bit of mystery.

512
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:32,769
So, get back over there and try it again.

513
00:32:37,675 --> 00:32:39,108
Excuse me.

514
00:32:39,844 --> 00:32:41,311
You know where the crapper is?

515
00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:44,405
I have to do a very mysterious thing in there.

516
00:32:44,949 --> 00:32:46,917
Drop off some timber.

517
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:51,152
I'm definitely not drunk enough for that.

518
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:58,259
Well, this is good, though.

519
00:32:58,329 --> 00:33:00,524
This is really good practice.

520
00:33:01,132 --> 00:33:02,599
Hey, it's the Zetas.

521
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:03,929
- Hi.
- Hi.

522
00:33:04,001 --> 00:33:05,662
I feel like we never see you guys out.

523
00:33:05,736 --> 00:33:08,227
We never see them out, either.

524
00:33:08,306 --> 00:33:11,036
I met you yesterday.
I was that homeless girl.

525
00:33:11,108 --> 00:33:12,575
Now I'm their house mom.

526
00:33:12,643 --> 00:33:15,305
Congratulations. That's awesome.

527
00:33:15,379 --> 00:33:18,143
So, hey, you guys got here just in time.

528
00:33:18,215 --> 00:33:22,447
We're doing a little karaoke contest.
Sororities versus fraternities.

529
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,011
Yeah, you guys can go next if you want.

530
00:33:25,089 --> 00:33:26,579
Yeah! Come on!

531
00:33:26,657 --> 00:33:30,423
Oh, girls! Always say "yes" to karaoke.

532
00:33:31,095 --> 00:33:32,926
Yeah, we'll pick a great song for you.

533
00:33:32,997 --> 00:33:35,158
Don't worry, you can't be any worse than we were.

534
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,393
- Seriously, we were wretched.
- Awful.

535
00:33:37,468 --> 00:33:39,368
- I don't know.
- Oh, okay. Okay, listen.

536
00:33:39,437 --> 00:33:43,373
Just give me a second.
I promise the Zetas are going up on stage.

537
00:33:43,441 --> 00:33:44,999
Awesome. Great.

538
00:33:45,743 --> 00:33:48,337
You guys, karaoke is so fun!

539
00:33:48,412 --> 00:33:51,813
You gotta get up there and do karaoke.
Boys like singing. It's sexy.

540
00:33:51,882 --> 00:33:55,613
Go! Go! Get up there! Go! Go!

541
00:33:56,721 --> 00:33:58,348
I think we can do it.

542
00:33:58,422 --> 00:34:00,686
We can do anything better than those mannequins, you guys.

543
00:34:00,758 --> 00:34:02,726
I might puke, but let's do it!

544
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:04,556
That's the spirit!

545
00:34:05,563 --> 00:34:09,294
All right! Get up there, you Bravehearts!

546
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,864
All right, that was Kappa Eta Sigma!

547
00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:23,308
Next up, the Zetas?

548
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:27,014
Singing "Like A Virgin"

549
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:37,817
 I made it through the wilderness 

550
00:34:38,462 --> 00:34:41,727
 Somehow I made it through 

551
00:34:43,701 --> 00:34:48,832
 Didn't know how lost I was Until I found you 

552
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:54,272
 I was beat, incomplete 

553
00:34:54,345 --> 00:34:58,873
 I'm a hag and I'm fat and rude 

554
00:34:58,949 --> 00:35:01,713
 But you made me feel 

555
00:35:02,586 --> 00:35:05,521
 Yeah, you made me feel 

556
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:10,219
 Like a big bag of poop 

557
00:35:10,661 --> 00:35:12,629
 Like a loser 

558
00:35:13,998 --> 00:35:17,559
 We're rejected all the time 

559
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:22,468
 Like a loser 

560
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,476
 Who's so retarded, it's a crime 

561
00:35:26,544 --> 00:35:28,341
 Like a... 

562
00:35:38,322 --> 00:35:40,187
That was not nice.

563
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:42,387
Awesome.

564
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,451
You wanna get cut, bitch?

565
00:35:44,528 --> 00:35:47,463
Oh, classy. Very classy.

566
00:35:47,531 --> 00:35:51,627
No, no, no, no, she's right, Courtney.
I mean, we should apologize.

567
00:35:51,702 --> 00:35:53,602
Especially since we're about to take their house.

568
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:56,231
- Oh, right.
- Where are you taking it?

569
00:35:56,307 --> 00:35:58,969
Well, we heard that you were losing your charter,

570
00:35:59,043 --> 00:36:03,309
so Phi lota Mu is gonna buy your crappy
house when it goes on sale after rush.

571
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:07,783
Yes, we are going to have so many pledges,
we'll need all of the extra space.

572
00:36:07,852 --> 00:36:09,251
Oh, but don't worry.

573
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,448
I mean, we'll still let you guys stay on and be the maids.

574
00:36:12,523 --> 00:36:16,254
You can sweep the chimney.
Won't that be nice?

575
00:36:16,327 --> 00:36:18,192
Does the little one understand human talk?

576
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:23,111
Oh, and I guess that when we buy your house,
you'll go back to being homeless.

577
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:24,361
I'm a housemother.

578
00:36:24,435 --> 00:36:27,927
A Zeta housemother, and I don't like
some of the things you were saying.

579
00:36:28,005 --> 00:36:31,441
Because they do understand human talk,
and you hurt their feelings.

580
00:36:31,509 --> 00:36:33,500
Oh, Shelley, come on.
It's not worth it, let's go.

581
00:36:33,577 --> 00:36:35,044
Yeah, you should go.

582
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:36,443
It was so nice to see you.

583
00:36:36,514 --> 00:36:37,503
But I really think that...

584
00:36:37,581 --> 00:36:38,741
- So nice.
- So nice.

585
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:42,977
That was so humiliating, you guys.

586
00:36:43,053 --> 00:36:44,247
I know it was awful.

587
00:36:44,321 --> 00:36:50,392
And I am so mad that they did that to you guys,
but we can't listen to those girls.

588
00:36:50,461 --> 00:36:53,362
Why? They're right. We are losers.

589
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,421
Oh, we're not losers.

590
00:36:56,033 --> 00:36:58,399
You just ignore that dumb old wall.

591
00:36:59,537 --> 00:37:03,598
Well, you're not a loser, Shelley.
People like you. You're pretty.

592
00:37:03,674 --> 00:37:06,666
I just don't understand that kind of behavior.

593
00:37:07,378 --> 00:37:08,777
Trust me.

594
00:37:08,846 --> 00:37:13,283
You guys, I can make you way hotter than any old Phi lota Mu.

595
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:18,520
By the time I'm done, every girl on
campus'll want to pledge Zeta.

596
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:21,490
No, really, we are just a bunch of misfits.

597
00:37:22,993 --> 00:37:26,952
Lilly just texted me from the closet.
She says we're not misfits.

598
00:37:27,031 --> 00:37:28,623
Well, I hope she was being ironic.

599
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:31,534
Go, go, go, go, go!

600
00:37:31,602 --> 00:37:32,762
- Are we doing this?
- Do it!

601
00:37:32,836 --> 00:37:34,463
- All right.
- Here.

602
00:37:34,538 --> 00:37:36,403
You can do this.

603
00:37:36,473 --> 00:37:40,466
If I thought you all were quitting...
My heart would just fall out of my head.

604
00:37:40,544 --> 00:37:42,876
Shelley, your heart is not in your head.

605
00:37:42,947 --> 00:37:46,542
Your heart has its own cavity.
Right under your fake boobs.

606
00:37:46,617 --> 00:37:50,850
Do you understand how moronic you sound when you
say your heart is gonna fall out of your head?

607
00:37:51,388 --> 00:37:52,878
Well, Mona,

608
00:37:53,457 --> 00:37:57,518
I totally understand why that saying sounds mixed-up,

609
00:37:57,595 --> 00:37:59,859
but I don't mean it for real.

610
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:03,297
I don't think that my heart is in my skull.

611
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:08,361
What I mean is that sometimes logic tells you to do something,

612
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:11,897
but you have to have part of your heart in it as well.

613
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:17,473
My head and my heart tell me that we can save Zeta.

614
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:23,518
We need 30 pledges, and I know just how to do it.

615
00:38:24,421 --> 00:38:27,879
By making you guys the hottest girls on campus.

616
00:38:33,664 --> 00:38:35,097
I'll get it.

617
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,431
- Does that say "Zeta"?
- Yeah.

618
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:46,775
This is war.

619
00:38:46,844 --> 00:38:48,436
Enough is enough.

620
00:38:48,512 --> 00:38:51,709
Let's do this. There's no way those
bitches are getting our house.

621
00:39:05,462 --> 00:39:08,954
Okay, ladies, dressing sexy is all about skimplifying.

622
00:39:09,033 --> 00:39:12,332
I want you to show skin in the four major regions.

623
00:39:12,403 --> 00:39:15,566
Arms, legs, belly and cleavage.

624
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:17,004
Is this how you skimplify?

625
00:39:17,074 --> 00:39:22,573
Oh, okay. Well, maybe we could let someone who doesn't
have a giant baby in their belly give it a try.

626
00:39:22,646 --> 00:39:27,208
Okay, this is your most important secret weapon, the water bra.

627
00:39:27,284 --> 00:39:29,343
Just stay away from sharp corners.

628
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,354
This is going too far.

629
00:39:31,855 --> 00:39:33,686
No. No way. No.

630
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:37,788
Just consider it like another thesis topic, you know?

631
00:39:37,861 --> 00:39:41,297
"Conventional Archetypes of Beauty and
Their Effect on the opposite Sex."

632
00:39:48,238 --> 00:39:49,466
Are you sure that's everything?

633
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:54,239
Because feeling good on the inside is all
about looking good on the outside.

634
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:01,813
Go ahead and keep that one.

635
00:40:01,885 --> 00:40:04,979
There are three rules to successful flirtation.

636
00:40:05,055 --> 00:40:08,456
Eye contact, flattery and lots of touching.

637
00:40:08,525 --> 00:40:11,756
For example, let's pretend that Natalie here is a man.

638
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:18,300
I'm touching his arm, I'm looking deep into his eyes
and I'm wearing deodorant. Carrie Mae?

639
00:40:18,368 --> 00:40:19,630
I know.

640
00:40:19,703 --> 00:40:22,194
And I might say something like this.

641
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:26,333
"Oh, my gosh. Your biceps are huge. Kiss me."

642
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:30,573
And then he would kiss me.
So, any questions?

643
00:40:30,647 --> 00:40:33,013
What do I do with my chew?

644
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:34,448
How long would the kiss usually be?

645
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:37,749
And, also, why would he kiss you, because you...

646
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:45,052
Okay, ladies, today's lesson is makeup.

647
00:40:45,129 --> 00:40:47,825
First, we must highlight your eyes.

648
00:40:47,898 --> 00:40:50,765
The eyes are the nipples of the face.

649
00:41:38,015 --> 00:41:39,448
Whoa.

650
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,217
Wow.

651
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,328
So this is what it feels like to not be invisible.

652
00:41:52,396 --> 00:41:56,025
We weren't exactly invisible before, just the anti-hot.

653
00:41:57,467 --> 00:41:58,764
Check out Joanne.

654
00:41:58,836 --> 00:42:00,633
I really like what you've done with the Bedazzler.

655
00:42:00,704 --> 00:42:02,638
- Thank you.
- It's nice.

656
00:42:02,706 --> 00:42:03,798
So what's next, Shelley?

657
00:42:03,874 --> 00:42:07,241
I want all the fraternities to see how hot you guys are.

658
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:11,111
Kind of like a coming-out party.
So we are gonna take some pictures.

659
00:42:11,181 --> 00:42:13,513
Oh, we are not posing for Playboy.

660
00:42:13,584 --> 00:42:17,281
No, in a calendar. "The Girls of Zeta."

661
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:19,049
Everyone will see the new you,

662
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:22,819
and selling the calendars will help us raise
money for our phil-an-coppopopy.

663
00:42:22,893 --> 00:42:25,020
Hey, you guys, Lilly just texted me.

664
00:42:25,095 --> 00:42:27,791
She says we look hot and this is fun.

665
00:42:33,537 --> 00:42:37,166
Keep doing that, keep doing that.
Make love to the camera.

666
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:40,435
I saw that in Austin Powers.

667
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:45,345
Yeah, work it. Think really sexy witch.

668
00:42:45,415 --> 00:42:48,942
- Are you a good witch or a bad witch?
- A good witch.

669
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:51,044
I think you're a bad witch.

670
00:42:51,121 --> 00:42:55,649
I bet the house that falls on you is gonna be a sexy house.

671
00:42:56,226 --> 00:42:58,660
Work it. Work it.

672
00:42:58,729 --> 00:43:02,495
You're like a supermodel, except more pregnant. Keep going.

673
00:43:21,151 --> 00:43:25,747
Okay, Henry, very glad you finally learned
how to use the suggestion box.

674
00:43:25,822 --> 00:43:30,350
And I want to let you know that I got your message,
you want less Boggle and more bingo.

675
00:43:30,427 --> 00:43:32,520
So I'm gonna work on it, okay?

676
00:43:32,596 --> 00:43:35,531
Whoa.
Okay, what's going on with your heart?

677
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:37,996
Shelley, you're here.

678
00:43:39,937 --> 00:43:41,768
- Move out of the way, man.
- Move it, Junior.

679
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:43,237
- Sideways.
- Sorry, sorry.

680
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,071
- Hi.
- Hi.

681
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:50,437
We brought a donation as part of our philtrophy.

682
00:43:50,514 --> 00:43:52,846
Oh, great. Thank you.

683
00:43:53,617 --> 00:43:54,982
We're making calendars,

684
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:59,850
and before we could even get them all out,
the printing-press guys bought up the first batch.

685
00:43:59,923 --> 00:44:01,948
Wow. Great, thank you very much.

686
00:44:02,025 --> 00:44:05,552
This is, "Pay to the order of old People."

687
00:44:06,897 --> 00:44:08,831
Yes, and it doesn't stop there.

688
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:13,734
I hope you don't mind, but I brought a few
extra volunteers to help out today.

689
00:44:15,572 --> 00:44:18,132
Henry, Henry, look away. Look away, okay?

690
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:22,872
Look at the wall.
Think of broccoli and bad bingo cards.

691
00:44:22,946 --> 00:44:28,888
You know, actually, your timing is perfect, because
I was about to try and organize a dance class.

692
00:44:28,952 --> 00:44:30,476
Nobody signed up.

693
00:44:30,554 --> 00:44:33,580
And I was at the top of the list not signing up.

694
00:44:33,657 --> 00:44:37,218
There ain't no way I'm dancing.
You can forget that.

695
00:44:37,294 --> 00:44:39,592
Oh, I love to dance.

696
00:44:39,663 --> 00:44:40,925
Well, let's do it.

697
00:44:44,234 --> 00:44:47,169
Okay, ladies, fan out and find a partner.

698
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:53,235
And maybe we should talk about this music.

699
00:44:54,878 --> 00:44:57,870
Wow, this music is super, super-great,

700
00:44:57,948 --> 00:45:02,282
but we might want to try something a little sexier.

701
00:45:17,567 --> 00:45:19,296
Great job, ladies.

702
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:36,481
Shelley, I just want to thank you so much for doing this.

703
00:45:36,553 --> 00:45:37,645
It's just so kind.

704
00:45:37,721 --> 00:45:42,249
Oh, well, kindness is just love with its work boots on.

705
00:45:43,226 --> 00:45:45,751
Hey, Oliver, ask the girl to dance.

706
00:45:47,197 --> 00:45:49,131
- I'd love to.
- Really?

707
00:45:51,701 --> 00:45:53,430
Looking good, Jean.

708
00:45:54,938 --> 00:45:59,466
So, listen, Shelley, I was wondering
if maybe you'd like to have dinner sometime.

709
00:45:59,543 --> 00:46:01,943
Really? Yes. Yeah.

710
00:46:02,412 --> 00:46:03,640
Great.

711
00:46:04,848 --> 00:46:07,715
- Bitchsuck!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

712
00:46:07,784 --> 00:46:09,513
Oh, it's all good.

713
00:46:12,389 --> 00:46:14,152
I'm so glad to be back.

714
00:46:14,224 --> 00:46:18,183
Marvin, tell Shelley we're back and we're
gonna be watching a movie.

715
00:46:18,261 --> 00:46:19,888
How about something spooky? No, funny.

716
00:46:19,963 --> 00:46:22,158
No. How about Scarface?

717
00:46:22,232 --> 00:46:24,462
No, you guys, I think it should be Shelley's pick tonight.

718
00:46:24,534 --> 00:46:29,233
Mr. Hefner, Shelley's actually gone.
She told me to give you this letter.

719
00:46:38,315 --> 00:46:41,682
Shelley moved to Africa to work with the orphans.

720
00:46:41,751 --> 00:46:46,100
She left while we were gone because she
says she can't deal with goodbyes.

721
00:46:48,024 --> 00:46:50,720
I'm going to bed. No movies tonight.

722
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:55,427
You look nervous.

723
00:46:55,499 --> 00:46:58,900
I don't like when you look nervous.
You will not blow this!

724
00:46:58,969 --> 00:47:00,163
But I just wanna mix drinks.

725
00:47:00,237 --> 00:47:02,467
You know, my whole life, that's all I've ever wanted to do,

726
00:47:02,539 --> 00:47:04,234
is just blend.

727
00:47:04,307 --> 00:47:07,071
And then you come along with your weird
kryptonite death grip, and...

728
00:47:07,144 --> 00:47:09,544
- That's right, it's like this.
- Oh, good God!

729
00:47:09,613 --> 00:47:11,171
Oh, sweet bastard, that's good.

730
00:47:11,248 --> 00:47:14,581
That's right, and I'm the only woman
that can make you feel like that.

731
00:47:14,651 --> 00:47:18,178
You will not tell Hef that we wrote that letter to Shelley.

732
00:47:18,255 --> 00:47:19,483
- Just do it again.
- Got it?

733
00:47:19,556 --> 00:47:22,423
- Yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it. So I got it.
- Good.

734
00:47:32,836 --> 00:47:34,360
Hi. I'll take two calendars.

735
00:47:34,437 --> 00:47:38,066
Wow. That's so generous.
Everyone's been buying two.

736
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:40,939
Actually, it's in case one gets ruined.

737
00:47:41,978 --> 00:47:44,139
Hot dogs, Zeta hot dogs. Who wants one?

738
00:47:44,214 --> 00:47:46,705
You. You. You got one.

739
00:47:51,221 --> 00:47:53,121
Sweet setup here.

740
00:47:54,191 --> 00:47:57,183
We should totally have a mixer with you guys sometime.

741
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,454
Yeah.

742
00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:04,760
We could have one with Battle...

743
00:48:04,834 --> 00:48:06,324
What? Ne more time.

744
00:48:06,436 --> 00:48:09,928
We could have a Battlestar Galactica night.
With pudding!

745
00:48:10,006 --> 00:48:12,031
Definitely! What?

746
00:48:12,108 --> 00:48:13,973
Battlestar Galactica. Okay.

747
00:48:14,044 --> 00:48:18,140
She said that you guys should get together
some night, with pudding.

748
00:48:18,815 --> 00:48:19,975
Whoa.

749
00:48:20,584 --> 00:48:22,814
You betcha. You betcha.

750
00:48:22,886 --> 00:48:27,084
At Phi lota Mu we are very exclusive, because we can be.

751
00:48:27,157 --> 00:48:30,354
Many of our sisters are leaders on campus.

752
00:48:30,427 --> 00:48:35,660
We have a rocking GPA and our very own Korean manicurist.

753
00:48:41,771 --> 00:48:43,932
Hey, where are you guys going?

754
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:46,976
- Whose booth is that?
- That's Zeta's booth.

755
00:48:47,577 --> 00:48:50,375
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would they have a booth?

756
00:48:50,447 --> 00:48:51,539
And who would go to it?

757
00:48:51,615 --> 00:48:53,674
- Do you want some ketchup?
- That'd be great.

758
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:56,048
I can totally hose you some right there.
Go ahead, lean back.

759
00:48:56,119 --> 00:48:57,950
No, I'm just...

760
00:49:01,758 --> 00:49:04,056
- Excuse me.
- Why, did you fart?

761
00:49:04,961 --> 00:49:07,088
- Did I do what?
- Fart.

762
00:49:09,266 --> 00:49:10,699
Where are the Zetas?

763
00:49:10,767 --> 00:49:13,099
We are the Zetas, 2008 edition.

764
00:49:13,169 --> 00:49:14,932
And I'm in love!

765
00:49:27,651 --> 00:49:29,346
Why'd you do that?

766
00:49:29,419 --> 00:49:31,512
I needed to hurt someone.

767
00:49:34,824 --> 00:49:38,055
This is so awesome, you guys.
That was so much fun!

768
00:49:38,128 --> 00:49:39,720
It was, it was.

769
00:49:39,796 --> 00:49:42,788
Harmony, Brian Stone was all over you, girl.

770
00:49:43,733 --> 00:49:44,961
- And how about Mona?
- What?

771
00:49:45,035 --> 00:49:47,902
I got numbers from four boys.
It was all for research.

772
00:49:47,971 --> 00:49:49,029
Liar.

773
00:49:49,105 --> 00:49:51,369
- Careful what you research.
- But I really had fun.

774
00:49:51,441 --> 00:49:56,538
Well, Natalie, Colby was following you around like a puppy dog.

775
00:49:57,447 --> 00:50:00,143
Do you guys think you'll, you know...

776
00:50:01,484 --> 00:50:02,576
No.

777
00:50:03,687 --> 00:50:07,589
I do not think, you know, that.

778
00:50:08,024 --> 00:50:09,252
"That"?

779
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:13,795
Natalie, are you a virgin?

780
00:50:14,998 --> 00:50:16,363
No.

781
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,361
Am I a virgin? No.

782
00:50:20,203 --> 00:50:21,363
You're a virgin!

783
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:24,669
Shelley! It's like an amphitheater in here!

784
00:50:24,741 --> 00:50:26,299
That's it.

785
00:50:26,376 --> 00:50:28,606
Oh, my gosh.
We have to have an Aztec party.

786
00:50:28,678 --> 00:50:32,566
We always wanted to have one at the Mansion,
but we could never find a virgin to sacrifice.

787
00:50:33,316 --> 00:50:36,285
Natalie, it is gonna be the best time ever.

788
00:50:36,353 --> 00:50:41,154
We are gonna have the most rockingest party,
and then we'll get our 30 pledges.

789
00:50:55,472 --> 00:50:57,463
Okay, quick trick, watch this.

790
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:00,634
We are gonna put little trails of Vaseline
on the contours of our abs,

791
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:04,544
mist it a little, and that way the light will catch our tans.

792
00:51:07,217 --> 00:51:09,811
Oh, she says you're completely ingenious, Shelley.

793
00:51:09,886 --> 00:51:11,615
Thank you, Lilly.

794
00:51:11,688 --> 00:51:13,178
That's the same as vapid, right?

795
00:51:13,256 --> 00:51:15,554
Oh, it's better than vapid.

796
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:18,788
- Is that Juicy?
- Yeah, I love their stuff.

797
00:51:18,862 --> 00:51:22,229
It's a shame nobody'd be able to see it, you know, under my brace.

798
00:51:22,298 --> 00:51:24,493
Well, when can you take the brace off?

799
00:51:24,567 --> 00:51:27,195
2004, actually.

800
00:51:28,471 --> 00:51:30,371
Well, it's a good thing I asked.

801
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:35,844
No, I'm so fine.
I mean, you know, it's all indented into me

802
00:51:35,912 --> 00:51:38,904
and, you know, if I took it off, I wouldn't even
know what would possibly happen,

803
00:51:38,982 --> 00:51:41,576
and my spine could be like a noodle. And...

804
00:51:41,651 --> 00:51:44,085
I'm really good. I'm good. Thanks.

805
00:51:46,122 --> 00:51:47,589
Come with me.

806
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:53,460
Joanne, when I was little, I wore a Scooby-Doo mask to school
for a whole month because I thought I was ugly.

807
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:54,758
- Thanks, guys.
- You're welcome.

808
00:51:54,831 --> 00:51:59,630
And then one day a boy, Howard Rubenstock,
snuck up behind me and tore it off my face.

809
00:51:59,702 --> 00:52:02,694
- Do you know what I realized?
- That you were pretty?

810
00:52:02,772 --> 00:52:05,434
No, that I was wearing it upside down.

811
00:52:06,042 --> 00:52:08,340
I'm not really sure what you're trying to tell me, Shelley.

812
00:52:08,411 --> 00:52:12,814
I'm not either. But the point is,
you're a butterfly now, not an earthworm.

813
00:52:12,882 --> 00:52:14,907
You don't need to hide anymore.

814
00:52:14,984 --> 00:52:17,509
So, okay, here he comes.

815
00:52:17,587 --> 00:52:20,454
He runs past here every day, and I've seen you staring at him.

816
00:52:20,523 --> 00:52:25,200
I can tell that you like him and that you want to talk to him.
Today's the day. Go invite him to our party.

817
00:52:25,228 --> 00:52:26,661
Go. Go.

818
00:52:31,734 --> 00:52:33,531
Run, Joanne, run!

819
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:02,056
Hi, Steve.

820
00:53:02,131 --> 00:53:05,191
Oh, hey, Joanne. How are you?
I didn't know you ran.

821
00:53:05,268 --> 00:53:07,429
Sure, I mean, I do now.

822
00:53:07,504 --> 00:53:08,869
Where's your brace?

823
00:53:08,938 --> 00:53:10,803
- It's gone.
- Really?

824
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,538
Well.

825
00:53:18,615 --> 00:53:20,776
You're pretty pleased with yourself, aren't you?

826
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:24,445
Oh, you scared me.
My heart's pounding like a nail.

827
00:53:26,089 --> 00:53:28,489
I guess I am a little proud.

828
00:53:28,558 --> 00:53:30,924
Well, don't get too used to that feeling.

829
00:53:30,994 --> 00:53:34,088
Because there's no way that I'm going
to let a whorey little tart like you

830
00:53:34,163 --> 00:53:36,859
stand in the way of the Phi lota Mu.

831
00:53:37,534 --> 00:53:39,559
Don't mess with me.

832
00:53:39,636 --> 00:53:41,900
Don't mess with Phi lota Mu.

833
00:53:46,809 --> 00:53:51,678
Man! Someone needs a mani-pedi massage combo, pronto.

834
00:53:51,748 --> 00:53:52,840
- Shelley!
- H, my...

835
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:55,282
Steve said he's gonna come to the Aztec party.

836
00:53:55,351 --> 00:53:56,875
Steve, he's gonna come.

837
00:53:56,953 --> 00:53:59,581
Yay! This is gonna be so much fun!

838
00:54:16,706 --> 00:54:20,164
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- God! Oh, my God!

839
00:54:20,243 --> 00:54:22,438
- Yes!
- Hey, you guys! Look.

840
00:54:23,046 --> 00:54:24,411
Oh, Joanne.

841
00:54:25,248 --> 00:54:28,217
I can bend! You guys, I did it, I can bend!

842
00:54:31,821 --> 00:54:34,585
"Do you find yourself more attracted to me when I'm like this,

843
00:54:34,657 --> 00:54:36,318
or like this?"

844
00:54:37,393 --> 00:54:39,293
- The second one.
- Great.

845
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:42,093
So, "Because you like my boobs,

846
00:54:42,165 --> 00:54:45,396
would you stand there and let me go like this

847
00:54:46,302 --> 00:54:49,465
for five minutes, just in the hope that we might hook up?"

848
00:54:49,539 --> 00:54:51,871
Yes. Yes, I would.

849
00:54:55,211 --> 00:54:58,305
Guys! Anybody want some chips?

850
00:54:59,148 --> 00:55:00,775
Yeah, have chips while you party.

851
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:03,751
Badass party. Badass.

852
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:08,257
So, Miss December, you got your bikini on under there? Huh?

853
00:55:08,324 --> 00:55:11,122
No, actually, just my fake water...

854
00:55:11,194 --> 00:55:12,821
Natalie, there you are.

855
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:16,854
Oh, Bobby and Zach from Kappa are just dying to meet you.

856
00:55:16,933 --> 00:55:20,391
I'm sorry, Colby, but Natalie is a very hot commodity.

857
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:23,465
- Excuse us.
- Wait.

858
00:55:24,073 --> 00:55:25,370
Wait a second.

859
00:55:25,441 --> 00:55:27,204
- Are we leaving?
- Yes.

860
00:55:27,276 --> 00:55:28,368
Why?

861
00:55:28,444 --> 00:55:30,912
I have, like, the world's hugest crush on him.

862
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:31,969
So I don't really...

863
00:55:32,048 --> 00:55:34,812
I know. Then we need to let him see how in demand you are.

864
00:55:34,884 --> 00:55:37,751
Always remember, boys want what other boys want.

865
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,117
Right.

866
00:55:41,624 --> 00:55:43,182
Are you Lilly?

867
00:55:44,694 --> 00:55:47,026
That's a cute costume, Lil.

868
00:55:47,096 --> 00:55:49,428
I was gonna ask you this, because I've been seeing these all over.

869
00:55:49,499 --> 00:55:51,330
I mean, this is an Aztec party,

870
00:55:51,401 --> 00:55:54,529
you know, so those statues don't really fit,
because those are from Easter Island,

871
00:55:54,604 --> 00:55:57,539
which is like 2000 miles away,
as you probably know, in Polynesia.

872
00:55:57,607 --> 00:56:01,873
Wait, Natalie. You're too smart.
Boys don't like girls that are too smart.

873
00:56:01,944 --> 00:56:03,138
Right.

874
00:56:03,212 --> 00:56:06,511
Right.
God, I hope Colby didn't hear me say that.

875
00:56:07,417 --> 00:56:10,045
Shelley, you really know all the tricks.

876
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:11,711
How do you do it, you know?

877
00:56:11,788 --> 00:56:14,382
I mean, with Colby here and with Oliver asking you out,

878
00:56:14,457 --> 00:56:17,858
it's like we might both lose our virginity this year.

879
00:56:19,095 --> 00:56:20,392
Yeah.

880
00:56:25,234 --> 00:56:28,761
It's supposed to be a mixer.
There's no one here to mix.

881
00:56:29,505 --> 00:56:32,497
They're over there, aren't they? The Kappas.

882
00:56:32,575 --> 00:56:35,203
Well, they're definitely not here.

883
00:56:35,278 --> 00:56:37,974
I know that, dipswitch. I can see that.

884
00:56:41,384 --> 00:56:44,376
And now, let the sacrificial rites begin!

885
00:56:47,724 --> 00:56:52,525
It's time for this virgin to get sacrificed
in the boiling Jell-O lava!

886
00:56:53,329 --> 00:56:56,059
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

887
00:56:56,132 --> 00:56:58,225
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

888
00:56:58,301 --> 00:57:03,238
This is Aztec Night, the first of many
awesome Zeta parties to come.

889
00:57:03,306 --> 00:57:08,469
And for those of you girls going through rush, remember
to make Zeta your number-one choice!

890
00:57:13,049 --> 00:57:15,040
The time is now.

891
00:57:46,716 --> 00:57:48,013
Yeah.

892
00:57:49,585 --> 00:57:52,645
I've never seen anybody get sacrificed before.

893
00:57:53,523 --> 00:57:55,286
That was so hot.

894
00:57:55,358 --> 00:58:01,221
I mean, I don't know anything about Aztecs, you know?
Or their culture. But, I mean, I do know that I had fun.

895
00:58:01,731 --> 00:58:05,929
Yeah. I don't know anything about them either, so that's awesome.

896
00:58:13,442 --> 00:58:16,002
What have the Zetas become?

897
00:58:16,078 --> 00:58:17,875
Oh, my God.

898
00:58:17,947 --> 00:58:19,175
Popular.

899
00:58:39,202 --> 00:58:40,863
Remember, be sexy.

900
00:58:40,937 --> 00:58:43,701
- He's gonna love your shoes.
- Deep breath, take a deep breath.

901
00:58:43,773 --> 00:58:46,708
Okay, okay, he's here. Okay.

902
00:58:51,247 --> 00:58:52,805
- Hello.
- Hello.

903
00:58:52,882 --> 00:58:54,679
Wow, you look great.

904
00:58:55,351 --> 00:58:57,285
- Thank you.
- You ready?

905
00:59:02,992 --> 00:59:05,961
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

906
00:59:06,028 --> 00:59:09,555
- Would you mind if we walked?
- Oh, yes, I like to walk.

907
00:59:11,367 --> 00:59:13,892
And that's not the only thing I like.

908
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:17,303
No? You have a wide range of interests?

909
00:59:17,773 --> 00:59:21,539
Oh, yes. A big range.

910
00:59:23,913 --> 00:59:26,245
Oh, wait here for a second.

911
00:59:26,315 --> 00:59:29,341
I think I dropped some money over here the other day.

912
00:59:29,418 --> 00:59:32,012
I just don't know wherever could it be.

913
00:59:32,088 --> 00:59:34,921
Maybe it's over here by this manhole.

914
00:59:37,927 --> 00:59:39,895
That's fucking hot!

915
00:59:41,697 --> 00:59:46,066
I just went over there to look for my money

916
00:59:46,135 --> 00:59:48,968
which I had dropped the other day.

917
00:59:49,038 --> 00:59:52,769
I think it was a dollar coin, because I heard a clanging.

918
00:59:53,509 --> 00:59:56,171
But anyway, wow.

919
00:59:57,079 --> 00:59:59,138
Who knew steam can be hot?

920
00:59:59,548 --> 01:00:01,106
Yeah, that's...

921
01:00:01,183 --> 01:00:03,674
I wonder what they did when Marilyn Monroe did it.

922
01:00:03,753 --> 01:00:08,747
They probably added soothing botanicals
to the steam rising from the manhole.

923
01:00:08,824 --> 01:00:10,485
I like that word.

924
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,026
"Manhole."

925
01:00:13,663 --> 01:00:16,154
All right. What can I get you guys?

926
01:00:18,034 --> 01:00:22,437
Instead of the mahi-mahi, may I just get the one mahi,

927
01:00:22,505 --> 01:00:24,769
because I'm not that hungry?

928
01:00:25,508 --> 01:00:26,839
I'll ask.

929
01:00:28,811 --> 01:00:32,474
The chicken piccata for me.
Yeah, that'd be fine.

930
01:00:32,548 --> 01:00:34,175
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

931
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:37,276
"Piccata." That's another word I like.

932
01:00:38,287 --> 01:00:39,447
Piccata.

933
01:00:39,522 --> 01:00:43,788
- Yeah, it just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?
- Sounds like "Hotta."

934
01:00:43,859 --> 01:00:44,985
Yeah.

935
01:00:45,361 --> 01:00:47,727
Or "the Spanish Armada."

936
01:00:49,298 --> 01:00:51,391
- I like to rhyme.
- Yeah?

937
01:00:53,269 --> 01:00:57,103
...and StairMaster to tone the buttock area.

938
01:00:57,873 --> 01:01:01,138
I'd show you, but who really wants to see my butt?

939
01:01:03,479 --> 01:01:07,643
I mean, it's just a silly old butt with no tan lines.

940
01:01:09,318 --> 01:01:10,751
Yep.

941
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:15,382
Wow, this was really good food.
I hope it doesn't go straight to my butt.

942
01:01:16,425 --> 01:01:20,725
I mean, I think my butt would still be a pretty good one, though.

943
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:23,621
Yep. My ass.

944
01:01:24,834 --> 01:01:30,995
Oh, well, this has been fun, but we should probably
wrap it up, because I've got another date at 11.

945
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,698
Are you serious?

946
01:01:32,775 --> 01:01:35,938
Well, what's a girl in demand going to do?

947
01:01:38,814 --> 01:01:40,042
Wow. Okay.

948
01:01:40,116 --> 01:01:42,949
Yeah, well, dinner's on me.

949
01:01:43,019 --> 01:01:47,456
I'm gonna get going. I wouldn't want you
to keep the other guy waiting.

950
01:01:49,025 --> 01:01:50,287
Wait!

951
01:01:50,359 --> 01:01:52,827
Your biceps are huge! Kiss me.

952
01:01:58,801 --> 01:01:59,790
Oh, my God.

953
01:02:04,673 --> 01:02:05,799
Yeah, right.

954
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:07,672
Shelley's back.

955
01:02:07,743 --> 01:02:10,303
- How'd it go?
- How'd it go, Shelley?

956
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:12,877
Not good.

957
01:02:12,948 --> 01:02:14,779
- What?
- Why?

958
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:16,818
I don't think he likes me.

959
01:02:16,886 --> 01:02:19,514
He didn't fall for any of my tricks.

960
01:02:20,322 --> 01:02:22,847
That's impossible, your tricks always work.

961
01:02:22,925 --> 01:02:27,419
I did sexy, I did "other guys want me."

962
01:02:27,496 --> 01:02:30,431
You know, I worked every angle in the book.

963
01:02:30,499 --> 01:02:33,127
But I don't know, he just stared.

964
01:02:33,969 --> 01:02:39,735
What if Oliver is one of those guys who wants to have, like,
a conversation with a girl before he hooks up with her?

965
01:02:39,809 --> 01:02:41,106
He's gay?

966
01:02:41,811 --> 01:02:43,540
No, he's not gay.

967
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:47,248
Oh, I don't know.

968
01:02:50,352 --> 01:02:54,118
I'm just saying, you know, maybe he wants to talk first.

969
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:57,182
What if Oliver doesn't mind a smart girl?

970
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,918
- I know.
- Wait.

971
01:03:01,063 --> 01:03:04,829
So I have to learn things about things and stuff?

972
01:03:05,734 --> 01:03:07,292
About topics?

973
01:03:09,238 --> 01:03:11,502
- Can I even do that?
- Yeah. You can do that.

974
01:03:11,574 --> 01:03:13,769
You can do anything you set your mind to, Shelley.

975
01:04:31,854 --> 01:04:34,584
But you can't even tell I have boobs.

976
01:04:34,657 --> 01:04:37,057
Well, don't you think I should show him a little something?

977
01:04:37,126 --> 01:04:39,492
Give him a little philanthropy?

978
01:04:39,562 --> 01:04:42,554
Shelley, good job.
You used "philanthropy." That was fun.

979
01:04:42,631 --> 01:04:45,532
You know what? You're still too sexy.

980
01:04:45,601 --> 01:04:47,569
Nat, what if she wears your glasses?

981
01:04:47,636 --> 01:04:49,968
Good idea. Okay, here.

982
01:04:50,472 --> 01:04:51,996
Try these.

983
01:04:54,143 --> 01:04:57,670
Oh, my God. Natalie, you should really go to an eye doctor.

984
01:04:57,746 --> 01:05:00,544
That's actually how I got those glasses.

985
01:05:00,616 --> 01:05:02,379
So have you called Oliver yet?

986
01:05:02,451 --> 01:05:08,814
Yes. He didn't seem too excited to be going out
on a second date, but he said yes, so here goes.

987
01:05:08,891 --> 01:05:12,327
All right. Now remember, just be yourself, only different.

988
01:05:12,394 --> 01:05:14,726
- Don't use the word "elucidate."
- Pretty much entirely different.

989
01:05:14,797 --> 01:05:16,594
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Tone down the sexuality.

990
01:05:16,665 --> 01:05:19,463
Talk about politics and religion.
That's always a really good first-date topic.

991
01:05:19,535 --> 01:05:21,969
- Don't stare at him too much.
- Don't brush your teeth.

992
01:05:22,037 --> 01:05:23,368
- Bye, Shell.
- Bye.

993
01:05:23,439 --> 01:05:26,897
- Don't forget to call, Shelley.
- Say you're nauseous.

994
01:05:27,843 --> 01:05:32,143
A nuclear nonproliferation treaty should ease tension in Asia.

995
01:05:32,214 --> 01:05:34,648
Well, that's my thought.

996
01:05:34,717 --> 01:05:37,151
- Are you okay? With your...
- Oh, yes.

997
01:05:37,219 --> 01:05:40,347
These glasses don't make me dizzy or anything.

998
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:42,990
Elucidate on that.

999
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:48,460
Well, you seem to know a lot about
North Korea and the Middle East.

1000
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:50,395
It sounds like you really read the paper.

1001
01:05:50,466 --> 01:05:54,732
Oh, all the time.
I am just nuts about the paper.

1002
01:05:54,803 --> 01:05:58,830
So, have you given any thought to who you might be voting for?

1003
01:05:58,907 --> 01:06:00,670
I'm not sure yet.

1004
01:06:01,644 --> 01:06:05,478
I definitely won't listen to what Simon says.

1005
01:06:05,547 --> 01:06:07,344
He is just so mean.

1006
01:06:07,416 --> 01:06:10,544
I usually always agree with Paula and Randy.

1007
01:06:12,955 --> 01:06:16,482
Oh, you meant the President of the United States.

1008
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,058
The United States of America.

1009
01:06:20,696 --> 01:06:22,926
U.S.A. For short.

1010
01:06:22,998 --> 01:06:27,401
Fifty states, if you include Hawaii.
Most people do. I'm definitely pro-Hawaii.

1011
01:06:27,469 --> 01:06:29,164
- Excuse me.
- Oh, thank God.

1012
01:06:29,238 --> 01:06:30,933
Can I get you anything else?

1013
01:06:31,006 --> 01:06:32,997
No, I think we're good, thanks.

1014
01:06:33,075 --> 01:06:36,772
Hey, I know where I know you from.

1015
01:06:36,845 --> 01:06:39,973
You were in Playboy. "Girls with GEDs," right?

1016
01:06:41,116 --> 01:06:42,606
Oh, heck, no!

1017
01:06:43,585 --> 01:06:44,643
No!

1018
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,689
Those girls are all boobs and no brains.

1019
01:06:47,756 --> 01:06:52,386
I'm too busy in a library, reading books with dust on them.

1020
01:06:52,461 --> 01:06:53,553
How...

1021
01:06:53,629 --> 01:06:55,824
Sorry. My mistake, then. Sorry.

1022
01:06:55,898 --> 01:06:57,092
No.

1023
01:06:57,466 --> 01:07:01,061
Playboy. God. Can you believe it?

1024
01:07:02,071 --> 01:07:05,131
I'm still hungry, even though we just ate.

1025
01:07:05,207 --> 01:07:08,176
Oh, my gosh, I can't believe I did that.

1026
01:07:09,411 --> 01:07:13,108
- Sorry, let me take care of that.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1027
01:07:13,182 --> 01:07:14,979
Are those index cards?

1028
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:17,883
No. Index... They're napkins.

1029
01:07:17,953 --> 01:07:21,013
They're not index cards with writing on them.

1030
01:07:21,824 --> 01:07:24,349
Let me get some more napkins.

1031
01:07:24,426 --> 01:07:26,917
That's okay, really. I think...

1032
01:07:32,201 --> 01:07:33,668
Sweet balls!

1033
01:07:36,271 --> 01:07:37,932
I can't believe that happened.

1034
01:07:38,006 --> 01:07:41,339
I'm sorry about all the gravity.

1035
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:43,139
Are you all right?

1036
01:07:50,953 --> 01:07:54,013
I'm sorry, Oliver.

1037
01:07:54,456 --> 01:07:55,787
I'm sorry.

1038
01:07:56,525 --> 01:07:58,288
I need to go.

1039
01:08:15,344 --> 01:08:17,835
Come on, Puffin, you've been in here for days.

1040
01:08:17,913 --> 01:08:21,110
Let's watch a movie, it'll make you feel better.

1041
01:08:21,717 --> 01:08:23,446
I don't get it.

1042
01:08:23,519 --> 01:08:25,987
Why would Shelley just leave?

1043
01:08:26,054 --> 01:08:28,386
It's for the best. She wasn't happy.

1044
01:08:28,457 --> 01:08:31,893
I used to hear her crying in her room late at night.

1045
01:08:32,828 --> 01:08:35,661
I think I'd like to be alone for a bit.

1046
01:08:39,902 --> 01:08:41,893
I could stay with you.

1047
01:08:42,404 --> 01:08:44,895
No, just bring me more ice cream.

1048
01:08:45,941 --> 01:08:47,704
Egg! Paprika!

1049
01:08:48,877 --> 01:08:52,005
Nutmeg! Who cares? Who cares?

1050
01:08:52,915 --> 01:08:55,440
What have I done to poor Shelley?

1051
01:08:57,853 --> 01:08:59,445
You're not gonna tell him, are you?

1052
01:08:59,521 --> 01:09:01,352
No. You can't.

1053
01:09:01,423 --> 01:09:05,382
I'm gonna be the next Miss November,
not that little blonde bitch.

1054
01:09:05,461 --> 01:09:09,522
You found my weakness, used it against me like kryptonite,

1055
01:09:09,598 --> 01:09:12,192
but that's never gonna happen again.

1056
01:09:13,168 --> 01:09:14,999
"Oh, Mr. Hefner..."

1057
01:09:16,638 --> 01:09:19,436
Guys, remember, we only need 30, okay?

1058
01:09:20,843 --> 01:09:22,310
First up,

1059
01:09:22,911 --> 01:09:24,105
Kristen Withers.

1060
01:09:24,179 --> 01:09:26,272
Pre-med, family in Greenwich.

1061
01:09:26,348 --> 01:09:27,815
- Yeah, so cute.
- I like.

1062
01:09:27,883 --> 01:09:29,475
Cute, cute. Totally.

1063
01:09:29,551 --> 01:09:30,609
- No doubt.
- Very cute.

1064
01:09:30,686 --> 01:09:32,210
- In.
- Guys...

1065
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:35,154
We just made our first pledge acceptance.

1066
01:09:38,093 --> 01:09:41,119
Okay, cool. All right. Next up, Jill Palmer.

1067
01:09:41,196 --> 01:09:45,530
Colorado, theater major...
Her father owns, like, half of Aspen.

1068
01:09:45,601 --> 01:09:46,863
- Yes.
- Yeah!

1069
01:09:55,043 --> 01:09:57,443
Why am I such a yummy dummy?

1070
01:09:57,513 --> 01:09:58,878
Next one.

1071
01:10:00,616 --> 01:10:04,450
Nancy Nagle. English major from Florida.

1072
01:10:05,287 --> 01:10:06,447
But she does drive a Porsche.

1073
01:10:06,522 --> 01:10:09,821
I just don't know about this one.
I kind of feel like we've created this image.

1074
01:10:09,892 --> 01:10:11,792
I just don't feel like she's gonna fit in.

1075
01:10:18,333 --> 01:10:21,700
I'm just saying, she should have spent
the Porsche money on a nose job.

1076
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:24,295
She said she broke it in a skiing accident
last year, and I'm like,

1077
01:10:24,373 --> 01:10:28,002
"Okay, I'm sure the nose surgeon would
take the Porsche as a trade-in."

1078
01:10:28,076 --> 01:10:29,600
Booya! Snap!

1079
01:10:35,617 --> 01:10:36,641
Hello?

1080
01:10:36,718 --> 01:10:38,618
Hey, Shelley, it's me.

1081
01:10:38,687 --> 01:10:40,587
- Hef?
- Yeah.

1082
01:10:40,656 --> 01:10:43,784
Hef? Oh, is this you? Oh, my gosh.

1083
01:10:43,859 --> 01:10:46,726
How are you?
Like, I can't believe you're calling me.

1084
01:10:46,795 --> 01:10:49,958
How is everybody at the Mansion?
How are things?

1085
01:10:50,032 --> 01:10:53,433
Good news. I'm gonna make you next month's centerfold.

1086
01:10:53,502 --> 01:10:55,299
You're making me Miss November?

1087
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:57,531
- That's right.
- Oh, my gosh.

1088
01:10:57,606 --> 01:11:00,302
Are you totally serious, or is this not Hef?

1089
01:11:00,375 --> 01:11:03,071
If this is Hef, blink once.
If it isn't Hef, blink twice.

1090
01:11:03,145 --> 01:11:04,635
Did you blink?

1091
01:11:05,747 --> 01:11:08,648
I'm so glad you haven't changed, Shelley.

1092
01:11:08,717 --> 01:11:10,878
And I want you to move back to the Mansion.

1093
01:11:10,953 --> 01:11:13,717
It's just not the same without you here.

1094
01:11:14,656 --> 01:11:17,216
Hef, I just can't believe it.

1095
01:11:17,292 --> 01:11:18,350
Believe it, baby.

1096
01:11:18,427 --> 01:11:20,327
Okay, here's what happens.

1097
01:11:20,395 --> 01:11:23,831
We shoot the pictorial, we'll have you do
a 25-city tour of the United States.

1098
01:11:23,899 --> 01:11:28,033
And then from there we're gonna travel Europe,
ending with a one-week stay in Monaco.

1099
01:11:28,103 --> 01:11:32,789
We're gonna coordinate your pictorial with a Playboy
Channel documentary on the life of a centerfold.

1100
01:11:32,874 --> 01:11:35,707
The exposure's going to be wonderful, but it doesn't stop there.

1101
01:11:35,777 --> 01:11:38,177
We're going to pull out all the stops for this one, Shelley.

1102
01:11:38,246 --> 01:11:39,679
It's going to be huge.

1103
01:11:39,748 --> 01:11:41,181
Hef?

1104
01:11:41,249 --> 01:11:42,739
Yeah, baby?

1105
01:11:44,386 --> 01:11:46,684
Hef, I'm so sorry.

1106
01:11:46,755 --> 01:11:49,223
I'm so happy that you called me.

1107
01:11:50,292 --> 01:11:52,351
And I love you, but I don't think I can do it.

1108
01:11:52,427 --> 01:11:54,486
I can't leave my Zeta girls.

1109
01:11:54,563 --> 01:11:55,825
What?

1110
01:11:56,598 --> 01:11:58,566
I'm not going anywhere.

1111
01:12:00,636 --> 01:12:02,035
I'm home.

1112
01:12:05,874 --> 01:12:08,104
Katootoo Jihiman.

1113
01:12:08,877 --> 01:12:11,869
Sociology major from India. Everyone?

1114
01:12:11,947 --> 01:12:14,177
I remember this one.
She seems kind of weird.

1115
01:12:14,249 --> 01:12:15,375
I actually got that, too.

1116
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:19,710
Not like an "I live in the wall and eat crickets"
kind of weird, but just like a little off.

1117
01:12:19,788 --> 01:12:22,188
- Boo to Katootoo.
- Next.

1118
01:12:23,425 --> 01:12:25,985
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1119
01:12:26,928 --> 01:12:27,952
Lilly?

1120
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:29,793
Look at you people!

1121
01:12:29,865 --> 01:12:32,732
Honestly, is this really what you've become?

1122
01:12:32,801 --> 01:12:36,362
Judging other girls on their appearance?
Calling them weird?

1123
01:12:36,438 --> 01:12:41,134
I'm sure glad I joined when I did, because honestly,
I don't think I would make the cut these days.

1124
01:12:41,209 --> 01:12:43,177
And neither would a lot of you.

1125
01:12:43,245 --> 01:12:47,204
I can't believe that Zeta's become just like Phi lota Mu.

1126
01:12:47,282 --> 01:12:49,512
A bunch of snooty bitches!

1127
01:12:51,153 --> 01:12:52,848
Lilly, you talked.

1128
01:12:53,422 --> 01:12:55,151
And you're British?

1129
01:13:09,337 --> 01:13:11,430
Hi, everybody. I'm home.

1130
01:13:12,874 --> 01:13:14,569
This is all your fault.

1131
01:13:14,643 --> 01:13:16,668
Yeah. You know what, Mona? You're right.

1132
01:13:16,745 --> 01:13:20,044
It all started with this fake hair and your stupid water bras.

1133
01:13:20,115 --> 01:13:22,606
You know what?
Before you got here, we were individuals.

1134
01:13:22,684 --> 01:13:24,811
You've turned us all into stupid bimbos.

1135
01:13:24,886 --> 01:13:26,854
- We were fine the way we were.
- We look ridiculous.

1136
01:13:26,922 --> 01:13:28,947
- I'm getting Cs in all my classes.
- Why am I looking like this?

1137
01:13:29,024 --> 01:13:31,254
- This isn't who I am.
- I can't believe you let me do this to myself.

1138
01:13:31,326 --> 01:13:33,794
Guys, stop. Come on, stop, stop.

1139
01:13:33,862 --> 01:13:34,954
Guys.

1140
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,364
I understand, and I'm sorry.

1141
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:43,728
So I...

1142
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,831
Thank you guys for everything.

1143
01:13:46,908 --> 01:13:50,867
I'm gonna go, and I really hope to see you guys in the future.

1144
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:53,542
Shelley.

1145
01:14:04,092 --> 01:14:05,821
Hi, Hef, it's Shelley.

1146
01:14:05,894 --> 01:14:08,158
I was just kidding, silly.

1147
01:14:08,230 --> 01:14:11,961
I can't wait to be back at the Mansion and be a centerfold.

1148
01:14:12,534 --> 01:14:15,128
This is the happiest day of my life.

1149
01:14:16,605 --> 01:14:17,833
Dear Oliver,

1150
01:14:17,906 --> 01:14:20,568
I'm so sorry I couldn't tell you this in person.

1151
01:14:20,642 --> 01:14:23,941
It was way too embarrassing to face you after everything.

1152
01:14:24,012 --> 01:14:27,641
I am leaving the Zeta house to fulfill my lifelong dream.

1153
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:33,219
And I know that what I've decided to do
won't make any sense to you at all,

1154
01:14:33,288 --> 01:14:39,333
but I have joined the Peace Corps, and I'm going off
to work in the mountains of a country called Peru.

1155
01:14:40,796 --> 01:14:43,526
I'm going to meet lots of interesting people.

1156
01:14:43,598 --> 01:14:45,930
I'm sure it'll be very hot where I'm going.

1157
01:14:46,001 --> 01:14:51,203
And even though it's going to be super-hot, I will be
bundled up in clothes, barely showing any flesh.

1158
01:14:51,773 --> 01:14:55,850
I only tell you that because I don't want you
to worry about me getting sunburned.

1159
01:14:57,646 --> 01:15:01,343
Hef told me what you did, and I don't
think it was very sisterly of you.

1160
01:15:01,416 --> 01:15:03,316
You are so vapid.

1161
01:15:04,386 --> 01:15:08,982
Actually, I'm ingenious and philanthropic,
and you're a backstabbing bitch.

1162
01:15:10,592 --> 01:15:13,083
- Nice, Shelley. That was awesome.
- Shelley!

1163
01:15:13,161 --> 01:15:16,289
I hope everybody at the old folks' home is doing great.

1164
01:15:16,364 --> 01:15:19,731
And as for the Zeta girls, I'm sure they're doing fine.

1165
01:15:19,801 --> 01:15:23,760
Oliver, I hope you think of me every once
in a while, and when you do,

1166
01:15:23,839 --> 01:15:25,773
I hope they are good thoughts.

1167
01:15:25,841 --> 01:15:26,899
Pooter!

1168
01:15:26,975 --> 01:15:28,636
Love, Shelley.

1169
01:15:29,811 --> 01:15:31,540
There you are.

1170
01:15:33,481 --> 01:15:37,178
So we'll be half Shelley and half who we really are.

1171
01:15:38,086 --> 01:15:40,179
Can we be 60% Shelley?

1172
01:15:40,255 --> 01:15:43,418
I mean, say what you want about her, but the girl had style.

1173
01:15:43,491 --> 01:15:46,289
- What?
- "She had style"?

1174
01:15:46,695 --> 01:15:50,187
She still does. I mean, she just wants
to be back at the Playboy Mansion.

1175
01:15:50,265 --> 01:15:52,699
Well, whatever we're gonna be, we need to figure out, you guys.

1176
01:15:52,767 --> 01:15:57,670
We still need 30 pledges by ctober 15th,
or we can just kiss it all goodbye.

1177
01:15:57,739 --> 01:16:00,731
Who wants to be a part of something real?
Zeta.

1178
01:16:00,809 --> 01:16:02,936
Hi. Zeta. Tell 29 of your friends.

1179
01:16:03,011 --> 01:16:09,113
Listen up, ladies! Zeta was founded on the tenets
of sisterhood, friendship and philanthropy.

1180
01:16:09,184 --> 01:16:10,276
Here you go.

1181
01:16:10,352 --> 01:16:13,583
Yeah, and since then, we've added some
pretty kick-ass parties to the list.

1182
01:16:13,655 --> 01:16:15,520
Yeah, but instead of judging and rejecting,

1183
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:18,616
we'll put all the pledges we get into a bowl,
and we'll draw 30 names out.

1184
01:16:18,693 --> 01:16:21,184
Natalie? What'd you do to your hair?

1185
01:16:21,263 --> 01:16:23,697
- I could change it back.
- Why?

1186
01:16:23,765 --> 01:16:25,289
Everyone gets haircuts.

1187
01:16:25,367 --> 01:16:27,892
People have lots of different styles all over the world.

1188
01:16:27,969 --> 01:16:31,996
In China, they usually tend to layer it, I've noticed.

1189
01:16:32,073 --> 01:16:35,167
This isn't China, though. So, I just...
You know, I could put it back to how it was.

1190
01:16:35,243 --> 01:16:37,871
Oh, no, no. Why, why, why? You look great.

1191
01:16:39,214 --> 01:16:41,011
- I do?
- Yeah.

1192
01:16:41,082 --> 01:16:43,448
Well, I mean, you looked great before, with the hair.

1193
01:16:43,518 --> 01:16:46,919
But, I mean, this feels more of you.

1194
01:16:46,988 --> 01:16:52,790
I mean, besides, it's not like I want you to be my
girlfriend just because of your hairstyle. So...

1195
01:16:52,861 --> 01:16:54,658
Your girlfriend?

1196
01:16:54,729 --> 01:16:57,823
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

1197
01:16:57,899 --> 01:16:58,991
It's kind of presumptuous.

1198
01:16:59,067 --> 01:17:02,036
It's like, "Hey, you wanna be my girlfriend? Sit next to me."

1199
01:17:02,103 --> 01:17:04,094
No, no.
I mean, you don't want to be my girlfriend.

1200
01:17:04,172 --> 01:17:07,403
You got guys falling from trees for you, and it's like...

1201
01:17:07,475 --> 01:17:10,239
Here I am, just a goofy dude.

1202
01:17:11,579 --> 01:17:13,069
"Goofy dude"?

1203
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:20,586
Colby, I want to be your girlfriend more
than an electron wants to attach to a proton.

1204
01:17:21,923 --> 01:17:24,323
- That much?
- Yeah.

1205
01:17:28,797 --> 01:17:29,923
Yeah?

1206
01:17:37,305 --> 01:17:38,932
What? What?

1207
01:17:39,007 --> 01:17:42,170
Did I mess that up?
Because I can do that so much better.

1208
01:17:42,510 --> 01:17:46,105
No, I was just thanking Shelley.

1209
01:17:46,514 --> 01:17:48,414
Oh. Thank you, Shelley.

1210
01:17:56,992 --> 01:17:59,460
Okay, guys. Close your eyes.

1211
01:18:04,833 --> 01:18:07,563
This is it. We're gonna keep the Zeta house.

1212
01:18:07,669 --> 01:18:10,968
- Oh, my gosh.
- Go, Zeta! Go, Zeta! Go, Zeta! Go, Zeta!

1213
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:12,267
Lilly, go mail the bids.

1214
01:18:20,615 --> 01:18:21,673
Hi.

1215
01:18:22,384 --> 01:18:23,942
Are you new on campus?

1216
01:18:24,052 --> 01:18:25,815
I don't think we've ever met.

1217
01:18:25,887 --> 01:18:27,980
I'm Cole. Cole Trickle.

1218
01:18:30,658 --> 01:18:33,422
Yes. Yes, I just transferred.

1219
01:18:34,596 --> 01:18:36,393
My name is Lilly.

1220
01:18:37,832 --> 01:18:39,163
- Hi.
- Hi.

1221
01:18:40,035 --> 01:18:44,600
That girl over there just dropped these on
the floor, and she's really into that guy.

1222
01:18:44,672 --> 01:18:47,004
- And I don't want to interrupt her.
- Okay.

1223
01:18:47,075 --> 01:18:49,236
- Can you mail these out for her?
- Sure thing.

1224
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:50,834
Thank you.

1225
01:18:50,912 --> 01:18:54,109
You should totally mail me your number sometime.

1226
01:18:54,182 --> 01:18:55,706
Okay.

1227
01:18:55,784 --> 01:18:58,685
Just give it to me. I have a great memory.

1228
01:18:59,254 --> 01:19:00,812
Where are my envelopes?

1229
01:19:00,889 --> 01:19:04,689
Oh, you dropped them, but I got it,
and they're gonna be mailed right out.

1230
01:19:04,759 --> 01:19:06,989
Oh, thank you so much.

1231
01:19:07,062 --> 01:19:11,226
- Okay, my number's 7-6...
- Anyways, it was great meeting you, Nelly.

1232
01:19:11,933 --> 01:19:14,265
Oh, but my name is Lilly, actually.

1233
01:19:14,335 --> 01:19:15,927
Yeah, whatever.

1234
01:19:16,938 --> 01:19:18,166
Bye.

1235
01:19:20,341 --> 01:19:22,206
Now can I see your pizzanties?

1236
01:19:22,277 --> 01:19:23,369
No.

1237
01:19:34,756 --> 01:19:36,053
I don't get it.

1238
01:19:36,124 --> 01:19:38,388
Why didn't anyone show up?

1239
01:19:39,894 --> 01:19:42,522
You guys, come here and look at this.

1240
01:19:47,435 --> 01:19:50,563
I'm Ashley. Come on in.
Nice to meet you guys.

1241
01:19:54,809 --> 01:19:57,073
You did send out the invitations, didn't you?

1242
01:19:57,145 --> 01:19:58,407
Yes.

1243
01:19:59,414 --> 01:20:00,972
But there was this boy there.

1244
01:20:01,049 --> 01:20:03,517
And I never talked to a boy before.
You know?

1245
01:20:03,585 --> 01:20:06,145
And he distracted me. Just for a minute.

1246
01:20:06,221 --> 01:20:08,553
And then I saw him talking to Ashley.

1247
01:20:08,623 --> 01:20:11,592
And they knew each other. I could tell
by the way that they talked, and...

1248
01:20:11,659 --> 01:20:12,887
And...

1249
01:20:14,996 --> 01:20:16,395
I'm sorry.

1250
01:20:28,376 --> 01:20:30,344
People, all right. That's enough. Let's go.

1251
01:20:30,411 --> 01:20:33,380
We're done. We're shooting Miss November,
not Miss December. Let's do this.

1252
01:20:33,448 --> 01:20:36,076
Give me the fog. Wind, let's go.
Music, let's go.

1253
01:20:36,151 --> 01:20:39,746
Let's shoot this. Miss November.
Immortality! Let's go!

1254
01:20:40,555 --> 01:20:43,285
All right, here we go. It's Shelley time.
Come on, Shelley, it's so hot.

1255
01:20:43,358 --> 01:20:45,986
Oh, yeah. Sexy.
Sell it, Shelley. Oh, my gosh.

1256
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:47,857
You're gorgeous, Shelley. So hot!

1257
01:20:47,929 --> 01:20:50,420
Come on, work it, Shelley!
Come on, let's see some...

1258
01:20:50,498 --> 01:20:51,522
Shelley?

1259
01:20:51,599 --> 01:20:54,363
Stop. Stop the fog, Dave.
Barry, hold the wind, please.

1260
01:20:54,435 --> 01:20:57,233
What's wrong, babe?
You okay? You sad? Sad monkey?

1261
01:20:57,305 --> 01:20:59,102
I don't think I'm your Miss November.

1262
01:20:59,174 --> 01:21:00,505
What?

1263
01:21:01,976 --> 01:21:03,409
I'm sorry.

1264
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:08,308
Shelley, wait. Shelley.
Shelley, come on. Shelley...

1265
01:21:08,383 --> 01:21:10,283
Is she serious?

1266
01:21:10,351 --> 01:21:12,342
Shelley! Shell-monkey!

1267
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:14,945
Should we take a shower and talk about it? Shelley!

1268
01:21:22,130 --> 01:21:23,597
Natalie?

1269
01:21:23,665 --> 01:21:26,759
Oh, my gosh. How did you find me?

1270
01:21:26,834 --> 01:21:30,031
Oh, just... A little bird told me.

1271
01:21:30,104 --> 01:21:31,662
What bird?

1272
01:21:31,739 --> 01:21:34,230
Marvin called us. I thought...

1273
01:21:34,309 --> 01:21:35,936
We didn't think you liked us anymore.

1274
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:39,446
Oh, my gosh, no. I've missed you so much.

1275
01:21:39,514 --> 01:21:41,982
Oh, hi, girls. Oh, my gosh.

1276
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:43,950
You guys look beautiful!

1277
01:21:44,018 --> 01:21:46,384
Oh, I've missed you guys so much.

1278
01:21:46,454 --> 01:21:48,285
You're the best housemother anyone's ever had.

1279
01:21:48,356 --> 01:21:50,551
I'm really sorry for what I said to you.

1280
01:21:50,625 --> 01:21:52,149
I know. We really miss you, Shelley.

1281
01:21:52,227 --> 01:21:53,558
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1282
01:21:53,661 --> 01:21:57,188
So, how'd the rest of rush go?
Did you guys get your pledges?

1283
01:21:57,265 --> 01:22:00,632
Zeta had a ton of people interested, don't get me wrong.
Thanks to you.

1284
01:22:00,702 --> 01:22:03,830
But nobody showed up because Ashley stole all of our bids.

1285
01:22:03,905 --> 01:22:06,567
No. So the house is gone?

1286
01:22:06,641 --> 01:22:10,740
They'll make it official today at the Panhellenic
Council meeting this afternoon.

1287
01:22:10,812 --> 01:22:12,609
So there's still a chance.

1288
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:13,704
Shelley, it's too late.

1289
01:22:13,781 --> 01:22:16,215
I mean, I don't think there's anything that we can do.

1290
01:22:16,284 --> 01:22:19,412
Natalie! Together we can do anything!

1291
01:22:20,688 --> 01:22:23,384
Today's meeting is tinged with sadness.

1292
01:22:23,891 --> 01:22:28,521
Unfortunately, not all of us will be returning next year.

1293
01:22:29,397 --> 01:22:34,425
Yes, that's true. So with that said,
that brings us to our last order of business.

1294
01:22:36,437 --> 01:22:37,768
Stop!

1295
01:22:37,839 --> 01:22:38,999
Oh, dear.

1296
01:22:39,073 --> 01:22:41,166
We're here to save our house.

1297
01:22:41,242 --> 01:22:44,871
I don't know how this big meeting stuff works, but I just...

1298
01:22:44,946 --> 01:22:46,470
Enough with the freak show.

1299
01:22:46,547 --> 01:22:50,449
What I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, is that...

1300
01:22:50,518 --> 01:22:52,509
Hold on! Wait.

1301
01:22:55,690 --> 01:22:57,749
I have something to say.

1302
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,800
Shelley, say something.

1303
01:23:07,869 --> 01:23:09,598
I'm allergic to erythromycin.

1304
01:23:09,671 --> 01:23:13,732
Oh, for God's sake, Dean Simmons.
Enough is enough. Do something.

1305
01:23:13,808 --> 01:23:17,972
Shelley? The council has come here
today to really finalize this, so...

1306
01:23:18,046 --> 01:23:22,540
No! No! This is germane to our predicament.

1307
01:23:22,617 --> 01:23:27,020
Oh, well, as long as it's germane.
Please continue.

1308
01:23:27,088 --> 01:23:29,079
Just give her a minute.

1309
01:23:30,958 --> 01:23:33,859
I'm allergic to erythromycin.

1310
01:23:35,196 --> 01:23:39,394
I took it once when I had a cold.
I was 16, and it gave me itching.

1311
01:23:40,134 --> 01:23:44,332
I mean, everything itched.
My legs, my arms, my earlobes.

1312
01:23:44,405 --> 01:23:47,568
And other stuff, too, but I can't say,
because I'm live on the air right now,

1313
01:23:47,642 --> 01:23:50,042
and you can't say "ass cheeks," right?

1314
01:23:50,111 --> 01:23:51,601
You just did.

1315
01:23:52,313 --> 01:23:55,111
But I said it kind of quietly, I think.

1316
01:23:57,151 --> 01:24:02,214
But besides the itching, the erythromycin also made my skin glow.

1317
01:24:03,191 --> 01:24:05,955
It gave me, like, this glowing tan.

1318
01:24:06,027 --> 01:24:08,860
And I suddenly felt like another person.

1319
01:24:09,497 --> 01:24:10,930
Different.

1320
01:24:11,666 --> 01:24:12,997
Better.

1321
01:24:13,735 --> 01:24:16,033
Prettier, I guess.

1322
01:24:16,104 --> 01:24:18,698
- What's your name?
- Michelle.

1323
01:24:19,474 --> 01:24:20,600
Michelle.

1324
01:24:20,708 --> 01:24:23,438
Michelle, do you know that feeling that I'm talking about?

1325
01:24:23,511 --> 01:24:27,050
Where you suddenly feel pretty and, next thing you know,
you feel better about yourself?

1326
01:24:27,482 --> 01:24:29,882
Well, that was what was happening to me.

1327
01:24:29,951 --> 01:24:33,216
My allergic reaction made me feel pretty,

1328
01:24:33,287 --> 01:24:40,057
and so I ignored all the bad side effects, because suddenly
people were talking to me and they were noticing me.

1329
01:24:40,128 --> 01:24:43,222
And even though I was itching like crazy,

1330
01:24:43,297 --> 01:24:46,095
it was worth it to feel accepted.

1331
01:24:47,068 --> 01:24:51,334
And so I couldn't wait to get a cold
so I could take my erythromycin.

1332
01:24:53,908 --> 01:24:58,709
But underneath that beautiful, glowing skin, I still had that cold.

1333
01:25:00,348 --> 01:25:02,816
Well, that's a meteor.

1334
01:25:03,851 --> 01:25:05,785
The word is "Metaphor."

1335
01:25:06,821 --> 01:25:08,982
Can you really be that dumb?

1336
01:25:09,757 --> 01:25:11,691
She's not dumb.

1337
01:25:12,427 --> 01:25:14,190
Thank you, Natalie.

1338
01:25:16,130 --> 01:25:19,327
And, Mrs. Hagstrom, I meant "Meteor."

1339
01:25:20,535 --> 01:25:24,062
It flashes by and burns bright, but then it disappears.

1340
01:25:25,106 --> 01:25:28,007
And that was what was happening to me.

1341
01:25:28,075 --> 01:25:30,509
The real me just disappeared.

1342
01:25:32,046 --> 01:25:34,037
Is anyone buying this?

1343
01:25:35,082 --> 01:25:37,448
I am not an expert speech-giver.

1344
01:25:38,853 --> 01:25:42,516
But I do know that one day, when your looks are gone,

1345
01:25:42,590 --> 01:25:46,185
if everything you have is based on looks,
well, then you've got nothing.

1346
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:49,491
You need your friends and your family by your side,

1347
01:25:49,564 --> 01:25:53,364
to love you for who you are, not what you look like.

1348
01:25:53,434 --> 01:25:57,200
At the Zeta house, our new motto is, "Be who you are."

1349
01:25:57,271 --> 01:25:59,205
Because we're a family.

1350
01:25:59,841 --> 01:26:03,641
We're a family that loves you on the inside.

1351
01:26:04,846 --> 01:26:10,045
So we need you to stand forward and be a part of that family.

1352
01:26:10,885 --> 01:26:15,481
We need 30 people right now to stand forward and pledge Zeta!

1353
01:26:15,556 --> 01:26:18,957
Hey, honey!
You had me at "itchy ass cheeks." I'm in.

1354
01:26:19,026 --> 01:26:20,994
Me too! Me too!

1355
01:26:21,062 --> 01:26:22,359
Me too!

1356
01:26:23,364 --> 01:26:24,922
- I'll be a Zeta!
- Me, too!

1357
01:26:24,999 --> 01:26:26,796
- Me, too.
- I'll pledge!

1358
01:26:26,868 --> 01:26:30,429
- Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11!
- Me, too!

1359
01:26:30,505 --> 01:26:33,372
- I'll pledge!
- Twelve! Thirteen! Come on, we need 30.

1360
01:26:33,441 --> 01:26:34,908
- I'll do it!
- Fourteen.

1361
01:26:34,976 --> 01:26:37,206
- Get your hand down.
- Fifteen. Sixteen.

1362
01:26:37,278 --> 01:26:40,247
Seventeen, 18, 19, 20.
Excellent! Twenty-one!

1363
01:26:40,314 --> 01:26:43,181
- Twenty-two. Twenty-three. Come on!
- I'll be in Zeta!

1364
01:26:43,251 --> 01:26:45,276
- Twenty-four, 25.
- Up here! Pick me!

1365
01:26:45,353 --> 01:26:47,480
Twenty-six, on top.
Thank you. Twenty-seven.

1366
01:26:47,555 --> 01:26:49,921
New pledger, right there.
Come on, two more!

1367
01:26:49,991 --> 01:26:51,583
Twenty-eight, 29!

1368
01:26:51,659 --> 01:26:53,889
One more. Just need one more.
Come on, everybody.

1369
01:26:53,961 --> 01:26:57,522
One more. One more. Get your hand up.
Come on! Be a Zeta.

1370
01:26:57,598 --> 01:26:58,895
Come on!

1371
01:26:58,966 --> 01:27:02,265
Come on! Come on, one more!
Just need one more Zeta.

1372
01:27:02,336 --> 01:27:04,361
One more, one more. Come on!

1373
01:27:04,438 --> 01:27:06,838
Pound the gavel!
Why are you dragging this out?

1374
01:27:06,908 --> 01:27:08,307
There's nobody else! It's over.

1375
01:27:08,376 --> 01:27:10,867
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha on you, Zetas.

1376
01:27:13,714 --> 01:27:15,113
Wait!

1377
01:27:16,150 --> 01:27:18,243
There's one more new Zeta!

1378
01:27:27,595 --> 01:27:29,062
No. Sorry.

1379
01:27:29,830 --> 01:27:33,231
Can't be a baby pledging a sorority.
You gotta be a student.

1380
01:27:33,301 --> 01:27:34,598
That's right!

1381
01:27:34,669 --> 01:27:37,763
Rules are rules. Oh, well. Bye-bye.

1382
01:27:37,838 --> 01:27:39,965
Time to pound that gavel.
Meeting adjourned.

1383
01:27:40,041 --> 01:27:42,874
Dunzo. Pound that gavel, Dean.

1384
01:27:42,944 --> 01:27:46,471
I'm really very sorry, girls.
I know how hard you've worked for this.

1385
01:27:46,547 --> 01:27:48,515
It hurts me to do this, but I...

1386
01:27:48,583 --> 01:27:51,848
Stop! I would like to pledge Zeta.

1387
01:27:52,453 --> 01:27:53,681
What?

1388
01:27:53,754 --> 01:27:56,245
I like everything that Shelley said.

1389
01:27:56,324 --> 01:27:58,383
Are you out of your mind?

1390
01:27:59,627 --> 01:28:04,087
And, God, do you know how sick to death I am of you?

1391
01:28:04,165 --> 01:28:06,224
Of Phi lota Mu?

1392
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,734
I've been in Phi lota Mu hell!

1393
01:28:08,803 --> 01:28:10,794
I want to be a Zeta.

1394
01:28:14,375 --> 01:28:15,603
No!

1395
01:28:21,682 --> 01:28:23,980
Okay, so Zetas keep their house.

1396
01:28:24,051 --> 01:28:25,746
Meeting adjourned.

1397
01:28:26,387 --> 01:28:29,379
Now, go study something.

1398
01:28:33,594 --> 01:28:35,528
What are we supposed to do now?

1399
01:28:35,596 --> 01:28:37,393
Let's start with this.

1400
01:28:45,973 --> 01:28:48,271
Oh, I love my weird home.

1401
01:28:48,342 --> 01:28:49,570
Things that I like!

1402
01:28:49,644 --> 01:28:52,340
Toman! Oh, I love you, ottoman.

1403
01:28:53,047 --> 01:28:55,572
- This house is so nice!
- I know.

1404
01:28:55,650 --> 01:28:57,675
I mean, so cool.

1405
01:28:57,752 --> 01:29:00,778
- Hey, do you want me to show you upstairs?
- Yes! Show me, show me, show me.

1406
01:29:00,855 --> 01:29:02,516
This is so great.

1407
01:29:02,590 --> 01:29:05,184
Everything worked out so perfectly.

1408
01:29:06,227 --> 01:29:08,787
Well, not perfectly.

1409
01:29:08,863 --> 01:29:13,891
I mean, I messed up things with Oliver because
I moved to Peru and left him a note.

1410
01:29:13,968 --> 01:29:16,766
Well, Shelley, you didn't really move to Peru.

1411
01:29:16,837 --> 01:29:19,067
I know that, but he doesn't.

1412
01:29:21,442 --> 01:29:22,807
Oliver.

1413
01:29:24,578 --> 01:29:29,277
I was literally just talking about you.
How did you know that I got back?

1414
01:29:30,284 --> 01:29:32,980
Let's just say a little bird told me.

1415
01:29:34,221 --> 01:29:36,655
I gotta meet this frickin' bird!

1416
01:29:37,925 --> 01:29:39,517
It's me, Shell.

1417
01:29:40,327 --> 01:29:43,262
I'm the bird. I called Oliver.

1418
01:29:45,399 --> 01:29:46,798
Thank you.

1419
01:29:47,401 --> 01:29:50,268
It's so great to have such nice friends.

1420
01:29:52,540 --> 01:29:56,499
And, Oliver, I have to admit, I never went to Peru.

1421
01:29:56,577 --> 01:29:58,841
- I know.
- Thank you.

1422
01:29:58,913 --> 01:30:00,505
You're welcome.

1423
01:30:01,148 --> 01:30:03,116
And I was in Playboy.

1424
01:30:03,184 --> 01:30:06,085
I know that, too. And I don't care.

1425
01:30:07,688 --> 01:30:09,986
I would like to try this again.

1426
01:30:10,057 --> 01:30:14,517
Except this time, no manhole covers or bubble gum.

1427
01:30:15,329 --> 01:30:18,560
You know, just see where this goes.

1428
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:20,294
Yes.

1429
01:30:21,168 --> 01:30:23,500
- I'd like that.
- Great.

1430
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:27,807
OLiver.

1431
01:30:27,875 --> 01:30:29,172
OLiver.

1432
01:30:30,010 --> 01:30:33,207
- I'm Shelley.
- Nice to meet you again, Shelley.

1433
01:30:34,548 --> 01:30:37,608
Dear Hef, everything worked out!

1434
01:30:37,685 --> 01:30:41,121
We got 30 new Zeta sisters, and the house was saved.

1435
01:30:42,723 --> 01:30:45,191
And Oliver and I started dating again.

1436
01:30:45,259 --> 01:30:48,160
Oliver is kind and sweet and when we kiss,

1437
01:30:48,229 --> 01:30:50,857
I see stars and he sees fireworks.

1438
01:30:50,931 --> 01:30:53,195
And he says that means that we're in love, and he's right!

1439
01:30:53,267 --> 01:30:57,740
Because otherwise, when we kiss we'd see stuff
like pencils and empty ketchup bottles.

1440
01:30:57,805 --> 01:31:03,469
Oh, and the Zetas decided to throw a big party in my honor,
and I felt just like that girl from the storybook.

1441
01:31:03,544 --> 01:31:05,375
You know the one. What's her name?

1442
01:31:05,446 --> 01:31:07,607
Oh, yeah. Cinderella.

1443
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:21,390
 Where my Zetas at? Where my Zetas at? 

1444
01:31:21,462 --> 01:31:23,760
 Where my, where my... Where my Zetas at? 

1445
01:31:23,831 --> 01:31:26,061
 Hands up now 

1446
01:31:26,133 --> 01:31:27,760
 Push it up now 

1447
01:31:28,969 --> 01:31:31,233
 I know what boys like 

1448
01:31:31,305 --> 01:31:33,500
 Cute smiles and heels high 

1449
01:31:33,574 --> 01:31:35,838
 I tempt the hello 

1450
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:38,071
 While I say bye-bye 

1451
01:31:38,145 --> 01:31:40,375
 I know they want me 

1452
01:31:40,481 --> 01:31:42,711
 They try to fake it 

1453
01:31:42,783 --> 01:31:45,047
 But they just end up 

1454
01:31:45,119 --> 01:31:47,110
 Intimidated! 

1455
01:31:50,257 --> 01:31:52,555
 It ain't that hard to see 

1456
01:31:52,626 --> 01:31:54,526
 I know you're feelin' me 

1457
01:31:54,595 --> 01:31:56,324
 I know what I want 

1458
01:31:56,397 --> 01:31:58,661
 If I think you'll give me 

1459
01:31:58,732 --> 01:32:00,859
 I might let you 

1460
01:32:00,935 --> 01:32:03,301
 Unconditionally, yeah 

1461
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:05,565
 I might let you 

1462
01:32:05,639 --> 01:32:07,834
 If you're on my level 

1463
01:32:07,908 --> 01:32:09,705
 I might let you 

1464
01:32:09,777 --> 01:32:12,473
 And, baby, if I think you're special 

1465
01:32:12,546 --> 01:32:14,537
 I might let you! 

1466
01:32:14,615 --> 01:32:16,776
 Where my Zetas at? Where my Zetas at? 

1467
01:32:16,851 --> 01:32:19,342
 Where my, where my... Where my Zetas at? 

1468
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:21,615
 That's what they want, want 

1469
01:32:21,689 --> 01:32:23,680
 That's what they want, want 

1470
01:32:23,757 --> 01:32:28,251
 Now every time I come up in the spot I'm with my Zetas 

1471
01:32:28,329 --> 01:32:32,629
 A peace sign to the fellas And reverse it for the hatas 

1472
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:34,930
 Slickity-slick Bam-boom-wow 

1473
01:32:35,002 --> 01:32:37,334
 Look at how hot my ladies are now 

1474
01:32:37,404 --> 01:32:39,599
 We ain't messin' with you fools 

1475
01:32:39,673 --> 01:32:42,198
 We ain't playin' with you clowns 

1476
01:32:42,276 --> 01:32:44,506
 Now this blonde babe is the one to thank 

1477
01:32:44,578 --> 01:32:46,910
 Helped us rise to the top of the social ranks 

1478
01:32:46,981 --> 01:32:49,074
 The lost little bunny changed us for the better 

1479
01:32:49,149 --> 01:32:51,617
 Now she's part of the Zeta family forever 

1480
01:32:51,685 --> 01:32:53,949
 Back, back... Back it on up 

1481
01:32:54,021 --> 01:32:56,353
 Back it a-back it a-back Back it on up 

1482
01:32:56,423 --> 01:32:58,653
 Back, back... Back it on up 

1483
01:32:58,726 --> 01:33:01,160
 Now I realize that 

1484
01:33:01,228 --> 01:33:03,526
 I know what boys like 

1485
01:33:03,597 --> 01:33:05,827
 I know what guys want 

1486
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:08,130

1487
01:33:08,235 --> 01:33:10,499
 I got what boys like

01:33:10,571 --> 01:33:12,698
 I know what boys like 

1489
01:33:12,773 --> 01:33:15,071

1490

01:33:17,344 --> 01:33:19,505
 I know what I want
