1
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,345
Robin .

2
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,779
Look at me, Robin.

3
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,225
Do you believe when I say I love you?

4
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,110
How long has this been going on?

5
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,781
24 years? 25?

6
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,307
I've always been there for you.

7
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,746
Always, in any situation.

8
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,108
To all your... choices, all your fears...

9
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,626
all that...

10
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,587
... enslavement here, anxieties, I was there.

11
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:18,108
All the irrational walkouts,

12
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,668
always when... shooting was
just about to start.

13
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,430
"Do me a favor, Al, get me out of this,
get me out of that".

14
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,830
"Get me out clean",

15
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,748
"without burning any bridges".

16
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,941
"Aaron needs me at home."

17
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,867
But Aaron is just an excuse.

18
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,369
Lousy choices.

19
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,866
That's your whole story, Robin.

20
00:01:42,378 --> 00:01:43,864
Lousy choices.

21
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:46,069
Lousy movies,

22
00:01:46,326 --> 00:01:49,143
lousy men, friends you couldn't trust.

23
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,307
Even  the one thing you can't choose,

24
00:01:51,387 --> 00:01:52,346
your mother

25
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,097
You made a lousy choice there, too.

26
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:57,895
You had it all, Robin.

27
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:01,820
Movie queen at 24.

28
00:02:02,607 --> 00:02:05,002
All them big studios came crawling.

29
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,522
Maybe I was too soft on you...

30
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:12,967
...like everyone says.

31
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,500
I don't know.

32
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,148
Maybe I really was.

33
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:24,001
But you were just a kid.

34
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,105
You were scared.

35
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,586
You made that choices,
you made them all on your own.

36
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,861
And you slammed all the open doors,

37
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,529
crushed all the dreams.

38
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,985
And now...

39
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,026
Now...

40
00:02:40,272 --> 00:02:41,536
And now what, Al?

41
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:44,588
Talk to me, what are they offering?

42
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:47,829
I've no idea that they offer,
I wish I knew.

43
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,190
They called this morning
and yelled at me for 20 minutes,

44
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:51,988
about how they're sick of us.

45
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,814
Said it was a "final offer",

46
00:02:54,547 --> 00:02:56,263
that this proposal won't be on a table again.

47
00:02:57,437 --> 00:02:59,830
A quotation: "That won't be on the table again."

48
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,449
And what do you think it is?

49
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:03,102
How on Earth would I know?

50
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,484
One thing I do know: they won't be back.

51
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,540
They never spoke to me that way, Robin.

52
00:03:10,746 --> 00:03:11,568
Ever.

53
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,430
Sorry of that, Mom.
I think you need to go now.

54
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,227
What happened ?

55
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,831
Airport security called. No pressure,
same as usual.

56
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,665
Aaron!

57
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:24,186
If [...] kite goes over property fence,

58
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:25,350
you know what' gonna happen.
- I know.

59
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,427
I know, I'm sorry,
it's not going to happen again.

60
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,544
<i>So what was that [air]?</i>

61
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,105
United 435 from Rochester?

62
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,385
Actually, no.

63
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,124
- What was it then?
- Um...

64
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,367
United... but not Rochester.

65
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,710
Let's see...

66
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,156
Wednesday, 6 p.m.

67
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,145
Fort Lauderdale?

68
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,619
I know, Minneapolis.

69
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,784
- That's not what matters.
- What matters then?

70
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,581
That the wind was blowing from the west,

71
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,598
There my lady feel like a Queen
over the runways...

72
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,066
...and that it looked like a match made in Heaven.

73
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:34,744
I thought that any minute
they were gonna unite.

74
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,785
Those colors!

75
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,220
That red,

76
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,500
that white

77
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,469
and the black clouds.

78
00:05:43,586 --> 00:05:44,705
So really powerful.

79
00:05:44,785 --> 00:05:46,059
OK, but guess what?

80
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,085
- It's not gonna happen anymore,
you know that, right?

81
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,429
- Why not, why do you care ?
- Because he's not gonna go there,
that's why it's not gonna happen.

82
00:05:52,823 --> 00:05:55,354
All right ? Because the next time
the line goes over the fence,

83
00:05:55,434 --> 00:05:57,052
we gonna have to pack
everything in the house

84
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,221
we gonna have to move to
a lousy neighborhood in the city,

85
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,550
where will be no sky for me to see, or kites.

86
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,304
I'd rather live in some lousy neighborhood
in the city than this shit.

87
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,424
Oh, that's not new.

88
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,525
You know, I saved you today.

89
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,026
You saved me? From what?

90
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,824
From Al's proposal.

91
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,919
What was he offering so sweetly?

92
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,867
Tell her, Mom.

93
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,744
- What did he offer?
- I DON'T know, I don't know.

94
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,879
Sci-Fi? Graphic novel?

95
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,421
Holocaust? I don't see WHY you won't
do a Holocaust flick?

96
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,345
Every B-grade actress that does Holocaust [...] something in.

97
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,022
You could play both sides.

98
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,220
What do you mean, both sides?

99
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,023
Well, look at you.

100
00:06:37,584 --> 00:06:39,722
Nazi and victim.

101
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,296
You're one-side purpose
for a Holocaust flick.

102
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,953
-You know what?
-What?

103
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:46,833
You could even play a collaborator
if they needed one.

104
00:06:46,913 --> 00:06:49,629
How many actresses have THAT
[...] talent these days?

105
00:07:26,427 --> 00:07:29,908
Yeah, I remember. I remember when you
first came to the studio.

106
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,190
I was a... young number-crutcher,

107
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,385
down the hall.

108
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:35,848
Everybody said: "Here she comes!"

109
00:07:35,928 --> 00:07:38,107
"She is beautiful, she is sexy,

110
00:07:38,187 --> 00:07:40,910
She's got brains, power and ability

111
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,206
modesty, wildness, fantasy."

112
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,550
And she's one of us, goddam'it, she's...

113
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,860
She's from Texas!"

114
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:56,269
She's not some-some... some actress
that comes from the middle of Australia

115
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,188
that grew up on some distant farm,

116
00:07:58,268 --> 00:08:00,984
that she rode a hundred miles
to get to closest movie

117
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,500
where the projector runs on bunker fuel!

118
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,589
I remember, standing in the hallway...

119
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,628
... watching you walk in.

120
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,626
And you were so beautiful.

121
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,865
You were  "Princess Bride" - Buttercup.

122
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,746
I imagined switching your face
for that of Grace Kelly's.

123
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,529
the "Rear Window" poster. That was a good idea.

124
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,152
You were the future, Robin.

125
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,340
You were the promise, the answer.

126
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,862
You were the whole package.

127
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,739
And now I'm...

128
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,822
...I'm in this situation.

129
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,786
Exactly what situation are you in, Jeff?

130
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,702
The situation of offering of the last contract
that you'll ever have.

131
00:08:48,881 --> 00:08:49,985
The last?

132
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,347
Already? I'm not even 45.

133
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,462
Things are changing quickly.

134
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,780
Very soon, this whole structure
we all love so much

135
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,139
... will be gone.

136
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,023
What [...] Miramount?

137
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,190
God forbid!

138
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,766
I mean the structure around the actor:

139
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,659
the agents, the managers,

140
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,304
all that [...] the trailer

141
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,150
the drugs, the Coke, the depression, the...

142
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,190
breakups, and lovers, and sexual kinks,

143
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,544
the broken contracts,

144
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,366
terrible legitimization of tasteless scripts,

145
00:09:21,446 --> 00:09:24,390
the post-failure blues, the skipping out on PR

146
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,222
begging for forgiveness.

147
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,332
All that... can be gone.

148
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:34,001
Get my drift ?

149
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,429
No, not really.

150
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,795
We at Miramount, want to...

151
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,712
...want to scan you.

152
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,790
All of you - your body, your face,
your... emotion,

153
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,550
your laughter, your tears,
your climaxing, your happiness,

154
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,614
your depressions, your... fears, longings.

155
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,656
We want to sample you, we
want to preserve you, we want...

156
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,390
...all this, this...

157
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,461
...this thing, this thing called...

158
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,062
"Robin Wright".

159
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,741
What will you do with this... thing ?

160
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,588
That you call Robin Wright?

161
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,896
Will do all the things that
your Robin Wright wouldn't do.

162
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,875
Like what ?

163
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,013
Like all the movies that you missed [...]

164
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:23,910
because of your LOUSY choices.

165
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,390
You gave in, you gave up, you fled, you quit,

166
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,949
God knows what you did!

167
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:29,544
And you did it the last minute,

168
00:10:29,624 --> 00:10:32,492
you clogged our productions
and you cost us MILLIONS!

169
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,821
How old are you?

170
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,530
What difference does it make how old I am,
if you're gonna create

171
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:46,660
me at any age at your computer! What difference
does it make to you if I am 16 or 60?

172
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,599
It doesn't.

173
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:51,468
I need Buttercup from "Princess Bride".

174
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,218
I need Jenny from "Forrest Gump."

175
00:10:54,298 --> 00:10:56,101
I need a... what was her name?

176
00:10:56,181 --> 00:10:57,992
from "A State Of Grace"?

177
00:10:58,072 --> 00:10:59,804
That's what I need, I don't need you.

178
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,747
I need you only for your... for your history.

179
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,764
A history paid with lousy choices
you just said so yourself.

180
00:11:06,844 --> 00:11:09,233
Yes. For the last 15 years, yes, sure.

181
00:11:09,313 --> 00:11:11,354
<i>[All your movies tanked, no-not one... ]</i>

182
00:11:11,645 --> 00:11:13,065
could keep it's head above water.

183
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,079
But I can save you, Robin.
I can save you.

184
00:11:17,805 --> 00:11:20,819
- From what?
- From yourself! From yourself!

185
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,305
You knew about this?

186
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,501
Knew about what?

187
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,537
about all this crap he's offering me?

188
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:34,542
Oh, he doesn't know anything, he still thinks
that cameras run on bunker fuel.

189
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,101
On what?

190
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,238
A bunker fuel, that's crude oil.

191
00:11:39,538 --> 00:11:41,659
Never mind. He is from the Stone Age.

192
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,142
Your career is almost over.

193
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,453
You fell off the Top-O

194
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,047
In the economy of scanned actors, um...

195
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,380
...you are not worth... 2 bucks.

196
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,543
We are at war, Robin.

197
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,716
Any actor who doesn't sign within
the next 6 months is dead. Gone.

198
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,990
Characters erased from the screen forever.

199
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,386
You'll be back on all fours,

200
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,093
begging me to sample you.

201
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,940
What is it that I have to do
to make that happen?

202
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:21,677
Nothing.

203
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,744
Just sign.

204
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,746
Half a day of scanning.

205
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,629
- That's it?
- That's it.

206
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,750
That and... you must agree to never act again.

207
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,500
Anywhere for all eternity.

208
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,789
What do you mean, "anywhere"?

209
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,910
No movies, no TV show,

210
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,710
no school plays, no French theater

211
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,019
in Western Australia?

212
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:45,906
"Anywhere" means Anywhere.

213
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,328
Robin Wright The Actress will live and breathe...

214
00:12:51,408 --> 00:12:53,781
within the walls of Miramount Studios.

215
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:57,626
<i>And this Robin Wright can take the money</i>

216
00:12:57,828 --> 00:13:00,550
and fly off to some island in Polynesia

217
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,189
to discover her true self.

218
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,230
Whadda you say?

219
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,283
You know, it's interesting. Um...

220
00:13:11,893 --> 00:13:13,714
We actresses used to talk about how we never

221
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,712
wanted to sleep with you for a part
in the movie, but

222
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:18,013
but you know what? Honestly, I think
I'd rather do that...

223
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:21,143
than be a fucking chip in your computer. [...]

224
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,305
So, thanks.

225
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,065
But, no thanks.

226
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,828
The offer is valid for 30 days.

227
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,171
After that, she's on her own.

228
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,269
[...], sweetie?

229
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,699
What's up?

230
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:21,429
I was tired, I guess.

231
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,241
You want to try and fly the Wright brothers' glider ?

232
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:28,987
No... she's not ready yet.

233
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,107
So maybe [...] the Cody's ?

234
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,945
I do not know.

235
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,459
I missed the 2 o'clock landing.

236
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,339
What's wrong?

237
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,008
- You look... you look sad.

238
00:14:53,452 --> 00:14:54,610
- Really?
-Yeah.

239
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,186
Why don't you fly one of Cody Bank's?

240
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,837
-Me?
-Yeah.

241
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,146
- I do not think so.
- You can do it.

242
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,099
Just the little one.

243
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,660
Come on.

244
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,820
You better try it for once, alone.

245
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,258
Gotta see what it feels like.

246
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,549
I'll be there and watch you on,

247
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,811
so it does not go with the fence.

248
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,661
Don’t want to get kicked out of this place, do we?

249
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,459
<i>Sarah, [get it]</i>

250
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,586
Me?

251
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,588
Did you ever see someone come to visit me here?

252
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,184
Like you hold it.

253
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,910
It's okay.

254
00:16:54,793 --> 00:16:55,910
You could call.

255
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,052
What good would that have done?
You haven't answer my calls

256
00:16:58,132 --> 00:16:59,503
since the meeting at the studio.

257
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:03,470
This is Steve. He'll draw up
your contract with the studio.

258
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,268
He's a scanning  contract genius.

259
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,955
Keanu Reeves, Michelle Williams - he
did that contracts.

260
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,028
<i>They are [hermetically] scanned.</i>

261
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:13,379
Nice to meet you.

262
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,939
Hi, kids!

263
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,787
- You want a drink, Al?
- Sure.

264
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,248
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

265
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,918
- It's a real glider.
- Yeah.

266
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,820
Thank you, this is... this is beautiful.

267
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,776
And who is this ?

268
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,590
This is Steve, a new lawyer I'm working with.

269
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,306
Scanning contract genius

270
00:17:49,386 --> 00:17:52,805
This is one hell of a warehouse
you guys have here.

271
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,663
Oh no, it's not a warehouse.

272
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,271
It's an old hangar for the DC-9s.

273
00:17:57,351 --> 00:17:58,907
It was built in like 1973.

274
00:17:58,987 --> 00:18:02,407
Wow! I mean, you could NEVER get
a 17 [...] permits

275
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:05,266
to do a residential conversion like this
these days, that's for sure.

276
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,062
Scanning genius, eh?

277
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,990
Well, I've happened to have seen
on the entertainment channel

278
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:15,259
studios that's turning the sample actors
into these tiny little computer creatures.

279
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,030
I mean,  it must change the way
contracting works, completely.

280
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,108
It's absolutely true, uh....

281
00:18:20,188 --> 00:18:22,125
- Sara.
- Yes, that's absolutely true, Sarah.

282
00:18:22,205 --> 00:18:24,604
is a completely different type of contracts,
it's a one-off sale.

283
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,528
Very tricky, lots of details and you have to be sharp.

284
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,806
'Cause it's not going back to fix it afterwards.
- Uh-huh.

285
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,915
What do you mean by "one-off sale" ?

286
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,189
Once they sample you, and you are in the computer
there is no way back.

287
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,779
So whatever was agreed before
the sampling - that's the way it is.

288
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,710
So you have to be really careful.

289
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,467
The studio owns the character.

290
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,987
- W-What character?
- One that used to be the actor.

291
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,922
"Used to be"?

292
00:18:45,002 --> 00:18:48,543
The minute the studio pays and scans,
the actor isn't an actor,

293
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,740
He's just a person, a nobody.

294
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,081
The actor he once was
is now on a character

295
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:55,237
in the studio's computer.

296
00:18:55,283 --> 00:18:56,380
The studio can do whatever they want.

297
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,389
Unless the lawyer puts a clause in,
saying that they can't some.

298
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,168
It's very tricky.

299
00:19:01,355 --> 00:19:02,309
Very tricky.

300
00:19:03,002 --> 00:19:05,087
It's a new field. We're on the cusp.

301
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,106
- So what happens to the actor?
- What actor?

302
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,868
The one that used to be the actor
is now this... computer creature.

303
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,219
He goes off to play golf somewhere.

304
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,002
And what if he does not like golf?

305
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:21,624
Well then he plays... with whatever.

306
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,629
Do you have a screen in this house?

307
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,901
Or is that too progressive for you, guys?

308
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,670
You know what, there's something else
I haven't told you.

309
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:36,781
- Oh yeah ? - Yeah.
- What is it ? What haven't you told me?

310
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:39,709
They will be in 15 minutes, so, get it out. What?

311
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,470
Oh my God...

312
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,098
You were with Maria, too.

313
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,741
Oh, say it, you piece of shit.

314
00:19:49,017 --> 00:19:50,112
Say you were with her, too.

315
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,183
I knew that, honey,
I knew it the whole time.

316
00:19:52,263 --> 00:19:53,949
Where that little slut seduces you out...

317
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,536
Oh my God, Max... Max! It makes me wanna vomit.

318
00:19:58,616 --> 00:20:01,338
- No, I wasn't with Maria.
- Oh, no? NO ?!

319
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,470
- Well, then who?
- I wasn't with anybody.

320
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,620
But...

321
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,743
I voted for Bush.

322
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,102
You voted for Bush?

323
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,177
I voted for Bush. You know what,
I voted for both Bushes,

324
00:20:22,257 --> 00:20:23,779
senior and junior,

325
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,320
four times!

326
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,346
Who are you?

327
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,491
Oh my God, who did I marry? Sweetie-sweetie...

328
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,668
That isn't Michelle.

329
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,384
That is Michelle!

330
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,106
No, I mean, obviously it's Michelle, but...

331
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,985
... you telling me she wasn't there
when they did this?

332
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:53,713
You really want to know ? She was in Paris when
they were making that crap on their computers.

333
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,855
I'm shocked.

334
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,069
I mean, it's... perfect.

335
00:20:59,252 --> 00:21:00,430
Perfect? No.

336
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,986
But it's not bad at all for the beginning
of the revolution.

337
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:05,939
Notice anything?

338
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:07,390
Look at that morons!

339
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,101
They've been trying to solve that bug for 3 years.

340
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,987
I do not find that funny at all.

341
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:15,304
Well, OK. Just wait till you see that wink
in the sex scenes. It will [...]

342
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,500
That's hilarious!

343
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:17,905
Yo, Mom!

344
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,021
You got to admit it's good stuff!

345
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,425
Do not be so harsh,

346
00:21:21,505 --> 00:21:23,832
technophobia never got human nature anywhere.

347
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,428
So, you're with them now, huh?

348
00:21:26,508 --> 00:21:27,722
Hmm, you switched sides?

349
00:21:27,881 --> 00:21:30,101
Oh, come on, Robin, drop that 'pocrisy.

350
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,309
It's not like anything has changed.

351
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,642
They came, they took,

352
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:35,948
they created a crappy romcom,

353
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,460
just like they've been doing since the 40s.

354
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,066
You think it'd be any better for her, or for you?

355
00:21:41,462 --> 00:21:43,386
She was stuck on the set for six weeks?

356
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,517
Like a dog?

357
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,154
- Kissing some actor with bad breath?
- Oh, let me see...

358
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,143
You don't have the problem with the fact
that they didn't ask her?

359
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,220
When did they ever ask you?

360
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,092
You've always been their puppet.

361
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,827
All of them - the producers, the directors,

362
00:21:59,907 --> 00:22:01,162
they told you what to do,

363
00:22:01,242 --> 00:22:03,190
they told you how to behave, how to act,

364
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,318
how to smile, how to love.

365
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,828
And they gave you the subtext

366
00:22:07,908 --> 00:22:11,303
for every... fucking... crappy line they [...] out.

367
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,349
And when you hit 35,

368
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,745
they told you how to look young.

369
00:22:14,825 --> 00:22:16,861
Because if you didn't do
what they wanted you to do,

370
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,949
shave off a couple of years for that
beautiful face of yours,

371
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:22,824
you would... cease to exist, for Christ's sake!

372
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,645
So... what's... the difference?

373
00:22:26,071 --> 00:22:27,550
The fucking choice?

374
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,702
Yes, the fucking choice!
Al, what are you talking about?

375
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,110
It is the gift of choice
that is being taken away!

376
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,783
I don't want somebody else deciding

377
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,742
when I can be, what I want to be,

378
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,260
I want to decide! That's MY choice!

379
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,350
To decide if I want to be a hooker,

380
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,263
if I want to be an opera singer,
if I want to play Keith Richards.

381
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,179
That's my choice - not theirs.

382
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,505
You delusional!

383
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,304
What kind of choice was it, when they
stressed you out?

384
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,146
Saying that if you didn't work for a year,

385
00:22:54,226 --> 00:22:56,827
you would cease to exist? That's a choice?

386
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,313
All the women

387
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,984
who were face-lifted to death,

388
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,464
they can't smile

389
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,707
or show pain or emotion,

390
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,980
that's a choice?

391
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,586
That's just staying on as their tools, don't you get it ?

392
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,503
We've been saved, by some miracle,

393
00:23:12,802 --> 00:23:15,064
through these fucking computer samples!

394
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,889
We've been SAVED!

395
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:21,510
<i>You're nuts if you don't take that deal!
I swear to you, you're a [raving mad]</i>

396
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,547
And everything they say about you is true!

397
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,133
About your terrible fucking choices! Wake up, Robin!

398
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,708
This is your key to freedom.

399
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,384
How is it going, my friend?

400
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,588
Everything seems good, Dr. Barker.

401
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,557
Any new sky monsters?

402
00:24:08,858 --> 00:24:12,830
- Um, yeah, I... Look, I have a real thing now -
the original Wright brothers.
- Oh wov.

403
00:24:13,048 --> 00:24:15,098
- That is, the glider?
- Uh-huh. - Wov.

404
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,389
That's December 17, 1903 ?

405
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:22,548
I- I built a replica. It's exactly like that, but...

406
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,990
15 feet wide. Yeah. She's about to make a debut.

407
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,901
Very good.

408
00:24:26,981 --> 00:24:28,430
You know, when I think about it, you must be

409
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,510
part of the Wright brothers. The third one.
- Yeah.

410
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,747
- Aaron Wright.
- Yeah.

411
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,630
I am the original Wright brother.

412
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,303
I build better than them, cause, you know...

413
00:24:35,383 --> 00:24:36,830
I build in a world of, um,

414
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,628
jet planes and spaceships.

415
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,776
It's totally different.

416
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,069
And, you know - don't forget they had no competition.
- Yeah.

417
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,710
Siren.

418
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,379
Silent.

419
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,945
Glam.

420
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,346
Love.

421
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,905
Kite.

422
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,580
Kite.

423
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,860
Hear.

424
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,220
Ear.

425
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,265
Car.

426
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,619
Far.

427
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,019
Remember, Aaron,

428
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,789
Just repeat the words.

429
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,504
Table.

430
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,900
Able.

431
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,620
Sky.

432
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,164
Sky.

433
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,780
Parade.

434
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,705
Afraid.

435
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,065
Shell.

436
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,225
Fell.

437
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,306
It got to be the sign of decline ?

438
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,542
Well, it's too early to say, but...

439
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,584
... it looks his [...] is deteriorating [...]
in terms of his hearing loss, yes.

440
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,227
Train.

441
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,266
Pain.

442
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,585
Crown.

443
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,300
Alone.

444
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,785
Storm.

445
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,580
Worm.

446
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,578
And in terms of the...

447
00:26:09,658 --> 00:26:11,423
ophthalmologist report, um...

448
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,944
oh, that is not terribly promising either.

449
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:18,425
It has definitely moved into the regnitis pigmentosa stage.

450
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,914
Is that, um... a long...

451
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,786
<i>... [Jonah] way of saying something horrific?</i>

452
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,903
No, that is a very long expression to say that...

453
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,942
...his visual fields are constricting.

454
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:34,190
Eventually, his night sight abilities
will decline dramatically,

455
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,652
and... there will be... total night blindness.

456
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,101
And then what?

457
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,860
Dr. Barker?

458
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,140
Yes, sir?

459
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:46,741
Could we please play the, um... volcano track again?

460
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,771
Volcano track?

461
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:50,910
Thank you.

462
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,025
Yes, sure.

463
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,786
And the other 50%?

464
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,426
Is Aaron at 50%?

465
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,642
- That is the mystery with this syndrome.
- Right.

466
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,301
You will never know until he is 30 or 35...

467
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,781
... if he will be completely blind.

468
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,821
Aaron has a BEAUTIFUL mind.

469
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,755
He is taking information in...

470
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,520
<i>and translating [in his own way], it is a gift.</i>

471
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,330
He hears "Throne" says "Alone",

472
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,946
but he is perfectly aware of what he is doing.

473
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,640
He'll imagine what movies will be like
in 50 years.

474
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,794
I think that is s-s-somewhat similar
to what Aaron is doing..

475
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,258
- In what way?
- In the way that...

476
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,990
Well, the movie guys will just have the electronic stimulae

477
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:51,940
that our brains translate according
to what is in our subconscious.

478
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,140
See, people will be given story data,

479
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,944
and they'll cast their mother or their girlfriend

480
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,990
as Marlene Dietrich or you..

481
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,866
All depending on what is in their particular... box.

482
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,459
This is exactly what Aaron is doing now.

483
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,925
He is a rare case,

484
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,948
and he is ahead of his time by...

485
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,903
...God knows how many decades.

486
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,224
What about you, my friend, how are you?

487
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,746
Okay.

488
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,020
Any new parts on the horizon?

489
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,185
I think so.

490
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,618
Whatever happens, let Steve do all the talking.

491
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,702
Robin Wright for Jeff Green.

492
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,663
Miss Wright, I did not recognize you.

493
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,069
What else is new?

494
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,464
You okay?

495
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,789
"No child abuse,

496
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:43,669
no sex, only love story,
betrayal, romantic comedy,

497
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,304
no retard,

498
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,830
truly handicapped,

499
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,259
no porn?

500
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,587
no Holocaust, no Nazis. "

501
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,094
You marked this up?

502
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,545
You better believe it.

503
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,691
What are you, some sort of
swastika freak or something?

504
00:29:55,771 --> 00:29:58,146
- No, it's not him, it's my kids.
- It's her kids.

505
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,216
<i>Your kids [is] Nazis and porn?</i>

506
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,034
Porn? At your age?

507
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,259
Nazis and Holocaust winning awards.

508
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,268
Awards for whom? For your computer artists?

509
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,293
Nice, yes, they are computer artists now,
not just technicians.

510
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:20,582
Look, this is just all... details,
it's tributes, minutia.

511
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,908
I'll agree to everything except
this, um... Sci-Fi bullshit.

512
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,783
No Sci-Fi, Jack.

513
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,629
Sci-Fi is a dumb genre, in our opinion.

514
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:32,030
She's never done Sci-Fi before,
and she's not going to do it now.

515
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,862
Well, if she had done one Sci-Fi, this contract
would be worth 6 times as much!

516
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,547
No Sci-Fi, no contract.

517
00:30:38,818 --> 00:30:39,790
Then, no contract.

518
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:43,823
Why? Why, Sci-Fi is fantasy.

519
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:47,269
You know how many people
read "Lord of Rings"?

520
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,710
1 thousandth, not a single per cent

521
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,470
of the people who went to see the movie,

522
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,860
read the book. And you want to know why?

523
00:30:55,165 --> 00:30:57,950
Because it is one hell of a complicated read,
that's why.

524
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,670
It's a nightmare. a [...]! It's-It's boring!

525
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,680
Did you read it before you made the movie?

526
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,824
Are you kidding?

527
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,664
But I saw the movie,

528
00:31:07,027 --> 00:31:08,668
and that's why we make movies.

529
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,350
- But that's not what I want to say.
- What do you want to say, Jeff?

530
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,700
That I want to make you young forever.

531
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,549
That's what we gonna do.

532
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,659
How old are you?

533
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:26,225
45? 48? 50?

534
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,265
44.

535
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,068
Sign the Sci-Fi and I guarantee

536
00:31:32,337 --> 00:31:35,508
that I'll make you 33... 34,

537
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,181
For ever young, I promise you.

538
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,430
For ever young.

539
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:41,980
33-34?

540
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,828
- Which sounds better? - 32.

541
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,146
Greedy. That's greedy.

542
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:49,059
34 and we'll seal the deal.

543
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:49,941
For life.

544
00:31:50,115 --> 00:31:51,591
You know, in some countries, life -

545
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:53,341
sentence means 20 years.

546
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:54,301
In what countries?

547
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:55,912
- Middle East.
- Middle East?

548
00:31:56,683 --> 00:31:59,450
They are fucking animals over there!
20 years for murder?

549
00:31:59,891 --> 00:32:00,669
20 years?

550
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:02,984
In 20 years...

551
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:06,103
...this technology will be as old
as the invention of the boomerang.

552
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,582
- 20 years.
- Okay, great.

553
00:32:14,211 --> 00:32:15,868
- Can we do it now?
- What?

554
00:32:16,298 --> 00:32:19,589
This thing that you need to do to me,
can we do it right this second?

555
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:21,383
[...] I do not want to wait another day,

556
00:32:21,463 --> 00:32:23,263
I want to do it now or never.

557
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,699
Robin Wright.

558
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,460
- Aren't you, um...?
- Yes, it's me.

559
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,259
- Chris... Christopher Ryne.
- Yes.

560
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:42,699
What are you doing here?

561
00:32:43,155 --> 00:32:44,004
I'm the scanner.

562
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,949
Come on, don't feel sorry.

563
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,406
The others guys are at home, doing nothing.

564
00:32:50,752 --> 00:32:54,344
You were such a great cinematographer,
for so many great movies.

565
00:32:54,424 --> 00:32:55,040
Thank you.

566
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:58,781
You know what - at least I get to work
with the actors, and... light.

567
00:32:59,128 --> 00:33:02,262
I'm lucky - to be able to meet you at work.

568
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,211
Just like the old times.

569
00:33:05,112 --> 00:33:05,890
And,

570
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,702
I also like that I get to tell you to...

571
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,414
... take off your beautiful dress.

572
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,315
A changing room down the hall
to your right.

573
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:19,144
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

574
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:46,222
Chris?

575
00:33:49,447 --> 00:33:50,304
Hello?

576
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,462
Anybody here?

577
00:33:51,736 --> 00:33:52,593
Yeah, I got you, Rob.

578
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:55,589
Just make yourself comfortable,
we'll start in a minute, OK?

579
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,263
I don't want to miss any of your...

580
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,548
...charming expressions here...

581
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,603
Princess.

582
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,539
Now, smile.

583
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,420
Wider.

584
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:24,790
You're happy

585
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,061
Happy

586
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,664
Now, laugh

587
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,425
Big laugh.

588
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,580
Gimme here your laugh.

589
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,341
Come on, give me a big laugh.

590
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,023
BIG laugh, yeah!

591
00:35:02,677 --> 00:35:04,109
Now, that laughter...

592
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,824
... slowly

593
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,670
slowly...

594
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,459
turns...

595
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,140
... to emptiness.

596
00:35:21,565 --> 00:35:22,944
...blankness...

597
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,983
... the sadness.

598
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,946
I can't, stop... stop.

599
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,109
Stop! Turn off the lights.

600
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,878
Chris, I got it.

601
00:35:48,697 --> 00:35:50,031
- Give me a minute.
- Okay.

602
00:35:55,346 --> 00:35:58,510
Robin, did I ever tell you
how I got into this business?

603
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,464
The agenting business?

604
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,036
I mean, the REAL story?

605
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,841
Of course, I never told you,
I was probably too embarrassed.

606
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,137
Can you believe, I've been in this business
since I was...

607
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:12,864
... 10 years old.

608
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,584
A 5th-grader.

609
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,880
An agent in the 5th grade.

610
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,147
Let me explain.

611
00:36:19,227 --> 00:36:22,263
We had this guy in our neighbourhood,
in Bronx.

612
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,826
Joey Fairy-Tail, they called him.

613
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,548
He was this, um...

614
00:36:27,182 --> 00:36:28,066
...you know...

615
00:36:28,404 --> 00:36:29,665
How should I put it...

616
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,312
He was born with the tail.

617
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,579
A REAL tail.

618
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,709
We're talkin', um... an inch.

619
00:36:37,952 --> 00:36:39,464
Maybe - maybe 2 inches.

620
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,242
Like a boxer dog.

621
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:45,505
And... from the minute it came out, in gym class,

622
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:49,112
he suffered the most horrible abuse.

623
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:53,706
I can't describe to you what this kid
went through, an 8 year old boy.

624
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,739
They would strip him down in the street

625
00:36:57,995 --> 00:37:00,347
singing songs to his tail.

626
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,590
The kids would stay outside his window and [...] yell:

627
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,150
"Hey Joey! , Gimme [...] your tail,

628
00:37:05,552 --> 00:37:07,187
"I want to stir my chocolate milk!"

629
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,542
So... one day

630
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,867
I go up to him, before school,

631
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,185
I had this idea.

632
00:37:15,891 --> 00:37:18,206
I say: "Listen, Joey."

633
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,030
"From now on,

634
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,695
anyone who wants to go on your tail, that's a buck".

635
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,662
And he looks at me and goes:

636
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,029
"Really, Al?"

637
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,668
And what am I supposed to say to that?

638
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,270
Tell them: "Al said so?"

639
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,749
I was a scrawny kid,

640
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,623
<i>much [stooped]</i>

641
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,384
a reject.

642
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,286
Not exactly the rugs-wrestler type.

643
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,829
So that night, I went to the Twin Towers.

644
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,301
I mean the Bronx Twin Towers:

645
00:37:49,463 --> 00:37:51,148
a Podlowsky brothers.

646
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:54,502
Remember Podlowsky? Started shaving at 10.

647
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:58,743
And at 13, they went dating
40-year old divorcees.

648
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,819
So I tell them about Joey Fairy-Tail,

649
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,709
and I offer them
50 cents for every kid

650
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,787
who wants to see his tail.

651
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,739
They take the tailships and manage the line,

652
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,935
and I do the booking and collect the fees!

653
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,640
That month, I made more dough

654
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,221
than my old man made as a shoemaker all year,

655
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,909
and I was 10 years old!

656
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:22,768
And from then on, the business took off.

657
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:27,304
By age 13, I was agenting for all the losers.

658
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:31,462
The cripples, the midgets and
the fire-eating hunchbacks of the Bronx.

659
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:34,882
Within two years, we were the
richest family on the block.

660
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:39,901
But...

661
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,889
When I was 15...

662
00:38:42,711 --> 00:38:43,621
...ahem...

663
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,407
the child protection got on my case

664
00:38:46,487 --> 00:38:49,180
for abusing handicapped kids.

665
00:38:49,635 --> 00:38:51,700
and I did three-months time.

666
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,426
And then,

667
00:38:55,665 --> 00:38:57,724
after many years I wound up in this town.

668
00:38:58,446 --> 00:39:00,045
It's all glits and glitter,

669
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,551
and I was ashamed of my past.

670
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,943
But deep inside,

671
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:11,099
I knew I had an advantage
over all the others:

672
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,716
the power to recognize a flaw,

673
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,665
a weakness,

674
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,785
a defect,

675
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:20,030
and to exploit it

676
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,489
for my needs as an agent.

677
00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:23,664
And...

678
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,219
And that's how I met you.

679
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,099
You were perfect for me.

680
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,507
As lovely as an angel,

681
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,909
and with the worst defect an actress can have.

682
00:39:40,274 --> 00:39:41,225
Fear.

683
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,463
Such fear!

684
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,784
Real terror.

685
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:54,424
A terror that stand in the way of every desire.

686
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:00,142
Panic attacks before every critical meeting.

687
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,665
Paralysis

688
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,950
at face with truly grip roles.

689
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,667
And I was there to help you.

690
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:16,950
I was the inner demon that lived off your fears
and made a living

691
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,868
off your weakness.

692
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:26,988
Then the kids came along,

693
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,579
and all of a sudden you stopped being scared.

694
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,827
You've never been so happy,

695
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,980
You just didn't want to work anymore,

696
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,783
you wanted to be with them.

697
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,825
I [...] felt so abandoned.

698
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,748
That's when I realized...

699
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,962
I'm not your agent, I just love you.

700
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,503
I was afraid you were going to leave me.

701
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,582
Then all of a sudden, in the space of a few weeks,

702
00:41:06,662 --> 00:41:09,901
Aaron's condition started going... downhill.

703
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,423
And my strength was rebuilt from your weakness.

704
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:21,389
Then Aaron goes further and further away...

705
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,502
...and we were left alone.

706
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,739
And now, you really can't leave...

707
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,822
...trapped inside that monster.

708
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:45,027
This is your last performance.

709
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,546
And I guess it should bigger save you,

710
00:41:52,124 --> 00:41:53,589
all your fears,

711
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,348
all your demons.

712
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,948
You didn't deserve that.

713
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,189
You don't deserve it.

714
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:35,304
20 YEARS LATER

715
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,849
Welcome to Abrahama, Ms. Wright.

716
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:11,859
Is this your first time with us?

717
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:14,909
It certainly is.

718
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:18,339
[...] You are expected at the Miramount Abrahama hotel,

719
00:44:18,419 --> 00:44:20,900
as a distinguished guest of the Futurist Congress.

720
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:29,553
That's a pretty good-looking car for it's age.

721
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:31,221
What year is it?

722
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,926
2013.

723
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:39,948
Just a reminder, Miss Wright.

724
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:47,340
Abrahama City is a restricted animated zone.

725
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,305
The only way to leave the animation zone

726
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:53,183
is when we meet again,

727
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:55,469
on your way out.

728
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:02,466
Your ampule.

729
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:43,219
In the age of the spiritual machines

730
00:46:43,408 --> 00:46:45,787
where the streets have no names.

731
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,426
The Earth is covered with rage and shame.

732
00:46:53,367 --> 00:46:55,826
Agent Robin is back again!

733
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:11,510
"Triple R"

734
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,908
"Rebel Robot Robin - Street Fighter."

735
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:16,950
Now - in the air!

736
00:47:58,202 --> 00:48:00,028
Good afternoon, Miss Wright.

737
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:03,063
Welcome to Miramount Hotel Abrahama.

738
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:42,183
The city of Abrahama

739
00:48:42,263 --> 00:48:43,776
and Miramount Nagasaki

740
00:48:43,856 --> 00:48:46,285
welcome you to the Futurist Congress.

741
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,821
We would like to remind you that Abrahama

742
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:52,182
is a fully restricted animated zone.

743
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,781
Agent Robin is back again!

744
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:08,220
"Triple R"

745
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:12,950
"Rebel Robot Robin - Street Fighter".

746
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:15,580
Now in the air!

747
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:30,464
Hi, Aaron.

748
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,462
So I see you've left your room.

749
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:35,420
You feeling better?

750
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:37,780
No, it means it's stopped raining,

751
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:40,869
so I can walk without being afraid
of slipping on wet leaves.

752
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:43,635
So, how does it look?

753
00:49:43,715 --> 00:49:46,915
Oh my God, I wish you could see me animated,
it's pretty sick.

754
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:51,503
It's like a genius designer [...] bad asset trip.

755
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:54,360
- How do you mean?
- Oh my God, I don't know. I look like...

756
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:57,910
... a combination between Cinderella on heroin

757
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:00,590
and an Egyptian Queen on a bad hair day.

758
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:01,546
Mom?

759
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:04,259
Did they recognize you, Mom?

760
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:06,984
I mean, the new film is out all over the year.

761
00:50:08,295 --> 00:50:10,188
No, nobody sees me.

762
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:15,307
I'm just an old lady to them.

763
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:18,547
Probably 'cause you're animated.

764
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:21,828
No, you never... recognize me anywhere.

765
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:24,464
Welcome to the Wright.

766
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:26,946
No one's recognized me for 30 years.

767
00:50:50,687 --> 00:50:53,417
Aaron, you know, I can barely hear you in this crowd.

768
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:55,710
I gonna go to my room for a while.

769
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:57,747
Check-in later, OK? I love you.

770
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:04,106
Robin Wright, um... personal guest
to the Miramount Classic.

771
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:07,507
Wright, Robin. You are the sixth one today.

772
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:09,785
The sixth what?

773
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:11,867
The sixth Robin Wright.

774
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:14,944
I guess they did not look as "Robin-ish" as you do.

775
00:51:15,652 --> 00:51:19,342
Anyway, Ralph will see you to your room,
Miss Wright.

776
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,587
Have a pleasant Congress.

777
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:32,186
The Animated Zone...

778
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:39,750
<i>Miss Wright</i>

779
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:41,787
<i>think that your new film, "Street Fighter",</i>

780
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:43,742
<i>reflects our lives in any way?</i>

781
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:46,224
Yeah, I do, I mean...

782
00:52:46,304 --> 00:52:48,430
You know, I find something new in this

783
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:50,550
character Agent Robin every time I do it

784
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:53,294
like now, in The Street Fighter's production,
you know that...

785
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:55,823
... the robots, they come from the [...],

786
00:52:55,903 --> 00:52:57,390
they're so much a part of our lives,

787
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:59,188
they... they are close to us.

788
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:03,901
Because people buy household robots and they...

789
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:06,515
... basically just suck,

790
00:53:07,223 --> 00:53:11,230
pull [...] out of them, and then they just
use them up, and... and they expire, and...

791
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:13,630
... the poor robots, you know, they used to have

792
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:15,912
Rehab centers for them, and now they just...

793
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:20,628
... they use them as scrap, it's so sad, and...

794
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,579
... I don’t know, people call "Triple R" Sci-Fi,
but I- I just say...

795
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:27,960
... it's documentary.

796
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:35,619
Room Service?

797
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,102
Hello? Can I have room service?

798
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:41,189
Yes, Miss Wright. How can I help you?

799
00:53:41,569 --> 00:53:44,829
I... the, um... the light went off here,
the power, everything's off.

800
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:49,428
Does that make sense, or...
or is this just in my mind?

801
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:51,985
Ultimately everything makes sense,

802
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:54,202
and everything is in our mind.

803
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:56,703
What would you like to order, Miss Wright?

804
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:00,070
A want a full breakfast, just 3 eggs, um...

805
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:03,866
and hash-browns and toast, please.

806
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:05,583
And to drink, Miss Wright?

807
00:54:05,663 --> 00:54:06,860
No, I'll skip the liquids.

808
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:07,866
All types of?

809
00:54:07,946 --> 00:54:09,755
Yes, all types. How long will that be?

810
00:54:09,928 --> 00:54:13,236
2 seconds. How would you like your eggs,
Miss Wright?

811
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:14,940
Over easy, but...

812
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:16,538
will the yolks be soft

813
00:54:16,618 --> 00:54:18,429
by the time they hit the 100th floor?

814
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,303
But of course, Miss Wright.

815
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:23,986
That's exactly why we at
Miramount Hotel Abrahama

816
00:54:24,066 --> 00:54:26,147
invented the supersonic elevator.

817
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:34,310
Ralph, it's dark in here or is it
just in my mind?

818
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:36,229
Everything is in our mind.

819
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:39,866
If you see the dark, then you chose the dark.

820
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:34,476
Oh my God, it's in the water!

821
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,555
it's in the fucking tap water!

822
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:40,047
Oh, my God.

823
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:49,345
Jeff!

824
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:52,461
Jeff Green, did you hear me?

825
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:55,383
Can you fucking hear me?

826
00:55:58,496 --> 00:55:59,133
Stop!

827
00:55:59,795 --> 00:56:02,906
STOP!! I'll sign! I'll sign.

828
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:07,704
Just stop fucking with my head!

829
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:12,589
Please, stop.

830
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:16,189
I'll sign.

831
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:32,986
If it be your will,

832
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:38,270
that I speak no more,

833
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:43,789
And my voice be still,

834
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:49,268
As it was before

835
00:56:51,438 --> 00:56:54,343
I will speak no more,

836
00:56:55,582 --> 00:56:59,948
I shall no pipe, none tune.

837
00:57:02,286 --> 00:57:05,382
I am spoken for...

838
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:08,664
If it be your will...

839
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:32,359
Are you Robin Wright?

840
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:36,555
Yes, at least I used to be.

841
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:38,139
Miramount Police!

842
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:42,511
You went too far. You know we are busy
making you a star.

843
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:45,510
Next time we'll shoot you. Fucking whore!

844
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,558
Arrest her. NOW!!

845
00:57:52,364 --> 00:57:55,628
Miss Wright, Mr. Green is expecting you at his office.

846
00:58:30,326 --> 00:58:32,108
So you're here too, huh?

847
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,508
You and I are the only ones who survived.

848
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:37,743
And who are all the rest?

849
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:39,909
Characters they invented.

850
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:45,343
What have you been doing all these years?

851
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:46,705
I was with UNICEF,

852
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:49,186
hanging out foods for the hungry kids of Africa.

853
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:50,027
And you?

854
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,653
Taking care of my son.

855
00:59:00,524 --> 00:59:06,270
Robin! Robin, Robin, Robin. Vow! Vow...

856
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:08,864
You look fantastic!  Un-animated, I mean.

857
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:11,065
Look who's left.

858
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:14,468
Just you and... what's his name,
sitting outside, um...?

859
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:17,629
That guy's one thing, he cost me a fortune,
but you -

860
00:59:17,709 --> 00:59:21,666
I paid 2 cents for your contract and
her you still are,

861
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:23,349
20 years later.

862
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:26,389
What you've been doing all these years?

863
00:59:27,657 --> 00:59:29,627
Feeding hungry children in Africa.

864
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:34,744
- There still is hungry kids there, huh?
- Well, not so many, thanks to you.

865
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:37,187
So... tell me about this congress, Jeff.

866
00:59:37,267 --> 00:59:39,620
Why is everyone so stressed out?

867
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:42,390
- Oh well, you will see in a while.
- What will I see?

868
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:44,981
You see, Robin,

869
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:48,543
that pretty soon this whole structure
will stop existing.

870
00:59:49,149 --> 00:59:50,332
Structure? What do you mean, Jeff?

871
00:59:50,412 --> 00:59:52,670
This, the Miramount Classic,
the Miramount Hotel?

872
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:56,000
No, no, no. Not Miramount Hotel. I mean,
this whole structure won't exist.

873
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:05,543
The script writer, who needs his antidepressants,

874
01:00:05,906 --> 01:00:08,728
The ex-Russian story-board artist
with the drinking problem,

875
01:00:09,646 --> 01:00:11,908
Animators always behind deadline,

876
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:16,108
And those idiots who fall in love
with their computer characters.

877
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:19,907
Special effects people, they can all
go to FUCK themselves!

878
01:00:22,877 --> 01:00:25,863
Movies are old news, Robin.

879
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:28,939
A remanent of the last millennium.

880
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:33,219
As you will very soon find out  upstairs,
in the Futurist Congress

881
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:37,025
Miramount Nagasaki is entering a new age.

882
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:41,469
We are in the era of free choice!

883
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:46,409
And what does that mean for
the extension of our contract?

884
01:00:47,331 --> 01:00:48,710
The contract is no big deal,

885
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:50,542
just a 20-year extension.

886
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:52,811
And one other little clause.

887
01:00:53,805 --> 01:00:55,940
What's in this "other little clause", Jeff?

888
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,498
That from now on...

889
01:00:59,297 --> 01:01:00,430
... they can drink you.

890
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:02,387
Or you can be eaten, like an omelette [...],

891
01:01:02,467 --> 01:01:03,705
or creme brulee.

892
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,696
You see, Robin - from now on, you're...

893
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:08,904
...a substance, that is all.

894
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:11,014
You're a chemical formula.

895
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:13,673
that Miramount-Nagasaki's

896
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,625
brilliant pharmaceutical department has cracked.

897
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:20,229
And people can - can drink you, in their milkshake,

898
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:23,104
and imagine you the way that they LIKE.

899
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,711
- Everything?
- Yes.

900
01:01:28,436 --> 01:01:30,660
"Everything", means everything.

901
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:33,550
Drama, Little Red Riding Hood,

902
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:36,060
extreme art-house, porn,

903
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:39,103
comedy, Sci-Fi, trash, zombies.

904
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:41,062
WHAT do you care?

905
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:43,446
Now tell me something, Robin:

906
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:47,427
when you fantasies alone, in bed, in the dark

907
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:49,906
do you pay him or her,

908
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:51,339
royalties?

909
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:01,424
You'll sign anyway, Robin.

910
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:02,950
Oh yeah? And why do you think so?

911
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:06,544
Because you might have sold your image
as an actress,

912
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:10,281
but the actress never left your soul.

913
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:14,153
You drove all this way just to be on stage

914
01:02:14,233 --> 01:02:16,125
for a single moment of fame.

915
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:18,630
To be seen, after all these years.

916
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:22,588
And you will sign for the same reason.

917
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:50,025
Ladies

918
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:52,070
and gentlemen.

919
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:57,263
LOOK AT US !!

920
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:03,446
For God's sake, look at us!!

921
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:07,661
Can you believe that a tiny mini-ampule

922
01:04:07,741 --> 01:04:11,505
manufactured at the Miramount-Nagasaki labs

923
01:04:11,717 --> 01:04:13,343
made THIS!!

924
01:04:13,617 --> 01:04:15,857
neo-God creation!

925
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:31,469
I'd say

926
01:04:31,711 --> 01:04:32,820
if you hear,

927
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:34,341
you're a believer.

928
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:47,982
<i> My friends, </ i></i>

929
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:49,650
I came here

930
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:51,345
to declare

931
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:55,904
that our great, great scientists

932
01:04:56,223 --> 01:04:58,739
at the Miramount-Nagasaki labs

933
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:00,748
have recently cracked

934
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:04,386
the chemical formula of FREE CHOICE!

935
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:15,223
I, Reeve Bobs,

936
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:19,150
President  of Miramount-Nagasaki, here declare

937
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:20,550
that as of tomorrow

938
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:23,026
that genius Free Choice formula

939
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:25,171
be out in the market accessible

940
01:05:25,418 --> 01:05:26,962
for each and every human being!

941
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:35,303
Now just imagine

942
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:38,025
a life with no frustration.

943
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:53,029
No jealousy.

944
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:56,579
No ego.

945
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:01,748
You have a dream?!

946
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:05,156
Be your dream, for God's sake!

947
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:15,716
Ladies and gentlemen,

948
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:19,384
It is a supreme honor for me

949
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:21,742
to invite to this stage

950
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:23,750
the everlasting symbol

951
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:27,068
of the Miramount-Nagasaki revolution

952
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:29,466
She used to be our finest actress

953
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:31,064
then she became

954
01:06:31,144 --> 01:06:33,910
the best ever DIGITAL actress

955
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,489
Agent Robin!

956
01:06:36,082 --> 01:06:38,346
And as of tomorrow

957
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:41,387
you can be her!

958
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:44,180
be her, be with her!!

959
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:45,839
ROBIN WRIGHT!!

960
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:03,585
Look at me.

961
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:06,782
They call me the "symbol".

962
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:10,223
I used to be an actress.

963
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:13,259
Then I was a pile of computer codes.

964
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:18,022
And now, as of tomorrow, you gonna be able
to drink me, you can become me,

965
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:20,467
by drinking a milkshake.

966
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:24,149
Wake up, people! Wake up!

967
01:07:24,747 --> 01:07:27,363
Behind every chemical compound you invent,

968
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:30,411
and use, there is a person built exactly like you.

969
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:31,943
From the same material,

970
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:33,517
the same loves,

971
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:35,144
the same dreams.

972
01:07:36,110 --> 01:07:37,305
Wake up!

973
01:07:39,426 --> 01:07:40,672
This is my son.

974
01:07:41,781 --> 01:07:43,301
He can barely hear, he is deaf.

975
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:47,429
And you could have been his hope, all of you.

976
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:49,620
Did you ever think

977
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,867
to direct your chemistry research

978
01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:53,523
to his problem?

979
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:56,480
Or to hundreds of millions of other children?

980
01:07:58,124 --> 01:07:59,140
Did you, ever?

981
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:03,728
I just want to remind you of one thing:

982
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:05,704
that if you think,

983
01:08:06,358 --> 01:08:09,144
that by releasing your chemistry,

984
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:10,385
to the world

985
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:13,065
you'll dictate, how we desire,

986
01:08:13,474 --> 01:08:14,649
what we desire...

987
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:18,386
I just want to tell you: by doing that,

988
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:21,270
you will be releasing your conscience as well,

989
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:23,905
and your conscience will devour you.

990
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:26,995
And you'll die of guilt.

991
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:29,542
You will die of guilt.

992
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:36,539
Look at me!

993
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:39,587
I am your prophet of doom!

994
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:51,619
FRIENDS!!

995
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:53,828
You've gone too far!

996
01:08:54,295 --> 01:08:55,541
Don't you get it?

997
01:08:57,390 --> 01:08:58,477
Just imagine!

998
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:01,510
Tomorrow when you leave Abrahama,

999
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:03,342
you will never know that you left!

1000
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:05,101
Because

1001
01:09:05,951 --> 01:09:07,506
from tomorrow on

1002
01:09:08,150 --> 01:09:10,356
Abrahama will no longer be

1003
01:09:10,436 --> 01:09:12,442
a Looney Tunes playground!

1004
01:09:13,246 --> 01:09:16,648
Abrahama is going to be our life!

1005
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:05,189
You should go back inside.

1006
01:10:24,248 --> 01:10:24,876
Robin!

1007
01:10:25,526 --> 01:10:26,852
It is Robin, right?

1008
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:30,156
Let's go. Now!

1009
01:10:39,711 --> 01:10:40,639
Breathe.

1010
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:50,748
Breath deeply, hold it as long as you can.

1011
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:54,660
Come on.

1012
01:10:55,569 --> 01:10:57,750
You need to get down below, I feel it coming.

1013
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:59,890
- Do you believe them?
- Of course I believe them!

1014
01:11:00,393 --> 01:11:02,744
We already trapped in our animated characters.

1015
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:27,534
Sarah!

1016
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:34,815
- I think I saw Sarah.
- You probably did.

1017
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:37,621
It just like her to be one of the rebels,
you should be very proud.

1018
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,692
How do you know who Sarah is? How do you know?!

1019
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:43,266
I know a lot more than you can imagine, Robin.

1020
01:11:59,317 --> 01:12:02,621
Okay, clear out! I got a badly injured woman here.

1021
01:12:03,656 --> 01:12:06,270
[...] woman with severe head injury, what's wrong with you, people?

1022
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:08,068
She has irreversible hallucinogenic poison,

1023
01:12:08,148 --> 01:12:09,208
now who is getting up their seat?

1024
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:11,907
I suggest we draw straws.

1025
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:15,620
- Who are you?
- I'm from management.

1026
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:20,861
- What management?
- Hotel management.

1027
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:22,759
Everyone here is a hotel management

1028
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:24,889
it's powerful important people.

1029
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:32,382
Sit.

1030
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:36,505
Stay with me.

1031
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:40,099
Robin, you must just stay with me,
this is very important.

1032
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:41,620
Listen to me.

1033
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:44,842
Don't sink, don't give up.

1034
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:47,508
Stay awake, please.

1035
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:50,232
I want to see my son.

1036
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,937
This is his first time alone in home.

1037
01:12:58,017 --> 01:12:59,746
As soon as we can, I'll connect you.

1038
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:02,703
Stay awake, please.

1039
01:13:03,943 --> 01:13:05,445
Robin! Tell me about Aaron.

1040
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:14,260
Are you Robin Wright?

1041
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:17,239
- Yes, why? - Miramount Police.

1042
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:18,580
Come on board.

1043
01:13:32,246 --> 01:13:34,825
Give her more oxygen, we need her alive!

1044
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:36,350
Why keep her alive

1045
01:13:36,430 --> 01:13:38,990
if you can manufacture a thousand of old pretties

1046
01:13:39,070 --> 01:13:40,710
like that whore!

1047
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:42,428
You fucking whore!

1048
01:13:43,129 --> 01:13:45,390
[...] what a stunning old lady she's turning into!

1049
01:13:45,470 --> 01:13:47,871
No surgery, nothing. She's a clean cut!

1050
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:49,830
You can't manufacture that!

1051
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:51,901
We need her, keep her alive.

1052
01:13:52,110 --> 01:13:54,224
- How far from the hospital?
- We're already there!

1053
01:14:02,369 --> 01:14:04,949
AAROOOON!!

1054
01:14:13,334 --> 01:14:14,244
Who are you?

1055
01:14:15,630 --> 01:14:16,293
Dylan.

1056
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:18,825
Dylan Truliner.

1057
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:22,143
- Do you work for them?
- I used to.

1058
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:24,104
Until this morning, when they...

1059
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:27,504
...declared the Futurist Congress revolution.

1060
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:32,424
I am the animator.

1061
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:35,190
We moved you on the computers for 20 years.

1062
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:44,944
Head of the Robin Wright department in Miramount.

1063
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:51,110
Your body,

1064
01:14:52,213 --> 01:14:53,856
your face, your smile,

1065
01:14:55,110 --> 01:14:56,430
your sadness...

1066
01:14:57,830 --> 01:15:00,633
That was my whole life for the past 20 years.

1067
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:03,221
Tell me more.

1068
01:15:05,427 --> 01:15:07,063
I was unemployed animator.

1069
01:15:07,143 --> 01:15:09,534
They put me in Robin Department
for the first film,

1070
01:15:11,023 --> 01:15:12,749
"Triple R Strike".

1071
01:15:14,249 --> 01:15:15,784
I was lost.

1072
01:15:16,190 --> 01:15:17,021
Why?

1073
01:15:18,152 --> 01:15:20,301
Because I had no clue who you were.

1074
01:15:21,348 --> 01:15:23,507
I've never seen your anything.

1075
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:26,340
I had to research you.

1076
01:15:26,983 --> 01:15:27,911
Obsessively.

1077
01:15:28,176 --> 01:15:29,783
What was he looking for?

1078
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:32,522
Where you came from, where you went.

1079
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:36,556
Texas, the all-American girl,
tight jeans and boots.

1080
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:39,140
After...

1081
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:40,984
a week, I came

1082
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:43,427
and pitched them the lasso idea, I had a little

1083
01:15:43,507 --> 01:15:46,099
illustration, drawn in pencil.

1084
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:54,870
The rebels! They've taken over management!

1085
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:57,030
- What management?
- Miramount-Nagasaki.

1086
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:58,630
They've taken over the management floor,

1087
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:00,456
and stopped the chemistry flow!

1088
01:16:00,536 --> 01:16:02,070
We gonna be real again!

1089
01:16:14,784 --> 01:16:16,648
How do I know if I'm dreaming?

1090
01:16:18,459 --> 01:16:19,959
Do you know what my dreams are?

1091
01:16:21,214 --> 01:16:21,832
Robin?

1092
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:28,171
Can you see my dream?

1093
01:16:31,292 --> 01:16:34,509
4 cockroaches playing poker
on your lap, it's a dream?

1094
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:35,846
Yes

1095
01:16:36,974 --> 01:16:37,884
but it's not mine.

1096
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:42,903
Did any of you...

1097
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:45,214
think about me that whole time?
About what I went through

1098
01:16:45,294 --> 01:16:46,540
<i> till after I sold myself</ i></i>

1099
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:49,743
Well, I was... obsessed with you for years.

1100
01:16:49,945 --> 01:16:52,670
- With her, not with me.
- For me, it's the same thing.

1101
01:16:53,550 --> 01:16:54,745
At some point,

1102
01:16:55,230 --> 01:16:57,141
I was... dried up.

1103
01:16:57,990 --> 01:17:00,143
I was afraid they'd take you away from me,

1104
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:01,944
give you to some...

1105
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:04,990
up-coming... young genius.

1106
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:09,573
I've been looking for you all over California.
I needed new...

1107
01:17:10,537 --> 01:17:11,421
Movements.

1108
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:13,064
A different sensuality,

1109
01:17:13,144 --> 01:17:15,068
things a woman gains...

1110
01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:16,393
with age.

1111
01:17:28,575 --> 01:17:31,742
Target on. Vicinity 0.3 miles. Over.

1112
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:38,312
Bomb hatch dysfunction. Over.

1113
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:40,513
Bomb hatch dysfunction. Over.

1114
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:47,661
Let me go now, man. I'll take care
of this situation.

1115
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:28,949
Where is everyone?

1116
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:30,633
They hallucinated themselves out,

1117
01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:32,666
to freedom!

1118
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:35,196
Where is Dylan?

1119
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:36,988
Oh, he went with the flow.

1120
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:44,148
Why am I the only one left?

1121
01:18:45,188 --> 01:18:46,948
Because you're fucked up again.

1122
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:49,187
What exactly was going through your mind
when you got on that stage?

1123
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:50,706
What do you mean?

1124
01:18:51,203 --> 01:18:53,200
You invited me, you said I was the symbol.

1125
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:55,348
Symbol? Symbol of what?

1126
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:58,460
The chemical revolution, Jeff, you said.

1127
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:00,697
You are not a symbol. You're nothing!

1128
01:19:01,614 --> 01:19:03,337
The symbol is what we created of you.

1129
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:07,277
Robin, look at yourself. Does that look
like a symbol?

1130
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:14,336
It was suicide what you did up there on stage

1131
01:19:15,270 --> 01:19:17,466
You left us no choice.

1132
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:55,185
How do you like it?

1133
01:19:58,169 --> 01:19:59,557
A bullet to the head.

1134
01:20:00,734 --> 01:20:01,397
One.

1135
01:20:02,386 --> 01:20:03,500
But quick.

1136
01:20:05,354 --> 01:20:08,305
Quick as possible, I just want to get out
of this hallucination.

1137
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:12,743
After all these years,

1138
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:15,511
it is time you knew that this is no hallucination.

1139
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:18,577
This is our lives.

1140
01:20:19,329 --> 01:20:20,089
Robin.

1141
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:43,779
The following case is particularly interesting.

1142
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:46,914
The patient, who some of you might know,
was an actress once.

1143
01:20:47,332 --> 01:20:48,619
I forget her name.

1144
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:52,303
She suffered severe hallucinogenic contamination

1145
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:54,143
During the Abrahama uprising.

1146
01:20:54,461 --> 01:20:56,697
[...] In 4 months now, she is being convinced that her life

1147
01:20:56,777 --> 01:20:59,141
everything she has experienced,

1148
01:20:59,630 --> 01:21:01,303
is all a hallucination.

1149
01:21:01,630 --> 01:21:02,759
It was so extreme,

1150
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:05,669
that the the rescue forces reached Abrahama,

1151
01:21:05,895 --> 01:21:07,211
she begged the chief fireman

1152
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:09,623
to put a bullet in her head.

1153
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:12,107
She's a lost case, hopeless.

1154
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:14,461
So much [...] that we've decided to freeze her.

1155
01:21:14,623 --> 01:21:19,427
With today's advancements of liquid nitrogen
can easily keep her frozen for 70 years.

1156
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:22,304
Bring it down.

1157
01:22:17,604 --> 01:22:18,364
Aaron?

1158
01:22:19,813 --> 01:22:20,573
Aaron?

1159
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:35,545
Aaron, you heard me!

1160
01:22:35,999 --> 01:22:37,316
You heard me calling you!

1161
01:22:37,544 --> 01:22:39,906
Yeah, Mom, I heard you. Of course I did.

1162
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:42,067
What's so weird about that?

1163
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:17,501
And now for the weather.

1164
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:19,520
The Weather Company apologizes

1165
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,702
for the lack of complete symmetry of the rainbows

1166
01:23:21,782 --> 01:23:24,076
for the past 2 days. On the other hand,

1167
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:26,134
symmetry contradicts art.

1168
01:23:39,552 --> 01:23:40,338
Robin...

1169
01:23:41,522 --> 01:23:44,508
You must release your mind from the thoughts.

1170
01:23:47,630 --> 01:23:49,223
I do not understand.

1171
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:50,780
What?

1172
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:54,628
I was first to wake up in the distant future.

1173
01:23:58,444 --> 01:24:01,220
It's like bringing a diver back from the bends.

1174
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:05,108
You have to start as far away as possible,

1175
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:07,745
with the things you know from childhood.

1176
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:12,259
This is the setup we chose for you.

1177
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:14,350
The early 1980s.

1178
01:24:16,830 --> 01:24:18,059
But now, Robin,

1179
01:24:19,462 --> 01:24:20,988
you have a visitor.

1180
01:24:21,365 --> 01:24:23,347
Do you feel ready for him?

1181
01:24:34,833 --> 01:24:36,143
What are you doing here?

1182
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:38,425
I waited for you.

1183
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:40,177
- For me?
- Yes.

1184
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:45,106
For the moment that you could be... thawed.

1185
01:24:45,396 --> 01:24:47,421
When medicine could advance enough

1186
01:24:47,501 --> 01:24:48,779
to fix you.

1187
01:24:49,905 --> 01:24:52,229
- You waited for me all those years?
- Yes.

1188
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:55,555
I was the last person to see you,

1189
01:24:55,935 --> 01:24:57,629
I had a responsibility.

1190
01:25:00,968 --> 01:25:02,583
They say Sarah's fine.

1191
01:25:03,955 --> 01:25:06,977
She was saved from the Abrahama revolt,
whatever that means.

1192
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:11,426
And now, they're looking for...

1193
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:13,146
my Aaron.

1194
01:25:19,807 --> 01:25:22,873
This is Aaron's original DNA listing.

1195
01:25:23,367 --> 01:25:25,350
I've been looking for him for a very long time.

1196
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:27,261
since I knew they were about to thaw you.
- And?

1197
01:25:30,590 --> 01:25:31,337
There is no sign.

1198
01:25:32,738 --> 01:25:33,763
No trace.

1199
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:37,156
I don't... think he is with us anymore.

1200
01:25:37,236 --> 01:25:39,689
What do you mean, "not with us?" What do you,
what you mean - in this world?

1201
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:41,902
Or that he's not alive, what are you saying?

1202
01:25:41,982 --> 01:25:43,869
What are you saying, he's... he's dead?

1203
01:25:43,949 --> 01:25:45,875
It's much more complicated, Robin.

1204
01:25:46,030 --> 01:25:48,005
The world... today

1205
01:25:48,085 --> 01:25:50,355
is unlike the world you came from.

1206
01:25:51,157 --> 01:25:53,824
To find Aaron, alive or not,

1207
01:25:54,442 --> 01:25:56,739
we have to go on a very long journey.

1208
01:25:58,590 --> 01:26:00,900
What do you think, there is a direction?
There is a clue?

1209
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:03,066
I hope so.

1210
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:07,013
But we have to start somewhere.

1211
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:10,909
I'm here to take you out into the Big City.

1212
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:49,882
No one told me for how long I've been frozen.

1213
01:26:52,470 --> 01:26:55,030
Could have been a year, could have been 20.

1214
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:01,699
Time is now a subjective matter.

1215
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:03,337
You decide in your mind,

1216
01:27:03,417 --> 01:27:05,064
when day breaks,

1217
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:06,487
or when the moon fades.

1218
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:13,176
After a while you probably lose the
numeric calendar, as we once knew it.

1219
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:30,978
New York is now a city of suspended gardens.

1220
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:35,233
They reach the sky, the wild colors they strike you [...],

1221
01:27:35,313 --> 01:27:37,343
and the people are so beautiful,

1222
01:27:37,423 --> 01:27:39,382
so young and radiant.

1223
01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:43,822
Exuding serenity in beauty and sexuality.

1224
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:48,749
There is no more ego.

1225
01:27:49,379 --> 01:27:51,467
Thanks to Chemistry we've been redeemed.

1226
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:53,310
There is no ego,

1227
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:55,470
no competition, no violence, no war,

1228
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:57,063
no strong or weak,

1229
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:58,787
or secrets.

1230
01:27:59,590 --> 01:28:00,687
Everyone is...

1231
01:28:02,030 --> 01:28:03,464
what they are.

1232
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:05,941
Everyone is what they want to be.

1233
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:09,304
And while they consume their new personality,

1234
01:28:09,510 --> 01:28:12,788
they spread in the air those
pheromones that your mind

1235
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:15,266
translates into an image.

1236
01:28:18,910 --> 01:28:21,868
There is no way I can imagine Aaron in this world.

1237
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:40,637
This street holds the wisdom of a millennium.

1238
01:28:40,871 --> 01:28:44,224
A year ago, when I was consuming
Greek mythology

1239
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:48,301
I woke up half-man, half-God.

1240
01:28:49,670 --> 01:28:51,790
I impregnated one of Zeus's daughters,

1241
01:28:51,870 --> 01:28:53,781
I- I burned an entire city

1242
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:57,102
and then I fucked this city, and then
I burned it and I punished it.

1243
01:28:57,310 --> 01:28:58,531
It's all about feelings.

1244
01:29:43,258 --> 01:29:44,602
Just make a choice

1245
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:48,665
and you feel whatever you want.

1246
01:29:50,150 --> 01:29:52,387
What do you choose, Robin?

1247
01:29:54,104 --> 01:29:55,067
Usher syndrome.

1248
01:29:58,806 --> 01:30:00,290
What level of Usher syndrome?

1249
01:30:00,370 --> 01:30:02,586
I think, it's Type 2,

1250
01:30:04,208 --> 01:30:05,198
Why do you need this?

1251
01:30:05,892 --> 01:30:07,827
- Are you researching someone?
- No.

1252
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:10,668
'I'm missing someone.

1253
01:31:00,716 --> 01:31:04,750
<i>May you build ladder to the star...</i>

1254
01:31:05,390 --> 01:31:07,825
<i>climb on every...</i>

1255
01:31:08,190 --> 01:31:10,181
<i>may you stay...</i>

1256
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:16,506
<i>...forever young.</i>

1257
01:31:20,630 --> 01:31:22,527
Somewhere, out there.

1258
01:31:23,628 --> 01:31:24,247
there is Sarah.

1259
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:27,444
She's a naturalist now.

1260
01:31:29,945 --> 01:31:31,482
No-no-no. Don't, don't.

1261
01:31:31,562 --> 01:31:33,181
Won't do you any good.

1262
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:35,557
You'll never be able to recognize where [...]

1263
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:37,624
Don't know who you are, anyway.

1264
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:40,259
Trust me,

1265
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:42,783
Robin, she is happy.

1266
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:45,805
This is one of the only people who still

1267
01:31:45,885 --> 01:31:48,420
brings children into the world.

1268
01:34:42,110 --> 01:34:44,641
What if I don't want to take part
in the chemical party?

1269
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:48,748
Then you'll realise very soon

1270
01:34:48,828 --> 01:34:50,020
that you can't.

1271
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:51,948
Because you won't be part of this world.

1272
01:34:52,350 --> 01:34:53,784
And where will I be?

1273
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:55,985
On the other side.

1274
01:34:56,350 --> 01:34:57,831
What's on the other side, Dylan?

1275
01:34:58,710 --> 01:34:59,298
Truth.

1276
01:35:00,830 --> 01:35:02,503
And who is on the other side?

1277
01:35:03,510 --> 01:35:05,547
Ones who did not pass over.

1278
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:07,757
who aren't taking part in the chemical party,

1279
01:35:07,837 --> 01:35:11,149
And of course, everyone who operates
the world, you see here.

1280
01:35:17,258 --> 01:35:18,345
Have you been there?

1281
01:35:18,990 --> 01:35:20,378
- No.
- Why not?

1282
01:35:20,950 --> 01:35:22,623
Because I don't know if you can get back.

1283
01:35:23,950 --> 01:35:25,782
It's like coming back from death.

1284
01:35:26,230 --> 01:35:28,870
Maybe some have, but... we'll never know.

1285
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:32,063
Then send me there, and I'll tell you
what it's like  on the other side.

1286
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:36,430
Do you have a way to send me there?

1287
01:35:41,445 --> 01:35:41,975
Yes.

1288
01:35:43,499 --> 01:35:45,650
- Is it at home - the substance?
- It's...

1289
01:35:46,103 --> 01:35:47,614
...not a chemical cocktail.

1290
01:35:48,405 --> 01:35:49,518
It's kind of a, a...

1291
01:35:50,710 --> 01:35:51,346
Wipeout.

1292
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:56,011
That deletes all the chemical influences
in a second.

1293
01:35:57,350 --> 01:36:00,866
And the truth... comes right out.

1294
01:36:03,070 --> 01:36:03,946
And where is it?

1295
01:36:15,526 --> 01:36:18,620
It's like the cyanide capsules the Nazis had,

1296
01:36:20,190 --> 01:36:21,589
in case of surrender.

1297
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:24,452
When I left the old world

1298
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:25,892
I took one.

1299
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:29,070
It was my compensation

1300
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:30,549
from Miramount-Nagasaki

1301
01:36:30,629 --> 01:36:33,081
that's what I asked them for after 20 years of work.

1302
01:36:33,664 --> 01:36:35,023
This little capsule.

1303
01:36:38,470 --> 01:36:39,505
I want it.

1304
01:36:43,710 --> 01:36:45,607
And if your son comes back, while you're gone?

1305
01:36:45,687 --> 01:36:48,350
And if he's there? What if he is
on the other side? That's more likely.

1306
01:36:49,030 --> 01:36:50,286
This is all I have left.

1307
01:36:50,878 --> 01:36:51,933
Robin, if you take it,

1308
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:53,784
you are leaving, you are leaving me.

1309
01:36:53,864 --> 01:36:54,997
You can't do that.

1310
01:36:56,005 --> 01:36:56,818
Not now.

1311
01:36:56,997 --> 01:36:58,390
Then come with me.

1312
01:36:58,670 --> 01:37:01,317
I can't, the capsule is strong enough
only for one person.

1313
01:37:04,270 --> 01:37:06,506
It's your choice, and I'll give you
anything you want.

1314
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:11,029
I love you.

1315
01:37:11,470 --> 01:37:13,630
Robin, I have always loved you.

1316
01:37:13,710 --> 01:37:15,428
I loved you for 20 years

1317
01:37:15,805 --> 01:37:18,509
when I did not even know you, and you
were my entire world.

1318
01:37:18,950 --> 01:37:20,702
And I loved you for 20 more years

1319
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:22,389
waiting every hour

1320
01:37:22,469 --> 01:37:24,263
of every day for you to come back.

1321
01:37:34,590 --> 01:37:36,200
Promise me you not gonna look at the real me.

1322
01:37:37,190 --> 01:37:39,223
Promise me you'll remember me this way.

1323
01:37:43,752 --> 01:37:44,635
I promise.

1324
01:37:47,470 --> 01:37:48,443
I love you.

1325
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:05,076
Are there any doctors left in this world?

1326
01:40:06,990 --> 01:40:08,344
Yes, there are.

1327
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:09,779
Where are they?

1328
01:40:12,070 --> 01:40:13,344
Up above.

1329
01:42:38,150 --> 01:42:38,946
Excuse me.

1330
01:42:42,110 --> 01:42:44,723
Can you tell me where I can find an ENT

1331
01:42:44,803 --> 01:42:46,820
physician named Dr. Barker?

1332
01:42:47,710 --> 01:42:48,541
Sure.

1333
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:50,582
His cabin will be at the end of the corridor.

1334
01:43:31,550 --> 01:43:34,349
- I knew you would never cross over
to the other side.
- Oh!

1335
01:43:35,430 --> 01:43:37,990
Do not be so impressed that I am still here.

1336
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:41,225
Being here, on this side of the truth,

1337
01:43:41,550 --> 01:43:43,188
is not so brave.

1338
01:44:02,670 --> 01:44:04,524
Nothing has really changed, has it?

1339
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:07,864
Once we just masked the truth with...

1340
01:44:08,230 --> 01:44:09,795
antidepressants, drugs

1341
01:44:09,875 --> 01:44:11,810
that, um... concealed, lied.

1342
01:44:12,525 --> 01:44:13,930
Now we reinvent the truth.

1343
01:44:14,841 --> 01:44:16,304
It's not such a big difference.

1344
01:44:17,070 --> 01:44:19,869
Drugs were just cut much, much better.

1345
01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:24,448
And is there... no choice?

1346
01:44:27,550 --> 01:44:29,297
The only choice is between

1347
01:44:29,377 --> 01:44:31,189
waiting for death here

1348
01:44:31,870 --> 01:44:34,263
in this filth of truth,

1349
01:44:34,670 --> 01:44:36,946
or hallucinating over there.

1350
01:44:39,390 --> 01:44:42,269
Maybe it's better over there, dreaming.

1351
01:44:46,670 --> 01:44:47,593
And Aaron?

1352
01:44:59,430 --> 01:45:01,660
<i>Aaron [awaited] here,</i>

1353
01:45:02,150 --> 01:45:03,709
all over the years.

1354
01:45:06,270 --> 01:45:08,588
For 19 years, he waited for you to come back.

1355
01:45:13,230 --> 01:45:15,824
His condition got worse and worse, and, um...

1356
01:45:17,150 --> 01:45:19,460
he was almost totally blind, by the end.

1357
01:45:20,190 --> 01:45:21,260
But he...

1358
01:45:21,654 --> 01:45:22,971
He did not cross over.

1359
01:45:25,230 --> 01:45:26,841
Even though I told him to.

1360
01:45:27,097 --> 01:45:31,017
<i>I begged him to, [knowing] that I wouldn't
be here forever [...] to take care of him.</i>

1361
01:45:35,790 --> 01:45:38,543
Six months ago, he crossed over

1362
01:45:40,270 --> 01:45:41,469
He is someone else now

1363
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:46,345
in the world of chemical fantasy,
over on the other side.

1364
01:45:50,778 --> 01:45:52,262
6 months it is?

1365
01:45:53,070 --> 01:45:54,947
Exactly 6 months ago.

1366
01:45:55,950 --> 01:45:57,702
He just broke down, Robin.

1367
01:45:58,510 --> 01:46:01,343
I think he thought that I was going to die and...

1368
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:04,245
He no longer believed that you would ever come back.

1369
01:46:20,990 --> 01:46:23,630
Basically there is no way to find Aaron.

1370
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:27,821
Here, he does not exist.

1371
01:46:28,750 --> 01:46:31,678
And on the other side, there is no way
of knowing who he is now.

1372
01:46:34,990 --> 01:46:36,742
But you can still go back there,

1373
01:46:36,950 --> 01:46:37,985
and that's something to.

1374
01:46:39,470 --> 01:46:41,014
That's better than waiting for death.

1375
01:46:46,750 --> 01:46:48,215
And on this other side...

1376
01:46:49,230 --> 01:46:50,789
Yeah, what about it?

1377
01:46:52,355 --> 01:46:54,193
Can I go back to where I came from?

1378
01:46:57,630 --> 01:47:00,907
There is no such thing as "the place
that you came from".

1379
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:04,508
You invented it.

1380
01:47:06,510 --> 01:47:08,590
You will go where your mind

1381
01:47:08,670 --> 01:47:10,444
and your chemistry will take you.

1382
01:47:11,510 --> 01:47:13,150
And after your experience of here, there

1383
01:47:13,230 --> 01:47:15,665
will be a place in your consciousness

1384
01:47:15,910 --> 01:47:17,222
completely different from any

1385
01:47:17,302 --> 01:47:18,378
you have been to before.

1386
01:47:21,510 --> 01:47:23,501
Your past is dead, Robin.

1387
01:47:32,550 --> 01:47:33,669
I'll fix you an ampule.

1388
01:47:34,552 --> 01:47:36,667
And then I will call the kite.

1389
01:48:09,630 --> 01:48:11,462
Do you know where you're going, Robin?

1390
01:48:14,430 --> 01:48:15,425
Yes, I know.
