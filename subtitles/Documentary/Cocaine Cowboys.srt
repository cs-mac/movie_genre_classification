1
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,575
They call them
the Cocaine Cowboys.

2
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,140
Yesterday they attacked
Dadeland Mall

3
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:28,051
and they executed two Latins males
in the Crown liquor store.

4
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,612
There was an exchange of fire bewteen the two groups.

5
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,487
The broken glass and liqour bottles flying.

6
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,685
The shooting continued out.

7
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,591
Two men,
murdered in a hail of gun fire.

8
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,755
Victims of the antidrug fight in Miami.

9
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,025
The one that escaped had a machine gun.

10
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,760
They have to stop this.

11
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,324
What are they going to do about it?

12
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:43,562
What can they going to do about it?

13
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,160
People from Florida wonder

14
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,900
where they will attack now
the Cocaine Cowboys.

15
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,956
My name is Jon Roberts.

16
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:46,590
I was born in New York and I got involved

17
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,634
with some Italian from New York

18
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,898
that they were part of a family of the mafia.

19
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:55,065
We open 4 or 5 night clubs
of great fame

20
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,371
and he/she went us very well.

21
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:01,069
February 17 1970

22
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,377
One day the police came.

23
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,814
Not we knew why they came.

24
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,749
They told us
that they found our partner

25
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,616
in the freeway of Long Island.

26
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,019
They had murdered it and he/she had

27
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,250
eleven bullet holes.

28
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,122
Who Io that happened knows.

29
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,059
The best thing that was happened
in that moment

30
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:19,326
it was to take away from that tangle.

31
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,562
So I moved here

32
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,695
and I began in the business of the cocaine.

33
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,641
JON ROBERTS
Trafficker of cocaine

34
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,979
It distributed cocaine for value
of more than 2000 million dollars

35
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,516
for the poster of Medellan.

36
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,481
The city in Miami was very calm

37
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,117
and it was a very pleasant place where to live.

38
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,956
Before 1956,

39
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,360
the shift at night of the police

40
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,955
he/she had a patrol one

41
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,830
to patrol an area
of the size of Rhode Island.

42
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,426
In that Miami was then, the south,

43
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:58,800
it was as Alabama.

44
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,862
Not there was money here.
Not there were buildings

45
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,601
and the center was lonely.

46
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,041
In Miami Beach had bigger people

47
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,976
the time passing in rockers

48
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,775
waiting to the death.

49
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,282
The life was very different here, then.

50
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,876
It is for this reason that Miami is exactly for you.

51
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,786
In the 60s and 70s Miami flourished

52
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,622
as vacation dstination.

53
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:22,991
To Sunshine.
To Sunshine.

54
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,792
To Sunshine. Channel 4 News.

55
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,401
Sun and amusement in the beach,
the palms.

56
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,871
Miami is a center of transport
important

57
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:41,175
and he/she has easy access with
all the modalities of transport.

58
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:44,683
At the end of the 70s,
South American immigrants' thousands

59
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,845
legal and illegal Ilegaron to Miami.

60
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,285
The Latin American influence

61
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:52,085
he/she gives an unique flavor to Miami.

62
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,887
Miami had settled down

63
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,518
as a place

64
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,564
where the Spanish-speakers
they could prosper.

65
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,098
Miami was always

66
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,599
a place half pirate,

67
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,603
ferociously independent,

68
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,640
where one never pled
for the law and the order.

69
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:08,867
As a virgin city.

70
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:17,878
I am a boy from Florida of the South.

71
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,885
Old one of the few ones born here.

72
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,921
I was devoted to the import.

73
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,289
MICKEY MUNDAY
Trafficker of drugs

74
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:31,257
It transported more than 38 tons
of cocaine of Colombia to EE UU

75
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,662
It digs deep

76
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,029
and you will see the traffickers of weapons,

77
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,362
to the smugglers of rum,

78
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,766
you will find the marijuana,

79
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,804
the Cuban immigrants,

80
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,168
and lastly, the cocaine.

81
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,265
There is always something entering to the city.

82
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,244
Florida of the South is the destination
of EE nearer UU

83
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,143
for the South American traffickers.

84
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,705
- It was very open, then.
- It was very open.

85
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,343
Kilometer after kilometer
of costs without patrolling,

86
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,751
where they can leave
the drug without being seen.

87
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,120
When Ilegué, in the 70s,

88
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,682
all entered drug in Florida.

89
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,227
The Antidrug Agency believes

90
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:06,425
that 95% of the marijuana
that it enters in EE UU,

91
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,364
he/she enters for Florida of the South.

92
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,369
My friend died in his deposit.

93
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:15,168
He/she had 900 kg of marijuana.

94
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,709
That made it was to go and to take off it.

95
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,108
Not he/she knew anybody in the business,

96
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:20,873
so I gave the half to somebody

97
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,073
and the other one to somebody more,

98
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,172
and Io divided with them.

99
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,080
If you won 10.000 dollars to the anus,

100
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,277
he/she went you very well.

101
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:27,614
If you won 20.000 dollars,

102
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:28,676
he/she went you better than well.

103
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,656
I won as 165.000 dollars.

104
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:35,888
It is as the salary of 8 years.

105
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:39,125
And I told myself: "This is very pretty,

106
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:42,224
he/she has to have something more. It was very easy."

107
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,962
You arrived with your boat Ileno,

108
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,367
you robbed in the jetty

109
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,996
and Io discharged. Nobody said anything.

110
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,268
Let us say that they didn't watch over the frontier.

111
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,832
To the present rhythm, according to

112
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,309
some economists,

113
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:56,405
the biggest industry
it could be soon the traffic of drugs.

114
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:57,540
You went out with your boat

115
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,313
and you found bales
of marijuana floating.

116
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:04,720
Let us say, the square traditional fish.

117
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,190
The Colombians realized

118
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,727
that they had a mine of gold,
and when they sent

119
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,695
all this marijuana, they also sent

120
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,128
some kilos of coca.

121
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,722
At the beginning it was a little...

122
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,290
Because it was very expensive.

123
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,858
They entered her in a valise...

124
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,130
And it was not noticed this way so much.

125
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,968
It was quoted extremely expensive.

126
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,441
By the middle of the 70, the experience
of the Antidrug Agency it was low.

127
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,308
The office didn't treat matters of cocaine.

128
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,042
Not we have a problem
in the national environment

129
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,950
given the great number
of people that consumes cocaine.

130
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,820
Yes it is a serious problem
for a certain minority.

131
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,415
I met a Cuban in Hialeah

132
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,484
that you Ilamaba Albert Sanpedro.

133
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,655
Most of the Cubans
Io got everything

134
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,028
of the Colombians because, obviously,

135
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,532
them Io controlled everything.

136
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:49,693
In the traffic of drugs,

137
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,634
the organizations
cubanoestadounidenses

138
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,763
they are allied with the Colombians.

139
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,570
The Colombians care the drug
and the Cubans distribute it.

140
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,110
Albert gave me 100 grams

141
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,907
and I had about four days.

142
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,244
Then I went and him Ilevaba the money.

143
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,840
Then he/she gave me other 100 grams

144
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,078
and I believe that he/she used to pay him/her near...

145
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,213
about 800 each 30 grams, there for the 70.

146
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,756
Not it was of great quality,

147
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,382
but many didn't know the difference.

148
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,051
They saw those big stones and they thought:

149
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,459
"This yes that is good" and my clients

150
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,794
they were not people
as people he/she imagined,

151
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:20,890
they were not people of the street.

152
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,025
If somebody had cocaine,

153
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,466
he/she had to be an airline pilot.

154
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,833
Real estate agents.

155
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:25,962
Grant a doctorate, lawyers.

156
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,097
He/she had doctors and lawyers.

157
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,267
Somebody that could pay it.

158
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,708
They were the weekend warriors.

159
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,142
During the week they didn't make anything,

160
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,077
but from Friday at night

161
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,512
until Sunday, they consumed.

162
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,346
And each one showed up to a friend.

163
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,318
And I passed this way of 120 grams

164
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,218
at 240, until the 500 grams,

165
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,416
and in one month he/she was selling

166
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,688
maybe 2, 3 kilos per week
to the doctors and their friends.

167
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,490
When Ilegué from New York,

168
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,793
he/she had 650 dollars in the pocket

169
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,060
and then it won 20.000,
30.000 dollars per week

170
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,897
in this business.

171
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,664
A friend from New York

172
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,673
it had developed
a great business in California,

173
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,208
in San Francisco's bay.

174
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,039
He/she sold Oakland Raiders,

175
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,238
he/she sold Grateful Dead.

176
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,804
He/she knew a stewardess that worked

177
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,349
for National Airlines.

178
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,248
So we sent the coca with the stewardess.

179
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,583
She went of here to San Francisco

180
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,452
and we sent to any place

181
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:20,117
from 5 to 10 kilos per week.
I won

182
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,456
a lot of money, was close

183
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:25,622
of the 200.000 to 300.000 dollars
and I began to know types--

184
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,030
Mercury Morris,
player of Dolphins,

185
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,125
who went to the jail,
so it is not secret.

186
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,760
Merc is a fallen angel

187
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,464
of the sport machine of Miami.

188
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,972
Former Dolphins, Don Reese

189
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,942
and Randy Crowder
they were also arrested

190
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,137
in a transaction of cocaine.

191
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,577
I remember the week of Super Bowl,

192
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,205
when Dallas faced here Pittsburgh.

193
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,273
Two nights before
he/she had to the regular leading

194
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,320
of Pittsburgh Steelers
sat down in my house.

195
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,378
"We go, we go,
damages the coca, damages the coca."

196
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,424
Not we have opportunity
of enjoying the festejos

197
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,289
and of the parties
because we have touches of it is.

198
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,488
They left to have a good time and Io made to big Io.

199
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:00,555
* We go, Steelers, we go *

200
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,033
Not they have idea of
with what these types were drugged.

201
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,831
"? Van to play this Sunday?"

202
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,270
"Yes, and we will win."

203
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,864
They played and they won,

204
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:09,908
it didn't affect them.

205
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,876
The offensive line
he/she made an excellent work.

206
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,174
The popularity began to grow,

207
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,737
and all those that before
they consumed marijuana,

208
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,283
now they consumed cocaine.

209
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,909
We continue with the marijuana

210
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,352
until Ilegó the moment
in that there was too much

211
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,787
and one could not sell.

212
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,121
But one was not able to
to get enough cocaine.

213
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,490
I looked like each other that the best way

214
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,358
it was to be devoted to transport it.

215
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,896
You don't buy it, you don't sell it,

216
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,127
you don't consume it, alone you care her.

217
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,897
The Colombians offered us a sum

218
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,063
with the one that we were
more than of agreement.

219
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,731
3000 dollars for piece,

220
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,331
or a kilo in your terms.

221
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,003
They wanted to move about 400 at least,

222
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,740
so we were and in the first trip,

223
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:53,183
they paid us 1,2 million dollars.

224
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,015
It was enough to get excited.

225
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,783
He/she hears, let us maybe stay
in the business a time.

226
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,116
People with which tried

227
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,718
he/she had limited supplies

228
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,221
and while, people to which sold him/her

229
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,266
it expanded their business.
I could no longer get enough.

230
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,131
A type requested me 15 kilos

231
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,193
or 20, or 25 kilos,

232
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,637
and alone he/she could give him/her 15 or 10,
and it was money

233
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,072
that it left my pocket.

234
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:19,634
He/she could sell 100 kilos
per week with easiness.

235
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:23,409
I was lucky.
I believe that in 1979

236
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,642
I met a girl.

237
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,015
I Flew to Miami

238
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,884
and I worked in a session
of pictures with a girl.

239
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:34,892
He/she told me that he/she wanted
that he/she knew somebody.

240
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,861
My friend hooked me with her,
he was a lawyer.

241
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,955
ÉI went out with a beautiful girl,

242
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,624
that it was model of Ford.

243
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:49,438
To the 3 months of knowing Jon
it was my birthday

244
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:52,102
and I entered to the garage and there was a new Porsche.

245
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,736
It Was a Porsche Targa Career.

246
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:59,376
He/she had a great monkey above,
a red monkey, on behalf of him.

247
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,046
Him ours was as a vortex.

248
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:07,320
We were very in love.
We were...

249
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,395
They counted me

250
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,365
that he/she had discos in Manhattan.

251
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,764
We begin to leave

252
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,030
and she saw that I won't work.

253
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,038
If he/she wanted to go to New York, there he/she went,

254
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,131
and she had curiosity.
I am a person

255
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,903
very direct, so you Io counted.

256
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,341
"I am devoted to this."

257
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,935
"If you don't want to see me more, it is well."

258
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,105
He/she told me that he/she had a friend

259
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,445
that he/she was a pilot
and that he/she worked for the Colombians.

260
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,781
The type shows up,
you Ilama Mickey Munday

261
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,684
and it is an uncultured type of Florida

262
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,120
that all its life lived here.

263
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,089
The type didn't please well.

264
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,455
The first time that Io saw, it managed

265
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,824
a black Mercedes of two doors.

266
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,090
It was very obvious that trafficked with drugs.

267
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,724
Mickey Munday transported
with a lot of success

268
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,768
For years for this people.

269
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,668
It was extravagant, he/she resembled somebody

270
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:55,400
with who I didn't want to involve me.

271
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,942
I say... ?Do they remind the series MacGyver?

272
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,272
ÉI is that type.

273
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,279
He/she made incredible things.

274
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,248
It was an astute type,
but I didn't like their cars.

275
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,908
For me, it was seen as all the other ones

276
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,009
of that business.

277
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,713
My business overcame that of the Cubans

278
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,052
and it was a necessity
to find a Colombian

279
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,818
that it could provide
the big quantities

280
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,689
that he/she needed.

281
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,489
He/she told me: I can connect you.

282
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,122
"You Ilevaré with the Colombians

283
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,393
"and they will give you Io that you want."

284
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,367
He/she had heard many histories of those,

285
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,903
so I told him/her
that me Ilevara when he/she wanted.

286
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,269
We went until Sunny Isles, Florida.

287
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,864
We enter in a house

288
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,172
where there were 5 or 6 Colombians,

289
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,677
and they were armed,

290
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,077
armed until the teeth.

291
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,808
They had guns, machine guns,

292
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,349
all stopped ones were

293
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,011
and there I realized that the type was serious.

294
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,144
They went seriously, because people

295
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,745
it is not stopped this way.

296
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,017
I knew to this type

297
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,217
that it doesn't measure more than 1,60 or 1,62 m.

298
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,284
He/she shows up and he/she says: "Me Ilamo Rafa.

299
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,885
"I can give you

300
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,261
"Io that you want, old. If you have money,

301
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,924
"I will advance you twice as much

302
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,661
"of Io that you have brought."

303
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,533
Then I request him/her
that it shows me a little.

304
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,573
Me Ileva to another room, presses on a button

305
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,301
and a wall opens up.

306
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,037
Never in my life he/she had seen so much cocaine,

307
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,772
hidden behind a wall.

308
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,610
I said: " I believe that you can help me.

309
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,980
"Give me one day to join the money

310
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,348
"and I will return."

311
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,081
The following day, there was an American.

312
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,816
ÉI me Io presents

313
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,380
and he/she tells me that he/she is their godfather.

314
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,720
"Not I am a lot in the city,

315
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,920
"but when you need something,
he is the suitable one,

316
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,485
"he/she will take care of you and...

317
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:27,760
"don't worry, he is 100% of trusting."

318
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,233
The man that presented me

319
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,769
he/she was Max Mermelstein.

320
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,361
Jon introduced me to Max.

321
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,600
I believed that Max, in that then,
he/she was a good person,

322
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,505
a person of trusting.

323
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,943
Max seemed a good type.

324
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,481
At least Io seemed.

325
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,073
At the beginning, Max gave me

326
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,277
75, 100 kilos per week.

327
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,911
With the time he/she saw that I went seriously

328
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,546
and that this was given every week.

329
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,716
When you pay
a million dollars per week,

330
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,021
suddenly he/she is formed...

331
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,153
a knot among people.

332
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,959
Max wanted me to take charge of the business,

333
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,522
to go to Colombia, to fix the trips.

334
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,000
"If Io divides with me,
you will make much more money

335
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,560
"and you can continue
providing who you want."

336
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,402
And Max sent me to Colombia.

337
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,699
This is the municipality Envigado of Medellín.

338
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,108
It is where the bosses of the cocaine meet.

339
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:14,907
I met with Rafa

340
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,414
and I showed up
to people with the one that worked.

341
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,882
Let us say that we knew

342
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,250
to the elite of the business
of the drug of Colombia.

343
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,448
They Were Ochoa and...

344
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:25,683
- Pablo Escobar.
- People of the one that...

345
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,487
...it was read in the books.
- Carlos Lehder.

346
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,026
And me, a boy from New York,

347
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,755
that he/she never thought that this could pass him/her.

348
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,023
They pretended to have

349
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,065
an enormous office with computers

350
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,930
and with 40 secretaries, but they were a group

351
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,561
of vague, a group of street hoodlums

352
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,264
that they were lucky.

353
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,099
Let us put it in a way

354
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,075
in that the Americans
they can understand it.

355
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,612
Here they are accustomed
to the Italian and the mafia.

356
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,908
The Colombians have his Io.

357
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,347
It is a mafia,
but it is the Colombian mafia.

358
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,352
Alone I knew to a family
in that time.

359
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,047
The family era of Medellín.

360
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,679
The family Ochoa

361
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:01,123
it was a family
of very respected farmers,

362
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,660
with a lot of influence

363
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,288
in their native city of Medellín, Colombia.

364
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,490
And of course,

365
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,533
they have the captain, and to the head, the boss.

366
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,568
A lot of people want to believe

367
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,833
that Pablo Escobar was the king of the cocaine.

368
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,066
Because that Io believes,

369
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,405
but the true king was Ochoa.

370
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,638
And it was not Fabito, the poor person, but the old one.

371
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,648
The old one was the silent man
that he/she never went to the jail

372
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,775
and who controlled Escobar.

373
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:29,082
Fabio Ochoa, patriarch of the family Ochoa

374
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,849
of the poster of Medellín.

375
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,517
It is said that they created

376
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,993
an insurance of transport
for the traffic of cocaine in Colombia.

377
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,757
Rafa was as a lieutenant,

378
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,891
and it almost controlled each kilo of coca

379
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,332
that he/she entered in this country.

380
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,630
Through people from Medellín,

381
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,933
Rafa knew Io that entered and he/she knew

382
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,406
who you Io Ilevaba
and how much it won for each one.

383
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,035
And he/she made them win... I cannot believe it.

384
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,170
Millions are not enough,

385
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,908
he/she made them win
more than millions to this people.

386
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,279
Not there was nobody above of him

387
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,215
in the poster of Medellín in this country.

388
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,116
He/she had many soldiers,

389
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,417
as the soldiers of the mafia
that they worked for him.

390
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,889
Some sold drug,

391
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,220
others imposed the force.

392
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,453
He/she had accountants, lawyers.

393
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,654
In their opinion?these types

394
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,162
the Horsemen of the Cocaine are not?

395
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,630
Of course that not.

396
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,893
ÉI had of everything in this country,

397
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,559
and it was a well formed group.

398
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,262
Not they are different people

399
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,464
those that send the merchandise,
it is an organization,

400
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,166
the poster of Medellín.

401
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,267
The federal ones accuse
to the poster of controlling the 80%

402
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,904
of the cocaine that enters EE UU.

403
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,312
The authorities say:
"These three men

404
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,782
"they manage a more violent organization

405
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,342
"and similar of powerful
that the mafia in EE UU."

406
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,616
For my experience
with the mafia of New York

407
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:38,986
and with the Colombians,

408
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,616
the Colombians
they made much more money

409
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,091
in much less time

410
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,857
of the one that the mafia never sounded to make.

411
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,227
They had farms,

412
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,562
Ilamaban properties, Ilenas

413
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,125
of cocaine,
because they constantly took place.

414
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,103
They had to types
that they chewed leaves the whole night.

415
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,663
They worked in the factories
chewing the leaves.

416
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,437
These types worked without stopping.

417
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,410
And there there is not industry.

418
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,777
They were earned a living harvesting this.

419
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,782
These farmers and poor workers

420
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,750
they received a lot of money to make this.

421
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:11,188
It was an entire process,
as if it was a factory.

422
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,383
We worked with radios of short wave,

423
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,290
we didn't use the telephones

424
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,227
as you leave in the movies.

425
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,992
"Does he/she hear?how do the things go in Colombia?

426
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,659
"I need 600 kilos."
No, it was not this way.

427
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,662
We had antennas that came out of the floor

428
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:27,466
and Ilegaban to the 25 meters high.

429
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,734
In a certain schedule
they fastened the short wave,

430
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:33,471
we fastened the radios
and we communicated this way.

431
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,877
At this hour in Miami

432
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,040
in a band of short wave

433
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,778
that most cannot syntonize,

434
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,878
Ilegan the coded instructions
from a transmitter

435
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,718
in Medellín, Colombia,

436
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,587
of the members of the organization

437
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,626
more big of the world
of the traffic of drugs.

438
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,689
The livestock is clever,

439
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:52,787
the livestock is clever.

440
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,831
At 8 o'clock on the dot.

441
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,459
At 8 o'clock for first o'clock.

442
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,629
We fixed this way the trips,

443
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,196
and the Colombians hired us.

444
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,764
I made the arrangements

445
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,208
and they said: We "have 1000 kilos,

446
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,540
"it passes to look for them."

447
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,547
On the mountains,
slipping for the valley,

448
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,673
this way nobody would see us.

449
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,478
We never had landing problems

450
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,848
or of take off.

451
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,547
Everything was paid there,
the government worked with them

452
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,385
and there we sent the airplane.

453
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:21,255
The Colombians didn't have...

454
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,918
Io that made didn't know.

455
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,690
99% of the runways

456
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,288
they were of powder, of grass,
people that worked there.

457
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,425
It is hence that we had own team.

458
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,968
When Ilegabas there

459
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,402
you saw the destroyed airplanes,
that would not happen to us.

460
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,872
The airplane landed, and it spent the night.

461
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,203
You landed and they asked you:

462
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,107
"? Do you want to stay or do you want a woman?

463
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,736
"If you want my sister, you will have it.

464
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,143
"? Do you want something of taking?".

465
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,943
"Yes, I want to take and to return to the airplane

466
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,814
"and to fly 12 hours drunkard. Clear.

467
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:47,852
"The woman doesn't sound bad."

468
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,319
The following thing was the load.

469
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,753
There are two ways to return from there.

470
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:51,948
Flying, one can return

471
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,787
for the east of Cuba that is shorter,

472
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,656
or one can return for the side west.

473
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,718
If he/she had much combustible
the side west was the best

474
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,697
because all Io that happened,

475
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,994
he/she came from Bahamas.

476
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,126
If they were patrolling,

477
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,864
there it would be where they would be.

478
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,803
One would go where the action is.

479
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,206
So we came western,
nobody would think there of you.

480
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,570
Apparently, the strict surveillance

481
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,272
and bigger security
in the coast this of Florida,

482
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,815
he/she makes that the smugglers
go to the coast west

483
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,714
to make their connections.

484
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,185
We appeared in the coast
on Marco Island,

485
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,245
we flew to Georgia,

486
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,847
we gave the turn and we returned.

487
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,653
It seemed that we went toward the south.

488
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,557
Nobody that came from north to south

489
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:30,822
he/she made anything illegal.

490
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,592
Ilevar 62.000 cadavers was been able to

491
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,030
in an airplane in EE UU

492
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,727
because I don't know how many airplanes

493
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,269
there is at the same time in the air,

494
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,531
but there is not control.

495
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,232
You can land
in a small airport

496
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:42,967
because there are not policemen in each airport

497
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,338
that they ask what Ilevas in the airplane.

498
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,842
We made as that we went

499
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,310
to one of the local airports,

500
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:51,042
but we made an approach
and we went to the west.

501
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:54,142
We buy properties in Lakeland.

502
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,982
We build two tracks

503
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,079
and a couple of barns
that in fact they were hangars.

504
00:20:58,156 --> 00:20:59,623
They seemed barns.

505
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,181
And when you opened the door of the hayloft

506
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,752
you saw that it was adapted
to the line of an airplane.

507
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,697
It managed a car
of about 8 years of antiquity...

508
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,131
and we loaded him/her 300 packages.

509
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,725
We put suspension to the car

510
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,565
so that he/she didn't collapse

511
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,129
and we used a crane to tow it.

512
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,936
We had created
a company of tows

513
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,569
and we buy a gas station
and a garage in Miami.

514
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,772
The type of the crane
he/she had a work order.

515
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,315
The driver, obviously,
Io that happened knew,

516
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,577
but we told him/her: "If they stop you

517
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,949
"and they open the cajuela, you don't know anything."

518
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,783
If you manage the car it is difficult not to know

519
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,880
Io that there is in the cajuela,
but that of the crane would not know.

520
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,857
Not you know, they hired you to tow it.

521
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,120
It hooked it and he/she left.

522
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,752
He/she leaves that you Ileven the car,

523
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,127
but they cannot stop
because you have the order.

524
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,632
We went in caravan,
with two or three cars.

525
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:43,998
One went to the front

526
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,969
observing, and one went behind.

527
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:49,166
They entered to Miami, and we made that

528
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,733
during 7 years without having any problem.

529
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,335
It was one of the advantages of Lakeland.

530
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,142
They always stopped people

531
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,875
that he/she went toward the north,

532
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:01,441
but it was never known
that they stopped them if they went toward the south.

533
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,818
Mickey and the other ones
they made air launchings.

534
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:07,052
I built myself a small navy.

535
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,185
We decide to make it of Colombia
to Bahamas

536
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,196
and there to throw it to the boats.

537
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,425
They threw buoys

538
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,525
to know
with accuracy where the load was,

539
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:18,967
because there was a frequency

540
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,403
that it sent the sign with the location.

541
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:25,102
The console of the mean opened up,

542
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,304
they made holes in the mean of the boat

543
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,313
and you Ilenaban.

544
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,474
And it was brought inside the boats.

545
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:37,053
The great problem
it was the packing of the product,

546
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,590
that it was a fiasco
because the Colombians,

547
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,717
so wonderful in the organization,

548
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,055
Io ruined in two trips.

549
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,187
There was filtration of salted water

550
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,697
and that killed to the coca.

551
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,996
The salted water is the enemy of the coca.

552
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:52,866
Mickey was determined
in that could stop the filtration

553
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,235
and he/she told them how to wrap them.

554
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,501
I sent them recordings, I sent them pictures,

555
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,372
step for step, of how to make it.

556
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,343
One won't tell to a Colombian

557
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,175
how anything to make.

558
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,511
Mickey could pass it speaking

559
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,676
that the Colombians
they won't make Io that tell them.

560
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,310
My boys will look for the packages

561
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,014
and when they returned

562
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:13,057
they were not wrapped up.
They were as always.

563
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,387
And Io tossed to the garbage,

564
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:16,290
more than the half it didn't serve

565
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,988
and they lost millions of dollars

566
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,462
because they didn't know how to wrap it.

567
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,931
For their stupidity, the water harmed.

568
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,627
And they were bothered with me.

569
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,465
But they could not accuse me,
it was their problem.

570
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,062
"He/she hears, it is your problem."

571
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,904
Not he/she went until the third trip
that he/she gave result.

572
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,536
And it worked, and it worked.

573
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,046
He/she sometimes entered for the front door.

574
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,446
The front door
it was the entrance in Haulover.

575
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,075
Ilamábamos this way.

576
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,551
Not you said that Ilegabas for Haulover.

577
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,019
So you said the front door.

578
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,988
It is a code class.

579
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,354
In Haulover Inlet rented a department

580
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,893
in the floor 12 of the northeast corner

581
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,222
Ilamada Harbour House,

582
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:53,822
that he/she has a spectacular view
of the bay.

583
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:57,562
I put to a youth,
I paid him/her so that he/she lived there,

584
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,433
I paid for the department.

585
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:00,994
When we took a trip

586
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,767
she had a couple of binocular

587
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,138
and clear, a radio.

588
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,700
We find all
the possible frequencies

589
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,507
against the competition.

590
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,378
The Customs of EE UU,
the marine local patrol car.

591
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,611
We would know if they were listening.

592
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:16,119
Once I came home in boat.

593
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,315
It was sometimes
with the boys in the front door

594
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,755
or in the department.

595
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,224
This time, it was in the boat

596
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,318
speaking with my friends
in the department.

597
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,590
Who Io will say,
people of Customs appeared

598
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:28,155
and of the Coastal Watch
armed with rifles M16.

599
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:31,464
Not I believe that they looked for us,
but they were revising boats.

600
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:33,800
!And I am in a loaded boat!

601
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,134
But when stopping to my side

602
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,731
the motor of the boat ago:

603
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,708
!bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!

604
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,608
I tell him/her: "God, sounds awful."

605
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,112
And he/she tells me: It has been this way" "for one day.

606
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,511
!Oh, God!

607
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,415
He/she gives the turn, he/she doesn't go away neither 30 meters

608
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,077
and there is kind of a... !bum!

609
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,621
I believed that it had shot the rifle

610
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,123
and... it grabbed the wave exactly.

611
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,852
The piston is shot of the motor

612
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,622
and it jumps in the wave.
As if they threw a stone.

613
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,459
A great Ilama comes out of side

614
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:02,728
that it illuminates everything.
"!That I leave a ray!"

615
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,031
They call for the radio but nobody responds.

616
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:06,695
They had modern teams

617
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,534
and I worried about them.

618
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:09,733
"? Do they want that the tow?"

619
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:13,505
I threw them a rope,
they were gone up to the boat

620
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,603
and I towed the Coastal Watch

621
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,477
and to the Customs of EE UU, but the boat

622
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,313
he/she had loaded about 350, 400 kilos.

623
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:21,613
The youth of the department

624
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,210
he/she said that alone me...

625
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:26,689
any other one had entered in panic
and jumped by the overboard.

626
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,282
Of there we went until

627
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,850
the entrance of the port of Maule Lake,

628
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,657
where he/she had rented several quays.

629
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,130
The following day Ilegaba my crane

630
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,860
with a work order and a tráiler.

631
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,765
My business was to four blocks.

632
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:40,327
We put the boat there, we went from behind,

633
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:44,136
we opened the compartment
and we loaded the cars.

634
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,074
They gave the whole merchandise to me.

635
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,374
He/she had several hiding places in Miami.

636
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:50,073
It used common people,

637
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,207
hard-working people that needed the money.

638
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:55,378
It was about finding
to somebody in a decent neighborhood

639
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:58,183
that it didn't consume drugs,

640
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,952
because I made a couple of errors.

641
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,586
He/she found holes in the kilos

642
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,391
as if they put a jackstraw

643
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:07,522
and it seemed that a rat was the culprit.

644
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,897
Not it was in one, but in five different

645
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:12,300
and it maybe lacked
one or two grams of each one.

646
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,531
It parked in the garage

647
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,005
to take out the product.

648
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,939
Each house had a garage,

649
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,204
because they were many kilos
entering and leaving

650
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,246
and it could not discharge them in the street.

651
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:25,181
It counted it, I made sure
that everything was.

652
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,775
And Io made by day.
He/she never worked at night.

653
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,913
Each product had a mark.

654
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,922
300 had bicycles

655
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,185
and 200 had glasses.

656
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,386
Each one went to a certain group.

657
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:39,225
He/she had three, four...
four different groups.

658
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:40,855
They went with the cars

659
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,263
to restoring Denny's, for example

660
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,733
or to Uncle Tom's Ribs

661
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:46,202
and the one that managed entered to the place

662
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,967
and he/she gave him/her Ilaves
to the Colombian there inside.

663
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,974
They were always Colombian.

664
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:54,136
They had brought to their own one
people to sell it here.

665
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:55,679
It never happened

666
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,510
Io that showed the stupidity of < i > Mlaml Vlce < /i>

667
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,948
where they stopped the cars
with weapons and everything.

668
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,246
"Allow me to see Io that there is in the cajuela,

669
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,651
"Io will revise, I will make tests
and you Io will return."

670
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,189
Not it works this way.

671
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:07,451
They were controlled by the other ones.

672
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:08,822
Not it was that they had option,

673
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,155
you same Ilevaban

674
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,718
it was garbage or it was good,

675
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,093
you Ilevaban.

676
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:14,290
He/she gave them to him

677
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,492
to wholesalers.

678
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,364
The wholesalers Io divided

679
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:20,632
in 25, 50, 75, Io that was...

680
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,104
that their retailers wanted.

681
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:24,334
I remember that the kilo cost 40.000,
50.000 dollars

682
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,637
in the street for then.

683
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,076
They paid us to transport the kilos.

684
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,943
I believe that they paid us

685
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,880
3500 dollars the kilo.

686
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,441
To make sure
that they gave us the money

687
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,043
alone we gave the half,

688
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,554
and they put the money in the cajuela,

689
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,317
and when they returned us the car

690
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,519
he/she gave them the rest of the product.

691
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:46,587
We are about maintaining
to all far from all

692
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,428
and there was not this way way to rake him.

693
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,627
One of my fears was that those
wholesalers,

694
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:53,262
that you Io gave
to five different retailers,

695
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,067
that they caught one

696
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,631
and that for not wanting to go to the jail,
he/she began to sing,

697
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,074
and he/she could tell them:

698
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:00,873
"This is the main type,

699
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:03,106
"follow it and he will bring them to me."

700
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,014
Rafa counted that he/she had to kill to a type

701
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,746
because Io caught and it will accuse them.

702
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,720
I heard strange histories,

703
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:14,247
so I tried

704
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:15,553
of never to need help.

705
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:16,889
To them they gave them the car,

706
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,121
they didn't know from where he/she came,

707
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,993
you already know, it is alone a car.

708
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,260
You never returned the car

709
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,130
where you had the coca, because you didn't want

710
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,261
to have the money
and the drugs in the same place.

711
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,931
The money stayed
in one of the hiding places.

712
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,702
He/she participated my of the money

713
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,003
and he/she kept the rest,

714
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,908
because he/she had to send

715
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,843
the money to Ochoa and Escobar.

716
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,542
Then we worked
with Noriega in Panama.

717
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,754
The country of General Noriega

718
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,017
it is a meca for the laundry of money.

719
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,854
We put the money in our airplane

720
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:51,123
and we flew up to where it was
people of Noriega.

721
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:54,254
It allowed them to use the airport
for the landings.

722
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:55,731
We never sent an airplane

723
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,097
with less than ten millions.

724
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:58,897
Limitless quantities of money enter

725
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,598
and they leave the country without any requirement.

726
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,868
The laundry of money is not a crime.

727
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,410
The army took the money,

728
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,503
Io Ilevaban to the bank,

729
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,377
and we were partners in the bank with Noriega.

730
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,439
They opened the bills, you had a bill

731
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,711
and for Io that you wanted

732
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:14,911
you gave a check.

733
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:17,079
Many times he/she made a treatment.

734
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,622
Instead of paying me cash,

735
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,157
of the 500 kilos

736
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,954
they gave me 100 for me

737
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,926
and he/she could sell it to 25.000 dollars.

738
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:25,929
While Ilegaban the loads, it revised them

739
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:26,986
and it took out the best,

740
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,032
because they were not same,

741
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,498
and it put them here and there.

742
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,330
Max and I finish

743
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:34,371
making about 750.000,
1.000.000 dollars for trip.

744
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,134
Max told me that he used to make

745
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:38,505
250.000 alone for the transport.

746
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,100
ÉI was not only wet

747
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,839
when it could have been been at home,

748
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,107
but rather he/she was soaked

749
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,274
and it won more three times per week.

750
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,546
The drugs were in all sides.

751
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,109
All consumed cocaine.

752
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:52,554
I remember that was in the 80... !ugh!

753
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,319
The cocaine was in fashion.

754
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:55,984
It was something to show off.

755
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,652
You went to any side...

756
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:58,923
it could not leave to any side

757
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,555
without entering to the bathroom and...

758
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,224
When you entered to the bathroom, there was always

759
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,528
somebody aspiring a line.

760
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,364
You heard that he/she closed the door of the bathrooms

761
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:06,698
and you heard them aspire.

762
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,102
All entered something in the nose.

763
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:09,140
You saw to types

764
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:10,572
to leave the bathroom of the girls.

765
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,405
There were places where the tables

766
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,944
they were tapas of mirrors.

767
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:17,573
The waiters helped
to the clients to mill the coca.

768
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,516
In a time in Miami,
in the traffic accidents,

769
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,485
that they were common accidents,

770
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,784
3, 4 or 5 people sometimes left the car

771
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,687
that they ran in all addresses.

772
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,192
And they found cocaine
and you arm in the car.

773
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,319
They stopped to a car and they found

774
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:35,230
30 handbags Ilenos with more than 900 kilos

775
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,461
of cocaine, with a purity of the 90 to 95%.

776
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,504
While the hauls
and the seizures continue,

777
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:43,973
there is more cocaine
in Florida of the South that never before.

778
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:48,274
We were of having cases
of a kilo or two of cocaine

779
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,782
to 1000 kilos that it is a ton,

780
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,479
to 5000 kilos that are 10 tons.

781
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:58,647
During a period of five years

782
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:02,989
I presided over the trial of the case "the biggest
quantity of cocaine in the history"

783
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,153
some ten times.

784
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,925
Each case was bigger than the previous one

785
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,431
and it imposed a new record.

786
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,626
In general, when the prices lower

787
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,169
it is a good news.

788
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:16,435
The exception is the prices
of offer of the cocaine.

789
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:17,633
They were millions of dollars in drugs

790
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,074
that they fell of the sky.

791
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,304
One day a shepherd was giving a sermon

792
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,903
in a church of the south

793
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,415
and he/she was speaking against the drugs

794
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:26,609
and half million of dollars in cocaine

795
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,151
they cross the roof

796
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,652
because the airplane that Io was rushing

797
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,052
it left course

798
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:34,319
and it was pursued
for an airplane of the customs.

799
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,223
The price of the white illegal powder

800
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:40,355
he/she fell 50% in both
last years in Florida.

801
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,399
!My God! There were people from Cali,

802
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,458
another poster of Barranquilla.

803
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:45,866
You began to multiply the cocaine

804
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:47,029
that he/she entered to the country.

805
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,367
The connection Miami-Colombia

806
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:52,466
it is 80% of the 20.000 millions
annual of the business of the cocaine.

807
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,602
Miami is one of the main branches

808
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,443
of Io that Ilamamos Cocaine, S.To.

809
00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:00,143
Florida is flooded of cocaine.

810
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:05,287
- It was in all sides.
- It was in all sides.

811
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,119
- It was in all sides.
- Clubs, restaurants.

812
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:08,283
It was in all sides.

813
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,850
The elitist drug is now of labor class.

814
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:15,832
People common worker
he/she believes that it is as the beer.

815
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,893
One of each ten workers
it is drugged in the work.

816
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,531
People Io Ilevaba in the neck,
non Io hid.

817
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,006
Nobody was about hiding it.

818
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,872
Undoubtedly I proved it, of course,

819
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,172
but I could never understand

820
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,769
what... why they liked.

821
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:31,337
It is very intense, I cannot describe it.

822
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,883
It is really well Io.

823
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,248
People one went mad.

824
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,480
Alone in Dade County,
the lethal overdoses

825
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:40,081
they increased more than 88% in the last anus.

826
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,752
He/she makes 15 years,
an annual death for cocaine

827
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,954
it was not very common.
The deaths for cocaine

828
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:47,293
they have increased at two per week.

829
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:48,832
People began to smoke it.

830
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,391
The studies indicate that most

831
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,164
he/she has begun to smoke the drug.

832
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:54,727
? Did you come to smoke cocaine?

833
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,795
Yes.

834
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:58,000
And not the crack, but in their basic form,

835
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,771
because that Ilegó before the crack.

836
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,106
He/she transformed into furor.

837
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,272
They locked in the houses and they smoked.

838
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:06,579
I was awake four and a half days,

839
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,484
without stopping, without to eat neither to sleep.

840
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,318
Non Io understood, but he/she requested: "Make it."

841
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,948
For me it was a business,

842
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:17,153
and the more Io made,
more money won.

843
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:21,061
I arrived here with about 800 dollars.

844
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,190
It was Io that had to my name.

845
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,429
He/she had about 25 or 26 years.

846
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,596
When I began in the business

847
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,197
it used the department
of my grandfather in South Beach.

848
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:31,741
He/she had kilos there

849
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,834
and I will never forget
the first time that he/she saw them.

850
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,742
He/she said: ?" What is this?".
I counted him/her

851
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,838
and he/she told me: "Not I can understand it."

852
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:39,678
I responded: ?"You can understand

853
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,616
"that I am winning 50.000 a week?".

854
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,278
Once I told him/her:

855
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,946
"I will no longer use your house.

856
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,320
"I will pay to somebody."

857
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,052
"? How? Not make that, non Io makes."

858
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,253
And I told him/her:
"Not it cares, now I have a million."

859
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,455
And he said: "Not you have a million dollars."

860
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,157
"I have a million, I will pay to somebody

861
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:55,699
"to put this in their house.

862
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,359
"I no longer need to make you this to you."

863
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,902
Then, a million for me

864
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:59,937
it was a lot of money.

865
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:01,631
It was the first million that won.

866
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,834
It was a lot of money,
but after that...

867
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,544
By the middle of the 70

868
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:12,310
the American economy
it was in chaos state.

869
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,374
The financial supplement of the < i > Mlaml Herald < /i>

870
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:18,013
he/she spoke of a recession
national that was in march.

871
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:21,456
There was a lot of unemployment,
people lost her houses,

872
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,255
the real estate market
it was disappearing.

873
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:26,194
The traffic of drugs
it is affecting the economy

874
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,561
in Florida of the South.

875
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:29,224
But in Miami
there were not houses to buy.

876
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,824
They could not be gotten

877
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,427
enough Rolex of gold
to supply to the market.

878
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:37,634
In the first 6 months of 1977,
the sales retailers in Miami

879
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,266
Ilegaron to the 10.000 millions.

880
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,174
Not there are recession signs.

881
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,940
Florida of the South stayed well

882
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,709
that many other parts of the country.

883
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,512
Here armored cars were sold

884
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,882
for hundred of thousands of dollars.

885
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:52,411
Ferraris neither Mercedes were not gotten.

886
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,787
Certain agencies of automobiles

887
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,918
they said that they have cars
enough it stops less than one month.

888
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,985
They still admit in advance payments,

889
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:00,997
although the deliveries will be delayed.

890
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:04,523
All went to the business of the drugs.

891
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:07,663
The drugs and the money
they go of the hand in Florida.

892
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,866
It is a business retailer
of 7000 millions to the anus,

893
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:15,402
that is near 12.000 dollars
for each house in Dade County.

894
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,074
If it looks for in their wallet in Miami

895
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,879
and it takes out a note and Io it analyzes

896
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,579
he/she will find cocaine in him.

897
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:24,382
The earnings of the gentlemen of the drug

898
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,980
they made that the local economy
it resisted the recession.

899
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:30,585
Every day, he/she spills money
in the economy of the coca.

900
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:31,992
They buy houses,

901
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,894
bounce, cars.

902
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,227
He/she Had a Porsche I Upset,

903
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,632
a Mercedes, then
the 6.9 were in fashion.

904
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,000
We discuss once.

905
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,698
We get angry. He/she requested me something

906
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:42,898
and not you Io wanted to give.

907
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,999
I came closer and Io slapped.

908
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,407
It pursues me for the entrance

909
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,707
and we grab two Mercedes
and we destroy them.

910
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:51,680
Jon took out a he/she arms and it shot to the car

911
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,580
to inclination... beside my head.

912
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,642
!I made that somebody you Ilevara

913
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,744
and it destroyed them!

914
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,914
We demolished both vehicles.

915
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,252
The following day I was laughing.

916
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,848
We destroy many things.

917
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,292
Skies, were cars
for value of 100.000 dollars.

918
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:07,024
There was a company
that you Ilamaba I.P. Evans Mercedes.

919
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:11,626
He/she had types like Max, Rafael,
two or three employees of Rafael,

920
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:15,866
that they bought
about 8 or 10 Mercedes to the anus

921
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,340
of Mercedes' concessionaire
with a check of Panama.

922
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,434
? Who does buy 8 or 10 Mercedes to the anus?

923
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,876
Then, they didn't care it.

924
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:24,312
He/she entered and they told me:
"? How it is, Sr. Roberts?

925
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,349
"? What does he/she need this week?".

926
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:26,940
"I need the 6.9 of there."

927
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,315
"Well?does he like it in black?"

928
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:29,648
"Yes, he doesn't care the color.

929
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,415
"And I need a van for their girlfriend."

930
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:32,547
And he/she gave him/her a check.

931
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:33,749
It was not even a box check.

932
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:35,223
He/she knew to the type in the concessionaire,

933
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:39,662
it was alone a check of a Panamanian bank

934
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,493
and I list, he/she had the car.

935
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,090
Very little it is made

936
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:47,126
to stop the propagation
of the economy of the cocaine.

937
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,797
All wanted money then.

938
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,172
Not it is strange that a Latin
spend 20.000 dollars or more

939
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,211
in all kinds of goods.

940
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:57,441
The best thing for the merchant
it is that he/she pays him/her cash.

941
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:00,416
Although the merchants in Florida
they don't consume drugs,

942
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:03,510
it is said that they can
to be addicted to the money of the drug.

943
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,317
We Buy a Cessna Conquest.

944
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,085
We pay 980.000 dollars,

945
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,219
cash? what do they count me?
Attempt it at some time.

946
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:12,227
Neither they blinked.

947
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:13,263
They believe to know

948
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:14,593
from where the money comes,

949
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,895
but they won't be desagradecidos.

950
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,265
They never blinked.

951
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:20,395
Not ask, don't speak,
he/she takes the money and veto.

952
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:21,768
They didn't care a carajo.

953
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,830
The sale of cocaine and marijuana in Miami

954
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,569
it generates so much money

955
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:28,669
that the smugglers
they don't have where to keep it.

956
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,839
Not they understand, he/she had
bags of garbage in the garden

957
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,679
with 700.000 dollars,
a million in each bag,

958
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,082
buried. Not he/she had another place.

959
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,416
ÉI used to keep it in the food of the horse.

960
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:38,978
I remember to look for the food of the horse

961
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:42,492
and to find money in the bag.

962
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,585
Nobody questioned anything,

963
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:45,890
because to my neighbor

964
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,362
he/she gave 10 kilos a week.

965
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,422
The neighborhood of Earth of the King

966
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,024
it was a ruin when we move.

967
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,330
To the neighbor of in front he/she gave him/her

968
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,564
20 kilos a week,
this way what he took care.

969
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,799
All wanted money

970
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,773
and suddenly, all had money.

971
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:00,208
The whole neighborhood.

972
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,371
You wear out about 100.000 dollars of more

973
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,415
and it is well. Jon was that good.

974
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,144
Not it cared. Not it is that

975
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,345
he/she didn't have enough money.

976
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,752
? How could that be?

977
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,449
? How could that be?

978
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,685
He/she had three boats in the back patio,

979
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,422
two pumas, two lionesses
living in my house.

980
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,327
He/she had a helicopter in the back patio.

981
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,491
He/she used to go in helicopter to the careers.

982
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:23,965
All the other ones went in car.

983
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:26,162
He/she landed to see run to my horses

984
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,102
during one hour and he/she returned home.

985
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:30,663
He/she had, 40, 50 horses in that time.

986
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:32,902
Skies, he/she had excellent horses.

987
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,138
? Io that costs know
to feed them one month?

988
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:37,180
50.000 to the alone month to feed them.

989
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:38,215
The cost didn't care

990
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,977
because Io had in the pocket.

991
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,018
People left party.

992
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,780
Suddenly there were dozens

993
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:45,151
of night clubs
of first that you/they were inaugurated.

994
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:47,213
He/she already makes years that didn't open up
a night club

995
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:48,724
in Miami Beach.

996
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,488
The Jockey Club, Turnberry,

997
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:52,085
Palm Bay Club, Cricket Club.

998
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,188
But the best of all was

999
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,426
The Mutiny, in Coconut Grove.

1000
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,334
It was exclusively for the traffickers.

1001
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,099
If you were in that business, you had the money.

1002
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,664
You could entertain
to people abundantly.

1003
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,505
We used to go to the restaurants...

1004
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,602
to have dinner to Arturo's or Palm

1005
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,941
or to Joe's Stone Crab.

1006
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,278
The Forge
it was then the best restaurant.

1007
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,942
They gave us the fourth bottom in The Forge

1008
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,077
and we closed the room.

1009
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,883
And we could spend
20.000 dollars in one night

1010
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,253
and to destroy the walls.

1011
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,258
We gave them the money
so that Io that we broke fixed.

1012
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:25,762
It was an I waste, the money was not anything.

1013
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,991
Jon liked to go
to the bars of nudes.

1014
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:31,262
Not it was anything to spend 5000 dollars
in a striptease club.

1015
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:33,735
Not we speak of one night,

1016
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,465
but of three or four a week.

1017
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,972
He/she told to my friends:
"? Do you see that girl?

1018
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:40,306
"I guarantee you that I can
to make that he/she goes to bed with you."

1019
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,777
ÉI said: "Not there is way

1020
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,370
"that he/she wants to go to bed with me."

1021
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:44,778
He/she asked him/her: ?" How much you want

1022
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,113
"to go to bed with this type?".
"Non Io will make."

1023
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,981
"?Will non Io make? I give you 500."

1024
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,281
"Non Io will make."
"I give you 1000."

1025
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:51,787
"?Will non Io make? I give you 2000."

1026
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:54,290
At the end, they stopped to resist.

1027
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:55,723
2000, 3000 dollars. "I will make it."

1028
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:58,660
And the type started to tremble,

1029
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,924
they could not understand how Io achieved.

1030
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,492
Although Miami has changed, I still believe

1031
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,694
that all had a price.
All Io has.

1032
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,237
They are few those that not.

1033
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:09,499
You could begin with Noriega in Panama

1034
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,699
and to lower until

1035
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,266
the administrators of the city,
to the police.

1036
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:14,675
If they stopped somebody

1037
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,213
and they had 50 kilos, they were offered a tip.

1038
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:20,011
One maybe is not able to
coimear to a policeman with 20 dollars

1039
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,917
or with 50 or 100, but there were hundred

1040
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:23,976
of thousands of dollars.

1041
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:25,612
Tell them that in one hour you will have

1042
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:27,520
Io that they want cash.

1043
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,649
Half million,

1044
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,455
three million rooms.

1045
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:31,688
But you should leave with the coca.

1046
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,127
He/she almost always gave result.

1047
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:34,459
He/she knew a lieutenant

1048
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:35,897
that Bay worked in North Village.

1049
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:36,933
I came closer one day and I told him/her:

1050
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,628
"I want to discharge some boats

1051
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,636
"behind police's department

1052
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,262
"?do you believe that there will be problems?".

1053
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,500
And he/she said: He/she "looks, we will use two patrol.

1054
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:45,735
"Put it in the cajuelas

1055
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,175
"and Ilevaremos to where you want."

1056
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:49,542
We accuse four mayors

1057
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:53,674
most sentenced by corruption.

1058
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,242
We were very powerful
and we had a lot of money.

1059
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,617
?There are places where they have more power

1060
00:40:57,688 --> 00:41:00,054
- that the government?
- Hey... Unfortunately,

1061
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,591
I believe that it is certain.

1062
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:04,127
I was member of the republican circle.

1063
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,060
Howard Baker sent me a letter:

1064
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,530
"Send me the contribution
and you can come to Washington."

1065
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,591
AIlí was, with the senators
and the fat fish

1066
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,102
and neither one of them asked me

1067
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,661
neither to what I was devoted in Miami.

1068
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,036
They accepted me

1069
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:18,540
because I made a great contribution

1070
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:19,974
to the Republican party.

1071
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,376
It was in that circle and I told myself:

1072
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:24,209
"I made all this with the drugs

1073
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,511
"and Io made with alone that."

1074
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,382
The traffic of cocaine and the money

1075
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:33,981
almost they ruin the morality
of this community.

1076
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,685
Millions of dollars cash

1077
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:38,250
they support to a net of banks of drugs.

1078
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,126
?Have you done a city with so many banks?

1079
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:41,562
?You will tell me that that class exists

1080
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,293
of industry and businesses here?

1081
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:44,994
Please.

1082
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,900
That makes the government suspect

1083
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,166
it is that the last anus
the banks of Florida of the South

1084
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:54,007
you Ilevaron 6000 million dollars extra
of the savers.

1085
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:58,276
The presidents of the banks
they counted money during days.

1086
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,283
?Is Landmark a bank of the coca?

1087
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,080
Definitively not.

1088
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:05,713
The banks invested
in machines accountants of money.

1089
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,053
For lack of space,
the banks Io surrendered

1090
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,615
to the Federal Reserve.

1091
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,888
A bank of this size deposits

1092
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:15,523
near 12 million dollars to the anus
in the Federal Reserve.

1093
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,658
The last anus, the Continental-National

1094
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:20,670
it deposited 600 million dollars
cash.

1095
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:21,864
? He/she means

1096
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,406
that this bank is not legal?

1097
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:24,441
Here the money is counted

1098
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:26,567
of the Federal Reserve in Miami.

1099
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,771
The last anus, the Federal Reserve of here

1100
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:32,714
it generated a surplus of effective
of 5000 millions,

1101
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:35,217
more money than all
the other banks of Federal Reserve

1102
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:36,947
of the whole country.

1103
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:38,778
To Miami it can describe it

1104
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,881
as the general barracks of the exterior

1105
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,926
for the laundry of money
of the Colombians.

1106
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:44,927
I bought properties for all sides.

1107
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,428
There are thousands of properties

1108
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,021
that they are worth more than 1000 million dollars

1109
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:51,192
that they were bought with illegal money
in Florida of the South.

1110
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:52,257
A couple of houses.

1111
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:53,530
A navy.

1112
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:55,003
The property where my business was.

1113
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,039
We buy departments.

1114
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:57,164
Many deposits.

1115
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,039
We buy 190 hectares
of earth in Tampa.

1116
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,441
A real estate great business.

1117
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:02,706
We buy one of the buildings

1118
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,077
to transform it into a radio room.

1119
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,378
Four hundred hectares in Central Florida.

1120
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,715
The traffickers bought 8, 10, 15 houses.

1121
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:10,913
In a place in the south of Miami,

1122
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:12,979
he/she was owner of almost the whole neighborhood.

1123
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:17,221
He/she had 24 million dollars
in properties.

1124
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:21,594
One day I will work
and I enter to the Interstate one 95,

1125
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:26,796
the one that gives me a beautiful view
of the center of Miami.

1126
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,770
"He/she looks at that", and we count

1127
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:34,038
22 cranes for the construction

1128
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,705
that they were seen in the horizon.

1129
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,977
"I wonder how much
of that money it is of the drugs."

1130
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,577
!Skies! ? How much did I spend?

1131
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:48,990
There was so much money that once he/she entered

1132
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:50,549
you could no longer destroy.

1133
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,430
Maybe Io that I kept in the bank...

1134
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:58,491
at least 50 million dollars.

1135
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:00,537
Thousands of millions will have financed

1136
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:04,199
much of the development
and of the construction in Miami.

1137
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,242
But it was spotted money of blood.

1138
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:14,410
I center commercial Dadeland
July 11 1979 - 14.28 hours

1139
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,952
1979 were the anus

1140
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,421
in that the things became serious.

1141
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,152
Dadeland was the moment definitorio.

1142
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,490
The first shooting in the war of the cocaine.

1143
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,893
The shooting happened at 14.30 o'clock

1144
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:29,694
when two Latins entered to a liquor store

1145
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,701
in the side west of the commercial center.

1146
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:34,499
Two or three Latins followed them more

1147
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:36,163
and there the shooting began.

1148
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,071
We knew immediately

1149
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:41,441
that it was another shooting
among Colombian for drug.

1150
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,571
Two people have died

1151
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,672
and others are wounded.

1152
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:48,411
Inside the liquor store, a Colombian

1153
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:51,750
and another no-Cuban Latin
suspects of traffic of drugs

1154
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:54,450
they lie in a puddle of blood.

1155
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,390
I was running until there and I said:

1156
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,621
"I am of the < i > Mlaml Herald, < /i>
?do Io that happened here know?".

1157
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,358
The policemen were in shock state.

1158
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:04,026
Never in my life I saw...

1159
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,365
hey... such a quantity of...

1160
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:10,032
hey... ?how to say it?

1161
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:12,837
In 1979, I spent two years in homicide.

1162
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,242
But this went further on

1163
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,872
of Io that anyone
it could have imagined.

1164
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:20,940
There were glasses and wastes for all sides.

1165
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:25,079
There were bullet cases
in the wall, the floor,

1166
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:28,386
in the shelf, it seemed
a shooting of the old west.

1167
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:29,756
The aggressor shot

1168
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:31,124
for the whole parking lot.

1169
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:32,162
? Io that happened them saw

1170
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,196
when it finished the shooting?

1171
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:35,356
- They left running.
- ?Where?

1172
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,229
Not I know, I was running.

1173
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:39,326
The innocent pedestrians
they looked for refuge,

1174
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,268
the cars were riddled
with metralletas,

1175
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:42,635
the tanks of gasoline
they spilled their content.

1176
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:44,833
There were two scenes, the main scene

1177
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,206
where they were
the bodies, in the liquor store,

1178
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:49,245
and the secondary scene,
to the one that you/they assigned me

1179
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:51,508
it is the one that you Ilamó
the van of war.

1180
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:55,481
They found a van

1181
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:56,849
to the north of the commercial center.

1182
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,581
With the open door and the lit motor.

1183
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,385
It was a van Ford Econoline 1979

1184
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,085
transformed into armed people's transport.

1185
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,422
It was the machine of the death.

1186
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,861
He/she had steel reinforced to the sides.

1187
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,160
The windows were taken out
to be able to shoot.

1188
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:12,066
He/she Said Happy "Supplying Hour"
in the side.

1189
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:14,070
We find 14 different weapons.

1190
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:16,800
These murderers
they were as the glasses descartables

1191
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:18,273
clever to discard.

1192
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:20,776
They shot a he/she arms
until it was empty,

1193
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:22,402
they threw it and they took another.

1194
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:26,245
There was of everything, shotguns,
carbines, MAC-10, an Uzi,

1195
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:28,910
several guns, ammunition for all.

1196
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:32,820
I believe that the van of the war
it was the decisive moment

1197
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:36,951
where the police
he/she realized to Io that faced

1198
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:38,221
and how overcome they were.

1199
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,126
? What he/she tells him/her the quantity of armament

1200
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:41,630
in that van?

1201
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:43,825
Well... that they are very armed

1202
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:47,667
and that... they are prepared to give battle.

1203
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:49,228
The bullets flew for all sides.

1204
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,206
The total bill was of 86 bullets

1205
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:52,742
that they were shot of all the weapons.

1206
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,437
Skies, I don't know...

1207
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:56,001
I don't know how many times they shot them.

1208
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,172
They had so many bullet wounds

1209
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:00,443
that it was me impossible

1210
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:03,281
to determine the exact number of shots.

1211
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:05,048
We made the pursuit standard,

1212
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,090
the van
it was registered with a false name.

1213
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,489
The weapons bought them
with false names.

1214
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,118
We went to the addresses

1215
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:12,355
but they had already escaped.

1216
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:13,555
It was the Colombian typical case.

1217
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:14,756
Not us Ilevó to any side.

1218
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,527
The police registered the neighborhood

1219
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,160
during more than one hour,
but they didn't find suspicious.

1220
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:20,794
I told myself: "Another open" slope.

1221
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:23,431
That means a case without solving

1222
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:27,307
because so far
we have not been successful

1223
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:28,639
in closing the Colombian murder.

1224
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,703
We have a new phenomenon,

1225
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:32,806
this violence doesn't have precedent.

1226
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:34,817
The sophistication didn't have precedent.

1227
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:39,217
I believe that it was the first case

1228
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:40,756
where there was a shooting

1229
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:43,292
in a public place in the mean of the day

1230
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,021
when people happened over there.

1231
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:47,723
After that, it frequently happened.

1232
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:50,790
It was the principle of a war,
the war of the cocaine.

1233
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,233
The detectives of homicides

1234
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:54,793
they say that Miami is
in the mean of a war

1235
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:57,271
among drug traffickers
Colombian and Cuban.

1236
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,399
Miami was changing.

1237
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:00,636
The Colombians
they were tossing to the Cubans.

1238
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,646
There was a lot of noise
to share the market.

1239
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,272
One of the reasons of the violence

1240
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:07,579
it was due to the competitive factions.

1241
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:13,112
And the violence converted Miami
in the Horsemen of the Cocaine.

1242
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,487
This Way Ilaman, the Horsemen of the Cocaine.

1243
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,458
Ilaman the Horsemen of the Cocaine.

1244
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:21,020
This of the Horsemen of the Cocaine,
they were people from Medellín.

1245
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:23,396
The calculations say that they are 100.000

1246
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:24,729
the Colombian illegal residents

1247
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:27,793
that they live and they work
for the traffic of drugs in Florida.

1248
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:29,702
They went after their objective,

1249
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:31,570
they killed the wife, to the maid.

1250
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:32,904
"If there is a dog there, Io will kill."

1251
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:34,341
"If there is a bird, Io I will kill,

1252
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,673
"if there is a pececito, Io I will kill."

1253
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,374
If a girl Ilamaba
to the door to sell cookies,

1254
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:39,972
they also killed her.

1255
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,950
Stopped people there, children.

1256
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,646
They killed anyone.

1257
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,813
They killed visible anyone.

1258
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:48,050
Jesús Hernández,
a machine gun discharge

1259
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,592
Io destroyed in its car

1260
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,594
in a street converged at noon.

1261
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:52,788
Machine gun fire.

1262
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,162
And then I heard the one...

1263
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:00,133
An Iluvia of bullets Ilenó the department,

1264
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:03,900
a sign of identity
of the Horsemen of the Cocaine.

1265
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:06,442
In the freeways, the tolls, the national one 1,

1266
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,341
in some residential streets.

1267
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:10,073
Red Mustang went toward to the north

1268
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:12,047
in the avenue 107.

1269
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:15,676
The green sedan stopped
beside the driver and he/she opened fire.

1270
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:18,915
The tools of the death,
you arm automatic and shotguns.

1271
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,014
This is Io that you leave in television,

1272
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:22,649
that doesn't leave in the real life.

1273
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:25,126
The witnesses said
that it was a war zone.

1274
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:26,992
To the style < i > Mlaml Vlce, < /i > but without the cameras.

1275
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:29,794
But this was the real life,
it was happening.

1276
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,163
They killed over there at five,

1277
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,701
three over there.

1278
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,862
A calm area of Kendall

1279
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:37,168
it was the scenario of a slaughter.

1280
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,708
They were six bodies
in an elegant house.

1281
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:41,471
The police says that it is the worst

1282
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:43,945
case of multiple murder
in the history of the city.

1283
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:46,448
It is believed that the massacre
it is related with the drugs.

1284
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:51,044
We speak of slaughters that in this time

1285
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:53,715
they would have journalistic covering

1286
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,815
of all the television channels.

1287
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:59,384
That level of violence was to newspaper

1288
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:03,331
and the local means,
because we were saturated of it,

1289
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,527
they said: "Ah, another double" homicide.

1290
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:07,194
"Ah, another triple homicide."

1291
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,067
It was common that we were

1292
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,130
jumping of a scene from the crime to another.

1293
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:12,766
He/she had to have more than four deads

1294
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,435
so that it was important.

1295
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:18,447
I remember five murders
that they happened one night.

1296
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,951
They happened eight murders
in Dade in the last 48 hours.

1297
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,213
You never knew when you will trip

1298
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:24,253
with another body.

1299
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:25,788
Miami looked like each other

1300
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:29,849
to the slaughter of San Valentine's Day
of the 20s in Chicago.

1301
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:32,622
Gánsteres managing for the streets

1302
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,561
stopped of side

1303
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:37,395
with their machine guns Thompson.45

1304
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:40,630
tiroteándose in Chicago in the 30s.

1305
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,672
What happens here

1306
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:45,367
he/she would make that Chicago,
in the days of the dry law

1307
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:47,774
it seemed a picnic
of a Sunday school.

1308
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:50,677
One of the policemen said
that he/she resembled Dodge City.

1309
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:52,806
It seemed the Distant West then in that.

1310
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,078
But he/she made a mistake, because Dodge City

1311
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,313
it was never as violent as Io it was Miami.

1312
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,720
Miami in the 80s were considered

1313
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:03,692
the most dangerous place in the earth.

1314
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,752
The city of the murder was Detroit,
then Atlanta, and now Miami.

1315
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:10,061
In 1976, 104 murders were investigated.

1316
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:12,101
The first seven months of 1979

1317
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:14,831
they were the bloodiest
in the history of Florida of the South.

1318
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:18,397
There were 573 homicides in 1980.

1319
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:21,137
1981 will break another record

1320
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:22,974
of murders in Miami.

1321
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:25,514
I believe that there will be more than 600 murders

1322
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,947
for anus ends.

1323
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:29,417
While the traffic of drugs prospers,

1324
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:32,546
the average of homicides
in Dade it will continue ascending.

1325
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,920
The crime in Miami ascended and the tourism lowered.

1326
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:38,017
In spite of the pessimism
that people predict,

1327
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,926
we predict that we will have

1328
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:42,328
more arrivals of tourists
in the area of Miami

1329
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:44,299
for the summer
of Io that we had the passed anus,

1330
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:45,356
that it was an exceptional anus.

1331
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:51,071
For Fidel Castro it was the equivalent one

1332
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:52,768
to a genocide act.

1333
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:54,606
Of a single time, it liberated Cuba

1334
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:57,044
of thousands and thousands of undesirable.

1335
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,082
It emptied the jails, it tossed to the vagrants

1336
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:02,243
of the streets of Havana.
Murderers, thieves, perverts,

1337
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,981
prostitutes, slowed, discapacitados,

1338
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,990
all joined
and they were sent Mariel Harbor

1339
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:10,288
and of there in boats in address to Miami.

1340
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,828
Fidel Castro declared openly:

1341
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:15,558
"I threw of the chain of the bathrooms
of Cuba on EE UU."

1342
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,860
And he/she bounced of it.

1343
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:20,630
A ship came out toward EE UU
every 5 minutes,

1344
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:23,104
Ilegaban without nuisances day and night.

1345
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,273
It was something common in Florida of the South.

1346
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:29,141
Shootings, dead people

1347
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:31,407
and most of the time, the murderers

1348
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,416
they are those that came from Cuba in 1980.

1349
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,475
As consequence, the rate
of murders it was duplicated.

1350
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,953
It was as if there is
correspondent an army invader

1351
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:41,957
so that it violated, he/she stole
and it set on fire the city.

1352
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:44,084
And it is Io that are making.

1353
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:47,562
I assault serious, violations, robberies.

1354
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:50,156
In little time,
we had bodies in the floor.

1355
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:53,293
We had to heap them.
It was a shame.

1356
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,667
There have been so many murders

1357
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:56,137
in Miami lately

1358
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:58,572
that a refrigerated truck is in use

1359
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:00,610
for the office of the forensic surgeon of Dade

1360
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,474
to keep the bodies.

1361
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:04,309
They had fixed to rent it

1362
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:07,680
to Burger King,
that he/she has the central office here.

1363
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:09,082
It was very angry.

1364
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:11,916
The martian have invaded us.

1365
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:13,922
These types are unhinged.

1366
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,458
To anybody it seemed to care him/her Io that happened

1367
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,460
in the streets of Miami. For that reason I spoke.

1368
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:21,793
Psychologically,
they are not even human.

1369
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,230
They are animal... not even animals,

1370
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,927
that it is an insult to the animal Kingdom.

1371
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:27,231
Not there were law neither order.

1372
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:29,204
We all carry weapons. My wife,

1373
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:31,103
my two children.

1374
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:33,233
They will see that I have a loaded shotgun

1375
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:35,261
And we will shoot somebody.

1376
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:36,318
I never traveled

1377
00:53:36,397 --> 00:53:38,058
for the county of Dade without being armed.

1378
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:39,963
Not there is doubt on it.

1379
00:53:40,034 --> 00:53:43,993
I always had a he/she arms,
he/she didn't sleep well without her

1380
00:53:44,071 --> 00:53:45,561
especially in Miami of that time.

1381
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,540
Edna Buchanan said in television

1382
00:53:47,608 --> 00:53:48,870
that it carries two weapons

1383
00:53:48,943 --> 00:53:50,205
and that all should make it.

1384
00:53:50,278 --> 00:53:52,576
Merret Steirheim,
then administrator of the county,

1385
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:54,012
and the commissaries were furious,

1386
00:53:54,081 --> 00:53:55,912
so I was person it doesn't burnish for a while.

1387
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,577
Miami was literally
being come below.

1388
00:53:58,653 --> 00:54:00,348
But the police help non Ilegaría

1389
00:54:00,421 --> 00:54:02,719
due to lack
of personal in the department.

1390
00:54:02,923 --> 00:54:05,414
The federal agencies
they admit to be paralyzed

1391
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:08,189
for the lack of men, money and resources.

1392
00:54:08,262 --> 00:54:10,287
The department of police of Miami

1393
00:54:10,364 --> 00:54:14,357
it left frantically to look for personal.

1394
00:54:14,435 --> 00:54:16,335
More policemen in the street

1395
00:54:16,404 --> 00:54:18,804
they will help to revert this tendency.

1396
00:54:18,873 --> 00:54:20,204
They used to have parameters.

1397
00:54:20,274 --> 00:54:21,764
Not to never have consumed drug

1398
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:23,207
to be police.

1399
00:54:23,277 --> 00:54:24,369
They reduced it

1400
00:54:24,445 --> 00:54:26,413
to in the last 10 years

1401
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,879
and that didn't work.

1402
00:54:27,948 --> 00:54:29,745
"In the last five years."

1403
00:54:29,817 --> 00:54:31,409
They didn't reach even this way.

1404
00:54:31,485 --> 00:54:33,851
Lastly, Io reduced
to the last two years.

1405
00:54:33,921 --> 00:54:35,479
And Ilegaron to a point

1406
00:54:35,556 --> 00:54:37,888
in that hired them
if they didn't consume in that moment.

1407
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:41,917
That was
in the biggest crisis of police corruption

1408
00:54:41,996 --> 00:54:44,760
from the days of Serpico in New York.

1409
00:54:44,832 --> 00:54:47,630
The whole class of the academy of that anus

1410
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:49,602
it finished in prison or dead.

1411
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:51,763
They are already three the officials

1412
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:53,101
that they arrested this weekend.

1413
00:54:53,174 --> 00:54:55,335
Today's arrests was given
while other seven

1414
00:54:55,409 --> 00:54:58,640
they are in accused trial
of stealing to the drug dealers

1415
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:00,442
and of selling the drugs themselves.

1416
00:55:00,514 --> 00:55:03,608
The Policemen of the Cocaine
they have been accused of conspiracy,

1417
00:55:03,684 --> 00:55:05,515
traffic of drugs and organized crime.

1418
00:55:05,586 --> 00:55:09,579
The result, impacting...
40 policemen and former policemen

1419
00:55:09,657 --> 00:55:12,057
arrested or suspended
in the last two years.

1420
00:55:12,126 --> 00:55:14,890
Sixteen suspended
in the last two weeks.

1421
00:55:14,962 --> 00:55:16,224
And that is not everything.

1422
00:55:16,297 --> 00:55:18,959
At least 30 more policemen
they will be suspended.

1423
00:55:19,033 --> 00:55:23,402
The hand of the law failed in Florida of the South.

1424
00:55:23,471 --> 00:55:24,961
Then stop to work

1425
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:26,370
and let us abandon the streets.

1426
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,840
We are committed
seriously and we will recapture

1427
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:30,274
the control of the streets another time.

1428
00:55:30,344 --> 00:55:33,074
The system of justice doesn't work here.

1429
00:55:33,147 --> 00:55:36,742
I suggest that we revise the whole concept.

1430
00:55:36,817 --> 00:55:40,776
CENTAC 26 entered in operations
in December of the 81.

1431
00:55:40,855 --> 00:55:43,415
There were 25 organizations previous CENTAC

1432
00:55:43,491 --> 00:55:44,958
in all EE UU.

1433
00:55:45,025 --> 00:55:47,357
CENTAC means
"Tactical Central" Unit.

1434
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:50,591
Our main objective
he/she went to unite to homicides

1435
00:55:50,664 --> 00:55:52,097
with the division of drugs.

1436
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:56,227
They had connections
with the Antidrug Agency, with the FBI.

1437
00:55:56,303 --> 00:55:57,702
We were fighting
with criminal's type

1438
00:55:57,772 --> 00:55:59,330
with who we had not fought before.

1439
00:55:59,407 --> 00:56:03,173
The instructions
that I gave they were very simple.

1440
00:56:03,244 --> 00:56:06,577
In difficult times,
they take difficult measures.

1441
00:56:06,647 --> 00:56:08,808
You could use any method

1442
00:56:08,883 --> 00:56:11,374
to take out somebody of the streets.

1443
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:14,216
We will come undone of them
imprisoning them

1444
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:16,256
or killing them.

1445
00:56:16,323 --> 00:56:17,551
It was a dedicated unit

1446
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:18,990
to be more active than it reactivates.

1447
00:56:19,059 --> 00:56:21,289
It was a different way to make the work

1448
00:56:21,362 --> 00:56:22,727
and it was necessary then

1449
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:24,458
due to the criminal's nature,

1450
00:56:24,532 --> 00:56:26,557
so much with the Colombians
as with the Cubans

1451
00:56:26,634 --> 00:56:27,931
that they came from Mariel.

1452
00:56:28,002 --> 00:56:30,527
Miami seems to be had
transformed into the Lost Paradise.

1453
00:56:30,604 --> 00:56:33,198
In the autumn-winter of 1981

1454
00:56:33,274 --> 00:56:37,540
the article < i > Paradise Perdldo < /i>
it left in the magazine < i > Tlme.</i>

1455
00:56:37,611 --> 00:56:40,512
The magazine < i > Tlme < /i > it squashed Miami.

1456
00:56:40,581 --> 00:56:42,208
The article of 9 pages

1457
00:56:42,283 --> 00:56:43,716
it was focused in Miami

1458
00:56:43,784 --> 00:56:47,117
as the problematic center of drugs,
crimes and refugees.

1459
00:56:47,188 --> 00:56:49,383
The politicians in Miami and in Dade County

1460
00:56:49,457 --> 00:56:51,448
they became crazy when Io saw.

1461
00:56:51,525 --> 00:56:52,822
The first question is:

1462
00:56:52,893 --> 00:56:54,622
"?Is it safe to visit Miami Beach?".

1463
00:56:54,695 --> 00:56:56,526
- ? What would he/she tell them?
- Again I tell them

1464
00:56:56,597 --> 00:56:58,724
that unless they come to traffic drugs,

1465
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:01,063
it will be so sure here as Io it would be

1466
00:57:01,135 --> 00:57:03,399
in any part of the world,
included their own city.

1467
00:57:03,471 --> 00:57:05,496
We were divided worlds between two.

1468
00:57:05,573 --> 00:57:08,599
The capital of the sun and the amusement...

1469
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:09,643
and the capital of the murder.

1470
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:11,405
That era the idea of the article...

1471
00:57:11,479 --> 00:57:13,037
Ios criminals won

1472
00:57:13,113 --> 00:57:14,876
and we lost.

1473
00:57:20,387 --> 00:57:22,014
I Was Born in Cali, Colombia.

1474
00:57:22,089 --> 00:57:24,922
I arrived to EE UU in 1969.

1475
00:57:24,992 --> 00:57:27,392
I Grew in Chicago,
it was mechanical with my dad.

1476
00:57:27,461 --> 00:57:29,361
I worked for General Motors, there I learned

1477
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:30,897
how to open cars.

1478
00:57:30,965 --> 00:57:32,865
Even young, they knew me
as one of the best

1479
00:57:32,933 --> 00:57:34,195
thieves of cars in Chicago,

1480
00:57:34,268 --> 00:57:36,236
and then, after the 80s,

1481
00:57:36,303 --> 00:57:38,863
it was known to be assassin for the poster.

1482
00:57:47,014 --> 00:57:49,039
JORGE "RIVl" AYALA
ASSASSIN

1483
00:57:49,783 --> 00:57:52,308
He/she admitted their participation in 29 murders
during Guerra of the Cocaine.

1484
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:54,081
It is suspicious of other 12 murders.

1485
00:57:58,158 --> 00:57:59,455
I joined with a group of types.

1486
00:57:59,527 --> 00:58:01,825
We stole cars
and we sold them to the desguazaderos

1487
00:58:01,896 --> 00:58:03,693
for 200 or 500 dollars each car.

1488
00:58:03,764 --> 00:58:06,460
We used to steal 5 or 6 per night.
We were three.

1489
00:58:06,534 --> 00:58:09,196
We made good money.
Better than working with dad.

1490
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:11,329
He/she came from a good family,
he/she had Io that needed.

1491
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:13,066
Not he/she needed to steal cars

1492
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:15,267
but it was for the money and for the enthusiasm

1493
00:58:15,342 --> 00:58:16,900
of entering in the car of somebody

1494
00:58:16,977 --> 00:58:19,605
and then to sell it.

1495
00:58:20,481 --> 00:58:23,917
Chicago
August of 1980

1496
00:58:23,984 --> 00:58:25,781
Restoring Tropicana.
We used to go

1497
00:58:25,853 --> 00:58:27,514
there for the public phone.

1498
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:28,885
AIlí us Ilamaban.

1499
00:58:28,956 --> 00:58:30,423
We used it as office.

1500
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:32,721
He/she took a specific place
where it parked

1501
00:58:32,793 --> 00:58:34,260
and nobody more Io used.

1502
00:58:34,328 --> 00:58:37,456
I arrive one morning,
and there was a parked car.

1503
00:58:37,531 --> 00:58:38,862
I asked to the waiter

1504
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:40,628
of who it was. He/she said:

1505
00:58:40,701 --> 00:58:42,726
"Of a fat fish of Miami."

1506
00:58:42,803 --> 00:58:45,135
I told him/her that I cared
of who a carajo was.

1507
00:58:45,205 --> 00:58:48,333
He/she wanted to move the car, so me Io Ilevé.

1508
00:58:48,409 --> 00:58:50,843
The following morning
we were in the restaurant...

1509
00:58:50,911 --> 00:58:53,471
and three Colombians entered
asking for Riverita.

1510
00:58:53,547 --> 00:58:55,344
"I am looking for it
because my car was stolen."

1511
00:58:55,416 --> 00:58:57,247
"I am the type that you look for, I am Rivi."

1512
00:58:57,318 --> 00:58:59,582
"You stole me the car
and I want that me Io returns."

1513
00:58:59,653 --> 00:59:00,881
"Not you Io will return.

1514
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:02,445
"Give me 500 dollars because now it is mine.

1515
00:59:02,523 --> 00:59:04,718
"You parked where you didn't should."

1516
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:06,282
He/she began to laugh and he/she told me:

1517
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,225
"Yes that have eggs?do you know?".

1518
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,320
I said: I "listened that before."

1519
00:59:10,397 --> 00:59:11,659
And he said: ?" What will you make?".

1520
00:59:11,732 --> 00:59:14,701
"It is simple. 500 to recover it."

1521
00:59:14,768 --> 00:59:18,101
He/she paid me, Ilaves takes out and he/she opens the cajuela.

1522
00:59:21,508 --> 00:59:23,032
Ilena of weapons was.

1523
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:25,305
Revolvers, automatic guns.

1524
00:59:25,379 --> 00:59:27,176
And he/she asks me if he/she had gone to Florida.

1525
00:59:27,247 --> 00:59:29,511
"Yes, with my dad."
"?Do you have relatives there?"

1526
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:32,074
"Yes, about six."

1527
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:33,676
He/she asked me if Ilevarlo could Miami.

1528
00:59:33,754 --> 00:59:36,052
"Clear?will you pay me?"

1529
00:59:36,123 --> 00:59:37,852
He/she said that he/she would give me 5000 dollars.

1530
00:59:37,925 --> 00:59:39,483
I told him/her that it was well.

1531
00:59:41,028 --> 00:59:43,861
To Ilegar, he/she said that he/she had some businesses,

1532
00:59:43,931 --> 00:59:45,728
maybe we could work for him

1533
00:59:45,799 --> 00:59:48,267
and to make more money
if we stayed there.

1534
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:49,802
"?To make what?"
He/she said: To "give drug

1535
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:51,201
"and to pick up the money.

1536
00:59:51,271 --> 00:59:53,205
"Maybe to sell marijuana
from time to time."

1537
00:59:53,273 --> 00:59:55,867
The pay was good, 1000 dollars per day.

1538
00:59:55,943 --> 00:59:58,173
The first time that we work was

1539
00:59:58,245 --> 01:00:00,941
with people of the business of the drug.

1540
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:03,279
But he/she didn't have intentions of killing people.

1541
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:06,148
It was this way later, but...

1542
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,949
Weeks later
we were in Jacaranda,

1543
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:12,083
a night Colombian club in Miami.

1544
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:15,322
Thin he/she comes closer and he/she asks me:
"?Are you our supplier?".

1545
01:00:15,396 --> 01:00:16,795
He/she tells me: He/she "hears, you should leave

1546
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:18,092
"because we will give a blow here.

1547
01:00:18,165 --> 01:00:19,826
"Those of that table,

1548
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:23,461
"the six Colombians
that they are laughing and taking liquor

1549
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:25,664
"we will liquidate them. To all."

1550
01:00:25,739 --> 01:00:27,639
I thanked him/her the.

1551
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:29,369
I asked him/her go to warn to my boys,

1552
01:00:29,443 --> 01:00:32,503
except to Vanegas, the Black one,
because it was drugging.

1553
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:34,638
We tell him/her Black because it was very dark.

1554
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:36,478
It was black Colombian.

1555
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,279
I went to the bathroom and I warned him/her.

1556
01:00:38,352 --> 01:00:39,979
"We have to leave,
they will kill somebody."

1557
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:42,352
But I didn't tell him/her to who.

1558
01:00:42,423 --> 01:00:45,256
It asked me him to give him/her
a moment and I came out.

1559
01:00:45,325 --> 01:00:47,589
Then Vanegas went to that same table

1560
01:00:47,661 --> 01:00:49,026
and he/she told them that they left,

1561
01:00:49,096 --> 01:00:50,791
because it will have a shooting.

1562
01:00:50,864 --> 01:00:53,298
It ruined the blow, it was an accident.

1563
01:00:53,367 --> 01:00:54,561
He/she knew one of them

1564
01:00:54,635 --> 01:00:56,102
so alone he/she tried to protect their friend.

1565
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:57,831
I was out, Vanegas came out.

1566
01:00:57,905 --> 01:01:01,170
Behind Vanegas,
all pushed to leave.

1567
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:03,334
Thin Ilega in its moto, was angry.

1568
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,775
"You Io ruined everything

1569
01:01:04,845 --> 01:01:05,869
"and it should not have warned them."

1570
01:01:05,946 --> 01:01:07,277
I said: ?"Of what do you speak?".

1571
01:01:07,347 --> 01:01:09,406
"You warned them, they didn't know,

1572
01:01:09,483 --> 01:01:10,711
"and the only ones that Io knew

1573
01:01:10,784 --> 01:01:13,150
"they were you. You."

1574
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:15,711
I told him/her that yes,
that I warned to my boys.

1575
01:01:15,789 --> 01:01:17,723
I said: He/she "waits, I will speak with Black."

1576
01:01:17,791 --> 01:01:19,088
I asked him/her if it had warned them.

1577
01:01:19,159 --> 01:01:21,093
"I told to one of them of the shooting,

1578
01:01:21,161 --> 01:01:23,789
"but he/she didn't know that it was that table."

1579
01:01:23,864 --> 01:01:25,729
I told him/her that we were in problems.

1580
01:01:25,799 --> 01:01:27,391
I returned and I told him/her that Io had made

1581
01:01:27,468 --> 01:01:28,765
but that it was an accident.

1582
01:01:28,836 --> 01:01:30,269
He/she told me that it was in problems

1583
01:01:30,337 --> 01:01:32,828
with their boss,
and that the boss wanted to know me.

1584
01:01:32,906 --> 01:01:35,136
"Tell to your boss that was an accident."

1585
01:01:35,209 --> 01:01:36,699
"Not he/she wants to hear that,

1586
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:38,608
"alone you", he/she told me.

1587
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:39,941
"The boss wants to know you.

1588
01:01:40,013 --> 01:01:43,915
"It is that or you are in problems."

1589
01:01:43,984 --> 01:01:46,214
We get into the car and I tell him/her:

1590
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:47,878
"Won't they kill me?no?".

1591
01:01:47,955 --> 01:01:50,583
ÉI responded: "Not I know,
I don't guarantee you anything, old."

1592
01:01:52,659 --> 01:01:53,956
We had ruined it.

1593
01:01:54,027 --> 01:01:55,995
We speak of killing six people.

1594
01:01:56,063 --> 01:01:58,497
You already know, these types are not cowardly.

1595
01:02:00,033 --> 01:02:02,160
He/she asked me if he/she had a he/she arms
and I told him/her that yes.

1596
01:02:02,236 --> 01:02:03,601
But he/she had two.

1597
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:06,639
He/she had one of back
in the left leg.

1598
01:02:06,707 --> 01:02:09,073
We went until Holiday Inn
in the freeway 95.

1599
01:02:09,143 --> 01:02:12,271
I look and I see to four types leave the car.

1600
01:02:12,346 --> 01:02:13,711
I asked: ?" Are they?".

1601
01:02:13,781 --> 01:02:15,214
"Yes, but there is more to your left."

1602
01:02:15,282 --> 01:02:16,909
I looked and there were four more than the other side.

1603
01:02:16,984 --> 01:02:19,748
I came closer to the oldest type.

1604
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:21,845
"?Are You Rivi?"
"Yes", I told him/her.

1605
01:02:21,922 --> 01:02:24,550
"They come with me."
We get into the car

1606
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:28,288
and in the back seat there was a lady.

1607
01:02:28,362 --> 01:02:30,057
She gave the orders.

1608
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:32,064
She spoke,

1609
01:02:32,132 --> 01:02:33,326
nobody said,

1610
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,628
Io that she said made.

1611
01:02:34,701 --> 01:02:36,362
Their husband was ahead.

1612
01:02:36,436 --> 01:02:38,529
Not he/she opened the mouth.
He/she didn't ask me questions.

1613
01:02:38,605 --> 01:02:40,630
Alone she spoke,
saying me what to make.

1614
01:02:40,707 --> 01:02:42,197
She is the one that has the power.

1615
01:02:42,276 --> 01:02:44,801
A woman is speaking this way to me

1616
01:02:44,878 --> 01:02:48,609
and he/she should have said him/her
that he/she left to the shit,

1617
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:50,013
but I thought: "No, not."

1618
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:51,482
He/she asked me if it was the one that there was

1619
01:02:51,552 --> 01:02:54,851
wornout the blow.
"In certain way yes", I told him/her.

1620
01:02:54,922 --> 01:02:58,153
He/she told me: Months "ago
that we are looking for them

1621
01:02:58,225 --> 01:03:00,921
"and it is the first time that we see" them.

1622
01:03:00,994 --> 01:03:02,723
And me Io had ruined.

1623
01:03:02,796 --> 01:03:07,699
He/she tells me: I will tell "you what to make.
Find them

1624
01:03:07,768 --> 01:03:11,067
"and kill them for me.
We will be this way by hand.

1625
01:03:11,138 --> 01:03:13,038
"The two siblings" interest me.

1626
01:03:13,106 --> 01:03:14,300
To the other ones four will kill them

1627
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:15,966
to be sat down in the table.

1628
01:03:16,043 --> 01:03:18,136
"?lban to kill to other 4 to liquidate at 2?"

1629
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:19,702
He/she told me that he/she made this way the things.

1630
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:23,580
"To liquidate to the whole table.
To come undone of all."

1631
01:03:25,586 --> 01:03:27,178
I was surprised that.

1632
01:03:27,254 --> 01:03:30,348
I say, he/she spoke of murdering as...

1633
01:03:30,424 --> 01:03:32,016
I asked him/her him to give me one week

1634
01:03:32,092 --> 01:03:33,423
and that he/she would find them.

1635
01:03:33,493 --> 01:03:35,586
"When you find them, Ilámame.

1636
01:03:35,662 --> 01:03:38,654
"I will give you 50.000 dollars for each one."

1637
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,427
When I returned I asked questions to Thin.

1638
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,491
"? Who is this lady?"

1639
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:45,094
He/she tells me: He/she Is "the Godmother."

1640
01:03:45,172 --> 01:03:47,436
"? Do you want to be more than the Godmother?"

1641
01:03:47,507 --> 01:03:50,032
He/she said that he/she knew it of Colombia

1642
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:51,805
and that it was very dangerous.

1643
01:03:51,879 --> 01:03:54,677
"If you don't complete, it will order you to kill."

1644
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:57,808
She was the biggest in that time.

1645
01:03:57,885 --> 01:04:00,820
He/she was the Godmother of the traffic of cocaine.

1646
01:04:00,888 --> 01:04:02,253
I return to the hotel,

1647
01:04:02,322 --> 01:04:03,653
and I count the boys.

1648
01:04:03,724 --> 01:04:05,316
Vanegas was there, and I told them

1649
01:04:05,392 --> 01:04:07,019
that we were in serious problems.

1650
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:10,188
"If we don't find them
we will have to release ourselves,

1651
01:04:10,264 --> 01:04:11,231
"because they will look for us...

1652
01:04:11,298 --> 01:04:13,027
"this way me Io noticed."
Vanegas...

1653
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,694
he/she says that he/she can
to find the one bigger than them.

1654
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:17,498
"It is all Io that we need, to one."

1655
01:04:17,571 --> 01:04:18,868
Through him, we find to the other one.

1656
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:22,067
I told him/her that Io Ilamara to the search

1657
01:04:22,142 --> 01:04:23,803
and that it fixed an encounter that night.

1658
01:04:23,877 --> 01:04:25,139
"We will kidnap him

1659
01:04:25,212 --> 01:04:27,305
"and Io will give to this people."

1660
01:04:27,381 --> 01:04:31,875
We call, nobody answered.
On the following day, same Io.

1661
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:36,480
To the third day they didn't answer
and it was losing the hope.

1662
01:04:36,556 --> 01:04:38,683
To the fourth day, they answer.

1663
01:04:38,759 --> 01:04:40,920
We are in being
in Ramada Inn.

1664
01:04:40,994 --> 01:04:42,518
We told him/her that we had weapons

1665
01:04:42,596 --> 01:04:44,029
and explosive to sell.

1666
01:04:44,097 --> 01:04:45,826
But when Ilegó to the hotel,

1667
01:04:45,899 --> 01:04:48,333
Io made with its son of 15 years.

1668
01:04:48,402 --> 01:04:50,529
Not we had the boy.

1669
01:04:50,604 --> 01:04:53,937
Vanegas was intelligent
and you Io Ilevó to the car.

1670
01:04:54,007 --> 01:04:55,907
If we would not have to have ourselves him Ilevado.

1671
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:57,443
He/she speaks with Vanegas, he/she laughs.

1672
01:04:57,511 --> 01:05:00,036
I am hidden,
and when Vanegas opens the cajuela

1673
01:05:00,113 --> 01:05:02,172
I leave and I put him/her the weapon in the ribs.

1674
01:05:02,249 --> 01:05:04,046
I tell him/her: I was looking for" "you.

1675
01:05:04,117 --> 01:05:05,516
"I don't owe you anything, he/she tells me.

1676
01:05:05,585 --> 01:05:07,382
"No. Somebody more it looks for you.

1677
01:05:07,454 --> 01:05:09,547
"There is a lady looking for you.

1678
01:05:09,623 --> 01:05:11,250
"You Ilama Griselda Blanco."

1679
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:14,658
"That fat dog, I don't owe him/her anything", he/she says.

1680
01:05:14,728 --> 01:05:18,027
Cumbamba kicked him/her the face
and it removed him/her the teeth.

1681
01:05:18,098 --> 01:05:20,032
"It shows respect for the lady.

1682
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,933
"Tell it to him when you see it,
we work for her."

1683
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:25,062
It became pale. He/she added: You will see "it

1684
01:05:25,138 --> 01:05:28,301
"in a couple of hours."
There it began to tremble.

1685
01:05:28,375 --> 01:05:31,742
One hour later Ilegan and you Io Ilevan.

1686
01:05:31,812 --> 01:05:35,145
The following day I am at home at 16.00 o'clock.

1687
01:05:35,215 --> 01:05:36,682
She enters in my house,

1688
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:38,911
he/she enters as if it was the owner.

1689
01:05:38,986 --> 01:05:40,385
My wife was cooking.

1690
01:05:40,454 --> 01:05:42,217
And he/she says: "I love the fish."

1691
01:05:42,289 --> 01:05:45,452
He/she was eating
while I was how Io killed--

1692
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:46,992
Io cut in pieces--

1693
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:48,391
everything while we had dinner.

1694
01:05:48,462 --> 01:05:49,895
I said: ?"Did it shoot him/her?".

1695
01:05:49,963 --> 01:05:51,225
He/she said: "Yes, I shot him/her...

1696
01:05:51,298 --> 01:05:53,357
"and Cumbamba Io cut,

1697
01:05:53,433 --> 01:05:57,199
"Io put in a box
and Io wrapped for gift

1698
01:05:57,270 --> 01:05:58,965
"with a monkey, and Io we leave

1699
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,530
"to some blocks of here, in the freeway."

1700
01:06:01,608 --> 01:06:03,235
I said: ?"In my neighborhood?".
"Yes, he/she said.

1701
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:06,040
"We went toward the south to come to visit one another

1702
01:06:06,113 --> 01:06:08,240
"and we saw that it was
a good place to throw it."

1703
01:06:11,151 --> 01:06:12,709
I looked at it and I asked him/her if he/she joked.

1704
01:06:12,786 --> 01:06:14,219
And he/she said: "No, it is seriously."

1705
01:06:14,287 --> 01:06:15,652
I said: ?" Does Io always make?".

1706
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:17,121
He/she said that yes that he liked it.

1707
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:20,455
He likes us to cut people
and that we throw this way them.

1708
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:26,422
Griselda Blanco grew with his mother

1709
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:29,958
in Medellín, they were very poor.
He/she was a prostitute.

1710
01:06:30,037 --> 01:06:32,301
Their criminal life began as pickpocket

1711
01:06:32,372 --> 01:06:33,839
and then they moved to New York.

1712
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:35,807
There he/she entered in the business of the drug.

1713
01:06:35,876 --> 01:06:41,246
I heard their name for the first time
at the end of 1973.

1714
01:06:41,314 --> 01:06:43,179
In the confidential information

1715
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:45,445
she appeared like a threat

1716
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:46,577
for EE UU.

1717
01:06:46,653 --> 01:06:47,847
Their business grew.

1718
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:50,151
He/she was a Colombian important trafficker.

1719
01:06:50,223 --> 01:06:52,953
Rafa and Griselda were friends of the childhood.

1720
01:06:53,026 --> 01:06:54,857
For that reason Rafa gave him/her everything.

1721
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:57,260
By the middle of the 70, they accused her

1722
01:06:57,330 --> 01:06:59,958
in a case of cocaine
very big in New York,

1723
01:07:00,033 --> 01:07:01,398
maybe the biggest in that moment,

1724
01:07:01,468 --> 01:07:03,561
and after that he/she escaped and he/she escaped.

1725
01:07:03,637 --> 01:07:06,435
He/she put on in search and it captures.

1726
01:07:06,506 --> 01:07:09,771
The track lost him/her
from the moment of the accusation

1727
01:07:09,843 --> 01:07:13,279
until they transferred me to Miami.

1728
01:07:15,082 --> 01:07:17,346
Not we know
with certainty when it was in Miami.

1729
01:07:17,417 --> 01:07:19,612
Maybe in the 78, non Io knew

1730
01:07:19,686 --> 01:07:21,119
because he/she was a fugitive.

1731
01:07:21,188 --> 01:07:22,815
But we knew that it was dealing.

1732
01:07:22,889 --> 01:07:27,087
In the Latin deep culture, it is not common

1733
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:30,596
that a woman is
the head of their own organization,

1734
01:07:30,664 --> 01:07:35,363
so I suppose
that he/she will have been an evil woman.

1735
01:07:35,435 --> 01:07:37,801
Griselda should prove the Colombians

1736
01:07:37,871 --> 01:07:39,395
that it was worthwhile to maintain

1737
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:40,838
the businesses with her.

1738
01:07:40,907 --> 01:07:44,104
He liked people to fear it.
And they feared it.

1739
01:07:44,177 --> 01:07:45,667
People were him/her so afraid

1740
01:07:45,745 --> 01:07:48,407
that their reputation
it preceded it where it was.

1741
01:07:48,482 --> 01:07:51,849
I made the error
of not knowing who was at the beginning.

1742
01:07:51,918 --> 01:07:55,319
I met her in the department of Rafa,
I adored the Latins,

1743
01:07:55,388 --> 01:07:56,878
and I asked to Rafa who was.

1744
01:07:56,957 --> 01:07:58,254
And Rafa told me

1745
01:07:58,325 --> 01:07:59,690
that I could not go to bed with her.

1746
01:07:59,759 --> 01:08:01,192
I asked why not and he/she told me:

1747
01:08:01,261 --> 01:08:03,627
"If you go to bed with her,
I will have to kill her."

1748
01:08:03,697 --> 01:08:04,959
Then I asked to Max

1749
01:08:05,031 --> 01:08:06,328
who she was.

1750
01:08:06,399 --> 01:08:08,162
And he/she began to be
all those histories.

1751
01:08:08,235 --> 01:08:09,532
It was hypochondriac.

1752
01:08:09,603 --> 01:08:11,002
Quite decadent.

1753
01:08:11,071 --> 01:08:12,265
A Ferrari was bought

1754
01:08:12,339 --> 01:08:13,931
for Christmas for 80.000 dollars.

1755
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:15,736
It collected wealth.

1756
01:08:15,809 --> 01:08:18,073
Their gifts of Christmas
they were always expensive.

1757
01:08:18,145 --> 01:08:19,806
Eva Perón ring...

1758
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,074
jewels and other things.

1759
01:08:21,148 --> 01:08:23,446
It consumed and it abused of the drugs.

1760
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:24,506
He/she was also lesbian.

1761
01:08:24,584 --> 01:08:25,380
Paranoiac.

1762
01:08:25,452 --> 01:08:26,441
Worse than the movies.

1763
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,078
Not even < i > Mlaml Vlce < /i>

1764
01:08:28,155 --> 01:08:29,645
it was so extravagant.

1765
01:08:29,723 --> 01:08:31,953
He/she had bigger three children.

1766
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,593
To last Io Ilamaron
Michael Corleone Sepúlveda

1767
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:47,401
Io that is incredible.

1768
01:08:47,474 --> 01:08:48,805
Their murders!skies!

1769
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:51,139
Ilamaban the Black Widow
because he/she had murdered

1770
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:53,202
to a couple of husbands,
or he/she had made them kill.

1771
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,872
It cut them literally the throat

1772
01:08:54,948 --> 01:08:56,108
after going to bed with them.

1773
01:08:56,183 --> 01:08:57,775
Not I know how many times Io made.

1774
01:08:57,851 --> 01:08:59,819
"Non Io will make because Rafa will tell him/her

1775
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,376
"you already know--" and Max said:

1776
01:09:01,454 --> 01:09:02,648
"He/she will give same" Io.

1777
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:05,122
It could be annoying
one night and if you sleep with her

1778
01:09:05,192 --> 01:09:06,955
it will cut you the throat. ? What will it happen?

1779
01:09:07,027 --> 01:09:08,517
There will be a war.

1780
01:09:08,595 --> 01:09:10,119
She was worse than anyone man

1781
01:09:10,197 --> 01:09:11,562
involved in this.

1782
01:09:11,631 --> 01:09:13,997
The first homicide of fame

1783
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,898
in that was involved, it was in Dadeland.

1784
01:09:15,969 --> 01:09:17,459
There people of Griselda

1785
01:09:17,537 --> 01:09:19,767
he/she entered to the liquor store and it flew him/her the head.

1786
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:21,238
Good, half of her.

1787
01:09:21,308 --> 01:09:24,334
Of course, it was in July of 1979.

1788
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:26,276
I believe that he died for a swig.

1789
01:09:26,346 --> 01:09:27,870
That was Io that established it

1790
01:09:27,948 --> 01:09:30,746
as the more violent well-known trafficker.

1791
01:09:30,817 --> 01:09:33,684
AIlí began the wars of the cocaine.

1792
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:36,881
And we begin to see more homicides.

1793
01:09:36,957 --> 01:09:40,757
The paper of Griselda Blanco
it was very prominent

1794
01:09:40,827 --> 01:09:43,022
in Io that Ilamamos
the Wars of the Cocaine.

1795
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:45,587
He/she murdered many Colombians and Cuban

1796
01:09:45,665 --> 01:09:47,656
to obtain their position in the life.

1797
01:09:47,734 --> 01:09:48,928
Wherever that they go

1798
01:09:49,002 --> 01:09:51,903
Ilevan their special mark of savagery.

1799
01:09:51,972 --> 01:09:54,805
This well-known woman as the Godmother...

1800
01:09:54,874 --> 01:09:58,537
it was the responsible one
of most of the murders

1801
01:09:58,612 --> 01:10:01,706
happened in Florida of the South in those days.

1802
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:06,081
In the years 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1982

1803
01:10:06,152 --> 01:10:08,985
she murdered in Dade County.

1804
01:10:12,659 --> 01:10:19,223
Griselda Blanco was...
the angel of the death.

1805
01:10:19,299 --> 01:10:21,290
Not I know about any organization

1806
01:10:21,368 --> 01:10:23,461
to the one that are attributed so many murders

1807
01:10:23,536 --> 01:10:26,664
as to Griselda. Non Io knows.

1808
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:28,503
It could be for simple things.

1809
01:10:28,575 --> 01:10:30,236
If it was in a restaurant
the previous night...

1810
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:32,210
As when we were
to The Peroz in the beach.

1811
01:10:32,279 --> 01:10:33,712
He/she could be eating

1812
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:35,213
and the owner gave him/her problems or something like that.

1813
01:10:35,282 --> 01:10:37,307
There was an enormous type,
he/she began to speak pavadas.

1814
01:10:37,384 --> 01:10:38,715
And he/she spent of alive with her.

1815
01:10:38,785 --> 01:10:40,150
And she says: "To the shit with the owner,

1816
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:41,482
"I will destroy him/her the business."

1817
01:10:41,554 --> 01:10:43,988
And we left.

1818
01:10:44,057 --> 01:10:45,490
Some types passed in motorcycles

1819
01:10:45,558 --> 01:10:47,287
they occurred turn

1820
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,851
and they began to shoot
to those that waited

1821
01:10:49,929 --> 01:10:51,260
to enter to the place.

1822
01:10:51,331 --> 01:10:52,855
And then Io lead Ilenaron

1823
01:10:52,932 --> 01:10:54,229
fair in the door.

1824
01:10:54,301 --> 01:10:55,268
They were about accusing me

1825
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:57,064
but it was outside of the city.

1826
01:10:57,137 --> 01:11:01,164
He/she will have entered with mistaken people.

1827
01:11:01,241 --> 01:11:03,607
Riverita became
in the main assassin of Griselda.

1828
01:11:03,677 --> 01:11:05,406
It was always with me and other three.

1829
01:11:05,478 --> 01:11:08,003
- He/she had an army with her.
- A cast of mischievous.

1830
01:11:08,081 --> 01:11:12,381
Their people were... almost as of movie.

1831
01:11:12,452 --> 01:11:14,181
- He/she Had Paco.
- Paco Sepúlveda.

1832
01:11:14,254 --> 01:11:17,781
Diego Sepúlveda. Toto.
Carlos Vanegas. Alonso Ayala.

1833
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:19,620
A panda of scruffy.

1834
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:21,024
As the gang that didn't shoot well.

1835
01:11:21,094 --> 01:11:23,255
Uber, Guillermo, Velásquez.

1836
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:25,059
Alone they killed people.

1837
01:11:25,131 --> 01:11:26,098
Cumbamba.

1838
01:11:26,166 --> 01:11:27,895
Monteco, Diego Escobar.

1839
01:11:27,967 --> 01:11:28,899
Oscar Mario.

1840
01:11:28,968 --> 01:11:30,526
Brave Jaime.

1841
01:11:30,603 --> 01:11:32,628
They were bodyguard and assassins.

1842
01:11:32,706 --> 01:11:35,504
They lived off this.
Some are farmaceutas,

1843
01:11:35,575 --> 01:11:37,805
other trash cans,
and these they were murderous.

1844
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:39,367
It was all Io that made.

1845
01:11:39,446 --> 01:11:42,279
Dog Castro was his main assassin.

1846
01:11:42,349 --> 01:11:44,112
For me it was one of the best

1847
01:11:44,184 --> 01:11:45,310
that Griselda had.

1848
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:47,649
It is a legend,
it always caught their man.

1849
01:11:47,721 --> 01:11:50,713
Osvaldo, son of Griselda.
Then he/she had 15 years.

1850
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:51,757
He/she wanted to live quick.

1851
01:11:51,825 --> 01:11:53,417
It carried weapons and all that.

1852
01:11:53,493 --> 01:11:55,984
It moved 300 and 400 kilos of cocaine per month.

1853
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:57,791
Everything orchestrated by their mother.

1854
01:11:57,864 --> 01:12:00,424
He/she wanted to be similar to Don Corleone,

1855
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:03,128
he/she wanted to act as him, and Io made this way.

1856
01:12:03,203 --> 01:12:07,105
He/she had cockerel attitude, due to their mother.

1857
01:12:07,173 --> 01:12:09,266
It was in the club night Faces

1858
01:12:09,342 --> 01:12:11,310
with their friends and their girlfriend.

1859
01:12:11,378 --> 01:12:12,811
Dog lived close.

1860
01:12:12,879 --> 01:12:15,541
And Osvaldo thought:
"I will stay here,

1861
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,912
"in the house of Dog."

1862
01:12:16,983 --> 01:12:18,450
It managed the car until the entrance

1863
01:12:18,518 --> 01:12:21,419
almost until the door, skidding

1864
01:12:21,488 --> 01:12:22,853
and making noise.
Then Dog came out.

1865
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:24,822
And he/she told him/her that he/she left.

1866
01:12:24,891 --> 01:12:26,222
He/she told him/her that if it didn't allow him/her to spend the night

1867
01:12:26,292 --> 01:12:27,725
it would count their mother.
And Dog told him/her:

1868
01:12:27,794 --> 01:12:28,852
"I care a carajo.

1869
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,020
"I care a carajo your mom,

1870
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:31,757
"tell to your mom that leaves to the shit."

1871
01:12:31,831 --> 01:12:33,492
Dog Io kicked in the ass and he/she told him/her

1872
01:12:33,566 --> 01:12:35,227
that he/she entered in the car
and that he/she left.

1873
01:12:35,301 --> 01:12:37,235
"Tell to your mom that I kicked your ass."

1874
01:12:37,303 --> 01:12:39,567
The boy returned and it counted his mom.

1875
01:12:39,639 --> 01:12:41,300
One of the things with her was

1876
01:12:41,374 --> 01:12:42,705
that one could not play their children.

1877
01:12:42,776 --> 01:12:45,301
Not it cared who was,
the person would die.

1878
01:12:45,512 --> 01:12:47,810
There was always somebody he/she made something bad.

1879
01:12:47,881 --> 01:12:50,008
If Io made or not, it was reason so that her

1880
01:12:50,083 --> 01:12:52,017
he/she had problems with them.

1881
01:12:52,085 --> 01:12:53,677
That Ilamó takes a long time to the house.

1882
01:12:53,753 --> 01:12:55,618
"Tell him/her that we are in war,

1883
01:12:55,688 --> 01:12:58,020
"that he/she is no longer my friend, he/she is my enemy.

1884
01:12:58,091 --> 01:13:00,753
"So if Io sees, shoot him/her."

1885
01:13:00,827 --> 01:13:02,886
Rivi and their people were in that area.

1886
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,827
Not it will be easy, because he was good.

1887
01:13:04,898 --> 01:13:06,195
If we make a mistake, Io loses

1888
01:13:06,266 --> 01:13:08,029
or he/she murders us.

1889
01:13:08,101 --> 01:13:12,470
Rivi, the driver
and another gunman went in a van.

1890
01:13:12,539 --> 01:13:15,337
I will make the shots.
He/she had a M16.

1891
01:13:15,408 --> 01:13:17,535
I tell to the driver: "Come closer,

1892
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:18,975
"of window to window,

1893
01:13:19,045 --> 01:13:20,342
"and I will shoot for the door."

1894
01:13:20,413 --> 01:13:22,313
He/she knew that if he/she opened the door

1895
01:13:22,382 --> 01:13:24,407
in movement, he would realize.

1896
01:13:24,484 --> 01:13:25,815
He/she knew all the tricks.

1897
01:13:25,885 --> 01:13:28,080
Dog opened the door of the garage,

1898
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:29,985
it left toward the street 168

1899
01:13:30,056 --> 01:13:32,581
and then it rotated toward the national one 1.

1900
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:34,024
In the national one 1 had a traffic light

1901
01:13:34,093 --> 01:13:36,118
at some 800m of distance.

1902
01:13:36,196 --> 01:13:37,458
We had a lot of time.

1903
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:39,930
It is here where they

1904
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:43,093
to reach Dog, to put on in parallel,

1905
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:46,468
going to the west. Them to the left,
Dog to the right.

1906
01:13:46,539 --> 01:13:48,166
I took the machine gun
and I shot to the wheels

1907
01:13:48,241 --> 01:13:50,709
trying to fly them.
It lost the control of the car

1908
01:13:50,777 --> 01:13:53,337
and almost it collides with a wall,
but Io controlled.

1909
01:13:53,413 --> 01:13:54,573
He/she returned to the road.

1910
01:13:54,647 --> 01:13:56,740
In that moment they came closer
to the national one 1.

1911
01:13:56,816 --> 01:13:58,977
There we were, near the red light.

1912
01:13:59,052 --> 01:14:00,576
There was a gas station to the right.

1913
01:14:00,653 --> 01:14:02,348
When coming closer to the national one 1

1914
01:14:02,422 --> 01:14:04,549
Dog cuts for the gas station,

1915
01:14:04,624 --> 01:14:08,287
they go enough express,
he/she leaves to the north for the national one 1,

1916
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:11,091
and there it loses to the type that shot him/her.

1917
01:14:11,164 --> 01:14:13,564
We look for for all sides, non Io saw.

1918
01:14:13,633 --> 01:14:15,567
We left and we said:

1919
01:14:15,635 --> 01:14:17,728
"We ruin" it.

1920
01:14:17,804 --> 01:14:19,897
Griselda me Ilama the following day.

1921
01:14:20,069 --> 01:14:21,798
And he/she says: They "murdered their son.

1922
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:24,964
"He/she was sleeping in the back part

1923
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,304
"and the bullets crossed the cajuela

1924
01:14:27,376 --> 01:14:30,436
"and they gave him/her in the head."

1925
01:14:30,512 --> 01:14:32,503
I told him/her that non Io saw,
because of having him fact

1926
01:14:32,581 --> 01:14:34,412
we had never played that car.

1927
01:14:34,483 --> 01:14:37,611
He/she told me: It asked "me him to tell you

1928
01:14:37,686 --> 01:14:41,884
"that it will catch you, because he/she saw" you.

1929
01:14:41,957 --> 01:14:43,322
I told him/her that it was well.

1930
01:14:43,392 --> 01:14:45,155
Dog was a federal fugitive.

1931
01:14:45,227 --> 01:14:46,285
It was wrapped in the traffic

1932
01:14:46,362 --> 01:14:48,489
and there was an arrest order
of the Antidrug Agency.

1933
01:14:48,564 --> 01:14:50,794
For that reason he/she didn't go

1934
01:14:50,866 --> 01:14:52,731
to denounce the fact to the police.

1935
01:14:52,801 --> 01:14:56,931
He/she returned to their house,
it put to the baby in the bathtub.

1936
01:14:57,006 --> 01:14:57,995
Ilenó of ice

1937
01:14:58,073 --> 01:14:59,870
Io could preserve this way the whole afternoon.

1938
01:14:59,942 --> 01:15:01,739
ÉI and their wife
the whole afternoon Ilorando happened

1939
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:04,108
with the baby in the bathtub.

1940
01:15:04,179 --> 01:15:06,170
The following day, Ilamaron to the police

1941
01:15:06,248 --> 01:15:10,014
to warn us where the body to find.

1942
01:15:10,085 --> 01:15:13,054
These are Ilamadas that Jesús made

1943
01:15:13,122 --> 01:15:14,111
to the room of complaints.

1944
01:15:14,189 --> 01:15:16,783
"Please,
I have just left the body without life

1945
01:15:16,859 --> 01:15:18,520
"of the baby that you/they killed yesterday.

1946
01:15:18,594 --> 01:15:20,027
"Excuse, yesterday some bandits

1947
01:15:20,095 --> 01:15:21,653
"in a white van

1948
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:23,425
"they shot me with a machine gun

1949
01:15:23,499 --> 01:15:25,399
"and the boy was seated and Io killed

1950
01:15:25,467 --> 01:15:27,765
"in the avenue Seventh and the street 53.

1951
01:15:27,836 --> 01:15:29,497
"The boy's body that you/they killed yesterday,

1952
01:15:29,571 --> 01:15:30,697
"the bandits."

1953
01:15:30,773 --> 01:15:31,933
This is the mosque

1954
01:15:32,007 --> 01:15:34,703
where they left
the body of Johnnie Castro.

1955
01:15:34,777 --> 01:15:36,369
Dog looked for the church

1956
01:15:36,445 --> 01:15:39,414
where they had confirmed
to Johnnie months before.

1957
01:15:39,481 --> 01:15:40,743
Not he/she could find it

1958
01:15:40,816 --> 01:15:42,010
and this was Io better than it got.

1959
01:15:42,084 --> 01:15:44,314
He/she found this mosque
in the same neighborhood.

1960
01:15:44,386 --> 01:15:48,914
The boy was wrapped in a sheet.

1961
01:15:48,991 --> 01:15:51,960
There were three roses in their hands.

1962
01:15:52,027 --> 01:15:55,019
A rose for each anus of life,

1963
01:15:55,097 --> 01:15:58,032
and I believe that a passport.

1964
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,795
Here it is.

1965
01:15:59,868 --> 01:16:03,065
He/she knew that they needed the passport
to prove who was.

1966
01:16:03,138 --> 01:16:06,164
He/she was born March 10 1979,

1967
01:16:06,241 --> 01:16:10,575
so he/she almost had three years...

1968
01:16:10,646 --> 01:16:12,443
almost three years.

1969
01:16:12,514 --> 01:16:14,641
We realized that it was Colombian

1970
01:16:14,716 --> 01:16:16,240
for the passport, etc.

1971
01:16:16,318 --> 01:16:17,910
We call the sergeant Singleton,

1972
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:19,510
of CENTAC and to their people.

1973
01:16:19,588 --> 01:16:21,613
We knew that it was
Griselda Blanco and their people.

1974
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:23,851
We obtained the name of Riverita,

1975
01:16:23,926 --> 01:16:25,894
but he/she swims in short,
not even a picture

1976
01:16:25,961 --> 01:16:27,895
that he/she says: "This is the one that we look for."

1977
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:29,828
Anything of that.

1978
01:16:29,898 --> 01:16:33,026
I don't remember another case
where they killed a boy.

1979
01:16:33,102 --> 01:16:35,263
To small Johnnie Castro

1980
01:16:35,337 --> 01:16:37,202
Io killed to be close

1981
01:16:37,272 --> 01:16:40,730
of their father, a looked for Colombian

1982
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:43,334
for some of the Horsemen of the Cocaine.

1983
01:16:43,412 --> 01:16:45,073
I was a policeman beginner.

1984
01:16:45,147 --> 01:16:47,638
He/she made less than an anus that was there

1985
01:16:47,716 --> 01:16:51,152
and my son had
almost the same age then.

1986
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:52,744
People ask me

1987
01:16:52,821 --> 01:16:54,311
if it bothers me to see the bodies.

1988
01:16:54,389 --> 01:16:57,381
Never, except for this case.

1989
01:16:57,459 --> 01:17:00,917
That hit me very hard

1990
01:17:00,996 --> 01:17:03,521
because he/she had children of that age.

1991
01:17:03,599 --> 01:17:05,692
He/she was an innocent, innocent baby.

1992
01:17:05,767 --> 01:17:07,359
Griselda said: "To the carajo,

1993
01:17:07,436 --> 01:17:09,131
"at least we gave" him/her.

1994
01:17:09,204 --> 01:17:10,728
Io not even complained.

1995
01:17:10,806 --> 01:17:12,569
To her... he didn't care anything.

1996
01:17:12,641 --> 01:17:14,165
Although the Colombians were wild

1997
01:17:14,243 --> 01:17:15,540
in the way in that you/they made the things,

1998
01:17:15,611 --> 01:17:18,079
she made them in a stupid way.

1999
01:17:18,147 --> 01:17:19,273
But it bothered a lot of people,

2000
01:17:19,348 --> 01:17:20,713
not alone in EE UU,

2001
01:17:20,782 --> 01:17:22,147
but to people in Colombia.

2002
01:17:22,217 --> 01:17:24,151
All said
that she was outside of control

2003
01:17:24,219 --> 01:17:26,084
and that it would ruin the business of all.

2004
01:17:26,155 --> 01:17:28,953
Ochoa told him/her that alone it killed

2005
01:17:29,024 --> 01:17:30,389
to those involved,

2006
01:17:30,459 --> 01:17:32,654
and that he/she avoided to murder to innocent.

2007
01:17:32,728 --> 01:17:34,093
The only thing that I remember

2008
01:17:34,163 --> 01:17:35,494
it is that the Colombians wanted

2009
01:17:35,564 --> 01:17:38,192
that she stayed far from Miami.

2010
01:17:38,267 --> 01:17:39,825
He/she received a lot of pressure of the other ones.

2011
01:17:39,902 --> 01:17:40,960
"To the carajo with them.

2012
01:17:41,036 --> 01:17:42,765
"Here Io that I want make.

2013
01:17:42,838 --> 01:17:45,170
"If they don't like that come me to look for."

2014
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,140
This way nomás.

2015
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:49,575
He/she heard conversations in Spanish with Rafa

2016
01:17:49,645 --> 01:17:50,942
because I was in the house.

2017
01:17:51,013 --> 01:17:52,537
"!Prostitute's daughter!

2018
01:17:52,614 --> 01:17:55,674
"!Another time makes me same Io!
?Now what I will make?"

2019
01:17:55,751 --> 01:17:57,378
He/she knew that him Ilamaría to Colombia

2020
01:17:57,452 --> 01:17:58,680
and he/she would ask them

2021
01:17:58,754 --> 01:18:00,312
what he/she should make, but this woman

2022
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:02,482
he/she always survived, because it

2023
01:18:02,558 --> 01:18:06,426
to have died a lot of time before,
much.

2024
01:18:06,495 --> 01:18:07,928
And of turn to the work.

2025
01:18:09,898 --> 01:18:11,422
Riverita...

2026
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,627
he/she transformed into their favorite assassin.

2027
01:18:13,702 --> 01:18:15,431
As if it was security.

2028
01:18:15,504 --> 01:18:16,994
As if it was the boss of security.

2029
01:18:17,072 --> 01:18:18,539
Nobody knew where he/she lived but me.

2030
01:18:18,607 --> 01:18:22,236
Many of the meetings
they were in the house of Rafa, of Max.

2031
01:18:22,311 --> 01:18:24,438
In fact, I met Max in their house.

2032
01:18:24,513 --> 01:18:25,912
I was there with Griselda.

2033
01:18:25,981 --> 01:18:28,040
Starting from there, I never liked it.

2034
01:18:28,116 --> 01:18:30,311
He/she told to Griselda
that it didn't trust the damned one.

2035
01:18:30,385 --> 01:18:31,784
"Not I trust him." I told him/her:

2036
01:18:31,853 --> 01:18:33,081
"If you don't go away,

2037
01:18:33,155 --> 01:18:34,622
"he will put you in the jail.

2038
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:36,681
"Next time that Io sees, Io kills."

2039
01:18:36,758 --> 01:18:38,248
But him you Io counted Rafa

2040
01:18:38,327 --> 01:18:39,794
and they returned with men
to make sure

2041
01:18:39,861 --> 01:18:41,226
that anything passes Max.

2042
01:18:41,296 --> 01:18:42,991
"He/she takes care of Max, he/she is my godfather."

2043
01:18:43,065 --> 01:18:45,659
"To the carajo with Max,
I will kill to the damned one."

2044
01:18:45,734 --> 01:18:47,133
"?Will you kill me?", he/she told me.

2045
01:18:47,202 --> 01:18:50,035
"Not now, yes later."

2046
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:53,438
It was necessary to respect to the type, because he/she came

2047
01:18:53,508 --> 01:18:57,137
threatening, Ileno of weapons,
with that whole people.

2048
01:18:57,212 --> 01:18:58,645
It is about a type...

2049
01:18:58,714 --> 01:19:01,512
anyone that enters with a retinue

2050
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:03,050
it is somebody important.

2051
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:05,086
Non Ilamaba the attention, you know.

2052
01:19:05,153 --> 01:19:07,178
He/she had a house in Palm Beach

2053
01:19:07,256 --> 01:19:09,349
another in San Agustín and two in Chicago.

2054
01:19:09,424 --> 01:19:11,221
He/she had many cars.

2055
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:13,124
He/she bought them to my fiancés also.

2056
01:19:13,195 --> 01:19:14,856
My wife, a couple of fiancés.

2057
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:18,024
In this life... it is necessary to have a couple.

2058
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:19,863
What wanted, Io that I liked,

2059
01:19:19,935 --> 01:19:21,163
Io saw in the street and Io he/she bought.

2060
01:19:21,236 --> 01:19:23,227
Not he/she had to worry about the price.

2061
01:19:23,305 --> 01:19:25,705
Not I know, type world of the show...

2062
01:19:25,774 --> 01:19:27,207
That thing type.

2063
01:19:27,276 --> 01:19:28,971
It was an attractive type that he/she spoke English

2064
01:19:29,044 --> 01:19:30,636
and he/she had a lot of charisma.

2065
01:19:30,712 --> 01:19:33,408
It is one of the reasons
for those that he/she pleased him/her well.

2066
01:19:33,482 --> 01:19:34,710
I grew here.

2067
01:19:34,783 --> 01:19:36,307
Not I crossed the water

2068
01:19:36,385 --> 01:19:38,216
and I began... and they put me in the street.

2069
01:19:38,287 --> 01:19:40,983
Although it was maybe similar of bad and he/she murdered

2070
01:19:41,056 --> 01:19:42,387
to more than anyone of the other ones.

2071
01:19:42,457 --> 01:19:43,822
I am of good family,
but I grew in the street

2072
01:19:43,892 --> 01:19:45,291
in Chicago.

2073
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,260
I was a bad boy from the beginning.

2074
01:19:47,329 --> 01:19:49,354
An assassin of cold blood.

2075
01:19:49,431 --> 01:19:51,991
The truth is that I didn't fall well,

2076
01:19:52,067 --> 01:19:55,525
because he/she used to bounce...

2077
01:19:55,604 --> 01:19:58,573
about people that had murdered.

2078
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,165
Once I lowered the window
and I shot him/her with a MAC-11

2079
01:20:01,243 --> 01:20:02,437
in the face.

2080
01:20:02,511 --> 01:20:04,411
Not I want to hear: "Ah, murdered to this type

2081
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:05,605
"here, there...".

2082
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:06,978
I will murder anyone in EE UU

2083
01:20:07,049 --> 01:20:09,313
or in Europe, or where they send me, Io will make.

2084
01:20:09,384 --> 01:20:12,410
Not I want to hear their bounces on that.

2085
01:20:12,487 --> 01:20:15,047
Of those that UU worked in EE,
it was the best.

2086
01:20:15,123 --> 01:20:17,853
It was disconcerting, somehow

2087
01:20:17,926 --> 01:20:20,451
because he was this woman's assassin

2088
01:20:20,529 --> 01:20:22,895
or Io that is that it was.

2089
01:20:22,964 --> 01:20:24,329
During the years 82 and 84,

2090
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:26,993
he was who she used

2091
01:20:27,069 --> 01:20:30,596
exclusively for their murders.

2092
01:20:30,672 --> 01:20:31,764
My reputation was

2093
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:35,037
that if it was behind you, it would catch you.

2094
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:37,078
If you escape, I will catch you.

2095
01:20:37,145 --> 01:20:38,373
If there was a debt to get paid,

2096
01:20:38,447 --> 01:20:40,142
he took charge of charging it.

2097
01:20:40,215 --> 01:20:42,945
Many clients said
that they were late

2098
01:20:43,018 --> 01:20:44,178
and she told them: "If you don't come tomorrow,

2099
01:20:44,252 --> 01:20:45,276
"Rivi will go for you."

2100
01:20:45,354 --> 01:20:46,651
"No, non Io sends."

2101
01:20:49,391 --> 01:20:52,224
Alfredo Lorenzo
he/she was client of Griselda Blanco.

2102
01:20:52,294 --> 01:20:53,784
Griselda ordered me him to give him/her

2103
01:20:53,862 --> 01:20:55,159
5 kilos of cocaine.

2104
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:58,222
Then they were 50.000 dollars each one,
at 250 each 30 grams.

2105
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:00,393
They gave him/her cocaine in consignment.

2106
01:21:00,469 --> 01:21:01,902
Io made this way Griselda.

2107
01:21:01,970 --> 01:21:03,665
"? How many days do you need to pay me?"

2108
01:21:03,739 --> 01:21:06,936
"One week."
"I will give you two weeks."

2109
01:21:07,008 --> 01:21:10,637
When the two weeks passed,
he/she no longer wanted the money,

2110
01:21:10,712 --> 01:21:12,304
but the person's life.

2111
01:21:12,381 --> 01:21:14,110
To Rivi Io sent to charge the debt.

2112
01:21:14,182 --> 01:21:16,241
I went to their house to look for the money.

2113
01:21:16,318 --> 01:21:18,445
And alone he/she gave me excuses.

2114
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,818
"Tell him/her that he/she gives me more credit

2115
01:21:20,889 --> 01:21:22,550
"and I will return him/her the money."

2116
01:21:22,624 --> 01:21:26,424
I didn't tell him/her anything, the type gave me pity.

2117
01:21:26,495 --> 01:21:28,190
Rivi realized that Lorenzo

2118
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:30,823
it played with him.

2119
01:21:30,899 --> 01:21:32,560
So you Io informed Griselda.

2120
01:21:32,634 --> 01:21:35,626
He/she told me: Io that you should make" "already know.

2121
01:21:35,704 --> 01:21:38,537
Their destination was written.

2122
01:21:38,607 --> 01:21:41,940
With Griselda, if you didn't pay, you died.

2123
01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:45,776
Until the mafia he/she would have
a class of code of honor.

2124
01:21:45,847 --> 01:21:48,441
The Italian would be about solving

2125
01:21:48,517 --> 01:21:50,451
how to recover the money.

2126
01:21:50,519 --> 01:21:53,283
Maybe later, they would give him/her a beating

2127
01:21:53,355 --> 01:21:55,880
but three weeks later it would heal.

2128
01:21:55,957 --> 01:21:58,949
When Colombian Ilegaron,
the beatings finished.

2129
01:21:59,027 --> 01:22:01,461
Those Latins of hot blood

2130
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:02,554
they don't think first.

2131
01:22:02,631 --> 01:22:04,656
First act and they think later.

2132
01:22:04,733 --> 01:22:06,530
Although they murdered to the whole family

2133
01:22:06,601 --> 01:22:08,034
then there they would think:

2134
01:22:08,103 --> 01:22:09,661
"Skies, I finish of...

2135
01:22:09,738 --> 01:22:11,205
"? How will I recover the money?".

2136
01:22:11,273 --> 01:22:12,934
And it is too much afternoon to recover it.

2137
01:22:13,008 --> 01:22:14,908
Not it is for the money,
but to send a message.

2138
01:22:14,976 --> 01:22:16,910
"Don't swindle me, don't enter with me,

2139
01:22:16,978 --> 01:22:18,912
"because I will kill you or I will make them to kill you."

2140
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:22,040
He/she said: "Kill them."
And him Io made.

2141
01:22:25,821 --> 01:22:29,086
Miguel was to my right,
Oscar Murillo, Born,

2142
01:22:29,157 --> 01:22:30,988
to the left, and I hit the door.

2143
01:22:31,059 --> 01:22:32,219
Alfredo opens the door

2144
01:22:32,294 --> 01:22:34,159
and when Io ago
I put him/her the weapon in the ribs.

2145
01:22:34,229 --> 01:22:36,129
It points out him/her that he/she doesn't make noise.

2146
01:22:36,198 --> 01:22:37,187
I ask him/her for the wife.

2147
01:22:37,265 --> 01:22:38,789
He/she said that he/she was cooking.

2148
01:22:38,867 --> 01:22:40,357
I went until her and he/she tells me:

2149
01:22:40,435 --> 01:22:42,266
"Not I know Io what it happens,

2150
01:22:42,337 --> 01:22:44,362
"but I ask him/her him not to hurt my children."

2151
01:22:44,439 --> 01:22:46,999
Three children, two daughters, a son.

2152
01:22:47,075 --> 01:22:49,873
I believe that the daughters had 6 and 4 years.

2153
01:22:49,945 --> 01:22:52,345
And the son was a baby.

2154
01:22:52,414 --> 01:22:54,644
I said: "No, I won't hurt your children."

2155
01:22:54,716 --> 01:22:57,310
Griselda had told me that he/she murdered them.

2156
01:22:57,385 --> 01:22:59,853
I supposed that single Io would kill him.

2157
01:22:59,921 --> 01:23:01,513
He/she spoke with her and I heard two shots,

2158
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:03,785
a couple... Io that happened knew.

2159
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:05,850
Miguel had killed Alfredo.

2160
01:23:12,334 --> 01:23:15,132
I requested to Oscar that watched over her,
that he/she would return.

2161
01:23:15,203 --> 01:23:16,568
I went to the other room.

2162
01:23:16,638 --> 01:23:19,573
I asked to Miguel if it was made,

2163
01:23:19,641 --> 01:23:21,632
and he/she told me that yes.

2164
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:24,702
When we were speaking, I heard a scream

2165
01:23:24,779 --> 01:23:26,178
and then I heard a metralleta.

2166
01:23:27,549 --> 01:23:28,743
I returned to the room

2167
01:23:28,817 --> 01:23:31,115
and he told me: "She was about being thrown above."

2168
01:23:31,186 --> 01:23:34,383
Oscar had shot him/her
10, 15 times in the chest

2169
01:23:34,456 --> 01:23:36,686
and she continued alive, making...

2170
01:23:36,758 --> 01:23:39,318
some strange noises,
it left him/her blood of the mouth,

2171
01:23:39,394 --> 01:23:42,124
he/she was dying.
I grabbed Miguel's weapon,

2172
01:23:42,197 --> 01:23:45,166
a.380 with muffler and I shot him/her

2173
01:23:45,233 --> 01:23:49,294
twice in the head
so that he/she stopped to suffer.

2174
01:23:51,106 --> 01:23:52,937
I told them that we left.

2175
01:23:53,008 --> 01:23:54,873
But Griselda said it to Miguel

2176
01:23:54,943 --> 01:23:57,275
that it was necessary to kill all.

2177
01:23:57,345 --> 01:23:58,505
I asked him/her of what he/she spoke.

2178
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:02,516
"Alone they are the children."

2179
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:04,108
And he/she tells me that he/she will murder the children.

2180
01:24:04,185 --> 01:24:05,652
I told him/her that non Io made.

2181
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:06,709
"She told me

2182
01:24:06,788 --> 01:24:07,720
"that they are worth extra,

2183
01:24:07,789 --> 01:24:08,983
"so I will win myself the money."

2184
01:24:09,057 --> 01:24:10,957
I told him/her that it would not kill the children.

2185
01:24:11,026 --> 01:24:14,223
And he/she leaves in address to the children.

2186
01:24:14,296 --> 01:24:15,422
I took out my weapon and I told him/her

2187
01:24:15,497 --> 01:24:16,896
that you outside of the house.

2188
01:24:16,965 --> 01:24:18,956
Miguel became crazy:
"We have to kill the girl."

2189
01:24:19,034 --> 01:24:21,798
I said: "No, coarse.

2190
01:24:21,870 --> 01:24:23,861
"It is hour of leaving of here."

2191
01:24:23,939 --> 01:24:27,705
I had to take out them to gun tip.

2192
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,801
Alfredo and Griselda Lorenzo

2193
01:24:29,878 --> 01:24:30,936
they were opposing dead

2194
01:24:31,012 --> 01:24:33,412
in June of 1982 in their house.

2195
01:24:33,481 --> 01:24:36,109
It was a modest house
in the area of Rhodes.

2196
01:24:36,184 --> 01:24:40,245
In 1982 it had returned to CENTAC.

2197
01:24:40,322 --> 01:24:43,291
I received Nelson's Ilamada Andrew,

2198
01:24:43,358 --> 01:24:46,088
that he/she was a detective
of homicides of Miami.

2199
01:24:46,161 --> 01:24:47,753
The bodies were in different rooms,

2200
01:24:47,829 --> 01:24:49,296
and who made the homicide

2201
01:24:49,364 --> 01:24:51,355
he/she left the children in the house

2202
01:24:51,433 --> 01:24:52,866
with their dead parents. They found

2203
01:24:52,934 --> 01:24:54,799
to the girls and the boy

2204
01:24:54,869 --> 01:24:58,498
playing with the body
bloodstained of the mother

2205
01:24:58,573 --> 01:25:01,007
inside the house.

2206
01:25:01,076 --> 01:25:03,943
They paid us and I explained to him/her.

2207
01:25:04,012 --> 01:25:06,207
I told him/her that there were not
murdered the children.

2208
01:25:06,281 --> 01:25:08,806
He/she got angry and he/she said:
"The order was to kill all."

2209
01:25:08,883 --> 01:25:10,578
When she says all, they are all.

2210
01:25:10,652 --> 01:25:12,552
I told him/her that he/she had made the decision

2211
01:25:12,621 --> 01:25:14,987
of not killing them.
"?Why?"

2212
01:25:15,056 --> 01:25:18,253
"Because they are babies."

2213
01:25:18,326 --> 01:25:19,623
After Johnnie Castro,

2214
01:25:19,694 --> 01:25:20,922
when they killed the boy,

2215
01:25:20,996 --> 01:25:22,896
I believe that he/she got used after it.

2216
01:25:22,964 --> 01:25:25,330
You already know, to murder children.

2217
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:26,890
He liked to be in war.

2218
01:25:26,968 --> 01:25:28,458
He/she spoke every day of it.

2219
01:25:28,536 --> 01:25:30,231
We have to catch to such and to which,

2220
01:25:30,305 --> 01:25:32,034
we have to eliminate it.

2221
01:25:32,674 --> 01:25:35,108
It was... it was something that she enjoyed.

2222
01:25:35,176 --> 01:25:37,007
He/she went to the war with Paco Mejía,

2223
01:25:37,078 --> 01:25:38,875
who was their assassin years behind.

2224
01:25:38,947 --> 01:25:41,211
It seems to be that it swindled her
and he/she put on for their bill.

2225
01:25:41,282 --> 01:25:43,182
And he/she declared the war to Griselda.

2226
01:25:43,251 --> 01:25:45,617
Official of homicides
they discovered weeks ago

2227
01:25:45,687 --> 01:25:48,850
that a great load
of cocaine valued in millions

2228
01:25:48,923 --> 01:25:51,448
that he/she came from Colombia, never Ilegó.

2229
01:25:51,526 --> 01:25:53,858
The police says that he/she went to New York.

2230
01:25:53,928 --> 01:25:57,420
That is one of the things
that he/she didn't forget neither he/she forgave.

2231
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,134
I go to New York to kill all

2232
01:26:01,202 --> 01:26:03,966
those that worked for Paco Mejía.

2233
01:26:05,707 --> 01:26:07,038
It broke all the rules there.

2234
01:26:07,108 --> 01:26:09,303
I spoke with a person that told me:

2235
01:26:09,377 --> 01:26:10,742
"There will be a bathroom of blood."

2236
01:26:10,812 --> 01:26:16,375
Of those that kept the drug,
to the assassins. We kill at 11.

2237
01:26:16,451 --> 01:26:21,218
Eleven people. Mm.
In less than 24 hours.

2238
01:26:21,289 --> 01:26:24,747
They should have been 12,
but I allowed to escape to one.

2239
01:26:24,826 --> 01:26:27,590
The detectives
they are in contact with New York

2240
01:26:27,662 --> 01:26:30,597
to investigate the similarities
among this blow

2241
01:26:30,665 --> 01:26:33,862
in the area of New York
and the murders for drug

2242
01:26:33,935 --> 01:26:35,698
here in Florida of the South.

2243
01:26:35,770 --> 01:26:37,533
The war began.

2244
01:26:39,107 --> 01:26:40,540
Griselda took the first step.

2245
01:26:40,608 --> 01:26:42,701
We are in the commercial center America.

2246
01:26:42,777 --> 01:26:45,405
In 1981 you Ilamaba Bread-American.

2247
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,107
We arrive and I put the cars

2248
01:26:47,182 --> 01:26:48,308
where he/she wanted them.

2249
01:26:48,383 --> 01:26:51,113
This is the scene of the homicide
of Octavio Mejía,

2250
01:26:51,186 --> 01:26:52,414
Paco's father.

2251
01:26:52,487 --> 01:26:56,184
When Mejía left the commercial center...

2252
01:26:56,257 --> 01:26:58,122
Io ambushed.

2253
01:26:58,193 --> 01:27:01,287
They shot him/her several times,
different marksmen.

2254
01:27:01,362 --> 01:27:03,057
A lot of people were angry,

2255
01:27:03,131 --> 01:27:05,793
because he was not part
of the war between Paco and Griselda.

2256
01:27:05,867 --> 01:27:07,732
Many got angry with Griselda.

2257
01:27:07,802 --> 01:27:09,963
It became more enemy, but he didn't care.

2258
01:27:10,038 --> 01:27:11,300
He liked that.

2259
01:27:11,372 --> 01:27:14,307
Not he/she knew that Paco, his son, was there.

2260
01:27:14,375 --> 01:27:17,208
It was in the car
when their father entered to the center.

2261
01:27:17,278 --> 01:27:19,109
It was angry because non Io saw.

2262
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:20,511
It will catch it otherwise.

2263
01:27:20,582 --> 01:27:22,345
They happened to us the fact that he/she had a house

2264
01:27:22,417 --> 01:27:24,612
in Killian Parkway. Griselda tells me:

2265
01:27:24,686 --> 01:27:26,210
"Not you will wander this time?no?".

2266
01:27:26,287 --> 01:27:27,811
"No, I will fly the house."

2267
01:27:27,889 --> 01:27:29,151
He/she said: ?" What are you saying?".

2268
01:27:29,224 --> 01:27:31,624
"I will put a bomb,
I will kill all", I said.

2269
01:27:31,693 --> 01:27:34,287
I got 200 cartridges of dynamite.

2270
01:27:34,362 --> 01:27:35,954
The explosion was tremendous.

2271
01:27:38,233 --> 01:27:40,997
Him first that it flew it was the roof.

2272
01:27:41,069 --> 01:27:43,037
The house one came below.

2273
01:27:46,207 --> 01:27:47,401
The neighbors wondered

2274
01:27:47,475 --> 01:27:49,943
what it had ruined
the neighborhood's cars.

2275
01:27:50,011 --> 01:27:53,378
The windows were broken.

2276
01:27:53,448 --> 01:27:54,847
He/she wanted to hear the good news

2277
01:27:54,916 --> 01:27:56,611
that they found somebody.

2278
01:27:56,684 --> 01:28:00,586
It turned out to be that I missed it.
The house was empty.

2279
01:28:04,058 --> 01:28:06,185
It was more a skirmish

2280
01:28:06,261 --> 01:28:09,890
in the conflict Griselda Blanco-Mejía.

2281
01:28:09,964 --> 01:28:11,761
Two weeks later, found out

2282
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:14,063
that Paco Mejía
it was in a flight to Miami

2283
01:28:14,135 --> 01:28:17,366
and it was alone. Griselda says:

2284
01:28:17,438 --> 01:28:18,962
"We will catch it in the airport.

2285
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,804
"You Io will make." Of under the table it takes out

2286
01:28:21,876 --> 01:28:24,709
a bayonet of 40 cm.

2287
01:28:24,779 --> 01:28:26,110
"I want that Io matés with this."

2288
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:27,705
He/she wanted that Io stabbed.

2289
01:28:27,782 --> 01:28:30,910
"? What is this?
? Do we change style?", I told him/her.

2290
01:28:30,985 --> 01:28:34,716
They told him/her "the pig"
and he/she wanted him to die as such.

2291
01:28:34,789 --> 01:28:37,417
He/she offered me half million of dollars.

2292
01:28:37,492 --> 01:28:39,460
But he/she had to catch it inside.

2293
01:28:39,527 --> 01:28:41,722
I told him/her that he/she would not enter to the airport.

2294
01:28:41,796 --> 01:28:43,388
"It is a suicide mission.

2295
01:28:43,464 --> 01:28:44,829
"Not I make those things."

2296
01:28:44,899 --> 01:28:46,890
Max Mermelstein and Riverita

2297
01:28:46,968 --> 01:28:49,664
they advised him/her that he/she didn't give that blow.

2298
01:28:49,737 --> 01:28:51,398
Not I will enter to the airport

2299
01:28:51,472 --> 01:28:53,906
to stab him
because I don't want to go to the jail.

2300
01:28:53,975 --> 01:28:55,875
It must be another.
"I already have to other", he/she said.

2301
01:28:55,944 --> 01:28:57,673
He/she told me that he/she was Miguel.

2302
01:28:57,745 --> 01:28:59,110
Miguel Pérez, Miguelito.

2303
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:01,648
Miguelito was as Rivi, but without class.

2304
01:29:01,716 --> 01:29:04,116
Miguel told me that if the pay was good

2305
01:29:04,185 --> 01:29:05,447
he/she would enter to the White House

2306
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:06,452
and it would kill the president.

2307
01:29:06,521 --> 01:29:08,318
This picture took it

2308
01:29:08,389 --> 01:29:09,856
soon after of Ilegar

2309
01:29:09,924 --> 01:29:12,188
in 1982 in Mariel.

2310
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:13,488
It was one of the most fearful types

2311
01:29:13,561 --> 01:29:15,495
that I knew in my career.

2312
01:29:15,563 --> 01:29:17,588
It began them to him
to know as the marielitos

2313
01:29:17,665 --> 01:29:18,893
the intrepid marielitos.

2314
01:29:18,967 --> 01:29:20,264
Physically, it intimidated.

2315
01:29:20,335 --> 01:29:23,361
It was bigger
and he/she had more force than Rivi.

2316
01:29:23,438 --> 01:29:25,770
It is the type class that one thinks

2317
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,172
that it could become crazy suddenly

2318
01:29:28,243 --> 01:29:30,074
and that it could leave the neck.

2319
01:29:30,144 --> 01:29:31,702
I spoke with Miguel and it accepted.

2320
01:29:31,779 --> 01:29:33,371
He/she told me that they would give him/her

2321
01:29:33,448 --> 01:29:36,383
250.000 dollars and a house
to catch it in the airport.

2322
01:29:36,451 --> 01:29:38,180
I told him/her that if he/she entered,

2323
01:29:38,253 --> 01:29:39,550
it won't support it.

2324
01:29:39,621 --> 01:29:42,522
Miguelito didn't care it and single Io made.

2325
01:29:42,590 --> 01:29:43,989
"The only thing that I will make for you,

2326
01:29:44,058 --> 01:29:45,821
"it will be to show you who Paco is."

2327
01:29:45,894 --> 01:29:47,828
They knew in what flight it was,
when it arrived.

2328
01:29:47,896 --> 01:29:50,057
And Io was waiting.

2329
01:29:50,131 --> 01:29:52,258
Well, there Paco came

2330
01:29:52,333 --> 01:29:53,960
and Io last that he/she waited

2331
01:29:54,035 --> 01:29:55,161
it was that a black Io attacked.

2332
01:29:55,236 --> 01:29:57,704
While it left customs

2333
01:29:57,772 --> 01:29:59,603
a man comes closer with a bayonet.

2334
01:29:59,674 --> 01:30:01,574
Miguel comes from behind

2335
01:30:01,643 --> 01:30:03,008
Io grabs with force, Io rises

2336
01:30:03,077 --> 01:30:04,203
and Io knifes.

2337
01:30:04,279 --> 01:30:06,611
It used the bayonet several times.

2338
01:30:06,681 --> 01:30:08,046
I counted 6 or 7 times.

2339
01:30:08,116 --> 01:30:09,708
All in the airport

2340
01:30:09,784 --> 01:30:11,547
they were with the open mouth.

2341
01:30:11,619 --> 01:30:13,951
They were in shock, nobody said anything.

2342
01:30:14,022 --> 01:30:16,422
The ribbon to the floor and he/she leaves running.

2343
01:30:16,491 --> 01:30:18,083
AIlí began to scream.

2344
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:20,889
The police ran
until the place of the incident,

2345
01:30:20,962 --> 01:30:23,487
they pointed out them toward where Miguel escaped

2346
01:30:23,564 --> 01:30:26,124
and Io caught at once.

2347
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:27,895
One of them approaches Miguel,

2348
01:30:27,969 --> 01:30:29,834
that he/she falls to a meter of me

2349
01:30:29,904 --> 01:30:31,963
and Miguel looks at me as requesting help

2350
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,234
with the eyes.

2351
01:30:33,308 --> 01:30:35,173
I denied with the head and I said that not.

2352
01:30:35,243 --> 01:30:36,540
Not he/she could make anything.

2353
01:30:36,611 --> 01:30:39,136
The policemen came from all sides.

2354
01:30:39,213 --> 01:30:42,148
You Io Ilevaron and we leave.

2355
01:30:42,216 --> 01:30:44,081
This was too much, because this place,

2356
01:30:44,152 --> 01:30:46,484
even then, policemen's Ileno was.

2357
01:30:46,554 --> 01:30:48,112
There were policemen in each esplanade.

2358
01:30:48,189 --> 01:30:51,352
To attempt something like that

2359
01:30:51,426 --> 01:30:53,553
it was a madness, and obviously

2360
01:30:53,628 --> 01:30:55,118
it was this way, because Io caught.

2361
01:30:55,196 --> 01:30:57,221
It was this way Miguelito,

2362
01:30:57,298 --> 01:30:59,129
he didn't care it.
He/she had work to make,

2363
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,758
Io that is... to murder,

2364
01:31:00,835 --> 01:31:02,632
and him Io ago.

2365
01:31:02,704 --> 01:31:04,638
But Paco survived,

2366
01:31:04,706 --> 01:31:08,301
and they sentenced Miguel
for murder intent.

2367
01:31:08,376 --> 01:31:10,276
I believe that they gave him/her 15 years.

2368
01:31:10,345 --> 01:31:13,007
The last time that I saw Miguel was.

2369
01:31:13,081 --> 01:31:15,879
I believe that that it was the last exaggeration

2370
01:31:15,950 --> 01:31:19,249
of the war Mejía-Griselda Blanco.

2371
01:31:23,891 --> 01:31:28,692
Griselda Blanco was the catalyst
so that the government

2372
01:31:28,763 --> 01:31:30,560
of EE UU recognized

2373
01:31:30,631 --> 01:31:32,792
that Miami had serious problems,

2374
01:31:32,867 --> 01:31:35,028
that in fact
we were as Dodge City.

2375
01:31:35,103 --> 01:31:36,536
It was outside of control.

2376
01:31:36,604 --> 01:31:39,266
Créase or not, when one murders people

2377
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:41,308
a lot of pressure of it is received.

2378
01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:43,037
You have the hen of the eggs of gold.

2379
01:31:43,111 --> 01:31:44,601
?Why to enter with her?

2380
01:31:44,679 --> 01:31:46,112
Everything was for blame of the violence.

2381
01:31:46,180 --> 01:31:48,114
Not it was for the quantity of drugs,

2382
01:31:48,182 --> 01:31:50,309
they didn't have idea of the quantity that Ilegaba.

2383
01:31:50,385 --> 01:31:51,977
They formed special groups.

2384
01:31:52,053 --> 01:31:54,681
An antidrug group

2385
01:31:54,756 --> 01:31:56,485
well-known as CENTAC 26.

2386
01:31:56,557 --> 01:31:58,149
These types pursued me...

2387
01:31:58,226 --> 01:32:00,956
? Who rays were?
He/she not even knew

2388
01:32:01,029 --> 01:32:02,553
who were.
?From where did they come?

2389
01:32:02,630 --> 01:32:03,824
The district attorneys wait

2390
01:32:03,898 --> 01:32:07,095
to carry out arrests for drugs in the future.

2391
01:32:07,168 --> 01:32:08,328
They had chosen Reagan.

2392
01:32:08,403 --> 01:32:11,065
We need that the president
he/she comes to Dade County

2393
01:32:11,139 --> 01:32:13,369
to speak with the taxi driver's widow

2394
01:32:13,441 --> 01:32:14,738
to the one who you/they flew him/her the head.

2395
01:32:14,809 --> 01:32:16,606
The wars of the cocaine, the violence,

2396
01:32:16,677 --> 01:32:20,238
the homicides, the cover of < i > Tlme, < /i>

2397
01:32:20,314 --> 01:32:21,281
Ilevaron to the action.

2398
01:32:21,349 --> 01:32:23,249
The vice-president's forces Bush

2399
01:32:23,317 --> 01:32:25,046
to combat the crime in Florida of the South

2400
01:32:25,119 --> 01:32:27,053
they flooded federal agents' Miami.

2401
01:32:27,121 --> 01:32:30,056
It is a combined operation with the state,

2402
01:32:30,124 --> 01:32:32,888
the local police,
the coastal watch, the customs.

2403
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:36,623
Florida of the South is not able to
to be a refuge for the criminals,

2404
01:32:36,697 --> 01:32:40,030
for the organized traffickers of drugs

2405
01:32:40,101 --> 01:32:42,399
neither for the murderers to salary.

2406
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:43,869
The rest of the country

2407
01:32:43,938 --> 01:32:47,101
bill was giving
that it was not a problem of Miami,

2408
01:32:47,175 --> 01:32:48,836
it was a national problem.

2409
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:51,970
This initiative will join our resources

2410
01:32:52,046 --> 01:32:56,983
to combat the problem of the drugs
and the crime in Miami.

2411
01:32:57,051 --> 01:32:59,485
I sent him/her a telegram
to the president begging him/her

2412
01:32:59,554 --> 01:33:01,146
that it puts to the Air base Homestead

2413
01:33:01,222 --> 01:33:04,248
in foot of war to intercept, to stop

2414
01:33:04,325 --> 01:33:06,691
and to demolish, of being necessary,

2415
01:33:06,761 --> 01:33:09,389
the airplanes
secret loaded ships

2416
01:33:09,464 --> 01:33:11,557
that they try to enter drug in Florida.

2417
01:33:11,632 --> 01:33:12,963
There is a non identified ship

2418
01:33:13,034 --> 01:33:15,696
to the west of West End, Great Bahama.

2419
01:33:15,770 --> 01:33:18,705
?They can send an airplane
to identify it?

2420
01:33:18,773 --> 01:33:21,435
I received authorization

2421
01:33:21,509 --> 01:33:24,103
of the government from Colombia

2422
01:33:24,178 --> 01:33:27,272
to shoot to their ship.

2423
01:33:27,348 --> 01:33:29,316
Expert, 1-6-0, well.

2424
01:33:33,588 --> 01:33:35,180
Please, stop.

2425
01:33:35,256 --> 01:33:37,622
Tell him/her that he/she stops and Io will make.

2426
01:33:37,692 --> 01:33:39,990
They gave him/her. !Be fume, be fume!

2427
01:33:40,061 --> 01:33:42,495
The agents say
that the tests confirm

2428
01:33:42,563 --> 01:33:45,964
that they have a ton of coca
for value of 31 million dollars,

2429
01:33:46,033 --> 01:33:47,557
1000 millions in the street.

2430
01:33:47,635 --> 01:33:50,297
The quantity of drugs
confiscated in this area

2431
01:33:50,371 --> 01:33:52,771
it ascended to 2500%.

2432
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:53,966
The net weight is

2433
01:33:54,041 --> 01:33:56,532
of around 1700 kilos.

2434
01:33:56,611 --> 01:33:57,737
It is the biggest seizure

2435
01:33:57,812 --> 01:33:59,439
never carried out by the federal government.

2436
01:33:59,514 --> 01:34:02,745
He/she would say that it is more 4 times
of Io that we never made.

2437
01:34:02,817 --> 01:34:04,409
? He/she means that it is no longer possible

2438
01:34:04,485 --> 01:34:05,850
to enter drugs in EE UU?

2439
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,945
No, we didn't say that.

2440
01:34:08,022 --> 01:34:09,046
? What does he/she mean?

2441
01:34:09,123 --> 01:34:10,249
? What is Io that affirms?

2442
01:34:10,324 --> 01:34:12,485
Every time will be more difficult.

2443
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:15,085
The good news is that the index of crimes

2444
01:34:15,163 --> 01:34:17,154
low control is.

2445
01:34:17,231 --> 01:34:19,495
There is a commitment to long scale

2446
01:34:19,567 --> 01:34:21,228
on behalf of the citizens, of the government,

2447
01:34:21,302 --> 01:34:22,769
of the police and of the tribunals

2448
01:34:22,837 --> 01:34:25,670
in giving him/her it battles to the enemy.

2449
01:34:28,242 --> 01:34:29,869
!Be quiet, be quiet!

2450
01:34:29,944 --> 01:34:31,707
It was really the principle of the end

2451
01:34:31,779 --> 01:34:34,009
of the era of the Horsemen of the Cocaine.

2452
01:34:34,081 --> 01:34:36,174
The index of murders lowered from 1980.

2453
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:39,048
There was a drop of 50% in the city

2454
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:42,612
and of 30% in the outskirts.

2455
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:44,317
There were too many policemen

2456
01:34:44,392 --> 01:34:46,019
and a lot of pressure in television,

2457
01:34:46,093 --> 01:34:47,185
so I told to Griselda

2458
01:34:47,261 --> 01:34:48,888
that there was a lot of pressure,

2459
01:34:48,963 --> 01:34:50,294
that it would be better to leave vacations.

2460
01:34:50,364 --> 01:34:52,195
He/she told me that he/she planned to transfer

2461
01:34:52,266 --> 01:34:55,394
the operation to California.
"? Do you come with me, Rivi?"

2462
01:34:55,469 --> 01:34:57,528
He/she no longer wanted to continue killing,
he/she had a lot of money.

2463
01:34:57,605 --> 01:34:59,197
He/she Would Return to Chicago.

2464
01:34:59,273 --> 01:35:01,605
In retrospective, we know

2465
01:35:01,676 --> 01:35:04,543
that she left around 1984,

2466
01:35:04,612 --> 01:35:07,672
when the index of homicides
it lowered clearly.

2467
01:35:07,748 --> 01:35:09,181
It was happy of leaving

2468
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:12,481
because it was conscious
of the pressure to my around,

2469
01:35:12,553 --> 01:35:14,453
and she didn't want to understand it.

2470
01:35:14,522 --> 01:35:16,080
Seeing that the whole organization

2471
01:35:16,157 --> 01:35:19,058
he/she had moved to California

2472
01:35:19,126 --> 01:35:20,593
and that I am an agent in Miami

2473
01:35:20,661 --> 01:35:24,188
I had to convince to my superiors
that it was worthwhile

2474
01:35:24,265 --> 01:35:26,597
that he/she investigated a case in California.

2475
01:35:26,667 --> 01:35:28,191
He/she knew that it was question of time

2476
01:35:28,269 --> 01:35:29,395
before they pursued us.

2477
01:35:29,470 --> 01:35:31,062
I said that if at some time it caught it,

2478
01:35:31,138 --> 01:35:33,629
he/she would give him/her a kiss in the cheek.

2479
01:35:33,808 --> 01:35:35,366
He/she left to California

2480
01:35:35,443 --> 01:35:36,876
and their business began there.

2481
01:35:36,944 --> 01:35:39,879
Rafa didn't want
to send the product until there,

2482
01:35:39,947 --> 01:35:42,211
so she decided
to be made friend of Marta

2483
01:35:42,283 --> 01:35:43,716
to get the cocaine.

2484
01:35:43,784 --> 01:35:45,411
She was family of Ochoa.

2485
01:35:45,486 --> 01:35:47,454
"Not I need Rafa, I can get everything

2486
01:35:47,521 --> 01:35:49,887
"this way." Io made this way.

2487
01:35:49,957 --> 01:35:52,118
Max tells me: "Not there will be

2488
01:35:52,193 --> 01:35:55,060
"coca for a while,
because there are problems.

2489
01:35:55,129 --> 01:35:57,029
"Griselda decided that he/she doesn't want to pay

2490
01:35:57,098 --> 01:35:59,794
"about 1500 kilos or something like that."

2491
01:35:59,867 --> 01:36:02,358
I asked him/her
what he/she had to do with us.

2492
01:36:02,436 --> 01:36:04,996
"Ochoa doesn't want to send anything

2493
01:36:05,072 --> 01:36:07,165
"until everything gets ready."

2494
01:36:07,241 --> 01:36:09,937
Griselda tells me
that he/she wants to kill that dog.

2495
01:36:10,011 --> 01:36:12,445
"?To who?"
And he/she answers: "To this dog."

2496
01:36:12,513 --> 01:36:14,413
Griselda said that if it killed Marta,

2497
01:36:14,482 --> 01:36:15,744
there would not be any test

2498
01:36:15,816 --> 01:36:17,716
of if he/she had given the money to Marta or not

2499
01:36:17,785 --> 01:36:20,049
and of if Marta
non Io had sent to its family.

2500
01:36:20,121 --> 01:36:21,486
I told to Griselda

2501
01:36:21,555 --> 01:36:24,888
if he/she made that, it would finish with their business.

2502
01:36:24,959 --> 01:36:26,859
Not there would be place
in the world where to hide.

2503
01:36:26,927 --> 01:36:28,155
They would look for it for the rest of their life.

2504
01:36:28,229 --> 01:36:29,560
But he/she wanted to make it same.

2505
01:36:29,630 --> 01:36:31,097
I told him/her that it was not necessary.

2506
01:36:31,165 --> 01:36:33,565
It was their exit. "I Will Murder Marta

2507
01:36:33,634 --> 01:36:35,625
"and I will say that I gave him/her the money,

2508
01:36:35,703 --> 01:36:37,227
"and if they ask me,

2509
01:36:37,305 --> 01:36:39,330
"I will tell them that I don't know where
it is because you Io gave to her."

2510
01:36:39,407 --> 01:36:41,375
"Griselda? what will you make?", I told him/her.

2511
01:36:41,442 --> 01:36:43,069
He/she told me: "Murder it."

2512
01:36:43,144 --> 01:36:44,441
As soon as he/she entered and he/she saw Griselda

2513
01:36:44,512 --> 01:36:45,979
you Io made above.

2514
01:36:46,047 --> 01:36:49,016
"Godmother, Godmother,
? what have I made you?"

2515
01:36:49,083 --> 01:36:50,641
Griselda answers: "Anything."

2516
01:36:50,718 --> 01:36:52,686
They kidnapped her,
they murdered it and they found it

2517
01:36:52,753 --> 01:36:54,186
to the side of the highway.

2518
01:37:00,294 --> 01:37:03,559
It was spotted of blood,
you could not kill Marta.

2519
01:37:03,631 --> 01:37:05,531
AIlí began another war.

2520
01:37:05,599 --> 01:37:07,533
That exploited him/her in the hands.

2521
01:37:07,601 --> 01:37:08,898
All gave him/her the back.

2522
01:37:08,969 --> 01:37:10,664
Even Rafa, their best friend.

2523
01:37:10,738 --> 01:37:12,262
I remember that Rafa and the other ones...

2524
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:13,705
The other of the poster.

2525
01:37:13,774 --> 01:37:15,742
...they thought of having to kill her.

2526
01:37:15,810 --> 01:37:18,301
There was a price for the head of Griselda.

2527
01:37:18,379 --> 01:37:19,869
They told him/her that where they saw it,

2528
01:37:19,947 --> 01:37:21,881
they will catch it.

2529
01:37:24,418 --> 01:37:25,851
Max entered in problems

2530
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:27,478
and it was the principle of the end.

2531
01:37:27,555 --> 01:37:29,455
ÉI knew that he/she had a problem.

2532
01:37:29,523 --> 01:37:32,287
Not he/she should have smoked, but Io made.

2533
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:33,987
Not he/she thought that they would go behind him.

2534
01:37:34,061 --> 01:37:37,053
Max me Ilama and he/she says
that he/she believes that the police Io pursues.

2535
01:37:37,131 --> 01:37:40,225
"I will get myself into the car, I will go for walk,

2536
01:37:40,301 --> 01:37:42,769
"stay in the cellular one with me."

2537
01:37:42,837 --> 01:37:45,305
"Well, Max, I will stay to the telephone."

2538
01:37:45,373 --> 01:37:47,170
Max you gets into the car and he/she leaves.

2539
01:37:47,241 --> 01:37:48,503
It leaves the entrance and he/she tells me

2540
01:37:48,576 --> 01:37:51,340
that they came from all sides.

2541
01:37:51,412 --> 01:37:52,902
I knew that low surveillance was.

2542
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:55,107
The cars blocked my exit

2543
01:37:55,182 --> 01:37:57,912
and when I realized,
there were 40 weapons aiming me.

2544
01:37:57,985 --> 01:37:59,350
End of the conversation.

2545
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:02,184
They arrested him and more Io never saw.

2546
01:38:02,256 --> 01:38:03,655
He/she had millions of dollars

2547
01:38:03,724 --> 01:38:05,555
buried in bags in my garden.

2548
01:38:05,626 --> 01:38:07,218
That night I went out with a lantern

2549
01:38:07,294 --> 01:38:10,058
to take out the bags,
because he/she feared that they came.

2550
01:38:10,131 --> 01:38:11,655
He/she lived in the area of Everglades.

2551
01:38:11,732 --> 01:38:13,723
I jumped in a canoe like with...

2552
01:38:13,801 --> 01:38:15,462
I don't know how many...
between 6 and 8 million dollars,

2553
01:38:15,536 --> 01:38:17,060
I threw them in the canoe, I rowed to the other side

2554
01:38:17,138 --> 01:38:19,038
and I buried them
in the National Park of Everglades

2555
01:38:19,106 --> 01:38:20,630
because he/she believed that they came to my house.

2556
01:38:20,708 --> 01:38:22,573
But nobody came neither it passed anything.

2557
01:38:22,643 --> 01:38:24,372
Nobody believed that there would be problems.

2558
01:38:24,445 --> 01:38:25,776
Mickey and the other ones said

2559
01:38:25,846 --> 01:38:27,313
that there were not problems

2560
01:38:27,381 --> 01:38:28,678
with the last airplane that landed

2561
01:38:28,749 --> 01:38:30,080
and that everything seemed to be well.

2562
01:38:30,151 --> 01:38:32,016
I told them that we continued

2563
01:38:32,086 --> 01:38:34,077
until Io discovered.

2564
01:38:34,155 --> 01:38:37,181
Jon said that there was not
I motivate to worry.

2565
01:38:37,258 --> 01:38:39,192
We believed that Jon was very intelligent.

2566
01:38:44,398 --> 01:38:45,365
September 20 1986

2567
01:38:45,433 --> 01:38:47,060
I remember September 20

2568
01:38:47,134 --> 01:38:49,261
because he/she could not sleep.

2569
01:38:49,336 --> 01:38:50,997
That night in particular

2570
01:38:51,071 --> 01:38:52,834
he/she worked with Mickey and their people.

2571
01:38:52,907 --> 01:38:55,603
And because he/she could not sleep, I decided to leave

2572
01:38:55,676 --> 01:38:57,974
to the radio room that we had

2573
01:38:58,045 --> 01:39:00,775
in Miami, to direct to the airplanes.

2574
01:39:00,848 --> 01:39:03,248
They were the regular trips, unique unusual Io

2575
01:39:03,317 --> 01:39:04,648
that we should have noticed,

2576
01:39:04,718 --> 01:39:06,083
it was the silence in the radio

2577
01:39:06,153 --> 01:39:08,621
because they knew that we listened everything.

2578
01:39:08,689 --> 01:39:10,554
I looked around when I left,

2579
01:39:10,624 --> 01:39:12,455
because paranoiac continued for Io of Max,

2580
01:39:12,526 --> 01:39:15,359
and I didn't see he/she swims at all.

2581
01:39:15,429 --> 01:39:18,364
Everything followed their course.

2582
01:39:18,432 --> 01:39:20,957
The airplane landed and I said: Good "other trip,

2583
01:39:21,035 --> 01:39:22,935
"I leave home, I feel well."

2584
01:39:23,003 --> 01:39:24,197
As soon as it landed

2585
01:39:24,271 --> 01:39:25,704
and he/she entered to the barn,

2586
01:39:25,773 --> 01:39:27,968
they appeared in helicopter and people

2587
01:39:28,042 --> 01:39:29,839
it left armed of all sides.

2588
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:31,810
Lower slowly!the hands in the air!

2589
01:39:31,879 --> 01:39:33,039
!Show my hands!

2590
01:39:33,113 --> 01:39:34,512
I heard a noise,

2591
01:39:34,582 --> 01:39:37,745
it was as if a ray
it had impacted us.

2592
01:39:37,818 --> 01:39:41,015
The types that were
in the airplane they escaped.

2593
01:39:41,088 --> 01:39:42,749
A truck appeared

2594
01:39:42,823 --> 01:39:45,053
to about 100 kms per hour
and they entered for the door.

2595
01:39:45,125 --> 01:39:48,185
It was a simultaneous haul,
Tampa and Miami.

2596
01:39:48,262 --> 01:39:49,957
Dresses arrived of black

2597
01:39:50,030 --> 01:39:52,294
with the masks
and glasses of night vision.

2598
01:39:52,366 --> 01:39:54,630
It seemed that we were
of turn in Vietnam.

2599
01:39:54,702 --> 01:39:56,226
It was a madness.

2600
01:39:56,303 --> 01:39:57,600
I left for the back door.

2601
01:39:57,671 --> 01:39:59,468
"?Do I leave to tirotear with you?"

2602
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:01,508
I had a confrontation with one of them...

2603
01:40:01,575 --> 01:40:03,668
"!Throw you to the floor and be quiet!"
"Yes, it is well."

2604
01:40:03,744 --> 01:40:05,041
They looked at me,

2605
01:40:05,112 --> 01:40:09,549
and Io will never forget.
"!Roberts! ? What do you make here?"

2606
01:40:09,617 --> 01:40:11,346
I said: Do I "believe that I put the paw?no?".

2607
01:40:11,418 --> 01:40:12,851
"Yes, old.

2608
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:14,285
"We would have gone later to your house

2609
01:40:14,355 --> 01:40:16,414
"but us Io facilitated."

2610
01:40:16,490 --> 01:40:20,927
"Not he/she could sleep, old."
"What pity", he/she said.

2611
01:40:20,995 --> 01:40:23,793
We arrive at the police station and I heard in the radio

2612
01:40:23,864 --> 01:40:25,889
that there were shootings, and shots.

2613
01:40:25,966 --> 01:40:27,593
"!It is the war!"

2614
01:40:27,668 --> 01:40:29,795
I said: ?" What does it happen?
?Does he/she have to do with me?".

2615
01:40:29,870 --> 01:40:31,770
"It is your airplane, your farm."

2616
01:40:31,839 --> 01:40:33,830
There were shots, shootings.

2617
01:40:33,908 --> 01:40:35,933
They ran for all sides
shooting the weapons.

2618
01:40:36,010 --> 01:40:39,537
"Your friend is shooting us."
Mickey, my friend.

2619
01:40:39,613 --> 01:40:42,081
I was about escaping in the airplane.

2620
01:40:42,149 --> 01:40:44,709
He/she had a gun of flares
and around

2621
01:40:44,785 --> 01:40:46,650
there were tanks of gasoline that we used

2622
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:48,745
to recharge the tank and to release us.

2623
01:40:48,822 --> 01:40:49,789
I turned one of them.

2624
01:40:49,857 --> 01:40:51,154
Mickey wanted to escape.

2625
01:40:51,225 --> 01:40:52,715
It shot the weapon...

2626
01:40:55,496 --> 01:41:00,297
I left to the swamp.
I saw the show the whole day.

2627
01:41:00,367 --> 01:41:01,891
Not they could find it and Io pursued

2628
01:41:01,969 --> 01:41:03,630
in the forest the whole night.

2629
01:41:03,704 --> 01:41:05,399
These types became crazy.

2630
01:41:05,472 --> 01:41:07,565
This morning, agents of Customs and of the FBI

2631
01:41:07,641 --> 01:41:10,007
they began a haul of 12 people

2632
01:41:10,077 --> 01:41:13,103
that they helped to transport
almost 9100 kilos of cocaine

2633
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:16,445
toward the country for sea and air
from Colombia.

2634
01:41:16,517 --> 01:41:19,782
One of detainees is the fugitive
Michael Munday.

2635
01:41:19,853 --> 01:41:21,753
The organization Munday
it transported cocaine

2636
01:41:21,822 --> 01:41:23,119
from Colombia

2637
01:41:23,190 --> 01:41:25,124
using airplanes in direct flights.

2638
01:41:25,192 --> 01:41:27,490
An airplane in combination with boats.

2639
01:41:27,561 --> 01:41:31,258
The airplane released the loads in Bahamas.

2640
01:41:31,332 --> 01:41:32,993
Not it was their cocaine, neither they sold

2641
01:41:33,067 --> 01:41:35,661
cocaine in the streets,
alone they transported it

2642
01:41:35,736 --> 01:41:39,069
for another people
and they got paid for the transport.

2643
01:41:39,139 --> 01:41:40,572
A hired service.

2644
01:41:40,641 --> 01:41:42,666
Those loads were held

2645
01:41:42,743 --> 01:41:43,869
to some sophisticated buoys

2646
01:41:43,944 --> 01:41:46,538
that they allowed them to find the drug

2647
01:41:46,614 --> 01:41:48,514
when the authorities were not close.

2648
01:41:48,582 --> 01:41:51,710
This transmits a radio sign

2649
01:41:51,785 --> 01:41:53,412
and it also possesses infrared light

2650
01:41:53,487 --> 01:41:56,979
that it allows them to see them at night.

2651
01:41:57,057 --> 01:41:59,958
This shows advanced Io that were.

2652
01:42:00,027 --> 01:42:01,995
Max Mermelstein transformed into the witness

2653
01:42:02,062 --> 01:42:03,689
that he/she wanted to speak, among other things

2654
01:42:03,764 --> 01:42:04,822
of the murders in Miami.

2655
01:42:04,898 --> 01:42:06,729
We will interrogate to this type...

2656
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:09,997
and honestly, at the beginning he/she didn't believe him/her

2657
01:42:10,070 --> 01:42:14,370
75% of Io that he/she said,
it was too much disheveled.

2658
01:42:14,441 --> 01:42:15,373
Max was sold.

2659
01:42:15,442 --> 01:42:17,706
He/she gave our back to all.

2660
01:42:17,778 --> 01:42:19,609
And it began to cooperate with them.

2661
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:22,274
You Io said to Jon,
but he/she didn't believe me neither he/she listened to me.

2662
01:42:22,349 --> 01:42:24,476
From the beginning,
I told them that Max was weak,

2663
01:42:24,551 --> 01:42:26,883
that it would accuse us in some moment

2664
01:42:26,954 --> 01:42:28,444
and it is hence that Io wanted to kill,

2665
01:42:28,522 --> 01:42:29,580
but they didn't leave me.

2666
01:42:29,657 --> 01:42:31,056
The government didn't have idea,

2667
01:42:31,125 --> 01:42:34,026
and if it was not for Max Mermelstein...

2668
01:42:34,094 --> 01:42:36,153
Not I believe that they had caught us.

2669
01:42:36,230 --> 01:42:38,221
It filled the holes.

2670
01:42:38,298 --> 01:42:40,766
Not they knew where the farm was,

2671
01:42:40,834 --> 01:42:43,098
they didn't know anything about the trips.

2672
01:42:43,170 --> 01:42:47,106
Not they knew anything.
He/she made 5 years that we worked.

2673
01:42:47,174 --> 01:42:49,335
Max was of the family.

2674
01:42:49,410 --> 01:42:51,742
I never believed that he/she would make us that.

2675
01:42:51,812 --> 01:42:53,336
They arrived the following day,

2676
01:42:53,414 --> 01:42:56,076
they broke the entrance and they confiscated the house.

2677
01:42:56,150 --> 01:43:00,246
We could confiscate properties
for value of 130 million dollars

2678
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:01,947
in the area of Florida.

2679
01:43:02,022 --> 01:43:04,456
Thirty five horses Fine Step

2680
01:43:04,525 --> 01:43:07,551
and 14 hectares of ranch
in Marion County, Florida,

2681
01:43:07,628 --> 01:43:09,118
they were also confiscated.

2682
01:43:09,196 --> 01:43:11,130
It left in the cover
of the newspapers the following day

2683
01:43:11,198 --> 01:43:12,756
and he/she had all above me.

2684
01:43:12,833 --> 01:43:14,698
People that wanted to kill me

2685
01:43:14,768 --> 01:43:16,668
because they said that Jon owed them money,

2686
01:43:16,737 --> 01:43:18,364
people that had their money

2687
01:43:18,439 --> 01:43:20,100
and not me Io gave to me.

2688
01:43:20,174 --> 01:43:23,974
Max accused Mickey and me.

2689
01:43:24,044 --> 01:43:27,536
Not he/she could believe it when I read the positions.

2690
01:43:27,614 --> 01:43:28,979
Not I realized that him

2691
01:43:29,049 --> 01:43:31,347
in fact he/she worked for the poster.

2692
01:43:31,418 --> 01:43:32,646
Not he/she knew that Rafa was in the car...

2693
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:34,085
Not he/she knew anything about that. Not I say

2694
01:43:34,154 --> 01:43:36,554
that he/she didn't know anything.
I say that one didn't realize

2695
01:43:36,623 --> 01:43:39,683
of big Io that was that
in Io that Jon was put.

2696
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:42,593
You go aboard in a trip
where you make a lot of money

2697
01:43:42,663 --> 01:43:43,789
and you are very powerful,

2698
01:43:43,864 --> 01:43:45,832
for that reason anything... anything will happen.

2699
01:43:45,899 --> 01:43:50,063
I remember the day
that he was sat down on the seat

2700
01:43:50,137 --> 01:43:51,468
Ilorando, because he/she had

2701
01:43:51,538 --> 01:43:53,597
that to leave Io that loved...

2702
01:43:53,674 --> 01:43:57,474
Not I accuse anybody more than to myself.

2703
01:43:57,544 --> 01:43:59,307
You leave when it is moment of leaving.

2704
01:44:01,482 --> 01:44:03,347
He/she spoke with her and he/she told me

2705
01:44:03,417 --> 01:44:04,975
that he was not an informer.

2706
01:44:05,052 --> 01:44:06,542
I told him/her: He/she "works for the police,

2707
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:08,087
"I won't come closer to you because you will go to the jail.

2708
01:44:08,155 --> 01:44:09,918
But me not."
"They Come to Los Angeles."

2709
01:44:09,990 --> 01:44:12,458
"No, I am well where I am", I told him/her.

2710
01:44:12,526 --> 01:44:16,519
We locate a house that you/they had rented.

2711
01:44:16,597 --> 01:44:18,724
We knew that it was in the house.

2712
01:44:18,799 --> 01:44:21,893
We find it and we enter.

2713
01:44:21,969 --> 01:44:24,028
I ascended and I found it seated in the bed

2714
01:44:24,104 --> 01:44:26,572
reading the Bible. I came closer

2715
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:28,471
with the gun in the hand.

2716
01:44:28,542 --> 01:44:29,839
It was startled a lot.

2717
01:44:29,910 --> 01:44:33,539
He/she would never believe that it was
a maniac murderess and it forces.

2718
01:44:33,614 --> 01:44:35,081
They arrested her in the house.

2719
01:44:35,149 --> 01:44:37,743
And I kissed her in the cheek,

2720
01:44:37,818 --> 01:44:40,912
as I promised to the agents

2721
01:44:40,988 --> 01:44:43,616
many months before.

2722
01:44:43,690 --> 01:44:46,454
The police believes that it is responsible

2723
01:44:46,527 --> 01:44:49,325
of at least 200 murders...

2724
01:44:49,396 --> 01:44:52,832
in one period of more 10 years
of wars for drugs.

2725
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:55,334
Today, an arrest that could demolish

2726
01:44:55,402 --> 01:44:58,200
to one of the figures
more notorious criminals from Florida.

2727
01:44:58,272 --> 01:45:00,035
Then they arrested their children.

2728
01:45:00,107 --> 01:45:01,836
Everything one came below seriously.

2729
01:45:01,909 --> 01:45:03,934
Now I take care to myself.

2730
01:45:04,011 --> 01:45:05,103
All are in the jail less me.

2731
01:45:05,179 --> 01:45:06,703
And they are looking for me.

2732
01:45:06,780 --> 01:45:08,839
For that then, him and their siblings

2733
01:45:08,916 --> 01:45:11,441
they were in the airport
in a stolen car.

2734
01:45:11,518 --> 01:45:13,679
It stops them the police

2735
01:45:13,754 --> 01:45:16,222
and they resist to the arrest.
They had cocaine

2736
01:45:16,290 --> 01:45:19,225
and they put them low it guards.

2737
01:45:19,293 --> 01:45:21,420
I am low it guards from then on.

2738
01:45:24,264 --> 01:45:27,097
With the time, the market of the drug

2739
01:45:27,167 --> 01:45:29,795
it was disarticulated by the police.

2740
01:45:29,870 --> 01:45:32,805
Much of that money
let us say that it disappeared,

2741
01:45:32,873 --> 01:45:36,172
and while it was judged,
it sentenced and he/she sent to prison

2742
01:45:36,243 --> 01:45:39,735
to the drug dealers, something happened.

2743
01:45:39,813 --> 01:45:42,941
The businesses
that they frequented and they supported

2744
01:45:43,016 --> 01:45:44,984
they began to melt and to close.

2745
01:45:45,052 --> 01:45:47,213
The bank Sunshine State
it is outside of career.

2746
01:45:47,287 --> 01:45:48,515
It is alleged that Sunshine State

2747
01:45:48,589 --> 01:45:50,716
it was bought with the laundry
of money of the drugs.

2748
01:45:50,791 --> 01:45:53,259
All the night clubs melted,

2749
01:45:53,327 --> 01:45:56,125
the concessionaires
they left to the bankruptcy,

2750
01:45:56,196 --> 01:45:57,754
the jeweler'ses.

2751
01:45:57,831 --> 01:46:00,629
The real estate businesses
they are decaying.

2752
01:46:00,701 --> 01:46:02,032
That type of businesses

2753
01:46:02,102 --> 01:46:04,229
it has suffered too much.

2754
01:46:04,304 --> 01:46:08,172
Those crashes
they created new opportunities.

2755
01:46:08,242 --> 01:46:10,233
The economy of Miami stayed

2756
01:46:10,310 --> 01:46:14,838
with the speculators that won
money with the business of the drugs.

2757
01:46:14,915 --> 01:46:17,349
If you had a concessionaire
whose sales were

2758
01:46:17,417 --> 01:46:19,544
of 20 millions to 60 millions for anus

2759
01:46:19,620 --> 01:46:22,111
during ten years, there you have

2760
01:46:22,189 --> 01:46:24,487
500 millions extra
that they are giving turns.

2761
01:46:24,558 --> 01:46:27,288
Not it would have been there

2762
01:46:27,361 --> 01:46:28,692
if you didn't have the horrors

2763
01:46:28,762 --> 01:46:31,322
of the Horsemen of the Cocaine.

2764
01:46:31,398 --> 01:46:33,093
The drugs destroy to the community

2765
01:46:33,166 --> 01:46:35,225
when it is fought with the street.

2766
01:46:35,302 --> 01:46:38,066
When we speak from drugs to the level

2767
01:46:38,138 --> 01:46:39,901
that the main drug dealers

2768
01:46:39,973 --> 01:46:43,170
they live, they go of vacations
and they buy houses here,

2769
01:46:43,243 --> 01:46:44,938
washing the money, etc.,

2770
01:46:45,012 --> 01:46:48,072
that improves the economy
of a city or community.

2771
01:46:48,148 --> 01:46:52,608
Much of that money
he/she went privately to infrastructures.

2772
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:55,115
Constructions for the value
of 2300 million dollars

2773
01:46:55,188 --> 01:46:57,520
you Ilevan to end in the center of Miami.

2774
01:46:57,591 --> 01:46:59,422
The general construction

2775
01:46:59,493 --> 01:47:00,983
in the center and in Brickell.

2776
01:47:01,061 --> 01:47:02,824
The authorities of the center

2777
01:47:02,896 --> 01:47:05,387
they say that more constructions
for 1000 million dollars

2778
01:47:05,465 --> 01:47:08,400
you Ilevarán to end
in the next ones 6 to 8 months.

2779
01:47:08,468 --> 01:47:10,959
Uf, built half of the city.

2780
01:47:11,038 --> 01:47:13,199
It built the towers,
the sky-scrapers.

2781
01:47:13,273 --> 01:47:14,638
They say that the boom of the construction

2782
01:47:14,708 --> 01:47:16,938
it will last the next 10 years.

2783
01:47:17,010 --> 01:47:19,069
The drug traffic
it saved Miami in many ways.

2784
01:47:19,146 --> 01:47:21,876
If you look to the buildings,
many of them

2785
01:47:21,949 --> 01:47:25,612
they were built
or they were paid with money of drugs.

2786
01:47:25,686 --> 01:47:27,313
These new constructions represent

2787
01:47:27,387 --> 01:47:31,483
25.000 new works
and annual wages for millions.

2788
01:47:31,558 --> 01:47:33,890
The new condominiums,
offices and banks

2789
01:47:33,961 --> 01:47:36,122
they will add about 20 millions
of more dollars

2790
01:47:36,196 --> 01:47:38,460
to the base of taxes of Miami.

2791
01:47:38,532 --> 01:47:41,763
While the cocaine entered Miami

2792
01:47:41,835 --> 01:47:44,497
and the millions of dollars

2793
01:47:44,571 --> 01:47:47,267
they entered in Latin America,
legitimate Miami

2794
01:47:47,341 --> 01:47:50,435
he/she realized that it was
the entrance to the rest of America.

2795
01:47:50,510 --> 01:47:54,105
The traffic of drugs
it put to Miami in the map.

2796
01:47:54,181 --> 01:47:58,049
<i > Newsweek < /i > Ilamó to Miami
Casablanca of America.

2797
01:47:58,118 --> 01:48:00,484
What contrast with Io of 7 years behind.

2798
01:48:00,554 --> 01:48:02,579
A thing about the terrible publicity

2799
01:48:02,656 --> 01:48:05,557
it is that there was much.
All spoke of Miami.

2800
01:48:05,625 --> 01:48:06,717
- Miami.
- Miami.

2801
01:48:06,793 --> 01:48:08,260
- Miami.
- To Miami Beach.

2802
01:48:08,328 --> 01:48:09,556
- The whole world.
- People said:

2803
01:48:09,629 --> 01:48:11,153
"I always wanted to go to Miami,

2804
01:48:11,231 --> 01:48:13,096
"?seriously it is this way? The beaches that I see

2805
01:48:13,166 --> 01:48:15,361
"and the beautiful women
and the night" clubs.

2806
01:48:15,435 --> 01:48:18,461
It Is the Club 1235.
It is the place where

2807
01:48:18,538 --> 01:48:21,132
he/she took place the great party
of < i > Mlaml Vlce < /i > on Saturday.

2808
01:48:21,208 --> 01:48:24,200
We were in television
every Friday

2809
01:48:24,277 --> 01:48:25,642
with < i > Mlaml Vlce.</i>

2810
01:48:25,712 --> 01:48:30,809
The histories were based
entirely in the drug traffic.

2811
01:48:30,884 --> 01:48:33,352
He/she can that < i > Mlaml Vlce < /i > he/she doesn't help
to improve the image of the city,

2812
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:36,321
but he/she makes a lot for the local economy.

2813
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:41,225
Don Johnson and < i > Mlaml Vlce, < /i>
To Pacino in < i > Caracortada.</i>

2814
01:48:41,294 --> 01:48:42,727
It was very attractive.

2815
01:48:42,796 --> 01:48:45,424
This is Miami, everything is more relaxed.

2816
01:48:45,499 --> 01:48:47,865
It was interesting
because when the series came out

2817
01:48:47,934 --> 01:48:51,233
they found an abandoned hotel

2818
01:48:51,304 --> 01:48:53,101
or a gas station in the beach,

2819
01:48:53,173 --> 01:48:54,572
they put lights, they painted them,

2820
01:48:54,641 --> 01:48:56,108
they fixed them, they renovated them,

2821
01:48:56,176 --> 01:48:57,473
they recorded the scenes there

2822
01:48:57,544 --> 01:49:00,536
and they left a renovated place behind.

2823
01:49:00,614 --> 01:49:02,138
I believe that they made that a lot of people

2824
01:49:02,215 --> 01:49:05,150
he/she saw the possibilities that there was.

2825
01:49:26,873 --> 01:49:28,568
At the end of the 80 and principles of the 90

2826
01:49:28,642 --> 01:49:33,807
the European industry of the fashion
South discovered Beach,

2827
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:35,370
and behind the models

2828
01:49:35,449 --> 01:49:37,474
the European rich visitors come

2829
01:49:37,551 --> 01:49:39,075
that they pursued the models.

2830
01:49:39,152 --> 01:49:41,643
And we finish receiving to the famous ones.

2831
01:49:41,721 --> 01:49:44,383
He/she reminds me to the city Greenwich in 1965

2832
01:49:44,458 --> 01:49:47,052
because it is in fashion and it is new.

2833
01:49:47,127 --> 01:49:49,061
Then Ilegaron the paparazzi

2834
01:49:49,129 --> 01:49:50,756
and they created a phenomenon.

2835
01:49:50,831 --> 01:49:54,824
It passed of being a place vacacional

2836
01:49:54,901 --> 01:50:00,100
to be the international capital
prosperous of America.

2837
01:50:00,173 --> 01:50:04,735
The world began
to converge to Miami and Io we get.

2838
01:50:04,811 --> 01:50:06,210
We could have reborned

2839
01:50:06,279 --> 01:50:08,213
without so much people died.

2840
01:50:08,281 --> 01:50:10,181
He/she could have lived without it.

2841
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:11,581
And a lot of people could live

2842
01:50:11,651 --> 01:50:15,087
without the enormous contribution
of money to the community.

2843
01:50:15,155 --> 01:50:17,123
There were colateral too many effects.

2844
01:50:17,190 --> 01:50:20,057
Not I believe that the economic benefits

2845
01:50:20,127 --> 01:50:23,722
they were worth the cost in the society.

2846
01:50:23,797 --> 01:50:27,096
I still love more Miami, but the master

2847
01:50:27,167 --> 01:50:29,829
by Io that was
before the war of the cocaine.

2848
01:50:29,903 --> 01:50:32,167
? What price was it paid by a sky-scraper?

2849
01:50:32,239 --> 01:50:36,801
? How much people he/she had to die
for those buildings?

2850
01:50:36,877 --> 01:50:39,937
Not it was worthwhile,
too many died hence.

2851
01:50:40,013 --> 01:50:44,074
Honestly, Miami
it would not be where it is today

2852
01:50:44,151 --> 01:50:45,448
without having lived the horrors

2853
01:50:45,519 --> 01:50:47,453
and tragedies of those years.

2854
01:50:47,521 --> 01:50:50,957
Today people delight speaking

2855
01:50:51,024 --> 01:50:55,017
of how they survived
in Miami in 70 80.

2856
01:50:57,097 --> 01:50:58,724
I returned because he/she had to make it.

2857
01:50:58,798 --> 01:51:00,459
Not he/she had option.

2858
01:51:00,834 --> 01:51:03,029
Jon Roberts left the federal prison
in October of 2000

2859
01:51:03,103 --> 01:51:06,038
It Returned to Florida
as condition of their conditional freedom

2860
01:51:06,573 --> 01:51:08,268
I will never forget when I left,

2861
01:51:08,341 --> 01:51:10,070
I went to a hotel in South Beach

2862
01:51:10,143 --> 01:51:12,077
Ilamado The Surfcomber.
The first tomorrow

2863
01:51:12,145 --> 01:51:14,079
I got up and I went to the beach.

2864
01:51:14,147 --> 01:51:16,707
It was recumbent and a girl leaves the water

2865
01:51:16,783 --> 01:51:17,841
and while it leaves

2866
01:51:17,918 --> 01:51:19,613
I see that he/she doesn't have the part of up.

2867
01:51:19,686 --> 01:51:20,778
They have to understand

2868
01:51:20,854 --> 01:51:22,651
that he/she made 11 years that it was in prison.

2869
01:51:22,722 --> 01:51:24,155
He/she looked at that naked girl

2870
01:51:24,224 --> 01:51:25,885
and non Io could believe, I got scared.

2871
01:51:25,959 --> 01:51:28,427
I ran to the hotel and I could not leave

2872
01:51:28,495 --> 01:51:31,225
of the room during one day.
"? What did it happen?"

2873
01:51:31,298 --> 01:51:33,596
The world had changed.

2874
01:51:33,667 --> 01:51:38,263
The city had grown a lot
in those 12 years.

2875
01:51:39,039 --> 01:51:41,234
Mickey Munday was a fugitive
during 6 years

2876
01:51:41,308 --> 01:51:43,003
until it was arrested by the police
in 1992.

2877
01:51:43,076 --> 01:51:45,670
It left prison in December of 1999.

2878
01:51:46,546 --> 01:51:48,343
Non Io knows, the times change.

2879
01:51:48,415 --> 01:51:51,646
In that time,
we didn't care anything.

2880
01:51:51,718 --> 01:51:52,980
Miami was an open city,

2881
01:51:53,053 --> 01:51:54,247
totally different.

2882
01:51:54,321 --> 01:51:57,256
If you requested me that it killed to such and which

2883
01:51:57,324 --> 01:51:59,189
alone you should point out it

2884
01:51:59,259 --> 01:52:00,521
and me Io murdered.

2885
01:52:00,594 --> 01:52:02,084
It is no longer open,

2886
01:52:02,162 --> 01:52:03,129
it is a different city.

2887
01:52:03,196 --> 01:52:04,561
Today could not make it.

2888
01:52:04,631 --> 01:52:06,895
He/she would make it in a completely different way.

2889
01:52:06,967 --> 01:52:09,629
It is a very different city
to the one that the memory.

2890
01:52:24,417 --> 01:52:26,317
Many of my acquaintances

2891
01:52:26,386 --> 01:52:27,614
they are no longer here.

2892
01:52:27,687 --> 01:52:29,154
The friends with those that I grew

2893
01:52:29,222 --> 01:52:31,656
they are dead. They killed them.

2894
01:52:32,125 --> 01:52:33,854
Rafa Cardona Salazar
it was murdered to shots

2895
01:52:33,927 --> 01:52:38,626
in Medellín, Colombia,
December 7 1987.

2896
01:52:38,698 --> 01:52:41,258
Soon after of their arrest
in June of 1985,

2897
01:52:41,334 --> 01:52:43,461
Max Mermeistein entered in the Program
Federal of Witnesses' Protection.

2898
01:52:43,536 --> 01:52:47,267
Their testimony was in the accusation
of the leaders of the poster of Medellín.

2899
01:52:48,041 --> 01:52:49,702
The whereabouts of Mermeistein
it continues being an incognito one

2900
01:52:49,776 --> 01:52:51,971
and it continues working as witness
remunerated for the government of EE UU.

2901
01:52:52,045 --> 01:52:54,878
According to some reports,
he/she has a contract of 3 million dollars.

2902
01:52:55,649 --> 01:52:57,139
Griselda Blanco and Jorge "Rivi" Ayala

2903
01:52:57,217 --> 01:52:59,549
they were accused of the murder of
Johnny Castro and Alfredo and Grizel Lorenzo.

2904
01:52:59,619 --> 01:53:01,985
Rivi avoided the death penalty

2905
01:53:02,055 --> 01:53:03,716
consenting to testify against their boss,
Griselda Blanco.

2906
01:53:04,824 --> 01:53:07,588
I Went to Miami,
I declared myself guilty of two murders.

2907
01:53:07,661 --> 01:53:10,596
Life imprisonment to be
fulfilled simultaneously.

2908
01:53:10,664 --> 01:53:12,655
I am here from then on.

2909
01:53:12,732 --> 01:53:16,099
As a result
of the information given by Rivi,

2910
01:53:16,169 --> 01:53:17,261
there were 14 different homicides

2911
01:53:17,337 --> 01:53:18,929
attributed
to the organization of Griselda Blanco.

2912
01:53:19,005 --> 01:53:21,235
When it occurred turn and he/she began to sing

2913
01:53:21,308 --> 01:53:22,798
on all the homicides

2914
01:53:22,876 --> 01:53:25,310
and how she had ordered them,
it was completed.

2915
01:53:25,378 --> 01:53:27,369
She was our John Gotti,

2916
01:53:27,447 --> 01:53:30,712
and Rivi their "Sammy The Bull" Gravano.

2917
01:53:32,686 --> 01:53:34,916
The case against Griselda Blanco

2918
01:53:34,988 --> 01:53:37,286
it turned out to be a frustration.

2919
01:53:37,357 --> 01:53:39,154
Terribly disappointing and useless.

2920
01:53:39,225 --> 01:53:42,922
It was declared guilty
of insignificant positions.

2921
01:53:42,996 --> 01:53:45,760
We were escaped. I believed that we had it.

2922
01:53:45,832 --> 01:53:48,266
What happened was shameful.

2923
01:53:48,601 --> 01:53:51,297
Rivi was involved in a scandal
sexual very publicitado

2924
01:53:51,371 --> 01:53:52,929
with secretaries of the office
of the attorney of the state of Miami Dade.

2925
01:53:53,006 --> 01:53:55,167
Humiliated, the attorney did without of him
as witness against Griselda

2926
01:53:55,241 --> 01:53:57,266
and he/she offered him/her a sentence
agreed of conformity.

2927
01:53:57,377 --> 01:53:59,641
When we lost Rivi,
we lost the connection

2928
01:53:59,713 --> 01:54:02,079
between the assassins and Griselda.

2929
01:54:02,148 --> 01:54:05,413
Riverita helped to create
the case and to destroy it.

2930
01:54:05,485 --> 01:54:08,477
One of the investigations bombarded

2931
01:54:08,555 --> 01:54:12,047
of more significant homicides
that they were made.

2932
01:54:12,125 --> 01:54:14,559
During their terror reign,

2933
01:54:14,627 --> 01:54:19,496
she made many enemies
here and in Colombia,

2934
01:54:19,566 --> 01:54:21,193
and they have not forgotten it.

2935
01:54:21,267 --> 01:54:23,565
Certainly not Io forgot with concerning

2936
01:54:23,636 --> 01:54:25,536
to Uber and Osvaldo.

2937
01:54:25,605 --> 01:54:27,266
The children of Griselda,
Uber and Osvaldo,

2938
01:54:27,340 --> 01:54:30,070
they were murdered with machine guns
in Colombia.

2939
01:54:30,677 --> 01:54:31,974
The proverb "who kills to iron,

2940
01:54:32,045 --> 01:54:34,070
to iron he/she dies" it is very certain

2941
01:54:34,147 --> 01:54:36,172
in the business in the one that you/they are.

2942
01:54:36,249 --> 01:54:39,844
It is probable that if he/she returned to Colombia,

2943
01:54:39,919 --> 01:54:42,410
it would suffer the same luck.

2944
01:54:42,489 --> 01:54:43,820
Not there is nobody that deserves

2945
01:54:43,890 --> 01:54:44,982
the death penalty more than her.

2946
01:54:45,058 --> 01:54:46,457
It should be sentenced to death.

2947
01:54:46,526 --> 01:54:49,359
He/she gives me some comfort the fact

2948
01:54:49,429 --> 01:54:52,455
that it will be in prison
until the day in that I retire.

2949
01:54:52,532 --> 01:54:53,499
Not I know how much more,

2950
01:54:53,566 --> 01:54:55,727
but it will be in prison

2951
01:54:55,802 --> 01:54:57,326
while it is police.

2952
01:55:03,510 --> 01:55:05,478
The sergeant To Singleton retired
of the police body of Miami-Dade

2953
01:55:05,545 --> 01:55:07,342
June 30 2003.

2954
01:55:07,414 --> 01:55:12,613
Griselda Blanco left the jail
June 6 2004.

2955
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:16,617
The same day that left, they stabbed Rivi
in a jail of Miami.

2956
01:55:16,689 --> 01:55:21,922
He/she survived, but he/she refused
to identify their attacker.

2957
01:55:21,995 --> 01:55:26,659
June 7 2004,
Griselda was deported Colombia.

2958
01:55:28,468 --> 01:55:35,032
Their whereabouts is ignored.

2959
01:55:45,718 --> 01:55:47,743
When I moved to Florida
it was in Orlando,

2960
01:55:47,821 --> 01:55:49,448
in Disney World, with my children

2961
01:55:49,522 --> 01:55:50,750
and he/she spoke with people from Germany.

2962
01:55:50,824 --> 01:55:53,156
"My God, they are from Miami."

2963
01:55:53,226 --> 01:55:54,523
"? What does he/she have of bad Miami?"

2964
01:55:54,594 --> 01:55:56,459
"Skies, murder people every day.

2965
01:55:56,529 --> 01:55:57,894
"We look at the news in Europe."

2966
01:55:57,964 --> 01:56:00,125
I said: "Yes, yes, it is a dangerous" city.

2967
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:02,225
"Not I will go there of vacations."

2968
01:56:02,302 --> 01:56:03,963
My wife looked at me...

2969
01:56:04,037 --> 01:56:06,198
if they knew.

2970
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:07,899
What wanted to know was

2971
01:56:07,974 --> 01:56:09,703
what it happened with all the money.

2972
01:56:13,413 --> 01:56:15,005
The invasion happened before the dawn,

2973
01:56:15,081 --> 01:56:16,241
when airplanes of EE UU

2974
01:56:16,316 --> 01:56:18,614
they bombarded the barracks
of General Noriega.

2975
01:56:18,685 --> 01:56:20,016
It used their position

2976
01:56:20,086 --> 01:56:23,078
to sell Panama to the traffickers.

2977
01:56:23,156 --> 01:56:24,350
When Noriega fell

2978
01:56:24,424 --> 01:56:25,914
we lost through the bank of Panama

2979
01:56:25,992 --> 01:56:29,223
about 140 millions among Max, me,

2980
01:56:29,295 --> 01:56:32,731
Rafa, Ochoa, Escobar,
all lost a part.

2981
01:56:32,799 --> 01:56:34,733
It was this way like we lost a lot.

2982
01:56:34,801 --> 01:56:36,063
It was then in the jail

2983
01:56:36,135 --> 01:56:38,433
and there was not way to retire the money.

2984
01:56:38,505 --> 01:56:40,439
The government you Io Ilevó everything.
