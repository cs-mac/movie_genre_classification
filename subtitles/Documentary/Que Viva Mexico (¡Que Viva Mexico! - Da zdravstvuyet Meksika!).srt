1
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:54,931
- I never heard of him. - Who?

2
00:00:55,098 --> 00:00:56,474
The man you recommended.

3
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:59,102
The guitar fighter'?

4
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:04,232
Wiped out a couple towns
single-handedly. A real nut. Yeah.

5
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:07,986
You heard of him. You just didn't know
it was him they were talking about.

6
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:10,280
You should meet him.

7
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:12,991
Me. Me. That's me.

8
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:20,165
As long as I'm not the guy
that has to make the introduction.

9
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:23,001
Were you in Mexico during
the Barillo cartel massacre?

10
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:25,086
No.

11
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:29,591
That's when I first heard about him.
He was a legend.

12
00:01:29,758 --> 00:01:32,886
They used to say he was the biggest
Mexican they'd ever seen.

13
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:37,849
That was total bullshit.
He was 5'9", 5'1O", tops.

14
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:40,727
That's no record,
but bigger than most of us.

15
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:45,190
But Marquez, that's a different story.

16
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:47,233
<i>Marquez.</i>

17
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,279
<i>Marquez. General Marquez.</i>

18
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:55,658
<i>Powerful, dangerous.</i>

19
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:59,913
<i>Marquez, he really had it in
for this Mariachi, see.</i>

20
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:13,301
<i>They called him "Mariachi"
because he used to carry this guitar.</i>

21
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:15,887
A Guitar?

22
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:18,932
Believe me, he really knew
how to play it too.

23
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,919
Look, this story is well-traveled.

24
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:51,089
It might have picked up some
embellishments along the way.

25
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:54,175
Just read between the lines.

26
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:32,380
<i>Now, he may not have been
the biggest Mexican ever...</i>

27
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:35,425
- All right.
-...but she was as deadly...

28
00:03:35,592 --> 00:03:36,926
...as she was beautiful.

29
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:41,764
- There's a girl?
- Oh, yeah. There's a girl.

30
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:45,393
When he'd run out of ammo,
she'd take over.

31
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:51,149
The most drop-dead gorgeous
woman you'll ever see.

32
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,529
That's where all the trouble began.
She was with Marquez.

33
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:43,534
And when Marquez saw that she was
with the Mariachi, well, he went crazy.

34
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:48,456
He hunted him down and fought
Mariachi to the death. And then she...

35
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,378
...put a bullet in his heart.

36
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,594
Only he didn't die.

37
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:06,557
- I don't know what happened after that.
- Would you like some?

38
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:10,728
No. Maybe Marquez caught up
with them, or the cartels.

39
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:14,899
But like I said, the man
is a myth, a legend.

40
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:18,778
And if he's still living,
he's the one you want.

41
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,822
Well...

42
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:24,617
...that is truly unbelievable.

43
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:27,912
Well, I'm not big on telling stories.

44
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,540
Where's the money?
That's the reason I'm here.

45
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:33,710
I couldn't find a briefcase
small enough...

46
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:37,130
...for $10,000 in cash.

47
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,637
It'll do.

48
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:49,100
Just for my own edification,
I offered you 50.

49
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:52,311
- Why'd you say no?
- I'm not a greedy man.

50
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,772
Not looking to get rich quick.

51
00:05:54,939 --> 00:06:00,069
Besides, 50,000 is a lot for what
you wanted me to find out, you know.

52
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:04,282
You may as just as well put a bullet
in my head as cough it up, right?

53
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,368
But 10?

54
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:10,204
Ten thousand is civilized.

55
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,790
Ten is something
we both can live with.

56
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:19,047
Ten might still be too much.

57
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:22,967
You'd kill me over $10,000?

58
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,053
You wouldn't dare.

59
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:29,891
You wouldn't dare.

60
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:33,853
Yes, I would.

61
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:55,601
Would you do me the honor?

62
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,648
You need to learn to play.

63
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:02,483
That's why you're here.

64
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:43,644
I hear this is a town of Gunmen.

65
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,647
We only make guitars here.

66
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,903
Mariachi.

67
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:54,822
Which one?

68
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,291
I don't know who you mean.

69
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:10,731
I'm honored to be in your presence.

70
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,360
But there's someone else who
wants to meet you.

71
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:24,161
Keep it. He made that for you.

72
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:52,898
You know, if I was you, son,
I'd turn around and go back right now.

73
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:55,192
Go back to where I came from...

74
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:59,655
...instead of selling my mind
and my soul to these cocksuckers.

75
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,700
You speak English?

76
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:05,369
I didn't think so.

77
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:11,167
Attempts have been made on me
and my family by the cartels.

78
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:15,880
The same cartels that are
threatening our freedom...

79
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:21,719
freedom which we must
defend to the death.

80
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:38,068
I present to you Sefior Blascoe.

81
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:02,760
Please sit.

82
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:08,599
We hear you want to work for us.

83
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:18,776
I too am ready to start a new life.

84
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,450
This is your lucky day.

85
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,044
<i>Did you order my pibil?</i>

86
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:42,258
- Does it have a name?
- They call him "El."

87
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,635
As in "The."

88
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:47,846
I know what it means. Thank you.

89
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,724
Alert the Barillo cartel...

90
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:55,062
...that El has come out of hiding.

91
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:58,107
- I don't think we should--
- Are you a Mexican...

92
00:14:58,274 --> 00:15:00,776
...or a Mexi-can't?

93
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,281
I'm a Mexican.

94
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,199
Good.

95
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,327
Then do as I say.

96
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:22,464
- Nice tune.
- Something my brother taught me.

97
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:25,217
I killed him.

98
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:29,346
Yes, I was privy to that
information already. How charming.

99
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:32,808
You know, El,
if I may call you that...

100
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:37,771
...I've been doing a little snooping
around, and it seems that the cartels...

101
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,024
...have quite a price on your head.

102
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,443
I wouldn't want to be you.

103
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,530
Tell me, is there anyone
who doesn't want you dead?

104
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,701
You tell me.

105
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:53,203
I need you to kill a man.

106
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:59,293
El, you really must try this
because it's puerco <i>pibil.</i>

107
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,339
It's a slow-roasted pork, nothing fancy.
It just happens to be my favorite...

108
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:08,927
...and I order it with a tequila and lime
in every dive I go to in this country.

109
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:14,224
And honestly, that is the best
it's ever been anywhere.

110
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,518
In fact, it's too good.

111
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:19,897
It's so good that when I'm finished,
I'll pay my check...

112
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:22,900
...walk straight into the kitchen
and shoot the cook.

113
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:26,612
Because that's what I do.
I restore the balance to this country.

114
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:29,239
And that is what I would like
from you right now.

115
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,659
Help keep the balance
by pulling the trigger.

116
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,703
- You want me to shoot the cook?
- No, I'll shoot the cook.

117
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,165
My car's parked
out back anyway. You...

118
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,168
...will kill Marquez.

119
00:16:41,377 --> 00:16:44,296
Do you remember General Marquez?

120
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,717
He's being paid by Barillo...

121
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:51,595
...to kill the President
in an attempted coup d'état.

122
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:55,599
- Attempted?
- Oh, no. The President will be killed...

123
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:59,603
...because he's that piece of good pork
that needs to get balanced out.

124
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,232
I say "attempted" because we don't
want Marquez taking power.

125
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:06,568
I need you to put the hurting,
so to speak, on Marquez...

126
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,905
...after he's killed
the President. Savvy?

127
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:13,909
- So why me?
- You've got nothing to live for...

128
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:16,412
...and, in a way, you're already dead.

129
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:19,540
And Marquez is the man
who killed you.

130
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:22,751
So why not return the favor?
Go to the church.

131
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:26,046
Meet with an associate
of mine named Salome at 3:00.

132
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:31,093
And I will contact you afterwards
if we have a deal.

133
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:42,062
Was I right?

134
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,357
I guess not.

135
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,336
The last shipment of guns
that were seized at our border...

136
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,672
...have not been
accounted for, Sanchez.

137
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:13,510
You are now off that assignment.
Who wants to volunteer?

138
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:17,848
Okay. You, Gomez, it's yours.

139
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:21,268
With <i>el</i> Presidente's new campaign
against the Barillo cartel...

140
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:24,688
...their activities are being
pushed into the forefront.

141
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:29,568
Large payments, deliveries,
whispers of a political takeover.

142
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:33,280
I need new point men,
strong and willing.

143
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:38,577
This is a top priority of <i>el</i> Presidente.
Who wants this?

144
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,705
Romero, it's yours.

145
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:44,458
Pick your secondary person.
A third, if you have to.

146
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,044
That's all. Dismissed.

147
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:51,215
I should take his left nut.

148
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,134
You're with us.

149
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,724
People of Culiacan.

150
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:05,938
I've come here to bring you a
message of peace.

151
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:09,900
Peace that at this moment is being
threatened by a group of people

152
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:12,069
that is threatening our nation.

153
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:14,488
People like Armando Barillo.

154
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,199
I invite you to gather our forces...

155
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:20,077
...in order to prevent the
destruction of our unity

156
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,955
...and our peace.

157
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:29,086
<i>El</i> Presidente, history teaches us
no matter how great your armies are...

158
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:32,214
...you will always need
the favor of the inhabitants...

159
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:35,300
...to take possession of a province.

160
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:38,762
How can you compete with
a man like Barillo? He owns Culiacan.

161
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,556
He doesn't own its people.

162
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:43,267
Barillo purchased hundreds
of homes and ranches...

163
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,561
...in the northern part of Culiacan.

164
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:49,439
And then he has turned around
and given these homes to the people.

165
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,652
- He's a folk hero to them.
- He's also a mass murderer...

166
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,779
...and a drug kingpin.

167
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:59,950
He's trying to make himself a martyr
by drawing the people to his side...

168
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:02,286
...but the people can
see through that.

169
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:06,957
Men like Barillo have stolen
this country's soul.

170
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:10,460
But my people will stand up
for what is right.

171
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:14,172
I'm afraid they're no longer
your people, sir.

172
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:18,218
Then I will die fighting.

173
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:20,804
Are you with me?

174
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,809
To the death.

175
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,970
What's wrong?

176
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,348
Everything.

177
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:56,692
This Way!

178
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,610
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

179
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:03,782
Any suggestions, Miss "Let's
get a room on the fifth floor...

180
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:06,034
...so we can see
the beautiful sunset"?

181
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:12,249
Jump.

182
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:20,424
Swing, swing, swing.

183
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:24,636
- Hang on!
- What do you mean, hold on?

184
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,477
Let go now!

185
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:13,310
Give me that!

186
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,855
Stop the bus.

187
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:23,964
A vow must be broken.

188
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,550
Forgive me...

189
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:28,927
for what I am about to become.

190
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,809
- When was your last confession?
- An hour ago.

191
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:38,728
- And the name of your priest?
- Sands.

192
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:43,567
Okay. You are expected to carry out
your assignment to the letter--

193
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,527
- Yeah, I know.
- Failure to appear...

194
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,863
...in locations at assigned times...

195
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:52,450
...results in forfeit of protection,
protection you will definitely need.

196
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:54,369
- Yeah.
- You'll be paid.

197
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:57,747
Coup d'états, like elections,
don't come cheap.

198
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:01,251
So there's plenty of dough
floating around.

199
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:04,546
There's more.
You will be a free man...

200
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:08,633
...from Marquez, the cartels,
and even from the President...

201
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,803
...who isn't your biggest fan,
let's face it.

202
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,473
- When do I begin?
- Give me a moment.

203
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:57,515
It's a church, hombre.

204
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,222
I'm sorry.

205
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:57,802
Are you still standing?

206
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:00,805
Still.

207
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:05,185
<i>Good. Well, the Barillo cartel
aren't the nicest of guys, are they?</i>

208
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:08,605
However, you've passed the test.

209
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:10,690
You're gonna do just fine.

210
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:15,236
Assemble your team, and I will
call you with further instructions.

211
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:17,989
<i>Over and out.</i>

212
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:26,456
I'm just walking my beat, friend.
Mexico's my beat, I'm walking it.

213
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:30,543
I throw shapes, and they catch them.
I set them up and watch them fall.

214
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:34,839
Have him meet me
at the bullfight at 5 p.m. What?

215
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:37,675
Why would I want that?
Why would I want bubble gum?

216
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,391
All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

217
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:49,979
Okay, this should hold the both
of us over for quite a long time.

218
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:53,858
So I don't ever
want to see you again.

219
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:55,985
Fuck off.

220
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:10,583
- Hi.
- Hello.

221
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,837
The CIA sharing a meal with the FBI.

222
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:18,258
Now, if that isn't interagency
cooperation, I just don't know what is.

223
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:21,010
- I'm retired FBI.
- A real agent never retires.

224
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:23,680
He just takes it a little easier.

225
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:29,352
- Why are we talking?
- You tracked down Armando Barillo...

226
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,856
...for two years when he was running
operations out of San Antonio.

227
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:35,567
Spinning wheels.
It never led to an arrest.

228
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,903
Well, he--

229
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:43,741
He is, in fact,
sitting directly behind you.

230
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:45,243
I know.

231
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,455
He settled back in.
He's been living here for six years.

232
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,457
Can't be touched.

233
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:53,960
Did you know that most agents
never even see a top-10 criminal...

234
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:58,047
...for their entire careers?
You brought down two, didn't you?

235
00:29:58,214 --> 00:30:02,093
And now your third
is sitting in very close proximity.

236
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,929
Now, retired or not...

237
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:09,726
...that has really got to tug
on the old short and curlies.

238
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:12,145
I'm a civilian now.

239
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:15,732
Didn't he kill that agent friend
of yours? What was his name...

240
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,026
...Archuleta?

241
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:22,113
Yes.

242
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:25,658
Barillo is a Mexican citizen.

243
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:28,828
He cannot be extradited for crimes
committed in the U.S.

244
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:32,373
Do you happen to know of a
Dr. Guevera? Worked for the cartel.

245
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:38,296
This doctor pumped your friend
Archuleta full of drugs, day after day...

246
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:43,051
...so that they could torture him
for two weeks before he died.

247
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:44,969
You must have known that.

248
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:51,935
Dr. Guevera himself
having dinner with your prey.

249
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:54,646
I wonder what it is they're up to now.

250
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:59,609
Two weeks of torture, Jorge.
Think about that.

251
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,611
For your dead friend...

252
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:04,531
...for the job you didn't finish
in San Antonio.

253
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:08,368
Now, are you really going to let it
slip away again?

254
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:18,002
I'd like you to have a bite
of my pork because it's...

255
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:20,463
...the world.

256
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:22,692
(Announcer)
It's Mariachi Happy Hour!

257
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:24,402
Get your Mariachi song for 5 pesos.

258
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:26,404
A Mariachi kiss for 20 pesos.

259
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:29,115
And a Mariachi fuck for only 50 pesos!

260
00:32:33,411 --> 00:32:35,204
Where the hell have you been?

261
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,040
Far away.

262
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:38,916
Still fucking around?

263
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:42,754
Let me get Fideo.

264
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:46,382
I'm here for my guitar.

265
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:57,018
It's his last night.

266
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:00,021
They're firing him.

267
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:02,607
Hey...

268
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:05,610
...Fideo, it's me.

269
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:10,239
- Still drinking.
- Like a fish.

270
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:13,368
I guess we haven't changed
so much.

271
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:20,750
I didn't think you'd ever
come back for this thing.

272
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:23,378
Neither did I.

273
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:25,755
Are we on?

274
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:28,758
I'll let you know.
I'll let you know.

275
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:37,016
Bring him sober.
We're gonna need him, so...

276
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:38,434
coffee

277
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:40,603
Lots of coffee.

278
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:45,942
Sometimes a revolution is exactly
what's needed to clean up the system.

279
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:47,276
One...

280
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:51,948
...giant enema, which just so happens
to be my area of expertise.

281
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:57,078
Bullfights. Bull hockey.
Do you like this?

282
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:01,624
The bull is stabbed,
prodded, beaten.

283
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:07,338
The bull is wounded.
The bull is tired before the matador...

284
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:11,634
...ever steps into the ring.
Now, is that victory?

285
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:13,803
Of course it is.

286
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:15,722
Wanna know
the secret to winning?

287
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:17,932
Creative sportsmanship.

288
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,851
In other words...

289
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:28,818
...one has to rig the game.

290
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:32,613
Go collect.

291
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:47,587
<i>El Presidente</i> is giving a speech
on the Day of the Dead...

292
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:49,297
...in the town of Culiacan.

293
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:50,923
He's going to be isolated...

294
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:54,802
...in the main <i>edificio</i>
in the center of the plaza.

295
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:58,055
Very easy access to him if...

296
00:34:58,222 --> 00:34:59,599
...somebody can get you in.

297
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:02,769
Right.
You're the man who can do that.

298
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:05,855
I am not the prince.

299
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:08,691
I am the man behind the prince.

300
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:11,611
- I see.
- He's not the first prince I've served...

301
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:14,363
...nor the first one that I've betrayed.

302
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:18,534
- You're a good rat. I like you.
- I try.

303
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:22,205
The rest upon completion.

304
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:25,666
- Mucho gusto.
- Right. Right.

305
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:34,801
Every goddamn time.

306
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:45,538
What do you want in life?

307
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,495
Belini...

308
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:30,374
...how long have you and I
done business together?

309
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:32,460
A long time.

310
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:34,545
And in a way...

311
00:37:34,712 --> 00:37:39,300
...I kind of, almost, could have the
tiniest smidgen of respect for you.

312
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:41,177
Almost.

313
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:43,512
But you need to stop farting around.

314
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:47,224
Now, do you have the information
that I need on Barillo or do you not?

315
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:49,644
I have what you need.

316
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:53,773
I'm just enjoying this
temporary position of power.

317
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,566
That make you nervous?

318
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:59,195
You know that withholding vital
information from a federal officer...

319
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:00,947
...is a serious offense.

320
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:05,034
Especially when that officer has paid
handsomely for it...

321
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:08,829
...and wouldn't think twice about
ripping that patch off your eyehole...

322
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:11,374
...and skull-fucking you to death.

323
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:16,212
No.

324
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:20,216
I'm fine. Go away.

325
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:26,055
I am fine. Go away.
You're off the hook.

326
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:27,848
Leave me alone.

327
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:31,143
That spill just cost you your life.

328
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:52,707
A little help.

329
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:11,434
Okay.

330
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,352
I know it's on you somewhere.

331
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:15,104
Somewhere.

332
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:21,569
All right.

333
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:23,821
Time to get messy.

334
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:44,800
Well, I suppose I should thank you
for not sticking it up your ass.

335
00:39:48,596 --> 00:39:50,222
However.

336
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:01,525
You're about a quart low.

337
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:20,753
You're gonna pay for that, cop.

338
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,964
- Why doesn't my key work any more?
- It's too small.

339
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:30,346
- Stand back.
- I just-- I brought you a gift.

340
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:31,806
I'm still mad at you.

341
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:35,226
And trust me,
it wasn't easy to get. So...

342
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:38,395
Come closer and I'll thank you.

343
00:40:41,357 --> 00:40:44,860
- Are you trying to give me a boner?
- Closer, I said.

344
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:47,071
How about that little tip-off?

345
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:51,617
Guarantees you a big arrest
and an accommodation.

346
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:53,744
Even from your twisted little agency.

347
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:55,913
I'm impressed.

348
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,165
- But then what?
- Want to hear my plan?

349
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:01,001
Either that or I start target practice.

350
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:07,424
Okay. The new President is on a
quest to clear out the Barillo cartel.

351
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:10,719
And Barillo has set up
a counterattack...

352
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:14,265
...by hiring a military general
named Marquez.

353
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:17,059
<i>He wants him
to throw</i> a <i>coup d'état</i>

354
00:41:17,226 --> 00:41:20,396
<i>...while the President's
visiting Culiacan.</i>

355
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:23,607
<i>Now, I have a man inside
as insurance...</i>

356
00:41:23,774 --> 00:41:26,235
<i>...to make sure that Marquez
never takes power.</i>

357
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:29,029
The last piece of the puzzle...

358
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:33,909
...is Barillo. Your tip-oh' assures...

359
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:37,997
<i>...that Barillo is out of the picture
while the battle ensues.</i>

360
00:41:38,164 --> 00:41:42,459
<i>In the aftermath
of this very healthy revolution...</i>

361
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:47,756
<i>...I will calmly waltz away with
the 20 million pesos...</i>

362
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:51,385
<i>...that Barillo is prepared to pay
Marquez for the coup.</i>

363
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:54,096
- You want me to go with you?
- You detain Barillo...

364
00:41:54,263 --> 00:41:57,558
...with the information that you have,
then you join me...

365
00:41:57,725 --> 00:41:59,727
...and share the spoils.

366
00:42:04,023 --> 00:42:06,317
You meet me two nights from now...

367
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:08,944
...at La Pileta, 10 p.m. sharp...

368
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:12,323
...and bring only
what's important to you.

369
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:16,744
Oh, yeah.

370
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:20,539
It might get a wee bit dangerous
there, sugar-butt. So...

371
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:24,168
- Can you dig it?
- I can dig it.

372
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,629
I want my key back.

373
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:38,974
Testing. One, two. Testing.

374
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,973
Hello?

375
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:20,975
Can you hear me now?

376
00:43:21,475 --> 00:43:24,144
Okay-- Fucking bells.

377
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:26,605
Did you assemble your team?

378
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:28,565
You know I did.

379
00:43:29,066 --> 00:43:33,028
<i>- Why are you having me followed?
- Oh, yeah, that. Let's just call that a...</i>

380
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:35,322
...guarantee of compliance,
shall we?

381
00:43:35,489 --> 00:43:37,241
Because Cucuy also...

382
00:43:37,408 --> 00:43:40,327
...pro <i>vides</i> protection.
- From what? Mosquitoes?

383
00:43:40,494 --> 00:43:43,414
<i>Oh, gosh, I really wouldn't mess
with him if I were you...</i>

384
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,457
...because he's a bit of a live wire.

385
00:43:45,624 --> 00:43:48,711
<i>And he's not the happiest
that you killed his man.</i>

386
00:43:49,253 --> 00:43:52,131
<i>Oh, yeah, by the by,
I have your next assignment.</i>

387
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:05,394
You the Mariachis?

388
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,203
This is the back entrance.
Make a note of it.

389
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,887
Hey, hey, hey, he)'-

390
00:44:40,346 --> 00:44:41,388
Who are they?

391
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:43,057
Musicians.

392
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:51,357
Why so heavy?

393
00:44:52,983 --> 00:44:55,194
Built in amplifier.

394
00:44:57,071 --> 00:44:58,280
Play something.

395
00:45:00,366 --> 00:45:01,992
All right.

396
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:20,219
Let's go.

397
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:26,141
- I was afraid you couldn't play.
- Are you kidding?

398
00:46:14,857 --> 00:46:17,192
What we are looking for is support

399
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:19,069
from the people of this state.

400
00:46:19,528 --> 00:46:21,864
A man can do a lot alone,

401
00:46:22,781 --> 00:46:26,368
but he can do better with his
people backing him.

402
00:46:27,453 --> 00:46:30,122
I wonder how much
we're getting paid for this shit.

403
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:36,211
A man who wants nothing
is invincible, cabrén.

404
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:47,764
H9)'-

405
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:51,393
Are you gonna tell him
that this is his last meal?

406
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:59,485
Is there a particular song you
would like to hear?

407
00:47:18,212 --> 00:47:22,090
We just played for <i>el</i> Presidente,
I can't buy half a tequila with this shit!

408
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:24,801
It was meant as an honor.

409
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:26,762
Fuck honor.

410
00:47:27,095 --> 00:47:30,224
- We need money.
- The score's tomorrow. Enough for all.

411
00:47:30,891 --> 00:47:32,726
Even for you, Lorenzo.

412
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:36,438
Why are you suddenly interested
in the score? What's in it for you?

413
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:38,440
Only revenge.

414
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:41,735
Much delayed revenge.

415
00:47:47,366 --> 00:47:49,034
Go practice.

416
00:47:49,952 --> 00:47:51,453
Practice?

417
00:47:52,037 --> 00:47:55,207
Playing or shooting?

418
00:47:55,374 --> 00:47:56,959
What do you think?

419
00:47:57,626 --> 00:47:59,545
I don't think. I drink.

420
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:10,305
- Yeah, hello.
- Been following Barillo...

421
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:15,143
...and the good Dr. Guevera.
- Oh, Agent Ramirez, no longer retired.

422
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:19,147
- Good man. Welcome to the fold.
- I haven't seen illegal activities yet.

423
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:22,526
Only that Dr. Guevera is scheduled
for a medical procedure...

424
00:48:22,693 --> 00:48:24,027
<i>...on November 2.</i>

425
00:48:24,194 --> 00:48:26,238
The Day of the Dead.
That's tomorrow.

426
00:48:26,405 --> 00:48:29,992
Also identified a member of the group
as Billy Chambers.

427
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:33,495
A fugitive. We've been wanting
to pick him up for some time now.

428
00:48:33,662 --> 00:48:36,623
Billy Chambers? Yeah. You sure?

429
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:38,834
<i>- Bet my badge on it.
- Well...</i>

430
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:41,795
...whatever they're up to,
I can guarantee you...

431
00:48:41,962 --> 00:48:44,006
...that it's going
to happen tomorrow.

432
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:46,842
- So <i>I</i> suggest you--
- What's going down tomorrow?

433
00:48:47,009 --> 00:48:49,052
If you see an opening, take it.

434
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:52,806
- What do you know?
- Not enough. Get inside.

435
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:01,398
I've got nothing.

436
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:04,443
I gotta get in. I got nothing.

437
00:49:05,277 --> 00:49:08,447
Try to make a move.
I don't have a move to make.

438
00:49:10,907 --> 00:49:13,076
What are you gonna do, stupid?

439
00:49:17,706 --> 00:49:20,000
Billy Chambers is on the move.

440
00:49:23,712 --> 00:49:25,714
Where are you going?

441
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:31,053
You're buying a taco.

442
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:33,138
This is too easy.

443
00:49:33,555 --> 00:49:35,474
Where are the other guys?

444
00:49:36,433 --> 00:49:38,352
This is a setup.

445
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,937
It smells like a setup.

446
00:49:47,736 --> 00:49:49,571
I'm making my move.

447
00:50:25,941 --> 00:50:27,776
Billy Chambers.

448
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:33,448
- Well, that depends who's asking.
- I thought that was you.

449
00:50:34,032 --> 00:50:36,576
- Here, let me pay for this.
- Oh, well, thanks.

450
00:50:39,538 --> 00:50:41,206
Oh, goddamn it.

451
00:50:41,373 --> 00:50:44,459
- Is that real?
- Yes, it is.

452
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:47,629
Goddamn.
What took you boys so long?

453
00:50:49,381 --> 00:50:50,924
Whoa, hey, friend.

454
00:50:52,426 --> 00:50:54,010
You ain't gonna need that.

455
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:57,806
Believe it or not, man,
I'm ready to go.

456
00:50:58,473 --> 00:51:00,642
Let's talk over there.

457
00:51:02,728 --> 00:51:04,521
After you.

458
00:51:09,401 --> 00:51:12,070
Man, I just wanna get out of here.

459
00:51:12,362 --> 00:51:15,157
I've been on the run, hiding out here
down in Mexico...

460
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:19,494
...for the last eight goddamn years.

461
00:51:19,661 --> 00:51:24,124
And I've been working
for this here cartel for the last four.

462
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:27,878
I ain't got shit. All I got
is what I'm wearing on my back.

463
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:31,131
I can't go nowhere.
Sort of got me by the balls, you know?

464
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:33,550
Jorge Ramirez.

465
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:38,221
I'll take you in under the FBl's
supervision and protection...

466
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:44,269
...until we can take you back, where
you will be prosecuted for your crimes.

467
00:51:44,436 --> 00:51:46,688
- In the U.S.?
- In the U.S.

468
00:51:48,356 --> 00:51:52,402
The things that I've had to do
for the goddamn cartel are...

469
00:51:52,569 --> 00:51:56,031
...unspeakable.
- You don't know what Barillo's up to?

470
00:51:56,198 --> 00:51:58,241
I'm close to the man.

471
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,911
I'm real close.

472
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:03,830
But he don't let nobody in,
that cocksucker.

473
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:06,166
Can you get him close to Barillo?

474
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,297
Him?

475
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:15,091
I need your help.

476
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:21,848
Then you get me out of here.

477
00:52:22,307 --> 00:52:24,059
Then I'll get you out of here.

478
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,437
Him too.

479
00:53:04,683 --> 00:53:07,352
There's cartel on every corner.

480
00:53:09,271 --> 00:53:12,274
Sands told me
you handle protection.

481
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,776
I don't work for Sands any more.

482
00:53:14,943 --> 00:53:18,071
And since I'm a Mexican,
I can do whatever I want.

483
00:53:19,573 --> 00:53:22,033
Then I guess
I don't work for Sands neither.

484
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,744
- Goodbye.
- There's a price on your head.

485
00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:28,832
I'm going to collect. Why don't you
just tell Barillo everything you know.

486
00:53:28,999 --> 00:53:31,668
And then maybe
he'll just cut off your hands.

487
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:33,128
And if I don't?

488
00:53:33,295 --> 00:53:35,964
You know that old man
I killed in your village?

489
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:38,300
What if your whole village was next?

490
00:53:40,802 --> 00:53:42,637
Would you kill them?

491
00:53:42,804 --> 00:53:45,223
Me? They certainly would.

492
00:53:48,018 --> 00:53:50,270
Then I guess I have no choice...

493
00:53:51,313 --> 00:53:53,231
...but to kill you all.

494
00:54:05,035 --> 00:54:06,661
You...

495
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:08,371
...are last.

496
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:20,295
That should put him out
for a few days...

497
00:56:20,962 --> 00:56:23,298
...and give him some nasty dreams.

498
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:31,848
You have to relax your fingers.

499
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:36,811
Music is pure, from one's soul.

500
00:56:38,104 --> 00:56:44,319
If the soul is pure,
the music flows free.

501
00:56:52,452 --> 00:56:54,662
And if the soul isn't pure?

502
00:56:55,497 --> 00:56:57,499
Then you must practice
like a motherfucker.

503
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:00,794
I present to you...

504
00:57:01,461 --> 00:57:03,505
...Sefior Cucuy.

505
00:57:05,882 --> 00:57:09,219
Get this condescending ass
out of here.

506
00:57:10,553 --> 00:57:12,263
You want me to break his fingers?

507
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,766
No. I want you to chop them off.

508
00:57:16,392 --> 00:57:19,813
- I was just making a joke.
- I wasn't.

509
00:57:28,029 --> 00:57:30,281
Sit, please.

510
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:33,868
So...

511
00:57:34,035 --> 00:57:37,413
...you are the man who brought us...

512
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,290
...the Mariachi.

513
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:43,211
The man I work for, Mr. Sands...

514
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:47,549
...he is using the Mariachi
to kill General Marquez.

515
00:57:47,715 --> 00:57:49,884
So you want to join us...

516
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:51,886
...here's how it works.

517
00:57:52,053 --> 00:57:55,306
There is the bait. There is the trade.

518
00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:58,226
A favor for a favor.

519
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:02,480
So El Mariachi is the trade?

520
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:05,191
You are.

521
00:58:20,707 --> 00:58:22,083
This ain't my line of work.

522
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:34,095
This guy's all fucked up.

523
01:00:24,539 --> 01:00:28,042
General Marquez is arriving!

524
01:00:29,544 --> 01:00:33,589
Bring out the Mariachi!

525
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:40,263
Bring him out to the General!

526
01:00:57,613 --> 01:01:00,908
I didn't kill you before.
Enough blood had been shed.

527
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:04,370
But I see now...

528
01:01:05,455 --> 01:01:07,290
that blood will spill again.

529
01:01:10,752 --> 01:01:13,463
General Marquez,
the Mariachi is not here.

530
01:01:14,005 --> 01:01:15,423
He escaped.

531
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:17,925
You too will escape.

532
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:35,068
He)', hey, hey, hey, Lore--

533
01:01:46,454 --> 01:01:48,081
Why?

534
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:50,416
Practice shooting, not drinking.

535
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:54,796
We are on.

536
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:16,192
By order of the President, they
are searching all vehicles

537
01:02:16,359 --> 01:02:17,235
for guns and drugs.

538
01:02:17,402 --> 01:02:19,862
That fucker's been blockading
all the roads.

539
01:02:20,071 --> 01:02:21,489
Take us back another way.

540
01:02:23,449 --> 01:02:25,993
By order of the President.

541
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,496
Who does this guy think he is?

542
01:02:28,663 --> 01:02:30,498
He wants to get rid of me?

543
01:02:30,665 --> 01:02:32,333
Fine.

544
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:34,377
<i>I'll get rid of him</i>

545
01:02:34,544 --> 01:02:36,629
<i>Replace him, even</i>

546
01:02:36,921 --> 01:02:41,592
<i>Then I will simply disappear.</i>

547
01:02:45,763 --> 01:02:47,765
<i>Hey, vémonos, man.</i>

548
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:05,158
Don't put me out completely.

549
01:03:09,245 --> 01:03:11,539
Have my men wait outside.

550
01:03:54,957 --> 01:03:59,086
Barillo and Dr. Guevera
must already be inside the building...

551
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:03,132
...having entered
through the back or basement.

552
01:04:03,966 --> 01:04:07,094
They should be midprocedure.

553
01:04:12,475 --> 01:04:13,976
Federal agents.

554
01:04:15,937 --> 01:04:17,939
This is going down now.

555
01:06:16,307 --> 01:06:20,478
If Barillo wanted to look
unrecognizable to authorities...

556
01:06:20,645 --> 01:06:22,688
...he succeeded.

557
01:06:25,232 --> 01:06:30,655
Massive tissue loss due to
an only partially completed...

558
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:35,660
...facial reconstruction wasn't
necessarily the cause of death.

559
01:07:07,483 --> 01:07:08,609
They switched bodies.

560
01:07:49,817 --> 01:07:51,444
Barillo!

561
01:07:56,574 --> 01:07:58,325
FBI.

562
01:07:59,827 --> 01:08:02,955
He was anyway.
Bring him along.

563
01:08:07,376 --> 01:08:10,045
Listen, I cannot do everything
by myself.

564
01:08:10,212 --> 01:08:12,131
I need someone
to go in there with me.

565
01:08:12,298 --> 01:08:15,217
No. I lost my inside man.
Probably dead.

566
01:08:15,384 --> 01:08:19,513
And Cucuy, greedy turd that he is,
ratted me out and has disappeared.

567
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,683
Plus, I'm pretty sure the cartel
is shadowing me.

568
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:27,605
Now, listen, I have got a swell bunch
of guys intercepting Marquez's army...

569
01:08:27,772 --> 01:08:29,148
...but they've got no guns.

570
01:08:29,315 --> 01:08:32,777
I want you to understand me.
This is no time to screw the pooch...

571
01:08:32,943 --> 01:08:36,405
...because this is supposed to be
the big dance number, all right?

572
01:08:36,572 --> 01:08:37,907
Hello?

573
01:08:38,073 --> 01:08:39,784
Hello? Are you there?

574
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:42,703
Okay, okay,
I'm going to freak right out.

575
01:08:56,425 --> 01:09:01,680
I would like the puerco pibil
and a tequila with lime.

576
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:12,399
Yeah, listen, I need a newline.

577
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:14,151
This one's been compromised.

578
01:09:14,443 --> 01:09:17,404
Okay? Thank you.

579
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:20,658
I'll be waiting here
at the La Vaca Volando.

580
01:09:20,825 --> 01:09:22,201
That's right.

581
01:09:22,368 --> 01:09:25,454
The Flying Cow.

582
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:31,210
You really didn't see it coming,
did you?

583
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:51,957
Sorry, baby, I told you I wasn't
interested in your scheme.

584
01:10:52,124 --> 01:10:53,918
Too small.

585
01:10:56,837 --> 01:10:59,798
Oh, my Christ. Is that Barillo?

586
01:10:59,965 --> 01:11:04,428
That's the new Barillo. The old Barillo
died in surgery a few hours ago.

587
01:11:04,595 --> 01:11:07,681
What kind of cartel would have you
running its operation?

588
01:11:08,974 --> 01:11:10,434
I'm his daughter.

589
01:11:13,604 --> 01:11:16,690
You've been spying on my operation
for some time.

590
01:11:16,857 --> 01:11:21,195
I feel it's only fair to warn you
that killing me is crossing the line...

591
01:11:21,362 --> 01:11:24,949
...and you will have every marine
from here to Guanténamo Bay...

592
01:11:25,115 --> 01:11:29,119
...up your keister, mister.
So just know that.

593
01:11:29,286 --> 01:11:34,833
Fortunately for you, nothing you did
is worth dying over.

594
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,046
You have only seen too much.

595
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:45,094
We are going to make sure
that doesn't happen again.

596
01:11:57,898 --> 01:12:00,275
On this day of the dead,

597
01:12:01,151 --> 01:12:03,237
I offer you a chance for a new life.

598
01:12:14,164 --> 01:12:16,291
That sounded a little extreme
for a parade.

599
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:18,335
Troops are coming up
from the south.

600
01:12:18,502 --> 01:12:20,921
- Whose?
- Emiliano Marquez.

601
01:12:21,714 --> 01:12:25,009
- Well, what do we do?
- We stay here. This place is fortified.

602
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:29,972
It's much easier to defend this place
than to chance going out in the open.

603
01:12:30,597 --> 01:12:33,976
Nicholas? What are you talking
about, "fortified"? Come here!

604
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:39,523
Just stay clear of those windows, sir.
You let me handle it.

605
01:12:54,705 --> 01:12:57,458
My name is Sheldon Jeffrey Sands.

606
01:12:57,624 --> 01:13:00,127
I work for the Central
Intelligence Agency.

607
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:02,880
I throw shapes. I throw shapes.

608
01:13:03,255 --> 01:13:06,550
I set them up. I watch them fall.

609
01:13:12,848 --> 01:13:14,475
I'm living <i>la vida loca.</i>

610
01:13:30,824 --> 01:13:32,409
No!

611
01:13:36,914 --> 01:13:40,501
I'm terribly sorry about your
chewing gum, but listen.

612
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:42,711
I will give you this...

613
01:13:46,173 --> 01:13:48,217
...if you'll be my eyes.

614
01:13:48,383 --> 01:13:50,511
It's a dollar.

615
01:13:50,969 --> 01:13:52,012
I meant...

616
01:13:52,596 --> 01:13:53,889
...this.

617
01:13:54,306 --> 01:13:57,142
I need you to take me
to the center of the city.

618
01:13:58,352 --> 01:14:00,020
Is someone following you?

619
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:03,816
It's difficult for me to tell right now
because I'm having a bad day.

620
01:14:03,982 --> 01:14:06,068
Do you see someone?

621
01:14:07,111 --> 01:14:10,197
Yes, he's getting close.

622
01:14:11,115 --> 01:14:14,243
Listen, have you ever seen
one of these?

623
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:19,206
Have you used one?

624
01:14:19,873 --> 01:14:21,583
Don't ever,
because they're bad.

625
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:24,294
But what I need for you to do
is to aim this...

626
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:28,465
...at the bad man who's following us
and shoot him in the head.

627
01:14:28,632 --> 01:14:29,883
Kill him?

628
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:33,720
Oh, yeah. Very métalo.
Close?

629
01:14:36,014 --> 01:14:38,100
Okay. Smoke him.

630
01:14:39,059 --> 01:14:43,564
Smoke the fucker. Just send him
straight to fucking Broadway.

631
01:14:46,024 --> 01:14:47,067
What?

632
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,320
Okay. Come here.

633
01:14:54,408 --> 01:14:55,909
Right or left?

634
01:15:02,749 --> 01:15:04,376
Was that my right or your right?

635
01:15:28,192 --> 01:15:29,484
Wrong man.

636
01:15:31,361 --> 01:15:32,946
Sorry.

637
01:15:49,087 --> 01:15:50,339
Look me in the eyes...

638
01:15:52,466 --> 01:15:54,092
...and then kill me.

639
01:16:11,944 --> 01:16:15,906
Good boy. Now you're thinking.

640
01:16:16,073 --> 01:16:20,577
Take me to the center of the city,
where there will be even more dough.

641
01:16:42,766 --> 01:16:44,851
For you

642
01:16:46,061 --> 01:16:48,689
for our daughter...

643
01:16:50,774 --> 01:16:52,734
for Mexico.

644
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:32,649
In my past, I'd take on evil
from the bottom.

645
01:17:33,233 --> 01:17:35,569
Now I realize...

646
01:17:35,736 --> 01:17:37,404
...start at the top.

647
01:17:38,155 --> 01:17:42,117
The President is a good man.

648
01:17:43,577 --> 01:17:46,330
I'll go around back.
Meet me in five.

649
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:51,918
Watch him.

650
01:18:03,055 --> 01:18:05,307
We could torture him.

651
01:18:07,601 --> 01:18:09,144
He's FBI.

652
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:12,105
He's retired.

653
01:18:12,731 --> 01:18:13,940
That doesn't count.

654
01:18:17,944 --> 01:18:19,696
I was tortured once.

655
01:18:19,863 --> 01:18:21,323
I didn't like it.

656
01:18:22,282 --> 01:18:24,493
You know what the fucked up thing is?

657
01:18:25,285 --> 01:18:27,412
They tore out my left nut.

658
01:18:30,499 --> 01:18:33,960
That sort of turned me off of the
whole thing.

659
01:18:34,503 --> 01:18:36,922
What should we do with him?

660
01:18:40,801 --> 01:18:43,178
Let's go eat about it.

661
01:18:56,066 --> 01:18:59,319
Hey Snow White, watch that
fucking pig.

662
01:19:11,415 --> 01:19:13,583
Just lay low.
They'll leave us alone.

663
01:19:25,095 --> 01:19:26,179
What the fuck?!

664
01:19:27,347 --> 01:19:29,516
I don't like military.

665
01:19:41,528 --> 01:19:43,071
Get out.

666
01:19:43,572 --> 01:19:45,699
- Why are we stopping?
- We can't go further.

667
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:49,536
- Why not?
- Look out there. It's a coup d'état!

668
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:53,457
I can't see, fuck-mook!
I have no eyes.

669
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:56,918
Well, then listen to it, fucker!

670
01:19:57,085 --> 01:20:01,548
The military's throwing over the
presidency. All hell's broken loose.

671
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,134
You guys have to get out now.

672
01:20:10,307 --> 01:20:13,852
Keep your money because
I'm not moving one inch.

673
01:21:56,830 --> 01:21:58,415
Fuck! Now what?

674
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,501
- Do you know armor-piercing bullets?
- Yeah.

675
01:22:01,668 --> 01:22:03,628
These are much better.

676
01:22:27,193 --> 01:22:28,903
What do you want in life?

677
01:22:31,031 --> 01:22:32,324
Good choice.

678
01:22:44,336 --> 01:22:45,545
- You ready?
- Yeah.

679
01:22:45,712 --> 01:22:46,921
Okay, let's go!

680
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:38,723
It's no longer safe to be here.
Let's go.

681
01:23:56,408 --> 01:23:58,993
You have a meeting
with General Marquez, sir.

682
01:24:51,004 --> 01:24:53,798
It feels like you need
some protection, sir.

683
01:24:56,843 --> 01:24:57,927
Who are you guys?

684
01:24:59,012 --> 01:25:01,014
Sons of Mexico, sir.

685
01:25:10,899 --> 01:25:13,359
Are we in front of the building?

686
01:25:23,578 --> 01:25:24,621
Okay.

687
01:25:26,915 --> 01:25:28,792
This is it, kid.

688
01:25:32,962 --> 01:25:35,048
I don't hear you running.

689
01:27:07,515 --> 01:27:10,602
Why would they want me dead?
I've done nothing but help them.

690
01:27:10,768 --> 01:27:13,771
What are you talking about?
Let me show you something.

691
01:27:13,938 --> 01:27:15,899
Look out there! You see?

692
01:27:17,775 --> 01:27:20,320
Well, don't look too close,
Presidente.

693
01:27:20,486 --> 01:27:23,698
But your people are out there
fighting for you, you understand?

694
01:27:23,865 --> 01:27:25,408
Take off your jacket.

695
01:27:25,575 --> 01:27:27,493
- This also?
- Yes.

696
01:27:28,328 --> 01:27:29,454
Put this on.

697
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:03,071
What is this, payoff?

698
01:28:03,237 --> 01:28:05,281
This is money someone paid
to kill you.

699
01:28:05,448 --> 01:28:08,368
And now it's money
to save your life, Presidente.

700
01:28:08,701 --> 01:28:11,579
Here, get some tequila for yourself.

701
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:49,993
Leave here and lock the door.

702
01:28:58,334 --> 01:28:59,836
Carolina?

703
01:29:02,505 --> 01:29:03,673
She died.

704
01:29:05,758 --> 01:29:06,843
Your daughter?

705
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:09,804
She died.

706
01:29:11,931 --> 01:29:12,932
And you?

707
01:29:17,061 --> 01:29:17,937
Dead.

708
01:29:20,481 --> 01:29:21,524
And I?

709
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,110
Alive and well.

710
01:29:40,251 --> 01:29:41,461
In hell.

711
01:29:58,436 --> 01:30:01,481
Everything in its place...

712
01:31:05,837 --> 01:31:08,840
You fucking little monkey.

713
01:31:09,549 --> 01:31:11,217
Stand up.

714
01:31:18,099 --> 01:31:20,059
See anything you like?

715
01:31:34,448 --> 01:31:35,491
No.

716
01:32:00,933 --> 01:32:05,062
Do you remember a man
named Archuleta?

717
01:32:05,229 --> 01:32:07,231
Why?

718
01:32:07,565 --> 01:32:12,236
I present to you Special Agent
Jorge Ramirez.

719
01:32:14,363 --> 01:32:19,785
You tortured and murdered
Agent Archuleta. He was my partner.

720
01:32:20,077 --> 01:32:21,662
He was also my friend.

721
01:32:22,288 --> 01:32:27,168
Agent Ramirez, you have
to follow certain rules.

722
01:32:27,335 --> 01:32:30,254
Oh, I'm retired.

723
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:34,383
Rules don't apply to me
any more than they do to you.

724
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:36,969
- Mr. Chambers.
- Yes, sir.

725
01:32:37,136 --> 01:32:38,930
You're just going to stand there?

726
01:32:39,555 --> 01:32:43,059
I'm afraid anything but standing's
gonna cost you extra.

727
01:32:47,438 --> 01:32:48,814
You leave me no choice.

728
01:33:56,215 --> 01:33:58,301
Did you get your man?

729
01:33:58,467 --> 01:33:59,719
One of them.

730
01:34:01,762 --> 01:34:07,518
If that isn't interagency cooperation,
I just don't know what is.

731
01:34:09,186 --> 01:34:10,980
See you later.

732
01:34:12,732 --> 01:34:14,483
Fuck you.

733
01:34:17,403 --> 01:34:18,946
Are you okay?

734
01:34:20,114 --> 01:34:21,574
I don't know.

735
01:34:22,908 --> 01:34:24,827
You will be.

736
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:36,482
What do you want in life?

737
01:35:39,402 --> 01:35:41,028
To be free...

738
01:35:42,405 --> 01:35:44,365
Simple.

739
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:48,369
No.
