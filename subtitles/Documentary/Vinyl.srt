1
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:42,500
Thank you!

2
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,959
One, two, three, four!

3
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:33,126
Oi.

4
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:39,334
Where the fuck have you been?

5
00:01:50,334 --> 00:01:54,375
Johnny boy, have you got me rent?

6
00:01:54,376 --> 00:01:58,584
Yeah, yeah, Mrs.
O'Malley. I got it.

7
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:30,501
It's paradise, isn't it?

8
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:43,626
Hey, did you remember to tell Mrs.
O'Malley about the leaking gas canisters?

9
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:47,459
- Here you go, Mrs. O.
- Thanks.

10
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,333
- No, I forgot.
- Well, don't forget, babe.

11
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:53,583
I can't bring up a child
in these conditions.

12
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:55,792
But you're not even pregnant yet.

13
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:03,459
God.

14
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:13,209
Some flyers from the first gig.
With Thrasher and the Buzzcocks.

15
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:18,416
The good old, bad old days.

16
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:21,042
And I'm all washed up.

17
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:36,625
I've got to get that.

18
00:03:36,626 --> 00:03:39,251
Leave it. Just leave it.

19
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:43,667
- Might be important.
- Johnny, leave it.

20
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:48,083
Keith Moon, Sid
Vicious, now Thrasher.

21
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:50,333
Drugs go with genius.
He loved drugs.

22
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:52,666
Yeah, well, now he's dead.

23
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,583
Kev. Kev, it's him.
It's him. It's Bono.

24
00:03:55,584 --> 00:03:58,708
- Who? Where?
- Johnny Jones, Weapons of Happiness.

25
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,584
Who?

26
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:04,166
We have gathered here today
to share in the loss

27
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:07,416
of Emrys Upyerwest,
a.k.a. Thrasher.

28
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:10,916
If anyone asks, I'm doing a movie
soundtrack for Guy Ritchie.

29
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,666
- Right?
- Guy Ritchie. Yeah. Right.

30
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:16,208
- Look, look, look.
- Yeah.

31
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,208
- Mike Peters.
- What?

32
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,416
- Oh, my God, it is.
- Hey.

33
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:21,791
- Hi!

34
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:23,791
- Mike!
- Hey, Johnny!

35
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:25,625
- How you doing, man?
- I'm cool, I'm cool.

36
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:27,166
- How are you?
- I'm not to bad.

37
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,041
- You're looking good.
- And you. You look great.

38
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:30,875
- Is this your boy?
- This is Dylan, yeah.

39
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:32,250
- Say hi to Johnny, mate.
- Hey.

40
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:34,125
This is Johnny from the
Weapons of Happiness.

41
00:04:34,126 --> 00:04:37,000
We do not come here today
with any glib answers.

42
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,541
We're stunned, we're hurting.

43
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:41,666
We haven't a clue what's going on.

44
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:44,041
It's like the Punk
Rock Hall of Fame.

45
00:04:44,042 --> 00:04:47,625
They all turned out for
Thrasher's funeral.

46
00:04:47,626 --> 00:04:50,000
- He wasn't even that famous.
- He loved life.

47
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:52,333
- I'm more famous than him.
- He loved music.

48
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,000
He loved dogs.

49
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,000
Death is the destiny of everyone...

50
00:04:57,001 --> 00:05:00,250
- All right, Diggle?
- Considering the circumstances.

51
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:02,458
I hear the Buzzcocks
are on a world tour.

52
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:03,875
Any chance of a gig?

53
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:06,166
Are the Weapons of
Happiness back together?

54
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:08,166
No. And God rest his soul.

55
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:10,875
I mean, if you need a guitarist,
you know, in the Buzzcocks...

56
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:12,375
It might be difficult to believe...

57
00:05:12,376 --> 00:05:14,083
- That's bad taste, isn't it, mate?
- ...but the Bible says that it's actually

58
00:05:14,084 --> 00:05:16,916
good for us to come here today.

59
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,000
- I ain't seen the Weapons since we split.
- In Ecclesiastes, Chapter 7, Verse 2,

60
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:22,750
God says this: "It is better to
go to a house of mourning"...

61
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:26,208
- Well, they're over there.
- God is saying,

62
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:29,667
"It is better to come to a
funeral than to a pub."

63
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:36,583
Look at Robbie... how fat he is.

64
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:40,875
Griff. He looks like a
rocker with that ponytail.

65
00:05:40,876 --> 00:05:43,917
Ah, there he is.

66
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:47,291
Minto. He lost all his hair.

67
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:50,416
Good. That's death for a rock star.

68
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,750
Don't start where you
left off, babes.

69
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:56,376
Come on. Life's too
short for enemies.

70
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:01,708
Val!

71
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:04,833
Oi, tosser! You owe me money.

72
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:06,959
I owe you nothing, mate.

73
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:11,542
Got you there.

74
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:14,583
Bloody hell, Johnny, eh?

75
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:16,667
You look like a bag of shit, mate.

76
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:19,416
Look at that. Still got
the same boots on.

77
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:22,125
- They were a good investment.
- All right, mate?

78
00:06:22,126 --> 00:06:24,000
A bit slitty-wristy really.

79
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:26,000
Mental about Thrasher.

80
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:30,041
I'd have thought heroin, choking
on his own puke, not angina.

81
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:32,333
What's he expect?
Didn't look after himself.

82
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:35,625
- Didn't eat properly.
- So where you living now?

83
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:37,583
- Back home? London?
- No, I'm here, mate.

84
00:06:37,584 --> 00:06:39,416
- Is Elaine here?
- Yeah.

85
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:42,625
Two youngest ones are at home.
Now look. Paris and Rio.

86
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:44,459
Rio and Paris.

87
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:47,041
What about you, Johnny?
Have you got any kids or what?

88
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:48,916
No. And do me a favor.

89
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:51,458
Don't bring up the subject
when Jules is about, eh?

90
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:53,750
You wanna get a spur on, mate.
It's a well-known fact

91
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:56,916
that birth defects rocket
after the age of 40.

92
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,251
- That what happened to you?
- Eh?

93
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:03,291
How old's your kid now,
then, eight, nine?

94
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,458
Well, the oldest one...
No, he's 21.

95
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:06,708
Bloody hell.

96
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:09,791
He was two when the band split up.
That was 20 years ago.

97
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:12,291
Yeah, well, sorry about all that.

98
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:15,625
It weren't like you split the band up
and then deprived us of our livelihood.

99
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:17,541
Nothing important
like that, was it?

100
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:20,291
Frankly, it was the best thing that
ever happened to me in my life.

101
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:22,083
So how come you never
went back to London?

102
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:23,875
How come?

103
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,083
'Cause I got a license
to print money, mate.

104
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:28,875
Here. Look. Look at
that watch, right?

105
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:32,459
Look at the shirt.
Roberto Cavalli, mate.

106
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:36,041
- What's that say on there?
- It says "B".

107
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:38,291
B. B for "Bentley."
That's the car I drive.

108
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,541
Bloody hell.

109
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:43,000
I've got 17 nursing homes up and
down the coast of North Wales.

110
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:45,541
- Bloody hell.
- Both kids go to private school.

111
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:47,375
Very rotten.

112
00:07:47,376 --> 00:07:50,333
What about you, Mint? Are you still
doing the old radio jingles?

113
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:54,333
No. I'm a photographer,
videographer.

114
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:57,208
Weddings, birthdays, funerals.

115
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,750
In fact, we're doing
this one over there.

116
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:02,166
Planet, planet political

117
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:04,541
Planet, planet political star

118
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:07,083
Planet, planet political

119
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:10,083
Typical Thrasher, isn't it?
Not even a sandwich.

120
00:08:10,084 --> 00:08:13,291
I'll tell you what, why don't
we all go back to the Bistro?

121
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,251
Champagne's on me.

122
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:22,708
Here's to the Bistro and the old
good old, bad old days, oh.

123
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:24,708
Coming back after all
this time, boys, eh?

124
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:27,459
Good God, must've spent my
fucking life in the Rock Box.

125
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:30,459
Remember that?

126
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:32,708
Listen, Val said that she
can give us a lift home.

127
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:34,833
So are you gonna come,
or are you staying here?

128
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:37,375
- Yeah, think I might shoo.
- Don't think so, Jaws.

129
00:08:37,376 --> 00:08:39,000
He's gonna abandon
one of these for that?

130
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:41,125
- Jo...
- Stick around for a bit.

131
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:43,625
- Can we just crash at...
- We'll see.

132
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:45,334
Don't go to sleep.

133
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,750
- No, I'm talking to Jo.
- Don't get in any trouble, all right?

134
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:50,166
- See you later.
- Don't listen to him.

135
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:53,208
- Is that your missus?
- What, Jo? No, she's not my missus. no.

136
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:56,334
- You dirty bastard.
- What?

137
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,208
What badness, eh?

138
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:07,208
It's like a castle.

139
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:09,125
It's a manor house.

140
00:09:09,126 --> 00:09:11,666
Used to belong to Henry VIII.

141
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:16,959
I think we'll take it to the east
wing so I don't wake the family up.

142
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:20,084
Come on, Minto.

143
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:23,875
Welcome to my lair.

144
00:09:23,876 --> 00:09:26,083
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah, have a look up there.

145
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:27,708
Bring back memories.

146
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:29,375
Who designed this, Dannii Minogue?

147
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:33,041
We look a lot younger
there, don't we, eh?

148
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,500
Look at that.

149
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:37,001
Look at you, you fat,
long-haired hippy bastard.

150
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:40,917
Oh, man, all that time.
And look at this.

151
00:09:42,251 --> 00:09:44,583
That was that dental
nurse from Durham.

152
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,666
What a bunk up.
Best sex I ever had.

153
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,375
Yeah. Have a look at that.

154
00:09:49,376 --> 00:09:52,375
Nicked from the Bay
City Rollers in 1975.

155
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:55,625
Oh, that is better than sex, mate.
That is something else.

156
00:09:55,626 --> 00:09:57,458
- Look at that beauty.
- Here. Look.

157
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:59,375
- That was you.
- Let's have a look.

158
00:09:59,376 --> 00:10:01,333
Grab that one.

159
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,791
It's only got one string.
What's up with you?

160
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:07,416
- Don't you like the skiffle bass?
- Haven't changed a bit. Look at that.

161
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:09,291
Right.

162
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:12,208
Right. Get on the drums.

163
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:15,291
- Sure, plug in.
- Yeah, let's plug it in.

164
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:17,500
I'm a bit rusty, though.

165
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:20,251
Sound like the Tin Man.

166
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:22,875
That's good sound, isn't it?

167
00:10:22,876 --> 00:10:24,959
Is this your drum kit or your kids?

168
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:29,041
Yeah.

169
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:31,416
- What are you playing?
- Three chords.

170
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:34,626
You can write a great punk
song with three chords.

171
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:40,625
Wait a minute.

172
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:42,875
Look, let me record it.
Wait a minute.

173
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,041
You got an 8-track?

174
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:47,291
No. I just do it on the computer.

175
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,708
I design all my own Web
sites and everything.

176
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:53,292
I'm a recording engineer now.

177
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:56,959
Come on. Do that
thing you just did.

178
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:18,291
Go for your laugh, kick yourself

179
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:21,584
And do your brains in, do it today

180
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,041
Destroy the system

181
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:37,666
Smash it all up, lose control

182
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:40,959
Start a revolution in
your livin' room now

183
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:44,250
Johnny, wakey, wakey!

184
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:46,876
Hands off snakey!

185
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:52,041
If you want to chunder,
the toilet's down the hall.

186
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:54,375
I already spewed up
in the ice bucket.

187
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:56,626
Oh, charming.

188
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,708
That's good. Who is that?

189
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:02,375
- It's us last night.
- Us?

190
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:06,125
Yeah, well, I've put a loop
on it and spliced the vocals,

191
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:09,209
but basically it's us.

192
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:14,500
- That's us.
- Yeah. It's not perfect,

193
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,750
but it's better than what we
had the first time, mate.

194
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:18,791
You remember that?

195
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:21,416
- You finished mixing it yet, Robbie?
- Yeah, I've just finished.

196
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:23,625
Robbie, you got any Alka-Seltzer?

197
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:26,084
Yeah. In the kitchen.

198
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:30,916
It's good, though.

199
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:34,209
It's very good, it is.

200
00:12:37,376 --> 00:12:39,125
Make us a cup of tea
while you're at it?

201
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:40,500
- And me.
- Yeah, and me.

202
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:42,166
I made it last time.

203
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:44,500
What last time?

204
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:48,333
Sound Studios 1993.
It's Griff's turn.

205
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,291
Just make the bloody tea!

206
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:55,750
That is ever...
That's blinding, that is.

207
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:58,000
That could be a hit.

208
00:12:58,001 --> 00:13:01,125
Wouldn't it be something, back in
the charts after all these years?

209
00:13:01,126 --> 00:13:04,041
Be a bloody miracle,
that's what it would be.

210
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:05,541
Where's the tea bags?

211
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:07,542
Next to the All-Bran.

212
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:11,625
Know what we should do?
Put it out as a single.

213
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:14,458
Announce to the world, "Weapons
of Happiness are back."

214
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,416
- I'm not back.
- No, I'm too busy.

215
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:18,666
I've got better things to do.

216
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:21,666
Better than being in a band?
Better than having a hit single?

217
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,208
Come on, Robbie. Don't tell me you
don't missing being in a band.

218
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:27,708
I don't miss touring about
in some crappy old van

219
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:29,333
and living like a refugee.

220
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:31,666
And we ain't got a recording
contract no more.

221
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:35,291
When the old label get a load of this,
they'll sign us back up in no time.

222
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:39,209
Yeah, right. Make sure the money
gets split four ways this time.

223
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:44,959
Don't want to get screwed over
again like we were last time.

224
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,875
You got 15% on songs
you never wrote.

225
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:52,583
What other band does that?

226
00:13:52,584 --> 00:13:55,041
U2.

227
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,750
Well, you save Africa from
poverty like Bono did,

228
00:13:57,751 --> 00:14:00,791
and I'll give you 10% more.

229
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm not interested, mate.

230
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:06,584
The band split up years ago.
That was the end of that chapter.

231
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:09,625
- These are great, these, aren't they?
- I'm gonna get tea.

232
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:12,083
That's a horrible
bloody cup of tea.

233
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,459
Well, you go down and make it then.

234
00:14:16,126 --> 00:14:19,042
Jules! Jules, I'm back.

235
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:24,000
God! Johnny!

236
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:26,916
You got to hear this.

237
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:29,291
I'm trying to sleep.
Have you only just got in?

238
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:31,166
Yeah. And I feel brilliant.

239
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,709
I haven't felt this good in years.

240
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:42,250
Where did you dig that up?

241
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:44,125
We did that last night.

242
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:46,416
Last night? It sounds like
one of your early ones.

243
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:50,375
I know, but better.
This could be a hit.

244
00:14:50,376 --> 00:14:53,083
- Yeah. Probably.
- Probably? No, no, no.

245
00:14:53,084 --> 00:14:55,375
Definitely!

246
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:58,541
Oh, no. Oh, God, no.

247
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:00,916
No. You're actually thinking
of doing this, aren't you?

248
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:03,791
- Yeah. Why not?
- Johnny!

249
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:05,666
Because we came here for a funeral.

250
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,750
We didn't come back here so you
can get the band back together.

251
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm not getting the band back together.
I just want to put out a record.

252
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:13,291
I've got an appointment
at the fertility clinic.

253
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:15,208
Look, I want to go down to London.

254
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:17,458
I'll hop on the train to
the old record company.

255
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,500
- No way! No way!
- We'll be back in Ireland

256
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,375
in a couple days!

257
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:23,458
Listen, I'm doing
this for both of us.

258
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:27,876
If this record hits,
right, we'll be rich.

259
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:33,166
You can have as many
babies as you want.

260
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:36,042
Can I have that in writing?

261
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:28,666
- Stuart Conley.
- Who?

262
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:31,500
- Stuart Conley, head of A&R.
- Nobody by that name works here.

263
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:33,541
Jim Breen's head of A&R.

264
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:36,500
Well, tell him Johnny Jones, Weapons
of Happiness, is here to see him.

265
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:38,750
- Do you have an appointment?
- Listen, mate.

266
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:41,000
I recorded three gold
albums for this company.

267
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,000
- I don't need an appointment.
- Okay.

268
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:46,208
Buzzcocks. Yeah, we opened for them

269
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:48,250
at Eric's in Liverpool
back when we started.

270
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:49,583
Who?

271
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:51,500
The Buzzcocks. You like them.

272
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:53,916
I never heard them.
I just collect vintage T-shirts.

273
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:56,416
Heard of my band,
Weapons of Happiness?

274
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:58,709
No, but I've heard of Liverpool.

275
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:04,333
Johnny, pleased to meet you.
Great to finally meet you.

276
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:06,791
My dad loves you. He dressed
a bit like you growing up.

277
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,125
- Listen, have you eaten?
- No.

278
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:09,500
You got a spare half an hour?

279
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:11,375
Come on. Let's go have this
conversation on down the pub.

280
00:17:11,376 --> 00:17:14,126
Awesome food.
They do a great lunch.

281
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,791
- I don't eat meat.
- Oh, you're a veggie, eh?

282
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:20,125
Paul McCartney's wife's sausages...
you had them?

283
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:22,583
- What?
- Linda McCartney's sausages.

284
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,292
Pretty good.

285
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:31,667
Didn't you guys break up just as
we booked you on a world tour?

286
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:34,041
Yeah. I was an intern
when it happened.

287
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:36,458
It rips up a band
when it's going that way.

288
00:17:36,459 --> 00:17:40,209
And here's the good news.
We're back together again.

289
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:43,791
We're better than ever.
Want to re-sign us?

290
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:46,751
The major labels are sniffing
about, but we're loyal.

291
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:49,751
I'd love to sign you.

292
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:54,375
But you're just not
in our demographic.

293
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:57,083
I'm just a cog in
the machine, but...

294
00:17:57,084 --> 00:18:00,208
our arena is tweens to twenties.

295
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:03,166
- The Jammie Dodgers, Bling-bling.
- "Bling-bling"?

296
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,916
We just signed Room
Service up in Newcastle.

297
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,250
They're still at school doing their
A-levels, but they're genius.

298
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:11,541
- They only wear monochrome.
- Who's the singer?

299
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:13,791
- Charlie.
- Charlie.

300
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,292
Yeah, he's asked for my songs.

301
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:21,084
- Which Charlie?
- Singer Charlie.

302
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:23,334
Charlie's a girl.

303
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:26,833
Yeah, I know Charlie's a girl.

304
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:28,666
I'm thinking of another Charlie.
I get confused.

305
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:32,416
These kids... they ring me up all
the time asking for my material.

306
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:34,541
Well, in the hands of someone
like Charlie Gautier,

307
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:37,375
it'd be more of a statement of
ironic anxiety about influence

308
00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:38,833
if she's calling you.

309
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,667
She's a cultural wit.

310
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:45,208
You need to listen to this.
It's great.

311
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,541
I have no doubts, but our company

312
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:50,501
doesn't want to sign
anyone over the age of 30.

313
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:54,876
It's like watching your
parents having sex.

314
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:57,833
You get your royalty
checks on time?

315
00:18:57,834 --> 00:19:00,001
Not as much as I'd like, but yeah.

316
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:04,667
I can't wait to tell
my dad I've seen you.

317
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:08,166
So many happy memories
of growing up.

318
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:11,583
- I best be off.
- Just listen to this.

319
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:17,667
Listen, I respect you too
much to waste your time.

320
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:22,625
Hey, this is Room Service now.

321
00:19:22,626 --> 00:19:24,875
This is Charlie singing.

322
00:19:24,876 --> 00:19:29,000
I found this girl.
Amazing, isn't she?

323
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,542
Gotta get back. Ciao.

324
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:42,333
What's so good about it?

325
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:45,042
Doing that years ago.

326
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,126
Pretenders.

327
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:57,208
You want it that way?

328
00:19:57,209 --> 00:19:59,709
You can have it that way.

329
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:04,751
You want image?
I'll give you image.

330
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:13,834
Welcome to my creation.

331
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:30,333
Blimey! Jonesy!

332
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:32,541
You still wearing those
boots after 20 years?

333
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:34,750
- What are you doing here?
- Yeah, well, I was just passing.

334
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:37,666
I thought I'd drop by, yeah?
No. I'm with Chris.

335
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:40,750
It's okay. He's with me.
You still making music?

336
00:20:40,751 --> 00:20:43,625
No, no. It's like watching
your parents shag.

337
00:20:43,626 --> 00:20:47,291
I'm a manager now. I've got
this genius band out of Wales.

338
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:50,625
- Four young kids, yeah?
- It takes five for a successful band.

339
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:52,583
Five. Yeah.

340
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,875
One of them wants to go to art
college, but I won't let him.

341
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:57,916
They've got a great look.
Really original, man.

342
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:00,625
- The Single Shots. Nice name.
- Yeah, great name, mate.

343
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,916
Massive on the Welsh
underground, yeah?

344
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:05,166
We're selling thousands
of units on our Web site,

345
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:07,166
and they're still
doing their A-levels.

346
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:10,333
They've got a kind of...
You know, it's like a primitive,

347
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:12,083
urban punk vibe, yeah?

348
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:14,791
And guess who's gone mental for them.
Wants them on their tour.

349
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:16,875
Hmm? Room Service.

350
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,291
Nice. I'll give them
a listen later.

351
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:21,541
I better get back onto it now.
Nice to see you.

352
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:23,083
Thanks for dropping in. Take care.

353
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:25,083
- This is Chris Knowles...
- Thanks a lot.

354
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:28,041
on Sound 1, Radio 1, 103,

355
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:30,917
and this is the Beatles.

356
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,666
I told you. No one's interested.

357
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:40,375
We'll find another record company.
Rome wasn't built in a day.

358
00:21:40,376 --> 00:21:42,208
No, but it fell in one, didn't it?

359
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:46,209
Minto's right. Just drop it, John.

360
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:49,876
We're too old for this.

361
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:56,000
Do you wanna put the
tickets in there, babe?

362
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:57,541
Yeah.

363
00:21:57,542 --> 00:21:59,541
You Okay?

364
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:02,750
Yeah, I'm fine. Just looking forward
to getting back to Ireland.

365
00:22:02,751 --> 00:22:04,791
And now, here's a new
band out of Wales.

366
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:08,250
And when it hits number one,
remember where you heard it first.

367
00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:10,833
It's us.

368
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:13,292
That's our record.

369
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:19,875
What are you doing?

370
00:22:19,876 --> 00:22:22,167
I'm unpacking.

371
00:22:23,584 --> 00:22:26,667
Mrs. Hanratty's had an accident.

372
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:31,833
Sunshine Care Homes.
Robbie speaking.

373
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:34,000
Robbie, turn the radio on.

374
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:35,833
We're on Sound Radio 1.

375
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:38,791
Yeah. They sometimes play us
on the '80s flashback set.

376
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:41,333
No, mate. "Free Rock
and Roll" is on!

377
00:22:41,334 --> 00:22:42,583
- Oh.
- "Free Rock and Roll"!

378
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:46,083
Free rock and roll,
free rock and roll, oh

379
00:22:46,084 --> 00:22:48,708
Go for the throat, yes,
destroy the system

380
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:50,791
Smash it all up, lose control

381
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:53,666
We've done it! It's
"Free Rock and Roll"!

382
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:56,626
We're on! Yes!

383
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:09,000
Johnny! It's brilliant!
I feel great.

384
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:10,833
I can't believe we're
back on the radio.

385
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:13,333
I told you. When it's from the
heart, people feel it, eh?

386
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:16,291
That is "Free Rock and Roll,"
by the great un-signed band

387
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:18,833
out of Wales, the Single Shots.

388
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:21,583
- This is Chris Knowles on Sound...
- Huh?

389
00:23:21,584 --> 00:23:24,458
- Single Shots? Hang on.
- Go on, then.

390
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:27,583
- It's not a big deal.
- It's not that big a deal?

391
00:23:27,584 --> 00:23:30,208
We're getting airplay there,
and no one knows it's us.

392
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:32,666
Exactly. We're coming
in under the radar.

393
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:34,458
- It's perfecto.
- Perfecto?

394
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:38,000
- We haven't even got a bloody contract.
- It doesn't matter.

395
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,458
The deejay thinks the Single
Shots are the kind of

396
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:43,625
hot young band the record
companies are looking for.

397
00:23:43,626 --> 00:23:45,708
Yeah, but it's not them, it's us.

398
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:49,459
And what a stupid,
stupid bloody name.

399
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:52,750
We're too old.

400
00:23:52,751 --> 00:23:54,833
Mr. Dobbs needs the toilet.

401
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:57,459
No. He just thinks he does.
He's got a bag.

402
00:23:58,209 --> 00:24:01,291
If people don't take Weapons of
Happiness seriously anymore,

403
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:04,875
I say we give them what
they want... a virtual band.

404
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:07,458
What, you mean, like,
computerize ourselves?

405
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:10,625
No. We hire a load of spotty
kids to stand in for us

406
00:24:10,626 --> 00:24:12,666
and mime our music, right?

407
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:16,000
And when the single hits the charts,
we reveal the scam to the press

408
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:19,166
and shame the corporate tossers
for the hypocrites they are.

409
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:23,291
Oh, right. And whose money is gonna be
paying for the hire of these school kids?

410
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:25,583
Yours, mate? 'Cause it ain't
gonna be mine, I'm telling you.

411
00:24:25,584 --> 00:24:28,750
We chop them in on
the profits. Yeah?

412
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:31,209
Very entrepreneurial,
don't you think?

413
00:24:31,751 --> 00:24:34,333
I ain't got time for this.
I got a business to run.

414
00:24:34,334 --> 00:24:36,000
Yeah. And I can't give them a job.

415
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:37,916
You don't have to.

416
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:39,750
The fake band do all the work,

417
00:24:39,751 --> 00:24:42,583
and we laugh all the
way to the bank.

418
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:44,834
Well, I suppose I could
do with the extra cash.

419
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:48,876
Minto?

420
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:55,125
All I know is, right, I'm on the
radio, and I want to get paid.

421
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:57,625
And if that means that
we have to hire a bunch

422
00:24:57,626 --> 00:25:01,959
of talentless, spotty school
kids to get it, all right.

423
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,459
All right. So be it, mate.

424
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:07,584
But I'm watching you.

425
00:25:30,001 --> 00:25:33,251
Shh. It's a rock and roll swindle.

426
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,750
Free rock and roll,
free rock and...

427
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:50,666
Sorry. Can I start... Sorry.

428
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:53,125
- Free rock and roll
- Free rock and roll

429
00:25:53,126 --> 00:25:55,541
Free rock and roll, oh

430
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:58,041
Go for the throat,
destroy the system

431
00:25:58,042 --> 00:26:00,583
Smash it all up, lose control

432
00:26:00,584 --> 00:26:05,000
Start a revolution in
your livin' room now

433
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:07,416
- Go ahead.
- I was told there'd be one.

434
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:10,376
Go for the throat,
destroy the system

435
00:26:11,709 --> 00:26:13,584
Free rock and roll

436
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:16,167
Free rock and roll

437
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:18,626
Smash it all up

438
00:26:19,876 --> 00:26:22,250
Free rock and roll,
free rock and roll

439
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:25,459
Free rock and roll, oh

440
00:26:27,626 --> 00:26:30,709
I can't really play guitar.

441
00:26:45,126 --> 00:26:48,083
Why do I have to be a girl?

442
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:50,041
Told you he'd be like this.

443
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,000
Must be his time of the month.

444
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:53,583
There's a lad outside
wants an audition.

445
00:26:53,584 --> 00:26:55,750
Tell him to piss off.
We got a band.

446
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:59,041
I tried, but he won't go away.
He's a real pain in the ass.

447
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:02,541
- All right?
- Auditions are over, mate.

448
00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:05,041
Yeah, but your band's gonna
be shit without me, so...

449
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:08,875
Listen, you spout that kind of cockiness
when you've got three gold records.

450
00:27:08,876 --> 00:27:11,666
- What's your name, drainpipe?
- Drainpipe.

451
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:13,875
He reminds you of Johnny.

452
00:27:13,876 --> 00:27:16,834
Same puffy strut and pushy manner.

453
00:27:20,584 --> 00:27:25,584
I'm a shadow in the shape of a man

454
00:27:26,126 --> 00:27:31,459
You may say I'm shallow,
but I say I'm bland

455
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:38,708
Everywhere is my hometown

456
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:40,667
- But I'll stay
- Okay, Donovan.

457
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:45,500
Put your name and number
in the bin on your way out.

458
00:27:45,501 --> 00:27:47,042
Mate, I ain't done yet.

459
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:51,459
You're finished, mate.
Finito. Kaput.

460
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:04,666
- That was a bit harsh, wasn't it?
- Audience is harsher.

461
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:08,000
You can't bear anyone else be
the center of attention, mate.

462
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:10,166
Oh, yeah? What's that
supposed to mean?

463
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:14,000
Well, you're still the same,
aren't you? Hmm?

464
00:28:14,001 --> 00:28:16,625
Can't share it. It's all gotta
be about you, isn't it?

465
00:28:16,626 --> 00:28:18,834
I mean, that is why you
split up the band.

466
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:23,291
I split up the band
because my dad died.

467
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:26,250
I was on me own, and all you
cared about was going on tour.

468
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:29,584
No card, no acknowledgement,
no nothing.

469
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,250
That's not why you
split up the band.

470
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:34,000
Yes, it is.

471
00:28:34,001 --> 00:28:37,208
Wait a minute. You weren't
that close to your dad.

472
00:28:37,209 --> 00:28:39,833
No, you weren't.

473
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:42,000
He was my dad.

474
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:45,001
You lot did my fucking head in.

475
00:28:50,084 --> 00:28:52,583
I upset him a lot.

476
00:28:52,584 --> 00:28:55,542
Yeah, either you or the last fella.

477
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:09,751
Sat down like chewing gum
on the bottom of your feet

478
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:14,916
You're holding me down,
you're so sticky and so sweet

479
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:19,458
I don't know why you
think you're in control

480
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:21,125
- Come off it!
- Hey, what...

481
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,625
You on the streets, or what, mate?
What's wrong with you?

482
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:25,708
- Simon!
- I don't know why you think

483
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:28,625
- Hi, Robbie. You all right?
- No, I'm not, mate.

484
00:29:28,626 --> 00:29:31,000
Who's Simon?
This is Simon. Hello, Simon.

485
00:29:31,001 --> 00:29:34,459
- Time for you to go, I think.
- What?

486
00:29:35,001 --> 00:29:37,041
Time to move on.

487
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,541
All right. I'm going,
I'm going. I'll move.

488
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:42,375
Thank you very much, little man.
All right. I'm going.

489
00:29:42,376 --> 00:29:44,791
- Take the case with you.
- Yeah.

490
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:46,834
Okay -

491
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,584
You can do better than
that, mate! Come on!

492
00:29:59,126 --> 00:30:03,167
Come back here! Come on!

493
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:19,541
Oh, brilliant. Here. You
need to hold that for me.

494
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:21,376
Okay -

495
00:30:33,001 --> 00:30:34,916
- Hi, girls. How we doing?
- All right.

496
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,626
- Yeah, good?
- All right.

497
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:41,000
You again.

498
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:43,333
- Oh, you are just a dirty pervert...
- Come on. You're gonna have to leave.

499
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:45,000
- ...looking up a girl's skirt.
- Time to go.

500
00:30:45,001 --> 00:30:48,584
- Don't take him, please!
- Come on. It's time to go.

501
00:30:50,334 --> 00:30:53,000
What have you gone and did?
I've told him before!

502
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:55,041
Calm down, calm down.

503
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:57,250
Are you gonna take him away?
Do you know this man?

504
00:30:57,251 --> 00:30:58,750
- Yes.
- He's my...

505
00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:01,208
I'm taking him home for some
old-fashioned discipline, sir.

506
00:31:01,209 --> 00:31:03,916
Okay. I don't want to see him again.
He's here again, he gets nicked.

507
00:31:03,917 --> 00:31:07,001
- Thank you.
- Take him.

508
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:17,584
I went to see the Sex
Pistols, right? My old man...

509
00:31:22,126 --> 00:31:24,041
Oh, here we go.

510
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:26,709
Where the bloody
hell have you been?

511
00:31:27,376 --> 00:31:29,541
Found the singer.

512
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:32,750
No, no. We have found the singer.

513
00:31:32,751 --> 00:31:35,375
I have chosen this guy.

514
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:38,666
We have chosen this guy.

515
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:42,625
Well, I choose the skinny
kid in the drainpipe.

516
00:31:42,626 --> 00:31:44,416
Not the one that's
dressed like a peacock.

517
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:46,750
What? You said you didn't like him.
What you on about?

518
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:49,541
Cocky little bollocks, eh?

519
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:53,000
- Here's my man!
- I'm his man.

520
00:31:53,001 --> 00:31:56,000
He told me this...

521
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:59,126
- You said you weren't gonna speak.
- Yeah, but I...

522
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:08,125
He's turning my studio
into a bloody dosshouse.

523
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,708
Stop groaning, mate.

524
00:32:09,709 --> 00:32:11,916
I don't get it. Why we got
to move into this dump?

525
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:13,666
'Cause you've got to
look like a real band.

526
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:15,583
What's that got to do with
us shacking up together?

527
00:32:15,584 --> 00:32:19,125
For this to work, it's got to appear like
you spend every waking hour together,

528
00:32:19,126 --> 00:32:23,208
rehearse endlessly, slept on top
of one another in a tour van,

529
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:26,000
done everything else an
upstart band has done.

530
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:27,791
Just to lip-synch to some song?

531
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:30,916
You're not some ventriloquist dummy.
You're here to sell an image.

532
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:33,250
When the press talk to you, you've
got to know what it was like,

533
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:36,750
who your influences were, who came
up with the name of the band,

534
00:32:36,751 --> 00:32:38,583
why, you first gig.

535
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:40,625
Who was shagging whose girlfriend.

536
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:43,333
What beer your band mates
drink, what clothes you wear,

537
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:44,875
who and what drives you mad.

538
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:48,375
You've to to eat, sleep,
fart together as a unit.

539
00:32:48,376 --> 00:32:50,000
Girls don't break wind, Johnny.

540
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,625
I thought we were joining
a band, not the army.

541
00:32:52,626 --> 00:32:54,541
How much are we getting
paid for this?

542
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:58,583
You pull this off, trust me,
you'll be raking in thousands.

543
00:32:58,584 --> 00:33:00,583
Yeah, but what's our percentage?

544
00:33:00,584 --> 00:33:02,333
- I want a contract.
- Yeah. Same here.

545
00:33:02,334 --> 00:33:04,625
Yeah, and I want a solicitor to
look over my contract, please.

546
00:33:04,626 --> 00:33:06,000
And me.

547
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:09,000
You're not here 'cause of your talent,
so don't get any bright ideas.

548
00:33:09,001 --> 00:33:13,459
You look good. That's all.
Now pick up your instruments.

549
00:33:15,209 --> 00:33:18,292
They ain't cheap ones,
so be careful.

550
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:30,750
I'll tell you who looks
the best. The weasel.

551
00:33:30,751 --> 00:33:33,041
It's a ferret.

552
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:36,708
You were supposed to sort this out.
They can't even hold the ruddy things.

553
00:33:36,709 --> 00:33:38,583
Yeah, well...

554
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:40,667
Do the pose.

555
00:33:42,751 --> 00:33:45,126
One, two, three.

556
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:49,792
At least she can count.

557
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:54,166
All right. They can stay.

558
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:57,291
But we better get them looking
like they know what they're doing,

559
00:33:57,292 --> 00:34:00,208
or we're up the proverbial creek...

560
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:02,625
without a ladder.

561
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:05,084
Or a platform shoe.

562
00:34:14,459 --> 00:34:17,000
- That's an A. Remember that?
- Yeah.

563
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:20,166
And then the reverse
pyramid triangle.

564
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:22,125
- That way?
- No, no. The other way around.

565
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,125
What are we gonna do about
his trousers, Johnny?

566
00:34:24,126 --> 00:34:27,000
How baggy they are.
They should fit.

567
00:34:27,001 --> 00:34:30,333
Well, we could sort of turn them
up a little bit at the bottom.

568
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:32,583
Shut up!

569
00:34:32,584 --> 00:34:36,167
He's got to practice,
otherwise he'll never learn.

570
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,750
Griff, get him on guitar.

571
00:34:39,751 --> 00:34:41,626
Give it a rest, Zed!

572
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:49,333
- What are we gonna do with his hair?
- I don't know. I think it looks all right.

573
00:34:49,334 --> 00:34:52,416
- Just make sure it don't look like yours.
- Charming.

574
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:56,500
What is the deal with
these school uniforms?

575
00:34:56,501 --> 00:34:58,750
We're not an AC/DC cover band,
are we?

576
00:34:58,751 --> 00:35:00,916
It's got to appear like
you're old schoolmates.

577
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:04,001
- How are we gonna do that?
- Technology.

578
00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:09,000
You come to the front.

579
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:10,625
Come here.

580
00:35:10,626 --> 00:35:14,000
Now come in closer.

581
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:17,750
Turn the other way. On three,
turn around and look at me.

582
00:35:17,751 --> 00:35:21,084
One, two, three, look at me.

583
00:35:35,626 --> 00:35:38,791
Can you make them
look a bit younger?

584
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:40,916
Add some acne.

585
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:43,167
Acne coming up.

586
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:48,083
Pizza?

587
00:35:48,084 --> 00:35:52,333
- Here.
- Mine's a pepperoni.

588
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:54,291
How's the review coming on?

589
00:35:54,292 --> 00:35:56,916
Yeah, yeah.

590
00:35:56,917 --> 00:35:59,666
"With a flash and blur of
stripped-down excitement,

591
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:02,000
the Single Shots' gig at
Madison Square Gardens

592
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:04,000
laid waste to everything
in its path."

593
00:36:04,001 --> 00:36:07,083
No, no. You wouldn't have done your
first gig at Madison Square Garden.

594
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:11,166
Change the venue to something
like Real Pavilion, yeah?

595
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:14,166
- Right.
- Look. Your hair is much better.

596
00:36:14,167 --> 00:36:16,959
- Off the hair, Johnny.
- No. Look. Up there.

597
00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:36,083
We've got to dip them in tea to
age them, and then there we go.

598
00:36:36,084 --> 00:36:38,666
- That's wild.
- Yeah. I know, right?

599
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:41,708
I used to sell fake ticket stubs
outside the Cavern in Liverpool.

600
00:36:41,709 --> 00:36:44,833
Worked the street up.
Worked the street down.

601
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:47,125
That was Rock Sound
magazine on the phone.

602
00:36:47,126 --> 00:36:49,833
I've also had a call from MTV.

603
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:52,333
I don't want to scare you,
but the heat is on.

604
00:36:52,334 --> 00:36:56,083
If I were you, I'd take your rubber
gloves off and start practicing.

605
00:36:56,084 --> 00:36:58,458
Destroy the system, smash it all up

606
00:36:58,459 --> 00:37:00,083
Lose control

607
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:05,166
Start a revolution in
your livin' room now

608
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:08,083
- Free rock and roll
- Do what you can do

609
00:37:08,084 --> 00:37:10,833
- Free rock and roll
- 'Cause you want to

610
00:37:10,834 --> 00:37:13,416
- Free rock and roll
- Don't be afraid to

611
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:16,834
Bite the hand that
feeds you, spit it out

612
00:37:17,459 --> 00:37:20,000
Free rock and roll

613
00:37:20,001 --> 00:37:21,667
Free rock and roll

614
00:37:47,376 --> 00:37:49,666
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

615
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,500
Do you see what I see?

616
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:56,751
I'd say that that is
our first album cover.

617
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:02,916
Get that next one.

618
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:05,208
Yeah. Get one of those.

619
00:38:05,209 --> 00:38:07,625
- What's going on here?
- Oh...

620
00:38:07,626 --> 00:38:10,916
- Come down now.
- Yeah, come down. Come down.

621
00:38:10,917 --> 00:38:14,000
He's up ladders, he's down drainpipes.
I don't know what to do with the boy.

622
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:16,541
- You told me you'd sort him out.
- Run!

623
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:19,833
I'm very sorry. Simon
says catch a ladder!

624
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:22,126
- Watch it! Look here!
- Hurry!

625
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:28,167
I think we're ready to
open the floodgates.

626
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:31,708
So, just stick to what we rehearsed

627
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:35,876
and let the show begin.

628
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:43,250
Hello. Are you Penny from
Rock Sound magazine?

629
00:38:43,251 --> 00:38:45,041
- Yeah.
- I'm Johnny Jones. All right.

630
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:47,750
- Thanks for coming.
- Thank the BBC.

631
00:38:47,751 --> 00:38:50,125
If they weren't on radio,
I never would've heard of them.

632
00:38:50,126 --> 00:38:52,083
Well, they've dominated
the Welsh indie scene

633
00:38:52,084 --> 00:38:55,166
since they did their first
gig about a year ago.

634
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,791
Well, they haven't had any
press outside Wales till now.

635
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:01,833
Well, I've been very careful with them,
but the bubble's about to burst.

636
00:39:01,834 --> 00:39:06,626
They're ready to take on the world.
Hold on a minute. MTV.

637
00:39:08,584 --> 00:39:12,291
So, your self-produced demo's been
getting quite a lot of airplay lately.

638
00:39:12,292 --> 00:39:14,458
- How does that feel?
- Finally being recognized

639
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:16,666
for the musical geniuses we are.

640
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:20,251
Are these biscuits free,
or do I have to pay for...

641
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:24,333
So, who are some of
your influences?

642
00:39:24,334 --> 00:39:27,500
- Weapons of Happiness...
- Weapons of Happiness.

643
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:29,541
the Kinks, Sex Pistols,

644
00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:32,083
Johnny Thunders, lots
and lots of diff...

645
00:39:32,084 --> 00:39:34,708
- Can you let them speak?
- Yeah, Johnny. Let us speak.

646
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:37,000
- Nick Ashley.
- Aerosmith.

647
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:38,541
- Buzzcocks.
- Slipknot.

648
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,083
- Vampire Weekend.
- Duran Duran.

649
00:39:41,084 --> 00:39:44,208
Really? 'Cause you don't sound anything
like the bands you say influenced you.

650
00:39:44,209 --> 00:39:46,125
Well, Des O'Connor influenced me,

651
00:39:46,126 --> 00:39:49,166
but that don't mean I
wrote "Dick-A-Dum-Dum."

652
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:51,251
You don't write anything
anymore, do you?

653
00:39:54,001 --> 00:39:55,875
So, your press kit says that
you met in primary school.

654
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:57,416
Yeah, we're old friends.

655
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:59,791
She was the first person
to touch my Dinky-doo.

656
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:01,375
- No, I wasn't.
- Yeah, you were.

657
00:40:01,376 --> 00:40:03,209
My pet ferret, Dinky-doo.

658
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:06,916
So, whose idea was it to
actually start this band?

659
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:09,001
- Mine.
- Zed.

660
00:40:12,626 --> 00:40:14,000
Didn't know you could speak Welsh.

661
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:16,721
There's a lot of stuff you don't
know about me, Johnny boy.

662
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:20,375
- There you go.
- What are you saying?

663
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,291
- The band was a group thing.
- No, it was her idea.

664
00:40:23,292 --> 00:40:25,000
But Drainpipe put up the flyer.

665
00:40:25,001 --> 00:40:27,000
Yeah, and Zed helped
me with the designs.

666
00:40:27,001 --> 00:40:30,626
But I forgot, because I forgot.

667
00:40:34,876 --> 00:40:38,666
No, no, no! No, girls!
Not now! Not now!

668
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:41,208
I'll be having a muffin.
I'll be having a muffin.

669
00:40:41,209 --> 00:40:43,501
Leave the boys alone.

670
00:40:45,751 --> 00:40:51,209
- That happen often?
- All the time. We're used to it.

671
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:56,334
That's what I've got, all right?
Go on. Off you go.

672
00:40:56,876 --> 00:41:00,500
So, what do your parents think
about all this new-found fame?

673
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:02,125
Oh, my mom's well pleased.

674
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,626
Yeah, she's shagged enough rock
stars to appreciate what it means.

675
00:41:06,334 --> 00:41:08,125
- You what?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

676
00:41:08,126 --> 00:41:10,708
She used to be a big old
groupie back in the day.

677
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:12,875
- Shagged her way up and down the charts.
- With who?

678
00:41:12,876 --> 00:41:16,375
Like punks and new romantics
and a bit of grunge as well.

679
00:41:16,376 --> 00:41:19,500
- How does your father feel about all that?
- I don't know who he is.

680
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:21,291
- Your mum never told you?
- Oh, no.

681
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:23,833
She said it could be half the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

682
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:26,000
- She must have some idea.
- Well...

683
00:41:26,001 --> 00:41:29,666
I've been told that I look like Morrissey,
but then someone the other day said

684
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:32,458
that I've got eyes like Nick
Heyward from Haircut One Hundred.

685
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:36,333
- Who do you think it is?
- Well, let's put it this way. Come here.

686
00:41:36,334 --> 00:41:39,876
You know that rumor about David
Bowie being hung like a horse?

687
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:45,001
Well, I have got living proof
that that ain't just a rumor.

688
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:48,166
All right, then.

689
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:50,542
Write that down.

690
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:56,166
"The Single Shots are the newest,
snottiest, and best kids on the block."

691
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:58,666
"This unsigned band has a
three-minute killer pop song

692
00:41:58,667 --> 00:42:00,750
that is destined to crash punk pie,

693
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:03,500
drink all the beer, and cop
off with the cutest girls."

694
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:05,208
What?

695
00:42:05,209 --> 00:42:07,626
They are falling for it.

696
00:42:09,334 --> 00:42:12,001
Get me Johnny Jones on the phone.

697
00:42:13,876 --> 00:42:17,208
Oh, destroy the system,
smash it all up

698
00:42:17,209 --> 00:42:19,458
Lose control

699
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:22,791
He says, "We're exactly
the fresh new sound

700
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:25,000
the kiddies of today
are looking for."

701
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:27,500
- They really want to sign us?
- Sign them, you mean.

702
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:29,875
He's gonna release
the single, all right,

703
00:42:29,876 --> 00:42:32,291
with an option on two
albums and a European tour.

704
00:42:32,292 --> 00:42:33,541
That's brilliant.

705
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:35,666
How come you're the only
one going over there?

706
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:38,000
If we all turn up there, they're
gonna think something's up.

707
00:42:38,001 --> 00:42:40,500
Johnny's right. We go up here
like we got nothing to do.

708
00:42:40,501 --> 00:42:42,208
Hang on. It's just like
last time, isn't it?

709
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:45,333
He gets all the credit, right, and
we just sat there holding our dicks.

710
00:42:45,334 --> 00:42:47,083
Fine. All right.

711
00:42:47,084 --> 00:42:50,625
Next time the company calls,
I'll put it on speakerphone.

712
00:42:50,626 --> 00:42:52,041
- Right.
- Happy now?

713
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:54,541
Right. Yeah.

714
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:57,626
See, that's how
you negotiate a deal.

715
00:43:00,251 --> 00:43:03,291
I can run

716
00:43:03,292 --> 00:43:06,125
- I can
- I can

717
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:08,333
I can run faster than you

718
00:43:08,334 --> 00:43:10,166
Much faster than you

719
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:15,667
And I always could, Johnny

720
00:43:23,459 --> 00:43:25,583
Know what that is?

721
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:29,416
- Sex, drug, and rock and roll.
- What is it?

722
00:43:29,417 --> 00:43:31,458
- Viagra.
- Where'd you get that?

723
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:34,292
I got it off Robbie.

724
00:43:37,584 --> 00:43:40,416
Takes about an hour to work.

725
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:43,750
Have a look at this, babes!
I got a boner!

726
00:43:43,751 --> 00:43:46,458
Here comes Johnny!

727
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:49,083
Don't worry. You won't have
to play your instruments.

728
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,875
Remember, it's about
attitude, right?

729
00:43:51,876 --> 00:43:55,791
And sticking two fingers up at the world,
and go and bite the hand that feeds you.

730
00:43:55,792 --> 00:43:57,583
Won't that piss off the press
we're trying to impress?

731
00:43:57,584 --> 00:44:00,416
- Yeah, man.
- The press are a bunch of sadomasochists.

732
00:44:00,417 --> 00:44:02,625
They want you to spit
on them. They love it.

733
00:44:02,626 --> 00:44:04,542
It's like I was born for this.

734
00:44:19,251 --> 00:44:24,000
Journalists, hacks, dribblers,
and filth mongers, welcome.

735
00:44:24,001 --> 00:44:27,291
I am proud to introduce
to you the Single Shots,

736
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:30,708
the newest and the finest
signing to Circ Records.

737
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:34,666
The finest thing to come out of Wales
since coal, meat, and Tom fucking Jones.

738
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:38,541
- Does anybody have any questions?
- Yeah.

739
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:41,916
Is it true... Is it
true that Drainpipe

740
00:44:41,917 --> 00:44:44,416
is the illegitimate son
of David Bowie?

741
00:44:44,417 --> 00:44:47,459
Yeah, I prefer the term
"bastard," actually, so...

742
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:50,333
Are you willing to take
a DNA test to prove it?

743
00:44:50,334 --> 00:44:52,916
Well, if you can get a jizz
sample from the bloke, yeah.

744
00:44:52,917 --> 00:44:55,000
I'll give it the old tug and pull.

745
00:44:55,001 --> 00:44:57,791
- Are we gonna get a jizz sample from you?
- Huh? It depends.

746
00:44:57,792 --> 00:44:59,751
What's your daughter like?

747
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:03,166
Right. Without further ado, we'll get
to the moment you've all come in for.

748
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,875
Contract. Thank you.

749
00:45:04,876 --> 00:45:08,876
- How much is that contract worth?
- None of your business.

750
00:45:10,209 --> 00:45:12,709
Welcome to Circ Records.

751
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:27,459
We'll get you back in the bar.

752
00:45:28,001 --> 00:45:32,208
Well, how's it feel to be the
bridesmaid and not the bride?

753
00:45:32,209 --> 00:45:33,833
What's that supposed to mean?

754
00:45:33,834 --> 00:45:36,541
Well, you're like an old
racehorse that's out to pasture,

755
00:45:36,542 --> 00:45:38,750
and these kids are
running the derby.

756
00:45:38,751 --> 00:45:41,291
It's got to hurt.

757
00:45:41,292 --> 00:45:44,000
Everybody say, "Bit the hand
that feeds." One, two, three.

758
00:45:44,001 --> 00:45:46,166
Bite the hand that feeds!

759
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:48,666
Congratulations, guys. Thank you
very much. Thank you all for coming.

760
00:45:48,667 --> 00:45:52,667
- What's next?
- I'll see you at number one.

761
00:45:54,917 --> 00:45:57,458
I've got a few ideas
for the music video.

762
00:45:57,459 --> 00:45:59,666
Yeah. Yeah. Johnny,
love to hear them.

763
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:04,000
I'm onto this phenomenal, phenomenal
23-year-old music director.

764
00:46:04,001 --> 00:46:07,083
The guy's got three MTV Music Awards.
He's rocking. He's hot right now.

765
00:46:07,084 --> 00:46:10,541
He's the fish in your fish finger.
He's the custard in your truffle.

766
00:46:10,542 --> 00:46:13,583
Ah, well, Mr. Fish Finger,

767
00:46:13,584 --> 00:46:15,791
we did the Weapons
videos ourselves.

768
00:46:15,792 --> 00:46:21,625
- We wanna do this one.
- Well, Johnny, you know the business.

769
00:46:21,626 --> 00:46:24,125
My hands are tied.
This is a Circ investment.

770
00:46:24,126 --> 00:46:26,500
It goes above me.
It goes beyond me.

771
00:46:26,501 --> 00:46:29,291
Listen, Jimmy, mate, we don't do it
ourselves, we don't do it, full stop.

772
00:46:29,292 --> 00:46:32,708
That is it. That's it.

773
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:35,416
Cool. Look, that's cool.
That's perfect.

774
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,875
Congratulations, man. Fantastic.

775
00:46:37,876 --> 00:46:40,458
Great to have you on board.
It's great to have you on board.

776
00:46:40,459 --> 00:46:42,666
I mean, those Weapons
videos were...

777
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:45,501
They were certainly very
interesting back in the day.

778
00:46:46,376 --> 00:46:50,917
Cheers to you, my friend.
The best thing since sliced bread.

779
00:46:51,501 --> 00:46:54,167
You sure you're up to this?

780
00:47:00,334 --> 00:47:02,916
In. In.

781
00:47:02,917 --> 00:47:05,292
- Oh, my word.
- In, in, in.

782
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:13,375
Free rock and roll,
free rock and roll

783
00:47:13,376 --> 00:47:15,666
Free rock and roll, oh

784
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:18,583
Go for the throat, oh,
destroy the system

785
00:47:18,584 --> 00:47:21,375
Smash it all up, lose control

786
00:47:21,376 --> 00:47:25,459
Start a revolution in
your livin' room now

787
00:47:26,751 --> 00:47:29,291
- Free rock and roll
- 'Cause you can do

788
00:47:29,292 --> 00:47:32,000
- Free rock and roll
- 'Cause you want to

789
00:47:32,001 --> 00:47:34,791
- Free rock and roll
- Don't be afraid to

790
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:38,541
Bite the hand that
feeds you, spit it out

791
00:47:38,542 --> 00:47:39,791
Free rock and roll

792
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:41,291
Action!

793
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:43,334
Free rock and roll

794
00:47:44,001 --> 00:47:46,125
- Cut! Cut!
- Hey, I'm directing this.

795
00:47:46,126 --> 00:47:48,000
I don't need you to
do that all the time.

796
00:47:48,001 --> 00:47:50,541
If you're gonna bleed for a reason

797
00:47:50,542 --> 00:47:53,000
A three-minute wonder is wonderful

798
00:47:53,001 --> 00:47:57,126
- Total irritation in my ears right now
- That's good. That's good.

799
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:01,000
- Free rock and roll
- 'Cause you can do

800
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:03,625
- Free rock and roll
- 'Cause you want to

801
00:48:03,626 --> 00:48:06,500
- Free rock and roll
- Don't be afraid to

802
00:48:06,501 --> 00:48:09,209
Bite the hand that
feeds you, spit it out

803
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:12,791
All right, guys. What's happening?
You're causing obstruction.

804
00:48:12,792 --> 00:48:16,125
- Bugger off, we're filming.
- Let me see your permit then.

805
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:20,125
- I said bugger off.
- Can I be in it then?

806
00:48:20,126 --> 00:48:23,500
No, you can't be in it,
Simon the policeman.

807
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:26,375
- Right.
- What are you doing now?

808
00:48:26,376 --> 00:48:28,875
- Sign here.
- What for?

809
00:48:28,876 --> 00:48:31,834
Autograph, please.

810
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:34,375
Call the police.

811
00:48:34,376 --> 00:48:36,791
Spit it out, spit it out

812
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:39,375
Spit it out, spit it out

813
00:48:39,376 --> 00:48:42,041
Spit it out, spit it out

814
00:48:42,042 --> 00:48:44,209
Spit it out, spit it out

815
00:48:45,251 --> 00:48:47,126
Free rock and roll now

816
00:48:53,584 --> 00:48:56,250
And that's why I was sad.

817
00:48:56,251 --> 00:48:58,750
I couldn't talk to my old man.

818
00:48:58,751 --> 00:49:01,750
All right? He wanted me to work
in the post office like him,

819
00:49:01,751 --> 00:49:04,959
and all I wanted to do
was rebel against him.

820
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:07,791
What about you?
What about your old man?

821
00:49:07,792 --> 00:49:09,041
Don't know him.

822
00:49:09,042 --> 00:49:11,842
You don't seriously think David
Bowie's your old man, do you?

823
00:49:12,584 --> 00:49:15,626
- What does your mom think?
- She's moved on.

824
00:49:16,834 --> 00:49:21,209
Here. Here's a picture of
you with my mom in '92.

825
00:49:24,292 --> 00:49:26,542
Yeah.

826
00:49:30,084 --> 00:49:31,959
Yeah, she's nice.

827
00:49:34,917 --> 00:49:37,209
Just gonna get on it.

828
00:49:52,251 --> 00:49:55,459
- What's wrong?
- I've had a shock.

829
00:49:57,126 --> 00:50:00,333
Remember those gigs we did
with U2 back in the day?

830
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:04,416
At the Roxy? All those
Norwegian groupies?

831
00:50:04,417 --> 00:50:07,791
Drunken, naughty teenagers.
How could I forget?

832
00:50:07,792 --> 00:50:12,458
Well, remember that mad, jaunty bird,
wore a babydoll, striped socks?

833
00:50:12,459 --> 00:50:15,666
Made Courtney Love look
like Mother Teresa?

834
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:16,916
Yeah.

835
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:19,708
Well, I slipped her one
on the Marshall stack.

836
00:50:19,709 --> 00:50:21,791
- Nice one.
- Yeah.

837
00:50:21,792 --> 00:50:25,125
Well, a couple of months later,
she shows up at one of our gigs

838
00:50:25,126 --> 00:50:27,333
with a belly out there.

839
00:50:27,334 --> 00:50:29,541
I ask, "Is it mine?"
But she don't answer.

840
00:50:29,542 --> 00:50:33,000
She just wants to know if I can get
her a backstage pass to Glastonbury.

841
00:50:33,001 --> 00:50:35,166
So what'd you say then?

842
00:50:35,167 --> 00:50:38,541
I get her a pass and forget
about her, as you do.

843
00:50:38,542 --> 00:50:41,291
Yeah.

844
00:50:41,292 --> 00:50:44,209
She's Drainpipe's mom.

845
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:47,876
He's your son!

846
00:50:49,001 --> 00:50:51,541
My son.

847
00:50:51,542 --> 00:50:53,416
What's Jules gonna say?

848
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:56,334
Well, she ain't gonna
be too happy, is she?

849
00:50:58,001 --> 00:51:01,000
Well, one thing that
birds don't like

850
00:51:01,001 --> 00:51:04,666
is their old man's sperm
being spread about.

851
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:06,375
Ain't funny.

852
00:51:06,376 --> 00:51:10,251
He's the spit of you!

853
00:51:11,917 --> 00:51:15,791
Oh, for Christ sake,
don't say that.

854
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:19,000
And don't tell any
of the band, right?

855
00:51:19,001 --> 00:51:21,166
- Oh, that's nepotism, that is, mate.
- Yeah.

856
00:51:21,167 --> 00:51:23,375
- I'll tell you.
- My son, the lead singer.

857
00:51:23,376 --> 00:51:25,041
I won't say a word. I promise.

858
00:51:25,042 --> 00:51:27,334
Minto's gonna love that.

859
00:51:28,042 --> 00:51:30,250
- Let's get out of here.
- Don't...

860
00:51:30,251 --> 00:51:32,959
I'm choking. Don't...

861
00:51:51,334 --> 00:51:56,166
I've been searching around for
a potential dad for ages now.

862
00:51:56,167 --> 00:51:58,750
It's sort of like a little
hobby of mine I've got.

863
00:51:58,751 --> 00:52:01,625
- Is that why you joined this band?
- Yeah, of course it is.

864
00:52:01,626 --> 00:52:03,125
I don't need this.

865
00:52:03,126 --> 00:52:05,083
Unlike the rest of you,
I can actually play.

866
00:52:05,084 --> 00:52:06,791
We are practicing.
We're getting good.

867
00:52:06,792 --> 00:52:10,792
- Yeah, mate. Okay.
- Well, let's have it then.

868
00:52:11,584 --> 00:52:14,291
- Maybe the cheekbones, but not the rest.
- No?

869
00:52:14,292 --> 00:52:16,917
- No.
- Okay, right. Forget about the hair.

870
00:52:18,334 --> 00:52:20,792
- No.
- Okay.

871
00:52:24,584 --> 00:52:27,083
Johnny? Whoa. Do you really think?

872
00:52:27,084 --> 00:52:29,416
Are you gonna confront
him about it?

873
00:52:29,417 --> 00:52:31,125
Oh, yeah. And say what?

874
00:52:31,126 --> 00:52:34,542
Oh, you might've got my mom up
the duff. How about fucking her?

875
00:52:35,167 --> 00:52:37,416
Well, the nurse has just come
back with your urine sample.

876
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:39,875
- All right.
- And I'm delighted to tell you, Jules,

877
00:52:39,876 --> 00:52:41,500
the test is positive.

878
00:52:41,501 --> 00:52:45,251
- What do you mean?
- You're pregnant.

879
00:52:46,126 --> 00:52:48,708
Get lost.

880
00:52:48,709 --> 00:52:50,541
Come on. What you mean? I can't be.

881
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,666
I know it's a shock.
I can see that.

882
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:54,750
Congratulations. I'm pleased
to tell you such good news.

883
00:52:54,751 --> 00:52:56,959
What?

884
00:52:59,167 --> 00:53:01,125
Down three places at number 12,

885
00:53:01,126 --> 00:53:03,166
Green House of Terror, "Go for it."

886
00:53:03,167 --> 00:53:06,000
Up two at 11, New Mercury Sound.

887
00:53:06,001 --> 00:53:08,833
No change at number ten
for Room Service...

888
00:53:08,834 --> 00:53:10,834
Hi, sweetie.

889
00:53:11,376 --> 00:53:14,041
Up eight places at number nine...

890
00:53:14,042 --> 00:53:15,842
Will you come outside for a minute?

891
00:53:17,501 --> 00:53:19,708
Johnny, I just want to
talk to you for a minute.

892
00:53:19,709 --> 00:53:21,333
In a minute, in a
minute. Just wait.

893
00:53:21,334 --> 00:53:23,666
And bursting into the
charts at number seven,

894
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,875
"This is the Hand That
Bites," from the single

895
00:53:25,876 --> 00:53:28,166
Yeah!

896
00:53:28,167 --> 00:53:31,042
- Yes!
- I knew I could do it! Yes!

897
00:53:36,667 --> 00:53:38,126
Oh, Robbie!

898
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:44,041
Free rock and roll,
free rock and roll, oh

899
00:53:44,042 --> 00:53:46,291
Free rock and roll,
free rock and roll

900
00:53:46,292 --> 00:53:49,375
Free rock and roll, oh

901
00:53:49,376 --> 00:53:52,541
This is what it's like
to be a star again, eh?

902
00:53:52,542 --> 00:53:57,541
Back. All right, darling.

903
00:53:57,542 --> 00:54:00,041
Hey!

904
00:54:00,042 --> 00:54:02,167
Robbie!

905
00:54:03,792 --> 00:54:06,251
We did it, son.

906
00:54:10,876 --> 00:54:13,458
I went to the doctor's
today, Johnny.

907
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:17,833
I had the test done,
and it looks like...

908
00:54:17,834 --> 00:54:19,709
I've got a son.

909
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:25,459
- You've what?
- Drainpipe's my son.

910
00:54:29,209 --> 00:54:33,334
Honestly, I didn't know. I didn't
know till just the other day.

911
00:54:35,001 --> 00:54:36,876
Get out.

912
00:54:37,417 --> 00:54:39,416
- Just get out!
- There's no more...

913
00:54:39,417 --> 00:54:41,875
- You sure about that?
- There ain't no more babies!

914
00:54:41,876 --> 00:54:43,334
Get out!

915
00:55:02,709 --> 00:55:05,042
Robbie.

916
00:55:08,917 --> 00:55:11,001
Thought we should
break it now, Johnny.

917
00:55:12,626 --> 00:55:14,583
The plan is to wait,
mate, all right?

918
00:55:14,584 --> 00:55:16,500
Got something planned, hmm?

919
00:55:16,501 --> 00:55:18,166
Let's jump on it. Get our
names out there again.

920
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:21,500
We do it now, we'll kill it,
just when it's getting momentum.

921
00:55:21,501 --> 00:55:22,750
Bollocks!

922
00:55:22,751 --> 00:55:27,334
Now, once they realize it's us, well,
sales are gonna double, aren't they?

923
00:55:27,876 --> 00:55:30,083
If that was the case,
silly bollocks,

924
00:55:30,084 --> 00:55:32,041
we wouldn't have to do
all this, would we?

925
00:55:32,042 --> 00:55:34,541
You know what, Johnny? You're
gonna ruin it again, aren't you,

926
00:55:34,542 --> 00:55:36,291
just like you did the last time?

927
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:38,750
Minto, this is a band
decision. It ain't yours.

928
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:41,708
So? We do it now.

929
00:55:41,709 --> 00:55:44,167
Right? We tell them it's
Weapons of Happiness.

930
00:55:44,792 --> 00:55:47,167
I'm looking out for
me family, Johnny.

931
00:55:48,917 --> 00:55:51,209
Same as you.

932
00:55:54,001 --> 00:55:57,083
Has he not told you why he's
got such a vested interest

933
00:55:57,084 --> 00:55:59,583
in that bunch of phonies
getting all the limelight?

934
00:55:59,584 --> 00:56:01,750
What you on about?

935
00:56:01,751 --> 00:56:04,251
Drainpipe is Johnny's kid.

936
00:56:05,626 --> 00:56:08,209
You had a kid with David Bowie?

937
00:56:09,084 --> 00:56:11,458
- Thanks, Robbie.
- I never said a word.

938
00:56:11,459 --> 00:56:13,666
- Yeah, right.
- No, no, no.

939
00:56:13,667 --> 00:56:17,083
No, I was in the cubicle next
door when you told Robbie.

940
00:56:17,084 --> 00:56:20,167
Thanks very much. Do I
get an apology now?

941
00:56:20,751 --> 00:56:23,375
He might be my kid.
It ain't definite.

942
00:56:23,376 --> 00:56:25,584
He's yours.

943
00:56:26,792 --> 00:56:29,375
So, basically, you're gonna sell
us down the river, are you,

944
00:56:29,376 --> 00:56:31,000
so that your kid can
be the next big thing?

945
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:34,166
- Ain't true.
- So why keep it a secret, Johnny?

946
00:56:34,167 --> 00:56:37,625
Why don't we tell everybody
it's the Weapons of Happiness?

947
00:56:37,626 --> 00:56:40,166
You are gonna mess this up.

948
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:44,875
We don't reveal it's us till I say
it's gone as far as it's gonna go.

949
00:56:44,876 --> 00:56:47,458
You got that? We ain't
changing the plan.

950
00:56:47,459 --> 00:56:51,791
Oi, they're all ears. Keep it down.

951
00:56:51,792 --> 00:56:56,626
Got it. Don't you fuck me about.

952
00:56:59,001 --> 00:57:03,001
It's all a scam, mate. Everything...
CD3, videos, the lot.

953
00:57:04,001 --> 00:57:06,625
We're the Single Shots...
the Weapons of Happiness.

954
00:57:06,626 --> 00:57:08,500
That lot is just puppets.

955
00:57:08,501 --> 00:57:12,250
We just pull the strings, and the
others are just miming to it.

956
00:57:12,251 --> 00:57:15,959
And that kid Drainpipe...
that's not David Bowie's son.

957
00:57:17,001 --> 00:57:19,917
That's Johnny Jones' kid.

958
00:57:25,459 --> 00:57:28,000
- He did what?
- Told him everything.

959
00:57:28,001 --> 00:57:29,791
Video, the song, everything.

960
00:57:29,792 --> 00:57:33,501
Yeah, even the bit about
Drainpipe being your kid.

961
00:57:34,042 --> 00:57:36,501
Who gave you the right to do that?

962
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:42,584
Nobody I did. The truth
won out, Johnny.

963
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,625
- You're a twat, Minto.
- All right.

964
00:57:45,626 --> 00:57:49,333
That must be why Jimmy wants to
meet us down in London then, hmm?

965
00:57:49,334 --> 00:57:52,833
Why he sent a limo to pick
us up, take us down there.

966
00:57:52,834 --> 00:57:56,042
See? That's what happens when you
get me to do a bit of management.

967
00:57:57,167 --> 00:57:59,416
And you're gonna go
along with all of this?

968
00:57:59,417 --> 00:58:01,625
Well, we ain't got
much choice, have we?

969
00:58:01,626 --> 00:58:04,208
The genie's out of the bottle now.

970
00:58:04,209 --> 00:58:07,250
Not only that. Rock
Sound have asked us

971
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:11,001
to do a live gig on TV.

972
00:58:12,126 --> 00:58:14,833
Weapons of Happiness?

973
00:58:14,834 --> 00:58:19,042
No. Single Shots.

974
00:58:19,876 --> 00:58:23,167
Well, now they've got
Weapons of Happiness.

975
00:58:36,501 --> 00:58:40,333
This is the sound
of tomorrow calling

976
00:58:40,334 --> 00:58:45,001
Revolution will be starting
in your living room

977
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,042
We don't need you anymore.

978
00:59:08,667 --> 00:59:10,126
What?

979
00:59:11,126 --> 00:59:14,666
What? Just like that, out of nowhere,
you just spring that one on us, do you?

980
00:59:14,667 --> 00:59:17,791
Sorry. You'll get your
cut of royalties.

981
00:59:17,792 --> 00:59:20,416
Told you there, didn't I?
What did you expect?

982
00:59:20,417 --> 00:59:22,458
Well, I didn't expect
anything bad from him, did I?

983
00:59:22,459 --> 00:59:24,291
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I don't know, mate.

984
00:59:24,292 --> 00:59:26,584
I'm just a dancing
monkey, aren't I?

985
00:59:27,167 --> 00:59:29,166
- Is this about me and your mom?
- No, you listen.

986
00:59:29,167 --> 00:59:31,208
You keep my mom out of it.

987
00:59:31,209 --> 00:59:33,458
I don't know what you
think I did to her,

988
00:59:33,459 --> 00:59:35,791
but if you've got something to say,
just come right out and say it.

989
00:59:35,792 --> 00:59:38,833
What is the point, mate? It's all just
water under the bridge, isn't it?

990
00:59:38,834 --> 00:59:41,500
It's not as if I didn't
care about her situation.

991
00:59:41,501 --> 00:59:43,833
Yeah, but you weren't there!
You were not there

992
00:59:43,834 --> 00:59:46,625
for long enough to find out
if the baby was yours or not!

993
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:49,458
- I was in no position to be a dad, was I?
- Why? Why not?

994
00:59:49,459 --> 00:59:51,875
I was a rock star!

995
00:59:51,876 --> 00:59:54,500
I wanted to smash up
hotel rooms, didn't I?

996
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:56,833
I wanted to take drugs, get girls,

997
00:59:56,834 --> 01:00:00,501
not push around a pram
and change nappies!

998
01:00:01,542 --> 01:00:06,000
- What do you want from me?
- My dad.

999
01:00:06,001 --> 01:00:08,041
Well, I'm not!

1000
01:00:08,042 --> 01:00:11,333
I want to be no one's
dad, so go away!

1001
01:00:11,334 --> 01:00:14,416
Yeah. Fucking...

1002
01:00:14,417 --> 01:00:16,876
Fuck off, mate!

1003
01:00:18,376 --> 01:00:20,167
You wanker, Johnny!

1004
01:00:33,126 --> 01:00:35,209
Whoa!

1005
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:41,584
So, great to be back in a limo, eh?

1006
01:00:48,126 --> 01:00:50,501
You guys, eh?

1007
01:00:52,376 --> 01:00:55,792
Congratulations for pulling off
such a rock and roll swindle.

1008
01:00:56,626 --> 01:01:00,376
- You had us all fooled.
- Well, not just you, was it, Jimmy?

1009
01:01:00,917 --> 01:01:03,083
Everybody in showbiz.

1010
01:01:03,084 --> 01:01:06,251
Everyone, wasn't it?
It was everyone.

1011
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:10,251
Which is why we won't be
making the information public.

1012
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:15,291
You won't be making the information
public until it goes to number one?

1013
01:01:15,292 --> 01:01:19,792
Oh, no. We won't be making
the information public ever.

1014
01:01:21,251 --> 01:01:23,458
Hang on a minute. What
about Rock Sound TV?

1015
01:01:23,459 --> 01:01:27,041
We booked a place live.
Kids can't play.

1016
01:01:27,042 --> 01:01:29,833
Oh, no, no. The kids will go ahead
performing their hit single,

1017
01:01:29,834 --> 01:01:32,875
as they were planned to
do, and just mime to it.

1018
01:01:32,876 --> 01:01:36,333
Whoa. No, no. You can't
do that. It's our song.

1019
01:01:36,334 --> 01:01:39,792
Well, technically, it's not.

1020
01:01:40,334 --> 01:01:45,083
As you'll see from the
paragraph 5C of the contract

1021
01:01:45,084 --> 01:01:48,125
signed and agreed to
by Mr. Johnny Jones,

1022
01:01:48,126 --> 01:01:51,875
the music delivered to
Circ Music Publishing

1023
01:01:51,876 --> 01:01:54,500
was the product of Dave Peacock

1024
01:01:54,501 --> 01:01:56,791
and Johnny Sprot,

1025
01:01:56,792 --> 01:01:59,750
aka Fly and Zed,

1026
01:01:59,751 --> 01:02:03,750
Flora Griffin and Joel
"Drainpipe" Richards.

1027
01:02:03,751 --> 01:02:05,833
- It says all that?
- Furthermore,

1028
01:02:05,834 --> 01:02:08,291
'm paragraph 7 A,

1029
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:10,666
and public disavowal
of said authorship

1030
01:02:10,667 --> 01:02:12,541
will be considered
evidence of fraud

1031
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:15,333
and compensatory action
will commence immediately.

1032
01:02:15,334 --> 01:02:17,916
- What's that mean?
- It means

1033
01:02:17,917 --> 01:02:21,041
that if any of your were to
make this information public,

1034
01:02:21,042 --> 01:02:23,458
we'd sue for fraud.

1035
01:02:23,459 --> 01:02:26,208
We'd seize every penny in your bank
account, your cars, your houses,

1036
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:31,209
and, Johnny, the shoes
off your very feet.

1037
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:36,501
We got rid of the kids.

1038
01:02:37,792 --> 01:02:39,334
Oh, dear.

1039
01:02:44,001 --> 01:02:46,666
Well, you better get them back...

1040
01:02:46,667 --> 01:02:49,209
Pretty quick.

1041
01:02:50,126 --> 01:02:53,666
Well, thank you for
coming in, gentlemen.

1042
01:02:53,667 --> 01:02:55,916
And thank you, Mr. Bourne, for
bringing it to my attention.

1043
01:02:55,917 --> 01:02:57,541
My assistant will see you out.

1044
01:02:57,542 --> 01:03:00,083
I'll keep hold of a couple
of these, if you don't mind.

1045
01:03:00,084 --> 01:03:04,959
I've got very good lawyers as well,
who you'll all be hearing from.

1046
01:03:07,167 --> 01:03:09,000
Is there anything else, Mr. Bourne?

1047
01:03:09,001 --> 01:03:11,459
What do you think?

1048
01:03:13,001 --> 01:03:14,291
I'm getting on the train.

1049
01:03:14,292 --> 01:03:16,125
Robbie, lend us a couple
pounds to get on, mate.

1050
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:19,750
- Yeah, me too. I'm skinned.
- Piss off. Make your own way home.

1051
01:03:19,751 --> 01:03:21,500
- This is all your doing, this is.
- My doing?

1052
01:03:21,501 --> 01:03:23,416
Yeah. You knew this
was gonna happen.

1053
01:03:23,417 --> 01:03:27,000
How'd we end up with all the rubbish
while your kid gets all the glory?

1054
01:03:27,001 --> 01:03:29,291
I ain't got a kid. And if he
is mine, I don't want him.

1055
01:03:29,292 --> 01:03:31,500
It was your big mouth
that ruined everything.

1056
01:03:31,501 --> 01:03:33,125
Yeah. I wanted to be honest.

1057
01:03:33,126 --> 01:03:35,250
Oh, yeah. You just wanted
to make a quick buck.

1058
01:03:35,251 --> 01:03:37,750
Which we would've done if
we hadn't have listened

1059
01:03:37,751 --> 01:03:39,708
to all your virtual band bollocks.

1060
01:03:39,709 --> 01:03:42,375
It was a great plan, and
it worked perfectly.

1061
01:03:42,376 --> 01:03:45,333
Oh, yeah, it was perfect
if you mean giving away

1062
01:03:45,334 --> 01:03:49,041
all our hard work for nothing
perfect, just like last time, mate.

1063
01:03:49,042 --> 01:03:53,000
- Oh? What's that supposed to mean?
- Your great big ego, Johnny!

1064
01:03:53,001 --> 01:03:56,750
I mean, why didn't you give me and Griff
one track? Just one track on the album?

1065
01:03:56,751 --> 01:03:58,583
- Didn't write any!
- We did.

1066
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:00,208
- They weren't good enough!
- Who says?

1067
01:04:00,209 --> 01:04:02,666
I said! Fans said! Minto
said he sung at Wembley!

1068
01:04:02,667 --> 01:04:04,000
- What a load of crap!
- Listen!

1069
01:04:04,001 --> 01:04:06,875
Listen. The only reason you
split up the band, right,

1070
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:09,166
is because you thought
you'd make more money

1071
01:04:09,167 --> 01:04:10,458
if you had a solo career,

1072
01:04:10,459 --> 01:04:12,208
and the truth of the
matter is, Johnny,

1073
01:04:12,209 --> 01:04:15,208
it was a bag of shite.

1074
01:04:15,209 --> 01:04:17,292
Minto, fuck you!

1075
01:04:22,042 --> 01:04:23,959
I know you son of a...!

1076
01:04:26,751 --> 01:04:28,751
You always were like that!

1077
01:04:30,084 --> 01:04:33,166
I don't know why I should
have to deal with you lot!

1078
01:04:33,167 --> 01:04:35,708
The record company know everything,

1079
01:04:35,709 --> 01:04:38,500
and I'm the only
legitimate manager!

1080
01:04:38,501 --> 01:04:41,750
I don't even have to bother
with you ever again!

1081
01:04:41,751 --> 01:04:45,001
I never did! Piss off!

1082
01:04:49,584 --> 01:04:51,709
Hey!

1083
01:05:01,126 --> 01:05:05,166
Jules, love, all rock
stars poke groupies.

1084
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:09,000
If you don't know
that, God help you.

1085
01:05:09,001 --> 01:05:11,500
- It's just...
- Find out where the woman lives

1086
01:05:11,501 --> 01:05:14,167
and go and talk to her.

1087
01:05:27,334 --> 01:05:30,042
- Tell him I'm coming with you.
- No, you ain't, mate.

1088
01:05:31,667 --> 01:05:34,041
Listen, there ain't no room for
you in our posh hotel in London

1089
01:05:34,042 --> 01:05:36,875
that they're paying for while
we do The Rock Sound Show.

1090
01:05:36,876 --> 01:05:38,916
Listen to me. I'm the manager.

1091
01:05:38,917 --> 01:05:41,125
I make the decisions.

1092
01:05:41,126 --> 01:05:43,333
You have to cancel. It's live.

1093
01:05:43,334 --> 01:05:44,666
You can't play.

1094
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:47,000
It's three chords, Johnny,
not brain surgery.

1095
01:05:47,001 --> 01:05:48,291
We've been practicing.

1096
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:50,416
We've got five songs out
of these three chords.

1097
01:05:50,417 --> 01:05:52,041
Yeah, Jimmy agrees with us.

1098
01:05:52,042 --> 01:05:56,333
We make our own decisions
until your contract runs out.

1099
01:05:56,334 --> 01:05:57,791
This ain't fair. You can't do this.

1100
01:05:57,792 --> 01:05:59,791
We're rock musicians, man.

1101
01:05:59,792 --> 01:06:03,334
We just want to trash hotel rooms
and bite the hand that feeds.

1102
01:06:10,709 --> 01:06:12,500
Here on Rock Sound TV,

1103
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:13,791
this week in the studio:

1104
01:06:13,792 --> 01:06:18,208
popular new Welsh band
The Single Shots.

1105
01:06:18,209 --> 01:06:21,125
- All wankers.
- What do you think?

1106
01:06:21,126 --> 01:06:23,583
These guys are destined
for great big things.

1107
01:06:23,584 --> 01:06:27,833
And that lead singer's
a bit of a hottie.

1108
01:06:27,834 --> 01:06:31,416
Well, there you have it.
We predicted a hit.

1109
01:06:31,417 --> 01:06:34,375
Thanks Riley. Thanks, Carol.
Stuff of legends.

1110
01:06:34,376 --> 01:06:38,083
Creating a fan base as devoted
as any religious cult.

1111
01:06:38,084 --> 01:06:39,375
It's just so...

1112
01:06:39,376 --> 01:06:41,458
It was amazing the way in media

1113
01:06:41,459 --> 01:06:43,834
with a spine-tingling after growth.

1114
01:06:47,001 --> 01:06:48,250
Tonight, in a special session,

1115
01:06:48,251 --> 01:06:50,125
we meet the band,
but most exciting,

1116
01:06:50,126 --> 01:06:53,126
is they'll be performing
especially for you.

1117
01:07:14,084 --> 01:07:15,625
That's the truth.

1118
01:07:15,626 --> 01:07:18,083
I don't know if
Johnny is his father.

1119
01:07:18,084 --> 01:07:19,333
Oh, God.

1120
01:07:19,334 --> 01:07:22,166
Oh, no, listen. Listen.
Do you know what?

1121
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:24,583
There were so many of them,

1122
01:07:24,584 --> 01:07:26,333
I don't even remember.

1123
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:29,041
I just know he had that
ridiculous spiky hair,

1124
01:07:29,042 --> 01:07:30,791
and there was this...

1125
01:07:30,792 --> 01:07:34,125
I don't know. Honestly, no memory.

1126
01:07:34,126 --> 01:07:38,291
- Oh, God.
- Look. I've got cheese.

1127
01:07:38,292 --> 01:07:41,000
Have some cheese.

1128
01:07:41,001 --> 01:07:43,166
And there's som...
mate, look at this.

1129
01:07:43,167 --> 01:07:45,541
Cranberries in it.
Absolutely delicious.

1130
01:07:45,542 --> 01:07:47,416
And this one...

1131
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:49,126
Do you want some?

1132
01:07:50,209 --> 01:07:51,791
It's all right. I think
I'm going to be sick.

1133
01:07:51,792 --> 01:07:53,333
Oh, Jeez.

1134
01:07:53,334 --> 01:07:54,666
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1135
01:07:54,667 --> 01:07:56,709
I'm sorry.

1136
01:07:58,334 --> 01:08:00,000
Oh, deer.

1137
01:08:00,001 --> 01:08:01,291
- John.
- Yes?

1138
01:08:01,292 --> 01:08:02,666
Can you bring up a cup of tea

1139
01:08:02,667 --> 01:08:05,708
- and a big pretzel with mustard on it?
- Yep, will do.

1140
01:08:05,709 --> 01:08:09,000
How can I bring another
child into the world?

1141
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:13,416
My life is a total mess as it is
without this dragging me down.

1142
01:08:13,417 --> 01:08:16,375
Look. It's a baby.
It's not a jail sentence.

1143
01:08:16,376 --> 01:08:18,208
And less work than Minto

1144
01:08:18,209 --> 01:08:20,583
or even Griff when
he was on the sauce.

1145
01:08:20,584 --> 01:08:22,709
Same amount of shit
and puke, though.

1146
01:08:39,584 --> 01:08:40,833
Girls.

1147
01:08:40,834 --> 01:08:44,416
- Johnny, I thought you were rehearsing.
- I'm so sorry. I need to say something.

1148
01:08:44,417 --> 01:08:49,167
Wait. I'm totally chaffed
that you're pregnant.

1149
01:08:51,501 --> 01:08:56,625
That's wonderful, Johnny, but you
might want to include Trixie in this.

1150
01:08:56,626 --> 01:08:59,251
- You've met before.
- Hey, sweetie.

1151
01:09:00,251 --> 01:09:04,333
What are you wearing?
You look like me dad.

1152
01:09:04,334 --> 01:09:07,166
I just thought it might be an
idea for us women to get together

1153
01:09:07,167 --> 01:09:09,375
to discuss family matters.

1154
01:09:09,376 --> 01:09:12,083
I tell you what.
You've done really well.

1155
01:09:12,084 --> 01:09:14,083
What a lovely bird she is.

1156
01:09:14,084 --> 01:09:16,000
Oh, babe.

1157
01:09:16,001 --> 01:09:18,791
I think we've said everything we
need to say, really. Haven't we?

1158
01:09:18,792 --> 01:09:22,251
Is there anything you want
to add to the conversation?

1159
01:09:27,084 --> 01:09:30,791
I'm willing to accept that
I am Drainpipe's father.

1160
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:32,666
Well, thanks for that, Johnny,

1161
01:09:32,667 --> 01:09:36,333
but I don't think me husband or
me two kids would like that.

1162
01:09:36,334 --> 01:09:40,416
Think you'd drag us down.

1163
01:09:40,417 --> 01:09:42,416
Listen. You got me number.
Haven't you?

1164
01:09:42,417 --> 01:09:43,916
- I have, yeah.
- All right, darling.

1165
01:09:43,917 --> 01:09:45,375
Come on. I'll see you out.

1166
01:09:45,376 --> 01:09:47,126
- Cheerio.
- Bye, Johnny.

1167
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:50,626
See you, darling.

1168
01:09:57,209 --> 01:10:00,250
So what are you going
to do about all this?

1169
01:10:00,251 --> 01:10:05,708
I want you, me, the
baby to be a family.

1170
01:10:05,709 --> 01:10:07,750
I've got myself a proper job.

1171
01:10:07,751 --> 01:10:10,833
I want our baby to grow up
in a nice place with...

1172
01:10:10,834 --> 01:10:13,041
I wasn't talking about that.
I'm talking about the band.

1173
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:16,000
I'm talking about the Weapons
of Happiness and the single.

1174
01:10:16,001 --> 01:10:17,791
Are you going to blow your
cover to the public or not?

1175
01:10:17,792 --> 01:10:19,375
They'd take us for
everything we've got.

1176
01:10:19,376 --> 01:10:21,416
We haven't got anything, Johnny.
We spent it.

1177
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:26,333
I've got one foot in the
nursing home game now, right?

1178
01:10:26,334 --> 01:10:29,500
I'm going to work for Robbie.

1179
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:31,166
What's happened to you?

1180
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:33,583
What happened kid who used to just stick
to your fingers about everything.

1181
01:10:33,584 --> 01:10:35,833
I've got three mouths to feed now.

1182
01:10:35,834 --> 01:10:39,292
If you turn into a bore, I'll get you
out of it because we'll leave you.

1183
01:10:41,626 --> 01:10:44,000
I want you to be part
of a band again.

1184
01:10:44,001 --> 01:10:46,750
About this responsible
father business.

1185
01:10:46,751 --> 01:10:51,708
Listen, you've done your responsible
bit by getting me up the duff.

1186
01:10:51,709 --> 01:10:56,583
Honestly, working in a care home.
The poor patients.

1187
01:10:56,584 --> 01:10:59,250
You go back to what
you're good at, yeah?

1188
01:10:59,251 --> 01:11:01,500
That's your music.

1189
01:11:01,501 --> 01:11:05,041
You just get this ridiculous suit off.
You look like a politician.

1190
01:11:05,042 --> 01:11:07,708
Pile of shit, ey? 45 quid.

1191
01:11:07,709 --> 01:11:09,626
- You rat.
- Okay.

1192
01:11:10,251 --> 01:11:11,917
I got it.

1193
01:11:13,459 --> 01:11:16,250
It's not too late. The show's
not on for six more hours.

1194
01:11:16,251 --> 01:11:19,375
We go to London, break in the
studio, hijack the show.

1195
01:11:19,376 --> 01:11:24,291
- What, on live television?
- Yeah, a double rock and roll swindle.

1196
01:11:24,292 --> 01:11:26,833
We play the song ourselves,
take back what's ours.

1197
01:11:26,834 --> 01:11:29,375
Well, Circ will sue us for
everything we've got if we do that.

1198
01:11:29,376 --> 01:11:32,000
They're as guilty as we are.
They ain't got a leg to stand on.

1199
01:11:32,001 --> 01:11:35,208
I worked hard to rebuild my
life after the band split up.

1200
01:11:35,209 --> 01:11:37,583
Yeah, I know you did, mate.
I know you did.

1201
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:39,916
But we going to let some
poxy record company

1202
01:11:39,917 --> 01:11:42,041
dictate to us, push us about?

1203
01:11:42,042 --> 01:11:43,750
I say we go and smash it.

1204
01:11:43,751 --> 01:11:45,458
Never mind bite the
hand that feeds.

1205
01:11:45,459 --> 01:11:48,000
We go and bite their
fucking heads off.

1206
01:11:48,001 --> 01:11:50,541
I hate the nursing home business.

1207
01:11:50,542 --> 01:11:53,208
It reminds me of bald cabbage.

1208
01:11:53,209 --> 01:11:55,333
- Come on. We'll take my car.
- Brilliant, mate.

1209
01:11:55,334 --> 01:11:57,500
- Who will pay the petrol?
- A bit skinned.

1210
01:11:57,501 --> 01:11:59,500
I think I can cover it.

1211
01:11:59,501 --> 01:12:01,251
Minto.

1212
01:12:03,292 --> 01:12:05,792
- Let's do it.
- You know it.

1213
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:14,001
- What are you doing?
- I've lived here for 20 years.

1214
01:12:21,876 --> 01:12:23,916
It's the Single Shots.

1215
01:12:23,917 --> 01:12:26,876
How's it going? Free rock and roll.

1216
01:12:36,292 --> 01:12:39,542
No, no, no, don't stop here.
They'll see us on security.

1217
01:12:51,501 --> 01:12:53,291
All right.

1218
01:12:53,292 --> 01:12:56,166
All right, lads. Johnny Jones.
Weapons of Happiness.

1219
01:12:56,167 --> 01:12:57,416
Sorry, it's off limits.

1220
01:12:57,417 --> 01:12:59,291
- We're famous.
- Take it up with the bookers.

1221
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:01,875
We've been on the charts loads
of times. First back in '79.

1222
01:13:01,876 --> 01:13:05,083
- I was born in 1987.
- Fucking squirt.

1223
01:13:05,084 --> 01:13:08,376
Single Shots coming up.

1224
01:13:10,417 --> 01:13:12,542
Listen. I've got an idea.

1225
01:13:16,667 --> 01:13:19,833
That was your plan, ey?
Kick him in the goolies?

1226
01:13:19,834 --> 01:13:21,584
Well, it worked. Didn't it?

1227
01:13:26,834 --> 01:13:28,751
Hey!

1228
01:13:30,751 --> 01:13:32,041
Split up!

1229
01:13:32,042 --> 01:13:34,083
Security, Contact the
gate immediately.

1230
01:13:34,084 --> 01:13:35,333
Repeat, immediately.

1231
01:13:35,334 --> 01:13:37,000
This is a security alert.

1232
01:13:37,001 --> 01:13:39,541
Please be on the lookout
for four middle-aged men.

1233
01:13:39,542 --> 01:13:41,541
I repeat. Four middle-aged men.

1234
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:44,834
Split up means go
different directions.

1235
01:13:48,917 --> 01:13:50,666
Security breach...
be on the lookout

1236
01:13:50,667 --> 01:13:52,375
for four out-of-shape
middle-aged blokes.

1237
01:13:52,376 --> 01:13:55,376
Middle aged? I'm not middle aged.

1238
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:01,459
Bollocks.

1239
01:14:10,626 --> 01:14:12,500
I got one of these old geezers.

1240
01:14:12,501 --> 01:14:15,209
I'm not a fucking
old geezer. All right?

1241
01:14:16,334 --> 01:14:19,541
Fuck. Oh, there's no
need to be spiteful.

1242
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:24,250
Really? Because I always prefer the
sort of hairspray-and-mousse combo.

1243
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:27,001
Shit!

1244
01:14:33,834 --> 01:14:35,208
Drainpipe, StoP!

1245
01:14:35,209 --> 01:14:36,458
Drainpipe!

1246
01:14:36,459 --> 01:14:38,917
Drainpipe, “dd UP!

1247
01:14:42,542 --> 01:14:44,750
Johnny! Johnny!

1248
01:14:44,751 --> 01:14:47,125
Three, two, one...

1249
01:14:47,126 --> 01:14:49,125
And this is the band we've
all been waiting for.

1250
01:14:49,126 --> 01:14:52,167
It's The Single Shots with
"Free Rock And Roll."

1251
01:14:57,709 --> 01:14:59,667
One, two, three, four!

1252
01:15:09,876 --> 01:15:12,250
Free rock and roll,
free rock and roll

1253
01:15:12,251 --> 01:15:14,916
Free rock and roll, oh

1254
01:15:14,917 --> 01:15:17,750
Free rock and roll,
free rock and roll

1255
01:15:17,751 --> 01:15:20,666
Free rock and roll, oh

1256
01:15:20,667 --> 01:15:23,000
Go for the throat, oh,
destroy the system

1257
01:15:23,001 --> 01:15:25,416
Smash it all up, lose control

1258
01:15:25,417 --> 01:15:29,583
Start a revolution in
your livin' room now

1259
01:15:29,584 --> 01:15:35,126
Justice! It's Johnny Jones!

1260
01:15:39,876 --> 01:15:41,376
Fuck it.

1261
01:15:45,334 --> 01:15:47,458
That's my song, mate.

1262
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:51,625
The Single Shots...

1263
01:15:51,626 --> 01:15:52,916
Stop. Hey, stop.

1264
01:15:52,917 --> 01:15:54,166
Stop. Stop, mates.

1265
01:15:54,167 --> 01:15:57,375
- I said cut to the fucking advert!
- Stay live!

1266
01:15:57,376 --> 01:16:00,416
Whoa, mate.

1267
01:16:00,417 --> 01:16:01,833
Sorry, ladies and
gentlemen, but we've got...

1268
01:16:01,834 --> 01:16:03,791
There's no reason for us to
play this here. You know?

1269
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:06,833
- Shut him up!
- This is... This isn't our music.

1270
01:16:06,834 --> 01:16:09,500
This isn't our words.
We're just miming.

1271
01:16:09,501 --> 01:16:11,666
Johnny Jones is the
legend behind this song.

1272
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:13,541
- Shut him up!
- This is all just an image.

1273
01:16:13,542 --> 01:16:15,916
Because this record label
don't have imagination.

1274
01:16:15,917 --> 01:16:18,875
It's like a bar of soap,
just priced and packaged.

1275
01:16:18,876 --> 01:16:20,500
All this stuff is pretty funny, eh?

1276
01:16:20,501 --> 01:16:22,250
You just take it. You
don't ask any questions.

1277
01:16:22,251 --> 01:16:25,208
You don't care about the truth.
And that ain't punk spirit.

1278
01:16:25,209 --> 01:16:26,458
Shut him up!

1279
01:16:26,459 --> 01:16:28,416
Johnny Jones taught us
what punk spirit is.

1280
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:31,125
Cut! Cut to something else!

1281
01:16:31,126 --> 01:16:34,083
- It's my song!
- This one's for you, Johnny.

1282
01:16:34,084 --> 01:16:39,416
Sat down like chewing gum
on the bottom of your feet

1283
01:16:39,417 --> 01:16:44,041
You're holding me down,
you're so sticky and so sweet

1284
01:16:44,042 --> 01:16:46,000
I don't know why you
think you're in control

1285
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:47,876
You're all right, babe.

1286
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:54,166
As everyone knows, if
I could just go home

1287
01:16:54,167 --> 01:16:58,541
Nothing goes the same

1288
01:16:58,542 --> 01:17:02,833
So why don't you go on
back to your hide y ho

1289
01:17:02,834 --> 01:17:05,333
Oh, oh, oh, oh

1290
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:06,791
Go on back today

1291
01:17:06,792 --> 01:17:08,833
Yeah!

1292
01:17:08,834 --> 01:17:13,875
Treat me like a plastic
tube, whoa, oh, oh, oh

1293
01:17:13,876 --> 01:17:16,708
- Calm yourself down.
- This is the sound of!

1294
01:17:16,709 --> 01:17:20,000
The sound of tomorrow
that's calling!

1295
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:23,126
The sound of tomorrow
that's calling!

1296
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,625
Thank you. Thank you.

1297
01:17:53,626 --> 01:17:56,041
Hey, could happen.

1298
01:17:56,042 --> 01:17:58,001
What's up?

1299
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:02,834
Cheers, mate.

1300
01:18:04,459 --> 01:18:06,416
How are they?

1301
01:18:06,417 --> 01:18:08,250
Yeah, yeah. All right, yeah.

1302
01:18:08,251 --> 01:18:11,000
Good for now. Half old, half new.

1303
01:18:11,001 --> 01:18:14,083
None shaggable, but that
ain't your concern. Is it?

1304
01:18:14,084 --> 01:18:16,291
- No.
- No.

1305
01:18:16,292 --> 01:18:19,000
You know, like me, you,
and your mum, all that.

1306
01:18:19,001 --> 01:18:21,500
Oh, no, no, no, don't worry.
Don't worry, you know.

1307
01:18:21,501 --> 01:18:24,583
I knew you weren't in any
position to be a dad.

1308
01:18:24,584 --> 01:18:31,583
Listen. If I was your dad...
If I am... If I am really your dad,

1309
01:18:31,584 --> 01:18:33,083
well, what I got to say is,

1310
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:38,291
I couldn't be prouder of
you for what you did.

1311
01:18:38,292 --> 01:18:44,750
It was the most sort of irresponsible but
tremendous right thing I've ever seen.

1312
01:18:44,751 --> 01:18:47,667
So, you know.

1313
01:18:52,876 --> 01:18:54,333
Well, look.

1314
01:18:54,334 --> 01:18:57,791
If you ever need help
with your band, right,

1315
01:18:57,792 --> 01:19:00,500
I'm always there for you.

1316
01:19:00,501 --> 01:19:02,000
Okay?

1317
01:19:02,001 --> 01:19:03,792
- Yeah.
- All right.

1318
01:19:07,001 --> 01:19:08,626
Let's get on, then.

1319
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:17,000
Hello there.

1320
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:18,250
All right.

1321
01:19:18,251 --> 01:19:25,125
Let me introduce you to the man
who's been like a dad to me.

1322
01:19:25,126 --> 01:19:26,416
Ladies and gentlemen,

1323
01:19:26,417 --> 01:19:33,376
I give you Johnny Jones and
the Weapons of Happiness!

1324
01:19:42,417 --> 01:19:45,084
We're the Weapons of Happiness.

1325
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:53,792
One, two, three, four!

1326
01:20:04,042 --> 01:20:06,708
Free rock and roll,
free rock and roll

1327
01:20:06,709 --> 01:20:09,208
Free rock and roll, oh

1328
01:20:09,209 --> 01:20:11,791
Free rock and roll,
free rock and roll

1329
01:20:11,792 --> 01:20:14,458
Free rock and roll, oh

1330
01:20:14,459 --> 01:20:17,291
Go for the throat, oh,
destroy the system

1331
01:20:17,292 --> 01:20:19,875
Smash it all up, lose control

1332
01:20:19,876 --> 01:20:24,542
Start a revolution in
your livin' room now

1333
01:20:25,251 --> 01:20:27,916
- Free rock and roll
- 'Cause you can do

1334
01:20:27,917 --> 01:20:30,541
- Free rock and roll
- 'Cause you want to

1335
01:20:30,542 --> 01:20:33,083
- Free rock and roll
- Don't be afraid to

1336
01:20:33,084 --> 01:20:36,209
Bite the hand that
feeds you, spit it out

1337
01:20:37,167 --> 01:20:39,209
Free rock and roll

1338
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:41,667
Free rock and roll
