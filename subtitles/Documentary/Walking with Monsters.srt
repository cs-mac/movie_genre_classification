2
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:07,870
This is Earth.
Four point four billion years ago.

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,444
A toxic world with no hope of life.

4
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,306
Then everything changed.

5
00:00:50,564 --> 00:00:53,863
Another planet, Thea, smashed into Earth

6
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:55,694
and the two planets fused,

7
00:00:55,902 --> 00:00:58,268
creating a brand new world.

8
00:00:58,605 --> 00:00:59,970
Our world.

9
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:05,306
Even today,
Thea lies right beneath our feet.

10
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:11,482
A smaller chunk of Thea became our moon.

11
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:16,918
And slowly our oceans formed.

12
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:20,789
Until life on Earth was ready to begin.

13
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:25,395
But who would inherit this blue planet?

14
00:01:29,669 --> 00:01:34,629
This series tells the extraordinary story
of life before the dinosaurs.

15
00:01:35,408 --> 00:01:37,171
A time when strange and savage

16
00:01:37,377 --> 00:01:41,040
creatures fought a ruthless
battle to rule the Earth.

17
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:51,256
Amongst them were
our own earliest ancestors,

18
00:01:52,192 --> 00:01:56,561
whose survival would decide
whether we humans would exist at all.

19
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:02,197
As they evolved,

20
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:04,734
these bizarre creatures
created the blueprint

21
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:06,496
not only for our bodies,

22
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:09,072
but for everything living today.

23
00:02:20,253 --> 00:02:22,778
This is life's forgotten story.

24
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:27,526
An epic war for our world.

25
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:31,895
A war between monsters.

26
00:03:01,795 --> 00:03:03,763
This is our planet,

27
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:06,990
five hundred and thirty million years ago.

28
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:11,797
Nothing yet lives on land,

29
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:15,132
but in the ocean it's a different story.

30
00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:29,115
Life has already been evolving
for millions of years

31
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:31,722
at a slow and steady pace.

32
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,317
The seas are full of simple,

33
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:36,256
soft bodied creatures,

34
00:03:36,463 --> 00:03:39,057
blindly drifting in the currents.

35
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:45,126
Now, however, in the coastal shallows below,

36
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:48,774
evolution has stepped on the accelerator.

37
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:57,242
Predators have taken their first bite.

38
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:03,579
This is Anomalocaris,
Earth's first super predator.

39
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:09,620
This two metre long monster owes his success

40
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:12,992
to a monumental evolutionary landmark.

41
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:18,102
Eyes.

42
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:22,705
They may look bizarre but they're not unique.

43
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:26,643
Many predators in the Cambrian seas

44
00:04:26,846 --> 00:04:29,007
have also evolved eyes.

45
00:04:31,618 --> 00:04:33,483
And so have their prey.

46
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:37,684
The consequences have been explosive.

47
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,760
Being able to see and react to enemies

48
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:50,663
has triggered an arms race
between hunter and hunted.

49
00:04:53,406 --> 00:04:55,203
This battle continues today

50
00:04:55,408 --> 00:04:58,673
and is a major force behind the variety of life.

51
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:03,275
To combat being visible and vulnerable,

52
00:05:03,483 --> 00:05:05,883
eighty percent of creates in these shallow seas

53
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:09,522
have sturdy skeletons
on the outside of their bodies.

54
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,682
These armoured animals are called Arthropods.

55
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:14,621
ln the future,

56
00:05:14,828 --> 00:05:17,456
they'll give rise to insects and spiders.

57
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:20,856
But in these crowded waters

58
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:23,058
there's competition everywhere,

59
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:28,332
and even the mighty Anomalocaris's defences
are constantly put to the test.

60
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:21,756
Rigid armour splits if bent too far,

61
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:24,560
leaving the loser vulnerable.

62
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:28,362
To a completely different threat.

63
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:48,254
This is Haikouichthys.

64
00:06:48,454 --> 00:06:50,285
He's the size of your thumbnail,

65
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,856
but he's an evolutionary giant.

66
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:54,957
He's the first ever fish.

67
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:57,356
Our earliest known ancestor.

68
00:06:58,665 --> 00:06:59,427
He's unique,

69
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:02,430
because instead of having
armour on the outside,

70
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:04,296
he's tough inside.

71
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:08,097
He's evolved a primitive backbone.

72
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:14,746
He's the very first vertebrate.

73
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:17,746
Forerunner of all future backboned animals,

74
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:21,409
from the dinosaur, to the elephant, to us.

75
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:25,447
His flexible backbone makes him

76
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:28,786
more manoeuvrable than
spineless Anomalocaris.

77
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:32,795
He can scavenge flesh,
then dart away unharmed.

78
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:52,580
Our tiny backboned ancestors
have survived a sea of monsters,

79
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:55,252
but there are still many more battles ahead.

80
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:57,854
They must adapt or die.

81
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,059
Evolution takes over.

82
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:08,527
As millions of years pass,

83
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:11,397
fish build on their basic design.

84
00:08:11,704 --> 00:08:13,262
The muscles around their backbone

85
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:17,807
evolve into a powerful tail
and fins appear.

86
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:24,372
They evolve a distinct head.

87
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:33,454
He may not look like you or l,

88
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,154
but this odd fish is becoming
the blueprint for our own bodies.

89
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:53,643
This is Cephalaspis.

90
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:58,146
She's a peaceful grazer who sucks up algae
through herjawless mouth.

91
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:02,583
But she's also developed
a tough protective head and thick scales.

92
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:08,752
Our ancestor's arthropod enemies
have also been evolving

93
00:09:08,961 --> 00:09:11,623
and they're ready for round two.

94
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,009
A hundred million years have passed

95
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,943
and the fight for survival has filled
the Silurian seas with variety.

96
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:38,549
Some creatures here
would be recognisable today.

97
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:44,259
Sponges filter food alongside sea urchins.

98
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:52,067
The orthocone is a distant relative
of squid and cuttlefish,

99
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:54,600
but he's as long as a truck.

100
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:01,171
This world is terrorised by

101
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:05,909
a new improved generation
of armoured arthropods.

102
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,892
Meet Brontoscorpio.

103
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:23,157
He's a metre long
monster scorpion with gills

104
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:26,202
and a stinger the size of a light bulb.

105
00:10:53,475 --> 00:10:55,966
He zeros in on his next meal.

106
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:14,978
But Cephalaspis has evolved
an early warning system.

107
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:21,524
Special sensors on her skin
detect the tiniest vibrations in the water.

108
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:26,126
We've inherited similar senses.

109
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:28,493
They make us sensitive to touch.

110
00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:45,912
With her defensive headgear,
Cephalaspis can't swim fast for long.

111
00:11:46,118 --> 00:11:47,915
She must rest frequently.

112
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,884
Soon she'll tire completely.

113
00:12:09,508 --> 00:12:11,806
Cephalaspis suddenly changes her path.

114
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,241
She's picking up bad vibrations.

115
00:12:14,446 --> 00:12:17,574
Something Brontoscorpio can't detect.

116
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:37,168
Pterygotus is the Titan of sea scorpions.

117
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:41,166
The biggest arthropod of all time.

118
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:44,304
More than three metres long,

119
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,808
she's the size of a crocodile.

120
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,918
She has turned the tables on Brontoscorpio.

121
00:12:58,123 --> 00:13:00,557
He'll make a good meal for her young.

122
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:16,697
ln such dangerous seas
there's nowhere to hide.

123
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:18,433
When breeding seasons comes,

124
00:13:18,644 --> 00:13:21,613
the Cephalaspis congregate to
head for the one place

125
00:13:21,814 --> 00:13:24,806
they might escape a scorpion's grasp.

126
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,882
Fresh water, inland.

127
00:13:38,897 --> 00:13:41,889
Land at this time is like an alien planet.

128
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:46,902
lt's a barren expanse of roasting rock
hotter than the Sahara.

129
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:55,243
The air would be toxic to us.

130
00:13:55,444 --> 00:13:56,809
lt has much less oxygen

131
00:13:57,012 --> 00:14:00,539
and three hundred times more
carbon dioxide than today.

132
00:14:02,818 --> 00:14:06,811
But some forms of life
have gained a foothold in this furnace.

133
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,252
The first pioneering plants.

134
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:14,760
Cooksonia has a unique survival strategy.

135
00:14:14,964 --> 00:14:20,630
lt's the first plant to send shoots upwards,
trapping extra light to help it grow.

136
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:26,197
This basic design will eventually
lead to our tallest forests.

137
00:14:36,652 --> 00:14:40,986
The Cephalaspis convoy ploughs upriver,
away from the sea.

138
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,191
They're making the marathon journey

139
00:14:44,393 --> 00:14:47,419
back to the spawning grounds
where they hatched.

140
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:52,795
lncredibly our fish ancestors
already use memory.

141
00:14:53,002 --> 00:14:55,766
They use familiar landmarks to navigate.

142
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:02,842
Their toughened heads
protect a vital weapon.

143
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:05,513
One of the first complex brains.

144
00:15:07,316 --> 00:15:10,149
lt's much more developed
than their scorpion rivals

145
00:15:10,352 --> 00:15:12,320
who have no memory at all.

146
00:15:14,423 --> 00:15:16,323
lt's thanks to these primitive fish

147
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:19,392
that we can think and solve problems today.

148
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:24,929
But the fish have
underestimated their enemy.

149
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:35,534
lt is the arthropods and not our ancestors

150
00:15:35,744 --> 00:15:41,410
who have taken the first momentous steps
out of the sea into dry land.

151
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:46,914
Brontoscorpio has a huge advantage.

152
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:53,519
As well as gills

153
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:58,530
he has simple lungs made up of
hundreds of thin layers of tissue.

154
00:15:59,702 --> 00:16:02,193
He can't breath in and out like we do.

155
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:05,100
He just absorbs the oxygen into his blood.

156
00:16:12,114 --> 00:16:15,379
Equipped to maximise
the little oxygen available

157
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:18,246
and with their armour
to protect them from the sun,

158
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:21,253
the scorpions patrol the shoreline,

159
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:25,018
scavenging on whatever
the sea washes up next.

160
00:16:37,473 --> 00:16:40,636
Finally the fish approach their destination.

161
00:16:40,843 --> 00:16:43,505
They've navigated their way
back to the spawning pool,

162
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,577
where their lives began.

163
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:48,447
Weak from their long journey,

164
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,050
now they have to cross a ridge of rock

165
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:53,949
to make it from the river, to the pool.

166
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:12,572
The first fish make it through
and start to lay their eggs.

167
00:17:19,114 --> 00:17:22,515
But the exhausted Cephalaspis have company.

168
00:17:33,295 --> 00:17:36,662
Passing scorpions have stumbled
on this bounty.

169
00:17:52,881 --> 00:17:55,509
But the fish have numbers on their side.

170
00:17:55,818 --> 00:17:58,753
The clever Cephalaspis
have navigated their way,

171
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:02,117
while Brontoscorpio are only here by luck.

172
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:07,359
They're soon stuffed to the gills
while the fish keepjumping.

173
00:18:16,071 --> 00:18:20,235
One scorpion is still hungry,
but he can't feed.

174
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,845
He's become a prisoner in his own skin.

175
00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:30,684
His rigid skeleton is now a handicap.

176
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:33,419
lt can't grow with his body.

177
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:38,615
He needs to shed his hard skin
and then grow another,

178
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,660
expanding while the new one is still soft.

179
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,734
For such a large creature,
this is a long process.

180
00:19:06,388 --> 00:19:10,290
Next morning,
there's no sign of life in the spawning pool.

181
00:19:12,227 --> 00:19:15,162
The scorpion has missed his chance.

182
00:19:22,905 --> 00:19:25,100
Our ancestors have survived.

183
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:28,606
They've laid their eggs
and are returning to the sea.

184
00:19:29,111 --> 00:19:31,579
Brain has triumphed over brawn,

185
00:19:31,813 --> 00:19:35,010
and soon they won't be such soft targets.

186
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,252
Evolution starts to give
them weapons to fight back.

187
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,320
Over millions of years,

188
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:54,298
the fish's gills adapt to form
the first jaw with the very first teeth.

189
00:19:54,603 --> 00:19:57,401
Now they're equipped to go on the attack.

190
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:04,005
Some develop tougher bones and muscles
in their fins and shoulders,

191
00:20:04,212 --> 00:20:06,646
which become the first limbs.

192
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:10,346
This is where our arms and legs began.

193
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:16,584
With this four-limbed design,

194
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:21,456
our ancestors finally haul themselves
out of water on to land.

195
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:37,275
This is the giant amphibian, Hynerpeton.

196
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:42,646
The prototype land dweller
for the next three hundred million years.

197
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:03,470
Hynerpeton are over a metre
and a half in length,

198
00:21:03,672 --> 00:21:06,106
much larger than most amphibians today.

199
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,140
They've carved out a home
along the water's edge.

200
00:21:14,783 --> 00:21:16,751
Arthropod enemies still exist,

201
00:21:16,952 --> 00:21:20,547
but they've shrunk
since their Brontoscorpio glory days.

202
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:48,719
Still, life for this pioneer
is far from easy.

203
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:56,634
lt's a whole new world.

204
00:22:10,613 --> 00:22:15,346
ln the last fifty million years,
plants have developed into trees.

205
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,884
And with nothing around to eat them,

206
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:24,185
they've grown into vast forests
pumping oxygen into the air.

207
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:36,004
Hynerpeton has evolved complex lungs
to exploit this new oxygen.

208
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:43,905
His lungs are sacks, just like ours,
and he breaths like we do.

209
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:48,550
Forcing air in and out
so his blood can absorb more oxygen.

210
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:55,018
We still rely on the design
developed in this strange amphibian.

211
00:22:57,426 --> 00:23:01,123
Hynerpeton can breath on land,
but he's still water bound.

212
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:07,396
His skin is much thinner than ours
and it dries out in minutes,

213
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:09,468
so he has to keep it wet.

214
00:23:14,377 --> 00:23:17,210
And water is a danger zone.

215
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:32,190
The fish are now our ancestor's enemies.

216
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:40,459
Primitive sharks
are constantly on the hunt.

217
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:05,425
But even sharks are small fry
in comparison to some flesh eating fish.

218
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:14,759
Hyneria weighs two tons.
And is five metres long.

219
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:20,367
She's an insatiable carnivore.

220
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,462
The amphibian limbs are his saving grace.

221
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:48,426
For now.

222
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:55,635
As the burning sun dips,
Hynerpeton can spend more time on land.

223
00:24:58,314 --> 00:25:00,441
This stretch of shoreline is his territory

224
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,881
and his trump card with the opposite sex.

225
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:13,589
Hynerpeton females are choosy

226
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,625
and will only go for males
who can defend their turf.

227
00:25:19,035 --> 00:25:22,471
They also only mate during a short season.

228
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:32,877
The male's future
depends on passing on his genes

229
00:25:33,082 --> 00:25:35,915
and tonight could be his last chance.

230
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:47,126
As night arrives,
so does the competition.

231
00:25:49,532 --> 00:25:53,195
Another male with his eye
on this prime patch.

232
00:26:09,518 --> 00:26:10,815
To avoid injury,

233
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,548
the males demonstrate their strength
in a strange push up contest.

234
00:26:38,414 --> 00:26:40,746
This rival is not up to the challenge,

235
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:44,180
but now our male
may be too late for love.

236
00:26:58,501 --> 00:26:59,934
Dawn.

237
00:27:00,136 --> 00:27:03,867
And all the females in the area
have mated and moved on.

238
00:27:06,142 --> 00:27:08,906
Hynerpeton seems to
have missed his chance.

239
00:27:09,478 --> 00:27:13,972
The only attention he's attracting
comes from the dark waters of the lake.

240
00:27:23,826 --> 00:27:29,560
A female finally answers his call
and the male seizes the opportunity.

241
00:27:48,184 --> 00:27:51,415
Amphibian eggs are soft
and their young have gills,

242
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,555
not lungs, so they must be laid in water.

243
00:27:55,825 --> 00:27:58,851
Where amphibians are most vulnerable.

244
00:28:13,976 --> 00:28:17,639
Hyneria can attack like
a killer whale after a seal.

245
00:28:19,515 --> 00:28:21,847
Only just missing her prey.

246
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:26,718
But she has remarkably powerful fins.

247
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:36,325
And she takes the male by surprise.

248
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,070
The end for this Hynerpeton.

249
00:28:52,181 --> 00:28:54,411
But the amphibians are
about to find a way

250
00:28:54,617 --> 00:28:58,519
to leave the dangers
of the water behind for good.

251
00:29:03,192 --> 00:29:07,959
The key to their future success
lies in changing their eggs.

252
00:29:09,465 --> 00:29:12,298
They evolve a hard waterproof casing

253
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,561
which protects the young inside
from the drying sun,

254
00:29:15,771 --> 00:29:17,966
so they can be laid on land.

255
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:22,809
The babies will hatch out,
fully developed,

256
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:25,674
air breathing and independent.

257
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:31,884
They're the first ever
true vertebrate landlubbers.

258
00:29:33,722 --> 00:29:36,213
The very first reptiles.

259
00:29:38,894 --> 00:29:43,354
But as they move inland,
they'll face an ancient enemy.

260
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:46,864
More deadly than ever before.

261
00:29:48,103 --> 00:29:50,731
The arthropods are back.

262
00:30:19,877 --> 00:30:22,402
Three hundred million years ago

263
00:30:22,646 --> 00:30:27,140
much of the Earth
was covered in vast swamp forests.

264
00:30:30,354 --> 00:30:33,323
Here, nothing is as it seems.

265
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:39,723
The fifty metre giants towering above
this water world may look like trees,

266
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:43,229
but they're actually
distant relatives of ferns.

267
00:30:47,705 --> 00:30:49,969
Even the air is alien.

268
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,700
Over a third is oxygen.

269
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,970
Much higher than at any time in history.

270
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:00,082
This oxygen rich atmosphere
has fuelled the growth of new,

271
00:31:00,284 --> 00:31:03,515
super sized Arthropod predators.

272
00:31:12,296 --> 00:31:16,096
This Mesothelae spider
is the size of a human head.

273
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:19,165
She'd be hunting cats
if she were alive today.

274
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:24,436
She's an ambush predator.

275
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:27,667
Operating from her
underground headquarters.

276
00:31:31,415 --> 00:31:32,609
Safe in her borrow,

277
00:31:32,816 --> 00:31:36,775
she rests her feet
on carefully constructed trip lines.

278
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:42,389
These allow her to pick up vibrations
from the outside world.

279
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:56,799
Reptile,

280
00:31:57,007 --> 00:32:00,408
Petrolacosaurus is hunting
on the forest floor.

281
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:04,738
Unlike our amphibian ancestors,

282
00:32:04,948 --> 00:32:09,408
he has tough scaly skin
which traps moisture inside his body.

283
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,850
Vital for all land dwellers.

284
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,815
Because he doesn't dry out in the sun,

285
00:32:15,025 --> 00:32:17,459
he can venture away from water.

286
00:32:18,629 --> 00:32:21,655
But that means
encountering new predators.

287
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,452
The reptile outruns the spider.

288
00:32:51,995 --> 00:32:54,020
He's evolved a complex heart,

289
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:56,131
much more efficient than his enemy's.

290
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:58,460
ln fact the template for our own.

291
00:32:58,669 --> 00:33:03,470
lt's a powerful pump that pushes blood
and oxygen around his body to his muscles,

292
00:33:03,674 --> 00:33:07,235
so he can run at high speed
without stopping for a rest.

293
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:13,773
This time though
he's trapped inside a log.

294
00:33:26,597 --> 00:33:29,794
At first the spider's armour
stops her squeezing in.

295
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:34,365
But she's not going to give up so easily.

296
00:33:50,454 --> 00:33:51,512
Back in her lair,

297
00:33:51,722 --> 00:33:55,214
Mesothelae will inject her victim
with digestive juices

298
00:33:55,425 --> 00:33:57,859
to dissolve him from inside.

299
00:34:31,968 --> 00:34:35,131
There are other dangers in the swamp
apart from predators.

300
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:37,738
The water levels can change rapidly.

301
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:40,808
They've risen.

302
00:34:47,448 --> 00:34:51,612
The spider drags her dinner home,
but something's wrong.

303
00:34:58,926 --> 00:35:00,416
Her headquarters are flooding.

304
00:35:00,628 --> 00:35:02,459
She'll have to evacuate.

305
00:35:04,532 --> 00:35:08,263
She can't dig, so she'll have to
find another hole she can adapt.

306
00:35:10,071 --> 00:35:14,269
And once outside,
she's vulnerable to larger predators.

307
00:35:21,682 --> 00:35:24,344
Meganeurid is a monster dragon fly,

308
00:35:24,552 --> 00:35:27,214
queen of the carboniferous skies.

309
00:35:30,158 --> 00:35:31,955
With a wing span of almost a metre,

310
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,789
she's the size of an eagle
with an appetite to match.

311
00:35:42,603 --> 00:35:44,798
High above her carboniferous kingdom,

312
00:35:45,006 --> 00:35:47,236
normally she's invincible.

313
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:49,800
But trouble's brewing.

314
00:35:51,045 --> 00:35:54,037
The flood below
is due to an approaching storm.

315
00:35:54,882 --> 00:35:56,907
The super oxygenated atmosphere,

316
00:35:57,118 --> 00:35:59,211
which has helped
fuel the growth of the insects,

317
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,355
the Arthropods, is highly volatile.

318
00:36:02,723 --> 00:36:05,419
A lightning strike
could trigger an explosion.

319
00:36:07,462 --> 00:36:09,794
The clock is ticking for the swamp.

320
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:18,066
The rising water levels
suit one group of hunters.

321
00:36:19,073 --> 00:36:20,301
Amphibians.

322
00:36:20,508 --> 00:36:23,909
They've continued thriving
over the last sixty million years.

323
00:36:24,812 --> 00:36:28,339
Their thin skin still restrict them
to the water's edge,

324
00:36:28,649 --> 00:36:33,109
but they're now powerful predators
with a devastating pair ofjaws,

325
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:36,552
ready to ambush anything
that wanders within reach.

326
00:36:43,364 --> 00:36:46,663
The homeless spider
tries her luck further inland.

327
00:36:47,702 --> 00:36:50,364
But other Mesothelae
fill the forest floor

328
00:36:50,571 --> 00:36:52,869
and they don't like to share.

329
00:36:58,479 --> 00:37:00,470
Neither does Arthropleura.

330
00:37:00,681 --> 00:37:03,206
He's a distant relative
of modern millipedes,

331
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:05,282
but as long as a car.

332
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:10,654
He can rear up,
tall enough to look you right in the eye.

333
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:13,592
Although he's vegetarian,

334
00:37:13,794 --> 00:37:17,252
his strong jaws
could still deliver a nasty bite.

335
00:37:27,008 --> 00:37:28,339
With rising waters,

336
00:37:28,543 --> 00:37:32,639
Arthropleura's foraging leads him
into dangerous territory.

337
00:37:59,574 --> 00:38:01,439
ln this clash of the titans,

338
00:38:01,642 --> 00:38:04,372
the Arthropod's armour
is his best defence.

339
00:38:11,953 --> 00:38:14,046
Unless it gets split.

340
00:38:23,898 --> 00:38:27,561
lmpaled, his soft innards provide a feast.

341
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,969
The lightning storm is building,
moving ever closer.

342
00:38:38,045 --> 00:38:41,537
Just in time,
the spider finds another hole.

343
00:38:44,352 --> 00:38:46,320
A Petrolacosaurus is evicted,

344
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,148
but reptiles don't need
burrows to avoid danger,

345
00:38:49,357 --> 00:38:52,053
they have speed
and stamina on their side.

346
00:38:55,262 --> 00:38:59,221
Meanwhile, the spider starts
to turn the hole into a hunter's lair.

347
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:12,944
Night falls.

348
00:39:14,348 --> 00:39:18,148
And Mesothelae settles
into her new silk-lined home

349
00:39:19,754 --> 00:39:22,188
She tests the new trip lines.

350
00:39:22,456 --> 00:39:25,357
They're already picking up
vibrations from outside.

351
00:39:26,994 --> 00:39:28,962
The storm is very close now.

352
00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:35,133
Lightning strikes ignite
the oxygen rich air.

353
00:39:38,439 --> 00:39:42,398
The giant dragonflies are forced down
from the canopy to seek shelter below.

354
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:48,239
An unexpected windfall
for the water predators.

355
00:40:02,797 --> 00:40:03,661
Amid the chaos,

356
00:40:03,864 --> 00:40:07,698
Mesothelae seems safe
in her bunker underground.

357
00:40:24,151 --> 00:40:26,585
A huge fire, ignited by lightning,

358
00:40:26,787 --> 00:40:29,483
has devastated Mesothelae's neighbourhood.

359
00:40:35,162 --> 00:40:37,960
There are no signs of life above ground.

360
00:40:45,005 --> 00:40:49,237
However, a Petrolacosaurus managed
to outrun the flames.

361
00:40:51,212 --> 00:40:54,181
But now he heads
right into the spider's lair.

362
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:12,829
Mesothelae's hole was at
the centre of the lightning strike.

363
00:41:18,405 --> 00:41:21,602
The reptile gets a spider barbecue.

364
00:41:24,879 --> 00:41:28,042
The era of the giant bugs
is coming to an end.

365
00:41:28,415 --> 00:41:31,942
The climate is drying
and the atmosphere is losing oxygen.

366
00:41:32,386 --> 00:41:36,345
The monster insects
and spiders can't survive the change.

367
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,822
But with their efficient hearts
and waterproof skin,

368
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:46,329
our versatile ancestors flourish
in the new dry climate.

369
00:41:48,202 --> 00:41:50,636
Evolution takes over.

370
00:41:53,174 --> 00:41:54,664
Lacking restrictive armour

371
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:57,969
means the reptiles
can start to make it big.

372
00:42:02,283 --> 00:42:05,878
Their muscles and bones
broaden and extend.

373
00:42:08,289 --> 00:42:13,192
Their bodies mushroom into
huge new shapes and forms.

374
00:42:14,762 --> 00:42:18,027
Our distant ancestors
have come a long way.

375
00:42:18,465 --> 00:42:20,865
They've now conquered the land.

376
00:42:30,845 --> 00:42:34,713
The world's first
giant reptiles have arrived.

377
00:42:35,149 --> 00:42:37,174
But they're not related to dinosaurs.

378
00:42:37,384 --> 00:42:41,343
Their descendents will be
of a very different kind.

379
00:42:51,232 --> 00:42:54,793
Reptiles have now
spread all across the globe.

380
00:43:00,975 --> 00:43:04,172
Edaphosaurus bask
in the early morning sun.

381
00:43:05,846 --> 00:43:08,644
They're three metres long,
as big as hippos,

382
00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:11,579
and, like them, they're vegetarians.

383
00:43:18,425 --> 00:43:23,124
Life in their new Permian home
is a constant battle with the elements.

384
00:43:24,965 --> 00:43:28,162
The climate swings
between seasonal extremes.

385
00:43:28,369 --> 00:43:32,100
From burning summers,
to freezing winters.

386
00:43:35,876 --> 00:43:37,901
A new species of plant has evolved,

387
00:43:38,112 --> 00:43:41,548
able to withstand this cold,
dry atmosphere.

388
00:43:42,483 --> 00:43:44,280
Primitive conifers.

389
00:43:48,188 --> 00:43:49,314
ln this harsh world,

390
00:43:49,523 --> 00:43:52,754
creatures need ways
to regulate their body temperature.

391
00:44:10,127 --> 00:44:13,255
Edaphosaurus are sluggish
autumn morning chill,

392
00:44:13,463 --> 00:44:15,397
but they'll soon warm up.

393
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:18,997
Thanks to the huge sail on their backs.

394
00:44:22,339 --> 00:44:27,800
Their backbone has tall spines connected by
a thin membrane of blood filled skin.

395
00:44:29,313 --> 00:44:34,546
This large surface area can lose heat fast,
if the Edaphosaurus need to cool down.

396
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:38,645
While to heat up,

397
00:44:38,855 --> 00:44:41,551
they simply turn
their sails towards the sun,

398
00:44:41,758 --> 00:44:43,726
like a solar panel.

399
00:44:50,233 --> 00:44:54,067
Amazingly, these strange sailbacks
are related to us.

400
00:44:54,271 --> 00:44:58,935
They're part of a very special group
of creatures called mammal like reptiles.

401
00:44:59,142 --> 00:45:03,579
lt's down to them that we have control
over our body temperature today.

402
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,318
But Edphosaurus aren't
the only sailbacks,

403
00:45:13,523 --> 00:45:17,050
and now their biggest enemy
is one of their own kind.

404
00:45:28,972 --> 00:45:32,703
This is Dimetrodon, a vicious carnivore.

405
00:45:32,909 --> 00:45:35,343
The biggest reptile on Earth.

406
00:45:39,316 --> 00:45:41,944
She'd normally attack adult Edaphosaurus,

407
00:45:42,152 --> 00:45:44,382
but today she wants to avoid injury.

408
00:45:44,588 --> 00:45:48,115
She's pregnant and almost ready
to lay her eggs.

409
00:45:51,461 --> 00:45:54,487
She finds a smaller, softer target.

410
00:46:17,754 --> 00:46:19,415
This was only a mock charge,

411
00:46:19,623 --> 00:46:23,684
a tactic to disperse the group
and expose the vulnerable young.

412
00:46:25,162 --> 00:46:28,256
The panicking Edaphosaurus
flush their sails with blood,

413
00:46:28,465 --> 00:46:31,093
flashing an eye spot
to distract the predator's attention

414
00:46:31,301 --> 00:46:33,132
from their vulnerable head.

415
00:46:34,671 --> 00:46:37,469
But Dimetrodon can see
through their disguise.

416
00:46:58,261 --> 00:47:00,559
She locks on to her victim.

417
00:47:23,153 --> 00:47:25,553
As well as her sheer size and power,

418
00:47:25,755 --> 00:47:28,553
Dimetrodon has a killer edge.

419
00:47:30,227 --> 00:47:34,493
As a mammal like reptile,
she's evolved specialised teeth.

420
00:47:35,031 --> 00:47:37,727
lncisors shear off chunks of flesh.

421
00:47:38,135 --> 00:47:40,626
Serrated canines cut and slice.

422
00:47:41,071 --> 00:47:44,302
We humans have inherited
these same meat eating teeth.

423
00:47:45,675 --> 00:47:48,644
We have a smaller version
in our mouths today.

424
00:47:51,948 --> 00:47:55,042
The young Edaphosaurus
didn't stand a chance.

425
00:47:57,087 --> 00:47:59,749
This is a crucial kill
for the Dimetrodon.

426
00:47:59,956 --> 00:48:00,684
Before she lays

427
00:48:00,891 --> 00:48:04,292
she needs to eat enough
to last her for the next seven months.

428
00:48:05,028 --> 00:48:07,121
To boost her babies chances of survival,

429
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:10,390
she's evolved a basic form of parental care.

430
00:48:10,834 --> 00:48:12,392
Guarding her eggs.

431
00:48:13,236 --> 00:48:16,330
But the smell of blood
has attracted more Dimetrodon.

432
00:48:17,274 --> 00:48:19,606
Highly aggressive males.

433
00:48:33,423 --> 00:48:36,824
The female knows better
than to defend her kill.

434
00:48:39,296 --> 00:48:41,025
By the time the group has finished

435
00:48:41,231 --> 00:48:43,290
there'll be nothing left but bones.

436
00:48:47,337 --> 00:48:51,034
While lions today consume
seventy per cent of a carcass,

437
00:48:51,241 --> 00:48:53,607
Dimetrodon eat ninety.

438
00:48:56,446 --> 00:49:00,576
But they'll only eat intestines
after shaking out the waste inside.

439
00:49:01,585 --> 00:49:04,986
Dung is one thing
a Dimetrodon can't stomach.

440
00:49:21,104 --> 00:49:24,801
The female has built
a nesting mound of earth and wood.

441
00:49:34,651 --> 00:49:37,381
lnside, she digs a deep burrow.

442
00:49:45,962 --> 00:49:48,089
And starts to lay her eggs.

443
00:50:00,543 --> 00:50:05,071
She covers her brood carefully,
ready to begin her guard duty.

444
00:50:07,517 --> 00:50:10,247
Egg thieves lurk in the shadows.

445
00:50:12,822 --> 00:50:15,347
Like this carnivorous amphibian.

446
00:50:15,859 --> 00:50:18,657
But he's too small
to make a full frontal attack.

447
00:50:18,862 --> 00:50:22,423
He'll have to bide his time
until the female turns her back.

448
00:50:25,302 --> 00:50:28,863
The mother must also
constantly monitor the nest's temperature.

449
00:50:31,675 --> 00:50:35,406
Temperature control is vital
for reptiles even before they hatch.

450
00:50:37,113 --> 00:50:40,480
The mother piles on more earth
if the babies are too cold.

451
00:50:41,918 --> 00:50:46,855
And will remove a layer if they're too warm,
otherwise the babies will die.

452
00:50:53,229 --> 00:50:55,720
lt's going to be a long seven months.

453
00:51:12,529 --> 00:51:15,827
As autumn turns to bitterly cold winter,

454
00:51:26,966 --> 00:51:29,059
the landscape is transformed.

455
00:51:41,771 --> 00:51:44,433
Still the female keeps her vigil,

456
00:51:45,242 --> 00:51:48,575
getting weaker all the time
from lack of food.

457
00:52:10,372 --> 00:52:14,172
Until finally winter melts into spring.

458
00:52:26,417 --> 00:52:27,816
With the warmer weather,

459
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:31,079
the Edaphosaurus laze
beneath the conifers,

460
00:52:31,289 --> 00:52:34,725
shading their sails from the sun
to avoid overheating.

461
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:41,673
But there's much activity
at the nesting mound.

462
00:53:42,685 --> 00:53:45,017
And it's not the mother who's digging.

463
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:50,584
Another female is desperate to lay her eggs.

464
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:56,698
lf she takes over the mound,

465
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,666
she'll dig out and kill
the incubating young already inside.

466
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:08,808
The resident mother may be weak,

467
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:11,572
but she won't give up
her nest without a fight.

468
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:34,159
lt's a battle neither can afford to lose.

469
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:05,558
Next morning, just one female
remains at the nesting mound.

470
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:16,378
lt's the resident mother.
She's managed to wrestle off her rival.

471
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:20,273
But not without a sacrifice.

472
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:25,620
She won't be able to defend her eggs
or herself for much longer.

473
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:32,690
And the thieving amphibian
is poised to seize his chance.

474
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:46,536
As summer arrives,
the Edaphosaurus are thriving in the heat.

475
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:55,609
The young have grown
and test out their newfound strength.

476
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:08,395
But the mother Dimetrodon
has reached the end of hers.

477
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:14,763
So weak, she's helpless as
another intruder attacks her nest.

478
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,969
Luckily this large male has got his teeth

479
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:27,206
into something more substantial
than her young. The amphibian.

480
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:35,855
The precious eggs are safe
and ready to hatch.

481
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:39,929
The mother can hear them squeaking.

482
00:56:40,129 --> 00:56:41,960
She's achieved her goal.

483
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,833
But at this moment
her maternal bond is severed.

484
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:50,799
Unlike her mammal descendents,
she won't nurture her young.

485
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:55,504
Her instinct now is to save herself,
by finding food.

486
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,766
Without their mother's protection,

487
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,768
the babies will have to
be ready to go it alone.

488
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:29,810
They take their first steps into a perilous world

489
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:33,545
and must make a mad dash
for the safety of the trees.

490
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:43,551
A danger in a familiar form awaits them.

491
00:57:45,828 --> 00:57:48,797
Adult Dimetrodon are cannibals.

492
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:10,476
Not all babies are helpless.

493
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:14,248
Some already instinctively know
how to defend themselves.

494
00:58:17,226 --> 00:58:22,027
They roll in dung.
Something the adults can't stand.

495
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:26,465
Repelling their pursuers
long enough to get a head start.

496
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:51,686
One adult is driven on
by hunger and desperation.

497
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:56,856
The mother.
She'll weed out weaker babies straight away,

498
00:58:57,066 --> 00:59:01,469
which helps the strong ones
and her species as a whole survive.

499
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:06,474
And now the reptiles evolve
to tighten their grip on land.

500
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:13,842
Their legs straighten and lengthen,

501
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:16,745
holding them more upright
and giving them speed.

502
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:24,219
Their backbones and muscles get stronger
and they even start to look like mammals.

503
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:32,732
To house a larger brain
their skull bones expand into an enormous head.

504
00:59:33,302 --> 00:59:36,794
And out of their draw thrust huge, sharp teeth.

505
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:42,511
A new age of specialist reptiles had dawned.

506
00:59:51,108 --> 00:59:53,108
After millions of years of evolution,

507
00:59:53,167 --> 00:59:56,860
the war our distant ancestors
have waged so long

508
00:59:57,069 --> 01:00:00,470
is much more than a battle
between predator and prey.

509
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:07,137
The whole planet
is entering a different kind of crisis,

510
01:00:07,376 --> 01:00:10,274
one that will destroy
most of these monster reptiles

511
01:00:12,379 --> 01:00:16,780
and wipe out 90 per cent of life on earth.

512
01:00:30,813 --> 01:00:34,249
All the continents on earth
have now drifted together

513
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:38,284
to create on giant land mass called Pangaea.

514
01:00:38,654 --> 01:00:43,353
And at its centre lies the
largest desert the world has ever seen.

515
01:00:43,659 --> 01:00:48,028
lt's a brutal world where animals
have to be especially tough.

516
01:00:49,031 --> 01:00:51,056
Perfect for reptiles.

517
01:00:54,904 --> 01:00:58,237
This is a one-ton Siberian Scutosaurus,

518
01:00:58,441 --> 01:01:00,705
a distant ancestor of turtles.

519
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:05,210
Although he has no shell,
his back is covered in hard, bony plates.

520
01:01:05,415 --> 01:01:10,751
And just as well:
these sand dunes hide a fearsome predator.

521
01:01:11,788 --> 01:01:14,484
Scutosaurus normally travel in herds.

522
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:20,151
But this old male's got left behind,
and his keen nose senses danger.

523
01:01:36,145 --> 01:01:38,705
Once he tires, he's vulnerable.

524
01:01:58,367 --> 01:02:01,564
His attacker is a carnivorous Gorgonopsid.

525
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:10,640
She's fast, powerful, and equipped

526
01:02:10,847 --> 01:02:13,611
with deadly weapons
no hunter has had before.

527
01:02:21,524 --> 01:02:24,925
Exhausted, trapped
and weakened by his wound,

528
01:02:25,127 --> 01:02:27,652
the old Scutosaurus has no fight left.

529
01:02:29,465 --> 01:02:32,764
All he can do is wait for the killer blow.

530
01:02:53,489 --> 01:02:58,825
The Gorgonopsid's huge jaws
hold a pair of fangs 12 centimetres long.

531
01:02:59,228 --> 01:03:02,527
She has evolved
the world's first sabre teeth -

532
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:06,393
a lethal weapon
some mammal predators will later use.

533
01:03:18,014 --> 01:03:19,845
ln this harsh landscape,

534
01:03:20,049 --> 01:03:23,416
the reptile's biggest battle
is now with the elements.

535
01:03:23,753 --> 01:03:29,248
A massive surge in volcanic activity
is beginning to superheat the atmosphere,

536
01:03:29,458 --> 01:03:34,157
creating the highest temperature life
on earth has ever known.

537
01:03:36,632 --> 01:03:38,657
Each year the deserts spread.

538
01:03:38,868 --> 01:03:42,326
Even here in Siberia, far north of the equator,

539
01:03:42,538 --> 01:03:46,736
animals are forced to cluster around
any lasting source of water,

540
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,774
no matter how small.

541
01:03:55,318 --> 01:04:00,950
The huge female Gorgonopsid has come looking
for a drink to wash down the Scutosaurus,

542
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:05,258
and even smaller Gorgonopsids
will do well to keep out of her way.

543
01:04:06,095 --> 01:04:08,563
Five metres long from nose to tail,

544
01:04:08,764 --> 01:04:11,232
she's the top predator on earth.

545
01:04:11,434 --> 01:04:13,129
There'll be nothing to rival her

546
01:04:13,336 --> 01:04:17,432
until the dinosaurs evolve
in 30 million years' time.

547
01:04:20,142 --> 01:04:21,700
But unlike the dinosaurs,

548
01:04:21,911 --> 01:04:25,642
these early reptiles are more closely
linked to our ancestors,

549
01:04:25,848 --> 01:04:28,840
mammals, than to lizards and crocodiles.

550
01:04:29,518 --> 01:04:30,849
They don't have fur,

551
01:04:31,053 --> 01:04:34,181
but they've already evolved
scent glands in their skin.

552
01:04:34,423 --> 01:04:38,450
This way, everyone can tell
when the giant Gorgonopsid is around.

553
01:04:46,102 --> 01:04:48,161
Despite the presence of these heavyweights,

554
01:04:48,371 --> 01:04:52,137
smaller creatures also eke out
a living around the waterhole.

555
01:04:53,676 --> 01:04:58,340
Diictodon, a hardly little burrower,
just half a metre long.

556
01:05:02,184 --> 01:05:07,645
They live as pairs in spiral burrows
which remain cool even in the desert heat.

557
01:05:07,857 --> 01:05:09,688
Like the large predators outside,

558
01:05:09,892 --> 01:05:13,259
Diictodon are distant
reptile relatives of mammals,

559
01:05:13,462 --> 01:05:17,592
and although it will be 30 million years
before the first true mammals appear,

560
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,667
there are already family resemblances.

561
01:05:21,637 --> 01:05:25,767
ln particular, his hearing is linked to
tiny bones in his lowerjaw.

562
01:05:26,142 --> 01:05:29,407
One day these will evolve
into our middle ear bones,

563
01:05:29,612 --> 01:05:31,637
something no reptile has.

564
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,455
Several pairs of Diictodon
live around the waterhole,

565
01:05:40,656 --> 01:05:42,089
but this is not a colony,

566
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:46,352
they compete furiously for
the sparse vegetation that is their food.

567
01:05:46,629 --> 01:05:49,359
This frequently leads to confrontation.

568
01:05:56,672 --> 01:05:58,196
These clashes are one reason

569
01:05:58,407 --> 01:06:02,537
why both males and females
sport a pair of short tusks.

570
01:06:13,723 --> 01:06:17,659
There is, however,
one big advantage to living in a crowd:

571
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:22,124
if a neighbour spots danger,
everyone soon knows about it.

572
01:06:24,533 --> 01:06:27,297
A Gorgonopsid has come to investigate.

573
01:06:39,482 --> 01:06:43,885
A single snap of those enormous jaws
would crush Diictodon -

574
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,054
if they could get a grip.

575
01:06:48,557 --> 01:06:51,117
But it's not always size that counts.

576
01:07:00,703 --> 01:07:03,968
These tiny mouthfuls are more trouble
than they're worth.

577
01:07:05,708 --> 01:07:09,371
The Gorgonopsid knows that if she hangs
around the waterhole for long enough,

578
01:07:09,578 --> 01:07:12,672
eventually larger prey will come to her.

579
01:07:25,895 --> 01:07:29,661
There is another, unseen,
resident of this waterhole.

580
01:07:31,667 --> 01:07:35,865
A monster much less suited than
the reptiles to the changing climate.

581
01:07:36,705 --> 01:07:41,335
A fugitive from when this
desert world was lush and green.

582
01:07:42,344 --> 01:07:45,780
lt lies in ambush underwater,
like a crocodile.

583
01:07:52,621 --> 01:07:55,488
A giant amphibian Labyrinthodont.

584
01:07:57,393 --> 01:08:01,227
But pound for pound,
this female's picked the wrong target.

585
01:08:06,969 --> 01:08:11,736
The amphibian's ambush attempt
was probably driven by sheer desperation.

586
01:08:12,007 --> 01:08:15,841
For generations this waterhole
has supported a wide range of animals,

587
01:08:16,045 --> 01:08:18,775
including several other Labyrinthodonts.

588
01:08:19,048 --> 01:08:20,709
But this one is the last,

589
01:08:20,916 --> 01:08:24,977
and as the water she depends
on disappears, she's trapped.

590
01:08:36,665 --> 01:08:39,725
The wet season arrives,
but there's no rain.

591
01:08:40,302 --> 01:08:41,701
With life under such pressure,

592
01:08:41,904 --> 01:08:43,804
species are dying out at a rate

593
01:08:44,006 --> 01:08:48,466
that won't be matched until
humans evolve in 250 million years' time.

594
01:08:50,379 --> 01:08:54,076
The waterhole is now
no more than a large puddle.

595
01:08:59,288 --> 01:09:01,779
Diictodon are more adaptable than most.

596
01:09:02,024 --> 01:09:04,254
They can dig deeper to escape the heat,

597
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:07,190
carving out tunnels in the rock-hard mud.

598
01:09:12,401 --> 01:09:15,097
But the giant amphibian
is in big trouble,

599
01:09:15,304 --> 01:09:19,536
and as she grows weaker,
her enemy watches and waits.

600
01:09:19,942 --> 01:09:22,877
lt's a deadly game of cat and mouse.

601
01:09:30,586 --> 01:09:33,612
But life here is about
to change for everyone.

602
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:58,813
A migrating herd of Scutosaurus
has sniffed out the waterhole.

603
01:10:07,923 --> 01:10:11,120
lt's possible the smelt
the water several miles away,

604
01:10:11,327 --> 01:10:15,161
and this could well be the first drink
they've had in six months.

605
01:10:22,037 --> 01:10:25,006
The desert plants
are a poor source of nutrients,

606
01:10:25,207 --> 01:10:29,268
but these large reptiles are designed
to squeeze out every ounce,

607
01:10:29,511 --> 01:10:31,479
although they cannot chew.

608
01:10:32,748 --> 01:10:36,582
Their huge stomachs hold stones
they've picked up from the desert.

609
01:10:36,919 --> 01:10:41,788
These help grind the vegetation
so their digestive juices can get to work.

610
01:10:52,868 --> 01:10:56,326
The tough little Diictodons
are used to dodging danger.

611
01:10:57,873 --> 01:11:00,808
But the Gorgonopsid now
keeps her distance.

612
01:11:01,643 --> 01:11:05,773
Even she dare not attack
such a large armoured herd.

613
01:11:14,156 --> 01:11:15,817
lt's a standoff.

614
01:11:23,165 --> 01:11:26,293
lt turns out the Scutosaurus
are a bigger threat to life

615
01:11:26,502 --> 01:11:29,266
around the waterhole than the predators.

616
01:11:29,671 --> 01:11:32,231
Within a few days they have drunk it dry.

617
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:39,306
And moved on once again
in their eternal search for food.

618
01:11:49,258 --> 01:11:53,820
They represent the plight of
all creatures on the continent of Pangaea.

619
01:11:54,463 --> 01:11:59,196
The global drought is now obliterating
millions of years of evolution.

620
01:11:59,768 --> 01:12:02,896
Life everywhere is on the brink.

621
01:12:16,485 --> 01:12:18,851
For animals that do not migrate,

622
01:12:19,054 --> 01:12:21,716
the situation's reaching a crisis point.

623
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:31,957
Hunger drives the Gorgonopsid
back to the Diictodon -

624
01:12:32,167 --> 01:12:35,034
and this time she tries to dig them out.

625
01:12:44,413 --> 01:12:47,075
But the Diictodon's hard work pays off.

626
01:12:47,483 --> 01:12:51,886
Their tunnel in the sun-baked earth
is deep enough to keep them safe.

627
01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:59,559
lnstead, the Gorgonopsid's nose
leads her back to the dried-up waterhole.

628
01:12:59,962 --> 01:13:03,398
She senses things are not
as lifeless as they seem.

629
01:13:19,448 --> 01:13:21,177
The giant amphibian.

630
01:13:21,383 --> 01:13:23,613
Just before the waterhole dried up,

631
01:13:23,819 --> 01:13:26,014
she must have burrowed into the damp mud,

632
01:13:26,221 --> 01:13:28,416
forming a cocoon around herself,

633
01:13:28,624 --> 01:13:32,185
in a last-ditch
attempt to sit out the drought.

634
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,794
But in her torpid state,

635
01:13:35,998 --> 01:13:39,661
she's helpless as the Gorgonopsid feasts.

636
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:03,750
Eventually storm clouds gather,

637
01:14:03,992 --> 01:14:07,120
but instead of rainwater they bring sand.

638
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:18,904
The sandstorm sweeps in,

639
01:14:19,107 --> 01:14:21,735
burying the waterhole completely.

640
01:14:45,467 --> 01:14:48,527
The vast Pangaean deserts
continue to spread,

641
01:14:48,804 --> 01:14:51,466
snuffing out entire ecosystems.

642
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:55,376
Even the mighty Gorgonopsid
has at last succumbed.

643
01:14:55,644 --> 01:14:59,011
With no prey, even she could not survive.

644
01:14:59,815 --> 01:15:01,407
Mummified in the sand,

645
01:15:01,617 --> 01:15:04,745
this monster will soon
be nothing but dust.

646
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:10,721
Over the next few million years,

647
01:15:10,926 --> 01:15:14,828
the earth will suffocate
under a stagnant blanket of heat,

648
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:16,791
sparking a mass extinction,

649
01:15:16,999 --> 01:15:20,435
even greater than the one
that will destroy the dinosaurs.

650
01:15:21,136 --> 01:15:24,264
The future belongs to
a tiny group of survivors,

651
01:15:24,473 --> 01:15:27,601
small and adaptable enough to sit it out.

652
01:15:28,410 --> 01:15:31,504
The Diictodon carry on
digging throughout the drought.

653
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:34,246
This pair has unearthed plant tubers,

654
01:15:34,449 --> 01:15:38,977
which hold enough water and nutrients
to keep them going for several months.

655
01:15:47,562 --> 01:15:49,496
As millions of years go by,

656
01:15:49,698 --> 01:15:51,632
the climate shifts again,

657
01:15:51,833 --> 01:15:56,668
and the reptiles are among the first
to recover and repopulate the empty earth.

658
01:15:57,372 --> 01:16:02,810
From creatures like little Diictodon,
larger, stronger herbivores evolve.

659
01:16:03,845 --> 01:16:09,147
These tough forerunners of mammals
seem poised to seize control for good,

660
01:16:09,651 --> 01:16:13,678
but they are in fact
set to play out their final scene.

661
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:30,702
The dawn of the Triassic era,

662
01:16:30,906 --> 01:16:34,603
and the earth has only just begun
to show signs of recovery.

663
01:16:35,177 --> 01:16:36,667
The deserts have stopped growing,

664
01:16:36,878 --> 01:16:41,906
and huge forests of primitive conifer
start to re-colonise the land.

665
01:16:46,021 --> 01:16:49,957
ln these new forests,
plant eaters recover first.

666
01:16:50,292 --> 01:16:53,625
One in particular.
Like most of the large reptiles,

667
01:16:53,829 --> 01:16:55,694
they may resemble dinosaurs,

668
01:16:55,897 --> 01:17:00,857
but Lystrosaurus are more
closely linked to mammals - and to us.

669
01:17:01,269 --> 01:17:06,468
Astonishingly, their vast herds make up
more than half of all life on earth.

670
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:10,743
Never again will
a single species do so well.

671
01:17:15,217 --> 01:17:19,085
Deep within the forests, though,
a rival is evolving.

672
01:17:19,287 --> 01:17:24,281
A new type of animal,
destined to change the face of life on earth.

673
01:17:30,799 --> 01:17:34,667
Meet Euparkeria, a tiny insect-eater.

674
01:17:34,970 --> 01:17:37,837
He may not look much of a threat
to the dominant reptiles,

675
01:17:38,039 --> 01:17:41,202
but the key to his success is in his hip.

676
01:17:42,978 --> 01:17:45,037
The way his thigh bone is attached

677
01:17:45,247 --> 01:17:48,978
allows him to run on two legs,
freeing his hands.

678
01:17:56,091 --> 01:17:59,788
This kind of agility has never
been seen before in reptiles,

679
01:17:59,995 --> 01:18:02,623
and gives Euparkeria an edge.

680
01:18:15,844 --> 01:18:21,476
Euparkeria will lay the foundations for
a new group of reptiles - the dinosaurs.

681
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,647
Giants such as Tyrannosaurus
and Diplodocus can all trace

682
01:18:28,857 --> 01:18:33,920
their family tree back to this
little insect hunter in the Triassic forests.

683
01:18:43,505 --> 01:18:48,169
The monster herds of Lystrosaurus
hoover up so much vegetation

684
01:18:48,376 --> 01:18:51,675
that they constantly migrate
to find fresh food.

685
01:18:52,247 --> 01:18:54,408
They follow the seasonal rains,

686
01:18:54,616 --> 01:18:59,918
and each year in Antarctica this brings
them to the edge of a huge escarpment.

687
01:19:03,358 --> 01:19:08,261
The only way down for these cumbersome
animals is through a deep ravine.

688
01:19:31,286 --> 01:19:34,653
The herd moves mostly at night,
and come sunset,

689
01:19:34,856 --> 01:19:37,450
they begin the dangerous descent.

690
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:43,024
lt will take several hours
for all of them to pass through the ravine,

691
01:19:43,231 --> 01:19:46,632
and in some parts
there's only space to move in single file,

692
01:19:47,335 --> 01:19:49,735
which leaves them very vulnerable.

693
01:20:03,752 --> 01:20:08,018
Lystrosaurus have sharp eyesight
and a very good sense of smell.

694
01:20:08,456 --> 01:20:12,950
But in these cramped conditions
it's hard to spot trouble ahead.

695
01:20:18,967 --> 01:20:24,667
They're being watched by a vicious
nocturnal hunter - a therocephalian.

696
01:20:28,343 --> 01:20:30,811
Lystrosaurus are strong opponents,

697
01:20:31,012 --> 01:20:34,379
but this hunter doesn't rely
on power to make a kill.

698
01:20:44,593 --> 01:20:48,689
The attack is swift,
and seems to have been unsuccessful.

699
01:20:49,064 --> 01:20:52,431
But this predator's secret weapon
is a poisonous bite.

700
01:20:52,734 --> 01:20:55,294
lts venom is more lethal
than a black mamba's,

701
01:20:55,503 --> 01:20:58,700
and it quickly floods
the Lystrosaurus's blood stream.

702
01:21:00,108 --> 01:21:04,511
All the therocephalians have to do
is wait for it to take effect.

703
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:12,413
The victim collapses,
but the herd moves on without concern.

704
01:21:12,687 --> 01:21:14,746
They have no social bonds.

705
01:21:24,766 --> 01:21:27,667
The therocephalians close in for the kill.

706
01:21:41,149 --> 01:21:43,413
Dawn at the foot of the escarpment,

707
01:21:43,618 --> 01:21:47,486
and here the Lystrosaurus
will face their biggest challenge yet.

708
01:21:47,722 --> 01:21:52,557
They need to cross a river,
but its banks are lined with open jaws.

709
01:21:55,797 --> 01:22:00,097
Chasmatosaurs are the earliest ancestors
of crocodiles and alligators.

710
01:22:00,301 --> 01:22:03,862
Their strange overbite means
once they get their teeth into a victim,

711
01:22:04,072 --> 01:22:06,267
there is no chance of escape.

712
01:22:06,508 --> 01:22:08,499
They don't normally gather in such numbers,

713
01:22:08,710 --> 01:22:14,546
but they're here for a special event -
the annual migration of the Lystrosaurus.

714
01:22:16,518 --> 01:22:20,887
lf you're a Euparkeria, the river's
not a great place for hunting insects.

715
01:22:21,389 --> 01:22:23,448
But he has speed on his side.

716
01:22:35,570 --> 01:22:39,904
As the sun rises, the Chasmatosaurs
are drawn towards the water.

717
01:22:40,308 --> 01:22:41,468
Some of them haven't eaten

718
01:22:41,676 --> 01:22:45,077
since the Lystrosaurus
last passed this way a year ago.

719
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:48,113
Now they sense it's time to feed again.

720
01:22:59,961 --> 01:23:04,193
The front of the vast Lystrosaurus
herd finally reaches the river.

721
01:23:10,605 --> 01:23:14,803
They're strong swimmers,
but drowning is not the danger here.

722
01:23:20,548 --> 01:23:24,075
They linger at the river's edge,
reluctant to go in.

723
01:23:24,853 --> 01:23:27,788
For reptiles,
they have relatively large brains,

724
01:23:27,989 --> 01:23:30,457
and they remember what happened last year.

725
01:23:31,459 --> 01:23:34,394
But with more Lystrosaurus
arriving all the time,

726
01:23:34,629 --> 01:23:37,097
the backlog will soon force them in.

727
01:23:45,373 --> 01:23:48,570
On the other side, lush grazing beckons,

728
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:52,175
and eventually the first one
takes the plunge.

729
01:24:01,689 --> 01:24:04,920
A strong swimmer,
he quickly makes it to the other side.

730
01:24:05,193 --> 01:24:06,057
But with the steep banks,

731
01:24:06,261 --> 01:24:08,855
he's still got to find a place
where he can get ashore,

732
01:24:09,097 --> 01:24:12,533
and every extra moment
in the water increases the risk.

733
01:24:22,677 --> 01:24:26,579
More and more Lystrosaurus
warily strike out for the other side.

734
01:24:31,553 --> 01:24:34,078
But now the predators are homing in.

735
01:24:52,707 --> 01:24:56,336
The first swimmer has made it,
and clambers ashore.

736
01:24:56,544 --> 01:25:00,571
But many of the herd now
entering the water will not be so lucky.

737
01:26:01,509 --> 01:26:02,703
Despite the carnage,

738
01:26:02,911 --> 01:26:05,607
the herd is soon reforming on the other side.

739
01:26:13,554 --> 01:26:16,489
The predators are quickly sated and exhausted.

740
01:26:17,892 --> 01:26:19,826
Although many Lystrosaurus are dead,

741
01:26:20,028 --> 01:26:23,225
it's still only
a small proportion of the herd.

742
01:26:27,035 --> 01:26:31,301
The dominance of these strange
mammal-like reptiles is short-lived.

743
01:26:31,506 --> 01:26:34,168
As the plant recovers, so does competition,

744
01:26:34,375 --> 01:26:38,243
and the brief glory days
of Lystrosaurus will soon be gone.

745
01:26:45,787 --> 01:26:49,518
This is followed by a decline
in all mammal-like reptiles,

746
01:26:49,724 --> 01:26:53,956
consigning our ancestors
to the shadows for millions of years.

747
01:26:58,166 --> 01:27:04,162
lnstead, it is creatures like Euparkeria
that are about to usher in a new golden age.

748
01:27:05,873 --> 01:27:09,502
These specialists on two legs
will provide a cornerstone for

749
01:27:09,711 --> 01:27:13,147
one of the greatest dynasties
the world will ever see.

750
01:27:15,383 --> 01:27:18,546
Their descendants will become
the dominant life form on earth

751
01:27:18,753 --> 01:27:21,620
for more than 170 million years,

752
01:27:22,256 --> 01:27:26,192
and be known as the most
notorious monsters of them all.

753
01:27:36,204 --> 01:27:39,662
Welcome to the Age of Dinosaurs.
