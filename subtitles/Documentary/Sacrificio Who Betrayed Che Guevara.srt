1
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,120
Get up

2
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,080
Let's go.

3
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,360
Who's that?

4
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,040
Don't you ever come out again...

5
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,200
Fighting with your wife again?

6
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
I didn't come home last night

7
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,560
You're out of line

8
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,080
I know

9
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,960
But my girlfriend threatened to kill herself

10
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,360
Unless I stayed with her

11
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,960
You shouldn't be having a girlfriend because you're married!

12
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,040
Italians can't live without love

13
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,360
All you Chinese know is work

14
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,240
We're very selective about love

15
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,440
We've got to go to work

16
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,160
I can't go out. She'd kill me

17
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,240
Move over and let us out

18
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,080
She'd kill you too

19
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,440
We'll go down from the balcony

20
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,280
Aren't you afraid of the Spaniard below?

21
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,200
No. I'll go first

22
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,320
I'm going down

23
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,280
What's going on with you?

24
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,240
Don't you Chinese use the stairs?

25
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
The Italians are fighting in the stairway

26
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,080
Come on

27
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,960
You signaled me to jump

28
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,520
I signaled you not to

29
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,640
You should have shouted

30
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,440
I was going to...

31
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,080
What?

32
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
But you jumped before I could yell

33
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,480
Which is the way to Via Layetana?

34
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,440
Via Layetana?

35
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,080
Where's Via Layetana?

36
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,960
Why do you ask?

37
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,800
Straight on from here and first on your left

38
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,200
When you get to C. Mallorca then...

39
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,160
Then what?

40
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,840
You're lost

41
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,640
You've just missed C. Bilbao

42
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,040
What should I do then?

43
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,080
Turn left at C. Bilbao where you'll see a fountain

44
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,760
Make sure you know whether it works or not

45
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,240
If it works?

46
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,080
Then Via Layetana is right ahead of you

47
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,920
What if it doesn't?

48
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,560
That means the City Council has closed the street for repairs

49
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,600
Then you'll have to find another way through

50
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,560
I now understand. Thank you

51
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,520
Hi...

52
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,920
I'm terribly sorry

53
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,640
I really didn't mean it, officer

54
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,520
Let me help you, officer

55
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,040
I'm sorry.

56
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,400
We apologize, officer

57
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,960
Don't let me catch you washing your car here again

58
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,240
Move on. Do you here me?

59
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,960
We won't do it again

60
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,440
Good morning, sir

61
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,280
Have you been chimney sweeping?

62
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,560
No

63
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,520
Then why the blacken face?

64
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,400
Damn Chinese!

65
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,840
Private detective Matt

66
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,640
Hold it!

67
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,480
Boss?

68
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,080
What are you doing?

69
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,280
Just exercising

70
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,520
Why didn't you have the light fixed?

71
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,920
Power's been cut off

72
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,920
My account's only 3 days overdue

73
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,840
And they cut the supply off

74
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,600
You haven't paid me for 3 months

75
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,840
I've kept you employed though

76
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,200
If I had let you go

77
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
You couldn't have found another job

78
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,920
Without a job, bye bye to Spain

79
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,080
But I could have paid the electricity bill for you

80
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,080
Now you're talking like a good employee

81
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,160
Anybody looking for me?

82
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,040
The phone company sent 2 guys here

83
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,440
They couldn't have come to hire me

84
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,560
They came to take the phone away

85
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,880
No wonder it's so quiet here

86
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,680
Alfonso also came here to see you

87
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,800
Alone?

88
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,720
No, with two muscle types

89
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,000
What did he want?

90
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,760
He said you owed him 10,000 Pesetas

91
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,360
That's a coded message

92
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,480
It means he's got a new lead

93
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,200
He also asked when you’d be back

94
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,320
Next time he comes, tell him I'm out of town

95
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,680
That's another coded message

96
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,960
You can tell him yourself

97
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,680
Why?

98
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,200
He said he'd back at noon.

99
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,480
Which is about now

100
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,640
What? Why didn't you tell me sooner?

101
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,640
What's the big deal? Another coded message?

102
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,000
It means my life's in danger

103
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,320
I have to find a place to hide

104
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,600
You're now the acting chairman of this agency

105
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,320
You're in charge

106
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,240
That means a promotion.

107
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
And a raise?

108
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,240
Don't kid yourself

109
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,320
Acting chairman's still a chairman

110
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,600
I'd better put a tie on

111
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,520
Please have a seat...
Before you tell me why you're here

112
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,920
Let me tell you my principle

113
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,080
I don't kill, I don't lie, I don't cheat

114
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,800
because I have no guts

115
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,920
Now, you can tell me how can I help you

116
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,680
How about find a person for me

117
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,320
Find a person? I won't...

118
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,360
What? You won't find person?

119
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,480
I won't disappoint you.

120
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,400
You are...

121
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,240
Chinese, a real Chinese

122
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,720
Then I don't want to waste time

123
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,160
I'm now appoint you
to find a woman Gloria and her kid

124
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,000
A boy, a girl?

125
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,160
No, only one

126
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,240
Boy or girl then?

127
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,920
You have to find it out

128
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,480
This is Gloria's information

129
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,840
and a picture
but it was 22 years ago

130
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,600
It's really not that easy

131
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,520
I won't pay you if it's a easy job

132
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,400
If you take this case
I still have 2 conditions you've to follow

133
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,240
I got a condition, too. You tell me first

134
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,480
Firstly, you must be low profile

135
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,680
Secondly, you must finish the job
in 14 days

136
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,200
This is the deposit

137
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,920
After the job's done
You'll be entitled with 20,000 US dollars

138
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,960
Now, tell me what's your condition

139
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,840
Mine one is I accept all your conditions

140
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,400
Great! Whenever you got any news

141
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,040
call me on this number

142
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,920
Want to test me?

143
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,880
What are you doing?

144
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,600
My antiseptic is better than yours

145
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,560
I'm awaiting your good news

146
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,160
Let's got started

147
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,080
Go take orders

148
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,800
A coke please

149
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,320
What would you like?

150
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,320
Coffee, with milk.

151
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,120
Coming right away

152
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,200
Anything to eat?

153
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,600
No

154
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,840
What would you like?

155
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,280
One 22, and one 16.

156
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,840
Coming right away

157
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,320
You want something to drink?

158
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,240
A coke.

159
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,280
A coke

160
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,720
These are the orders.

161
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,880
Okay

162
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
A salad, 2 hot dogs

163
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,000
Fried rice

164
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,200
A double, that's fit

165
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,840
Here

166
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,280
There you go.

167
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,320
Thank you

168
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,640
What's going on?

169
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,240
How dull!

170
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,440
Let's go

171
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,440
You're ruining my business

172
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,000
Can you go somewhere else?

173
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,800
What's your problem?

174
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,880
You're ruining my business

175
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,000
Do your business elsewhere

176
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,000
Well?

177
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,160
Let's race one round this square

178
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,800
The loser picks up the tab for today

179
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,600
Sure

180
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,640
I'll be the referee

181
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,680
Ready, go!

182
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,800
Faster

183
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,160
Get away

184
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,920
Faster

185
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,520
Faster, we're counting on you

186
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,720
Where are the customers?

187
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,760
Scared away by the Hell's Angels

188
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'll take to them

189
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,040
I've done that already, no use

190
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,760
Pack up and drive off

191
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,000
Why?

192
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,920
We'll play Robin Hood

193
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,200
Faster

194
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,320
My mother told me I shouldn't fight

195
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,240
Did she tell you not to come here?

196
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,560
Yes, but I forgot all about it

197
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,280
I won't fight you. I'm leaving

198
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,560
Get back to work

199
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,200
Good morning.

200
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
Show me your pass

201
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,640
Thank you

202
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,600
Bye

203
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,480
When will your father out?

204
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,120
Mental illness is tough to handle

205
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,920
God knows when he's be out

206
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
Damn, a flat tire

207
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,960
That's no big deal

208
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,880
What said it's a big deal?

209
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,840
You sure sounded like it's one

210
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,120
How should I have reacted then?

211
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,840
"Ha! Ha! A flat tire!"

212
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,280
No normal person would have reacted that way

213
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,920
Ha! Ha! A flat tire!

214
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,480
You're right. Only nuts would say that

215
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,160
Change the tires

216
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,560
Have you got a magnet?

217
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,200
No, but what for?

218
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,560
I can tie a string around it

219
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,040
What the hell are you talking about?

220
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,320
I can then lower it into the gutter

221
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,160
Are you sober?

222
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,640
Yes

223
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,040
Why would you lower a magnet into the gutter?

224
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,880
I have to salvage the nuts

225
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,480
What nuts?

226
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,720
Those nuts?

227
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,320
You're quite smart

228
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,400
We really need a magnet

229
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,080
I told you

230
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,600
We're stuck

231
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,200
I've seldom seen people so dumb

232
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,120
And you're not?

233
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,560
At least I know how to solve the problem

234
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,640
Enlighten us

235
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,800
Take one nut off each of the other tires

236
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,200
Then you got three

237
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,160
That'd hold the tire temporarily

238
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,640
I agree

239
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,640
You're a smart guy. Why are you here?

240
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,520
I'm here because I'm psychologically unbalanced

241
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,200
Not because I'm dumb

242
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,640
Those are 2 different issues

243
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,840
You're really dumb

244
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,680
I'd better not waste my time with you guys

245
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,800
I'll find another beach

246
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,400
Let's change tires

247
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,880
What does he doing?

248
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,840
How do I know?

249
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,640
Let's go and ask

250
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,640
No...

251
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,920
Come on

252
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,280
Hey pal, what're you doing?

253
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,920
I'm a clock. I'm counting time.

254
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,840
So what's the time?

255
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,240
Two-thirty

256
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,120
Wait a minute. It's two forty-five

257
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,040
Oops...

258
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,080
What's your Dad doing?

259
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,480
Fishing

260
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,280
Dad, we've come to see you

261
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,200
Speak softer. You scared my fish

262
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,400
Are you bored, uncle?

263
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,560
The whole world's boring

264
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,200
Found a girlfriend for David yet?

265
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,440
There aren't that many Chinese girls in Spain

266
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,120
Who said it had to be a Chinese?

267
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,960
Love transcends nationality

268
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,000
He's changed

269
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,960
I'm really worried

270
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,280
What's that guy doing?

271
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,600
Telling himself a joke

272
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,960
Isn't that funny?

273
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,120
What's wrong this time?

274
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,480
He's heard that joke before

275
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,880
Fishing?
Catch one for me

276
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,000
I didn't know you're a nut too

277
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,760
How can one fishing from a bucket?

278
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,080
Your father seems getting better now

279
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,160
It rings

280
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,560
It's time for the date.
I don't mind if you come with me

281
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,400
I wonder who his date is

282
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,360
Beats me

283
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,760
That's why "love transcends nationality"

284
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,960
No wonder he's getting better

285
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,600
Where's your Mum?

286
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,240
She's making herself up.

287
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,880
She sent me here so you won't be impatient

288
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,080
Tell her to take her time

289
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,240
I'll wait here very patiently

290
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
I know what you're thinking

291
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,520
I know what you're guessing

292
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,520
But I'm not thinking about that

293
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,240
I'm not guessing

294
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,400
I know, because I'm think about that myself

295
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,680
We're on the same wavelength then

296
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,200
Which means we should both forget about it

297
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,880
So pretty

298
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,880
She belongs to my Dad

299
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
Okay...

300
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,520
We'll be on our way

301
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,240
See you next week

302
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,480
Don't go. You have to meet my date

303
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,840
Some other time

304
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,440
There

305
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,960
Gloria Darling

306
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,720
You look terrific

307
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,760
I miss you so

308
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,480
I know what you're thinking

309
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,560
Likewise here

310
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,840
We're thinking about the same thing

311
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,680
Make a move then

312
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,600
I've got to run.
Goodbye

313
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,320
Tell your Dad we're leaving

314
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,520
Dad, we've got to go.

315
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,120
That's right

316
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,600
Wait, I want you to meet Gloria

317
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,160
That's my son David
and his friend Thomas

318
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:26,800
How do you do?

319
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,400
Go and leave us alone

320
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,760
Come on

321
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,320
She's waiting for a cab

322
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,280
What an opportunity!

323
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,240
Tell her we'll give her a ride

324
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,080
Cabs are too expensive

325
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,600
What if she likes taking cabs?

326
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,080
Don't be silly

327
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,520
You go talk to her

328
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,360
I'll drive the van here

329
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,080
I'm giving you a break

330
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,520
You go talk to her

331
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,240
Hello

332
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,120
Your cab

333
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,160
Bye

334
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,160
She turned you down?

335
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,720
I didn't offer anything

336
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,320
You're so useless

337
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,200
The result would have been the same

338
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,560
Of course not

339
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,960
You had zero chance because you didn't ask

340
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,760
You had a 50% chance if you did though

341
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,160
Elegant, nice
She may be a princess

342
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,200
A princess with a crazy mother?

343
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,600
Why not?

344
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,520
Maybe. Get in

345
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,680
2,000 Pesetas? Not enough!

346
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,880
Don't be nasty. Let's make a deal

347
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,200
How about 4,000?

348
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,200
Okay

349
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,280
Thomas, 2 coffees please

350
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,200
Order afterwards

351
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,600
You won't take that long

352
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,880
Get them to settle their accounts tonight

353
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,680
How much do I owe you?

354
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,560
1,250 Pesetas

355
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,840
Here's 1,300.
Keep the change.

356
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,880
Thanks you

357
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,000
Can I have a free spring roll?

358
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,760
That spring roll cost 70 Pesetas

359
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,080
Are you new here?

360
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,440
What's your price?

361
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,680
How about 3,000?

362
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,320
Save that for pension

363
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,440
Get away

364
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,840
Hello

365
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
Princess wouldn't come to a place like this

366
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,000
You can go and take a look yourself

367
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,560
15,000 Pesetas

368
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,120
That's US$100, very reasonable.
Let's go

369
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,840
She went with him

370
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,040
So? She's not your girlfriend

371
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,520
What's your problem?

372
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,920
You've treated me too many free spring rolls

373
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,480
Let me give you a good time tonight

374
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,920
Thank you, but we can't

375
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,480
I didn't know she'd be a hooker

376
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,120
At least she's an expensive one

377
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,400
She may need money
How much cash do you have?

378
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,040
Why?

379
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,080
Come on

380
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,200
20,000 and change

381
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,280
Too much for a good time

382
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,240
What?

383
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,160
I'm giving it to her

384
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,720
So she's got a night off. What about tomorrow?

385
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,640
There are so many hookers here

386
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,400
Everyone has her own problem
Can we help them all?

387
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,320
We can't even afford one free spring roll each

388
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,040
Let's work

389
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
You stole my wallet

390
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,040
Don't you dare running away

391
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,440
Did you see a girl running through?

392
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,160
What does she look like?

393
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,040
Dressed in red. Tall and with long hair

394
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,240
One should be careful with one's wallet

395
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,040
What's wrong?

396
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,040
I think I've got a fever

397
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,680
What do you want to do?

398
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,400
I want to go home

399
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,760
Take this last order then

400
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,720
Thomas, did you see a tall and skinny girl?

401
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,880
Like this?

402
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,920
Yes

403
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
There are many over there

404
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,760
Be serious.

405
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
No

406
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,800
Let's search

407
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,080
So Princess is a hooker

408
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,920
and a pickpocket

409
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,840
Maybe that guy lost his wallet elsewhere

410
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,240
One shouldn't condemn people on rumors

411
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,400
We've arrived home

412
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,760
You think I don't know?

413
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,360
I wasn't talking to you

414
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,320
No wonder you said you're not feeling well

415
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,880
Calm down, don't be mad at me

416
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,880
Let's all get off first

417
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,720
This is the end of your ride

418
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,520
I want to be with you

419
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,880
Come visit our apartment

420
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,640
You want me to tell her she's not welcome?

421
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,680
No, I grabbed the wrong hand
Our home is over there

422
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,920
It'll be our pleasure

423
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,600
Thanks

424
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,600
Mr. Lover's home tonight

425
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,640
Have you seen fatso around?

426
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,160
Not for a while

427
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,000
Someone close and dear just passed away?

428
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,400
No, why?

429
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,000
You look as if you’re dressed for a funeral

430
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,840
Hey, long time no see

431
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,160
It's you! Come and have a drink with us

432
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,920
Come... I can't get drunk today

433
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,600
Have you see fatso around?

434
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,720
Just got here myself. What's the big deal?

435
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,120
How do you know about our "big deal"?

436
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,600
I'm now the deputy chief of Matt's agency

437
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,240
But don't tell anybody about this

438
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,280
What sort of person do you think I am?

439
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,200
Drink this or else

440
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,440
I can't get drunk today.

441
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,280
I really can't

442
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,360
Moby, it's been a long time. Have a drink

443
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:41,800
Only a drink.

444
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,840
Fine, just one drink

445
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,480
Come, sit I'll have another as well

446
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,360
Have you seen fatso?

447
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,480
No, what do you want him for?

448
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,360
Can I trust you guys?

449
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,960
But we've known each other for years

450
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:57,960
Keep your secrets to yourself

451
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,280
I don't care much to keep your secrets for you

452
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,160
Okay, listen good

453
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,360
Swear you won't tell anybody about this

454
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,840
I'm now...

455
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,440
the deputy chief of Matt's agency

456
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,440
I want to talk to fatso about something important

457
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,840
That calls for a celebration drink

458
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,360
Thanks...

459
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,920
Cheers...

460
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,880
Moby's been promoted!

461
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,160
I really can't get drunk today

462
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,120
I'll have to find fatso

463
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,080
Many congratulations, Moby

464
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:38,400
Cheers...

465
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,960
Keep my little secret to yourselves

466
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,080
Goodbye

467
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,200
See you

468
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,880
Darling, this is Moby

469
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,280
Can I have a little kiss?

470
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,760
How can I ever forget you?

471
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,160
I've been very busy

472
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,920
I swear to God that was the truth

473
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,200
Okay, that's alright

474
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,520
Just look at her friend! What a pig!

475
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,440
I really can't do it tonight

476
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:30,320
Alright, can I have another kiss?

477
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,520
Am I speaking loud enough

478
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
Just a minute.

479
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,360
It's your wife!

480
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,280
I'll kill you for fooling around

481
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,240
Come out. Let me shoot you

482
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,720
Susanna, calm down

483
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,520
Dino's got lipstick on his underpants

484
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,520
I'm innocent

485
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,920
Those are lady's panties
Not mine

486
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,600
Why are you wearing them?

487
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,680
I was in a hurry

488
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,520
I'll kill him

489
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,240
Susanna, this is our door

490
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,120
Let me go in

491
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,240
Don't point your rifle at our door

492
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,480
Let go

493
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,240
Let go of me

494
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,080
You're mad because you don't want to lose him

495
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,600
So you don't really want him dead

496
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,840
That might have been a one night affair
But you're his wife. He loves you

497
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,600
Though he's no good
it doesn't mean you can have another one better than him

498
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,200
In fact, I love him too

499
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,640
Do you remember the first time we meet?

500
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,520
Love at first sight.

501
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,360
Really?

502
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,400
You're my whole life

503
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,760
I can't live without you Dino

504
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,920
You bastard

505
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,240
I got to kill you. Don't run away!

506
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,280
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have barged in

507
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,600
Don't stay too long though

508
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,480
I'm not leaving tonight

509
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,480
What?

510
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,880
You've any objections?

511
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,080
No, as long as she's not afraid

512
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,840
Afraid of you guys?

513
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,920
What would we do?

514
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,120
Sleepwalking

515
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,760
Fatso?

516
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,080
Fatso. What happened?

517
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,800
Were you robbed?

518
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,320
You're too heavy

519
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,520
What happened?

520
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,920
It's none of my business anyway

521
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,560
I need some information from you
You've to be honest to me

522
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,600
You were Mr. Pimp on Hookers Street 18 years ago

523
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,880
Did you know any Gloria then?

524
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,880
She might had been pregnant
or just got a baby then

525
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,880
What?

526
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,680
They were asking for Gloria just now?

527
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,000
Did you tell them?

528
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,400
Didn't...

529
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,560
That's better

530
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,760
If I didn't tell... I'd have been killed

531
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,360
It means you know where Gloria is

532
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,040
No... yes...

533
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,720
Buddy
Could you try not to be stammered

534
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,640
Where did Gloria use to live?

535
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,880
62 Thanksgiving Street

536
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,480
Aren't you mind she might...

537
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,880
We can hide our money

538
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,640
If she really try to do that
and can't find the money anywhere

539
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,240
Then she'll know we've taken precautions

540
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,040
And her pride will be hurt

541
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,520
Let's just leave little money in our wallets

542
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,200
Even if she did steal it The price we pay for
to know a person won't be too high

543
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,640
and it worthwhile

544
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,000
I didn't know you could be that smart

545
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,240
You gave her the shirt?

546
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:29,760
Yes

547
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,400
It looks better on her

548
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,280
What are you talking about me?

549
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,480
Beauty

550
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,840
I heard you said more than one word

551
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,680
You're gorgeous

552
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,560
Where am I going to sleep? Have you decided yet?

553
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,280
In... Living room

554
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,840
Thanks. My name's Sylvia

555
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,480
I'm David.

556
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,000
I'm Thomas

557
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,320
Good night

558
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,440
I don't want to sleep yet. You go to bed if you feel sleepy

559
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,640
I want to watch TV

560
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,320
Let me turn the set on for you.

561
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,320
Thank you

562
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,080
Good night

563
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,520
You'll sleep much better with this pillow

564
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,360
Thank you

565
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,000
Can I get you a glass of water?

566
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,360
Please

567
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,200
It's cold in the night
I'll get you a blanket

568
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,240
Thank you

569
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,360
My pleasure

570
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,200
Water has no taste. I'll get you a cup of milk

571
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,920
It's true

572
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:29,880
Here you are. Thank you

573
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,800
Let's not wasting time

574
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,600
Who wants to sleep with me first?

575
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,200
Makes no difference to me

576
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,960
Forget it

577
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,440
Good morning

578
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,040
Did you calm Susanna down?

579
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,800
Of course. She loves me.

580
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,040
That's good

581
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,320
Have you seen my car?

582
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,480
No

583
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,880
Susanna, my car was stolen

584
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,480
Susanna, my car was stolen
I'm going to report it to the cops

585
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,400
Princess left so early

586
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,400
Don’t be biased against people

587
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,440
I'm just being prudent

588
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,680
Have some faith in mankind

589
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,920
My money's gone

590
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,120
See, I told you

591
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,760
I knew she's steal our money

592
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,040
Hiding your money in the drawer was dumb

593
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,880
I put mine in one of my shoes

594
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,400
Damn, she stole my money too

595
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,720
That's only fair

596
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,520
You shouldn't have let her stay over night

597
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,440
Did you try to stop me?

598
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,280
She's quite good at stealing

599
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,880
She left us some money though

600
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,080
I sure hope I run into her

601
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,760
Likewise here

602
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,840
What would you do?

603
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,760
See if she needs more

604
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,680
Do you know how to drive?

605
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,360
Do you have a license?

606
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,800
I'm terribly sorry.
I'll pay for the damages

607
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,440
That goes without saying

608
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,080
You've ruined my beautiful car

609
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,760
Please forgive me

610
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,200
Fortunately I'm a super-nice guy

611
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,240
It's dangerous to drive like that

612
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,680
My brother says I'm a reckless driver

613
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,120
I think he's quite right

614
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,520
This Dino Martini is my brother's car

615
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,760
You call him up.
He'll get your car fixed

616
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,720
But...

617
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,200
I've got to go to work

618
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,720
Call me. Let's have lunch

619
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,440
Sure

620
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,080
Thanks

621
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,160
Back up

622
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,440
Bye. Take care

623
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,240
Bye

624
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,120
Who's that?

625
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,560
What do you want?

626
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,760
To take you to a place

627
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,520
The police station?

628
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,480
You're not cops
And I don't know you

629
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,960
Where're you taking me to?

630
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,600
A place of wealth and comfort

631
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,120
What if I won't come along?

632
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,080
We'll be very rude then

633
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,760
Let me go. Help...

634
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,160
Help

635
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,760
Come on, get the broad

636
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,560
Let's split up

637
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,640
That's them

638
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,400
You are not bad
When will you be able to deliver

639
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,440
Wait, I got to ask you
You don't trust me or something?

640
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,200
You hire me
and you hire another gang to find the girl

641
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,560
What gang?

642
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,640
I should have asked that question

643
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,520
They were quite nasty too

644
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,720
I didn't hire another gang

645
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,480
Then why...

646
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,160
Stay out of that issue

647
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,720
Just don't let them capture Sylvia

648
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,280
Either you tell me who they are

649
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,000
So that I know what I'm up against

650
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,200
Or I quit

651
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,760
Stay there

652
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,240
I'm sorry for all your sufferings

653
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,600
But I can't be of help

654
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,800
I can only increase your expense money

655
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,200
You need time to think it over?

656
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,200
Three seconds

657
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,400
1, 2, 3. I'll carry on

658
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,120
Good. May God bless you

659
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,080
Thanks

660
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,400
Why would Moby want to meet us here?

661
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,080
He must be up to something again

662
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,680
We'd better say no to whatever he asks

663
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,760
Sit

664
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,120
Can't say no to that.

665
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,000
True

666
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,560
Something to drink?

667
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,600
3 beers, one bottle of brandy

668
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,520
How's business lately?

669
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,960
Worse than before

670
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,120
Did my friend do a good job on your van?

671
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,200
No, it's worse than before

672
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,960
How's David's father?

673
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,040
Worse than before

674
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,720
He can't get any worse

675
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,480
No
He's much better now

676
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,520
That's terrific. Here's the beers

677
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,520
To David's father

678
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,480
No

679
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,000
You can't say no to that. Cheers...

680
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,680
Our trick's not working

681
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,440
Let's play "mismatched answers"

682
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,200
I need a favor from you guys

683
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,120
I bumped into a girl's car this morning

684
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,280
No wonder Susanna's dog gave birth to 4 puppies

685
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,600
What does that have to do with my accident?

686
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,440
Why should we know about your accident?

687
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,400
Just let me finish it

688
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,280
After I had bumped into the girl's car
She gave me a card

689
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,000
Said that's her brother's car

690
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,680
Still nothing to do with us

691
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,160
When I contacted the guy
he said he had no sister

692
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,720
And claimed his car was stolen

693
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,480
When I described the girl to him

694
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,800
He said she might have been your girlfriend

695
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,280
Still none of our concern

696
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,000
True

697
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,360
But she gave me some money
and asked me to give to you

698
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,520
She's returning the money to us

699
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,960
Not returning, just giving

700
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,600
Giving? She stole that money from us

701
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,000
So you were her victims too

702
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,240
Still none of our concern?

703
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,520
Just give us our money
She hasn't given it to me yet

704
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,080
I'm going to dance a little

705
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,360
So am I

706
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,360
Tell me where does she hang around?

707
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,400
Her home

708
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,440
What place does she go everyday?

709
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,800
The lady's room

710
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,000
Come on, tell me the truth

711
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,480
The truth's I don't know

712
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,880
Be that way

713
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,160
Come on, tell me

714
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,760
You were quite rude just now

715
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,520
Forgive me then. Tell me please

716
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,600
We really don't know

717
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,320
Be that way

718
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,880
I thought you're friends

719
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,640
Fellow Chinese

720
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,120
All I'm asking is a small favor

721
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,240
And you don't even want to know

722
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,960
Of course you can hear me

723
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,200
What?

724
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,280
Spaniards are bad, but they are better than you

725
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,200
I can't hear you
Speak louder

726
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,960
Spaniards are bad...

727
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,440
Sorry, I'm way out of line

728
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,160
Is that what you want?

729
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,480
I wonder who Sylvia is?

730
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,280
A Spaniard

731
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,440
Bullshit
I mean why is she wanted

732
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,720
Because she's gorgeous

733
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,280
Stupid

734
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,680
She's not stupid. She's bright

735
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,280
You are though

736
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,560
Sylvia

737
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:07,520
David

738
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,960
Long time no see

739
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,880
Not really

740
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,160
They're forcing me against my will

741
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,080
Be nice to the lady

742
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,560
You kicked me?

743
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,040
What's up?

744
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,360
Ask them

745
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,280
A girl picked my wallet

746
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,560
These two are her accomplices

747
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,200
Don't run

748
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:08,120
She fooled us again
We can't trust her

749
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,600
You'd better remember that

750
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,360
I've never trusted her anyway

751
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,240
She got us into such complications

752
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,200
No need to over-react.

753
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,280
It's you!

754
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,120
Why are you here?

755
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,840
I came to thank you

756
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,440
for saving me from ending up in jail

757
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,880
If we knew why they were after you

758
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,280
We wouldn't have helped you

759
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,280
Tell her to stay

760
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,520
Weren't you saying...

761
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:33,520
Don't let her go

762
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:34,880
Don't go away

763
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,280
We want to ask you something

764
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,960
Come up and sit for a while

765
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,520
I'd like that very much

766
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,960
You want to ask her something

767
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,800
I think you should ask her

768
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,440
Me?

769
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,880
Go

770
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:57,920
What... would you like to drink?

771
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,520
Wine

772
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,520
I'll get that

773
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,160
Do it

774
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,200
You slept here last night

775
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:16,800
This morning we found that...

776
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,920
Everything was tidied up

777
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,040
But our money's gone

778
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:29,400
And so were you

779
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,840
Take a break. I'll ask her

780
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,720
David would really want to know

781
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,640
Did you steal our money?

782
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,280
Yes

783
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,200
And those men's too

784
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,080
Yes

785
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,680
Don't be so rude

786
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,560
You do the asking

787
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:54,640
You're so pretty, you can...

788
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,960
What he mean is

789
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,160
You can do well just being a hooker

790
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,960
I hate being called a hooker

791
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,560
I don't sell my body

792
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,560
I don't sleep with anyone for money

793
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,720
I'm just his interpreter

794
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,080
You should have slapped him

795
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,120
Stealing's still a vice

796
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:27,880
My mother's been put away since I was 14

797
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,640
I've been supporting myself since then

798
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,320
Nobody would give me any opportunity

799
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:43,400
All the men I met
No matter how good they treated me

800
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,520
They just wanted my body

801
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,560
That's what he wanted too

802
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,760
I stole their money

803
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:58,320
I see nothing wrong in that

804
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,640
Beware of pretty girls from now on

805
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,400
I warned you not to get involved

806
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,440
You two are different

807
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,120
I know you're real nice to me

808
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:15,680
I'll pay you back as soon as I can

809
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,440
No real hurry. I just want to now the truth

810
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,840
Pay him first when you've got the money

811
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,120
He needs that for his wedding

812
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,240
Nonsense. I was only saving for emergencies

813
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,080
You'd better pay me then

814
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,040
Let's don't argue about this
Just make sure the money's legal

815
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,520
Thomas mentioned to me
You mum and my Dad are very close

816
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,760
We can’t just let you carry on stealing

817
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:39,640
Right

818
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,880
He's afraid of you might like stealing though

819
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,160
Nobody'd like to be a criminal

820
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,240
Unless he had no other choices

821
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,000
And if you did have other choices?

822
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,040
I'd start all over again

823
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,080
It's great

824
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,760
David, didn't you say we're understaffed?

825
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,760
No, I didn't

826
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,480
Oh, yes, but...

827
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,520
You may not last

828
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,440
I'd like to have a shot at it

829
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,200
You're on probation for 3 month, a raise is given

830
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,880
<i>Pedestrians pacing</i>

831
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,840
<i>Yet I'm rushing</i>

832
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,800
<i>Passion is filling my heart</i>

833
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,480
<i>Whenever I'm depressed</i>

834
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:52,120
<i>I fall</i>

835
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:55,240
<i>I believe I could stand up again</i>

836
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,680
<i>Although It's painstaking</i>

837
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,520
<i>I'll still be smiling</i>

838
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,040
<i>All because of faith</i>

839
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,920
<i>I try my best and</i>

840
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,240
<i>I'm getting closer to my dream</i>

841
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,720
<i>With faith. I'm free to pursue my dream</i>

842
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,080
<i>With you be with me, I'll be even stronger</i>

843
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,720
<i>I'm here to find myself</i>

844
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:31,760
<i>Happiness, I'm coming for you</i>

845
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,880
How are you...

846
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,880
I need to talk to you

847
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,480
Come with me

848
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,240
What do you want?

849
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,400
Listen to me first

850
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,040
I'm not after my wallet

851
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,520
I want you to meet someone

852
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,600
You'll benefit tremendously from the meeting

853
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,520
Would you come?

854
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:26,520
Help!

855
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,400
Don't yell

856
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,080
I mean no harm

857
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,720
I'm a private detective

858
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,160
Just come with me to see this man

859
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,360
And I'll owe you one, okay?

860
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,040
Trust me

861
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,600
Don't get rough

862
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,200
And I'll let go, okay?

863
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,520
I grew up on the streets

864
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,200
You can’t just con me like that

865
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,480
Don't waste your time

866
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:18,880
Where's he?

867
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,040
Over there

868
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:21,720
Miss

869
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,520
Don't come over. I'll throw it to you

870
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,240
Thank you

871
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,360
Let me tip you off

872
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,600
Sylvia's in great danger

873
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,040
Trust me or you'll regret it

874
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:39,720
I'm borrowing your stool

875
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:40,800
Over there. There

876
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:41,600
What should we do now?

877
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,560
Pack up for the day

878
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,360
Stay there

879
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,240
Let me go

880
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:11,680
Set me free

881
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:12,680
Let her go.

882
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:13,920
Don't come near

883
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,520
Come on

884
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,280
Get in

885
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,120
After them

886
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,080
That's my car. Stop...

887
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,880
Floor it. They're closing in

888
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,560
I can't stand this.

889
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,680
Come and sit here

890
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,000
Like hell I will.

891
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:12,200
Go sit in the back seat

892
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,640
Back off... hurry

893
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,840
You must be out of your mind

894
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,640
Luckily I've got a great car

895
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,600
Otherwise I'd have been dead

896
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,000
Slow down. Be careful next time

897
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:04,920
It's a dead end

898
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:05,760
Up the ramp

899
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,480
Hang on

900
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,000
You're great
They aren't behind us anymore

901
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,080
I know. But they're in front of us

902
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,440
Let's see who has more guts

903
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,720
Excuse me
Time to use my weapons

904
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,480
Ready, aim, fire

905
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,040
I'll have some fun too

906
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,280
Some oil for you

907
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,240
This will enhance your ride

908
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,000
How about a ramp

909
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:30,520
How are we doing?

910
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,960
The enemies are all wiped out

911
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,080
You guys can't even grab a girl

912
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,760
There can only be one explanation

913
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:05,640
You guys are useless

914
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,880
You've wasted 6 out of my 14 days

915
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,000
God created the world in 6 days

916
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,080
8 days should be more than enough to grab a girl

917
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:22,400
I am whether able to inherit the Count's legacy

918
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,200
It's all counting on you two

919
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,120
Who do you...

920
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,360
You first

921
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,760
Who are those people?

922
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,200
Your turn

923
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,440
You told my mind

924
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,080
They tried to grab me before.

925
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:43,760
True

926
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,440
Moby?

927
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,600
You'd have been dead if I had a gun

928
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:51,920
Couldn't I have ducked?

929
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:56,760
They'll keep coming after Sylvia

930
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:57,840
Until they've got her

931
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,320
Who are they?

932
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,240
Bad guys

933
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,480
How do you know?

934
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,120
Because I'm the good guy

935
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,280
Tell me the whole story

936
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:08,160
It's a simple story that turned complicated

937
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,800
There are 2 parties

938
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,280
Those guys, and me

939
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,320
I'm officially looking for Sylvia

940
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,000
Those guys want to kidnap her

941
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,600
I want to deliver Sylvia to my client

942
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,800
I don't know why they want to kidnap her

943
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,080
I'm getting very confused

944
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,800
I wish you hadn't explained it

945
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,560
You should know why your client wants me

946
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,120
Yes, I should

947
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:37,520
But since my client didn't tell me

948
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,080
I really don't know

949
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:44,320
Detective Moby
Can you tell me something you do know?

950
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,680
I can tell you two

951
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,920
Firstly, this place's dangerous

952
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,000
Do you smell gas?

953
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,480
No, but you’d better trust me

954
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:56,640
Secondly, if Sylvia wants to know
why I come for her

955
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,200
It's better for her to come with me to meet my client

956
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,000
I know one thing too.

957
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:00,840
What?

958
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:04,640
We've got the dumbest private detective
in our home

959
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:08,000
Don't you dare insulting me

960
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,840
We don't want you insulted

961
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,360
But how long have you been a private detective?

962
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:13,800
6 days

963
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,680
That's not even one full week

964
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,680
We'd be stupid if we trusted you

965
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:26,960
Okay, please stop
You've both insulted me and broke my heart

966
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,360
Moby, don't let them in

967
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,360
We'll leave from the balcony

968
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Moby, we're leaving

969
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,360
Come on, hurry. Okay

970
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:52,640
Come on

971
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,240
Moby, run

972
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:01,120
Hurry

973
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,200
Go...

974
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,520
Why are we running?

975
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:13,760
They're trying to grab Sylvia

976
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,840
And there's nothing we can do?

977
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,240
Can't we stop them?

978
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,320
They've got 6 guys

979
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,800
We're used to deal with numbers

980
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,160
This is no time for bragging

981
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,880
Let me and David prove ourselves

982
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,960
Stay with Sylvia

983
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,360
They're tough. They're super-tough

984
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,120
We'd better run

985
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:15,880
Come on...

986
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,600
What place is this?

987
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,640
Headquarters of filth

988
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,720
That's a dead end

989
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,840
What should we do now?

990
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,720
Find a place to hide

991
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:56,960
Who got a torch?

992
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,800
I've got one

993
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,120
Kid's stuff

994
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:11,800
Eyeball them carefully

995
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,160
It stinks here

996
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,640
Just be patient

997
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,480
We couldn't find them

998
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:58,760
But I saw they coming in here

999
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:16,680
Much better now

1000
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,320
I can't stand this any more

1001
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:23,000
Be patient, or we'll be dead

1002
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,280
I can't stand the stink

1003
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,440
That Fatso

1004
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,080
You've reined everything

1005
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:33,200
Run

1006
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,200
Money for everyone

1007
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:52,520
Move over

1008
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,400
They can't be too far away

1009
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,720
What do you want? I'm an easy guy

1010
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:45,920
I'm glad to hear that

1011
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,240
How can I help you?

1012
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,240
Someone hired us to push you down
You can do it yourself

1013
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,280
You've got the wrong man.

1014
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,160
No

1015
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,360
Who hired you?

1016
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:56,400
I did

1017
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:58,720
Sylvia?

1018
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,200
You want me kidnapped

1019
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,640
I want you dead. Push him down

1020
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,040
Please don't...

1021
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,240
Help...

1022
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,840
Please don't... Help...

1023
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,160
I'm your father...

1024
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:15,640
He's your father?

1025
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:18,960
You're my father?

1026
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:23,680
No... I'm not your father
I'm your father's butler

1027
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,920
You'd better tell me the whole story

1028
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,240
Your father's Count Lobas

1029
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,080
Gloria is your mother
She used to work in his castle

1030
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,160
One night, while the Countess was out

1031
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:36,840
The Count raped Gloria

1032
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:40,160
After Gloria pregnant

1033
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,440
He sent her away

1034
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,400
Son of a bitch

1035
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,360
But he's your father

1036
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,640
I hate him. I don't want to see him

1037
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,920
He's dead

1038
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:58,920
Before he die
He wanted you and your mother to be found

1039
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:02,240
So that his brother Mondale wouldn't inherit the legacy

1040
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,920
I didn't tell this story earlier

1041
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,280
For fear of endangering you

1042
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:09,560
That's why I hired an unknown private detective

1043
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,920
I'm glad Moby's not here

1044
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:13,800
Of course I am

1045
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:15,440
I sure am lucky

1046
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:18,320
I always barge in at the wrong time

1047
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:21,400
And hear things I don't want to hear

1048
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,480
I sure hired the right guy

1049
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:28,120
According to the family's tradition
Gloria and Sylvia have to appear within 14 days

1050
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:33,120
Or else Mondale will inherit the legacy

1051
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,080
Those must be Mondale's men

1052
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:37,960
Only 3 days left

1053
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,240
Where are you going?

1054
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:44,160
We've been helping Sylvia because she's been helpless

1055
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,520
But now she's the daughter of a count

1056
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,640
You mean...

1057
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:56,200
If Sylvia's an orphan

1058
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,520
You can be friends

1059
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,720
But not if she's a count's daughter

1060
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,160
We really wanted to help her

1061
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:08,480
Then don't you know
Now's the time she needs most help

1062
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,040
Don't you want her to lead a better life?

1063
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,320
We do, but you can help her

1064
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,560
I'm just one man

1065
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,840
You've seen Mondale's men

1066
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,320
They wouldn't quit now

1067
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,120
If you're real friends of Sylvia

1068
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,600
You wouldn't leave her now

1069
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,760
Okay, Okay...
You don't have to rub it in

1070
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:31,440
Let's plan to get Gloria out

1071
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,040
What're you staring at? I'll kill you
What're you staring at

1072
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:47,680
I'll kill you
Don't come over

1073
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:49,920
I'll kill...

1074
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,160
I'll kill you...

1075
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:59,040
Let me go! Get in

1076
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,120
Let me go! What do you want?

1077
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:05,800
Done

1078
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,000
Let me go

1079
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:13,640
That's too risky. People may find out

1080
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,880
Siren off

1081
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,960
Mum and David's Dad are dancing over there

1082
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,160
What's up?

1083
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,000
Your Dad's dancing over there

1084
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,280
We've got a nut here

1085
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,880
Is he eating or speaking?

1086
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,120
I hate guessing games

1087
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,680
I'm not a nut. I'm normal

1088
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,240
Please unite me

1089
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:14,760
Are you really as normal as we are?

1090
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:15,800
Yes

1091
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,600
Ask her a question to see if she's normal

1092
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,480
Right. Listen well

1093
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,160
There's 3 bugs lining up and crawling towards

1094
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,800
The first bug says, "I have two bugs after me."

1095
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:31,280
The last bug says, "There're two bugs before me."

1096
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,240
But the one in the middle says,
"There's no bugs before me."

1097
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:35,520
"None after me."

1098
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,240
Do you know why?

1099
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,920
It's blind

1100
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:39,840
No

1101
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,760
Then I got no clue

1102
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,280
Why do you give him such a difficult question?

1103
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,280
Is it really difficult?

1104
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:49,880
Yes

1105
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,640
Why the bug said that?

1106
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,760
"No bugs before me and none after me"

1107
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,960
Because he's lying!

1108
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:01,320
How would a bug ever lie?

1109
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,960
Who tied you up?

1110
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,480
That's a secret

1111
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,800
Come near me and I'll tell you

1112
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,840
Don't tell me anybody else

1113
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,040
That's why I had to play crazy

1114
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,400
What did he tell you?

1115
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,440
Not to tell anybody else

1116
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:26,680
I'm your buddy, tell me

1117
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,040
I told you already

1118
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,360
Speak up

1119
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,000
You hit me all the time. Don't you bully me

1120
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,000
Don't go away

1121
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,440
Now I'm really stuck

1122
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,800
What did you tell him?

1123
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:50,720
Why should I tell you?

1124
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,600
Tell me and I'll unite you

1125
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,800
I don't trust you

1126
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,160
You promised to tell me

1127
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,120
I told him not to tell anybody else

1128
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,720
What's there to tell though?

1129
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:17,600
We like it here. We don't want to go out

1130
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:25,840
What are you waiting for? Let's go

1131
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:26,800
Not yet

1132
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:30,400
They don't want to leave this place

1133
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,160
Tell your Dad you want to marry Sylvia

1134
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,160
He has to go our for the ceremony

1135
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,920
One shouldn't lie to one's father

1136
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,920
One has to be flexible

1137
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,480
Go tell him

1138
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:54,280
I'll tell him

1139
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,520
Why don't you two leave here and get married?

1140
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:07,440
Why haven't I thought of that?

1141
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:08,920
Are you crazy?

1142
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:09,960
Are you object?

1143
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:12,240
No

1144
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,520
Nobody objects

1145
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,520
Gloria, will you marry me?

1146
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:22,680
What took you so long?

1147
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:26,920
Congratulations

1148
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,600
Sylvia will be your sister soon

1149
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,080
You're not pleased about that?

1150
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:36,280
Call him brother

1151
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:39,120
Brother

1152
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,160
There's a solution to every problem

1153
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:49,280
Just deny that he's your father

1154
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,160
Good idea

1155
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:54,760
Finally

1156
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,360
What's this monster doing here?

1157
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:03,760
I don't know

1158
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,800
I guess we'll have to find out

1159
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,400
Should I go?

1160
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,880
Or maybe you should go

1161
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:15,680
All you should say is please

1162
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:26,600
What?

1163
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:31,240
You sure aren't that bright

1164
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:38,880
Moby...

1165
01:19:59,120 --> 01:19:59,840
Are you okay?

1166
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:01,120
Not really

1167
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:09,800
Why do you hit my son?

1168
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,000
Let go...

1169
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Quite!

1170
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:42,880
Get it out of the way

1171
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:51,000
Back it up.

1172
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:52,600
I don't have the keys

1173
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:53,920
Push it away

1174
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,280
You do that

1175
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,720
He's right
To get into the castle isn't difficult

1176
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,800
To do it unnoticed is hard

1177
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,000
Come on

1178
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:22,320
If you want to get in
I've at least 7 ways to do so

1179
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,800
Why 7 and not 6 or 8?

1180
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,560
7 is my lucky number

1181
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,720
We only need one that works

1182
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:36,000
Unfortunately that's not among my 7

1183
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,040
I'll go in from the rear

1184
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,400
Guards are usually quite careless

1185
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:42,680
I'll go in from the front

1186
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,480
That's dangerous

1187
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,840
What about you?

1188
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,680
I don't like either of your plans

1189
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,440
We sure are an unorganized bunch

1190
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,920
No, just an unorganized three

1191
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:51,680
You're really terrible

1192
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:09,800
Go down now if you have guts

1193
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:16,160
I don't have any

1194
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:31,160
How will you get in?

1195
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,080
Through the door

1196
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:34,400
It's guarded.

1197
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,160
I'll wait

1198
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,480
Till dawn?

1199
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,200
Let's climb trees

1200
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,840
Elephants can't climb trees

1201
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:49,760
Go ahead and wait

1202
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:54,040
Stop playing, meal time

1203
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:14,080
Don't argue

1204
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:18,520
That would have been a home run

1205
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:30,240
Hide them up

1206
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,640
I've got some good news

1207
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,120
Someone's here to save you

1208
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:49,520
But the bad news is he's caught

1209
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:56,840
How are you

1210
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,240
Don't be rude to my guest

1211
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,720
Give him the seat

1212
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:03,640
Thank you. Cheers

1213
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,080
Cheers...

1214
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:12,720
What now?

1215
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:13,640
Let's hit the sack

1216
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,680
Are you crazy?
Let's find a way to save her!

1217
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:18,280
Why do you have to ask?

1218
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:46,800
Come up here

1219
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:48,560
Like hell I will.

1220
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:49,760
But I weren't you

1221
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,880
Think of a way yourself

1222
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:25,840
It's me.

1223
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,160
I know

1224
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,280
But you kicked me

1225
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:31,280
I kicked you but you dared not scream

1226
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:32,400
That's how I knew it's you

1227
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,320
We'd better split up

1228
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:04,760
What are you doing up there?

1229
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,360
Are you guests for the party?

1230
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,400
Yes

1231
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:22,560
I told you don't come

1232
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:23,920
You almost screwed everything up

1233
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,680
We're guests for the party

1234
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:43,000
What a match between the movements

1235
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:44,560
Does that mean I look very classical?

1236
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,240
Sit down, Mum

1237
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,520
I'm quite hungry

1238
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,120
We've got one more dinner guest

1239
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:04,000
Why don't you present yourself properly?

1240
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:09,160
I'm sorry I'm late

1241
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,240
What's the main course for tonight?

1242
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:14,800
Roast lamb

1243
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:19,320
I was born in the year of the lamb

1244
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:22,840
May be that's a good omen

1245
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:26,080
I'm really honored tonight

1246
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,600
To have so many guests

1247
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,920
This is an important night for me

1248
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:33,760
To the Lobas family

1249
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,960
Tonight's a disgraceful night

1250
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:38,960
To have you two in the family

1251
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:40,800
That's disgraceful

1252
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:42,680
Don't upset yourself

1253
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:48,000
Mr. Mondale
If people found out you kidnapped Sylvia

1254
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,600
Your reputation'd be jeopardized

1255
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:54,520
Thanks for reminding me

1256
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:57,320
I don't see it as a problem

1257
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:08,240
Cardi, entertain them.

1258
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:09,120
Yes

1259
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:10,560
Put the girls in the dungeon.

1260
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:11,560
Yes

1261
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,680
I haven't finished my soup yet

1262
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:30,800
Reinforcement

1263
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:12,000
Hang in there. He's not that tough

1264
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,880
You take care of him

1265
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,160
Come on...

1266
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,960
I'll tackle him, get the girls

1267
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:37,880
Can you handle him?

1268
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:39,520
No, but you can.

1269
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:40,840
Come on

1270
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:45,880
Dirty tricks

1271
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:58,440
This one's tough

1272
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,720
Don't panic, relax

1273
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:06,280
Take it as a training session

1274
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:17,320
Another round

1275
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:51,040
Wait

1276
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:59,120
1,2,3,42,2,3,4

1277
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:32,400
You're good

1278
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:41,080
Got you

1279
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:49,280
I should have trained more

1280
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:25,080
What a hit!

1281
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:14,880
Pull me up for another round

1282
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:18,640
Don't let go. Pull me up please

1283
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:56,840
You're still fighting

1284
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:58,400
I'm waiting for you

1285
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:06,480
3 musketeers

1286
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:07,720
Do the impossible

1287
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:09,240
Upper half

1288
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:11,800
Lower half

1289
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:16,800
Chinese firedrill

1290
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:23,960
Invincible

1291
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:33,120
How are you?

1292
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:34,560
What would you like?

1293
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,320
One burger and a coke

1294
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:37,880
Have a seat over there

1295
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:44,600
David, thinking of Sylvia again?

1296
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:51,640
David, come here

1297
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:53,440
What's up?

1298
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:54,400
Look

1299
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:22,120
Dropping in on us?

1300
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:24,800
Would you hire me for the summer?

1301
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:25,640
Of course

1302
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:29,160
Make a wish that summer never ends

1303
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:31,520
Hi there

1304
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:33,880
Moby the private eye

1305
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:38,640
I've got my private detective license

1306
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:40,320
I'm now legitimate

1307
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:42,200
Congratulations

1308
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,480
Do you want to make some money?

1309
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,200
I've got another assignment for you

1310
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:48,600
You'll be rich

1311
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:50,360
Another castle?

1312
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:52,400
No, a hut this time

1313
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:54,400
Who are we saving?

1314
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:56,360
A black president

1315
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:59,360
He's been kidnapped by some African cannibals

1316
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:04,080
Cannibals...

1317
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:05,320
Someone's looking for you
