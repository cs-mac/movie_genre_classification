228
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,135
     I've got something far more
     dangerous than that.       

229
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:07,071
Is it a whistle that you blow   
to summon the real police       

230
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,907
when a crime                    
is being committed?             

231
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,175
No. It's actually a pen.        

232
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:14,379
And, with it,                   
I can deny your parole.         

233
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:17,382
So why don't you shut the hell  
up and follow my lead?          

234
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,219
Where's the fucking painting,   
fucko?                          

235
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,189
Whoa.                           

236
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:28,693
My name is Agent Bick. This is  
my associate, Samuel Winter.    

237
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,462
[Nicky] I know Sam.             

238
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,197
Sam, what are you doing         
with Dirty Harry, here?         

239
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,600
          You know how they pair
          professional athletes 

240
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,402
- with slow kids?               
- Yep.                          

241
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,170
It's kind of like that.         

242
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,541
    Two weeks ago, this painting
    "Model, Rear-View"          

243
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:47,011
by Georges Seurat was stolen by 
an art collector in Mexico City 

244
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,579
by a woman we had               
under surveillance.             

245
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:51,716
Yeah, I've never seen           
that woman before...            

246
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,184
...before yesterday.            

247
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,553
         Do I look like         
         a fucking clown to you?

248
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:59,023
Clowns try to be funny. You're  
just unintentionally hysterical.

249
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:03,361
- [laughs]                      
- Shut your giggle hole         
and open the damn case.         

250
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:07,598
It's called "Tio Puno Loco".    

251
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,301
Which translates                
"Uncle Crazy Fist."             

252
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,438
Now, if you gentlemen           
will excuse me, I've got        
to water ski...                 

253
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,975
Sit down! Winter,               
this is not "pointerism".       

254
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,377
Every painting tells a story.   

255
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,280
All good art tells a story.     

256
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,315
This one tells two.             

257
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,319
 <i>[Sam] Say Nicky here</i>           
 <i>is stopped at Customs.</i>         

258
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,490
 <i>All they see is this rubbish,</i>  

259
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,360
not the masterpiece underneath. 

260
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:39,163
 <i>Acetate solution loosens</i>       
 <i>the top acrylic layer.</i>         

261
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:45,136
 <i>Peel it on back and you're</i>     
 <i>left with the original</i>         
 <i>oil painting underneath.</i>       

262
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:48,039
[Bick] What the fuck is that?   

263
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:52,710
It's a marvelous picture.       
I'm delighted to have it as     
part of my collection.          

264
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:58,449
Well, boys,                     
have a nice day.                

265
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,318
Where's the Seurat?!            

266
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,388
Long gone.                      

267
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,757
[up-tempo music]                

268
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,028
- Sunny.                        
- Yeah. How'd it go?            

269
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,496
Ah, it went.                    

270
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:14,065
Bad luck, chief.                

271
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,736
You got the money?              

272
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,372
There you go.                   

273
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,575
It feels a little light.        

274
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,077
    Well, why don't you open it?

275
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,213
"I'm sorry.                     

276
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,682
I'm sorry for hitting you       
with a lead pipe."              

277
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,718
What the fuck...                
[grunts]                        

278
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,587
[music continues]               

279
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,090
[indistinct chattering]         

280
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,299
Crunch, honey,                  
we're out of ice.               

281
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,701
[Crunch] Oh yeah, all right.    

282
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,572
Thank you, Crunchie.            

283
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,673
                  Adios, fellas.

284
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,242
Ice? $50 for ice?               

285
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,544
It's wintertime.                

286
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:01,579
Crunch, she's, she's not        
even trying anymore.            

287
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,648
Happy wife,                     
happy life, right?              

288
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,349
So you say.                     

289
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,819
Oh, I don't know, Francie.      

290
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:11,622
When I was a young buck         
I thought I'd make history,     

291
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:15,193
not just sit there              
reading about it.               

292
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,198
Hell, I thought                 
I'd be a great man.             

293
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,500
OK, so you're not...            

294
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:26,304
stereotypically great,          
like Alexander the Great.       

295
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:31,309
But you're great like,          
great like, like...             

296
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:32,844
             You're a great guy!

297
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:36,481
Great men don't take dives      
for a couple of hundred bucks.  

298
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,586
And great men                   
don't miss their fate.          

299
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:45,223
Somewhere along the line I...   

300
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:48,192
I missed mine, Francie.         

301
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:51,262
I was probably staring at       
it the whole time and I just... 

302
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,565
I missed it.                    

303
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:01,405
My God, you're a downer.        
A fuckin' boner killer.         

304
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:04,442
   And what are you going to do?
   Are you gonna sell fuckin'   
   insurance or something?      

305
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:07,812
           Just shut the fuck up
           and cheer up, please.

306
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,647
[door bell]                     

307
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,649
                       Allow me.

308
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,520
             Yo, Dennis Calhoun?

309
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:17,688
Who's asking?                   

310
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,458
- It's fuckin' Sunny.           
- Sounds about right.           

311
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,429
Hey, Crunch, there's some       
guy with an eye-patch here      
to see you.                     

312
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,776
[grunts]                        

313
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,548
[grunting] Oh, easy, man!       

314
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,850
Where's your fuckin' brother?   

315
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,619
I was gonna cut bait            
and go home then I realized     
Nicky said he had a brother.    

316
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:52,323
[people chattering]             

317
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,892
- [grunting]                    
- Oww. Fuck!                    

318
00:19:56,562 --> 00:20:01,465
         Sweet Baby Jesus.      
         What are you, a pirate?

319
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,403
Hey, hey, hey. Look! I don't    
know where Nicky is, all right. 

320
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,572
- He said you work with him.    
- Yeah, a long time ago.        

321
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:10,308
Now, look, I got like $300      
stashed in the bedroom there.   

322
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,244
It's yours. A guy in your       
line of work might              
prefer doubloons...             

323
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:14,412
       I'm not a fuckin' pirate!

324
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,814
[muffled shouting]              

325
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,649
I don't even talk to Nicky.     
I hate him.                     

326
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:21,352
             Here's what's what.
             I want the 30 grand

327
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,521
- or I want that                
fuckin' painting.               
- What painting?                

328
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:24,689
                     The Seurat.

329
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,357
Whoa! Whoa! What?               

330
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,658
- The Seurat!                   
- What?                         

331
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,428
             The Georges Seurat,
             you ignorant fuck! 

332
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,630
         The seminal French     
         "Post-Impressionalist".

333
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,298
      The father of pointillism.

334
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,767
            That Georges Seurat,
            you fuckin' baboon. 

335
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,270
        Now I want the 30 grand,

336
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:40,504
                    the painting

337
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,840
             or a bullet in your
             fucking head!      

338
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,344
[knock at door]                 

339
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:48,312
- [Francie, muffled] Hey, uh... 
- [flushes toilet]              

340
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:51,015
- Crunch, is everything OK?     
- [Crunch] Yeah.                

341
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:53,818
What... what's happening,       
exactly?                        

342
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,388
- Nothing.

 <i>tried to smuggle a brick of</i>    
 <i>hash along with the Gospel.</i>    

456
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:14,264
So they arrest our man,         
put the Gospel in storage       

457
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:17,167
and have an expert coming       
in on Saturday.                 

458
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:21,972
But any expert's gonna look at  
that Gospel and know it's the   
Guttenberg original.            

459
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,241
Which means the Gospel          
According to James              

460
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:27,778
 <i>is gonna be put under so many</i>  
 <i>locks and so many keys</i>         

461
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:33,150
that Julius Friedman will never 
 <i>catch a whiff of it again.</i>     

462
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,688
We get the Bible,               
we take it to Detroit.          

463
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,957
We collect one and a half       
million dollars.                

464
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,726
And that, laddiekins, is that.  

465
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,067
Well, you're shittin' me, right?

466
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:53,971
First off, I ain't ever heard of
this Gospel According to Jimmy. 

467
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:59,243
And number two, we're not       
equipped to rob an international
border station.                 

468
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:03,847
Look! There's guards.           
There's cameras everywhere.     

469
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:07,117
This would take, like,          
months of planning and skill    
sets we just don't possess!     

470
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:10,020
Forget it! We're not            
the A-Team here, guys.          

471
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:13,424
I'd peg us at a D-minus         
for this kind of thing.         

472
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,960
I thought you had something,    
Paddy.                          

473
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,397
- I'm out.                      
- Hey, Crunch...                

474
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,000
- Leave him, lad.               
- I got him.                    

475
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:25,302
Let's go, boy.                  

476
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:28,839
[Bick] Sir, I'm telling you,    
it's happening.                 

477
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:31,175
 <i>- [man over phone]</i>             
 <i>What's happening?</i>              
<i>- Paddy's here, Nicky's here</i>    

478
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:34,445
and they all just happened      
to converge in the city         
where Crunch lives?             

479
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:36,714
And Crunch, we know he's        
desperate for money.            

480
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:38,248
Sir, this is                    
all about the Seurat.           

481
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,218
So I need you to authorize eyes 
on every entry point            

482
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,220
into the country within         
a half a day's travel.          

483
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,223
I need a full surveillance kit, 
I need manpower                 
and I need a gun.               

484
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:49,960
 <i>- Look, there's no fuckin' way</i> 
 <i>you're getting a firearm.</i>      
<i>- OK. No gun.</i>                   

485
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,430
Come on! Hold up!               

486
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:55,432
          Let's take it down,   
          you're a little testy.

487
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:57,768
Yeah, well, jail                
will do that to a man.          

488
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,205
Let me add that "Polish Prison" 
isn't quite as hilarious        
as it sounds.                   

489
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:03,240
                Whoa! Pardon me.

490
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,843
I can't believe                 
you're still doin' that.        

491
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:06,977
- What?                         
- That.                         

492
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,846
Eh, keeps me sharp.             

493
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:10,914
               Listen... [sighs]

494
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,785
     Bottom line is, I know that
     you're hard up for cash.   

495
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:17,254
             And let's just say,
             hypothetically,    

496
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,791
          I feel bad and I wanna
          make it up to you.    

497
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:23,994
             So we do this thing
             with Paddy         

498
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:26,497
and I cut you in                
for ten percent on my end.      

499
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:30,033
    A sort of "Sorry for fucking
    you over" money. Huh?       

500
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,503
Oh. Hi, little girl.            
What's your name?               

501
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:35,773
- Robin.                        
- Oh yeah? Very cute.           

502
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:40,177
Everything out of               
your mouth is nothin'.          

503
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:43,013
- How could you say that?       
- Gee, I don't know.            

504
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:46,283
Maybe 'cause you just knocked   
over a nine-year-old little     
Chinese girl.                   

505
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,485
There's supposed to be          
a code, Nicky!                  

506
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:51,288
You never prey upon             
the virtuous or the poor.       

507
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,323
You never put the paycheck      
over your honor.                

508
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,325
And you never,                  
ever betray your family!        

509
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,961
Sure, maybe it's all            
just horseshit                  

510
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,330
that we feed ourselves          
so we can go to sleep at night. 

511
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:02,833
Maybe it's horseshit so that    
we can fancy ourselves          

512
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:05,536
a cut above the thugs and       
the gangsters of the world.     

513
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:07,538
But I bought into that          
horseshit, Nicky!               

514
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,074
And you, you just trample       
all over that horseshit.        

515
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:14,845
And you just, now you,          
you got shit all over your,     
your boots, you know.           

516
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:17,047
You, you just... you,           
you got shitty boots.           

517
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,582
              Hey, the analogy's
              breaking down.    

518
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:20,184
Yeah, maybe a little.           
You know what I fuckin' mean.   

519
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:21,451
   Hey, what's a fella got to do

520
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:22,920
        to make amends with you?

521
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,188
The only thing I trust about you

522
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,223
is you'll be a greedy,          
snaky motherfucker              

523
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:28,492
- the second you see an angle.  
- There is no angle.            

524
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,294
There's always                  
an angle with you, man.         

525
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:32,963
You're always hedging,          
you're always working it.       

526
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:36,834
You think this is               
about money, Crunch?            

527
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:38,569
Well, I got news for you.       

528
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:43,273
Think again.                    

529
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:46,310
Gotta be a cheaper              
way to do this.                 

530

 <i> Now tell me, baby</i>            
 <i>Tell me </i>

 <i> What kind Of man are you? </i>   

532
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:55,285
Just because he says he's sorry 
doesn't make him a changed man. 

533
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:59,323
Like just 'cause you            
like being drunk doesn't        
make you an alcoholic.          

534
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:00,624
Ah, shit. Lola. Lola.

Babe. Yeah. Hey.                

536
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:07,431
Go. I need                      
to talk to Crunch.              

537
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,435

doin' with him?                 

538
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:13,537
Nicky told                      
me you were out.                

539
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,572
- Yeah.                         
- I told him you're back in.    

540
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,007
[Crunch] Forget it.             
This thing smells.              

541
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,942
Crunch! We need the money.      

542
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:21,011
How are we gonna                
pay our bills?                  

543
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,913
Wow! She's good.                

544
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:26,583
Oh. So, so you                  
made her do this?               

545
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,919
          No. Crunch needs this.

546
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:31,121
                    He needs me.

547
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:33,957
        It's a brother thing.   
        You wouldn't understand.

548
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:36,660
Oh. Well, what I                
understand is that,             

549
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:40,030
that's my guy and               
he doesn't need you.            

550
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:45,135
 Well, he needs someone to stop 
 him from taking dives for $800.

551
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,107
Take care.                      

552
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,222
      All right. I'll do it.    
      But this one we do my way.

       What did ya have in mind?

 I told the Reverend everything 
 I know for twice that.

678
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:07,951
           There's no way       
           that's a coincidence.

679
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,686
That can't be a coincidence.    

680
00:38:09,688 --> 00:38:11,588
What do we do?                  
What's the play?                

681
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,390
- I'll talk to him.             
- No.                           

682
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:14,724
           He'll talk to me.    
           He won't talk to you.

683
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:15,725
I said no!                      

684
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:18,028
        Interpol's a real thing?

685
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:21,398
I'm not going to cut            
my fuckin' leg off.             

686
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,066
- Five minutes.                 
- Get outta here, Francie.      

687
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:24,868
- Crunch... Yeah, OK.           
- Now.                          

688
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:33,043
- Crunch.                       
- Sam?                          

689
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:38,481
              Men of our vintage
              should be retired.

690
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:42,852
You know, when I heard you were 
working for the other side,     

691
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:46,356
I just couldn't                 
believe it.                     

692
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:49,092
At least tell me they don't     
make you wear a wire.           

693
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:52,095
No. They don't make me          
wear a wire.                    

694
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:56,599
And I get to see                
some fine art.                  

695
00:38:56,601 --> 00:39:00,937
 So... what do you think they're
 talking about down there?      

696
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,874
Still about the art, huh?       

697
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:06,810
       My mother got me into it.

698
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:11,715
         We were always hard up,
         but she did her best.  

699
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:14,484
             Worked as a barmaid
             between kids.      

700
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,121
           When I was ten or 11,

701
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:22,392
          she took me to        
          the V and A in London.

702
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:26,129
             And I saw an object
             that blew my mind. 

703
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:32,902
It was a drinking cup fashioned 
from a single piece of jade.    

704
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:37,874
             It was just a cup, 
             but it was perfect.

705
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:41,544
         And it made me look at 
         everything differently.

706
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:46,816
   Turner, Monet, Vermeer,      
   those guys kept my eyes open.

707
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:48,685
         It was a feeling I had,

708
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:52,155
             a completeness when
             art touched me.    

709
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:59,529
          I only started getting
          into trouble when I   
          wanted to possess it. 

710
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:05,101
           And you...           
           what makes you do it?

711
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:06,503
Money.                          

712
00:40:06,505 --> 00:40:09,639
   Well, at least you're honest.

713
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:12,542
It's always nice to know...     

714
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,912
...who you can trust.           

715
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,415
I'm gonna find this painting.   

716
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:22,786
 Not because I want to get      
 you or your brother in trouble.

717
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:25,989
         I just want to hold it.

718
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:32,429
      Let me ask you a question.

719
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:34,464
        You ever seen the inside
        of Sing-Sing?           

720
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:37,066
   - I haven't.                 
   - 'Cause I know a lot of guys

721
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:40,103
          who would like to     
          fuck you inside there.

722
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:44,073
Are you hitting on me?          

723
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,844
                       I will...

724
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:49,446
                           Fuck!

725
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:52,081
It's been a breath of fresh air.

726
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,150
Looking good, Sam.              

727
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,724
    Interpol? Fucking Interpol?!

728
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:04,961
I'm not going to fuckin' prison!
I'm not cut out for that shit!  

729
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,863
You see these fuckin' arms,     
man?                            

730
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:10,200
These wet noodles will prevent  
very few prison rapes.          

731
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:12,535
Francie, I promise              
you on my mother's eyes,        

732
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:14,938
- you're gonna be fine.         
- You don't know that.          

733
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:19,476
You gotta trust me. Look, ever  
since I've been back,           

734
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:23,079
you've been there for me        
like nobody else.               

735
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:28,551
Now... I might have to          
toss in the "f" word here       

736
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:32,255
to make this a bit easier but...
I fuckin' love you, man.        

737
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:34,791
                    OK, my turn.

738
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,627
             That has to be Guy.

739
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:40,063
[both laughing]                 

740
00:41:40,065 --> 00:41:42,832
All right, Guy just landed      
and we got a little problem.    

741
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:46,202
 <i>- Interpol.</i>                    
<i>- All right. Well, we'll adapt.</i> 

742
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:48,238
OK?                             

743
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,544
                             So?

744
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:57,780
I'm curious to know what kind   
of game you're running?         

745
00:41:57,782 --> 00:42:00,817
I was curious about your game.  

746
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:04,621
We need to get on the same page.

747
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:06,789
What do we do first?            

748
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:09,292
- [Nicky] First, we're          
gonna need a fake.              
- [Guy] How good must it look?  

749
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:11,027
Good enough to fool the eye.    

750
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:13,162
 <i>Identical on the outside,</i>      

751
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:15,632
 <i>inside doesn't matter.</i>         

752
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:18,067
You've got four days.           

753
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:22,705
Crunch, I'm sorry for making fun
of your Trojan Horse idea       
because it actually plays.      

754
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,708
We're gonna hide that fake      
in a Trojan Horse of our own.   

755
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,943
Something that draws attention. 

756
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:29,012
Paddy, see what you can         
come up with.                   

757
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:31,881
I got the perfect thing in mind.

758
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,750
[Crunch] I don't know,          
what do you think?              

759
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:36,953
It makes me feel...             

760
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:40,256
...safe and scared.             

761
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:43,226
Mostly scared.                  

762
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:46,963
It's weird. It's                
like it follows you.            

763
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,833
First, you caress.              

764
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:54,137
Too rough, she cracks.          

765
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:57,173
Too soft, she will not          
succumb to the touch.           

766
00:42:57,175 --> 00:43:03,112
Just right. It's you. Ahh.      

767
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:06,849
Then we need to get our horse   
into their corral.              

768
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:08,685
But, how?                       

769
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:11,154
You say this border station,    
they inspect everything.        

770
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:14,190
Exactly. Everything going in,   
everything going out.           

771
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:17,293

 <i>or walk out our original.</i>      

772
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:20,863
So we're gonna get them         
to take it in for us.           

773
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:25,902
We're going to use our sullied  
reputation to our advantage     
for once.

I admit.                        

908
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:02,785
But I am no Yves Chaudron.      

909
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:06,355
Who's that,                     
Yeeves Show-row?                

910
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:07,623
Stay, Crunch.                   
You'll like this.               

911
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,225
Nah, I've heard                 
this tale a time or two.        

912
00:52:09,227 --> 00:52:11,293
- I gotta take a piss.          
- Come on, Crunch.              

913
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:13,429
Wait. Who's Yves Shmo-boh?      

914
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:15,831
I shall tell you                
of Yves Chaudron.               

915
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:18,901
For this is a story             
of inspiration.                 

916
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:21,604
               He was everything
               I aspire to be.  

917
00:52:21,606 --> 00:52:24,673
             A master, a legend.

918
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:28,744
        A man so gifted his work
        would make angels cry.  

919
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:34,583
   He was the one true talent   
   behind the greatest art theft
   in history.                  

920
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:38,320
               The theft        
               of the Mona Lisa.

921
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:42,625
 <i>The story begins</i>               
 <i>in Paris, 1911.</i>                

922
00:52:42,627 --> 00:52:45,161
 <i>Not with Chaudron,</i>             
 <i>but with an Italian,</i>           

923
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:47,296
 <i>a poor carpenter named Perugia</i> 

924
00:52:47,298 --> 00:52:49,465
 <i>who, a few months</i>              
 <i>before the theft,</i>              

925
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:51,367
works a contract at the Louvre. 

926
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:55,171
 <i>As with any menial job,</i>        
 <i>he learns many menial things.</i>  

927
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:56,906
 <i>Such as where the</i>              
 <i>entrances and exits are,</i>       

928
00:52:56,908 --> 00:52:59,675
 <i>the guards' names,</i>             
 <i>rotations and the like.</i>        

929
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:03,746
 <i>Little did he know</i>             
 <i>that this otherwise</i>            
 <i>useless information</i>            

930
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:06,282
 <i>would prove to be</i>              
 <i>quite important.</i>               

931
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:09,552
 <i>For it is when</i>                 
 <i>Perugia's contract ends</i>        

932
00:53:09,554 --> 00:53:12,488
 <i>that his destiny begins.</i>       

933
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:16,258
 <i>Fate taps Perugia</i>              
 <i>on the shoulder.</i>               

934
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:20,529
 <i>Eduardo de Valfierno,</i>          
 <i>a criminal mastermind.</i>         

935
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:24,833
 <i>Valfierno asks Perugia</i>         
 <i>to steal the Mona Lisa</i>         

936
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:29,371
 <i>for $30,000.</i>                   
 <i>It's like a million back then,</i> 

937
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:33,442
 <i>an offer a poor carpenter</i>      
 <i>could never refuse.</i>            

938
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:36,345
 <i>The adventure of the theft</i>     
 <i>is a story in and of itself.</i>   

939
00:53:36,347 --> 00:53:39,682
 <i>In short, through luck,</i>        
 <i>cunning, lazy security</i>         

940
00:53:39,684 --> 00:53:41,884
 <i>and the horrible disadvantage</i>  
 <i>of being Italian,</i>              

941
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:43,452
 <i>he actually succeeds.</i>          

942
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:45,888
 <i>The carpenter</i>                  
 <i>steals the Mona Lisa</i>           

943
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,958
and the theft makes world news. 

944
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,264
 <i>As promised,</i>                   
 <i>he produces the Mona Lisa.</i>     

945
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:56,799
 <i>Valfierno produces the money.</i>  

946
00:53:56,801 --> 00:53:58,834
But he makes a strange request. 

947
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:01,403
 <i>He asks him to hold on to her</i>  
 <i>just a little longer</i>           

948
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:04,306
 <i>so he can arrange for</i>          
 <i>her transit overseas.</i>          

949
00:54:04,308 --> 00:54:07,309
 <i>Perugia agrees and waits,</i>      

950
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:09,912
 <i>and waits and waits.</i>           

951
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:12,481
His story ends here.            

952
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:15,618
And it is now that I tell you   
of Yves Chaudron.               

953
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,753
 <i>Six months before the theft,</i>   

954
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:20,289
 <i>Valfierno commissions</i>          
 <i>Yves Chaudron,</i>                 

955
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:21,757
 <i>the world's greatest forger,</i>   

956
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:25,027
 <i>to reproduce the Mona Lisa</i>     
 <i>six times and perfect,</i>         

957
00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:28,330
 <i>an Herculean task only</i>         
 <i>Chaudron could accomplish.</i>     

958
00:54:28,332 --> 00:54:30,299
Valfierno then sails to America 

959
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:32,701
 <i>and finds six of the greediest</i> 
 <i>art collectors</i>                 

960
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,937
 <i>and poses this question</i>        
 <i>to them:</i>                       

961
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:37,873
 <i>"Should the Mona Lisa</i>          
 <i>suddenly become available,</i>     

962
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:40,676
 <i>would you pay three hundred</i>    
 <i>thousand dollars for it?"</i>      

963
00:54:40,678 --> 00:54:44,947
 <i>He asks all six,</i>               
 <i>and all six say, "Yes."</i>        

964
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:49,285
 <i>And that is when Valfierno</i>     
 <i>pays Perugia to steal the</i>      
 <i>Mona Lisa.</i>                     

965
00:54:49,287 --> 00:54:51,754
 <i>He then ships</i>                  
 <i>Chaudron's perfect fakes</i>       

966
00:54:51,756 --> 00:54:55,324
 <i>and collects $1.8 million.</i>     

967
00:54:55,326 --> 00:54:58,394
 <i>A fortune beyond</i>               
 <i>comprehension.</i>                 

968
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:05,367
 <i>You see, all he needed</i>         
 <i>was the news of the theft,</i>     

969
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:08,671
 <i>not the Mona Lisa.</i>             

970
00:55:08,673 --> 00:55:14,810
 <i>To him, she herself,</i>           
 <i>is worthless.</i>                  

971
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:20,849
And that is the story of        
the theft of the Mona Lisa.     

972
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:23,385
[laughing]                      

973
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:26,388
I first heard that story        
when I was a small boy.         

974
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:31,560
I knew even then I wanted to    
have the skills to pull         
something that great off.       

975
00:55:31,562 --> 00:55:32,861
And that's why                  
I do what I do.                 

976
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,897
I do it for the ladies.         

977
00:55:34,899 --> 00:55:37,032
[all laughing]                  

978
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:41,603
[Nicky] Well,                   
here's to tomorrow,             

979
00:55:41,605 --> 00:55:44,673
and the Reverend gets his goods 
and we get our just rewards.    

980
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,943
- [Nicky and Lola] Tomorrow!    
- [all] Tomorrow!               

981
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:04,960
Ohhh, fuck.                     

982
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:07,963
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.     

983
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:12,634
I, I taste an ashtray           
and battery acid                

984
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:15,504
and, like, stripper perfume.    

985
00:56:15,506 --> 00:56:17,473
So, we headed for Detroit?      

986
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:19,708
Finish things up with           
the Reverend, or what?          

987
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,144
Yeah, that's right.             
We all just pile into the car   

988
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:25,748
like the Brady Bunch            
and just breeze on              
into the States, right?         

989
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,549
They already flagged me         
for coming over here.           

990
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,385
- Yeah, me too.                 
- Me too.                       

991
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:30,886
They don't like                 
me a lot either, so...          

992
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:33,021
...what exactly is your plan?   

993
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:37,459
Well, we need someone with a    
clean sheet. Francie, you're up.

994
00:56:37,461 --> 00:56:38,794
Me?!                            

995
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,570
Really? Why am I                
wearing this shit?              

996
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,072
Because Interpol                
knows what you look like.       

997
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:53,509
    OK, but don't the Amish ride
    horse and carriages?        

998
00:56:53,511 --> 00:56:57,045
- Well, you're progressive.     
- I can't fucking do this!      

999
00:56:57,047 --> 00:57:00,516
       Well, you better         
       get your best Brando on, 
       hoss, 'cause we need you.

1000
00:57:00,518 --> 00:57:03,452
Yeah, look, Francie,            
it's not <i>The King's Speech.</i>     

1001
00:57:03,454 --> 00:57:06,422
Come here.                      
You got two lines:              

1002
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:09,158
"Going to Detroit."             
And "Nothing to declare."       

1003
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,593
          You're gonna be great.

1004
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:14,763
- I'll meet him there.          
- Oh. Will you?                 

1005
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,498
Yeah.                           

1006
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,100
Hey, look, somebody's got       
to be in Detroit                

1007
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:19,701
to close the deal               
with the Reverend.              

1008
00:57:19,703 --> 00:57:21,837
       Nicky, I'm goin' with ya.

1009
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,939
- We're both hiding             
in the trunk.                   
- [Paddy] The trunk?            

1010
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,442
[scoffs] I'm not                
hidin' in a trunk.              

1011
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:29,178
             Well, then no one's
             going to Detroit.  

1012
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,780
 'Cause if you're alone when you
 get your digits on that money, 

1013
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:33,449
                  we'll never   
                  see you again.

1014
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:38,020
           All right, man. Fine.

1015
00:57:38,022 --> 00:57:40,556
                Pop it, Francie.

1016
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:43,459
- What are you doing?           
- Yeah, what are you doing?     

1017
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:44,927
Hopefully, you                  
won't have to know.             

1018
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:48,230
Yes, sir. But if you            
just give me...                 

1019
00:57:48,232 --> 00:57:51,467
Sir, we are so very             
close on this. We just...       

1020
00:57:51,469 --> 00:57:53,168
 <i>[man on phone yelling]</i>         

1021
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,671
No, I realize I'm not supposed  
to be in the field,             

1022
00:57:55,673 --> 00:57:56,939
but that's not the...           

1023
00:57:56,941 --> 00:58:00,108
OK. Yeah.                       

1024
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:03,479
 <i>Are we clear?</i>                  
 <i>Are we clear? Goodbye.</i>         

1025
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:10,486
OK. We need to just             
start at the beginning here, OK?

1026
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,555
Square one...                   

1027
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:18,727
...art.                         

1028
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,498
- They pay you for this?        
- Shut up!                      

1029
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:27,202
Do you often feel that your life
is just passing you by?         

1030
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:32,074
I cannot even be                
in the same room as you!        

1031
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:43,852
OK. OK, Francie.                

1032
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,224
I got an idea.                  

1033
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:53,028
I think we can make a lot more  
money off that Gospel.          

1034
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,963
Hold out for                    
more from the Reverend?         

1035
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:57,032
No, we don't                    
even deliver it to him.         

1036
00:58:57,034 --> 00:59:00,035
         OK. I fail to see      
         how that makes us rich.

1037
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,804
Guy telling that                
story about the Mona Lisa       

1038
00:59:02,806 --> 00:59:04,640
got me thinking.                

1039
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:06,875
There's a real parallel here.   

1040
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:10,879
                Great. Parallel.
                Not interested. 

1041
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:12,881
Listen, don't dismiss the idea  
out of spite.                   

1042
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,016
                 Not interested.

1043
00:59:14,018 --> 00:59:15,984
Hear me out!                    

1044
00:59:15,986 --> 00:59:21,089
Uncle Paddy can come up         
with at least ten more buyers.  

1045
00:59:21,091 --> 00:59:24,293
And we can get Guy to duplicate 
a book for each one of them.    

1046
00:59:24,295 --> 00:59:28,564
We contact the gallery, we let  
them know their book is stolen. 

1047
00:59:28,566 --> 00:59:30,832
The news hits the paper         
and boom.                       

1048
00:59:30,834 --> 00:59:33,902
Meanwhile we ship off           
ten copies to ten buyers.       

1049
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,671
Each one thinks                 
they have the original.         

1050
00:59:35,673 --> 00:59:37,940
Goddamn it if it's not perfect. 

1051
00:59:37,942 --> 00:59:40,309
                         [sighs]

1052
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,279
                     You know...

1053
00:59:44,281 --> 00:59:48,183
           I think we could make
           half a mil. per book.

1054
00:59:48,185 --> 00:59:51,219
       No, you know, twice that.

1055
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:56,024
- You know how much that is?    
- Ten million.                  

1056
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:57,960
                   That's right.

1057
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,801
[Francie] Uh, all right, boys.  

1058
01:00:05,803 --> 01:00:09,171
We're here so just be quiet, OK?

1059
01:00:09,173 --> 01:00:11,907
- Just be cool!                 
- Two lines!                    

1060
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:14,710
"Going to Detroit!              
Nothing to declare!"            

1061
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:15,844
OK, I know!                     

1062
01:00:15,846 --> 01:00:17,713
Act normal. Be normal.          
Act normal.                     

1063
01:00:17,715 --> 01:00:20,115
Just be a cool guy.             
You're a cool guy, Francie.     

1064
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:23,719
You're a fuckin' cool guy.      
I am not cut out for this.      

1065
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,991
- Citizenship...                
- My name is Francie Tobin!     

1066
01:00:28,993 --> 01:00:31,927
- [both groan]                  
- Well, that's great, son.      

1067
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:33,762
- Where you headed?             
- Canada!                       

1068
01:00:33,764 --> 01:00:35,330
Uh, you're heading in the wrong 
direction...                    

1069
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:37,265
Arrgghh!                        

1070
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:39,067
Canada's, that's where          
I came from.                    

1071
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:41,303
Where I'm... Detroit            
is where I'm heading,           

1072
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:45,073
not, not Canada,                
which is where I'm from.        

1073
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:46,908
Anything to declare?            

1074
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:50,145
No. Not...                      
not even a little bit.          

1075
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:52,848
Uh, your beard's falling off.   

1076
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:58,020
Oh. That's, that's 'cause       
I'm, I'm in a play.             

1077
01:00:58,022 --> 01:00:59,655
[man] What's the play called?   

1078
01:00:59,657 --> 01:01:01,690
[Francie] <i>Witness, The Musical.</i> 

1079
01:01:01,692 --> 01:01:03,358
 <i>Witness,</i> exclamation mark.     

1080
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:06,795
    Are you sure there's nothing
    you want to declare?        

1081
01:01:06,797 --> 01:01:08,764
The play is terrible.           

1082
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:13,368
- Anything in the trunk?        
- No!                           

1083
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:17,005
     Are you absolutely positive

1084
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,306
                you have nothing
                to declare?     

1085
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:23,178
I'm sorry?                      

1086
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,380
Do you think I have             
smugglers in my trunk?          

1087
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:28,150
- [both] No!                    
- I have two American thieves   

1088
01:01:28,152 --> 01:01:31,853
in the trunk of this car        
that I'm crossing your border   
with right now.                 

1089
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,822
Please! Please, have a look.    

1090
01:01:33,824 --> 01:01:38,193
See, see all the                
criminal activity happening     
in my trunk right now!          

1091
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,162
Open the trunk, sir.            

1092
01:01:40,164 --> 01:01:42,330
- Open the...                   
- Open the trunk, just          
open the trunk.                 

1093
01:01:42,332 --> 01:01:44,866
- So I'll just... Oh!           
- Nicky, Nicky, Nicky!          

1094
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:46,768
Yep. Got 'em. Got 'em.          

1095
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,937
- On the count of three.        
- Drugs, son?                   

1096
01:01:48,939 --> 01:01:50,072
Oh, no. I'm good, buddy.        

1097
01:01:50,074 --> 01:01:51,807
       No, I mean, are you on...

1098
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:52,941
    Just open the trunk, please.

1099
01:01:52,943 --> 01:01:54,843
- Yeah, OK.                     
- One.                          

1100
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:56,978
Two. Three.                     

1101
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:00,716
OK, here we go!                 

1102
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,321
            Alrighty, looks like
            you're good to go.  

1103
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,225
Uhh! I just need                
to tell you something.          

1104
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:14,496
I liked <i>Predator Two.</i>           

1105
01:02:14,498 --> 01:02:17,065
       Well, yeah, I didn't mind
        <i>Predator Two.</i>           

1106
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,201
- It's not bad.                 
- Its OK. Danny Glover.         

1107
01:02:19,203 --> 01:02:21,236
- You can't go wrong.           
- No.                           

1108
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,371
- Break a leg.                  
- Oh, yeah! Thank you.          

1109
01:02:23,373 --> 01:02:25,273
- Because I'm an actor.         
- Yeah.                         

1110
01:02:25,275 --> 01:02:27,809
           Oh, fuck, this sucks!

1111
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:29,845
[rock music]                    

1112
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:47,963
 <i> I wandered in</i>                
 <i>late one night </i>               

1113
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:54,269
 <i> Signs all said "open"</i>        
<i>But there was no one in sight </i> 

1114
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:59,307
- I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.   
- Wait your turn.               

1115
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:01,510
Come on!                        

1116
01:03:01,512 --> 01:03:03,178
I'm never doing this shit again!

1117
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:05,280
- You motherfucker!             
- No, no! Hold on!              

1118
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:06,948
What the fuck is this!          
Come on!                        

1119
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:10,051
- Fuck you!                     
- Hold on! Hey!                 

1120
01:03:10,053 --> 01:03:11,453
           Fuck the both of you!

1121
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:12,921
- You fucked up, man.           
- I fucked up!                  

1122
01:03:12,923 --> 01:03:14,256
All right,                      
all right, all right!           

1123
01:03:14,258 --> 01:03:16,391
I promise you,                  
I'm not gonna hit the kid.      

1124
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:18,994
- All right. [grunts]           
- You fucker!                   

1125
01:03:18,996 --> 01:03:21,163
- What did you do that for?     
- Fuck you! Oh!                 

1126
01:03:21,165 --> 01:03:24,099
[Crunch] You had to do it.      
You proud of yourself?          

1127
01:03:24,101 --> 01:03:26,935

Ah, you motherfucker.           
- Please!

01:03:26,937 --> 01:03:29,571
Hey, hey, hey, hey.             
Hey, man. How's business?       

1129
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:34,209
It's fucking slow, man.         

1130
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:43,952
[Nicky] All right,              
what is this place?             

1131
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:45,420
[Crunch] His office             
is on the third floor.          

1132
01:03:45,422 --> 01:03:47,989
I think he paid like            
three grand for the whole place.

1133
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:50,525
                    He overpaid.

1134
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:53,195
[Nicky] This is a golden        
opportunity.                    

1135
01:03:53,197 --> 01:03:55,564
I'm not doing this for me.      

1136
01:03:55,566 --> 01:03:58,867
You know I'm flush.             
I'm doing this for you.         

1137
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:01,369
We're dropping this off,        
we're making a hell of          
a decent score here.            

1138
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:02,871
And in five minutes             
we're going home.               

1139
01:04:02,873 --> 01:04:04,606
             Give me a reason.  
             Give me one reason.

1140
01:04:04,608 --> 01:04:08,410
OK. Where do we find the money  
to pay for these fakes?         

1141
01:04:08,412 --> 01:04:11,046
It cost Guy ten grand           
to fake one.                    

1142
01:04:11,048 --> 01:04:13,315
These fakes would have to       
stand up to carbon dating       

1143
01:04:13,317 --> 01:04:15,016
       and expert scrutiny shit.

1144
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:16,918
Ten grand a book,               
that's a hundred grand.         

1145
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,987
- I can front it.               
- You got a 100 grand           
laying around, Nicky?           

1146
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:21,156
Yes, I do.                      

1147
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,928
You know,                       
I guess this is it.             

1148
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:28,864
This could have been big.       

1149
01:04:28,866 --> 01:04:32,000
We could have made history.     

1150
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:44,112
Damn it.                        

1151
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:49,417
All right, let's go downstairs  
and talk about it.              

1152
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:58,293
A million per book.             
Ten million bucks, guys.        

1153
01:04:58,295 --> 01:05:01,396
- You interested?               
- Of course,                    
I'm fucking interested.         

1154
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:03,965
- Wonderful.                    
- Uncle Paddy?                  

1155
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:05,600
         Ten buyers, I can find.
         Maybe more.            

1156
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:07,402
No, no, no.                     
Let's stick with ten.           

1157
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,204
Let's not get greedy here.      

1158
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:12,140
- Guy, when can you get started?
- Today. Now.                   

1159
01:05:12,142 --> 01:05:15,176
It will take me maybe           
three weeks... No, one month.   

1160
01:05:15,178 --> 01:05:17,946
- I just need money.            
- OK, 100 grand, that's covered.

1161
01:05:17,948 --> 01:05:20,015
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.         

1162
01:05:20,017 --> 01:05:22,384
Seven hundred,                  
fifty thousand, minimum.        

1163
01:05:22,386 --> 01:05:24,319
           You just made        
           one for ten thousand.

1164
01:05:24,321 --> 01:05:28,223
No. I made the cover for ten    
grand. The pages are total shit.

1165
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:32,294
And if you want these to pass   
the carbon dating and the       
professional scrutiny,          

1166
01:05:32,296 --> 01:05:33,995
seven hundred fifty.            

1167
01:05:33,997 --> 01:05:35,497
            Do we need          
            to carbon date them?

1168
01:05:35,499 --> 01:05:38,033
                With our buyers,
                most certainly. 

1169
01:05:38,035 --> 01:05:41,269
That's it, man.                 
Let's go take it back.          

1170
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:43,471
                All right, look.

1171
01:05:43,473 --> 01:05:47,075
            I could come up with
            about $300,000.     

1172
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:48,176
- But...                        
- What?                         

1173
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:49,945
    Gonna take me a couple days.

1174
01:05:49,947 --> 01:05:51,479
              We still need 450.

1175
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:54,316
             I can pull together
             a hundred thousand.

1176
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:56,151
I can do one hundred.           

1177
01:05:56,153 --> 01:06:00,188
OK. That's five.                
We're still 250 short.          

1178
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:02,424
Yeah.                           

1179
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:06,294
OK, we'll be home at dawn.      

1180
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,029
Let's figure this out tomorrow. 

1181
01:06:08,031 --> 01:06:09,497
OK.                             

1182
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,435
- Crunch.                       
- What?                         

1183
01:06:13,437 --> 01:06:16,404
- How much money have you got?  
- I got nothin'.                

1184
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:22,277
      If there was ever a reason
      to mortgage your home...  

1185
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:23,745
Oh, no, no, no, no, man.        
I'm not doing that.             

1186
01:06:23,747 --> 01:06:26,014
              No, not the house.
              That's all I got. 

1187
01:06:26,016 --> 01:06:28,616
If we pull this off,            
you can buy ten of 'em.         

1188
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:31,186
            Look, man, I just...

1189
01:06:31,188 --> 01:06:32,420
         Look, I don't know, OK?

1190
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:33,555
 Listen, I gotta think about it.

1191
01:06:33,557 --> 01:06:35,223
        I wanna run it by Lola. 

1192
01:06:35,225 --> 01:06:37,392
Well, don't take too long.      
We don't have time to lose.     

1193
01:06:37,394 --> 01:06:41,096
Don't talk to me                
about lost time, Nicky.         

1194
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:55,410
           I know what you want.

1195
01:06:55,412 --> 01:07:00,148
Good. 'Cause you're             
gonna need to talk to him.      

1196
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:02,684
             He will never give 
             you all that money.

1197
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:04,252
No, but he'll                   
give it to you.                 

1198
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:06,521
- To me?                        
- He trusts you.                

1199
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:09,424
And we're gonna be wiring money 
all over the world.             

1200
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,694
You're the only one that's not  
on any watch list.              

1201
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:15,730
- Francie isn't.                
- Francie hasn't taken a bath   
in six weeks.                   

1202
01:07:15,732 --> 01:07:17,665
[both chuckle]                  

1203
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:19,667
Come on.                        

1204
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:23,038
Can you convince him?           

1205
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:29,310
It's no good. It's no good.     
She's making you, Crunch.       

1206
01:07:29,312 --> 01:07:31,079
She's probably                  
fucking Nicky.                  

1207
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:33,815
               Hey, easy. Easy, 
               Francie, come on.

1208
01:07:33,817 --> 01:07:36,584
We should just walk.            
I mean, he's juicing you        

1209
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:39,621
for hundreds of thousands       
of dollars, Crunch.             

1210
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:44,092
      Cowards die many times    
      before their actual death.

1211
01:07:44,094 --> 01:07:46,828
                  The brave,    
                  only but once.

1212
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:48,696
Is that Julius Caesar?          

1213
01:07:48,698 --> 01:07:53,802
  Yes! Look, I know how you feel
  about Nicky, believe me.      

1214
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:56,604
But this...                     

1215
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:02,177
    ...this is the one we're    
    all gonna be remembered for.

1216
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:04,813
Ah, Jesus Murphy.               

1217
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:33,108
Ah, you waste no time.          

1218
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:35,110
What can I say?                 
I'm excited. [laughs]           

1219
01:08:35,112 --> 01:08:37,245
OK. Great, we're all here.      

1220
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:40,348
So, starting tomorrow,          
there'll be no contact.         

1221
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:43,384
During that time period         
Paddy will have made the sales, 

1222
01:08:43,386 --> 01:08:45,353
Guy will have completed         
the books.                      

1223
01:08:45,355 --> 01:08:46,888
Crunch will be ready            
to ship them.                   

1224
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:49,824
And Lola will be                
handling the money.             

1225
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:52,660
In a month's time,              
we'll contact Amsterdam,        

1226
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:56,764
the news will get out, we ship  
the books and we get rich.      

1227
01:08:56,766 --> 01:08:59,200
           Ha. The Reverend's   
           gonna be some pissed.

1228
01:08:59,202 --> 01:09:00,335
I'll take care of the Reverend. 

1229
01:09:00,337 --> 01:09:01,603
                I'll call you   
                with his number.

1230
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:04,372
        All right, Nicky, I just
        gotta say this.         

1231
01:09:04,374 --> 01:09:07,375
      If you're gettin' ready to
      do me wrong here somehow, 

1232
01:09:07,377 --> 01:09:10,145
       this is your chance.     
       Just don't take this     
       and all is forgiven, man.

1233
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:11,679
               No harm, no foul.

1234
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:17,218
Crunch, I'm sorry               
about what happened.            

1235
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,554
OK, I fucked up.                

1236
01:09:19,556 --> 01:09:21,789
I wish I could do it            
all over again.                 

1237

    expert analysis, everything.

1271
01:11:23,346 --> 01:11:27,882
     However, your copies,

Oh, that's much, much cheaper.

your ten copies of the book     

1278
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:44,599

they can send theirs.
