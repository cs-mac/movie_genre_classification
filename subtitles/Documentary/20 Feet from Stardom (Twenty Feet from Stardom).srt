1
00:00:42,772 --> 00:00:49,143
Once there was a way
To get back homeward

2
00:00:49,312 --> 00:00:53,305
Are the stars out tonight?

3
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:58,750
Once there was a way to get back home

4
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:01,186
I only have eyes

5
00:01:01,357 --> 00:01:06,385
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry

6
00:01:06,563 --> 00:01:08,895
For you

7
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:11,659
And I will sing a lullaby

8
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:14,769
With a song in my heart

9
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:17,330
So tell me

10
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:20,806
Tell me something good

11
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:25,979
Tell me that you LOve me

12
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:28,777
Tell me, baby

13
00:01:28,952 --> 00:01:31,352
Tell me something good

14
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:33,250
Only you

15
00:01:33,423 --> 00:01:35,323
but how can you know For sure?

16
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:38,426
Can make this world seem right

17
00:01:38,595 --> 00:01:40,153
Is there really just one?

18
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,958
I need your LOve

19
00:01:43,366 --> 00:01:47,735
So many songs, but I' m Feeling so LOnely.

20
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:51,703
Where is the LOve?

21
00:01:55,778 --> 00:02:00,215
You don't have to be beautiFul

22
00:02:00,383 --> 00:02:03,318
To turn me on

23
00:02:04,187 --> 00:02:07,554
I just need your body, baby

24
00:02:07,724 --> 00:02:08,952

26
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:15,656

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,977
Let's talk about eggs, baby
Let's talk about you and me

31
00:02:29,145 --> 00:02:30,772
You don't have to be rich

32
00:02:30,947 --> 00:02:33,211
- Give me all your LOving
- To be my pearl

33
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:37,319
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world

34
00:02:37,487 --> 00:02:41,583
Ain't no particular song

00:02:41,758 --> 00:02:44,192
I just want your extra...

36
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,090
Boys. Boys.

37
00:02:47,263 --> 00:02:49,094
Give a chick a chance.

38
00:02:49,265 --> 00:02:53,702
Well, since my baby leFt me

39
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,271
I Found a new place to dwell

40
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,934
It's down at the end oF Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel

41
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:05,547
And I said, "I' m Feelir so LOnely, baby

42
00:03:05,715 --> 00:03:08,275
I'm Feelir so LOnely

00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:10,749
Oh, I' m Feelir so LOnely "...

44
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,912
I could die

45
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:20,795
Don't have to be rich to be my girl

46
00:03:20,963 --> 00:03:25,957
Don't have to be cool to rule my world

47
00:03:26,135 --> 00:03:27,625
You rule my world

48

52
00:03:44,654 --> 00:03:47,987
His mom and dad met in the usual way.

53
00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:50,887
The song became LOve...

54
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,496
...and LOve became the egg.

55
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:00,829
Memphis?

56
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:03,335
- You got it, sugar?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

57
00:04:03,506 --> 00:04:05,098
Safe and warm.

58
00:04:05,274 --> 00:04:06,764
Hold it tight, now.

59
00:04:06,943 --> 00:04:09,377
Whoa, I think I felt a move in there.

60
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:11,638
And in the usual way...

61
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:14,476
...the moms leFt For the Fishing season...

62
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,882
...while the dads stayed home
to do egg time.

63
00:04:19,055 --> 00:04:20,317
You gonna be okay, Daddy?

64
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:24,017
Oh, sure, honey. We'll be waiting for you,
right here on Lonely Street.

65

I LOve you more and more, tell me why

66
00:04:29,232 --> 00:04:30,529
Bye-bye, now.

67
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,999
Goodbye, Norma Jean.
Don't you worry about a thing.

68
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,003
Don't wanna let you go

69
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,535
I never can say goodbye, boy

70
00:04:44,413 --> 00:04:47,678
When all others leave...

71
00:04:48,451 --> 00:04:49,918
...we remain!

72
00:04:50,086 --> 00:04:52,782
When the sun vanishes...

73
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,881
...we remain!

74
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:59,550
I'm Feelir so LOnely
I'm Feelir so LOnely...

75
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:04,723
Heed the wisdoms, brothers!
Make a huddle!

76
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:07,734
Warm thy egg!

77
00:05:07,904 --> 00:05:09,462
Make a huddle!

78
00:05:10,673 --> 00:05:12,834
- Share the cold!
- Share the cold.

79
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:16,775
Each must take his turn
against the icy blast...

80
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:19,972
...if we are to survive the endless night.

81
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:24,746
Raise your voices, brothers!

82
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:27,583
Give praise to the Great 'Guin...

83
00:05:27,757 --> 00:05:33,389
...who puts songs in our hearts
and Fish in our bellies!

84
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:43,229
Ain't no particular song
I'm more compatible with

85
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,806
Oh, baby, I think I wanna dance now.

86
00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:50,168
No, no, no.

87
00:05:52,582 --> 00:05:55,380
There is a wisdom,
brothers and sisters...

88
00:05:55,551 --> 00:05:58,918
...that stands above all others.

89
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:02,251
- Never, ever...

90
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:04,290
...no matter what...
- No harm done. See?

91
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,360
...drop your egg.

92
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:09,555
No, we're cool. We're cool.

93
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:23,512
OF the many thousands who sang
through that LOng night oF winter...

94
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:27,877
...it was Memphis
who cried out most Fervently...

95
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,181
...to turn the Earth
and bring back the sun.

96
00:07:11,627 --> 00:07:13,492
- It 's a boy!
- Hey, it's a girl

97
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,688
- What a peach!
- What a bruiser!

98
00:07:15,865 --> 00:07:18,026
- Come here, son.
- Come to Daddy, there you go.

99
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,100
Son, you have made
your daddy so proud.

100
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:22,100
It's all genetics, you know.

101
00:07:32,715 --> 00:07:33,943
Memphis?

102
00:07:34,116 --> 00:07:36,880
Is everything okay?

103
00:07:37,753 --> 00:07:40,551
I don't know. I can't hear anything.

104
00:07:46,128 --> 00:07:47,755
- Is it empty?
- Honey.

105
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,022
- Can I have it?
- Gloria.

106
00:07:49,198 --> 00:07:51,359
It's okay, Maurice.

107
00:07:58,107 --> 00:08:00,769
It happens sometimes, Memphis.

108
00:08:01,377 --> 00:08:02,469
Yeah.

109
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:10,175
Wait, you hear that?

110
00:08:11,487 --> 00:08:13,079
- Yeah.
- Hey, I can hear you, buddy.

111
00:08:13,656 --> 00:08:16,250
Oh, your papa's here, it's okay.

112
00:08:18,094 --> 00:08:21,359
Oh, he's okay, Maurice.
Whoa, there it is!

113
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,760
That's his little foot there.

114
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:26,230
There's his other one.

115
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:30,003
That's different.

116
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:32,072
Hey! Come back here, Mr. Mumble.

117
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:33,230
Gloria...

118
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:35,468
She can call him
whatever the heck she likes.

119
00:08:35,644 --> 00:08:37,475
Whoa, little Mumble.

120
00:08:42,518 --> 00:08:44,748
- Mumble? Mumble?
- You okay?

121
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:48,684
Freezing. Freezing.

122
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:50,155
Oh, you'll get used to it.

123
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:53,527
Come on. Come to your daddy.

124
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:58,456
- What do you make of that?
- Little wobbly in the knees.

125
00:08:58,634 --> 00:08:59,828
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

126
00:09:00,002 --> 00:09:01,299
What you doing there, boy?

127
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,767
I'm happy, Pa.

128
00:09:03,606 --> 00:09:04,971
What you doing with your feet?

129
00:09:06,609 --> 00:09:08,099
They're happy too.

130
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:10,802
- I wouldn't do that around folks, son.
- Why not?

131
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,847
- Well, it just ain't penguin, okay?
- Okay.

132
00:09:14,016 --> 00:09:17,383
Yeah. Hey, come on over here.
Get under here. Get warm.

133
00:09:17,553 --> 00:09:19,817
Watch the beak. Watch the beak... Beak!

134
00:09:19,989 --> 00:09:21,422
The beak.

135
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,320
Okay, good boy.

136
00:09:30,232 --> 00:09:32,496
So late. What's keeping them?

137
00:09:32,668 --> 00:09:36,468
Pray, brothers, the Great 'Guin
does not test us with a lean season.

138
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,234
Why, Noah? Have we not all been dutiful

139
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,641
So when you see your mama...

140
00:09:42,812 --> 00:09:44,939
- I stand perfectly still.
- You got it.

141
00:09:45,114 --> 00:09:47,844
But how will I know
which one's my mama?

142
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:49,109
Oh, you'll know.

143
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:52,083
She's got a wiggle in her walk
and a giggle in her talk.

144
00:09:52,455 --> 00:09:55,891
And when she sings,
it darn near breaks your heart.

145
00:10:02,198 --> 00:10:04,393
Hey, wait. I see them. I see them!

146
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:05,795
You're right! You're right!

147
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:08,198
Wives, ho!

148
00:10:08,704 --> 00:10:10,262
Wives, ho!

149
00:10:10,706 --> 00:10:12,333
Wives, ho!

150
00:10:12,675 --> 00:10:16,236
Wait, no. Wait, no, Mumble, get back here.
No, Mumble! Get back... Mumble!

151
00:10:16,412 --> 00:10:19,677
Mumble! Mumble!

152
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:22,580
Mumble!

153
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,212
Michelle? Michelle?

154
00:10:26,388 --> 00:10:28,822
- Roxanne?
- Michelle?

155
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:32,757
Alfie?

156
00:10:34,463 --> 00:10:37,091
- Maurice!
- Michelle! Michelle!

157
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:38,426
Mommy!

158
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:40,193
Oh, she's so darling.

159
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:45,033
Excuse me. Pardon me, pardon me.
Mumble? Mumble?

160
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:46,231
Oh, Mumble.

161
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:48,740
- Mama?
- Mumble!

162
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:51,072
- Mama?
- Mumble!

163
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:52,612
Mumble!

164
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:54,043
Mama? Mama?

165
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:57,276
- Mumble, boy, where are you?
- Mama!

166
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,990
Memphis?

167
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:09,058
Oh, Mama. Oh, Mama.

168
00:11:09,832 --> 00:11:11,925
- Oh, my.
- Daddy.

169
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:14,064
So where's the baby?

170
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:16,534
Well, honey, I' II find him.

171
00:11:16,705 --> 00:11:18,798
- You lost the baby? Memphis!
- It 's okay.

172
00:11:18,974 --> 00:11:20,839
- Mama? Mama?
- Stay!

173
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:24,910
- Come to Mommy.
- No, Mumble.

174
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,173
Mama, Mama.

175
00:11:27,716 --> 00:11:29,547
Hey, what's wrong with his feet?

176
00:11:29,718 --> 00:11:33,449
Oh, that's just a little thing he's got going.
He'll grow out of it.

177
00:11:33,622 --> 00:11:35,522
Mama!

178
00:11:36,692 --> 00:11:39,320
Oh, Memphis, he's gorgeous.

179
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:42,191
- Isn't he, though?
- Look at you.

180
00:11:42,364 --> 00:11:44,355
I got something for you.

181
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:46,262
Open up.

182
00:11:49,772 --> 00:11:52,468
Oh, I love the way she does that.

183
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:57,912
W, X, Y and Z

184
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,274
Good morning, class.

185
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:01,814
Good morning, Miss Viola.

186
00:12:01,984 --> 00:12:02,973
Right.

187
00:12:03,152 --> 00:12:06,553
Well, today we begin with the most
important lesson you will ever learn...

188
00:12:06,722 --> 00:12:08,019
...at Penguin Elementary.

189
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,851
Does anyone know what that is?

190
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:11,287
Anyone? Anyone?

191
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,449
Someone? Seymour?

192
00:12:12,628 --> 00:12:14,528
- Fishing?
- No.

193
00:12:14,697 --> 00:12:16,062
Mumble?

194
00:12:16,232 --> 00:12:17,824
Don't eat yellow snow?

195
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,399
No, that's not it, no.

196
00:12:19,568 --> 00:12:22,731
- It 's our Heartsong, Miss.
- Thank you, Gloria. Excellent, yes.

197
00:12:22,905 --> 00:12:25,772
Without our Heartsong,
we can't be truly penguin, can we?

198
00:12:25,941 --> 00:12:27,738
No.

199
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,277
But, my dears, it's not something
that I can actually teach you.

200
00:12:31,447 --> 00:12:33,847
Does anybody know why?
Anyone? Anyone?

201
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:35,677
You can't teach it to us, ma'am...

202
00:12:35,851 --> 00:12:39,480
...because we have to find
our Heartsongs all by ourselves.

203
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:40,644
Well done, you.

204
00:12:40,823 --> 00:12:42,484
It's the voice you hear inside...

205
00:12:42,658 --> 00:12:44,250
...who you truly are.

206
00:12:44,426 --> 00:12:46,951
Yes. Thank you, Gloria.
Excellent, lovely, thank you.

207
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:49,495
So let's all be very still now.

208
00:12:49,665 --> 00:12:52,930
Take a moment and let it come to you.

209
00:12:53,102 --> 00:12:54,194
- I got one!
- Pick me!

210
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,305
- Pick me! Pick me!
- One at a time. Yes, Seymour.

211
00:12:57,473 --> 00:13:01,603
Don't push me
'Cause I am cLOse to the edge

212
00:13:01,777 --> 00:13:04,712
I'm trying not to LOse my head

213
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,849
Yes, I like that one. I could
really get jiggy with that. Lovely.

214
00:13:08,017 --> 00:13:09,609
I'm ready. I got one.

215
00:13:09,785 --> 00:13:12,345
Oh, I thought you might, Gloria.

216
00:13:14,923 --> 00:13:18,222
Midnight creeps so sLOwly

217
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:20,828
Into hearts oF those

218
00:13:20,996 --> 00:13:23,590
Who need more than they get

219
00:13:23,766 --> 00:13:26,667
Daylight deals a bad hand

220
00:13:26,835 --> 00:13:28,860
To a penguin

221
00:13:29,038 --> 00:13:35,466
Who has laid too many bets

222
00:13:35,811 --> 00:13:37,438
That's as far as I got so far.

223
00:13:37,613 --> 00:13:40,207
- Oh, yes, lovely. Really lovely.
- That's beautiful.

224
00:13:40,382 --> 00:13:43,647
Well, Mumble, since
you seem so keen to share.

225
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:48,389
Mine's sort of a boom and a:

226
00:13:51,093 --> 00:13:52,390
And another boom.

227
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:53,687
You heard that in there?

228
00:13:53,862 --> 00:13:56,126
- Do you like it?
- I' m afraid that's not a tune.

229
00:13:56,598 --> 00:14:00,557
- It 's not?
- No, dear. A tune is like:

230
00:14:03,906 --> 00:14:06,033
Oh, okay.

231
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:12,075
Who is that?

232
00:14:12,247 --> 00:14:15,080
That is the offspring of Memphis
and Norma Jean.

233
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,808
The wee hippity-hopper.

234
00:14:23,225 --> 00:14:25,216
It's not funny!

235
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:27,419
No. No, not in the least.

236
00:14:27,596 --> 00:14:31,054
A penguin without a Heartsong
is hardly a penguin at all.

237
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:33,667
I think he broke my ear.

238
00:14:34,803 --> 00:14:36,532
In all my years, I' ve never, I mean...

239
00:14:36,705 --> 00:14:40,300
And you having such fine voices.
Well, it's bizarre.

240
00:14:40,476 --> 00:14:44,003
Did anything happen, you know,
during early development?

241
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:46,613
No, all fine. Normal incubation.

242
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:48,113
- Right.
- Wasrt it, honey?

243
00:14:48,283 --> 00:14:51,878
Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough winter,
I guess.

244
00:14:52,054 --> 00:14:53,043
Right, right.

245
00:14:53,222 --> 00:14:55,690
- He did hatch a little late...
- Yes, I understand. Yes.

246
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:58,918
- To think he might spend his life alone...
- Quite, quite.

247
00:14:59,094 --> 00:15:01,255
...never to meet his one true love.

248
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,627
Oh, please, Miss Viola,
isn't there something we can do?

249
00:15:05,768 --> 00:15:08,259
Well, there is always Mrs. Astrakhan.

250
00:15:08,437 --> 00:15:09,426
Mrs. Astrakhan?

251
00:15:09,605 --> 00:15:12,369
If anyone can, Mrs. Astrakhan can.

252
00:15:16,745 --> 00:15:17,973
Can't sing?

253
00:15:18,147 --> 00:15:20,411
Can't sing? Rubbish, darling.

254
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:23,210
Every little penguin has a song.

255
00:15:23,385 --> 00:15:25,012
When I have finished...

256
00:15:25,187 --> 00:15:28,850
...your singing will be giving everyone
the goose pimple.

257
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:32,926
Now, to begin.
First, we must find a feeling.

258
00:15:33,095 --> 00:15:36,223
Happy feeling, sad feeling.

259
00:15:36,398 --> 00:15:39,731
Maybe lonely feeling.

260
00:15:40,235 --> 00:15:42,100
You feel it?

261
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:45,297
Good. Now, let it out.

262
00:15:45,474 --> 00:15:48,170
Be spontaneous.

263
00:15:52,114 --> 00:15:53,411
That, what is that?

264
00:15:53,582 --> 00:15:55,777
I'm being spontan-you-us.

265
00:15:57,219 --> 00:16:00,052
Darling, you want to meet beautiful girl

266
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:01,587
You want to make the egg?

267
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:02,849
Oh, yes.

268
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:08,429
Well, sing! And no jiggy-jog.
Do not move muscle.

269
00:16:08,597 --> 00:16:10,724
No moving!

270
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,936
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

271
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:16,695
Enough!

272
00:16:16,872 --> 00:16:20,069
Okay. We go back to the top.

273
00:16:20,642 --> 00:16:24,169
Forget body. Look inside soul.

274
00:16:24,346 --> 00:16:28,043
Feel the feeling. Enormous feeling.

275
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:31,584
So enormous it fills whole body.

276
00:16:31,753 --> 00:16:35,018
It must escape or you explode.

277
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,023
- Now, open your little beak.
- Come on.

278
00:16:38,193 --> 00:16:41,321
Yes, yes. Lift up the head, that's it.

279
00:16:41,497 --> 00:16:43,795
Now... Now...

280
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:48,665
Now

281
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:19,932
Disaster! Catastrophe!

282
00:17:20,102 --> 00:17:22,366
I never fail before.

283
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:25,666
Never! Never!

284
00:17:34,449 --> 00:17:37,714
- Well, I thought it was kind of cute.
- But it just ain't penguin, okay?

285
00:17:37,886 --> 00:17:41,151
So what if he's a little different?
I always kind of liked different.

286
00:17:41,323 --> 00:17:43,985
He's not different.
He's a regular emperor penguin.

287
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:46,184
Hey, you know what? I can leave school.

288
00:17:46,361 --> 00:17:48,556
I can go to work. The three of us.

289
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,564
Whoa, little fella. You ain't going nowhere
till you got yourself an education.

290
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:55,669
You get them singing muscles
big and strong, you got that?

291
00:17:55,837 --> 00:17:56,963
I'll try, Pa.

292
00:17:57,139 --> 00:18:00,631
You bet you will. The word "triumph"
starts with "try," and it ends with...?

293
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:04,472
- "Umph."
- That's right. A great big "umph."

294
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:06,805
I'm going fishing.

295
00:18:12,754 --> 00:18:14,949
Oh, Mumble.

296
00:18:18,694 --> 00:18:21,128
That First hard summer...

297
00:18:21,296 --> 00:18:24,322
...while his mom and dad
were working overtime...

298
00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:27,400
...on the great commute to the sea...

299
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:31,903
...Mumble Found a place
away From disapproving eyes...

300
00:18:32,074 --> 00:18:37,535
...where a Funky little Fella
could be himself.

301
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:34,635
Hey, what you doing there, flipper bird?

302
00:19:34,803 --> 00:19:37,033
Nothing. What are you doing?

303
00:19:37,205 --> 00:19:40,038
Nothing. Just dropped in
for a little lunch.

304
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,938
There's food? Here?

305
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:45,036
Leg or wing?

306
00:19:45,213 --> 00:19:47,647
Oh, no, no, wait. Not me, I' m a penguin.

307
00:19:47,816 --> 00:19:51,513
Exactly. The flipper birds,
that's you, eat the fish.

308
00:19:51,687 --> 00:19:55,214
The flying birds, that's me,
eat the flipper bird and the fish.

309
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,620
And lately, there ain't a lot of fish.

310
00:19:57,793 --> 00:19:59,886
- So...
- This time I' m getting the juicy bits.

311
00:20:00,062 --> 00:20:02,462
- Me first!
- Hey, you want a piece of me?

312
00:20:02,631 --> 00:20:05,293
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm trying to think about lunch.

313
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:08,664
Wait! Watch this!

314
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:19,039
Yeah, that's weird, all right. Listen.
For once, we're gonna do this civilized.

315
00:20:19,214 --> 00:20:21,808
- Now, get in line...
- Hey! What's that on your leg?

316
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:25,111
- What? This little thing?
- Oh, no. Don't start him on that.

317
00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:28,415
Shut up! The little flipper bird
asked me a perceptive question.

318
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,286
- A question like that deserves an answer.
- Here we go.

319
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,121
I got two words for you:

320
00:20:33,795 --> 00:20:36,355
"Alien abduction."

321
00:20:36,531 --> 00:20:38,226
- Oh, you had to ask.
- Have mercy.

322
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,265
Quiet!

323
00:20:40,435 --> 00:20:43,836
Now, little buddy,
there is something out there.

324
00:20:44,005 --> 00:20:46,098
Creatures. Not like us.

325
00:20:46,274 --> 00:20:48,504
Bigger, fiercer, and smarter too.

326
00:20:48,677 --> 00:20:50,167
- Ask me how I know.
- How?

327
00:20:50,345 --> 00:20:52,506
Because I' ve been captured by them,
that's how.

328
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:53,705
Unbelievable.

329
00:20:53,882 --> 00:20:55,850
What do you mean "unbelievable?"
It's true.

330
00:20:56,017 --> 00:20:58,247
I'm sitting on a rock,
minding my own business...

331
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,012
...when suddenly, they're onto me.

332
00:21:00,188 --> 00:21:02,315
These beings, like big ugly penguins.

333
00:21:02,491 --> 00:21:04,618
Fat, flabby faces with front-ways eyes...

334
00:21:04,793 --> 00:21:08,194
...no feathers, no beaks,
and these... These appendages.

335
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,055
They probe me. They tie me up.
They strap me down.

336
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:14,100
They take this pointy thing
and they stick it into me.

337
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:16,829
And then, blackout.

338
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:18,404
Gosh.

339
00:21:18,573 --> 00:21:21,508
I woke up and there's this...
This thing on me.

340
00:21:21,676 --> 00:21:25,908
Every flying bird is dissing me,
"Hey, what's happening, yellow leg?"

341
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:28,072
It was humiliating.

342
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,410
And then what?

343
00:21:29,584 --> 00:21:32,610
It was humiliating.
What more do you want?

344
00:21:33,622 --> 00:21:35,749
They could have eated you.

345
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:38,886
Yeah. Yeah.

346
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,291
I guess my pitiful cries for mercy
appealed to their better nature.

347
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:45,632
Can I appeal to your better nature?

348
00:21:46,401 --> 00:21:49,598
Nice try, kid, but no.

349
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,708
No. No. No!

350
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,706
What you doing down there, flipper bird?

351
00:21:55,877 --> 00:21:56,866
Get up here.

352
00:21:57,045 --> 00:21:58,672
Get back up here this minute.

353
00:21:58,847 --> 00:22:01,008
Oh, great. You let him get away.
Didrt you?

354
00:22:01,183 --> 00:22:02,480
All your screwy alien talk.

355
00:22:02,651 --> 00:22:04,915
- Hey, I' m an abductee.
- Abduct this.

356
00:22:05,086 --> 00:22:07,714
- Don't make me call Uncle Angie.
- Oh, fine.

357
00:22:07,956 --> 00:22:09,981
Where youse going? I' m an abductee!

358
00:22:10,158 --> 00:22:13,719
- I don't care what you are, I' m hungry!
- Would you like to hear our specials?

359
00:22:13,895 --> 00:22:17,160
How about fish? There's no fish.
How about penguin? There's no penguin.

360
00:22:17,332 --> 00:22:19,323
What are we gonna eat?!

361
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:33,848
There's a world where I can go

362
00:22:34,015 --> 00:22:39,351
And tell my secrets to

363
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:41,682
In my room

364
00:22:41,857 --> 00:22:45,293
Paying no mind to his dancing heart...

365
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,794
...the kid saw out his school days
at the back oF the class...

366
00:22:49,965 --> 00:22:52,991
...LOst in his imaginings.

367
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:56,836
Now it's dark and I' m...

368
00:22:57,272 --> 00:23:02,039
What FabuLOus worlds lay out there,
Far beyond the ice?

369
00:23:02,677 --> 00:23:05,202
- I won't be aFraid

370
00:23:05,747 --> 00:23:07,180
Was there any place...

371
00:23:07,349 --> 00:23:10,841
...where one small penguin
without a Heartsong...

372
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:13,715
...could ever truly beLOng?

373
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:17,655
In my room

374
00:23:30,205 --> 00:23:32,639
And so, a thousand generations ago...

375
00:23:32,807 --> 00:23:36,334
...our forefathers
forsook our wings for flippers.

376
00:23:36,511 --> 00:23:39,537
You graduates going to sea
for the first time...

377
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:42,410
...are to reap the benefits
of their wise choice.

378
00:23:43,184 --> 00:23:45,618
These are lean and uncertain times.

379
00:23:45,787 --> 00:23:48,551
But by the power
of the ancient penguin wisdoms...

380
00:23:48,723 --> 00:23:51,817
...we, my brethren, will endure.

381
00:23:51,993 --> 00:23:54,791
- "Blah, blah, blah."
- Norma Jean.

382
00:23:54,963 --> 00:23:58,865
Who is he to say my boy can't graduate?
He's not hurting anyone.

383
00:23:59,034 --> 00:24:03,562
- True to our ways
and you will always be won'thy of this...

384
00:24:03,738 --> 00:24:08,869
...our brave penguin nation. Excelsior!

385
00:24:21,623 --> 00:24:23,887
Ocean, here I come!

386
00:24:25,627 --> 00:24:29,256
You know what? We're gonna have
a little graduation ceremony of our own.

387
00:24:29,431 --> 00:24:30,796
- You mean it, Ma?
- You betcha.

388
00:24:30,966 --> 00:24:33,628
- Excelsior!
- Excelsior!

389
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:36,330
Keep it down.

390
00:24:36,504 --> 00:24:38,938
- Pa.
- Memphis.

391
00:24:41,576 --> 00:24:44,545
- Go get them, tiger.
- Thanks, Ma.

392
00:24:47,248 --> 00:24:49,478
- Make every moment count!
- Got you, Ma!

393
00:24:49,651 --> 00:24:51,744
- Remember, "Stranger Danger."
- Yeah, sure, Pa.

394
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,118
And watch out for those leopard seals
and them killer whales.

395
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:57,656
Mark this, Noah.

396
00:24:57,826 --> 00:25:03,321
That boy was always a bad egg.
I'm telling you, no good will come of this.

397
00:25:12,974 --> 00:25:14,737
Guys!

398
00:25:15,777 --> 00:25:17,677
Wait up!

399
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,364
What do you think?

400
00:25:43,538 --> 00:25:46,302
- You first.
- No, you first.

401
00:25:47,442 --> 00:25:49,910
No. No, no, no.

402
00:25:54,516 --> 00:25:55,676
Stop pushing!

403
00:26:00,188 --> 00:26:03,555
- What was that?
- I think it was the fuzzball.

404
00:26:08,696 --> 00:26:10,823
See any blood?

405
00:26:13,802 --> 00:26:16,134
What you waiting for?

406
00:27:14,362 --> 00:27:15,954
Hey, Gloria!

407
00:27:16,131 --> 00:27:19,532
Gloria, I adore-ia. I' d like to see more-ia.

408
00:27:19,701 --> 00:27:21,362
Gloria.

409
00:27:40,388 --> 00:27:42,686
- Mumble?
- Gloria.

410
00:27:47,128 --> 00:27:48,652
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

411
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,355
Fall back, coming through!

412
00:28:09,918 --> 00:28:13,820
Gloria? All my life,
I've wanted to say that you're so...

413
00:28:13,988 --> 00:28:16,047
- Fish.
- Yeah. You're so fish.

414
00:28:16,224 --> 00:28:18,283
No. Fish!

415
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:20,324
Fish!

416
00:28:21,763 --> 00:28:23,355
Oh, that's mine.

417
00:28:29,337 --> 00:28:32,272
- That's lousy.
- You didn't get one?

418
00:28:36,077 --> 00:28:37,169
Sorry.

419
00:28:37,345 --> 00:28:38,573
Gloria. You got one?

420
00:28:38,746 --> 00:28:41,214
- Nope. Not this time.
- You have it.

421
00:28:41,382 --> 00:28:44,078
- Thank you, Mumble, but it's yours.
- I want you to have it.

422
00:28:44,252 --> 00:28:46,914
- No. You caught it. You eat it.
- I want you to...

423
00:28:47,088 --> 00:28:49,318
Skua! You get back here!

424
00:28:57,065 --> 00:29:00,626
- Come on.
- Mumble! Let go!

425
00:29:00,802 --> 00:29:03,794
Mumble! Let go!

426
00:29:08,343 --> 00:29:10,504
You just let him get away!

427
00:29:19,287 --> 00:29:22,256
- Is he breathing?
- He's certainly not eating.

428
00:29:22,423 --> 00:29:25,824
Mumble? Are you okay?

429
00:29:26,694 --> 00:29:28,161
Mumble?

430
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:32,192
Take the fish.

431
00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:34,835
- What?
- Take the stupid fish.

432
00:29:35,003 --> 00:29:37,096
Oh, okay.

433
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:49,279
Thank you, Mumble.

434
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:51,685
You're welcome.

435
00:29:51,853 --> 00:29:55,414
- Somebody to

436
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,487
Love

437
00:29:57,892 --> 00:30:02,090
On this, our night of graduation,
infatuation, illumination...

438
00:30:02,263 --> 00:30:05,130
...top of the class, Missy Gloria.

439
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,133
Each morning I get up, I die a little

440
00:30:08,303 --> 00:30:10,362
Can barely stand on my Feet

441
00:30:10,538 --> 00:30:11,596
Take a LOok at yourself

442
00:30:11,773 --> 00:30:14,640
Take a LOok in the mirror and cry a little

443
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:17,369
Lord, what you doing to me?

444
00:30:17,545 --> 00:30:20,446
I spent all my years in believing you

445
00:30:20,615 --> 00:30:26,053
I just can't get no relieF, Lord

446
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,653
- Somebody
- Somebody

447
00:30:27,822 --> 00:30:29,084

Can anybody Find me

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,957
Somebody to LOve?

450
00:30:40,501 --> 00:30:41,866
- She works hard
- Every day

451
00:30:42,036 --> 00:30:43,025
Every day

452
00:30:43,204 --> 00:30:45,866
Oh, I try and I try and I try

453
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,770
but everybody wants to put me down

454
00:30:48,943 --> 00:30:52,504
They say, they say, I' m going crazy

455
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,012
They say I got a LOt oF water in my brain

456
00:30:55,183 --> 00:31:00,246
Got no common sense
I got nobody leFt to believe in

457
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:08,989
What's wrong with you?

458
00:31:09,163 --> 00:31:10,289
- Mumble.

459

461
00:31:15,503 --> 00:31:16,800
- Sorry.

00:31:16,971 --> 00:31:18,666
- Sorry.

463
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,809
You're great. That was great.

00:31:21,976 --> 00:31:24,376
Oh, baby, Find me

00:31:43,097 --> 00:31:45,725
I'm searching the high and low.

472
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:49,127
Yes, there's somebody out there
who needs to find me.

473
00:31:49,303 --> 00:31:51,669

Mumble!

480
00:32:15,897 --> 00:32:18,957
- Who do you think you are?
- Yeah, you're spoiling it for everybody.

481
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:22,068
- Take a flying leap.
- Yeah, jump in the lake.

482
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:33,176
Where is my baby?

483
00:32:35,883 --> 00:32:40,980
Anybody Find me, Find me
Find me, Find me

484
00:32:41,155 --> 00:32:46,491
Somebody

485
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:11,278
Okay, fellas. Cut it out.

486
00:33:14,989 --> 00:33:17,753
I'm completely terrified.

487
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,454
Gloria?

488
00:33:21,496 --> 00:33:23,123
Guys?

489
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,865
Get up here or I' II come in after you.

490
00:35:02,363 --> 00:35:03,921
- Safe!
- Oh, yeah!

491
00:35:04,098 --> 00:35:06,293
- You the bomb, bro.
- That's a 9.8.

492
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:07,695
- I give you 10.
- Why?

493
00:35:10,605 --> 00:35:13,403
Oh, no, no, no. Come on.
Bring it. Bring it on.

494
00:35:13,574 --> 00:35:15,769
- Kiss my frozen tushy.
- Kiss it. Kiss it.

495
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,114
Come here, sausage.
I take you with ketchup.

496
00:35:23,284 --> 00:35:25,775
But first you got to catch up.

497
00:35:25,953 --> 00:35:28,945
Oh, here he comes.
You better move in a half an hour.

498
00:35:29,123 --> 00:35:36,086
Let's get out of here.

499
00:35:37,932 --> 00:35:39,593
- Hey, amigo, do that again.
- Do what?

500
00:35:39,767 --> 00:35:41,860
- That thing with the...
- The clickety-clickety.

501
00:35:42,036 --> 00:35:43,025
- That.
- Yeah, do it.

502
00:35:43,204 --> 00:35:46,799
- Come on, come on.
- Well, I just kind of go:

503
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:49,706
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, nice.

504
00:35:49,877 --> 00:35:52,141
And then this:

505
00:35:56,484 --> 00:35:59,248
Way to go! It 's amazing!

506
00:36:01,756 --> 00:36:04,316
- Oh, the little whisker.
- Look at him.

507
00:36:04,492 --> 00:36:07,791
Oh, he's leaving.
Oh, no, that was his face!

508
00:36:07,962 --> 00:36:10,624
Remember, dumplings,
I know where you live.

509
00:36:10,798 --> 00:36:12,732
Yeah, it's called land, lard face.

510
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:15,428
Flop back anytime, rubber butt!

511
00:36:18,439 --> 00:36:20,771
See you, fatty.

512
00:36:20,941 --> 00:36:22,875
That's cool. "See you, fatty!"

513
00:36:23,044 --> 00:36:25,774
Did it take you a while
to come up with that one?

514
00:36:25,946 --> 00:36:27,607
All right, way to go, tall guy.

515
00:36:27,782 --> 00:36:29,943
Give me fin, give me fin.

516
00:36:30,818 --> 00:36:33,412
To the leFt, to the right
I'm getting it, oh, yes

517
00:36:33,587 --> 00:36:35,248
Look out, here I go

518
00:36:35,423 --> 00:36:39,621
I got it, I got it, I don't, I had it

519
00:36:39,794 --> 00:36:41,785
Oh, my stomach hurts. I gotta pee.

520
00:36:43,064 --> 00:36:45,396
Ain't you coming, tall boy?

521
00:36:46,434 --> 00:36:49,403
What, you got something better to do?

522
00:36:50,604 --> 00:36:54,370
- No.
- Well, then, come along, Fluffy, let's go.

523
00:37:10,224 --> 00:37:12,818
Hey, stretch, you like to party?

524
00:37:12,993 --> 00:37:14,790
Party? I guess so.

525
00:37:14,962 --> 00:37:16,293
Well, stick with us, baby.

526
00:37:16,464 --> 00:37:19,490
Yeah, because we practically
own the action here.

527
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,658
Mambo!

528
00:37:23,604 --> 00:37:26,038
Everybody's so... spontan-you-us.

529
00:37:26,207 --> 00:37:27,902
Spontan-you-us!

530
00:37:28,075 --> 00:37:29,372
And these are the bad times!

531
00:37:29,543 --> 00:37:32,876
- Yeah, our food chain go loco.
- Everyone a bit down.

532
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:35,777
But it ain't gonna stop no party!

533
00:37:37,251 --> 00:37:38,843
- Viva la party!
- Watch me work.

534
00:37:39,019 --> 00:37:41,988
Gosh, he's eating rocks.

535
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:45,920
- You hear what he said?
- "Eating rocks."

536
00:37:46,093 --> 00:37:47,754
But he had a rock in his mouth.

537
00:37:47,928 --> 00:37:51,295
That's no rock, hombre. It 's love stones.

538
00:37:51,465 --> 00:37:54,457
- For building the nest.
- The one with the most pebbles wins.

539
00:37:54,635 --> 00:37:57,001
You know:

540
00:37:57,204 --> 00:37:59,195
You're not interested in chicas?

541
00:37:59,373 --> 00:38:00,670
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You kidding?

542
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:03,833
Without us, the chicas got no boom.

543
00:38:04,745 --> 00:38:07,578
- Why aren't you collecting pebbles?
- Pebbles, schmebbles, man.

544
00:38:07,748 --> 00:38:11,343
We got personality, with a capital Y.
Why? Because we're hot.

545
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:14,283
Watch and learn, tall boy.

546
00:38:14,922 --> 00:38:17,117
- Hey. Hey, baby.
- Over here, mama. Chicky baby.

547
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,724
- Baby.
- What are you looking at?

548
00:38:18,893 --> 00:38:20,520
- You looking at me?
- Come over here.

549
00:38:20,694 --> 00:38:23,322
- Come on, mami.
- You see something you like, yes?

550
00:38:23,497 --> 00:38:26,022
I don't think so. Not tonight, baby.

551
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,828
Oh, don't be so snooty, booty.

552
00:38:29,003 --> 00:38:31,836
That's the way... you like it, you like it

553
00:38:32,006 --> 00:38:34,907
You want it, I got it
Could 've had it, you missed it

554
00:38:35,075 --> 00:38:37,009
Look at the feet, huh?

555
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,309
- Where'd you learn that?
- The big guy.

556
00:38:41,482 --> 00:38:43,006
- He from out of town.
- He with us.

557
00:38:43,184 --> 00:38:46,676
- Do it again.
- Do it, baby. Show me those flipping feet.

558
00:38:46,854 --> 00:38:50,517
- No, no, no. Sorry, girls.
- Some other time maybe.

559
00:38:50,691 --> 00:38:53,455
You guys are soft in the head, okay?

560
00:38:53,994 --> 00:38:54,983
Let's go.

561
00:38:55,162 --> 00:38:58,256
- Leave them wanting more, you know?
- Hold back till the season.

562
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:01,191
- You show them what you got.
- Either you got it or not.

563
00:39:01,368 --> 00:39:03,996
- And the Amigos?
- We got it!

564
00:39:05,873 --> 00:39:07,431
You think I could get some of it?

565
00:39:07,608 --> 00:39:12,409
Hombre, you've got so much already,
you dangerous, baby.

566
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,138
You really think so?

567
00:39:14,315 --> 00:39:16,044
You kidding? With moves like yours...

568
00:39:16,217 --> 00:39:18,685
...you must have all the ladies
drooling at your feet.

569
00:39:18,853 --> 00:39:23,017
- I wouldn't say that.
- Oh, listen to him. He's so cute.

570
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,680
Let me tell something to you.

571
00:39:25,092 --> 00:39:28,960
Except for me, tall boy,
you got the most charisma of anybody.

572
00:39:29,129 --> 00:39:32,656
Put that ego away, Ramon,
you're gonna hurt someone.

573
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:36,735
You so jealous. Just a moment.
I hear people wanting something.

574
00:39:36,904 --> 00:39:38,997
Me!

575
00:39:40,107 --> 00:39:42,598
- Mambo
- Okay, you girlies, Mambo

576
00:39:42,776 --> 00:39:46,303
One more time now, mambo
Mambo, mambo, mambo

577
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,471
Mambo!

578
00:40:08,636 --> 00:40:11,730
Your turn, your turn.

579
00:40:11,906 --> 00:40:13,635
Oh, get down.

580
00:40:21,482 --> 00:40:23,848
Man, this guy is so accidentally cool.

581
00:40:25,252 --> 00:40:26,844
Okay, okay.

582
00:40:27,021 --> 00:40:28,147
Mama!

583
00:40:41,302 --> 00:40:43,361
Mommy!

584
00:41:05,693 --> 00:41:07,627
Come on, Fluffy.

585
00:41:11,198 --> 00:41:12,222
Oh, I love gravity.

586
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:15,732
- Oh, I feel like reminiscing.
- Remin-icing?

587
00:42:43,223 --> 00:42:45,157
- It was too close.
- Come on, come on.

588
00:42:47,361 --> 00:42:49,829
Hey, guys! Where are we going?

589
00:42:49,997 --> 00:42:52,124
- We relocating.
- Placing ourselves elsewhere.

590
00:42:52,299 --> 00:42:55,268
- But that thing, what was it?
- How should we know?

591
00:42:55,436 --> 00:42:57,836
- We're penguins.
- Very little penguins.

592
00:42:58,005 --> 00:43:01,964
But where did it come from?
It's so weird, so alien.

593
00:43:02,142 --> 00:43:04,542
- What's he talking about?
- Some hombre called Elian.

594
00:43:04,711 --> 00:43:07,179
I don't know a guy Elian.
I knew a guy named Estevan...

595
00:43:07,347 --> 00:43:09,679
- Not Estevan, Elian.
- Guys, we have a mystery here.

596
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:10,976
A mind-boggling mystery.

597
00:43:11,151 --> 00:43:13,085
So? What are we
supposed to do about it?

598
00:43:13,253 --> 00:43:15,483
Amigos, we gotta get
to the bottom of this thing.

599
00:43:16,323 --> 00:43:21,625
Big guy, let me tell something to you.
Come close. Don't be afraid.

600
00:43:21,795 --> 00:43:23,490
- You want answers?
- Yeah.

601
00:43:23,664 --> 00:43:25,029
- That's all you need?
- Yeah.

602
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:26,188
- Nothing else?
- No.

603
00:43:26,366 --> 00:43:27,731
Then this is very easy.

604
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:29,061
You go see Lovelace.

605
00:43:30,204 --> 00:43:31,831
- Lovelace.
- Go see Lovelace.

606
00:43:32,005 --> 00:43:33,996
- Genius, Ramon. You are the man.
- Thank you.

607
00:43:34,174 --> 00:43:35,937
- I take a moment for myself.
- Let's go.

608
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,372
- Bow down.
- You the man.

609
00:43:37,544 --> 00:43:39,876
- That's enough, I feel your love.
- Who's Lovelace?

610
00:43:40,047 --> 00:43:42,379
- Lovelace is the guru.
- Go see Lovelace.

611
00:43:42,549 --> 00:43:44,642
- He got the answer to everything.
- Everything.

612
00:43:44,818 --> 00:43:46,911
- Really?
- Ask him, he never wrong.

613
00:43:47,087 --> 00:43:50,352
But first, you gonna need a pebble.

614
00:43:54,761 --> 00:43:58,458
Hold it, y'all. I have a warning
For the audience.

615
00:43:59,299 --> 00:44:02,598
Ladies, please, avert your eyes...

616
00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:06,102
...because I' ve been known to hypnotize.

617
00:44:06,974 --> 00:44:10,410
You heard the voice,
now you're about to meet...

618
00:44:10,577 --> 00:44:14,604
...the one and only Lovelace,
in the Flesh...

619
00:44:14,781 --> 00:44:19,844
...right here, right on, right now.

620
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,353
The devotion, please.

621
00:44:24,057 --> 00:44:25,251
Oh, yeah.

622
00:44:25,425 --> 00:44:27,950
And now, your question.

623
00:44:28,128 --> 00:44:29,561
Senor Lovelace...

624
00:44:30,097 --> 00:44:33,260
...my wife has disappeared. Is she alive?

625
00:44:36,403 --> 00:44:40,169
Is she alive now?
Separate the truth From the jive

626
00:44:40,374 --> 00:44:43,935
Speak to me, oh, mystic beings

627
00:44:46,313 --> 00:44:49,305
Yes! She's happy
and you're in her thoughts.

628
00:44:49,483 --> 00:44:51,212
Is she with another male?

629
00:44:51,385 --> 00:44:54,320
One pebble, one question. Next!

630
00:44:54,488 --> 00:44:57,514
Oh, Serene One.
Please ask the mystic beings...

631
00:44:57,691 --> 00:44:59,283
...will I ever be as rich as you?

632
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,752
In your dreams, Jean. Next!

633
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:04,921
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
- Get up there, big guy.

634
00:45:05,098 --> 00:45:08,966
- That's it. Don't be scared.
- Gentleman, please! One at a time.

635
00:45:09,603 --> 00:45:11,070
- We with him.
- Yeah, we together.

636
00:45:11,238 --> 00:45:13,672
- He got a beautiful question. Go.
- Do it.

637
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,364
Just don't look him in the eye.

638
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:17,533
Have you ever been abducted by aliens?

639
00:45:18,045 --> 00:45:20,536
Excuse me?
What kind of question is that? Next!

640
00:45:20,714 --> 00:45:21,703
No, wait, senor.

641
00:45:21,882 --> 00:45:26,182
I met a skua once, with something like that
on his foot, said he was abducted by aliens.

642
00:45:26,353 --> 00:45:31,120
This, friend, is my sacred talisman...

643
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:33,820
Talisman, talisman

644
00:45:33,994 --> 00:45:37,657
...bestowed on me by the mystic beings...

645
00:45:37,831 --> 00:45:40,356
Mystic beings

646
00:45:40,534 --> 00:45:44,436
...during my epic journey
of enlightenment...

647
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:46,729
...to the forbidden shore.

648
00:45:46,907 --> 00:45:49,205
Forbidden shore

649
00:45:49,376 --> 00:45:51,401
Oh, say it one more.

650
00:45:51,578 --> 00:45:55,139
- Forbidden shore
- Oh, yeah

651
00:45:55,315 --> 00:45:57,215
Wait, you saw mystic beings?

652
00:45:57,384 --> 00:46:00,683
I hear them! They speak through me!

653
00:46:00,854 --> 00:46:02,913
Oh, yeah.

654
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:06,082
There's a power that makes me
stand upon this tower!

655
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:09,286
Did they have front-ways eyes?
Did they probe you? Strap you down?

656
00:46:09,463 --> 00:46:12,864
Enough! "Did they probe me?"

657
00:46:13,033 --> 00:46:15,831
Too many questions!
You don't have enough pebbles, fool.

658
00:46:16,336 --> 00:46:18,201
You haven't answered
any of my questions.

659
00:46:18,372 --> 00:46:21,967
- How many questions he got?
- We've all got stuff to ask!

660
00:46:26,313 --> 00:46:27,905
Enough!

661
00:46:29,416 --> 00:46:31,941
You bring this stranger before me.

662
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:36,681
He doubts my powers.
He compares me to a skua.

663
00:46:37,057 --> 00:46:39,048
The voices are shrieking in my head.

664
00:46:39,226 --> 00:46:42,127
They say, " Lovelace, who is this fool

665
00:46:42,562 --> 00:46:47,795
Tell him! Tell him to go forth
and multiply!"

666
00:46:48,035 --> 00:46:49,559
Come to think of it...

667
00:46:49,736 --> 00:46:53,502
...why don't we all go forth and multiply?

668
00:46:53,674 --> 00:46:55,835
- Lovelace.
- What he saying?

669
00:46:56,009 --> 00:46:57,806
- It 's mating season.
- Already?

670
00:46:57,978 --> 00:47:02,005
I will retire now
to my couch of perpetual indulgence.

671
00:47:02,182 --> 00:47:04,616
- Okay, ladies, who's first?
- Me!

672
00:47:04,785 --> 00:47:07,549
One at a time. Don't touch the talisman,
baby, please.

673
00:47:07,721 --> 00:47:10,986
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What about us?

674
00:47:11,158 --> 00:47:13,922
Lovelace, Lovelace, Lovelace!

675
00:47:14,094 --> 00:47:15,857
Hear me!

676
00:47:16,029 --> 00:47:18,054
There's not enough love in the world.

677
00:47:18,231 --> 00:47:20,290
Turn to the penguin next to you.

678
00:47:20,467 --> 00:47:22,867
Put your flippers up.
Fluff him up a little bit.

679
00:47:23,036 --> 00:47:25,504
And give him a great big hug.

680
00:47:25,672 --> 00:47:27,833
Okay, ladies.

681
00:47:28,008 --> 00:47:30,374
Oh, make that little noise again, girl.

682
00:47:32,512 --> 00:47:34,104
Hey, what he got we don't got, man?

683
00:47:34,281 --> 00:47:36,146
- What you hugging me for?
- He told me to.

684
00:47:36,316 --> 00:47:37,544
- Get away.
- No, you like it.

685
00:47:37,718 --> 00:47:38,742
Get off him, Ramon.

686
00:47:38,919 --> 00:47:40,910
Stretch, got any stones
where you come from?

687
00:47:41,088 --> 00:47:43,215
- We don't collect stones.
- You don't? Why not?

688
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:44,379
We live on the ice.

689
00:47:44,558 --> 00:47:46,355
So how you win the heart of the ladies?

690
00:47:46,526 --> 00:47:49,017
Well, we sing.

691
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:53,622
- Stop! That's crazy!
- You're kidding, right?

692
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,631
No. We sing to each other.

693
00:47:55,802 --> 00:47:58,794
If someone special likes your song,
you know...

694
00:47:58,972 --> 00:48:00,803
Oh, and you have someone special

695
00:48:00,974 --> 00:48:04,307
- A tall beauty in your dark romantic past?
- Of which you never speak?

696
00:48:04,478 --> 00:48:05,570
Well, sort of.

697
00:48:05,746 --> 00:48:08,544
Hey, let's go check it out.
Maybe she got some friends.

698
00:48:08,715 --> 00:48:09,704
Ilike them tall.

699
00:48:09,883 --> 00:48:11,282
It's never gonna work.

700
00:48:11,451 --> 00:48:13,214
- Hey, big guy.
- It 's the loving season.

701
00:48:13,387 --> 00:48:14,877
All you gotta do is sing.

702
00:48:15,055 --> 00:48:16,522
That's the problem. I can't.

703
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:19,158
- You a bird, ain't you?
- All birds can sing.

704
00:48:19,326 --> 00:48:21,590
I don't sing like the birdie do

705
00:48:22,829 --> 00:48:24,319
All right.

706
00:48:24,498 --> 00:48:26,056
Find me, Find me

707
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,264
What's he doing?

708
00:48:29,436 --> 00:48:32,166
- I think he's singing.
- I know singing, that's not singing.

709
00:48:34,207 --> 00:48:37,734
I heard an animal once do that,
but then they rolled him over, he was dead.

710
00:48:38,245 --> 00:48:41,737
Yeah. And when she sings,
it darn near breaks your heart.

711
00:48:41,915 --> 00:48:43,678
You in tragic shape, man.

712
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:46,011
- Don't worry. We can fix it.
- We can?

713
00:48:46,186 --> 00:48:48,347
- Absolutely. We can. We can.
- We can?

714
00:48:48,522 --> 00:48:50,956
- Really?
- Yes! Let me tell something to you.

715
00:48:51,124 --> 00:48:54,491
- Come close. Closer. You wanna sing?
- Yeah.

716
00:48:54,661 --> 00:48:56,151
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

717
00:48:56,329 --> 00:48:58,729
You making fun of me?
Then this is very easy.

718
00:48:58,899 --> 00:49:01,993
Really? Gosh, if I could sing,
that would change everything.

719
00:49:02,169 --> 00:49:06,367
You will sing. You just got to do
exactly what I say.

720
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,667
- Okay.
- Did I say "okay"?

721
00:49:08,842 --> 00:49:10,332
- No.
- No. What did I say?

722
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:14,037
- Do exactly what you say.
- Exactly what I say.

723
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:22,411
Don't push me
'Cause I' m cLOse to the edge

724
00:49:24,491 --> 00:49:28,757
I'm trying not to LOse my...

725
00:49:29,729 --> 00:49:31,287
GLOria

726
00:49:31,465 --> 00:49:33,660
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder

727
00:49:33,834 --> 00:49:35,062
How I keep From going under

728
00:49:35,235 --> 00:49:38,932
Midnight creeps so sLOwly

729
00:49:39,105 --> 00:49:45,567
Into hearts oF those
Who need more than they get

730
00:49:45,745 --> 00:49:49,977
Daylight deals a bad hand

731
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:55,816
To a penguin who has laid too many bets

732
00:49:56,323 --> 00:49:59,781
I'll make LOve to you
Like you want me to

733
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,895
And I' II hold you tight, baby, all...

734
00:50:03,063 --> 00:50:04,325
GLOria

735
00:50:04,498 --> 00:50:09,959
The mirror stares you in the Face

736
00:50:10,136 --> 00:50:11,967
And says, "baby..."

737
00:50:12,138 --> 00:50:13,366
Shake a bon-bon, Shake a...

738
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,007
It don't work

739
00:50:15,175 --> 00:50:20,306
You say your prayers
Though you don't care

740
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:26,544
You say your prayers
Though you don't care

741
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,211
Boys! Boys!

742
00:50:29,389 --> 00:50:31,289
Boys!

743
00:50:51,645 --> 00:50:52,634
Mumble?

744
00:50:58,318 --> 00:50:59,307
Mumble.

745
00:51:01,154 --> 00:51:03,714
Oh, hi, Gloria.

746
00:51:10,196 --> 00:51:11,823
And this is you?

747
00:51:13,133 --> 00:51:16,125
Sure, it's me. You like?

748
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:21,570
Well, I would, if it were really you, yeah.

749
00:51:22,676 --> 00:51:24,473
Well, it is me, sort of.

750
00:51:24,644 --> 00:51:26,339
Yeah.

751
00:51:26,513 --> 00:51:28,344
Turn around.

752
00:51:28,515 --> 00:51:30,073
- Turn around.
- Why?

753
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,309
- Well, why not?
- Well...

754
00:51:35,221 --> 00:51:36,654
- What do you know?
- Yeah.

00:51:36,823 --> 00:51:39,018
My way

756

- Gloria.
- Mumble, how could you?

757
00:51:43,263 --> 00:51:44,321
Hello.

758
00:51:44,497 --> 00:51:48,456
I know size can be daunting,
but don't be afraid. I love you.

759
00:51:48,635 --> 00:51:50,762

00:51:57,877 --> 00:51:59,105
- Stop it!
- Okay.

764
00:51:59,279 --> 00:52:02,442
Mumble, what could
you possibly be thinking?

765
00:52:02,616 --> 00:52:04,641
I don't know what else to do.

766
00:52:10,757 --> 00:52:12,418
Oh, Gloria, no.

767
00:52:12,592 --> 00:52:15,857

Gloria. Gloria.

772
00:52:28,475 --> 00:52:30,204
Sing to this.

773
00:52:32,646 --> 00:52:36,377
Mumble, you're embarrassing me.

774
00:52:42,622 --> 00:52:44,886
Baby... it don't work.

775
00:52:48,261 --> 00:52:49,922

To a penguin that has laid too many bets

781
00:53:22,796 --> 00:53:26,789

And says, "baby... it don't work"

783

You say your prayers
Though you don't care

784
00:53:35,141 --> 00:53:42,104
You sing and you shake the hurt

Dance!

To a penguin who has laid too many bets

793

The mirror stares you in the Face

794
00:54:19,886 --> 00:54:23,083
And says, "baby... it don't work"

Dance!

798
00:54:31,631 --> 00:54:32,723
Mumble!

799
00:54:32,899 --> 00:54:37,097
Boogie wonderland

800
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:39,170
Dance, dance, dance

801
00:54:39,339 --> 00:54:40,499
Mumble

802
00:54:40,673 --> 00:54:42,800
boogie wonderland

803
00:54:42,976 --> 00:54:45,501
Check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out

804
00:54:47,514 --> 00:54:49,072
My brothers

805
00:54:56,422 --> 00:54:59,323
You LOok so beautiFul to me, baby

806
00:55:08,868 --> 00:55:10,563
- Mumble.
- Hey, Miss Viola.

807
00:55:10,737 --> 00:55:16,369
- All the LOve in the world can't be gone
- Mumble!

808
00:55:16,543 --> 00:55:21,503
- All the need to be LOved can't be wrong
- Mumble!

809
00:55:21,681 --> 00:55:23,239
Disgraceful

810
00:55:24,918 --> 00:55:26,647
Who do they think they are?

811
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:30,415
Where is Noah?
This is getting out of hand.

812
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:32,382
Go!

813
00:55:36,663 --> 00:55:39,063
Hey, Memphis. It 's your boy, Mumble.

814
00:55:39,632 --> 00:55:42,465
- Mumble?
- Mumble?

815
00:55:42,635 --> 00:55:46,127
No, no. No, it's "Mambo." O!

816
00:55:46,306 --> 00:55:49,764
Baby. They're saying, "Mumble."

817
00:56:11,164 --> 00:56:12,188
Boogie!

818
00:56:12,465 --> 00:56:13,659
Behold, Noah, look!

819
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:19,829
This was an omen from the start
and now we have this uprising.

820
00:56:20,006 --> 00:56:23,533
Stop! Stop!

821
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:27,510
Stop this unruly nonsense!

822
00:56:29,682 --> 00:56:32,150
Stop it right now!

823
00:56:33,386 --> 00:56:35,820
Alittle self -control, if you please!

824
00:56:35,989 --> 00:56:40,688
You bring this disorder, this aberration,
to the very heart of our community.

825
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,122
Have you lost your minds?

826
00:56:42,295 --> 00:56:44,058
- We're just having fun.
- Harmless fun.

827
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:48,462
"Harmless"? It is this kind of backsliding
that has brought the scarcity upon us.

828
00:56:48,635 --> 00:56:51,160
Excuse me, smiley. Can you speak
plain penguin, please?

829
00:56:51,337 --> 00:56:53,999
He thinks the food shortage
has something to do with me.

830
00:56:54,173 --> 00:56:57,836
Do you not understand that we can
only survive here when we're in harmony?

831
00:56:58,011 --> 00:57:01,242
When you and your foreign friends
lead us into your easy ways...

832
00:57:01,414 --> 00:57:03,041
...you offend the Great 'Guin.

833
00:57:03,216 --> 00:57:05,150
You invite him to withhold his bounty.

834
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:08,913
- He rules the seasons.
- He giveth and he can taketh away.

835
00:57:09,088 --> 00:57:11,579
Wait a minute.
Happy feet can't cause a famine.

836
00:57:11,758 --> 00:57:15,353
If thy kind of pagan display
did not cause it, then what did?

837
00:57:15,528 --> 00:57:17,826
I think it comes from outside.
Way beyond the ice.

838
00:57:17,997 --> 00:57:20,329
There are things out there,
things we don't understand.

839
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,161
- Mysteries.
- Mind-boggling mysteries.

840
00:57:22,335 --> 00:57:23,734
- Mystic beings.
- Yeah, aliens.

841
00:57:23,903 --> 00:57:25,530
- He's mad.
- No, aliens.

842
00:57:25,705 --> 00:57:27,366
- I hear they're smart.
- He's insane.

843
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,168
No, they might be smarter than all of us.
Who knows?

844
00:57:30,343 --> 00:57:32,743
He drove the fish away,
now he's ranting this rubbish!

845
00:57:32,912 --> 00:57:36,177
- Hey, let me tell something to you.
- Don't touch me, you filthy vermin.

846
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:38,180
- Hey, watch it.
- And so it follows.

847
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:41,843
Dissent leads to division
and division leads us to doom.

848
00:57:42,021 --> 00:57:45,081
- You, Mumble Happy Feet, must go.
- Hear, hear.

849
00:57:45,258 --> 00:57:47,692
Don't you take one step, sweetheart.

850
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:51,352
You have as much right to be here
as any of these daffy old fools.

851
00:57:52,198 --> 00:57:54,792
Norma Jean, I' II deal with this.

852
00:57:54,968 --> 00:57:56,435
Pa?

853
00:57:58,805 --> 00:58:01,797
Mumble, you must renounce
your so-called friends...

854
00:58:01,975 --> 00:58:04,000
...your peculiar thoughts,
your strange ways.

855
00:58:04,177 --> 00:58:05,542
- Memphis.
- Lf we are devout...

856
00:58:05,712 --> 00:58:07,839
...sincere in our praise,
the fish will return.

857
00:58:08,014 --> 00:58:11,279
- But, Pa...
- Listen, boy, I was a backslider myself.

858
00:58:11,451 --> 00:58:13,715
I was careless
and now we're paying the price.

859
00:58:13,886 --> 00:58:15,478
What's this got to do with Mumble?

860
00:58:15,655 --> 00:58:18,590
- It 's why he is the way he is.
- There's nothing wrong with him!

861
00:58:18,758 --> 00:58:21,818
- Face it, our sors all messed up.
- He's not messed up, hear me?

862
00:58:21,995 --> 00:58:23,963
- Believe me, I know.
- How can you say that?

863
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:27,224
Because when he was just an egg,
I dropped him!

864
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,163
Memphis.

865
00:58:31,004 --> 00:58:32,562
Mumble.

866
00:58:34,874 --> 00:58:37,434
Oh, my poor little Mumble.

867
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:39,271
But, Mom, I' m perfectly fine.

868
00:58:39,445 --> 00:58:41,436
- No. No, you're not, boy.
- That's right.

869
00:58:41,614 --> 00:58:45,175
For all our sakes, you must stop
this freakiness with the feet.

870
00:58:45,351 --> 00:58:49,481
Your father speaks wisely.
Heed his suffering heart and repent.

871
00:58:49,655 --> 00:58:51,850
But it just doesn't make any sense.

872
00:58:52,025 --> 00:58:54,084
Then your arrogance leaves us no choice!

873
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,249
No, wait.

874
00:58:56,262 --> 00:59:00,528
Please, son, you can do this.
It ain't so hard.

875
00:59:02,468 --> 00:59:06,131
Don't ask me to change, Pa,
because I can't.

876
00:59:10,472 --> 00:59:14,374
And that, my brethren, is the end of it.

877
00:59:14,543 --> 00:59:16,443
You, begone!

878
00:59:19,381 --> 00:59:22,680
- Mumble.
- No, Ma, it's okay. It 's okay.

879
00:59:23,919 --> 00:59:26,581
Let me tell something to you.

880
00:59:26,755 --> 00:59:28,882
When I find out
what's happening to the fish...

881
00:59:29,758 --> 00:59:31,555
...I' II be back.

882
00:59:32,394 --> 00:59:34,021
Let me through? Let me through.

883
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:36,289
- Mumble, you don't have to go.
- Let it be.

884
00:59:36,464 --> 00:59:38,932
- Gloria.
- No. No, Dad, this isn't fair.

885
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,330
Gloria, listen to your father.

886
00:59:41,836 --> 00:59:47,399
My Folks were always putting him down

887
00:59:47,576 --> 00:59:50,443
Down, down, down

888
00:59:50,612 --> 00:59:54,878
They said he came
From the wrong side oF town

889
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:58,542
He came From the wrong side oF town

890
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,814
They told me he was bad

891
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:03,082
So bad

892
01:00:03,258 --> 01:00:07,194
- but I know he was sad
- So sad

893
01:00:07,362 --> 01:00:12,527
I'll never Forget him
The leader oF the pack

894
01:00:12,701 --> 01:00:16,535
We sing the heart
of our true friend, Mumble.

895
01:00:16,705 --> 01:00:22,701
You are a nation of peeny-weeny,
piffling, piccolini, piddly -diddly pouft!

896
01:00:23,945 --> 01:00:25,845
Together, we prevail.

897
01:00:26,014 --> 01:00:27,879
In the wisdoms, we trust.

898
01:00:28,049 --> 01:00:29,983
We trust.

899
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,953
Look out

900
01:00:35,123 --> 01:00:39,651
Look out

901
01:00:40,462 --> 01:00:43,431
Look out

902
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:48,228
Look

903
01:00:48,403 --> 01:00:52,499
Look out

904
01:00:56,177 --> 01:01:00,375
Don't worry, tall guy.
My father also called me a pitiful loser.

905
01:01:00,548 --> 01:01:01,674
Look how I turn out.

906
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:03,044
You're not helping, Ramon.

907
01:01:03,218 --> 01:01:06,915
He gonna be okay. All he gotta do
is find out what happened to the fish.

908
01:01:07,088 --> 01:01:09,056
- How he gonna do that?
- He think of something.

909
01:01:09,224 --> 01:01:11,215
- The aliens.
- What?

910
01:01:11,393 --> 01:01:14,226
- I' m gonna talk to the aliens.
- How you gonna find aliens?

911
01:01:14,396 --> 01:01:16,956
- Lovelace.
- He don't like you. He don't like you at all.

912
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:19,225
That's okay. I' II appeal
to his better nature.

913
01:01:19,401 --> 01:01:21,869
- How you gonna do that?
- Cruel and unusual punishment?

914
01:01:22,037 --> 01:01:24,528
- Unimaginable torture?
- Imaginable torture?

915
01:01:24,706 --> 01:01:26,901
- Your singing?
- No!

916
01:01:27,075 --> 01:01:29,407
"Can anybody Find me"...

917
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,473
- You're cracking the ice!
- Avalanche!

918
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,308
Yes, okay. Thank you.

919
01:01:44,726 --> 01:01:47,627
Lovelace. You there?

920
01:01:47,796 --> 01:01:49,923
Lovelace!

921
01:01:52,801 --> 01:01:54,598
Lovelace.

922
01:01:59,641 --> 01:02:01,268
Lovelace?

923
01:02:01,443 --> 01:02:02,774
Is this a bad time?

924
01:02:02,944 --> 01:02:04,878
I know we don't have
an appointment, but...

925
01:02:05,046 --> 01:02:07,173
Just one question and
I want a straight answer.

926
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:08,941
Where do I find the mystic beings?

927
01:02:11,786 --> 01:02:13,777
Why don't he speak?

928
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:18,418
Lovelace, you okay?

929
01:02:19,894 --> 01:02:23,091
- Boy, he's possessed.
- It 's a seizure! It 's a seizure!

930
01:02:23,264 --> 01:02:24,731
- Open the beak.
- Grab his tongue.

931
01:02:24,899 --> 01:02:27,493
He's choking. That thing
around his neck, it's too tight.

932
01:02:27,669 --> 01:02:30,297
- Well, why didn't you say so?
- On three.

933
01:02:30,472 --> 01:02:34,738
Stop! Listen! No! Amigos! Amigos! Stop!

934
01:02:34,909 --> 01:02:36,900
- What?
- You're hurting him.

935
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:40,447
Any better?

936
01:02:40,615 --> 01:02:43,140
Lovelace, how did you get
that thing around your neck?

937
01:02:43,318 --> 01:02:46,651
- It was bestowed on him.
- By the mystic beings.

938
01:02:46,821 --> 01:02:48,982
- They didn't bestow it?
- No.

939
01:02:49,157 --> 01:02:52,149
Oh, come on, he don't know
what he's saying.

940
01:02:52,327 --> 01:02:55,319
You were swimming
and it just got caught around your neck.

941
01:02:55,497 --> 01:02:58,398
Oh, no way. He the guru.

942
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:02,598
Lovelace, did you ever actually meet
a mystic being?

943
01:03:03,338 --> 01:03:04,965
Officially?

944
01:03:06,441 --> 01:03:07,430
No.

945
01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:09,543
I knew it! It 's all a lie.

946
01:03:09,711 --> 01:03:11,576
But this belongs to someone.

947
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,442
If we could find them,
I bet you they could take it off.

948
01:03:14,849 --> 01:03:19,081
Show me where you found it. I' m sure
they could help us. You and me both.

949
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,823
Two words, three syllables.

950
01:03:23,992 --> 01:03:25,789
- What is it?
- You're dying?

951
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:29,657
No, no, wait. Past, past, your past life.

952
01:03:29,831 --> 01:03:31,423
You're passing gas.

953
01:03:32,834 --> 01:03:34,825
Now he thinks he's an elephant seal.

954
01:03:35,003 --> 01:03:36,937
No, no, no. Go over the mountains.

955
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:40,040
- Go over the mountains!
- Through the land of the elephant seals.

956
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:44,804
- Beyond the land of the elephant seals.
- Beyond the land of the elephant seals!

957
01:03:55,757 --> 01:03:57,918
- Wait.
- What?

958
01:03:58,827 --> 01:04:00,818
I hear voices.

959
01:04:00,995 --> 01:04:02,656
- There is a voice.
- Where?

960
01:04:02,831 --> 01:04:06,392
- There's a little voice on the wind.
- Mumble!

961
01:04:06,568 --> 01:04:07,865
- "Mambo"?
- "Mambo"?

962
01:04:08,036 --> 01:04:09,469
- Listen.
- Mumble Happy Feet.

963
01:04:10,004 --> 01:04:11,232
- Gloria?
- Gloria!

964
01:04:11,406 --> 01:04:12,395
Gloria?

965
01:04:12,574 --> 01:04:15,099
Hey, you got a stalker.
She's obsessed with you, man.

966
01:04:18,713 --> 01:04:21,181
I can't believe it's you.

967
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:23,408
Of course it's me.

968
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:26,414
What are you doing here?

969
01:04:26,588 --> 01:04:29,785
All the LOve in the world can't be gone

970
01:04:29,958 --> 01:04:33,826
All the need to be LOved can't be wrong

971
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:36,725
- Oh, my.
- So which way, twinkletoes?

972
01:04:36,898 --> 01:04:40,265
No, no, no. If you come,
you may never get back home.

973
01:04:40,435 --> 01:04:41,800
Fine by me.

974
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:47,431
Gloria, you have a life back there.
I don't. I mean, we don't. Not out here.

975
01:04:47,609 --> 01:04:50,703
How can we keep an egg safe?
That's if we ever had an egg.

976
01:04:50,879 --> 01:04:53,473
Well, I don't need an egg to be happy.

977
01:04:53,648 --> 01:04:57,675
You say that now, but what about later
when all your friends have eggs?

978
01:04:59,053 --> 01:05:00,281
Then I' II have you.

979
01:05:01,723 --> 01:05:05,124
Now he's going to pledge
his soul forever.

980
01:05:05,293 --> 01:05:06,419
- Gloria.
- Here it comes.

981
01:05:06,594 --> 01:05:13,523
I'm a particular kind of guy,
the kind of guy who needs his own space.

982
01:05:13,801 --> 01:05:15,666
It's not you, it's me.

983
01:05:15,837 --> 01:05:18,271
I'm just not up for a serious relationship
right now.

984
01:05:18,439 --> 01:05:21,772
What he's trying to do now
is he's pushing her away. Let's watch.

985
01:05:21,943 --> 01:05:25,435
No matter what you say or do,
you're stuck with me.

986
01:05:25,613 --> 01:05:28,707
Oh, come on. As if you're not
totally thrilled that I' m here.

987
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:32,341
- Now she got him on the ropes.
- See, right there is your problem.

988
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,420
You think you're irresistible, don't you?

989
01:05:34,589 --> 01:05:36,921
I don't care where you're from,
that's got to hurt.

990
01:05:37,091 --> 01:05:39,821
- Excuse me?
- Gloria's so gorgeous, Gloria's so talented.

991
01:05:39,994 --> 01:05:40,983
What?

992
01:05:41,162 --> 01:05:43,562
Just because
you can hit a few high notes.

993
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,858
You got a problem with my singing?

994
01:05:46,034 --> 01:05:48,264
No, it's perfectly fine.

995
01:05:48,436 --> 01:05:50,301
- "Fine"?
- Lf you like that sort of thing.

996
01:05:50,471 --> 01:05:53,065
- It 's a little Nana Tootsie for my taste.
- What?

997
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:55,368
You know, showy, flashy, froufrou.

998
01:05:55,543 --> 01:05:57,033
- "Froufrou"?
- That's right.

999
01:05:57,211 --> 01:06:01,341
Coming from someone who thinks it's cool
to jig up and down really fast on the spot...

1000
01:06:01,516 --> 01:06:03,780
...like some twitchy idiot.

1001
01:06:07,555 --> 01:06:10,183
You stubborn, hippity-hoppity fool

1002
01:06:10,358 --> 01:06:12,223
Right back at you.

1003
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:25,061
Amigo, that was a good thing you do.

1004
01:06:25,239 --> 01:06:27,503
She is going to be so much better off
without you.

1005
01:06:27,675 --> 01:06:30,803
She is going to find a good, steady guy
to comfort her...

1006
01:06:30,979 --> 01:06:34,176
...and love her up real good
and raise a big family.

1007
01:06:34,349 --> 01:06:36,579
- Ramon.
- And then she's going to let herself go...

1008
01:06:36,751 --> 01:06:39,879
Ramon. He's hurting. He's hurting bad.

1009
01:06:40,054 --> 01:06:44,718
Oh, listen, listen, don't hold it in
or you explode. You got to let it out.

1010
01:06:44,892 --> 01:06:47,588
You just let it out. You let it out.

1011
01:06:47,762 --> 01:06:50,629
Everybody, turn away for a moment.

1012
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:53,096
If she leave him now

1013
01:06:53,267 --> 01:06:58,466
She take away the biggest part oF him

1014
01:07:00,842 --> 01:07:02,776
Don't, baby, please, don't go

1015
01:07:02,944 --> 01:07:04,809
Please, guys.

1016
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:06,970
No more singing.

1017
01:07:17,558 --> 01:07:20,220
Then she say to me, " Enough,
you are making me nauseous."

1018
01:07:20,395 --> 01:07:24,126
So I become silent, almost moody,
and you know what she says?

1019
01:07:24,298 --> 01:07:26,357
"You never share. You got to let it out."

1020
01:07:26,534 --> 01:07:29,298
- Ramon, come on.
- Let it out. Let it out.

1021
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:30,903
Stop it! Let it go.

1022
01:07:31,072 --> 01:07:34,735
- I never had a good relationship in my life.
- Give him a hug. Give him a hug.

1023
01:07:34,909 --> 01:07:36,137
- I let it out!
- There we go.

1024
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:38,870
- I let it out.
- I know. Get over it.

1025
01:07:39,047 --> 01:07:41,845
- Can you keep going?
- Yeah.

1026
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:45,213
- What's that smell?
- It wasrt me.

1027
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:50,120
Hey, Fluffy, we're following you.
Get up here.

1028
01:07:58,266 --> 01:08:02,327
So these elephant seals,
they're not penguin eaters, are they?

1029
01:08:02,503 --> 01:08:04,903
I don't know.
I believe they are herbivores.

1030
01:08:05,073 --> 01:08:06,938
- What?
- You know, kelp -suckers.

1031
01:08:07,108 --> 01:08:09,440
Here we go, Lovelace. Come on.

1032
01:08:11,112 --> 01:08:12,977
Jump in time. Jump in time.

1033
01:08:13,147 --> 01:08:15,911
- Okay, let's do it.
- Okay, okay, okay. Ready?

1034
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,520
I can do this. I can do this.
I got to trick myself.

1035
01:08:21,689 --> 01:08:23,589
Boy, look at that. What?

1036
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:44,102
You blokes better be lost,
because trespassing's a crime.

1037
01:08:44,278 --> 01:08:48,271
- We're just passing through.
- Yeah. We're with him.

1038
01:08:48,883 --> 01:08:51,351
You wouldn't be heading
over them distant hills...

1039
01:08:51,519 --> 01:08:53,453
...and through the blizzard country?

1040
01:08:53,621 --> 01:08:56,419
If it's the only way
to the forbidden shore, yeah.

1041
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:57,785
Crikey.

1042
01:08:57,959 --> 01:09:01,451
You might come face to face
with an annihilator.

1043
01:09:01,629 --> 01:09:02,653
An alien annihilator?

1044
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:05,765
Too right. Cut you up
as soon as look at you.

1045
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,959
Waste every living thing in their path.

1046
01:09:09,137 --> 01:09:10,798
Could they be annihilating the fish?

1047
01:09:10,972 --> 01:09:12,564
Every living thing.

1048
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:15,208
Merciless, mate. Merciless.

1049
01:09:15,376 --> 01:09:17,674
Even if you're a whopping great whale...

1050
01:09:17,845 --> 01:09:20,507
...they drag your sorry carcass ashore...

1051
01:09:20,681 --> 01:09:26,381
...dice you up, melt you down,
and turn you into fun food.

1052
01:09:26,554 --> 01:09:28,818
One day you're a big old whale...

1053
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:31,288
...next minute...

1054
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:32,858
...fun food.

1055
01:09:33,027 --> 01:09:34,460
Someone's gotta stop them.

1056
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:37,120
Oh, yeah? What's gonna be
your approach?

1057
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,323
If I could just talk to them.

1058
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:40,990
Appeal to their better nature.

1059
01:09:41,169 --> 01:09:42,158
Beauty.

1060
01:09:42,336 --> 01:09:47,933
When that crafty little trick pays off,
you be sure to let us know, won't you?

1061
01:09:48,109 --> 01:09:50,976
All right, Lovelace, let's go.

1062
01:09:53,214 --> 01:09:55,307
See you, Lovelace.

1063
01:09:57,752 --> 01:10:00,186
Your funeral, mate.

1064
01:10:48,002 --> 01:10:50,562
Oh, man!

1065
01:10:51,606 --> 01:10:54,336
- Push tight.
- Okay.

1066
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:11,151
Come on, guys. Let's do it.

1067
01:11:11,325 --> 01:11:15,227
You can do it. Come on, push!

1068
01:11:59,473 --> 01:12:01,498
What's that noise?

1069
01:12:03,044 --> 01:12:04,238
There's no noise.

1070
01:12:04,412 --> 01:12:06,972
- No gasping. No wheezing.
- Where's Lovelace?

1071
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:13,817
Sometimes a brave penguin
will just slip away to die.

1072
01:12:13,988 --> 01:12:15,922
Do you think he went to a happy place?

1073
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:19,685
- Probably.
- No, no. I think he went this way.

1074
01:12:31,739 --> 01:12:34,230
Come on. Let's go.

1075
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:52,725
Lovelace!

1076
01:12:53,894 --> 01:12:56,385
Lovelace!

1077
01:13:02,436 --> 01:13:04,267
Hello?

1078
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:07,072
Is there anyone there?

1079
01:13:07,241 --> 01:13:10,836
- No... No need to shout.
- Somebody might hear you.

1080
01:13:16,484 --> 01:13:18,247
His feet don't look too good.

1081
01:13:18,419 --> 01:13:21,013
- He rested here.
- Now he's on his belly!

1082
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:23,748
- No, this way.
- You don't want to know what he did here.

1083
01:13:23,924 --> 01:13:26,154
- You're right.
- There he is. Lovelace!

1084
01:13:26,327 --> 01:13:29,626
- All right! Lovelace!
- Lovelace!

1085
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,163
- Oh, look at Lovelace.
- We're here.

1086
01:13:34,335 --> 01:13:37,896
- Are you okay?
- Come on, man. Hang in there, buddy.

1087
01:13:38,773 --> 01:13:40,400
What is it?

1088
01:13:40,574 --> 01:13:43,839
Oh, look. There's one for everyone.

1089
01:13:44,011 --> 01:13:46,536
Hang in there, Lovelace.
I know they're here somewhere.

1090
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:49,239
- Why would they leave all this behind?
- I don't know.

1091
01:13:50,251 --> 01:13:51,240
Hey.

1092
01:13:51,419 --> 01:13:53,683
- Tell them we come in peace.
- We come in peace!

1093
01:13:53,854 --> 01:13:55,378
- Lovelace.
- Lovelace.

1094
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:57,023
- Lovelace.
- Oh, buddy, come on.

1095
01:13:57,191 --> 01:13:59,250
- Are you okay?
- Hang in there, buddy.

1096
01:14:01,862 --> 01:14:04,330
- Oh, that's not good.
- Stay calm.

1097
01:14:04,498 --> 01:14:05,795
- Stay calm.
- That's not good.

1098
01:14:05,966 --> 01:14:08,560
- Okay, don't stay calm!
- Panic!

1099
01:14:15,276 --> 01:14:17,244
Oh, no, no!

1100
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,374
- Oh, they're making us appe-teasers.
- They're appe-teasing us!

1101
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:24,677
We're all gonna die.

1102
01:14:25,953 --> 01:14:27,818
Whatever you do, stay out of the water!

1103
01:14:27,988 --> 01:14:30,115
- Stay out of the water.
- Don't go in the water!

1104
01:14:30,291 --> 01:14:32,987
Lovelace, don't go in the water!

1105
01:14:38,833 --> 01:14:40,357
Lovelace, hang in there!

1106
01:14:40,534 --> 01:14:42,434
Hang in there!

1107
01:14:43,804 --> 01:14:46,796
Get your dirty tongue off him!

1108
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:51,110
No, no, no!

1109
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:52,745
Stay out of the water!

1110
01:14:52,913 --> 01:14:54,608
- Mumble!

1111
01:15:24,879 --> 01:15:29,475
- They playing birdminton?
- No, it's a show. Dinner and a show.

1112
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,680
Lovelace!

1113
01:15:41,195 --> 01:15:43,186
Rejoice!

1114
01:15:51,605 --> 01:15:52,799
Lovelace!

1115
01:15:52,973 --> 01:15:55,032
- Help!

1116
01:15:55,209 --> 01:15:57,040
Thank you, my brother, thank you!

1117
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:09,887
I wasrt scared! I wasrt scared!

1118
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:14,627
Oh, my beautiful brother, thank you,

1119
01:16:18,799 --> 01:16:21,768
- Go, Lovelace! You the man!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

1120
01:16:21,936 --> 01:16:24,404
Enough!

1121
01:16:24,572 --> 01:16:26,665
It's a bad day for you!

1122
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,899
You dealing with Lovelace now!

1123
01:16:29,076 --> 01:16:31,738
- And my man, Mumble, here.
- You tell them, Lovelace.

1124
01:16:31,912 --> 01:16:34,676
Begone, demon fish. Adios.

1125
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:37,710
That's right.

1126
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:39,648
You hightail it back to your mamas.

1127
01:16:39,954 --> 01:16:42,013
- How did he do that?
- Don't make me come in the water.

1128
01:16:42,189 --> 01:16:44,123
I'll come after your sons and daughters.

1129
01:16:44,291 --> 01:16:46,282
I'm gonna give you the bad eye.

1130
01:17:40,581 --> 01:17:41,912
A whole bunch of them.

1131
01:17:42,082 --> 01:17:44,710
They gonna rule the world.

1132
01:17:44,885 --> 01:17:45,874
It's gotta be them.

1133
01:17:46,053 --> 01:17:49,318
- Lf it is, I don't wanna know about it.
- They don't even know we exist.

1134
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:50,821
Let me tell something to you.

1135
01:17:50,991 --> 01:17:53,983
This is the end of the road. It 's over.

1136
01:17:54,161 --> 01:17:57,062
You did everything penguinly possible.

1137
01:17:57,231 --> 01:17:59,699
- You found the aliens.
- We gonna testify to that.

1138
01:17:59,867 --> 01:18:03,234
We'll tell your whole laughing-boy nation
they were dead wrong about you.

1139
01:18:03,404 --> 01:18:05,201
Now, let's all go back home. Right now.

1140
01:18:05,372 --> 01:18:06,737
Right on.

1141
01:18:06,907 --> 01:18:08,499
- Could I ask a favor of you?
- Sure.

1142
01:18:08,676 --> 01:18:11,236
- What kind of favor?
- Could you make sure Gloria's okay?

1143
01:18:11,412 --> 01:18:12,777
- And my ma.
- What?

1144
01:18:12,946 --> 01:18:14,538
And if you see Pa...

1145
01:18:14,715 --> 01:18:17,582
...tell him I tried.

1146
01:18:17,751 --> 01:18:19,241
Okay, what you talking about?

1147
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:21,183
I'm gonna stop them taking our fish.

1148
01:18:21,355 --> 01:18:22,913
How you gonna do that, Mumble?

1149
01:18:25,292 --> 01:18:28,352
Adios, amigos!

1150
01:18:28,696 --> 01:18:30,186
Amigo! He did it.

1151
01:18:53,754 --> 01:18:54,778
You believe that?

1152
01:18:54,955 --> 01:18:58,516
How we gonna tell his mama
he bring us all this way just to kill himself?

1153
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:01,456
No. He didn't. Look.

1154
01:19:02,296 --> 01:19:04,059
He loco maniac.

1155
01:19:04,231 --> 01:19:07,166
First ever flying flipper bird.

1156
01:19:07,334 --> 01:19:09,495
How tall you think that tall boy was?

1157
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:12,833
Who could say? Taller than anyone.

1158
01:19:13,006 --> 01:19:16,942
Hey, it's me, Lovelace...

1159
01:19:17,111 --> 01:19:19,511
...formerly known as "guru."

1160
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,672
I'm gonna be telling your story,
Happy Feet...

1161
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:26,718
...long after you dead and gone!

1162
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:46,001
Hey! Hey!

1163
01:20:36,156 --> 01:20:38,852
Enraged by their indiFFerence...

1164
01:20:39,026 --> 01:20:44,362
...he Followed them LOng aFter
they were gone From his sight.

1165
01:20:46,533 --> 01:20:50,765
He ventured Further
than any oF us had gone beFore...

1166
01:20:50,938 --> 01:20:54,772
...beyond all hope oF return.

1167
01:20:55,709 --> 01:20:58,143
Swept up by the great currents...

1168
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:02,976
...he was carried endlessly
across vast oceans...

1169
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:06,847
...to worlds unknown.

1170
01:22:03,143 --> 01:22:05,907
Excuse me. What is this place?

1171
01:22:06,079 --> 01:22:09,071
You're in heaven, Dave. Penguin heaven.

1172
01:22:09,249 --> 01:22:11,240
Is it anywhere near Emperor Land?

1173
01:22:11,418 --> 01:22:14,216
It's wherever you want it to be.

1174
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:19,082
Try the water, Dave. It 's really real.

1175
01:22:35,175 --> 01:22:39,544
I heard tell,
when he Finally saw aliens up cLOse...

1176
01:22:39,713 --> 01:22:43,911
...they were just as the skua
had described.

1177
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:46,712
Excuse me. Why are you taking our fish?

1178
01:22:46,887 --> 01:22:52,189
Big, ugly penguins without Feathers
on their Fat, Flabby Faces.

1179
01:22:52,359 --> 01:22:58,093
Why are you taking our fish?
You're kind of killing us out there.

1180
01:23:00,467 --> 01:23:02,560
No! No, wait!

1181
01:23:12,179 --> 01:23:14,147
Oh, my.

1182
01:23:15,215 --> 01:23:19,379
Hello. Hello from Emperor Land.
Good afternoon.

1183
01:23:19,553 --> 01:23:21,316
Why are you taking our fish?

1184
01:23:21,488 --> 01:23:25,925
I'm sure you don't mean to,
but you're causing an awful lot of grief.

1185
01:23:26,927 --> 01:23:30,920
Am I not making myself clear?
I'm speaking plain penguin.

1186
01:23:31,832 --> 01:23:35,393
Penguin! Don't you understand?
You're stealing our fish.

1187
01:23:39,673 --> 01:23:42,403
Oh, please, anyone, talk to me!

1188
01:23:42,576 --> 01:23:44,806
For pity's sake, you're stealing our F-l-S...

1189
01:23:49,583 --> 01:23:54,350
AFter three days, he would LOse his voice.

1190
01:23:54,521 --> 01:23:56,955
AFter three months...

1191
01:23:58,925 --> 01:24:03,055
...he would all but LOse his mind.

1192
01:24:15,475 --> 01:24:18,444
So you found the fish, baby.

1193
01:24:19,546 --> 01:24:21,207
Ma?

1194
01:24:21,381 --> 01:24:22,678
- Hi, sweetie.
- Ma.

1195
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:27,252
Fluffy, no matter what they say or do,
we never stopped believing in you.

1196
01:24:27,421 --> 01:24:29,514
So you'll be back soon, right?

1197
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:31,317
Hey, come on. Let him eat.

1198
01:24:31,491 --> 01:24:33,482
Go ahead, Dave. Don't mind us.

1199
01:24:33,994 --> 01:24:35,461
But there's plenty for everyone.

1200
01:24:35,629 --> 01:24:37,927
It's okay, sugar. We can wait.

1201
01:24:38,098 --> 01:24:39,929
No, no, Ma! Ma!

1202
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:43,501
There's lots here. Ma!

1203
01:24:47,441 --> 01:24:49,033
Ma!

1204
01:27:09,249 --> 01:27:11,945
- Kids, you gotta see this.
- He's on now.

1205
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:36,073
Hey! Hello!

1206
01:27:38,511 --> 01:27:41,071
- Isn't that the fellow with the wacky feet?
- Looks like.

1207
01:27:41,248 --> 01:27:43,546
- What was his name?
- I thought he was dead.

1208
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:45,116
- Everybody...
- Apparently not.

1209
01:27:45,285 --> 01:27:48,220
Everybody, listen up! I' ve got big news.

1210
01:27:48,555 --> 01:27:50,546
I know who's taking the fish!

1211
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:53,192
- Yeah, and they took his brain.
- It 's the aliens.

1212
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,624
- I made contact with them.
- The lunatic is back.

1213
01:27:55,795 --> 01:27:57,786
The aliens are taking our fish.

1214
01:27:57,964 --> 01:28:00,023
Someone ought to fetch
Noah and the elders.

1215
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:01,497
Hey, you.

1216
01:28:02,068 --> 01:28:03,626
Gloria.

1217
01:28:03,803 --> 01:28:05,896
Kind of weird, seeing you again.

1218
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:07,395
Yeah.

1219
01:28:07,574 --> 01:28:09,940
- Everything cool here, baby?
- You remember Seymour.

1220
01:28:10,110 --> 01:28:11,407
Yeah. Hi, Seymour.

1221
01:28:11,578 --> 01:28:13,068
Yeah.

1222
01:28:14,381 --> 01:28:16,110
So which one is yours?

1223
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:18,612
All of them.

1224
01:28:20,987 --> 01:28:25,117
This is our singing class.
He teaches rhythm. I teach the blues.

1225
01:28:25,292 --> 01:28:27,886
- So you're not...?
- I guess I never heard the right song.

1226
01:28:28,061 --> 01:28:31,189
That's great! I didn't mean...

1227
01:28:31,531 --> 01:28:33,123
I found out who's taking the fish.

1228
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:35,427
They're big and kind of ugly,
but, Gloria...

1229
01:28:35,602 --> 01:28:37,900
...the things they can do.
They're coming here.

1230
01:28:38,071 --> 01:28:39,197
Oh, is that so?

1231
01:28:39,372 --> 01:28:41,772
They'll be here soon.
I think they wanna help us.

1232
01:28:41,942 --> 01:28:43,671
So now you speak with them?

1233
01:28:43,843 --> 01:28:47,040
Well, they don't speak penguin,
but they seem to respond to this.

1234
01:28:47,213 --> 01:28:49,272
- What's he doing?
- You gotta be kidding me.

1235
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:52,475
I suggest we all do it.
It really gets their attention.

1236
01:28:52,652 --> 01:28:53,983
And why would it do that?

1237
01:28:54,154 --> 01:28:57,055
Beats me, but it works.

1238
01:28:57,223 --> 01:29:00,090
- Hey, it's the hippity-hopper.
- Freaky feet!

1239
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:01,249
Boys, boys...

1240
01:29:01,428 --> 01:29:02,417
- Fluffy.
- Tall guy.

1241
01:29:02,595 --> 01:29:04,586
- Stretch!
- Amigo!

1242
01:29:08,201 --> 01:29:11,068
So you dare come back?

1243
01:29:11,371 --> 01:29:13,965
He says he's found aliens
and they're taking our fish.

1244
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:16,665
He says that they're coming
and we all have to do this.

1245
01:29:18,144 --> 01:29:21,671
There be no such thing as aliens!

1246
01:29:23,783 --> 01:29:26,513
Mumble, turn around.

1247
01:29:29,656 --> 01:29:31,146
It's a disease.

1248
01:29:31,558 --> 01:29:33,253
Is that from them?

1249
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:38,124
Yeah. But don't be afraid.
I think it's a way to find me, that's all.

1250
01:29:38,298 --> 01:29:41,995
You led them here?
You turned them on your own kind?

1251
01:29:42,802 --> 01:29:46,704
Wait a second, you just said
there's no such thing as aliens.

1252
01:29:49,142 --> 01:29:51,269
Well, there's not.

1253
01:29:51,444 --> 01:29:55,073
But if there were, only a traitorous fool
would bring them here.

1254
01:29:55,248 --> 01:29:56,340
But they have to come.

1255
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:59,485
They're the ones taking our fish.
They can do something about it.

1256
01:29:59,652 --> 01:30:03,144
None but the Great 'Guin
has the power to give and take away.

1257
01:30:03,323 --> 01:30:07,783
The Great 'Guin didn't put things
out of whack, the aliens did.

1258
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:12,297
A fool returns this day
to mock our suffering.

1259
01:30:12,465 --> 01:30:16,595
We are starving
and he wants us to hippity-hop.

1260
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:19,705
So do we hold fast to our ways...

1261
01:30:19,873 --> 01:30:24,572
...or do we bend to the fetid fantasies
of a dancing fool

1262
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:36,082
Say, how does that feet thing go again?

1263
01:30:36,256 --> 01:30:37,814
Yeah, show us, Mumble.

1264
01:30:39,192 --> 01:30:41,251
Oh, it's really quite easy.

1265
01:30:41,428 --> 01:30:43,055
No, no!

1266
01:30:43,229 --> 01:30:44,560
No, you must resist!

1267
01:30:45,398 --> 01:30:47,093
That's right.

1268
01:30:47,467 --> 01:30:50,834
- Pointless nonsense.
- Resist! Stand your ground!

1269
01:30:51,004 --> 01:30:54,337
Stand your ground against this folly!

1270
01:31:00,113 --> 01:31:03,173
Raise your voices, brothers.

1271
01:31:03,349 --> 01:31:06,648
Cry out in defiance of this jiggity-joggity!

1272
01:31:06,820 --> 01:31:08,947
Show me what you got.

1273
01:31:11,758 --> 01:31:13,487
You got it.

1274
01:31:18,031 --> 01:31:19,464
Come on.

1275
01:31:19,632 --> 01:31:20,963
Work, work it.

1276
01:31:21,134 --> 01:31:24,228
Yes, yes! Call on the wisdoms!

1277
01:31:24,404 --> 01:31:26,133
Let the world tremble!

1278
01:31:26,573 --> 01:31:28,438
For when all others leave...

1279
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:30,473
...we remain!

1280
01:31:32,212 --> 01:31:33,839
Mumble! Mumble!

1281
01:31:34,013 --> 01:31:36,811
Mama? Amigos.

1282
01:31:38,184 --> 01:31:41,017
- Oh, Mama.
- Oh, my boy.

1283
01:31:41,187 --> 01:31:43,781
- My gorgeous boy.
- Oh, Mama.

1284
01:31:43,957 --> 01:31:46,084
- Look at him.
- You're so dazzling.

1285
01:31:46,259 --> 01:31:49,126
- Oh, Fluffy.
- We waited and waited for you.

1286
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:52,128
- Oh, yeah.
- Where's Pa?

1287
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:54,562
Believe me. You don't wanna see
your deadbeat dad.

1288
01:31:54,734 --> 01:31:56,793
- Your pa is sort of...
- What?

1289
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:59,268
Come on, I' II show you.

1290
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:10,445
Memphis?

1291
01:32:11,484 --> 01:32:12,917
Memphis?

1292
01:32:13,086 --> 01:32:14,576
Pa?

1293
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:20,118
Mumble?

1294
01:32:20,293 --> 01:32:22,284
Is it truly you?

1295
01:32:22,462 --> 01:32:24,794
Every last bit of me, Pa.

1296
01:32:28,968 --> 01:32:30,799
I thought...

1297
01:32:34,941 --> 01:32:36,431
Pa?

1298
01:32:40,046 --> 01:32:42,446
There ain't been one day...

1299
01:32:44,417 --> 01:32:49,047
...not one day, that I done right by you.

1300
01:32:53,393 --> 01:32:55,418
Oh, Pa.

1301
01:32:55,595 --> 01:32:57,460
Dance for him, Daddy.

1302
01:32:57,630 --> 01:32:59,621
Dance with your boy.

1303
01:33:02,969 --> 01:33:05,369
You'll have to forgive me.

1304
01:33:06,172 --> 01:33:09,232
The music's gone clean out of me.

1305
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:12,702
No, it hasn't.

1306
01:33:12,879 --> 01:33:16,679
It's just like singing with your body.

1307
01:33:16,849 --> 01:33:18,874
Come on, baby. We can do it.

1308
01:33:19,052 --> 01:33:20,610
Oh, Mama.

1309
01:33:20,787 --> 01:33:25,156
It's just one big old foot after the other.

1310
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:31,552
That's it.

1311
01:33:33,566 --> 01:33:35,397
Yeah.

1312
01:33:36,769 --> 01:33:39,602
- Yeah, see?
- Well, that feels good.

1313
01:33:44,844 --> 01:33:48,280
You don't have to be beautiFul

1314
01:33:48,715 --> 01:33:49,704
Yeah, Memphis.

1315
01:33:49,949 --> 01:33:51,576
To turn me on

1316
01:33:52,051 --> 01:33:53,040
Daddy.

1317
01:33:53,219 --> 01:33:57,246
I just need your body, baby

1318
01:33:57,423 --> 01:33:59,914
From dusk till dawn

1319
01:34:01,127 --> 01:34:04,858
You don't have to be rich to be my girl

1320
01:34:05,031 --> 01:34:09,024
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world

1321
01:34:09,202 --> 01:34:13,104
Ain't no particular song
I'm more compatible with

1322
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:17,937
I just want your extra time and your...

1323
01:34:38,264 --> 01:34:41,290
Holy flock!

1324
01:35:06,693 --> 01:35:09,127
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

1325
01:35:45,798 --> 01:35:48,164
I think you better dance now.

1326
01:36:41,721 --> 01:36:44,189
First, there was just one.
Now there's thousands.

1327
01:36:44,357 --> 01:36:47,053
- Are they trying to tell us something?
- What's the problem?

1328
01:36:47,226 --> 01:36:50,024
- We're messing with their food chain.
- We've gotta do something.

1329
01:36:50,196 --> 01:36:53,893
- We suggest a ban on all marine harvesting.
- Too much money. Too many jobs.

1330
01:36:55,802 --> 01:36:57,963
Why should we do anything at all?

1331
01:37:03,676 --> 01:37:07,043
They're just a bunch of flightless birds
at the bottom of the world.

1332
01:37:11,551 --> 01:37:13,883
I don't wanna live in a world
without penguins.

1333
01:37:14,053 --> 01:37:15,418
What are we gonna do about it?

1334
01:37:15,588 --> 01:37:17,249
Bang up the sign "No Fishing."

1335
01:37:19,025 --> 01:37:22,426
Is equal to the love...

1336
01:37:22,595 --> 01:37:23,994
...you make.

1337
01:37:28,067 --> 01:37:32,231
Oh, baby. Right on.

1338
01:37:44,750 --> 01:37:49,881
Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy-headed boy

1339
01:37:52,725 --> 01:37:54,192
It's like a jungle sometimes

1340
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:56,555
It makes me wonder
How I keep From going under

1341
01:37:58,498 --> 01:37:59,965
Bring it on! Go ahead!

1342
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:04,826
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing

1343
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:08,872
We were happy with
The joy the day would bring

1344
01:38:09,041 --> 01:38:12,204
I wish those days
Would come back once more

1345
01:38:12,378 --> 01:38:16,576
Come back those days, those days
Come back, don't go

1346
01:38:16,983 --> 01:38:19,645
Come here, babe. Come on back.

1347
01:38:19,819 --> 01:38:20,808
Come on back

1348
01:38:20,987 --> 01:38:22,614
- Come on back
- Come on back

1349
01:38:22,788 --> 01:38:25,279
- Come on back
- Come on back

1350
01:38:25,458 --> 01:38:27,653
I LOve them, I LOve them

1351
01:38:27,827 --> 01:38:28,987
I LOve them, I LOve them

1352
01:38:33,799 --> 01:38:36,927
Those days, those days
Those days, those days

1353
01:38:37,103 --> 01:38:42,598
Those days

1354
01:45:03,322 --> 01:45:06,314
