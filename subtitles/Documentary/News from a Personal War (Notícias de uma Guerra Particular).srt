<i>Then, we change our mind.
I never did.</i>

28
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:05,393
<i>I always wanted to be a policeman.</i>

<i>I feel like going

<i>Sometimes, I get here in
the morning and I'm scared.</i>

33
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:21,852
<i>But I always wanted the opportunity

<i>I ended up being

running from the police.

62
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:13,664
I wouldn't have to live
in the favela sometimes.

63
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:16,993
I could've been holding
a modest job,

I can't die of hunger.

70

This happens every day of the week.</i>

91
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:09,570
<i>Rain or shine, I have to get
out of bed and face the day.</i>

92
00:06:10,682 --> 00:06:16,746
I'm content with this because
I think of my kids' future.

93
00:06:16,955 --> 00:06:20,447
I see a lot of things
happening to other kids.

94

<i>The drug traffic has a good
and a bad side.</i>

101
00:06:54,826 --> 00:07:00,696
Because before there were dealers,
the police entered the favela

102
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:03,333
breaking down your door.

103
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:05,628
They'd come in and brake it all.

104
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:10,672
<i>When these guns entered
our community, because of the drugs,</i>

105
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:15,642
they forced the police
to come in more cautiously.

-This might lead to death.

<i>-They don't care if they'll die or kill.
-They have no fear.</i>

<i>All they want to do

<i>from this kind of violent

112

It's the good side of the guns.

113
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:46,774
Now, the negative side,
the cruel side of the guns

114
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:49,173
is that, when they come
to collect a debt,

115
00:07:49,381 --> 00:07:53,750
from people down
in the city or in our community,

116
00:07:53,952 --> 00:07:58,616
they don't care
if that person is a minor or not.

117
00:07:58,823 --> 00:08:01,656
If they can kill,
cut the person up,

118
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,988
and display the pieces
as an example,

119
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:09,724

means death, they are capable of this.

PAULO LINS - WRITER
Cocaine was a rich people's thing.

127
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:43,892
The poor didn't use it.
They would only touch marijuana.

128
00:08:44,602 --> 00:08:48,561
<i>There was a time, in the favela,
when people who snorted coke</i>

00:08:48,773 --> 00:08:52,402
<i>were considered rich.
It was a status drug.</i>

130
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:56,176
<i>When it left the rich people's
arena and reached the poor,</i>

<i>When it became lucrative,
it got violent.</i>

133
00:09:03,521 --> 00:09:06,490
There was a lot of money involved
and too many people trying to sell it.

134
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:08,522
They had to establish
their territory,

135
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:11,388
to defend their selling point.

136

<i>People have always died in the favela,

<i>The morgue would pick up the body.
It was normal.</i>

138
00:09:19,604 --> 00:09:22,129
<i>It happened within the favela.</i>

139
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,070
<i>It never got to here to
the rich people's area.</i>

140
00:09:25,276 --> 00:09:29,804
The media discovered the violence
when it left the favela,

141
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:32,073
when kidnapping started,
along with

<i>Then, stealing from your neighbor,</i>

The person wouldn't prosper.

00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:59,705
so everybody could make money.
There couldn't be this war

150
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:03,347
<i>in which blacks would kill blacks,
the poor would kill the poor.</i>

151
00:10:04,282 --> 00:10:07,342
The enemy, let 's put it this way,
would be the middle class,

152
00:10:07,552 --> 00:10:08,541
the government,
the businessmen,

153
00:10:08,753 --> 00:10:11,347
people from outside
the favela environment.

154
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:17,454
This was born with
the dictatorship.

155
00:10:17,662 --> 00:10:20,392
It grew because of the political
prisoners at Ilha Grande.

156
00:10:21,232 --> 00:10:22,995
<i>They locked up
5 or 6 political prisoners</i>

157
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:29,538
<i>with around 60 common prisoners</i>

158
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:33,199
thinking these 60 would dilute the 5.

159
00:10:33,411 --> 00:10:36,073
It was the opposite.
Those 5 dominated the 60 others.

160
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:42,777
They froze the war by teaching
them to form one command.

161
00:10:42,987 --> 00:10:44,181
They organized crime.

162
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:46,423
CARLOS GREGÓRIO, ''GORDO'' - THE
FOUNDATION OF ORGANIZED CRIME

163
00:10:46,624 --> 00:10:50,822
If a political prisoner
had a banana, he would share it.

164
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:52,360
If one could eat,
everybody could eat too.

165
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:55,158
If 10 of us couldn't eat,
nobody would eat.

166
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:58,494
That's where the idea was born.

167
00:10:58,703 --> 00:11:01,263
We began to think collectively.
We started to get organized

168
00:11:01,472 --> 00:11:04,600
<i>inside the prison to fight the crimes</i>

169
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:07,710
<i>committed against inmates by guards</i>

170
00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:10,540
<i>and by inmates who liked</i>

171
00:11:10,748 --> 00:11:13,842
<i>26th Pct ENCANTADO NEIGHBORHOOD
to prey on other inmates.</i>

172
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:21,986
<i>The project was
"Peace, Justice and Freedom".</i>

173
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:26,160
Peace: we wanted to live
in peace inside the prison.

174
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:30,357
Justice: we wanted justice
for all, a social justice.

175
00:11:30,568 --> 00:11:34,504
<i>The idea was to take all the
holes left by the government</i>

176
00:11:34,706 --> 00:11:37,140
<i>and fill them with the
Comando Vermelho.</i>

177
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:40,000
<i>What would it do?</i>

178
00:11:41,946 --> 00:11:44,676
The idea was to do everything
the government doesn't do.

179
00:11:45,283 --> 00:11:47,751
<i>Freedom: as everybody knows,</i>

180
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:50,716
<i>is getting out
of prison at any cost.</i>

181
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:54,024
We're with Comando Vermelho.

182
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:55,522
KLEBER - 23 YEARS OLD
Have you heard about it?

183
00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:57,422
Talk about it.

184
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:01,258
It's an organization of our own.
It's organized crime.

185
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:06,836
On the streets, all we do is for
our population, for our society.

186
00:12:07,138 --> 00:12:11,199
<i>We do it for our people,
a suffering and humble people.</i>

187
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:14,878
I was born in the favela.

188
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:18,412
I'd be lying if I said a resident
doesn't help me once in a while.

189
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:23,485
I'd be lying if I said we don't help
them. We also help them.

190
00:12:23,688 --> 00:12:28,318
This is an obligation we have.

191
00:12:28,793 --> 00:12:30,988
<i>If my daughter gets sick
in the middle of the night,</i>

192
00:12:31,195 --> 00:12:34,255
<i>...or I or Adão does...
-She's been helped many times.</i>

193
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:36,899
Sometimes,
I go to the drugstore.

194
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:39,968
I bring money to buy medicine,

195
00:12:40,171 --> 00:12:44,073
but it costs 3 times
the amount I have.

196
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:46,937
then I go over
to the dealers and say:

197
00:12:47,145 --> 00:12:49,375
''My daughter is sick.
I need to buy...''

198
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,174
They say: ''Where's the prescription?
Give it to me.''

199
00:12:52,383 --> 00:12:54,908
In a half-hour,
her medicine is here.

200
00:12:58,623 --> 00:13:03,151
We supply the needs
they have once in a while.

201
00:13:03,361 --> 00:13:08,697
Sometimes, they need
butane gas, medicine.

202
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,232
They have to ask for our help.

203
00:13:11,436 --> 00:13:13,666
Their shanty might be falling apart.

204
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:20,003
They ask us for some money
to buy construction material,

205
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:21,838
to buy cookies,

206
00:13:22,046 --> 00:13:25,174
to buy cigarettes even,

207
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:28,944
toilet paper, soap.

208
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,558
When Christmas comes,
they throw toys for us to catch.

209
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:39,457
-You'd die to get one.
-It's a lie!

210
00:13:39,664 --> 00:13:43,100
-I wouldn't wanna die!
-I think most people here

211
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:47,169
are on the dealers' side.

212
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:55,605
If a dweller dies,
we pay for the burial.

213
00:13:58,116 --> 00:14:00,209
THE COMBAT

214
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:08,684
<i>On April 20, I was able
to get early to headquarters.</i>

215
00:14:08,893 --> 00:14:11,953
<i>1st MILITARY POLICE BATTALION
l was on the building's veranda</i>

216
00:14:12,163 --> 00:14:13,460
<i>GUN TRAINING RANGE
I was looking at the favelas.</i>

217
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:16,861
<i>I noticed the tracer rounds
from one favela to the other.</i>

218
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:19,059
<i>It was a war between dealers,</i>

219
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,431
<i>who were using tracer ammo.</i>

220
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:24,540
<i>I thought:</i>

221
00:14:24,742 --> 00:14:27,905
<i>"In which other capital in the world,
which is not at war,</i>

222
00:14:28,112 --> 00:14:30,842
<i>can you see something like that?"</i>

223
00:14:31,048 --> 00:14:34,745
Rio de Janeiro is
not in a civil war.

224
00:14:34,952 --> 00:14:38,319
There's a war in the favelas,
between dealers and policemen,

225
00:14:38,523 --> 00:14:41,617
or between dealers
and other dealers.

226
00:14:41,926 --> 00:14:45,555
BOPE'S TRAINING FIELD

227
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:57,939
FAVELA COMBAT DRILL

228
00:15:04,482 --> 00:15:08,441
<i>During the last 6 months,
100°% of our missions were in favelas.</i>

229
00:15:08,653 --> 00:15:12,521
<i>There were 156 operations
involving confrontation</i>

230
00:15:12,723 --> 00:15:14,816
<i>and maybe the same number
without confrontation.</i>

231
00:15:15,092 --> 00:15:17,822
<i>During confrontations,
we exchanged fire</i>

232
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:19,826
<i>with heavily armed dealers.</i>

233
00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:22,056
<i>We've acquired an experience
in favela combat</i>

234
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:24,325
<i>that can't be matched in Brazil.</i>

235
00:15:24,535 --> 00:15:27,902
<i>This has made us
one of the most efficient</i>

236
00:15:28,105 --> 00:15:30,505
<i>urban combat units in the world.</i>

237
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:41,251
<i>We are certainly better
than any American soldier.</i>

238
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:46,947
<i>Our confrontations happen
within 10 meters, 15 meters.</i>

239
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:50,317
SOLDIER MILTON BOPE
Our combat is real.

240
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,125
<i>In the favela,
there are very narrow alleys.</i>

241
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,029
<i>It's rare to find a spot
where 2 shooters</i>

242
00:15:58,236 --> 00:16:02,070
<i>can work side by side.
The 1st man shoots kneeling down.</i>

243
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:06,676
<i>The second shoots over him,
using his back as support.</i>

244
00:16:06,878 --> 00:16:08,004
Attention!

245
00:16:08,212 --> 00:16:09,236
Fire!

246
00:16:18,756 --> 00:16:22,157
If I see the police, I try to run.
If I can't, I shoot.

247
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,191
For instance,
I'm here selling dope.

248
00:16:24,395 --> 00:16:26,989
If I see the police,
I try to escape.

249
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,690
<i>If I can't, I'll shoot.
I won't let them shoot me first.</i>

250
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:32,233
<i>I'll get them first.</i>

251
00:16:32,436 --> 00:16:35,530
<i>I won't let them hit me.
They'd kill me.</i>

252
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,605
<i>When we kill the enemy,
we use fireworks.</i>

253
00:16:38,242 --> 00:16:41,700
<i>We celebrate and everything.
We have a party.</i>

254
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:45,076
It's a victory.
Isn't that worth celebrating?

255
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:50,346
To kill the enemy is a victory.
Terceiro Comando, for example.

256
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,629
<i>As a minor, I escaped 14 times,</i>

257
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:01,730
<i>just from one detention
home called Padre Severino.</i>

258
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:05,833
From another one,
I escaped another 7 times.

259
00:17:06,037 --> 00:17:10,098
When I turned 18,
I was arrested by the 10th Precinct.

260
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:13,038
I stayed in jail for 9 months
and escaped.

261
00:17:13,244 --> 00:17:17,203
I was free for a month
and got arrested again.

262
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:21,613
I stayed in jail for another
6 months and escaped again.

263
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:26,984
Then, I was arrested and
sentenced to 9 years in prison.

264
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:28,954
They sent me to Polinter,

265
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,390
Água Santa, and so on.

266
00:17:31,596 --> 00:17:33,826
Then, I finally reached
the top security prison in Ilha Grande

267
00:17:34,031 --> 00:17:36,329
<i>I could only achieve
freedom by my own means,</i>

268
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:40,231
<i>and God's help,
this is by escaping again.</i>

269
00:17:40,438 --> 00:17:45,068
<i>I escaped for the 3rd time.
I was free for only a month.</i>

270
00:17:45,276 --> 00:17:48,712
I was arrested again
under other charges.

271
00:17:48,913 --> 00:17:52,508
I went to jail and suffered
all of that again.

272
00:17:52,717 --> 00:17:55,481
I spent another 2 years
or so in prison.

273
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:59,520
I was even angrier.
I wanted to lose my life.

274
00:17:59,724 --> 00:18:04,320
I tried to regain my freedom
and here I am, thank God.

275
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,464
What do you do
when you are working?

276
00:18:10,668 --> 00:18:13,603
LICO - 13 YEARS OLD
I watch for the cops.

277
00:18:13,804 --> 00:18:15,499
-Do you carry guns?
-What?

278
00:18:15,706 --> 00:18:18,436
-Have you carried guns?
-Yes.

279
00:18:18,643 --> 00:18:20,668
How about you?
How far did you get in school?

280
00:18:20,878 --> 00:18:23,506
LEANDRO - 14 YEARS OLD
I quit after the 3rd grade.

281
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:26,182
Can you read?

282
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:28,875
Not really. I get by.

283
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:30,984
How was your first mission?

284
00:18:31,188 --> 00:18:33,520
It was cool.

285
00:18:34,258 --> 00:18:37,091
-What did you do?
-I sold drugs.

286
00:18:37,862 --> 00:18:41,764
My first mission was robbery
on the streets.

287
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:45,299
What do you feel
when you do that?

288
00:18:45,503 --> 00:18:48,995
I feel the desire to steal
from the person.

289
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,904
-Are you afraid you'll die young?
-What?

290
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:57,513
-Are you afraid you'll die young?
-We're all going to die someday, right?

291
00:18:58,382 --> 00:19:01,943
<i>What makes a young
person go into that?</i>

292
00:19:02,086 --> 00:19:05,317
<i>This generation,
born in the favela,</i>

293
00:19:05,523 --> 00:19:09,823
<i>which is a third generation,
wants to prove itself</i>

294
00:19:10,027 --> 00:19:11,858
<i>for the entire city.</i>

295
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:14,563
I think the organization
offers that to them.

296
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:16,596
ITAMAR SILVA - COMMUNITY LEADER
It offers to the boy the respect he

297
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:22,330
doesn't get when he chooses to be
a delivery boy for a drugstore.

298
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:27,603
<i>When he opens the paper
and reads that, at a certain favela,</i>

299
00:19:27,812 --> 00:19:33,045
<i>a young man faced the police,
armed and wearing a ski mask.</i>

300
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:38,347
<i>This feeds the pride,
the power he believes he has</i>

301
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:42,993
<i>over a society that doesn't
recognize his true worth.</i>

302
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,495
<i>The heart beats stronger, right?</i>

303
00:19:48,699 --> 00:19:52,567
POLICE HEADQUARTERS
Somebody says he is a success

304
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,467
HÉLIO LUZ CHIEF OF POLICE - RIO
''Finally, one of us is somebody.

305
00:19:56,674 --> 00:19:58,801
One of us can buy
an expensive car.

306
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:00,943
One of us is able to have
5 women.

307
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:06,041
<i>One of our own made it in life."</i>

308
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:09,848
I felt like I was
the king of the world.

309
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:12,420
When was that?

310
00:20:12,623 --> 00:20:17,390
At the favela when I held
my first gun, I felt like that.

311
00:20:18,095 --> 00:20:19,392
Was it a good feeling?

312
00:20:19,597 --> 00:20:22,191
Yeah, sort of...
Women look at you.

313
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,560
They flirt with you.

314
00:20:27,238 --> 00:20:30,207
<i>Women, especially
from down in the city,</i>

315
00:20:30,407 --> 00:20:34,605
seem to be attracted by young men
with heavy guns.

316
00:20:34,812 --> 00:20:39,681
They go nuts!
They enter even the poorest shacks

317
00:20:39,884 --> 00:20:40,908
to go to bed with them.

318
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:43,643
Only men with guns are
entitled to go out

319
00:20:43,854 --> 00:20:46,687
with city girls.
If you don't carry a gun...

320
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:50,349
-They don't even look at you.
-They ignore you.

321
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:53,394
They are all blond and beautiful.

322
00:20:53,597 --> 00:20:57,260
The bigger the gun, the more
they want to get near them,

323
00:20:57,468 --> 00:20:59,459
<i>the more they want to participate.</i>

324
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,864
I don't starve.

325
00:21:01,205 --> 00:21:03,673
My family doesn't starve.

326
00:21:03,874 --> 00:21:06,069
I walk around with good clothes
because, in this line of business

327
00:21:06,277 --> 00:21:08,609
you have to look good.

328
00:21:09,446 --> 00:21:13,405
<i>-Which jeans do you wear?
-Toulon, Company.</i>

329
00:21:14,952 --> 00:21:17,079
T-shirt?

330
00:21:17,288 --> 00:21:19,722
TCK, Cyclone,

331
00:21:19,924 --> 00:21:22,415
Toulon or Company.

332
00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:25,094
What kind of tennis shoe
do you choose?

333
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:26,820
I choose Nike.

334
00:21:27,031 --> 00:21:30,262
-Which one?
-Nike, Reebok.

335
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:38,369
<i>If you had been born in the favela,
what would you be today?</i>

336
00:21:38,576 --> 00:21:41,044
<i>What options would I have?
If I got a job,</i>

337
00:21:41,812 --> 00:21:44,747
I would have to work
12 or 8 hours a day

338
00:21:44,949 --> 00:21:46,974
to make U$ 60 a month.

339
00:21:47,184 --> 00:21:50,278
If I was to get into drug dealing,

340
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:53,149
I'd make U$ 150 a week.

341
00:21:53,357 --> 00:21:55,086
So it's a good deal.

342
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:57,760
Don't you think so?
For anybody.

343
00:21:57,962 --> 00:22:02,023
It's not an option if you've never gone
hungry. But if you have, it's a job.

344
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,259
For the social outcast,
it is a good deal.

345
00:22:04,468 --> 00:22:07,869
People line up to get a job.

346
00:22:08,072 --> 00:22:11,132
<i>You might say it's not a job,
but it is.</i>

347
00:22:11,342 --> 00:22:13,333
<i>It's not an option, it's a job.</i>

348
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:16,138
<i>They make more money
then their fathers do.</i>

349
00:22:16,347 --> 00:22:17,712
<i>They're suicidal.</i>

350
00:22:17,915 --> 00:22:22,511
He watches his brother die,
his cousin die

351
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,212
because they were involved,
but he wants to get involved!

352
00:22:26,423 --> 00:22:27,617
Do you know why?

353
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:31,420
Because nobody wants this
meager salary anymore.

354
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:37,096
Drug dealing is a business,
an illegal business.

355
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:42,435
They occupy an area
left vacant by the government.

356
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,973
The government makes the favela
an area for outcasts.

357
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:48,736
The minimal wage is
U$ 60 a month?

358
00:22:48,946 --> 00:22:51,506
The drug dealers pay
the kid U$ 150 a week

359
00:22:51,715 --> 00:22:53,342
and that kid goes to work for them.

360
00:22:55,452 --> 00:22:58,148
<i>They will choose it, of course.</i>

361

PADRE SEVERINO INSTITUTE - FOR
JUVENILE DELINQUENTS 12 TO 18

362
00:23:03,227 --> 00:23:04,592
Hands.

363
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:08,026
Turn them.
Lift your arms.

364
00:23:08,232 --> 00:23:11,395
Lift your balls.

365
00:23:11,602 --> 00:23:13,536
Lift one leg.
Now, the other.

366
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:14,795
-Turn around.
-Open your hand.

367
00:23:15,005 --> 00:23:17,030
-Down.
-Turn. Open your mouth.

368
00:23:17,241 --> 00:23:20,108
-Get up. Open your mouth.
-Lift your tongue.

369
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:23,769
Hands towards
the ground and down.

370
00:23:23,981 --> 00:23:26,108
Get you clothes
and come to this side.

371
00:23:27,117 --> 00:23:30,382
FÁBIO - 16 YEARS OLD
I was arrested because of marijuana.

372
00:23:31,088 --> 00:23:34,819
-Do you work for the dealers?
-No. I just got in trouble.

373
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:40,055
Is this your first time in here?
Where do you live?

374
00:23:40,264 --> 00:23:44,200
I live at Nova Holanda.

375
00:23:44,735 --> 00:23:47,465
VINÍCIUS - 17 YEARS OLD
Who me? I was selling cocaine.

376
00:23:47,671 --> 00:23:49,298
-Do you work for the dealers?
-No.

377
00:23:49,506 --> 00:23:54,443
I got into this less
than 3 days ago.

378
00:23:55,112 --> 00:23:59,276
-Where did you sell it?
-At Morrinho.

379
00:24:01,418 --> 00:24:02,442
Is this your 1st time?

380
00:24:02,653 --> 00:24:04,712
NELSON 14 YEARS OLD
Yes, sir.

381
00:24:04,922 --> 00:24:07,618
-Why were you arrested?
-I was stealing.

382
00:24:07,825 --> 00:24:11,124
-Where do you live?
-On the streets.

383
00:24:14,398 --> 00:24:18,425
<i>When you are 18 and have a
clean rap sheet, will you stop?</i>

384
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:22,431
I intend to stay in the favela.

385
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:25,437
Would you like to get a job?

386
00:24:25,642 --> 00:24:27,371
I want a job dealing drugs.

387
00:24:27,578 --> 00:24:31,446
-Only dealing?
-I like the life.

388
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:35,750
Why did you get into this?

389
00:24:40,157 --> 00:24:43,285
I saw a lot of suffering.
The police always wants

390
00:24:43,494 --> 00:24:47,260
to beat people up. They have
no respect. They don't care

391
00:24:47,464 --> 00:24:51,525
if they come after the dealer
and get the worker.

392
00:24:51,735 --> 00:24:54,260
They can't do their job well.

393
00:24:56,206 --> 00:24:58,231
LAW ENFORCEMENT

394
00:25:00,477 --> 00:25:04,379
MAURINHO 16 YEARS OLD
The policemen arrested me.

395
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:06,208
They booked me and said
they were going to kill me.

396
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:07,714
They shot me in the leg.

397
00:25:07,918 --> 00:25:10,216
I was squatting down.

398
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:11,979
The policeman came
and said: ''Get up.''

399
00:25:12,189 --> 00:25:14,749
He pointed at my leg and shot it.

400
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:16,619
MAURO 15 YEARS OLD
When they get us, they take our money

401
00:25:16,827 --> 00:25:19,057
and give us trouble on top of it.

402
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:26,263
Everybody knows the biggest
crooks are not the criminals,

403
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:30,270
but the cops.
If a cop arrests me, for instance,

404
00:25:30,474 --> 00:25:35,878
he'll try to get money
not to take me to jail.

405
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,741
He's not making only his salary.

406
00:25:37,948 --> 00:25:43,284
If you had a good television
set or a good VCR,

407
00:25:43,487 --> 00:25:45,455
they would take it away.
They wouldn't even ask

408
00:25:45,656 --> 00:25:49,092
if you had proof that
you've bought it in a store.

409
00:25:49,293 --> 00:25:51,557
They'd say that it was stolen,

410
00:25:51,762 --> 00:25:54,424
<i>even when the owner
was an honest person.</i>

411
00:25:55,532 --> 00:25:59,332
I'll say to myself
The police are corrupt.

412
00:25:59,603 --> 00:26:05,473
<i>The institution was designed
to be violent and corrupt.</i>

413
00:26:05,676 --> 00:26:07,041
<i>And people think that's odd.</i>

414
00:26:07,244 --> 00:26:08,768
<i>Why do I say it was
designed that way?</i>

415
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:12,005
<i>Because it was created
to protect the State</i>

416
00:26:12,216 --> 00:26:13,444
<i>and the elite.</i>

417
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:18,019
I practice law enforcement
to protect and serve the status quo

418
00:26:18,222 --> 00:26:21,020
No beating around the bush.

419
00:26:21,225 --> 00:26:22,817
It keeps the favela under control.

420
00:26:23,026 --> 00:26:26,757
How do you keep 2 million
people under control,

421
00:26:26,964 --> 00:26:30,456
people who make US$ 60 a month,
when they make any?

422
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:33,830
How do you keep all
the underprivileged

423
00:26:34,037 --> 00:26:36,665
...under control and calm?
-With with repression?

424
00:26:36,874 --> 00:26:38,774
Of course!
How else would it be?

425
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:45,976
<i>When the policeman
climbs up to the favela,</i>

426
00:26:46,183 --> 00:26:49,084
he's prepared to be
aggressive with everybody:

427
00:26:49,286 --> 00:26:51,311
old people, kids...

428
00:26:51,522 --> 00:26:54,047
Once, I was inside my home
and the cop said:

429
00:26:54,258 --> 00:26:59,696
''Listen, I don't care if people
are crippled, blind or old;

430
00:26:59,897 --> 00:27:02,229
I'll just beat the
heck out of them.

431
00:27:02,432 --> 00:27:05,060
And I don't want anyone
to say anything.''

432
00:27:15,746 --> 00:27:19,614
<i>Sometimes, when a kid from
the community is arrested,</i>

433
00:27:19,816 --> 00:27:23,616
<i>instead of going back down
to take the kid to jail</i>

434
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,153
<i>they climb the favela's hill
even higher.</i>

435
00:27:32,396 --> 00:27:37,800
<i>The women, mother, cousins,
sisters, have to follow</i>

436
00:27:38,001 --> 00:27:40,970
<i>to stop anything from happening.</i>

437
00:27:41,171 --> 00:27:44,299
<i>By then, everybody thinks
the boy is facing</i>

438
00:27:44,508 --> 00:27:47,102
<i>some form of aggression
or even execution.</i>

439
00:28:11,034 --> 00:28:13,730
<i>We follow them, we fight, we cry.</i>

440
00:28:13,937 --> 00:28:16,371
<i>They push us around
and ask us to step back.</i>

441
00:28:16,573 --> 00:28:20,373
<i>We don't, because we know
what will happen.</i>

442
00:28:34,391 --> 00:28:36,552
<i>Then, we stick to them.</i>

443
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,888
<i>That way, they can't have
a moment alone with the boy</i>

444
00:28:40,097 --> 00:28:43,032
<i>and nothing will happen to him.</i>

445
00:28:57,247 --> 00:29:00,307
<i>They end upcoming
down with the boy,</i>

446
00:29:00,517 --> 00:29:06,012
<i>taking him to the precinct
to see if he's really guilty.</i>

447
00:29:13,964 --> 00:29:18,367
<i>Sometimes, cops don't come
to arrest. They come to kill.</i>

448
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,407
<i>It's a political police.</i>

449
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,873
<i>This is an unfair society.</i>

450
00:29:32,082 --> 00:29:34,983
<i>We are here to protect
this unfair society.</i>

451
00:29:35,185 --> 00:29:36,584
<i>The underprivileged is under control.</i>

452
00:29:36,787 --> 00:29:39,119
<i>He'll pay if he gets uncontrollable.</i>

453
00:29:48,065 --> 00:29:50,158
<i>At the favela,
things are very sophisticated.</i>

454
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:53,859
<i>In South Africa, they put up
barbed wire. Here, we don't.</i>

455
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:56,904
<i>"Don't complain.
Pay your taxes."</i>

456
00:29:58,975 --> 00:30:00,704
People are used to it.

457
00:30:02,646 --> 00:30:05,479
<i>They conform to it.</i>

458
00:30:09,553 --> 00:30:12,021
<i>The poor have TV sets
and watch them.</i>

459
00:30:12,222 --> 00:30:13,985
<i>When the soap opera is over,
they turn it off,</i>

460
00:30:14,191 --> 00:30:15,818
<i>and look at the favela</i>

461
00:30:16,026 --> 00:30:17,459
<i>What are they supposed
to reproduce?</i>

462
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:21,960
There are not violent.
They stay inside.

463
00:30:22,165 --> 00:30:25,601
They are so stupid
they just stay inside.

464
00:30:25,802 --> 00:30:29,795
When they do come out,
they are told to go back,

465
00:30:30,006 --> 00:30:31,633
<i>and they do.</i>

466
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:43,380
I like to stay at the São Conrado
Fashion Mall's veranda. Why?

467
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:46,915
There's a country club and
the largest favela in Rio side by side.

468
00:30:47,391 --> 00:30:50,690
<i>If this country was a violent
place, how could that be?</i>

469
00:30:50,894 --> 00:30:54,762
<i>Would that be possible?
This is a tranquil country.</i>

470
00:30:55,098 --> 00:30:58,124
<i>The safety policy adopted is efficient.</i>

471
00:30:58,335 --> 00:31:00,860
<i>Now, the question is:
does the society</i>

472
00:31:01,071 --> 00:31:03,232
<i>want a police without corruption?</i>

473
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,341
<i>It's easy.
I'm not speaking theoretically.</i>

474
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:11,374
I've worked in the interior
with squads of 30 men

475
00:31:11,581 --> 00:31:13,572
who wouldn't touch bribes.

476
00:31:13,784 --> 00:31:17,185
The first 2 months were great.

477
00:31:17,387 --> 00:31:22,222
The chief warden controlled
the town's drug deal operation.

478
00:31:22,426 --> 00:31:24,519
The town was in a state of panic.

479
00:31:24,728 --> 00:31:27,526
We got there with 30 honest men.

480
00:31:27,731 --> 00:31:30,097
We were cheered for 2 months.

481
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,498
On the 3rd. month, the supermarket
owner's bodyguard

482
00:31:34,704 --> 00:31:39,141
slapped a kid who was
stealing a bottle of liquor.

483
00:31:39,342 --> 00:31:41,708
The kid and the bodyguard
were arrested.

484
00:31:41,912 --> 00:31:44,779
The supermarket owner said:
''Sir, he is a thief.''

485
00:31:44,981 --> 00:31:48,348
We said: ''But the bodyguard
can't hit a thief.''

486
00:31:48,552 --> 00:31:50,247
They were both booked.

487
00:31:50,454 --> 00:31:53,355
Then, social clubs
wouldn't invite me anymore

488
00:31:53,557 --> 00:31:57,550
for the Wednesday
night dinners.

489
00:31:57,761 --> 00:31:59,285
They stopped doing that...

490
00:31:59,496 --> 00:32:03,159
Then, a rich farmer
committed a murder.

491
00:32:04,968 --> 00:32:07,198
He was booked.

492
00:32:07,404 --> 00:32:09,099
End of story.

493
00:32:09,306 --> 00:32:10,796
There was trouble.

494
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:12,770
What was seen as nice
Was no more.

495
00:32:13,777 --> 00:32:16,746
<i>We pose a question to society:
is there a real interest</i>

496
00:32:16,947 --> 00:32:19,006
<i>in an honest police?</i>

497
00:32:19,216 --> 00:32:22,481
An honest police will act
like in other countries.

498
00:32:22,686 --> 00:32:25,746
You don't park in a forbidden area,
because you'll get a ticket.

499
00:32:25,956 --> 00:32:29,653
You don't drive through a red light
or draw a graffiti.

500
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,350
You don't do anything wrong.

501
00:32:31,561 --> 00:32:34,655
<i>Let's say we operate both in the
favela and in the rich neighborhoods.</i>

502
00:32:34,965 --> 00:32:40,062
People will have to stop
sniffing coke at their chic parties.

503
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:43,038
There would be search warrants
and doors getting kicked down

504
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,767
at the beachfront condos.
Isn't that right?

505
00:32:48,178 --> 00:32:50,476
<i>This is an honest police.</i>

506
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,617
<i>It doesn't have limits.
Will the society handle it?</i>

507
00:33:00,824 --> 00:33:03,588
It's people who can pay

508
00:33:03,793 --> 00:33:06,523
US$ 500 for coke who are making
our profit. Most of them are

509
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:12,100
from the upper class. Poor people
can't spend US$ 500 in cocaine,

510
00:33:12,302 --> 00:33:15,135
because his kid will
starve the next day.

511
00:33:15,338 --> 00:33:19,206
Rich people spend it,
because they can afford it.

512
00:33:21,444 --> 00:33:25,380
The middle class
supplies the money.

513
00:33:26,116 --> 00:33:30,610
With that money,
the dealers buy more guns.

514
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,653
It's a vicious circle.

515
00:33:33,857 --> 00:33:37,691
<i>-The middle class...
-The are also the enemy.</i>

516
00:33:37,894 --> 00:33:41,330
<i>In a later date,
they scream against the violence.</i>

517
00:33:56,646 --> 00:33:58,637
THE GUNS

518
00:34:07,757 --> 00:34:11,750
This is the armament
BOPE utilizes to fight crime.

519
00:34:12,362 --> 00:34:17,732
This is a German
military rifle, H&K 7.62.

520
00:34:17,934 --> 00:34:20,869
It has been found
with the dealers also.

521
00:34:21,071 --> 00:34:25,440
This is a 9 mm
H&K submachine gun.

522
00:34:25,642 --> 00:34:28,873
This is the most sophisticated
submachine gun in the world.

523
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:33,740
We have a 5.7x28 caliber
P-90 submachine gun.

524
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:36,976
We also have a 5.56 caliber
MD-2 military rifle.

525
00:34:37,187 --> 00:34:38,950
This is the same caliber
as an AR-15,

526
00:34:39,155 --> 00:34:41,589
but it weighs almost
twice as much.

527
00:34:42,158 --> 00:34:44,183
This gun...

528
00:34:44,394 --> 00:34:49,058
The only police in the world
using this gun is in Rio de Janeiro's.

529
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:55,127
In many occasions,
this gun has saved our team.

530
00:34:55,338 --> 00:34:59,172
It's a gun you won't find on
European or American policemen.

531
00:34:59,376 --> 00:35:02,834
It's a military gun, designed
to give support under fire.

532
00:35:03,046 --> 00:35:05,640
In Rio de Janeiro,
it's instrumental,

533
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:09,410
because of the intense
confrontations we have with dealers.

534
00:35:12,555 --> 00:35:15,388
This is a .30,
made in Brazil.

535
00:35:19,462 --> 00:35:22,625
This is an AK-47, Russian.

536
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,340
This is a grenade
launching AR-15. American.

537
00:35:39,082 --> 00:35:42,745
This is a 9 mm PT-92.

538
00:35:43,386 --> 00:35:45,513
It has been made in Israel.

539
00:35:50,226 --> 00:35:52,456
Do policemen sell you guns?

540
00:35:52,662 --> 00:35:56,359
We don't sell them guns,

541
00:35:56,566 --> 00:35:58,898
but they...

542
00:35:59,102 --> 00:36:00,364
You know.

543
00:36:02,472 --> 00:36:04,804
Sometimes, they come
in a police pick-up,

544
00:36:05,008 --> 00:36:08,466
open the back,
and tell us to choose.

545
00:36:08,678 --> 00:36:11,112
But those are cops we know.

546
00:36:14,884 --> 00:36:19,184
-What kind of gun do you use?
-G-3, rifles,

547
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:21,482
<i>CARLINHOS 16 YEARS OLD
9 mm pistols, .45,</i>

548
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:25,491
<i>PT, .38 caliber... It depends
on the guns they give us.</i>

549
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:30,566
<i>Today,Rio de Janeiro
dealers use AK-47,</i>

550
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:34,703
<i>which is Russian,
it's a guerrilla rifle.</i>

551
00:36:34,904 --> 00:36:38,931
<i>They use AR-15, grenades,
rocket launchers...</i>

552
00:36:39,142 --> 00:36:44,705
<i>Recently, we've noticed they're
using night vision equipment,</i>

553
00:36:44,914 --> 00:36:47,849
<i>something even
our platoon doesn't have.</i>

554
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:49,778
POLICE WAREHOUSE FOR
CONFISCATED WEAPONS

555
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,703
<i>When it comes to drug dealing,
we must mention gun smuggling.</i>

556
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:18,074
The profit from drugs
and gun selling are related.

557
00:37:18,281 --> 00:37:20,442
Look at the guns they make
by the end of the century.

558
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:23,744
Why produce a rifle
that shoots 700 bullets a minute

559
00:37:23,953 --> 00:37:26,353
by the end of the century?
Isn't the Berlin Wall down?

560
00:37:26,556 --> 00:37:30,788
What 's the issue?
Are there frontiers

561
00:37:30,994 --> 00:37:33,554
to be drawn?

562
00:37:33,763 --> 00:37:36,823
There is no real interest in this.
Then, why do they make those?

563
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:43,899
<i>The gun made in Switzerland
won't be sold in Libya, will it?</i>

564
00:37:44,107 --> 00:37:47,599
<i>If it's offered to the lRA,
It won't be bought.</i>

565
00:37:47,844 --> 00:37:49,368
<i>The lRA doesn't have Sig-Sauers.</i>

566
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:53,845
<i>We have modern armament
that even Libya doesn't have.</i>

567
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:59,078
<i>The makers know that it comes
to this country. Why?</i>

568
00:37:59,823 --> 00:38:01,916
Because they can sell it
for the highest price.

569
00:38:02,058 --> 00:38:07,086
OK, then. We have to close
gun factories in Switzerland,

570
00:38:07,297 --> 00:38:09,993
<i>in the US... Colt is American,
and the AR-15 is made by Colt.</i>

571
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,361
I want to close Colt 's factory.

572
00:38:12,735 --> 00:38:15,863
This is how they handle
The drug war,

573
00:38:16,072 --> 00:38:18,336
and I thing it's fair.
It should be the same for us.

574
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:20,839
They want to interfere in Colombia.

575
00:38:21,044 --> 00:38:24,207
They come into plantations,
and they want to control production

576
00:38:24,414 --> 00:38:28,350
in Colombia and in Peru. I want to
have control, to close Colt, in the US,

577
00:38:28,551 --> 00:38:31,884
and Sig-Sauer, in Switzerland.
What is the real issue?

578
00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:40,487
<i>There are favelas
with 100 armed men.</i>

579
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:44,189
<i>They carry sophisticated armament.</i>

580
00:38:44,834 --> 00:38:47,302
The day they realize
the status quo,

581
00:38:47,503 --> 00:38:50,631
and they decide to come
down in an organized manner,

582
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,535
they'll take over.

583
00:38:58,448 --> 00:39:00,507
DISRUPTION

584
00:39:08,825 --> 00:39:13,489
The brains behind drug dealing
and kidnapping are in prison.

585
00:39:14,097 --> 00:39:15,359
<i>They're all in prison.</i>

586

There are no powerful Comando
Vermelho leader on the streets.

594

-Who killed them?
-The criminals themselves.

595
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:45,156
Either them or the police.

596
00:39:45,361 --> 00:39:49,627
The link between the prison

00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:00,006
KILLED IN MAY, 92.
they usually say:

600
00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:04,908
<i>"It was born and died.
It lived for one minute."</i>

601
00:40:05,148 --> 00:40:07,013
<i>KILLED IN JUNE, 94.
Some people died</i>

602
00:40:07,216 --> 00:40:10,014
<i>in their first mission.</i>

603
00:40:10,219 --> 00:40:12,153
<i>KILLED IN AUGUST, 87.
Others were arrested. The whole</i>

604
00:40:12,355 --> 00:40:14,084
thing fell apart.
It got all disorganized.

605
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:18,454
The consequence is
that people dropped out of it.

606
00:40:18,661 --> 00:40:22,153
Things changed a great deal
and all that was left was the myth,

607
00:40:22,365 --> 00:40:24,128
the name Comando Vermelho.

608
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:29,931
<i>Now, we have the frightening
myth of the Comando Vermelho.</i>

609
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:37,101
<i>They tried to reorganize
in prison.</i>

610
00:40:37,914 --> 00:40:39,438
It didn't work.

611
00:40:39,649 --> 00:40:41,844
Fortunately for us,
it didn't work.

612
00:40:42,218 --> 00:40:45,745
<i>It didn't sparkle.</i>

613
00:40:45,989 --> 00:40:49,925
It went bad because they'd
deviate from it, using drugs and so on.

614
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:56,193
<i>-I'm a criminal, all right!
-Why?</i>

615
00:40:56,399 --> 00:40:59,197
Why?
Because I like good things.

616
00:40:59,402 --> 00:41:02,064
I was never into being
oppressed by society.

617
00:41:02,271 --> 00:41:05,035
There's no way society
will oppress me.

618
00:41:05,241 --> 00:41:07,641
What I have was not given
to me by society.

619
00:41:07,844 --> 00:41:09,641
-I got on my own.
-What did you get?

620
00:41:09,846 --> 00:41:14,215
With about 3 bank robberies,
I got my own house,

621
00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:16,317
thank God,
and some other things.

622
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:19,249
We don't want to take people's lives,
we want our own money.

623
00:41:19,455 --> 00:41:22,356
I won't work for US$ 50 a month.

624
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:25,287
My grandmother is over 70 years old.

625
00:41:25,495 --> 00:41:27,759
She worked her whole life.
What did she get?

626
00:41:27,964 --> 00:41:31,798
She doesn't have anything.
What kind of society is this?

627
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:34,663
I want a Mizuno tennis shoe.
It costs over US$ 100.

628
00:41:34,871 --> 00:41:36,668
If I work,
I'll never buy a Mizuno.

629
00:41:36,873 --> 00:41:40,536
I'll rob money then.
I'm not scorning the workers,

630
00:41:40,743 --> 00:41:42,904
but I'll rob from people
who have money.

631
00:41:43,913 --> 00:41:46,973
They don't amount to nothing.

632
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:50,450
They are the tip of the system.

633
00:41:50,653 --> 00:41:52,280
They're excluded from society.

634
00:41:52,488 --> 00:41:56,925
When they're alive,
they control all of that.

635
00:41:57,126 --> 00:41:58,491
When they die, it's over.

636
00:41:58,694 --> 00:42:01,663
Jorge Luiz's son has no
guarantee that he'll become

637
00:42:01,864 --> 00:42:04,924
Acari's drug lord.

638
00:42:05,902 --> 00:42:08,268
<i>They don't even have that.</i>

639
00:42:08,504 --> 00:42:12,497
<i>It's a retail operation.</i>

640
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:15,142
<i>A favela leader like UÊ is
nothing but a retail manager.</i>

641
00:42:15,344 --> 00:42:16,333
<i>He doesn't even know
how to manage profits.</i>

642
00:42:16,546 --> 00:42:19,140
<i>How is UÊ going
to manage US$ 5 million?</i>

643
00:42:19,816 --> 00:42:23,343
He's just the guy
who handles the tent.

644
00:42:23,553 --> 00:42:25,384
That's all he is.

645
00:42:26,189 --> 00:42:29,818
<i>He handles 50 street market tents.</i>

646
00:42:32,228 --> 00:42:34,594
It's basic, isn't it?

647
00:42:35,131 --> 00:42:39,795
<i>No criminal got rich,
bought land and stuff.</i>

648
00:42:40,002 --> 00:42:41,799
<i>They don't stay on
the media spot light either.</i>

649
00:42:42,004 --> 00:42:45,235
Actually, if we analyze it,
we'll see that

650
00:42:45,441 --> 00:42:48,569
the dealer sell drugs

651
00:42:48,778 --> 00:42:54,239
for a clientele in his own community.
Do you understand?

652
00:42:55,351 --> 00:42:57,512
<i>Drug dealing doesn't
bring any transformation</i>

653
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,587
<i>dealers don't change anything,</i>

654
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:02,690
they are lost in the middle
of the whole thing.

655
00:43:02,892 --> 00:43:07,386
Their inconformity grows and
fades in 24 hours. It's short-lived.

656
00:43:10,867 --> 00:43:15,827
If you check the history of
either the Terceiro Comando

657
00:43:16,038 --> 00:43:17,369
or the Comando Vermelho,

658
00:43:17,573 --> 00:43:20,201
you'll see that neither

659
00:43:20,409 --> 00:43:23,936
had a social background.

660
00:43:24,147 --> 00:43:26,411
They defend their
own interests.

661
00:43:26,616 --> 00:43:29,414
<i>They don't have
a political view of society.</i>

662
00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:34,147
They are like wild animals
fighting to see who is stronger.

663
00:43:35,691 --> 00:43:38,626
<i>Drug dealing does not
replace the State in the favela.</i>

664
00:43:38,828 --> 00:43:42,286
They might help people,
but they don't have the structure

665
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:46,525
to replace the State.
This is a lie.

666
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:53,138
There might be some kind
of rudimentary structure.

667
00:43:55,111 --> 00:43:59,377
<i>They're stupid.
Uê stayed in 5-star hotels.</i>

668
00:43:59,749 --> 00:44:02,912
It's stupid! Is there anything
easier than catching Uê

669
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,211
at a 5-star hotel?
It's stupid.

670
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:08,379
He could stay in a 3-star
hotel and remain unnoticed.

671
00:44:08,591 --> 00:44:13,893
He goes to a 5-star hotel.
We don't even have to ask who he is.

672
00:44:14,096 --> 00:44:18,760
This is the deal.
It's chaos. We live in chaos here.

673
00:44:18,968 --> 00:44:22,335
<i>15-year-old kids have no
idea of who is the leader.</i>

674
00:44:22,538 --> 00:44:24,028
<i>One shoots the other.</i>

675
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:30,201
<i>It's a crazy situation.
Kids with Sig-Sauers, AR-15...</i>

676
00:44:32,114 --> 00:44:34,139
CHAOS

677
00:44:35,885 --> 00:44:37,944
The dealer is escaping
through the window!

678
00:44:38,154 --> 00:44:39,712
MANCHETE TV STOCKSHOT
The police keeps shooting!

679
00:44:39,922 --> 00:44:44,655
There's another dealer trying to
escape. He's gonna jump! Look!

680
00:45:25,568 --> 00:45:28,560
<i>You put the squeeze on this
favela and they go to the next.</i>

681
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:33,401
<i>You go to the next, they move
again. It's an endless war.</i>

682
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:36,510
Even if you go over...
For 2 weeks,

683
00:45:36,712 --> 00:45:39,943
almost every night, the BOPE
would kill a dealer over there.

684
00:45:40,149 --> 00:45:43,676
It'd confiscate a pistol
or a rifle and kill a dealer.

685
00:45:43,886 --> 00:45:48,084
Did it solve a thing?
It didn't. It didn't solve anything.

686
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:51,055
<i>For the young people there...</i>

687
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:54,058
<i>There are dozens of young
men who are not part of it,</i>

688
00:45:54,263 --> 00:45:57,198
<i>but are waiting in line
to get in on it.</i>

689
00:45:58,134 --> 00:46:03,834
Maybe, the new leader,
because he's even younger...

690
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,507
<i>We have just witnessed
the formation</i>

691
00:46:05,708 --> 00:46:07,938
<i>of the youth's organization,
Comando Vermelho Jovem, CVJ.</i>

692
00:46:08,644 --> 00:46:12,205
<i>Being younger, they are
even more prone to violence.</i>

693
00:46:17,353 --> 00:46:20,049
If we have a shoot-out
with the police,

694
00:46:20,256 --> 00:46:24,158
many times they back away
and leave 1 or 2 soldiers behind.

695
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,727
If we get the soldier,
we tie him up, beat him,

696
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:30,592
shoot him, put him in
a barrel and set fire to it.

697
00:46:35,104 --> 00:46:37,732
When did you get into this life?

698
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,107
When I was 11 years old.

699
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:43,478
What was your 1st mission?

700
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,206
My first mission was
to kill an informant.

701
00:46:47,883 --> 00:46:49,942
At 11 years old...

702
00:46:50,152 --> 00:46:51,710
What did he do?
What did you do?

703
00:46:51,921 --> 00:46:56,358
He told the police we pack
cocaine and marihuana.

704
00:46:56,559 --> 00:46:58,550
He told it to the ''worms'',
the policemen.

705
00:46:58,894 --> 00:47:00,327
Then, I set him on fire.

706
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:04,295
I got 7 car tires,

707
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,797
I mean, 7 truck tires.

708
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:08,993
I got 5 liters of gasoline.

709
00:47:09,238 --> 00:47:12,002
I lit a match
and set him on fire.

710
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:13,937
Who asked you to do that?

711
00:47:14,143 --> 00:47:16,771
It was my boss.

712
00:47:17,546 --> 00:47:20,106
How did you feel
after doing that?

713
00:47:20,316 --> 00:47:23,945
I felt normal,
like I feel right now.

714
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,253
If I have to kill again,
I'll do it.

715
00:47:28,257 --> 00:47:30,725
When I kill?

716
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,090
The only feeling I have is
that I've fulfilled my duty.

717
00:47:35,297 --> 00:47:37,891
If I say I got home
and couldn't sleep, I'd be lying.

718
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,767
Have you ever killed
a policeman?

719
00:47:39,969 --> 00:47:43,496
No, I haven't had
that opportunity.

720
00:47:50,146 --> 00:47:52,376
<i>I stay on a roof at
the top of the favela</i>

721
00:47:52,581 --> 00:47:56,813
with a 9 mm pistol
that has a laser beam.

722
00:47:57,019 --> 00:48:00,978
I point the beam at their
chest or head, and they run.

723
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:04,091
<i>The beam marks the place
where the bullet will enter.</i>

724
00:48:07,563 --> 00:48:10,726
If it's on your forehead,
the bullet will hit it.

725
00:48:11,066 --> 00:48:13,091
I intend to go back on the streets
and do it all over again.

726
00:48:13,302 --> 00:48:17,500
-This time it will be worst.
-What will you do?

727
00:48:17,706 --> 00:48:20,698
I'll rob more banks,
more armored cars.

728
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:23,208
I'll raise millions,
and help the needy.

729
00:48:28,184 --> 00:48:31,642
<i>The police fights a personal war.</i>

730
00:48:31,854 --> 00:48:34,721
<i>If we kill a dealer,
other dealers will hate the police.</i>

731
00:48:34,924 --> 00:48:36,755
<i>They kill a policeman,
and then we hate them.</i>

732
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:41,225
It develops at that level.
The war is almost personal now.

<i>All I know is that

<i>I want a new life.</i>

because she was kind of nervous.

739
00:49:07,723 --> 00:49:10,283
She couldn't raise them.

740
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:13,261
What did she do?

741
00:49:13,462 --> 00:49:17,091
She had the kids...

742
00:49:17,299 --> 00:49:19,164
I don't know what happened.

743
00:49:19,368 --> 00:49:22,235
She sold her kids.

744
00:49:22,438 --> 00:49:27,171
-What did you do at the favela?
-I was a''fireworks kid''.

745
00:49:27,376 --> 00:49:29,310
What does a''fireworks kid'' do?

746
00:49:31,146 --> 00:49:34,775
I used to make money
at the favela.

747
00:49:34,984 --> 00:49:37,976
But what exactly does
a''fireworks kid'' do?

748
00:49:38,187 --> 00:49:41,486
When the ''heat'' came,
I'd use fireworks.

749
00:49:44,326 --> 00:49:46,419
It works just like an alarm.
People have time to hide.

750
00:49:47,963 --> 00:49:50,158
The policemen did this.

751
00:49:50,366 --> 00:49:52,857
I want money for this.

752
00:49:55,437 --> 00:49:58,235
I don't see an end to it.

753
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,240
There's no light
at the end of the tunnel.

754
00:50:02,444 --> 00:50:04,639
I see no solution.

755
00:50:19,161 --> 00:50:21,129

00:51:04,473 --> 00:51:06,373
<i>I lost many friends:</i>

763
00:51:06,575 --> 00:51:09,669
<i>Cidinho, Nininho,
Orlando Jogador,</i>

764
00:51:09,878 --> 00:51:14,247
<i>Dição, Siri...
I lost a lot of people.</i>

765
00:51:20,756 --> 00:51:24,556
Sergeant Renato died here,
at Morro da Mineira,

766
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,026
in the middle of the night,
shot in the head.

767
00:51:29,765 --> 00:51:31,756
<i>There's Lieutenant Vega,</i>

768
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:35,835
<i>Sergeant Brazuna...</i>

769
00:51:37,072 --> 00:51:39,939
<i>It will never end.</i>

770
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:43,838
The war will never end.

771
00:51:49,084 --> 00:51:51,143
<i>I'll lead this kind
of life until I die.</i>

772
00:51:51,353 --> 00:51:53,116
<i>-Why?
-Because this is my destiny.</i>

773
00:51:53,322 --> 00:51:54,812
<i>I made it my destiny.</i>

774
00:52:00,095 --> 00:52:06,694
If the problem of the drug
trafficking is serious,

775
00:52:06,902 --> 00:52:09,063
the good guys have lost the war.

776
00:52:09,271 --> 00:52:12,707
They have been at it for a long time,
and accomplished nothing.

777
00:52:13,409 --> 00:52:17,470
The only government agency that
goes into the favela is the police.

778
00:52:18,881 --> 00:52:21,372
<i>The police alone is not
going to solve anything.</i>

779
00:52:33,095 --> 00:52:36,792
I took over prisons with guns:
machine guns, grenades,

780
00:52:36,999 --> 00:52:39,126
pistols, revolvers.

781
00:52:39,334 --> 00:52:43,202
I attacked police stations
and police cars.

782
00:52:43,405 --> 00:52:46,067
<i>What for?
What history have I written?</i>

783
00:52:46,275 --> 00:52:48,675
<i>Is crime history?
No, it isn't.</i>

784
00:53:03,459 --> 00:53:06,951
I come home from a difficuIt mission,

785
00:53:07,162 --> 00:53:09,630
in which one of us
has been shot,

786
00:53:12,968 --> 00:53:15,903
in which a dealer
was killed,

787
00:53:18,741 --> 00:53:22,939
our famiIy doesn't even ask:
''How was your day?

788
00:53:23,145 --> 00:53:25,875
How was the mission?
What did you do?''

789
00:53:26,081 --> 00:53:27,673
They don't ask anything anymore.

790
00:53:29,351 --> 00:53:31,842
I'm tired of this
kind of work.

791
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:38,253
Ready!

792
00:53:39,128 --> 00:53:40,959
Aim!

793
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:43,291
Fire!
