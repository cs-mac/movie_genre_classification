00:00:07,557 --> 00:00:09,159
(Final Episode)

2
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,567
Jung Hee.

3
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:52,402
What were you doing there?

4
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,571
I was cleaning the basement.

5
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:56,239
It was too dirty.

6
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,346
Why is Bong Goo here this late?

7
00:01:16,793 --> 00:01:17,794
What is it?

8
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:19,596
What? You're home after all.

9
00:01:21,698 --> 00:01:22,999
You were home?

10
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,402
Why didn't you answer your phone?

11
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:26,703
What is it?

12
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:30,407
I was worried about you.

13
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:33,743
What you said earlier nagged at me too.

14
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,880
Are you sure everything's okay?

15
00:01:37,214 --> 00:01:38,348
What do you mean?

16
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,784
Jae Bok. You're being way
too sensitive lately.

17
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:45,020
Sensitive? Jerk. We're here
because we were worried.

18
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,388
How could you say that?

19
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:48,358
Go home. Don't make a scene.

20
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,197
That jerk.

21
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:02,339
See? He's fine.

22
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,809
Let me sit for a minute.

23
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:15,252
Still, she came all the way here.

24
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,187
You should've let her in.

25
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:21,424
Why were you cleaning the
basement at this hour?

26
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,494
Just. I couldn't sleep.

27
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,496
You couldn't sleep?

28
00:02:28,265 --> 00:02:30,066
You need to sleep well.

29
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:32,469
Go to bed.

30
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:35,038
Good night, Jung Hee.

31
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,647
(Front gate)

32
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:54,057
Did you get home safely?

33
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,694
I'm sorry. Earlier, I...

34
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:01,698
(I'm sorry. Earlier, I...)

35
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:09,506
(Ms. Perfect)

36
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:13,442
I heard you pressured the hospital...

37
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,378
to release Eun Hee.

38
00:03:16,046 --> 00:03:19,249
Please send her back to the hospital.

39
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,687
Your daughter needs to be treated.

40
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,391
Mr. Chairman.

41
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,795
I understand that you want
to do anything for her...

42
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:36,566
out of guilt for not being
there when she was young.

43
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:38,602
I do...

44
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,372
because I'm also a parent like yourself.

45
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,744
However, this is not what's
best for your daughter.

46
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:52,716
Eun Hee is very sick.

47
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:56,486
She doesn't know how or why...

48
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:58,355
and is just hurting.

49
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:00,156
She may hope...

50
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:04,361
that someone would stop her.

51
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:06,963
You need to do that for her.

52
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:10,267
If...

53
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:14,471
your daughter does something drastic,

54
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:16,239
my kids...

55
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:19,876
may lose their dad.

56
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:22,612
Do you really not care?

57
00:04:27,284 --> 00:04:28,385
Jae Bok.

58
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,621
Please be rational and question...

59
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,392
what's the best way to love your daughter.

60
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:37,827
Please.

61
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:45,602
Mr. Chairman. Please I'm begging you.

62
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,272
Let Eun Hee receive treatment.

63
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,075
And prevent my children from being hurt.

64
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,344
Please.

65
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:18,535
Hey, Uncle!

66
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,638
I'm just...

67
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,108
I'm at Na Mi's accident site.

68
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:26,476
Again?

69
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:30,580
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing much.

70
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:36,419
Why do you sound so weak?
Did something happen?

71
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:38,788
Is that why you called me?

72
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:40,957
Did you want to hear my voice to cheer up?

73
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:44,236
You sound weak today too.

74
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,898
No way. I'm feeling energetic
thanks to your call.

75
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:54,037
Come to the office within 30 minutes.

76
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,805
Right. We have to prepare
our defense materials.

77
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:59,008
It's not that. I want to see you.

78
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:01,144
We should both cheer up.

79
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:43,586
Did you sleep well, Jung Hee?

80
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,989
- Yes.
- Let's have breakfast.

81
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,363
She goes back and forth between
maniac and depression.

82
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:59,502
Gosh, I told you to clean up the freezer.

83
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:02,972
- I'm sorry, Mother. I'll do it.
- Move.

84
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:07,276
How old is this corvina?

85
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:09,746
You should have cooked it in advance.

86
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:12,548
What is this now?

87
00:07:12,549 --> 00:07:15,285
Gosh. My goodness.

88
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:34,070
She doesn't express her anger like before,

89
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:37,974
but I can sense that her lunacy...

90
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:41,845
is becoming more evolved.

91
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:59,295
I'm afraid of her suppressed lunacy,

92
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,197
but it can't be helped.

93
00:08:07,804 --> 00:08:11,608
In order to protect my kids
and atone for what I did...

94
00:08:12,308 --> 00:08:15,245
to Jae Bok, I must stop Eun Hee.

95
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:34,364
If it's not me, no one else can do it.

96
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:38,668
What are you doing?

97
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,675
Oh... I'm curious about the basement.

98
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:48,477
You told me you cleaned up,

99
00:08:48,478 --> 00:08:50,947
so I thought maybe we could
move the audio room there.

100
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:56,986
No. This will be used for something else.

101
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,923
For what?

102
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:05,395
I'm not sure. I'll have to think about it.

103
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:08,865
The workout made me hungry.

104
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:10,967
I'll make us food after washing up.

105
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:12,402
Okay.

106
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:16,072
That's why I miss my kids...

107
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:18,341
like crazy.

108
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:21,444
Why didn't I realize?

109
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:25,424
- Those days were so happy.
- One more, please.

110
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:27,083
- It was so precious.
- Excuse me!

111
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:43,466
(Dad)

112
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:49,305
Why are you sighing?

113
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:53,710
Jin Wook, I miss Dad so much.

114
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,345
Do you?

115
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,616
Then let's talk with Mom...

116
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:01,417
and see if we can see him.

117
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:06,389
Then Mom will get upset.

118
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,693
Right?

119
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:18,433
Do you really know the way to Dad's work?

120
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:21,003
Of course I do. Just trust me.

121
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:22,038
Hey.

122
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:23,840
- Where are you going?
- Che Ri.

123
00:10:24,474 --> 00:10:26,009
We're going to go see Dad.

124
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:28,910
The bus is here. Let's go.

125
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:29,979
I'm coming too.

126
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,315
- Why?
- I'd be too nervous...

127
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:34,851
to send you two alone.

128
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:37,687
Hae Wook, hold my hand tight.

129
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:41,384
I put your pictures back up.

130
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,920
What do you think?

131
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:46,889
I like it.

132
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:48,958
Thank you, Eun Kyung.

133
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:52,295
You're the only woman...

134
00:11:52,662 --> 00:11:55,765
that loves everything about me.

135
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:58,267
Jung Hee...

136
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:02,538
Gosh. You finally understand how I feel.

137
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:05,241
I'm so happy.

138
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:22,792
Only think of me. I don't
need anything else.

139
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:41,177
- Dad.
- Dad!

140
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:44,881
Hello.

141
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:56,359
Hae Wook missed you a lot.

142
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,361
Just Hae Wook?

143
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:02,064
Jin Wook always talked about you too.

144
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,966
He missed you a lot.

145
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:07,103
How dare you come here?

146
00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:10,540
- Dad...
- This isn't your playground.

147
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,442
How can you visit me without notice?

148
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,077
Gosh.

149
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,714
Jin Wook, Hae Wook, long time no see.

150
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:20,583
Have you been well?

151
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,652
Ms. Lee.

152
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,022
How did you get out of
the hospital so fast?

153
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,091
What?

154
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,395
I heard that your illness
can't be cured fast.

155
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:35,364
Are you really all better?

156
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:42,238
What brings you to the office?

157
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:46,876
I was just passing by
and wanted to see you.

158
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:52,815
Don't come to my office again, okay?

159
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,253
Eun Hee, wait for me upstairs.

160
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:58,855
I'll drive them home and come back.

161
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:01,657
It's been a while since they saw you.

162
00:14:01,824 --> 00:14:04,060
- Should we have dinner...
- No.

163
00:14:07,797 --> 00:14:09,165
I don't want to.

164
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:13,936
Let's go, kids. Hurry up.

165
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:32,081
Dad, I'm sorry...

166
00:15:32,815 --> 00:15:35,418
we went to your office.

167
00:15:37,086 --> 00:15:38,721
I'm sorry too.

168
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:50,766
I'm really sorry.

169
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:53,502
I'm so sorry.

170
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:55,905
Jin Wook and Hae Wook...

171
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,709
I love you, but I'm sorry.

172
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:11,320
Don't come looking for
me at the office, okay?

173
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:43,819
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

174
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,622
Did you drive them home?

175
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:50,459
Yes. Should we go for a
drive since you're out?

176
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:53,963
No, let's eat at home tonight.

177
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,565
There's something I have to do at home.

178
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:58,801
What is it?

179
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:01,303
Just housework.

180
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,675
I'll get going.

181
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,718
Jung Hee.

182
00:17:18,054 --> 00:17:19,088
Yes?

183
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:21,924
Let's have a wedding.

184
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:25,561
Not a big one with a crowd.

185
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:28,330
We can have a small one at home on our own.

186
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,232
What do you think?

187
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,837
If you want to do it, I will.

188
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:39,141
I'll prepare for it one by one.

189
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:46,282
I love you, Jung Hee.

190
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,085
We'll really...

191
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:51,420
get married soon.

192
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,575
I'm really sorry.

193
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:15,244
I'm so sorry.

194
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,546
Jin Wook and Hae Wook...

195
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,484
I love you, but I'm sorry.

196
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,824
Is that what a dad is like?

197
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,460
A dad...

198
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:34,763
Hello, Che Ri.

199
00:18:35,064 --> 00:18:37,298
Why did you want to see me?

200
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:38,434
Sit here.

201
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:39,668
Okay.

202
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:43,372
Hey,

203
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:47,409
what do you think about my mom?

204
00:18:48,644 --> 00:18:51,046
- What?
- Do you like her...

205
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,983
or are you just checking her out?

206
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:57,119
Checking her out?

207
00:18:58,287 --> 00:18:59,355
Che Ri.

208
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:02,123
You shouldn't say something...

209
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:03,692
You probably noticed,

210
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:05,528
but my mom likes you.

211
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:10,933
I think you're interested in her too.

212
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:14,102
Yes, that's true.

213
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:18,474
Then can you lead her?

214
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:21,143
Just do it.

215
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:25,281
Just do it?

216
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:28,082
Why would a kid say...

217
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,052
My mom is good at studying,

218
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:33,055
but she's really terrible at dating.

219
00:19:33,489 --> 00:19:36,791
I want Mom to meet someone nice...

220
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:38,360
and become happy.

221
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:41,030
Che Ri.

222
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:43,799
Then you must think...

223
00:19:45,134 --> 00:19:47,670
that I'm someone nice.

224
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,143
You're young, but you have keen eyes.

225
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:57,313
I partially believe that you're nice.

226
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,682
If there's one thing I'd
like you to improve on,

227
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,385
I wish you were more financially competent.

228
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,655
You also need to work on being manly.

229
00:20:08,057 --> 00:20:10,459
It'd be nice if you read more books too.

230
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:12,860
Financial competency,
masculinity, and books?

231
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:16,030
Also, it'd be nice if you could...

232
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:17,866
settle things well with Auntie Hye Ran.

233
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:24,006
I'd like it if you become my dad.

234
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:27,876
Che Ri.

235
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:35,117
Gosh. Thank you so much.

236
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:40,455
Gosh. There's so much work to do...

237
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:41,723
since the case is regarding a patent.

238
00:20:41,724 --> 00:20:43,591
We're helping small merchants.

239
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:45,828
We should be more meticulous.

240
00:20:47,296 --> 00:20:48,364
Jae Bok.

241
00:20:49,064 --> 00:20:51,667
There's something I want
to do if we win this case.

242
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:53,801
- Will you do it for me?
- What is it?

243
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:55,337
Just tell me you'll do it.

244
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,673
Fine, but let's work first.

245
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:03,679
Sam Kyu always leaves work early.
That jerk.

246
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:07,916
He went nervous as Che Ri called him.

247
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,886
Right, my kids.

248
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:18,227
Jin Wook.

249
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,131
I have to work late tonight.

250
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:26,435
I'm sorry. Did anything
happen during the day?

251
00:21:29,138 --> 00:21:30,139
What?

252
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:34,276
Hae Wook missed Dad too much.

253
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:36,577
Same with me.

254
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:39,848
Why did you go there? It's dangerous.

255
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,684
I'm sorry, Mom.

256
00:21:42,451 --> 00:21:45,187
And? Did you see him?

257
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:48,123
What?

258
00:21:48,957 --> 00:21:50,559
He told you to leave?

259
00:22:12,014 --> 00:22:13,549
Did you hear from Jin Wook?

260
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:16,385
Make sure they don't
come to my office again.

261
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:19,388
You're doing this on purpose, right?

262
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,890
Do you think I don't know you?

263
00:22:22,057 --> 00:22:25,226
Even if people change, you
would never be so cold.

264
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:26,627
Especially not to Jin Wook and Hae Wook.

265
00:22:26,628 --> 00:22:29,732
Jae Bok, do you still not know me?

266
00:22:30,332 --> 00:22:32,400
I stabbed you in the back.

267
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:33,569
What are you trying to do?

268
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,271
Tell me. What's your intention?

269
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,307
Don't you know?

270
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:41,443
I don't want to be someone useless.

271
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,846
Jung Hee.

272
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,182
I know you're doing this to protect us.

273
00:22:51,754 --> 00:22:55,124
I won't give up on you.

274
00:22:56,191 --> 00:22:58,460
This means I won't let
you throw yourself...

275
00:22:58,861 --> 00:23:00,763
in the fire.

276
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:10,238
I'll take this one.

277
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:12,908
Okay. Please come with your groom.

278
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,677
No, this is fine.

279
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:18,380
It'll fit perfectly.

280
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:22,918
Even if Eun Hee is being
obedient and quiet right now,

281
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:24,787
it won't be like this forever.

282
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:28,824
She'll know what you're thinking soon.

283
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:32,094
Actually, she might know already.

284
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,332
You need to leave that house.

285
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,134
I'll help you.

286
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:44,506
Before that, there's
something I need you to do.

287
00:23:46,108 --> 00:23:47,943
On the day Na Mi died,

288
00:23:48,544 --> 00:23:50,846
Eun Hee met Na Mi. There must be...

289
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:53,382
evidence somewhere in that house.

290
00:23:54,716 --> 00:23:57,586
People obsessive like her...

291
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,787
can't throw out things easily...

292
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:01,056
no matter what they may be.

293
00:24:02,825 --> 00:24:04,693
If you're going to talk
nonsense, I'm leaving.

294
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,628
Jung Hee.

295
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,834
Call me when you get out. I'll be waiting.

296
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:21,943
Mom, are you leaving now?

297
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:23,579
Yes. It's a night flight.

298
00:24:23,846 --> 00:24:27,114
Thanks to my daughter-in-law,
I get to travel Europe.

299
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:28,150
I'm so lucky.

300
00:24:29,518 --> 00:24:31,587
- Let's go.
- What should I do?

301
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,454
I thought you were leaving tomorrow,

302
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:35,691
so I had a couple shots of whisky.

303
00:24:35,824 --> 00:24:38,460
Did you? Then what should I do?

304
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:44,433
Then I'll drive you.

305
00:24:45,033 --> 00:24:47,135
Okay. Let's go.

306
00:24:47,336 --> 00:24:48,369
Okay.

307
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,239
By the way, why won't you clean the fridge?

308
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,707
I'll do it, Mother.

309
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,628
You better have it cleaned
by the time I'm back.

310
00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:56,812
On the day Na Mi died,

311
00:24:57,546 --> 00:24:59,381
Eun Hee met Na Mi.

312
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,016
There must be evidence
somewhere in that house.

313
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:04,953
You're so clean otherwise. You're so weird.

314
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:06,949
Na Mi.

315
00:26:37,212 --> 00:26:39,114
Did you talk to Jung Hee?

316
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,184
Yes. He still won't listen.

317
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:44,286
I'm so nervous.

318
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,522
So I hear Che Ri really did it this time...

319
00:26:47,756 --> 00:26:50,359
- that she asked Sam Kyu to be her dad.
- Seriously.

320
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:52,661
Where does she get it?

321
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,030
Where else? She gets it from you.

322
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,565
You always played matchmaker in school,

323
00:26:57,566 --> 00:26:59,067
but never for yourself.

324
00:26:59,301 --> 00:27:02,738
Even when Jung Hee and I
fought and we almost broke up,

325
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:05,507
Won Jae worked hard to
get us back together.

326
00:27:06,274 --> 00:27:09,343
Hye Ran. I really don't like Sam Kyu.

327
00:27:09,344 --> 00:27:11,580
- So you...
- Han Kyul?

328
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,350
Dinner tomorrow? I'm not sure.

329
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,119
Why?

330
00:27:17,753 --> 00:27:18,820
A movie?

331
00:27:20,522 --> 00:27:23,558
Han Kyul, are you asking me out on a date?

332
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,361
Really?

333
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:30,432
Hey. She already has a new guy.

334
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:31,833
That hot trainer.

335
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:35,404
You should stop feeling
bad and date Sam Kyu.

336
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:37,539
You like him too.

337
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:40,742
Love is all about timing, okay?

338
00:27:46,448 --> 00:27:47,549
Hi, Han Kyul.

339
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,819
Your timing was perfect. Thanks.

340
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:52,888
What?

341
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,959
Forget it. What movie? It was just an act.

342
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:02,364
Okay. Thanks. Good night.

343
00:28:17,412 --> 00:28:18,714
Jung Hee.

344
00:29:02,758 --> 00:29:03,792
When did you get back?

345
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:06,661
You weren't sleeping?

346
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:08,130
I just woke up.

347
00:29:08,864 --> 00:29:10,165
Would you make me some tea?

348
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:12,968
Sure. I'll bring it over.

349
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,336
Jung Hee.

350
00:29:49,604 --> 00:29:50,639
A gift.

351
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:54,743
A tuxedo?

352
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,613
We agreed to have a wedding alone at home.

353
00:29:59,447 --> 00:30:00,549
We did.

354
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:03,618
What do you think? Do you like it?

355
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,322
It's nice.

356
00:30:09,758 --> 00:30:12,093
When should we have the wedding?

357
00:30:13,862 --> 00:30:16,431
How about this Saturday?

358
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,134
Saturday?

359
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:22,938
Why? Is that too sudden?

360
00:30:23,371 --> 00:30:25,473
It's just the two of us anyway.

361
00:30:33,348 --> 00:30:36,785
Okay. Let's have our wedding.

362
00:30:43,024 --> 00:30:45,693
Yes! We won! We got everything we demanded!

363
00:30:45,694 --> 00:30:47,662
We won!

364
00:30:48,163 --> 00:30:50,432
We won that difficult case,

365
00:30:50,532 --> 00:30:53,367
so I bet word will spread about you.

366
00:30:53,368 --> 00:30:54,803
The icon of victory.

367
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,172
Come now. I didn't do anything.

368
00:30:57,339 --> 00:31:01,142
That was great with the secret contract!

369
00:31:01,343 --> 00:31:02,477
I did well, right?

370
00:31:06,381 --> 00:31:09,784
In light of that, keep your
promise from last time.

371
00:31:12,187 --> 00:31:15,624
There's something I want
to do if we win this case.

372
00:31:15,891 --> 00:31:16,925
Will you do it for me?

373
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,928
What is it?

374
00:31:21,229 --> 00:31:22,464
Let's date. Make it official.

375
00:31:27,502 --> 00:31:28,837
Bong Goo.

376
00:31:32,774 --> 00:31:33,842
I...

377
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:38,580
If you're about to say...

378
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,549
you don't understand, it's too soon,

379
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,687
or things like that, then no.
I only want a "yes".

380
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:47,489
In exchange,

381
00:31:49,124 --> 00:31:51,660
I'll give you time while I go somewhere.

382
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,529
I'm not telling you to question it.
I'm letting you...

383
00:31:54,863 --> 00:31:57,933
think of a cool way to accept it.
I'm going now!

384
00:32:23,925 --> 00:32:26,461
How about this Saturday?

385
00:32:28,063 --> 00:32:29,064
Saturday?

386
00:32:30,432 --> 00:32:33,001
Why? Is that too sudden?

387
00:32:41,676 --> 00:32:44,245
- Were you going out?
- What is it?

388
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:48,416
Well, so...

389
00:32:49,951 --> 00:32:53,989
I thought I should talk to you first.

390
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,662
Weren't you and Jae Bok already dating?

391
00:33:01,262 --> 00:33:02,262
Why are you...

392
00:33:02,263 --> 00:33:04,733
I'm sort of asking for your help.

393
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:07,469
Things need to settle down
to even think about love.

394
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:10,338
Help us put Eun Hee back in the hospital.

395
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,974
Stop making Jae Bok worry.

396
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:17,012
Be healthy and strong, okay?

397
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:23,794
What? Do you want to fight or something?
Is that it?

398
00:33:23,818 --> 00:33:27,022
Are you thinking of marrying her?

399
00:33:29,024 --> 00:33:30,258
Probably.

400
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,861
Really?

401
00:33:33,862 --> 00:33:36,931
Then you'll become Jin
Wook and Hae Wook's...

402
00:33:37,665 --> 00:33:38,833
dad.

403
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:40,502
Come now.

404
00:33:41,036 --> 00:33:44,205
I can't ask that they consider
me their dad too soon.

405
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:49,411
I'll have to try very hard.

406
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:54,416
I'm sure you'll be a good dad.

407
00:34:00,255 --> 00:34:02,624
- Let's go on the slide.
- Okay.

408
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,227
Kids, would you push me? Please?

409
00:34:06,361 --> 00:34:07,462
Kids.

410
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:20,942
Daddy!

411
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,046
- How have you been?
- Well.

412
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,915
You're all grown up.

413
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,117
Dad!

414
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:31,753
Hi, Jin Wook.

415
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:40,862
Is it good?

416
00:34:41,196 --> 00:34:42,230
Yes.

417
00:34:43,865 --> 00:34:46,334
Are you not mad anymore?

418
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:48,470
You were really mad last time.

419
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,573
That's because I was so busy.

420
00:34:52,574 --> 00:34:53,575
Were you hurt?

421
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:55,043
No.

422
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,644
I understand.

423
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,614
You can get mad when you're busy.
Mommy said so.

424
00:34:59,714 --> 00:35:00,715
Right.

425
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:06,120
Both of you listen to Mommy, right?

426
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:07,122
- Yes.
- Yes.

427
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:12,127
Jin Wook, you're older and you're a man,

428
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,063
so I hope you'll be a
dependable son to her.

429
00:35:15,263 --> 00:35:17,232
I'm totally dependable already.

430
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:22,070
That's right. You're dependable and mature.

431
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,038
- Eat.
- Okay.

432
00:35:42,857 --> 00:35:46,561
Jin Wook wants to play basketball well.

433
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:48,963
I was too busy...

434
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:51,533
to play with him,

435
00:35:52,267 --> 00:35:54,935
but you can get close if
you teach him basketball.

436
00:35:54,936 --> 00:35:58,673
Basketball. Michael Jordan. Okay.

437
00:36:00,441 --> 00:36:04,012
Hae Wook likes it when you read to her.

438
00:36:04,712 --> 00:36:08,049
But she's still afraid of birds and bugs,

439
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:11,185
so stay away from those.

440
00:36:11,186 --> 00:36:12,253
Okay.

441
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:17,824
This sounds like a will and testament.

442
00:36:17,825 --> 00:36:21,196
Don't worry, and settle
things with Eun Hee. Also,

443
00:36:21,863 --> 00:36:25,934
you should meet a healthy
and strong woman too.

444
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,072
Take good care of my kids.

445
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:38,780
What is that guy thinking?

446
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,615
Gosh.

447
00:36:44,986 --> 00:36:46,387
Let's date. Make it official.

448
00:36:47,989 --> 00:36:50,058
How could he say that out of the blue?

449
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,061
My head's about to explode
because of Jung Hee as is.

450
00:36:55,263 --> 00:36:58,933
You can't sleep like that.
No. Go like this.

451
00:36:59,234 --> 00:37:00,234
Come here.

452
00:37:01,035 --> 00:37:03,155
Now you're sleepy, right?
This is what you should do.

453
00:37:18,253 --> 00:37:19,487
Bong Goo.

454
00:37:20,622 --> 00:37:22,290
Jae Bok, look at you.

455
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:25,159
You look like you're suffering in agony.

456
00:37:26,394 --> 00:37:28,263
Was my homework assignment that difficult?

457
00:37:30,698 --> 00:37:32,367
Do you want to know the best answer?

458
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:37,071
Mr. Kang, I thought it over, and...

459
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:45,980
This is the best answer.

460
00:37:47,615 --> 00:37:49,083
If it's a "yes", stay still.

461
00:37:51,286 --> 00:37:52,453
Say, "Yes."

462
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,726
Yes.

463
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:00,762
Yes.

464
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,582
Thanks, Jae Bok.

465
00:38:23,451 --> 00:38:24,452
Thanks.

466
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:40,434
You should go alone and
have some alone time.

467
00:38:40,435 --> 00:38:42,770
We should've done that.

468
00:38:43,204 --> 00:38:46,306
It's a big day for you. Your
first date with Bong Goo.

469
00:38:46,307 --> 00:38:47,742
You can watch the kids next time.

470
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,110
Okay.

471
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,645
Won Jae!

472
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,014
Are you going on a date?

473
00:38:54,015 --> 00:38:56,751
What date? No, we're not.

474
00:38:56,851 --> 00:38:58,952
It's a Saturday,

475
00:38:58,953 --> 00:39:03,091
so we're taking the kids
on a field trip of sorts.

476
00:39:04,158 --> 00:39:05,225
What's this?

477
00:39:05,226 --> 00:39:08,128
I don't know. I ran into the
delivery man on my way in.

478
00:39:08,129 --> 00:39:09,563
- It's yours.
- Mine?

479
00:39:09,564 --> 00:39:10,731
Yes.

480
00:39:10,732 --> 00:39:14,235
What? This is from Bong Goo.

481
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:17,671
Goodness. Look at him.

482
00:39:17,672 --> 00:39:19,306
Because it's a special day.

483
00:39:19,307 --> 00:39:21,141
Won Jae, go on.

484
00:39:21,142 --> 00:39:22,442
Kids, are you ready?

485
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,077
- Yes, we are!
- Yes!

486
00:39:24,078 --> 00:39:27,181
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

487
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:29,683
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

488
00:39:29,684 --> 00:39:30,851
- Che Ri.
- Let's go.

489
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:33,788
- Have fun.
- Don't worry.

490
00:39:40,328 --> 00:39:41,863
It's so pretty.

491
00:39:42,063 --> 00:39:43,630
He must've sent it for your first date.

492
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,966
He's so random at times.

493
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:49,437
What do you mean, random? He's so romantic.

494
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,525
Why did you come?

495
00:40:11,692 --> 00:40:13,027
You said you wouldn't.

496
00:40:14,562 --> 00:40:15,830
I'm getting married...

497
00:40:16,964 --> 00:40:18,065
to Jung Hee.

498
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,004
You are?

499
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,175
Your dream came true...

500
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:29,644
finally.

501
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,781
Don't you have something to say to me?

502
00:40:53,468 --> 00:40:54,969
I'm sorry...

503
00:40:56,804 --> 00:40:58,039
for long ago.

504
00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:06,280
I wanted to do well too. But...

505
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,953
I didn't know how...

506
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:15,656
back then.

507
00:41:17,124 --> 00:41:19,727
I didn't know how to be a mom.

508
00:41:23,865 --> 00:41:25,132
I'm sorry.

509
00:41:26,434 --> 00:41:28,703
I'm sorry, Eun Kyung.

510
00:41:37,044 --> 00:41:38,312
I'm done with my visit.

511
00:42:19,654 --> 00:42:20,655
Hello?

512
00:42:21,656 --> 00:42:24,090
- Where are you?
- I stopped by the office...

513
00:42:24,091 --> 00:42:25,393
to finish something.

514
00:42:25,993 --> 00:42:29,230
It figures. Even on our first date,

515
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:32,198
our Jae Bok works hard. Nice.

516
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:33,439
There you go again, mocking me.

517
00:42:34,902 --> 00:42:36,337
Did you like my gift?

518
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,506
Well, somewhat.

519
00:42:39,507 --> 00:42:41,341
You're so stingy.

520
00:42:41,342 --> 00:42:44,612
Just say you liked it if you did.
What's your problem?

521
00:42:46,581 --> 00:42:49,283
I have another call. See you later.

522
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,697
(To Kang Bong Goo)

523
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:04,832
Hey, Tak Pyo.

524
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:07,835
Wedding dress?

525
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:17,345
I can do the rest on Monday.

526
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,930
(SJ Construction)

527
00:43:36,931 --> 00:43:38,432
Jung Hee's company?

528
00:43:59,587 --> 00:44:02,056
(Bong Goo)

529
00:44:03,958 --> 00:44:07,060
The line is currently busy.

530
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,563
Please leave a message...

531
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:14,835
(Jung Hee)

532
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,238
Jung Hee.

533
00:44:17,972 --> 00:44:19,006
Jae Bok.

534
00:44:20,675 --> 00:44:21,942
Where are you?

535
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,981
I'm sorry for everything.

536
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:30,117
You sent the evidence
against Eun Hee, right?

537
00:44:32,553 --> 00:44:34,388
I truly loved you a lot.

538
00:44:35,856 --> 00:44:37,391
You were my first,

539
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:40,094
my only, and my last love...

540
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:44,432
although I know I have
no right to say this.

541
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:47,568
What are you saying?

542
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,304
What are you trying to do?

543
00:44:52,306 --> 00:44:53,374
Be happy.

544
00:44:58,012 --> 00:44:59,180
Jung Hee!

545
00:45:06,153 --> 00:45:09,724
Congratulations on your marriage.

546
00:45:15,663 --> 00:45:16,764
So...

547
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:21,102
what did you do with my shoes...

548
00:45:21,602 --> 00:45:22,970
and Na Mi's phone?

549
00:45:24,872 --> 00:45:26,607
I sent them to Bong Goo.

550
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:29,810
Good.

551
00:45:30,778 --> 00:45:34,281
My mom will get to clear her name.

552
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:39,353
What?

553
00:45:40,387 --> 00:45:42,123
In order to protect the kids...

554
00:45:43,224 --> 00:45:45,760
and repent to Jae Bok,

555
00:45:46,861 --> 00:45:49,563
you have to stop Eun Hee's
psychotic behavior?

556
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:13,621
I had my doubts,

557
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,857
but I was right.

558
00:46:19,393 --> 00:46:21,562
You still don't love me.

559
00:46:22,763 --> 00:46:24,031
You used me.

560
00:46:24,331 --> 00:46:27,701
Eun Kyung, it isn't too late.

561
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,004
Go to the hospital and get treated.

562
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,512
So...

563
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,817
you thought I was a psycho too.

564
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:48,522
You thought my pure love was psychotic,

565
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,457
right?

566
00:47:01,602 --> 00:47:05,973
That's why I want to marry you.

567
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:10,978
To complete our love.

568
00:47:12,713 --> 00:47:14,348
We should start the wedding.

569
00:47:18,452 --> 00:47:19,520
Drink.

570
00:47:24,692 --> 00:47:26,026
If I drink this,

571
00:47:27,661 --> 00:47:29,763
will all the nightmares end?

572
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:31,932
No.

573
00:47:33,234 --> 00:47:36,804
Our complete love will begin.

574
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:40,274
The only way to end...

575
00:47:41,008 --> 00:47:42,643
Eun Kyung's psychotic behavior...

576
00:47:43,711 --> 00:47:45,212
is for me to die.

577
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:47,748
That way,

578
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,351
she will...

579
00:47:51,518 --> 00:47:52,953
follow me.

580
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:10,571
Eun Kyung.

581
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,974
You are...

582
00:48:16,677 --> 00:48:18,112
a sad woman.

583
00:48:19,613 --> 00:48:20,681
No.

584
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,517
I'm a happy woman.

585
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:26,387
I can...

586
00:48:27,621 --> 00:48:31,592
finally be with you forever.

587
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:51,578
Bong Goo. I'm heading to Eun Hee's house.

588
00:48:51,912 --> 00:48:54,581
I spoke to Jung Hee, and he seemed off.

589
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:57,251
I'm on my way there too.

590
00:48:57,584 --> 00:49:00,454
I've been tracing her steps,

591
00:49:02,456 --> 00:49:06,460
and she ordered a wedding dress for today.

592
00:49:07,261 --> 00:49:09,330
I think she's up to something.

593
00:49:09,763 --> 00:49:13,434
I heard she went to the prison today...

594
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:14,969
to see her mother.

595
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:19,272
Anyway, I'll see you in front of the house.

596
00:49:19,273 --> 00:49:22,875
Even if you get there first, don't go in.
Wait for me.

597
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,712
- Okay?
- Okay.

598
00:50:52,332 --> 00:50:53,467
Jae Bok.

599
00:50:54,368 --> 00:50:55,569
Come in.

600
00:50:56,203 --> 00:50:59,005
How did you know we were
getting married today?

601
00:50:59,006 --> 00:51:01,608
- Where's Jung Hee?
- In the wedding hall.

602
00:51:02,342 --> 00:51:05,145
Please come and give us your blessing.

603
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,049
I like your dress. You
look like a wedding guest.

604
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:13,053
Eun Hee. You have nowhere else to hide.

605
00:51:14,288 --> 00:51:18,025
We have evidence that you were there...

606
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:19,827
when Na Mi died.

607
00:51:22,429 --> 00:51:26,767
My shoes and her phone?

608
00:51:29,436 --> 00:51:30,804
Where's Jung Hee?

609
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,107
Jae Bok.

610
00:51:57,831 --> 00:51:59,066
Are you awake?

611
00:52:01,101 --> 00:52:04,505
Shall we start our wedding?

612
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,509
Where are we?

613
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,611
You know.

614
00:52:11,345 --> 00:52:15,048
The place I worked hard
on recently to decorate.

615
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,751
Our wedding hall.

616
00:52:20,988 --> 00:52:23,122
Why did you tie me up? Why?

617
00:52:23,123 --> 00:52:27,294
Wait a little bit. The
ceremony will be over soon.

618
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:32,266
You really are crazy.

619
00:52:35,135 --> 00:52:39,540
I thought it would be
just us at the wedding,

620
00:52:40,874 --> 00:52:43,010
but we have a guest.

621
00:52:53,954 --> 00:52:56,690
Jae Bok. Jae Bok!

622
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:04,531
Jung Hee.

623
00:53:07,334 --> 00:53:09,336
Okay, now.

624
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,406
Shall we start the wedding?

625
00:53:18,178 --> 00:53:22,282
I, Lee Eun Hee, take Koo
Jung Hee to be my husband,

626
00:53:22,749 --> 00:53:24,618
- and swear...
- Eun Hee.

627
00:53:25,152 --> 00:53:27,788
- To love him...
- Untie me. Untie me!

628
00:53:28,255 --> 00:53:29,456
Forever.

629
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:32,659
- Untie me.
- Please keep it down.

630
00:53:37,264 --> 00:53:39,032
It's your turn to say your vow.

631
00:53:39,233 --> 00:53:40,467
Eun Hee.

632
00:53:41,702 --> 00:53:43,804
You really are a psycho.

633
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:48,475
Then I'll say your vow...

634
00:53:49,376 --> 00:53:51,078
for you.

635
00:53:52,346 --> 00:53:53,747
I, Koo Jung Hee,

636
00:53:54,114 --> 00:53:56,216
- take Lee Eun Hee to be my wife.
- Eun Hee.

637
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,418
What are you trying to do?

638
00:53:58,552 --> 00:54:00,519
- I take Lee Eun Hee...
- What will you do with us?

639
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,389
To be my wife...

640
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,691
and swear...

641
00:54:05,259 --> 00:54:06,727
- to love...
- No.

642
00:54:08,128 --> 00:54:09,763
I don't love you.

643
00:54:10,364 --> 00:54:11,531
I despise you.

644
00:54:11,965 --> 00:54:13,934
- I loathe you!
- Jung Hee.

645
00:54:14,067 --> 00:54:16,570
Don't do it.

646
00:54:17,604 --> 00:54:19,539
Stop it. No.

647
00:54:21,275 --> 00:54:23,010
I swear...

648
00:54:23,877 --> 00:54:25,412
to love her...

649
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,782
forever.

650
00:54:45,332 --> 00:54:46,633
This won't do.

651
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:49,970
We really should be alone.

652
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,174
The guest is too noisy.

653
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,377
Here.

654
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,915
Jae Bok. Will you drink this?

655
00:55:02,349 --> 00:55:04,216
Here.

656
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,886
No. Stop it.

657
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,656
I'll do anything you ask, so stop it.
Stop it!

658
00:55:11,925 --> 00:55:12,926
Jung Hee.

659
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:16,863
Do you still have feelings for Jae Bok?

660
00:55:18,932 --> 00:55:21,468
You're going crazy out of concern for her.

661
00:55:22,202 --> 00:55:23,236
See?

662
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:24,871
Drink.

663
00:55:25,172 --> 00:55:27,174
Drink.

664
00:55:28,141 --> 00:55:29,710
Drink!

665
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:53,367
No. Eun Hee. No.

666
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,470
Eun Kyung. Moon Eun Kyung!

667
00:55:58,372 --> 00:56:00,873
- No!
- Don't do it!

668
00:56:00,874 --> 00:56:01,942
Stop it!

669
00:56:04,077 --> 00:56:05,078
No.

670
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,181
Stop it!

671
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:11,818
Eun Kyung.

672
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,058
We'll all go together.

673
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:20,827
Eun Kyung.

674
00:56:21,261 --> 00:56:22,529
All of us.

675
00:56:40,013 --> 00:56:43,450
Jung Hee. Jung Hee! Wake up!

676
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:45,919
Jung Hee. Wake up.

677
00:57:18,251 --> 00:57:19,419
Jung Hee!

678
00:57:20,987 --> 00:57:22,088
Jung Hee!

679
00:57:25,392 --> 00:57:26,393
Jae Bok.

680
00:57:26,927 --> 00:57:28,829
Jae Bok. Jae Bok!

681
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:36,903
Open it!

682
00:57:44,244 --> 00:57:46,745
Jae Bok!

683
00:57:46,746 --> 00:57:48,781
- Jae Bok!
- Wake up. Over here!

684
00:57:48,782 --> 00:57:50,250
Over here!

685
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,389
Wake up.

686
00:57:57,357 --> 00:57:59,459
Please take him.

687
00:58:05,465 --> 00:58:06,733
Eun Hee.

688
00:58:07,367 --> 00:58:09,469
Get up. Wake up.

689
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:11,671
Come.

690
00:58:12,305 --> 00:58:14,107
What are you doing? Snap out of it.

691
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,711
What's wrong with you?
I'm trying to save you.

692
00:58:20,547 --> 00:58:22,849
What are you doing? Let go.

693
00:58:25,952 --> 00:58:26,987
Jae Bok.

694
00:58:29,956 --> 00:58:30,957
Let go.

695
00:58:38,532 --> 00:58:44,280
Eun Hee!

696
00:58:44,304 --> 00:58:46,406
No. Eun Hee!

697
01:00:26,506 --> 01:00:29,509
(One year later)

698
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,128
Hey!

699
01:00:49,129 --> 01:00:52,531
- Hey!
- Hi!

700
01:00:52,532 --> 01:00:54,033
Congratulations.

701
01:00:54,034 --> 01:00:56,902
Thank you. The trial ended already?

702
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,171
I beat them up.

703
01:00:58,471 --> 01:01:00,172
Why did you cook so much?

704
01:01:00,173 --> 01:01:03,142
I didn't. Won Jae and Hye Ran helped.

705
01:01:03,143 --> 01:01:04,309
I made that one.

706
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:06,945
I bought. Come and sit.

707
01:01:06,946 --> 01:01:07,981
Let's eat.

708
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:10,315
- Isn't it so pretty?
- Congratulations.

709
01:01:10,316 --> 01:01:12,351
- Down it.
- Excuse me?

710
01:01:12,352 --> 01:01:13,886
- Down it.
- Let me say a few words.

711
01:01:13,887 --> 01:01:15,422
- Okay.
- Jae Bok.

712
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:19,258
- Congratulations on buying your house.
- Congrats.

713
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:20,492
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

714
01:01:20,493 --> 01:01:22,429
- Sure.
- Nothing but happiness.

715
01:01:23,063 --> 01:01:25,464
- Eat up.
- Congratulations.

716
01:01:25,465 --> 01:01:27,233
Father, more meat please.

717
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:28,968
Dad?

718
01:01:29,469 --> 01:01:31,036
- A lot.
- Sure.

719
01:01:31,037 --> 01:01:33,406
- Here.
- Che Ri, seriously.

720
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:36,876
Hello?

721
01:01:37,877 --> 01:01:41,781
Dad? Yes. We're all together
for our housewarming.

722
01:01:43,516 --> 01:01:45,051
I'll give you to Mom.

723
01:01:47,721 --> 01:01:49,154
Hi, Jung Hee.

724
01:01:49,155 --> 01:01:52,058
Jae Bok, congratulations on your move.

725
01:01:52,425 --> 01:01:54,259
I wish I could be there too,

726
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:55,762
but I have a show today.

727
01:01:56,162 --> 01:01:58,530
I know. When you come,

728
01:01:58,531 --> 01:02:01,334
bring detergent. I got
a lot of toilet paper.

729
01:02:03,002 --> 01:02:05,371
- Okay.
- Sing well today.

730
01:02:05,605 --> 01:02:07,307
Good luck, Jung Hee.

731
01:02:16,182 --> 01:02:23,422
On the street across that hill.

732
01:02:23,423 --> 01:02:26,059
A year passed since that happened.

733
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,129
Jung Hee and I...

734
01:02:29,562 --> 01:02:31,965
survived the fire,

735
01:02:32,866 --> 01:02:35,001
but Eun Hee died.

736
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:38,437
I dumped that guy.

737
01:02:38,438 --> 01:02:41,207
- Already?
- No one talks about it anymore,

738
01:02:42,142 --> 01:02:43,576
but we know.

739
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,177
So hot.

740
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,147
- That the incident...
- Here.

741
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,516
Left a deep wound in all of us.

742
01:02:50,717 --> 01:02:52,050
Hot!

743
01:02:52,051 --> 01:02:53,653
In order to heal the wound,

744
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:55,789
we live harder...

745
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,225
and love each other harder.

746
01:02:59,959 --> 01:03:05,532
For it to fade away with the time.

747
01:03:07,934 --> 01:03:09,802
Okay. Jin Wook.

748
01:03:09,803 --> 01:03:10,804
Okay.

749
01:03:13,973 --> 01:03:16,676
I'll show you how far I can go.

750
01:03:17,577 --> 01:03:20,313
(Ms. Perfect)

751
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:25,551
(Thank you for watching Ms. Perfect)

752
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:29,389

Please tune in.)
