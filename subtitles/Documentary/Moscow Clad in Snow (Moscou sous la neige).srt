Having touched the casket.

Martin, can you hear me?

40
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:51,167
Hello, Martin.
Welcome back.

41
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:55,500
Martin, you crashed your car.

42
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:58,667
A nasty crash.
You are lucky to be alive.

43
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:02,250
There is more than one can say
about your friends.

44
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,917
Have you seen

45
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:12,750
Have you seen creatures?

46
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,875
The things

47
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:22,042
Have the police caught them?
Or the army?

48
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,083
Roy and Erlend?

49
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,958
- Hanna?
- We found friends. All of them.

50
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:36,125
Dead.
Hanna was your girlfriend, right?

51
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:39,708
Very beautiful.
We found her too.

52
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,167
With an ax driven into the neck.

53
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,917
And your fingerprints on the shaft.

54
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,875
Do you have any idea
how that could happen?

55
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:52,708
They came up from

56
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:58,583
From the snow. Creatures. Nazi.
We stuck, but

57
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,250
Nazis coming out of the ground?
Absurd.

58
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:07,042
Are you sure
that he has brain damage?

59
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:13,083
Please call the family and say he is awakened.
Ask the Attorney send a car.

60
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,542
And four additional men. You are
ready to be transported.

61
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:21,208
They are out there yet. They will kill
again if we do not stop them.

62
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:25,708
We should not stop anyone.
I've seen what you've done.

63
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:31,125
- You'll be right in jail.
- No one knows what happened there.

64
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:35,167
Only you know that.
And it's not just bad news.

65
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:40,833
When we found you, you were badly injured.
Your right arm was torn across.

66
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,167
- It was not torn
- When we found you, it was cold.

67
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:48,750
The snow had chilled all,
and it was very good.

68
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:52,917
- And then we found the arm in the car.
- In the car?

69
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:57,792
It was slightly bruised and quite pale,
bit strange, basically, -

70
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,333
- But the operation was a success.

71
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,542
We managed to stick your arm again.

72
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,875
No, no, no

73
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,875
- It's not my arm.
- Relax.

74
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:30,917
It is Satan's arm!
It is Satan's arm!

75
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,500
Calm down.

76
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,667
No, it's not me!

77
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,250
No!

78
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:58,625
It's not me!
What the hell ...?

79
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:05,292
Stop!

80
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,375
Randi?

81
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:04,375
You need to settle down
removing the denture later.

82
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:07,667
Tonight I'm ready for a little hue.

83
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:47,208
From him that got away.

84
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:50,458
Nameless GERMAN SOLDIERS
WHO FELL IN WAR

85
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,792
Bakken.

86
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,750
Warm.

87
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:51,208
The men have rotted.

88
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,875
We need more people.

89
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:13,000
Fittelås!

90
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,125
You scared me, Nils.

91
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,167
I can no more nonsense.
I have been a damn long day.

92
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:40,292
A wedding, a funeral
and confirmation.

93
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:44,125
She's one confirmant
was the damn fine, then.

94
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:46,833
If only I had been ten years younger -

95
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,042
- And not a priest, of course

96
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:54,208
Nils?

97
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:06,250
Come on!

98
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,292

Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil

101
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,667
They came down from the mountain.

102
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,625
I saw them.

103
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,417
Hey! Hey!

00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:31,708

161
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,583
<i> awakened to reclaim something that was stolen from them
. </ i></i>

162
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:43,417
- Or to complete a task given to them.

163
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,917
They called him Herzog.

<i> They are bad ass. </ i></i>

171
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:21,875
Okay, girls.

173

175
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,958
You saw the picture.

176
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:46,292
This is a bonifid infected arm, you know this.

177
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:50,583
All the signs are there guys
the decayed skin, the rotten Rotten hair,the dark blood.

178
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,500
- This is real guys it's real.

179
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:57,917

Of course it will be dangerous!

180
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:03,417
but this is what we've been waiting for
this is our chance to prove to everyone that we were right

181
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:08,625
i mean we've been telling everyone
for years that it's just a matter of time -

182
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:12,958
-before the first outbreak happens.
And what have seen in return?

183
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:17,125
Laughter. ridicule.

184
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:20,458
wedgies.

185
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,917

187
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:34,625

Zombie Squad USA

198
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:14,500
- Oh my God ...!
-it's time to go hunting.

199
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,333
that was  better than usual.

200
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:55,208

201
00:28:57,167 --> 00:29:00,792
- It is cold.
- Because you're 40 minutes late.

202
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:05,167
I am in the winter.
The DST system -

203
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:09,708
- Is completely idiotic.
What do you have?

204
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:13,417
Not much. The boy at Petra
has shoplift again.

205
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:18,292
They should done what they do in Iran.
chop Off with his hands.then he'll learn.

206
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:22,000
And Ove dog has pooed
in Olsen's garden.

207
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:23,917

208
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,833
Not Olsen. Shoot the dog!

209
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,625
So we have lectures to school
about the harms of using marijuana.

210
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:33,250
<i> boring! </ i></i>

211
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:38,083
There was one thing, though.
From Øksfjord.

212
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:42,000
Øksfjord?
It is not our district.

213
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:46,708
Martin Hykkerud
escaped from the hospital yesterday.

214
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:51,625
Martin Hykkerud? the guy who killed
his friends on top of the mountain?

215
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:57,000
Yes. He escaped yesterday and killed
a little boy and a policeman -

216
00:29:57,167 --> 00:30:00,875
- By throwing a Mercedes star
in the face at him.

217
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:03,750
- Kutta the Mercedes star?
- Yes.

218
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:07,833
- What else?
- About the Mercedes star?

219
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,167
About the Hykkerud case!

220
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:14,542
We need additional people,

221
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:17,250
Sent a team up?
Extra people?

222
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:20,917
How the hell do I get money
for additional people from?

223
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:25,708
I do not even have money to buy
new batteries for the cars.

224
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,708
Okay. Right.

225
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:32,458
What?

226
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:36,917
did we not agree
about having a casual look here?

227
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,708
Continue.

228
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:54,833
<i> my god I was expecting something like the hoth system
but this is more like endor. </ i></i>

This is a war museum, right?

Yes.

244
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:42,792
Yes, and

245
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:48,667

about the Germans?

246
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:57,417

251
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,958
- Do you have information about Einsatz?

252
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:24,542
- Second floor.
- Second floor.

253
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:38,042
Where the hell are you?

254
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:43,542
- What are you looking for?
- Herzog.

255
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:53,458
Buddy with Hitler.

256
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:57,875
- Nice, huh?
- Do not touch the exhibits.

257
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,042
"Herzog was made commander of Einsatz in 1942.

258
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:07,167
and was sent to the far north of norway
in order to protect the warships -

259
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:10,875
- that the German navy was hiding in the fjords.

260
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:18,000
He was on duty in Øksfjord doing a routine inspection on the ship
Scharnolsht, when

261
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:19,750
Scharnholst.

262
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:27,167
When Tirpitz, the German
fleets biggest warship, -

263
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:31,083
- Was attacked
by english bombers in Talvik -

264
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:36,417
- After getting vital information on the ships location
from norwegian spies.

265
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:40,458
Hitler, humiliated by the attack on Tirpitz
- ordered Herzog

266
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:46,625
-to wipe out all the the 800
men and people who lived in talvik at the time. "

267
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:52,417
Was he
He was on his way?

268
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:58,792
He was on his way to Talvik the evening
they were slaughtered in Øksfjord?

269
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:01,875
On behalf of Hitler.

270
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:11,750
A mission that was never completed.
It is. Exactly what is it.

271
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,917
They will destroy Talvik.

272
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,667
where

273
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:28,083
Herzog was going from Øksfjord -

274
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,458
- Which is here.

275
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:33,667
And he was going to talvik.

276
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:36,208
It's here.

277
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:38,250
Where are we now?

278
00:37:39,167 --> 00:37:40,917
Where are we now?!

279
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,875
Here.

280
00:37:45,042 --> 00:37:47,833
Isnestoften.

281
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:55,250
It is  in between.

282
00:37:55,417 --> 00:37:57,583
(screaming outside)

283
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:42,208
They are recruiting!

284
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:47,500
They make new soldiers.
Can they do that? Fuck!

285
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:50,750
Okay, they come here.
There're coming now.

286
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:55,625
I will not die in a museum
with a guy in a green jogging suit.

287
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:58,417
Calm down.
You will die.

288
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:02,458
But relax.
Not today.

289
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:56,208
There!

290
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:00,917
Let see
what this thing can do.

291
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:02,917
What thing?

292
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:33,792
What did you do?
You killed them only with your hand

293
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:36,750
It's arm, man.

294
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:41,750
Before I could not control it,
but now makes it known what I think.

295
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:44,417
You're not even sweating.

296
00:42:45,292 --> 00:42:47,167
Do not worry about it.

297
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:56,917
They build bigger.
Damn much larger.

298
00:42:57,083 --> 00:43:00,000
There are too many
through the arm.

299
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,250
So much death.

300
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:33,417
All this unnecessary death.

301
00:43:56,958 --> 00:43:58,917
(whimpering)

302
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:05,083
Fuck!

303
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:09,083
You did what he fucker
in the place. You just

304
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:12,500
- You
- No, it was the arm. It was the arm.

305
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,875
He does not attack

306
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:56,583
Did you see that?did you see that
I hit it!

307
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:00,042
I hit it!oh my god

308
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:02,875
I hit it right in the eye.oh my god

309
00:45:03,042 --> 00:45:06,542
oh my god take a picture. please take a picture of me.

310
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:09,750
- First Zombie Squad kill.
- One, two

311
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:11,875
cheese...!

312
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:14,875
Did you get it?

313
00:45:15,042 --> 00:45:19,833
oh we spoke on the phone.
i'm Daniel, this is Blake and Monica.
-hi

314
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,500
We are the Zombie Squad.

315
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:28,167
- god damn it
- they're real ? these are real dead people?.

316
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:31,167
And thats a real zombie.
You killed him.

317
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:35,083
- i cant believe it.
- can we just focus for one second guys.

318
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:39,458
i'm so sorry.
We are more professional than this.

319
00:45:39,625 --> 00:45:42,625
-you're the Zombie Squad?
- Yep.

320
00:45:42,792 --> 00:45:45,208
- You're the Zombie Squad?.
- Yeah, we are the zombie squad

321
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:49,417
i'm sorry.
I just expected something different.

322
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:53,792
so was this guy
when he woke up this morning.

323
00:45:56,042 --> 00:45:58,500
Because I hit him in the face
with an ax.

324
00:45:58,667 --> 00:46:02,083
- yeah how did you find me?
- we tracked your iphone, of course.

325
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:05,833
We're fucking nerds.
this is what we do technical shit, lets cut the chit chat

326
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,208
What did you find out?
What do the creatures want?

327
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:17,375
Revenge.

328
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:20,125
(engine noise)

329
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:21,958
this is insane!

330
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:26,292
You? you have the gift?

331
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:29,292
The force is strong with this one.

332
00:47:29,458 --> 00:47:31,167
ok

333
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:39,583
Martin,
this is how we defeat them,
this is how we take them down

334
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:43,125
- What do you mean?
- I mean

335
00:47:44,417 --> 00:47:46,708
We create an army of our own.

336
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,708
I tried to get as much infomation as i could on the trip over.

337
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:54,542
Especially about Herzog. To defeat
your enemy, you must know you enemy.

338
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:58,083
This is Lieutenant Stavarin
of the Soviet army.

339
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,750
Him and his battalion
was captured during the battle of Kursk.

340
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:04,750
and brought here to the north of norway as pow's.

341
00:48:04,917 --> 00:48:08,417
In 1944 they were all sent
to Kvenang mountain  -

342
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:11,000
-to build a road through the mountain pass.

343
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:16,000
but it was after they built the road that shit got ugly.

344
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:21,625
All of the prisoners were shot.
Shot to death!

345
00:48:21,792 --> 00:48:24,625
No survivors.

346
00:48:24,792 --> 00:48:28,250
And the man in charge

347
00:48:28,417 --> 00:48:30,167
Herzog.

348
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,667
Those bodies are still buried there.

349
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:39,500
Buried in the frozen soil.
Preserved, waiting.

350
00:48:42,458 --> 00:48:46,208
-  waiting for what?
- for he same thing that drives Herzog.

351
00:48:46,375 --> 00:48:50,875
Revenge.
-and guess who's gonna
give it to them.

352
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:56,917
- the man who can raise the dead?
- kerfuckin ...!

353
00:48:57,083 --> 00:49:01,875
you guys go after Herzog try and slow him down,
give us as much time as possible. ok?

354
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:04,750
- And what if this doesnt work?
- It has too.

355
00:49:04,917 --> 00:49:08,250
all we have to do is get to Kvenang mountain,
find stavarin wake him back from the dead -

356
00:49:08,417 --> 00:49:11,875
- then bring him back to Talvik
so he can help us fight Herzog and his men.

357
00:49:12,042 --> 00:49:15,333
Lett. Besides

358
00:49:16,917 --> 00:49:19,708
we got help.

359
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:27,000
here we go.

360
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,167
He is our last hope.

361
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:54,625
look, a tank.

362
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,667
(a sound from outside)

363
00:50:14,792 --> 00:50:17,500
- a Visitor now?
- It's early.

364
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:34,000
(sound)

365
00:50:34,167 --> 00:50:35,875
Hello?

366
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:36,875
(baby crying)

367
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:46,708
Look,
his army is growing bigger.

368
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:52,250
glenn are there more towns or villages
before he reaches talvik

369
00:51:52,417 --> 00:51:57,208
- maybe a few houses but thats it
- Good. so what he has now he'll use for his attack.

370
00:51:57,375 --> 00:52:01,833
yeah pretty much
that is untill he starts dealing with people of Talvik bekim and journhim as well.

371
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,250
- How many people live in talvik?
- about 3000.

372
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:09,375
- Holy shit!
- all the more reason for us to slow them down as much as we can.

373
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:16,292
- look do you know how to use one of those things?
- of course.  I'm from northern Norway arent i.

374
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:20,000
I dont know what that means, ok
guys pack light.

375
00:52:20,167 --> 00:52:22,708
we're moving out, now!

376
00:52:27,917 --> 00:52:31,958
What the deepest in hell
happened here?

377
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:34,875
What do engineers?

378
00:52:35,042 --> 00:52:38,833
It is not technical,
Only Tom and Ole in a white coat.

379
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,333
The thought
so a little more professionally out.

380
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:46,500
NCIS should be herein night.

381
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:51,208
- Do we have any witnesses?
- If you get the seagulls to chat happily.

382
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:54,833
Gulls, yes.
Then you have a damn good invention.

383
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
A gadget that translates
seagull language to human language.

384
00:52:59,167 --> 00:53:02,417
He who finds a way
will be fucking rich.

385
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:05,833
Get the bodies out of Talvik
before the gulls eat them up.

386
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,125
And take  pictures, otherwise
NCIS will cut off my balls.

387
00:53:11,292 --> 00:53:15,083
Here are pictures
from the surveillance camera.

388
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,625
Is not that where ...?

389
00:53:24,917 --> 00:53:28,333
To me at the head of guttefitta mi.

390
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:36,458
Okay, guys, guys!
We are in a hurry. Come on!

391
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:39,250
Come on, man!
We have things to do!

392
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:44,875
There they are.
And they have a tank i see.

393
00:53:45,042 --> 00:53:47,833
Yes, they stole it from the museum.

394
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,417
ah Fuck!

395
00:53:51,958 --> 00:53:56,208
- What is that?
- A large-ass tank and 40 or 50 zombies.

396
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:59,125
No,no,no,no,no
That. What is that?

397
00:53:59,292 --> 00:54:03,958
oh these are replica's of the binoculars
Han and Chewie used on the planet Hoth.

398
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:08,208
Did you guys know ...fun fact all of the hoth scenes,
-sssshhhhhh

399
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:12,500
- Were filmed here in Norway.
this place called Finse.

400
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:17,708
girls Could we please maybe focus on you know the Nazi zombies instead?

401
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:22,375
- What do we do?
- well Daniel told us to slow them down, so thats what we're gonna do.

402
00:54:22,542 --> 00:54:24,333
Look.

403
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:29,708
We need to get out there,
get their attention and then lure them into the swamps, right?

404
00:54:29,875 --> 00:54:35,167
And then when they get stuck,
we can use the fertilizer bombs we made and blow them into bits and pieces.

405
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:37,583
thats sounds basically impossible.

406
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:41,500
And how were you planning on luring them out there?
We need bait. Live bait.

407
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:45,125
yes we need someone to attract their attention,

408
00:54:45,292 --> 00:54:48,125
someOne who is light on their feet.

409
00:54:48,292 --> 00:54:53,042
who knows these swamps
and can move through them without getting stuck.

410
00:54:59,375 --> 00:55:00,917
What?

411
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:02,792
No.

412
00:55:02,958 --> 00:55:06,000
No.
no. thats a swamp !, i'm not getting out there

413
00:55:06,167 --> 00:55:10,042

414
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:13,333

415
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,458

416
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:20,208

417
00:55:20,375 --> 00:55:25,125
Yeah. especially one ma ...

418
00:55:25,292 --> 00:55:31,208

419
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:35,708

423
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:57,958
First, we wake up a battalion of Nazi zombies -

424
00:55:58,125 --> 00:56:02,208

01:02:29,083 --> 01:02:33,250
- Can I push it?
- I dont, i dont think that will help.

467
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:37,875
- Is it far? We could walk.
- We dont have that kind of time.

468
01:02:40,542 --> 01:02:43,000
i mean If only we could find something -

469
01:02:43,167 --> 01:02:47,167
- to put under the car you know
something that would give us traction.

470
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:50,083
Then I could get us out of here.

471
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,917
(whimpering scared)

472
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,042
- There you are, yes.
- Satan lives to accommodate all equal.

473
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:48,917
The dress is absolutely stuffed full.
We had to throw the rest in the garage.

474
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:52,583
- Sounds like a perfect solution.
- Thank you.

475
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:58,708
Most Germans and French.
Hardly the vacation they envisioned.

476
01:03:58,875 --> 01:04:02,542
To get worn off his head and arms
and get entrails torn out?

477
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:05,417
Unless they like that kind of kinky stuff.

478
01:04:10,792 --> 01:04:13,667
- Should you do that?
- No.

479
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:16,917
- Should not NCIS been here now?
- It gave a lot in Alta.

480
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:21,208
The plane could not land.
They are here in the morning, they say.

481
01:04:24,333 --> 01:04:27,250
- It's perfect.
- What?

482
01:04:28,458 --> 01:04:31,167
It's our chance.

483
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:35,125
Now, we fucking show people
what we're made of here.

484
01:04:35,292 --> 01:04:40,000
We here at Talvik Police
find Martin Hykkerud itself.

485
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:44,375
We get him. Vi.
We will be heroes.

486
01:04:44,542 --> 01:04:48,500
Not the goddamn suit-clad,
homofriserte -

487
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:52,083
- Sushi-eating hestkukene south.

488
01:04:52,917 --> 01:04:55,208
Beef boys

489
01:04:55,375 --> 01:05:00,542
Brief guys. Send photos to
all gossips throughout Talvik.

490
01:05:00,708 --> 01:05:05,417
He stops to pee, I
Knowing the color and smell of urine.

491
01:05:06,667 --> 01:05:09,583
- Odor and color.
- And make ready their weapons.

492
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:13,250
Now we shoot anything other than gulls,
for once.

493
01:05:18,417 --> 01:05:21,000
Do you really
think this is going to  work?

494
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:26,000
I mean,
say we actually manage to wake these russians back to life .

495
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:29,000
Whats stopping them from killing us?

496
01:05:30,292 --> 01:05:35,000
I dont know whats gonna happen.
But judging based on him -

497
01:05:35,167 --> 01:05:39,083
- he treats you like you're his master,
so hopefully they'll do the same.

498
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,208
Hopefully.

499
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:45,333
look I dont know man
this is some unprecedented unheard of -

500
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:50,542
- Mysterious voodoo zombie shit man
I've never seen this before.

501
01:05:50,708 --> 01:05:56,042
I've seen a thousand zombie movies,
and this is not in any of them.

502
01:05:56,208 --> 01:06:00,000
You have created a whole new genre here man.

503
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:04,500
look i mean if we're gonna go up against a battalion of
Nazi zombies -

504
01:06:04,667 --> 01:06:08,500
-we could do a whole lot worse than
teaming up with a battlion of russian zombies.

505
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:15,000
He has to die you know?. Herzog.

506
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:18,792
For what he did.
We have to kill him.

507
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:24,333
I have to  kill him.
For Hanna.

508
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:30,833
- this it is.
- Yeah.

509
01:06:32,667 --> 01:06:35,375
this is definitely it.

510
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:41,042
Herzog killed Stavarin
and 50 of his men here.

511
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:45,875
So they've got to be buried in this frozen ground.
.

512
01:06:48,042 --> 01:06:50,125
how we do this?

513
01:06:50,292 --> 01:06:52,042
we do it just like you did  -

514
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:54,958
- with him.

515
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:57,792
I put my hand on his head.

516
01:06:59,167 --> 01:07:01,542
Okay. Right.

517
01:07:03,417 --> 01:07:06,083
we cant dig up everyone it will take weeks.

518
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:10,500
You have to wake them up,
one way or another.

519
01:09:33,708 --> 01:09:37,167
Lord.

520
01:09:42,542 --> 01:09:45,042
f**k yeah!

521
01:10:19,292 --> 01:10:21,542
He was first seen here.

522
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:24,958
In Øksfjord.

523
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:30,792
And next time here.
Museum at lsnestoften.

524
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:35,375
So it looks as if
he's heading south. Perhaps there.

525
01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:39,333
We have a problem.

526
01:10:40,167 --> 01:10:44,167
A gang dressed as Germans
going bananas out there?

527
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:47,375
Bananas?
They killed loads of different people.

528
01:10:47,542 --> 01:10:52,333
We have not had a murder since 74,
and suddenly there Ragnarok.

529
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:58,083
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Shoot first, ask later!

530
01:11:43,167 --> 01:11:46,833
There is no one here.
We have showed them the door.

531
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,208
They are gone.

532
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:54,708
Since you can not complete the mission, -

533
01:11:54,875 --> 01:11:59,375
- You can just turn
and go back to your snow cave.

534
01:12:27,583 --> 01:12:31,292
Some have grown a bit since last time.
Been a little bigger.

535
01:12:35,125 --> 01:12:38,458
I also taught a couple of buddies
the dance.

536
01:13:24,292 --> 01:13:27,417
Is  it not a bit sour
when you thought someone was dead -

537
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:30,458
- Coming back to kill you?

538
01:13:57,917 --> 01:13:59,875
Let's kill them.

539
01:14:00,042 --> 01:14:01,458
Troops!

540
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:06,250
Attack!

541
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:12,833
Let's kill them all!

542
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:27,958
What the hell is going on here?
Is the carnival in town?

543
01:16:21,667 --> 01:16:23,667
they have tanks?

544
01:16:33,333 --> 01:16:35,417
- Damn!
- Run!

545
01:16:35,583 --> 01:16:37,167
Help!

546
01:17:04,083 --> 01:17:06,542
Daniel! tank.

547
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:22,375
- Should not we help them?
- Help who?

548
01:18:22,542 --> 01:18:27,542
Those with blemishes in german uniform
or those with blemishes in Russian?

549
01:18:57,625 --> 01:18:59,208
<i> okay </ i></i>

550
01:19:12,125 --> 01:19:14,000
Good boy.

551
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:30,125
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph Stalin!
- What the hell's going on?

552
01:19:30,292 --> 01:19:33,542
Do as hell.
Looks like a video game.

553
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:36,167
look Martin Hykkerud!

554
01:19:38,125 --> 01:19:39,583
- Yes!
- Should we take him?

555
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:43,083
No, no.
Wait until it calms down.

556
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:46,750
this is tactical policing.

557
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:15,417
Zombie Squad. It's about time!

558
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:17,958
- thats a long story.
- There was a tank.

559
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:20,458
And guy took my jacket.

560
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:25,625
- looks like you found Stavarin and his men i see.
- Yeah but there's still more them than us .

561
01:20:25,792 --> 01:20:28,625
i guess it's time we even out the odds a bit huh.

562
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:15,250
guys! We're losing!

563
01:21:16,458 --> 01:21:18,292
look!

564
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,042
shit!

565
01:21:32,083 --> 01:21:34,083
No, no, no

566
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:36,333
No!

567
01:21:44,875 --> 01:21:46,583
Wait!

568
01:21:47,417 --> 01:21:49,583
We have to kill him!

569
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:52,458
They're all bound to him like the russians are to you
.

570
01:21:52,625 --> 01:21:55,708
If he dies, the others will too .

571
01:21:58,083 --> 01:22:01,458
lets finish this.

572
01:22:03,542 --> 01:22:05,458
<i> Untermensch. </ i></i>

573
01:23:21,792 --> 01:23:24,833
guys come on.
No seat belts?

574
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,208
You just asking for it.

575
01:23:57,167 --> 01:23:59,958
fuckin hell how many more of these are there?

576
01:24:05,167 --> 01:24:07,917
Is this it?

577
01:24:09,917 --> 01:24:12,542
Monica, is this how it's gonna end?

578
01:24:12,708 --> 01:24:14,417
No, no.

579
01:24:15,375 --> 01:24:17,750
- we're gonna die now?
- No.

580
01:24:20,458 --> 01:24:22,250
Fuck it.

581
01:24:23,583 --> 01:24:25,958
fuck it i'm just gonna say it.
-what?

582
01:24:27,375 --> 01:24:29,083
I, -

583
01:24:29,833 --> 01:24:32,042
- Glenn Kenneth Toivonen, is

584
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,708
No!

585
01:24:36,583 --> 01:24:38,625
- Blake!
- Glenn?

586
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,292
Monica ..

587
01:27:47,917 --> 01:27:50,917
Why did not you just
stay on the mountain?

588
01:27:55,250 --> 01:28:00,542
You got's what you should have.
You got the gold.

589
01:28:04,667 --> 01:28:06,917
But it was not enough.

590
01:28:09,667 --> 01:28:12,833
You were greedy.

591
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,083
wanted more.

592
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:18,167
Blake

593
01:28:21,125 --> 01:28:23,500
- Monica
- watch out!

594
01:28:26,458 --> 01:28:28,292
- Monica!
- Blake!

595
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,625
Blake! No!

596
01:28:45,917 --> 01:28:48,458
That's why you lost.

597
01:28:48,625 --> 01:28:52,000
Because you were greedy.

598
01:28:57,375 --> 01:29:00,500
You know you lost the war?

599
01:29:02,292 --> 01:29:04,917
Lost everything.

600
01:29:06,458 --> 01:29:09,542
ridiculed.

601
01:29:09,708 --> 01:29:12,042
Pathetic.

602
01:29:13,333 --> 01:29:14,917
And you know what?

603
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:18,583
You lose again.

604
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:29,375
No!

605
01:29:42,583 --> 01:29:44,292
My God!

606
01:29:47,375 --> 01:29:49,292
He did it!

607
01:29:49,458 --> 01:29:54,583
- He killed Herzog.
- It worked. I knew it.

608
01:29:56,167 --> 01:29:58,417
Herzog is dead.

609
01:29:58,583 --> 01:30:00,833
He is dead. Yes!

610
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:19,083
that was close.

611
01:30:30,917 --> 01:30:34,333
You did it!
You killed Herzog?

612
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:38,750
i cant believe that that actually worked.

613
01:30:38,917 --> 01:30:41,583
Of course it did.

614
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:44,542
you doubted the Zombie Squad?

615
01:30:46,083 --> 01:30:48,708
Kenneth Glenn, is he ...?

616
01:30:51,167 --> 01:30:53,208
He didnt make it.

617
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:08,375
It's been a true honor
killing zombies with you guys.

618
01:31:09,125 --> 01:31:12,125
you too martin.

619
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:19,958
What is it? Okay.

620
01:31:21,167 --> 01:31:23,833
- You can say it.
- go for it.

621
01:31:27,167 --> 01:31:29,875
May the force be with you.

622
01:31:33,375 --> 01:31:37,375
Really? That one?
Of all the ...? You chose that one?

623
01:31:37,542 --> 01:31:41,667
theres like a million to choose from,
why would you choose that one?

624
01:32:05,792 --> 01:32:09,125
- Where the hell are they?
- I know as hell.

625
01:32:09,292 --> 01:32:13,042
Hell too! Bjarne!

626
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,250
Are you in a coma?

627
01:32:16,417 --> 01:32:18,792
Go and find them, dammit!

628
01:32:22,583 --> 01:32:27,875
I would resolve this matter.
Do not end with a hundred new corpses.

629
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:33,083
Where do we fit it all?
The garage and the freezer is packed.

630
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:36,500
I do not know! I do not know.

631
01:32:42,417 --> 01:32:47,625
The gulls again. They've not
eaten so well since the war.

632
01:32:49,625 --> 01:32:53,250
We should have
the damn machine.

633
01:32:53,417 --> 01:32:56,667
Whoever translates
seagull language to human language.

634
01:32:56,833 --> 01:33:00,500
Then we would fuck me
Jack the matter as an egg.

635
01:33:00,667 --> 01:33:03,542
As an egg.

636
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:58,875
(groan)

637
01:37:04,333 --> 01:37:08,167
