What more do you want from me

17
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:11,350
When the past is proof of your love

18
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:12,980
And I don’t have the courage

19
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:16,180
To escape from the pain forever

20
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,820
Is it too much of me to ask

21
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:25,360
For us to continue in this hypocrisy

22
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:27,740
How much longer will I be able to live

23
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:29,970
In the same lie

24
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:38,540
No, don’t go around bragging, no

25
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,130
That you’ve stolen my heart

26
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:44,220
And I have nothing more [to give]

27
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:52,470
Yes, I’d rather be the loser

28
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,780
The one who has given you everything

29
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:59,640
And I have nothing more [to give]

30
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:01,630
I have nothing more [to give]…

31
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:08,630
I can no longer continue

32
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,920
Resisting that strange sensation

33
00:02:13,929 --> 00:02:15,700
It chills [over] my skin

34
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:18,740
Like the winter out of season

35
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:22,620
Your gaze and my gaze

36
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:27,820
Ignoring each other in the distance

37
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,530
All has become meaningless

38
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:33,370
And emptiness is better than forgetting

39
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:37,520
I prefer to let you go

40
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:41,650
Than to be your prisoner

41
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:43,700
And don’t go around

42
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:46,780
Claiming to be the mistress of my emotions

43
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:54,730
No, don’t go around bragging, no

44
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:58,490
That you’ve stolen my heart

45

And I have nothing more [to give]

46
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:08,820
Yes, I’d rather be the loser

47
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:12,500
The one who has given you everything

48
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:14,450
And I have nothing more [to give]

49
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:22,980
No, don’t go around bragging, no

50
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:26,310
That you’ve stolen my heart

51
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,770
And I have nothing more [to give]

52
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:36,820
Yes, I’d rather be the loser

53
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:40,330
The one who has given you everything

54
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:43,750
And I have nothing more [to give]

55
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,070
I have nothing more [to give]

56
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:53,060
What more do you want from me

57
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:56,220
When the past is proof of your love
