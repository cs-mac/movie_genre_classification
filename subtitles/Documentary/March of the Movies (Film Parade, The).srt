1
00:00:51,422 --> 00:00:54,488
I'm not a Christian,
I'm not an Atheist.

2
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:56,584
I'm not Jewish,

3
00:00:56,585 --> 00:00:57,585
I'm not Muslim.

4
00:00:58,157 --> 00:01:01,355
My Religion..
What I believe in?

5
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,231
Is called, The Constitution
Of The United States Of America.

6
00:01:25,217 --> 00:01:26,307
Hang on.
- Did you get that?

7
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,342
Let me open this up.

8
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:07,436
Okay, go ahead.

9
00:02:10,057 --> 00:02:13,683
If I'm not religious enough
for you, don't vote for me.

10
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:15,990
If I'm not..uh..

11
00:02:16,025 --> 00:02:20,679
Experience enough for you,
don't vote for me.

12
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:25,544
You know what,
Don't vote for me.

13
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:27,513
Don't..
Don't do it.

14
00:02:29,188 --> 00:02:30,390
Whatever you do,
don't vote for me. How's that?

15
00:02:31,094 --> 00:02:32,189
- Okay.
- Okay, thanks.

16
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:36,035
Can we get the monitors up a little,
I'd like the governor to be able to hear himself?

17
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:37,036
You got it.

18
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:43,136
Also, are we gonna put raisers under this podiums,
like we discussed in the pre-conditions?

19
00:02:43,137 --> 00:02:44,137
- No, I know.

20
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,035
we canned inspection last night.

21
00:02:46,418 --> 00:02:47,712
They'll make something slide under there.

22
00:02:47,713 --> 00:02:48,713
- Okay, thank you.

23
00:02:49,054 --> 00:02:50,084
It's just they're few inches short.

24
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:51,085
It makes it hard for him
to read his notes.

25
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:52,086
- Okay.

26
00:02:52,526 --> 00:02:53,881
Gentlemen, Thank you..
and i'll see you in few hours.

27
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,581
I didn't know the governor has trouble
reading his notes. Why doesn't he wear glasses?

28
00:02:57,752 --> 00:02:59,194
No, he doesn't. Just, Pullman's just 5/8.

29
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:01,191
He's gonna look like a Hobbit.

34
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:28,572
<i>Two Democrats are left standing.</i>

<font color="#3399FF">- Let me quote.</font></i>

52
00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:12,211
Let me quote:
" I have no Idea what happens when we die.

53
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:14,711
Maybe, nothing.
Maybe, it's like before we were born".

54
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:17,217
You did write this Governor.

55
00:04:17,218 --> 00:04:18,218
Let me be specific.

56
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:18,901
- Please do.

57
00:04:19,438 --> 00:04:22,267
I was raised a Catholic,
and I am no practising Catholic.

58
00:04:22,302 --> 00:04:23,645
And I have no idea,
What happens after we die.

59
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,682
If the senator does,
then..maybe you should be The President.

60
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:29,775
Is that your idea of being specific?

61
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:31,964
Let me be more specific.

62
00:04:31,965 --> 00:04:32,965
- Thank you.

63
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:35,626
I'm not a Christian or an Atheist.

64
00:04:35,627 --> 00:04:36,627
I'm not Jewish or Muslim.

65
00:04:36,628 --> 00:04:37,628
What I believe...

66
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:40,666
My Religion is written on a piece of paper
called The Constitution.

67
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:44,648
Meaning, that I'd defend until
my dying breath your right to worship..

68
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:47,022
In whatever God you believe in.

69
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:48,023
As long as it doesn't hurt others.

70
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:52,640
I believe, we should be judged as a country
by how we take care of the people..

71
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:53,641
who cannot take care of themselves.

72
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:55,543
That's my religion!

73
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:56,544
If you think i'm not religious enough,
Don't vote for me.

74
00:04:58,142 --> 00:04:59,978
If you think I'm not experience enough
or tall enough..

75
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,114
Then, don't vote for me.

76
00:05:02,115 --> 00:05:03,906
'Cos I can't change that to get elected.

77
00:05:03,907 --> 00:05:08,081
- I just want you to say out loud,
If you believe in the teachings of The Bible?

78
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:11,430
Is this a Democratic primary
or a general election?

79
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:12,431
Well, Governor whoever wins this contest..

80
00:05:12,432 --> 00:05:14,163
will be running for The President.

81
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:15,693
And If you think,
that this questions...

82
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,484
won't be central in the general election.

83
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,485
Then, you're living in Fantasy Land!

84
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:21,696
I'm simply pointing to the obvious.

85
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,609
We are running for
President of The United States.

86
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:26,398
Not, Student Council President.

87
00:05:56,376 --> 00:05:57,404
Fucking National Security.

88
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:00,403
Out of the park.
- Home run.

89
00:06:11,295 --> 00:06:15,903
You know, I'm trying to remember  if the
Democrats have ever nominated an Atheist before.

90
00:06:16,287 --> 00:06:19,486
- Well, we know they've nominated a JackAss before.

91
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:23,012
That must've been you,
that did the prep work..Steven.

92
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:24,013
Paul's not that clever.

93
00:06:24,654 --> 00:06:26,427
- You've always said the brain stuffs about me.

94
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:28,763
I've had the Balls.

95
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:31,363
Well, it looks like
you've got some brains now, too.

96
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,825
Becareful, I just might have
to steal him from you.

97
00:06:38,585 --> 00:06:39,706
What a Prick!

98
00:07:05,898 --> 00:07:07,990
So..Paul, tell me something
I don't know.

99
00:07:07,991 --> 00:07:10,748
Tell me what's going to
happen on the 15th?

100
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:12,822
What?

101
00:07:15,973 --> 00:07:17,450
What do you think, Stevie?

102
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:19,065
- I think it's ours for the taking.
What do you think?

103
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:24,628
What do you think..Ida?

104
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,746
- I'm asking you.

105
00:07:27,244 --> 00:07:29,566
Well, you tell me..I'll tell you.

106
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:30,567
- If I have to say, I'd say...

107
00:07:31,298 --> 00:07:32,738
It will be close.
But, You'll eek it out.

108
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:33,739
Eek?

109
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:37,872
You see, she's trying to get under my skin.

110
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:38,873
- So, what's gonna happen?

111
00:07:38,356 --> 00:07:39,688
Us..by Nine.

112
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:43,044
- So, you're certain you're gonna win here?

113
00:07:43,586 --> 00:07:45,194
Certain? No.
But, confident?  Yeah.

114
00:07:45,195 --> 00:07:46,195
You just said, you'll win by nine.

115
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:47,372
And I think that we will!

116
00:07:47,373 --> 00:07:48,373
But i'm not gonna tell you,
It's a sure thing,

117
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:51,085
I mean, fucking St.Gabriel
could blow his horn on election day..

118
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:53,628
and get his four horsemen
to rig the ballot box for Pullman..

119
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:54,629
and it wouldn't surprise me.

120
00:07:55,756 --> 00:07:58,005
Six Presidentials that I've done
and I've never felt this good.

121
00:07:58,484 --> 00:08:02,049
But, i'm not gonna sit here and say..
Yeah, hey..we'll win Ohio.

122
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,050
Not a chance.

123
00:08:03,747 --> 00:08:07,211
In the last 30 years,  seventy-three Democrats
have run for President..How many have won?

124
00:08:07,212 --> 00:08:08,212
Three.

125
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:10,693
That means, 70 guys have run
with the thought that they had a chance,

126
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:11,694
and they all lost.

127
00:08:12,787 --> 00:08:13,995
- So, you're saying..there's a good chance
that you won't win?

128
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:17,558
Don't twist my words, Ida.
What i'm saying is..

129
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:18,559
I'm not gonna promise you we'll win.

130
00:08:19,508 --> 00:08:22,007
But he's decorated by Bush Senior
from the first Gulf War..

131
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:24,507
He protested the second
and he left the state with a balance..

132
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:27,195
budget and the 4th highest education rate.

133
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:28,196
The Republicans...

134
00:08:28,277 --> 00:08:30,964
have no one out there,
that could touch this guy.

135
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:31,965
So, for this moment;

136
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:35,273
This election...this primary is
the presidential.

137
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:39,329
And that.. Ida..
Is the state of the union.

138
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:42,455
And on that note--

139
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:45,157
I'm gonna take a shit.

140
00:08:47,638 --> 00:08:48,838
So, Steven?

141
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:49,839
- So, Ida.

142
00:08:50,104 --> 00:08:51,101
Steven, Steven..Steven.

143
00:08:51,704 --> 00:08:53,267
- Ida, Ida..Ida.

144
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:54,268
What's going on at the airport?

145
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:55,269
Yeah.

146
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,270
And getting on a plane.

147
00:08:56,511 --> 00:08:58,187
- That's what you do, at the airport. Yeah.

148
00:08:58,188 --> 00:08:59,188
Where's that plane going?

149
00:09:00,097 --> 00:09:01,127
Okay,

150
00:09:01,963 --> 00:09:03,316
I'll give you three guesses.

151
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:05,685
He's not going back to Head Quarters.

152
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:06,686
- Correct.

153
00:09:06,452 --> 00:09:08,071
He's not going to Texas?

154
00:09:08,072 --> 00:09:09,072
- No need.

155
00:09:09,073 --> 00:09:10,073
We're gonna split Texas,
so it's a wash.

156
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:11,692
What if I've said, North Carolina?

157
00:09:12,082 --> 00:09:13,086
- I'll say, a guess.

158
00:09:14,182 --> 00:09:15,448
He's going to North Carolina.

159
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:16,449
- I can't neither confirm or deny that.

160
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,517
I knew it.
Now, tell me why?

161
00:09:18,552 --> 00:09:20,134
I cannot do that.

162
00:09:20,752 --> 00:09:22,056
I hate you.

163
00:09:22,057 --> 00:09:23,057
- You love me.

164
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,256
I love Paul,
You..hate.

165
00:09:25,257 --> 00:09:26,954
You love him,
because he gives you the scoops.

166
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,323
Sexual favours.

167
00:09:28,676 --> 00:09:29,711
You're engaged?

168
00:09:30,261 --> 00:09:32,282
If it meant a good scoop..
My fiancee will understand.

169
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:36,515
You're really buying into this crap.

170
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:39,189
All this take back the country nonsense.

171
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,614
Ida?

172
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:42,967
I'm not naive, okay?

173
00:09:42,968 --> 00:09:45,971
I've worked on more campaigns
most people will have, by the time they're 40.

174
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:48,281
I'm telling you..
This is the One!

175
00:09:49,024 --> 00:09:50,637
You really have drunk the cool-aid?

176
00:09:50,638 --> 00:09:51,638
- I have drunk. It's delicious!

177
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:54,493
Look?

178
00:09:54,523 --> 00:09:56,836
I don't care if he happens to be
leading in the polls..

179
00:09:56,837 --> 00:09:59,295
I don't care if he happens to have
all the right tools..

180
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,310
The truth is..

181
00:10:00,311 --> 00:10:01,311
He's the only one..

182
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:03,288
that's gonna actually
make a differencein peoples lives.

183
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:05,954
Even the people, that hate him.

184
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,966
If Mike Morris is President,
this is more about us..

185
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:10,967
then it does about him.

186
00:10:10,968 --> 00:10:13,735
I don't give a fuck..
If he can't win.

187
00:10:14,151 --> 00:10:15,367
He has to win.

188
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:16,368
- or what?

189
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,130
The world's gonna fall apart?

190
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,694
It won't matter.

191
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,710
Not one bit...

192
00:10:24,252 --> 00:10:27,975
To the everyday lives of the
everyday fuckers, who get up,

193
00:10:27,976 --> 00:10:31,163
and work and eat and sleep.
Go back to work again.

194
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,164
If your boy wins..

195
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,507
You get a job in the White House.

196
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:38,071
He looses, you're back
at a consulting firm on K-street.

197
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:39,072
That's it!

198
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:42,853
You used to know that,
before you got goosebumpy about this guy.

199
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:46,153
Mike Morris is a politician.

200
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,612
He's a nice guy.
They're all nice guys!

201
00:10:50,137 --> 00:10:51,778
He will let you down.

202
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:54,371
Sooner or later.

203
00:11:13,058 --> 00:11:14,142
This is 'off-off' the record.

204
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:15,143
- What?

205
00:11:15,993 --> 00:11:17,306
Franklin Thompson...

206
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:18,307
- Seriously?

207
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:19,308
Off the record.

208
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:20,309
going through the Governor, Steven and Me.

209
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,310
- My lips are sealed.

210
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,169
Tomorrow I have a meeting
at Thompson's house.

211
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,679
- He's going to endorse us?

212
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:27,412
After I'm done talking to him.
What do you think?

213
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:28,668
- That's huge!

214
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:31,190
It's more than huge.

215
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,680
There's 356 pledged delegates..

216
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:35,366
They all travels with him;

217
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:36,367
Puts us over the top.

218
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:39,708
- He said publicly,
he's not gonna endorse anybody.

219
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:40,166
Yeah, well...

220
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,970
That's what they all say,
until you get 'em alone at the room.

221
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:44,046
- So, this is for real?

222
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:45,047
Yup.

223
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:47,165
Just gotta put it in the bag.

224
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,166
- When are you gonna announce?

225
00:11:49,414 --> 00:11:50,804
Nope, that's all you get for now.

226
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,628
Okay, listen up!

227
00:11:55,838 --> 00:11:57,409
These are your new cellphones.

228
00:11:57,581 --> 00:11:59,066
Shelley's pre-programmed the numbers,

229
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:00,067
Thank you Shelley.
No personal calls.

230
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:01,068
Kevin?

231
00:12:01,226 --> 00:12:02,393
If you loose them,

232
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,062
The D.M.C will come to your house.

233
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:06,504
New cellphone,
just gave em all new ones.

234
00:12:06,505 --> 00:12:07,505
I'll get it later.

235
00:12:07,506 --> 00:12:08,506
<i>Morris on TV: ...I gotta believe we can do it.</i>

236
00:12:09,691 --> 00:12:11,296
<i>We have enemies,
we have to understand,</i>

237
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,530
<i> Why our enemies are our enemies?</i>

238
00:12:12,595 --> 00:12:14,558
<i>And see if there's something we can do about it.</i>

239
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:16,852
<i>Besides, just using force.
As we know...</i>

240
00:12:16,887 --> 00:12:20,744
<i>From history, the answer to extremism
can't be extremism.</i>

241
00:12:20,853 --> 00:12:22,006
Fucking kill me.

242
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,046
Where did we get this?

243
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:26,960
Sometime, in Pennsylvania before he annouce.

244
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:28,441
Thank God, he was in overseas.

245
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:30,241
Just get rid of it.

246
00:12:30,242 --> 00:12:31,863
Yeah, but if this was already placed ,
why would this bother us...

247
00:12:31,912 --> 00:12:32,795
Are you fucking stoned?

248
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:35,975
This is exact same piece The Republicans,
are gonna run against him in the general.

249
00:12:35,976 --> 00:12:36,976
We don't need to brag about it.

250
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,418
<i>"Hi, I'm Neville Chamberlain.
I'd like to be your Commander in Chief.</i>

251
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:41,828
- But then, this is gonna come out anyways.

252
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:42,829
It's gonna come out.

253
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,387
But it's not gonna come out
'Paid For It by Us' pal.

254
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:48,787
You think there's any truth,
in this..Pullman having investments..

255
00:12:48,788 --> 00:12:51,287
diamond mines in Liberia?

256
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:52,231
- Still checking on it.

257
00:12:52,232 --> 00:12:54,559
But, we got it from a blog,
who the fuck knows.

258
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,693
- I don't care, if it's true..
I just wanna hear him denying it.

259
00:12:57,145 --> 00:12:58,909
If it's true..Great!
Find out. If not...

260
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:02,147
let them spend the day,
telling The Post,

261
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,148
that he doesn't own
a diamond mine in Liberia.

262
00:13:04,857 --> 00:13:05,894
Win-Win.

263
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:06,895
Okay.

264
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,152
We gotta counter that Christian shit,
we take it from last night.

265
00:13:11,153 --> 00:13:13,426
I need the new 30 in 60 seconds spot.

266
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:15,591
We can show him in
staff meeting this afternoon.

267
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:26,448
Hey.
- Hey.

268
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:28,896
uhh..Ben wanted me
to get you sign off on this,

269
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:30,618
Before the staff meeting.

270
00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:32,250
Thank you, I've been waiting for this.

271
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,218
Anything interesting?

272
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:40,636
Just these some White Paper
I've to hand out tonight.

273
00:13:41,556 --> 00:13:42,682
- What's White Paper?

274
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,225
Negative shits.

275
00:13:46,445 --> 00:13:50,335
Our guys do research..
we feed it to the press and we see what sticks.

276
00:13:50,336 --> 00:13:51,336
- What kind of negative shits?

277
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,965
You'll read it in the paper tomorrow.

278
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:55,966
- Which paper?

279
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:58,718
Any, any paper.

280
00:13:58,719 --> 00:13:59,719
- So, it's something big?

281
00:14:00,385 --> 00:14:01,549
I wish it was something bigger.

282
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:03,422
It's just these..

283
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,540
transportation numbers I'm gonna
have to spend pretty hard to make it stick.

284
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,541
- That's what you're good at though, right?

285
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:09,941
I guess.

286
00:14:11,055 --> 00:14:12,339
Tell him it's fine.

287
00:14:14,617 --> 00:14:15,903
Did you get your new phone?

288
00:14:15,904 --> 00:14:16,904
- Mmmhm.

289
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:19,023
It's really exciting isn't it?

290
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:21,429
What are you, a bearcat?

291
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,636
- Am I a what?

292
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:25,895
Cincinatti bearcat?

293
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:28,898
Ohh! no..i'm not from here.

294
00:14:30,472 --> 00:14:33,259
I worked with you in Iowa, actually.

295
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,401
That's right.

296
00:14:37,058 --> 00:14:38,355
You changed something.

297
00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:40,307
My hair?

298
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,873
You changed your hair?

299
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,262
- No.

300
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,379
I see.

301
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:49,793
I betcha, I look like a
real dumb-ass right now, huh?

302
00:14:49,794 --> 00:14:50,794
- No! not at all.

303
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,935
You're the big man on campus.
I'm just a lowly intern.

304
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,422
Oh, it's not like that.

305
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:57,423
You get to stay at The Millennium.

306
00:14:58,373 --> 00:15:00,193
Okay? They put us in a Motel on the
other side of the river.

307
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,883
You're right.
I am the big man on campus.

308
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:03,884
- Now you're starting to see.

309
00:15:03,727 --> 00:15:04,806
Mmhmm.

310
00:15:04,807 --> 00:15:07,127
We do have a better bar, though.

311
00:15:07,162 --> 00:15:08,041
I've heard that.

312
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:09,653
You should come by, one night.

313
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,350
Have a drink with the worker-bees.

314
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:13,351
I might do that.

315
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,135
I might do that.
What's a good night?

316
00:15:16,136 --> 00:15:17,136
- Tonight's good.
- Tonight?

317
00:15:17,137 --> 00:15:19,290
Tuesday night?
- yeah.

318
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,291
It's quite.

319
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:21,292
Quite's good.

320
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:25,839
Well, you have my number.

321
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:28,033
- I do?

322
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:30,151
It's programmed right there on your phone.

323
00:15:30,965 --> 00:15:31,915
- Uh huh.

324
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,264
Under... Mary.

325
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:35,265
I know your name is Mary.

326
00:15:38,632 --> 00:15:40,109
- My name is Molly.

327
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:54,764
That's what I'm hearing since.

328
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:58,298
Super Tuesday. All of a sudden,
I am a popular guy.

329
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,831
What are the polls telling you?

330
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:02,654
That Pullman's negatives are high.

331
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:05,107
Coming at fourties.

332
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,147
Senator, we have an open seat at White House.

333
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:11,251
Republicans have dick.

334
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:12,896
They're disorganised...

335
00:16:13,645 --> 00:16:16,162
they can't find a nominee,
that's not a world class fucked up.

336
00:16:17,345 --> 00:16:18,807
They look lilke Democrats.

337
00:16:20,123 --> 00:16:22,307
No Republicans are gonna show up
to vote their guy.

338
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:27,034
But if Pullman's got a Democratic nod,
they will show up to vote against him.

339
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:30,086
You think, if they won't for your guy,
you think Morris gets into the independents?

340
00:16:30,558 --> 00:16:31,680
I sure do.

341
00:16:32,173 --> 00:16:33,327
Senator, I'm a bit confused.

342
00:16:35,898 --> 00:16:37,302
We need your delegates.

343
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:40,177
We need you,

344
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,140
your fund raising..

345
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,540
and I guess,

346
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,030
It was my understanding that,

347
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,600
your endorsement, a week for Ohio-

348
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,320
would win this for us.

349
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:00,829
Thank you.

350
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,830
Stella.

351
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,220
Hand me that Ice-bucket.

352
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,231
Is this Paul or is this you?

353
00:17:10,232 --> 00:17:12,024
Paul knows and Paul agrees.

354
00:17:12,025 --> 00:17:14,254
Ben, where's my outback piece on National Service?

355
00:17:14,255 --> 00:17:16,264
It's easy for me to work off with that.

356
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:17,265
- Got it right here.

357
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:19,779
Get me a hard copy,
I hate those fucking things.

358
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,500
-Molly, can you grab that out for me.
- Yeah, one second.

359
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,620
So, Governor if you wanna change...
- Just give me a sec, will you.

360
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,829
Your National Service isn't pulling
the same as the rest of your Domestic Policy.

361
00:17:36,864 --> 00:17:37,380
I don't give a shit about the polling..

362
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,812
Steven, I'm not gonna play this game with you.

363
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,882
This is your,
good cop-bad cop act with Paul.

364
00:17:42,883 --> 00:17:43,883
- Good cop..good cop.

365
00:17:43,884 --> 00:17:44,884
I'm not changing it.

366
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,240
Here we go.

367
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,220
Alright, let's see.

368
00:18:03,266 --> 00:18:04,357
It says, we're gonna..

369
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:07,241
Help them get education,
We're gonna create a national unity.

370
00:18:07,242 --> 00:18:08,242
We're gonna teach young people to trade.

371
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,081
And..we are going to get them out of debt,
from their college loans.

372
00:18:12,082 --> 00:18:13,082
Now, where does that fail?

373
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,083
- All of that is exactly right, Governor.

374
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,930
It's just that,
if you're gonna do it..do it.

375
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,460
Make it mandatory, not voluntary.

376
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,197
That'll poll well.

377
00:18:21,198 --> 00:18:22,198
- Mandatory.

378
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,780
Everybody who turns eighteen or
graduates high-school gives two years of service..

379
00:18:26,781 --> 00:18:27,781
to his or her country.

380
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,249
It could be in the military,
peace corps...

381
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,749
plant a fucking trees..I don't care.
And for that...

382
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,849
your college education is paid for.
Period.

383
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,850
- We do all of that right here.

384
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:36,851
No, sir. You don't.

385
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:37,852
Not all the way.
Do it all the way.

386
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,230
Mandatory.

387
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,820
- Paul likes this?
- Mmmhm.

388
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,820
You're my brain trust.

389
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,668
The beauty of it is,
everybody who's over the age of 18

390
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:49,088
or pass age of eligibility
will be for it.

391
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:50,089
Why not?

392
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,440
And all of the others?

393
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:52,441
Can't vote.

394
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,040
Too young.

395
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,110
Too bad.

396
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,620
You can't loose.

397
00:19:11,185 --> 00:19:12,085
uh, Steven?

398
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,610
You have a call on line 3.

399
00:19:14,645 --> 00:19:16,064
It's your dad.

400
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:16,720
Okay!

401
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,781
You and Ben get working on this
stump speech and you get me a hard copy.

402
00:19:21,782 --> 00:19:22,782
And I'll write it my own words.

403
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,975
Don't forget your Charlie Ross at Six.

404
00:19:24,976 --> 00:19:25,976
- Right.

405
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,139
What am I doing here?

406
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,078
- It's on low form,
he's flying in.

407
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,079
Paul going?

408
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,380
Paul won't be here,
but Ben and I will take you.

409
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,660
Just don't tell me someone just died.

410
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:37,661
<i>- Hey, Steve?</i>

411
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,200
Who is this?

412
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:40,201
<i>- Tom Duffy.</i>

413
00:19:40,202 --> 00:19:42,112
<i>Sorry about the dad bit.</i>

414
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:46,874
<i>I uh, I just figured you wouldn't
my name called out on Morris's Campaign Office.</i>

415
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,190
What do you want?

416
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,550
<i>- You got a couple of minutes,
I'd like to sit down with you?</i>

417
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,110
What for?

418
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:53,111
<i>- Well, it's important.</i>

419
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,410
Well, if it's important,
don't you think you should be calling Paul?

420
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,789
<i>- This is on the up and up, Steve.
Just give me five minutes.</i>

421
00:20:05,824 --> 00:20:06,560
I can't be talking to you.

422
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:07,561
<i>- I hear you.</i>

423
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,007
<i>But if you have five minutes,
I'm gonna be on the Hadfort's sports bar.</i>

424
00:20:11,008 --> 00:20:12,008
<i>For the next couple of hours.</i>

425
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:13,009
I can't, Tom.

426
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,400
<i>- There won't be anybody there.</i>

427
00:20:16,401 --> 00:20:17,401
<i>Okay?</i>

428
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,655
<i>If you get the chance,
there's something I wanna show to you. </i>

429
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,850
Paul, call me back.
It's important.

430
00:20:53,431 --> 00:20:54,544
<i>Tom: You're working for the wrong man.</i>

431
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:55,740
- You are working for the wrong man.
- Oh, on the contrary..

432
00:20:55,741 --> 00:20:58,707
You're working for the wrong man.

433
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,340
And you've got something that
the other guys don't have.

434
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,672
- Oh, yeah?

435
00:21:01,673 --> 00:21:02,673
Yeah, what is that exactly?

436
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,759
Charm..is not the right word.

437
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:05,601
It is the right word.

438
00:21:05,602 --> 00:21:06,602
No, it's more than that.

439
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,620
You exudes something.
You draw people in.

440
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,850
All reporters love you.
Even the ones that hates you.

441
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,050
Love you.

442
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,798
Cos, you play them all like
they're pieces on chess-board.

443
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:17,799
And you make it look, effortless!

444
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,650
We both know, How hard it is.

445
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,673
Constantly be on guard..

446
00:21:22,674 --> 00:21:23,674
weighing every word,
every moment.

447
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,256
From the outside, you make it look easy.

448
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,070
People are scared of you,
cos they don't understand how you do it.

449
00:21:33,071 --> 00:21:34,071
And they love you, for it!

450
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,648
And that is the most
valuable thing in this business.

451
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,300
The ability to win people's respect,

452
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,397
By making them mistake their fear, for love.

453
00:21:43,484 --> 00:21:44,896
You can guess what i'm gonna say next.

454
00:21:44,931 --> 00:21:45,970
- I don't think that I can.

455
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:46,971
I want you to work for us.

456
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,550
- Well, you're kidding.

457
00:21:50,551 --> 00:21:51,551
No, not in the least.

458
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,859
You're gonna loose Ohio.

459
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,860
- I'm not.

460
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,516
You're sitting on about a six percent
lead on both polls.

461
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,315
Six percent of all Democrats poll.

462
00:22:02,316 --> 00:22:03,316
- Eight!

463
00:22:03,317 --> 00:22:04,317
No. Six.

464
00:22:04,318 --> 00:22:05,318
Doesn't matter.

465
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,941
Ohio is an open primary, right.

466
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,890
Independents and Republicans
get to vote on the Democratic candidates.

467
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,700
- Do you think, they like your guy?

468
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,850
A pro-choice tax and spend the roof.

469
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:16,851
Fuck no!
They hate him.

470
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,532
They think they can beat my guy.

471
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,079
But they're very worried about yours.

472
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,913
So, start tomorrow morning,
they're gonna see a fucking blitz.

473
00:22:29,256 --> 00:22:31,561
Lymboyle, Hennedy
all those right wing blocks,

474
00:22:31,562 --> 00:22:33,347
are starting the 'get out the vote' campaign.

475
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:34,850
It's started already.

476
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,040
Every fucking conservative in Ohio..

477
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,320
Is gonna line up around the block,
to punch my guy's ticket.

478
00:22:40,321 --> 00:22:41,321
And that's just one step!

479
00:22:41,322 --> 00:22:42,322
Ohio's gone.

480
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,160
Polls don't mean shit.

481
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,890
Tomorrow morning,
everybody's gonna know.

482
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,126
And that's why, I want you to
handle the fall-out that we'll have in the press.

483
00:22:54,231 --> 00:22:56,093
Oh, we got Thompson in the bag, too.

484
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,096
- I know for a fact,
that you don't have Thompson.

485
00:22:59,097 --> 00:23:00,697
Well, we promised him Secretary of State.

486
00:23:00,732 --> 00:23:03,460
Ohio is over.
It has been over for weeks.

487
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,610
And now with Thompson's delegates?

488
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,190
I'm thinking down the road here, man.

489
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,462
That is why, I want you.

490
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,870
- I can't do it!
- Wring in straight at the top.

491
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,100
I don't need an answer
right this moment.

492
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,136
Look, I play dirty, alright.

493
00:23:21,137 --> 00:23:22,137
I'm sorry to hear that.

494
00:23:22,138 --> 00:23:23,138
- But I don't have to play dirty anymore.

495
00:23:23,139 --> 00:23:24,139
You know why?

496
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,326
I got Morris!

497
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:29,175
None of this is about
The Democratic process, Steve.

498
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:30,176
It is about getting your guy off.

499
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,673
- This is the kind of shit
that The Republicans pull.

500
00:23:31,674 --> 00:23:33,878
Yeah, You know what?
This is the kind of shit,

501
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:34,879
that The Republicans pull.

502
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,305
And it's about time,
that we learn from them.

503
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,530
They're meaner, they are tougher..

504
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:40,403
They are more disciplined than we are.

505
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,290
I've been in this business 25 years,
and I've seen way too many Democrats..

506
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,894
bite the dust.

507
00:23:45,895 --> 00:23:49,125
Because they wouldn't get down the mud,
with the fucking elephants!

508
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,082
Paul's my friend.

509
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,083
You wanna work for the friend..

510
00:23:58,084 --> 00:24:00,376
or do you wanna work for The President?

511
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:02,857
Think about it.

512
00:24:02,892 --> 00:24:03,680
You got my number.

513
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:08,346
Paul?

514
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:10,549
- Is there anymore..?
that we're doing??

515
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,351
Not that I'm aware of.

516
00:24:12,352 --> 00:24:14,144
What's going on with Thompson?

517
00:24:14,145 --> 00:24:17,666
- Ahh, he wants something...

518
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,700
we'll be fine.

519
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:20,701
What's so important?

520
00:24:22,682 --> 00:24:25,047
- Nothing, I've figured it out.

521
00:24:31,258 --> 00:24:32,317
Alright.

522
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,107
I'll be on my cell,
if you need me.

523
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:37,218
I fly D.C..tomorrow.
Will be back tomorrow night.

524
00:24:37,219 --> 00:24:38,219
Okay.

525
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,220
I'll work on the

526
00:24:39,221 --> 00:24:40,221
Good man.

527
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,612
Check the blogs,
if there's any chatter. Would you?

528
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,361
- Chatter? What kind of chatter?

529
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,430
I don't know.
Just see what they're talking about.

530
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,770
Steven, are you still single?

531
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,680
- I'm married to the campaign, Governor.

532
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,558
Married to the campaign.
Good answer.

533
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,667
Wall Street Journal has us number
holding steady..

534
00:25:06,668 --> 00:25:07,668
Pullman dropped a point.

535
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:08,669
- Really?

536
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,670
- When did they do that?
- I'm checking it out.

537
00:25:10,196 --> 00:25:13,020
Governor, The Wall Street Journal
numbers are in and Pullman's down a point.

538
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:14,120
- We are moving in a right direction.

539
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,050
Ben, are you still single?

540
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,990
- Married to the campaign, Governor.

541
00:25:18,991 --> 00:25:19,991
Crack team.

542
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,850
Make sure Charlie Ross has
those numbers before he goes on.

543
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,400
Get a copy of the show
before we leave too.

544
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,560
Is it a difficult decision?
I have to believe it is.

545
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,574
Would I do it?

546
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:34,575
No. But...

547
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,718
I can't see myself or anyone..
certainly not a government, telling a woman..

548
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:38,719
what she should do with her body.

549
00:25:39,945 --> 00:25:41,960
So, you would appoint a Judge?
- We'd consider it arrogant...

550
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,960
to judge anyone..
until i've walked in their shoes.

551
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,160
- But you're against the death penalty?

552
00:25:47,161 --> 00:25:48,161
Mmhmm.

553
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,205
Because of what it says about us,
as a society.

554
00:25:50,206 --> 00:25:52,238
- Suppose Governor,
It was your wife?

555
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,239
- If she's murdered?

556
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,150
What would I do?

557
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,240
It gets more complicated
when it's personal.

558
00:25:56,241 --> 00:25:57,241
Sure.

559
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,310
Well, If I could get to him.

560
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,460
I would find a way to kill him.

561
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,980
- So, You...you governor
would impose a death penalty?

562
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:09,580
No, I would commit a crime,
for which I'd happily go to jail.

563
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,141
- Then, why not
let the society, Do that?

564
00:26:13,176 --> 00:26:15,300
Because society, has to be better
than the individual.

565
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,505
If I were to do that,
I would be wrong!

566
00:26:18,506 --> 00:26:19,506
- What about guns?

567
00:26:19,507 --> 00:26:20,507
Isn't it time for commercial?

568
00:26:20,508 --> 00:26:24,041
- This is a public television.
We don't have any commercial.

569
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,071
That's unfortunate.

570
00:26:25,106 --> 00:26:26,550
Where did you go after Iowa?

571
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:30,023
- California.
Super Tuesday.

572
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,770
I had to got to New York.

573
00:26:32,771 --> 00:26:33,771
- I know.

574
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,055
You guys need even a lot more help, overthere.

575
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,760
So, Why politics?

576
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,883
- Because the pay is so good, obviously.

577
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,250
It seems like a very odd...

578
00:26:50,615 --> 00:26:51,487
fit.

579
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,160
My dad is Jack Stearns.

580
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,020
He's a good guy.

581
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,020
- He's an Asshole.

582
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,800
But, he is your boss.

583
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,290
He is not my boss.

584
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,910
He is the head of The DMC.

585
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,592
- You don't work for
The Democratic National Committee?

586
00:27:11,593 --> 00:27:12,593
No, I work for Paul.

587
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,900
Paul work for Morris.
If Morris wins, He's gonna be your Dad's Boss.

588
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,410
- Don't tell my dad that.

589
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,710
I don't tell your dad, a lot of things.

590
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,590
- Never.

591
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,180
What time you got work tomorrow?

592
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,790
- Nine A.M.

593
00:27:33,947 --> 00:27:36,152
I'm showing the new interns
how to rope all call.

594
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,190
Cos i'm an experienced intern.

595
00:27:38,191 --> 00:27:39,191
You see?

596
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,900
I see.

597
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,138
How old are you?

598
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,380
How old you think, I am?

599
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,270
- Thirty.

600
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,510
You think I'm Thirty?

601
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,880
- I am Sorry,

602
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,340
How old are you?

603
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:00,341
Thirty.

604
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,560
How old are you?

605
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,290
- How old do you think, I am?

606
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,970
Twenty-one?

607
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:12,971
Twenty.

608
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,860
That's young.

609
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,300
- Is it too young to fuck a thirty year old?

610
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,480
Well..

611
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,900
You see, Laws are different in different States.

612
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,110
Here...

613
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,740
Your Hotel here in Kentucky,
It's frowned upon.

614
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,060
But,

615
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:41,130
We go across the bridge in Ohio?

616
00:28:41,131 --> 00:28:42,131
- Oh, where your hotel is.

617
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,270
Yeah, surprisingly..they're very laxed
in their Child Endangerment Laws.

618
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,550
- Do you have a car?
I don't drive.

619
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,860
I took a cab.

620
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,860
- I have the keys to the campaign bus.

621
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:03,527
<i>TV Reporter:
It fairness this has been tried before.</i>

622
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:06,103
<i>'Operation Chaos' as Russ Limbaugh called it.</i>

623
00:29:06,104 --> 00:29:08,611
<i>Where, Republicans voted for a Democrat..</i>

624
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,976
<i>they thought they could beat
in the General Election.</i>

625
00:29:10,977 --> 00:29:13,587
<i>We asked Sen.Pullman's campaign manager..</i>

626
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:16,347
<i>If he's happy the votes of Right-Wingers?</i>

627
00:29:16,348 --> 00:29:17,934
Is it decisive?

628
00:29:17,969 --> 00:29:19,266
No. Of course not.

629
00:29:19,267 --> 00:29:22,302
But look, we believe that
the polls are within the margin of error.

630
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:24,919
And that the..uh Senator
will win Ohio.

631
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,100
Yeah, What time is Paul getting in?

632
00:29:27,762 --> 00:29:28,673
Shit.

633
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,750
Who do we talk to about polling?

634
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:34,270
I gotta get some internal polling
at the independents and fucking wing nuts.

635
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:36,816
- Do you want me to go?

636
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:37,817
Wait.

637
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,500
What's that guy's name
from The Wall Street Journal?

638
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:40,501
- You sound busy, I should go.

639
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,410
Can you hold on a second,
I'd like to talk to you about something.

640
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,790
Adler? Yeah,
get him on the line.

641
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,570
Nobody.
The cleaning lady.

642
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,020
Get him on the line..and tell him
we're gonna take the same position we always sat.

643
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,320
The race is a lot close than the polling.

644
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,040
No, don't say that. Don't.

645
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,990
Just get him on the line,
call me..and I'll take care of it.

646
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,730
I'm sorry.

647
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,810
- Cleaning Lady?

648
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:05,811
Yeah.

649
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,700
You called me the cleaning lady.

650
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,310
You're not mad about that, are you?

651
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:12,960
- No, why would i be mad?

652
00:30:12,961 --> 00:30:13,961
Alright.

653
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,370
Oh hey! look..

654
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,958
Your dad is an asshole.

655
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,959
- I'm gonna tell him,
you said that.

656
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,230
Yeah, do that.

657
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,160
You wanted to talk to me about something?

658
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,020
Yeah, I just want it to be clear.
I don't want there to be any confusion.

659
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,930
- I'm not gonna tell anybody
about last night.

660
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,840
- That'll be great. If we kept it between us.
You know how people are.

661
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,010
Yeah.

662
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,190
Really wouldn't look good,
if you screwed an intern.

663
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,690
It's not like that.

664
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,261
It's not like i got drunk
and this happened. I like you.

665
00:31:01,262 --> 00:31:03,406
I just don't want there
to be any expectations, you know.

666
00:31:03,441 --> 00:31:04,800
- Steven, you don't have to say anything.

667
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,200
Alright.

668
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,940
I just don't
want you to think i'm a player.

669
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,980
You're kind of a player.

670
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,730
I was being polite.

671
00:31:15,731 --> 00:31:16,731
Bullshit.

672
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,670
You were trying to pick me up.

673
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,780
No, I wasn't.

674
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:22,198
You're pretty obvious about it.

675
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,150
I was?

676
00:31:23,151 --> 00:31:24,151
Yeah.

677
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,561
I thought,
I was being smooth and subtle.

678
00:31:26,562 --> 00:31:27,562
No, you are pretty forward.

679
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,620
You are pretty forward.
Asking me in a bar.

680
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:31,870
Well,

681
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,591
I've been trying to fuck you
for a while.

682
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,900
Wow!

683
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,134
It's kinda slutty of me, huh?

684
00:31:40,135 --> 00:31:41,135
I don't know.

685
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,930
I respected it in a strange way.

686
00:31:42,931 --> 00:31:43,931
Good.

687
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,110
You have absolutely no idea,
how to tie a tie are you?

688
00:31:49,111 --> 00:31:50,111
No, no..I don't have a clue.

689
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,420
You're very mature.

690
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,960
- For a teenager.

691
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:03,178
When are you coming back?

692
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:05,199
- I'll be at the event, a little late.

693
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,797
These cocksuckers..
fucking dirty shit!

694
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:09,771
What happened with Thompson?

695
00:32:09,772 --> 00:32:10,772
- Nothing!

696
00:32:10,773 --> 00:32:11,773
Prick...

697
00:32:13,341 --> 00:32:14,575
sold out motherfucker.

698
00:32:14,576 --> 00:32:15,576
How bad is it?

699
00:32:19,628 --> 00:32:20,469
I don't know.

700
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:23,561
I just...I'm running the numbers, Paul.

701
00:32:23,562 --> 00:32:26,327
- Alright, I'll be there in three hours.

702
00:32:26,328 --> 00:32:29,397
I want hard numbers..
and the strategies.

703
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:30,398
Yeah, I'm on it.

704
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,399
I gotta go.

705
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,473
You, okay?

706
00:32:46,474 --> 00:32:49,212
Yeah, i'm just trying to figure out,
how it stops in the mind.

707
00:32:49,213 --> 00:32:50,213
- The weather will determind that.

708
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,910
If we get there.

709
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:53,920
- We're gonna be fine.

710
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,776
We have to do it and...

711
00:32:56,777 --> 00:32:57,777
It's the right thing to do.

712
00:32:57,778 --> 00:33:00,300
And nothing bad happens
when you're doing the right thing.

713
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:03,010
Is this your personal theory?
Cos I can shoot holes in it.

714
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,490
Roberta Clemedia on a humanitarian flight.

715
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,110
- Well, there is...

716
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,380
There's exceptions to every rule.

717
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,600
So, how are you doing?

718
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,770
- I think, we are fine now.

719
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,540
No, the campaign.
How are we doing?

720
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,880
- Oh, Great.

721
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,571
Steven, you are not Paul.

722
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:27,572
I pay Paul, to use the word 'Great',

723
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:30,082
I pay you to tell me the truth.

724
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,520
- I think that we are solid.

725
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,050
Okay, Paul.

726
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,620
- Governor, there's a big difference
between Paul and Me.

727
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,940
Paul only believes in winning.
So, he'll do or say anything, to win.

728
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,720
But, You wouldn't?

729
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,070
I'll do or say anything,
to what I believe it in.

730
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,440
But, I have to believe in the cause.

731
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:56,050
Oh, you'll make a lousy consultant
when you're out on this line of work.

732
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,080
- Well, I won't be out of work in this line,
as long as you are in it, Sir.

733
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,830
So, at best you got eight years.

734
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,610
And you'll end up with a nice little
consultant firm off Fairgate North.

735
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,680
Making 750 grand a year
eating at The Palm..

736
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,290
pimping out ex-senators to..

737
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,470
Saudi Princess.

738
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,247
- Pimping out ex-presidents.

739
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,681
Well, I better win.

740
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:21,780
- Yeah.

741
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,700
Now, I've been married for...

742
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,220
eleven years.

743
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,330
We have a normal marriage.

744
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,570
Which means,
When we disagree...

745
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,460
She wins.

746
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:38,370
But, what we never disagree on is,
How we're gonna leave this planet for our daughter.

747
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,200
Are we gonna leave it,
Better off..

748
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,490
or worse.

749
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,930
The riches people in this country,
don't pay their fair share.

750
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,659
And when they're asked to,
they cry socialism,

751
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,959
they use phrases like,
'redistribution of wealth'.

752
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,760
That scares everybody
and they all run and they hide.

753
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,550
For the record,

754
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:06,065
My campaign is vehemently
against the distribution of wealth,

755
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:08,785
to the riches Americans by our government!

756
00:35:08,786 --> 00:35:09,786
And I will run on that.

757
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,820
I met with Tom Duffy, yesterday.

758
00:35:28,076 --> 00:35:29,089
- What?

759
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,590
You were on the plane,
when he called me.

760
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,527
And he asked, if we can meet.
I said, Why?

761
00:35:33,528 --> 00:35:34,528
He said, it was very important.
And so, I did.

762
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:39,198
And I should've fucking told you. I'm sorry.
- Stop! Stop!

763
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:41,303
Let me get this straight.
You met with Tom Duffy?

764
00:35:41,304 --> 00:35:42,304
Yeah.

765
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,450
What did he want, Steven?

766
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,392
The gist, he wants to hire me.

767
00:35:47,393 --> 00:35:49,309
He wants me to jump ship and
come and work for him.

768
00:35:49,344 --> 00:35:50,737
This is really fucking bad.

769
00:35:50,738 --> 00:35:51,738
He told me that they had poll numbers,

770
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,531
that had Pullman ahead by four.

771
00:35:53,532 --> 00:35:56,537
And the big fucking trouble is
he laid out their strategy..

772
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,320
rob all calls, traffic jam,
fake leave and Thompson.

773
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,930
They offered Thompson,
Secretary of State.

774
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,230
You know,
How you fight the war on terror?

775
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:09,304
You don't need their product anymore,
their product is oil,

776
00:36:09,305 --> 00:36:11,903
Just don't need it
and they go away!

777
00:36:14,147 --> 00:36:15,341
We don't have to bomb anyone,

778
00:36:15,376 --> 00:36:17,571
We don't have to
invade anyone!

779
00:36:20,627 --> 00:36:22,768
If this is some kind of
fucking practical...I mean..

780
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:26,741
My fucking blood pressure is going
through the god damn roof, right now.

781
00:36:26,742 --> 00:36:27,742
- Paul, I'm sorry.

782
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,100
Believe me.

783
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,961
I just didn't think it was true.
- It doesn't matter what you fucking thought!

784
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:39,227
It matters what you did
and it matters, what you didn't do!

785
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,690
Because if all this shit is true?
I made a fucking ass out of myself in Thompson's place..

786
00:36:43,691 --> 00:36:44,691
And I gave away our game plan.

787
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,880
- Please believe me that,
I honestly believed that you're gonna come back,

788
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:49,854
And you were gonna tell me that
we have Thompson in the bag.

789
00:36:49,855 --> 00:36:50,855
I didn't see the point.

790
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,760
It doesn't make it right,
and I am sorry!

791
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,250
Let me think.

792
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,780
Let me think.

793
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,980
If I am your President..

794
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,750
the first thing I'd put in motion is
ten years from the day I take office...

795
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:08,440
No new car in America is run on
an internal combustion engine.

796
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:15,920
We will create hundreds of thousands
of new jobs. We will start...

797
00:37:15,921 --> 00:37:18,214
the next technological revolution.

798
00:37:18,215 --> 00:37:19,215
And we will lead the world again!

799
00:37:20,523 --> 00:37:21,933
Like we used to.

800
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,635
We get the governor
right after he finishes singing kumbayah,

801
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:28,636
and we give him everything we know.

802
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,285
- Who do you want?
- You, Me and The Governor.

803
00:37:32,286 --> 00:37:33,286
That's it!

804
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,070
What's he have, after?

805
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:37,020
- He has a fund raiser...
- We'll be late.

806
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:40,090
We are gonna tell him that
if he doesn't offer Thompson the Cabinet position..

807
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,800
He's not gonna get the nomination.

808
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,488
- And he's gonna go for it?

809
00:37:43,489 --> 00:37:44,489
Fucking no, Steven.

810
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,610
Find us a room.

811
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,730
How do we look at the numbers?

812
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,290
We might pick up a few points,
but we loose by 3 or 4 percent.

813
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:44,291
- Who the fucking knows, governor?

814
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,580
But we can't take the chance.

815
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,160
What do you think?

816
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,308
I think we follow up the campaign in Ohio.

817
00:38:50,309 --> 00:38:51,309
Take a loss, while the republicans
are playing games, head to North Carolina.

818
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,154
I can't run from Ohio,
they'd kill us.

819
00:38:56,155 --> 00:38:57,155
- Not if you get Thompson's endorsement.

820
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,826
I'm not gonna do it.
What does he want?

821
00:38:59,827 --> 00:39:00,827
The FDA or something?

822
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,271
- A Cabinet post.

823
00:39:03,272 --> 00:39:04,648
Yeah, what labour?

824
00:39:04,649 --> 00:39:05,649
- State.

825
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,094
Are you fucking kidding me?

826
00:39:09,095 --> 00:39:13,198
I'm gonna give Sec.of State to a guy who wants
to cut the top ten floors off the U.N?

827
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:17,385
Paul, when we started this campaign,
I said I wasn't gonna make those kind of deals...

828
00:39:17,386 --> 00:39:20,169
- Gov. if we loose Ohio and they get
Thompson's delegates..

829
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,490
Then they get North Carolina,
Then, they get the lead!

830
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,880
A lead we can't beat.

831
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,980
But if we walk from Ohio..
take Thompson, give him the fucking cabinet post

832
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,990
then we take North Carolina,

833
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:34,020
His state. Then, Pennsylvania..
your state..

834
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,600
and then, it's simple math..

835
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:36,601
Mike.

836
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,960
Take his endorsement and the race is over.

837
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,310
Paul, i respect you.

838
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,980
I respect your opinion.

839
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,900
I'm never gonna do it.

840
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,410
So, I suggest..
we find a way for me to win Ohio.

841
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,200
Anything else?

842
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:06,740
It's not gonna cut it.
I need to send it.

843
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,060
Fuck..Jess,
I gotta call you back.

844
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,010
- All of them?
- All of them.

845
00:40:11,011 --> 00:40:12,011
It's killing me!

846
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,622
Here's what i got so far.

847
00:40:13,623 --> 00:40:14,623
Independent's aren't biting
what the republicans are.

848
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:19,787
They're not gonna tell polls
to the devoting Democratics.

849
00:40:19,788 --> 00:40:22,334
- Alright, I also made a call
and i'm gonna get a 100 vans..

850
00:40:22,335 --> 00:40:23,335
out of Covington
and Newport, Kentucky.

851
00:40:23,336 --> 00:40:25,392
We don't need the fucking vans.

852
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,270
We were the under-dog before we got into this,
and we continue to be the underdog.

853
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:36,300
Well then...yeah, we always knew the number's
gonna get closer to closer as it get to tuesday.

854
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:41,800
We're not lowering expectations,
have i ever said to you that we had Ohio locked?

855
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,460
Well then, at least give me the courtesy
of printing that in the column.

856
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,470
What are you writing?

857
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,380
- The greatest speech ever given
on hydrogen power.

858
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,880
The bar is set awefully high on that one.

859
00:40:57,881 --> 00:40:58,881
I know it.

860
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,029
I was hit up by Mitchel's wife,

861
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:08,580
for you to show up at her
Daughters of the American Revolution lucheon.

862
00:41:08,581 --> 00:41:09,581
- Who's Mitchel?

863
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,470
Congressman from the first district.

864
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,450
You might wanna remember that.

865
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,460
- Fucking congressman.

866
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,940
Can you imagine doing this
every two years?

867
00:41:20,941 --> 00:41:21,941
No, I can't.

868
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,690
Let's just do it, one more time.

869
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,474
and four more years.

870
00:41:27,475 --> 00:41:28,475
That's it.

871
00:41:28,476 --> 00:41:29,476
- That's a deal.

872
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,520
Do you think we'd loose Ohio?

873
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,330
- I don't know.

874
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,590
If you took Thompson's delegates.

875
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,829
The race would be over.

876
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:45,830
Ohio wouldn't matter.

877
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,680
- Is Paul working on you?

878
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:55,410
Steven.

879
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,490
- They're good.

880
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:03,280
Is Thompson so bad?

881
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,984
- He is a shit.

882
00:42:04,985 --> 00:42:05,985
Is he worse than Pullman?

883
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,800
- Yes, Steven.

884
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,580
I will tell them,
i am gonna draw a line on the sand,

885
00:42:18,581 --> 00:42:19,581
then denial.

886
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:21,000
I'm gonna move it.

887
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,610
Fund raiser, union deals...
I will do any of it.

888
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,550
Negative ads??

889
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,190
I can't on this one,

890
00:42:32,464 --> 00:42:33,587
Not, Thompson.

891
00:42:39,763 --> 00:42:42,352
Tell Mrs.Mitchel,
I'll make her God damn luncheon.

892
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,970
All they'll do is pat me on the head.

893
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,100
- You've got great hair.

894
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:53,560
Gay marriage?

895
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:54,960
- It's a silly argument.

896
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,379
Not to fifty percent of Americans.

897
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,380
- Over the age of fifty.

898
00:42:58,381 --> 00:42:59,381
That's who votes..

899
00:42:59,382 --> 00:43:01,178
That's who shows up at the polls.

900
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:02,179
- Well, that's changed.

901
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,427
And hopefully, the way we frame
the argument is as well.

902
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,580
But one can argue a great difference...

903
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,060
Between, gender and race.

904
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,610
- Not really. We used to ban
inter-racial marriages, women couldn't vote..

905
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:15,870
Paul,

906
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,448
the guy from  Procter and Gamble.

907
00:43:17,449 --> 00:43:18,449
- Keep an eye on the governor.

908
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:19,450
Okay.

909
00:43:19,451 --> 00:43:20,451
I don't know what's going on there.

910
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:25,686
Wait, wait...wait.
She's got a point to make.

911
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:26,687
That's okay, go ahead.

912
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:30,863
The argument is that man and women
can in fact be considered separate but equal..

913
00:43:30,864 --> 00:43:31,864
races cannot.

914
00:43:31,865 --> 00:43:32,865
- How so?

915
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:35,558
We have separate public bathrooms
for both man and women.

916
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:38,520
But, it will be illegal
to have separate bathrooms for two races.

917
00:43:38,521 --> 00:43:39,521
Now...

918
00:43:39,522 --> 00:43:40,522
Yes, now.

919
00:43:43,681 --> 00:43:45,006
What time's this hearing?

920
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:47,330
- Nine O'clock.
- How're we doing?

921
00:43:47,331 --> 00:43:48,331
We're doing good.

922
00:45:39,822 --> 00:45:40,886
Hey, your phone rang.

923
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:42,990
Your phone rang.

924
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,100
Who's calling you at 2:30 in the morning?

925
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:49,855
- I don't know.

926
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:51,940
Hmm? He asked you by name.

927
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,560
- You answered it?

928
00:45:54,561 --> 00:45:55,561
I thought, it was my phone.

929
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,340
Who's it?

930
00:45:59,014 --> 00:46:00,149
- I don't know.

931
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,820
Is it one of those interns,
drunk dialing it?

932
00:46:04,552 --> 00:46:05,841
- No, that never happens.

933
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,310
Let me see the number.

934
00:46:08,311 --> 00:46:09,311
Ohh, boy!

935
00:46:09,312 --> 00:46:10,312
I can't believe it.

936
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,314
No..I'm calling him.
- Steven, stop! It's not funny.

937
00:46:12,315 --> 00:46:13,315
I'm saying, I'm your dad.
- Steven, it's not funny,

938
00:46:13,316 --> 00:46:14,316
give me my phone.

939
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,784
Hang up.

940
00:46:15,785 --> 00:46:17,609
Steven, hang up the phone!

941
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:39,979
Why is the governor calling you,
at 2:30 in the morning?

942
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:45,811
Molly?

943
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:50,210
Why is the governor calling you, at all?

944
00:46:54,213 --> 00:46:55,283
- I'm in trouble.

945
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,010
With the governor?

946
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:03,090
What's going on?

947
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:10,607
- I was working on the campaign in Iowa,

948
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,645
there was a party in Ben's room,
after the rally party in Des Moines.

949
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,250
There's a party, with You and Ben...

950
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:19,930
and the governor?

951
00:47:21,306 --> 00:47:22,476
- No, he wasn't there.

952
00:47:22,511 --> 00:47:23,180
Where was he?

953
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:29,347
- I took him up a hard copy
of the polling numbers.

954
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:32,611
After the party?

955
00:47:34,317 --> 00:47:35,652
- It was around mid-night.

956
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:39,710
I just stood,
in the doorway with him.

957
00:47:41,816 --> 00:47:44,113
Just...talking-
for a really long time.

958
00:47:49,436 --> 00:47:51,340
He just reached behind me
and closed the door.

959
00:47:58,981 --> 00:48:00,834
Jesus 'fucking' Christ!

960
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:12,270
Were you drunk?

961
00:48:14,361 --> 00:48:15,522
- Not that drunk.

962
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,010
How many times?

963
00:48:19,011 --> 00:48:20,011
- It was just that once.

964
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,456
Does anybody know?

965
00:48:21,457 --> 00:48:22,457
- No one knows.

966
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:23,458
Did anybody see you?
- No!

967
00:48:23,459 --> 00:48:24,459
How can you know?

968
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,460
I know!

969
00:48:25,461 --> 00:48:26,461
Then, why's he calling you right now?

970
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,030
- I called him first.

971
00:48:30,181 --> 00:48:30,772
Why?

972
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:32,280
- Because I didn't know,
who else to go to.

973
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,270
And I needed nine-hundred bucks.

974
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,330
For what?

975
00:48:42,624 --> 00:48:43,781
- I can't go to my dad.

976
00:48:48,129 --> 00:48:49,230
We are Catholic.

977
00:49:00,094 --> 00:49:01,251
So..what should I do?

978
00:49:03,605 --> 00:49:04,595
Steven?

979
00:50:29,588 --> 00:50:30,512
What's up?

980
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,700
What's our limit on petty cash?

981
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,840
- It's about five-hundred.

982
00:50:38,841 --> 00:50:39,841
Why?

983
00:50:39,842 --> 00:50:40,842
I need everything we can get.

984
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,350
Is everythign okay?

985
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,500
You need help with anything?

986
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:46,730
- Yeah, don't put it in the books.

987
00:50:46,731 --> 00:50:47,731
That's all.

988
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,988
- Ohh, what should I put in down instead?

989
00:50:53,989 --> 00:50:54,989
Don't put it down, that's it.

990
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:57,300
Okay, anything above hundred,
I gotta put it down...

991
00:50:57,301 --> 00:50:58,301
- Just do it!

992
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,350
Molly?

993
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,859
<i>'Meet me at the stairwell, at noon'</i>

994
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,996
Okay.

995
00:51:32,164 --> 00:51:33,299
I'll take that back.

996
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,179
Yes, Ida?

997
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,231
<i>- Stevie, off the record.</i>

998
00:52:06,016 --> 00:52:08,815
No, I cannot tell you,
what happened in North Carolina.

999
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:10,940
<i>- That's not what I wanted to ask you about.</i>

1000
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:12,680
Okay, what?

1001
00:52:13,582 --> 00:52:15,085
<i>- You met with Duffy.</i>

1002
00:52:18,884 --> 00:52:19,865
Who told you that?

1003
00:52:19,866 --> 00:52:20,866
<i>- A little bird.</i>

1004
00:52:22,682 --> 00:52:23,630
WHO?

1005
00:52:23,665 --> 00:52:24,490
<i>- Did you meet with him?</i>

1006
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:27,660
Where are you?

1007
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:32,042
I know that you met with him in a little bar
in Cinci. two days ago..

1008
00:52:32,043 --> 00:52:33,043
just before the press conference.

1009
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,030
Duffy ordered buffalo wings.

1010
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:36,638
Who said that? Duffy?

1011
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:37,639
- Annonymous.

1012
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,820
What happened with Duffy?

1013
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:41,033
Ida, you're supposed to be my friend..

1014
00:52:41,034 --> 00:52:43,636
Why'd you wanna stickthe fucking knife
at me, on a bullshit story?

1015
00:52:43,637 --> 00:52:44,637
- Is that what you thought,
that we are friends?

1016
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,604
I've given you
anything you've ever wanted.

1017
00:52:46,605 --> 00:52:47,605
Everything. Every story..every scoop..

1018
00:52:47,606 --> 00:52:48,606
You're entire profile with Paul.
- You're right, you've given me a lot.

1019
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,185
But, let's get real here Steve.

1020
00:52:51,186 --> 00:52:53,541
The only reason you've ever
treated me well was that I work for The Times.

1021
00:52:53,542 --> 00:52:54,542
Not because i'm your friend.

1022
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,105
You give me what i want..
I write you better stories.

1023
00:52:57,106 --> 00:52:58,106
Don't pretend,
it's any more than that.

1024
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:59,730
Why did you meet with Duffy?

1025
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:01,940
- Go fuck yourself!

1026
00:53:01,941 --> 00:53:03,801
Okay..I'll make it easier on you,
forget Duffy.

1027
00:53:03,802 --> 00:53:06,283
What happened in
Paul and Thompson's meeting?

1028
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:07,284
- Would you keep your voice down?

1029
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:09,860
Do you have any idea,
what this could do to me?

1030
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:12,530
Of course, I do.
That's why i'm giving you a choice, here.

1031
00:53:12,531 --> 00:53:14,609
- I could get fired.

1032
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:16,270
So, it's not a difficult one, Is it?

1033
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:19,245
I've gotta file my three pm, tomorrow.

1034
00:53:19,246 --> 00:53:21,105
You've got till then,
to make up your mind.

1035
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,740
You motherfucker!

1036
00:53:25,741 --> 00:53:26,741
<i>- Excuse me?</i>

1037
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,460
You leaked it.

1038
00:53:28,461 --> 00:53:29,461
<i>- Leaked, what?</i>

1039
00:53:29,462 --> 00:53:30,462
Don't bullshit me, Tom.

1040
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,223
<i>- Bullshit you?
I have no idea what you're talking about.</i>

1041
00:53:34,224 --> 00:53:35,224
I just spoke to Ida Horowicz.

1042
00:53:35,225 --> 00:53:36,225
<i>- Yeah?</i>

1043
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,070
She's treatening to release the story.

1044
00:53:39,352 --> 00:53:40,383
<i>- What fucking story?</i>

1045
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,384
That we met.

1046
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,385
That we fucking met!

1047
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:43,386
<i>- How did she find out?</i>

1048
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:44,387
Don't..play dumb, Tom.

1049
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,990
<i>- You think, I leaked it to her?</i>

1050
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:48,991
Yeah, who else?

1051
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:50,919
<i>- You know what?
I didn't leaked it to her, Steve.</i>

1052
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,532
Well, I know I didn't.
So, that leaves you.

1053
00:53:52,533 --> 00:53:53,533
<i>- Okay.</i>

1054
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:54,534
<i>What, what does she know?</i>

1055
00:53:54,535 --> 00:53:55,535
She knows whatever you told her.

1056
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:59,784
<i>- I swear to Jesus,
I did not leaked it to her, Steve.</i>

1057
00:53:59,785 --> 00:54:01,865
<i>I don't want the story out
anymore than you do.</i>

1058
00:54:01,866 --> 00:54:02,866
Well, too late!

1059
00:54:04,103 --> 00:54:05,056
<i>- What did she tell you?</i>

1060
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:06,992
She know where we met,

1061
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:07,993
she knows, when we met.

1062
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,591
She knows, you had
fucking buffalo wings..

1063
00:54:10,592 --> 00:54:11,592
<i>- She has a source?</i>

1064
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,060
Yeah, she has a source.

1065
00:54:13,061 --> 00:54:15,149
<i>- And, you have no idea,
Who it could be?</i>

1066
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:16,250
Yeah, You!

1067
00:54:18,161 --> 00:54:19,045
<i>- Well, for the record.</i>

1068
00:54:19,046 --> 00:54:21,978
<i>It was not me..
and I didn't have fucking buffalo wings!</i>

1069
00:54:22,013 --> 00:54:23,879
<i>So, it's gotta be someone else.</i>

1070
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,880
Did you tell anyone?

1071
00:54:24,881 --> 00:54:25,881
<i>- No. Did you?</i>

1072
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:26,640
No.

1073
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,464
<i>- Did you admit to meeting with me?</i>

1074
00:54:29,465 --> 00:54:30,465
No.

1075
00:54:30,466 --> 00:54:31,466
<i>- Alright.</i>

1076
00:54:31,467 --> 00:54:34,132
<i>Then, we stonewall her,
and she's got nothing.</i>

1077
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:37,130
She's gonna take this story to Drudge
or to RollCall...

1078
00:54:37,131 --> 00:54:38,131
or to some shit like that.

1079
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,280
<i>- You can't stop her?</i>

1080
00:54:39,281 --> 00:54:42,614
She's trying to blackmail me.
She wants info about Thompson.

1081
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,310
<i>- Well then tell her,
what she wants to know.</i>

1082
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:47,464
I can't do that.

1083
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:50,010
<i>- You can't let this story get out.</i>

1084
00:54:50,011 --> 00:54:51,613
I'm not gonna be blackmailed, Tom.

1085
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:53,250
<i>- You don't have much choice here, Steve.</i>

1086
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:56,279
If I tell her about Thompson..

1087
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,072
I'm gonna have to tell her that,
he's endorsing you.

1088
00:54:58,073 --> 00:54:59,073
<i>- Well, then tell her.</i>

1089
00:54:59,074 --> 00:55:01,416
<i>I can handle it from my side,
if I start getting calls.</i>

1090
00:55:01,451 --> 00:55:03,099
No fucking way!

1091
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,459
Paul told her we had Thompson in the bag,
It's gonna make him look like a fucking fool!

1092
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:07,460
<i>- He's gonna look like a fucking fool, anyway. </i>

1093
00:55:07,461 --> 00:55:09,690
<i>When Thompson endorses us.</i>

1094
00:55:16,953 --> 00:55:17,877
I can't do it.

1095
00:55:17,878 --> 00:55:21,071
<i>- You know,
you're on a sinking ship, Steve.</i>

1096
00:55:21,072 --> 00:55:22,072
<i>Tell her what she wants to know.</i>

1097
00:55:22,073 --> 00:55:23,073
<i>And jump.</i>

1098
00:55:23,074 --> 00:55:24,074
<i>Come over to our side.</i>

1099
00:55:24,075 --> 00:55:25,075
<i>We can control this thing,</i>

1100
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:28,630
<i> Steve.
- I gotta go.</i>

1101
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:03,240
It's almost, eighteen hundred bucks.

1102
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:05,480
You gotta make the appoinment now.

1103
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:06,840
Like, today.

1104
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:08,560
From a pay-phone.

1105
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,385
I'll take you to the clinic,
and I'll pick you up.

1106
00:56:11,386 --> 00:56:12,386
But, no one else.

1107
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,660
Do you understand?

1108
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:14,661
- Yeah.

1109
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,090
Take the rest of the money
and buy yourself a ticket home.

1110
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:22,740
You can't be here, anymore.
We can't afford it.

1111
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:25,230
Not with anything,
that's gonna happen next week.

1112
00:56:28,096 --> 00:56:30,024
And the situation,
just can't be here.

1113
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:34,290
- You mean,
I can't be here?

1114
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:35,650
Right.

1115
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:39,200
- Steven, I wouldn't tell anyone.

1116
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:42,470
I hope not.

1117
00:56:43,881 --> 00:56:44,942
- Then, Why?

1118
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:47,150
Because, you fucked up.

1119
00:56:48,847 --> 00:56:50,073
- You and I both fucked up.

1120
00:56:50,108 --> 00:56:50,800
That's true.

1121
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:53,980
But, I have a responsibily to him.
And more importantly,

1122
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:55,570
I have a responsibilty to this campaign.

1123
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:58,640
- I can go to North Carolina
and work on the campaign.

1124
00:56:58,675 --> 00:57:00,133
Molly, you gotta wake the fuck up!

1125
00:57:00,134 --> 00:57:01,134
This is the big leagues.

1126
00:57:01,135 --> 00:57:02,135
It's mean.

1127
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,780
When you make a mistake,
you loose the right to play.

1128
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:08,510
Make the appoinment.

1129
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:10,200
Tell me, when and where
we have to go.

1130
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:16,064
Listen to this...

1131
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:17,820
I got the placement in The Times,

1132
00:57:17,821 --> 00:57:18,821
Bumped to like 600 fucking articles..

1133
00:57:18,822 --> 00:57:20,961
Tom Duffy, 2008.

1134
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,961
<i>' This is a match up between,
Hope Versus Fear.</i>

1135
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,700
<i>Nine times out of ten,
the feared candidate have to be the most experienced.</i>

1136
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,561
<i>'But in our presidential races,
the least experienced candidates..</i>

1137
00:57:30,562 --> 00:57:31,562
<i>almost always wins.'</i>

1138
00:57:31,563 --> 00:57:32,563
<i>JFK v/s Nixon.</i>

1139
00:57:32,564 --> 00:57:33,564
<i>Carter v/s Ford</i>

1140
00:57:33,565 --> 00:57:34,565
<i>Bush v/s Gore</i>

1141
00:57:34,566 --> 00:57:37,905
<i>I like our chances
with the new kid on the block'.</i>

1142
00:57:38,969 --> 00:57:40,005
- Thomas fucking Duffy.

1143
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,770
He's gotta be having a stroke right now.

1144
00:59:18,219 --> 00:59:19,396
I hate this shit.

1145
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:24,197
I'm gonna come back
and this is all gonna be over.

1146
00:59:25,551 --> 00:59:26,610
- Yeah?

1147
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,950
We gotta take a broader stroke here.

1148
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:50,980
Re-think everything.

1149
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,210
Yeah, I know how to handle it.

1150
00:59:58,190 --> 00:59:59,944
Look, Stevie just got here.

1151
00:59:59,945 --> 01:00:00,945
Can I call you back,
in a few minutes?

1152
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:03,895
Okay, Bye.

1153
01:00:03,896 --> 01:00:04,896
The governor...

1154
01:00:04,897 --> 01:00:05,897
we had a good long talk
on the way back.

1155
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,010
He's upto speed with everything.

1156
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:11,200
How did he take it?

1157
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,710
- Better than i thought he would.

1158
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,630
Still won't take Thompson's endorsement.

1159
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:22,285
Paul, I gotta tell you something,
I don't know how to tell you.

1160
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:23,286
- Huh..what's up?

1161
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:27,862
Ida knows that I met with Duffy.

1162
01:00:34,177 --> 01:00:36,215
I don't know, How she knows.
But, she knows.

1163
01:00:37,947 --> 01:00:39,434
She tried, to blackmaile me.

1164
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,582
She said, she's gonna release the story,
Unless I tell her all the details,

1165
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:49,432
about your meeting with
Thompson.

1166
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:54,300
So, it's going to end at the papers?

1167
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:57,446
- Probably.

1168
01:00:58,810 --> 01:01:02,061
And whoever she takes it to,
is gonna call me and ask for statement.

1169
01:01:02,062 --> 01:01:04,356
If I deny the whole thing all together,

1170
01:01:04,357 --> 01:01:06,592
but Duffy admits to it.
It's gonna look even worse,

1171
01:01:06,593 --> 01:01:07,593
And if I just...

1172
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,340
say..No Comment.
They're not gonna let up.

1173
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:14,300
I..leaked it to Ida.

1174
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:23,230
At the event.

1175
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:28,710
- I don't understand.

1176
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:30,250
We made a deal.

1177
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,460
Paul, they are gonna...

1178
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:40,650
they are gonna print that story
in the paper, tomorrow morning.

1179
01:01:40,651 --> 01:01:41,651
I know.

1180
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:45,010
So, why'd you do it?

1181
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,170
Why would you do that to the campaign?

1182
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,360
The campaign will survive.

1183
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:54,870
- Why would you do that to me?

1184
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:56,940
Makes easier to let you go.

1185
01:01:58,690 --> 01:01:59,590
- What?

1186
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,330
Why did you meet with Duffy?

1187
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:08,460
- I made a Mistake.

1188
01:02:08,461 --> 01:02:09,461
I made a stupid...

1189
01:02:09,462 --> 01:02:10,462
No.

1190
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:11,610
...Mistake!

1191
01:02:11,611 --> 01:02:13,915
No, Steven. You didn't make a mistake.
You made a choice!

1192
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:17,872
You called me and left a message
to call you back. That it was important.

1193
01:02:17,873 --> 01:02:19,854
And when I did...
you told me to forget about it.

1194
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:21,779
You choose not to tell me.

1195
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,780
Why did you made that choice?

1196
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,807
- Because, Paul...
I didn't think it was important.

1197
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:26,808
Oh, Fuck Yes!
You did.

1198
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,770
But, you won't...
B'cos you're curious.

1199
01:02:30,771 --> 01:02:31,771
Because you felt flattered, special.

1200
01:02:31,772 --> 01:02:32,772
Because...

1201
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:33,880
you felt, special!

1202
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:37,660
To think that, Duffy wants to speak to you,
Instead of me.

1203
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:42,140
Because, you thought to yourself..
Maybe, I can get something out of this.

1204
01:02:42,141 --> 01:02:44,390
Because..b'cos it made you feel 'Big'?

1205
01:02:49,289 --> 01:02:49,854
You know...

1206
01:02:49,889 --> 01:02:52,370
The first campaign I ran,
was a tiny little race in Kentucky.

1207
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:56,050
Uh, state senate seat..you know,
working for some red-neck nobody named..

1208
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,940
Sam McGuffry.

1209
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,040
No staff. No money.
No fucking office.

1210
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:04,010
Everyone thought,
we didn't stand a chance.

1211
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,910
No way, we can compete, right?

1212
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,320
And about this time..This guy,

1213
01:03:08,321 --> 01:03:11,700
running this congressional campaign,
a few district over..gives me a call.

1214
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:14,500
And he says, "I really liked
what you're able to do for poor old Sam."

1215
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:18,340
"But, let's face it. He's goner.
Why don't you come and work for me"?

1216
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:20,370
What did I do?

1217
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:22,290
Well, Steven...

1218
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,281
This is where,
You and I are different.

1219
01:03:24,282 --> 01:03:25,927
I told Sam, about the call.

1220
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:27,720
And Sam says to me..." Paul,

1221
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:30,766
If you think this,
other guys got a chance of winning..

1222
01:03:30,767 --> 01:03:32,560
and if he can pay you
more than any I can afford..

1223
01:03:32,561 --> 01:03:33,561
and if it's what you feel..

1224
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:36,424
You need to do.
Then, I won't get in your way."

1225
01:03:36,425 --> 01:03:37,425
And I say,
"Sam, you took a chance on me,

1226
01:03:37,426 --> 01:03:38,426
and hired me when I was even
more of a nobody than you are".

1227
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:45,810
So, i'll be damned..
If i was gonna jump ship.

1228
01:03:45,811 --> 01:03:46,811
Just because, the shit hits the fan.

1229
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:50,764
We lost that race.

1230
01:03:50,765 --> 01:03:53,140
But three years later,
When Sam decided to run for Governor..

1231
01:03:53,141 --> 01:03:54,141
Who do you think, he called?

1232
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:57,628
We won that race,
and 20 years later..I'm where I am.

1233
01:03:57,629 --> 01:03:58,629
Fucking now!

1234
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:02,319
There's only one thing
I value in this world, Steven.

1235
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:03,320
That's loyalty.

1236
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:04,310
And without it,
You're nothing!

1237
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:06,920
And you have no one.

1238
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:09,880
And in politics?

1239
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:11,960
in fucking politics,

1240
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:14,290
It's the only currency
you can count on.

1241
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:17,540
That's why I'm letting you go.

1242
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:20,085
Not because, you're not good enough.

1243
01:04:20,086 --> 01:04:21,086
Not because, I don't like you.

1244
01:04:21,087 --> 01:04:22,087
But, I value trust over skill.

1245
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:24,330
I don't fucking trust you anymore.

1246
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:28,220
- It doesn't matter whether you trust me, Paul.
It matters if what the governor does.

1247
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:30,260
The governor already knows!

1248
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:32,880
And he thinks,
it's the right thing to do.

1249
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:36,650
- He does?

1250
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:38,984
Yeah, and you know what?

1251
01:04:38,985 --> 01:04:39,985
If I were you..

1252
01:04:39,986 --> 01:04:40,986
I'd get a good night sleep.

1253
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:45,323
B'cos, you're gonna get fucking
pounded by call from the press, in the morning.

1254
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:24,570
Ben: Hey, where were you today?

1255
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,140
- Uhm,

1256
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:27,830
i'm not feeling great today, Ben.

1257
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,900
You picked a hell of a day,
to call in sick.

1258
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:35,100
Jesus, it's fucking wild ass there.

1259
01:06:35,101 --> 01:06:36,101
- Why? what happened?

1260
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:38,230
Steven's off the campaign.

1261
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,880
Paul fired him,
some fucking set up about loyalty..

1262
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:45,395
and it looks like, Steven might've been
doubling down with Duffy, on the Pullman campaign..

1263
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:47,174
I was sitting in the room.

1264
01:06:47,175 --> 01:06:50,245
When Paul told Steven that he's fired.
And Steven said, who's gonna take over...

1265
01:06:50,246 --> 01:06:51,246
and Paul said, Me.

1266
01:06:51,247 --> 01:06:52,247
I know.

1267
01:06:52,248 --> 01:06:53,248
I know, I'm like...

1268
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:57,475
easy there soldier. But then, Steven goes apeshit,
Paul's giving him speech about loyalty...

1269
01:06:57,476 --> 01:06:58,476
and, and then, shits on Steven
like i've never seen before.

1270
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:01,370
like humiliating shit.

1271
01:07:01,371 --> 01:07:02,371
- When was this?

1272
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,070
Molly, listen to me.

1273
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:07,080
I'm gonna run the campaign,
under Paul.

1274
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:10,900
Steven's going to Duffy,
I..I just jumped three years ahead.

1275
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,274
So, starting tomorrow morning..

1276
01:07:14,275 --> 01:07:16,055
we go into full damage control.

1277
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:17,931
And i'm telling you..

1278
01:07:17,932 --> 01:07:18,932
Steven's going apeshit.

1279
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:21,547
He said, he's taking everybody down
his way out.

1280
01:07:21,548 --> 01:07:22,548
Morris...Everybody!

1281
01:07:24,901 --> 01:07:25,829
Shit, I gotta take this.

1282
01:07:25,864 --> 01:07:26,938
Do you need anything?

1283
01:07:26,939 --> 01:07:27,939
No.

1284
01:07:52,812 --> 01:07:54,528
Where's Duffy?
- You got an appointment?

1285
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:08,760
Joe, can we have the room
for a minute?

1286
01:08:08,761 --> 01:08:09,761
Thank you.

1287
01:08:11,779 --> 01:08:12,563
It's not too bright,

1288
01:08:12,598 --> 01:08:14,315
Walking in here like that, Steve.

1289
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:20,250
I am in.

1290
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:23,570
I'm coming to work for you.

1291
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:25,470
A reporter from Roll Call was in here,
this afternoon.

1292
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,770
- Yeah, i know who leaked it.

1293
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:28,771
Who?

1294
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:31,064
Paul.
- You told Paul?

1295
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:32,065
- I told Paul and he leaked it.

1296
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,066
Oh, Steve!

1297
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,243
You shouldn't have told him that.

1298
01:08:36,895 --> 01:08:38,170
I felt like i should.

1299
01:08:38,205 --> 01:08:40,035
I've worked with Paul.
He gets paranoid.

1300
01:08:40,036 --> 01:08:41,036
- Obviously.

1301
01:08:41,037 --> 01:08:42,037
So, he fired you?

1302
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:43,490
- I quit.
- No, you're lying to me.

1303
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:46,236
Come on, man.
- I quit!

1304
01:08:46,237 --> 01:08:47,237
I'm gonna give you everything!

1305
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:50,463
I'm gonna give you his whole strategy,
I'm gonna give you all...

1306
01:08:50,464 --> 01:08:51,464
I don't need his whole strategy.
I already have it.

1307
01:08:51,465 --> 01:08:53,804
Paul gave it all to Thompson.

1308
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:56,000
- What if I had something else?

1309
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,190
You would do that to Morris,
To Paul?

1310
01:08:59,881 --> 01:09:01,188
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

1311
01:09:01,223 --> 01:09:02,430
Revenge makes people unpredictable,

1312
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:05,967
Steve,  I can't have someone
who's unpredictable, who's unstable.

1313
01:09:06,002 --> 01:09:07,800
I'm not unstable.

1314
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:09,784
If you had left Morris,

1315
01:09:09,785 --> 01:09:13,082
before the story broke..
that'd be one thing. That we could control.

1316
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:15,406
But, like this?

1317
01:09:15,441 --> 01:09:17,942
Paul fires you...
and then, you wanna come work for me...

1318
01:09:17,977 --> 01:09:22,166
It makes me look like, I'm picking up the scrapes.
It puts Morris in the driver seat.

1319
01:09:22,167 --> 01:09:23,167
I can't have that.

1320
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:24,670
- What If, I had something big?

1321
01:09:26,155 --> 01:09:26,966
Like, what?

1322
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:31,990
- Something Big.

1323
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:35,020
Something that'll put Morris down.

1324
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:37,880
What is it?

1325
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:41,740
- Give me the job.

1326
01:09:46,816 --> 01:09:48,250
No. That's not gonna happen.

1327
01:09:48,251 --> 01:09:49,251
I'm sorry.

1328
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:52,413
Go take a nice long vacation.

1329
01:09:52,414 --> 01:09:53,414
You're a smart guy.

1330
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:57,273
Everything that I said,
the other day is absolutely true.

1331
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,230
But..you know?

1332
01:09:58,231 --> 01:10:00,886
Maybe, politics isn't for you.

1333
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:02,790
- Politics is my life!

1334
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:04,072
Oh, you know what?

1335
01:10:04,073 --> 01:10:05,073
Do yourself a favour.
Get out..

1336
01:10:05,074 --> 01:10:06,074
Now!

1337
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:06,850
While you still can.

1338
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:10,402
G..go into entertainment or business.

1339
01:10:10,403 --> 01:10:12,579
Go open a fucking restaurant
in Costa Rica.

1340
01:10:12,614 --> 01:10:13,542
Anything!

1341
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:16,303
Do something that's
gonna make you happy..Okay?

1342
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:18,204
Cos if you stay in this business
long enough,

1343
01:10:18,205 --> 01:10:19,205
You're gonna get jaded and cynical.

1344
01:10:19,206 --> 01:10:20,206
- Like you?

1345
01:10:20,207 --> 01:10:22,811
Yeah, just like me!

1346
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:25,660
- You knew I was gonna fucking tell Paul.
Didn't you?

1347
01:10:27,986 --> 01:10:29,021
No, I didn't know.

1348
01:10:29,022 --> 01:10:30,909
I thought, you might.
But, I didn't know.

1349
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:35,329
- You knew I was gonna tell him, you knew..
and you knew that he's gonna fucking fire me.

1350
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:36,487
Well, that's the thing about Paul.

1351
01:10:36,488 --> 01:10:37,488
He's big on loyalty.

1352
01:10:37,489 --> 01:10:40,216
- Yeah, I know.
I just got a big speech on it.

1353
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,280
You were never gonna hire me?

1354
01:10:44,890 --> 01:10:47,602
Put yourself on my shoes, Steve.

1355
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,790
You're opponent has the best
media mind in the country...

1356
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:52,624
Working for his team.

1357
01:10:52,659 --> 01:10:53,340
What are you gonna do?

1358
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:57,820
You're either gonna hire him
for yourself...

1359
01:10:57,821 --> 01:10:58,821
Or you're either gonna work it,
so, you can't have him?

1360
01:10:58,822 --> 01:11:01,079
The other team can't either.

1361
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,680
This is a Win-win situation for me.

1362
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:08,041
And you come work for me, great!

1363
01:11:08,042 --> 01:11:09,042
Paul doesn't have you.

1364
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:10,840
But, then again..

1365
01:11:10,841 --> 01:11:12,715
Paul fires you, 
I don't want you...fine.

1366
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:13,640
Paul still doesn't have you.

1367
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:16,000
Either way, I win.

1368
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:20,226
and the moment,
 I got you sit down on that chair...

1369
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:23,240
I know, I've won.

1370
01:11:23,241 --> 01:11:24,241
- This is...

1371
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,320
It's my life,
that you're talking about.

1372
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:29,660
It doesn't make me happy,
doing this kind of thing.

1373
01:11:29,661 --> 01:11:30,661
Don't think,
it gives me any kind of pleasure.

1374
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:33,420
No, I'm sorry for you.
I really am.

1375
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:40,515
Take care of yourself.

1376
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:47,500
Do you know her?

1377
01:12:53,671 --> 01:12:54,694
She is gone.

1378
01:13:55,499 --> 01:13:56,793
<i>Molly on phone:
Where are you? It's huh...</i>

1379
01:13:56,794 --> 01:14:00,967
<i>It's four something..
they're gonna close up in few minutes.</i>

1380
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:04,325
<i>Steven, it's Ben.</i>

1381
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:06,155
<i>Listen, What the fuck?</i>

1382
01:14:06,156 --> 01:14:08,713
<i>Jesus...what're you gonna do?</i>

1383
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:14,739
<i>Steven, uh..
I just heard from Ben.</i>

1384
01:14:15,792 --> 01:14:17,602
<i>Please...don't do anything fucked up.</i>

1385
01:14:17,603 --> 01:14:19,475
<i>God damn it! 
You motherfucker,</i>

1386
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:20,713
<i>Pick up the phone!</i>

1387
01:14:20,714 --> 01:14:21,714
<i>Don't do this!</i>

1388
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:27,974
<i>I'm not going away.</i>

1389

<i>TV announcer: The coroner stated that,
 based on the evidence found by the police in that Hotel room;</i>

1390
01:14:39,093 --> 01:14:40,093
<i>That this was an accidental overdose.</i>

1391
01:14:40,094 --> 01:14:43,363
<i>A lethal cocktail 
of alcohol and prescription drugs.</i>

1392

 Jake Sterns and his family.</i>

1396
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:22,840
I want on the ticket,

1397
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,631
You need me on that ticket,
and you could use my delegates.

1398
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:31,190
And you need them
before tuesday.

1399
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:34,970
It'll make a fine story,
on the sunday morning news cycle.

1400
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,630
So, I expect to hear from you,
by noon tomorrow.

1401
01:15:39,090 --> 01:15:40,820
Or I endorse Pullman
and take that Cabinet seat.

1402
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:52,408
Anything else,
 you wanna talk about, Steven?

1403
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,016
The entire staff is...

1404
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:11,550
in the state of shock.

1405
01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:17,446
We send our condolences
to Jack and Joanna Sterns and their entire family.

1406
01:16:17,481 --> 01:16:18,280
Of course, our hearts go out to them.

1407
01:16:20,027 --> 01:16:21,952
It's hard to imagine,
what they must be going through.

1408
01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:25,890
What we know right now is that,
it appears to have been.. 

1409
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,430
a drug..an accidental

1410
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,410
 prescription overdose.

1411
01:16:32,606 --> 01:16:33,725
<i>Reporter: Is suicide ruled out?</i>

1412
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:34,640
We have no reason to believe...

1413
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:38,014
I don't think we have any 
information on that yet.

1414
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:40,087
Obviously, there'll be a full investigation.

1415
01:16:40,122 --> 01:16:42,500
We just wanted to say that,
our hearts go out...

1416
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:44,200
Our prayers go out...

1417
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:46,120
to the entire family.

1418
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:49,376
She really is...
she was part of our family.

1419
01:16:50,919 --> 01:16:52,094
<i>Did you know her well, Governor?</i>

1420
01:16:52,129 --> 01:16:54,010
Not well..
But I did know her.

1421
01:16:54,011 --> 01:16:56,539
What I saw was a 
hard working young woman with a..

1422
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,090
great spirit.

1423
01:16:59,770 --> 01:17:03,269
It's just a sad day,
for the campaign.

1424
01:17:03,304 --> 01:17:05,617
And it's a sad day 
for those of us who knows Jack.

1425
01:17:05,618 --> 01:17:08,609
<i>- Governor,
 how long has she interned for you?</i>

1426
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:16,560
She'd only been on the road
with us for a few weeks.

1427
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:19,605
Maybe, four weeks..I think.

1428
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:20,962
I can check.

1429
01:17:20,963 --> 01:17:23,519
<i>- Will you be continuing 
with your schedule today?</i>

1430
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:57,655
Seems like you have something
you wanna talk to me about.

1431
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,458
- Does it seem that way?

1432
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:08,910
You have something,
you think you have something..

1433
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:11,245
you wanna get off your chest.
Why don't you?

1434
01:19:11,530 --> 01:19:14,619
- How about, I do the talking.
And you do the listening?

1435
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:17,660
Okay.

1436
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:22,414
- As of tomorrow, there's gonna
 be a few changes to your campaign.

1437
01:19:22,449 --> 01:19:23,320
Paul is out.

1438
01:19:24,612 --> 01:19:26,413
I am your Senior Campaign Manager.

1439
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:28,350
I'll draft the statement..

1440
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,444
The campaign got to a point
that we need to make some changes.

1441
01:19:32,479 --> 01:19:34,187
You can put your own words in there.

1442
01:19:34,188 --> 01:19:35,188
Why would I do that?

1443
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:36,840
- Because, you wanna win.

1444
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:41,637
Because, you broke the only rule
in politics.

1445
01:19:41,672 --> 01:19:43,419
You wanna be President...

1446
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:44,420
You can start a war...

1447
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:45,950
You can lie,
You can cheat...

1448
01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:48,034
You can bankrupt the country...

1449
01:19:48,035 --> 01:19:50,446
but you can't fuck the interns.

1450
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:52,870
They'll get you for that.

1451
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:57,490
What do you think you have, Steven?

1452
01:19:58,830 --> 01:20:00,712
A troubled young girl,
tells you a story...?

1453
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:02,517
- A troubled young  pregnant girl...

1454
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:03,683
Is that what she told you?

1455
01:20:03,684 --> 01:20:05,601
- ...who needed cash for an abortion!

1456
01:20:05,602 --> 01:20:06,602
What did you do?
You gave her money?

1457
01:20:07,190 --> 01:20:09,430
Maybe, she just needed cash.
And you're the perfect guy to hit up.

1458
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:12,065
- Is that your best play?

1459
01:20:12,066 --> 01:20:13,832
You need a job, that bad Steven?

1460
01:20:13,833 --> 01:20:15,589
You coming here,
with your dick in your hand...

1461
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:16,590
You got nothing!

1462
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:17,650
- Then, how did I get in here?

1463
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:21,432
You're right Mike.
There's nothing...

1464
01:20:21,433 --> 01:20:22,433
there's no voice messages..

1465
01:20:22,434 --> 01:20:24,388
no text..no e-mails...

1466
01:20:24,389 --> 01:20:26,637
no pictures and no tape.
And yet...

1467
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,010
I'm standing right here.

1468
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:29,960
Well, go home.

1469
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,740
She left a note.

1470
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:42,750
How would you know that?

1471
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:44,690
- I was cleaning up your mess.

1472
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,360
I took her phone,
and I found a note.

1473
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,130
I thought it was an accident.

1474
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:52,006
- I don't know, Mike.

1475
01:20:52,007 --> 01:20:53,007
You're gonna have to tell me..

1476
01:20:53,008 --> 01:20:55,057
You're the last person she called.

1477
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,414
Note says, she is pregnant.

1478
01:20:58,415 --> 01:20:59,415
Got an abortion...

1479
01:20:59,416 --> 01:21:01,538
and doesn't wanna hurt you.

1480
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:05,541
Then why would she leave
a note, that can only do that?

1481
01:21:05,576 --> 01:21:06,530
- She's twenty.

1482
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:11,336
What do you want?

1483
01:21:11,337 --> 01:21:14,244
- Paul's gone...today.

1484
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:18,119
I set a meeting with You and Thompson,
and you promise him the ticket.

1485
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:20,429
You get 356 pledged delegates...

1486
01:21:20,430 --> 01:21:23,050
You get North Carolina..
You take office...

1487
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:25,640
You make right with so many people
that you've made wrong.

1488
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:27,790
All the things that we both believe in.

1489
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:32,007
I don't believe in extortion..
I don't believe in tying myself to you...

1490
01:21:32,008 --> 01:21:33,008
for the next eight years!

1491
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,520
- Four years.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

1492
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:44,980
What were you doing in her room?

1493
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:47,510
- House keeping,
before you make page one.

1494
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:49,721
No, you were fired,
You were out. 

1495
01:21:49,722 --> 01:21:50,722
What were you doing in her room?

1496
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:52,700
- I was fixing the situation.

1497
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:56,789
I got a call,  someone
 from the hotel thought I could help...

1498
01:21:56,790 --> 01:21:57,575
and they called me.

1499
01:21:57,576 --> 01:21:58,576
So, you're off the campaign,

1500
01:21:58,577 --> 01:21:59,577
But you thought it was important..

1501
01:21:59,578 --> 01:22:02,600
...to fix things!

1502
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:09,957
It was your voice,
the other night on the phone.

1503
01:22:11,997 --> 01:22:13,190
You were fucking her.

1504
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:15,040
What did you do, Steven?

1505
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:20,560
- I lend her some money
and I gave her a ride.

1506
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:21,561
I bet you did.

1507
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:25,160
There's no note.

1508
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:28,320
- Okay, Mike.
There's no note.

1509
01:22:28,321 --> 01:22:29,321
Show it to me.

1510
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:30,350
- You think I brought it here?

1511
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:32,800
That's how people get hurt.

1512
01:22:41,916 --> 01:22:42,599
Okay.

1513
01:22:42,634 --> 01:22:43,989
Let's play this out.

1514
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:49,196
You're not wearing a wire,
because everything you've suggested is illegal.

1515
01:22:49,231 --> 01:22:51,607
And you wouldn't fare
too well, in federal prison.

1516
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:54,850
You were fucking her
and she told you about her situation.

1517
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:58,947
There are no records or
conversation between the two of us.

1518
01:22:58,948 --> 01:22:59,948
And since, she's had abortion...

1519
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:01,490
There's no DNA evidence.

1520
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:04,350
So, there's no note.

1521
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:07,590
It's word against mine.

1522
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:11,250
Your word.

1523
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:15,270
A fired, disgruntled employee..

1524
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:17,720
or a sitting governor.

1525
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:24,310
There's no note.

1526
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:31,136
- It's your call, Governor.

1527
01:24:22,978 --> 01:24:24,167
Paul, you got a minute?
- Yeah.

1528
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:24,597
<i>TV Reporter: 
How much could a shake up like this..</i>

1529
01:25:24,598 --> 01:25:28,066
<i>days before the Ohio primary,
Hurt a campaign?</i>

1530
01:25:28,067 --> 01:25:31,114
<i>I asked Paul Zara, How his
 firing could actually help the candidate?</i>

1531
01:25:31,115 --> 01:25:35,221
- The governor and I both,
felt that in light of this changing numbers,

1532
01:25:35,222 --> 01:25:37,506
that it was best to put a new face
on the campaign..

1533
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:38,507
Steven is very talented.

1534
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:41,407
Very smart.

1535
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:56,751
You always hear people talk about,

1536
01:25:57,630 --> 01:26:00,179
Events out of sequence...

1537
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:01,180
the order of things.

1538
01:26:07,290 --> 01:26:13,735
There's no greater grief,
than a parent laying a child during this.

1539
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:19,090
She was a little girl...

1540
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:21,590
trying to make it in a very grown up world.

1541
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,390
A world where,
every mistake is magnified.

1542
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:27,590
And she was smart and pretty..

1543
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:29,770
and so, so young.

1544
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,075
Father, you asked us
to accept God's plan..

1545
01:26:38,076 --> 01:26:39,076
and to not question his judgement.

1546
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:41,840
With all due respect,

1547
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,100
I don't accept to this judgement.

1548
01:26:45,730 --> 01:26:46,910
She made the world better!

1549
01:26:50,962 --> 01:26:51,942
Not just for me.

1550
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,100
But for everyone she touched.

1551
01:27:09,790 --> 01:27:11,070
You should hire Jack
for a speech writer.

1552
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:13,950
- I'll keep it in mind.

1553
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:18,090
You come here to see me?

1554
01:27:18,850 --> 01:27:19,920
No, friends of the family.

1555
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:23,050
I got her the internship.

1556
01:27:25,592 --> 01:27:27,007
I've known her since
she was born.

1557
01:27:28,902 --> 01:27:30,004
- Sorry.

1558
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:34,380
The governor couldn't make the flight?

1559
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:36,830
- He's meeting with Thompson.

1560
01:27:39,365 --> 01:27:40,236
Look at you.

1561
01:27:40,850 --> 01:27:42,160
All grown up with
tits and all.

1562
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:46,650
- I learned from the best.

1563
01:27:51,010 --> 01:27:52,200
Well, one day we'll grab a beer and...

1564
01:27:54,230 --> 01:27:55,840
you could tell me, what you had
 on the governor that put me out.

1565
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:59,060
- How do you know
 I didn't have something on you?

1566
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,569
You better get going..

1567
01:28:08,570 --> 01:28:11,231
You have a campaign to run
and I've got offices to look at.

1568
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:12,670
- North?

1569
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:16,600
Nice consulting firm,
out of K street.

1570
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:19,530
A million a year.

1571
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:22,140
No one to fuck you over.

1572
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,470
- Sounds relaxing.

1573
01:28:25,471 --> 01:28:26,471
Doesn't it?

1574
01:28:31,870 --> 01:28:35,750
<i>Thompson: The right man to lead 
this nation of ours.</i>

1575
01:28:35,751 --> 01:28:36,751
<i>In this chanllenging times...</i>

1576
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:37,920
<i>and..</i>

1577
01:28:38,370 --> 01:28:39,690
<i>and the next President..</i>

1578
01:28:40,170 --> 01:28:42,669
of The United States of America...

1579
01:28:42,670 --> 01:28:45,169
Governor Mike Morris!

1580
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:54,930
<i>And let me ask,
one very important thing.</i>

1581
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,335
<i>That all of us stand,
shoulder to shoulder...</i>

1582
01:28:58,336 --> 01:29:01,646
<i>arm and arm,
in a united democrat party...</i>

1583
01:29:04,330 --> 01:29:07,663
<i>So, I strongly urge 
the three hundred and fifty six</i>

1584
01:29:07,698 --> 01:29:10,190
<i>loyal delegates that I've
carried as a badge of honour...</i>

1585
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:15,022
<i>Throw their support to the governor,
lets put this primary behind us...</i>

1586
01:29:15,023 --> 01:29:18,456
<i>And get on with the business
of sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue!</i>

1587
01:29:19,046 --> 01:29:22,465
<i>Thank you, God bless you..
and God Bless The United States of America!</i>

1588
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:36,740
Thank you.

1589
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:40,580
Well, the polls aren't quite closed.

1590
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:44,870
But I do wanna congratulate
Senator Pullman and his republican constituents,

1591
01:29:45,370 --> 01:29:47,869
on their win here in Ohio.

1592
01:29:54,804 --> 01:29:57,482
Senator Thompson,
I'm honoured to stand with you here today.

1593
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:00,774
And I'm humbled
by your kind words.

1594
01:30:00,775 --> 01:30:01,775
Thank you.

1595
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:06,049
Ladies and Gentlement, today
marks the begining of the fight between...

1596
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:07,050
Two sets of ideals.

1597
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,656
Either we're gonna move forward or
we're going to live in the past?

1598
01:30:13,237 --> 01:30:17,054
Either we're going to lead the world
again on technology or we are going to bury,

1599
01:30:17,055 --> 01:30:18,055
our heads in the sands?

1600
01:30:20,476 --> 01:30:23,170
The sands of Saudi Arabia.
The sands of Iraq?

1601
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,819
Either we are going to let 
Greed and corruption

1602
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:31,210
ruin our industries and our shorelines..

1603
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:34,169
or we are going 
to take back our country?

1604
01:30:36,607 --> 01:30:39,366
We are not a nation
used to come in second...

1605
01:30:39,401 --> 01:30:41,399
or third???

1606
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:08,190
Hey, Ben?

1607
01:31:10,050 --> 01:31:13,366
I was told to talk to you,
I'm suppose to get a phone.

1608
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:14,991
And you are?

1609
01:31:14,992 --> 01:31:15,992
- Joe Morris.

1610
01:31:15,993 --> 01:31:16,993
No relation.

1611
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,000
You're a Beercat Joe Morris?

1612
01:31:20,001 --> 01:31:23,604
- No, i'm from Columbus,
I'm a Buckeye.

1613
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:40,850
You're making me look bad.

1614
01:31:40,851 --> 01:31:41,851
- How so?

1615
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:45,249
I filed the story that said you're
 off the campaign..

1616
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:46,250
And Thompson is going to Pullman.

1617
01:31:47,790 --> 01:31:49,260
You can't believe 
everything you read.

1618
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:53,480
I just wanna give you 
an opportunity to comment on my next story.

1619
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:55,736
Says you delivered Thompson.

1620
01:31:55,737 --> 01:31:57,746
You got that 356 delegates,

1621
01:31:57,747 --> 01:32:01,109
you delivered the nomination.
And all you ask in return is Paul's job.

1622
01:32:01,110 --> 01:32:03,009
Any chance of you confirming now?
- No press behind this point.

1623
01:32:03,010 --> 01:32:04,010
She's press.

1624
01:32:04,011 --> 01:32:05,011
I'll read about it
in the funny papers.

1625
01:32:05,012 --> 01:32:07,312
Come on, Steven?

1626
01:32:07,313 --> 01:32:09,879
Aren't we friends anymore?

1627
01:32:12,679 --> 01:32:14,252
You are my best friend, Ida.

1628
01:34:38,174 --> 01:34:42,562
