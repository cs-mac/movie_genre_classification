1
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,953
<i>Everybody seems to be ready.</i>
<i>Are you ready?</i>

2
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,755
<i>For the first time</i>
<i>in three years,</i>

3
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:33,458
<i>the greatest rock 'n'roll band</i>
<i>in the world, the Rolling Stones!</i>

4
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:37,435
<i>The Rolling Stones!</i>

5
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,802
<i>We're gonna have a look at you.</i>

6
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,741
<i>We're gonna see</i>
<i>how beautiful you are.</i>

7
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,301
<i>Whoo! All right!</i>

8
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,948
<i>Oh, New York City, you talk a lot.</i>

9
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:55,419
<i>Let's have a look at you.</i>

10
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,523
<i>Let's have a look at New York City.</i>

11
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,189
Whoo!

12
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,494
Well, all right!

13
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:16,169
Welcome to the breakfast show.

14
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,095
Whoo!

15
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,132
Yeah!

16
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,540
Thank you. Whoo!
Thank you.

17
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,377
We're just gonna wake up.

18
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:56,852
Well, all right!

19
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:00,194
<i>Charlie's good tonight,</i>
<i>isn't he?</i>

20
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:04,498
<i>I think you really...</i>
<i>you really dressed up tonight.</i>

21
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,539
<i>Aren't they?</i>
<i>We'd like to see how you look.</i>

22
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:11,043
<i>Can we see how they look?</i>

23
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,415
<i>Let's have a look how they look.</i>

24
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,508
<i>Come on.</i>

25
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,620
<i>Oh, wejust want</i>
<i>to see how they look.</i>

26
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:28,218
<i>Ohhh, we couldn't see you!</i>

27
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,859
We couldn't see you.

28
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:39,168
It's really hard
to see this together, isn't it?

29
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,172
<i>It will take time.</i>

30
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,208
- What?
<i>- Eight weeks.</i>

31
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,506
Eight weeks.
Eight weeks.

32
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,944
Do you think you can
do it that quick?

33
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,882
This gives us the freedom.
All you guys watching us.

34
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,579
We may only be on you
for a minute,

35
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,849
then go to almost anything.

36
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,492
This is Stefan Ponek,
KSAN Radio, San Francisco.

37
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,430
Well, the Rolling Stones' tour
of the United States is over.

38
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:11,198
<i>They wound it up with a free</i>
<i>concert at the Altamont Speedway</i>
<i>for more than 300,000 people.</i>

39
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,229
<i>There were four births, four deaths</i>
<i>and an awful lot of scuffles reported.</i>

40
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,334
<i>We received word that someone</i>
<i>was stabbed to death...</i>

41
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,209
in front of the stage
by a member of the Hell's Angels.

42
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,339
<i>Nothing's confirmed on that.</i>
<i>We were there.</i>

43
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,646
<i>We didn't see it,</i>
<i>but we did see a lot.</i>

44
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,482
<i>We want to know what you saw.</i>
<i>Our phones are open.</i>

45
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:32,320
<i>We'd like to hear from you. What</i>
<i>was the Altamont free concert like?</i>

46
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:37,227
<i>The Angels did as they saw</i>
<i>best in the difficult situation.</i>

47
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,993
<i>As far as I'm concerned,</i>
<i>they were people who were here...</i>

48
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,297
<i>who tried to help</i>
<i>in their own way.</i>

49
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:46,338
<i>- Right? You know?</i>
<i>- Hmm. Right.</i>

50
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,704
<i>If people didn't dig it,</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

51
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:53,144
<i>That was Sam Cutler, one of</i>
<i>the organizers of the free concert.</i>

52
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:56,909
<i>I think we've got one of</i>
<i>the Hell's Angels on the line.</i>

53
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,679
<i>Sonny Barger.</i>
<i>Have I got that right, Sonny?</i>

54
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,982
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Okay, what's up?</i>

55
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,614
<i>I didn't go there</i>
<i>to police nothing, man.</i>

56
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,421
<i>I ain't no cop. I ain't never</i>
<i>gonna pretend to be a cop.</i>

57
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,258
<i>And this Mick Jagger, like...</i>

58
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,560
<i>Put it all on the Angels, man.</i>

59
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,067
<i>Like, he used us for dupes, man.</i>

60
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:20,333
<i>And as far as I'm concerned,</i>
<i>we were the biggest suckers for</i>
<i>that idiot that I can ever see.</i>

61
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,601
<i>And you know what?</i>
<i>They told me...</i>

62
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,905
<i>if I could sit</i>
<i>on the edge of the stage...</i>

63
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,377
<i>so nobody would climb</i>
<i>over me, you know,</i>

64
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,813
<i>I could drink beer</i>
<i>until the show was over.</i>

65
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,578
<i>That's what I went there to do.</i>
<i>But you know what?</i>

66
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:36,088
<i>When they started messing over</i>
<i>our bikes, they started it.</i>

67
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,350
<i>I don't know if you think</i>
<i>we pay $50 for them things...</i>

68
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:42,019
<i>or steal them</i>
<i>or pay a lot for them or what.</i>

69
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,858
<i>Ain't nobody</i>
<i>gonna kick my motorcycle.</i>

70
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:48,765
<i>And they might think because they're</i>
<i>in a crowd of 300,000 people...</i>

71
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,269
<i>that they can do it</i>
<i>and get away with it.</i>

72
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:54,602
<i>But when you're standing there,</i>
<i>looking at something that's your life,</i>

73
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:57,507
<i>and everything you've got</i>
<i>is invested in that thing,</i>

74
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,512
<i>and you love that thing better</i>
<i>than anything in the world,</i>

75
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,276
<i>and you see a guy kick it,</i>
<i>you know who he is.</i>

76
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:07,080
<i>You're gonna get him.</i>
<i>And you know what? They got got.</i>

77
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,122
<i>I am not no peace creep</i>
<i>by any sense of the word.</i>

78
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:13,124
<i>And you can call them people</i>
<i>flower children and this and that.</i>

79
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,752
<i>Some of them people</i>
<i>was loaded on some drugs...</i>

80
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,854
<i>that it's just too bad</i>
<i>we wasn't loaded on...</i>

81
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:22,867
<i>because they come running up the hill,</i>
<i>yelling, "Aaaah," and jump on somebody.</i>

82
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:25,665
<i>And it wasn't even always</i>
<i>jumping on Angels.</i>

83
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,571
<i>But when they jumped</i>
<i>on an Angel, they got hurt.</i>

84
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,045
Well done, Sonny.

85
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,485
I think I remember him.
Do you?

86
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,287
<i>No, I'm not certain.</i>

87
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,057
<i>I don't really remember</i>
<i>what he looked like.</i>

88
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,028
There was a couple of them
before we went on.

89
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:04,509
They were really very nice,
you know? A couple of them guys.

90
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:08,775
It's just, uh...

91
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,782
I don't know.

92
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:19,290
I mean, the way they cleared the path,
for instance, was incredible.

93
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:23,954
Were you there? Was you in the party
that had to be led to the stage?

94
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,363
- My goodness.
<i>- I saw what they did, yeah.</i>

95
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:30,163
That was insane.

96
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,329
<i>What did they do?</i>

97
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,073
Well, it's just the way
they did it, you know?

98
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:39,339
It's very, very...

99
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:44,349
'Cause before that,
I didn't really think there
was anything going on, you know?

100
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,786
Really. I didn't hear anything
'cause we were right at the side.

101
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,353
Oh, dear, what a shame!

102
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:58,830
<i>KSAN Radio here. The violence at</i>
<i>Altamont was completely unexpected.</i>

103
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,628
The Rolling Stones had performed
for overflow audiences...

104
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:05,068
<i>without incident in major cities</i>
<i>across the United States.</i>

105
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,704
Okay, roll it.

106
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:09,166
Whoo! Yeah!

107
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:30,050
Thank you.
Well, all right.

108
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:38,332
Well, all right!
Well, all right!

109
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,641
Well, all right!

110
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,234
Whoo!

111
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:49,577
Are you any more satisfied
as far as your career goes?

112
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,481
Do you mean sexually
or, or philosophically?

113
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:59,820
- <i>Both.</i>
- Yeah, we're more satisfied now sexually, aren't...

114
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,896
<i>How about philosophically</i>
<i>and financially?</i>

115
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,764
Financially dissatisfied,
uh, you know.

116
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:12,497
Uh, sexually satisfied,
philosophically trying.

117
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,540
- Rubbish.
- There's a question here on the right.

118
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:18,576
I read in one of the
papers that you'll be giving...

119
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,579
<i>a free concert in San Francisco.</i>

120
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,911
We are doing a free concert
in San Francisco.

121
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,076
<i>- When?</i>
- On December 6.

122
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:30,281
And, uh, the location is not
Golden Gate Park, unfortunately,

123
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,348
but it's somewhere adjacent
to it which is a bit larger.

124
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:38,590
<i>It's creating sort of</i>
<i>a microcosmic society, you know,</i>

125
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,428
<i>which sets the example</i>
<i>to the rest of A merica...</i>

126
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,594
as to how one can behave
in large gatherings.

127
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,798
This is Mel Belli,
the lawyer in San Francisco.

128
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:52,037
Uh, I'm-I'm talking
for the Rolling Stones.

129
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,842
We've got their managers
and their principals here.

130
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:59,941
I've just heard that you've
offered them your speedway...

131
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,580
for their performance
on Saturday, is that right?

132
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,818
- That is correct.
- This is an open phone so we can all talk on it.

133
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:11,989
What I'm trying to find out
is what we can do to do this concert.

134
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,625
<i>For the last 36 hours, I've stood</i>
<i>my organization on its ear, Mr. Belli.</i>

135
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:20,161
I don't know anything about this.
I'm coming in late and trying
to straighten something out.

136
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,730
So tell me exactly
what it is without...

137
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:27,507
<i>Yeah. My first area</i>
<i>of policy concern:</i>

138
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,379
<i>I do not want this gesture...</i>

139
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,715
<i>on the part of Mr. Jagger...</i>

140
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,950
<i>to cost me five cents.</i>

141
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:41,220
<i>If a blade of grass is torn down,</i>

142
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:44,922
<i>they are going</i>
<i>to build it up again, you know?</i>

143
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:48,023
<i>I was involved in Woodstock.</i>

144
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,536
<i>I've represented rock groups,</i>
<i>and I've been involved,</i>

145
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:56,870
<i>both as an attorney and</i>
<i>as an executive, with festivals.</i>

146
00:17:56,942 --> 00:18:00,309
<i>No matter what anybody tells</i>
<i>you, they're a pain in the ass.</i>

147
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,813
<i>Don't turn me into a proctologist.</i>

148
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,349
<i>Just tell me what I can do here.</i>

149
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,353
<i>Well, somebody tell me why I should</i>
<i>want to get this concert going.</i>

150
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,356
<i>Are you trying to make it</i>
<i>so they can't do this?</i>

151
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:17,225
<i>No, I want it to happen,</i>
<i>but I'm not prepared to rebuild</i>
<i>my goddamn racetrack.</i>

152
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:20,697
Will you come up and see
if you can work with me on this thing?

153
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,532
I'd love to work with you, Mr. Belli,
but are you working with Mr. Jagger?

154
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,401
I haven't met Mr. Jagger.
I've only met these other people here.

155
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:31,239
<i>- Have you met Mr. Schneider?</i>
<i>- Yes, he's right here in the office.</i>

156
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,643
<i>All right, fine. He knows what</i>
<i>happened at our meeting this afternoon.</i>

157
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,681
<i>Then call me back</i>
<i>and with the thought...</i>

158
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,046
see if you could come up
tomorrow morning.

159
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,554
- You and I can see what we can do with this damn thing.
- Okay.

160
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,555
All right, call me back.

161
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,717
<i>There's no way to do</i>
<i>the concert except in that location.</i>

162
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:51,889
<i>As it stands now, you're gonna have</i>
<i>at least 100,000 kids there by Saturday.</i>

163
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,263
<i>You don't have any alternative.</i>
<i>The only thing you can do...</i>

164
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,997
is to do an affidavit,
temporary restraining order
and talk to one of the judges.

165
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,369
So that brings us down to this.

166
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,069
Um, I'll call one
of the judges right now.

167
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,545
<i>That's your only chance of</i>
<i>forcing these people to do it.</i>

168
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,412
<i>Now, don't scare off from these people.</i>

169
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,543
<i>If I were advising them,</i>
<i>I'd tell them to hide out.</i>

170
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,566
Because right when they're
coming out, you'll... sh-ta-boom!

171
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:13,634
<i>- Yeah, but it doesn't come in till the solo.</i>
- I know, I know.

172
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,141
<i>- What is that?</i>
- What?

173
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,482
<i>- Stickin'out of your pocket.</i>
- Cousin Minnie says,

174
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,181
"How delicious!"

175
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:30,017
I'm taking it home for Robert.

176
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,563
<i>Y'all come back now, ya hear?</i>

177
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,997
<i>That's one more song.</i>

178
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,785
That should be it.
I found it. I found it.

179
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:45,516
Anybody in?
Is my local groupie in?

180
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,687
Hello, darling.
How are you?

181
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,725
When are the bags
coming up, Ronnie?

182
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,927
<i>Stew's gotta get 46 pieces up.</i>

183
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,698
<i>We're gonna do...</i>

184
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:40,829
We're gonna do a slow blues
for you now, people.

185
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:57,461
You like that?
I like it.

186
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:07,938
<i>This thing is going on. The</i> Chronicle
<i>is coming out with a story that it's off.</i>

187
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:11,737
<i>- This has been building up for a long time.</i>
- Well, it's off and on.

188
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,779
<i>Everybody wants a piece of the pie.</i>

189
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:17,610
All right, let's see
if we can get some facts...

190
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:20,446
to build together
on an affidavit here.

191
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:24,579
So we'll have that available and then
a very short order to show cause.

192
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,750
<i>The sheriff wants to know who's going</i>
<i>to go to the bathroom and where.</i>

193
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,920
They've got a nice little
bucolic community there...

194
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,896
They know practically when
every john is flushed...

195
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:38,129
and the orderly habits of the bathroom
of all of their, uh, voters.

196
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,296
<i>Dick Carter's on the line.</i>

197
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,771
<i>He's offering us</i>
<i>the speedway at Altamont.</i>

198
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,833
<i>Hello, Dick.</i>
<i>This is Mel Belli for the Stones.</i>

199
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:49,141
If they were to perform
in the speedway,

200
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:53,241
is the speedway open
so that they can be seen...

201
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:55,809
from the people that can't get in?

202
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,754
<i>I'm sure we can work</i>
<i>something out. I want the publicity.</i>

203
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:02,953
You want the publicity?
Well, you take the publicity.

204
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:06,121
The Rolling Stones don't want any money.
It's for charity.

205
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,461
- So I'll take the money.
<i>- All right.</i>

206
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,899
All right.
Well, why don't I do this?

207
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,529
Why don't I talk
with these people here...

208
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,800
and then I'll get back with you...

209
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,138
and then if we
have to sign anything up...

210
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,303
and if you need any insurance,
which I'm sure you will want,

211
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:25,315
and all the rest of that stuff,
I'll work with you in the morning.

212
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:29,046
<i>- Okay.</i>
- I'll call you back later, after I talk with them, Dick.

213
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,056
<i>Bye. He's offered</i>
<i>the Altamont Speedway.</i>

214
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,592
<i>- There's not enough room.</i>
<i>- There's not time to move it.</i>

215
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,356
<i>We got to tear down</i>
<i>a stage and the scaffolding.</i>

216
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:42,525
The phones are in. The generators
are there. Everything is left to go.

217
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,366
It's anticipated that the amount of kids
now traveling across country...

218
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:49,702
you may have anywhere
from 5,000 to 20,000 kids...

219
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:52,299
starting to arrive sometime tomorrow.

220
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:56,177
<i>They're all lining up at the airports</i>
<i>from as far away as New York.</i>

221
00:31:56,247 --> 00:32:00,308
<i>- Now? You gotta be kidding.</i>
- You have no idea what goes on here.

222
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:03,877
It's an amazing phenomenon.
It's like the lemmings of the sea.

223
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,549
<i>- Mike Lang is on the line.</i>
<i>- Yeah, Mike?</i>

224
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:10,856
<i>John says that he doesn't think</i>
<i>you can make it over there</i>
<i>at the Altamont Speedway.</i>

225
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,363
<i>- Do you want to talk directly to Mike?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

226
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:17,868
<i>Mike, I got the impression</i>
<i>from everybody where you are...</i>

227
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,769
<i>that there was no way</i>
<i>of moving to that speedway.</i>

228
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:24,467
<i>We can do it. Nobody wants to,</i>
<i>but if we have to, we can.</i>

229
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:28,478
Just a quick question.
You were at Woodstock, and
you've now been to Altamont?

230
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:31,481
- Right.
- How does it stack up? Do you have the room?

231
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,882
I think we have the room, sure.
I think we can hold as many
people as want to come.

232
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,387
Can you change locations that fast?

233
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:41,448
We had a much bigger operation to change at Woodstock.
I don't think we'll have much problem.

234
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:45,257
We're just dealing with a free concert.
That's what we want to present.

235
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:49,232
And I think that's what the Stones
are up to. They want to play here.

236
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,495
Is this going to be Woodstock West?

237
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,129
Well, it's going to be San Francisco.

238
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:58,733
<i>Do you have any special feelings</i>
<i>about this kind of a concert?</i>
<i>This spontaneous, free...</i>

239
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,211
Well, it's not so much...
I don't think it's a complete concert.

240
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,215
The concert is just...
I think it's an excuse.

241
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:07,979
You know, because,
like, the thing is,

242
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,919
<i>it's just like everyone coming</i>
<i>and having a good time.</i>

243
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,753
<i>The concert's like</i>
<i>the proscenium of a theater.</i>

244
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,056
It's like an excuse for everyone to just
sort of, you know, get together...

245
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:20,393
and, like, talk to each other
and sleep with each other...

246
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,127
ball each other
and get very stoned...

247
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:26,864
and just have a nice night out
and a good day, you know?

248
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:29,736
- I mean, do you understand?
- I do.

249
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:32,742
It's not just like getting
up there and seeing...

250
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:37,645
the Grateful Airplane
and the Rolling, Rolling Dead.

251
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:44,444
<i>And now, Ike and Tina Turner.</i>

252
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,320
Thank you.

253
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,110
<i>I don't know what they</i>
<i>paid for them... the costumes...</i>

254
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:48,050
<i>but is there any way...</i>

255
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:03,013
<i>Good. It's nice to have</i>
<i>a chick occasionally.</i>

256
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,948
Far out.

257
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,078
Sorry you had to wait.

258
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,668
Whoo!

259
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:44,265
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>
<i>Thank you kindly.</i>

260
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,904
I think I busted a button
on my trousers.

261
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,469
Hope they don't fall down.

262
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:56,550
It's that jumping around.
I'll have to do it up again.

263
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:01,683
Whoo! You don't want my trousers
to fall down now, do you?

264
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,330
We're gonna...
We're gonna kiss you good-bye.

265
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:18,235
And we leave you
to kiss each other good-bye.

266
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:23,036
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Yes, Mel?</i>

267
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:26,344
- Yes, we still have you.
<i>- I got you in an echo. Think you can pick it up?</i>

268
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:30,217
I'm practicing. I'm going on first
before the Rolling Stones.

269
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:33,154
<i>Can we get you to pick up</i>
<i>the phone like before?</i>

270
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:37,684
Well, what it is now, we're waiting
for Mr. Carter to come in.

271
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,787
But I've just had
a letter read to me...

272
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:43,459
where he said
that he very definitely...

273
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,832
wants the Stones
and the concert there.

274
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:50,533
So, as of this minute, we're
intending that the show go on.

275
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:53,805
They have 200,
300 people working...

276
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:58,713
and it's going to be
quite a problem to get the thing
set up at the Altamont Speedway.

277
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:01,410
But it will be,
and it will start at 10:00.

278
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:04,420
Now, that's where we stand.
I'm waiting for Mr. Carter now.

279
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:08,515
<i>Uh, let me ask and see.</i>
<i>Are the Rolling Stones all in town?</i>

280
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:11,686
<i>- Not Yet. They're coming tonight.</i>
- They're coming in tonight.

281
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:14,993
But everybody's ready,
and they're all set to go.

282
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:19,161
That's where we are.
Is this Mr. Carter?

283
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:22,433
<i>Sheriff, Mr. Carterjust came in.</i>

284
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,997
<i>Now, could we talk a little bit?</i>

285
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:28,875
<i>I can put this on the box</i>
<i>so that we can all hear.</i>

286
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:32,211
And I think, to start,
Mr. Carter has expressed...

287
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:37,448
his willingness to have this
on his private property over there.

288
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:42,356
But the question is of this
narrow road to come in there.

289
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,860
Do you foresee
any problems on that?

290
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:49,866
<i>Well, that basically is</i>
<i>the Highway Patrol's problem,</i>
<i>and they foresee problems.</i>

291
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:53,893
<i>How many cars can Mr. Carter</i>
<i>park on his property?</i>

292
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:57,907
150 cars per acre?
150 cars per acre times 80 acres.

293
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:01,103
<i>- How many?</i>
- 150 times 80.

294
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:04,170
- 12,000.
- <i>12,000 automobiles.</i>

295
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:08,241
<i>Well, up in Tallalamee County,</i>
<i>they estimated they had 80,000 cars.</i>

296
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,254
<i>What are we</i>
<i>going to do with them?</i>

297
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,517
There's much open area
around there.

298
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,855
I can probably arrange
with other landowners.

299
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,360
There's one adjoining me
that has 2,000 acres.

300
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:22,763
<i>Yes, well, we have some of the adjoining landowners</i>
<i>complaining before it's even granted.</i>

301
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:28,066
<i>If there's 50,000 cars that Mr. Carter</i>
<i>can't park, we're in trouble.</i>

302
00:44:19,655 --> 00:44:23,284
8:38 now at KFRC.
This is Frank Terry, and let me repeat:

303
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:28,763
The Rolling Stones'
free concert is going to be on
tomorrow at Altamont Speedway.

304
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:32,562
Apparently, it's one of the most
difficult things to give a free concert.

305
00:44:32,635 --> 00:44:36,332
As you all know, the concert
was originally scheduled
for Golden Gate Park...

306
00:44:36,405 --> 00:44:39,169
and then
at the Sears Point Raceway.

307
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:42,074
<i>Many, many volunteers</i>
<i>went out to Sears Point...</i>

308
00:44:42,144 --> 00:44:45,341
<i>in trucks, cars, trailers,</i>
<i>everything,</i>

309
00:44:45,414 --> 00:44:48,815
<i>packed up all the gear out there</i>
<i>and took it to the Altamont Speedway...</i>

310
00:44:48,884 --> 00:44:51,819
<i>where they are right now,</i>
<i>in the cold, 30-degree weather,</i>

311
00:44:51,887 --> 00:44:54,720
<i>setting up the stage,</i>
<i>setting up the generators...</i>

312
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:57,884
<i>the sound equipment</i>
<i>and the facilities for the people.</i>

313
00:45:59,622 --> 00:46:02,489
<i>We're gonna end it now.</i>
<i>Good-bye.</i>

314
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:09,764
<i>Yeah!</i>

315
00:46:46,302 --> 00:46:49,271
Well, all right!
We got to go!

316
00:46:49,338 --> 00:46:52,705
We got to go!
We got to go!

317
00:46:52,775 --> 00:46:54,902
We got to go!

318
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,822
<i>They hit Mick. Somebody hit him.</i>

319
00:48:20,896 --> 00:48:24,559
<i>- Come on over.</i>
- I hate you!

320
00:48:50,726 --> 00:48:54,890
Keith!
Do you think he'll be coming out?

321
00:48:54,963 --> 00:48:58,831
<i>Oh, Mickey, Mickey,</i>
<i>Mickey, Mickey.</i>

322
00:49:07,042 --> 00:49:10,808
<i>I can't function. I've been</i>
<i>on the scaffolding almost all night.</i>

323
00:49:10,879 --> 00:49:15,373
<i>I can't close my hands. They're formed</i>
<i>to the shape of the scaffolding.</i>

324
00:49:15,451 --> 00:49:18,181
You people that are hanging
on that scaffolding,

325
00:49:18,253 --> 00:49:22,417
<i>you're rendering that scaffold</i>
<i>unsafe by climbing on it.</i>

326
00:49:22,491 --> 00:49:26,359
Those scaffoldings are not built
to take very heavy weight.

327
00:49:26,428 --> 00:49:29,454
So if we could have
some sort of reason,

328
00:49:29,531 --> 00:49:32,762
<i>whatever that might be,</i>
<i>we'd be very pleased.</i>

329
00:49:32,835 --> 00:49:36,794
<i>Arthur, in between moving</i>
<i>around, always turn that off.</i>

330
00:49:36,872 --> 00:49:41,172
<i>Turn it off and turn it on.</i>
<i>Look, you've got to be very cool</i>
<i>with that little thing.</i>

331
00:49:41,243 --> 00:49:44,838
Even though it's supposed to be
electrically correct, man,

332
00:49:44,913 --> 00:49:47,177
you got to really
think right around it.

333
00:49:48,784 --> 00:49:51,810
<i>Are you gonna hear</i>
<i>some music today?</i>

334
00:49:51,887 --> 00:49:55,880
<i>Hey,</i>
<i>you want me to just leave this in here?</i>

335
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:58,620
<i>No.</i>

336
00:50:03,365 --> 00:50:05,299
<i>Hashish.</i>

337
00:50:10,806 --> 00:50:13,104
Hashish.

338
00:50:13,175 --> 00:50:16,076
L.S.D.

339
00:50:16,144 --> 00:50:18,078
<i>Psilocybin.</i>

340
00:50:20,315 --> 00:50:22,408
<i>Hashish.</i>

341
00:50:25,287 --> 00:50:29,587
<i>Make them comfortable.</i>
<i>Even this parking situation back here,</i>

342
00:50:29,658 --> 00:50:31,922
it's all wrong, but
that's the way the kids park.

343
00:50:31,994 --> 00:50:34,224
For once, we're just
gonna let it happen.

344
00:50:34,296 --> 00:50:36,423
For experimental purposes.
You know what I mean?

345
00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:39,160
<i>So be as easy on this</i>
<i>as we can.</i>

346
00:50:39,234 --> 00:50:42,761
<i>It won't hurt the Stones</i>
<i>in any way.</i>

347
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:50,106
Wow!

348
00:50:50,178 --> 00:50:54,911
Wow, but I wanna be smart,
but you're just so far out.

349
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:04,218
Because... yeah!

350
00:51:17,472 --> 00:51:21,875
They should be back when
they discover we're not with them.

351
00:51:21,944 --> 00:51:25,505
Since we've got the beer
and the food, they'll find us.

352
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:41,587
<i>Well, a guy's freaking out</i>
<i>over at the tent there...</i>

353
00:51:41,663 --> 00:51:44,257
So, tough shit.

354
00:51:47,135 --> 00:51:50,730
What do you mean, tough shit?
The guy's really freaking out.

355
00:51:50,806 --> 00:51:52,740
Keep-Keep your...

356
00:51:52,808 --> 00:51:55,743
No, I don't mean tough shit.
What I mean is that...

357
00:51:55,811 --> 00:51:59,611
if you lay successive
numbers of bums on this crowd,

358
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:04,015
by the time 6:00 comes around,
they're gonna be in a real mood.

359
00:52:04,086 --> 00:52:09,388
I'm not prepared to stand
here laying bum trips...

360
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:14,293
Up at Woodstock this was done,
and you were there, and you know.

361
00:52:14,363 --> 00:52:16,297
And announcements were made.

362
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:28,037
We're just sort of
getting there, basically.

363
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:30,704
If we make it.

364
00:52:30,779 --> 00:52:34,237
I've been falling a lot lately.

365
00:52:34,316 --> 00:52:37,683
Let's go this way.
Whoa! When did this happen?

366
00:52:37,753 --> 00:52:41,519
<i>There's already a doctor over there.</i>
<i>A chick's having a baby.</i>

367
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:43,524
She's having a baby.

368
00:52:43,592 --> 00:52:46,584
Contributions
to Panther Defense Fund.

369
00:52:49,331 --> 00:52:52,789
Contributions
to the Panther Defense Fund.

370
00:52:52,868 --> 00:52:55,803
They're trying to either
wipe out the Panther party...

371
00:52:55,871 --> 00:52:59,773
by jailing all the members
and wiping them out economically,

372
00:52:59,841 --> 00:53:03,402
financially, or violently
through killing them.

373
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,574
After all, they're just...
they're just Negroes, you know?

374
00:53:11,253 --> 00:53:14,245
<i>Need that cannon Ypretty bad.</i>

375
00:53:29,171 --> 00:53:31,901
<i>We just had our first baby</i>
<i>born at Carter's Altamont Speedway.</i>

376
00:53:31,973 --> 00:53:34,999
<i>Yeah, right, yes.</i>

377
00:53:35,077 --> 00:53:38,274
- Just had our first baby born.
- Oh, wow.

378
00:53:38,346 --> 00:53:40,712
Okay so far.
Everything's all right.

379
00:53:40,782 --> 00:53:44,343
- We have a helicopter standing by.
- Can we get a mike?

380
00:53:44,419 --> 00:53:48,219
Dick Carter's Altamont Speedway,
not just Altamont Speedway.

381
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:51,054
This cat right over here.
He just told me to do it, man.

382
00:53:51,126 --> 00:53:54,152
No, well, I'm sorry.
Nobody else goes there except me.

383
00:53:54,229 --> 00:53:57,255
I'd really like you to get off
the stage, baby, please.

384
00:53:57,332 --> 00:53:59,266
Okay, well, I can dig that.

385
00:53:59,334 --> 00:54:01,529
- Thanks very much.
- Uh-huh.

386
00:54:09,177 --> 00:54:13,079
<i>The American Red Cross</i>
<i>has asked us to secure these supplies.</i>

387
00:54:13,148 --> 00:54:16,481
<i>If anyone has any</i>
<i>of these things to contribute.</i>

388
00:54:16,551 --> 00:54:18,781

Excuse me.
Which way is the stage?

393
00:54:33,702 --> 00:54:36,637
Around the corner?
You mean that way?

394
00:54:36,705 --> 00:54:39,697
<i>I think we're in pretty good</i>
<i>shape, though, right now.</i>

395
00:54:39,775 --> 00:54:42,869
We're in chaos backstage.
We'll never get...

396
00:54:42,944 --> 00:54:46,277
That's gonna have to be cleared,
'cause the group's gotta come in.

397
00:54:46,348 --> 00:54:50,114
What we need to do is start
getting some blokes together...

398
00:54:50,185 --> 00:54:53,052
The essence of it, as far as I'm concerned,
is this is where the work has gotta go.

399
00:54:53,121 --> 00:54:56,716
- Right.
- Sling them all out.

400
00:54:56,792 --> 00:55:02,628
No fucking about. We've had enough
of being polite. Get out, go away.

401
00:55:02,697 --> 00:55:06,098
- I've asked. I know.
- So if you could help us, that would be groovy.

402
00:55:06,168 --> 00:55:09,296
- Sure.
- All these people, you know?

403
00:55:09,371 --> 00:55:13,865
I want to see Mick Jagger,
goddamn it. No!

404
00:55:13,942 --> 00:55:16,877
Can I say just one thing
before you take her off?

405
00:55:16,945 --> 00:55:19,470
- Just let me say one thing.
- I will not!

406
00:55:21,883 --> 00:55:25,284
<i>Hey, before you go away, man.</i>

407
00:55:25,353 --> 00:55:27,981
Don't tell me what to say, okay?

408
00:55:28,056 --> 00:55:31,321
You look after your job, baby,
and I'll look after mine.

409
00:55:31,393 --> 00:55:34,829
You're trying to stop me.
I'm trying to ask you...

410
00:55:34,896 --> 00:55:39,890
Will you ask all these
people that are milling around
if they'd move to the side, man.

<i>- She wants to get fucked.</i>

413
00:56:11,499 --> 00:56:13,990
That's the way!

414
00:56:20,242 --> 00:56:23,211
You don't belong here, man.

415
00:56:32,687 --> 00:56:35,622
- Let me have some of that.
- I wanna get up on stage.

416
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:38,818
<i>The organizers,</i>

00:59:54,522 --> 00:59:57,650
<i>Hey, man, quit crowding.</i>
<i>Just back off.</i>

429
00:59:57,725 --> 01:00:01,889
<i>We need a doctor</i>
<i>under the left-hand scaffold...</i>

430
01:00:01,963 --> 01:00:04,488
<i>as soon as possible, please.</i>

431
01:00:04,566 --> 01:00:07,626
They're not gonna play music
till we get a doctor.

432
01:00:07,702 --> 01:00:10,136
Somebody help.

433
01:00:11,506 --> 01:00:13,599
Somebody's hurt!

434
01:00:33,995 --> 01:00:36,293
Marianne Faithfull is here.

435
01:00:40,768 --> 01:00:44,033
You feel like signing a few albums?

436
01:00:44,105 --> 01:00:47,199
Let me have that album.
Where's that album?

437
01:00:51,146 --> 01:00:53,080
Thank you.

438
01:00:54,415 --> 01:00:56,747
Well, I'm not stepping outside.

439
01:00:56,818 --> 01:00:59,981
<i>- I don't blame you.</i>
- I am. I want to.

440
01:01:00,054 --> 01:01:02,648
<i>- Just sign this.</i>
- But I can't get very far.

441
01:01:02,724 --> 01:01:05,158
<i>Sign this, please.</i>
<i>Sign this one too.</i>

442
01:01:05,226 --> 01:01:09,993
<i>Hey, what about the free</i>
<i>records and all the rest of the shit?</i>

443
01:01:10,064 --> 01:01:15,366
<i>There are a number of people</i>
<i>on and around this stage</i>
<i>who should not be here.</i>

444
01:01:15,436 --> 01:01:20,373
Consequently... Consequently,
the musicians on this stage...

445
01:01:20,441 --> 01:01:25,845
are playing with something like
200 people breathing down their necks.

446
01:01:25,914 --> 01:01:28,940
<i>Now, can I please ask that</i>
<i>everyone leaves the stage...</i>

447
01:01:29,017 --> 01:01:33,249
<i>and, as I say, we'll go back to</i>
<i>playing music and nothing else.</i>

448
01:01:34,756 --> 01:01:37,919
<i>TheJefferson Airplane.</i>
<i>Jefferson Airplane.</i>

449
01:04:36,304 --> 01:04:38,238
<i>Easy!</i>

450
01:04:44,545 --> 01:04:46,479
Easy!

451
01:04:50,184 --> 01:04:52,778
Easy.

452
01:04:52,854 --> 01:04:56,290
Easy. Easy.

453
01:04:56,357 --> 01:05:00,259
<i>Easy. Easy.</i>

454
01:05:22,016 --> 01:05:23,950
Easy.

455
01:05:25,319 --> 01:05:28,618
Please be quiet.

456
01:05:28,689 --> 01:05:31,419
<i>Please be quiet.</i>

457
01:05:31,492 --> 01:05:34,359
Please be quiet.

458
01:05:34,429 --> 01:05:38,365
<i>Please be quiet.</i>

459
01:05:49,243 --> 01:05:51,768
<i>Yeah, it's all right.</i>
<i>It's kind of weird up here.</i>

460
01:05:51,846 --> 01:05:54,815
<i>Hey, man, I'd like to mention</i>
<i>that the Hell's Angels...</i>

461
01:05:54,882 --> 01:05:58,181
just smashed Marty Balin in the face
and knocked him out for a bit.

462
01:05:58,252 --> 01:06:00,812
I'd like to thank you for that.

463
01:06:00,888 --> 01:06:03,083
<i>There's other ways...</i>

464
01:06:03,157 --> 01:06:05,717
<i>Hey, wait. Is this on?</i>

465
01:06:05,793 --> 01:06:09,490
<i>- You're talkin'to me, I'm gonna talk to you.</i>
- I'm not talking to you.

466
01:06:09,564 --> 01:06:13,022
You're talking to my people.
Let me tell you what's happenin'.

467
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:16,263
You is what happenin'!

468
01:06:16,337 --> 01:06:19,067
Hey! Oh!

469
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:23,076
- No! No!
- Watch it. Hold it.

470
01:06:26,948 --> 01:06:29,974
- No, stop it!
- You know what's happening?

471
01:06:30,051 --> 01:06:33,077
- What's happening?
- We're partying like you.

472
01:06:33,154 --> 01:06:36,248
No! No!

473
01:06:38,292 --> 01:06:42,160
<i>Um, you know,</i>
<i>that's really stupid.</i>

474
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:45,859
Hey, man, you guys don't have to stay on
the stage. They're not gonna hassle us.

475
01:06:45,933 --> 01:06:48,766
<i>- Hey.</i>
- They're not really that... That's really not worth it.

476
01:06:48,836 --> 01:06:51,532
<i>You don't hassle</i>
<i>with anybody in particular.</i>

477
01:06:51,606 --> 01:06:55,940
<i>You gotta keep your bodies off</i>
<i>each other unless you intend love.</i>

478
01:06:56,010 --> 01:07:00,709
<i>People get weird, and you need people</i>
<i>like the Angels to keep people in line.</i>

479
01:07:00,781 --> 01:07:05,013
<i>But the Angels also...</i>
<i>You know, you don't bust</i>
<i>people in the head for nothing.</i>

480
01:07:05,086 --> 01:07:09,284
<i>So both sides are, uh,</i>
<i>fucking up temporarily.</i>

481
01:07:09,357 --> 01:07:12,349
<i>Let's not keep fuckin'up!</i>

482
01:07:23,905 --> 01:07:26,703
- Oh, that's what the story is here?
- Yeah.

483
01:07:26,774 --> 01:07:29,641
- Oh, bummer.
- Really bad. I mean, like, it's scary.

484
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:31,974
- Who's doing all the beating?
- Hell's Angels.

485
01:07:32,046 --> 01:07:35,174
- Hell's Angels are beating on musicians?
- Marty got beat up.

486
01:07:35,249 --> 01:07:37,547
- A fight on the stage.
- Doesn't seem right, man.

487
01:07:37,618 --> 01:07:39,848
It's really weird, man.
It's really weird.

488
01:07:39,921 --> 01:07:42,719
<i>- Oh, man! Really?</i>
<i>- There's lots of people.</i>

489
01:07:46,661 --> 01:07:49,323
<i>Get that cleared!</i>

490
01:07:49,397 --> 01:07:51,592
<i>Let's get it!</i>

491
01:08:46,554 --> 01:08:49,318
Oh, babies.

492
01:08:51,158 --> 01:08:54,355
There's so many of you.

493
01:08:54,428 --> 01:08:58,057
Just be cool down in front
and don't push around.

494
01:09:00,301 --> 01:09:03,270
Just keep still.
Keep together.

495
01:09:05,806 --> 01:09:07,740
Oh, yeah.

496
01:10:07,768 --> 01:10:10,760
Hey! Hey!

497
01:10:17,645 --> 01:10:21,172
Hey, Keith, Keith, Keith!

498
01:10:21,248 --> 01:10:23,808
Keith, will you cool it,
and I'll try and stop it.

499
01:10:23,884 --> 01:10:27,945
Hey, hey, people.

500
01:10:28,022 --> 01:10:31,253
Sisters.
Brothers and sisters.

501
01:10:31,325 --> 01:10:36,991
<i>Brothers and sisters, come on now.</i>

502
01:10:37,064 --> 01:10:40,693
<i>That means everybody just cool out!</i>

503
01:10:42,369 --> 01:10:45,634
<i>Will you cool out, everybody?</i>

504
01:10:45,706 --> 01:10:48,732
- A fight broke out.
- I know. I'm hip.

505
01:10:50,377 --> 01:10:54,370
Everybody be cool now.
Come on.

506
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:58,384
All right?

507
01:10:58,452 --> 01:11:02,218
<i>How are we doing over there?</i>
<i>All right?</i>

508
01:11:02,289 --> 01:11:05,087
<i>Can we still make it</i>
<i>down the front?</i>

509
01:11:05,159 --> 01:11:08,856
<i>Is there anyone there</i>
<i>that's hurt? Huh?</i>

510
01:11:08,929 --> 01:11:11,523
<i>Everyone all right?</i>
<i>Okay?</i>

511
01:11:13,367 --> 01:11:17,736
<i>All right, I think we are cool.</i>
<i>We can do...</i>

512
01:11:17,805 --> 01:11:22,333
We're always having... Something very
funny happens when we start that number.

513
01:15:02,129 --> 01:15:05,121
I need to get down with it now.

514
01:17:15,963 --> 01:17:17,897
<i>All right!</i>

515
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:26,606
<i>Uh, people,
who's fighting, what for?</i>

516
01:17:28,675 --> 01:17:32,167
<i>Who's fighting, and what for?</i>

517
01:17:32,246 --> 01:17:37,912
<i>Why are we fighting?</i>
<i>Why are we fighting?</i>

518
01:17:37,985 --> 01:17:42,479
<i>We don't want to fight.</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

519
01:17:42,556 --> 01:17:44,956
Do we want...
Who wants to fight?

520
01:17:45,025 --> 01:17:46,959
Who is it?

521
01:17:50,664 --> 01:17:53,565
Hey, you know, I mean...

522
01:17:53,634 --> 01:17:56,501
Every other scene
has been cool. Let...

523
01:17:56,570 --> 01:18:00,768
Look, that guy there,
if he doesn't stop it, man...

524
01:18:02,709 --> 01:18:06,167
Listen, either those cats
cool it, or we don't play.

525
01:18:06,246 --> 01:18:08,214
- Come on.
<i>- You gonna stop?</i>

526
01:18:10,317 --> 01:18:12,251
<i>We need a doctor!</i>

527
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:14,913
If you don't cool it,
you ain't gonna hear no music!

528
01:18:14,988 --> 01:18:17,786
Now, you wanna all
go home or what?

529
01:18:20,127 --> 01:18:22,721
We need doctors
down here now, please.

530
01:18:22,796 --> 01:18:25,629
Can we have a doctor
down here now to the front?

531
01:18:31,805 --> 01:18:35,434
L-I cannot see what's going on.
I just know that every time...

532
01:18:35,509 --> 01:18:37,943
we get to a number,
something happens.

533
01:18:38,011 --> 01:18:40,479
I don't know what's
going on, who's doing what.

534
01:18:40,547 --> 01:18:43,414
<i>It's just a scuffle.</i>
<i>All I can ask you,</i>

535
01:18:43,483 --> 01:18:46,577
<i>San Francisco,</i>
<i>is like the whole thing.</i>

536
01:18:46,653 --> 01:18:50,419
<i>Like, this could be</i>
<i>the most beautiful evening...</i>

537
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:54,517
<i>we've had for this winter,</i>
<i>you know, and we've really...</i>

538
01:18:54,595 --> 01:18:58,497
<i>Why don't... Don't fuck it up, man.</i>
<i>Come on, let's get it together.</i>

539
01:18:58,565 --> 01:19:01,261
I can't do any more
than just ask you,

540
01:19:01,335 --> 01:19:03,929
beg you, just
to keep it together.

541
01:19:04,004 --> 01:19:06,905
You can do it.
It's within your power.

542
01:19:06,974 --> 01:19:10,375
Everyone, Hell's Angels, everybody,

543
01:19:10,444 --> 01:19:13,538
let's just keep ourselves together.

544
01:19:15,682 --> 01:19:19,618
You know, if we are all one,
let's show we're all one.

545
01:19:21,888 --> 01:19:25,483
- Preach it, brother!
- Up on the scaffold. Urgently, man.

546
01:19:25,559 --> 01:19:27,789
There's one thing
horrible that we need.

547
01:19:27,861 --> 01:19:30,694
Sam, we need an ambulance.

548
01:19:30,764 --> 01:19:33,324
We need a doctor
by that scaffold there.

549
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:36,301
If there's a doctor,
can he get to there?

550
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:39,965
Okay, here we go. We're gonna...
I don't know what we're doing.

551
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:43,874
<i>When we get to really the end</i>
<i>and we all want to go absolutely crazy,</i>

552
01:19:43,944 --> 01:19:47,141
<i>and, like, jump on each other,</i>
<i>then we'll stand up again.</i>

553
01:19:47,214 --> 01:19:49,910
<i>You know what I mean?</i>
<i>Everyone keep... sit down.</i>

554
01:19:49,983 --> 01:19:52,383
<i>I mean, just keep cool,</i>
<i>and let's just relax.</i>

555
01:19:52,452 --> 01:19:56,354
Let's just get into the groove.
Come on, we can get it together.

556
01:19:56,423 --> 01:19:58,891
Come on. Sit down.

557
01:23:35,141 --> 01:23:38,235
<i>Hey, man, look. We're splitting.</i>
<i>If those cats can't...</i>

558
01:23:38,311 --> 01:23:43,112
<i>If you people... We're splitting</i>
<i>if those cats don't stop beating</i>
<i>everybody up in sight.</i>

559
01:23:43,183 --> 01:23:47,552
I want them out of the way, man.
I don't like you...

560
01:23:47,621 --> 01:23:50,522
A guy's got a gun out here,
and he's shooting at the stage.

561
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:52,785
- It's one guy.
- He's got a gun.

562
01:23:52,859 --> 01:23:55,453
Hey, people.
Hey, people.

563
01:23:55,529 --> 01:23:57,827
Come on, let's be cool.

564
01:23:57,898 --> 01:24:00,458
People, please.

565
01:24:00,534 --> 01:24:04,630
There's no reason to hassle anybody.
Please don't permit it.

566
01:24:04,704 --> 01:24:10,199
If you move back and sit down,
we can continue and we will continue.

567
01:24:10,277 --> 01:24:12,211
<i>Can you roll back</i>
<i>on that, David?</i>

568
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:14,213
Sure.

569
01:24:32,999 --> 01:24:35,092
<i>Did you see</i>
<i>what was happening there?</i>

570
01:24:35,168 --> 01:24:38,365
<i>No, you couldn't see anything.</i>
<i>Well, it was another scuffle.</i>

571
01:24:38,438 --> 01:24:41,498
<i>There's the Angel</i>
<i>right there, with a knife.</i>

572
01:24:44,044 --> 01:24:46,137
<i>- Where's the gun?</i>
<i>- I'll roll it back.</i>

573
01:24:46,212 --> 01:24:48,976
<i>You'll see it against</i>
<i>the girl's crocheted dress.</i>

574
01:24:49,049 --> 01:24:52,450
<i>Right there, isn't it?</i>

575
01:25:04,497 --> 01:25:08,228
<i>Oh, it's so horrible.</i>

576
01:25:15,675 --> 01:25:18,610
Is there an officer?
Is there a policeman here?

577
01:25:18,678 --> 01:25:21,670
- What happened here, anyway?
- Man, he pulled out a gun.

578
01:25:21,748 --> 01:25:24,911
<i>- He did?
<i>- Yes, the Hell's Angels took the gun away from him.

579
01:25:24,985 --> 01:25:27,579
One of them has it now.
He showed it to me.

580
01:25:27,654 --> 01:25:30,589
And they proceeded to put him down
on the ground and started kicking him.

581
01:25:30,657 --> 01:25:33,854
And he has a couple of stab wounds
in his back and one over his ear.

582
01:25:33,927 --> 01:25:37,863
We tried to keep him alive,
but when we got here, the doctor
checked him out and that was it.

583
01:25:37,931 --> 01:25:40,866
<i>We pronounced him dead at about 6:20.</i>

584
01:25:40,934 --> 01:25:44,665
<i>We have a request from the state police.</i>

585
01:25:44,738 --> 01:25:49,675
- I don't want him to die! Don't let him die, please!
- He won't die!

586
01:25:49,743 --> 01:25:53,611
Now, they're gonna do
everything in their power.

587
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:57,309
- But they can't hear his heart.
- <i>Now, don't worry about it.</i>

588
01:25:57,384 --> 01:26:00,182
Don't worry about it.

589
01:26:00,253 --> 01:26:03,586
- They're gonna put him
in this whirlybird and take...
- I have to go with him.

590
01:26:03,657 --> 01:26:05,989
Get back, please.

591
01:26:34,788 --> 01:26:36,722
Yeah!

592
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:43,954
Whoo!
Bye, bye, bye, bye!

593
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:47,864
Bye, bye, bye, bye!
Oh, yeah!

594
01:27:01,981 --> 01:27:03,915
Come on in!

595
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:04,676
All right.

596
01:28:04,744 --> 01:28:07,269
See you all.

597
01:28:07,347 --> 01:28:09,281
<i>All right.</i>
