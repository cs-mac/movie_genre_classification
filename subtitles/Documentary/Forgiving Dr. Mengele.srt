1
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:46,104
<i>For more than a year, ominous rumors</i>
<i>had been privately circulating...</i>

2
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,542
<i>... among high-level</i>
<i>Western leaders...</i>

3
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:52,582
<i>... that the Soviet Union had been at</i>
<i>work on what was darkly hinted to be...</i>

4
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:56,313
<i>... the ultimate weapon:</i>
<i>a doomsday device.</i>

5
00:00:56,523 --> 00:01:00,289
<i>Intelligence sources traced the site</i>
<i>of the top-secret Russian project...</i>

6
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:03,053
<i>... to the perpetually fog-shrouded</i>
<i>wasteland...</i>

7
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:06,528
<i>... below the Arctic peaks</i>
<i>of the Zhokhov Islands.</i>

8
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,030
<i>What they were building...</i>

9
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:11,931
<i>... or why it should be located in such</i>
<i>a remote and desolate place...</i>

10
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,333
<i>... no one could say.</i>

11
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:48,024
- General Ripper, sir.
- Group Captain Mandrake speaking.

12
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:51,190
- This is General Ripper speaking.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

13
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:55,094
- Do you recognize my voice?
- I do, sir. Why do you ask?

14
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,928
Why do you think I ask?

15
00:03:57,136 --> 00:04:00,594
Well, I don't know, sir. We spoke
just a few moments ago, didn't we?

16
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:05,904
You don't think I'd ask unless it was
pretty damned important, do you?

17
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:09,741
- No, I don't, sir, no.
- <i>Let's see if we can stay on the ball.</i>

18
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:13,213
Has the wing confirmed holding
at their fail-safe points?

19
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,115
Yes, sir. The confirmations
have all just come in.

20
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:19,655
Very well.
Now, listen to me carefully.

21
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,350
The base is being
put on condition red.

22
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,030
I want this flashed
to all sections immediately.

23
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,395
Condition red. Jolly good idea.
Keeps the men on their toes.

24
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,694
I'm afraid this is not an exercise.

25
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,663
Not an exercise, sir?

26
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:39,908
I shouldn't tell you this, but you're a
good officer and have a right to know.

27
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,013
It looks like we're in a shooting war.

28
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,816
Oh, hell.

29
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,987
- Are the Russians involved?
- <i>That's all I've been told.</i>

30
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:52,886
It came in on the red phone. I'm gonna
follow orders and seal this base tight.

31
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:57,459
Now, I want you to transmit Plan R...

32
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,461
...R for Robert, to the wing.

33
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,931
- <i>Plan R for Robert.</i>
- Is it that bad, sir?

34
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,502
- Looks like it's pretty hairy.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

35
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,605
Plan R for Robert, sir.

36
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,004
Now, last, and possibly
most important...

37
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,078
...I want all privately-owned radios
to be immediately impounded.

38
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:18,910
They might be used to issue
instructions to saboteurs.

39
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,485
As I previously arranged, Air Police
will have lists of all owners.

40
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:26,318
I want every single one of them
collected without exception.

41
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,756
After you've done that,
report back to me.

42
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,482
<i>In order to guard against</i>
<i>surprise nuclear attack...</i>

43
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,556
<i>... America's Strategic Air Command...</i>

44
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,490
<i>... maintains a large force</i>
<i>of B-52 bombers...</i>

45
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,164
<i>... airborne 24 hours a day.</i>

46
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:11,162
<i>Each B-52 can deliver a nuclear</i>
<i>bomb load of 50 megatons...</i>

47
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:16,768
<i>... equal to 16 times the total explosive</i>
<i>force of all the bombs and shells...</i>

48
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:20,742
<i>... used by all the armies</i>
<i>in World War II.</i>

49
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,472
<i>Based in America,</i>
<i>the Airborne Alert Force...</i>

50
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,618
<i>... is deployed from the Persian Gulf</i>
<i>to the Arctic Ocean.</i>

51
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,811
<i>But they have one geographical factor</i>
<i>in common:</i>

52
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:33,924
<i>They are all two hours</i>
<i>from their targets inside Russia.</i>

53
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,707
Major Kong, I know you'll think
this is crazy...

54
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:00,504
...but I just got a message from base
over the CRM 114.

55
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:05,550
It decodes as wing attack Plan R.
R for Romeo.

56
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:12,852
Goldie, did you say
wing attack Plan R?

57
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,624
Yes, sir, I have.

58
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:21,458
Goldie, how many times have
I told you guys...

59
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,602
...that I don't want
no horsing around on the airplane?

60
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,466
I'm not horsing around, sir,
that's how it decodes.

61
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,642
Well, I've been to one world fair,
a picnic and a rodeo...

62
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,142
<i>... and that's the stupidest thing</i>
<i>I ever heard over earphones.</i>

63
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,110
You sure you got today's code?

64
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,639
Yes, sir, it is.

65
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,319
There's just gotta be
something wrong.

66
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,785
Wait a second, I'm coming back.

67
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:21,616
Maybe you'd better get
a confirmation from base.

68
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,419
Yes, sir.

69
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,786
Major Kong, is it possible
this is some kind of loyalty test?

70
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:51,286
Give the go code and then recall
to see who would actually go?

71
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,017
Ain't nobody ever got
the go code yet.

72
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,320
Old Ripper wouldn't be giving us
Plan R...

73
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,124
...unless them Russkies had
clobbered Washington...

74
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,699
...and a lot of other towns
with a sneak attack.

75
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:03,891
Yes, sir.

76
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,571
Major Kong, message
from base confirmed.

77
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,269
Well, boys, I reckon this is it.

78
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,343
Nuclear combat toe-to-toe
with the Russkies.

79
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:38,067
Now, look, boys, I ain't much
of a hand at making speeches.

80
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:42,698
But I got a pretty fair idea
that something doggone important...

81
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,466
...is going on back there.

82
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:49,307
Now, I've got a fair idea of the kind
of personal emotions...

83
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,006
<i>... that some of you fellows</i>
<i>may be thinking.</i>

84
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:55,085
<i>Heck, I reckon you wouldn't even be</i>
<i>human beings...</i>

85
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:59,757
<i>... if you didn't have strong personal</i>
<i>feelings about nuclear combat.</i>

86
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,420
<i>But I want you to remember</i>
<i>one thing:</i>

87
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:05,256
<i>That folks back home</i>
<i>is counting on you...</i>

88
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,932
<i>... and by golly,</i>
<i>we ain't about to let them down.</i>

89
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,399
Tell you something else.

90
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:16,900
If this thing turns out to be half as
important as I figure it just might be...

91
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:21,512
...I'd say that you're all in line
for some important promotions...

92
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,774
...and personal citations
when this thing's over with.

93
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,851
And that goes for
every last one of you...

94
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:31,615
...regardless of your race,
color or your creed.

95
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:35,487
Now, let's get this thing on the hump.
We got some flying to do.

96
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,302
Buck, should I get it?

97
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,375
Yeah, you have to.

98
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,846
Hello?

99
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:05,513
Yes, General Turgidson is here, but he
can't come to the phone at the moment.

100
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,920
Well, this is his secretary,
Miss Scott.

101
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,188
Freddie, how are you?

102
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,524
Fine, and you?

103
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,794
Oh, we were just catching up
on some of the general's paperwork.

104
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,065
Well, look, Freddie, he's tied up
at the moment.

105
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,071
I'm afraid he can't come to the phone.

106
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,470
Just a minute.

107
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,806
General Turgidson,
a Colonel Puntrich calling.

108
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,811
Tell him to call back.

109
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:35,578
Freddie, the general says could you
call back in a minute or two?

110
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,585
He says it can't wait.

111
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,987
For Pete's... Find out what he wants.

112
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:44,959
Freddie, the thing is, the general
is in the powder room right now.

113
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,359
Could you tell me what it's about?

114
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:49,634
Just a second.

115
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,861
Apparently they monitored
a transmission eight minutes ago...

116
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,973
...from Burpelson Air Force Base.

117
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:02,371
Right. It was directed to the
843rd bomb wing on airborne alert.

118
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:07,550
It decoded as wing attack Plan R.

119
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:13,191
Well, tell him to call what's-his-name,
the base commander. Ripper.

120
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,019
Do I have to think of everything?

121
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:19,687
The general suggests you call General
Ripper, the 843rd base commander.

122
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,164
All communications are dead.

123
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,634
Bull! Tell him to do it himself.

124
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,208
Freddie, the general asks if
you could possibly try again yourself.

125
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:36,372
I see. He says he's tried personally
several times, but everything is dead.

126
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,915
Even the normal phone lines
are shut down.

127
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,390
Fred? Buck. What's it look like?

128
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,429
Yeah?

129
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,868
Well, are you sure it's Plan R?

130
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:03,668
What's cooking on the threat board?
Nothing? Nothing at all?

131
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,369
I don't like the look of this, Fred.

132
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,815
Tell you what you better do,
old buddy.

133
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,350
Give Elmo and Charlie a blast.
Bump everything up to condition red.

134
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,818
Stand by the blower.
I'll get back to you.

135
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,150
- What's up?
- Nothing, nothing.

136
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,957
- Where's my shorts?
- On the floor. Where are you going?

137
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,791
No place.

138
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:31,595
I thought I might mosey over to the
war room, see what's doing over there.

139
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,465
It's 3:00 in the morning.

140
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,469
The Air Force never sleeps.

141
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:39,542
Buck, honey, I'm not sleepy either.

142
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,944
I know how it is, baby.

143
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,118
Tell you what you do.

144
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:52,055
You just start your countdown
and old Bucky will be back here...

145
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,750
...before you can say, "Blastoff!"

146
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:02,090
<i>Your Commie has no regard</i>
<i>for human life, not even his own.</i>

147
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,202
<i>And for this reason, men,</i>
<i>I want to impress upon you...</i>

148
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,134
<i>... the need</i>
<i>for extreme watchfulness.</i>

149
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,333
The enemy may come individually
or he may come in strength.

150
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,206
He may even come in the uniform
of our own troops.

151
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,572
<i>But however he comes,</i>
<i>we must stop him.</i>

152
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:22,481
<i>We must not allow him</i>
<i>to gain entrance to this base.</i>

153
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:26,889
<i>Now, I am going to give you</i>
<i>three simple rules.</i>

154
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:31,461
<i>First: trust no one,</i>
<i>whatever his uniform or rank...</i>

155
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,030
<i>... unless he is known</i>
<i>to you personally.</i>

156
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,963
Second: anyone or anything...

157
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:41,936
...that approaches within 200 yards
of the perimeter is to be fired upon.

158
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:47,636
<i>Third: if in doubt, shoot first</i>
<i>and ask questions afterwards.</i>

159
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:51,077
<i>I would sooner accept</i>
<i>a few casualties through accident...</i>

160
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:55,276
<i>... than lose the entire base and</i>
<i>its personnel through carelessness.</i>

161
00:15:55,487 --> 00:16:00,015
<i>Any variation on these rules</i>
<i>must come from me personally.</i>

162
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,389
<i>Now, men, in conclusion...</i>

163
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:07,531
<i>... I would like to say</i>
<i>that in the two years...</i>

164
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:11,396
<i>... it has been my privilege</i>
<i>to be your commanding officer...</i>

165
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,401
<i>... I have always expected</i>
<i>the best from you...</i>

166
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:18,372
<i>... and you have never given me</i>
<i>anything less than that.</i>

167
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:22,638
<i>Today the nation is counting on us.</i>

168
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,712
<i>We are not going to let them down.</i>

169
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,909
<i>Good luck to you all.</i>

170
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,110
Here's the attack profile, sir.

171
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,947
This is your attack profile.

172
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,278
"To ensure that the enemy cannot
monitor voice transmission...

173
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,477
...or plant false transmission...

174
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:41,682
...the CRM 114 is to be switched
into all receiver circuits.

175
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,227
The emergency base code prefix
is to be set...

176
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,695
<i>... on the dials of the CRM.</i>

177
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,337
<i>This will block any transmission other</i>
<i>than those preceded by a code prefix.</i>

178
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,065
Stand by to set code prefix.

179
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,607
Roger. Ready to set code prefix.

180
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,211
Set code prefix.

181
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:13,314
- Code prefix set.
- Lock code prefix.

182
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,359
Code prefix locked.

183
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,999
Switch all receiver circuits
to CRM discriminators.

184
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,365
All circuits switched
to CRM discriminators.

185
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,096
<i>Check auto-destruct circuits.</i>

186
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,609
Auto-destruct circuits checked.

187
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:42,350
Primary target:
the ICBM complex at Laputa.

188
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:48,789
Target reference:
Yankee-Golf-Tango, 360.

189
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:54,955
Thirty-megaton nuclear device
fused for airburst at 10,000 feet.

190
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:59,536
<i>Twenty-megaton nuclear device</i>
<i>will be used if first malfunctions.</i>

191
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,263
<i>Otherwise, proceed</i>
<i>to secondary target:</i>

192
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:06,376
<i>Missile complex seven miles east</i>
<i>of Borchov.</i>

193
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:10,412
<i>Target reference:</i>
<i>November-Bravo-X-ray...</i>

194
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,948
...108.

195
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:18,385
Fused airburst at 10...
Check, 12,000 feet.

196
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:33,535
Excuse me, sir. Something rather
interesting has just cropped up.

197
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,503
Listen to that. Music.
Civilian broadcasting.

198
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:42,310
I think the Pentagon has given us
an exercise to test our readiness.

199
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,277
I think it's taking things too far.

200
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,646
Our fellows will be inside Russian
radar cover in 20 minutes.

201
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:51,311
Listen to that. Chock-a-block
full of stations, all churning it out.

202
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,319
- Mandrake?
- Yes, sir?

203
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,654
I thought I issued instructions
for all radios to be impounded.

204
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:02,027
You did, and I was in the process of
impounding this when I switched it on.

205
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:05,829
I thought, our fellows hitting Russian
radar, dropping all their stuff...

206
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:10,304
...I'd better tell you. Because if
they do, it'll cause a bit of a stink.

207
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:14,445
Group captain,
the officer-exchange program...

208
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:18,138
...does not give you any special
prerogatives to question my orders.

209
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,446
I realize that, sir, but I thought you'd
be rather pleased to hear the news.

210
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,282
I mean, after all...
Well, let's face it.

211
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,426
We don't want to start a nuclear war
unless we really have to, do we?

212
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,990
Please sit down.
And turn that thing off.

213
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,188
Yes, sir.

214
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,167
What about the planes? Surely we
must issue the recall code immediately.

215
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,102
Group captain, the planes
are not gonna be recalled.

216
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:46,766
My attack orders have been issued
and the orders stand.

217
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,241
If you'll excuse me saying so, sir,
that would be, to my way of thinking...

218
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,476
...rather an odd way of looking at it.

219
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,950
If a Russian attack was in progress...

220
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:00,955
...we would certainly not be hearing
civilian broadcasting.

221
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,889
- Are you certain of that?
- I'm absolutely positive.

222
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,291
And what if it is true?

223
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,867
I'm afraid I'm still not with you, sir,
because, I mean...

224
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,734
If a Russian attack
was not in progress...

225
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:19,036
...then your use of Plan R... In fact,
your orders to the entire wing...

226
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:30,984
I would say that there was something
dreadfully wrong somewhere.

227
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,354
Why don't you take it easy,
group captain.

228
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,323
Please make me a drink
of grain alcohol and rainwater...

229
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,997
...and help yourself
to whatever you'd like.

230
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,733
General Ripper, sir, as an officer
in Her Majesty's Air Force...

231
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:56,072
...it is my clear duty
under the present circumstances...

232
00:21:56,281 --> 00:22:00,843
...to issue the recall code upon my
own authority and bring back the wing.

233
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,987
If you'll excuse me, sir.

234
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:16,431
Sir, I must ask you for the key and the
recall code. Have you got them handy?

235
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,001
I told you to take it easy,
group captain.

236
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,672
There's nothing anybody can do
about this now.

237
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,138
I'm the only person who knows
the code group.

238
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,403
Then I must insist, sir,
that you give them to me!

239
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:39,913
Do I take it, sir, you are threatening
a brother officer with a gun?

240
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:46,254
Mandrake, I suppose
it never occurred to you...

241
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:49,923
...that while we're chatting here
so enjoyably...

242
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,866
...a decision is being made
by the president...

243
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:57,166
...and the joint chiefs in the war room
at the Pentagon.

244
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:03,771
And when they realize there is
no possibility of recalling the wing...

245
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:07,281
...there will be only one course
of action open:

246
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,177
Total commitment.

247
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:17,895
Mandrake, do you recall what
Clemenceau once said about war?

248
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,892
No, I don't think I do, sir. No.

249
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,593
He said war was too important
to be left to the generals.

250
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:30,573
When he said that, 50 years ago...

251
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,244
...he might have been right.

252
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,675
But today...

253
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:39,214
...war is too important
to be left to politicians.

254
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:43,752
They have neither the time,
the training...

255
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,947
...nor the inclination
for strategic thought.

256
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:54,030
I can no longer sit back
and allow...

257
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:59,260
...Communist infiltration,
Communist indoctrination...

258
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,837
...Communist subversion...

259
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:06,307
...and the international
Communist conspiracy...

260
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:09,241
...to sap and impurify...

261
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,713
...all of our precious bodily fluids.

262
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,255
Staines, is everybody here?

263
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,019
Mr. President, the secretary of state
is in Vietnam.

264
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:26,994
The secretary of defense is in Laos,
the vice president is in Mexico City.

265
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:30,032
We can establish contact with them
at any time.

266
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:31,964
The undersecretaries are all here.

267
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,196
Right. Now, General Turgidson,
what's going on here?

268
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,243
Mr. President...

269
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:42,971
...about 35 minutes ago...

270
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:47,049
...General Jack Ripper,
the commanding general...

271
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,550
...of Burpelson Air Force Base...

272
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,882
...issued an order to the 34 B-52s
of his wing...

273
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,082
...which were airborne at the time...

274
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:59,286
...as part of a special exercise we were
holding called Operation Dropkick.

275
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:04,126
Now, it appears that the order
called for the planes...

276
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,567
...to attack their targets
inside Russia.

277
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:11,868
The planes are fully armed
with nuclear weapons...

278
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:15,444
...with an average load
of 40 megatons each.

279
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:20,084
Now, the central display of Russia will
indicate the position of the planes.

280
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:24,718
The triangles
are their primary targets.

281
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:28,689
The squares
are their secondary targets.

282
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:34,161
The aircraft will begin penetrating
Russian radar cover within 25 minutes.

283
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:39,601
General Turgidson, I find this
very difficult to understand.

284
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:42,432
I was under the impression
I was the only one in authority...

285
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:45,007
...to order the use of
nuclear weapons.

286
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:50,170
That's right, sir. You are
the only person authorized to do so.

287
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:54,546
And although I hate to judge
before all the facts are in...

288
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:58,245
...it's beginning to look like
General Ripper exceeded his authority.

289
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:03,189
It certainly does. Far beyond the point
I would have imagined possible.

290
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,887
Well, perhaps you're forgetting
the provisions of Plan R, sir.

291
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,866
Plan R?

292
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:13,669
Plan R is an emergency war plan...

293
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,363
...in which a lower-echelon
commander may order...

294
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,567
...nuclear retaliation
after a sneak attack...

295
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:23,145
...if the normal chain of command
has been disrupted.

296
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:26,181
You approved it, sir.
You must remember.

297
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,846
Surely you must recall, sir,
when Senator Beaufort...

298
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:34,514
...made that big hassle about
our deterrent lacking credibility.

299
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:39,322
The idea was for Plan R to be
a sort of retaliatory safeguard.

300
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,396
A safeguard?

301
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,728
I admit the human element
seems to have failed us here.

302
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,201
But the idea was to discourage
the Russkies from any hope...

303
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:52,866
...they could knock out Washington,
and yourself, as part of a sneak attack...

304
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:57,139
...and escape retaliation because of
lack of proper command and control.

305
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,909
I assume the planes will return
automatically...

306
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,814
...once they reach their
fail-safe points.

307
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:07,650
No, sir, I'm afraid not. The planes
were holding at their fail-safe points...

308
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,417
...when the go code was issued.

309
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:13,724
Once they fly beyond fail-safe, they do
not require a second order to proceed.

310
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,332
They will continue
until they reach their target.

311
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:20,561
Then why haven't you radioed the
planes, countermanding the go code?

312
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:24,170
I'm afraid we're unable to
communicate with any of the aircraft.

313
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,866
Why?

314
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,909
As you may recall, sir...

315
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:32,606
...one of the provisions
of Plan R provides...

316
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:37,277
...that once the go code
is received...

317
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,686
...the normal SSB radios
in the aircraft...

318
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:43,224
...are switched into
a special coded device...

319
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:46,363
...which I believe is designated
as CRM 114.

320
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:50,864
Now, in order to prevent the enemy
from issuing fake or confusing orders...

321
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:54,869
...CRM 114 is designed
not to receive at all...

322
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,234
...unless the message is proceeded...

323
00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:00,468
...by the correct three-letter
code group prefix.

324
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:05,878
Do you mean to tell me, general, you
will be unable to recall the aircraft?

325
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,917
That's the size of it.
However, we are plowing through...

326
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,884
...every possible three-letter
combination of the code.

327
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:17,153
But since there are
17,000 permutations...

328
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,820
...it's going to take us about two days
to transmit them all.

329
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,626
How soon will planes penetrate
Russian radar cover?

330
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:27,236
- Eighteen minutes from now.
- Are you in contact with Ripper?

331
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:32,172
No, sir. General Ripper sealed off
the base and cut off communications.

332
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,471
- Where did you get this information?
- General Ripper called...

333
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,174
...Strategic Air Command headquarters
shortly after he issued the go code.

334
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,718
I have a portion of the transcript,
if you'd like me to read it.

335
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,787
Read it.

336
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,116
The duty officer asked
General Ripper...

337
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:54,321
...to confirm the fact that he had
issued the go code and he said:

338
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:58,935
"Yes, gentlemen, they are on their way
in and no one can bring them back.

339
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,805
For the sake of our country
and our way of life...

340
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,531
...I suggest you get the rest of SAC
in after them.

341
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:09,544
Otherwise, we will be totally destroyed
by Red retaliation.

342
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:14,913
My boys will give you the best kind
of start: 1400 megatons' worth.

343
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,521
And you sure as hell
won't stop them now.

344
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:21,487
So let's get going.
There's no other choice.

345
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:26,426
God willing, we will prevail
in peace and freedom from fear...

346
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:29,896
...and in true health
through the purity...

347
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,832
...and essence of our natural...

348
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,403
...fluids.

349
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,409
God bless you all."

350
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,107
Then he hung up.

351
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,572
We're still trying to figure out
the meaning of that last phrase.

352
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,983
There's nothing to figure out.
This man is obviously a psychotic.

353
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:56,149
I'd like to hold off judgment on a thing
like that, sir, until all the facts are in.

354
00:29:56,361 --> 00:30:00,821
General Turgidson, when you
instituted the human reliability tests...

355
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:03,296
...you assured me there was
no possibility...

356
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,833
...of such a thing ever occurring.

357
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:10,864
Well, I don't think it's quite fair
to condemn the whole program...

358
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,600
...because of a single slip-up, sir.

359
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,212
I wanna speak to General Ripper
on the telephone.

360
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:17,881
I'm afraid that's impossible.

361
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:21,777
General Turgidson, I am becoming
less and less interested...

362
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:25,478
...in your estimates
of what is possible and impossible.

363
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,023
- General Faceman.
- Yes, sir?

364
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:31,695
Are there any Army units
stationed near Burpelson?

365
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,887
I'll just check, sir.

366
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,164
Hello?

367
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,970
I told you never to call me here.
Don't you know where I am?

368
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,976
Look, baby, I can't talk to you now.

369
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,649
My president needs me.

370
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:56,378
Of course Bucky would rather
be there with you.

371
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,548
Of course it isn't only physical.

372
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:03,090
I deeply respect you
as a human being.

373
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:06,320
Someday I'm gonna make you
Mrs. Buck Turgidson.

374
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,365
Oh, listen, you go back to sleep.

375
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:13,401
Bucky will be back there
just as soon as he can.

376
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:18,133
All right. Listen, sug,
don't forget to say your prayers.

377
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:29,017
Apparently,
the 23rd Airborne Division...

378
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,916
...is stationed seven miles away
at Alvarado.

379
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:36,253
General Faceman, I want them to enter
the base, locate General Ripper...

380
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,691
...and put him
in immediate contact with me.

381
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,387
Yes, sir.

382
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:43,567
Mr. President, if I may advise.

383
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:48,137
Under a condition red, it is standard
procedure that the base be sealed off...

384
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,967
...and the base defended
by base security troops.

385
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:55,475
Any force trying to enter there would
certainly encounter heavy casualties.

386
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,446
General Turgidson, with all due
respect for your defense team...

387
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,449
...my boys can brush them aside
without too much trouble.

388
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:08,187
Mr. President, there are one or two
points I'd like to make, if I may?

389
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,659
Go ahead, general.

390
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:16,758
One: our hopes for recalling
the 843rd bomb wing...

391
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:21,132
...are quickly being reduced
to a very low order of probability.

392
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,069
Two: in less than 15 minutes
from now...

393
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,301
...the Russkies will be making
radar contact with the planes.

394
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,377
Three: when they do...

395
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,414
...they will go absolutely ape and
strike back with everything they've got.

396
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:37,054
Four: if, prior to this time...

397
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:40,691
...we have done nothing to suppress
their retaliatory capabilities...

398
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,417
...we will suffer virtual annihilation.

399
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,493
Now...

400
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,461
...five:

401
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,135
lf, on the other hand...

402
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:58,873
...we immediately launched an attack
on their airfields and missile bases...

403
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:02,410
...we'd stand a good chance of
catching them with their pants down.

404
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:04,774
We've got a 5-to-1
missile superiority.

405
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,816
We could easily assign three missiles
to every target...

406
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:11,580
...and still have an effective reserve
force for any other contingency.

407
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:16,726
Six: an unofficial study which
we undertook of this eventuality...

408
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:21,729
...indicated that we would destroy
90 percent of their nuclear capabilities.

409
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,924
We would therefore prevail...

410
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:28,629
...and suffer only modest civilian
casualties from their remaining force...

411
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,707
...which would be badly damaged
and uncoordinated.

412
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:35,003
General, it is the avowed policy
of our country...

413
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,477
...never to strike first
with nuclear weapons.

414
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:42,244
Well, Mr. President, I'd say Ripper
has already invalidated that policy.

415
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:46,822
That was not an act of national policy.
There are still alternatives open to us.

416
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,520
Mr. President...

417
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,595
...we are rapidly approaching
a moment of truth...

418
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,823
...both for ourselves
and for the life of our nation.

419
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,525
Now, truth is not always
a pleasant thing.

420
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:01,204
But it is necessary now
to make a choice.

421
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,000
To choose between two
admittedly regrettable...

422
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,541
...but nevertheless distinguishable,
postwar environments.

423
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:12,409
One where 20 million people are killed.
The other, 150 million people killed.

424
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,450
You're talking about mass murder,
general, not war.

425
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:19,111
Mr. President, I'm not saying
we wouldn't get our hair mussed.

426
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:23,817
But I do say no more than
10 to 20 million killed, tops.

427
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:25,893
Depending on the breaks.

428
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:29,965
I will not go down in history as the
greatest mass murderer since Hitler.

429
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,534
It might be better
if you were more concerned...

430
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:36,036
...with the American people than
with your image in history books.

431
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,141
General Turgidson, I've heard
quite sufficient from you.

432
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,106
Thank you very much.

433
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,281
Mr. President, they have
the ambassador upstairs.

434
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:47,941
- Oh, good. Any difficulty?
- He's having a fit about the MPs.

435
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:50,484
That can't be helped.
Have him brought here.

436
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,155
Yes, sir.

437
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,723
Is that the Russian ambassador?

438
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,951
Yes, it is, general.

439
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,895
Am I to understand
the Russian ambassador...

440
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,398
...is to be admitted entrance
to the war room?

441
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,400
That is correct.
He is here on my orders.

442
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,502
I don't know exactly how
to put this, sir...

443
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,941
...but are you aware of what
a breach of security that would be?

444
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:20,243
I mean, he'll see everything.
He'll see the big board.

445
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:25,815
That is precisely the idea, general.
That is precisely the idea.

446
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:31,259
Staines, get Premier Kissoff
on the hot line.

447
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:42,261
Survival kit contents check.

448
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:47,172
In them, you will find
one.45-caliber automatic...

449
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:49,744
...two boxes of ammunition...

450
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:53,212
<i>... four days' concentrated</i>
<i>emergency rations...</i>

451
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:56,551
...one drug issue
containing antibiotics...

452
00:35:56,754 --> 00:36:01,020
...morphine, vitamin pills, pep pills...

453
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,893
<i>... sleeping pills, tranquilizer pills...</i>

454
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:09,800
<i>One miniature combination</i>
<i>Russian phrase book and Bible...</i>

455
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:12,793
<i>... $ 100 in rubles...</i>

456
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,097
<i>... $ 100 in gold...</i>

457
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,533
<i>... nine packs of chewing gum...</i>

458
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,937
...one issue of prophylactics...

459
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:23,875
...three lipsticks,
three pair of nylon stockings.

460
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:28,882
Shoot, a fella could have a pretty
good weekend in Vegas with that stuff.

461
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:37,089
- You don't have any fresh fish?
- I'm afraid not, sir.

462
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,354
- Your eggs are fresh?
- Oh, yes, sir.

463
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:43,398
I will have poached eggs. And bring me
some cigars, please. Havana cigars.

464
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:46,866
And that will be all for you, sir?
I'll see to it right away.

465
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:50,131
Try one of these Jamaican cigars,
ambassador. They're good.

466
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:53,674
Thank you, no. I do not support
the work of imperialist stooges.

467
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,346
Oh, only Commie stooges, huh?

468
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,709
Mr. President.

469
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:03,478
You're gonna let that lousy Commie
punk vomit all over us like this?

470
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:04,916
Mr. President?

471
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:08,353
They haven't reached Premier Kissoff.
They don't know where he is...

472
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,494
...and he won't be back
for another two hours.

473
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,060
- Try B86543 Moscow.
- Yes, sir.

474
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,529
You'd never have found him
through his office.

475
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:20,465
Our premier is a man of the people,
but he is also a man, if you follow.

476
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:23,231
- Degenerate, atheistic Commie.
- What did you say?

477
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:26,877
I said, Premier Kissoff is
a degenerate, atheistic Commie!

478
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,876
- Have this ignorant fool...
- I'm sorry!

479
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,949
Mr. President,
I think they're trying the number.

480
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:47,655
Gentlemen, you can't fight in here.
This is the war room!

481
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:50,561
What is going on here?
I demand an explanation.

482
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:54,898
This clumsy fool tried to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

483
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,574
You bet your sweets, Mr. Commie!
Look at this.

484
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:02,144
This lousy Commie rat was taking
pictures with this, of the big board!

485
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,176
Mr. Ambassador!

486
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:08,712
This clumsy fool attempted to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

487
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,649
That's a damn lie!
I saw him with my own eyes.

488
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:15,917
This is outrageous. I have never heard
of such behavior in the war room.

489
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,392
Mr. President, I think
they're getting him on the line.

490
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,421
You gotta hand it to those Commies.

491
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,093
Yeah.

492
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:53,024
Those trucks sure look like
the real thing, don't they?

493
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,027
I wonder where they got them from.

494
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,429
Probably bought them
from the Army as war surplus.

495
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:05,199
Okay, open up at 200 yards.

496
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:06,061
Tell him where you are and that
you'll speak if I say anything untrue...

497
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,433
...but please don't tell him
anything more than that.

498
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:14,237
Alexi? Alexi, please. I beg you.

499
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,069
But I don't have a phone.

500
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:19,272
Give him your phone, Frank.

501
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:50,944
I've done as you asked.
Be careful. I think he is drunk.

502
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:58,353
Hello? Hello, Dimitri?

503
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,251
Listen, I can't hear too well.

504
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:04,155
Do you suppose you could
turn the music down just a little?

505
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:06,158
Oh, that's much better.

506
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,024
Yeah. Yes.

507
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:13,030
Fine. I can hear you now, Dimitri.

508
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:16,604
Clear and plain
and coming through fine.

509
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:21,073
I'm coming through fine too?
Good. Then...

510
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:25,112
Well, then, as you say,
we're both coming through fine. Good.

511
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:29,446
Well, it's good that you're fine
and I'm fine.

512
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,816
I agree with you.
It's great to be fine.

513
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,850
Now then, Dimitri...

514
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:41,623
...you know how we've always talked
about the possibility...

515
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,460
...of something going wrong
with the bomb.

516
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,804
The bomb, Dimitri.

517
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,569
The hydrogen bomb.

518
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,608
Well, now, what happened is...

519
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:58,908
...one of our base commanders,
he had a sort of...

520
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:02,210
Well, he went a little funny
in the head.

521
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:05,388
You know, just a little funny.

522
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:10,049
And he went and did a silly thing.

523
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:14,561
Well, I'll tell you what he did.
He ordered his planes...

524
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,625
...to attack your country.

525
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:21,168
Well, let me finish, Dimitri.

526
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,071
Let me finish, Dimitri.

527
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:27,335
Well, listen, how do you think
I feel about it?

528
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,343
Can you imagine how I feel
about it, Dimitri?

529
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:36,148
Why do you think I'm calling you?
Just to say hello?

530
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,552
Of course I like to speak to you!

531
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:42,157
Of course I like to say hello!

532
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:44,418
Not now, but any time, Dimitri.

533
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:48,530
I'm just calling up to tell you
something terrible has happened.

534
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,599
Of course it's a friendly call.

535
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:56,000
Listen, if it wasn't friendly, you
probably wouldn't have even got it.

536
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:03,006
They will not reach their targets
for at least another hour.

537
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:06,182
I am... I am positive, Dimitri.

538
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,681
I've been all over this
with your ambassador.

539
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:11,252
It is not a trick.

540
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:12,786
Well, I'll tell you.

541
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:16,687
We'd like to give your air staff
a complete rundown on the targets...

542
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:20,022
...the flight plans and the
defensive systems of the planes.

543
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:25,031
Yes, I mean, if we're unable
to recall the planes...

544
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:27,829
...then I'd say that, well...

545
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:33,539
...we're just gonna have to help you
destroy them, Dimitri.

546
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:36,542
I know they're our boys.

547
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:39,215
All right, listen.
Now, who should we call?

548
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:46,182
Who should we call, Dimitri?
Sorry, you faded away there.

549
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:50,560
The People's Central
Air Defense Headquarters.

550
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:52,922
Where is that, Dimitri?

551
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,189
In Omsk. Right.

552
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,460
Yes.

553
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:00,501
Oh, you'll call them first, will you?

554
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:04,932
Do you happen to have
the phone number on you, Dimitri?

555
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:09,805
What? I see.
Just ask for Omsk information.

556
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:15,949
I'm sorry too, Dimitri.
I'm very sorry.

557
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,919
All right, you're sorrier than I am.
But I am sorry as well.

558
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:24,420
I am as sorry as you are, Dimitri.

559
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:26,459
Don't say that you're more sorry...

560
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,497
...because I'm capable of being
just as sorry as you are.

561
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,033
So we're both sorry, all right?
All right.

562
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:38,536
Yes, he's right here. Yes, he wants
to talk to you. Just a second.

563
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,316
What?

564
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:14,269
What? What is it? What?

565
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:17,447
The fools. The mad fools.

566
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,616
What's happened?

567
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:23,343
The doomsday machine.

568
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,022
The doom...? The doomsday machine?
What is that?

569
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:31,457
A device which will destroy
all human and animal life on Earth.

570
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,857
All human and animal life?

571
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:51,005
- Mandrake?
- Yes, Jack?

572
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:55,641
Have you ever seen a Commie
drink a glass of water?

573
00:45:55,853 --> 00:46:00,347
Well, no, I can't say I have, Jack.

574
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:06,359
Vodka. That's what they drink,
isn't it? Never water.

575
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:10,829
Well, I believe that's
what they drink, Jack, yes.

576
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:14,367
On no account will a Commie
ever drink water...

577
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:16,835
...and not without good reason.

578
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,501
Oh, yes.

579
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:26,672
I can't quite see
what you're getting at, Jack.

580
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:30,581
Water.
That's what I'm getting at, water.

581
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:35,058
Mandrake, water is the source
of all life.

582
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:40,119
Seven-tenths of this Earth's surface
is water.

583
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,662
Why, do you realize that...

584
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:46,669
...70 percent of you is water?

585
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,167
Good Lord.

586
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:53,366
And as human beings,
you and I need fresh, pure water...

587
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:57,035
...to replenish
our precious bodily fluids.

588
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:59,909
- You beginning to understand?
- Yes.

589
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,251
Mandrake...

590
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:12,456
Mandrake, have you never wondered
why I drink only distilled water...

591
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:16,929
...or rainwater,
and only pure grain alcohol?

592
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:20,365
Well, it did occur to me, Jack, yes.

593
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:26,169
Have you ever heard of a thing called
fluoridation? Fluoridation of water?

594
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:30,274
Yes, I have heard of that, Jack, yes.
Yes.

595
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,277
Well, do you know what it is?

596
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:35,474
No. No, I don't know what it is, no.

597
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:39,486
Do you realize that fluoridation...

598
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,386
...is the most
monstrously conceived...

599
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:45,994
...and dangerous Communist plot
we have ever had to face?

600
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,526
Two can play at that game, soldier.

601
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:01,538
That's nice shooting, soldier!

602
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:28,004
Mandrake, come here.

603
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,100
You calling me, Jack?

604
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,673
Come over here
and help me with this belt.

605
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,647
I haven't had
very much experience...

606
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,511
...you know,
with those sort of machines, Jack...

607
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:45,176
...I've only ever pressed a button
in my old Spitfire.

608
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:49,291
In the name of Her Majesty and the
Continental Congress, feed me the belt.

609
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:53,930
Jack, I'd love to come,
but what's happened, you see...
