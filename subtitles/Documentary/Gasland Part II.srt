PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:
We have a supply of natural gas

2
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:05,065
that can last America
nearly 100 years...

3
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:06,533
[APPLAUSE]

4
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,002
And my administration will take
every possible action

5
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:10,837
to safely develop this energy.

6
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,872
The development of natural gas
will create jobs

7
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,476
and power trucks and factories
that are cleaner and cheaper,

8
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:19,446
where we develop a hundred-year
supply of natural gas

9
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,781
that's right beneath our feet.

10
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,718
BILL CLINTON: The boom
in oil and gas production

11
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:29,022
has driven oil imports
to a near-20-year low

12
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,524
and natural gas production
to an all-time high.

13
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:35,795
HILARY CLINTON: The United States
will promote the use of shale gas.

14
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:40,033
Now I know that, in some places,
is controversial.

15
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,037
PAUL RYAN: With 21st-century
drilling technology,

16
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,540
you can get it out of the ground
in a very safe and secure way.

17
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,880
MITT ROMNEY: I don't recall hearing
about water being on fire.

18
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:55,849
We will have
North American energy.

19
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,650
We're going to be independent.

20

Thank you.
Thank you very much.

Journalists would call up
the FAA to clear their flights,

And I don't know why.
Maybe because it was a Sunday.

A chemical that had been
banned in Britain

00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,839

I was born, 1972.

159
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:43,876
It was my father's dream,
and my mom filled it with furniture.

160
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,879
He told my mother, "I want
to build a house of love."

of love for you."

162
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,551
He ended up building it
out of a $2.00 diagram

163
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,787
out of "Popular Mechanics."

164

For my father...

in Russia, fleeing the Nazis;

166
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:05,598
and for my mother, the child of a poor Italian
immigrant family from New York City...

167
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:09,168
on 19.5 acres, just a mile
from the Delaware,

168

We learned that our land was
on top of a formation

175
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,219
called the Marcellus Shale,
and that the Marcellus Shale

176
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,722
was the "Saudi Arabia"
of natural gas.

177

We could lease our land
to the natural gas companies.

178

America is in a fracking frenzy.

201
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:26,946
Hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking,"
is a method of gas extraction

202
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:30,449
drilling deep down thousands
of feet to a shale formation

203
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,619
and then forcing down the well
millions of gallons of water

laced with toxic chemicals
at such intense pressures

205
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:40,493
that it created fractures
in the rock and freed up the gas.

But you never just drill
one well in a shale play,

you drill thousands,

And because fracking explicitly is
exempt from the Safe Drinking Water Act,

215
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:07,186
the industry doesn't have to tell the

for the gas drilling industry.

311
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,456
Thousands of wells drilled...

312
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:13,625
thousands of reported
violations.

313
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,063
The "New York Times"
investigated and found that

314
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,566
wastewater from drilling was
being inadequately treated

315
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,701
and dumped back
into water supplies

316
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,736
all over Pennsylvania,

317
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,239
and with this much evidence
bubbling up across the state,

318
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,341
even the pro-drilling
Rendell administration

319
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,376
had to take action.

320
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,345
DEP issued violations to Cabot

321
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,181
and stopped them from drilling
in a 9-square-mile radius,

322
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,218
but no permanent solution
for residents' water contamination

323
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,652
had been proposed.

324
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:44,656
What the Dimock families
really wanted was permanent public water,

325
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,193
and someone who could
make it happen finally showed up to listen.

326
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,396
MAN, VOICE-OVER: Lance Simmens.

327
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,233
I was special assistant
to Governor Ed Rendell

328
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,235
for Intergovernmental Affairs.

329
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,170
My primary responsibility

330
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:01,206
was to make sure
that the Governor knew, on the ground,

331
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,208
what was going on
in local communities.

332
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:07,646
There was something obviously
drastically wrong with this picture.

333
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,282
It's like, you know,
3 apples and a nail.

334
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,285
And I said point-blank
to the Governor,

335
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,288
who was sitting
within about 18 inches

336
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,758
from me in a meeting
one day, I said,

337
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:24,263
"We have got to get the people
of Dimock clean water.

338
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:28,800
"This is the United States
of America, and we need to have this

339
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:33,305
as a primary right for all
of our citizens."

340
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:37,676
He agreed and he asked me
what we should do about it.

341
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,712
And I said, "Let's connect

342
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,715
to a public water supply."

343
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,951
FOX, VOICE-OVER: After Lance
Simmens got to the governor,

344
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,253
it felt like
a new day in Dimock.

345
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,155
Pushed by a new policy,

346
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,824
Department of Environmental
Protection Secretary John Hanger

347
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,261
releases videotapes
of Dimock wells.

348
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,598
We have video
of gas bubbling at those gas wells.

349
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,134
FOX, VOICE-OVER:
The DEP revealed that Dimock wells

350
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,304
had inadequate cement,
cracked cement, or no cement.

351
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,606
The crucial part of the well
that's supposed to keep gas

352
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,509
from migrating
into aquifers had failed,

353
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,978
showing scientifically
that Cabot Oil & Gas

354
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,881
had contaminated
Dimock's water with methane.

355
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,450
[Drilling equipment clanging]

356
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:22,487
But PA DEP had the videos
for a year and a half,

357
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:25,090
so John Hanger, Secretary
of the Department, was in

358
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:29,294
the uncomfortable position of calling his
own administration's policy inadequate,

359
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,597
while at the same time
playing the hero.

360
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,566
HANGER: We've had people
here in Pennsylvania

361
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,471
without safe
drinking water for close to two years.

362
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:43,208
That is totally,
totally unacceptable.

363
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,544
FOX, VOICE-OVER:
The new policy was startling,

364
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,579
although it was just
common sense.

365
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,082
Pennsylvania would build
a water line to Dimock

366
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,084
from Montrose, 7 miles away...

367
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,986
the nearest municipal
water supply...

368
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,588
and the state would sue
Cabot Oil & Gas

369
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,725
for the cost... $12 million.

370
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,297
Protestors in the crowd
lifted signs of other towns in Pennsylvania

371
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,200
that had similar problems,
saying, "We, too, need a water line,"

372
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:13,505
insisting that the Dimock
water line be a precedent for the state.

373
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:20,178
Coming home from Dimock,
my own situation was escalating.

374
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:24,316
The only place
they hadn't managed to drill

375
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:27,352
in Pennsylvania was
the Delaware River Basin.

376
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,855
It's the border
with New York State,

377
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:33,492
and there are hundreds
of streams, tributaries

378
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,061
to form that mighty river.

379
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,430
15 million people get
their drinking water

380
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,432
out of the Delaware
River Basin...

381
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,835
New York City, Philadelphia,
and southern New Jersey.

382
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:47,506
A lot depends on nothing
ever happening up here.

383
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,943
There's an old adage:

384
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,414
"You can't ever step in
the same stream twice."

385
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:58,450
And from growing up running up and
down a trout stream connecting

386
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,887
to the Delaware River, it's
fairly obvious how that's true.

387
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,724
Every year, the snow melt
carves out a slightly new bank.

388
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:08,927
Every year,
the spring thaw rushes in,

389
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,263
takes down a few trees.

390
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:13,632
Every year, a new beach head,

391
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,435
a place where a swimming hole
is slightly deeper.

392
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,970
And, depending on the rainfall
and the weather,

393
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,273
there could be
a rushing current,

394
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:24,810
or a boulder revealed
by a drought that you've never seen before.

395
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:30,315
But in this case,
something besides nature had changed this.

396
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,417
Pro-drilling landowners
in my county

397
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,353
had leased over 80,000 acres.

398
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:38,390
The stream's always been my property
line, and now, just across from me,

399
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:41,126
I could wake up and see off
my front porch every day

400
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,663
the other side of the stream
was now leased.

401
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,631
If drilling began,

402
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:50,102
that side would be controlled
by the gas industry.

403
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,105
Now it didn't matter
that my family never signed.

404
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:56,274
I was completely surrounded,
and if they drilled,

405
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:59,077
you'd never step in
the same stream again.

406
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,347
The River Basin is controlled
by a 5-member body...

407
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,016
4 governors of the states
that border the river

408
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,586
and a representative
from the president...

409
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,789
and New York State had
been paying attention to what was going on

410
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,924
in Pennsylvania and
throughout the country.

411
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:17,028
The New York legislature passed a one-year
moratorium on drilling throughout New York,

412
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,197
and the federal government
was also taking a look.

413
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,700
Prompted by Maurice Hinchey,
congressman from New York,

414
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,203
the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency begins a two-year study

415
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,706
of the effects of hydraulic
fracturing on groundwater,

416
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:31,076
and EPA Administrator
Lisa Jackson declares

417
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:34,846
that if states are falling
down on the job enforcing regulations,

418
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,015
then the federal government
will step in.

419
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,818
One such failed state
was Wyoming,

420
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:43,355
and one such town was
a tiny little place called Pavillion.

421
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:46,858
My backyard, New York,
and national policy tied

422
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,628
to tiny little places
like Pavillion.

423
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,168
FOX, VOICE-OVER:
EPA moved in and did

424
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,804
a full groundwater study,
testing for hundreds of chemicals

425
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,139
related to gas drilling
and the gas itself.

426

MAN: This is the ultimate
detective novel.

427

I mean, these people are

and they are doing an extraordinary job,

429
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:14,820
but they are absolutely
moving mountains to get this done.

FOX, VOICE-OVER: Most people
in the west don't own their mineral rights,

so when the gas company showed up in
Pavillion, drilling over a hundred wells,

432
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,631
landowners had no control
over where wells were drilled

in the middle of the field,
we have to irrigate around it.

FOX, VOICE-OVER:
On August 31, 2010,

denied responsibility,

443
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:58,196
and Wyoming's governor was
openly hostile towards the EPA.

444
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,233
Because of the gas industry's exemption
to the Safe Drinking Water Act,

445
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:04,269
they're not required to report
which chemicals they're using.

914
00:49:57,427 --> 00:50:01,832
and biogenic gas,
which is generated from, uh,

915
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:04,234
I would say, neo... uh...

Neo... uh... ha ha ha!

What is water?

918
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,708
Casing needs to be set
to protect fresh water,

919
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:15,979
and that's not the term, 'cause "fresh water"
is another definition that we don't have

920
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,215
unless it comes out
of this bottle.

FOX, VOICE-OVER: In the end,
he said absolutely nothing

925
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:32,396
about what actually happened
to contaminate the aquifer.

926
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:36,767
It was a dog-and-pony show hiding behind
a smokescreen inside a hall of mirrors.

CABOT EXPERT: So, for those of
you that are looking for jobs...

928
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:42,105
not me because I'm too old...
you're looking at an industry

929
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,274
that's going to be around here
for a hundred years.

930
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:45,909
FOX, VOICE-OVER:
Then it happened.

931
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:48,278
Republican Attorney General
Tom Corbett

932
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,347
was elected Governor
of Pennsylvania.

933
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,983
Cue the saddest newscaster
in history.

934
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:56,486
Well, it turns out there will
not be a pipeline connecting

935
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,390
Dimock, Pennsylvania to the
Montrose Municipal Water System.

936
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:04,661
That word comes from the PA Department
of Environmental Protection,

937
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:08,331
which has dropped its plan
to force Cabot Oil & Gas

938
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:11,802
to pay for the nearly
$12 million project.

939
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:15,639
FOX, VOICE-OVER: Dimock residents and Lance
Simmens had fought hard for a policy

940
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:18,442
that should have been
a precedent for the rest of the state:

941
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:19,976
Contaminate a township's water,

942
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:23,146
and you're going to have
to pay for permanent public replacement.

943
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,148
FOX: Was it your hope

944
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:27,217
that would have become
a standard?

945
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,185
Absolutely.

946
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:30,687
I thought that it would have

947
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,723
a long-lasting
and pervasive effect.

948
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,660
FOX, VOICE-OVER: Unfortunately,
didn't work out that way.

949
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:40,197
Governor Ed Rendell and John Hanger of the
Department of Environmental Protection

950
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:44,534
made a deal, negotiating without the
participation of the Dimock families.

951
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:49,739
Cabot Oil & Gas would pay each of the
residents twice the value of their homes.

952
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:53,243
In other words, the state
and the gas companies

953
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:56,913
made a deal to tell
the people of Dimock to move.

954
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,417
Not surprisingly, the families
rejected the compromise.

955
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,686
The water line
would be canceled;

956
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:06,289
no precedent for water
replacement would be set.

957
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:08,959
FOX: So you're upset with
the way the situation was handled?

958
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:13,797
I am not happy with the fact that
that water line was not built.

959
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,499
FOX, VOICE-OVER:
During the same period of time,

960
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,300
3 of Ed Rendell's top aides,

961
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:19,102
including his
Executive Deputy Chief

962
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,438
of Staff, went to work
for the gas industry.

963
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,373
DEP Secretary John Hanger joined

964
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,876
a law firm and lobbying
organization that's a member

965
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:28,545
of the Marcellus Shale
Coalition and represents

966
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:31,281
Pennsylvania's Independent Oil
and Gas Association.

967
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:34,217
And Governor Ed Rendell himself
joined a private equity firm

968
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,353
with interests in
the natural gas industry,

969
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:40,524
going on to advocate publicly for drilling
without disclosing his industry ties.

970
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:45,595
All this switching sides led the public
accountability initiative to issue a report,

971
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:50,133
concluded that the lines between government and
industry had been blurred to a corrupting effect

972
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,869
and that the public bodies
charged with regulating industry

973
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:54,838
instead had become
captured by it.

974
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:57,174
SIMMENS: You know,
the revolving door

975
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:00,277
between regulators
and the regulated industries

976
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,812
is as old as bureaucracy itself.

977
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:06,349
I would never
underestimate the power

978
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:09,319
to make changes

979
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,822
in a system that is

980
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:17,460
as influenced as it is
by the power of money.

981
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:21,998
Does that mean that I
could never... I would never have foreseen

982
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:27,604
forces upending it,
delaying it, canceling it?

983
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:30,540
Nope, I've come to accept that

984
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:35,045
as a fact of life in this...

985
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:40,016
dysfunctional political system

986
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,520
that is not only true
in Pennsylvania,

987
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:47,557
but, I think,
on a much larger scale

988
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:50,527
throughout the country.

989
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,329
Is it horribly unsafe?

990
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:53,830
Is that what this fracking is?

991
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:57,867
I do not know of one well,
one... they always say

992
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,270
it contaminates the aquifer.

993
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:02,606
I've never seen that happen.

994
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,941
I'm sure there are
people, though, who would say, "I have.

00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:08,144
And it's been on my land
and I've seen the toxicity."

1043
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:34,284
You know I'll get
a phone call in a few minutes,

1044
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:37,220
asking why I was
up here with a guy with a camera.

1045
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:40,190
We were told,
point-blank, that

1046
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:44,394
the word "freshwater"
does not mean what you think it means.

1047
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:48,865
"Freshwater" means
"fresh to this site."

1048
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:51,868
Every bit of water
that will be coming here

1049
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:54,871
and used in the frack tanks

1050
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:57,907
has already been used
at a different site,

1051
00:57:57,941 --> 00:57:59,876
therefore, it's "fresh" to us.

1052
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:02,912
So my question was,
"Could we just call it fresh enough water?"

1053
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:05,281
And the answer was,
"Yes."

1054
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,851
I also asked, point-blank, "Does
it have chemicals in it?"

1055
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:10,353
And the answer was,
"Yes."

1056
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:12,856
We have methane
in our water already

1057
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,858
that we did not have before.

1058
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:17,360
Our pre-drill test
proved that our water

1059
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:20,563
was pristine beyond
anybody's standards.

1060
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:23,967
They will tell you
point blank there is no way

1061
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,135
that frack fluid
will migrate. Right.

it's not a question
of if it can migrate;

1065
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:35,612
it's a question of when
it will migrate.

1066
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:39,916
Every single one
of these gas-well guys that's come here

1067
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:44,020
has said,
"Wow, you guys have a really nice place."

1068
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:45,922
And we say,

1069
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:49,626
"Thank you,
but you mean we had a really nice place."

1070
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:52,428
The realtor told us
it's worth zero dollars and zero cents.

1071
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:55,465
Tell me about
these water tanks. So...

1072
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:58,001
on the day that Shell found out,

1073
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:01,004
they instantly brought
these water buffaloes.

1074
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:03,139
This is what we call
"blue water."

1075
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:05,341
I mean, that's my term
for it... "blue water." It's blue.

1076
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,810
Because it's blue. Ha!
We don't drink it.

1077
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:10,313
Right.
We drink bottled water.

1078
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:12,815
We can't use it
for our animals 'cause it...

1079
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:15,385
I don't trust this.
I don't know what this is.

1080
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:18,388
The dogs have been
drinking Nestle brand water.

1081
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:20,356
It says "Pure Life."

1082
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,358
"Enhanced with minerals
for taste," and then

1083
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,294
there are these happy
stick-figure people here

1084
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:28,331
who are about to get swept away by
a tsunami of "Pure Life." Ha ha!

1085
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:31,100
Well, I was thinking
about the 5 cents in Oregon.

1086
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:34,604
If I could get those
empty water bottles 3,000 miles away,

1087
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:36,539
I could get 5 cents out
of each one of those.

1088
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:40,176
They don't ask
for those bottles back.

1089
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:44,447
This is what
the chickens drink now.

1090
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,484
I don't know any other chickens in Tioga County,
Pennsylvania, that drink bottled water.

1091
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:51,521
Cluck, cluck, cluck.
Anybody want to say hi?

1092
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:54,457
FOX, VOICE-OVER: After the Gee family reported
they could light their water on fire,

1093
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:58,461
Shell tried several times
to squeeze, or fix the cement job.

1094
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:01,531
All the while, the gas industry
in public continued

1095
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:04,400
to deny any instances
of water contamination.

1096
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,835
This just didn't make sense.

1097
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:08,871
Everywhere I had gone, whether
it was Texas or PA

1098
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:11,341
or Colorado, there were
the same problems.

1099
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:15,378
I'd seen all this on the surface, but what
was actually happening under the ground?

Please welcome Tom Ridge.

1102
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:21,517
You are the former Governor

the Keystone State,
first Secretary of Homeland Security.

Now, you're a lobbyist for
the natural gas industry.

1106
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:33,096
We've all seen the footage
of flaming water.

1107
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:35,898
Whoa!

1108
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:39,569
Is that really
happening to people's water supply, sir?

1109
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:41,537
Out here is the rock.

1110
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:43,606
We're looking in
a cross section of a well

1111
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,074
that's being drilled

1112
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:46,709
because, ultimately,
you want your gas

1113
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:48,277
to come up the steel pipe.

1114
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:51,247
That inch, right there,
this is cement.

1115
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,784
And what you don't want
is for that cement to fail...

1116
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:57,086
Mm-hmm.
or to be absent,

1117
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,423
to crack, to corrode,
to crumble, to disappear.

1118
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:05,628
If what's down there
can get into this annulus...

1119
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:10,299
Right.
then it can migrate.

1120
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,568
Yes, it is happening
to some water supplies,

1121
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:14,804
and it has absolutely
nothing to do with hydraulic fracting.

1122
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:17,240
Methane gas is
naturally occurring.

1123
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:20,777
They've had methane gas... I'm speaking as
a governor... in some of our water wells

1124
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:25,782
in Pennsylvania long before any wells,
frack wells, were located next to them.

1125
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:28,584
Those are phenomena that
are very well known,

1126
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:31,754
for as long as we've
been drilling wells, encasing them.

1127
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:34,991
Naturally occurring
methane gas often ends up in water wells,

1128
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,493
but there has not been
a single proven instance

1129
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,829
where it has been related
to hydraulic fracking.

1130
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,799
So now the shallow gas goes
into an open annulus,

1131
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:45,334
pressurizes the annulus,
gas migrates into an underground

1132
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,503
source of drinking water,
somebody's water well.

1133
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:53,142
In my field, there are only
3 things that are certain:

1134
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:56,813
death, taxes, and fracture.

1135
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:59,115
FOX, VOICE-OVER:
Meet Professor Tony Ingraffea...

1136
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:00,983
professor of engineering
at Cornell;

1137
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:03,920
a two-time winner of the
National Research Council Award

1138
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:05,822
for rock mechanics research;

1139
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:08,291
co-winner of a NASA Group
Achievement Award;

1140
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:12,195
a former researcher for Schlumberger, the
number-one fracking company in the world,

1141
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,596
and for the Gas
Research Institute;

1142
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:16,466
proud Sicilian;
accomplished turkey hunter;

1143
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:20,036
and in 2011, one of "TIME"
Magazine's People Who Mattered.

1144
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:23,673
But I like to think of him
as the godfather of cement.

1145
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:28,211
Hundreds of thousands of on-shore wells
and thousands of off-shore wells,

1146
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:31,714
there's a probability
of maybe one in 20

1147
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:35,218
that a cement job will
fail immediately.

1148
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,754
FOX: One in 20?
One in 20.

1149
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:38,721
So 5%.

1150
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,690
5% of all wells
immediately will show

1151
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:44,227
a failure of a cement job,
and there will be methane migration.

1152
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,729
Because that means
that this annulus, the area

1153
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:50,133
between the casing and the rock,

1154
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:52,702
is now open from below to above.

1155
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:56,239
You now have a migration
pathway so that anything that's down there

1156
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:59,742
in the way of salts,
heavy metals,

1157
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:03,045
other deleterious things
that were stored in the rock,

1158
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:06,916
now have a pathway and a vector and
something to carry them upwards.

1159
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:10,987
I'm using the round number of a hundred
thousand Marcellus wells... FOX: Right.

1160
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:13,956
In Pennsylvania alone, OK?
Right.

1161
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:18,461
If one out of 20 is going
to immediately show a cement failure,

1162
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:21,030
now we're talking 5,000 wells.

1163
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:24,033
If that one water well
is going bad, it means that aquifer...

1164
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:27,069
as what happened in Dimock, it's the one aquifer
that was servicing all those water wells.

1165
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:28,704
9 square miles.
Yeah.

1166
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:31,007
FOX, VOICE-OVER: Professor
Ingraffea was basically telling me

1167
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:35,044
that a gas well is a long, steel pipe
surrounded by an inch of cement,

1168
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:37,180
and that that cement
cracks often.

1169
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:41,184
But there's one part of a gas well that
he didn't mention... the PR department.

1170
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:46,222
So my job, and I do have a paid job
as a consultant with the industry,

1171
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:50,059
is to make sure, as Pennsylvania, that
we take advantage of the resources.

1172
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:53,729
FOX, VOICE-OVER: I needed to talk to an
expert in that part of the operation.

1173
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:56,632
Naomi Oreskes, author of
the book "Merchants of Doubt,"

1174
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,601
traced disinformation campaigns

1175
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:03,072
from big tobacco all the way up
to climate change.

1176
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:06,742
If we say, you know,
"Oh, yes, oil and gas come out of people's

1177
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:09,245
taps naturally,"
you know, a lot of people just don't know.

1178
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:12,715
They think, "Oh, really? Is that true?
You know... Oh, well, I have heard

1179
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:16,085
"people say that
in Santa Barbara the tap water smells bad,

1180
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:19,455
you know, so maybe it's true."
OK, now we have a debate, right?

1181
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:22,458
An ordinary person
who doesn't know what to think doesn't need

1182
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:26,295
to think that I'm right; they just
need to think that there's a debate,

1183
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:28,865
because so long as there's a
debate, then there's an argument

1184
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:30,333
for staving off regulation.

1185

FOX, VOICE-OVER: In the fifties,
Hill + Knowlton, PR firm,

that tobacco caused
lung cancer...

1188
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:41,444
misinformation
and supporting bogus science

1189
01:04:41,477 --> 01:04:43,012

1190
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,547
the legitimate science.

America's Natural Gas Alliance

01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,602
we have the same PR firm
that actually invented...

John Hill was
the originator of this whole strategy,

that they knew that nicotine was addictive

1204
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:27,523
and tobacco was harmful,
the gas industry also has memos

1205
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:29,692
that show they've known
all along.

Some of them, in fact,
have been published.

of completely fixing

1210
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,038
or preventing the problem.

1211
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:43,906
Number One, from
Southwestern Energy.

1212
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,575
The diagram clearly shows
that the gas well has

1213
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:49,612
a cement barrier around the
sides of it that prevents gas

1214
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:52,581
from lower layers migrating
upwards into aquifers.

1215
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:55,584
But this isn't a PowerPoint
about drilling wells.

1216
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:58,721
This is a PowerPoint about how
cement and casings fail

1217
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:02,358
and allow gas or other
substances to migrate into aquifers.

1218
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:05,861
It's one of their own documents
about how cement fails.

1219
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:08,164
Number Two comes
from Schlumberger...

1220
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:11,000
"Oilfield Review,"
published in 2003...

1221
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:13,269
that showed that sustained
casing pressure,

1222
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:16,339
i.e. cement failure, occurs
at alarming rates.

1223
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:19,942
Their own documents showed
that cement and casings failed

1224
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:23,346
in 5% of wells drilled
immediately upon drilling

1225
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:26,882
and that the failure rate
increased over time;

1226
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:31,854
that over a 30-year period,
50% of wells failed.

1227
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:33,122
Number 3.

1228
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:36,092
This report... leaked out of
a gas industry conference

1229
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:38,394
from Archer,
a well services company...

1230
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:41,430
shows enormous rates of leakage
in the Gulf of Mexico

1231
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:44,433
and the North Sea, and
high rates of what they call

1232
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:46,168
"uncontrolled discharge."

1233
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:47,703
And this PowerPoint slide

1234
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:49,772
from the Society
of Petroleum Engineers

1235
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:53,209
shows that 1.8 million wells
exist in the world

1236
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:55,745
and that 35% of them
are leaking.

1237
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:59,615
It also states that the industry plans
to drill more wells in the next decade

1238
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:01,884
than have been drilled in
the last hundred years.

1239
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:05,421
Recent Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection statistics

1240
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:07,723
back up Schlumberger's
initial findings.

1241
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:11,227
Well leakage was
between 6% and 8.9%

1242
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:15,231
for newly installed wells...
gas migrating into aquifers.

1243
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:18,434
The Pennsylvania Department
of Conservation and Natural Resources

1244
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:22,938
predicts that there will be 180,000 new
gas wells drilled in Pennsylvania.

1245
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:25,941
If 50% of them go bad
over 30 years,

1246
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:28,110
that's 90,000 leaking gas wells.

1247
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:30,112
It's safe to say
there's the potential

1248
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:31,981
for contaminating
the entire state.

1249
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:34,483
Can we ever predict
everything exactly? No.

1250
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:38,988
But we're in much better shape
now than we were generations ago

1251
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:43,893
of predicting probabilistically
the range of events that we expect to see.

1252
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:45,428
Unconventional gas development...

1253
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,963
it ain't your
grandmother's gas well.

1254
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:50,466
Longer wells, higher pressures,

1255
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:52,435
higher volumes of frack fluids,

1256
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:54,603
more wells per pad.

1257
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:57,640
We should expect higher risk,
higher accident rate,

1258
01:07:57,673 --> 01:07:59,575
and that's what we're seeing.

FOX, VOICE-OVER:
Australia wasn't alone.

In April 2010,
the State Department,

1303
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:47,309
under Secretary Hillary Clinton
and the Obama administration,

1304
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:50,579
started the Global
Shale Gas Initiative,

1305
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:53,148
charting shale plays
in over 30 countries

1306
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:55,618
and pledging a government-

around the world.

01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:06,354
Well, the hypothesis here is
shale gas is better for global warming

1512
01:22:06,388 --> 01:22:09,324
than other fossil fuels and it's
a good transitional fuel.

1513
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:12,460
So we tested that,
and the answer is, well, no, it's not.

1514
01:22:12,494 --> 01:22:15,463
The White House has
clearly bought into this idea

1515
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:18,633
that natural gas is part
of the solution

off of fossil fuels.

I don't think they did that
with good science.

1518
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:27,475

that somewhere between

1519
01:22:27,509 --> 01:22:32,113
3.6% and 7.9% of the total
amount of gas produced

to the atmosphere as methane.

1521
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:38,420
There's a continual leakage at
the well head, there's leakage

1522
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:40,722
from the storage
and processing facilities,

1523

purposeful venting,
also accidental leaks.

systems and the distribution systems

1525

there's leakage in all of those.

When you burn natural gas,
you get about half as much,

important greenhouse gas,

1531
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:03,545

goes back and forth

year by year.

1542

other bowl over here,

and you'll have a dramatically
different planet and that,

1545
01:23:38,446 --> 01:23:40,281
once you've switched
from this stable regime

1546

no easy way to get back.

01:29:12,914 --> 01:29:15,883
has been propelled by two
Supreme Court decisions:

1659
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:18,886
"Buckley vs. Valeo,"
and the Citizens United case.

1660
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:23,391
That has given corporations
the chance to influence

1661
01:29:23,424 --> 01:29:26,728
elections of members
of Congress directly.

1662
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:28,963
With the new majority
that is here,

1663
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:31,299
is that their decisions
have been informed.

1664
01:29:31,332 --> 01:29:33,801
It doesn't have to be
that the oil and gas people

1665
01:29:33,835 --> 01:29:37,872
are sitting in the audience
or have been visiting.

1666
01:29:37,905 --> 01:29:39,974
The mind is set.

1667
01:29:40,007 --> 01:29:42,076
I think that's the concern,
is about whether or not

1668
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:46,381
contributions are
influencing public policy

1669
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:50,318
and where they kind of disconnect
selected officials from common sense.

1670
01:29:50,351 --> 01:29:52,787
There have been periods
of our history

1671
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:55,790
when our political system has
been entirely controlled

1672
01:29:55,823 --> 01:29:59,961
by a tiny economic elite who really just
run the country for their own benefit.

1673
01:29:59,994 --> 01:30:02,964
Exxon could write a check...
I'm not saying they would...

1674
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:05,266
for a billion dollars
if they wanted to.

1675
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:08,703
There's no limit.
And there's no reporting.

1676
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:11,005
They can do that without
the same disclosures

1677
01:30:11,038 --> 01:30:13,307
that are required
for other contributors,

1678
01:30:13,341 --> 01:30:15,943
and they can do that
in a way that gives you

1679
01:30:15,977 --> 01:30:18,980
little opportunity to be
able to defend yourself. FOX: Mm-hmm.

1680
01:30:19,013 --> 01:30:21,449
That puts, I think,
all of us at risk.

1681
01:30:21,482 --> 01:30:26,154
FOX, VOICE-OVER: ExxonMobil didn't write
a billion-dollar check in one election,

1682
01:30:26,187 --> 01:30:30,158
but the fossil fuel industries
combined contributed $150 million

1683
01:30:30,191 --> 01:30:34,729
to the 2012 election, and Common Cause
tracked lobbying expenditures...

1684
01:30:34,762 --> 01:30:38,232
$747 million to gain and keep

1685
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:41,269
the exemption to the Safe
Drinking Water Act, known as

1686
01:30:41,302 --> 01:30:43,771
"the Halliburton loophole
for hydraulic fracturing."

1687
01:30:43,805 --> 01:30:47,542
Considering that's just one election
and one exemption to one law,

1688
01:30:47,575 --> 01:30:50,178
a billion dollars is
actually the low end.

1689
01:30:50,211 --> 01:30:52,613
OK, we got it.
Government's bought off.

1690
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:56,384
Time to go home.
Thank you. Roll credits.

1691
01:30:57,785 --> 01:31:00,621
It just didn't seem that simple.

1692
01:31:00,655 --> 01:31:04,459
There had to be something else going on
under the surface that I couldn't see.

1693
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:06,928
The price of gas in Asia

1694
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:09,030
right now, depending
on the contract,

1695
01:31:09,063 --> 01:31:11,032
can be as much as $16,

1696
01:31:11,065 --> 01:31:14,001
whereas it's $2.50 here.

1697
01:31:14,035 --> 01:31:17,472
So, if you're in the business
to extract hydrocarbons,

1698
01:31:17,505 --> 01:31:20,741
you're going to look for the customer
that's going to pay you the most money.

1699
01:31:20,775 --> 01:31:23,511
And that is most decidedly Asia
at the moment, and Europe.

1700
01:31:23,544 --> 01:31:26,314
Europe's paying about, what,
$9.50, $10, something like that.

1701
01:31:26,347 --> 01:31:28,282
FOX, VOICE-OVER:
As of December 5, 2012,

1702
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:30,251
the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission

1703
01:31:30,284 --> 01:31:33,221
had received over
20 applications to build

1704
01:31:33,254 --> 01:31:35,423
liquefied natural gas ports

1705
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:37,492
to ship American gas overseas.

1706
01:31:37,525 --> 01:31:41,796
The EIA... Energy Information Administration...
reported that, as a result of export,

1707
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:45,633
domestic natural gas prices
would rise by more than 50%,

1708
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:48,135
and that developing
20 LNG ports...

1709
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:50,605
at costs of billions
of dollars each...

1710
01:31:50,638 --> 01:31:54,475
made fracking the U.S. at a large
scale a foregone conclusion.

1711
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:58,145
And despite the nationwide shift
towards exporting gas,

1712
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:01,883
the DOE refused to look at
environmental impacts from LNG.

1713
01:32:01,916 --> 01:32:03,384
FOX: So what is
happening here?

1714
01:32:03,417 --> 01:32:06,454
Well, I think there's
a longer-term thing going on with this.

1715
01:32:06,487 --> 01:32:10,024
I personally think
that this is tied to crude oil prices.

1716
01:32:10,057 --> 01:32:13,060
This populist argument
that industries used about, you know,

1717
01:32:13,094 --> 01:32:16,097
"American gas, by Americans,
for Americans,"

1718
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:19,066
while, in the background,
they're working very hard

1719
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:22,036
to be able to export this gas
out to grow other economies.

1720
01:32:22,069 --> 01:32:26,574
It doesn't really play with the, you know,
that populist argument that's been so...

1721
01:32:26,607 --> 01:32:30,144
that's worked so well in this
current political environment.

1722
01:32:30,177 --> 01:32:32,647
But, you know, again,
is that what we want?

1723
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:36,450
And if we begin to export,
the price of gas is going to move up.

1724
01:32:36,484 --> 01:32:39,353
I mean, international
pricing pressures are just going to dictate

1725
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:41,656
that the domestic price
is going to go up.

1726
01:32:41,689 --> 01:32:44,792
And wouldn't it be great
for industry

1727
01:32:44,825 --> 01:32:48,162
if they get us to be much more
dependent upon natural gas,

1728
01:32:48,195 --> 01:32:51,198
and then suddenly
the gas price starts rising?

1729
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:53,200
To me, that's a classic
consumer squeeze,

1730
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:55,803
and we will have done it
to ourselves

1731
01:32:55,836 --> 01:32:58,539
and put ourselves
right back in the same boat

1732
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:00,508
that we're in
with crude oil right now.

1733
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:05,680
We'll be much more dependent upon natural
gas, and it will no longer be cheap.

01:45:40,434 --> 01:45:42,469
from the production reservoir.

1951
01:45:42,502 --> 01:45:44,404
We found synthetic
organic compounds,

1952
01:45:44,438 --> 01:45:46,907
including a couple of gycols,

1953
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:49,910
some alcohols,
and 2-butoxyethanol.

1954
01:45:49,943 --> 01:45:53,046
We found several
petroleum-related compounds,

1955
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:57,250
including benzene
at 50 times the safe number

1956
01:45:57,284 --> 01:46:00,020
for maximum contaminant level.

1957
01:46:00,053 --> 01:46:04,591
We also found diesel and gasoline range
organics on a fairly widespread basis.

1958
01:46:04,624 --> 01:46:06,126
[Applause]

1959
01:46:09,529 --> 01:46:11,231
FENTON:
Benzene, 50 times...

1960
01:46:11,264 --> 01:46:14,234
50 times the maximum
contaminant level

1961
01:46:14,267 --> 01:46:17,404
on benzene in
the monitoring wells.

1962
01:46:18,805 --> 01:46:20,774
That's insane.

1963
01:46:20,807 --> 01:46:24,277
That's a mad amount
of pollution.

1964
01:46:24,311 --> 01:46:28,415
FOX, VOICE-OVER: The case in Pavillion
was the shot heard around the world.

1965
01:46:28,448 --> 01:46:31,852
It sounds almost absurd,
but it was the first time EPA verified

1966
01:46:31,885 --> 01:46:36,256
fracking chemicals were in
the water because of fracking.

1967
01:46:36,289 --> 01:46:38,959
And Lisa Jackson
made good on her word:

1968
01:46:38,992 --> 01:46:42,095
EPA moved into Dimock,

1969
01:46:42,129 --> 01:46:45,432
announced a full round
of testing of 60 homes,

1970
01:46:45,465 --> 01:46:48,635
and began delivering water
to residents that were affected.

1971
01:46:48,668 --> 01:46:52,873
MAN: Whoo-whoo! Whoo!
[Truck horn honks]

1972
01:46:52,906 --> 01:46:55,876
This is the day.
This is the day of vindication, right?

1973
01:46:55,909 --> 01:46:57,310
FOX: It's huge, isn't it?

1974
01:46:57,344 --> 01:46:58,779
SCOTT ELY: Yes, it is.

1975
01:46:58,812 --> 01:47:01,581
You know, it's a little
overwhelming, too. FOX: It is amazing.

1976
01:47:01,615 --> 01:47:04,518
I think we should be baptized
with this EPA water.

1977
01:47:04,551 --> 01:47:08,021
I haven't been baptized for a really
long time, but I'm ready to be baptized.

1978
01:47:08,054 --> 01:47:09,556
FOX: You want to get
in the water? ELY: Good. How you doing?

1979
01:47:09,589 --> 01:47:11,625
FOX, VOICE-OVER:
For the first time in a long time,

1980
01:47:11,658 --> 01:47:15,328
in Dimock, there was hope.

1981
01:47:15,362 --> 01:47:17,330
And then the election started.

1982
01:47:17,364 --> 01:47:20,367
Obama's State of the Union
address was largely seen

1983
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:22,469
as the first campaign
speech of the cycle.

1984
01:47:22,502 --> 01:47:26,006
BARACK OBAMA: This country needs an
all-out, all-of-the-above strategy

1985
01:47:26,039 --> 01:47:30,544
that develops every available
source of American energy.

1986
01:47:30,577 --> 01:47:32,679
[Cheers and applause]

1987
01:47:34,548 --> 01:47:36,683
OBAMA: We have a supply
of natural gas

1988
01:47:36,716 --> 01:47:39,352
that can last America
nearly 100 years,

1989
01:47:39,386 --> 01:47:44,124
and my administration will take every
possible action to safely develop this energy

1990
01:47:44,157 --> 01:47:47,127
because America will
develop this resource

1991
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:50,230
without putting the health and
safety of our citizens at risk.

1992
01:47:50,263 --> 01:47:52,699
And, by the way,

1993
01:47:52,732 --> 01:47:55,669
it was public research dollars

1994
01:47:55,702 --> 01:48:00,173
over the course of 30 years that
helped develop the technologies

1995
01:48:00,207 --> 01:48:03,577
to extract all this natural gas
out of shale rock.

1996
01:48:03,610 --> 01:48:07,147
Thank you, God bless you,
and God bless the United States of America.

1997
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:09,282
[Whistles and applause]

1998
01:48:10,784 --> 01:48:14,855
FOX, VOICE-OVER: It was a major
election-year shift in policy.

1999
01:48:16,723 --> 01:48:21,161
When policy shifts,
investigations shift, too.

2000
01:48:21,194 --> 01:48:25,866
But we were about to find out just how
many steps could get taken backwards,

2001
01:48:25,899 --> 01:48:29,369
and just how much science
could get swept aside.

2002
01:48:29,402 --> 01:48:32,038
When the first test results
came back to Dimock,

2003
01:48:32,072 --> 01:48:34,674
the residents called me,
feeling vindicated.

2004
01:48:34,708 --> 01:48:38,211
But the tests weren't released to the public;
I had to drive out there and get them myself.

2005
01:48:38,245 --> 01:48:40,914
Of the 6 tests that I
could get, all 6 wells

2006
01:48:40,947 --> 01:48:43,550
had significant levels of both
ethane and methane;

2007
01:48:43,583 --> 01:48:46,419
3 of 6 wells had volatile
organic compounds;

2008
01:48:46,453 --> 01:48:49,856
4 of 6 wells contained
polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons,

2009
01:48:49,890 --> 01:48:53,760
including benzo(a)pyrene,
benzo(GHI)perylene,

2010
01:48:53,793 --> 01:48:56,763
dibenzofuran, dinitrotoluene,

2011
01:48:56,796 --> 01:48:59,733
pyrene, and hexachlorobenzene,

2012
01:48:59,766 --> 01:49:02,836
explosive levels of methane,
and a host of contaminants,

2013
01:49:02,869 --> 01:49:06,306
including uranium,
associated with drilling.

2014
01:49:08,408 --> 01:49:12,078
And then EPA released
a desk statement to the press,

2015
01:49:12,112 --> 01:49:14,548
saying Dimock's water was safe.

2016
01:49:14,581 --> 01:49:17,017
It was deja vu all over again.

2017
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:20,020
In Dimock
is at the center of a national focus

2018
01:49:20,053 --> 01:49:23,056
on natural gas
drilling's impact on drinking water.

2019
01:49:23,089 --> 01:49:25,392
The EPA's first ruling
is that the water

2020
01:49:25,425 --> 01:49:27,661
at those homes is safe to drink.

2021
01:49:27,694 --> 01:49:30,363
FOX, VOICE-OVER: Without the tests
being released to the public,

2022
01:49:30,397 --> 01:49:34,000
the media ran with the headline
"Dimock's water was safe."

2023
01:49:34,034 --> 01:49:35,835
FOX:

2024
01:49:35,869 --> 01:49:36,836
ELY:

2025
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:37,604
FOX:

2026
01:49:37,637 --> 01:49:39,940
ELY:

2027
01:49:58,825 --> 01:50:00,060
FOX:

2028
01:50:00,093 --> 01:50:02,662
ELY:

2029
01:50:39,599 --> 01:50:42,168
FOX, VOICE-OVER:
When a federal agency changes course,

2030
01:50:42,202 --> 01:50:44,638
it happens all across
the nation.

2031
01:50:44,671 --> 01:50:48,508
Just two weeks later, the Imminent
and Substantial Endangerment Order

2032
01:50:48,541 --> 01:50:52,412
against Range Resources
in Texas was lifted.

2033
01:50:52,445 --> 01:50:55,515
The Lipsky case was dropped.

2034
01:50:56,883 --> 01:50:59,853
The press was told
the case was settled,

2035
01:50:59,886 --> 01:51:02,856
but there was no settlement
for the Lipsky family.

2036
01:51:02,889 --> 01:51:04,858
Their water was still flammable,

2037
01:51:04,891 --> 01:51:07,327
no arrangement for
water replacement was made,

2038
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:11,297
and a pipe replaced the garden hose off
the head space of their water well

2039
01:51:11,331 --> 01:51:14,034
which spewed a flame
3 feet high.

2040
01:51:15,402 --> 01:51:18,405
Steve and Shyla Lipsky were
dragged through the media

2041
01:51:18,438 --> 01:51:20,874
in a smear report from Fox News.

2042
01:51:22,308 --> 01:51:25,578
And the campaign against
Al Armendariz finally succeeded;

2043
01:51:25,612 --> 01:51:28,014
he resigned under pressure.

2044
01:51:28,048 --> 01:51:32,519
With all this back and forth, I asked
retiring Congressman Maurice Hinchey,

2045
01:51:32,552 --> 01:51:36,556
who had originally asked EPA
to get involved, who was the sponsor

2046
01:51:36,589 --> 01:51:39,626
of the "Frack Act" in Congress,
what he thought was going on.

2047
01:51:39,659 --> 01:51:41,795
My thought is that
there are... heh heh!...

2048
01:51:41,828 --> 01:51:45,265
a certain amount of contests
within the Obama Administration.

2049
01:51:45,298 --> 01:51:49,436
There are people within the Administration
who have differences of opinion.

2050
01:51:49,469 --> 01:51:52,338
Some understand that, uh,

2051
01:51:52,372 --> 01:51:55,875
the way in which this
frack drilling operation has taken place

2052
01:51:55,909 --> 01:51:58,878
and is taking place right now,
is being injurious

2053
01:51:58,912 --> 01:52:01,815
and is costing a lot
of money, is being harmful.

2054
01:52:01,848 --> 01:52:05,819
And there are others
who are very much in favor

2055
01:52:05,852 --> 01:52:09,889
of what this situation
should be continued.

2056
01:52:09,923 --> 01:52:13,460
We have to find out if it's
safe for us to be here. FOX: Right.

2057
01:52:13,493 --> 01:52:16,096
But we also have
to find out what happened

2058
01:52:16,129 --> 01:52:19,265
so that we can stop it
from happening again,

2059
01:52:19,299 --> 01:52:23,269
because people complain
about the price of gas;

2060
01:52:23,303 --> 01:52:26,940
wait till you're paying
twice that for water.

2061
01:52:28,775 --> 01:52:32,112
FOX, VOICE-OVER: What was more troubling
was that both Scott Ely in Pennsylvania

2062
01:52:32,145 --> 01:52:35,115
and Steve Lipsky in Texas
were saying the same thing...

2063
01:52:35,148 --> 01:52:38,451
mid-level EPA would come
to their door and tell them,

2064
01:52:38,485 --> 01:52:41,121
"We're sorry. We're being
yanked off the case.

2065
01:52:41,154 --> 01:52:44,457
Higher-ups are telling us
we've got to walk out on this."

2066
01:52:44,491 --> 01:52:46,459
It didn't make
any sense. Again...

2067
01:52:46,493 --> 01:52:49,429
Well, again, I got people
from inside the EPA,

2068
01:52:49,462 --> 01:52:51,965
'cause I don't want to get anyone in
trouble 'cause there's good people there,

2069
01:52:51,998 --> 01:52:57,103
I think, and said that higher-up
just yanked it away from them.

2070
01:52:57,137 --> 01:53:02,642
The Philadelphia office got a call from the
higher-ups from D.C., chewing them out.

2071
01:53:02,675 --> 01:53:07,147
He said that, uh,
that it wasn't just Range Resources,

2072
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:09,949
the gas company came
after them, it was the whole coalition.

2073
01:53:09,983 --> 01:53:14,454
But it was from the higher-ups, and
they said there was some congressmen

2074
01:53:14,487 --> 01:53:17,991
that were calling, you know,
and when they first come in here,

2075
01:53:18,024 --> 01:53:20,960
there was congressmen
that were really harassing EPA:

2076
01:53:20,994 --> 01:53:23,797
"Why are you there?
Get out of there. You don't belong there."

2077
01:53:23,830 --> 01:53:26,432
And it's kind of scary

2078
01:53:26,466 --> 01:53:29,769
when your own government
is afraid of a business.

2079
01:53:29,803 --> 01:53:32,005
FOX, VOICE-OVER:
"Don't use your water. It's not safe.

2080
01:53:32,038 --> 01:53:35,441
We can't do anything about it.
Orders are coming from above."

2081
01:53:35,475 --> 01:53:37,944
Ready to move.

2082
01:53:37,977 --> 01:53:40,914
FOX: You ready to move?

2083
01:53:40,947 --> 01:53:42,949
Yeah. I just...
Yeah?

2084
01:53:42,982 --> 01:53:45,585
It's...

2085
01:53:51,291 --> 01:53:55,328
FOX: You'd really walk out on this if you
had to... I guess you have to, right?

2086
01:53:55,361 --> 01:53:57,463
Yeah.

2087
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:02,569
FOX, VOICE-OVER:
As it turns out, neither Steve Lipsky

2088
01:54:02,602 --> 01:54:05,805
nor Barack Obama was
compelled to move.

2089
01:54:05,839 --> 01:54:07,707
Steve Lipsky didn't give up.

2090
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:10,243
He kept pressing reporters
to look into the case,

2091
01:54:10,276 --> 01:54:12,879
and just after the election,
all sorts of things turned up.

2092
01:54:12,912 --> 01:54:16,416
It turned up that EPA had done
a full hydrogeological study

2093
01:54:16,449 --> 01:54:18,751
of the gas drilling
near Steve Lipsky's house,

2094
01:54:18,785 --> 01:54:22,755
showing a fingerprint match between
the gas in Range Resources' gas well

2095
01:54:22,789 --> 01:54:25,325
and the gas in
Steve Lipsky's water well.

2096
01:54:25,358 --> 01:54:28,027
So the EPA knew the whole time.

2097
01:54:28,061 --> 01:54:31,064
A letter from the
Texas Regulatory Agency to Range Resources,

2098
01:54:31,097 --> 01:54:33,499
stating that their cement job
had failed.

2099
01:54:33,533 --> 01:54:35,802
So the gas company knew
the whole time.

2100
01:54:35,835 --> 01:54:39,439
An email that revealed that former
Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell

2101
01:54:39,472 --> 01:54:41,407
had actually lobbied the EPA

2102
01:54:41,441 --> 01:54:43,543
on behalf of Range Resources

2103
01:54:43,576 --> 01:54:45,111
to drop the case.

2104
01:54:45,144 --> 01:54:48,147
Just a few weeks after
the election, Lisa Jackson,

2105
01:54:48,181 --> 01:54:50,583
EPA Administrator
and lead investigator

2106
01:54:50,617 --> 01:54:54,621
on fracking across
the U.S., resigned.

2107
01:54:54,654 --> 01:54:58,057
Scott Ely hung on in Dimock,
continuing his lawsuit,

2108
01:54:58,091 --> 01:55:00,059
and New Yorkers didn't
give up, either.

2109
01:55:00,093 --> 01:55:03,062
Citizens submitted
204,000 public comments

2110
01:55:03,096 --> 01:55:05,565
on the last stage of the
Environmental Impact Statement,

2111
01:55:05,598 --> 01:55:08,067
forcing Governor Cuomo
to halt the process

2112
01:55:08,101 --> 01:55:10,503
and continue the de facto
moratorium.

2113
01:55:10,536 --> 01:55:13,106
FOX, VOICE-OVER:
But for the rest of the Dimock families,

2114
01:55:13,139 --> 01:55:15,341
when EPA's press release seemed
to destroy their case,

2115
01:55:15,375 --> 01:55:18,878
their lawyers turned around on them,
saying, "You've got to settle with Cabot

2116
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:20,847
"and you have to sign
non-disclosure agreements

2117
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:23,316
or else we're coming
after you for our expenses,"

2118
01:55:23,349 --> 01:55:26,386
which the residents could
in no way afford.

2119
01:55:26,419 --> 01:55:29,022
So, in just the matter
of a year and a half,

2120
01:55:29,055 --> 01:55:32,525
the Dimock case had exploded in the
media, been reported worldwide,

2121
01:55:32,558 --> 01:55:35,561
had set the stage
for a precedent for water replacement

2122
01:55:35,595 --> 01:55:38,064
throughout PA and throughout
the world that could have cost

2123
01:55:38,097 --> 01:55:40,867
the gas industry trillions
of dollars to fulfill,

2124
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:44,904
to being shoved in the corner, denied the truth
by the federal government, the gas industry,

2125
01:55:44,938 --> 01:55:49,442
and the state, and told to take
the money, shut up, and go away.

2126
01:55:49,475 --> 01:55:53,913
The residents started
preparing for silence.

2127
01:55:53,947 --> 01:55:56,416
FOX: As a last question,

2128
01:55:56,449 --> 01:55:59,419
if you're in a position
where Cabot would do nothing,

2129
01:55:59,452 --> 01:56:03,423
except if you guys signed an agreement
that said you couldn't speak anymore,

2130
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:06,392
what would you like
your last statement to be?

2131
01:56:06,426 --> 01:56:11,431
Well, knowing me as well
as you do, and a lot of people know me,

2132
01:56:11,464 --> 01:56:16,169
that it's like I almost
never... stop talking.

2133
01:56:16,202 --> 01:56:18,638
Ha ha ha ha!

2134
01:56:18,671 --> 01:56:22,675
Oh, my husband says,
"You wake up talking."

2135
01:56:22,709 --> 01:56:26,179
And I do. I do.

2136
01:56:26,212 --> 01:56:28,181
You know, I'm a communicator.

2137
01:56:28,214 --> 01:56:32,218
I've given this my all, Josh.
I've given this 200%.

2138
01:56:32,251 --> 01:56:37,223
FOX: So, there isn't one
final sentence, statement?

2139
01:56:37,256 --> 01:56:39,859
[Alarm beeps]

2140
01:56:42,261 --> 01:56:45,365
See? I'm practicing.

2141
01:57:00,013 --> 01:57:02,048
[Beep]

2142
01:57:11,591 --> 01:57:14,360
FOX, VOICE-OVER: A few weeks
after returning home from Wyoming,

2143
01:57:14,394 --> 01:57:17,497
a disturbing hearing was
announced in the House of Representatives.

2144
01:57:17,530 --> 01:57:20,400
The House Committee
on Science and Technology

2145
01:57:20,433 --> 01:57:22,902
was hauling EPA in
before a panel

2146
01:57:22,935 --> 01:57:25,738
to question their results
in Pavillion.

2147
01:57:25,772 --> 01:57:27,640
Clearly, it was another attack.

2148
01:57:27,673 --> 01:57:32,011
If Congress was going to attack EPA
in the last remaining investigation,

2149
01:57:32,045 --> 01:57:35,982
someone needed to be there
to tell the story.

2150
01:57:36,015 --> 01:57:39,552
But Representative Andy Harris,
Republican Chair of the Committee,

2151
01:57:39,585 --> 01:57:43,289
was barring our cameras
from the proceedings.

2152
01:57:44,690 --> 01:57:46,692
FOX: I just have to stay calm.

2153
01:57:46,726 --> 01:57:48,895
If I start getting nervous, I'm
going to say the wrong thing.

2154
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:51,564
I just have to stay calm.

2155
01:57:51,597 --> 01:57:54,567
FOX, VOICE-OVER: There's a protocol in
Congress that if you want to tape a hearing,

2156
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:58,137
you have to sign up and register; we
followed the protocol, we signed up.

2157
01:57:58,171 --> 01:58:02,608
We knew the rules... if someone was speaking
in public, that meant they could be recorded,

2158
01:58:02,642 --> 01:58:05,945
and the First Amendment states,
"Congress shall make no law

2159
01:58:05,978 --> 01:58:07,947
impeding the freedom
of the press."

2160
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:11,551
That meant, to me,
that no matter which representative told me

2161
01:58:11,584 --> 01:58:16,622
that I couldn't come in that day, the
Constitution guaranteed my rights.

2162
01:58:19,225 --> 01:58:21,227
FOX: Has press
already gone in?

2163
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:22,662
There's no press covering.

2164
01:58:22,695 --> 01:58:26,199
No credentialed media
signed up to cover the hearing. Uh-huh.

2165
01:58:26,232 --> 01:58:29,569
FOX, VOICE-OVER: Of course, I knew what
might happen. I didn't think it would.

2166
01:58:29,602 --> 01:58:31,604
I thought they would
actually cave and realize

2167
01:58:31,637 --> 01:58:33,739
that we were on the right side
of the First Amendment.

2168
01:58:33,773 --> 01:58:36,742
But I have to say
I wasn't surprised.

2169
01:58:36,776 --> 01:58:39,712
WOMAN: Sir, you are not
allowed in with a camera.

2170
01:58:39,745 --> 01:58:43,216
FOX, VOICE-OVER: It had been
demonstrated to me over and over again

2171
01:58:43,249 --> 01:58:46,385
that certain elements
within Congress and the gas industry

2172
01:58:46,419 --> 01:58:50,456
had gotten used to treating the Constitution
just as they had treated the fossil fuels

2173
01:58:50,490 --> 01:58:56,129
they extracted, as a relic left behind from
the past that they had every right to burn.

2174
01:58:56,162 --> 01:58:58,097
WOMAN: You cannot
have that in here.

2175
01:58:58,131 --> 01:59:00,199
FOX: Of course we can.
It's a public meeting. No, you cannot.

2176
01:59:00,233 --> 01:59:02,201
There's an appeal to the Chair.

2177
01:59:02,235 --> 01:59:04,670
Several of the members are
going to make a statement.

2178
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:07,039
Sir. And we are allowed to
be here, within our rights.

2179
01:59:07,073 --> 01:59:09,041
Are you going
to remove your camera?

2180
01:59:09,075 --> 01:59:12,311
I... I am not going
to remove the camera.

2181
01:59:13,713 --> 01:59:16,816
Sir, sir, stop.

2182
01:59:18,184 --> 01:59:21,154
FOX: We have
also sent emails.

2183
01:59:21,187 --> 01:59:24,957
We have also sent emails
and we have talked. Yes.

2184
01:59:24,991 --> 01:59:26,626
Do your duty,
Officer. All right.

2185
01:59:26,659 --> 01:59:29,662
Sir, turn around, put your hands
behind your back for me, please.

2186
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:34,667
MAN: Come on, come on.
Come on, Mr. Chairman.

2187
01:59:36,035 --> 01:59:38,504
Mr. Chair, we discussed
this before.

2188
01:59:38,538 --> 01:59:41,507
Ahem. This is
a public hearing.

2189
01:59:41,541 --> 01:59:44,076
This is a public hearing.

2190
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:46,012
I'm within my First
Amendment rights,

2191
01:59:46,045 --> 01:59:48,681
and I am being taken out.

2192
01:59:50,149 --> 01:59:52,485
MAN: Well, but before
the meeting has begun,

2193
01:59:52,518 --> 01:59:56,856
before we've had a chance to discuss the issues,
this guy is being led out in handcuffs.

2194
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:01,727
WOMAN: Where's the transparency?

2195
02:00:05,364 --> 02:00:07,867
FOX, VOICE-OVER: They led me out
of the hearing room.

2196
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:09,869
I was told I was the first
journalist to be arrested

2197
02:00:09,902 --> 02:00:12,305
in Congress simply
for doing journalism,

2198
02:00:12,338 --> 02:00:14,373
but we really wanted
to tape the hearing.

2199
02:00:14,407 --> 02:00:16,776
We really wanted to hear
what they had to say.

2200
02:00:16,809 --> 02:00:21,080
The great irony is that
after taping 3 1/2 years of hearings

2201
02:00:21,113 --> 02:00:24,050
all across the nation,
in big places and small,

2202
02:00:24,083 --> 02:00:27,587
the last thing I ever want
to do ever again

2203
02:00:27,620 --> 02:00:29,722
is tape a goddamn hearing.

2204
02:00:29,755 --> 02:00:31,691
You got to stand on your feet
the whole time,

2205
02:00:31,724 --> 02:00:33,759
most of what's said is
pretty boring.

2206
02:00:33,793 --> 02:00:35,695
It's a pretty arduous deal.

2207
02:00:35,728 --> 02:00:38,197
When they led me out
in handcuffs, I was half-relieved

2208
02:00:38,231 --> 02:00:41,200
that I didn't have to keep
standing there listening to these people.

2209
02:00:41,234 --> 02:00:44,237
I felt calm. I felt relaxed.
I felt free.

2210
02:00:44,270 --> 02:00:47,440
I didn't have to answer
my phone, return a text message,

2211
02:00:47,473 --> 02:00:49,909
make sure that the camera wasn't
running out of batteries.

2212
02:00:49,942 --> 02:00:52,245
I didn't have to listen to what
these people were saying,

2213
02:00:52,278 --> 02:00:54,447
attacking my friends
in Pavillion, Wyoming,

2214
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:56,582
attacking the EPA once more.

2215
02:00:56,616 --> 02:01:00,186
I had done everything I needed
to do at that moment.

2216
02:01:00,219 --> 02:01:01,687
There wasn't any more.

2217
02:01:01,721 --> 02:01:04,156
After 3 1/2 years of recording,

2218
02:01:04,190 --> 02:01:07,660
documenting, writing notes,
traveling all over the world,

2219
02:01:07,693 --> 02:01:10,830
this was the most
that I could do.

2220
02:01:27,046 --> 02:01:28,881
When I was in
the police station,

2221
02:01:28,914 --> 02:01:32,385
my arresting officer hit me up
for a part in my next movie

2222
02:01:32,418 --> 02:01:34,820
as he was leading me over
to the fingerprint machine.

2223
02:01:34,854 --> 02:01:36,822
When they pressed my fingers
down on the glass,

2224
02:01:36,856 --> 02:01:39,025
and I saw the images
up on the screen...

2225
02:01:39,058 --> 02:01:41,294
the ridges, the circles

2226
02:01:41,327 --> 02:01:43,896
on my fingertips...
I realized

2227
02:01:43,929 --> 02:01:45,865
they looked just like
the inside of a tree.

2228
02:01:45,898 --> 02:01:50,770
Maybe there's something deep in our DNA
that doesn't want to get cut down.

2229
02:01:50,803 --> 02:01:54,273
Maybe there's something linked.
At least that's what I feel.

2230
02:01:54,307 --> 02:01:56,809
A tree doesn't move
until you cut it down,

2231
02:01:56,842 --> 02:01:59,812
and I'm certainly... not moving.

2232
02:01:59,845 --> 02:02:01,847
We can't all just move,

2233
02:02:01,881 --> 02:02:04,950
certainly not when there's
another way out.

2234
02:02:04,984 --> 02:02:07,820
I felt like I could see it...
a horizontal well bore

2235
02:02:07,853 --> 02:02:12,191
drilled down into the earth,
snaking underneath the Congress,

2236
02:02:12,224 --> 02:02:15,728
shooting money up
through the chamber at such high pressure

2237
02:02:15,761 --> 02:02:18,230
that it blew the top off
of our democracy,

2238
02:02:18,264 --> 02:02:21,434
another layer of contamination
due to fracking;

2239
02:02:21,467 --> 02:02:23,903
not the water, not the air,

2240
02:02:23,936 --> 02:02:26,605
but our government... all
those toxic dollars,

2241
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:29,642
all those contaminants,
all of that influence

2242
02:02:29,675 --> 02:02:32,144
out-sizing the citizen's voice

2243
02:02:32,178 --> 02:02:34,113
in our democratic republic.

2244
02:02:34,146 --> 02:02:36,682
So I still don't know what's
going to happen around here.

2245
02:02:36,716 --> 02:02:42,221
The saying goes, "Environmentalists
only ever get temporary victories."

2246
02:02:42,254 --> 02:02:45,691
But the losses are
always permanent.

2247
02:02:45,725 --> 02:02:48,728
There's no such thing
as anyone's backyard anymore.

2248
02:02:48,761 --> 02:02:50,696
This wasn't about me
getting drilled

2249
02:02:50,730 --> 02:02:53,799
or anyone getting drilled
in any one place.

2250
02:02:53,833 --> 02:02:56,769
The plan is for shale gas

2251
02:02:56,802 --> 02:02:59,772
to be the new world energy.

2252
02:02:59,805 --> 02:03:01,841
If they get their way,

2253
02:03:01,874 --> 02:03:05,511
we're in for 50 years
of shale gas running the world.

2254
02:03:06,912 --> 02:03:08,848
You start to get dizzy.

2255
02:03:08,881 --> 02:03:11,016
I felt like I could
close my eyes

2256
02:03:11,050 --> 02:03:14,520
and open them anywhere
in the world.
