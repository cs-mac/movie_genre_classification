1
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,070
The Ministry of State has been informed and 
they have not observed any irregularities.

2
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,070
What do you suspect that he wants to do?

3
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,800
We don't know yet.

4
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,800
I need to see a list of everybody 
who is in the building right now.

5
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,920
That's more than 300.

6
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,670
Everybody has been checked 
and we have their IDs.

7
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,570
Any other entrances to the building?

8
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,570
Used by journalists, 
maintenance or cleaning staff?

9
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,950
We're sure that everything 
is under control.

10
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,050
Even though we only got a very 
flimsy description of the suspect.

11
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,250
Excellent, can I see that list?

12
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:16,650
Sarah,

13
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,650
I have just spoken to my head office

14
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,700
nobody at the DSIS

15
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,700
knew about the Prime Minister's 
car being in Jutland that day,

16
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,120
or tearing a page out of the notebook.

17
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,670
No, but somebody must have done it.

18
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,700
Can I get that list now?

19
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
Sarah, we have not torn that page out

20
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,350
believe it.

21
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,570
Everything still points to Ussing.

22
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,850
Except that the kidnapper says it's not.

23
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,150
Here is the list.

24
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,120
How about surveillance?

25
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,850
I would like to see recordings 
for the past hour.

26
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,120
Sure, but like I told you we have 
observed and checked everybody.

27
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,320
That is very reassuring

28
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,200
but I still need to see the 
surveillance tapes.

29
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,450
Lund

30
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,450
Brix here,  what is going on?

31
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,450
Goodbye

32
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,800
and good luck on the campaign.

33
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,270
Those 3 can become great ministers

34
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,700
I have decided to carry out 
our austerity measures

35
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,000
and show our values.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,450
Why did you fire the Minister 
of Finance without informing me first?

37
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,950
Because you wouldn't have agreed.

38
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,750
How about Christopher?

39
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,970
Has he gone ahead to the meeting?

40
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,970
No, he is at a security briefing.

41
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,370
Even if I wouldn't have agreed, 
you should still have consulted me.

42
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,150
I can't have a minister who is 
working against me,

43
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:17,700
right?

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,700
Let's just get a hold of 
Christopher so we can leave.

45
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,700
You are extremely vulnerable 
if you try to do it on your own.

46
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,000
The Emilie Zeuthen case 
is not closed yet,

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,450
you need to calm things down.

48
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,900
I do not want any unrest

49
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,470
and that's why we are no 
longer working with Rosa Lebech.

50
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,170
You will agree on that, I'm sure

51
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,770
we are very strong right now,

52
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,870
there are three days to the election

53
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,120
Ussing and the centre party

54
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,470
are down for the count.

55
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,720
We just need to get Emilie 
Zeuthen back alive.

56
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,720
We also have irregularities.

57
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,720
I noticed that when I was looking 
for the files requested by the police

58
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,170
our vehicle logbook from back then

59
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,170
is missing from the archives.

60
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,400
What vehicle logbook?

61
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,520
The vehicle's logbook..

62
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,950
I've just been told by security

63
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,170
they think the kidnapper is here 
in the Parliament building.

64
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,170
The kidnapper is here?

65
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,820
You have to go back to the Ministry.

66
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,820
Go now.

67
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,820
But...

68
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,670
We have checked everybody as you can see

69
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,950
we do a thorough job.

70
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,950
It could take all night

71
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,950
the kidnapper could be deceiving you

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,100
and he's chasing Ussing.

73
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,420
No it's not Ussing

74
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,420
he is at the police station with his lawyer

75
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,700
Brix says that he is no longer a suspect.

76
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,700
I am missing the last hour on this list.

77
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,600
What you mean he's no longer a suspect?

78
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,420
Apparently he has an alibi 
for that day and time

79
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,000
he was at a hotel together 
with a female member of staff

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and that has been verified.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,320
This is unacceptable

82
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,850
we need to let them go.

83
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,620
They need to get back home, 
catch trains and planes

84
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,970
I can see that you had visitors 
from a photocopier service company

85
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,970
this afternoon for a few hours

86
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,900
and then again 20 minutes ago

87
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,770
after normal working hours 
and he shows his ID.

88
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,770
We have background checks 
on all their employees.

89
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,120
They are here frequently.

90
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,150
But his ID is also cleared for 
the Ministry of State.

91
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,370
I need to know where he is right now.

92
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,370
Hey, how do you fast forward on this thing?

93
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,500
The service guy told us that he 
forgot to change a toner cartridge 
in the administration wing.

94
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,800
Is that the administration wing?

95
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
No, that is the Ministry of State's red zone.

96
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,320
What are they saying?

97
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,120
Why is the kidnapper here?

98
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,120
They are not certain, it's 
probably a false alarm.

99
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,300
It's really bad if we arrive 
late for that election rally.

100
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,300
You need to go to the panic room.

101
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,100
Why?

102
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,100
Just go.

103
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,100
Where is Karen?

104
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,570
She was talking about some missing 
files and trying to find a backup.

105
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,900
Excuse me.

106
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,700
Is there something I can help you with?

107
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,550
Hello, I'm talking to you.

108
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,420
The kidnapper has been spotted, 
he is wearing a cap.

109
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,050
I'm on it.

110
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,220
You two, come with me.

111
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,220
You saw a guy fiddling with the equipment.

112
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,200
I only saw from the back.

113
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,450
When you catch him...

114
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,800
Stop, everybody out of here except 
the guys from the forensic team.

115
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,200
No, no no NO!

116
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,170
Listen here

117
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,270
the kidnapper stole a hard drive.

118
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:06,950
Apparently.

119
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,670
What's on that hard drive?

120
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,670
We don't know that yet.

121
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,650
Firstly, I would like to know 
why the kidnapper was here.

122
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,500
Because he's trying to find out

123
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,820
who was driving the minister's 
car on a specific day

124
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,170
during the election campaign 
two and a half years ago.

125
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:20,950
Excuse me,

126
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,520
Sarah Lund from the crime division

127
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,520
and Matias Borch from PET.

128
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,550
The minister's car was not used 
during the election campaign.

129
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,420
I believe I explained that to you already.

130
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,170
The car was spotted by a small boy who

131
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,170
wrote down the registration 
number in his notebook.

132
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,670
It was on 20 April

133
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,720
on the same day as..

134
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,720
It doesn't matter what date it was, 
it can't have been that car.

135
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,320
Why should the kidnapper be 
interested in my ministerial car?

136
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,800
I don't get it.

137
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,750
It's Ussing who is involved, 
it has nothing to do with the Prime Minister.

138
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,120
Ussing has been cleared of all suspicion.

139
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,650
Our investigation, leads us to believe

140
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,950
that Emilie Zeuthen was kidnapped, 
because the old case was closed down 
without being solved,

141
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,050
and that is why we need to follow every lead.

142
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,050
So you think that we have 
something to do with it?

143
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,050
Not necessarily.

144
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,100
The facts are like this.

145
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,100
We know that the minister's car 
was over there on that day.

146
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,100
We just need to know who drove it.

147
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,850
Surely you understand it is in 
your own best interest to answer questions.

148
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,850
The hard drive that the kidnapper took

149
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,620
apparently contains all the information 
regarding the minister's car,

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,270
who drove it, where it was, GPS ...

151
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,550
Am I to understand that I or..

152
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:23,720
 yes

153
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,920
myself or some of my staff are 
under investigation for murder?

154
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,220
That is not what we are saying.

155
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,800
I suggest we just calm down and..

156
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,970
The conversation ends here.

157
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,370
We don't know what you're talking about.

158
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,100
One thing is for sure

159
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,320
the Prime Minister was not in 
that car that day.

160
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,720
Your car was in that notebook

161
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,450
and that specific page was 
torn out of the notebook

162
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,450
I know there is something that 
you're not telling us.

163
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,200
You have any idea who you are talking to?

164
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
I am sorry about the phrasing...

165
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
That car, somebody was putting 
pressure on that Deputy Chief Prosecutor

166
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,720
to close down the case.

167
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,720
If you know anything this is 
the time to tell us.

168
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,320
We will get back to you.

169
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,850
Great work,  just excellent

170
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,270
We have searched the whole harbour 
and all the containers

171
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,570
we have not found anything

172
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,720
suggesting where Emilie might be.

173
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,720
What about the iPad?

174
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,950
Did you send it to the police?
178
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,950
Yes, it is being tested but,

175
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,220
we haven't heard anyhing yet.

176
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,450
They found the place in the harbour 
where the kidnapper was hiding.

177
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,270
The police say that she was kept there briefly,

178
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,650
before he left the boat in the harbour.

179
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,650
Any signs to suggest that 
she is still alive?

180
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,700
They didn't say.

181
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,600
When did he take her?

182
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,050
Where?

183
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,800
The police believe that she was 
taken onto a ship going abroad,

184
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,350
perhaps in a container.

185
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,350
23 ships passed through

186
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,350
during that period.

187
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,570
The problem is

188
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,570
that was three days ago.

189
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,370
The containers have gone on different ships

190
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,320
and therefore the numbers of 
ships that Emilie can be on

191
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,400
has doubled.

192
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,300
Plus harbours...

193
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,300
We will check all the ships 
and all the harbours.

194
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,300
Many of the ships are on the open sea.

195
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,600
Call them back.

196
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Contact the shipping operators 
and tell them we will pay.

197
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,850
It's not enough even if we pay

198
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,300
we cannot buy assurance.

199
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,770
She could have been brought ashore.

200
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,770
What about the people calling 
in for the reward,

201
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,820
anything we can use?

202
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,820
No, nothing, I'm sorry

203
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,650
not yet.

204
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,650
Contact those ships.

205
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,520
and keep on taking those calls.

206
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,470
Any news?

207
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,400
I'm going to call and say good night to Carl.

208
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:54,300
Hear his voice.

209
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,270
It's not your fault.

210
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,600
Did you know about the iPad?

211
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,120
and that she was in the attic

212
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,800
talking to the kidnapper?

213
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,100
She was angry at us,

214
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,570
both of us.

215
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,200
You've told me we will find her,

216
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,270
that's why I know we will find her.

217
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,270
Okay?

218
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,450
Okay

219
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,070
...the calls for them to me.

220
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,800
Lots of people have not managed 
to get through to the police.

221
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,820
They have started calling direct to Zeeland.

222
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,820
100 million reward

223
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,800
is going to make them act insane.

224
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,800
I can see what's happening.

225
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,320
 Robert

226
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,000
is always the same.

227
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,670
he has been unfair to you

228
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,670
and not paid attention to the children.

229
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,670
The cat, the iPad.

230
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,070
I still don't know if it's 
all Zeeland's fault

231
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,400
because they are hiding something.

232
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,770
Robert and Zeeland are not 
involved in anything.

233
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,250
That is also what the police are saying.

234
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,450
Hey.

235
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,520
You know I'll do anything for you.

236
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,970
Maja.

237
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,970
I want to go now to Carl.

238
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,850
Maritime maps and container numbers

239
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,850
suggest that she has been put on a ship

240
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,400
but we don't know any more.

241
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,800
Send a copy of of the information 
over to Zeuthen.

242
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,620
Okay.

243
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,350
And she has not left any clues 
to where she was going?

244
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,350
If she was here then it was 
a very short stay

245
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,350
just changing clothes and moving on.

246
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,820
Anything on the kidnapper?

247
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,770
We have plenty of fingerprints 
but nothing that matches our database.

248
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,520
Another homeless knows nothing

249
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,900
only that he kept to himself.

250
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,900
What about the connection to 
Louise Jelby's mother

251
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,900
anything suggesting who he might be?

252
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,000
He kept a photo of her

253
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,300
So she must have meant something to him

254
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,300
when she was young before she got cancer.

255
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,300
Okay, the kidnapper took a hard drive.

256
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,520
As he no longer has his hideaway

257
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,420
he's going to try and find a computer

258
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,950
so he can check the contents 
of the hard drive.

259
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,650
Okay I will try to search libraries 
and Internet cafes. I will call back.

260
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:37,870
Thanks.

261
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,870
Somebody must know something

262
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,870
what about the surveillance?

263
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,450
The photocopier service company?

264
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,600
The kidnapper broke into the company car

265
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,070
and stole a uniform and ID card

266
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,620
while the repair guy was away.

267
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,900
The only thing you can see 
on the surveillance tape

268
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,870
is that he walks with a limp

269
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,870
so it's quite amazing that he 
managed to get away from you.

270
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,470
Any update?

271
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,050
Nothing new.

272
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,050
The Ministry of State must 
tell us what they know.

273
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,270
If they know anything

274
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,770
right now it's just accusations

275
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,250
based on scribbling in a 
small boy's notebook.

276
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,650
I would really like to have known 
about these scribbles 12 hours ago

277
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,650
when we last sat here

278
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,370
and you told us that PET 
knew nothing about it.

279
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,500
We had no knowledge about it.

280
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,400
Obviously not

281
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,570
but you must know whether the 
minister's car was in Jutland that day.

282
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,050
It's not exactly helping Emilie Zeuthen

283
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,670
that you are less than f
orthcoming with information.

284
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,270
It was during the election

285
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,270
we had better things to do, 
than to watch a car in a garage.

286
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,870
Also the Ministry of State 
says it is not true

287
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:17,720
Dyring,

288
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,000
But the fact that that page was torn out

289
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,870
suggest that..

290
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,020
Speculations.

291
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,850
It could have been the 
Deputy Chief Prosecutor

292
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,170
it could been an accident, 
maybe the boy did it.

293
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:25,850
No matter what

294
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,850
we still have to show the kidnapper

295
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:28,870
that we are working on the case.

296
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,870
We need to focus our investigation 
on finding the kidnapper.

297
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,870
For FUCK'S SAKE THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING!

298
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,870
Borch, come here

299
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,200
Let me explain.

300
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,950
Borch come here.

301
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,670
You have to bring it up with management.

302
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,520
We need to search the Ministry of State

303
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,520
The small boy collects 
licence plate numbers

304
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,420
I don't want to persuade management

305
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
Then you have to figure out something.

306
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,470
We risk that the kidnapper 
will never call again

307
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,970
if we don't do something.

308
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,150
I made a request that these container 
numbers be given to Zeuthen.

309
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,150
I'll check up with them.

310
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,470
I have just received a complaint 
from the Ministry of State.

311
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,150
What's going on.

312
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,150
We have a good explanation.

313
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,820
First the opposition party and now this.

314
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,950
It stops now

315
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,800
Ruth

316
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,600
You will apologise to them

317
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,700
Ruth

318
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,700
We need to talk.

319
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,100
I don't want these accusations hanging.

320
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,300
I want everything regarding that 
car investigated, right now.

321
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,120
I'm on it.

322
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,400
The problem is that the hard 
drive and information are gone

323
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,900
and so is the vehicle logbook.

324
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,200
I'm trying to contact the 
chauffeur of the car.

325
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,620
Okay?

326
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,620
Security has been intensified.

327
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,800
PET  have requested that we cancel 
our arrangement for tonight

328
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
so I have moved a fundraiser till tomorrow.

329
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,720
What is the chauffeur saying?

330
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
They will call back soon and 
then we will find out

331
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,820
No, call them in for a meeting right now.

332
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,200
If Emilie Zeuthen's life depends on it, 
then I have to ask myself.

333
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,770
You don't need to talk to anybody else.

334
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,170
What?

335
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,720
It was me who removed the 
logbook this afternoon.

336
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,050
I didn't want it ending up with the police.

337
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,300
Not before I had a chance to talk to you

338
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,220
because the car was not in 
the garage back then.

339
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,320
Who drove it?

340
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,320
What are you talking about?

341
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,320
It was your son.

342
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,320
It was Benjamin who drove the car.

343
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,070
It was during the last election campaign.

344
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,700
There were demonstrations against 
the Banks' involvement in the financial  crisis.

345
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,020
It was violent

346
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,550
and Benjamin was recognised as 
one of the troublemakers.

347
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,520
He was only 17 so they called me

348
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,600
because they couldn't get hold of you.

349
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
I didn't have any option so..

350
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,770
I persuaded one of the chauffeurs 
to pick him up in the Minister's car

351
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,520
and drive him to Jutland  where we were at the time.

352
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,150
I arrived at the hotel.

353
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,700
He somehow managed to get hold 
of the car keys

354
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,700
and got away in the Prime Minister's car.

355
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,250
It is In the vehicle logbook

356
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,220
20th of April passenger Benjamin Kamper

357
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,670
Wwhy didn't you say anything?

358
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,820
I wanted to but

359
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,250
I did not want you to get involved

360
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,520
with me misusing the minister's car.

361
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,650
Benjamin was embarrassed and 
made me promise not to tell.

362
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,650
He was not one to provoke.

363
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,300
He was angry and drunk.

364
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,300
How long was he gone, in the car?

365
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,120
I found him late in the evening.

366
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,600
He called me from some bus terminal.

367
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
He was sorry and out of petrol.

368
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,070
Why didn't you say something?

369
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,300
What about the girl? Did he meet her?

370
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,300
No of course he didn't meet her.

371
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,620
He just drove around till he had calmed down,

372
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,250
and then I sent him back to Copenhagen.

373
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,750
You need to make a statement about 
everything that happened that day.

374
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,750
What time he came over, what 
he did, and when he was found

375
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,750
Any other files that you lied about?

376
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:38,300
ANSWER.

377
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,050
No

378
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,050
Then you have to go to the police 
and tell them everything.

379
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,050
Everything.

380
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,400
If this comes out

381
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,320
then it will look like it's us that 
put pressure on the Deputy Chief Prosecutor.

382
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
I don't give a fuck.

383
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
The police need this information right now.

384
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,570
They better see this

385
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,220
I can confirm that we are currently 
investigating events at the Ministry of State

386
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,470
and will continue doing that 
until we have satisfactory answers.

387
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,870
Anybody specific?

388
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,870
I can't comment on that.

389
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,900
I want to make it understood

390
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,220
that we are doing everything we can

391
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,520
to get Emilie Zeuthen back alive.

392
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,000
I will man the phones and prepare a press release.

393
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,700
Right.

394
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,270
We need to inform Benjamin's mother, your ex-wife.

395
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,270
I'll take that.

396
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,120
Okay

397
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,220
Karen, can you make sure that

398
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,220
Christopher doesn't get anywhere 
near me, I don't want to see him.

399
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,570
Of course

400
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,120
Chairman Gidlsford has heard about 
the accusations against the Ministry of State

401
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,120
and he's asking for an orientation

402
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,120
but I'll take care of that.

403
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,850
Somebody from the police is here.

404
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,320
It's that woman

405
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,320
she says it is important.

406
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:54,450
Okay

407
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,900
Unless you can tell me where Emilie is

408
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,900
we have nothing to talk about.

409
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,700
I just want to know whether you 
had time to look at those container numbers

410
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,920
that I sent you.

411
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,920
It was a list of all the 
containers in the harbour

412
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,920
three days ago. We have searched most of them

413
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,370
and we are working on the rest...

414
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,370
Please inform us..

415
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,800
...abroad

416
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
Are any of the containers of greater interest?

417
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,920
No.

418
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,920
What about the iPad?

419
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,370
Any clues about the kidnapper?

420
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,120
The forensic investigation is still ongoing

421
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,100
It explains how..

422
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,000
Maya

423
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,470
she wants to talk to you, 
she's down in the car park.

424
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,100
But I need some information 
about some former employees.

425
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,770
It will only take a minute.

426
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,770
We are all very busy.

427
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,520
We still believe that the old case

428
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,520
will lead us to Emilie.

429
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,350
The kidnapper is the biological 
father of the girl that got killed

430
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,350
and he could have been employed by Zeeland.

431
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,720
We have already been very helpful,

432
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,320
lists of employees with  photos.

433
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
The kidnapper is not somebody 
who worked on  an oil rig.

434
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,200
The guy we are looking for 
has detailed knowledge

435
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,520
of computers, has a technical background

436
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
and knows everything about the harbour.

437
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,020
It must be in Roberts Zeuthen's 
best interest..

438
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,050
Do not tell me what is in his best interest

439
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,050
I believe I'm better qualified for that.

440
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,050
Then help me.

441
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:09,420
We are looking for an engineer 
or the equivalent

442
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,370
and something must have happened regarding 
his employment when his daughter died.

443
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,370
 I..

444
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:20,400
There were a lot of staff made redundant 
2 1/2 years ago and reassignments

445
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,900
Why?

446
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,370
The financial  collapse.

447
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:29,470
Some of our competitors closed down 
and Zeeland took on some of their employees.

448
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,470
But we couldn't take them all.

449
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,750
I will need those records, 
maybe we can find something.

450
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,300
I will make sure you get the information

451
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:42,850
Thank you.

452
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,070
I want to make it clear

453
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,220
it would be unbearable for Robert Zeuthen

454
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,110
if Emilie dies

455
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,730
because the police failed to solve some old case

456
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,840
and it would have ramifications 
that go beyond our comprehension.

457
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,570
Hi.

458
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,080
Can we stay at your place?

459
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,910
In the guest room?

460
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,820
Hi dad.

461
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,640
Hi, my lovely boy

462
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,620
Just till we find something else.

463
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,620
Of course.

464
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,970
Come, let's go home.

465
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,020
Thank you.

466
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,040
I'll get somebody to pick up your car.

467
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,350
We have received a written statement 
from the Ministry of State.

468
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,480
They now admit that the minister's car 
was indeed in Jutland on that day,

469
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,820
but said that it was the Prime Minister's 
son that took the car.

470
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,060
The vehicle logbook confirms it

471
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,750
His son, what was he doing there?

472
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:12,400
The son got angry at his dad 
and drove around in the car,

473
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,570
and somehow the logbook just dropped 
off the shelf this afternoon.

474
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,440
And how can we believe it is time?

475
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:24,350
It was witnessed by the brother of 
the Prime Minister, Christopher Kamper.

476
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,970
He will make a statement to us tomorrow.

477
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,730
Fridge Note: I have moved in with a friend. 
Thank you so much for the help, love Eva.

478
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,550
We need to bring the son in for questioning.

479
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,770
Lund, don't ever read any 
newspapers or watch the news?

480
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,770
The son is dead.

481
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,240
Officially it was an accident but

482
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,240
as far as I know it

483
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,000
wasn't, it was suicide.

484
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Only a few weeks after that Kamper 
won the election back then,

485
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,060
but of course the head of DSIS doesn't 
believe it could have been the son.

486
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,060
Let's pressure them

487
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,110
and I will bring the brother 
in for questioning.

489
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,150
Yes.

490
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,130
I waited out here for half an hour, 
can we talk?

491
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,820
Sure, come in.

492
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,840
Thank you.

493
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,460
Did you hear about the Prime Minister's son?

494
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,820
They are hiding something.

495
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,520
It's shit.

496
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,280
Of course that's not the whole story.

497
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,280
What do you want?

498
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,280
I have something you need to see.

499
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,460
It is the file on the Prime Minister's son.

500
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,460
I wanted to make sure that you got it.

501
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,460
Couldn't it wait till tomorrow

502
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,460
Well

503
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,460
I will not be there tomorrow.

504
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,620
I'm off the case

505
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,570
and I have to stay away,

506
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,910
and I am sorry I behaved like an idiot.

507
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,930
I should have told you everything 
from the beginning,

508
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:14,260
but I really don't know what happened 
to that page in the notebook.

509
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,260
I hope you believe me.

510
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,000
The kidnapping appears to be connected

511
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,800
to an old murder case 
that had been covered up.

512
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,480
How did Zeeland respond to that?

513
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,530
I have been told that the Prime Minister's 
car is now part of the investigation.

514
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:05,970
Well hello.

515
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:06,370
Hi.

516
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,750
What is your name?

517
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,440
Astrid.

518
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,860
Hi Astrid, my name is Christian.

519
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,860
Shall we take some photos?

520
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,260
I have tried to get hold of 
Robert Zeuthen's personal assistant.

521
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,260
I want to explain to him what happened

522
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,110
but he hasn't returned my calls.

523
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,000
Christopher's having a meeting 
with the police right now.

524
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,530
If anybody finds out about it 
then we will call it a briefing.

525
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,130
Thanks, let's just get through this.

526
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,170
How much time?

527
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,170
First up is a tour with Ussing and the press

528
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,400
and then you will talk with 
the children downstairs.

529
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,820
There's something we need to talk about.

530
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,640
I know the school needs an upgrade.

531
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,510
Benjamin was found very late.

532
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,510
There's almost half a day that 
nobody can account for.

533
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,330
He wanted to be alone, Christopher 
already said it was nothing.

534
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,330
He committed suicide

535
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,330
less than two weeks later.

536
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,930
The police will be able to 
put two and two together.

537
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,930
Those events are not connected.

538
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,930
He was depressed.

539
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,310
Hello and welcome.

540
00:26:59,310 --> 00:26:59,640
Thank you.

541
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,460
The children are just about to get ready.

542
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,170
I hope you don't mind waiting 
just a little bit?

543
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:05,770
No, that's fine.

544
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,040
It is here.

545
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,950
Yes

546
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,510
Nice drawings by the children.

547
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,350
The walls look better with a bit of colour.

548
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,350
Definitely.

549
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,750
I must admit I was quite surprised to 
find out that your car was suddenly of interest.

550
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,280
Don't worry is not something that 
I'm going to use for the election campaign.

551
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,280
Thank you.

552
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,280
But do not worry about me.

553
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,800
That's funny, that's what 
my advisers told me.

554
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,620
They thought it would only be 
fair after what you did to me

555
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,620
with the police and I'm a trustworthy witness.

556
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,750
That's up to you and your conscience.

557
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,770
On the other hand

558
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:51,330
the facts are, that the old 
case was being covered up

559
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,550
and somebody had a really good motive.

560
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,350
Let me tell you something.

561
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,800
That you think your brother was 
a bit slow in getting the truth out.

562
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,370
You must also be wondering

563
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,510
whether his good contacts in the ministries

564
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,510
might extend to the Deputy 
Chief Prosecutor as well.

565
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,510
No, I will not

566
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,640
listen to you about these kind of accusations.

567
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,130
We will see, it will be bad 
for your relationship with Zeeland

568
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,130
and the Emilie Zeuthen case

569
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,420
Aren't we starting soon?

570
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,080
We need to cut this short.

571
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
The police need to see you.

572
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,080
What?

573
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,440
I think they suspect that Benjamin 
might be behind the killing.

574
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,770
Benjamin Kamper, high school student

575
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,770
mentally unstable

576
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,770
bipolar aka manic-depressive disorder

577
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,080
politically active on the far left wing

578
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,710
closely associated with Communist 
newspapers and so on,

579
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,220
but after a trip to Jutland

580
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,860
does his condition suddenly deteriorate

581
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,480
to the level that he leaves home

582
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,080
and jumps out in front of a 
freight train a few days later?

583
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,330
Hi you have called Eva, leave a 
message and have a nice day.

584
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:02,080
Benjamin Kamper on the other hand, 
told us that

585
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,950
there is no reason to believe that 
he was near Louise Jelby back then.

586
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,130
Did you find out anything about 
former employees of Zeeland?

587
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:11,330
They are going to give us more information later, 
but we can't wait for that.

588
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,260
Lund

589
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,260
the kidnapper did not contact you

590
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,110
and I'm sure you can figure out 
that there is no future for us here.

591
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,110
If we start digging up old 
wounds without cause

592
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,110
into the Prime Minister's personal 
tragedy in the middle of an election campaign

593
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,310
It'ss got to be him

594
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,750
this would also explain why

595
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,710
you would make a Chief Deputy Prosecutor

596
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,710
cover up the case.

597
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,710
True.

598
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,510
Okay I'll see what I can do

599
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,240
but, it will be the Prime Minister's decision

600
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,510
whether he wants to meet up with us.

601
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,530
Okay.

602
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,910
The file on Benjamin Kamper was very useful

603
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,260
still, I suggest you don't trust 
Mathias Borch in the future.

604
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,680
Is that clear?

605
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,370
The kidnapper has not shown up at 
any of the Internet cafes or libraries.

606
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,640
By the way what is going on with Borch?

607
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,770
He has been taken off the case.

608
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,400
Did you find out anything about Louise's mother

609
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,420
Monica Jelby?

610
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,550
She lived in Skudehavnen.

611
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,550
There is a woman named Birt 
that I'm trying to get hold of.

612
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,730
But, about Borch.

613
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,730
Borch has been taken off the case. 
That's all I know.

614
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,000
Did you have something to do with it?

615
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,260
Is it because you are is still 
angry about what happened in Jutland,

616
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,460
or is it something else I don't know ..

617
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:17,000
Listen up, I have no idea.

618
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,510
Then why is his wife sitting 
outside waiting to talk to you?

619
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,750
Hi, Sarah Lund.

620
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm actually on my way out 
so maybe you can call...

621
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,600
He came back late last night.

622
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,060
He didn't go to bed.

623
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,530
I found him in the living room.

624
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,840
At first I thought it was 
the case that he was working on,

625
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,460
but that's not the case, is it?

626
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,440
He says that

627
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,840
that he loves somebody else.

628
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,150
It's you I presume?

629
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,420
Were you together

630
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,420
when you were in Jutland?

631
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,350
Are you in love with him?

632
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,600
It might be that you have been lovers before

633
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,330
and still have feelings for 
each other or something

634
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,770
but we have two girls together

635
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,770
and he's their father.

636
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,350
Stay away from him.

637
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,480
Lund,  let's go

638
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,480
we got the go-ahead from the Ministry of State.

639
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,480
Okay.

640
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,370
You have our full support

641
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,550
but we do have a business to run.

642
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,080
Can we talk about this some other time?

643
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,110
You are unable to take care of 
the daily running of the business.

644
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,330
For good reason I might add,

645
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,150
but it does create an uncertainty 
throughout the company.

646
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,440
We need to show strong leadership.

647
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,060
That is the reason why we 
would like you to step down

648
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,530
and let the board appoint a new CEO.

649
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,530
I have always been able to count 
on your full support.

650
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,370
You still have that.

651
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,000
Then you must know that I cannot 
accept that Zeeland moves abroad.

652
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,570
There are reasons to reconsider.

653
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,280
Have you seen today's newspapers?

654
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,600
At this point, we'll stick to the 
agreement we made to the government

655
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,040
Zeeland, stays in Denmark.

656
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,040
The Ministry of State is 
under police investigation.

657
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,550
My duties can be covered by 
the rest of the executives,

658
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,260
and if they can't

659
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,970
then we hired the wrong people.

660
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,240
Make sure it works.

661
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,220
I will make sure that Gidlsford understands

662
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,220
that for now he needs to take 
these things up with me.

663
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,510
I will arrange a meeting with him.

664
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,150
Thank you.

665
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,400
Besides that, anything else?

666
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,800
With regards to Emilie

667
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,640
they think they can narrow 
the search down to

668
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,400
15 ships and six terminals around Europe

669
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,640
What is missing?

670
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,730
Even with the payment,

671
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,640
it is still difficult to get access 
to some ships and terminals.

672
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,770
Rotterdam, Hamburg, Stavanger, and St Petersburg.

673
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,770
The police say that they can't intervene.

674
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,350
I will personally go and talk to 
each of the shipping operators.

675
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,020
Please prepare my jet.

676
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,020
I will take care of Hamburg and Rotterdam,

677
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,530
you can take Stavanger and St Petersburg.

678
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,530
Yes, understood

679
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,770
My brother kept the fact that Benjamin

680
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,370
was driven to Jutland in the minister's car,

681
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,660
until yesterday,  hidden from me.

682
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,480
He wanted to protect me and my family.

683
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,040
It was an error of judgement from his side

684
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,170
and that is regrettable

685
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,680
 but I have nothing else to add.

686
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,880
Your son took off in the car

687
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,130
at the same time as a local girl disappeared

688
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,620
she was held captive, raped, and killed

689
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,530
at an abandoned shipbuilders.

690
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,280
The Prime Minister has been made aware 
of the old murder case, thank you

691
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,280
It is my understanding that 
your son was manic-depressive.

692
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:52,000
How did he feel the following 
days after that episode in Jutland

693
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,000
anything other than ordinary?

694
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,000
No, not really.

695
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,570
Were you in contact with him?

696
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,330
Yes

697
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,370
You were talking?

698
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,370
Yes,  of course we were talking.

699
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:05,020
There were times, he became reclusive

700
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,750
but neither me or my former wife 
noticed anything out of the ordinary.

701
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,600
So you just saw it as a depressive phase?

702
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,040
It was a depressive phase.

703
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,750
He had stopped taking his medication 
and we only noticed too late

704
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,310
Okay, anything else?

705
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,640
We had a look at what Benjamin was doing 
the weeks after he got back from Jutland.

706
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,930
He skips classes significantly 
more frequently than before.

707
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:29,570
He's also absent from his part-time job

708
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:33,220
and he's buying a lot of  wine 
and hard alcohol, according to his classmates.

709
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,200
How did you get this information?

710
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,860
Lots of symptoms indicating 
that things were not okay

711
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:40,400
Still you didn't think it was 
anything out of the ordinary?

712
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,400
We just assumed that it was his disease.

713
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,040
My former wife and I are 
not trained physicians

714
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,280
I was also absent a lot back then.

715
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,750
Had his condition made him 
act like this before?

716
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,240
I believe the Prime Minister 
has answered all relevant questions.

717
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,110
The problem is that Benjamin himself

718
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,510
expressed that there was something that 
had happened that he couldn't go on living.

719
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,880
He showed up on the psychiatric ward

720
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,130
the night before he disappeared

721
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,130
at Fredericksburg hospital

722
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,110
he expressed distress and wanted 
to be checked in by them.

723
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:10,550
He was informed by the staff that 
he was under the legal age

724
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,170
and therefore needed his parents' approval.

725
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,510
He then left the ward, but before that

726
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,840
he repeatedly told the psychiatrist on duty

727
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,280
and I quote

728
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,420
'he had done something that his father

729
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,130
would never be able to forgive him for'.

730
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,800
He was then advised by 
the psychiatrist on duty

731
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,800
to go home and talk to his father.

732
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,800
Did he do that?

733
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,240
On this specific evening

734
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,510
I came home very late.

735
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,330
I thought everybody was asleep

736
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,640
but Benjamin

737
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,640
was awake and..

738
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,640
he came downstairs.

739
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,640
Hmm

740
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:08,800
He asked if we could sit in 
the kitchen and talk.

741
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:13,440
We hadn't done that for very long time

742
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,910
so I was very happy.

743
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:26,970
He had difficulties expressing 
what he wanted to say

744
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,970
and I was very tired.

745
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,330
In the end he said that it didn't matter

746
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,710
and then he went upstairs

747
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,710
to his room.

748
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,600
The next morning when I woke up

749
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,710
I made breakfast

750
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,710
then I went to his room to 
try and wake him up.

751
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,170
The bed was empty, he was gone.

752
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,350
It might not be significant, 
he was often like that

753
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,200
reclusive, restless..

754
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,550
If your son committed the murder

755
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,510
it is most likely that the evidence 
will still be in the car

756
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:10,840
and our forensic team is capable of 
finding evidence that is several years old

757
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,620
even if somebody tried to remove it.

758
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,820
He did not do it.

759
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,480
It is completely ridiculous to sit here and

760
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,110
Stop it!

761
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,110
What did Benjamin say to you that night?

762
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,110
did he say anything that 
resembled a confession?

763
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,420
Did he say anything about the girl?

764
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,350
It doesn't matter what Benjamin Kamper said

765
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,570
because he is innocent.

766
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:28,910
The hard drive that was stolen 
from the Ministry of State

767
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,910
was found at an Internet cafe 15 minutes ago.

768
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,660
The kidnapper read the contents of the hard drive

769
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,880
and it confirms that

770
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,510
the minister's car was never near 
the crime scene nor the harbour.

771
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,510
And what evidence do you have to support that?

772
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,510
You can see where the car 
had been on the map here

773
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,080
the car had a GPS tracker installed

774
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,370
and all the data was on the hard drive.

775
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,370
I'm deeply sorry that you had to go through this.

776
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,170
I expect an official statement from 
the police clearing the Prime Minister ASAP

777
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,440
and I trust you won't waste any more time.

778
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,840
What happened?

779
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,840
Did you put pressure on him?

780
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,460
What did they say?

781
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,910
The minister's car was never 
anywhere near the crime scene

782
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,910
the GPS proves it

783
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,570
GPS, what GPS?

784
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:32,550
We don't know the whereabouts of 
the kidnapper of Emile Zeuthen.

785
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,420
We have nothing

786
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,640
Stop it, your are not going to 
give up just because of a GPS.

787
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,170
Did you ask him about...

788
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:38,170
Yes, I asked him

789
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,620
and if you have any doubt

790
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,620
then you're more then welcome to 
go up there and ask him yourself.

791
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,260
What about the kidnapper?

792
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,060
Do you have the notebook?

793
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,260
We have checked all 13 cars from that day,

794
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,420
there is nothing

795
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,420
Can I have the notebook?

796
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,080
One of the owners of the 13 cars

797
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,930
an old woman

798
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,570
kept insisting that her car was never 
anywhere near Jutland on that day.

799
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:11,510
So we have to go back and verify 
everything from the beginning.

800
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,510
Your wife came to see me today.

801
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,480
I don't want that...

802
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,330
don't destroy anything.

803
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,150
Hello

804
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,930
I am outside the Internet café 
where we found the hard drive.

805
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:38,510
The kidnapper has had about 
30 minutes to get away

806
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,770
and he has likely found out that the 
information on the hard drive is irrelevant

807
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,170
so he's probably not in a very good mood.

808
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:42,640
Okay.

809
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,020
I'll see if I can find some witnesses.

810
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,550
Birte, the woman who knew Monica Jelby

811
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,710
is at Skudehavnen right now.

812
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,130
I will go out there but I 
can't do everything on my own.

813
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,130
Okay, great.

814
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,460
I need to go now

815
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,460
Sarah, the kidnapper's not going to give up.

816
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,460
Neither should you.

817
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,460
I have to go now.

818
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,680
Leading up to when he left, 
you saw somebody by the computers?

819
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,530
Sure

820
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,660
lots of people are by the computers 
I don't know who they are.

821
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,660
But the hard drive...

822
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,750
What about that girl?

823
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,750
Do think she saw something?

824
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:40,260
The kidnapper was last seen here

825
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,310
a witness saw him driving 
around in a blue estate car.

826
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,910
Check if any have been reported 
stolen within the past 24 hours.

827
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:48,950
He is severely injured he 
will seek treatment.

828
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:51,480
Hospitals, emergency rooms, 
we need to check everything again.

829
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,970
The only thing that you will do is 
to sit down and wait for briefing from DSIS.

830
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:00,150
You gave the go-ahead for me to go on TV.

831
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,660
Fom this point on, it will 
be DSIS that is in charge

832
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,220
you will do as they ask you to,

833
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,530
and make sure you get Sarah Lund under control

834
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,530
Get her to make the coffee

835
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,080
If I'm going to clean up your mess

836
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,460
Get back to work.

837
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,260
What are you looking at?

838
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,260
We'll continue until we get it in writing.

839
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,080
The plane is ready.

840
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,060
You'll be in Rotterdam before 6 o'clock.

841
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,060
I have notified the shipping 
operator of your arrival.

842
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,460
I am going out to see Gidlsford right now

843
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,000
and then I'll go back home to pack.

844
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,880
Thank you,  it's very nice of you.

845
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,820
Annett and the girls are 
staying at the house in France

846
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,820
so I might as well do something useful.

847
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,150
I will keep you updated.

848
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,400
Thank you.

849
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,730
Mr. Zeuthen can I disturb you for second?

850
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,620
A witness has shown up at reception.

851
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,620
Who?

852
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,330
A sailor from Sweden.

853
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,330
I think he might have seen something.

854
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,020
He is in a room here.

855
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,860
What is it that you have seen?

856
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:01,420
I was out sailing four days ago

857
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,220
It was about 3 a.m. and it was freezing.

858
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:10,710
Suddenly I heard a speedboat 
going very fast

859
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:15,150
and it didn't have any lanterns 
and that was a bit strange.

860
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:18,680
I passed by coastal vessel shortly after.

861
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,600
I saw the speedboat next to the vessel,

862
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:32,400
and then I saw a man together with 
a small child boarding the ship.

863
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,040
Why did you contact us and not the police?

864
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:41,060
I tried but I couldn't get through

865
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,020
So you claim that you saw my daughter 
in the middle of the ocean

866
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,930
in a sail boat in very strong wind

867
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,930
in complete darkness at 3 o'clock?

868
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,930
Yes.

869
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,480
Escort this man out.

870
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:03,600
150 cm high, 40 kg and long blonde hair.

871
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:09,860
Black wellingtons, blue raincoat, 
and no life preserver.

872
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,350
I could see this because I 
was only 30 to 40 m away

873
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,080
a work light was on,  so I 
could see everything clearly.

874
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,480
I don't know if I should tell you...

875
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,930
What?

876
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,970
It looked like she was waving.

877
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,440
What was the name of the vessel?

878
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,620
I would like to sort out 
some formalities first.

879
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,240
If what you're saying is true

880
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,020
then you will get the reward 
without any delays

881
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:50,820
I would like to get some kind 
of assurance of that.

882
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:57,260
Written agreement and 2% upfront.

883
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,510
We do not have cash here.

884
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:01,510
I can wait.

885
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:04,420
I will get the process going, tell me more.

886
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:10,060
I prefer to wait.

887
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:28,350
Can I get you something?

888
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:31,770
A cup of tea with milk.

889
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:32,570
Okay.

890
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:34,240
Thank you

891
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,020
Are you Birte?

892
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:58,060
Who's asking?

893
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,060
Sarah Lund.

894
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:04,020
You knew Monica Jelby 
the mother of Louise

895
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:07,330
She was my tenant for 10 years

896
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:09,330
up  there

897
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,240
Monica showed up one day

898
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,240
she was pregnant

899
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,240
with her nose in the air

900
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,480
She said she only needed a place 
to stay for three months but

901
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,200
but she just kept on staying?

902
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,200
What about Louise's dad 
did you meet him?

903
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:34,440
No, in the beginning she talked about 
a guy who was going to come and get her

904
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,570
but I have heard that story before.

905
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,800
Do know if she had any contact 
with the father?

906
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,680
No.

907
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,840
Did a guy ever come here?

908
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,350
After she died

909
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:46,420
a guy came

910
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,330
Who was it?

911
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:48,880
He just said that he was an old friend.

912
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,330
What did he want

913
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,150
Information, he asked after Monica

914
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,150
And?

915
00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:00,840
I told him that he could find 
her in a grave at the cemetery.

916
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,620
Did he ask about anything else?

917
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:06,840
No, I just told him that 
Louise was in an orphanage.

918
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,330
Can you describe how he looked, 
anything special?

919
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,280
No, I don't remember.

920
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:15,280
Regular guy,

921
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,280
but it didn't sound like he knew 
that Monica had a daughter.

922
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,280
I never saw him again.

923
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,480
Hello, this is Eva Laursen's midwife

924
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,260
I don't know if you remember meeting me,

925
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,770
Yes, but the timing is not so good

926
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,080
I just want to know if you could 
help us get hold of your son Mark?

927
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:33,950
Why?

928
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:37,240
Eva Laursen is at the hospital with cramps.

929
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,240
It's likely that she will deliver prematurely.

930
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,860
Is it serious?

931
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,910
We can't tell yet, but we would 
really like to get hold of Mark.

932
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:46,370
Hello?

933
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:49,220
I will try to get hold of him.

934
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,220
Thank you, goodbye

935
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,460
I'm sorry but I have to leave now

936
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,800
but I'm sending out a colleague 
to hear more about that orphanage.

937
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,240
I don't know much, I only know 
that it was a public orphanage.

938
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,310
Monica got that "family fund"

939
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,730
but maybe that's not important.

940
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:14,260
What "family fund"?

941
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:17,400
It was some time before she died

942
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:21,130
Well, she knew she was near the end

943
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:24,000
she wanted to do something for Louise.

944
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:27,840
I helped write applications

945
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:31,420
and when she got a positive reply from

946
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,680
Zeeland's family fund

947
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,020
she was so happy.

948
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,280
What fund?

949
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,200
Zeeland?

950
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,220
Yes

951
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:40,640
for helping people like Monica 
who are alone with a child.

952
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,310
Might be that the family Zeuthen
are loaded with money

953
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:47,170
but you still feel a 
little sad for them.

954
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:50,930
They help so many children and then 
they have to go through this with their own.

955
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,060
No matter what the prime minister claims

956
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,570
he still owes the voters a proper account

957
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:05,550
of the government's involvement in 
the tragic kidnapping case of Emilie Zeuthen.

958
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,480
Look, the government is neither responsible 
for the current financial crisis nor the kidnapping

959
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,930
to suggest that is..

960
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:11,930
There is a cover-up

961
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:13,020
We can only ask ourselves

962
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,570
if the Prime Minister is actually 
interested in the truth.

963
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:16,080
Could you please switch that off?

964
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,080
Thank you.

965
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:19,880
I have just heard from Zeeland.

966
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,910
And?

967
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:22,530
It sounds like they still have confidence in us

968
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:25,510
and they are still backing the 
government's austerity measures.

969
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:27,510
Karen, back then, in Jutland

970
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,710
did you have any contact with Christopher?

971
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:32,820
No

972
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,820
he did not tell me anything, why?

973
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,200
The police are right.

974
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,910
Benjamin did change

975
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,600
I do not know why you couldn't see it

976
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,150
in hindsight it's very clear.

977
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:54,130
Hindsight is always 20/20

978
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,680
don't get yourself worked up

979
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,680
it's only guesswork from the police.

980
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,240
Christopher has accounted for what happened.

981
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,240
You loved your son

982
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,600
and I'm sure he knew that.

983
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,730
We saw the debate on TV.

984
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:42,130
Great work with Ussing.

985
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:43,040
What really happened?

986
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,280
I know something happened 
with Benjamin over there

987
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,280
I just want to know what?

988
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,280
Well..

989
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,730
Stop it.

990
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:57,730
For fuck's sake, what happened?

991
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,820
He called me from the bus terminal.

992
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,820
I went over there to talk to him, 
but he was out of his mind.

993
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,860
Did he do something to the girl, or..

994
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,220
Of course he didn't

995
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:11,220
but something had happened 
that triggered an episode.

996
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,930
He said he had been driving around

997
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:14,460
looking for you and the campaign wagon

998
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,800
so he could make a spectacle 
in front of the press.

999
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,770
Apparently he saw something that 
he thought was important to tell us.

1000
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:18,550
What was it?

1001
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:21,570
It was some incoherent, typical 
left-wing conspiracy nonsense

1002
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:23,510
that we are all just kissing 
big business arses.

1003
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:24,750
What happened?

1004
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:26,330
Why didn't you let me deal with it?

1005
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,330
Because I thought he should leave you alone

1006
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:30,080
he would only fuck things up.

1007
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,350
I know he was in difficulties

1008
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:32,750
but you have fought so 
hard for this election

1009
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:33,840
and I wouldn't let him ruin that.

1010
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,840
What did you do?

1011
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:38,350
He was a risk being near the press.

1012
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:41,080
I put him on a bus to Copenhagen 
to get his act together.

1013
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:42,440
Get his act  together?

1014
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,460
He threatened to go to the press

1015
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,860
they would have eaten it up.

1016
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,860
It was for his own sake, he was crazy

1017
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,110
What did he see?

1018
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,750
Answer.

1019
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,170
He had seen Karen.

1020
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:02,950
She was in Zeeland's pockets and held 
meetings with them behind your back.

1021
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:04,950
What meetings?

1022
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:12,860
Just some, guy but he didn't even know who.

1023
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:19,620
The money and the contract is on the way.

1024
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,110
Thank you.

1025
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:22,880
Reinhart told me to tell you that the 
meeting with the chairman went well.

1026
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,640
Thank you.

1027
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,710
Where is he, I want to speak to him.

1028
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,240
He won't say any more until 
he gets the money

1029
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,910
but we checked out his ID 
and everything seems fine.

1030
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:32,420
The police are here.

1031
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,570
I've told them about the witness so 
they can start the questioning as soon as possible.

1032
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:36,680
I don't believe I called the police

1033
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,150
I know, we need to verify the 
information with the police

1034
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:40,970
before we..

1035
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,440
He gave a description of her blue raincoat

1036
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,440
and that's enough for me.

1037
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,040
He could not know anything about that

1038
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,240
blue raincoat, it was found at 
the kidnapper's hide out.

1039
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,240
She had likely changed into something else.

1040
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:58,240
Where is he?

1041
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,530
He asked direction to the basement parking.

1042
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,550
He said he needed to pick 
something up from his car.

1043
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:06,200
Seal the building.

1044
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,240
Robert, what is happening?

1045
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:21,910
Where is he?

1046
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:23,910
He accessed one of our computers.

1047
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,130
Juncker here

1048
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:27,130
we need backup at Zeeleand

1049
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:29,130
the kidnapper might still 
be in the building.

1050
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,200
I was told I could find you at home.

1051
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,240
I've tried calling you.

1052
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,640
I'm about to leave

1053
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,640
we have sent you the 
information you requested.

1054
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,950
We did not find anything in them.

1055
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:55,040
I have a few questions that are very urgent

1056
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,040
it's about Zeeland's  children's fund.

1057
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,040
If we can sort it out while I lock up

1058
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,680
Zeeland's  children's fund 
is part of our CSR strategy.

1059
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,040
We take social responsibility 
and helps those in need.

1060
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,970
We help children in several countries

1061
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:13,970
but why is that relevant?

1062
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:16,200
Because the girl from the old case

1063
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,200
was placed in an orphanage named Mayfarm

1064
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,200
the was sponsored by your fund for children.

1065
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,310
The orphanage has been closed down so we 
have been unable to find information from back then.

1066
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:25,310
The fund must have had good reasons.

1067
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:28,110
They continuously find out what is best for the children

1068
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:29,400
but I need to catch a flight.

1069
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,150
I believe the kidnapper contacted that 
orphanage in order to find his daughter.

1070
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,170
There must be something in 
her file from back then.

1071
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:37,860
It might even have his name

1072
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:40,440
and since it was your fund 
that ran the orphanage

1073
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,530
then there is a chance that they 
might have a copy of the records.

1074
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:49,330
It's important, I need this file 
if I going to find Emilie

1075
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,400
I will try to see if I can find 
somebody you can contact.

1076
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:57,400
Thank you

1077
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:22,800
Hello

1078
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,800
It's Borch

1079
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,750
There is a reason why we 
couldn't find that car.

1080
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,200
We forgot to take in to account

1081
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,200
that those numbers are written 
down by a seven-year-old.

1082
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:33,680
He made a mistake.

1083
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,710
The first letter was the wrong way around

1084
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,570
so instead...

1085
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:47,570
so instead of a Z he wrote S

1086
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:50,840
What that means is that it's a licence plate 
that we have never been looking for before

1087
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,510
and you will not believe it.

1088
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:55,510
It's a Zeeland car

1089
00:55:56,930 --> 00:56:00,480
and the car belongs to Reinholdt

1090
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,480
Robert Zeuthen's personal assistant.

1091
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:05,330
Can you hear what I'm saying?

1092
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:07,060
It's Reinholdt.

1093
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:10,910
He has known the whole time that 
it was him we were looking for.

1094
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:17,550
Name and phone number.

1095
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:19,550
Where are you?

1096
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:20,040
Sarah?

1097
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,950
She is the head of Administration, 
she should be able to help you.

1098
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:26,910
I really need to get going now.

1099
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,370
You knew Mayfarm

1100
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:42,130
or, you have been there.

1101
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:45,130
I am the chairman of the fund

1102
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:49,930
I try to bring awareness as 
often as I can.

1103
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:51,930
Did you know her?

1104
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,530
No, not that I can remember.

1105
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,950
Who is it?

1106
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,530
Excuse me

1107
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:09,530
a window might be open.

1108
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:11,350
Stay where you are.
