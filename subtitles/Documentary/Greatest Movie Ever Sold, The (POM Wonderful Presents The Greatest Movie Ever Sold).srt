00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The Greatest Marriage

2
00:00:06,954 --> 00:00:09,853
<i>Episode 11</i>

3
00:00:09,854 --> 00:00:13,502
<i>[3 Years Later]</i>

4
00:00:13,503 --> 00:00:15,383
Cue!

5
00:00:15,384 --> 00:00:17,772
This is '24 Hours of Hope' and
I'm with the rescue team right now!

6
00:00:17,773 --> 00:00:20,437
I'm Cha Ki Young, your reporter
starting today.

7
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:24,808
Right now, the rescue team is on its way
to save a person who fell while hiking.

8
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:30,383
The patient's life depends upon how fast
they will be able to get to the hospital.

9
00:00:30,384 --> 00:00:31,814
Cut!

10
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:34,531
Let's get on the helicopter!

11
00:00:35,278 --> 00:00:38,409
- You want me to ride in the helicopter?
- Of course!

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,663
No one told me that I had
to ride in the helicopter!

13
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:44,009
You have to be in the action
if you want the full story!

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,671
One of the rescue team members will help,
so don't worry and get in!

15
00:00:56,445 --> 00:00:58,426
I don't think I can do it!

16
00:00:58,427 --> 00:01:00,596
You don't have a choice!
We have to record this show!

17
00:01:00,597 --> 00:01:02,490
Are you going to get in or not?

18
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:06,962
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

19
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,056
Hello?

20
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:13,819
Yes, Director?

21
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,693
I'm not in a position
to talk on the phone right now!

22
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:20,768
Today?

23
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:23,541
- I'm going to be late again today.
- What are you doing?

24
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:26,187
Please take good care of Dan for me!

25
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:28,083
I'm sorry!

26
00:01:31,788 --> 00:01:34,981
This is Channel Korea with your
nine o'clock news. My name is Jo Eun Cha...

27
00:01:34,982 --> 00:01:36,839
and Kang Ha Ni.

28
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:41,226
Here is our first story.

29
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:43,378
The three most powerful men in North Korea

30
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:45,399
will be attending the closing ceremony
of the Asian Games.

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,806
Talks between the the North and South
are more active than ever.

32
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:53,346
Reporter Kim Hyung Joon has
the full story from the Blue House.

33
00:01:54,064 --> 00:01:57,071
<i>The possibility of peace between
North and South Korea...</i>

34
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:01,203
What are we to do if reunification happens?

35
00:02:01,778 --> 00:02:05,270
- You hate reunification?
- I totally hate it.

36
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:08,498
We'll have to live with
those poor North Koreans.

37
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:13,302
<i>Also, why are North Korea and
South Korea considered one country?</i>

38
00:02:13,303 --> 00:02:17,582
<i>Americans think we look the same
as the Japanese.</i>

39
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:21,322
She's an anchor. Why is she so clueless?

40
00:02:21,323 --> 00:02:24,121
She's studied in America
since she was young.

41
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:26,164
And she was singled out
to be an announcer.

42
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:28,211
She only looks Korean.

43
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:30,458
Internally, she's completely American.

44
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:32,502
My daughter is also studying abroad.

45
00:02:32,503 --> 00:02:35,060
And I'm afraid she's going
to turn out like her.

46
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:38,150
Director, Eun Cha has changed.

47
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:42,561
In the past, he would've trampled
all over girls like Kang Ha Ni on the spot.

48
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:47,018
That punk. He's just playing nice because
the general elections are coming up.

49
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:50,046
You honestly think people can change?

50
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:57,372
Ma'am, I'm busy right now.
I'll call you later!

51
00:02:57,373 --> 00:02:59,609
What the heck are you doing right now?
Move!

52
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:03,271
Seriously, I'm going nuts here!

53
00:03:06,631 --> 00:03:08,607
Transfer him to the operating room!

54
00:03:10,165 --> 00:03:11,572
Cut!

55
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:13,961
This sucks!
Why did you bring a woman along?

56
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:19,378
We'll refuse to cooperate
if you keep getting in our way like this!

57
00:03:23,506 --> 00:03:25,821
You're not even remotely interested
in the patient's condition.

58
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:28,017
You're only concerned about your child!

59
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:30,208
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,134
The daycare closes at seven and
it's past nine o'clock right now.

61
00:03:34,135 --> 00:03:36,942
The teacher kept calling to say
she was closing.

62
00:03:38,673 --> 00:03:42,828
Then quit your job and
watch your kid instead, okay?

63
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:45,742
I hear this isn't the first time
you screwed over a recording!

64
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:47,674
Your words are a bit harsh.

65
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,803
You think my words are harsh?
What about your actions?

66
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:55,330
Let's just call it quits.

67
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:57,773
Throw away every recording
with Cha Ki Young in it

68
00:03:57,774 --> 00:04:00,194
and let's start all over
by casting someone else.

69
00:04:00,195 --> 00:04:02,088
Let's wrap it up.

70
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:17,865
Ma'am, I just finished wrapping up.
How is Dan doing?

71
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:20,976
We've headed over to commercial.

72
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,553
Hey, Gap Soo.

73
00:04:27,377 --> 00:04:29,048
Kang Ha Ni?

74
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,843
A fashion show MC?

75
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,827
Why would a news anchor
host a fashion show? Hang up!

76
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,015
Why didn't you ask for my opinion first?

77
00:04:40,578 --> 00:04:44,344
I didn't ask for your opinion
when you were placed next to me.

78
00:04:44,345 --> 00:04:47,931
I'm not going to ask for your opinion
when you get fired, either.

79
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:49,867
You have a problem with that?

80
00:05:01,937 --> 00:05:03,550
I'm so sorry!

81
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:08,222
He kept waiting for you at this spot
and he just fell asleep.

82
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,499
I'm so sorry. My work ended
much later than I expected.

83
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,035
I'll take him.

84
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:18,693
Does Dan have other family members?
His grandmother perhaps?

85
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,507
He doesn't have one.

86
00:05:20,508 --> 00:05:22,904
It would be nice if he did.

87
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,175
Dan is a little different
from the other children.

88
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:27,800
In what way?

89
00:05:27,801 --> 00:05:30,864
Boys like to get physical when they play.

90
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:32,987
But Dan's always playing quietly by himself.

91
00:05:32,988 --> 00:05:35,252
He doesn't know how to approach people

92
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:38,297
and I'm wondering if it's because
he only spends time with you.

93
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:42,404
Those symptoms usually appear
in children that lack attention.

94
00:05:43,628 --> 00:05:46,149
He's been a quiet child
ever since he was born.

95
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,999
There are children who are
outgoing by nature

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,865
but there are also children
who are introverts.

97
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:52,486
It's not like I'm going to raise him
to be a professional athlete.

98
00:05:52,487 --> 00:05:57,773
I'm going to raise a child who
loves to read instead of a dumb jock.

99
00:06:51,158 --> 00:06:55,199
All right then, list off
all the clans in our family.

100
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,493
Which generation should
I start from, Father?

101
00:06:57,494 --> 00:06:58,912
Start with the 25th.

102
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:03,686
Jae Shin Kyu from the 25th generation,
Yong San Jong from the 26th generation...

103
00:07:03,687 --> 00:07:09,018
Ho Soo Soon from the 27th generation,
Im Joo Sang from the 28th generation...

104
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:12,970
Yeol Yong Hee from the 29th generation,
Shi Joon from the 30th generation...

105
00:07:12,971 --> 00:07:17,476
Ho Heum Goo from the 31st generation,
Hae Yoon Han from the 32nd generation...

106
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:22,897
Shik Geun Kwon from the 33rd generation,
Hon Eung from the 34th generation.

107
00:07:26,076 --> 00:07:27,926
Good job.

108
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,052
Now, read these characters.

109
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:34,701
Park Eun Chil?

110
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:37,800
This is the name of Tae Yun's son.

111
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,439
Good.

112
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:45,968
Sons are precious in our family.

113
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:48,602
During my father's lifetime,
a monk told us

114
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,876
our lives would be shortened
if we used a family name.

115
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:54,177
That's why I didn't give
Tae Yun a common family name.

116
00:07:54,178 --> 00:07:59,490
But I've decided to begin that tradition
again, starting with Tae Yun's son.

117
00:08:00,118 --> 00:08:02,167
Thank you, Father.

118
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:06,533
Since the short lifespan was
taken care of with your miscarriage...

119
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:10,350
I'm sure we won't have another child
who will die early again.

120
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:16,208
Did something good happen?

121
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:21,455
Mother, Father came up with
a name for our future son.

122
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:24,195
What's the name?

123
00:08:24,847 --> 00:08:27,891
Park Eun Chil.

124
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:30,057
Eun Chil?

125
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:35,087
That's a fine name.

126
00:08:39,868 --> 00:08:44,676
She remembered every family name
when no else could.

127
00:08:44,677 --> 00:08:47,566
We accepted a daughter-in-law
without a son to show for it.

128
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,491
In that sense, it's comfortable.

129
00:08:55,974 --> 00:08:59,537
This the picture
he sent me last night, Mother.

130
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:03,143
Where is this now?

131
00:09:03,144 --> 00:09:05,778
It's a small restaurant in Kyoto, Japan.

132
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,063
He was in Czechoslovakia two months ago.

133
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:12,431
He said he's going to study every cuisine
in the world before he returns.

134
00:09:16,538 --> 00:09:18,994
You must keep this a secret
from your father-in-law.

135
00:09:18,995 --> 00:09:22,652
For all he knows,
Tae Yun is still studying overseas.

136
00:09:22,653 --> 00:09:24,827
Understood?

137
00:09:24,828 --> 00:09:27,173
Yes, Mother.

138
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:37,655
<i>When I open my eyes,
I find this small child next to me.</i>

139
00:09:37,656 --> 00:09:40,336
<i>I still find it unfamiliar and fascinating.</i>

140
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:44,697
<i>I never relied on anyone
from the moment I was born.</i>

141
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:49,720
<i>But now, my whole life
revolves around this child.</i>

142
00:09:58,225 --> 00:10:01,173
- Hey, Mom.
- Is the child growing well?

143
00:10:01,174 --> 00:10:04,168
- Yeah.
- How about work?

144
00:10:04,892 --> 00:10:06,896
Well, it's coming along.

145
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,308
I know it's tough trying to work
while taking care of him.

146
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:13,333
There's no need to suffer like that.
I said I'd take care of him for you.

147
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:15,578
I left so we could live together.

148
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:18,533
That would be meaningless
if I left him in your care.

149
00:10:19,055 --> 00:10:23,426
Also, I won't be able to work more
if I drop him off.

150
00:10:23,427 --> 00:10:25,291
Don't worry, Mom.

151
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:30,105
Alright. Call me right away
if something happens, okay?

152
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:31,801
I will, Mom.

153
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:38,612
Hey, baby.

154
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,281
Baby.

155
00:10:42,282 --> 00:10:44,421
It's time to wake up.

156
00:10:44,422 --> 00:10:48,764
- I don't want to.
- You have to wake up now!

157
00:10:48,765 --> 00:10:50,607
I don't want to.

158
00:10:51,307 --> 00:10:53,194
Let's see here.

159
00:10:54,345 --> 00:10:59,063
You didn't have an accident today!
Good boy, come here!

160
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:09,091
Mom.

161
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:13,277
- Yes?
- Can't you come and pick me up today?

162
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:14,637
Why?

163
00:11:14,638 --> 00:11:20,018
My other friends have their
mom or dad come to pick them up

164
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:22,342
and I was the only that didn't.

165
00:11:30,613 --> 00:11:35,961
In the past, baby bones were discovered
in many of the royal palaces.

166
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:39,315
When night came, the only man was the king.

167
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:44,220
The palace maids would compete fiercely
to put their baby on the throne.

168
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:53,177
They say this yongbong stew
gave energy to the king back then.

169
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:06,104
<i>Here are the pictures
of the child you requested.</i>

170
00:12:07,282 --> 00:12:09,517
<i>I've only been taking pictures
for the past three years.</i>

171
00:12:09,518 --> 00:12:11,878
<i>When do you want me to take action?</i>

172
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:16,837
<i>Just wait and always be ready.</i>

173
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,830
- You stupid bastard.
- Hey!

174
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:45,467
Did you come for a recording?

175
00:12:45,468 --> 00:12:47,382
I hear you're running for election
to the National Assembly?

176
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:49,349
Please help me.

177
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,309
I promise to support you on your comeback
if I get elected to the National Assembly.

178
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,260
You won't get elected
no matter how hard you try.

179
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:56,725
You think anyone can be a politician?

180
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:58,630
You did it too.
Why are you speaking ill of me?

181
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:02,025
Didn't you feel anything when you saw me
get kicked out of the National Assembly?

182
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:06,009
You and I are alpha males to the core.

183
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,656
And we can't live our lives
hiding that fact.

184
00:13:07,657 --> 00:13:09,767
Sixty percent of the voters are women.

185
00:13:09,768 --> 00:13:12,265
How can sexist men like us be elected?

186
00:13:12,797 --> 00:13:16,923
One wrong word makes
the both of us look bad.

187
00:13:16,924 --> 00:13:19,052
Even so, you think we'll be able
to throw away that alpha mentality?

188
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:21,630
That's the very thing that
our fathers passed down.

189
00:13:21,631 --> 00:13:24,267
'Men are the heavens
and women are the Earth.'

190
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:26,841
You may have failed

191
00:13:26,842 --> 00:13:30,113
but I have a trump card that will
help me rack up all the female voters.

192
00:13:30,114 --> 00:13:31,400
What is it?

193
00:13:31,401 --> 00:13:35,495
I'm an alpha male disguised as a feminist.

194
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:39,421
Let's just say I'm a wolf posing
as an innocent sheep.

195
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:47,514
I only picked women with bad performance
evaluations who have children.

196
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:50,349
Cha Ki Young is ranked
number one on the list?

197
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,199
She's been ranked last for the past
three years with her evaluations.

198
00:13:54,736 --> 00:13:56,215
Let me take a look.

199
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,729
Goodness, how did she come to be like this?

200
00:14:05,624 --> 00:14:10,326
All the decent ones are gone,
and only the useless ones are left.

201
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:13,935
Who would stay when everyone's
salaries were cut by 30 percent?

202
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,744
Five of our ace reporters quit
just last month alone.

203
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:21,012
Do you have something in mind?

204
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:24,681
We have no choice if we want
to save the company.

205
00:14:24,682 --> 00:14:28,015
Get rid of all the useless
people like Cha Ki Young

206
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:30,932
and give all the decent workers
their original wages back.

207
00:14:32,415 --> 00:14:34,526
Is that the only solution?

208
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,416
I hear Cha Ki Young is struggling
to take care of her child.

209
00:14:40,758 --> 00:14:44,181
The company is in danger
because you're so soft-hearted!

210
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:46,130
Ho Pyung, you need to toughen up!

211
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,168
Money has been tight ever since our
wages were cut by 30 percent.

212
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:01,138
I'm pretty much at zero after
I pay the monthly loan interest.

213
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,739
I thought your ex-husband
was helping you with that?

214
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,318
Nurse Jung is the office wife.

215
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:08,437
She has a tight hold on
the hospital's purse strings.

216
00:15:08,438 --> 00:15:11,216
I'm even paying for all the
apartment maintenance fees on my own.

217
00:15:11,716 --> 00:15:13,589
It pisses me off the more I think about it.

218
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:17,354
Hurry up and end it with him
while Ara is studying overseas.

219
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:25,657
It's been three years since we put our home
on the market and he still won't leave.

220
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,905
Have you ever heard of
a woman that still lives with

221
00:15:27,906 --> 00:15:30,944
her ex-husband just because
their place hasn't been sold?

222
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,586
Raising a child is so expensive.

223
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:39,562
I realized that money is more important
than love when it comes to raising a child.

224
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:44,597
Hello?

225
00:15:44,598 --> 00:15:47,978
Cha Ki Young, this is the news station.
We need to talk.

226
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:49,396
Right now?

227
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:50,815
It's important.

228
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:58,147
I need to go to the news station.
He says it's important.

229
00:15:58,148 --> 00:16:01,249
He probably wants you
to fill in for a minor program again.

230
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:04,278
What are you going to do about Dan?

231
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,648
I can't drop him off anywhere
on this short of notice.

232
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:08,668
I guess I'll just have to take him with me.

233
00:16:10,018 --> 00:16:12,463
Mom, where are we?

234
00:16:12,464 --> 00:16:15,179
It's the news station I work for.

235
00:16:21,343 --> 00:16:22,947
Let's go in.

236
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,701
Don't go anywhere and stay right here.
I'll be right back, okay?

237
00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:34,057
Okay.

238
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:43,822
Hello.

239
00:16:43,823 --> 00:16:45,432
- You're here.
- Yes.

240
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:46,944
Sit down.

241
00:16:50,587 --> 00:16:52,156
Cha Ki Young.

242
00:16:52,157 --> 00:16:55,734
You know I'm not good at
beating around the bush, right?

243
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:59,766
The is usually the Director's job to do.

244
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:02,672
But he's too soft-hearted,
so he handed it over to me.

245
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:10,575
<i>[Reconstruction List]</i>

246
00:17:12,137 --> 00:17:14,311
Why is my name on the very top?

247
00:17:14,312 --> 00:17:18,686
You've been ranked last for the past three
years with the worst employee evaluation.

248
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,629
You used to be so greedy for work.
How did you come to be like this?

249
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,821
You're always making mistakes
because of your child.

250
00:17:24,822 --> 00:17:26,646
Forgive me.

251
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:30,499
All the producers held a meeting
and agreed not to cast you.

252
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,105
No one wants to cast you.

253
00:17:32,105 --> 00:17:33,410
You're the number one person
everyone wants fired.

254
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,426
- Good job, everyone.
- What else can we give you to work on?

255
00:17:36,427 --> 00:17:38,290
Sit down and continue what you were doing.

256
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:46,065
Eun Cha, you're here.

257
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,072
You should talk about
stuff like that on the roof.

258
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:50,091
What is this?
You're disturbing everyone.

259
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:53,817
I'll do what I can to find a position
for you in the next reorganization

260
00:17:53,818 --> 00:17:56,590
if you leave of your own free will.

261
00:17:56,591 --> 00:17:58,503
Turn in your letter of resignation
by next week.

262
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:10,976
Cha Ki Young, long time no see.

263
00:18:13,452 --> 00:18:17,357
I thought you quit the station.
I haven't seen you at all.

264
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:29,243
Dan.

265
00:18:29,857 --> 00:18:31,229
Dan.

266
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,589
Excuse me, but have you seen
a little boy about this tall?

267
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,010
No, I haven't.

268
00:18:36,962 --> 00:18:38,687
Dan!

269
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:56,720
There was a little tadpole
squirming in the river.

270
00:18:56,721 --> 00:18:58,551
- It swam up the river.
- What is this?

271
00:18:58,552 --> 00:19:00,411
Who are you?

272
00:19:00,412 --> 00:19:02,912
Where's your mom?
I said where's your mom?

273
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:04,940
- Huh?
- And it became a frog.

274
00:19:04,941 --> 00:19:08,615
Here's a phone number.
Someone call this number quickly.

275
00:19:11,389 --> 00:19:13,201
So irresponsible.
How on earth did a child get in here?

276
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:15,698
Cha Dan? Is your name Dan?

277
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,110
Dan!

278
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:21,425
Dan!

279
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,274
Hello?

280
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:26,107
Are you the mother of this boy, Cha Dan?

281
00:19:26,108 --> 00:19:28,698
- Yes!
- This is the news studio.

282
00:19:28,699 --> 00:19:30,666
Please come quickly and take your child.

283
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:32,104
Okay!

284
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,338
Hey, you can't climb on top of there!
Come down this instant!

285
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:38,635
Dan!

286
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,552
Come down!

287
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:42,673
- What is this?
- Dan!

288
00:19:42,674 --> 00:19:45,248
Seriously, I have to report the news soon!

289
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:49,091
What are you doing?

290
00:19:49,092 --> 00:19:52,185
You're not supposed to clean a silk skirt
with a cheap brand like that!

291
00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:55,065
And how could you let
your child come in here?

292
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:59,054
Why did you have a child on your own
when you can't even manage it?

293
00:19:59,055 --> 00:20:02,603
You're really a disgrace
to all the announcers!

294
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:13,155
I'm weak when it comes to women with
pretty faces and nice bodies like you.

295
00:20:13,156 --> 00:20:15,181
But I won't stand for mutiny
against your seniors!

296
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:18,183
Anchor Cha deserves your utmost
respect and honor! Understood?

297
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:21,418
Go and change into
a shorter skirt right now.

298
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:25,857
The only reason you're even in
this position is those long legs of yours.

299
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,720
Get out this instant!

300
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,628
815, do you remember Daddy?

301
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:40,596
- Dad?
- That's right.

302
00:20:40,597 --> 00:20:43,241
I cut your umbilical cord
when you were born.

303
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,380
And we almost lost you when
your mom tried to protect this position.

304
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:49,381
I was the one who saved you.

305
00:20:50,268 --> 00:20:52,380
Dan, let's go.

306
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:55,884
- Dad!
- That's right, I'm your dad!

307
00:20:57,755 --> 00:20:59,605
I'm your dad.

308
00:21:04,453 --> 00:21:07,567
Call me anytime if anything happens to Dan!

309
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:09,581
It's only because
you're not requesting my help.

310
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:13,482
But as a surrogate father,
I'm ready to be Dan's dad.

311
00:21:13,483 --> 00:21:15,302
Anytime.

312
00:21:16,682 --> 00:21:19,917
Is that man really my dad?

313
00:21:19,918 --> 00:21:21,243
No.

314
00:21:22,256 --> 00:21:23,914
He looks like my dad.

315
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:27,344
I told you that I'm your mom and dad.

316
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:29,124
But you're a woman, though.

317
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,342
Do you want a dad that's a man?

318
00:21:32,087 --> 00:21:33,431
Yes.

319
00:21:34,147 --> 00:21:37,884
But male fathers will scold
and spank you all the time.

320
00:21:37,885 --> 00:21:41,696
Still... I want one.

321
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:47,661
Dan.

322
00:21:47,662 --> 00:21:49,993
Shall we run a kimbap business?

323
00:21:49,994 --> 00:21:51,906
You love cooking.

324
00:21:51,907 --> 00:21:56,492
You can be with me all day
if we run a kimbap business.

325
00:21:56,493 --> 00:21:58,785
That sounds good, Mom.

326
00:22:20,992 --> 00:22:22,471
Hello?

327
00:22:22,472 --> 00:22:25,881
<i>- Hi, this is the owner.
- Yes?</i>

328
00:22:25,882 --> 00:22:29,255
<i>Your lease will be expiring soon.</i>

329
00:22:29,256 --> 00:22:33,709
Ah...
I'd like to extend the lease contract.

330
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:38,269
<i>Ah... then you'll have to pay
an additional 50 million won.</i>

331
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,283
50 million won?

332
00:22:40,284 --> 00:22:42,201
<i>Ask around in that area.</i>

333
00:22:42,201 --> 00:22:43,925
<i>Everyone's rent has increased
by that much.</i>

334
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:47,389
I'll call you later.

335
00:22:54,052 --> 00:22:56,572
It's one obstacle after another.

336
00:23:02,062 --> 00:23:05,220
<i>[Jo Eun Cha]</i>

337
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:21,822
What's going to happen to Cha Ki Young's
anchor position if you get elected?

338
00:23:21,823 --> 00:23:24,015
Why? You want it?

339
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:29,975
If you back me, I promise to live
as your faithful servant.

340
00:23:31,722 --> 00:23:34,959
I can't choose whoever I want
for the main anchor position.

341
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:39,672
We all know you're in charge of
the news and personnel appointments.

342
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,671
But, why are your hands so stiff?

343
00:23:44,672 --> 00:23:47,412
It should be done my a woman
if you want a decent massage.

344
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:51,923
Kang Ha Ni, are you doing
a good job on my article?

345
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:54,384
Yes.

346
00:23:54,385 --> 00:23:58,003
Make sure my article is better than yours.

347
00:24:00,424 --> 00:24:04,001
What do women think about Cha Ki Young?

348
00:24:04,002 --> 00:24:06,091
You saw what happened yesterday.

349
00:24:06,092 --> 00:24:09,367
What about other women besides you?
Are there a lot of haters?

350
00:24:09,368 --> 00:24:12,249
She has a lot of female fans
that don't know anything.

351
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,573
Still?

352
00:24:13,574 --> 00:24:16,099
Even though she gets
the cold shoulder at work

353
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,635
she's considered a hero among feminists
and the general female population.

354
00:24:18,636 --> 00:24:21,249
They say she's a pioneer
ahead of the times.

355
00:24:21,854 --> 00:24:24,417
She's branded as the Korean Angelina Jolie.

356
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:27,879
I like the sound of that.

357
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,363
The Korean Angelina Jolie.

358
00:24:33,194 --> 00:24:35,388
<i>[Cha Ki Young]</i>

359
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:38,153
I swear, she and I are always
on the same wavelength.

360
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:41,816
Hello?

361
00:24:42,518 --> 00:24:44,730
It's me, Cha Ki Young.

362
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:47,114
And?

363
00:24:47,115 --> 00:24:49,235
I need to talk to you.

364
00:24:49,236 --> 00:24:51,084
What is it?

365
00:24:51,085 --> 00:24:53,270
I'd like to talk to you face-to-face.

366
00:24:54,184 --> 00:24:56,005
I'm busy.

367
00:24:56,006 --> 00:25:00,681
<i>- I'll call you some other time then.
- Today, between five and six o'clock...</i>

368
00:25:00,682 --> 00:25:03,042
I only have an hour to spare.

369
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:07,852
Well, the daycare ends at four o'clock.

370
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:09,958
Bring 815 with you.

371
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:11,964
Thank you.

372
00:25:12,673 --> 00:25:14,378
The station isn't ideal.

373
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,385
I'll text you the address
so come to that place.

374
00:25:24,935 --> 00:25:27,216
Aw, my son is here!

375
00:25:30,311 --> 00:25:32,329
You got so big!

376
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,311
Sit, sit!

377
00:25:35,276 --> 00:25:38,488
This is my campaign office.
It hasn't been long since it was set up.

378
00:25:39,735 --> 00:25:41,854
You've gotten so handsome.

379
00:25:44,953 --> 00:25:48,617
Here we go again. You're fidgeting
and can't look me in the eyes.

380
00:25:48,618 --> 00:25:50,731
You came to ask for a favor, didn't you?

381
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,136
You get nervous and can't speak
if there's a favor to ask.

382
00:25:57,941 --> 00:25:59,173
The thing is...

383
00:25:59,174 --> 00:26:01,860
You have to be thick-skinned
if you're going to raise a child.

384
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:04,033
The same goes for favors as well.

385
00:26:06,452 --> 00:26:09,938
My lease ends next month

386
00:26:09,939 --> 00:26:13,156
and the owner wants
an additional 50 million won.

387
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:15,145
You want to borrow money from me?

388
00:26:15,722 --> 00:26:17,879
I need to get a loan for the extra money.

389
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,031
But I won't be able to if I get laid off.

390
00:26:21,032 --> 00:26:22,388
So?

391
00:26:22,389 --> 00:26:24,814
- If you can...
- If I can what?

392
00:26:25,511 --> 00:26:28,942
- If you can help me.
- How am I supposed to help you?

393
00:26:28,943 --> 00:26:31,730
You're the first one
on the list to get laid off.

394
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:34,676
You're not even second. How am I supposed
to save the first person to go?

395
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:40,454
815, I'm going to cover your ears
for just a moment, okay?

396
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,149
Get on your knees in front of me.

397
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,338
Pardon?

398
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:47,426
I'll save you if you cry and beg
on your knees.

399
00:26:49,435 --> 00:26:50,963
You can't do it, can you?

400
00:26:51,894 --> 00:26:54,635
You don't even have the courage
to get down on your knees.

401
00:26:54,636 --> 00:26:55,869
Then why did you spout
all that nonsense

402
00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:57,285
about how you can raise
a child all on your own?

403
00:26:57,286 --> 00:26:59,048
You don't have the means
to buy formula for your son

404
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:00,986
and yet you can't let go
of your pride, right?

405
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:04,483
Dan eats rice, not formula, okay?

406
00:27:04,484 --> 00:27:06,420
Dan, let's go.

407
00:27:14,755 --> 00:27:17,527
Hey, did you receive
Cha Ki Young's resignation?

408
00:27:17,528 --> 00:27:19,133
Not yet.

409
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:20,330
Get it from her quickly!

410
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,738
She only listens when
she's backed into a corner.

411
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:24,863
Tell her to turn in her resignation
this instant!

412
00:27:33,142 --> 00:27:34,793
Yes, Manager?

413
00:27:34,794 --> 00:27:37,269
Why haven't you given me your resignation?

414
00:27:38,795 --> 00:27:40,871
You have until tomorrow to turn it in.

415
00:27:47,085 --> 00:27:53,436
She's coming, she's not coming.

416
00:27:53,437 --> 00:27:55,754
She came!

417
00:28:07,305 --> 00:28:08,769
Forget it.

418
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,638
Sign here instead.

419
00:28:14,114 --> 00:28:17,512
You like contracts.
You're the queen of contracts.

420
00:28:17,513 --> 00:28:22,019
Sign that contract and sing 'Pa Pa Pa.'
'Everyone all together now!'

421
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:26,455
It's like the contents of this contract
were written by an adolescent boy.

422
00:28:28,112 --> 00:28:29,623
There's nothing wrong with it.

423
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:35,227
'One. Cha Ki Young will actively help
and participate in Jo Eun Cha's election.'

424
00:28:35,228 --> 00:28:38,464
'Two. Cha Ki Young will
become Jo Eun Cha's wife'

425
00:28:38,465 --> 00:28:41,475
'if he fails to get elected
to the National Assembly.'

426
00:28:42,037 --> 00:28:46,925
'Three. She will take off his socks and
cook his meals for the rest of her life.'

427
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:50,395
'And sleep with him whenever he wants.'

428
00:28:53,952 --> 00:28:55,842
Turn in your resignation
if you don't want to.

429
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:07,220
The company is covering
a fashion show special.

430
00:29:07,221 --> 00:29:09,054
I want you to be the MC for that.

431
00:29:09,055 --> 00:29:12,357
You need to show everyone
that you've still got it.

432
00:29:12,358 --> 00:29:14,680
That's the only way to prevent you
from getting laid off.

433
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,967
Are you really going to become my wife
if I fail to get elected? Huh?

434
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,910
And sleep with me whenever I want?

435
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,338
Don't you have a woman?

436
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:28,287
Why do you ask?

437
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:31,658
Surprisingly, there are a lot of women
out there who like macho men like you.

438
00:29:32,517 --> 00:29:33,960
How am I macho? Huh?

439
00:29:33,961 --> 00:29:37,456
Do macho men recommend
single mothers for a job? Huh?

440
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:43,114
Do you honestly think I would be your wife,
even if you were the last man on Earth?

441
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,321
Then why did you sign the contract?

442
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:50,236
Son, let's go!

443
00:29:50,237 --> 00:29:52,340
Daddy will buy you a toy.

444
00:29:52,341 --> 00:29:55,049
- Yay!
- Yay!

445
00:29:57,454 --> 00:29:59,810
There's a lot of nice toys here.

446
00:29:59,811 --> 00:30:02,838
What do you want?
Go ahead and pick one.

447
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,939
Do want the fire truck or the fork lift?

448
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,702
- The fire truck!
- The fire truck it is!

449
00:30:08,776 --> 00:30:10,256
Here you go!

450
00:30:10,257 --> 00:30:14,532
Let's take a picture
since I bought this for you.

451
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:16,928
Look over here.

452
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:19,112
- Fire truck.
- Fire truck.

453
00:30:19,113 --> 00:30:21,520
- Jo Eun Cha.
- Jo Eun Cha.

454
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:27,308
Dan looks exactly like
his father instead of you.

455
00:30:28,205 --> 00:30:30,061
You know I'm a horrible liar.

456
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:32,073
He looks exactly like his father.

457
00:30:32,074 --> 00:30:34,455
Park Tae...

458
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,152
- Hello Madam.
- Goodness, welcome.

459
00:30:46,153 --> 00:30:47,945
Did you get it?

460
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:52,251
These are the sheets and blankets that
helped a woman to conceive her triplets.

461
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:54,436
Good job.

462
00:30:56,875 --> 00:31:01,371
Use these sheets and blankets
when Tae Yun comes back.

463
00:31:02,776 --> 00:31:05,778
Give her an adorable grandson to hold.

464
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:10,370
She wouldn't have asked this kind of favor
if she didn't want a grandson so badly.

465
00:31:10,371 --> 00:31:13,520
Did the obstetrician give you
a clean bill of health?

466
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:15,844
We just have to wait and see.

467
00:31:15,845 --> 00:31:18,897
It's going to be used once
Tae Yun enters the country.

468
00:31:21,127 --> 00:31:22,961
Stand up for me.

469
00:31:22,962 --> 00:31:24,546
Excuse me?

470
00:31:24,547 --> 00:31:26,512
Turn around.

471
00:31:27,377 --> 00:31:28,696
Pardon?

472
00:31:28,697 --> 00:31:33,340
Turn around. Mrs. Oh can also tell
if a woman is able to bear children.

473
00:31:33,341 --> 00:31:35,299
Please take a good look.

474
00:31:38,872 --> 00:31:41,784
Her butt looks small
from both sides, but...

475
00:31:43,387 --> 00:31:46,462
it's much deeper than I thought
from the front and back.

476
00:31:46,463 --> 00:31:51,090
The uterus has to be wide and deep
so the sperm doesn't leak out.

477
00:31:51,091 --> 00:31:53,131
Let me see here.

478
00:31:53,132 --> 00:31:58,628
Goodness, her eyebrows
are dark and her lips are thick.

479
00:32:00,421 --> 00:32:05,543
Madam, there's nothing to worry about.
Just wait for your son to arrive.

480
00:32:13,324 --> 00:32:14,899
Seriously.

481
00:32:21,688 --> 00:32:24,289
He looks exactly like Park Tae Yun.

482
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:30,382
It's game over for me
if his parents find out.

483
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:34,763
Do I kill Cha Ki Young
and the child together?

484
00:32:35,858 --> 00:32:37,986
Or do I only kill the child?

485
00:32:37,987 --> 00:32:40,813
No, should I just kill Cha Ki Young?

486
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,682
Hey, Ki Young.

487
00:33:03,683 --> 00:33:06,145
<i>Yun Hee, I need to borrow your clothes.</i>

488
00:33:06,146 --> 00:33:09,668
I have to host a fashion show
but I have nothing decent to wear.

489
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:12,670
I don't have clothes that are
appropriate for a fashion show.

490
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:14,902
I'll go home and dig around my closet.

491
00:33:14,903 --> 00:33:17,709
- I'm counting on you.
- Okay.

492
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,688
Those steamed ribs look delicious.

493
00:33:24,217 --> 00:33:25,806
Have a bite.

494
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:31,622
It's perfect.

495
00:33:34,338 --> 00:33:35,954
Should I...

496
00:33:35,955 --> 00:33:40,043
- sleep here tonight?
- No, my friends are coming over.

497
00:33:40,044 --> 00:33:41,465
Friends?

498
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:45,101
- Like who?
- Ah, just some girlfriends.

499
00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:48,377
Female friends.

500
00:33:50,268 --> 00:33:51,407
Really?

501
00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:54,666
I went to Ara's Facebook this afternoon,
and she seems to be doing well.

502
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:56,766
I noticed she made a lot
of American friends too.

503
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:58,278
Yeah.

504
00:33:58,847 --> 00:34:02,972
Since Ara's not here,
can't you move into my place?

505
00:34:03,844 --> 00:34:05,200
What about marriage?

506
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:07,651
You want to get married again?

507
00:34:07,652 --> 00:34:10,564
You want to live together
when we're not even married?

508
00:34:10,565 --> 00:34:13,128
That's comfortable for both of us.

509
00:34:13,657 --> 00:34:15,534
You should live alone
if you want to be comfortable.

510
00:34:15,535 --> 00:34:17,604
Why would you want to live with someone?

511
00:34:22,788 --> 00:34:24,850
No, come a bit later.

512
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,364
I'm going to go.

513
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,796
Wait.

514
00:34:40,102 --> 00:34:42,983
Take these steamed ribs
with you and eat them at home.

515
00:34:42,984 --> 00:34:44,438
What about that?

516
00:34:44,439 --> 00:34:46,520
These are for my friends.

517
00:34:46,521 --> 00:34:48,029
Your female friends?

518
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,381
Yeah.

519
00:34:50,651 --> 00:34:52,406
See you later.

520
00:34:54,165 --> 00:34:55,517
Chairman Park.

521
00:34:56,317 --> 00:35:01,098
We plan on firing Cha Ki Young with
the upcoming company reorganization.

522
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,740
And?

523
00:35:02,741 --> 00:35:04,546
Please let go of your anger now.

524
00:35:04,547 --> 00:35:06,694
I know you took your ads out
because of Cha Ki Young.

525
00:35:06,695 --> 00:35:09,622
Please come back and
do business with us again.

526
00:35:09,623 --> 00:35:12,133
That was a long time ago.

527
00:35:12,134 --> 00:35:17,598
Our news station went into a deep financial
crisis after you took your ads out, Sir.

528
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:22,122
Frankly, we don't have the power
to hold on anymore.

529
00:35:22,977 --> 00:35:28,003
It might be better if your company took
over our station. What do you think, Sir?

530
00:35:28,004 --> 00:35:30,738
I'm a businessman. I'm only concerned
about selling my products.

531
00:35:30,739 --> 00:35:33,395
I'm a not a news person!

532
00:35:33,396 --> 00:35:35,101
Chairman Park.

533
00:35:36,891 --> 00:35:38,702
Sir!

534
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,923
Are you really going to leave
your junior high and dry?

535
00:35:48,142 --> 00:35:51,183
We'll go ahead and work with you
because Eun Cha kept pressuring us.

536
00:35:51,184 --> 00:35:54,109
Honestly though, I'm really worried.

537
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,608
I mean, it's not the first time
you screwed up.

538
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:00,025
It's been quite a while
since you've been an MC.

539
00:36:00,026 --> 00:36:03,506
I'm going to get fired if I don't
pull through with this program.

540
00:36:03,507 --> 00:36:07,565
And my child and I will have to live
on the streets if that happens.

541
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:13,385
I promise to do well.
Please trust me.

542
00:36:17,894 --> 00:36:22,586
Somehow, I feel like I can relate to you
from hearing your brutal honesty.

543
00:36:22,587 --> 00:36:25,919
Okay, let's all do our best
with Cha Ki Young.

544
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,542
Please take care of us.

545
00:36:27,543 --> 00:36:29,758
- I think it's going to turn out well.
- Please take care of me.

546
00:36:29,759 --> 00:36:31,201
Fighting!

547
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,212
Hello.

548
00:36:44,906 --> 00:36:46,547
Hello.

549
00:37:20,993 --> 00:37:22,405
Hello?

550
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,104
<i>This is the writer for the fashion show.</i>

551
00:37:24,105 --> 00:37:27,242
<i>Please give me your email address
so I can send you the script.</i>

552
00:37:27,243 --> 00:37:30,794
Sure. I'll text it to you.

553
00:37:40,064 --> 00:37:42,141
Madam, hello!

554
00:37:42,142 --> 00:37:44,460
- It's been a long time.
- Yes, it has.

555
00:37:46,602 --> 00:37:49,617
Isn't the membership fee
for this place ridiculous?

556
00:37:49,618 --> 00:37:54,345
Getting in is more difficult than the cost.
Not unless you're a royal family.

557
00:37:54,346 --> 00:37:58,253
As always, a woman has to be smart catching
the right man instead of just being smart.

558
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:03,845
Smart women are too busy trying to build an
impressive resume and compete against men.

559
00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:06,243
They can't buy a decent house
in Seoul even after a decade.

560
00:38:06,244 --> 00:38:09,836
You... got everything in one shot.

561
00:38:09,837 --> 00:38:13,184
You're the winner compared to
all those arrogant spinsters.

562
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:15,261
Give me some dating advice.

563
00:38:15,262 --> 00:38:17,426
On how to marry a rich man.

564
00:38:18,522 --> 00:38:20,488
Hello, Ma'am.

565
00:38:20,489 --> 00:38:22,862
Oh my, aren't you
Chairman Park's daughter-in-law?

566
00:38:22,863 --> 00:38:26,948
My mother-in-law and I were thinking
about going to your boutique.

567
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:29,979
I was really busy preparing
the fashion show.

568
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,501
I sent an invitation to your mother-in-law,
so make sure you both come, okay?

569
00:38:33,502 --> 00:38:35,257
Yes Ma'am.

570
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,902
That was Designer Oh Shin Hee.
Don't you know who she is?

571
00:38:43,903 --> 00:38:45,809
Of course I know who she is!

572
00:38:46,654 --> 00:38:48,723
I totally love her clothes.

573
00:38:48,724 --> 00:38:51,720
I only have one outfit of hers.
It's so expensive.

574
00:38:51,721 --> 00:38:54,312
Make sure you take me with you
to the fashion show, okay?

575
00:38:54,313 --> 00:38:56,426
Well... we'll see.

576
00:38:57,617 --> 00:39:00,946
<i>[Cubs Village Fathers' Day Visit!]</i>

577
00:39:03,316 --> 00:39:04,791
Chan!

578
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:07,728
I'm sorry! Did you wait too long?

579
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:09,867
My precious baby,
let me take a look at you.

580
00:39:10,936 --> 00:39:12,910
Did you eat?

581
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:17,977
- Are you upset because I came late?
- Yes.

582
00:39:19,112 --> 00:39:20,769
I'm sorry.

583
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:26,214
Excuse me.

584
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:29,841
We have a Fathers' Day visit tomorrow.

585
00:39:29,842 --> 00:39:32,973
- What would you like to do about Dan?
- What is that?

586
00:39:32,974 --> 00:39:36,774
It's a party where the fathers
come and play with their children.

587
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:42,628
I think it might be best if
Dan took the day off tomorrow.

588
00:39:42,629 --> 00:39:46,465
I have an important matter to take care of
tomorrow so he has to be here.

589
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,467
I prick him with a needle
and there's not even a drop of blood.

590
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,888
I mentioned how we attended
the same high school

591
00:39:55,888 --> 00:39:58,051
and Chairman Park
still wouldn't budge.

592
00:39:58,742 --> 00:40:01,366
Ho Pyung, is the company
in that bad of a situation?

593
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:04,698
In just the first half of the year alone,
we had a deficit of 20 billion won.

594
00:40:04,699 --> 00:40:07,782
It'll be a 50 billion won deficit if
we go into the second half of the year.

595
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:09,283
Just hang in there a little longer.

596
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:11,642
Once I get elected...

597
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:14,057
Are you adding fuel to fire right now?

598
00:40:14,058 --> 00:40:16,688
Do you have to leave at this critical time?

599
00:40:16,689 --> 00:40:21,322
I'm much more beneficial to you
as a politician than a news anchor.

600
00:40:21,323 --> 00:40:23,156
Just wait until I get that
gold badge pinned on my suit.

601
00:40:23,157 --> 00:40:25,925
You think I'll let the news station
fall into ruins like this?

602
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:28,202
It doesn't have to be Chairman Park.

603
00:40:28,203 --> 00:40:30,994
I'll rake in every nickel and dime
from all those tycoons.

604
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,595
Don't worry.

605
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:37,459
All you have to do is give me
your full support with my campaign.

606
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:41,047
I ran into Cha Ki Young today
at the news station.

607
00:40:41,048 --> 00:40:42,395
Is that so?

608
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:45,152
I saw a picture of her son.

609
00:40:45,153 --> 00:40:49,912
I thought she would give birth
to a monster from her sperm donation.

610
00:40:51,492 --> 00:40:53,788
But he looks exactly like us.

611
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:56,193
He was quite good-looking.

612
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:01,938
By the way, you're sure
Tae Yun is not the father?

613
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:05,731
Of course. She got pregnant
from a sperm donation.

614
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:12,907
Goodness, what is this?

615
00:41:14,527 --> 00:41:17,699
It's yongbong stew, Father.
I learned it from the culinary school.

616
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:20,702
They say all the kings
used to eat this in the past.

617
00:41:20,703 --> 00:41:22,966
I was told this is a good dish for elders
recovering their energy to eat.

618
00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:24,373
Is that so?

619
00:41:27,942 --> 00:41:32,832
Ah Mother, Madam Oh Shin Hee
is holding her fashion show tomorrow.

620
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:35,916
She sent me an invitation last week.

621
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:39,556
Isn't Oh Shin Hee the wife of
Assemblyman Kim Pal Soon?

622
00:41:39,557 --> 00:41:42,045
Her clothes are ridiculously expensive.

623
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:43,329
Yes.

624
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:47,703
The elections are coming up soon and he's
using his wife's fashion show as an excuse.

625
00:41:47,704 --> 00:41:49,781
He's trying to get political funds.

626
00:41:49,782 --> 00:41:52,567
You two might as well buy her clothes
since I'm making a hefty donation.

627
00:41:53,172 --> 00:41:54,970
Okay.

628
00:41:57,842 --> 00:42:00,624
It's very good. Sit down and join us.

629
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:04,825
That's okay, Father.
I'll just take my time and eat later.

630
00:42:09,169 --> 00:42:11,853
<i>[Fathers' Day Visit!]</i>

631
00:42:16,356 --> 00:42:18,169
Where are the other children?

632
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:21,549
They all went out to prepare
for the fathers' day event.

633
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,865
What about Dan then?

634
00:42:23,866 --> 00:42:27,102
He doesn't have a father. How...

635
00:42:29,486 --> 00:42:33,374
So, today was a day that children without
fathers shouldn't have come, is that it?

636
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:35,927
It's not that...

637
00:42:38,025 --> 00:42:41,737
Then you should have been
frank with me yesterday!

638
00:42:43,056 --> 00:42:46,227
I didn't want to say this to you...

639
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:49,269
but you're really cruel!

640
00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:52,503
When the other children are laughing
and playing with their fathers...

641
00:42:53,077 --> 00:42:55,517
What is Dan supposed to do?

642
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:59,627
What are we to do when
Dan is sad and down...

643
00:43:19,794 --> 00:43:23,122
Excuse me...
are you a member of Club Jaekwon?

644
00:43:24,196 --> 00:43:25,476
Yes.

645
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,691
Ah yes, please have a seat.

646
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,956
Are you the person that
came for the blind date?

647
00:43:41,957 --> 00:43:43,493
Of course!

648
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:47,662
If you don't mind me asking,
how old are you?

649
00:43:47,663 --> 00:43:51,957
I'm not that old!
I'm only 50 years old!

650
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:53,451
50 years old.

651
00:43:54,809 --> 00:43:57,247
Then it won't be too long until
you celebrate your 60th birthday.

652
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,999
I'm trying to find a partner I can share
the last remaining years of my life with.

653
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,022
Last... remaining years?

654
00:44:05,023 --> 00:44:08,419
After my late wife died of
cancer three years ago...

655
00:44:09,251 --> 00:44:11,267
I was really, truly lonely.

656
00:44:11,806 --> 00:44:15,366
I thought it was time to open myself up
and share my life with someone again.

657
00:44:21,207 --> 00:44:22,870
I have two sons.

658
00:44:22,871 --> 00:44:26,853
One moved out after he got hired.

659
00:44:26,854 --> 00:44:31,327
The other rascal married early
and I even have a grandchild now.

660
00:44:32,945 --> 00:44:36,473
You won't have to lift
a finger if you marry me.

661
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:38,631
- Hold on, I need to go to the restroom.
- Sure.

662
00:44:40,586 --> 00:44:42,516
The restroom is over there.

663
00:44:50,358 --> 00:44:52,533
Seriously, I'm going crazy!

664
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:07,719
Let's go.

665
00:45:08,746 --> 00:45:10,326
Aren't you busy?

666
00:45:10,327 --> 00:45:12,569
Isn't the fashion show today?

667
00:45:13,342 --> 00:45:15,188
Anchor Jo.

668
00:45:15,189 --> 00:45:17,759
I can't do the fashion show.

669
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,656
I know this is a huge inconvenience but you
should find someone to replace me quickly.

670
00:45:21,657 --> 00:45:23,039
What the heck are you saying right now?

671
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,501
I have to be with Dan
at that time somewhere.

672
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:29,067
Are you crazy?

673
00:45:29,068 --> 00:45:31,299
The news station is your bread and butter.

674
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,950
And you're telling me you're going
to bail the show because of your son?

675
00:45:35,115 --> 00:45:37,643
- I'm sorry.
- I'll keep it short.

676
00:45:37,644 --> 00:45:40,340
Turn in your resignation right now if
you're not going to host the fashion show.

677
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:42,679
Do you think the news station
is a child welfare foundation?

678
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,913
You don't even work!

679
00:45:43,914 --> 00:45:47,005
Why does the station have to pay
you to raise your kid?

680
00:45:48,828 --> 00:45:50,413
Mom.

681
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:53,167
Please lower your voice!
Dan can hear you!

682
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:56,064
Just how long are you
going to live in hiding?

683
00:45:56,065 --> 00:45:58,982
Where did that high and mighty
attitude of yours go to?

684
00:46:01,084 --> 00:46:02,927
I'm sorry.

685
00:46:04,592 --> 00:46:07,317
Cha Dan, I'm not angry.

686
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:10,632
A man's voice is always supposed
to be loud if he wants to succeed in life!

687
00:46:10,633 --> 00:46:13,487
Convince your mom and send her
to the fashion show. Understood?

688
00:46:33,318 --> 00:46:35,387
Hey, Bro!

689
00:46:36,152 --> 00:46:39,994
I heard you replaced Kang Ha Ni with
Cha Ki Young for Oh Shin Hee's fashion show?

690
00:46:39,995 --> 00:46:41,590
Yeah. Why?

691
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:44,888
You know her husband is
Assemblyman Kim Pal Soon, right?

692
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:46,182
Of course I know!

693
00:46:46,183 --> 00:46:50,862
And I know that he's nominated unofficially
as the chairman for the ruling party.

694
00:46:50,863 --> 00:46:56,099
Did you also know that Kim Pal Soon
is the president of the

695
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,346
'Men Are of the Heavens and
Women Are of the Earth' club?

696
00:46:58,892 --> 00:47:00,036
Really?

697
00:47:00,037 --> 00:47:01,926
You're having a single mother
host a fashion show

698
00:47:01,927 --> 00:47:06,683
of the wife of the most macho man
in the National Assembly?

699
00:47:06,684 --> 00:47:11,270
You're going to be a great politician
with that brain of yours, you idiot.

700
00:47:20,673 --> 00:47:25,966
Kang Ha Ni, dress up and come
to the fashion show right now! Right now!

701
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,613
Seriously, I'm going to go nuts!

702
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:33,046
<i>Will the models please enter.</i>

703
00:47:36,528 --> 00:47:38,657
<i>Walk down the runway.</i>

704
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:43,470
<i>Please continue.</i>

705
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,660
Cha Ki Young.

706
00:47:45,661 --> 00:47:48,438
I got an urgent order
from the company just now.

707
00:47:48,439 --> 00:47:51,336
We need to switch MCs.

708
00:47:51,337 --> 00:47:53,696
- Excuse me?
- I'm so sorry.

709
00:47:53,697 --> 00:47:56,717
Anchor Jo Eun Cha will explain
all the details to you.

710
00:47:59,915 --> 00:48:01,354
I understand.

711
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:03,570
Wait.

712
00:48:03,571 --> 00:48:06,310
Give me the script and
cue cards before you leave.

713
00:48:08,259 --> 00:48:10,582
Thank you. Here you go, Miss Ha Ni.

714
00:48:13,621 --> 00:48:16,975
I'm sorry, but let's start the rehearsal
over with Announcer Kang Ha Ni.

715
00:48:16,976 --> 00:48:19,261
I understand. Okay, start the music over!

716
00:48:23,957 --> 00:48:25,704
Cha Ki Young, I'm sorry.

717
00:48:25,705 --> 00:48:29,667
It was the President's order. I'll find
a better program for you to take over.

718
00:48:29,668 --> 00:48:31,818
The fashion show is just a one time deal.

719
00:48:31,819 --> 00:48:35,824
That's okay. Just help me not to get fired.

720
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:38,251
Okay! I can do that!

721
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:43,060
Where are you going to go now?

722
00:48:43,061 --> 00:48:45,664
- To Dan's daycare.
- At this hour?

723
00:48:45,665 --> 00:48:48,513
All the fathers are invited to
come visit their children today.

724
00:48:48,514 --> 00:48:51,783
I declined the fashion show
because of that reason.

725
00:48:52,584 --> 00:48:54,361
It turned out well since I got the boot.

726
00:48:54,362 --> 00:48:56,182
I'll talk to you later.

727
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:03,857
Jo Eun Cha. You really are a rotten jerk.

728
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:06,859
You convinced her to be the fashion show MC
and then replaced her with Kang Ha Ni.

729
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:10,055
You're a two-faced liar.
Nothing but complete trash.

730
00:49:10,056 --> 00:49:13,819
Good for nothing trash!
Trash, trash, trash!

731
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:19,507
Daycare?

732
00:49:19,508 --> 00:49:23,617
<i>First, let's introduce each
father that came to visit.</i>

733
00:49:23,618 --> 00:49:26,712
<i>- Please introduce yourselves.
- I'm Kim Yoo Ki's father.</i>

734
00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:29,759
<i>The next person please.</i>

735
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,343
<i>Yes, I'm Bo Na's father.</i>

736
00:49:34,395 --> 00:49:36,637
<i>I'm Mi Jae's dad.</i>

737
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:41,156
- Dan!
- Mom.

738
00:49:41,763 --> 00:49:44,069
Ms. Cha, you came!

739
00:49:44,742 --> 00:49:47,463
Dan, let's go home.

740
00:49:50,913 --> 00:49:53,129
- You want to do that?
- Yeah.

741
00:49:54,442 --> 00:49:55,883
Really?

742
00:49:55,884 --> 00:50:01,237
- Who's your dad again?
- Cha Ki Young! My dad is Cha Ki Young!

743
00:50:01,881 --> 00:50:03,512
Let's go.

744
00:50:06,481 --> 00:50:11,092
Cha Dan's mother has come instead.
Please give her a round of applause!

745
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:16,507
Everyone please stand up and
carry your child on your shoulders.

746
00:50:16,508 --> 00:50:18,599
Let's go on daddy's shoulders.

747
00:50:21,816 --> 00:50:24,208
We'll start now if everyone is ready.

748
00:50:24,209 --> 00:50:26,289
One, two...

749
00:51:05,919 --> 00:51:08,433
Dan! Dan! Dan, are you okay?

750
00:51:09,091 --> 00:51:11,098
- Dan!
- Dan!

751
00:51:11,939 --> 00:51:17,306
- Dan! Dan! It's okay! It's okay!
- Dan!

752
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:19,725
Are you okay?

753
00:51:21,098 --> 00:51:23,789
You idiot, you got hurt more!

754
00:51:24,946 --> 00:51:28,396
It's okay! Let's go to the hospital!
Let's go to the hospital!

755
00:51:28,397 --> 00:51:29,833
Let's go!

756
00:51:38,483 --> 00:51:41,408
Fortunately, you didn't
break a bone or anything.

757
00:51:41,409 --> 00:51:42,952
Your muscle is just in shock.

758
00:51:42,953 --> 00:51:46,695
We'll give you a shot. Just take it easy
for a few days. You'll be fine.

759
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:50,024
Mom, are you okay?

760
00:51:50,025 --> 00:51:52,760
Yes, I'm okay.

761
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:00,244
Cha Ki Young.

762
00:52:00,245 --> 00:52:03,272
You're not going to raise Dan
as a hidden child, right?

763
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:06,149
Why would Dan be a hidden child?

764
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:10,185
He becomes a hidden child if the mother
keeps hiding and running away!

765
00:52:12,459 --> 00:52:14,385
If your back is against the wall...

766
00:52:14,386 --> 00:52:16,776
Then you just have to push
your way through! That's life!

767
00:52:16,777 --> 00:52:21,066
Starting now, you do exactly as I say!
No matter what! No matter what! Got it?

768
00:52:25,782 --> 00:52:28,583
Kang Ha Ni, go home.

769
00:52:28,584 --> 00:52:30,840
Cha Ki Young is going to
be the fashion show MC.

770
00:52:30,841 --> 00:52:32,654
- Excuse me?
- Excuse me?

771
00:52:32,655 --> 00:52:34,888
Anchor Jo, are you joking right now?

772
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:37,668
Don't mess with me,
I'm not playing right now.

773
00:52:37,669 --> 00:52:40,747
I refuse to obey your order.
It's unfair, Sir.

774
00:52:40,748 --> 00:52:44,075
Is that so? Then starting tomorrow,
you're no longer an anchor!

775
00:52:44,076 --> 00:52:46,501
I'll post the personnel
appointment tomorrow morning.

776
00:52:47,222 --> 00:52:49,727
I refuse to be the MC as well!

777
00:52:49,728 --> 00:52:51,821
Then turn in your resignation tomorrow!

778
00:52:53,748 --> 00:52:55,681
How am I going to host
the show when I look this?

779
00:52:55,682 --> 00:52:57,305
We have less than 30 minutes
before the show starts!

780
00:52:57,306 --> 00:52:59,899
You kept on reporting the news
while you were in labor, remember?

781
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:02,520
Your dress is all ripped, right?

782
00:53:02,521 --> 00:53:06,580
Kang Ha Ni, take off your dress and give it
to Cha Ki Young when you go home. Quickly!

783
00:53:26,677 --> 00:53:29,764
Mom, you look pretty.

784
00:53:31,902 --> 00:53:34,066
The little rascal knows
his mommy is pretty.

785
00:53:34,695 --> 00:53:40,288
I'll take good care of Dan,
so go and show them what you got.

786
00:53:41,194 --> 00:53:45,153
- Dan, have a good time with Mr. Jo, okay?
- Mom, fighting!

787
00:53:45,154 --> 00:53:46,809
Fighting!

788
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:48,160
Fighting!

789
00:53:51,575 --> 00:53:52,881
Hey, Mom.

790
00:53:52,882 --> 00:53:55,318
- When did you get here?
- A little while ago.

791
00:54:00,942 --> 00:54:02,871
Hello, Ma'am.

792
00:54:10,278 --> 00:54:12,532
Eun Cha, I brought what you asked for.

793
00:54:12,533 --> 00:54:14,337
But, why did you call me?

794
00:54:14,338 --> 00:54:15,967
Dong Shik.

795
00:54:15,968 --> 00:54:18,975
Starting now, I'm going to gamble.

796
00:54:18,976 --> 00:54:21,787
And I need you to keep record of it.

797
00:54:21,788 --> 00:54:24,230
Gamble? What kind of gamble?

798
00:54:25,102 --> 00:54:27,274
I told you raise your arms.

799
00:54:28,293 --> 00:54:30,616
If I let Cha Ki Young
host the fashion show...

800
00:54:30,617 --> 00:54:32,846
I might not get nominated.

801
00:54:32,847 --> 00:54:36,229
But I'm still going to do it.
Do you know why?

802
00:54:37,002 --> 00:54:39,208
Because even if Kim Pal Soon
gets nominated...

803
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:42,993
My macho image right now
won't get me elected.

804
00:54:45,372 --> 00:54:46,789
And?

805
00:54:48,144 --> 00:54:50,433
As Dan's surrogate father...

806
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:52,953
What's connected to it?

807
00:54:55,425 --> 00:55:01,370
A single mother like Cha Ki Young and
women like her are powerless in society.

808
00:55:01,371 --> 00:55:03,400
What do we call something like this?

809
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,520
Feminists?

810
00:55:07,521 --> 00:55:14,331
As of now, I'm going to become the
leading feminist in the Republic of Korea!

811
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:19,719
Me too, me too, me too.

812
00:55:33,349 --> 00:55:36,359
Hello, my name is Cha Ki Young.

813
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,318
Just a moment!

814
00:56:04,985 --> 00:56:09,246
Now, we have two MCs today.

815
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:13,640
Announcer Cha Ki Young and her son Cha Dan!

816
00:56:13,641 --> 00:56:16,052
Please give them a round of applause!

817
00:56:22,662 --> 00:56:25,911
Designer Oh Shin Hee's
fashion show concept for today...

818
00:56:25,912 --> 00:56:29,134
is a happy life for the working women.

819
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:33,599
And we can't leave out children
in that happy life now, can we?

820
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:38,130
But you try to work and
your child cries out for you.

821
00:56:38,131 --> 00:56:40,875
So you take care of your child but
then your job cries out for you.

822
00:56:41,434 --> 00:56:42,702
Today...

823
00:56:42,703 --> 00:56:45,363
this fashion show is
a place to cheer and support

824
00:56:45,364 --> 00:56:48,498
the weary lives of those career women.

825
00:56:49,802 --> 00:56:54,927
Now, please bring a chair
for our little Chan. Quickly.

826
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:01,663
You brought out a pretty red chair for him.

827
00:57:03,356 --> 00:57:05,888
Dan will be hosting next to his mother...

828
00:57:06,413 --> 00:57:11,499
and Designer Oh Shin Hee will
personally set him down in this chair!

829
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,285
Ma'am, please come out.

830
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,035
Thank you.

831
00:57:26,036 --> 00:57:27,635
Okay then...

832
00:57:28,136 --> 00:57:31,807
I will hand over the mic to
Announcer Cha Ki Young now.

833
00:57:45,085 --> 00:57:47,482
The Seoul Designer Association has died

834
00:57:47,483 --> 00:57:49,370
and Channel Korea is
giving its full support.

835
00:57:49,371 --> 00:57:52,672
Oh Shin Hee's fashion show will now start!

836
00:58:18,921 --> 00:58:21,235
Pedro, why are you...

837
00:58:23,184 --> 00:58:25,746
Unbelievable. I took a picture of him.

838
00:58:35,684 --> 00:58:37,370
- Why are you...
- Hey, hey...

839
00:58:37,371 --> 00:58:40,578
Mother, do you need something?

840
00:58:40,579 --> 00:58:42,544
No.

841
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:15,668
<i>Announcer Cha Ki Young who publicly
claimed to be a single mother</i>

842
00:59:15,669 --> 00:59:19,093

<i>Why are you here?</i>

847
00:59:40,352 --> 00:59:41,792
<i>And what brings you to my house?</i>

<i>I'm sorry, Myung Yi.</i>

<i>I feel so sorry for myself.</i>

852

<i>Show me your face.
I missed you.</i>

853
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:04,555
<i> You must be crazy. I'm married
and I have two kids, okay?</i>

854
01:00:04,556 --> 01:00:07,049
<i>I'm going to be responsible
for the choices I made.</i>

855
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:10,252
<i>- He is your child.
- How... just how...</i>

856
01:00:10,253 --> 01:00:12,800
<i>What are we to do?</i>

857
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:15,380
<i>It's better to expose it
if you can't hide it!</i>

858
01:00:15,381 --> 01:00:20,970
<i>This Cha Ki Young can turn a man into
the president if you sleep with her.</i>

859
01:00:22,508 --> 01:00:24,257
<i>Seriously, I'm going to lose my mind!</i>

860
01:00:24,258 --> 01:00:26,760
<i>- Announcer Cha, where are you going?
- I lost my son.</i>

861
01:00:26,761 --> 01:00:31,407
<i>Give me back my son!
Give me back my son!</i>
