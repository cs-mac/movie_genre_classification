...on the bridge, a little bit
slow right now on the lower level.

00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,733
Upper level looking much better.

00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,819
Thanks, Al. 8:05 on
this Wednesday morning.

5
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,362
Time now for a check of
your Mathis Brothers...

6
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,784
The bottom line is, you know,
the epidemic here, Susan,

7
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:38,162
is worse than previously estimated...
probably much worse.

8
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,289
We have this new report
coming out overnight

9
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,959
from the Journal of the
American Medical Association...

10
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:47,422
...of Doctors has described this week
what it calls an emerging epidemic.

11
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,007
Military leaders called that a
threat to national security.

12
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,051
If it doesn't affect
you personally,

13
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,430
it will affect you indirectly by someone
you know, someone in your family.

14
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:56,931
- - It is just going up

15
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,099
much faster than we thought.

16
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,017
The problem just
keeps getting worse.

17
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,978
This is a terror from within.

18
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,479
It is a global epidemic.
Epidemic.

19
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,274
Clearly something's gone wrong.

20
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,861
Kids are being told the biggest lie
they will ever hear in their lives.

21
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:14,073
She cannot... literally
cannot calm herself down.

22
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,617
In the past quarter century,

23
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,078
the number of overweight
children has grown from

24
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,039
one in 20 to nearly one in five.

25
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,084
Used to be you'd have one or
two heavyset kids in a class.

26
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,420
Now we get eight or 1 0.

27
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:31,424
This year, for the first time
in the history of the world,

28
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:35,094
more people will die from the effects
of obesity than from starvation.

29
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:38,639
This has ramifications far
beyond obesity itself

30
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,517
It is worse than even smoking.
The cost of this is about...

31
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,227
Half a trillion dollars in
additional health care cost...

32
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,228
half a trillion.

33
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,022
The American Academy
of Family Physicians

34
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,774
partnered up with Coca-Cola.

35
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,611
Isn't this a conflict
of interest?

36
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,613
Hope that the American
Academy of Family Physicians

37
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:54,614
is looking for...

38
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:58,659
Researchers say obesity is causing
more and more cases of cancer.

39
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,330
and is now catching up to
smoking as the leading cause...

40
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:05,333
It started out as a small story,

41
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,668
I had no idea I'd
be talking about

42
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,630
weight gain and obesity
my entire career.

43
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,886
We've been covering the problem
and solutions for over 30 years.

44
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,055
It's sweatin' time.

45
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:23,601
In that time, entire industries have
ignited over the weight problem.

46
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,853
I will never look
like that again.

47
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:29,148
First came the magazines,
then the talk shows-

48
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,316
And how was the diet for you?

49
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,151
This is the miracle
we've been waiting for.

50
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,780
And now our epidemic is entertainment
on network television.

51
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,950
How is this still an issue,

52
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,245
much less a worldwide epidemic

53
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,081
We get new solutions every day

54
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:49,085
Everything in the grocery store is
made with less fat and fewer calories

55
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,671
and yet our kids keep
getting bigger and sicker.

56
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,673
It makes no sense.

57
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:58,719
ls there a link between our
ever-expanding waistlines

58
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:02,056
and the government's own
dietary guidelines?

59
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,599
And that got me thinking,

60
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:07,520
what if the solutions weren't
really solutions at all?

61
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,689
The Bush administration
is resisting a plan

62
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:13,025
from the World Health
Organization to fight obesity...

63
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,445
What if they were actually
making things worse?

64
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,240
There are a very high percentage
of young people overweight

65
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,118
because of a number of things
that have happened in our country

66
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,245
in the last several years.

67
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:28,499
What if our whole approach to this
epidemic has been dead wrong?

68
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,845
Sorry. Okay.

69
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,556
Uh, let me fix this.

70
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,559
You know, one person told me

71
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:51,147
that fat people were
just made to be fat.

72
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,399
And l don't think that's true.

73
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,362
And l know it's hard, 'cause
l'm still overweight.

74
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,949
And right now l feel
like l always will be.

75
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,577
Why do you not eat
vegetables, Taylor?

76
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,954
- 'Cause l do not like them.
- Why?

77
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,581
- l don't.
- Why not?

78
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:09,582
'Cause l don't.

79
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,334
You just say you don't, but
you don't have a reason.

80
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,710
- Yes, l do.
- What's the reason?

81
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:13,711
l don't.

82
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:20,051
Being in the South, we eat
a lot of fattening things.

83
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:24,430
We eat macaroni and cheese, fried
cube steak, fried chicken.

84
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:28,476
And that's what we're used to.
That's what l've grown up doing.

85
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:32,146
l've done what my parents done. My
parents have done what they've done.

86
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,899
lt's passed on from generation.

87
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,610
And once you start overeating,

88
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,947
it becomes the worst
habit, and it just grows.

89
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,000
The first time that l
think he ever mentioned

90
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,045
the teasing... calling
him fat or something,

91
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,631
l think it was probably
around the age of eight.

92
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,178
Some girls told him they wanted
to see how fast he could run,

93
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,014
and he ran.

94
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:12,228
And later, another girl
came to him and told him..

95
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,271
that they were laughing at him,

96
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:18,401
and they just wanted him to run
so they could see his fat shake.

97
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,362
He stayed upset about
that for so long.

98
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,781
- We ready to eat, Mama?
- Mm-hmm.

99
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:30,246
l'm 1 5, and l weigh
around 21 5 pounds.

100
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,665
lf you like it that way.

101
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,584
l'd like to lose about
50 to 55 pounds.

102
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,796
l could do so many more things.

103
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:42,299
Maybe l could play
football or play baseball.

104
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,511
l've always had an
interest in baseball.

105
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,848
We talk about it a lot... about,
you know, the weight thing and

106
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:52,893
l've always been overweight. And
l was overweight at his age.

107
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:57,106
And l don't want him to be having to
obsess about weight his whole life.

108
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,901
You know, l want him to be able to focus
on other things that are more important.

109
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,700
l really think he
wants to lose weight.

110
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,286
l just think he doesn't
know how to do it.

111
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:16,042
Everybody else doesn't look
at it the same way as l do.

112
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,961
l look at it as l'm failing,

113
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:24,383
and they just look at it as
he's just another fat kid

114
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,512
Kids are obese for
two reasons...

115
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,307
They have voracious appetites,
and they don't exercise enough.

116
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:34,185
Americans view overweight
people as lazy,

117
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,354
unambitious and
lacking willpower.

118
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,858
All we have to do is have people
eat less and exercise more.

119
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,402
Not a very big problem.

120
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,781
The subtle message is "lt's
your fault you're fat."

121
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,159
All you need to do is eat
less, exercise more.

122
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,703
lt's all about personal
responsibility, about willpower.

123
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,247
That's the message that's
been pushed on us.

124
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,249
l want to see you all
moving, all right?

125
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,418
Forget about it.

126
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,545
"Eat less, exercise more".

127
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,757
has been the common sense
answer to unwanted weight

128
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,801
for more than half a century.

129
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,095
This was the science.

130
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,931
And it started with a mouse.

131
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,643
The year was 1 953.

132
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:20,481
Up until this point, exercise
had been considered taboo.

133
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:24,985
Doctors even warned it would cause heart
attacks and diminish your sex drive.

134
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,656
Then came Dr. Jean Mayer,

135
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,574
a French physiologist

136
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:34,829
who would become the foremost
expert on obesity in the U.S.

137
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,039
He noted that large lab mice

138
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,167
ate virtually the same
amount as smaller mice.

139
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,546
But the big ones weren't
nearly as active afterwards.

140
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,256
Mayer's conclusion,

141
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,467
lack of exercise must be
related to weight gain.

142
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:53,139
His finding sparked a
fitness revolution.

143
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,641
This is where you come and
punish yourself for fun...

144
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,810
or rather, for your health.

145
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,354
Here we go now. We're
gonna step apart together

146
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,523
To the right. Apart...

147
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,192
By the time Jane Fonda
became the face of fitness,

148
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,321
Americans were spending billions
of dollars trying to lose weight.

149
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,949
♪ Let's get physical Physical

150
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,993
♪ I wanna get physical ♪

151
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,370
But as more and more
people began exercising,

152
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,373
more and more waistlines
grew out of control.

153
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,586
Between 1 980 and 2000,

154
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:28,299
fitness club memberships more than
doubled across the United States.

155
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:32,970
During that same time, the
obesity rate also doubled.

156
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,513
A decade later,

157
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,223
two out of every three Americans

158
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,684
were either overweight or obese.

159
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,478
So how is it possible...

160
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,773
that the enormous rise of
the fitness revolution.

161
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:48,611
almost exactly mirrored the
rise in obesity rates.

162
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,529
Something is making that happen.

163
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,949
The question is, how is that
happening in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia,

164
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:57,036
Sweden, Norway, South
Africa and everywhere else.

165
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,999
And we have obese
six-month-olds.

166
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,004
You want to tell me that they're
supposed to diet and exercise?

167
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,758
So, how our politicians
can continue

168
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:13,302
to espouse this same mantra...

169
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,847
"Diet and exercise, you are
what you eat, it's your fault"

170
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,807
is absolutely beyond me.

171
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:36,575
l am 1 2 years old, and
l weigh 21 2 pounds.

172
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:42,539
My doctors have said
that l am a statistic.

173
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,750
l don't really know
what it means.

174
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,877
l think it has something
to do with my weight.

175
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:53,133
They normally say that l'm
just supposed to eat healthier

176
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,761
and exercise a lot more,

177
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,222
which is what l am doing.

178
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,557
l swim four days a week

179
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,770
and then walking my
dogs on the weekends.

180
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:12,569
We didn't really start to worry about
it until l think she was eight,

181
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,364
um, when the doctor wanted us

182
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,492
to seek a nutritionist to
kind of address the issue.

183
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,327
And l just remember at that time

184
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,871
we called the nutritionist
that he wanted us to

185
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,499
and we were told, "We don't
see children that young."

186
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,461
lt has to do a lot with
their self-esteem,

187
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,631
especially with girls once
they hit their teenage years

188
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,842
because, "Oh, l'm the fat kid,

189
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,261
and l always have to
consciously watch what l eat."

190
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,848
My doctor, um...

191
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,601
he told me to join
Weight Watchers,

192
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:49,940
um, and l can't, because
l'm not old enough yet.

193
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,027
Then we stopped at that point
and said, you know what?

194
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,447
We know... We have the tools. We
know what we're supposed to do.

195
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,615
Let's just try and
do it ourselves.

196
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,331
Some of the things that l do when
l look for healthier choices

197
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,124
is doing the reduced fat...

198
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,669
lt's got more fiber in it. lt's
made with more whole grains.

199
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,297
l look at the fat content, but
cereal, by its very nature,

200
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,757
is generally pretty low in fat.

201
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:19,762
So cereal's a good go-to for
pretty much any meal replacement.

202
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,058
l know what my family will eat,

203
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:28,437
and l try and consider that
when l'm purchasing things.

204
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,985
l would expect that, since l'm
eating healthy and exercising a lot,

205
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,615
that l would be able to
lose more weight than l am.

206
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:43,786
But my weight has
mostly stayed the same.

207
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,873
So, sometimes it gets a
little bit frustrating.

208
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,969
This whole generation of kids,
they're doing their best.

209
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,764
They're torturing themselves

210
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:08,102
to do the cure that we tell
them, and it's the wrong cure.

211
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,521
And we're blaming the willpower,

212
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:15,150
the moral fortitude of these
kids, and it's a crime.

213
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,741
There is a solution to obesity.
lt's energy balance.

214
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,868
lt's balancing calories
in and calories out.

215
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:28,455
We're eating and drinking too much
and not getting enough exercise.

216
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,291
We will have to have
greater emphasis

217
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,211
on getting that energy balance.

218
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,506
Nowadays there's this phrase,
"Let's practice energy balance."

219
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,134
Okay, we're gonna make sure
that we know how to match

220
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,344
the calories in to
the calories out

221
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,596
so that we don't get fat.

222
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:48,475
lt's nonsense.

223
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:53,689
You eat, say, 1 1 0
bites of food a day,

224
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:58,694
and you only burn off 1 09 of them,
you're gonna get obese in 20 years.

225
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:02,573
Even if there's a Guinness world
record holder of calorie counting,

226
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,867
calories in to the calories out,

227
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,786
nobody can do it.

228
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:08,954
3:40.

229
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,917
- What do you have next?
- Next l have swim team.

230
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:18,422
We certainly don't want to
discourage people from exercising

231
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,091
or underplay the importance of
physical activity to health,

232
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:25,220
but we are not gonna exercise our
way out of this obesity problem.

233
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,850
To burn off just
one 20-ounce Coke,

234
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:33,687
a child would have to bike
for an hour and 1 5 minutes.

235
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:36,857
Most people don't have that
much time in their day.

236
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,320
So if you burn a
calorie sleeping,

237
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:45,616
or you burn a calorie exercising,
it's still a calorie burned.

238
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,744
The question is, is a calorie
eaten a calorie eaten.

239
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,288
And for that we have
really good data.

240
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,624
And it says a calorie
is not a calorie.

241
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,419
Why is a calorie not a calorie?

242
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,379
All right. Let's
give you an example.

243
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,632
Let's take an easy one.
Let's take almonds.

244
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,887
lf you consume 1 60
calories in almonds,

245
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,390
because of the fiber
in the almonds,

246
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,810
the food is not going to
get absorbed immediately.

247
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,772
So your blood sugar rise
is gonna be a lot lower,

248
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,316
it's gonna be for longer.

249
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,360
So what's the opposite
of the almond?

250
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,446
Well, the opposite of the
almond would be a soft drink.

251
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,074
Because there's no fiber,

252
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,785
they get absorbed straight through
the portal system to the liver.

253
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:34,414
The liver gets this
big sugar rush.

254
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,376
And when your liver
gets that onslaught,

255
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:42,422
it has no choice but to turn
it into fat immediately.

256
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:47,261
So, 1 60 calories in almonds,
or 1 60 calories in soda.

257
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,096
You tell me which is better.

258
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:55,227
For over 1 25 years, we've
been bringing people together.

259
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,521
And yet we are
continually being sold

260
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,566
a message contrary
to the science.

261
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,943
...on something that concerns
all of us... obesity.

262
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,486
Our weight, we're told,

263
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,447
comes down to calories
in and calories out.

264
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,241
One simple, common sense fact.

265
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,619
All calories count, no
matter where they come from,

266
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,414
including Coca-Cola and
everything else with calories.

267
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:19,251
And if you eat and drink more calories
than you burn off, you'll gain weight.

268
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,087
Well, one thing we
need to understand,

269
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,423
that the food industry is really
at the heart of this problem.

270
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,593
We're handing the
industry a big gift

271
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,597
in that they get to confuse the
issue by talking about exercise.

272
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,017
lt's all about the spin, right?
So the food industry is good at

273
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:40,314
kind of taking half-truths
and then stretching them.

274
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,816
Food companies are interested
in selling more food.

275
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,485
That's their job
as a corporation.

276
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:50,032
And one way to do that is to
co-opt potential critics.

277
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:55,495
The soft drink companies fund
research in universities.

278
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,123
They donate to
professional societies.

279
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:02,210
And, in fact, l just saw
a new major analysis

280
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,839
that says that soft drinks have
nothing to do with obesity.

281
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:09,009
And the study was sponsored
in part by Coca-Cola.

282
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,053
We haven't heard this kind
of association before.

283
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,639
lt's the American Academy
of Family Physicians.

284
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,558
They have partnered up with...

285
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,019
Coca-Cola, which...

286
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,480
You know... Yeah, definitely
a head-scratcher.

287
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,274
Immediately after
Coke's announcement,

288
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,860
a group of 20 doctors
who helped make up

289
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:30,405
the American Academy of Family
Physicians publicly resigned.

290
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:35,786
How can any organization that
claims to promote public health

291
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:40,207
join forces with a company that promotes
products that put our children at risk?

292
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,126
But not all doctors
see it the same way,

293
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:47,714
particularly those whose research
is funded by the industry.

294
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,550
Even though study after
study has shown soda

295
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:55,097
to be a significant contributor to
America's staggering obesity crisis.

296
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,308
Dr. Allison says there's not
enough "solid evidence."

297
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:02,270
But his critics say Allison is
motivated by something else...

298
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,356
by all the money he
has repeatedly taken.

299
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,233
from Coca-Cola, Pepsi.

300
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,151
and the American
Beverage Association.

301
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,991
l know you've received a lot of money
from the food industry in general.

302
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,704
Was there evidence that said the
ingestion of sugary beverages

303
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,456
actually contributed to
the obesity problem?

304
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,292
lngestion of all calories
contributes to the obesity problem.

305
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,920
One question you might ask
is whether sugary beverages

306
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,464
contribute more so than
do other calories.

307
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,508
That's a very challenging
question to ask.

308
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,052
Well, let me ask you that.
Do they?

309
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,930
lt's a good question. There's
reasons to believe they might.

310
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,141
But l don't think the evidence
is quite clear. For example...

311
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,643
And what would be the
science behind that?

312
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:48,066
Well, the ideal study might be
requiring people to, uh, uh...

313
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,905
Excuse me. Let me start again on that.
Let me just get my thoughts together.

314
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,198
Okay.

315
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,707
We know sugared
beverage consumption

316
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,500
is producing diabetes
and obesity.

317
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,003
lt's just ridiculous
to think otherwise.

318
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:10,380
And, of course, research
shows it to be the case.

319
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:11,757
And people are getting wise

320
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,301
to industry-funded studies
that show the opposite.

321
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:22,142
lf you're peddling Coca-Cola,
Pepsi, sugar water, Gatorade,

322
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,853
you don't want your food to be
considered inherently fattening,

323
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,397
just as the tobacco industry
would have preferred

324
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:31,943
that their product not been considered
inherently capable of causing cancer.

325
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:36,406
But just like cigarettes
literally cause lung cancer,

326
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,075
certain foods literally
make you fat.

327
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,455
This is a big bag.

328
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,922
What did you have for lunch?

329
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,632
- Let's tell the truth.
- Um...

330
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,844
Hamburger. French fries.

331
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,430
Milk and juice.

332
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,683
- Milk and juice?
- They give them both.

333
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:10,398
lf you ever go on a diet, and
you try to eat healthier food,

334
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,609
your brain's still telling
you "Eat, eat, eat.

335
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:16,154
lt's not what l want. No,
get something else."

336
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,532
You're still used to
that fattening stuff.

337
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,826
That's why it's hard
to go on a diet.

338
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,911
You ain't got but
a few more to go.

339
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,955
This time of night you
don't eat that many.

340
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,752
- Gotta savor the flavor.
- You gotta savor the flavor?

341
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,339
You gotta savor the flavor 'cause
you only get so many chips.

342
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,424
l'm trying to lose weight.

343
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,427
My weight is pretty heavy. 1 80.

344
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,848
l'm a pretty heavy dude. That's
why l try to get exercise in,

345
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,766
eat some healthy food every day.

346
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,189
We, um, started eating
different things,

347
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,232
more fruits and vegetables.

348
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,818
We limit our starches.
We limit our breads.

349
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,820
We keep healthier snacks.

350
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,989
He loves Hot Pockets.

351
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,074
So they have Lean Hot Pockets.

352
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,785
So l make sure to have the lean
ones versus the regular ones.

353
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,250
lt costs more to eat healthier.

354
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,669
So we slip. And l'm not
gonna say we don't.

355
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:16,548
Because it's easier to go in there and
buy the cereals with sugar in it.

356
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:20,468
lt's easier to buy chips,
because it's cheaper.

357
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,470
And that's what the food
industry wants them to think.

358
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,514
They want them to
think it's cheaper.

359
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:27,559
KFC Family Feast. Nine
pieces, any recipe,

360
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,562
three large sides, six
biscuits, 1 9.99.

361
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,397
Do not give up on dinner. Mm.

362
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,901
"You deserve a break today."
You can get a "value meal."

363
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,153
These are messages that have
kind of gotten embedded

364
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,572
into our culture,
into their thinking.

365
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,284
But there is well-documented
scientific proof

366
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:47,120
that you can eat well for less,
and they don't know that.

367
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,007
Okay, we're gonna be
in room number nine.

368
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,885
Just come right in.

369
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,970
And it'll be just
a moment, okay?

370
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,934
How is the diet control going?

371
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,227
Diet control for him is getting...
is better.

372
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,313
At first it was rocky,
but it's a lot better.

373
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,399
l'm happy to hear that you think
things are going so well,

374
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,611
but it's a bit concerning,
because when l look at Wesley,

375
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,987
he doesn't look any thinner.

376
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:24,157
ln fact, he actually looks bigger
than he did a few years ago.

377
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:27,202
And what l see from
the data is...

378
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,871
is that he's continued
to gain weight

379
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,583
even faster than the
rate that he was before.

380
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:38,129
His weight is even higher
than it was last time.

381
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,925
l've eaten less than l usually have.
l've exercised more.

382
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,678
And l don't really know why
l'm getting more weight.

383
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,266
Mom, have you noticed
that his skin here...

384
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,936
is starting to get a little bit
dark and a little bit thick.

385
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,313
lt's part of what we
call metabolic syndrome.

386
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,356
Oh. Okay.

387
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,816
His body is already
starting to show

388
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:01,861
some of the adult signs of
overweight and obesity.

389
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,614
l worry about that l might have
a heart attack or a seizure,

390
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:05,782
or something like that

391
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,367
l've seen these
things on the news.

392
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,369
And l've seen my family
have had it too.

393
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,454
And l'm worried
myself might have it.

394
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,206
So relax your arm and your leg.

395
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,293
And take some deep breaths.
And here we go.

396
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:26,136
lt's not just genetics. We're
seeing strokes in eight-year-olds.

397
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,971
We're seeing heart
attacks in 20-year-olds.

398
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:30,515
We're seeing kids at 30,

399
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,434
by their 30th birthday needing

400
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,646
renal dialysis for kidney failure
because of these problems.

401
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,982
Genetics are a very
important part of this

402
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,026
and certainly there are people

403
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,529
who are genetically susceptible
and genetically prone.

404
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,782
But genetics is not
what this is about.

405
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,910
When l was young,
the obesity rates

406
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,163
were actually pretty
rare among children.

407
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,791
There's been a
stunning increase.

408
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,710
We haven't had this situation

409
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:03,798
throughout the whole history of
mankind until the past 30, 40 years.

410
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,058
Most experts say the
obesity epidemic

411
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,352
really has taken place in
the last 30 years or so.

412
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,230
Looking back, do you
think there's anything

413
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,067
that your administration
or other administrations

414
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,944
could have done to prevent this?

415
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,363
l don't know. l
missed it sort of.

416
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,907
We knew that...

417
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:33,661
We had an effort to try to increase
the exercise programs in the schools

418
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,247
and improve the
cafeteria requirements

419
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,459
but l don't think we appreciated
the magnitude of it.

420
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:45,507
We've got all these kids, even
preteens, with type 2 diabetes now.

421
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,093
That used to be called
adult-onset diabetes.

422
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,720
lt was unheard of for
young people to get it.

423
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,934
And it's becoming a big problem
in other parts of the world.

424
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,812
Second-fastest growing area...
Middle East and North Africa.

425
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,440
lt's not only a personal tragedy
for a lot of young people

426
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,693
and interferes with their quality
of life, their mobility,

427
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:11,032
but it will lead to enormous
complications for us.

428
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,541
As physicians, we know how to take
care of a 50-year-old or 60-year-old

429
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,793
with type 2 diabetes.

430
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:26,131
What none of us have done is to
take care of that 1 0-year-old

431
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:30,635
with type 2 diabetes for
five, six, seven decades.

432
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,804
We don't know the
consequences of that.

433
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,390
And that scares me greatly.

434
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,478
If there's a moment in
time marking the start

435
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:46,234
of the obesity epidemic, it's
1 977, the McGovern Report.

436
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,528
The Senate Special
Committee on Nutrition

437
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:52,115
is looking into the connection
between heart disease and diet.

438
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:55,952
Expert testimony before the committee
on nutrition and human needs

439
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,789
warned Senator George McGovern
that obesity would soon be

440
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:04,043
the number one form of
malnutrition in the United States.

441
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,714
When we get the kind of
overwhelming consensus

442
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:09,924
that has developed
before this committee

443
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:13,887
it seems to me we have some obligation
to share that with the American people.

444
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,222
With predictions of
rising medical cost,

445
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,685
the committee issued the very
first dietary goals for Americans

446
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,355
noting that our diet had become
overly rich in fatty meats,

447
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,442
rich in saturated
fats and cholesterol,

448
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,903
and rich in sugar.

449
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:34,199
The egg, sugar, dairy
and beef associations

450
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,911
with sales of their
products in danger, united,

451
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,747
and flat-out rejected
the McGovern Report.

452
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:43,416
They even demanded a rewrite.

453
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,669
The byzantine politics that
l saw taking place here

454
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:52,175
the last couple of weeks had to
do with the power of lobbies.

455
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:54,761
Despite McGovern's
best intention,

456
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:57,847
the dietary goals
were indeed revised

457
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:03,186
and the words "reduced intake" were
removed from the report for good.

458
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:06,898
Instead, they encouraged
Americans to buy leaner products

459
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:10,068
and buy more food with less fat.

460
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:16,115
And so, the 1 980s began
with a new health doctrine,

461
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,076
and a brand-new market,

462
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:23,498
every food product imaginable
reengineered to be low in fat.

463
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:28,628
When you take the fat out of
the food, it tastes nasty.

464
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:31,798
Tastes terrible.
Tastes like cardboard.

465
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:34,926
Food industry knew that. So
they had to do something

466
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:38,721
to make the food palatable,
to make it worth eating.

467
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:41,224
So what did they do?
Dumped in the sugar.

468
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:42,892
♪♪ Sugar

469
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,812
♪ Aw, honey, honey

470
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,984
♪ You are my candy girl

471
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,988
♪ And you got me wanting you

472
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:58,658
♪ Honey

473
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,744
♪ Aw, sugar, sugar

474
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:07,083
♪ You are my candy girl

475
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,460
♪ And you got me wanting you ♪

476
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,380
Between 1 977 and 2000

477
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:16,092
Americans have doubled their
daily intake of sugar.

478
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,344
Sugar is poison.

479
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:23,349
lt is a chronic... not acute...
chronic dose-dependent...

480
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:28,646
depends on how much you eat,
because there is a safe threshold,

481
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,566
hepato... "liver"... toxin.

482
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:35,486
The metabolic diseases that
are associated with obesity,

483
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,531
the diabetes, the heart disease,

484
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:41,701
the lipid problems, the
strokes, the cancer...

485
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:45,163
those diseases are
being driven by sugar.

486
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,540
Fructose, the sweet
part of sugar

487
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,876
can only be processed
in the liver.

488
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:54,422
When your liver is pushed to the max,
the pancreas comes to the rescue

489
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:59,135
by producing excess amounts
of a hormone called insulin.

490
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:02,221
lnsulin is the energy
storage hormone.

491
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,267
lnsulin turns sugar
into fat for storage.

492
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,102
That's insulin's job.

493
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,857
High levels of insulin can
also block your brain

494
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,276
from receiving the
signal that you're full.

495
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,489
Problem is your brain
thinks you're starving.

496
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,159
So how do you feel
when you're starved?

497
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,536
Crappy, tired, slothy.

498
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,830
Sit on the couch, don't
want to do anything.

499
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:30,458
And, of course, hungry.

500
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:33,503
Well, l've just described
every obese patient.

501
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:38,091
The behaviors that we
associate with obesity...

502
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,511
the eating too much, the exercising too
little... the gluttony and the sloth,

503
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:45,681
they are the result of the
biochemistry, not the cause.

504
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,475
All right. l'm at the
grocery store with my mom

505
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:51,604
and so far our buggy's
got Cheez-lts,

506
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:55,191
cookies, pudding...

507
00:28:56,485 --> 00:29:00,947
The problem is sugar isn't
just in cookies and desserts.

508
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:10,581
lf you go to the supermarket, there
are 600,000 food items in America,

509
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,461
and 80% of them
have added sugar.

510
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:34,397
Sugar can hide behind many
names on nutrition labels,

511
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:37,900
like sucrose, fructose,
glucose, dextrose,

512
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:42,155
lactose, maltose, invert
sugar and turbinado sugar.

513
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:48,536
And the most well-known of
all, high-fructose corn syrup.

514
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,788
You'll absorb them
exactly the same.

515
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:55,042
And so, all of the studies that have
pitted high-fructose corn syrup

516
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,212
against sugar show no
difference between the two.

517
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,006
They're both equally bad.

518
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:03,718
So, too much sugar, in
any form, is dangerous,

519
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:07,388
even if the high-fructose
corn syrup is replaced

520
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,724
with any of these
other varieties.

521
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:13,269
lt's not just all of
the excessive sugars

522
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,271
but the processed starches too,

523
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,648
white bread, white rice,

524
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,693
potato products, prepared
breakfast cereals,

525
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:25,448
are digested into glucose literally
in an instant in the digestive tract.

526
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:30,286
You can eat a bowl of corn
flakes with no added sugar

527
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:33,664
or you could eat a bowl of sugar
with no added corn flakes.

528
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,792
They might taste different,
but below the neck,

529
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,961
they're metabolically
the same thing.

530
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:42,590
When you consume
sugar naturally,

531
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:45,051
that is, in fruit,

532
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:49,889
you're getting the fiber that you need
to mitigate the negative effects.

533
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,767
Am l worried about fruit? No.

534
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:55,645
But am l worried about fruit juice?
Oh, you bet.

535
00:30:55,812 --> 00:31:01,067
Because when you take the fiber out
you might as well be drinking a Coke.

536
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:03,027
l drink diet soda all the time

537
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,155
and l want to know if diet soda
is good for you or bad for you.

538
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,449
A lot of people think
that they can just switch

539
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:10,076
from sugar to
artificial sweeteners,

540
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:12,954
"diet" this, "diet" that,
Splenda, aspartame...

541
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:17,708
but it triggers hormonal responses that
cause you to produce more insulin.

542
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,419
They make you crave more.
They make you hungry.

543
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,797
You think sugar's on the way. Your
brain's like, "Wait a minute,

544
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:24,715
l think sugar's coming.
l tasted it."

545
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,594
So, low sugar, low
fat, diet foods,

546
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:32,014
they're dangerous, and they're
actually disease producing as well.

547
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:36,602
Disease doesn't
happen with one meal,

548
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,854
but it happens with a thousand.

549
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,941
But that's what we have, because
now sugar is with every meal.

550
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,828
Good morning. l am just getting
ready to go to school this morning,

551
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:55,371
and l just ate cereal.

552
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,502

So, 1 0 years of sugar
in the morning,

573
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,523
sugar in the evening,
sugar at suppertime,

574
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,193
you've got this
veritable tsunami

575
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,654
of obesity and metabolic
disease we see today.

576
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:32,093
My name is Joe Lopez.
l'm 14 years old.

577
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,553
And l'm in ninth grade.

578
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,934
Right now l'm about nearly 400.

579
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:49,026
l've tried a lot
of things, but...

580
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,945
none of them really work.

581
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:54,198
l would lose some weight
and then gain it back.

582
00:33:56,827 --> 00:34:02,248
All of us in my family have
always been heavy... all of us.

583
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,875
l guess it's culture.

584
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,878
You know. lt used to be...
Grandma used to say,

585
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:12,925
"You don't get off of that table until
you eat everything you have on there."

586
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:17,138
And we kind of thought that that's
the way it's supposed to be.

587
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:33,988
lt's not as easy to
just stop eating,

588
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:37,408
because l have a huge appetite.

589
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:40,077
for Twinkies and all
that sweet stuff.

590
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:46,709
Yes, l know, you're gonna say l'm
putting him in harm's way...

591
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:49,086
by giving him all the food
that he wants and stuff,

592
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,714
but l know he sneaks stuff,

593
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:55,176
cookies and cakes and all that.

594
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:59,722
Or he gets stuff at school, or he gets
stuff with his brother, and, uh...

595
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,974
You don't have no
control over it.

596
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,813
l wish l did, but,
uh, you don't.

597
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,441
You don't.

598
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:20,034
Processed food is
much more powerful

599
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:23,162
than we ever realized.

600
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,081
For decades, we had the science
to show that drugs of abuse

601
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,667
can hijack the neural circuits

602
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,711
to get us to come back
for more and more.

603
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:34,006
We now have the science to show

604
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:37,885
that you can make food
hyper-palatable too

605
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:41,972
and that gets us to come
back for more and more.

606
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,808
Researchers at
Princeton University

607
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,769
have been studying how rats
change their eating behavior

608
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:49,480
if they're allowed to
drink sugar water...

609
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:53,317
In a recent study, 43
cocaine-addicted laboratory rats

610
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:56,779
were given the choice of
cocaine or sugar water

611
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:59,573
over a 1 5-day period.

612
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:03,285
Forty out of the 43
chose the sugar.

613
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:06,163
In another study, rats
on a sugar water diet

614
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,582
exhibited telltale
signs of addiction,

615
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:14,004
binging, craving and withdrawal
when the sugar was taken away.

616
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,257
Food addiction is a real thing.

617
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:20,511
lt's not a metaphor.
lt's a biological fact.

618
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,556
The studies show that your
brain lights up with sugar

619
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,683
just like it does with
cocaine or heroin.

620
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:29,103
ln fact, sugar is eight times
more addictive than cocaine.

621
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:34,942
So, if you start your baby early
on addictive highly sugary foods,

622
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,569
they're gonna become addicted.

623
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:40,281
Take a look at formula.

624
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:44,076
Certain formulas, especially
lactose-free formulas,

625
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,245
they substitute with sucrose.

626
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:51,250
The food industry knows that the earlier
they introduce these foods to people,

627
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,627
to children, to infants,

628
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:57,590
the more likely they will have
branded them for the future.

629
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:04,179
And every generation of
kids born after 1 980

630
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:08,851
has grown up surrounded by
these highly addictive foods.

631
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:11,520
l see food, l get hungry.

632
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,898
lt's... l don't know what it is.

633
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,900
l just... When l see
it, l get hungry.

634
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:20,279
My stomach's telling me l'm not really
hungry, but my mind's telling me, "Eat."

635
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:23,616
lf you eat foods that are addictive...
You can't just have one line of coke.

636
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,951
You can't just have, you
know, two cigarettes.

637
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,202
You're gonna become an addict.

638
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,288
Once you pop, you can't stop.

639
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:31,790
We have to understand
that the willpower idea,

640
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,919
that personal responsibility, doesn't
work in the face of addiction.

641
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:42,051
A lot of times people wonder why
it's so hard to lose weight.

642
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:46,430
But a big reason might be because
you actually have those foods...

643
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:50,184
the chips and the brownies and the
cookies and cakes and ice cream...

644
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:52,686
in your house.

645
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,730
lt's just like being
an alcoholic.

646
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:58,400
Do you think an alcoholic could
withstand from drinking that alcohol

647
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,487
if he had a bottle of gin
sitting next to him?

648
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:04,782
lt'd be tough to do. When you're
close to it, you want it.

649
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,868
And it's the same way with food.

650
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,371
We like to think we
make rational decisions

651
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:14,583
but the fact is our brains are
getting constantly hijacked.

652
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:18,629
You can't walk, in most
cities, most places

653
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:22,007
more than a hundred feet
without having your brain

654
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,927
being activated in some way.

655
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:29,014
Gas stations used to sell gas. Now
they're all convenience stores.

656
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:32,434
And there's junk food at
the checkout everywhere,

657
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:35,396
at toy stores, at drugstores.

658
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:39,692
Go to buy stationery supplies,
linens, electronics...

659
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:44,863
Every store these days has junk food
right at the eye level of your kids.

660
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,033
And then you add the emotional gloss.
You add other things.

661
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:51,870
You add favorite
cartoon characters.

662
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:55,290
You make it into entertainment.
You add toys.

663
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:59,169
And then you add the
carnival-like features.

664
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,423
You add all these other
layers of stimuli.

665
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,466
And in the end, you end up with

666
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:07,469
one of the great public
health epidemics of our time.

667
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,973
Sometimes it's hard.

668
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:15,686
l see... chocolate, and
l just want to eat it.

669
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,861
l wish there was a pill l could take
that would just make me thinner.

670
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:31,368
lf a foreign nation was causing
our children to become obese,

671
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:34,705
that's going to affect their
health and hurt their happiness

672
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,416
cause them to be depressed,
to have poor self-esteem...

673
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:40,794
lf a foreign nation were
doing that to our children,

674
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,504
we'd probably go to war.

675
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,215
We would defend our families.

676
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:50,262
So why do we accept this
from our own country.

677
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,264
Do you think the
government is behind

678
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:55,476
when it comes to helping Americans
reduce their sugar intake?

679
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,144
- Yes. l do.
- Why? Why are they doing this?

680
00:39:57,312 --> 00:40:01,482
- l think that...
- Or why aren't they doing more?

681
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,359
l can't answer that,

682
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,321
particularly since corn has
been turned into fructose.

683
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:09,615
and is a sweetener
for soft drinks,

684
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:12,076
which l don't think is
a good use of corn.

685
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:19,666
Um... but l think that America
is still insufficiently alert

686
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:24,296
to the damage we are doing
long-term to our collective health

687
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,799
by too much sugar intake.

688
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:34,723
ln 2002, the World
Health Organization

689
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,935
put together a document
known as TRS-91 6,

690
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:40,395
Technical Report Series 91 6.

691
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,899
And in that document they
say, very specifically

692
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:48,237
that sugar is a major,
if not the cause

693
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,781
of chronic metabolic
disease and obesity.

694
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,828
The W.H.O. is the division
of the United Nations

695
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:59,123
responsible for setting
global health standards.

696
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,752
The World Health Organization
wanted to really restrict

697
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,713
sugar intake to a level that
scientists recommended.

698
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:10,425
They recommended no more
than 1 0% of calories

699
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,011
in a diet should
come from sugar.

700
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:17,224
Well, the sugar groups hit
the roof over that one.

701
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:21,228
There was a very strong pushback
in Washington by the industry.

702
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,355
Senators Larry Craig
and John Breau,

703
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:26,191
a Republican and a Democrat,

704
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:30,404
asked then secretary of Health and
Human Services Tommy Thompson

705
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,447
to stop the report.

706
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,408
The Bush administration
is resisting a plan.

707
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:39,246
from the World Health Organization to
fight obesity on an international scale.

708
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:42,040
The administration says it is
too tough on the food industry.

709
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:47,212
Tommy Thompson actually
took a jet to Geneva

710
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,132
and basically told the
World Health Organization

711
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:56,221
that if they published this document
we would withhold the $406 million

712
00:41:56,389 --> 00:42:00,267
that we were going to pay them as
our contribution to the W.H.O.

713
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:05,314
ln other words, we extorted the W.H.O.
to bury this document.

714
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,649
The sugar recommendation
was deleted

715
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,527
from most World Health
Organization reports.

716
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,946
going forward up
to this very day.

717
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,282
Lobbyists for the sugar industry

718
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,452
recommended that 25% of calories

719
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,831
in your daily diet
should come from sugar,

720
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:27,002
two and a half times the W.H.O.
recommendation.

721
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,755
While food nutrition labels
list government-recommended

722
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:32,341
daily amounts of
various nutrients,

723
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,219
today when you look
on any food labels,

724
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:40,307
you will not find sugar listed with a
percentage for the daily recommendation.

725
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:42,601
The question is whether
or not our government

726
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:49,733
has been complacent or even
complicit with this food debacle.

727
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:53,570
And the answer is absolutely.

728
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,989
The sugar industry's
extraordinarily powerful

729
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,325
and there's a lot
of money involved.

730
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:01,286
We have a food industry
that's feeding America

731
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:05,791
mostly highly processed, sugary
foods that are killing us...

732
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:07,376
that are making us fat and sick.

733
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:11,088
This is the fundamental problem that
nobody's talking about in the society.

734
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,970
Thank you, everyone.

735
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,683
We're all here today
because we care deeply

736
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,144
about the health and well-being
of not just these kids up here

737
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:30,023
but for all kids like them
all across the country.

738
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:33,318
And clearly we're determined
to finally take on

739
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:36,530
one of the most serious
threats to their future,

740
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:40,158
and that's the epidemic of childhood
obesity in America today.

741
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,704
We've got some talented chefs
and nutritionists here

742
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,414
to teach us how to make
healthy breakfasts.

743
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,332
Farmers' markets
do more than just

744
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,793
help Americans feed their families
healthy meals, they help...

745
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,712
We're issuing a call to action.

746
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,965
We need you not just to
tweak around the edges,

747
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:58,969
but to entirely rethink the
products that you're offering.

748
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,805
ln the first months of
the Obama administration

749
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,516
she was exhorting the
industry to change

750
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:06,977
its products and to cut
its children's marketing

751
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:10,480
and to really make substantive
changes that way.

752
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,150
My guess is when the food
industry heard Michelle Obama

753
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:16,945
launch her Let's Move campaign
they reacted in terror

754
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:20,324
Our kids don't choose
to make food products

755
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:24,077
with tons of sugar and sodium
and super-sized portions

756
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:28,081
and then to have those products
marketed to them everywhere they turn.

757
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:31,168
That's a terrifying discussion
for the food industry.

758
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:33,378
So what did they do?

759
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:35,589
They volunteered to help her.

760
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,724
l am so pleased to
announce a major agreement

761
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:48,477
on the part of the private
sector corporations.

762
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:51,646
to improve the nutrition of the
food that we put on the table

763
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,815
or that we grab on the run.

764
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,776
The Healthy Weight Commitment

765
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,612
is a partnership between
1 6 corporations...

766
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,908
Pepsi, Coca-Cola...
everybody's offering to help.

767
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:05,535
But you have to look at what
they're offering to do.

768
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,997
We're very fortunate that the first
lady has taken on this initiative

769
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:10,999
so people are starting
to talk about it more.

770
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:13,251
ln the schools,
we have a program

771
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:16,838
where we have P.E. teachers and
nutritionists working together,

772
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:19,091
teaching the kids about
calories in and calories out

773
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,301
and really paying
attention to what you eat

774
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:24,054
and then paying attention to
the exercise you do every day.

775
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:27,474
Also, we went to the White House, and
we did an announcement with Mrs. Obama

776
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:30,185
that our companies would be
pulling 1 .5 trillion calories

777
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:32,562
out of the marketplace in 201 5.

778
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,524
And so we're very happy that we
can provide healthier choices

779
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,567
for moms as they're
shopping for their kids.

780
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:48,286
Fourteen calories a day
is a single bite of food.

781
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:51,164
lt's a couple sips of a soda.
lt's a bite of an apple.

782
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:52,999
lt's nothing.

783
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:57,170
They've agreed to reformulate
their foods in a number of ways.

784
00:45:57,338 --> 00:46:01,508
All the food manufacturers drew her
into a very long, complicated,

785
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:04,094
intricate discussion
about processed food,

786
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,805
how we can make
processed food better.

787
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:18,233
But whatever they do to processed
foods, it will be used to sell us

788
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,944
more processed foods than
we should probably eat.

789
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,823
That's the beauty of
a processed food.

790
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,492
You can dial up the carbs,
dial down the carbs.

791
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,704
Same with the proteins.
Same with the sugars.

792
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:36,668
All these changes become marketing
claims designed to get you to buy more.

793
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:39,463
The food industry has
bamboozled and hoodwinked us

794
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:42,466
into thinking that there are
healthier alternatives.

795
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,302
Junk is still junk, even
if it's less junky.

796
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:48,054
lt's about making money.

797
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,765
That's their bottom line.

798
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:54,895
They're in business to make money
not to keep America healthy.

799
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,781
Well, the companies
actually have three options

800
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,909
to participate in the
calorie commitment.

801
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:12,454
They can change the recipe
of existing products,

802
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:15,290
they can introduce new
products into the marketplace

803
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:19,711
and they can also introduce portion-size
products into the marketplace.

804
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:22,714
So, if they're... So...

805
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:32,182
You're going to be introducing new
lower and zero-calorie products.

806
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:41,233
Well, you have a significant transition
that's taken place in the last 1 0 years,

807
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,152
and l think that, uh,
most moms and dads

808
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,780
know when you walk through
the grocery store

809
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:50,075
and you're making that selection as
to what products you want to buy

810
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:52,744
you have options that are
zero-calorie options,

811
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:56,206
lower-calorie options and
full-calorie options.

812
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,500
lt feels like we're
avoiding the question.

813
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,461
That's the industry's response.

814
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:04,548
Change the conversation
from real food

815
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,634
and cooking and going
to the farmers' market

816
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:13,306
to reengineer processed
foods and exercise.

817
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:17,310
Before too long, the first lady
was emphasizing more and more

818
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:20,313
the "exercise" part of
the Let's Move campaign.

819
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:24,401
Shouldn't be so hard to get them
to run around and play, right?

820
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:27,279
This isn't forcing them
to eat their vegetables.

821
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,490
lt's getting them to go
out there and have fun.

822
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:34,411
lt's about how
active our kids are.

823
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:42,002
This isn't about demonizing any
industry or any, you know...

824
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,129
lt's not about
demonizing parents

825
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:46,798
and it's not about
demonizing businesses.

826
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:50,176
From the beginning the
name "Let's Move"

827
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,346
was not meant to evoke exercise.

828
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:55,765
lt was meant to evoke
action on the issue.

829
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,058
lssuing a call to action.

830
00:48:57,226 --> 00:49:00,061
But what a food industry
person hears is

831
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:02,397
their interpretation of
the obesity epidemic

832
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:04,566
which is that we
are too sedentary.

833
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:07,736
lt's our own damn fault because we're
sitting, watching TV too much.

834
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,280
lt's not the food.

835
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,907
And l think that was a very unfortunate
message for the White House to put out

836
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,160
because it is the food.

837
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:21,166
And the food, especially the
abundance of cheap, processed,

838
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:25,295
sugar-laden products is a direct
result of government policy.

839
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:31,134
Mainly the United States
Department of Agriculture.

840
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:33,803
The U.S.D.A. was
initially created

841
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:37,682
to help farmers thrive by
promoting their products.

842
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,310
But in the aftermath
of the McGovern Report

843
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:44,272
the U.S.D.A. inherited
dietary guidelines as well.

844
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,276
When obesity became a problem,

845
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:52,072
the Department of Agriculture was
put into conflict of interest.

846
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,449
Because on the one hand it was
telling people to eat less

847
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:56,493
in order to prevent obesity,

848
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:58,995
and on the other hand it was
telling people to eat more

849
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,748
to promote consumption of
American agricultural products.

850
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:07,295
They can't do a
good job of both,

851
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:10,298
and because of lobbying dollars
and where the money really is,

852
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:13,385
it's doing a much better job
of promoting U.S. agriculture

853
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:16,054
than it is in teaching us and
helping us how to eat well.

854
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,974
One clear example
of this conflict

855
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:23,353
is the curious case of cheese.

856
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:25,897
Remember back in the 1 980s

857
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:29,401
when the food industry began taking
out the fat from its products

858
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,819
after the McGovern Report?

859
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:34,989
Women, and girls especially,

860
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,742
became a little bit
more health-conscious

861
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:40,453
and started drinking skim milk.

862
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:43,289
Did you ever stop to
think what happened

863
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:47,001
to the fat in the milk
when it became skim?

864
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:50,505
Well, one way to make
use of milk fat.

865
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:53,466
is to turn it into cheese.

866
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:56,970
As the demand for low fat milk
increased over the years,

867
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:59,180
the government found itself
with a lot of cheese

868
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:01,599
they didn't know
what to do with.

869
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,477
lnstead of pushing
the dairy industry

870
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,479
to cut back on the production,

871
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:09,482
Washington came up
with this other idea.

872
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:14,112
Why don't we help the
industry sell more cheese

873
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,115
by getting people
to eat more cheese?

874
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:21,077
Cheese, glorious cheese

875
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:24,581
Tastes mighty inviting

876
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:27,542
Cheese, glorious cheese

877
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:30,712
♪ It's so tantalizing ♪

878
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:34,215
Dairy Management was
created in 1 995.

879
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:37,594
to act as a marketing arm
of the dairy industry.

880
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:41,890
Financed by the farmers, with
oversight by the U.S.D.A.,

881
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:46,686
Dairy Management helped flood the
marketplace with good-looking cheese.

882
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:52,317
Now walk into the dairy aisle,

883
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:58,114
and the cheese section is bulging
with packages of cheese...

884
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:03,661
shredded, cubed,
diced, grated...

885
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:08,958
made as simple as possible
for adding to other foods.

886
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,211
Some of the things that
Dairy Management did

887
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,338
to encourage the
consumption of cheese

888
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:17,133
were so clever that the U.S.D.A.
actually bragged on them

889
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,677
in its annual reports
to Congress.

890
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,764
ln 2007, for example,

891
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:27,852
it noted how the industry was able
to sell 30 million more pounds

892
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:31,981
by designing things like Pizza
Hut's Cheesy Bites Pizza,

893
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:35,318
Wendy's Dual Double
Melt sandwich concept

894
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:40,657
and Burger King's Cheesy
Angus Bacon Cheeseburger.

895
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:43,326
So at the same time the Agriculture
Department is promoting

896
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:46,579
consumption of cheese,
its small unit,

897
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:49,791
charged with protecting
consumers and fighting obesity

898
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:53,169
puts out these little brochures
that encourage people

899
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,713
to eat less cheese.

900
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,219
lf the U.S.D.A. really wants
to increase cheese consumption

901
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:03,680
and promote a healthy lifestyle,

902
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:07,642
here is an easy
solution, cheesercize.

903
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:10,562
Just grab a set of baby bells

904
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,814
and really work those "goudes".

905
00:53:12,982 --> 00:53:15,149
Oh.

906
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,944
The problem is, it's
not just cheese.

907
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:21,948
This conflict between public
health and promoting agriculture

908
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:24,409
plays out across the board.

909
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:27,662
The U.S.D.A. says to
limit your sugar intake,

910
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:31,416
yet has provided over
$8 billion in subsidies

911
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:35,378
for corn-based
sweeteners since 1 995.

912
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:40,133
lt's fair to say that the government
is subsidizing the obesity epidemic

913
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:41,801
inadvertently, through
its subsidies of corn

914
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:44,220
which gets turned into
high-fructose corn syrup

915
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:47,974
and all those weird ingredients
that you see in processed food,

916
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:52,437
the maltodextrin, the xanthan gum,
all those words you can't pronounce.

917
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:57,025
So you have the government in this
crazy, schizophrenic situation,

918
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,902
where, on the one hand

919
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,739
they're subsidizing precisely the
foods that are making us sick,

920
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:06,743
and then on the other are now on
the hook to set the standards

921
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:08,912
for school lunches for our kids.

922
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:25,595
Chili cheese fries,
nachos, fried chicken...

923
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:29,265
all these fattening
and greasy foods

924
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:31,434
are just clogging
up our schools.

925
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,978
School, we're supposed
to be healthy.

926
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:36,981
My school has nachos
every day for school

927
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:40,276
and three-fourths of our students
in high school choose nachos.

928
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:44,405
All my bad decisions are
when l'm at school,

929
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,240
at lunchtime, at breakfast time.

930
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:49,369
'Cause there's no other choice.
Either you eat or you starve.

931
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:52,413
Today at lunch we
had hamburgers.

932
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:55,708
You either had a chance to get a
cheeseburger or a sloppy joe.

933
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:57,627
Neither one of them's
really that healthy.

934
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,464
Other options that they had

935
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:03,925
were this place called
the student store.

936
00:55:04,093 --> 00:55:09,222
They have a daily special like
Monday is Papa John's pizza.

937
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,015
Tuesday is Chick-fil-A.

938
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:14,477
Wednesday is Arby's.

939
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,729
Thursday is Pizza Hut.

940
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:19,941
and Friday is McDonald's.

941
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:24,529
And then this is the slushie
machine that they have.

942
00:55:24,697 --> 00:55:27,448
The school lunch program
has evolved in such a way

943
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:30,451
that it really is serving
the food processors

944
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:33,413
much more than it is
serving the students.

945
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,001
The government got in the
school lunch business

946
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,836
after World War II.

947
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:45,174
1 946.

948
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:48,928
President Harry Truman signed
the National School Lunch Act

949
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:54,726
after a huge number of military recruits
were rejected because of malnutrition.

950
00:55:54,893 --> 00:56:00,148
On February 1 8, l will present in
detail an economic program to Congress

951
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:04,068
reducing the growth in government
spending to reduce unemployment.

952
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:06,821
In 1 981 , President
Ronald Reagan

953
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:11,951
looking to limit the role of
government cut $1 .46 billion

954
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:14,037
out of the child
nutrition budget.

955
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,788
It will propose budget cuts

956
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:17,999
in virtually every department
of the government.

957
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:20,334
Many schools got rid of
their cooking equipment

958
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:26,007
and turned to the food industry
to make lunch cheap and simple,

959
00:56:26,175 --> 00:56:29,135
kid-friendly favorites that
could be heated and served.

960
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:33,765
In 2006, 80% of all high schools

961
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:37,810
operated under exclusive
contracts with soda companies

962
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:44,317
and by 201 2 more than half of all U.S.
school districts served fast food.

963
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,530
The food industry infiltration
of the schools is deplorable.

964
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:52,200
The schools have become
dependent on the money

965
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,868
and it's a bargain
with the devil.

966
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:58,581
Some schools have become
like a 7-Eleven with books.

967
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,876
We are thrilled to be
here with all of you

968
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:06,214
as l sign the Healthy,
Hungry-Free Kids Act,

969
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:11,427
a bill that's vitally important to
the health and welfare of our kids.

970
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:14,889
In 201 0 President Barack
Obama signed the bill

971
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:18,684
authorizing the U.S.D.A. to
come up with new standards

972
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:21,270
for the federally funded
school lunch program

973
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,189
in an effort to
make it healthier.

974
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:29,737
This had the effect of possibly
eliminating pizza from school.

975
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:36,160
Well, the Schwan Company in Minnesota
is a $3 billion private company

976
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:41,332
which accounts for 70% of the pizza
market in the U.S. school lunches.

977
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,627
They could not have pizza
eliminated from school.

978
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:48,047
So their senator in
Minnesota, Amy Klobuchar

979
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:50,758
wrote a letter to the
Department of Agriculture

980
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:54,178
to protect their frozen
pizzas in school lunches.

981
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:57,056
lt had kind of a
complicated process

982
00:57:57,224 --> 00:58:00,268
where the effect was to count a
slice of pizza as a vegetable.

983
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:03,729
lt's common sense.
lt's not a vegetable.

984
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,190
What's next? Are Twinkies gonna
be considered a vegetable?

985
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:08,734
Rather than having a
deliberative effort,

986
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:13,114
we have special interests inserting
these provisions into these bills

987
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:14,949
contrary to the public health.

988
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:21,622
ln terms of the pizza issue, we
proposed a set of guidelines

989
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,791
and Congress
essentially suggested

990
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:25,835
that they wanted a slightly
different approach.

991
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:27,503
Was that frustrating for you?

992
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,922
Well, it's a little
frustrating, sure.

993
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:33,467
- But at the end of the day...
- Tomato paste is a vegetable?

994
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,928
- Really?
- Well, it's... Well, uh...

995
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,347
Not in my household, but, uh...
but, l mean,

996
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,975
somebody could
probably make the, um,

997
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:43,227
the scientific
argument that it is.

998
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:46,522
But it's not how l
perceive a vegetable.

999
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:51,152
By 201 2, the revised
regulations were issued.

1000
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,404
The U.S.D.A. increased
the lunch budget

1001
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:58,201
for the first time in 30 years...
by six cents,

1002
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,953
set a new maximum on calories

1003
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:03,956
and doubled the required amounts
of fruits and vegetables,

1004
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:07,919
which still includes
french fries and pizza.

1005
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:11,964
lt doesn't look like the lunches
have improved that much.

1006
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:17,470
They have hamburgers and cheeseburgers,
chicken-fried steak and pizza today.

1007
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:22,308
We have a main dish every
day that is very healthy.

1008
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:26,729
We probably did about
25 of those...

1009
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,691
out of, like, 350.

1010
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:32,526
They kind of like...

1011
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:38,157
l'll have the pizza." And they'd
rather get fries and cookies.

1012
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:41,577
But you can't choose for 'em. They
have to choose for themselves.

1013
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:44,622
l don't know any child

1014
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,959
who would rather have
vegetables over a candy bar

1015
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,294
when both are placed
in front of them.

1016
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,257
A lot of these fast
food restaurants

1017
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:57,718
are still operating in school
cafeterias all across the country.

1018
00:59:57,886 --> 00:59:59,929
And it's... it's
not a good thing.

1019
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,765
l don't agree with all
the new guidelines.

1020
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:05,309
l wish they'd gone
a little further.

1021
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:12,900
We could cure literally 80% of the
problem for children in school

1022
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:15,027
if we went back to
school cafeterias

1023
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:16,570
where they prepared the
food in the school.

1024
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:19,490
- What can l get for you, babe?
- Can l have a cheeseburger, please?

1025
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:21,409
You sure can.

1026
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:22,868
Thank you.

1027
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,793
Have you lost any weight?

1028
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:36,590
lt's just kind of aggravating...

1029
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:39,135
because...

1030
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:43,639
l mean, my weight's not really
going the way it's supposed to go.

1031
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:49,603
When we release our children
into the care of schools,

1032
01:00:50,022 --> 01:00:52,356
we expect that they're not
going to drink unsafe water

1033
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:55,735
that will make them sick, we don't
expect them to breathe unsafe air

1034
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:56,861
that will make them sick,

1035
01:00:57,029 --> 01:01:00,531
and we shouldn't expect them to eat
unsafe food that will make them sick.

1036
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:04,035
The industry, l think, cares less
about what they sell in schools

1037
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,620
than the opportunity they
have to market their brand.

1038
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,540
We're paying a very dear price

1039
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:11,876
for letting the food
industry act at will

1040
01:01:12,044 --> 01:01:14,378
in recruiting our children
as loyal customers.

1041
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:17,214
l remember l went
to a preschool once

1042
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:19,300
and the kids were sitting
on little chairs...

1043
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:23,137
little red-and-white chairs.
that said "Coca-Cola."

1044
01:01:23,305 --> 01:01:25,848
What do they think?
Well, Coca-Cola's good.

1045
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:29,602
lt's part of preschool. l should
be drinking more Coca-Colas.

1046
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:34,315
Marketers want to start to target
kids as early as they can.

1047
01:01:34,483 --> 01:01:37,151
Studies show that children
as young as two and three

1048
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:38,903
start to recognize brands.

1049
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:44,367
The problem is, they don't
see any commercials

1050
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,994
for bananas, strawberries,
zucchini and broccoli.

1051
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:50,331
lt shapes the whole way
they think about food,

1052
01:01:50,499 --> 01:01:53,084
what they think food is.

1053
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:59,048
There have been attempts to regulate
how we market food to children

1054
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:01,717
since the very beginning
of the obesity epidemic.

1055
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:06,889
1 977... the same year
as the McGovern Report.

1056
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:09,767
Consumer advocates lobbied the
Federal Trade Commission,

1057
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:13,104
the government arm in
charge of advertising

1058
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:16,315
to regulate ads for
sugar-laden products.

1059
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:17,900
lt's grr-r-reat.

1060
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:20,528
The executive director of the
Federal Trade Commission

1061
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:23,322
says the group is slowly
coming to the conclusion

1062
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:26,659
that television advertising
aimed at children is unfair.

1063
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:28,702
The cumulative effect

1064
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:31,789
of the thousands of hours of
advertising viewed by children

1065
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:36,210
is that kids are being told the biggest
lie they will ever hear in their lives.

1066
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:39,755
lt's not fair to use the public
airwaves to encourage children

1067
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:43,342
to develop health habits
and buying patterns

1068
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,302
which they will probably
keep up in adulthood

1069
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,138
that are hazardous to health.

1070
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,723
The F.T.C.'s proposed
restrictions

1071
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:53,185
have been defended as vital to protect
the health of America's children

1072
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:56,897
and assailed as an attack on
free enterprise, free speech

1073
01:02:57,065 --> 01:03:01,402
and as a dangerous intrusion by the
federal government into family life.

1074
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:04,488
Broadcasters, advertising
agencies and toy companies

1075
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,867
all banded together to prevent

1076
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:11,162
the F.T.C. from regulating
children's television.

1077
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,622
And an official of Quaker Oats

1078
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,125
said one of the best uses
of sugar he could think of

1079
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:18,210
was getting children
to eat their cereal.

1080
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:23,674
Big Food won the battle. No
regulations were put in place.

1081
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:29,597
But marketing to kids really took off a
few years later with processed foods.

1082
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:33,392
And with the advent of corn syrup,
a cheaper alternative to sugar,

1083
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,395
the big food makers had
more money to spend

1084
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:39,356
on bigger sizes
with better prices

1085
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:41,484
and on ad campaigns
with corporate tie-ins

1086
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,445
and high-priced
celebrity endorsements.

1087
01:03:44,613 --> 01:03:47,740
♪ You're a whole new generation

1088
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:50,910
♪ You're a whole
new generation ♪

1089
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,162
Now food advertising
is everywhere.

1090
01:03:57,584 --> 01:03:59,043
- Diet Snapple?
- l know!

1091
01:03:59,211 --> 01:04:00,419
lt tastes just like regular
Snapple, doesn't it?

1092
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:03,506
Dr. Pepper's
unbelievably satisfying.

1093
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,966
We in this Congress
have a responsibility

1094
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,385
to protect America's children

1095
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,221
from the sophisticated,
aggressive,

1096
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:12,932
relentless marketing of
junk food to our children.

1097
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,975
With obesity rates skyrocketing,

1098
01:04:15,227 --> 01:04:18,020
Congress tried again in 2004

1099
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:21,315
to regulate food industry
marketing to children.

1100
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:26,529
Big Food and Fast Food responded
much like they did 20 years before.

1101
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:29,865
When l hear this discussion, l
hear "marketing to children,"

1102
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,201
which really you're saying
"advertising to children."

1103
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:34,119
and you're also saying,
"lt's all bad."

1104
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,913
And that's just not true.

1105
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:39,041
Ronald McDonald never
sells to children.

1106
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,919
He informs and inspires
through magic and fun.

1107
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:48,259
lndustry under threat of
government regulation...

1108
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:51,387
will say "We can
police ourselves."

1109
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:55,641
And they launch into this series
of self-regulatory promises

1110
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:59,186
that we'll market less to children,
we'll pull our products out of schools.

1111
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:00,771
When you hold them accountable

1112
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:02,690
and study whether changes have
been made, what do you find?

1113
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,525
lt's not a pretty picture.

1114
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:06,443
Keeps 'em full,
keeps 'em focused.

1115
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:08,946
- Get a spectacular Spider-Man toy!
- Made with real fruit!

1116
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:10,072
Thanks, Mom.

1117
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,199
With the fox guarding
the henhouse,

1118
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:15,869
children's exposure to junk
food ads, including online

1119
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:20,332
increased 60% from
2008 to 201 0.

1120
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,751
The Federal Trade Commission
has less authority

1121
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,588
to regulate advertising to
kids than it does to adults.

1122
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,799
You would think that would be
just the other way around.

1123
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:32,636
There are several
studies that show

1124
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:35,681
that when children are
watching television,

1125
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:40,144
especially with food commercials,
they're primed to eat more.

1126
01:05:40,312 --> 01:05:44,231
One study had kids watching
TV and they gave them a bowl

1127
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:46,984
of Goldfish crackers to munch
on while they were watching.

1128
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:51,238
The kids that watched TV, while
they showed also food commercials

1129
01:05:51,406 --> 01:05:53,824
they ate 45% more
Goldfish crackers

1130
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:57,870
compared to kids watching the same
TV program with nonfood commercials.

1131
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:01,665
l showed the data

1132
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:06,295
on how our neural circuits and
the neural circuits of our kids

1133
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:10,674
are getting sensitized
to all these food cues

1134
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:14,094
to a group of leading
diabetologists

1135
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:17,056
and their conclusion,
when they saw that

1136
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:20,184
and they realized that these circuits
get laid down for a lifetime,

1137
01:06:20,352 --> 01:06:22,394
is that we're toast
as a country.

1138
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:26,649
Hearings begin today on a proposed
law that would ban giving away toys

1139
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:30,152
with meals high in calories,
fat, sugar and salt.

1140
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:34,198
The trouble is, every time the
government tries to regulate Big Food

1141
01:06:34,366 --> 01:06:37,451
again and again the
industry protects itself

1142
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,620
by sparking a larger
public debate

1143
01:06:39,788 --> 01:06:43,165
over the role of
government in our lives.

1144
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:45,209
The food police striking again.

1145
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:48,504
They have a predictable script

1146
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:50,339
that they roll out every
time these things come up.

1147
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:52,841
This is the most ridiculous
sort of nanny-statis.

1148
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,927
- "Nanny state."
- lt is the nanny state.

1149
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:57,221
These nanny-state people want
to tell you what to eat.

1150
01:06:57,389 --> 01:06:58,722
"Government doesn't belong
in our private lives."

1151
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:01,058
Apparently now we need
government food cops.

1152
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:02,810
"You're discriminating
against us."

1153
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:05,020
To single out one
food or beverage.

1154
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,564
The mayor of New York
City, Michael Bloomberg

1155
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:09,358
wants to outlaw what he calls

1156
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:12,069
super-sized sodas and
other sugary drinks.

1157
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:14,905
"You don't need the police. Just look
at all the good-guy things we're doing.

1158
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:17,157
You know what Ronald
McDonald is also known for.

1159
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:19,326
For 35 years he's been known for
the Ronald McDonald Houses.

1160
01:07:19,494 --> 01:07:21,203
Exactly.

1161
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:24,581
The script is so reliable now
and the lobbying dollars

1162
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:28,377
that are aimed at legislators from
the food industry are enormous

1163
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:30,671
and as a consequence they're pretty
good at fighting things off.

1164
01:07:30,839 --> 01:07:33,340
Who should be making the
decisions what to eat

1165
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:35,634
and school choice and
everything else.

1166
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:39,054
Should it be government, or should it be
the parents? lt should be the parents.

1167
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:46,353
The fact that parents
have a role to play

1168
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:51,900
does not change the fact that targeting
young children is simply immoral.

1169
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:56,905
l think we need to really get
straight in this country

1170
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,991
the difference between
parental responsibility

1171
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:04,621
and the corporation's role in exploiting
the vulnerabilities of a young child.

1172
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,590
He's been having many more
problems now with his legs.

1173
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:19,052
He's going through therapy, and he's
still having a hard time with it.

1174
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:21,722
- So you've been having knee pain?
- Yeah.

1175
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:28,645
This bariatric program
came to the hospital,

1176
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:34,985
and my doctor considered me for surgery
that'll change my life for the better.

1177
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:41,450
l don't want it.
l kinda need it.

1178
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:45,704
l've gotten to a point
in my weight where

1179
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:49,541
if l... if l keep gaining
weight like l am,

1180
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:52,377
l'm gonna probably
be dead by 20.

1181
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:55,839
The surgery has complications.
There's no question about it.

1182
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:57,508
But as we've talked about,

1183
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:01,053
you always look at what the
risk is of doing the surgery

1184
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:04,765
and compare it to what the risk
is of not doing the surgery.

1185
01:09:04,933 --> 01:09:07,518
And we've all agreed that the
risk of not doing the surgery

1186
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,145
is that we're gonna
decrease your life span,

1187
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:13,690
increase your risk of diabetes
and all of these complications.

1188
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:17,402
And so we know that even though
there's risk with the surgery,

1189
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:20,322
there's a bigger risk
of not doing it. Okay?

1190
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:26,662
l've never heard of, you know, a 1
5-year-old having this surgery.

1191
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:28,622
Um, you know...

1192
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:33,585
l guess l'm still
kind of against it.

1193
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:38,590
Thing could go wrong, and...
then l wouldn't have my Joe.

1194
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:41,552
That wouldn't be right.
l would feel that one.

1195
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,103
lt's the people who
are least able

1196
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:54,523
to know what's good
for their health..

1197
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:58,235
who are the ones that
certain industries cater to

1198
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:02,114
and try to focus their
advertising toward.

1199
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:08,495
We're selling these products to the
people who are most vulnerable

1200
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:11,790
and they're also the people that
society has to provide health care for

1201
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:14,918
because they don't have the
money to do it themselves.

1202
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:38,358
l didn't even want to be at the hospital
and see him going through that.

1203
01:10:38,526 --> 01:10:42,487
lt sounds selfish, but, um...

1204
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:50,704
lt was hard.

1205
01:10:51,539 --> 01:10:55,751
But, uh, he-he's...
a tough little guy.

1206
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:57,377
Yeah.

1207
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:19,524
There's probably a limited role for
gastric bypass, or bariatric surgery

1208
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:24,655
in the most extreme circumstance to
avoid life-threatening complication.

1209
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:27,574
But what does it say
about our society

1210
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:33,789
if we would rather send children
to such mutilating procedures

1211
01:11:33,957 --> 01:11:39,211
but yet lack the political will
to properly fund school nutrition

1212
01:11:39,379 --> 01:11:42,005
and ban junk food
advertising to children.

1213
01:11:42,173 --> 01:11:45,634
lt reflects a systematic
political failure.

1214
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:48,470
We're the richest
society in the world.

1215
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:53,183
We've failed because we've placed
private profit and special interests

1216
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:55,394
ahead of public health.

1217
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,022
This is a vitality
medical center.

1218
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:01,775
Fixing to get our body scans.

1219
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:12,744
lt's hard for us teenagers
to try to be healthy

1220
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,871
'cause you see all your friends

1221
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:17,207
eating fattening chili
cheese fries and nachos

1222
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:22,504
and all this fattening fried chicken
and all these fattening, greasy foods,

1223
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:26,633
and they're skinny,
and they look good.

1224
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:30,303
My brother can eat all he
wants and still be skinny,

1225
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:33,390
and l look at him and say, "Well,
he can do it. Why can't l?"

1226
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:35,600
And that... l hold on to that.

1227
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:40,981
And that's how l-l
don't lose weight.

1228
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:43,692
Many people think that if
you're thin, you're healthy

1229
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,694
but that's not necessarily true.

1230
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:48,405
You can be fat on the inside
and skinny on the outside

1231
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:51,283
or metabolically
obese normal weight.

1232
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:54,786
lt's very dangerous, and it leads to all
the same consequences as being fat,

1233
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:58,457
such as heart attacks, strokes,
cancer, dementia and diabetes.

1234
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:02,502
Dr. Jimmy Bell, who is a
neuroimager in London, England,

1235
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:04,129
coined the term "Tofi"...
T-O-F-l.

1236
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:07,966
Thin on the outside,
fat on the inside.

1237
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:11,845
Because when you slide somebody into
an M.R.l. and you actually visualize

1238
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:14,014
the fat they might
as well be obese.

1239
01:13:15,183 --> 01:13:17,142
- There! X-ray!
- Yeah.

1240
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,269
Nuke sign.

1241
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:22,606
Brady and his brothers went
to the doctor for DEXA scans,

1242
01:13:22,774 --> 01:13:26,443
a type of X-ray that
measures internal body fat.

1243
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:29,029
The beauty of it is, you
can see where the fat is.

1244
01:13:29,197 --> 01:13:31,406
Because a lot of fat is
distributed in different places

1245
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:34,034
and the worst fat
is the belly fat.

1246
01:13:34,202 --> 01:13:36,870
Kids who are normal weight should
be between 1 0 and 20% belly fat.

1247
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:40,916
Brady's results were
by far the worst...

1248
01:13:41,209 --> 01:13:44,044
47% of his body is fat,

1249
01:13:44,212 --> 01:13:48,381
most of it in his belly,
which is 60% fat.

1250
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:50,634
The belly fat is a
dangerous, lethal fat.

1251
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:52,844
And his insulin levels are high.

1252
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:55,347
The insulin is the
fat storage hormone.

1253
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:01,770
While his youngest brother,
Nicholas, had normal results,

1254
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:06,399
1 0-year-old Chandler
had 22% belly fat

1255
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:11,613
and the 1 9-year-old,
Joseph, had 28%.

1256
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:17,369
Almost all of these skinny-fat
kids are prediabetic.

1257
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:20,664
Even though the junk food doesn't
make them fat, necessarily,

1258
01:14:20,832 --> 01:14:21,998
it makes them sick.

1259
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:25,502
The question is, do you have it?
You might, and you don't know.

1260
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:28,505
Based on the statistics

1261
01:14:28,673 --> 01:14:32,467
we know that 30% of
America is obese.

1262
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:34,511
Let's talk about
the thin people.

1263
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:38,306
Up to 40% of these people have
the same metabolic dysfunction.

1264
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,433
They're just not obese.

1265
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:44,813
So when you do the math, that's
more than half the U.S. population.

1266
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:47,607
This is not just a
problem of the obese.

1267
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:50,402
This is a problem of everybody.

1268
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:56,992
There are so many industries

1269
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:00,745
that make profits off of
people being unhealthy

1270
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:05,250
that it's in their interest to have
people continue to be unhealthy.

1271
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:10,589
And so that's why you don't see
an enormous national effort

1272
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:13,425
to try to improve the quality
of the American diet

1273
01:15:13,593 --> 01:15:15,886
or people's food choices.

1274
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:18,263
ls that why you see health
insurance companies

1275
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:20,307
buying stock in fast
food companies?

1276
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:24,644
That is exactly why you see
health insurance companies

1277
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:26,897
buying stock in fast
food companies?

1278
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:29,608
They're just
covering their bets.

1279
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:35,906
Unless we address this as a society
and stop blaming the fat person,

1280
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:37,449
we're gonna be in big trouble.

1281
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:39,743
We're gonna have huge
health consequences

1282
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:42,329
and huge economic
consequences, as well.

1283
01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:46,791
We've been down
this road before.

1284
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:51,922
This isn't the first time our children
have been sold a bill of goods

1285
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:54,674
that leads to addiction
and disease.

1286
01:15:56,636 --> 01:15:59,763
What's been the great public
health success to date?

1287
01:15:59,931 --> 01:16:01,139
lt's tobacco.

1288
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:03,850
♪ Smooth and fresh

1289
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:09,689
♪ Is the Newport taste ♪

1290
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:11,816
We used to view the
cigarette as our friend,

1291
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:15,362
something that was sexy, that was
glamorous, something that we wanted.

1292
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:17,030
What did we do with tobacco?

1293
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:19,532
We demonized the
tobacco industry.

1294
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,118
We changed how we
perceived that product.

1295
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,163
We knew as early as 1 950

1296
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,749
that there was a link between
smoking and lung cancer.

1297
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:33,380
Do you swear that the testimony
you are about to give

1298
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:35,757
is the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1299
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,008
l do.

1300
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:41,388
But Big Tobacco would deny the
science for the next 50 years.

1301
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:44,683
Cigarettes and nicotine
clearly do not meet

1302
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:47,560
the classic definitions
of addiction.

1303
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:50,063
The public finally saw that
they were doing deceptive

1304
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:53,358
and misleading things
and so we took them on.

1305
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:55,902
Government took them on.
The media took them on.

1306
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:59,155
lt's been 30 years since the first
report linked smoking and cancer.

1307
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:02,617
There's disturbing news about
teenagers and smoking.

1308
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:04,911
The U.S. was the first to
require warning labels

1309
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:09,040
on every cigarette pack.
But we didn't stop there.

1310
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,418
A number of decades ago
there was something around

1311
01:17:11,585 --> 01:17:15,171
called the Fairness Doctrine and
for every tobacco ad that got run

1312
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:19,009
the networks had to free up time
for anti-tobacco advertisement.

1313
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:21,845
Smoke now, pay later.

1314
01:17:22,013 --> 01:17:24,347
Whatever you do,
just don't smoke.

1315
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:26,474
The tobacco industry found

1316
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:29,019
it was getting battered by
these advertisements and said

1317
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:32,605
we will voluntarily take our
advertising off television.

1318
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:34,566
Come to where the flavor is.

1319
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:37,402
It wasn't long before
smoking ads were removed

1320
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:39,487
from almost all public space.

1321
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,406
And with greater
public awareness

1322
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:44,659
smoking was banned
from all airlines.

1323
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:47,620
And as early as 1 975

1324
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:52,584
individual states began regulating
smoking in public places

1325
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:55,503
and taxing packs of cigarettes.

1326
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:59,716
After we banned it, all of
Western Europe went smoke-free.

1327
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:02,802
You would tell me in a million
years the lrish, the ltalians,

1328
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:05,221
the Spanish, the
English, the French...

1329
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,974
they don't smoke
indoors anymore.

1330
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:10,060
Today we view the
cigarette for what it is,

1331
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:13,813
a deadly, disgusting,
addictive product.

1332
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:17,734
As a result of this critical
change in perception,

1333
01:18:17,902 --> 01:18:22,655
the number of American high schoolers
who smoke has been cut in half

1334
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:24,991
in just the last 20 years.

1335
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:30,163
Where would we be
if we hadn't acted?

1336
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:33,041
The Flintstones has been
brought to you by Winston,

1337
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:37,629
America's best-selling,
best-tasting filter cigarette.

1338
01:18:37,797 --> 01:18:43,093
♪ Winston tastes good
like a cigarette should ♪

1339
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,346
Junk food companies are acting very
much like tobacco companies did

1340
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:49,182
30 and 40 years ago.

1341
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:52,769
l need your Fruity Pebbles!
Really fruity!

1342
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:55,397
Post Fruity Pebbles cereal, part
of this complete breakfast.

1343
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,399
Years from now we're gonna say,

1344
01:18:57,566 --> 01:19:00,068
"l can't believe we let
them get away with that."

1345
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:02,112
There is no evidence
that the consumption

1346
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:03,863
of soft drinks in
secondary schools

1347
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:06,908
is inconsistent with
sound nutrition science

1348
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:14,666
The argument you're making is to
advance the sales of your soft drinks

1349
01:19:14,834 --> 01:19:18,461
with the hopes that these students
will get used to them enough...

1350
01:19:18,629 --> 01:19:21,005
l hesitate to use the word
"hooked on 'em" enough.

1351
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:24,843
l'm suggesting, Senator,
that in a well-balanced diet

1352
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,178
we all need to consume
two liters of liquid.

1353
01:19:27,346 --> 01:19:30,890
Soft drinks can certainly supply
part of that liquid intake

1354
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:33,393
and l would reject
entirely any argument

1355
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:35,603
that they are in any
way harmful for you.

1356
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:41,443
Sometimes l just wanna say, "Don't
you have any shame at all?"

1357
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:44,612
lsn't there something
inside of you that says,

1358
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,157
"You know, what we're
doing is not right."

1359
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:50,410
They have to know, just
like the tobacco companies.

1360
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:53,580
How could these people
sleep at night for years

1361
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:58,251
knowing they were lying through their
teeth about tobacco and cancer

1362
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:02,255
and yet they just kept pushing
those tobacco products out there?

1363
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:05,884
lt's the same way with
big food companies

1364
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,889
l just... l don't know how...

1365
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:12,974
l-l don't know how they
can live with themselves.

1366
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:20,023
Soda is the cigarettes
of the 21st century,

1367
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:22,942
and the sooner we get that clear

1368
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:26,321
the sooner we get rid of these
idiotic arguments about

1369
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:28,990
free speech allows us to sell
things that are poisonous.

1370
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:36,080
The obesity epidemic, the
diseases that fast food places...

1371
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:38,750
hamburgers, soda pop, whatever...
cause.

1372
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,878
We've had this information
for decades...

1373
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:45,173
and we've failed to act on it
until now it's catastrophic.

1374
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:49,010
l'm trying... l'm trying
to save my life...

1375
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:53,848
and protect myself from dying
of heart attack, seizures,

1376
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:56,643
anything... diabetes, anything.

1377
01:20:58,187 --> 01:21:02,607
l just want y'all to realize...
that y'all killin' yourselves.

1378
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:04,651
'Cause l've already realized it.

1379
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:07,487
l'm just making sure
y'all do, you guys do.

1380
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:09,280
At our current rate

1381
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:15,537
over 95% of all Americans will be
overweight or obese in two decades.

1382
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:21,251
By 2050, one out of every three
Americans will have diabetes.

1383
01:21:25,005 --> 01:21:27,173
As we look to the work
force of the future,

1384
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,885
where will the soldiers and sailors and
first-responders... cops, firemen...

1385
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:33,555
Where will they come from when
we have a generation of children

1386
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:34,806
that will be physically unfit

1387
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:37,475
and saddled with a lot of
disease that's all preventable.

1388
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:43,773
The financial aspects
of this are staggering.

1389
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:48,486
75% of our health care dollar goes
to the maintenance or treatment

1390
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:51,155
of chronic metabolic disease.

1391
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:53,825
lf you think the national
debt is a problem right now,

1392
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:56,286
wait till you see the tsunami
of debt that's coming

1393
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:59,956
from the health care
impact of obesity.

1394
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:02,792
lt's going to be
an enormous burden

1395
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,878
that we are going to be placing
on the shoulders of our children.

1396
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:09,591
l want people to know
that childhood obesity

1397
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:16,055
isn't as simple as TV and
the press make it seem.

1398
01:22:16,223 --> 01:22:18,683
And even Mrs. Obama.

1399
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:22,395
lt's like, no matter
how hard you try,

1400
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:25,607
it's always going to
be an ongoing battle.

1401
01:22:27,735 --> 01:22:31,070
When Michelle Obama launched
her "Let's Move" campaign,

1402
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:34,324
she said this isn't about
demonizing any food industry,

1403
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:36,576
which is a very politically
sensible thing to do.

1404
01:22:36,744 --> 01:22:38,911
The problem is, if you
want to cure obesity,

1405
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:41,497
you have to demonize
some food industries.

1406
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:43,458
Let's move! Let's move!
Let's move!

1407
01:22:43,626 --> 01:22:46,919
l think Michelle Obama has
been a wonderful force

1408
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:49,797
in the nation's attempt to
address childhood obesity.

1409
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:54,302
Um, but my guess is that she and
other people in the administration

1410
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:57,722
have to be aware of the lobbying
might of the food industry

1411
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:01,100
and have to go easier on
them than they may want to.

1412
01:23:01,268 --> 01:23:05,271
l hope with time, because of the
public support for these initiatives

1413
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:08,316
that the politicians will have the
courage to take on the industry

1414
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:10,568
the way it really
needs to happen.

1415
01:23:17,076 --> 01:23:18,660
There are other countries now

1416
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:21,329
who have prohibited junk
food marketing to kids

1417
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:25,625
stopped serving junk food in
schools, started taxing soda...

1418
01:23:25,793 --> 01:23:28,753
These are things that l'd like
to see us leading the way on.

1419
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:31,047
lnstead, we're leading the way on
producing the world's deadliest diet

1420
01:23:31,215 --> 01:23:33,716
and basically exporting
it to other countries.

1421
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:37,387
l think the thing that has frustrated
me more than anything else

1422
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:42,433
in my now almost 30-year
campaign against obesity

1423
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:45,144
and trying to get
healthful lifestyles.

1424
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:50,608
The most frustrating thing is just
the way the deck is just stacked

1425
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:53,528
against being healthy.

1426
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:59,283
Right now healthy eating
is like swimming upstream.

1427
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:00,702
lf you want to eat better,

1428
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:04,414
you have to work so hard
against the food environment

1429
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:07,208
which is always pushing
you to eat more.

1430
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:10,044
l think the attitude that
someone else is gonna change it

1431
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:11,754
is the wrong attitude.

1432
01:24:11,922 --> 01:24:14,424
lf we want better conditions

1433
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:18,803
each of us has to do something
to make that happen.

1434
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:23,099
We need to come together as a
society to protect our children

1435
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:27,061
just like we have with seat
belt laws and car seat laws.

1436
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:30,231
We're not gonna tell anybody what
they're gonna feed their kids.

1437
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:33,651
We're just gonna try to
make it easier for parents

1438
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:35,695
to do what they
already want to do,

1439
01:24:35,863 --> 01:24:38,656
which is feed their
child more healthfully.

1440
01:24:44,705 --> 01:24:48,040
Some people are already trying
to change the environment

1441
01:24:48,292 --> 01:24:51,419
and improve the conditions
for our children.

1442
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:54,881
There are even some kids who are
taking on their own schools.

1443
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:58,509
in order to remove sugar-sweetened
beverages from the cafeteria.

1444
01:25:00,179 --> 01:25:02,889
There are also revolutionary
food fighters

1445
01:25:03,056 --> 01:25:05,558
who are not waiting
on government action.

1446
01:25:05,726 --> 01:25:08,811
l want to tell you about what
is in some of these products.

1447
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:12,565
- Okay, everyone...
- Four scoops of sugar.

1448
01:25:12,733 --> 01:25:15,401
They're educating kids on
the toxic effects of sugar.

1449
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:17,111
They are all the same.

1450
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:22,825
Reimagining how you can feed
kids real food on a budget.

1451
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:27,371
By serving the local fresh beans
we're saving about $4,000 a year.

1452
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:29,832
Our business model is to
go into underserved areas

1453
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,710
into food deserts and try
to make them food oases

1454
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:38,174
and make sure we bring access to
fresh, affordable healthy food.

1455
01:25:38,342 --> 01:25:41,511
Many of these places have
seen modest decreases

1456
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:43,846
in their childhood obesity rate.

1457
01:25:44,014 --> 01:25:45,848
So we've made some progress.

1458
01:25:46,016 --> 01:25:49,393
lt's not as much as we'd like,
it's not as much as we need

1459
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:52,063
but therein lies some hope.

1460
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:57,902
This is supposed to be the first
generation of American children

1461
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:01,155
expected to lead shorter lives
than their parents did.

1462
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:04,408
So we have to ask ourselves, what
legacy are we leaving our children?

1463
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:09,080
What kind of conditions are we exposing
them to that would make this come true?

1464
01:26:09,248 --> 01:26:13,709
lt's a call to action to do something
pretty courageous against this problem.

1465
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:18,548
What if every can of soda

1466
01:26:18,715 --> 01:26:22,468
came with a warning label
from the Surgeon General?

1467
01:26:22,636 --> 01:26:26,222
What if fast food chains were
banned from all public schools?

1468
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:30,560
What if every time you
looked at a nutrition label

1469
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:33,354
you'd actually see the
percentage next to sugar?

1470
01:26:35,482 --> 01:26:39,610
What if every time a
celebrity sold a soft drink,

1471
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:43,072
they also had to
pitch a vegetable?

1472
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:46,409
How would academics improve?

1473
01:26:46,577 --> 01:26:49,036
How much more productive
would we become?

1474
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:53,457
How much money and how
many lives could we save?

1475
01:26:55,878 --> 01:26:58,337
l think the government has a
leading role to play here.

1476
01:26:58,505 --> 01:27:00,631
We just got a long way to go.

1477
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:03,426
Now, you can wait around
for the ideal day

1478
01:27:03,594 --> 01:27:06,053
when government regulation
will be perfect.

1479
01:27:07,389 --> 01:27:10,975
Meanwhile, you gotta keep
working the food industry

1480
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:14,103
to get them to change.

1481
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:16,898
But you have to change
the diet of America.

1482
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:20,776
That's the most important thing.
The exercise is important.

1483
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:22,862
All these things are important.

1484
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:26,032
But we've gotta change the way
we produce and consume food.

1485
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:37,168
My mom always said people make
time for what they want to.

1486
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:42,298
lt's a matter of
priority, you know.

1487
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:46,928
Being willing to put forth the effort
and the time that it takes to change.

1488
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:52,141
The kids' health, my health,
my husband's health,

1489
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:56,187
definitely more important than any
chocolate l have in the cabinet,

1490
01:27:56,355 --> 01:27:58,481
more than any piece of cake.

1491
01:27:58,649 --> 01:28:02,485
And even as much as l want to
take the chocolate and hide it,

1492
01:28:02,653 --> 01:28:05,821
it still has made me think.

1493
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:07,531
l've gotta choose.

1494
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:13,496
l've gotta choose between
helping Brady or...

1495
01:28:13,664 --> 01:28:15,122
or getting rid of the chocolate.

1496
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:19,251
l know what's more
important in here.

1497
01:28:19,419 --> 01:28:21,837
lt's just hard.

1498
01:28:22,005 --> 01:28:24,382
But it's a matter of priority

1499
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:26,425
and l really want to change.

1500
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:37,353
- Ohh!
- What?

1501
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:41,065
This is our new recipe
we're fixin' to taste.

1502
01:28:50,534 --> 01:28:54,704
l am excited. l can't believe
how different l feel.

1503
01:28:54,871 --> 01:29:00,584
And l'm so happy that, um, a
light switch just came on.

1504
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:05,214
lt's not an easy transition to
real food, but it starts locally.

1505
01:29:05,382 --> 01:29:08,134
lt starts, really, as
local as our fork.

1506
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:12,346
And everybody has a choice three times
a day what they put on that thing.

1507
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:18,060
The most important
thing you can do...

1508
01:29:18,228 --> 01:29:21,647
and it's challenging for many people...
is cook real food.

1509
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:24,817
You can forget about nutrients. You
don't have to worry about sugars.

1510
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:28,779
lf you cook real food, your family
will be eating much better.

1511
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:33,075
Does it look like it
comes from nature?

1512
01:29:33,243 --> 01:29:36,287
Or is it a product with a long
list of artificial ingredients?

1513
01:29:36,455 --> 01:29:39,081
That's a distinction between
real and fake foods

1514
01:29:39,249 --> 01:29:41,375
that even a
five-year-old can get.

1515
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:43,669
Lot of sugar, huh?

1516
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:47,048
Third ingredient.

1517
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:49,550
That's not real.

1518
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:51,761
l thought l knew the way
it was supposed to be

1519
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:56,307
but in truth l had no
idea what the truth was.

1520
01:29:56,475 --> 01:29:58,559
And l think so many
kids in America

1521
01:29:58,727 --> 01:30:02,605
don't even know what it
really means to eat healthy.

1522
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:07,068
Nicholas, you are eating
asparagus, l'm so proud of you.

1523
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:09,570
This is the way we're
supposed to eat all the time.

1524
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:11,906
Not just for a diet or detox.

1525
01:30:12,074 --> 01:30:14,867
We're supposed to eat like
this for the rest of our life.

1526
01:30:15,035 --> 01:30:16,952
And that's what l want it to be.

1527
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,830
John is eating his
sweet potatoes.

1528
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,724
It started out as
such a small story...

1529
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:41,769
about weight, diet and exercise.

1530
01:30:44,147 --> 01:30:48,109
For the majority of kids,
there is no happy ending.

1531
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:54,365
It's time for a new story
about the food we eat...

1532
01:30:54,533 --> 01:30:57,201
and the environment we
want for our children.

1533
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:02,915
This has to be about the
food, not the weight.

1534
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:05,084
l mean, why don't diets work?

1535
01:31:05,252 --> 01:31:09,630
Sure, for 30 days, 60 days,
90 days l can deprive myself,

1536
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:13,134
l can lose the weight.

1537
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:15,719
But then l go back in the
environment, l get cued again,

1538
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:17,805
my brain gets hijacked.

1539
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:24,019
So of course l'm going
to gain the weight back.

1540
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:28,315
Unless we dramatically change the
environment, take away all these cues,

1541
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:30,568
we're never gonna be able
to protect our kids.
