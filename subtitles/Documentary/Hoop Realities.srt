1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,282
I like these.

2
00:00:00,392 --> 00:00:04,328
I been gettin; like, two a week
from the school for...

3
00:00:05,531 --> 00:00:07,431
a couple of months.

4
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:09,694
So that's quite a few.

5
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:14,034
I know you're game,
but, Monica,you seem very overwrought.

6
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,733
I had Division I offers.

7
00:00:18,844 --> 00:00:20,473
I had even signed at Marquette

8
00:00:20,474 --> 00:00:22,940
'cause they thought I
was gonna make the grades.

9
00:00:25,684 --> 00:00:27,845
The great ballplayers...

10
00:00:27,953 --> 00:00:30,854
they care about basketball
more than they care about school...

11
00:00:30,956 --> 00:00:33,288
and I know they do.

12
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,437
Shaky. Shaky.

13
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:52,300
Ohh.!

14
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:54,311
Let me try somethin;!

15
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:58,244
If you're looking for
a progressive college basketball program...

16
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,410
with experienced leadership
and a winning tradition...

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,887
then the Marquette Warriors
are for you.

18
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,891
William's first home recruiting visit.

19
00:01:07,993 --> 00:01:09,927
Three top schools postpone visits...

20
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,943
preferring to wait and
see how William will do

21
00:01:12,944 --> 00:01:14,692
his senior year at St. Joe's.

22
00:01:15,968 --> 00:01:18,528
If you don't make the test score,
it doesn't mean we don't want you...

23
00:01:18,637 --> 00:01:20,537
because we still do-
that's what I'm telling you.

24
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:22,539
If you tear your knee out
again this year...

25
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:24,541
and you can't
play ever again...

26
00:01:24,643 --> 00:01:27,009
you're gonna have your education
paid for at Marquette University.

27
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:29,945
I know that the scholarship
is one-year renewable.

28
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:34,075
Gene's right about this, but any school
worth its salt is gonna give you four years.

29
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:37,212
The bottom line is this-
we want to win the national title.

30
00:01:37,322 --> 00:01:40,018
Number two- I wanna make you
the best player I can.

31
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:43,026
I wanna give you an opportunity
to, maybe someday...

32
00:01:43,128 --> 00:01:46,256
be one of those guys that makes
some money in Europe or in the NBA.

33
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:49,857
You're one of seven guys
that we're recruiting right now.

34
00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:52,937
- You're recruiting seven guys?
- Seven guys for three spots.

35
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:56,506
Where he fit in?

36
00:01:56,608 --> 00:01:58,508
- Where does he fit in?
- Yeah.

37
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,170
As soon as William tells me
he's not looking at any other schools...

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,145
then I'm not looking at
any other players.

39
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,648
So, what?
The first one sign, that's -

40
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,948
Well- Well, that's what
it's gonna come down to.

41
00:02:09,054 --> 00:02:11,955
If I tell you that, hey,
you're our guy and this and that...

42
00:02:12,057 --> 00:02:14,958
and I lose you to Kansas, Indiana,
North Carolina State or something...

43
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,960
I'm out ofluck.

44
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:19,792
The president's saying to me,
"I thought you were recruiting a guard. '"

45
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:22,833
It's a tough situation,
but it's something that has to be done.

46
00:02:43,155 --> 00:02:45,055
It's a great place.

47
00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:47,148
We're gettin'ready
to have it rockin;

48
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,127
The best is yet to come.

49
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:56,491
Lot of serious ballplayers
been through this building-

50
00:02:56,602 --> 00:03:01,266
Junior Bridgeman, Sidney Moncrief,
Bob Lanier, Oscar Robertson.

51
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:07,201
Can you see yourself playing
in this place here, 18,000 in it?

52
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,509
Big difference from St. Joe's, now.

53
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,553
We stayed at the hyatt.

54
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,954
Man, it was nice. Real nice.

55
00:03:20,058 --> 00:03:23,585
They had these balloons
all hangin' up on the ceiling, everything.

56
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:26,323
They-They really did it up.

57
00:03:26,431 --> 00:03:29,025
And I must say, we did it up too.

58
00:03:29,134 --> 00:03:34,333
We - Room service.
Man!

59
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:37,465
had these phony newspapers written up.

60
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:40,704
Notre Dame 77, Marquette 76.

61
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:44,908
Gates is out high, calling for the ball.!
There are six seconds left.

62
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:48,509
The freshman spins past the defender,
slicing to his left to the foul line.

63
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,350
Three seconds left.
Marquette down by one.

64
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:54,254
Gates launches a running one-hander.!
It's on the way.!

65
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,351
It is good.!

66
00:03:57,462 --> 00:04:02,456
Gates buries a 13-footer
just ahead of the horn...

67
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:06,163
and Marquette
has defeated Notre Dame.!

68
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:09,001
If you think we care about you
a lot in recruiting...

69
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:11,268
we're gonna do more
when you're here.

70
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,140
Don't let it get to a
point where somebody else

71
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:14,573
comes in and takes a scholarship away.

72
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:19,883
Let us know what you wanna do-
unless you know what you wanna do right now.

73
00:04:19,985 --> 00:04:22,954
he knows, but he won't say.

74
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:32,094
You talked to any, uh...

75
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:35,098
leading black people on the campus?

76
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,100
- The leading black people?
- Yeah.

77
00:04:37,202 --> 00:04:39,102
- Such as?
- Whoever might be in charge...

78
00:04:39,204 --> 00:04:41,104
of all the black students on campus -

79
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:44,107
what kind of community life
they have for the blacks there.

80
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:46,109
- Uh -
- Did you talk to anyone about it?

81
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:47,835
- Did you ask the players
how they're treated?

82
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:48,111
- Yeah.

83
00:04:48,213 --> 00:04:50,113
- What'd they say?
- Players say they treated fine.

84
00:04:50,215 --> 00:04:52,445
I mean, they get
the best of everything.

85
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:54,451
- You think that's where you wanna go?
- Yeah.

86
00:04:54,553 --> 00:04:56,316
That's fine.

87
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,023
Obviously, if you wait you'll have

88
00:04:58,024 --> 00:05:00,380
all the other schools
that were on you before...

89
00:05:00,492 --> 00:05:04,485
like Kansas and Indiana
and North Carolina State.

90
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,826
That's all right, uh, but...

91
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,832
I discussed it with -

92
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,902
I think you should take a few days.

93
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,832
Because you just came back.
You understand?

94
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,508
- Poop!
- Yeah!

95
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,805
Yea!

96
00:05:20,912 --> 00:05:22,812
Boo!

97
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,509
Is there any cash with this?

98
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,519
Uh, it's in the mail.

99
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,419
To four years of excellence.

100
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:35,152
- hear! hear!
- hear! hear!

101
00:05:39,498 --> 00:05:41,864
- It's alcohol-free.
- It's not that bad.

102
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:54,005
I am fixing him
a birthday dinner today.

103
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:56,012
It's his 18th birthday...

104
00:05:56,114 --> 00:05:59,845
and I want to show him
how much we appreciate him and love him...

105
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:01,919
and care for him.

106
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,616
Everything that you can imagine
was going wrong with this family...

107
00:06:06,725 --> 00:06:09,455
but now everybody's together.

108
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:11,859
It's his favorite cake.

109
00:06:11,963 --> 00:06:14,158
he's a great kid.

110
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:17,724
And some kids don't live
to get this age, you know.

111
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:21,067
That's another thing
to be proud about -

112
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:24,301
that, you know,
it's his 18th birthday, he lived...

113
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:28,175
and to get to see 18, that's good.

114
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:35,478
I wanna tell you that I love you very much.
I'm very proud of you.

115
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:39,956
It seems like I was 18 just yesterday.
here. happy birthday. I love
you.

116
00:06:40,058 --> 00:06:41,958
- Ohh.!
- hey-hey.!

117
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,960
- happy birthday!
- I love you too.!

118
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:47,327
- Come over here.
- Where you goin', homes?

119
00:06:47,432 --> 00:06:49,627
Where you goin', homes?

120
00:06:58,243 --> 00:07:00,143
Blow out the candles.!

121
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:04,647
Two months after his 18th birthday...

122
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,116
Arthur is cut off public aid.

123
00:07:08,153 --> 00:07:10,053
This is what I brought to their attention.

124
00:07:10,155 --> 00:07:12,453
he's still a full-time student.
he hasn't graduated yet.

125
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,957
So why would you-all cut him off?

126
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,960
- I'll bite you!
- I'll bite you back.

127
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,962
They feel like when they get 18...

128
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,464
most the black kids
they drop out.

129
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:25,024
So that means that the child
is just thrown out there.

130
00:07:27,205 --> 00:07:31,164
I was gettin' 368.
Now I get 268.

131
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,504
And that's it.

132
00:07:35,614 --> 00:07:39,072
And that's to take care of me
from one month to the next.

133
00:07:41,453 --> 00:07:43,853
Now, can you imagine
a person living on that?

134
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:46,924
Do you-all wonder sometime,
how am I livin'?

135
00:07:48,193 --> 00:07:52,129
Or how do my children survive,
or how they livin'?

136
00:07:53,398 --> 00:07:58,358
It's enough to make people really wanna go
out there and lash out and hurt somebody.

137
00:08:00,238 --> 00:08:02,832
A message to the Oreo cookie.

138
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:06,638
No matter how much you wanna switch,
here's what they think about you:

139
00:08:06,745 --> 00:08:11,341
Fried chicken
and biscuit-eatin'monkey, ape, baboon...

140
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,612
big-thighed, fast-runnin;
high-jumpin; spear-chuckin;..

141
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:18,177
360-degree basketball-dunkin;..

142
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,520
pit-swingin'spade moulanyan.

143
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,061
Go the fuck back to Africa.
Go the fuck back to Africa.

144
00:08:24,162 --> 00:08:26,062
Go the fuck back to Africa.

145
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:28,064
Think about it. Fuckin'sellout.

146
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:32,228
Play the music, motherfucker!
Put the music on!

147
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,038
Shoot it.

148
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:48,245
Rebound.! Go, go, go.!

149
00:08:53,058 --> 00:08:55,026
Gates stinks.

150
00:08:55,126 --> 00:08:57,788
You got that? he stinks.

151
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,030
he doesn't play with confidence,
like he did before he was injured.

152
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,203
I don't believe the other players
have complete confidence in William.

153
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:16,743
They were in awe of William
when he was a sophomore.

154
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,146
They're not in awe ofhim anymore.

155
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:43,506
Sophomore year...

156
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:45,803
I was just carefree.

157
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:51,480
If it could be done,
I was gonna do it.

158
00:09:52,517 --> 00:09:55,577
I wish I could
get that attitude back.

159
00:10:01,693 --> 00:10:03,160
Go.!

160
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,621
hold up.!
That's crap.!

161
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,199
That is dog-shit crap.!

162
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,931
Why did you have to
do something unnecessarily?

163
00:10:13,038 --> 00:10:17,270
If you would've kept it over here, William -
Look at me!

164
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:21,778
If you had kept it over here, wide,
you could have gone all the way.

165
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,338
What is that crap,
the shovel pass?

166
00:10:26,785 --> 00:10:29,185
There was never any point in our school...

167
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:33,815
where wejust-
just played outright,you know.

168
00:10:35,827 --> 00:10:39,388
Now, remember, think about the ball game
on the way to the game.

169
00:10:55,146 --> 00:10:56,875
I'll bet a nickel.

170
00:10:56,982 --> 00:10:58,779
If I got a nickel.

171
00:10:58,883 --> 00:11:01,113
Yeah, I got it!

172
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:03,119
Marshall began its season well...

173
00:11:03,221 --> 00:11:05,121
winning four of six.

174
00:11:05,223 --> 00:11:08,056
Today's game will be their first
against a city power.

175
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:12,359
The only way you gonna beat them
is to play good basketball.

176
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,864
All that bullshit that you be playin' -

177
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:18,129
You play half of a game, for two
or three minutes you play pretty good...

178
00:11:18,236 --> 00:11:20,136
then you go to sleep.

179
00:11:20,238 --> 00:11:22,706
You have to play a whole ball game.

180
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:31,671
When we start out,
Arthur will be completely in the ball game.

181
00:11:33,952 --> 00:11:37,615
But as the game progresses,
then he digresses.

182
00:11:50,702 --> 00:11:55,435
By halftime, Marshall trails
highly favored Dunbar by 15 points.

183
00:12:06,651 --> 00:12:08,551
But late in the fourth quarter...

184
00:12:08,653 --> 00:12:10,883
Arthur and the Commandos
claw their way back.

185
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,358
On a crucial possession...

186
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,428
the ball goes to Arthur.

187
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:31,409
hey, boy!
Gimme some, boy!

188
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,338
hey, Arthur G!

189
00:12:36,748 --> 00:12:41,082
hey, Arthur G! You ever got rich,
they'd catch you for sure! Come here, dog!

190
00:12:43,188 --> 00:12:45,088
That's it, man.!
Showin'your beef!.

191
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,886
I want it up high, G.
I want it up high.

192
00:12:58,002 --> 00:13:00,903
Led by William's 16 points a game...

193
00:13:01,005 --> 00:13:03,337
the Chargers have a 20 and 3 record.

194
00:13:03,441 --> 00:13:06,376
But Coach Pingatore feels they're not ready
for the impending play-offs.

195
00:13:06,478 --> 00:13:09,379
Alabama.! Alabama.!

196
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:11,244
Alabama.!

197
00:13:19,724 --> 00:13:22,386
Well, don't throw the ball!

198
00:13:22,494 --> 00:13:25,622
Jesus, will you cut it out
and quit acting like a baby!

199
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,698
Will you quit cryin'!

200
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:31,497
This team just drives me crazy.

201
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,765
It's been a struggle all year.

202
00:13:35,907 --> 00:13:37,807
You think you're better than you are.

203
00:13:37,909 --> 00:13:40,036
The two big guys are prima donnas.

204
00:13:40,145 --> 00:13:42,909
They should be killin'people.

205
00:13:43,014 --> 00:13:45,915
For you people
that are really agonizing...

206
00:13:46,017 --> 00:13:49,919
andjust hate all this stuff
and all the hollering...

207
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:53,047
if you don't make a turn,
it'll be over next week...

208
00:13:53,158 --> 00:13:55,126
so you won't have to worry about it.

209
00:13:55,226 --> 00:13:57,558
That's the point.

210
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:03,266
I wanna end this game
in the next three to four minutes.

211
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:06,337
Otherwise it's gonna be a ball game.
All right, let's go get 'em. Come on.

212
00:14:06,437 --> 00:14:08,337
hail Mary, full of grace.

213
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:10,339
Blessed art thou -

214
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:11,457
holy Mary, Mother of
God, pray for us sinners

215
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,341
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

216
00:14:12,443 --> 00:14:14,343
All right, let's go.
Come on.

217
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,480
William's just too nice of a kid.

218
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,710
I don't know ifhe has
the killer temperament.

219
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,286
I don't know ifhe has
the eye of the tiger.

220
00:14:23,388 --> 00:14:25,913
he's gonna need that
when he goes to the next level.

221
00:14:26,024 --> 00:14:27,992
Remember, square up!

222
00:14:30,195 --> 00:14:32,629
It's business, it's big bucks...

223
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,630
and that's what the scholarship's for.

224
00:14:34,732 --> 00:14:36,632
Good job.

225
00:14:56,554 --> 00:14:58,954
- his coach is stingy and selfish.
- My coach is not -

226
00:14:59,057 --> 00:15:01,457
he just want William
to run out there and play-

227
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,891
- My coach is not stingy and selfish.
- Yes, he is!

228
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:07,396
The day she was gonna be born
I told him he had to be there.

229
00:15:07,498 --> 00:15:10,399
I don't care what his coach say.
I know the game was important.

230
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:15,165
But this was more important,
and his coach doesn't see it like that.

231
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:17,173
I just can't miss a game...

232
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:20,176
just because, you know,
an incident occur...

233
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:22,769
unless it was like a death
or somethin' like that.

234
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,646
This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
Ain't like the girl was born every day.

235
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:30,152
That's what I was tryin' to get you to say.

236
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:33,315
Especially around that time
of the year too - state tournament.

237
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:35,892
It was simply out of the question.

238
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:40,123
he tells me,
"Well, it'll benefit us in the future. '"

239
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,131
I'm, like, "But what about now?"

240
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,133
he keeps sayin' in the fu -

241
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,669
Basketball was my ticket
out of the ghetto.

242
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:49,672
If I wouldn't have been playin'ball,
I would not even be goin'to college.

243
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:52,834
I'm goin' to college, and I have a daughter.
So what's my excuse?

244
00:15:52,944 --> 00:15:55,071
- Because the situations are much different.
- No, it's not.

245
00:16:27,478 --> 00:16:30,572
I haven't been workin'for about a year.

246
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,584
And if it wasn't for William
knowing Miss Wier...

247
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:39,589
I wouldn't even be here.

248
00:16:39,691 --> 00:16:41,568
'Cause I walked in the door and that's

249
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:44,185
the first thing I see on the sign
- "No openings. "

250
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:48,698
It ain't much better than a person
without a college degree can get.

251
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:53,900
So I feel like I'll be here
for quite a while.

252
00:17:06,184 --> 00:17:08,414
What you lookin' at?

253
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:12,751
I don't believe people
when they be sayin; "Wow, school's hard.!'"

254
00:17:12,857 --> 00:17:15,348
The work weren't hard for me.

255
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,020
All right. I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.

256
00:17:18,129 --> 00:17:21,030
If I gotta do, like,
a report or somethin;..

257
00:17:21,132 --> 00:17:24,966
I don't like none of the topics,
so I'll just pick somethin'that's simple.

258
00:17:27,972 --> 00:17:30,236
So, what's the topic of your paper?

259
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,673
The life cycle of the butterfly.

260
00:17:32,777 --> 00:17:35,678
- Gonna read it for us?
- Mm-mmm.

261
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,680
Aw, come on.!

262
00:17:37,782 --> 00:17:39,682
No, man!

263
00:17:39,784 --> 00:17:42,617
- I wanna hear it-
- I'm just doin' this stuff!.

264
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,280
I know, but I just wanna hear
how you write.

265
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,790
"Well, as the people bloom
into another year-"

266
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:50,486
You know, the year just changed,
January 1.

267
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:52,495
"The butterfly also blooms.

268
00:17:52,597 --> 00:17:54,997
The butterfly are very beautiful
flying objects. "

269
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:57,300
Then it say at the
beginning of the butterfly,

270
00:17:57,301 --> 00:17:59,126
it goes through a change and all that.

271
00:17:59,237 --> 00:18:02,138
Then I keep goin', man.
I just wanna, like, do that stuff.

272
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,141
Then I'll just keep goin'
on and on and on...

273
00:18:05,243 --> 00:18:07,211
and I won't never stop.

274
00:18:08,613 --> 00:18:11,377
Move out the way! Move!
Look out! Move out the way!

275
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:16,381
Its botanical name is Cannabis sativa.

276
00:18:17,989 --> 00:18:21,117
Millions of Americans
break the law and use it.

277
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,125
Arthur's latest report card shows...

278
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,889
he's failing
both Spanish and Science.

279
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:28,831
he rushes through his work.

280
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:31,424
As you see,
he just missed one assignment.

281
00:18:31,536 --> 00:18:33,436
Mm-hmm.

282
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:35,438
But his test scores were pretty low.

283
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,031
- he had a 10 on one test.
- Mmm-mm-mmm.

284
00:18:38,142 --> 00:18:40,042
Will you do me a favor?

285
00:18:40,144 --> 00:18:44,046
When you see things are slippin' like this,
give me a call and let me know.

286
00:18:44,148 --> 00:18:46,548
Let me make sure I have
the right phone number.

287
00:18:46,651 --> 00:18:48,551
So I can stay up on top of this boy.

288
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:50,553
Because he tells you one thing -

289
00:18:50,655 --> 00:18:54,056
I say, "Where your book?" "We didn't have to
work on the book. It's
in my locker. "

290
00:18:54,158 --> 00:18:56,786
he gonna have to start
showin' me somethin' better.

291
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,638
he probably on the borderline,

292
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,096
and all that clownin',
people just give him an "F."

293
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,100
That's what I would do too.

294
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:07,103
But I'm gon' stay up on his behind
this time around.

295
00:19:07,205 --> 00:19:10,606
'Cause I told him we payin' 181-odd dollars
out there to St. Joseph's...

296
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,608
Right.

297
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,109
for his transcripts.

298
00:19:14,212 --> 00:19:16,483
he got the transcripts
and he ain't doin' that?

299
00:19:16,484 --> 00:19:18,376
Uh-uh. It ain't gonna happen like that.

300
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,689
Man.!

301
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,521
You remember I told you,
whatever I start I finish.

302
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,927
I'm not like some people I know.

303
00:19:34,031 --> 00:19:36,295
I don't need nobody to push me.

304
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:41,396
All I gotta do is have the goal
and the motivation, and I'm ready.

305
00:19:41,506 --> 00:19:43,804
It's Sheila's graduation day...

306
00:19:43,908 --> 00:19:46,809
from a nurse's assistants class
at a local community center.

307
00:19:46,911 --> 00:19:49,812
A high grade
will assure her certification.

308
00:19:49,914 --> 00:19:52,542
I want to be an R.N. nurse.

309
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,709
I've always had that dream.

310
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:59,619
Well, Miss Agee.

311
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:09,031
- Sheila.
- hmm?

312
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:12,569
You scored 89 on the exam.

313
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,572
You're gonna get the highest
grade point average for the class.

314
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,074
Really? Really?

315
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,144
No, no, no, no!

316
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:25,947
Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you!

317
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,518
Oh, I'm so happy!

318
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:30,849
Oh, thank you, Miss Martin!

319
00:20:30,955 --> 00:20:32,855
You did it yourself.

320
00:20:32,957 --> 00:20:35,858
Oh, thank you.

321
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,121
Oh, you so good.

322
00:20:44,735 --> 00:20:47,295
I didn't think I could do it.

323
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:50,169
- I knew you could do it.
- Yeah, you did.

324
00:20:50,274 --> 00:20:52,469
You gave me that belief in myself.

325
00:20:53,678 --> 00:20:56,408
You're really inspiring me to go on.

326
00:20:57,748 --> 00:21:00,376
Not just stop right here,
but go farther.

327
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:04,320
And people told me
I wasn't gon' be anything.

328
00:22:02,046 --> 00:22:06,608
The gym is packed for today's
game against West Side rival, Westinghouse.

329
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:13,482
Marshall's rebounded
from last year's dismal 9 and 16 record...

330
00:22:13,591 --> 00:22:15,559
to go 16 and six.

331
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:22,664
And Arthur has emerged as the Commandos'
second-leading scorer and assist man.

332
00:22:26,504 --> 00:22:28,870
Rebound.!

333
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:33,010
Somejunior colleges have begun to notice.

334
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:36,671
A lot of these kids won't talk
to a junior college...

335
00:22:36,781 --> 00:22:39,341
really until after they've seen
the dream of, you know...

336
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,817
Illinois and Nevada, Las Vegas
and Georgetown kind of fade.

337
00:22:45,523 --> 00:22:48,356
Ajunior college could be Arthur's only hope.

338
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:51,360
Without better grades
and an 18 on the A.C. T...

339
00:22:51,462 --> 00:22:54,158
major colleges can't offer him
a scholarship.

340
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:56,790
It's just too bad
those kids don't realize...

341
00:22:56,901 --> 00:23:00,496
hey, if they had an 18,
the door is so much wider open.

342
00:23:00,604 --> 00:23:04,131
You're in the middle.!

343
00:23:07,611 --> 00:23:09,695
In the fourth quarter, the Commandos

344
00:23:09,696 --> 00:23:12,207
fight back from an
11-point halftime deficit.

345
00:23:12,316 --> 00:23:14,511
They trail by one.

346
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,280
We gotta play more aggressive on defense.
We're not good at playin'
on defense.

347
00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:19,583
Yeah, man.

348
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,721
Defense!

349
00:23:34,572 --> 00:23:38,702
Derrick Zinneman's layup
pushes Marshall to a one-point lead.

350
00:23:40,277 --> 00:23:42,802
Moments later,
a Westinghouse foul...

351
00:23:42,913 --> 00:23:45,227
and then a double technical puts Arthur

352
00:23:45,228 --> 00:23:47,816
on the line with a
chance to ice the victory.

353
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,236
One more! Whoo!

354
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:22,752
The upset win is sweet vindication
for the unranked Commandos.

355
00:24:43,874 --> 00:24:46,968
- Arthur Agee, you lead the books.
- Junior!

356
00:24:47,077 --> 00:24:50,137
You got seven.

357
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:53,978
Seven turnovers.
Even for the guards, that's too many.

358
00:24:55,486 --> 00:24:59,684
This is a good win for you,
but it doesn't mean anything.

359
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,849
You gotta do better than that, man.

360
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,893
You have to do better than that.

361
00:25:03,994 --> 00:25:05,894
Yeah, man.
That was a good game though.

362
00:25:05,996 --> 00:25:07,964
You could have played better though,
you know.

363
00:25:08,065 --> 00:25:10,932
Oh, Mom. You know he did good.
You'rejust killing me.

364
00:25:11,035 --> 00:25:13,435
You know your mother's proud of you.

365
00:25:13,537 --> 00:25:16,506
he been gettin' down.

366
00:25:16,607 --> 00:25:19,735
Like a real star.

367
00:25:22,246 --> 00:25:23,907
Number 11...

368
00:25:24,014 --> 00:25:27,973
Arthur Agee.!

369
00:25:30,721 --> 00:25:31,774
Nearly four years

370
00:25:31,775 --> 00:25:34,248
after discovering Arthur
on the playground...

371
00:25:34,358 --> 00:25:38,351
Earl Smith shows up to see Arthur win
his first play-off game.

372
00:25:38,462 --> 00:25:44,059
I figured this game and the next game
may be his last high school ball game.

373
00:25:46,537 --> 00:25:48,562
- Where you been, man?
- Where I been?

374
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,572
- Yeah. Where you been?
- I've been workin'.

375
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,972
- Oh, yeah, right.
- I've been following you in the paper.

376
00:25:53,077 --> 00:25:56,342
- Oh, yeah. You impressed or somethin'?
- Yeah. I'm impressed. I'm here, ain't I?

377
00:25:56,447 --> 00:25:59,883
- If I wasn't, I wouldn't have followed you.
- You been talking to Ping?

378
00:25:59,984 --> 00:26:02,214
- For what?
- You don't talk to him no more?

379
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:04,844
- Why not?
- What do I have to talk to him about?

380
00:26:04,955 --> 00:26:06,855
- Well,Jamal -
- You ain't there.

381
00:26:06,957 --> 00:26:10,393
- Yeah, you're right. I had to break out.
- Yeah.

382
00:26:11,428 --> 00:26:16,331
So I was thinkin' about goin' tonight
to see, uh, St. Joe and Nazareth play...

383
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:20,130
but I wasn't sure
if you had time to do it.

384
00:26:21,605 --> 00:26:23,573
Yeah.

385
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:28,538
I've got a bitter taste in my mouth
about a lot of things that happened.

386
00:26:28,646 --> 00:26:32,673
A lot of people accuse me
of taking youngsters...

387
00:26:32,783 --> 00:26:35,445
out of the inner city and taking them out
to St. Joe high School...

388
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,146
and they ask
what did I get out of the deal and...

389
00:26:38,255 --> 00:26:42,715
a lot of racial slurs and so forth from
my own people about me, about what I did.

390
00:26:42,826 --> 00:26:46,853
I still felt and feel
that I was doing the right thing...

391
00:26:46,964 --> 00:26:49,023
for that particular time.

392
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:52,500
Uh, sometimes I have second thoughts...

393
00:26:52,603 --> 00:26:55,538
when I see the net results
of what happened with the youngsters.

394
00:27:20,064 --> 00:27:22,123
Arthur.

395
00:27:22,232 --> 00:27:24,257
- Arthur-
- Arthur Agee, sophomore.

396
00:27:24,368 --> 00:27:26,268
My gosh. What are you doin'?

397
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,304
- What are you doin' now?
- Goin' to school.

398
00:27:28,405 --> 00:27:30,305
- Where?
- Marshall.

399
00:27:30,407 --> 00:27:33,570
Oh, I taught him.
Can you believe it?

400
00:27:33,677 --> 00:27:36,639
- So you came in case you
have to play St. Joe's?

401
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,113
- Yeah.

402
00:27:37,214 --> 00:27:39,444
Arthur. Arthur.

403
00:27:43,721 --> 00:27:45,621
- What's up, man?
- What's up, man?

404
00:27:45,723 --> 00:27:47,932
- What you been up to?
You playing basketball?

405
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:48,590
- What? Yeah.

406
00:27:48,692 --> 00:27:50,785
- how'd you guys do?
- We did a'ight. Still playin;

407
00:27:50,894 --> 00:27:53,124
Still playin'?
When's your next game?

408
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,076
- We gotta play Crane.
high school in Chicago.

409
00:27:55,077 --> 00:27:55,630
- That's cool.

410
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:57,633
It'll be all right.

411
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:26,193
William is benched
for arriving late to the locker room...

412
00:28:26,296 --> 00:28:29,197
and Nazareth threatens.

413
00:28:36,206 --> 00:28:40,165
William enters the game to go head-to-head
with Nazareth star Sean Pearson...

414
00:28:40,277 --> 00:28:43,440
his friend and roommate
from the Nike camp.

415
00:28:51,655 --> 00:28:54,681
The favored Chargers
race to an early 14-point lead...

416
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:57,352
in this second-round play-off game.

417
00:28:57,461 --> 00:29:00,760
Give me an "E"!
Give me an "R"!

418
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,833
But near the end of the game...

419
00:29:03,934 --> 00:29:05,902
St. Joe's begins to unravel.

420
00:29:15,612 --> 00:29:17,512
William takes control.

421
00:29:27,991 --> 00:29:30,482
Pearson responds.

422
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:40,529
his three-point shot gives the Roadrunners
their first lead of the game.

423
00:29:45,008 --> 00:29:49,445
For the Chargers, their whole season
may come down to this possession.

424
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:55,174
Down by one,
with just over a minute remaining.

425
00:29:55,285 --> 00:30:00,621
A loss tonight would be their earliest
exit from the play-offs in six years.

426
00:30:00,724 --> 00:30:03,318
And for William,
there is no next year...

427
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,759
no more chances to get downstate.

428
00:31:17,968 --> 00:31:20,630
It ain't but one thing: bad coaching.

429
00:31:20,737 --> 00:31:22,637
Bad coaching.

430
00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:28,076
Well, we got him here
about five minutes late.

431
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:32,706
So what? This -This ain't no time
to be teaching nobody no lesson.

432
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,760
All right, boy.

433
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,898
It's all right, bro.

434
00:31:50,767 --> 00:31:53,964
- You all right? You're crying, man.
- Shut up.

435
00:31:54,071 --> 00:31:56,335
Yeah.

436
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,965
- It hurt, don't it?
- Yeah. More than ever, man.

437
00:31:59,076 --> 00:32:02,116
- I didn't never want
to go out this way, man.

438
00:32:02,117 --> 00:32:03,604
- Your last year, man.

439
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:06,683
I'm trying to get it, man.
I'm striving for the same thing.

440
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,347
hey, man. We'll call you.
Give me a ring. All right?

441
00:32:12,456 --> 00:32:15,653
- All right.
- You played a good game, boy. All right.

442
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,694
You're gonna be all right.

443
00:32:18,795 --> 00:32:21,355
- I love you, boy.
- I love you too, man.

444
00:32:21,465 --> 00:32:23,433
All right.

445
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:31,366
William was 20 minutes late.

446
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:33,841
The team was dressed and already talking.

447
00:32:33,944 --> 00:32:36,606
Then he came strolling in.

448
00:32:36,713 --> 00:32:39,147
Maybe he has to learn something from that.

449
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,911
Even in a big game.

450
00:32:44,955 --> 00:32:46,855
The game was a mirror-

451
00:32:46,957 --> 00:32:49,858
It was a mirror
of all of the games all year.

452
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,057
To quote Isiah, the toughest loss
he ever took was the-

453
00:32:55,165 --> 00:32:57,525
My toughest. And that
was the De La Salle game

454
00:32:57,526 --> 00:32:59,534
in 1979 when we got beat at the buzzer.

455
00:32:59,636 --> 00:33:03,629
On a 30-footer. And we were favored
to win the state that year.

456
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:08,609
Um, now we look back on it
as just one of those great moments in -

457
00:33:08,712 --> 00:33:11,272
in our high school scene.

458
00:33:11,381 --> 00:33:13,849
Our toughest loss to take,
and we talk about it.

459
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,942
So that's what I look at, you know,
with these things now.

460
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:21,652
- Arthur, we could have used you tonight.
- Yeah.

461
00:33:21,758 --> 00:33:24,124
Good luck.
I'm gonna be watchin'. Don't forget.

462
00:33:24,227 --> 00:33:26,127
Stay in touch.

463
00:33:26,229 --> 00:33:28,129
- 'Cause we've talked about -You know.
- Yeah.

464
00:33:28,231 --> 00:33:29,664
- School.
- Yeah.

465
00:33:29,766 --> 00:33:31,961
All right. I'm watching you score.
how's your grades?

466
00:33:32,069 --> 00:33:33,969
- They're all right.
- Good.

467
00:33:34,071 --> 00:33:35,971
- They're all right.
- We missed you.

468
00:33:36,073 --> 00:33:40,476
- I missed y'all too.
- Well, I'm proud of what you've done.

469
00:33:40,577 --> 00:33:42,943
Mr. Bedford said
a lot of good things about you.

470
00:33:43,046 --> 00:33:45,446
- You be in touch. Okay?
- Okay. All right.

471
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:47,449
- Good luck.
- All right. You too.

472
00:34:11,441 --> 00:34:15,207
Marshall's second-round opponent,
Manley, presents little challenge.

473
00:34:15,312 --> 00:34:18,645
This just explains a little bit
about our program...

474
00:34:18,749 --> 00:34:20,944
where our program's headed.

475
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:23,679
I like what you're sayin;
and I want him close to home.

476
00:34:23,787 --> 00:34:25,880
- Yeah.
- You know. And, uh -

477
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:28,321
I think, you know -
I'm kind of leaning your way...

478
00:34:28,425 --> 00:34:31,248
because I just thank God
that he's getting into it -

479
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:32,953
you know, somebody do want him.

480
00:34:35,465 --> 00:34:37,933
I'm Tommy Travis,
Northeastern Illinois assistant coach.

481
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,934
- Okay. Nice to meet you.
- I'm Arthur's father.

482
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,300
- Arthur hester.
- Okay. Arthur hester.

483
00:34:42,406 --> 00:34:43,930
Us Arts gotta stick together.

484
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,439
- I'm over at Kennedy-King.
- Kennedy-King?

485
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,442
- Yeah.
- Okay.

486
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,637
May the best man win.

487
00:34:49,746 --> 00:34:53,375
- I thought mom was a cheerleader.
- Oh, thanks.

488
00:34:54,618 --> 00:34:56,586
Thank you for the compliment.

489
00:34:56,686 --> 00:35:00,486
his parents seem to think
he may, uh, pass the A.C.T.

490
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,888
- he may what?
- he may pass it.

491
00:35:02,993 --> 00:35:05,461
Oh, yeah.
Well, I hope he does.

492
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:08,087
- Us Arts gotta stick together, guy.
- Yeah.

493
00:35:09,766 --> 00:35:11,563
- Okay.
- hey.

494
00:35:11,668 --> 00:35:14,831
Would you get excited if a college coach
came up and talked to you?

495
00:35:15,872 --> 00:35:17,840
Not really.

496
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:20,775
Really, it's just-
You'rejust going...

497
00:35:20,877 --> 00:35:23,573
to another level
ofbasketball. That's all.

498
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,773
I'll be excited when I get there.

499
00:35:25,882 --> 00:35:28,578
That's when you'll be
excited the whole year.

500
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:32,553
I'll be excited as soon as I step up
in there - first day of practice.

501
00:35:34,024 --> 00:35:37,050
If I graduate, I think I'll be
the only one in my family...

502
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,993
besides my uncle,
to finish college.

503
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,291
Me too.

504
00:35:44,901 --> 00:35:47,426
In the fourth round
against heavily favored Taft...

505
00:35:47,537 --> 00:35:50,506
Marshall meets their first
true test of the play-offs.

506
00:35:54,678 --> 00:35:57,408
But the Commandos have been
bucking the odds all year.

507
00:36:07,524 --> 00:36:10,652
Arthur plays one ofhis best games
of the season...

508
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,660
scoring 19 points...

509
00:36:12,762 --> 00:36:16,220
and the Commandos claim a spot
in the city semifinals.

510
00:36:26,843 --> 00:36:31,871
The final four! I told y'all
he was going all the way. All the way!

511
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,678
Do you guys feel you can play with
any team in the city?

512
00:36:34,784 --> 00:36:37,480
On any given day, we can play with anybody.
We can beat anybody.

513
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,690
Marshall now faces
the ultimate test::

514
00:36:51,801 --> 00:36:55,202
King high School,
the rulers of the public league.

515
00:36:57,307 --> 00:36:59,402
Winners oflast year's state crown,

516
00:36:59,403 --> 00:37:02,176
they were labeled the
best team in the country.

517
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:05,942
King has sparked controversy
by out-recruiting rivals...

518
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:09,212
for the biggest and best
grammar school players.

519
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:13,756
We don't understand what
we're really doing to these young kids.

520
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,757
Kid not even 12 years old...

521
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,089
and you're baiting him
to come to your school...

522
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,094
you know, to play basketball.

523
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,289
Falls back in the paint.

524
00:37:22,399 --> 00:37:25,095
I'm not going to start
recruiting in that manner.

525
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,500
No, I'll probably get out
of the game before then.

526
00:37:30,807 --> 00:37:33,207
The winner of these two semifinal games...

527
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:37,269
will play for the Chicago Public
high School Basketball Championship.

528
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:48,423
King's strategy is to
go inside to its two seven-foot starters.

529
00:37:52,862 --> 00:37:56,298
Only Arthur seems
unintimidated by theJaguars.

530
00:38:02,472 --> 00:38:05,236
And King's poor play
keeps the game close.

531
00:38:06,276 --> 00:38:08,870
We are the... best.!
We are the team!

532
00:38:08,979 --> 00:38:11,106
I think they gonna take it.

533
00:38:12,148 --> 00:38:15,606
But in the second half,
King makes their move.

534
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,583
- What are you doin'?
- Come on. Get in the game.!

535
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:24,125
King grabs a four-point lead.

536
00:38:24,227 --> 00:38:26,627
hey, Mookie, Mookie, Mookie!

537
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,062
Y'all playing
with no confidence whatsoever.

538
00:38:29,165 --> 00:38:31,099
None!

539
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:33,499
None.!

540
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,504
- All right! Go get in charge of that ball!
- Don't foul him! Don't
foul him!

541
00:38:41,344 --> 00:38:42,811
Let's go! Let's go!

542
00:38:42,912 --> 00:38:45,847
The Commandos get aggressive on defense...

543
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:48,144
Too soon now!

544
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:51,311
and use their superior speed on offense.

545
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:06,227
Players, sit down.
We got three minutes to go. Sit down.

546
00:39:06,336 --> 00:39:09,430
Marshall grabs a six-point lead
late in the game.

547
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:11,530
We got a long time to play.

548
00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:16,037
Coach Bedford wants to force King
out of their zone defense...

549
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:20,480
and make their big, slow players match up
man-to-man against Marshall's quick guards.

550
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:22,983
One, two, three. Defense!

551
00:39:26,856 --> 00:39:30,189
Arthur simply holds the ball
as the clock ticks away.

552
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,294
The King coach has no choice.

553
00:39:58,421 --> 00:40:02,084
For the defending national champions,
it's all over.

554
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:11,129
And unranked Marshall
will play for the city title.

555
00:40:28,752 --> 00:40:32,950
Whoo! 26-2 now!

556
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:37,158
They're 26 and 2 now.

557
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,785
That's my Man!

558
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,128
All right, Man!

559
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,133
- I told you we could do it.
- Yes!

560
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:47,965
- I told you we could do it.
- I told you you were gonna do it.

561
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,971
I knew y'all was going all the way.
I told ya.

562
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,973
I said, "You're going all the way. "

563
00:40:53,009 --> 00:40:56,376
This is your last year.
You're going all the way. Yeah.

564
00:40:58,448 --> 00:41:01,542
They got the best shot ofhim,you know.

565
00:41:01,651 --> 00:41:05,052
And it's great.
That was a great shot, wasn't it?

566
00:41:05,155 --> 00:41:09,683
But this one in the, uh, Tribune
is what I really like.

567
00:41:09,793 --> 00:41:13,593
It says,
"Arthur Agee stood as still as a statue.

568
00:41:13,696 --> 00:41:17,063
Time after time was on his side. "

569
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:20,500
You know, the championship
that I missed when I was in high school-

570
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,503
Yeah.

571
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:26,234
Twenty-one years later I got a chance
at getting a championship through him.

572
00:41:26,342 --> 00:41:28,867
You know, you're always trying to
build your children up...

573
00:41:28,978 --> 00:41:30,878
and saying, "Well, you-all can do it"...

574
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,778
but, you know, really lying on
the inside a little bit, saying...

575
00:41:33,883 --> 00:41:35,783
"Well, you know, you got a long haul. "

576
00:41:35,885 --> 00:41:37,944
But, you know,
this make you even more confidence...

577
00:41:38,054 --> 00:41:40,989
because if he's sure of hisself,
then you know you can bank on it.

578
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:45,584
Yesterday, you know, when he won the game,
you know, he told me he loved me.

579
00:41:45,695 --> 00:41:48,357
And, you know, I haven't heard that
in, uh -You know.

580
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:52,901
You can feel it, but I haven't heard it
coming verbally from him.

581
00:42:03,513 --> 00:42:06,971
In a rematch with rival Westinghouse...

582
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:11,144
Marshall proves to everybody
they have what it takes to be city champs.

583
00:42:11,254 --> 00:42:14,087
Inside pass. Shot rejected.

584
00:42:18,428 --> 00:42:21,295
To the lane with the layin.

585
00:42:21,397 --> 00:42:24,161
Busts this game wide open.

586
00:42:24,267 --> 00:42:28,636
Did you see that?
Did you see it? Did you see it?

587
00:42:30,106 --> 00:42:33,166
They are celebrating because they know...

588
00:42:33,276 --> 00:42:36,302
their high school is headed
to the elite eight in Champaign.

589
00:42:39,983 --> 00:42:43,783
And the Marshall Commandos
have won the Public League Championship...

590
00:42:43,887 --> 00:42:46,014
in convincing fashion-

591
00:42:46,122 --> 00:42:51,116
58-38 winners over
the Westinghouse Warriors.

592
00:43:05,108 --> 00:43:08,043
What's up, man?
Told you on the phone what I was gonna do.

593
00:43:08,144 --> 00:43:10,112
Told you, boy.

594
00:43:13,283 --> 00:43:16,081
Marshall, baby. Marshall!

595
00:43:16,185 --> 00:43:18,085
Marshall!

596
00:43:18,187 --> 00:43:21,987
Marshall.! Marshall.!

597
00:43:22,091 --> 00:43:25,925
Marshall.! Marshall.!

598
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:37,062
Your A.C.T. came in, William,
and you received a 14 for a composite...

599
00:43:37,173 --> 00:43:39,368
which is not high enough.

600
00:43:39,475 --> 00:43:42,205
Uh,you've taken the test-
Now, this was for the fourth time.

601
00:43:42,312 --> 00:43:45,804
Now, if you add all those up,
it comes out to 17.2.

602
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:48,679
In order to play at Marquette,
you're gonna have to get the 18.

603
00:43:48,785 --> 00:43:50,685
And they're very, very concerned.

604
00:43:50,787 --> 00:43:54,723
One assistant called twice this week,
and Bo Ellis called today.

605
00:43:56,859 --> 00:43:59,487
Smile, William.
It's not the end of the world.

606
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,529
- Right?
- I hope not.

607
00:44:01,631 --> 00:44:04,862
Well,you gotta work at this
as hard as you worked at yourjump shot.

608
00:44:04,968 --> 00:44:07,459
And it was missing a lot this year.

609
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:09,538
Okay.

610
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:13,166
Now you are down to the final inning
and the last strike.

611
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,550
We're going, going downstate!
We're going downstate!

612
00:44:22,652 --> 00:44:25,815
Now let's, let's celebrate!
Now let's celebrate!

613
00:44:25,922 --> 00:44:28,686
- What are we gonna be?
- State champions.!

614
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,658
Your Marshall Commandos.!

615
00:44:36,065 --> 00:44:38,158
- Yeah!
- We're gonna take state!

616
00:44:38,267 --> 00:44:40,428
Take state! Number one!

617
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:09,162
Beat B-A - B-A-T-A-V-I-A.!

618
00:45:09,265 --> 00:45:12,257
Beat B-A - B-A-T-A-V-I-A.!

619
00:45:12,368 --> 00:45:16,464
Beat B-A - B-A-T-A-V-I-A!

620
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:29,542
Downstate Marshall plays
its familiar role as underdog...

621
00:45:29,652 --> 00:45:31,552
to third-ranked Batavia.

622
00:45:31,654 --> 00:45:33,554
Justice has it. Justice, one-on-two.

623
00:45:33,656 --> 00:45:36,250
- Spins up-
- Nice move.

624
00:45:40,163 --> 00:45:44,224
In the media glare of a statewide
audience, Marshall shows big-gamejitters.

625
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:46,267
Now bust out.

626
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:49,202
And Marshall missed the layup.

627
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,140
Sealed off,blocked by Williams.

628
00:45:53,242 --> 00:45:57,144
You got easy shots.
You gotta make your easy shots.

629
00:45:57,246 --> 00:45:59,214
I can't shoot for you.

630
00:45:59,315 --> 00:46:04,014
Now he's gonna penetrate.
Left it for Christian. Missed the shot.

631
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:09,023
Luther Bedford looks like
he's ready to commit suicide over there.

632
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:11,719
Y'all better get on your job,
Commandos!

633
00:46:11,828 --> 00:46:13,955
- Now into the corner.
- Get in there.

634
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:17,430
Batavia's got these guys on the run.

635
00:46:19,535 --> 00:46:21,435
One, one, one, one!

636
00:46:21,537 --> 00:46:24,005
One, one, one, one.!

637
00:46:25,475 --> 00:46:28,535
But in the third quarter,
the Commandos charge back.

638
00:46:28,644 --> 00:46:30,544
And a steal by Marshall.!

639
00:46:30,646 --> 00:46:33,342
Agee gonna take it all the way.

640
00:46:33,449 --> 00:46:37,613
Yes! That's the way you go!

641
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,881
- here we go.
- Picked him clean.

642
00:46:39,989 --> 00:46:41,923
Dale. Marshall leads.

643
00:46:42,024 --> 00:46:45,118
Marshall's first lead
since the first quarter.

644
00:46:45,228 --> 00:46:48,220
Like a lightning bolt,
the Commandos have struck.

645
00:46:48,331 --> 00:46:51,858
37-36, Marshall leading Batavia.

646
00:46:51,968 --> 00:46:54,698
Chicago Marshall has exploded-

647
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:01,376
I always dreamed of,like...

648
00:47:01,477 --> 00:47:04,275
me and William taking
them downstate together.

649
00:47:05,381 --> 00:47:07,281
When I was at St. Joseph...

650
00:47:07,383 --> 00:47:09,977
maybe we could have went downstate,
and maybe we couldn't.

651
00:47:10,086 --> 00:47:13,021
But we did when I'm at Marshall.

652
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:29,230
Arthur's big fourth quarter
helps add Batavia...

653
00:47:29,338 --> 00:47:31,272
to Marshall's growing list of upsets.

654
00:47:31,374 --> 00:47:34,969
Spectacular comeback
in the fourth quarter by the Commandos-

655
00:47:35,077 --> 00:47:36,977
In the postgame news conference...

656
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:40,276
Coach Bedford labels
his unranked team "the giant killers. '"

657
00:47:44,287 --> 00:47:47,017
- Y'all are playing the number one team.
- We're playing the number
one team.

658
00:47:47,123 --> 00:47:49,023
We're playing the number two team.

659
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:52,993
This is the first time in the history
of the school that we've gone
this far.

660
00:47:53,095 --> 00:47:55,723
- Really?
- In the history of the school.

661
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,197
Just like the Commandos.
See, we been the underdog.

662
00:47:58,301 --> 00:48:01,702
I'm glad we are because then
it just show you how you could come up.

663
00:48:01,804 --> 00:48:04,329
And then you beat your opponent.

664
00:48:06,542 --> 00:48:08,772
Oh,yeah.

665
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:25,684
Be a good place for Man to come.

666
00:48:25,795 --> 00:48:28,958
Yeah. This is really, you know,
something that a -

667
00:48:29,065 --> 00:48:31,659
a child would really miss out on.

668
00:48:31,767 --> 00:48:34,327
Like a whole different world.

669
00:48:34,437 --> 00:48:36,428
It's beyond different.

670
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:39,167
Uh-huh.

671
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:51,050
In this semifinal game,
we'll see some great individuals...

672
00:48:51,153 --> 00:48:53,178
just as we saw many years ago.

673
00:48:53,289 --> 00:48:56,258
Remember Isiah Thomas,
one of the great guards.

674
00:48:56,359 --> 00:48:59,760
here you see the same moves
he plays with in the NBA today.

675
00:48:59,862 --> 00:49:03,855
Well, we've got someone like that:
howard Nathan, number 34...

676
00:49:03,966 --> 00:49:05,900
for Peoria Manual.

677
00:49:06,002 --> 00:49:08,095
Marshall got here because of
one reason: quickness.

678
00:49:08,204 --> 00:49:12,334
The reason: Arthur Agee.
Look at this man. he just explodes, Dan.

679
00:49:12,441 --> 00:49:16,138
he can get downcourt
as quick as anyone I've ever seen.

680
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:18,145
In the semifinals...

681
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:21,614
Arthur goes head-to-head
with howard Nathan, the all-American.

682
00:49:21,717 --> 00:49:24,743
Make him work for it, Man.
Make him work for what he get.

683
00:49:25,788 --> 00:49:28,916
All right! Let's go!
All the way, Man! All the way!

684
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:33,251
Yeah! That's it! That's it! That's it!

685
00:49:33,362 --> 00:49:37,992
Arthur Agee, spinning inside,
tough shot. Good.

686
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,295
Arthur has a great first half...

687
00:49:40,403 --> 00:49:42,633
but the Rams play even better.

688
00:49:44,307 --> 00:49:46,707
he's got it.

689
00:49:47,743 --> 00:49:50,439
Get up for the Rams!
Everybody get up!

690
00:49:50,546 --> 00:49:52,810
Get up for the Rams.!

691
00:49:52,915 --> 00:49:56,442
In the second half,
Arthur tries to pick up where he left off.

692
00:49:56,552 --> 00:49:58,316
Penetration move by Agee. Slapped

693
00:49:58,317 --> 00:50:00,716
out of there by Manual.
They've got two-on-one.

694
00:50:00,823 --> 00:50:03,758
Ooh, and a nice fake and a score.

695
00:50:03,859 --> 00:50:06,692
But it's the Rams who don't miss a beat...

696
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:08,730
pressing the tempo against
the tired Commandos.

697
00:50:08,831 --> 00:50:11,493
You're not in the offense at all.

698
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,228
You're just out there
playing individual basketball.

699
00:50:14,337 --> 00:50:16,237
Completely.

700
00:50:16,339 --> 00:50:20,366
hey, hey, guys. No fouls.
We want to keep the clock going. Remember?

701
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:22,501
Let's go, Marshall!
Let's go!

702
00:50:22,611 --> 00:50:25,341
Let's go, Marshall.!
Let's go.!

703
00:50:25,448 --> 00:50:28,542
Marshall showed us last night
they have the ability to come back.

704
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:30,642
Let's see what they can do here.

705
00:50:45,301 --> 00:50:47,394
This is Nathan.

706
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,403
Nice pass.
Knock it down.

707
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:53,305
Biggest lead of the game now,
and the Rams fans can smell it.

708
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:57,677
Been a great run
for Luther Bedford's team.

709
00:50:58,714 --> 00:51:01,080
The string of upsets stops here.

710
00:51:02,718 --> 00:51:05,710
- And a foul on Agee.
- he fouls out.

711
00:51:05,821 --> 00:51:08,984
But hejust never quit.
hejust kept going for the basketball.

712
00:51:13,929 --> 00:51:18,389
I wouldn't be surprised
ifhe made the all-tournament team tonight.

713
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:41,246
- Number one!
- We're number one.!

714
00:51:41,357 --> 00:51:43,291
We're still number one.

715
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:45,292
All right. All right.

716
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:47,385
Though they lose to Peoria Manual...

717
00:51:47,496 --> 00:51:52,627
they finish third in the state, the highest
a Marshall team has finished since 1960.

718
00:51:55,204 --> 00:51:58,662
This was a great season you had.

719
00:51:58,774 --> 00:52:03,871
There is nothing sweeter
than going downstate as a young person.

720
00:52:03,979 --> 00:52:06,345
I mean, the record's
gonna stay there, you know.

721
00:52:06,449 --> 00:52:09,816
1991, there was a team
from Marshall played.

722
00:52:09,919 --> 00:52:12,149
- You know, and you're part of that.
- Yeah.

723
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:14,381
- That's part of history.
- Ah!

724
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:17,653
But for you seniors,you know-

725
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,823
Best wishes to all you seniors,
and whatever you try to do, uh...

726
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:25,423
Mr. Williams and I
will be around school...

727
00:52:25,534 --> 00:52:27,434
as we always are -

728
00:52:27,536 --> 00:52:30,266
to help you if you want to be helped, okay?

729
00:52:32,508 --> 00:52:36,239
Winning five games in six days,
that really takes a lot out of you.

730
00:52:36,345 --> 00:52:39,337
Like Coach said,you just gotta sacrifice-

731
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:41,439
you know, sacrifice everything you have.

732
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:43,279
Like, if you love the
game of basketball,

733
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,213
you just go out there
and give all your heart.

734
00:52:45,321 --> 00:52:48,381
he got a little ways to go,
but he's - he's gonna get there.

735
00:52:48,491 --> 00:52:51,016
hopefully he's got his head
screwed on pretty good, you know...

736
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:55,290
and now, you know,
he's gonna be on his own to do whatever.

737
00:52:55,397 --> 00:52:57,297
hopefully he'll do it right.

738
00:52:57,399 --> 00:53:01,028
When we got down here, people don't expect -
"Marshall? how'd they get down here?"

739
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,129
They lookin' like: "Who
they got on their team?"

740
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:04,594
I had to come out and prove myself.

741
00:53:04,707 --> 00:53:08,438
I think I could play Division I basketball.

742
00:53:08,544 --> 00:53:12,503
'Cause all I need is just a scholarship.
That's -That's all I'm looking for.

743
00:53:12,615 --> 00:53:14,583
Arthur Agee.

744
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:21,790
All right!

745
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:45,476
All this area through here
is our new computer labs.

746
00:53:45,581 --> 00:53:47,515
We'll take you through
all those rooms.

747
00:53:47,616 --> 00:53:49,641
Arthur's first recruiting visit...

748
00:53:49,752 --> 00:53:51,913
takes him to a junior college
in Southern Missouri.

749
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:54,169
The strength that I see here

750
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:57,425
is the tremendous
teaching that goes on here.

751
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,790
have you decided
what you want to go into?

752
00:53:59,895 --> 00:54:02,090
Uh, communications.

753
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:06,156
Are you more interested
in the overall communications -

754
00:54:06,268 --> 00:54:08,828
That, and, uh -
I like that and accounting.

755
00:54:08,938 --> 00:54:11,270
- Like business.
- Oh. Okay.

756
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:15,309
We enjoy winning things,
but the primary purpose is your education.

757
00:54:15,411 --> 00:54:17,572
What are some of your career goals,
may I ask?

758
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:22,049
I want to fall back to,
like, make - have my own business.

759
00:54:22,151 --> 00:54:24,119
Like real estate.

760
00:54:26,922 --> 00:54:29,220
This is where it all happens.

761
00:54:29,325 --> 00:54:32,419
Beautiful place.
And it gets to rockin;

762
00:54:32,528 --> 00:54:35,429
- You gonna try it on there?
- Yeah.

763
00:54:35,531 --> 00:54:38,125
Those are about $ 120 apiece.

764
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:43,796
You need to be very careful
with this decision.

765
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:46,067
You know, if you come in and act right,
you're going out ofhere...

766
00:54:46,175 --> 00:54:48,075
with two years
of your college finished...

767
00:54:48,177 --> 00:54:51,840
a scholarship to a Division I university.

768
00:54:51,947 --> 00:54:56,247
Exactly where you'd want to be-
on track to graduate in four years.

769
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:24,769
Mineral Area doesn't have dorms...

770
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,906
but it does have a basketball house.

771
00:55:28,017 --> 00:55:31,612
All the ballplayers
on scholarship live here.

772
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,154
Get your ass up, nigga.

773
00:55:38,227 --> 00:55:40,695
Of the seven blacks
in the entire school...

774
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,764
six live in this house.

775
00:55:47,236 --> 00:55:51,605
You come in and look at this little house,
then after a while you get used to it.

776
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:54,541
Try to make a little home, you know.

777
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:56,577
home away from home anyway.

778
00:55:59,782 --> 00:56:02,182
We hang around each other most of the time.

779
00:56:02,284 --> 00:56:04,514
We know who to trust,
who not to trust.

780
00:56:06,855 --> 00:56:10,086
I just want to go somewhere
where I'm gonna play.

781
00:56:10,192 --> 00:56:12,160
I can get the grades.

782
00:56:15,464 --> 00:56:17,432
I love basketball.

783
00:56:27,743 --> 00:56:29,937
how many of your
players that leave there

784
00:56:29,938 --> 00:56:32,180
and they end up going
to a four-year college?

785
00:56:32,281 --> 00:56:34,181
- Thirty-one sophomores in a row.
- Really?

786
00:56:34,283 --> 00:56:36,183
Every last one of'em he coached.

787
00:56:36,285 --> 00:56:38,947
- hi. how you doing?
- hey. how you doing?

788
00:56:39,054 --> 00:56:42,046
- Arthur Sr.
- Bo and Sheila have been separated.

789
00:56:42,157 --> 00:56:46,526
She asked him to return today
over Arthur's objections.

790
00:56:46,628 --> 00:56:48,892
I'll show you exactly
what the scholarship entails.

791
00:56:48,997 --> 00:56:51,761
Is this a full scholarship
for the two years?

792
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:56,270
The reason I'm skeptical is because of
the promises that was made in the past.

793
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:57,995
From the time he comes down there

794
00:56:57,996 --> 00:57:00,432
until he leaves, you will
not have a financial need.

795
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:03,306
Now, when you make this decision...

796
00:57:03,412 --> 00:57:05,312
you got to live and die with it.

797
00:57:05,414 --> 00:57:07,314
'Cause it's your decision to make.

798
00:57:07,416 --> 00:57:11,477
Now, I'm here to support you if you -
if you done searched this whole thing.

799
00:57:11,587 --> 00:57:13,487
And it's what you really want.

800
00:57:13,589 --> 00:57:16,353
Not,you know,
'cause Mama said this or your dad-

801
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:19,484
Or because you're saving
Mama money, because if we have to...

802
00:57:19,595 --> 00:57:21,859
we will still pay-
if you have to try to pay-

803
00:57:21,964 --> 00:57:23,989
if we can put some-
I'm just sayin;

804
00:57:24,099 --> 00:57:27,694
You - Understand what you're saying.
You want to save somebody money, but still -

805
00:57:27,803 --> 00:57:29,896
But you have to still do
what is best from here.

806
00:57:30,005 --> 00:57:33,441
But still we want the best for you -
even if you have to -

807
00:57:33,542 --> 00:57:35,806
or we have to go in the hole, you know.

808
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:37,936
You understand what I'm
saying? I'm just saying.

809
00:57:37,937 --> 00:57:39,506
But still, the decision is up to you.

810
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:45,345
So, what do you think?

811
00:57:45,454 --> 00:57:47,422
Ah.

812
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:51,650
- Ready to sign it?
- Yeah.

813
00:57:52,728 --> 00:57:55,720
- Yep.
- Let's do it up.

814
00:58:01,236 --> 00:58:03,363
- What time is it?
- 1:56.

815
00:58:03,472 --> 00:58:05,440
56.

816
00:58:18,086 --> 00:58:19,815
Come on, Bo.
Whip it to him.

817
00:58:19,922 --> 00:58:22,322
When I was 23, how old was he?

818
00:58:22,424 --> 00:58:24,324
And I whupped him then.

819
00:58:26,328 --> 00:58:27,989
Aw!

820
00:58:28,096 --> 00:58:30,064
You want to see it rain?

821
00:58:30,165 --> 00:58:33,066
Let it rain.!

822
00:58:33,168 --> 00:58:35,602
- You want to see it rain?
- One more time.

823
00:58:35,704 --> 00:58:37,899
Let it rain!

824
00:58:38,006 --> 00:58:40,167
You want to see it rain?

825
00:58:40,275 --> 00:58:42,573
Let it rain!

826
00:58:42,678 --> 00:58:44,646
Oh!

827
00:58:46,448 --> 00:58:49,076
Peoria Manual.
Remember what they did to you now.

828
00:58:49,184 --> 00:58:51,277
Yeah. Do you know howard Nathan?

829
00:58:51,386 --> 00:58:54,014
And I strung him up,
just like that.

830
00:58:56,859 --> 00:59:00,920
Uh-oh. Like father, like son.
What's up with that?

831
00:59:01,029 --> 00:59:03,759
You better stick to church music,
leave that basketball alone.

832
00:59:09,238 --> 00:59:12,730
hell, no. You can't do that.

833
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:14,968
Foul! Foul!

834
00:59:16,812 --> 00:59:18,712
Foul. Foul, foul, foul.

835
00:59:18,814 --> 00:59:20,714
- That's 32.
- That's 34.

836
00:59:20,816 --> 00:59:22,716
- 34!
- That didn't count 'cause he called "Bo. "

837
00:59:22,818 --> 00:59:25,252
- That's 34!
- That's 32!

838
00:59:25,354 --> 00:59:27,254
- he didn't hit nothing else.!
- I did!

839
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:29,881
- he didn't hit nothing else!
- It's 34-28, Bo.

840
00:59:29,992 --> 00:59:31,892
- Bo's a sore loser.
- All right!

841
00:59:31,994 --> 00:59:35,327
- No. I know how to count though.
- Ain't no con game. I'm older now.

842
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:37,523
- Yeah.
- Ain't no con game going on no more.

843
00:59:37,633 --> 00:59:40,761
- No more. Ain't no more.
- The score is 32 to 28.

844
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:43,429
Now, you can play for 32 if you want to.

845
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,904
Game over with.
I can con too.

846
00:59:46,008 --> 00:59:48,306
Losers quit. I'm ready to play.

847
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:50,241
Now,youse a coward if you don't-
Check ball.

848
00:59:50,345 --> 00:59:52,472
- You're mad now.
- Check ball.

849
00:59:52,581 --> 00:59:53,449
- Throw it over there.

850
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:55,778
- You ain't two years old.
You ain't gettin' no pacifier.

851
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:57,784
- Give me that.
- Yeah.

852
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:00,719
Your mama ain't here
to give you this ball. Let's go.

853
01:00:00,822 --> 01:00:03,347
- Give me the rock.
- Let's make it rain. Make it rain.

854
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:07,928
Bang. Bang. Right there.

855
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:10,999
ha! Go sit down.
Go sit down.

856
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:13,431
Bo, it's raining.!

857
01:00:13,535 --> 01:00:15,503
Bo, it's raining.

858
01:00:15,604 --> 01:00:17,504
- It's raining, Bo!
- It's raining, Bo!

859
01:00:17,606 --> 01:00:20,404
You're on punishment when you get home.
You're on punishment when you get home.

860
01:00:20,509 --> 01:00:24,240
And you're on punishment
when you get home. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

861
01:00:25,681 --> 01:00:27,808
It's gonna rain on your head, Bo.

862
01:00:33,155 --> 01:00:35,282
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen...

863
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:39,019
and welcome to St. Joseph's
Annual Basketball Awards Dinner.

864
01:00:39,127 --> 01:00:41,891
We had a...

865
01:00:41,997 --> 01:00:43,988
difficult year.

866
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:45,999
Most of you are aware of that.

867
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:47,429
When I first went to St. Joe's,

868
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:49,264
I really did sleep, eat
and drink basketball.

869
01:00:49,371 --> 01:00:51,271
That was all I did.

870
01:00:51,373 --> 01:00:55,503
But it became more of a job
than a sport to play.

871
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:58,545
Things here have not changed since-

872
01:00:58,647 --> 01:01:03,584
You know, Coach Pingatore
just had these dreams in his head.

873
01:01:05,587 --> 01:01:09,614
hejust wanted me to go
the same route he took Isiah.

874
01:01:10,659 --> 01:01:13,492
The most steals.

875
01:01:13,595 --> 01:01:18,555
he played as a freshman.
Not even Isiah was a four-year starter.

876
01:01:18,667 --> 01:01:21,966
You know, basketball was just like-
he was possessed with it.

877
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:24,129
You know, it was his life.

878
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:26,833
And he wanted it to be
everybody else's life too.

879
01:01:26,942 --> 01:01:29,172
All-conference in the SCC.

880
01:01:29,277 --> 01:01:31,245
All-state in the Sun-Times.

881
01:01:31,346 --> 01:01:34,372
A McDonald All-American nomination.

882
01:01:34,483 --> 01:01:40,388
M. V.P., 1990-1991 season,
William Gates.

883
01:01:59,508 --> 01:02:01,567
When I had some real problems...

884
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,110
I couldn't go to
none of them about it.

885
01:02:06,281 --> 01:02:09,614
You know, I was having some problems
with Catherine's family and my
family...

886
01:02:09,718 --> 01:02:14,087
and I said, you know, "Coach Pingatore,
their family's been getting
on me about...

887
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:17,283
you know, I'm not doing this,
and I'm not doing that. "

888
01:02:17,392 --> 01:02:19,826
And the only thing
Coach Pingatore could say is...

889
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:22,762
"Write 'em off. "

890
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:24,353
That was all he told me.

891
01:02:24,354 --> 01:02:27,392
And I was, like, "What
kind of advice is that?"

892
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:34,575
Well, how's it feel to be finishing?

893
01:02:36,778 --> 01:02:39,212
Uh, I mean-

894
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:43,040
Now, don't say anything
you don't mean, William.

895
01:02:43,151 --> 01:02:46,120
I mean, I'm serious, Coach.
I enjoyed my four years.

896
01:02:46,221 --> 01:02:48,689
I mean, we had our run-ins, and, uh -

897
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:50,690
- Who had run-ins?
- Me and you.

898
01:02:50,792 --> 01:02:51,394
- We did?

899
01:02:51,395 --> 01:02:53,955
- Yeah. Like that time
you made me run 75 stairs.

900
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:56,030
- I never f-
- You never forgot that.

901
01:02:56,131 --> 01:02:58,031
Never.

902
01:02:58,133 --> 01:03:01,041
See,you should have been
happy and enthusiastic

903
01:03:01,042 --> 01:03:02,695
about doing your punishment.

904
01:03:02,804 --> 01:03:07,298
But someday
you're gonna learn that, uh...

905
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:09,673
everything that was done
was for your benefit.

906
01:03:09,778 --> 01:03:12,723
So that you can come
back four years from now

907
01:03:12,724 --> 01:03:14,647
and say, "Coach,you were right.

908
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:17,183
"Everything that happened
at St. Joe's helped me a lot...

909
01:03:17,285 --> 01:03:19,253
and as a result I got a degree. '"

910
01:03:19,354 --> 01:03:21,254
That's what I'm hoping for.

911
01:03:21,356 --> 01:03:23,688
I'm going into communication...

912
01:03:23,792 --> 01:03:27,853
so when you start asking for a donation,
I'll know the right way to
turn you down.

913
01:03:27,963 --> 01:03:30,898
I'm sure you'll never turn us down.

914
01:03:30,999 --> 01:03:32,899
Ah.

915
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:39,703
I never really felt
that he bought into the system.

916
01:03:39,808 --> 01:03:43,244
he was never convinced
what he was doing was the right thing to do.

917
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:47,544
But overall he had a good career-
not a great career.

918
01:03:47,649 --> 01:03:49,549
It's never good-bye.

919
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:52,552
Could've been different
if the injury didn't occur.

920
01:03:52,654 --> 01:03:54,747
But it did occur.

921
01:03:54,856 --> 01:03:57,950
- And that was the big difference.
- I'm proud of what you did.

922
01:03:58,059 --> 01:04:00,220
- Okay.
- I expect you to do a lot better.

923
01:04:00,328 --> 01:04:02,228
I don't want this to be the-

924
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:04,298
- Yeah.
- You know, the highlight of your career.

925
01:04:04,399 --> 01:04:07,095
You've got a lot of
bigger and better things to do.

926
01:04:07,202 --> 01:04:09,602
I'll see you later.
Good luck.

927
01:04:12,908 --> 01:04:14,876
Well...

928
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:19,272
another one walks out the door,
and another one comes in the door.

929
01:04:19,381 --> 01:04:21,315
That's what it's all about.

930
01:04:59,788 --> 01:05:01,756
It came through for me.

931
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:04,324
- Got the score I needed.
- All right.

932
01:05:04,426 --> 01:05:06,326
And, hey...

933
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:09,262
I'm eligible.

934
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:13,123
You know, this is one
of the greatest feelings

935
01:05:13,124 --> 01:05:14,832
in the world. That's about it.

936
01:05:14,936 --> 01:05:16,836
I mean -

937
01:05:18,707 --> 01:05:22,541
After five attempts,
William's composite score of 17.5...

938
01:05:22,644 --> 01:05:24,544
is rounded up to 18...

939
01:05:24,646 --> 01:05:28,377
and he can finally accept a scholarship
to play at Marquette.

940
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:56,435
I think my mom...

941
01:05:56,544 --> 01:06:00,310
all through high school
really, really was proud of me.

942
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:03,282
She said, "Everybody's throwing
their dreams into you...

943
01:06:03,385 --> 01:06:06,821
but you got to throw
your own dreams into yourself. '"

944
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:18,824
When I gave her the diploma
after the graduation...

945
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:23,461
she was, like,
"This is it, one of my proudest moments. '"

946
01:06:36,851 --> 01:06:38,978
My baby graduated.

947
01:06:43,391 --> 01:06:46,360
Curtis always wanted to go to Marquette...

948
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:49,362
and his grades weren't
good enough for him to go...

949
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:53,457
and now it's like
he got the grades,you know?

950
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:58,800
Excuse me, Curtis.
You gonna give anybody else a chance?

951
01:06:58,907 --> 01:07:01,967
What two countries
are we competing with for world trade?

952
01:07:02,077 --> 01:07:05,513
Before Arthur can graduate,
he must pass summer school.

953
01:07:05,613 --> 01:07:08,844
And for the first time in three years,
Shannon isn't there with him.

954
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:10,918
The other country, of course, we said-

955
01:07:11,019 --> 01:07:14,819
he thought he could sell drugs
and don't get caught,you know.

956
01:07:14,923 --> 01:07:16,823
But he found out the hard way.

957
01:07:16,925 --> 01:07:18,757
And I told him, while
he was doing all that -

958
01:07:18,758 --> 01:07:20,190
I wasn't hanging with Shannon then.

959
01:07:20,295 --> 01:07:22,962
I was like, man, "Shannon,
you should stop, man.

960
01:07:22,963 --> 01:07:24,322
Stop doing that stuff. "

961
01:07:27,769 --> 01:07:31,671
We always said we weren't
gonna never do no stufflike that.

962
01:07:31,773 --> 01:07:35,675
We werejust gonna go on
and graduate and go on to college.

963
01:07:35,777 --> 01:07:39,144
But,you know, he had to be the one.

964
01:07:49,591 --> 01:07:53,721
One week before his graduation,
Arthur is robbed at gunpoint.

965
01:07:54,763 --> 01:07:58,460
At first I thought he was gonna shoot me
because I didn't have no money.

966
01:07:59,501 --> 01:08:03,028
'Cause he kept asking me, "You got -
You got some money. Where your
wallet at?"

967
01:08:03,138 --> 01:08:05,419
Be like, "What you driving
a car like this for?"

968
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:07,234
I was, like, "I ain't got no wallet. "

969
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:13,006
And then,you know,
he grabbed me and stuff,and I was-

970
01:08:13,114 --> 01:08:17,483
and I was about to panic and stuff,
and I just calmed down.

971
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:24,491
I sit down
and had a long talk with him and his sister.

972
01:08:24,592 --> 01:08:28,050
Someone pulled a pistol on her
right down the street from the house.

973
01:08:29,164 --> 01:08:32,146
I said, "Do you all
understand what is going on

974
01:08:32,147 --> 01:08:34,192
out here in these streets today?'"

975
01:08:34,302 --> 01:08:38,739
Even with me, when I was out there -
you know, out there strung out
-

976
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:42,571
you know, I looked for somebody
that seemed like they had something.

977
01:08:44,179 --> 01:08:48,548
hmm. After this, I -

978
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:52,814
I - I'm ready.
I'm ready to leave.

979
01:08:52,921 --> 01:08:54,821
'Cause there ain't no -

980
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:58,950
Everybody up here going to jail
or- or either in drugs.

981
01:08:59,994 --> 01:09:01,962
Or dead.

982
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,968
James Davis.

983
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,205
Arthur Agee.

984
01:09:57,385 --> 01:10:01,151
Please hold your applause
so everyone can hear.

985
01:10:01,256 --> 01:10:03,224
Christine Bowman.

986
01:10:05,727 --> 01:10:07,695
Erica Byrd.

987
01:10:10,632 --> 01:10:12,793
Sandra Crockett.

988
01:10:14,569 --> 01:10:19,063
I never thought he would
get to the place where he's at now.

989
01:10:21,209 --> 01:10:26,272
Arthur's self-esteem
was really drained from St. Joseph's.

990
01:10:26,381 --> 01:10:28,941
I said, "Well,you are somebody.

991
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:31,814
"No matter where you go,
it's what you have in your heart...

992
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,650
that you're gonna go somewhere. '"

993
01:10:47,502 --> 01:10:50,062
Come on.
Move out of the way, boy.

994
01:10:54,342 --> 01:10:56,108
Everybody out there, there's gonna be

995
01:10:56,109 --> 01:10:58,403
a party tonight. There's
gonna be a party tonight.

996
01:10:58,513 --> 01:11:00,413
You know it.

997
01:11:00,515 --> 01:11:03,211
These flame-broiled burgers -

998
01:11:33,615 --> 01:11:35,515
It's scary, man. I'm telling you.

999
01:11:35,617 --> 01:11:38,085
I'm telling you the truth.
Scary generation, man.

1000
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,568
- I thought you might
hit me in my head, fool.

1001
01:11:41,569 --> 01:11:43,051
- I didn't hit you in your head.

1002
01:11:43,157 --> 01:11:45,182
To my son.

1003
01:11:45,293 --> 01:11:48,785
I hope you pursue all your dreams
and your desires...

1004
01:11:48,896 --> 01:11:50,864
that you have within you.

1005
01:11:50,965 --> 01:11:53,229
I love you very much.

1006
01:11:53,334 --> 01:11:56,997
- Ooh, that is so nice.
- Whatever.

1007
01:11:57,105 --> 01:11:59,596
Oh, no.!

1008
01:12:18,526 --> 01:12:20,790
God, we thank you
for this day, Lord.

1009
01:12:20,895 --> 01:12:23,489
And we ask you to
go with junior, Lord.

1010
01:12:23,598 --> 01:12:27,261
And we thank you, Lord. Go with him
as he try to better his education, Lord.

1011
01:12:27,368 --> 01:12:29,996
And we thank you for him
for coming this far.

1012
01:12:30,104 --> 01:12:32,095
We came this far by faith, Lord.

1013
01:12:32,206 --> 01:12:34,902
And we ask you, Father,
when he get in college, Lord...

1014
01:12:35,009 --> 01:12:37,204
to keep him, Lord-
keep him protected.

1015
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:39,211
We thank you for him,Jesus.

1016
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:42,282
- In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
- Amen.

1017
01:12:42,383 --> 01:12:46,410
Oh,you can cry like a river, girl.

1018
01:12:46,521 --> 01:12:49,046
You're crying so bad,
I won't even make fun of you.

1019
01:12:55,363 --> 01:12:57,331
Oh, God.

1020
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:18,018
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you too.

1021
01:13:19,053 --> 01:13:21,078
I want you to be good, okay?

1022
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:26,388
And don't, uh, get mixed up in
none of that old stuff that, uh, you
know.

1023
01:13:26,494 --> 01:13:29,190
I done told you what to do.

1024
01:13:29,297 --> 01:13:32,596
Don't get no alcohol, no wine coolers.

1025
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:35,294
None of that stuff.

1026
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:54,855
Bye-bye.

1027
01:13:59,227 --> 01:14:03,220
I just hope he stay in there.
That's what worries me most.

1028
01:14:04,999 --> 01:14:08,765
Once he get in the door,
I want him to stay in there for four years.

1029
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:14,034
Think he gonna make it?

1030
01:14:14,142 --> 01:14:16,110
You do?

1031
01:14:17,879 --> 01:14:20,347
I think he gonna make it.

1032
01:14:22,116 --> 01:14:24,084
Well, I hope so anyway.

1033
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:55,943
When I was young- When I was little,
that's all I used to think about- the NBA.

1034
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:00,651
If I set my mind, I can - I can go.

1035
01:15:00,755 --> 01:15:02,655
I can st - I can go.

1036
01:15:02,757 --> 01:15:05,089
Get in good college. I can go.

1037
01:15:06,194 --> 01:15:09,686
But if I don't, you know, I ain't gonna be
no drug dealer, you know...

1038
01:15:09,797 --> 01:15:12,698
cry about it,
come back and, you know...

1039
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,065
stick up gas stations
or nothing like that, you know.

1040
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:19,264
Probably go into comedian or architecture,
something like that.

1041
01:15:24,345 --> 01:15:29,112
You don't think that you'll have the kind
of tough times like your dad's been through?

1042
01:15:29,217 --> 01:15:31,913
No.

1043
01:15:32,019 --> 01:15:36,319
I can't say- I can't say that I will.
I can't say that I don't. I don't know.

1044
01:16:01,582 --> 01:16:03,375
Four years ago, that's all

1045
01:16:03,376 --> 01:16:06,281
I used to dream about
was playing in the NBA.

1046
01:16:06,387 --> 01:16:08,753
I don't really dream about it
like that anymore.

1047
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:12,520
You know, even though...

1048
01:16:12,627 --> 01:16:15,562
I love playing basketball, but, you know...

1049
01:16:15,663 --> 01:16:18,393
I want to do other things
with my life too.

1050
01:16:18,499 --> 01:16:20,558
- Say, "hi, Daddy. '"
- hi, Daddy.

1051
01:16:20,668 --> 01:16:22,966
- "how you doing?'"
- how you doing?

1052
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:24,970
- Say, "I love you. '"
- I love you.

1053
01:16:26,073 --> 01:16:30,373
If I had to stop playing basketball
right now, I think I'd still be
happy.

1054
01:16:30,478 --> 01:16:33,311
- I think I would.
- Thank you, Daddy.

1055
01:16:33,414 --> 01:16:36,144
- Where'd Daddy get to?
- Uh, Marquette.

1056
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:38,218
Marquette?

1057
01:16:40,254 --> 01:16:42,620
That's why when
somebody say,you know...

1058
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:43,850
"When you get to the NBA,

1059
01:16:43,851 --> 01:16:45,783
don't forget about me,
'"and all that stuff...

1060
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:48,199
I should say to them,
"Well, if I don't make it,

1061
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,795
watch you don't forget about me. '"
