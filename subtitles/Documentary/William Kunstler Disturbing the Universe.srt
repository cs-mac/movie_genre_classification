00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,300
You're forgetting something.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,521
You're already dead

4
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:42,600
Hello?

5
00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:46,096
Wooju, the president wants to meet for drink.

6
00:00:46,098 --> 00:00:47,840
I'm running.

7
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,500
- At this time?
- Give me the phone.

8
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,285
Wooju! What are we going to do about...?

9
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,601
Hello?

10
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,087
Why's he out this late?

11
00:01:07,100 --> 00:00:10,036
Leave him be.
And stop coddling him.

12
00:01:10,100 --> 00:00:11,711
That's why he's so weird.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,469
Lately ,all celebrities have been
in scandals left and right.

14
00:01:15,905 --> 00:01:18,807
It took us so long just to get this far.
Oh, man...

15
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,100
There's nothing we can do about it.
Let's get some fried rice.

16
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,669
- Sir!
- Yes?

17
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,844
- Two bowls of fried rice.
- Sure.

18
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,604
Is Wooju coming today?

19
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,200
Actually, he's got a lot of work to do.

20
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,044
Well... Of, course he does.

21
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,235
- Sir.
- You should call a driver.

22
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,000
I only had two glasses of soju.
Thank you for the meal.

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,101
- Okay. Be safe, yeah?
- Yes.

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,135
- I should call you a driver.
- It's okay.


25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,902
Oh no, it must be his time.

26
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,968
Let's go. It's right about time.

27
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:15,000
