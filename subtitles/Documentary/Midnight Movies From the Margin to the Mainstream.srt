1
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:32,920
Is that them?

2
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,360
Jesus Christ.
Are they going to do it right here?

3
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:47,561
Have you guys
ever been through this before?

4
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:50,640
- No.

5
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:53,041
it's best to ignore it.
Keep your head down...go back to work.

6
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:58,001
Go on.

7
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:04,282
Don't watch!

8
00:02:21,922 --> 00:02:22,321
Timothy Singh?

9
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:24,322
Yes.

10
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:28,362
I'm afraid we have to speak with you.

11
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:43,122
Eric Dale?

12
00:02:44,243 --> 00:02:47,923
- Excuse me?
- Eric Dale?

13
00:02:48,842 --> 00:02:50,203
I'm not Eric Dale.

14
00:02:50,642 --> 00:02:53,042
Oh. I'm so sorry.

15
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:56,003
He's my boss,
he's down the hall.

16
00:02:56,003 --> 00:02:58,523
- Thanks.

17
00:03:11,043 --> 00:03:13,683
- Excuse me? Mr. Dale?

18
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:15,403
This way.

19
00:03:24,603 --> 00:03:25,844
Okay.

20
00:04:03,685 --> 00:04:04,805
I'm obviously sorry ...

21
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,925
that we are here today;

22
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:09,885
but these are extra ordinary times
as you very well must know.

23
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:12,806
Look, I run risk management...

24
00:04:13,965 --> 00:04:16,125
I don't really see,
how that's a natural place to start..

25
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:18,686
cutting jobs.
- We hope you understand
that this is in no way personal.

26
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,645
The majority of this floor is being let go today.

27
00:04:24,646 --> 00:04:25,925
Ms. Bratberg is now going to

28
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:28,006
run through the details;
of what the firm is offering.

29
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:33,966
Mr. Dale the firm is offering you
six months severance,

30
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:36,486
at half your salary.

31
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:39,246
You will keep all unvested options
that you currently hold.

32
00:04:39,686 --> 00:04:42,206
Health will be extended through that period.

33
00:04:42,206 --> 00:04:44,686
You have till
tomorrow at... 4:47

34
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:46,887
to either take the offer or it will be revoked.

35
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,766
Do you understand?

36
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:52,006
- Yes.

37
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:57,447
Unfortunately Mr. Dale, due to the
highly sensitive nature of your work here;

38
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:04,847
the firm has to take certain precautions
for security purposes that may seem punitive in nature.

39
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:09,487
I hope considering your.....
over 19 years of service to the firm,

40
00:05:09,487 --> 00:05:11,967
you will understand that these measures
are in no way..

41
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:14,647
a reflection of the firm's feelings
towards your performance..

42
00:05:15,207 --> 00:05:16,527
or your character.

43
00:05:20,368 --> 00:05:21,487
- I don't understand.
- She's apologizing...

44
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,287
for what's about to happen.

45
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:27,088
Your company email,
access to the server,

46
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:29,568
access to the building,
and your mobil data and phone service

47
00:05:29,568 --> 00:05:33,007
will all be severed as of this meeting.

48
00:05:33,528 --> 00:05:38,048
And, This gentleman, will take you to your office.
So, you can clear out your personal belongings.

49
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:44,968
What about the..
what I'm currently working on?

50
00:05:45,648 --> 00:05:50,609
I'm in the middle of something...
- The firm has worked out its transition plan.
and is prepared to move forward,

51
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:52,928
But, we do we appreciate your concern.

52
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:57,248
We understand that this is very difficult;
and here is my card.

53
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:03,049
Please contact me over the next few weeks,
If you'd any assistence with this transition in your life.

54
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,771
I'm sorry.

55
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,890
Are you still alive?
- Uh huh..For now.

56
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,771
Congratulations.

57
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:07,131
It's a bloodbath.
- I heard.

58
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:10,651
Listen Eric?

59
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:13,851
If there was something I could have done,
I'd have done it.

60
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:20,331
Just tell me...

61
00:07:21,211 --> 00:07:22,051
Who was it?

62
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:27,411
Was it Rogers?
- I'm not gonna side, you know me.

63
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:28,412
Robertson?

64
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:37,292
That cunt. I knew it. I never should have
gone to her last year.

65
00:07:37,772 --> 00:07:39,332
Look it wasn't anyone. It was bad luck.
And that's all it was.

66
00:07:43,492 --> 00:07:44,692
Alright, Well...Good luck.

67
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:54,732
I was just in the middle of alot of shit here
that I think somebody need to take a look at.

68
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:55,772
Eric Listen...

69
00:07:58,252 --> 00:08:01,492
They are telling us that everybody needs
to get out of here and just leave this.

70
00:08:02,052 --> 00:08:08,412
And while we appreciate your concern,
but it's not your problem anymore.

71
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,373
Good luck.

72
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:51,814
Eric, I am very sorry.
- Yeah.

73
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:53,814
id they say what was going to happen with us?

74
00:08:55,174 --> 00:08:56,494
Jesus Seth.
- What?

75
00:08:57,054 --> 00:08:58,334
It's gonna get pretty ugly around here for a while..

76
00:08:58,334 --> 00:09:01,894
but you guys will be alright.

77
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:09,455
I'll be seeing you around.
- Alright.

78
00:09:09,854 --> 00:09:10,934
Thank you.

79
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:36,336
I just wanted to say thanks.

80
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:38,736
That's not neccessary.
- Well, it is.

81
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:42,655
You were the person around here, that I..
- I know.

82
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:50,376
I was working on something
But they wouldn't let me finish it.

83
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,295
So, take a look at it.

84
00:09:55,176 --> 00:09:56,216
Be careful.

85
00:10:28,017 --> 00:10:30,617
Robertson?

86
00:10:30,617 --> 00:10:31,617
Sarah?

87
00:10:33,657 --> 00:10:34,777
You shut off my phone?

88
00:10:35,937 --> 00:10:37,377
Eric, I didn't do anything.

89
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:39,777
Fuck you!

90
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:05,018
It's fucking hedious.

91
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:07,938
It's gonna get worse before it gets better.

92
00:11:14,818 --> 00:11:15,699
You got any Nicorettes?

93
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:19,138
I'm out of Nicorettes.

94
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:21,738
Which means, in about..

95
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,379
Ten minutes. I'm gonna kill someone.

96
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,179
You alright Sam?

97
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:32,459
My dog is dying.

98
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:38,379
I'm sorry?

99
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:40,219
Just got a phone to the vet,

100
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:42,619
it's some fucking tumor on her liver.

101
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,379
I must've paid almost a thousand bucks
a day already, just to keep her alive.

102
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,179
and I don't have a fucking clue
what to do about it.

103
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,379
Well they're all gone.

104
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,420
So?

105
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,420
How many do we have left?

106
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,780
About, Thirty-three.

107
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,820
Make sure everyone is out there,
I gotta say something.

108
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,620
Yeah, I know.
They are ready.

109
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:29,221
Alright, Let's hear it!

110
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:36,941
You are all still here for a reason...

111
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:40,981
eighty percent of this floor was just sent home...
forever.

112
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:43,781
We have spent the last hour saying our good-byes...

113
00:12:44,781 --> 00:12:46,541
they were good people and
they were good at their jobs...

114
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:48,541
but you all were better.

115
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:51,501
Now they are gone.
They are not to be thought of again.

116
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,621
This is your opportunity.

117
00:12:56,821 --> 00:13:00,501
On every floor of this building and in every office
from Hong Kong to London the same thing is happening.

118
00:13:01,461 --> 00:13:02,742
By the time we are done..

119
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:04,581
3 of every seven guys;

120
00:13:05,142 --> 00:13:09,342
who were standing
between you and your boss's job...are gone.

121
00:13:11,422 --> 00:13:12,382
That is your opportunity.

122
00:13:15,982 --> 00:13:18,862
I've been at this place for thirty-four years.

123
00:13:19,502 --> 00:13:21,502
And I can tell you that this will not be
the last time you're gonna go through this.

124
00:13:22,382 --> 00:13:23,902
But you all are survivors...

125
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:28,102
And that is how this firm over 107 years,

126
00:13:28,663 --> 00:13:29,743
has continued to grow stronger.

127
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:33,022
So, keep your heads high... and get back to work.
Let's hear it.

128
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:26,745
Everyone is going out man...
you should come on.

129
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:27,744
- Oh, I'm cool. Thanks.

130
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:32,025
Okay. Well, if you change your mind,
jut give me a call.

131
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:34,024
I Will.

132
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:35,465
Come!

133
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:39,305
Where are you guys going?
- The Grand.

134
00:14:41,265 --> 00:14:42,384
I'll call you when I'm done.

135
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,425
Hey, Be glad, you're still alive.

136
00:14:49,545 --> 00:14:50,705
I am.

137
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:17,272
Yeah, Hello.

138
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:20,551
I can't hear you.

139
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:27,031
Can you go outside, It's too loud.

140
00:18:31,392 --> 00:18:33,912
Where are you?
- Lugo.

141
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:38,192
Are you with Will?
- Yeah, Will Emerson?

142
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:39,192
Yeah, I think he's still here.

143
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:43,313
I need you to get Will
and I need you guys to come back up here.

144
00:18:43,313 --> 00:18:44,312
Uh, Where?
- To the office.

145
00:18:45,152 --> 00:18:46,073
- What?
- I'm serious.

146
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:50,112
You want me to get our boss's boss out of

147
00:18:50,112 --> 00:18:53,713
a club and bring him back to the office...
at 10:00 on a Thursday night?

148
00:18:53,753 --> 00:18:57,073
Our boss just got axed,so technically
he is our boss, and yes that's what I want you to do.

149
00:18:57,073 --> 00:18:58,073
Why?

150
00:18:59,953 --> 00:19:01,913
Look man, Just trust me okay.
I need you guys back here, now.

151
00:19:01,913 --> 00:19:02,913
Alright, we'll be there in ten.

152
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,114
Hey, look who it is,
burning the candleat both ends.

153
00:19:37,674 --> 00:19:38,794
Why didn't you come out with us?

154
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:42,074
There aren't anymore cuts planned.
You don't have to kiss my arse.

155
00:19:43,754 --> 00:19:44,954
I frankly, don't even know,
what it is you guys do.

156
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:47,635
Will, I am so sorry I had to bring you guys back..
- That's alright.

157
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:53,035
Eric gave me this file before he left.

158
00:19:54,634 --> 00:19:56,635
And he told me he couldn't quite figure it out,

159
00:19:57,754 --> 00:20:01,675
And the last thing he says as
the doors on the elevator close is 'be careful'.

160
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:04,515
He said, Be careful?
- Yeah, So..obviously..I'm little curious.

161
00:20:05,115 --> 00:20:06,715
I get into it a bit and I realize that
the only thing missing..

162
00:20:07,795 --> 00:20:10,115
This is not good, Will.

163
00:20:11,955 --> 00:20:13,355
Go to model four, it makes more sense.

164
00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:16,715
What is this?

165
00:20:18,155 --> 00:20:22,275
This is basically everything that we have in our books.
At any given time. But what Eric was trying to do

166
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:28,035
is to work this numbers for levels of volatility;
that fall outside of our standard VAR model.

167
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:29,036
What are those levels?

168
00:20:28,876 --> 00:20:29,876
Well it's a fairly complicated...
- Simplify.

169
00:20:31,316 --> 00:20:33,116
The volatility levels are set using..

170
00:20:33,635 --> 00:20:36,836
historic patterns basically, an then
stretching those patterns out on a 10-15%... roughly.

171
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:42,436
Alright, So?
- So, We are starting to test those historic patterns.

172
00:20:42,436 --> 00:20:43,436
- When?

173
00:20:43,436 --> 00:20:44,436
Today?

174
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:46,836
Monday...

175
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:50,036
Last friday and wednesday..
- Two Fridays ago.

176
00:20:50,796 --> 00:20:51,957
Alright, I get it.

177
00:20:54,357 --> 00:20:57,636
Fuck me. Once this thing gets going in the wrong direction...

178
00:20:59,757 --> 00:21:01,317
It's huge.
- How huge?

179
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,637
The losses are greater than the current
value of the company...?

180
00:21:06,036 --> 00:21:07,596
Projected...Projected losses...Will.

181
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:09,917
This is just our floor?
- Yes.

182
00:21:13,717 --> 00:21:16,197
Where the fuck is Eric Dale?
- I don't know. Tried to call him, his phone's off.

183
00:21:16,197 --> 00:21:20,197
What do you mean?
- They turned off everyone's phone who they axed today.

184
00:21:20,677 --> 00:21:23,197
Fucking ruthless.

185
00:21:25,678 --> 00:21:28,198
Call his home.
- At this hour?

186
00:21:28,198 --> 00:21:32,518
Yes... Do we even know if he's right?
- Looks pretty fucking  right to me.

187
00:21:34,477 --> 00:21:36,438
Mrs. Dale. This is Will Emerson

188
00:21:37,518 --> 00:21:39,118
I'm fine, thank you.
May I speak with Eric?

189
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:46,878
No, we've tried that. His phone appears to be off.
Listen, could you have him call me?

190
00:21:47,398 --> 00:21:49,878
The moment he comes in...
the moment he walks through the door.

191
00:21:50,758 --> 00:21:53,638
Thank you so much.
Goodbye.

192
00:21:54,238 --> 00:21:56,598
- Where the fuck is he?
- Doesn't he have like three kids?  - So?

193
00:21:57,398 --> 00:21:58,838
I don't know, would you go home?

194
00:22:00,878 --> 00:22:02,159
I know where he is.

195
00:22:03,998 --> 00:22:06,518
I need you two, to go and get him.

196
00:22:06,518 --> 00:22:09,038
There will be a car waiting for you downstairs.
You need to go.

197
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:11,519
- Right now?
- Yeah, Right now.

198
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:17,439
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna call, Sam.

199
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,279
Fuck me.

200
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:36,600
- Yes?
- It's Will.

201
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,080
It's 11 O'clock at night?

202
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,520
I know I'm sorry. I wouldn't have called...

203
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,800
I think you need to get back here.

204
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,280
It's 11 O'clock at night!

205
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,040
I'm well aware of the fucking time!
Sam, I'm telling you..You need to see this.

206
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,960
See what?

207
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,880
Email it to me.

208
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,521
I don't think that would be a good idea.

209
00:23:06,361 --> 00:23:07,441
I'm on my way.

210
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,920
Look at these people.

211
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,201
Wandering around, with absolutely no idea..
what's about to happen.

212
00:23:24,721 --> 00:23:28,801
Right?
- Well, I try not to let work get to me like that.

213
00:23:29,361 --> 00:23:32,522
I've noticed that about you.

214
00:23:33,921 --> 00:23:38,201
Look, we are twenty three years old...
- I'm 28.

215
00:23:40,881 --> 00:23:45,562
I made nearly,
a quarter of a million dollars last year...

216
00:23:47,441 --> 00:23:50,962
Fuck! for what...? Pushing some numbers
around on a computer screen,

217
00:23:51,002 --> 00:23:54,802
so a bunch of glorified crack addicts
could take that  information and pretend to understand it,

218
00:23:54,842 --> 00:23:57,642
and then make a bet against some other
jock half way around the world who if he..

219
00:23:57,642 --> 00:24:01,562
wasn't doing this, he'd be putting number seven
or you know??

220
00:24:01,642 --> 00:24:04,162
And at the end of the day one guy win
and the other guy loses.

221
00:24:06,723 --> 00:24:09,243
You do know it's a little more
complicated than that? Right?

222
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:10,642
Yeah.

223
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:19,203
It's Will... He wants to know if we've found him?
What do say?

224
00:24:19,803 --> 00:24:22,122
I would say...that
we haven't found him, Yet.

225
00:24:50,884 --> 00:24:51,883
Eric Dale...

226
00:24:54,084 --> 00:24:55,404
Oh Jesus...
- Before he leaves the building, escorted by fucking security...

227
00:24:56,164 --> 00:24:57,204
I had nothing to do with that.

228
00:24:59,284 --> 00:25:01,484
Before he leaves the building
he hands a disk to Peter Sullivan...

229
00:25:02,124 --> 00:25:04,284
Who's Peter Sullivan, again?
- Don't matter, One of Eric's guys.

230
00:25:04,844 --> 00:25:06,724
Before, the elevator doors are closing..

231
00:25:07,364 --> 00:25:08,484
The last thing he says is...

232
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:10,284
'Be Careful'

233
00:25:14,364 --> 00:25:15,764
'Be Careful'?
- Yeah.               - Why?

234
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,764
Take a look.

235
00:25:20,684 --> 00:25:23,084
Oh Jesus, You know i can't read this fucking thing!
Speak to me in English.

236
00:25:23,765 --> 00:25:28,845
Basically, this kid, Peter Sullivan..
He gets all inspired by you pep talk, Nice job! By the way..

237
00:25:29,365 --> 00:25:30,645
He dealt straight in, after work.

238
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:34,245
And I think he nailed it.
- Nailed it?

239
00:25:34,845 --> 00:25:36,565
Yeah, I think he figured out what Eric was missing.

240
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:40,365
...it isn't good, Sam.

241
00:25:41,805 --> 00:25:42,846
These here are the...

242
00:25:43,365 --> 00:25:49,405
historical volatility index limits, which of course,
our entire trading model relies on pretty fuckingheavily...

243
00:25:49,446 --> 00:25:52,886
And well, we are now so levered up.
But once it gets outside those limits

244
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:55,806
it gets ugly in a hurry.

245
00:25:56,726 --> 00:25:58,206
And how close to those limits have we gotten?

246
00:25:59,286 --> 00:26:00,405
Oh Sam, we're beyond close...

247
00:26:02,006 --> 00:26:06,246
We broke through five or six days over the last two weeks,
Now somehow, we've managed

248
00:26:06,686 --> 00:26:08,326
to stay on the upside  of it... for now...
- For now?

249
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:11,886
Well look.. what happens here
when we get on the wrong side of it.

250
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,486
What am I looking at?

251
00:26:20,527 --> 00:26:21,286
You're looking at this figure here.

252
00:26:25,606 --> 00:26:26,806
Wow...is that?
- Yeah.

253
00:26:26,847 --> 00:26:28,246
And that wouldn't even be that bad a day
for us... historically speaking.

254
00:26:29,806 --> 00:26:31,167
Is that figure right?

255
00:26:32,326 --> 00:26:34,407
Where is Eric Dale?
- We shut his phone off.

256
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:38,367
So, I called his wife.
Who says,  he's not home.

257
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:40,167
He's probably crying in a fucking beer somewhere.

258
00:26:40,727 --> 00:26:43,527
Where's the kid who did this?
- Out looking for Eric.

259
00:26:44,487 --> 00:26:48,368
Do you think he knows what he's doing?
- Get him back.

260
00:27:04,607 --> 00:27:05,808
1500?

261
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:08,088
2 grand?

262
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:41,929
Okay,
Yeah.

263
00:27:55,249 --> 00:27:57,730
Alright, so come on,
What'a you think Rogers makes in a year?

264
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,210
I have no idea?

265
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,650
Come on, play along.

266
00:28:05,209 --> 00:28:06,330
Three quarters of a million?

267
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:08,689
Come on.

268
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:11,890
Not even close.

269
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:14,690
Much more.

270
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,290
A million?

271
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,810
Will Emerson made two and half million last year.

272
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,970
How do you know that?

273
00:28:25,931 --> 00:28:27,570
He told me.  Well I asked him.

274
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,691
Do you think that's true?
- Yeah probably.

275
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:37,531
That's fucked up.
- Why, why's that fucked up?

276
00:28:38,971 --> 00:28:43,091
Does that seem right to you?
Right?

277
00:28:44,211 --> 00:28:45,051
Jesus.

278
00:28:46,451 --> 00:28:51,531
So, what do you think that means Rogers puts away?
- I have no idea, Seth. This traffic's a fucking nightmare.

279
00:29:12,612 --> 00:29:14,012
----- Subtitle by D3xt3r -----

280
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,132
Gentlemen?

281
00:29:17,772 --> 00:29:18,932
Come with us, please.

282
00:29:26,212 --> 00:29:27,692
Sam this is Seth Bregman and this is Peter Sullivan.

283
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:35,252
Where are we going?

284
00:29:36,093 --> 00:29:37,773
Going to get a second opinion on your work Peter.

285
00:30:14,054 --> 00:30:15,574
So Sam what do you have for us?

286
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:17,734
Well... they'll be here in a minute. Finding someone
in the copy room at this hour was a little bit of a challenge.

287
00:30:20,414 --> 00:30:24,534
Okay, let's go right into introduction. This is Sarah Robertson
who you know, chief risk assessment officer..

288
00:30:25,014 --> 00:30:29,774
Ramesh Shah from upstairs and David Horn
one of the firm's in house council.

289
00:30:30,574 --> 00:30:31,734
Nice to meet you all.
This is my head of trading, Will Emerson.

290
00:30:32,454 --> 00:30:37,254
Peter Sullivan, and Seth Bregman.
They work in our risk department.

291
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:38,254
Where is Eric Dale?

292
00:30:37,894 --> 00:30:39,054
He was let go today.

293
00:30:41,735 --> 00:30:43,374
Who's left in your risk department?

294
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:46,295
As of today that would be Peter

295
00:30:47,175 --> 00:30:48,255
and our junior analyst Seth...?

296
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:55,175
Will Emerson?
- Please just hand it out.

297
00:31:09,455 --> 00:31:12,215
Apparently Eric had been working on
this for some time but was unable to finish it,

298
00:31:12,696 --> 00:31:14,296
This morning, when he left the building;

299
00:31:14,656 --> 00:31:16,416
He handed the program to Peter here,
and asked him to take a look at it.

300
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:17,896
Peter did.

301
00:31:18,256 --> 00:31:19,696
He put in a few things out that
Eric seemed to be missing..

302
00:31:20,575 --> 00:31:21,616
and this is what came out.

303
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,816
Peter, Is this your work?

304
00:31:27,656 --> 00:31:29,016
Mostly Mr. Dale's...

305
00:31:29,576 --> 00:31:30,616
- But is this your draft?

306
00:31:30,616 --> 00:31:31,656
- Yes.

307
00:31:33,656 --> 00:31:37,656
Again, expanded on original
work of Eric's. But yes.

308
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:38,456
- What is your background?
- My background?

309
00:31:39,737 --> 00:31:42,936
Your CV.
-  I've been with the firm for 2 and half years
working with Eric that whole time...

310
00:31:42,977 --> 00:31:47,456
But I hold a doctorate in engineering, speciality in propulsion,
from MIT, with a Bachelors from Penn.

311
00:31:47,497 --> 00:31:48,977
What's a specialty in propulsion, exactly?

312
00:31:49,577 --> 00:31:55,937
My thesis was a study in the way that friction ratios effect
steering outcomes in aeronautical use under reduced gravity loads.

313
00:31:56,577 --> 00:31:57,737
So, you are a rocket scientist?
- I was.

314
00:32:01,537 --> 00:32:04,457
Interesting.
How did you end up here?

315
00:32:04,457 --> 00:32:08,937
Well it's all just numbers really, you're just changing
what you're adding up... and if I may speak freely;

316
00:32:08,937 --> 00:32:09,937
the money here is,
considerably more attractive.

317
00:32:19,298 --> 00:32:20,298
What time is it?

318
00:32:20,298 --> 00:32:22,698
It's 2:15.

319
00:32:25,658 --> 00:32:27,658
And I'm guessing, by the fact that
you two haven't said anything that the math checks out?

320
00:32:31,058 --> 00:32:32,418
Look, we'd need some time to go over this,

321
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,738
but Mr. Sullivan here seems to
know what he's doing.

322
00:32:35,738 --> 00:32:38,738
So, it would appear we have a problem.

323
00:32:39,538 --> 00:32:41,899
What time is it?
- 2:16.

324
00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:42,898
Fuck me.

325
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:46,099
Fuck me.

326
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:54,219
Sam..

327
00:32:54,699 --> 00:32:59,218
How long under normal operations,
would it take your people to clear that from our books?

328
00:33:02,739 --> 00:33:03,659
What?

329
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:06,339
- All of it?
- Yes.

330
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:08,379
I don't know, weeks.

331
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:10,459
- Weeks?
- Yeah, weeks.

332
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:15,579
But as you certainly know
our business is selling AND buying.

333
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:18,219
Doesn't work for very long without both components.

334
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:19,899
We suddenly stops buying for a day or two;

335
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,700
that's not something you can
ust doesn't hide under the rug, it gets out

336
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,779
and when it does...
this whole this thing comes to a end... and  right quick.

337
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,819
- I understand.
- Do you?

338
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,100
Yes.

339
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,420
How many traders do we have left between
your floor and Petersen's?

340
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,420
I don't know, what? Sixty?
- sixty.

341
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:46,461
Jared as I looke at this more closely,
it's these VAR numbers that are really setting this thing off.

342
00:34:05,021 --> 00:34:06,621
As I was saying..just speaking completely off the record.

343
00:34:06,621 --> 00:34:09,221
It's only a matter of time
before someone else startsputting these in.

344
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:10,221
and they come up with exactly the same results.

345
00:34:11,061 --> 00:34:12,301
And look at exactly
what we're looking at right now;

346
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:14,101
If they haven't already.

347
00:34:14,101 --> 00:34:15,101
Understood.

348
00:34:15,181 --> 00:34:17,701
And Sarah, what value would you allow to be
placed on those assets

349
00:34:18,862 --> 00:34:20,101
that might be left on the books,
if they had to?

350
00:34:20,981 --> 00:34:21,982
Why would they still be on the books?

351
00:34:22,621 --> 00:34:26,382
Because suddenly nobody wants to fucking buy them.
- Fuck you Sam! Will you give me a fucking break here?

352
00:34:27,421 --> 00:34:30,421
Without an active market, it'd take weeks or months
for me to come up with accurate value on them.

353
00:34:30,942 --> 00:34:35,182
You'll have to go block by block.

354
00:34:39,982 --> 00:34:43,262
Seth, Could you please,
give us for a few moments.

355
00:34:45,302 --> 00:34:46,422
And Peter?

356
00:34:47,102 --> 00:34:50,543
Has anyone else has seen this?
- No one aside from us.

357
00:34:50,582 --> 00:34:51,383
And Eric Dale?
- Yes.

358
00:34:52,422 --> 00:34:55,583
And can it really be possible that we don't know,
where Eric Dale is?

359
00:34:56,423 --> 00:34:59,543
I called his wife. He hasn't come home yet
...and we turned off his phone today.

360
00:35:02,342 --> 00:35:04,502
Perfect. Well, I'd like to know where he is.

361
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:16,623
Jesus fucking Christ! Who is that guy?

362
00:35:19,423 --> 00:35:20,544
He's Sam's boss.
- He looks like he's fifteen years old.

363
00:35:21,384 --> 00:35:22,743
He's Forty.
- Yeah, How does that happen?

364
00:35:26,223 --> 00:35:27,103
Oh it happens all the time.

365
00:35:30,663 --> 00:35:35,904
Except to me.
He's a fucking killer.

366
00:35:38,144 --> 00:35:39,063
hat are they talking about, in there?

367
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,224
It aint pretty.

368
00:35:47,784 --> 00:35:48,944
What aint pretty?

369
00:35:50,944 --> 00:35:52,345
If people suddenly stop buying what we're selling....

370
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:02,824
Jared, you cannot be doing
what you are thinking about doing?

371
00:36:02,865 --> 00:36:03,625
Well, I don't see any other choice.

372
00:36:04,465 --> 00:36:07,225
What does that mean?
Fuck you... you don't have a choice.

373
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:09,664
Fuck me? Did you even looked at the numbers Sam??

374
00:36:09,945 --> 00:36:12,345
Yes, but what do I know.

375
00:36:12,345 --> 00:36:13,345
Correct me, if i'm wrong, Mr.Shah.

376
00:36:13,785 --> 00:36:15,305
These number, they don't add up.

377
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:17,185
One and one, no longer makes Two.

378
00:36:17,185 --> 00:36:19,785
If I may, I'd like a little more time.

379
00:36:21,105 --> 00:36:24,145
We have talked about this.
- We need a little time before to give you our conclusion.

380
00:36:25,385 --> 00:36:26,825
We meet again in 45 minutes.

381
00:36:28,265 --> 00:36:29,666
Sam, do you have the file?

382
00:36:46,346 --> 00:36:47,386
What are you going to do?

383
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:52,826
Are you going to call him?

384
00:36:57,186 --> 00:36:58,146
I already have.

385
00:37:12,987 --> 00:37:13,866
Jesus.

386
00:37:19,107 --> 00:37:20,867
Wow. It's gorgeous.

387
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:30,307
It's a long way down.

388
00:37:31,588 --> 00:37:32,867
Yes, it is.

389
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:45,787
Don't do that, C'mon.

390
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:53,628
Did you know the fear most people feel
when they stand on the edge like this isn't the fear of falling.

391
00:37:55,388 --> 00:37:56,508
It's the fear that they might jump?

392
00:37:59,188 --> 00:38:00,668
Well, that's very deep and depressing, thank you.

393
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:02,789
Yeah, well...I'm a little dark..
Sometimes.

394
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:05,309
Come down, please.
C'mon...Will?

395
00:38:07,148 --> 00:38:10,028
Yeah, Fuck it!

396
00:38:11,468 --> 00:38:12,869
Not today.

397
00:38:19,909 --> 00:38:21,428
So it looks like,
they are gonna make us dump this shit.

398
00:38:21,428 --> 00:38:22,429
What?

399
00:38:23,909 --> 00:38:24,949
You watch.

400
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:25,949
How?

401
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:29,509
You'll see!
- How could they do that?

402
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:32,029
You can't...it's impossible.
But they'll figure out a way.

403
00:38:32,989 --> 00:38:35,709
I've been at this place
for ten years and I've seen some things you wouldn't..

404
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:38,070
you wouldn't believe...

405
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,549
when all is said and done... they do not lose money.
They don't mind if everyone else does,

406
00:38:43,629 --> 00:38:44,829
but they don't loose.

407
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,150
Will?

408
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,950
Did you really make two and half million last year?

409
00:38:58,990 --> 00:38:59,990
Yeah..sure.

410
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,110
How did you spend it all?

411
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,871
They expire quickly.

412
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,710
You know, You'll learn and spend
what's in your pocket.

413
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,711
Two and half millions goes quickly?

414
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,750
Alright, let's see.

415
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,951
The tax man takes half up front.
So, you're left with one and a quarter.

416
00:39:17,031 --> 00:39:18,711
My morgage takes another 300 grand.

417
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,631
I send 150 home for my parents,
you know..to keep them going.

418
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,391
So, what's left?
- Eight hundred.

419
00:39:25,911 --> 00:39:27,231
I spend 150 on a car.

420
00:39:28,271 --> 00:39:29,991
About 75 in restaurants,

421
00:39:29,991 --> 00:39:32,751
Probably, 50 on clothes.

422
00:39:33,311 --> 00:39:34,751
And I put 400 away for a rainy day...

423
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:35,751
That's smar.

424
00:39:36,191 --> 00:39:38,432
Yeah, as it turns out.
It looks like the storm's coming.

425
00:39:40,071 --> 00:39:41,271
You still got 125.

426
00:39:43,832 --> 00:39:50,552
Yeah, I did spent 76,520 dollars on
Hookers, booze and dancers. But mainly, hookers.

427
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:52,472
76,5..?

428
00:39:53,272 --> 00:39:58,392
Yeah, It was a little shock initially, but then i realise that
I could claim most of it off, as entertainment.

429
00:40:14,073 --> 00:40:15,192
How old are you?

430
00:40:17,193 --> 00:40:18,273
43.

431
00:40:24,432 --> 00:40:25,553
This is bizzare.

432
00:40:29,153 --> 00:40:31,153
It's like a...dream.

433
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:37,313
Well, I don't know,
seems like we actually may have just woken up.

434
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:41,713
Come in.

435
00:40:43,153 --> 00:40:44,113
How do we look?

436
00:40:46,114 --> 00:40:46,993
I should go.

437
00:40:46,993 --> 00:40:48,193
No, you should stay.

438
00:40:48,233 --> 00:40:49,234
So?

439
00:40:49,913 --> 00:40:50,833
It's legit...

440
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:52,633
the kid killed it.

441
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:54,793
The formula is worthless.

442
00:40:56,593 --> 00:40:57,594
What does that mean?

443
00:40:57,634 --> 00:40:58,554
It's broken.

444
00:40:58,714 --> 00:41:00,354
There are eight trillion dollars of paper

445
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:03,834
around the world relying on that equation??

446
00:41:03,874 --> 00:41:05,594
We were wrong.

447
00:41:06,074 --> 00:41:07,514
No, You mean..
you were wrong.

448
00:41:08,114 --> 00:41:08,754
Don't get me started....

449
00:41:08,754 --> 00:41:09,754
We discussed this!

450
00:41:09,754 --> 00:41:10,754
I'm heading to the conference room.

451
00:41:10,754 --> 00:41:11,754
No, I want you to hear this.

452
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:14,555
I don't want to hear this.

453
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:17,915
How do you think
I've stuck around this place so long?

454
00:41:26,155 --> 00:41:27,275
I've called Tuld.

455
00:41:30,235 --> 00:41:31,475
Is there a contingency plan here?

456
00:41:31,835 --> 00:41:32,875
A contingency plan?

457
00:41:34,274 --> 00:41:35,835
- Yes.
- No, We went all in on this one.

458
00:41:38,675 --> 00:41:40,035
So, we've got ourselves quite exposed
here... haven't we?

459
00:41:43,035 --> 00:41:45,315
To Tuld or the market?

460
00:41:47,595 --> 00:41:48,876
To both.

461
00:42:10,156 --> 00:42:11,076
He's here?

462
00:42:40,477 --> 00:42:42,237
Tuld's helicopter just landed.

463
00:42:42,237 --> 00:42:43,237
I know, come with us.

464
00:42:44,157 --> 00:42:46,557
Where's Sam?
- I don't know, You sure..you want all of us?       -Yes.

465
00:42:52,517 --> 00:42:56,757
Just one piece of advice
for everyone before we go in there.

466
00:42:57,197 --> 00:42:58,478
This could get a little ugly.

467
00:42:59,157 --> 00:43:03,197
but whatever you do... just... tell the truth.
No sugar coating. Do not change a word of it.

468
00:43:03,197 --> 00:43:04,198
no one here is smart enough...

469
00:43:04,718 --> 00:43:06,758
Including the rocket scientist.

470
00:43:16,798 --> 00:43:17,678
This way please.

471
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:24,238
He's already in there waiting for you.

472
00:43:26,118 --> 00:43:27,478
Excellent!

473
00:43:51,479 --> 00:43:52,839
Please sit down.

474
00:43:55,879 --> 00:43:56,879
Welcome everyone.

475
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:01,039
I must apologize for dragging you all
here at such an uncommon hour;

476
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:03,319
but from what I've been told,
this matter needs to be handled urgently!

477
00:44:04,759 --> 00:44:06,679
so urgently, in fact.. it probably should
have been addressed weeks ago...

478
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:09,360
but that is spilled milk...
Under the bridge!

479
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,239
So, why doesn't somebody tell me
what they think is going on here?

480
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,760
Well, Mr. Tuld..
as I mentioned earlier..

481
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,160
if you compare the figure at the top page 13...

482
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,800
Jared, it's a ?..just speak to me in plain english.

483
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,080
But I'd  like to speak to the guy who put this
together... Mr. Sullivan is it?

484
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,080
Does he speak English?

485
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,081
Sir?

486
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,841
I'd like to speak to the analyst who
seems to have stumbled across this mess.

487
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,241
Certainly, that would be Peter Sullivan.
Right here.

488
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,961
Oh Mr.Sullivan. You are here!
Good morning.

489
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:42,401
And maybe, you could tell me..
what you think is going on here.

490
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:46,561
And please speak as you might
to a young child ..

491
00:44:46,961 --> 00:44:48,201
or a golden retriever.

492
00:44:49,401 --> 00:44:51,641
It wasn't brains, that got me here.
I can assure you of that.

493
00:45:00,162 --> 00:45:01,441
Well, sir. As you may or may not
know I work for Mr.Rogers.

494
00:45:01,681 --> 00:45:05,761
As an associate in the risk assessment
and management office at GSMBS

495
00:45:06,282 --> 00:45:07,962
Just relax, stand up.
Tell us in clear voice

496
00:45:08,802 --> 00:45:10,161
What is the nature of the problem.

497
00:45:16,161 --> 00:45:20,482
Yes... Well as you probably know over the
last 36-40 months the firm has begun

498
00:45:21,922 --> 00:45:23,602
packaging new MBS products;

499
00:45:24,562 --> 00:45:30,722
that combine several different traunches of rating
classification in one tradable security.

500
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:36,242
This has been enourmously profitable...
as I imagine you noticed.

501
00:45:36,763 --> 00:45:38,002
I have.

502
00:45:38,642 --> 00:45:41,323
Well the firm is currently doing
a considerable amount of this business every day.

503
00:45:41,323 --> 00:45:45,043
The problem..which is I guess
why we are here tonight.

504
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:47,523
is that it takes us...
the firm, about a month...

505
00:45:48,043 --> 00:45:51,243
to layer these products correctly.

506
00:45:51,243 --> 00:45:54,043
thereby posing a challenge
from a risk assessment standpoint.

507
00:45:54,483 --> 00:45:55,923
And Mr. Sullivan that challenge is?

508
00:45:56,283 --> 00:46:00,763
We have to hold these assets on our books
longer than we might ideally like to.

509
00:46:00,763 --> 00:46:01,763
- Yes.

510
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:07,844
But the key factor is here is, these are essentially just mortgages,
that has allowed us to push the leverage considerably..

511
00:46:08,924 --> 00:46:11,163
beyond what you might be willing or allowed to do;

512
00:46:11,163 --> 00:46:16,403
in any other circumstance, thereby
pushing the risk profile without raising any red flags.

513
00:46:17,284 --> 00:46:20,723
Now, Thank you...sit down.
What I am guessing, your report here says;

514
00:46:21,443 --> 00:46:23,164
give me some rope,

515
00:46:24,164 --> 00:46:25,444
what I am guessing, it says is that..

516
00:46:26,204 --> 00:46:27,484
considering the, shall we say?

517
00:46:28,164 --> 00:46:30,804
bumpy road, we've been on the last week or so.

518
00:46:31,444 --> 00:46:34,604
But the figures your brilliant co- workers up
the line ahead of you had come up with..

519
00:46:35,524 --> 00:46:37,084
don't make much sense anymore;

520
00:46:37,764 --> 00:46:39,364
Considering what's taking place today?

521
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:42,645
Actually not taking place today...

522
00:46:42,684 --> 00:46:45,124
but what's already taken place
over the last two weeks.

523
00:46:45,165 --> 00:46:47,325
So, you are saying , this had already happened?

524
00:46:48,885 --> 00:46:49,805
- Sort of.

525
00:46:53,525 --> 00:46:56,045
And Mr. Sullivan,
what does your model say that that means...

526
00:46:56,845 --> 00:46:58,005
for us here?

527
00:46:59,165 --> 00:47:00,285
Well, that's where it becomes a projection.

528
00:47:02,325 --> 00:47:04,085
But... ummm..

529
00:47:05,005 --> 00:47:06,645
You're speaking with me Mr. Sullivan.

530
00:47:08,005 --> 00:47:09,046
Well... sir...

531
00:47:10,126 --> 00:47:12,245
If those assets decrease..

532
00:47:13,085 --> 00:47:14,605
by just 25 percent,
and remain on our books...

533
00:47:16,126 --> 00:47:17,045
that loss...

534
00:47:18,365 --> 00:47:21,006
would be greater than the current market
capitalization of this entire company.

535
00:47:27,205 --> 00:47:28,645
So what you're telling me...

536
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:31,006
is that...

537
00:47:31,686 --> 00:47:32,886
music is about to stop.

538
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:39,126
and we are going to be left holding...
'the biggest bag of odorous excrement'

539
00:47:40,046 --> 00:47:44,846
ever assembled in the history of capitalism?

540
00:47:48,846 --> 00:47:49,886
Well sir, I'm not sure I'd..

541
00:47:51,047 --> 00:47:52,727
put it that way, but let me clarify...

542
00:47:53,126 --> 00:47:54,647
using your analogy,

543
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,767
what this model shows...

544
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:01,527
is the music, so to speak,
just slowing,

545
00:48:02,167 --> 00:48:03,727
If the music were to stop,
as you put it,

546
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:06,007
then this model would not be even close;

547
00:48:07,367 --> 00:48:10,807
to that scenario.
It would be considerably worse.

548
00:48:14,088 --> 00:48:15,408
Let me tell you something Mr. Sullivan.

549
00:48:18,007 --> 00:48:22,848
Do you care to know,
why I'm in this chair with you all?

550
00:48:22,848 --> 00:48:23,847
Why I earn the big bucks?

551
00:48:26,727 --> 00:48:27,488
- Yes.

552
00:48:27,528 --> 00:48:28,448
I'm here for one reason

553
00:48:28,968 --> 00:48:30,168
and one reason alone.

554
00:48:30,648 --> 00:48:34,528
I'm here to guess,
what the music might do, a week, a month,

555
00:48:34,888 --> 00:48:36,368
a year from now.

556
00:48:38,288 --> 00:48:39,128
That's it!

557
00:48:39,768 --> 00:48:40,648
nothing more...

558
00:48:43,408 --> 00:48:44,688
I'm standing here tonight...

559
00:48:46,328 --> 00:48:51,928
I'm afraid that,
I don't hear... a... thing...

560
00:48:54,608 --> 00:48:59,689
just... silence!

561
00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:17,729
So, now that we know that the music has
stopped, what can we do about it?

562
00:49:20,169 --> 00:49:21,050
Mr. Cohen,
Ms. Robertson,

563
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:26,289
I'm afraid, I think..this is where
you are supposed to step back in.

564
00:49:26,609 --> 00:49:29,849
Lord knows we've relied enough
on Mr. Sullivan tonight.

565
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,290
What have you got for us?

566
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:42,170
What have I told you since...

567
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:43,850
the first day you walked into my office?

568
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,130
There are three ways
to make a living in this business...

569
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:52,890
Be first, be smarter,
or cheat.

570
00:49:53,571 --> 00:49:55,251
Now, I don't cheat...

571
00:49:55,251 --> 00:49:59,490
And although I like to think,
we've some pretty smart people in this building.

572
00:50:00,411 --> 00:50:03,210
it sure is a hell of alot easier
to just be first.

573
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:06,051
- Sell it all...today!

574
00:50:08,331 --> 00:50:09,411
Is that even possible Sam?

575
00:50:10,891 --> 00:50:12,571
Yes, but at what cost?

576
00:50:15,051 --> 00:50:16,211
I'll have to pay.

577
00:50:17,571 --> 00:50:18,411
Really?

578
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:21,131
I think so.

579
00:50:21,892 --> 00:50:23,131
Where does this gonna come back to us?

580
00:50:25,531 --> 00:50:26,531
- Everywhere.

581
00:50:27,412 --> 00:50:30,931
Sam, I don't think you seem to understand
what your boy here had just said...

582
00:50:34,852 --> 00:50:35,731
if I made you...

583
00:50:36,811 --> 00:50:37,972
how would you do it?

584
00:50:44,412 --> 00:50:46,692
Well, you call the traders in
for their normal 6:30 meeting...

585
00:50:46,692 --> 00:50:47,692
and you be honest with them.

586
00:50:47,732 --> 00:50:48,812
B'cos they're gonna know it's the end either way.

587
00:50:50,692 --> 00:50:52,572
so you'd have to throw them a bone,
and a pretty big one.

588
00:50:52,652 --> 00:50:54,293
And then, you've gotta come
out of the gate storming...

589
00:50:55,253 --> 00:50:56,772
No swaps..no nothing.

590
00:50:57,692 --> 00:51:02,813
40 percent done by 10:15; by 11 O'clock
all your trades have to be gone. 'cos by lunch-time

591
00:51:02,813 --> 00:51:03,812
words are gonna be out.

592
00:51:04,453 --> 00:51:08,732
and by two o'clock you'll be getting 65 cents
on the dollar, if you're lucky,

593
00:51:09,013 --> 00:51:12,053
and the feds will be in here up your ass;
trying to slow us down.

594
00:51:12,053 --> 00:51:13,933
Ramesh?
- They can slow you down...

595
00:51:13,933 --> 00:51:16,813
but they can't stop you.
it's yours to sell.

596
00:51:17,293 --> 00:51:18,453
John...even if..

597
00:51:19,373 --> 00:51:23,173
we manage pull that off,
and that's saying something...

598
00:51:24,093 --> 00:51:25,133
The real question is...

599
00:51:25,653 --> 00:51:26,533
Who are we selling this to?

600
00:51:27,733 --> 00:51:31,053
The same people we've been selling to
for the last two years, and whoever else will buy it.

601
00:51:31,734 --> 00:51:33,414
But John, If you do this.

602
00:51:35,214 --> 00:51:38,654
You would've killed that market
for years. It's over.

603
00:51:40,374 --> 00:51:43,694
And you are selling something
that you know has no value.

604
00:51:43,694 --> 00:51:45,534
We are selling to willing buyers

605
00:51:46,053 --> 00:51:47,454
at a current fair market price,

606
00:51:48,454 --> 00:51:51,614
so that WE may survive!

607
00:51:52,094 --> 00:51:56,814
You'll never sell anything to any of
those people ever again.

608
00:51:56,814 --> 00:51:57,814
- I understand.
- Do you?

609
00:51:57,814 --> 00:51:58,934
- Do You???

610
00:51:59,734 --> 00:52:00,934
This is it!

611
00:52:01,534 --> 00:52:03,214
I'm telling you.
This is it.

612
00:52:14,455 --> 00:52:15,535
It's 4:00...O'clock.

613
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:19,655
Jared you've got till 5:00 to break this down
and draw me up a plan.

614
00:52:19,695 --> 00:52:24,135
Is there anyone else who knows
what's in there right now, block by block?

615
00:52:24,135 --> 00:52:25,135
- Eric Dale.

616
00:52:26,255 --> 00:52:27,135
Where is he?

617
00:52:27,695 --> 00:52:30,015
As of today he is no longer with the firm.

618
00:52:30,536 --> 00:52:33,536
We have been trying to locate him.

619
00:52:37,175 --> 00:52:38,735
- Carmelo?      - Yes?
- Get me Eric Dale here by Six.

620
00:52:40,856 --> 00:52:41,896
- Done.

621
00:52:42,016 --> 00:52:43,576
We meet back here in an hour.

622
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:48,256
Sam, let's talk.

623
00:53:00,336 --> 00:53:01,176
This is a hell of a town.

624
00:53:04,176 --> 00:53:05,256
I've always loved this place.

625
00:53:05,536 --> 00:53:08,056
Since the day i arived.
Everything about it.

626
00:53:17,256 --> 00:53:18,576
Sam, are you gonna go with me on this?

627
00:53:21,977 --> 00:53:23,257
I don't know John.

628
00:53:25,497 --> 00:53:27,017
This one is very ugly.

629
00:53:28,177 --> 00:53:30,497
You and I are salesmen.

630
00:53:31,817 --> 00:53:34,297
We sell. That's what we do.
It's not complicated.

631
00:53:34,297 --> 00:53:35,297
Exactly.

632
00:53:35,297 --> 00:53:36,298
And you know damn well..

633
00:53:37,057 --> 00:53:40,258
you don't make a sale unless
you think the guy is gonna come back for more,

634
00:53:40,297 --> 00:53:46,138
That's the lesson we learned.
and tomorrow we are done.

635
00:53:47,178 --> 00:53:48,337
This is the big one.

636
00:53:49,858 --> 00:53:51,258
Most of us aren't gonna make it out of this one.

637
00:53:53,497 --> 00:53:54,538
- Us?
- The street.

638
00:53:54,538 --> 00:53:56,858
What are you talking about?

639
00:53:56,978 --> 00:53:57,978
This isn't  the last 'situation' I will
have to deal with this week.

640
00:53:59,338 --> 00:54:01,258
This is just the start.

641
00:54:01,298 --> 00:54:04,338
It's the start because you are starting it.

642
00:54:04,378 --> 00:54:05,338
Maybe. But I don't believe that.

643
00:54:05,058 --> 00:54:06,058
Not this time.

644
00:54:07,418 --> 00:54:08,579
The numbers just don't add up anymore.

645
00:54:09,338 --> 00:54:11,378
- Well I agree with you there.
I've been saying that for years.

646
00:54:12,738 --> 00:54:15,938
I mean if this kid out there can
come up with this thing...?

647
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:21,779
- I don't think I can go in knowing what I
know and put the hammer down on these guys like this.

648
00:54:21,779 --> 00:54:22,778
When did you start becoming so soft, Sam?

649
00:54:24,859 --> 00:54:27,619
Fuck you soft, you're panicking.

650
00:54:30,259 --> 00:54:32,059
If you're the first one out the door;

651
00:54:32,659 --> 00:54:34,099
That's not called panicking.

652
00:54:40,419 --> 00:54:43,779
Well, you are obviously operating
with more information than i have.

653
00:54:45,859 --> 00:54:47,019
But I think this could destroy this firm.

654
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,779
No one will ever trust you again.

655
00:54:50,139 --> 00:54:52,179
Knowingly putting people out of business.
Full stop.

656
00:54:55,419 --> 00:54:56,660
- Let me deal with that, Sam.

657
00:55:12,181 --> 00:55:13,141
How'd that go?

658
00:55:14,461 --> 00:55:15,700
This is a fucking shit show.

659
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,620
They are gonna go with it?
- Probably.

660
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,341
- Jesus!

661
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:24,421
Remember this day boys,

662
00:55:26,901 --> 00:55:28,300
Remember this day.

663
00:55:44,061 --> 00:55:45,101
What's the strategy here?

664
00:55:47,222 --> 00:55:48,381
Well, that's why i'm headed downstairs,
to work it with my guys.

665
00:55:48,701 --> 00:55:51,062
No, not you and I...
With John.

666
00:55:57,182 --> 00:55:59,702
I'm not sure that we need one, Sarah.
That's not the way I do things.

667
00:56:01,661 --> 00:56:02,662
Please.

668
00:56:04,542 --> 00:56:06,062
Listen, He knows where we are still on this.

669
00:56:07,902 --> 00:56:08,942
All along.

670
00:56:09,542 --> 00:56:10,982
That's exactly my point.

671
00:56:11,582 --> 00:56:12,782
And knowing what was discussed..

672
00:56:14,102 --> 00:56:18,903
by both you and I. I don't think
this could provide you with anything.

673
00:56:18,903 --> 00:56:20,343
other than, false sense of comfort.

674
00:56:21,262 --> 00:56:23,343
I'm not looking for sense of comfort.

675
00:56:25,462 --> 00:56:27,102
I don't think there's one to be found.

676
00:56:38,183 --> 00:56:39,383
So again, what's the strategy?

677
00:56:42,903 --> 00:56:44,583
I'm just not sure there's much more to do in this.

678
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:47,303
It's very simple.

679
00:56:47,983 --> 00:56:50,104
Don't even think of fucking me on this.

680
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:53,983
because if we are going down...

681
00:56:54,904 --> 00:56:55,984
you damn well know we'll  be together.

682
00:57:00,384 --> 00:57:01,744
No, I'm not sure I do know that.

683
00:57:39,704 --> 00:57:40,905
What do you think Tuld made last year?

684
00:57:44,505 --> 00:57:45,345
Would you shut the fuck up.

685
00:57:46,105 --> 00:57:47,385
86 mil.

686
00:57:48,825 --> 00:57:50,465
In bonuses and salary .

687
00:57:52,185 --> 00:57:53,145
Really?

688
00:57:53,185 --> 00:57:53,785
Sure, it's public record.

689
00:57:56,745 --> 00:57:58,225
He was worth a billion.

690
00:57:59,466 --> 00:58:00,745
- Was?

691
00:58:00,745 --> 00:58:01,585
Until today.

692
00:58:13,626 --> 00:58:14,826
I could use some real air.

693
00:58:15,706 --> 00:58:16,906
Probably a good idea.

694
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:40,227
Hello, Will Emerson.

695
00:58:40,947 --> 00:58:41,907
Hello?

696
00:58:48,067 --> 00:58:50,227
No, thank you. I understand.

697
00:58:53,107 --> 00:58:54,667
No, we'll be discreet.

698
00:58:57,387 --> 00:58:59,187
What?

699
00:58:59,187 --> 00:59:00,188
Eric's wife.

700
00:59:00,627 --> 00:59:03,267
He's alive, he's home. He doesn't wanna
speak to us. He doesn't know she rang me.

701
00:59:03,788 --> 00:59:04,748
Where's he live?

702
00:59:04,748 --> 00:59:05,747
The heights.

703
00:59:05,787 --> 00:59:07,427
Should we call Tuld's guy?

704
00:59:08,188 --> 00:59:11,507
No.it's Eric...the last thing we need is those guys
going over there, you two go try to get him.

705
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:13,388
But you've got to be back here by 6:00 AM.

706
00:59:17,308 --> 00:59:18,268
I hate Brooklyn.

707
00:59:23,548 --> 00:59:24,548
May I come in?

708
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,028
Please, sit down.

709
00:59:37,389 --> 00:59:38,668
So... we are going to do this thing.

710
00:59:43,188 --> 00:59:44,229
- Okay.

711
00:59:44,988 --> 00:59:46,029
It's going to be tight.

712
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:49,949
Is Sam on board?

713
00:59:50,389 --> 00:59:51,309
Not yet.

714
00:59:55,349 --> 00:59:56,429
Sarah,

715
00:59:57,109 --> 00:59:58,349
I need a head.

716
00:59:58,829 --> 01:00:01,829
to feed to the traders...
on the floor and the board.

717
01:00:05,389 --> 01:00:06,589
Is it me or Cohen?

718
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:08,350
- It's you.

719
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:19,030
Of course you are...

720
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:22,790
well aware I filtered several warnings
to you and Cohen about this .

721
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:24,230
A year ago.

722
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:29,750
I really don't think that's the best path for you
to be taking at this point.

723
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:34,190
you're going to be well taken care of.

724
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:42,630
Obviously it's quite complicated.

725
01:00:42,671 --> 01:00:43,831
John I was told that in no uncertain terms...

726
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:45,871
It was always a very grey area.

727
01:00:46,751 --> 01:00:48,950
Actually it was made very clear at the time,

728
01:00:49,351 --> 01:00:51,031
by you and I and Cohen.

729
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:57,351
I'd really prefer that you didn't fight me on this...

730
01:01:08,151 --> 01:01:10,911
We all fucked this one up pretty good...

731
01:01:15,312 --> 01:01:18,512
We need you to stay here till
this is finished and the markets close.

732
01:01:19,872 --> 01:01:20,832
I understand.

733
01:01:23,072 --> 01:01:24,711
They'll go over the numbers with you downstairs...

734
01:01:26,952 --> 01:01:28,352
Good luck.

735
01:01:47,552 --> 01:01:48,993
What's the boy wonder want?

736
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:56,872
You got a minute?

737
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:59,553
We're just off to pick up Eric.
- Yeah I know. Will only take a second.

738
01:01:59,553 --> 01:02:00,553
- Alright, what is it?

739
01:02:01,313 --> 01:02:05,313
- Tuld and I have  concerns that Sam,
may not be step up and do the right thing.

740
01:02:06,553 --> 01:02:08,073
- It's never been a problem.

741
01:02:08,073 --> 01:02:09,073
- No, it hasn't.

742
01:02:09,593 --> 01:02:11,793
But, sometimes in an acute situation,
Such as this...

743
01:02:12,513 --> 01:02:14,834
often what is right.

744
01:02:15,674 --> 01:02:20,714
Can take on,
mutiple interpretations.

745
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:23,273
- Sam will step up.

746
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:24,274
- Oh, I know..he will.

747
01:02:24,593 --> 01:02:28,394
But if he doesn't.
IF he does not...

748
01:02:29,114 --> 01:02:30,314
We need to know that,
You will.

749
01:02:33,474 --> 01:02:34,594
- You need to know that,
I will... What?

750
01:02:35,754 --> 01:02:37,154
- That you will step up.

751
01:02:39,114 --> 01:02:41,634
- I have not doubt.
That Sam will make the right decision.

752
01:02:41,634 --> 01:02:44,115
But, just to make it clear.

753
01:02:44,115 --> 01:02:47,235
He and I always have the same interpretation,
Of what's right.

754
01:02:48,354 --> 01:02:50,434
No matter, How acute...
the situation.

755
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:33,200
Jesus, that's a nice place.

756
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,199
- Yeah,  it is.. he just bought it.

757
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:36,920
- I hope it was with cash.

758
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:41,480
- Fuck me. You are a heartless
little shit sometimes.

759
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,720
and it wasn't.

760
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,120
Don't touch any of the buttons!

761
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,080
What are you doing here?

762
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,440
- Hey?

763
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,720
So..Peter finished that model
you were working on.

764
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:07,800
- Really?

765
01:06:07,841 --> 01:06:09,281
- Caused a shit storm.

766
01:06:09,881 --> 01:06:10,881
I bet...it did.

767
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,241
- Do you think he's right?

768
01:06:14,361 --> 01:06:15,240
- I know...he's right.

769
01:06:27,682 --> 01:06:31,561
Jared Cohen called an emergency meeting
of the senior partners last night.

770
01:06:31,601 --> 01:06:32,962
Based on your findings..

771
01:06:34,042 --> 01:06:36,961
They've decided to liquidate our entire position.

772
01:06:38,442 --> 01:06:39,442
Today!

773
01:06:41,482 --> 01:06:42,762
- I am very sorry about that.

774
01:06:49,242 --> 01:06:52,402
They are worried about you being out here.
And  they want me to get you back.

775
01:06:52,402 --> 01:06:57,722
- Jesus!
- I'm just saying..             - Fuck that.

776
01:06:57,762 --> 01:07:01,403
Don't be rash.
- Forget it, I've signed my papers. I'm out!

777
01:07:03,002 --> 01:07:03,882
They will pay you.

778
01:07:04,922 --> 01:07:05,963
- I've been paid enough, already.

779
01:07:14,963 --> 01:07:16,363
Did you know I built a bridge once?

780
01:07:18,722 --> 01:07:19,523
- Sorry?

781
01:07:19,523 --> 01:07:20,523
- A bridge.

782
01:07:20,843 --> 01:07:22,003
- No, I didn't know that.

783
01:07:22,683 --> 01:07:24,003
- I was an engineer by trade.

784
01:07:27,163 --> 01:07:30,963
It went from Dilles Bottom,
Ohio to Moundsville West Virgina.

785
01:07:31,283 --> 01:07:32,683
It spans 912 feet above the Ohio river.

786
01:07:33,843 --> 01:07:36,564
12,100 people a day use this thing a day.

787
01:07:37,123 --> 01:07:38,203
And It cut out 35 miles...

788
01:07:38,923 --> 01:07:41,803
of extra driving each way,
between Wheeling and New Martinsville.

789
01:07:42,723 --> 01:07:43,884
That's a combined...

790
01:07:44,403 --> 01:07:45,404
847,000 miles of driving,

791
01:07:47,324 --> 01:07:48,284
a day...

792
01:07:48,644 --> 01:07:51,284
Worth 25,410,000 miles...

793
01:07:51,284 --> 01:07:52,284
a month;

794
01:07:53,884 --> 01:07:55,444
and 304 millions

795
01:07:55,964 --> 01:07:57,444
920,000 miles

796
01:07:57,924 --> 01:07:58,804
a year.

797
01:07:58,804 --> 01:07:59,804
Saved.

798
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:04,964
Now, I completed that project in 1986...
that's 22 years ago.

799
01:08:06,445 --> 01:08:09,724
So, Over the life of that one bridge..
that's 6 billion... 708 million...

800
01:08:10,684 --> 01:08:12,524
240 thousand

801
01:08:13,885 --> 01:08:15,085
miles...that haven't had to be driven!

802
01:08:16,765 --> 01:08:19,165
At what? let's say... 50 miles an hour

803
01:08:21,405 --> 01:08:24,085
So, that's a 134 million, 164 thousand
800 hours...

804
01:08:24,885 --> 01:08:25,845
or

805
01:08:26,285 --> 01:08:27,765
559 thousand 20 days...

806
01:08:29,365 --> 01:08:35,845
so that one little bridge has saved the people
of those two communities a combined, 1531 years of their lives

807
01:08:36,765 --> 01:08:38,405
not wasted in a fucking car...

808
01:08:42,645 --> 01:08:46,726
One thousand five hundred and 31 years!

809
01:08:46,726 --> 01:08:47,726
- Jesus.

810
01:08:58,846 --> 01:08:59,886
I guess... you better get back over there.

811
01:09:05,566 --> 01:09:06,286
- Yeah.

812
01:09:09,966 --> 01:09:11,526
Thanks for coming by.

813
01:09:11,566 --> 01:09:12,526
- You're welcome.

814
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:18,486
Who the fuck is this?

815
01:09:19,086 --> 01:09:21,006
I'd imagine, it's the firm's people.

816
01:09:22,127 --> 01:09:23,166
- What?

817
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:24,246
Tuld doesn't want any loose ends.

818
01:09:26,286 --> 01:09:27,366
He fired me.

819
01:09:28,407 --> 01:09:29,527
Fuck em... Fuck em.

820
01:09:29,607 --> 01:09:31,247
- I totally agree...Fuck them.
So, come back...

821
01:09:31,887 --> 01:09:33,127
take the money,
You'll be home by five.

822
01:09:34,527 --> 01:09:37,727
Otherwise, they are going to fight you on everything,
they are going to fight you on the package, the options...

823
01:09:39,447 --> 01:09:40,367
Be smart.

824
01:09:47,047 --> 01:09:48,247
Well..You're a better man than I.

825
01:09:50,087 --> 01:09:51,607
That's always been true.

826
01:09:51,607 --> 01:09:52,608
Yes, it has.

827
01:09:57,768 --> 01:09:58,968
The house looks good.

828
01:10:01,408 --> 01:10:02,128
Thanks.

829
01:10:02,488 --> 01:10:04,008
Hey Eric...

830
01:10:05,728 --> 01:10:08,368
don't beat yourself up too much
about this stuff, alright?

831
01:10:10,168 --> 01:10:11,608
Some people like driving the long way home.

832
01:10:12,888 --> 01:10:14,088
Who the fuck knows. Right?

833
01:10:45,769 --> 01:10:46,770
There he is.

834
01:10:48,609 --> 01:10:49,489
John.

835
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:52,170
How's it looking?

836
01:10:53,809 --> 01:10:55,170
- Cohen has done a nice job. It can work.

837
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:57,609
- What does that mean?

838
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:03,450
It means, as you very well know,

839
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:07,810
that you are a very important piece of this puzzle.

840
01:11:40,011 --> 01:11:41,051
It's not a gift.

841
01:11:41,571 --> 01:11:44,371
I need to know you are with me on this.

842
01:11:47,291 --> 01:11:48,611
I'm with the firm John.

843
01:11:51,731 --> 01:11:55,731
I won't get what I need out of your boys
on the floor, unless they believe you...

844
01:11:57,371 --> 01:11:59,891
unless they believe in you completely.

845
01:12:04,012 --> 01:12:05,051
Are you in, on this?

846
01:12:07,972 --> 01:12:09,532
- I told you my reservations.

847
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:10,732
You can't have reservations!

848
01:12:13,012 --> 01:12:14,452
And I need to know now.

849
01:12:16,692 --> 01:12:22,492
Look John..I'm  completelywith the firm, as I
always have been. Excuse me.

850
01:12:46,573 --> 01:12:50,813
Alright, Will. Am I getting fired?

851
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:52,573
- I don't know.

852
01:12:57,094 --> 01:12:59,773
Yeah, almost definitely.

853
01:13:01,693 --> 01:13:05,814
- Are you?
- No.

854
01:13:07,453 --> 01:13:11,334
Seth, its nothing you did.
You're just in a wrong firm, in a wrong time.

855
01:13:11,974 --> 01:13:15,414
Young guys are always the one to get called.
Listen, nothing i can say'll make you better

856
01:13:15,414 --> 01:13:18,774
It's gonna suck for a while...
and then you'll be fine.

857
01:13:23,894 --> 01:13:24,694
You alright?

858
01:13:26,934 --> 01:13:28,055
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

859
01:13:28,055 --> 01:13:31,895
For what its worth,
I'm sorry this is happening to you.

860
01:13:33,815 --> 01:13:36,335
- Don't be. You didn't do it to me.

861
01:13:36,335 --> 01:13:38,815
- Still, Al least you're gonna
have some nice cash to walk away with.

862
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:41,335
- I guess.

863
01:13:41,335 --> 01:13:45,055
This is really gonna effect people.
- Yeah, it's gonna affect people like me.

864
01:13:45,494 --> 01:13:46,615
- No, real people.

865
01:13:46,975 --> 01:13:48,135
Jesus, Seth.

866
01:13:48,935 --> 01:13:52,495
If you really wanna do this with your life.
You have to believe you're necessary. And you are.

867
01:13:53,335 --> 01:13:56,095
People wanna live like this. In their cars
and their big fucking houses, that they can't even pay for.

868
01:13:56,695 --> 01:13:58,095
Then, you're necessary.

869
01:13:59,055 --> 01:14:01,455
The only reason, that they all get
continue living like kings is

870
01:14:02,655 --> 01:14:03,775
'cos we got our fingers on the scales in their favour.

871
01:14:03,775 --> 01:14:04,776
I take my hand off.

872
01:14:06,535 --> 01:14:12,255
Well then the whole world gets really fucking fair,
really fucking quickly and nobody asks you one shite.

873
01:14:13,095 --> 01:14:14,295
They want what we've to give them..

874
01:14:14,895 --> 01:14:18,656
but they also wanna you know, play innocent
and pretend they've no idea where it came from.

875
01:14:19,336 --> 01:14:21,696
That's more hypocracy than I'm willing to swallow.
So, fuck them.

876
01:14:22,496 --> 01:14:23,616
Fuck normal people!

877
01:14:24,976 --> 01:14:26,976
You know, the funny thing is.
Tommorow, if all of these goes tits up.

878
01:14:28,816 --> 01:14:31,496
They're gonna crucify us.
For being, too reckless.

879
01:14:31,537 --> 01:14:32,656
But if we are wrong??

880
01:14:33,217 --> 01:14:34,256
And everything gets back on track.

881
01:14:36,176 --> 01:14:38,977
Well then, the same people
are gonna laugh until they piss their pants.

882
01:14:39,577 --> 01:14:41,896
Because, we are gonna look like the biggest
pussies that God ever let through the door.

883
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:48,736
Do you think we are gonna be wrong?

884
01:14:50,617 --> 01:14:52,217
Nah, i don't know..fuck.

885
01:15:06,777 --> 01:15:07,817
Good morning.

886
01:15:08,577 --> 01:15:09,497
Peter...

887
01:15:10,337 --> 01:15:11,297
you want one?

888
01:15:13,058 --> 01:15:14,297
- I don't smoke.

889
01:15:14,297 --> 01:15:17,098
That's good. I don't much either.

890
01:15:27,978 --> 01:15:29,018
Are you tired?

891
01:15:30,258 --> 01:15:31,218
- Of what?

892
01:15:31,778 --> 01:15:32,978
Remember, I don't work as hard as you do.

893
01:15:32,978 --> 01:15:33,978
- Oh, That's not true.

894
01:15:34,178 --> 01:15:35,458
- No it is...actually.

895
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:41,898
- Are we all getting fired after today?
- Probably.

896
01:15:43,738 --> 01:15:45,018
- Are they going to fire you?

897
01:15:46,179 --> 01:15:47,379
- Well, they won't exactly call it that.

898
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:52,859
but... it'll be a mercy killing really.
You don't have to stand out here for me.

899
01:15:54,939 --> 01:15:57,939
- No, I know. I really
don't want to go back in there just yet.

900
01:15:59,419 --> 01:16:00,619
- I understand that.

901
01:16:03,219 --> 01:16:04,299
- I think I know your son.

902
01:16:05,219 --> 01:16:06,179
- Really?

903
01:16:06,579 --> 01:16:08,939
- Not well... but, he always seemed
like a nice person.

904
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:11,779
- He is a nice person.

905
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:14,140
I guess you could say alot worse about a guy.

906
01:16:16,139 --> 01:16:17,339
- Does he know what's about to happen?

907
01:16:19,099 --> 01:16:20,100
- What do you mean?

908
01:16:22,339 --> 01:16:23,740
- Did you talk to him?

909
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:26,820
- No..I hadn't even thought of it.

910
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:34,940
- They're all coming in now.

911
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,540
- Yes they are.

912
01:16:42,701 --> 01:16:44,261
- Have you ever done anything like this?

913
01:16:45,821 --> 01:16:49,781
- No... never.... not even close.

914
01:16:55,541 --> 01:16:57,941
- Are you sure..it's the only...

915
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:01,021
or the... right thing to do?

916
01:17:04,421 --> 01:17:05,381
-  For who?

917
01:17:08,181 --> 01:17:09,221
I'm not sure.

918
01:17:10,261 --> 01:17:11,461
- Neither am I.

919
01:18:51,585 --> 01:18:52,504
- You alright?

920
01:18:55,905 --> 01:18:57,504
You are about to fire me.

921
01:19:13,785 --> 01:19:16,745
You know, this is..
This is all I've ever wanted to do.

922
01:19:23,465 --> 01:19:24,665
- Really?

923
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:00,626
You as well, huh?

924
01:20:00,666 --> 01:20:01,626
- Yes.

925
01:20:03,107 --> 01:20:04,427
- Jesus!

926
01:20:06,986 --> 01:20:07,787
Sorry.

927
01:20:07,787 --> 01:20:09,026
- Thank you.

928
01:20:23,147 --> 01:20:25,428
I didn't think they were going
to be able to get you back here.

929
01:20:28,788 --> 01:20:30,547
- They told me they were going to drag me
through hell on everything

930
01:20:30,987 --> 01:20:33,507
the next two years..
my options, my healthcare

931
01:20:34,627 --> 01:20:36,147
or I could come back here and make...

932
01:20:37,548 --> 01:20:38,628
$176,471.00 an hour

933
01:20:41,667 --> 01:20:42,548
to sit quietly...  in this room.

934
01:20:45,988 --> 01:20:47,548
I couldn't see much of choice.

935
01:20:48,868 --> 01:20:50,028
- It never is.

936
01:20:54,068 --> 01:20:55,668
Obviously looking back,

937
01:20:56,308 --> 01:21:00,109
It was expressed with insufficient urgency...

938
01:21:01,309 --> 01:21:02,629
but your point was passed on...

939
01:21:03,589 --> 01:21:04,708
I need you to know that.

940
01:21:06,548 --> 01:21:07,348
Eric.

941
01:21:07,389 --> 01:21:10,269
Its okay, I understand,
believe me.

942
01:21:10,468 --> 01:21:11,829
there was nothing you could have done.

943
01:21:13,509 --> 01:21:14,548
I guess...

944
01:21:17,389 --> 01:21:20,229
at the time... it didn't seem like
there was much of a choice.

945
01:21:21,549 --> 01:21:22,749
- It never does.

946
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:46,150
What is your package going to be like?

947
01:21:49,190 --> 01:21:51,630
- I don't know,
that's what I'm waiting for now.

948
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:54,470
- It probably pretty good.

949
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:57,030
- It better be.

950
01:22:12,671 --> 01:22:15,111
Thank you all for coming in
a little early this morning,

951
01:22:16,391 --> 01:22:19,950
I know yesterday was pretty bad,
and I wish I could say that today is going to be less so,

952
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:20,951
but that isn't going to be the case.

953
01:22:21,791 --> 01:22:24,351
Now, I am supposed to read this
statement here to you all here,

954
01:22:24,351 --> 01:22:27,351
but how bout you read it on your own time
and I'll just tell you what the fuck's going on here.

955
01:22:28,391 --> 01:22:29,991
I've been here all night.

956
01:22:31,111 --> 01:22:32,511
meeting with the executive committee.

957
01:22:33,871 --> 01:22:40,111
and the decision has been made to unwind a considerable
portion of the firm's holdings in several key asset classes.

958
01:22:44,071 --> 01:22:45,592
The crux of it is... in the firm's thinking.

959
01:22:46,111 --> 01:22:48,552
the party is over as of this morning.

960
01:22:49,552 --> 01:22:53,311
There is going to be considerable turmoil
in the markets for the foreseeable future.

961
01:22:53,632 --> 01:22:56,992
And they believe...
it is better, that this turmoil begin with us...

962
01:23:00,272 --> 01:23:01,352
as a result...

963
01:23:02,392 --> 01:23:03,672
the firm has decided to liquidate

964
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:07,152
its majority positions of fixed income MBS..

965
01:23:08,753 --> 01:23:09,713
today.

966
01:23:10,553 --> 01:23:11,873
These are your packets,

967
01:23:12,392 --> 01:23:15,792
you will see what accounts you are  responsible for today.

968
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:18,713
I'm sure it hasn't taken you long to..

969
01:23:20,432 --> 01:23:22,033
understand the implications of this sale.

970
01:23:23,072 --> 01:23:26,233
on your relationships with your counter-parties
and as a result...

971
01:23:28,633 --> 01:23:29,913
on your careers.

972
01:23:29,953 --> 01:23:30,993
I have expressed this

973
01:23:31,393 --> 01:23:32,393
reality

974
01:23:33,153 --> 01:23:36,153
to the executive committee and they understand.

975
01:23:36,193 --> 01:23:36,513
As a result,

976
01:23:37,193 --> 01:23:40,074
if you achieve a 93% sale of your assets...

977
01:23:40,713 --> 01:23:45,114
you will receive a 1.4 million dollar one off bonus.

978
01:23:45,913 --> 01:23:47,193
If the floor as a whole

979
01:23:47,874 --> 01:23:56,034
achieves a 93% sale you will
get an additional 1.3 million a piece.

980
01:23:56,634 --> 01:23:58,594
For those of you who have never been
through this before,

981
01:23:59,274 --> 01:24:01,514
this is what the beginning of a fire sale looks like.

982
01:24:02,594 --> 01:24:06,034
I cannot begin to tell you
how important first hour and half is gonna be.

983
01:24:06,034 --> 01:24:08,314
I want you to hit every bite you can find.

984
01:24:08,594 --> 01:24:10,034
Dealers, brokers, clients...

985
01:24:10,634 --> 01:24:11,635
Your mother, if she respond.

986
01:24:13,594 --> 01:24:14,474
No swaps.

987
01:24:15,074 --> 01:24:17,954
It's outgoing only,
today.

988
01:24:20,434 --> 01:24:24,475
Obviously, this isn't going  down the way
that any of us would've hoped.

989
01:24:25,354 --> 01:24:28,315
but the ground is shifting below our feet,

990
01:24:28,474 --> 01:24:30,795
And apparently,
there is no other way out.

991
01:24:49,955 --> 01:24:56,435
Christ... this is Obviously,
a very very unique situation...

992
01:24:56,956 --> 01:24:58,156
if we are successful today.

993
01:24:59,435 --> 01:25:02,036
We will have been successful in
destroying our own jobs...

994
01:25:04,476 --> 01:25:05,876
I can not promise that any of you..
all of you...

995
01:25:08,956 --> 01:25:10,036
Some of you would be repositioned within the firm.

996
01:25:12,196 --> 01:25:13,316
but I can tell you that, I am very proud
of the work we've done here today.

997
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:20,356
I have been at this place,

998
01:25:21,796 --> 01:25:22,917
34 years,

999
01:25:24,276 --> 01:25:29,796
I can tell you from experience, that people are going to say
some very nasty things about what we do here today.

1000
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:32,556
about what you've dedicated a portion of your lives to.

1001
01:25:35,757 --> 01:25:38,397
But have faith that in the bigger picture,

1002
01:25:39,197 --> 01:25:40,357
our skills have not been wasted,

1003
01:25:41,077 --> 01:25:42,637
we have accomplished much,

1004
01:25:43,117 --> 01:25:44,317
and our talents

1005
01:25:44,997 --> 01:25:46,237
have been used...

1006
01:25:48,197 --> 01:25:49,637
for the greater good.

1007
01:25:50,878 --> 01:25:53,797
Here's your packets,
get to work.

1008
01:26:27,158 --> 01:26:29,678
Phone man: City..this is Eric.
- Give me Elliott.

1009
01:26:29,678 --> 01:26:32,479
- City.
- Hey, its Will Emerson.

1010
01:26:33,518 --> 01:26:34,799
William, how are you?
- I'm alright, how's the trouble at scribes?

1011
01:26:34,799 --> 01:26:35,798
- Busting my ass, as always.

1012
01:26:36,119 --> 01:26:38,479
- You see, that's what i've been trying to tell you.
John, why do you thing I'm saying this?

1013
01:26:38,479 --> 01:26:39,479
- I know you did.

1014
01:26:39,479 --> 01:26:40,479
What can i do for you?

1015
01:26:40,439 --> 01:26:42,919
- Listen, I just got tapped on my shoulder,

1016
01:26:42,919 --> 01:26:45,399
we've got some words over here
that we need to move.

1017
01:26:45,399 --> 01:26:46,399
So, today. It looks like my lost is your gain.

1018
01:26:45,399 --> 01:26:47,919
- What kind of size you're talking about?

1019
01:26:47,919 --> 01:26:50,399
Should be on your screen,
I just sent it.

1020
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:52,959
- Jesus, what is this gonna land?
- 96 on a dollar.

1021
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:54,999
- 91?
- Whole three and we're done at 94.

1022
01:26:55,519 --> 01:26:57,039
93 and a half?
- Done!

1023
01:26:57,639 --> 01:26:59,880
- This is trading?
- Hello, gorgious.

1024
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,960
- Will, what's happening over there?
- Today's moving day.

1025
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:07,200
- What's the fuck are you guys so worked up about?
- You think they tell me anything, all i know is that

1026
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,920
today my loss is your gain.
Now, you're friendly

1027
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:12,440
So, I'm coming to you first.
I got two seventy mill

1028
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:14,960
a fifteen year paying at a twenty half a part.

1029
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,480
- Where is it from?
- Where is it from? Do you care?

1030
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:19,960
- No, not really. Now...

1031
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:23,440
Where's the trade? I'm hearing that you guys....
- I'm only sharing this with you

1032
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:26,240
right now!

1033
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:28,720
85...
- Done.

1034
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:31,240
- Deutsche?

1035
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:33,721
- Its Will Emerson.

1036
01:27:33,721 --> 01:27:36,201
- Fuck you, you lying bastard.
- Come on, are you still angry about that.

1037
01:27:36,201 --> 01:27:38,560
Word is out, i'm hanging up.

1038
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,080
- Merryll?
- Lawrence.

1039
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,600
- What the fuck are you guys doing over there?

1040
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,521
- Just a little spring cleaning.
- That is not what i'm hearing.

1041
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:49,361
Alright, Lawrence. Are you a buyer?
- I'm not sure anymore. Where at?

1042
01:27:49,881 --> 01:27:51,241
- Why, it sounds like I should be asking 'Where at.'

1043
01:27:51,961 --> 01:27:54,081
375 mill at third year mix.
- Fuck me..

1044
01:27:55,361 --> 01:27:57,842
- Are you with me on this?

1045
01:27:57,842 --> 01:28:00,362
63 cents?
- or fuck you, I'm hanging up.

1046
01:28:00,362 --> 01:28:03,722
63?
- I'll come back to you on five.

1047
01:28:03,722 --> 01:28:04,721
- Maybe, fifty five and five.

1048
01:28:05,681 --> 01:28:07,961
- Well, alright then, stay on the line.

1049
01:28:08,921 --> 01:28:10,241
Sam, pick up the phone.

1050
01:28:10,682 --> 01:28:13,202
Sam...get on the line!

1051
01:28:13,202 --> 01:28:15,682
I got Lawrence in now.
- Where are we?

1052
01:28:15,682 --> 01:28:18,522
- sixty three six.
- Jesus, and what?

1053
01:28:19,282 --> 01:28:20,402
Get him to sixty five and hit it.

1054
01:28:21,482 --> 01:28:22,722
Are you fucking kidding me on this?

1055
01:28:23,522 --> 01:28:26,042
That's a hundred million lost on a single trade.

1056
01:28:26,042 --> 01:28:30,483
I understand...hit it.

1057
01:28:30,762 --> 01:28:32,562
Well, Lawrence. We'd fill a kill at sixty five.

1058
01:28:32,842 --> 01:28:34,362
- It's filled.

1059
01:28:56,003 --> 01:28:56,843
- Well done.

1060
01:29:04,003 --> 01:29:06,844
I just wanna give you heads up.
They're gonna start sending a few people home now.

1061
01:29:11,004 --> 01:29:13,483
Now?
- Yes, I know this ends.

1062
01:30:27,846 --> 01:30:29,006
Please sit.

1063
01:30:29,726 --> 01:30:31,086
Congratulations are clearly in order.

1064
01:30:33,246 --> 01:30:34,486
We did the best we could.

1065
01:30:35,526 --> 01:30:36,486
You did a hell of a job.

1066
01:30:38,126 --> 01:30:39,086
And i thank you for that.
C'mon sit.

1067
01:30:40,046 --> 01:30:41,126
Excuse me for eating, but...

1068
01:30:43,087 --> 01:30:44,407
It's been a long day.

1069
01:30:45,046 --> 01:30:46,646
- Can i get you something?
- No, nothing, Thanks.

1070
01:30:51,766 --> 01:30:53,847
- What can i do for you?
- I want out.

1071
01:30:55,687 --> 01:30:57,087
- I'm done, I want out.

1072
01:31:00,487 --> 01:31:02,887
- It's a very difficult day for all...
- I need you to release my options,

1073
01:31:03,327 --> 01:31:05,647
If they're worth anything today,
I want my bonus, I am out.

1074
01:31:05,927 --> 01:31:06,687
- You'll get your bonus,
your options...

1075
01:31:07,007 --> 01:31:09,527
and keep a calm face. But i need you to stay
with me for next 24 months..

1076
01:31:18,368 --> 01:31:19,768
You did some good today,
you said that yourself.

1077
01:31:20,968 --> 01:31:21,887
You know...

1078
01:31:22,367 --> 01:31:25,288
I'm starting to feel
a little better about all this whole thing.

1079
01:31:26,608 --> 01:31:28,888
You're one of the luckiest guy in the world, Sam.

1080
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:30,648
You could've been digging dicks
all this years.

1081
01:31:33,048 --> 01:31:33,848
That's true.

1082
01:31:33,848 --> 01:31:34,648
- And if i had, at least...

1083
01:31:40,768 --> 01:31:43,968
How the hell did we fuck this up,
quite so much?

1084
01:31:46,888 --> 01:31:50,328
- When did you start feeling so sorry
for yourself..its unbearable.

1085
01:31:51,329 --> 01:31:54,528
- So, you think we might've put a few
people out of business today.

1086
01:31:54,528 --> 01:31:55,529
It's all for note.

1087
01:31:57,329 --> 01:32:01,008
But you've been doing that everyday,
for almost 40 years Sam

1088
01:32:02,809 --> 01:32:05,729
If this is all for note, then so is everything out there.

1089
01:32:09,329 --> 01:32:10,569
Its just money.

1090
01:32:11,169 --> 01:32:12,089
It's made up.

1091
01:32:13,849 --> 01:32:15,610
It's pieces of paper with a picture on it.
So, we don't have to

1092
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:17,650
kill each other, just to get something to eat.

1093
01:32:19,889 --> 01:32:21,169
Its not wrong.

1094
01:32:21,169 --> 01:32:22,169
And it's certainly not different today,
then it's ever been.

1095
01:32:25,609 --> 01:32:30,930
1637, 1797, 1819, 37..57

1096
01:32:31,770 --> 01:32:33,010
84,

1097
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:36,450
1901, 07

1098
01:32:37,130 --> 01:32:40,130
29, 1937..1974

1099
01:32:40,810 --> 01:32:43,050
1987, Jesus!
Didn't that fucker fuck me up good.

1100
01:32:43,810 --> 01:32:46,290
92, 97..2000
and whatever we wanna call this.

1101
01:32:47,051 --> 01:32:49,410
All just for same thing,
over and over..we can't help ourselves.

1102
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:52,170
And we wanna like uh,

1103
01:32:56,131 --> 01:32:59,210
Control it, or stop it or even slow it.
We haven't even since slightly altered.

1104
01:33:00,530 --> 01:33:01,730
We just react.

1105
01:33:03,211 --> 01:33:04,651
We get a lot of money,
if we get it right.

1106
01:33:05,531 --> 01:33:07,131
And we get left by the side of road,
if we get it wrong.

1107
01:33:08,651 --> 01:33:12,011
And there has always been, and always will be..
the same percentage of winners and losers

1108
01:33:12,011 --> 01:33:13,011
happy fucks and sad sacks.

1109
01:33:13,691 --> 01:33:14,811
Fat cats and starving dogs, in this world.

1110
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:21,451
Yeah, then maybe more of us today,
than there ever been...

1111
01:33:22,171 --> 01:33:23,931
but the percentage,

1112
01:33:24,732 --> 01:33:26,371
they stand exactly the same.

1113
01:33:45,012 --> 01:33:47,732
I'll do it John, not but because of the little speech,

1114
01:33:49,452 --> 01:33:50,732
But because I need the money.

1115
01:33:52,132 --> 01:33:57,532
Hard to believe, after all this years..
But I... need the money.

1116
01:34:07,972 --> 01:34:09,052
Are you gonna keep the kid?

1117
01:34:12,053 --> 01:34:13,253
Keep him? He's gonna promote him.

1118
01:34:14,213 --> 01:34:15,693
Its all hands on deck now Sam.

1119
01:34:16,413 --> 01:34:18,933
There's gonna be a lot of money to be made,
coming out of this mess.

1120
01:34:18,933 --> 01:34:21,573
And they're gonna need all the brains,
we can get out on here.

1121
01:36:40,497 --> 01:36:44,058
I went home from the vet
and I couldn't think of where as to go.

1122
01:36:45,698 --> 01:36:46,977
She belongs here.

1123
01:36:48,938 --> 01:36:52,138
I know, but Sam you don't live here anymore.

1124
01:36:56,498 --> 01:37:01,258
Are you alright?
You don't look so good.

1125
01:37:02,858 --> 01:37:04,459
Yeah, it's been a rough day all the way around.

1126
01:37:04,978 --> 01:37:06,298
I know, Sammy called.

1127
01:37:06,298 --> 01:37:07,298
Is he alright?

1128
01:37:08,179 --> 01:37:09,338
They got hammered,

1129
01:37:09,338 --> 01:37:11,738
but got out alive.

1130
01:37:11,738 --> 01:37:12,739
- good.

1131
01:37:19,858 --> 01:37:23,338
Well, I am going to go
back inside

1132
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,979
and go back to bed.

1133
01:37:26,619 --> 01:37:30,019
The alarm is on
so don't try to break in.

1134
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:40,419
Take care of yourself.
