1
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,258
Down!

2
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:31,661
How you doing?

3
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:34,455
Hey, watch out,
Axel.

4
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:37,124
We'll be calling him
old fireballs after tonight.

5
00:04:37,332 --> 00:04:39,628
Really?
Not bad.

6
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:43,632
Hey, Steve, now that
you're going into the Army,

7
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:45,716
how about giving my $20 back?

8
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:55,559
All right, boys.

9
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:56,769
Hey, take care, buddy.

10
00:04:56,852 --> 00:04:58,561
I'll see you, fellows.

11
00:04:58,686 --> 00:04:59,604
Freddy!

12
00:04:59,688 --> 00:05:00,605
Hi, Mike!

13
00:05:00,688 --> 00:05:01,731
Be good.

14
00:05:01,856 --> 00:05:03,274
Did you hear about
the happy Roman?

15
00:05:03,358 --> 00:05:04,734
Yeah?

16
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,986
He was glad he ate her.

17
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:07,320
Come on, let's go.

18
00:05:07,488 --> 00:05:08,655
Where's Stan?
All right.

19
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:09,824
Hey, Stan,
let's go!

20
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,991
Take care of yourself.

21
00:05:11,157 --> 00:05:13,118
Give us a call.
Write us.

22
00:05:13,242 --> 00:05:14,994
Take care. I'll see you later. So long.

23
00:05:15,077 --> 00:05:16,037
Okay, bye-bye.

24
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:17,829
Take care of yourself. Take it easy.

25
00:05:17,955 --> 00:05:19,915
Don't get your ass
shot off.

26
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,251
I won't.
Good luck.

27
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,586
Okay.

28
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:25,379
Hey, Mike, take care of
yourself. Good luck to you.

29
00:05:25,504 --> 00:05:26,630
Stay out of trouble.

30
00:05:26,713 --> 00:05:28,716
Kill a few for me, too.
I will. Stay out of trouble.

31
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:30,216
Hey, little killer.

32
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:31,302
Let's go.

33
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:32,679
Hey!

34
00:05:35,014 --> 00:05:37,223
Hey, Axel, there's Stan.
Hi, Stanley.

35
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:39,100
Hi, Stanley,
you asshole.

36
00:05:39,226 --> 00:05:40,685
Hey, Stan!

37
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:41,728
Get back there.

38
00:05:41,895 --> 00:05:43,813
Stan, it's no use.

39
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:45,398
Come on, Stosh,
you're beautiful now.

40
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,318
You're still
an ugly bastard, Stan.

41
00:05:48,402 --> 00:05:49,904
Good luck to you
in the Army.

42
00:05:49,987 --> 00:05:51,196
Hey, Stanley!

43
00:05:52,405 --> 00:05:53,782
Come on, come on.

44
00:05:54,657 --> 00:05:56,701
Stosh, let's get
the hell out of here.

45
00:05:56,826 --> 00:05:58,287
Come on, Stan. Let's go.

46
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:01,707
Let's go. Come on.

47
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:06,585
Very mature, very mature,
well-adapted individuals.

48
00:06:06,794 --> 00:06:08,421
Take it easy.
Whoa!

49
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,257
Hey, look at that.
Let's go. Come on.

50
00:06:10,381 --> 00:06:11,258
Whoa!

51
00:06:11,382 --> 00:06:12,759
What the hell is that?

52
00:06:12,884 --> 00:06:14,677
Where? Oh, yeah.

53
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,639
Holy shit,
you know what that is?

54
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:20,432
Those are sun dogs.

55
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:21,683
What does
it mean?

56
00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:23,351
It means a blessing
on the hunter,

57
00:06:23,435 --> 00:06:25,355
sent by the Great Wolf
to his children.

58
00:06:25,438 --> 00:06:27,357
What the fuck are you
talking about?

59
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,109
No, it's an old
Indian thing.

60
00:06:29,235 --> 00:06:30,734
You're full of shit.

61
00:06:30,818 --> 00:06:33,695
Stanley, would I shit you
about something like that?

62
00:06:34,948 --> 00:06:36,533
You know, Mike,

63
00:06:36,617 --> 00:06:39,785
there's times when nobody but
a doctor can understand you.

64
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,704
That's an omen,
you know that?

65
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:43,495
You know that we could
have one great

66
00:06:43,621 --> 00:06:45,082
fucking hunting
trip tonight?

67
00:06:45,248 --> 00:06:47,126
Yeah, Mike, I don't know
where the hell

68
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:48,625
you come up
with all this shit.

69
00:06:48,751 --> 00:06:50,587
Hey, wait a minute.

70
00:06:50,712 --> 00:06:52,256
What are you-
What, are you thinking

71
00:06:52,423 --> 00:06:54,341
of going
deer hunting tonight?

72
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:57,176
No, not tonight.
I'm getting married tonight,

73
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:59,637
and you fucking guys are
going deer hunting?

74
00:06:59,762 --> 00:07:02,556
Hey, first we get you legal,
tuck you into bed with Angela.

75
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,640
Hey!

76
00:07:03,765 --> 00:07:04,933
You guys are
all fucking nuts.

77
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:05,976
Are we mad?

78
00:07:06,102 --> 00:07:08,020
Boy, you're all crazy.
Life is over.

79
00:07:08,146 --> 00:07:09,397
Yeah, right.

80
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,440
You're getting married,
we're crazy?

81
00:07:11,523 --> 00:07:12,857
It's all right.

82
00:07:12,982 --> 00:07:14,568
Hey, it's all right.
We'll be right there.

83
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:16,529
We'll be right with you.
All of us, won't we?

84
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:17,822
Right?
Am I right?

85
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:19,574
Fuckin' A, man.
Right.

86
00:07:19,992 --> 00:07:21,158
Come on.

87
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:24,036
Come on, you guys, I'm buying
the first round this morning.

88
00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:25,453
Hey, hey, Steven!
Steven!

89
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,498
Any, uh, help you might need
tonight, just feel free to call on me.

90
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:29,542
Ooh!

91
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:31,793
Hey, Stanley, sometimes your
sense of humor ain't funny.

92
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,087
Come on,
Steven.

93
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,296
Willing fingers.

94
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:35,505
Extra lips.

95
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,050
Fucking A, man.

96
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:40,052
Hey, you're a regular poet,
Axel.

97
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:41,719
I couldn't agree
with you more.

98
00:07:41,844 --> 00:07:42,804
Get in there.

99
00:07:42,887 --> 00:07:43,931
Come on, come on.

100
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:50,353
I do.

101
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:54,107
I do.

102
00:07:57,318 --> 00:07:58,737
I do.

103
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,668
Oh, my God!

104
00:08:25,804 --> 00:08:27,847
I still do not
believe this.

105
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,809
My own boy,
with a strange girl.

106
00:08:31,393 --> 00:08:33,644
And not so thin,
if you understand my meaning.

107
00:08:33,728 --> 00:08:35,521
Not such a thin girl.

108
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:39,109
The next thing you know,
he goes to Vietnam.

109
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,197
I do not understand, Father.

110
00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:49,868
I understand nothing anymore.

111
00:08:50,284 --> 00:08:51,536
Nothing.

112
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:55,706
Why?

113
00:08:56,582 --> 00:08:57,793
Why?

114
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:01,879
Can you explain?

115
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:04,217
Can anyone explain?

116
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:33,203
Pass him on the inside.

117
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:34,454
You'd never do it.

118
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:36,579
Shut the hell up.
I'm trying to concentrate.

119
00:09:36,705 --> 00:09:38,123
It's your Caddy
against my truck.

120
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,166
Today your lucky day?

121
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:40,710
You can't make it.

122
00:09:50,844 --> 00:09:52,095
Oh, boy!

123
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:53,388
You got it!

124
00:09:58,311 --> 00:10:00,271
Hey, Axel,
you opened the window.

125
00:10:00,355 --> 00:10:01,273
Mike!

126
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:02,982
Hey, mighty Mike!

127
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,399
Oh, Axel!

128
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:05,400
Here's your truck back.

129
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:06,485
Oh, hell!

130
00:10:06,611 --> 00:10:08,029
Wouldn't wanna
take advantage of you.

131
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:10,114
I hope you didn't
break an axle. Axle!

132
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:12,532
It's a million-to-one shot
against a sure thing.

133
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:14,451
There's no such thing
as a sure thing.

134
00:10:14,576 --> 00:10:16,118
Did you see that?

135
00:10:16,661 --> 00:10:18,663
Hey, how're you doing?

136
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,125
Don't take
anybody's money.

137
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:24,961
Don't take my money.
Take his money.

138
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:36,471
Give my friends down here
my warm regards.

139
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,521
Hey, I got $100

140
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,567
says the Eagles never cross
the 50 in the next half.

141
00:10:48,693 --> 00:10:50,736
And the Steelers
win by what? 20.

142
00:10:50,861 --> 00:10:52,070
I got an extra
$20 that says

143
00:10:52,196 --> 00:10:53,822
the Eagles' quarterback
wears a dress.

144
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,240
You got it!

145
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:00,120
Take your money off the bar.
Drinks are on the house!

146
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,017
Oh, did I get all wet?

147
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,102
I don't wanna know.

148
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:31,693
Amy!

149
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,613
Come on, Amy.

150
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:46,916
You know what,

151
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,793
Joe, maybe we could use
some more flags.

152
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:54,548
Is that all right?

153
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:55,590
Uh,

154
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,218
up a bit, I would say.
Wouldn't you say so?

155
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,927
No, no, down.

156
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,056
Oh, it's a beautiful cake.

157
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,437
You've earned a drink.

158
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,692
You have
a beautiful cake.

159
00:12:18,027 --> 00:12:20,071
I haven't forgotten
about you.

160
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:23,199
I have one for you, too.

161
00:12:48,473 --> 00:12:51,268
Go to- Fucking hell.

162
00:12:54,188 --> 00:12:57,275
I'll give every car in
the town a flat tire.

163
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:59,192
Every goddamned one.

164
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:00,570
Oh, daddy!

165
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:02,280
I'll do it.

166
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:09,286
I fucking mean what I say, girl. Shh.

167
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:10,788
Come on.

168
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:13,707
All around, like a sea. Oh, my God!

169
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,045
Ocean of flat tires.

170
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:19,672
Fucking...
No.

171
00:13:19,797 --> 00:13:20,797
bitch!

172
00:13:21,756 --> 00:13:23,633
All bitches.

173
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:27,221
I hate them.

174
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:28,305
Daddy.

175
00:13:28,681 --> 00:13:29,681
Daddy, no,
it's me.

176
00:13:29,848 --> 00:13:30,891
Fucking bitches.

177
00:13:32,727 --> 00:13:35,103
Give them all flat tires.

178
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,636
<i>"You're just too good
to be true"</i>

179
00:14:11,305 --> 00:14:12,305
That's great.

180
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:13,639
<i>"I can't take my eyes
off of you"</i>

181
00:14:13,723 --> 00:14:15,517
Now, I'm gonna smoke your ass.

182
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:18,519
<i>"You'd be like heaven
to touch"</i>

183
00:14:18,602 --> 00:14:21,565
<i>"I wanna hold you so much"</i>

184
00:14:22,524 --> 00:14:25,735
<i>"At long last
love has arrived"</i>

185
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,530
<i>"And I thank God I'm alive"</i>

186
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:32,949
It's my shot, right?

187
00:14:34,076 --> 00:14:37,413
Come on, John.
Wipe off the tables.

188
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:40,874
This is it.
This is really it.

189
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:44,628
<i>"There's nothing else
to compare"</i>

190
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:46,381
I mean, here I go.

191
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:51,886
<i>"There are no words
left to speak"</i>

192
00:14:53,763 --> 00:14:56,431
There's no sense
in getting too relaxed, buddy.

193
00:14:56,556 --> 00:14:59,768
<i>"Please let me know
that it's real"</i>

194
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:01,019
Come on.

195
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:03,356
<i>"You're just too good

198
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,504
<i>"And if it's quite
all right"</i>

199
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,506

200
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:32,381

205
00:15:43,602 --> 00:15:46,896

206

208

You faggot.

00:15:54,904 --> 00:15:57,282
<i>"You're just too good

210

211
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,329
Hey!

00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,669
<i>"I wanna hold you so much"</i>

213
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,676
Jesus Christ!

214
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:21,013
To do this to
your own mother,

215
00:16:21,138 --> 00:16:23,391
who prays for you
all her life.

216
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:28,020
Is your heart so cruel,
so unfeeling?

217
00:16:28,103 --> 00:16:31,565
You marry this girl,
you leave her with me,

218
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,484
and you go with these bums
to the Vietnam!

219
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:36,320
Whoa, whoa!

220
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:40,156
One flight.

221
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:42,075
It's one flight upstairs.

222
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,577
When I come home...

223
00:16:43,993 --> 00:16:44,954
One flight!

224
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:47,664
I love Angela.

225
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,502
And she loves me.

226
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,005
Wear a scarf today.

227
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,636
You don't wear
a scarf with a tuxedo.

228
00:17:01,678 --> 00:17:03,681
I'm not gonna wear
a scarf with a tuxedo.

229
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,482
You trying to
look like a prince?

230
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:00,400
What do you mean,
trying?

231
00:18:00,942 --> 00:18:02,737
You should've done that
a long time ago,

232
00:18:02,862 --> 00:18:03,988
that way it would've set.

233
00:18:04,113 --> 00:18:05,072
I know.

234
00:18:06,323 --> 00:18:07,534
Then why didn't you do it?

235
00:18:07,616 --> 00:18:08,867
'Cause I forgot.

236
00:18:10,744 --> 00:18:12,412
Can you still see?

237
00:18:16,582 --> 00:18:19,544
For Christ's sake, Mike. Steven is
getting married in a couple of hours,

238
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,172
I don't know
what the hell we're doing

239
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:23,299
talking about hunting
a last time before the Army.

240
00:18:23,424 --> 00:18:26,092
The whole thing,
it's crazy.

241
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,803
I'll tell you one thing.

242
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,642
If I found out my life had
to end up in the mountains,

243
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:35,101
it'd be all right.

244
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:36,770
But it has to be in your mind.

245
00:18:37,728 --> 00:18:38,770
What?

246
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:42,191
One shot?

247
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,614
Two is pussy.

248
00:18:46,737 --> 00:18:49,157
I don't think about one shot
that much any more, Mike.

249
00:18:49,282 --> 00:18:50,660
You have to think about
one shot.

250
00:18:50,783 --> 00:18:52,075
One shot is what
it's all about.

251
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:53,786
A deer has to be taken
with one shot.

252
00:18:53,911 --> 00:18:56,330
I try to tell people that,
they don't listen.

253
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,337
You really think
about Vietnam?

254
00:19:03,462 --> 00:19:04,462
Yeah.

255
00:19:07,006 --> 00:19:07,923
I don't know.

256
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:10,510
I guess I'm thinking
about the deer.

257
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,095
Going to Nam.

258
00:19:12,763 --> 00:19:15,265
I like the trees, you know?

259
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:17,976
I like the way the trees are
in the mountains,

260
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:19,686
it's all different.

261
00:19:23,938 --> 00:19:25,775
The way the trees are.

262
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,778
I sound like
some asshole, right?

263
00:19:31,696 --> 00:19:34,950
I'll tell you, Nick, you're the
only guy I go hunting with, you know?

264
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,245
I like a guy
with quick moves and speed.

265
00:19:37,371 --> 00:19:39,122
I ain't gonna hunt
with no assholes.

266
00:19:39,206 --> 00:19:40,707
Who's an asshole?

267
00:19:40,874 --> 00:19:42,500
Who do you think's
an asshole?

268
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,000
They're all
a bunch of assholes.

269
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:47,504
I mean, I love them.
They're great guys.

270
00:19:47,629 --> 00:19:50,174
But, you know,
without you, I'd hunt alone.

271
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,217
Seriously,
that's what I'd do.

272
00:19:52,342 --> 00:19:54,053
But you're a fucking nut.

273
00:19:54,178 --> 00:19:55,887
You know that, Mike?
You're a maniac.

274
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:57,430
Control freak.

275
00:19:57,972 --> 00:20:00,141
I just don't like
no surprises.

276
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:05,313
Damn thing won't open.

277
00:20:05,397 --> 00:20:06,606
Well, give it
a kick!

278
00:20:06,732 --> 00:20:09,819
Hey, hey, not like that, not
like that. Here, here, here.

279
00:20:11,735 --> 00:20:12,903
See that?

280
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:14,030
Fuckin' A.

281
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:17,116
Unreal.

282
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:22,748
Axel, now I know why you're not
still kicking for the Steelers.

283
00:20:23,747 --> 00:20:24,706
You know,

284
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:26,625
I love Mike's car.

285
00:20:27,084 --> 00:20:29,377
Yeah, some cars,
they just sit.

286
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,339
I mean, you never know
with a car like this

287
00:20:31,423 --> 00:20:33,091
where the hell
it's gonna take you.

288
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:36,053
It makes me feel safe.

289
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:39,764
Hey!

290
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:46,436
Axel's humping
Mike's Coupe de Ville.

291
00:20:48,772 --> 00:20:50,773
Oh, Axel, get out of there.

292
00:20:50,856 --> 00:20:52,900
Let's get the carnations.
Oh, they're over there.

293
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:54,486
Get up, get up.

294
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:56,780
What are you doing?
Come on, sit up.

295
00:20:56,905 --> 00:20:59,115
Don't pass, Axel!

296
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,284
Here, put this on.
You have to have that on.

297
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:03,119
Crummy tuxedo.

298
00:21:03,243 --> 00:21:05,413
Your tuxedo's been
stuck a million times.

299
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:06,706
Where'd you get this thing?

300
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:07,873
Fucking A.

301
00:21:07,957 --> 00:21:09,083
You're not funny.

302
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,083
I'm beautiful, right?

303
00:21:10,209 --> 00:21:11,918
No, you're not beautiful.

304
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,338
All set.
Thanks, honey.

305
00:21:14,963 --> 00:21:17,006
I'm not...
Let go!

306
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,551
Let go!

307
00:21:22,637 --> 00:21:24,766
You can't even sit up,
Axel! Oh!

308
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:27,518
Axel, come on, sit up.

309
00:21:27,643 --> 00:21:29,394
Beautiful.
Can't even sit up.

310
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,818
Linda, what's the matter?

311
00:21:35,943 --> 00:21:37,318
I was gonna pick you up.

312
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:38,821
Hi.

313
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:40,823
What's the matter?

314
00:21:40,948 --> 00:21:41,949
He hit me.

315
00:21:42,074 --> 00:21:43,115
Don't cry.

316
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,328
Come here,
I want to ask you something.

317
00:21:49,205 --> 00:21:50,665
Hey, wait a minute,
God damn it.

318
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,208
You don't walk away from me.
Nick!

319
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,752
What the hell is that
on your face?

320
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:58,089
Nicky, you and Michael are
going away in a couple of days.

321
00:21:58,173 --> 00:22:01,509
I was just wondering if I
could use this place to stay.

322
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:02,969
Sure.

323
00:22:03,052 --> 00:22:04,345
I want to pay you both.

324
00:22:05,472 --> 00:22:06,598
And I was thinking-

325
00:22:06,681 --> 00:22:08,182
What are you talking about?

326
00:22:12,728 --> 00:22:14,896
I would want to pay you,
Nick.

327
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,152
It's me you're talking to.

328
00:22:19,277 --> 00:22:20,778
How long have you
known me for?

329
00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:25,991
What?

330
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,333
Oh!

331
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:25,232
Have you, Steven,

332
00:24:25,313 --> 00:24:26,899
a free will
and a firm intention

333
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:29,360
to take unto yourself
as wife, this woman, Angela,

334
00:24:29,485 --> 00:24:31,279
whom you see before you?

335
00:24:31,363 --> 00:24:32,447
I do.

336
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:35,533
You have not promised yourself
to any other bride?

337
00:24:36,032 --> 00:24:37,367
I have not.

338
00:24:37,618 --> 00:24:38,618
Have you, Angela,

339
00:24:38,785 --> 00:24:40,412
a free will and
a firm intention,

340
00:24:40,495 --> 00:24:43,206
to take unto yourself
as husband this man, Steven,

341
00:24:43,331 --> 00:24:45,042
whom you see before you?

342
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,168
I have.

343
00:24:46,294 --> 00:24:48,961
You have not promised yourself
to any other man?

344
00:24:49,045 --> 00:24:50,339
I have not.

345
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,219
Blessed is the kingdom

346
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:58,472
of the Father and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.

347
00:24:58,848 --> 00:25:03,142
Now and ever
and unto ages of ages.

348
00:25:03,767 --> 00:25:08,523
Amen.

349
00:28:18,707 --> 00:28:19,873
Whoo-hoo.

350
00:31:24,969 --> 00:31:26,180
Hey!

351
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:39,609
For a buck,
you get a shooter, a cigar,

352
00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:42,028
and a dance with
the beautiful bride.

353
00:31:43,112 --> 00:31:44,446
Fuckin' A.

354
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:45,614
Hey, you.

355
00:31:46,115 --> 00:31:47,742
And you're on your way.

356
00:33:01,606 --> 00:33:04,108
<i>May I have your attention,
please, ladies and gentlemen?</i>

357

363
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,588
<i>It's blocking the driveway.</i>

364

You're so sweet.

Dance, dance.

382

One minute...

383

You nut, you want me to dance?
You want me to dance?

384

You're okay.

Okay. Sure.

a chaser on the side.

It's okay.
It's a wedding, you know.

You really like
Nick a lot, huh?

What do you mean,
it's only a wedding?

464

Look, he did it again,
he just did it.

465

C'mon, I gotta go get
my gun out of my coat.

466

Go get your gun,

Whoa, whoa.

468

Time out. Time out.

469

You hurt me,
you son of a bitch.

470

You punched me right here.

471

I'm gonna put him
on his fucking ass.

472

Why? What happened?

474
00:41:58,457 --> 00:41:59,917
Stan is crazy.

475

Don't cause
any kind of problem.

No, I'm just

I'm the best man.

490
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:43,876
We're going Airborne,
sir.

491
00:42:44,002 --> 00:42:46,212
I hope they send us
where the bullets are flying

492
00:42:46,337 --> 00:42:47,796
where the fighting's
the worst, huh?

493
00:42:47,921 --> 00:42:49,257
That's right.

494
00:42:50,049 --> 00:42:51,217
Fuck it.

495
00:42:52,759 --> 00:42:54,928
Fuck it?
What did he say?

496
00:42:55,053 --> 00:42:55,930
"Fuck it."
"Fuck it."

497
00:42:56,055 --> 00:42:57,472
That's what I thought.

498
00:43:00,018 --> 00:43:01,894
Well,
what's it like over there?

499
00:43:02,061 --> 00:43:03,687
Can you tell us anything?

500
00:43:05,397 --> 00:43:06,565
Fuck it.

501
00:43:08,525 --> 00:43:09,985
Okay. Fuck it.

502
00:43:11,612 --> 00:43:12,863
Fuck him.

503
00:43:18,286 --> 00:43:20,202
Fuck it!

504
00:43:20,745 --> 00:43:21,954
Mike!

505
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,790
Hey, hey,
fuck who?

506
00:43:27,043 --> 00:43:28,002
Fuck who?

507
00:43:30,464 --> 00:43:31,591
Who the hell is he?

508
00:43:31,758 --> 00:43:32,883
Who the fuck knows?

509
00:43:33,008 --> 00:43:34,926
He looks like
a fucking hillbilly.

510
00:43:35,093 --> 00:43:37,846
Give him another drink,
Jerry, just the same.

511
00:43:37,929 --> 00:43:39,473
Hey, fuck it.

512
00:45:14,731 --> 00:45:15,857
I caught it.

513
00:45:22,405 --> 00:45:24,074
Will you marry me?

514
00:45:26,075 --> 00:45:27,160
Yeah.

515
00:45:28,911 --> 00:45:30,204
You would?

516
00:45:30,704 --> 00:45:31,913
Mmm-hmm.

517
00:45:33,207 --> 00:45:35,542
What I mean is,
if we get back from...

518
00:45:37,085 --> 00:45:38,671
When we get back.

519
00:45:40,213 --> 00:45:42,007
I don't know
what the hell I mean.

520
00:45:42,174 --> 00:45:45,093
What goes through your mind
comes out of your mouth.

521
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,303
<i>Angela and Steven!</i>

522
00:45:50,473 --> 00:45:52,265
<i>If you don't spill a drop</i>

523
00:45:52,391 --> 00:45:55,186
<i>it's good luck for
the rest of your life.</i>

524
00:48:02,894 --> 00:48:04,769
Come on.
Come on!

525
00:48:13,153 --> 00:48:14,737
Hey!

526
00:48:19,033 --> 00:48:20,744
Don't worry about
what Stan says.

527
00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:22,538
Just forget that.
Forget what Stan says.

528
00:48:22,663 --> 00:48:24,497
He's got a big
fucking mouth.

529
00:48:25,831 --> 00:48:27,626
That's enough. Come here. Hey!

530
00:48:27,751 --> 00:48:28,793
Give me a crack.

531
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,463
I never really did it
with Angela, Nicky.

532
00:48:35,258 --> 00:48:37,009
Great,
that's great.

533
00:48:39,052 --> 00:48:41,221
That's my last
one true secret.

534
00:48:41,638 --> 00:48:44,225
It's nothing, it's nothing,
just forget about it.

535
00:48:45,018 --> 00:48:46,685
Angela!

536
00:48:50,647 --> 00:48:51,856
Oh, Angela!

537
00:48:52,149 --> 00:48:53,859
What am I gonna do
when she has a baby?

538
00:48:53,943 --> 00:48:55,069
That's Angela's part,
right?

539
00:48:55,236 --> 00:48:57,321
Leave all that to her.
Just hang loose.

540
00:48:57,404 --> 00:48:58,530
Hang loose?
Hang loose.

541
00:48:58,655 --> 00:49:00,407
What are you so worried about?
Be happy.

542
00:49:00,532 --> 00:49:01,575
Get out of here.

543
00:49:01,742 --> 00:49:02,992
We don't wanna see you
anymore.

544
00:49:03,117 --> 00:49:04,536
Look at this maniac.

545
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:08,415
See you Monday
on the train.

546
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:10,209
Hey!

547
00:49:12,043 --> 00:49:13,211
Drive careful.

548
00:49:13,294 --> 00:49:15,381
You didn't know
that about Angela, huh?

549
00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:17,423
Right?
That's bullshit, man.

550
00:49:17,548 --> 00:49:18,799
Bullshit?
Bullshit.

551
00:49:18,925 --> 00:49:20,425
Yeah? I happen
to know it's true.

552
00:49:20,551 --> 00:49:22,385
That's bullshit.
I happen to know it's true.

553
00:49:22,468 --> 00:49:23,554
You're full of bullshit.

554
00:49:23,678 --> 00:49:25,055
All right, you want to bet?
Yeah.

555
00:49:25,139 --> 00:49:26,890
Go, put your money
where your mouth is.

556
00:49:27,016 --> 00:49:28,767
Go fuck yourself.
Go fuck yourself.

557
00:49:28,891 --> 00:49:30,310
Eh, grow up.

558
00:49:35,398 --> 00:49:37,068
All right!

559
00:49:50,705 --> 00:49:52,916
Michael, what are you doing?

560
00:49:53,333 --> 00:49:54,584
Hey, Mike!

561
00:49:54,793 --> 00:49:56,418
Michael!

562
00:49:57,295 --> 00:49:59,964
Michael, what the hell
are you doing?

563
00:50:00,714 --> 00:50:02,092
Michael!

564
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:06,346
Michael,
what the hell are you doing?

565
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:07,598
Michael!

566
00:50:10,182 --> 00:50:11,350
Fuck it!

567
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:13,060
Michael, come back here.

568
00:50:13,478 --> 00:50:16,230
What the hell is he doing?

569
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:18,566
Michael,
what the hell are you doing?

570
00:50:18,734 --> 00:50:21,569
Michael, come back here,
Michael!

571
00:50:21,943 --> 00:50:25,113
Michael, we love you.
Get back here!

572
00:50:25,988 --> 00:50:27,448
I gotta talk to you!

573
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:39,462
Mike!

574
00:50:47,761 --> 00:50:48,677
Hey!

575
00:51:14,827 --> 00:51:15,828
Shit!

576
00:51:18,706 --> 00:51:21,084
I must be out of
my fucking mind.

577
00:51:21,335 --> 00:51:22,920
I must be out of
my mind.

578
00:51:28,675 --> 00:51:31,135
I don't know,
everything's going so fast.

579
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:32,888
Man, oh, man!

580
00:51:35,348 --> 00:51:36,391
Hey, Nick.

581
00:51:38,436 --> 00:51:40,395
You think we'll ever
come back?

582
00:51:40,771 --> 00:51:41,687
From Nam?

583
00:51:41,812 --> 00:51:42,730
Yeah.

584
00:51:46,734 --> 00:51:48,195
You know something?

585
00:51:48,862 --> 00:51:50,197
The whole thing,

586
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,116
it's right here.

587
00:51:54,076 --> 00:51:55,867
I love
this fucking place.

588
00:51:55,992 --> 00:51:59,664
I know that sounds crazy,
but if anything happens, Mike,

589
00:52:00,247 --> 00:52:02,208
don't leave-
don't leave me over there.

590
00:52:02,332 --> 00:52:03,710
You got-you gotta...

591
00:52:03,919 --> 00:52:05,128
Just don't leave me.

592
00:52:05,252 --> 00:52:06,629
You gotta promise me that,
Mike.

593
00:52:06,796 --> 00:52:07,754
Hey!

594
00:52:09,214 --> 00:52:14,052
No, man, you got-you gotta-
you gotta promise. Definitely.

595
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:16,888
Hey, Nicky.
Huh?

596
00:52:16,972 --> 00:52:18,390
You got it, pal.

597
00:53:03,808 --> 00:53:05,601
<i>"Geronimo!"</i>

598

Don't push.

612
00:53:58,027 --> 00:53:59,445
Fucking cold.

613
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:04,451
36 beers.

614
00:54:04,702 --> 00:54:05,662
Oh!

615
00:54:05,745 --> 00:54:06,661
What?

616
00:54:06,745 --> 00:54:07,663
Come on.

617
00:54:08,288 --> 00:54:11,166
All right, I'll go already.
Wait, wait.

618
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:20,549
Did you ever piss and take a
drink of beer at the same time?

619
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:26,013
Oh!

620
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,020
I just barely got
a chance to shake it off.

621
00:54:32,104 --> 00:54:33,395
Wait! Come on!

622
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:34,813
Fuck.

623
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:38,983

Sons of bitches!

625

You guys
going my way?

626
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:21,651
Come on.

627
00:55:27,823 --> 00:55:28,781
Fuck!

628
00:55:33,245 --> 00:55:34,871
That's not funny!

629
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:56,393
Don't fuck
around, now.

630
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:00,022
Come on.
Don't fuck around.

631
00:56:00,146 --> 00:56:01,481
Don't fuck around.

632
00:56:03,649 --> 00:56:04,942
Don't fuck around.

633
00:56:32,884 --> 00:56:33,803
Let me out!

634
00:56:33,927 --> 00:56:35,304
Out, out.
Let me out.

635
00:56:35,429 --> 00:56:36,430
Get out.

636
00:56:40,978 --> 00:56:42,313
This is not it!

637
00:56:42,437 --> 00:56:43,980
Definitely.
This is not it.

638
00:56:44,105 --> 00:56:45,314
They changed it.
No kidding.

639
00:56:45,397 --> 00:56:47,232
Somehow,
they changed it.

640
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:49,318
Like this happens
every goddamm year.

641
00:56:49,443 --> 00:56:51,487
You're full of shit,
Stanley.

642
00:56:51,654 --> 00:56:53,030
Who did you say
was full of shit?

643
00:56:53,155 --> 00:56:55,492
You're full of shit,
you're always full of shit.

644
00:56:56,617 --> 00:56:57,827
I'm starving.

645
00:56:57,952 --> 00:56:59,161
Eat that.

646
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:01,163
Nicky, let me
ask you a question.

647
00:57:01,246 --> 00:57:02,580
How come I never
see you eating?

648
00:57:02,705 --> 00:57:05,167
I like to starve myself.
Keeps the fear up.

649
00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:07,211
It ain't natural.

650
00:57:07,336 --> 00:57:08,671
Come on, John.

651
00:57:08,796 --> 00:57:09,797
Hey, it's mine.

652
00:57:09,921 --> 00:57:11,132
You really
want it that bad?

653
00:57:11,215 --> 00:57:12,507
You're goddamn right!

654
00:57:12,716 --> 00:57:14,301
Hey, give me a Twinkie,
Mike.

655
00:57:14,383 --> 00:57:17,846
What are you guys,
a bunch of cripples? Here.

656
00:57:24,562 --> 00:57:25,645
That's mustard.

657
00:57:25,769 --> 00:57:26,687
What?

658
00:57:28,147 --> 00:57:30,232
He put mustard
on his Twinkie.

659
00:57:31,483 --> 00:57:34,030
You're talking like
a goddamn traffic cop.

660
00:57:34,155 --> 00:57:35,489
Incredible.

661
00:57:35,906 --> 00:57:38,034
Come on, give me a beer,
Mike. Come on.

662
00:57:38,241 --> 00:57:39,992
I can't believe you guys.

663
00:57:40,076 --> 00:57:41,619
What the hell am
I doing with you?

664
00:57:41,744 --> 00:57:43,163
This is not it.

665
00:57:43,247 --> 00:57:45,707
They changed it,
somehow they changed it.

666
00:57:46,916 --> 00:57:49,002
You couldn't find your own ass
with two hands.

667
00:57:49,084 --> 00:57:50,085
Fuckin' A.

668
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:51,212
Hey, you know.

669
00:57:51,337 --> 00:57:54,048
We forgot to toast
Steven and Angela.

670
00:57:55,715 --> 00:57:57,008
Steven and Angela!

671
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:04,559
What?

672
00:58:08,937 --> 00:58:11,231
Don't make me laugh when
I have things in my mouth.

673
00:58:11,313 --> 00:58:13,065
I can't take you guys
anywhere.

674
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:14,359
What the hell are you doing?

675
00:58:14,442 --> 00:58:16,111
Take your hands off
the fucking bread.

676
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,362
You can dress him up,

677
00:58:17,487 --> 00:58:19,488
but you can't take
him anywhere.

678
00:58:19,614 --> 00:58:21,616
Come on! Come on!
What the fuck are you doing?

679
00:58:21,741 --> 00:58:23,701
That was mine,
you assholes.

680
00:58:28,915 --> 00:58:31,250
Fucking assholes.
I can't fucking...

681
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:34,627
Fuckin' A!

682
00:58:34,794 --> 00:58:36,005
You know, Axel,

683
00:58:36,088 --> 00:58:37,922
you got a really terrific
vocabulary.

684
00:58:38,006 --> 00:58:39,174
Fuckin' A.

685
00:58:39,257 --> 00:58:40,551
Hey, watch the gear.

686
00:58:40,635 --> 00:58:41,886
Watch the rifle.

687
00:58:42,344 --> 00:58:43,721
Give me my bag.

688
00:58:46,306 --> 00:58:48,017
It's getting cold.
Huh?

689
00:58:49,476 --> 00:58:52,063
Hey, Mike, you got
any extra thermal socks?

690
00:58:55,649 --> 00:58:56,817
Fuckin' A.

691
00:58:58,652 --> 00:58:59,653
Hey, Mike!

692
00:59:00,444 --> 00:59:02,656
You got any
extra thermal socks?

693
00:59:03,991 --> 00:59:05,867
Never mind,
I got them.

694
00:59:07,077 --> 00:59:08,996
Where the hell's my boots?

695
00:59:11,664 --> 00:59:13,415
Anybody see my boots?

696
00:59:14,667 --> 00:59:16,293
Somebody took my boots.

697
00:59:16,501 --> 00:59:18,130
I bought them special.

698
00:59:19,631 --> 00:59:20,590
All right.

699
00:59:20,716 --> 00:59:23,510
All right, you guys, whoever
took my boots, I want them back.

700
00:59:23,636 --> 00:59:25,095
I got a boot for you, Stan.

701
00:59:25,178 --> 00:59:27,012
Right up your ass.

702
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:29,640
Hey, Mike.

703
00:59:32,686 --> 00:59:34,521
Hey, Mike, let me borrow
your spares, huh?

704
00:59:34,687 --> 00:59:35,730
Your extra pair?

705
00:59:35,856 --> 00:59:37,022
No, Stan.

706
00:59:38,398 --> 00:59:39,399
No?

707
00:59:41,735 --> 00:59:43,069
What do you mean, "no?"

708
00:59:43,153 --> 00:59:45,114
Just what I said, no.
"No" means no.

709
00:59:47,157 --> 00:59:49,743
Some fucking friend, you're some
fucking friend, you know that?

710
00:59:49,869 --> 00:59:50,910
You got to learn, Stanley.

711
00:59:51,035 --> 00:59:53,747
Every time you come up here you
got your goddamn head up your ass.

712
00:59:53,871 --> 00:59:55,831
Maybe he likes
the view from up there, huh?

713
01:00:01,129 --> 01:00:03,131
Every time he comes up,
he's got no knife,

714
01:00:03,214 --> 01:00:06,508
he's got no jacket, he's got
no pants, he's got no boots.

715
01:00:06,633 --> 01:00:10,263
All he's got is that stupid gun
he carries around like John Wayne.

716
01:00:10,388 --> 01:00:11,848
That ain't gonna help you.

717
01:00:11,973 --> 01:00:14,684
Oh, what the hell, Mike.
Give him the boots.

718
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:16,686
No way.
I ain't giving him no boots.

719
01:00:16,812 --> 01:00:18,519
No more, no more,
that's it.

720
01:00:19,437 --> 01:00:22,482
You're a fucking bastard,
you know that?

721
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,193
Stanley, you see this?

722
01:00:24,276 --> 01:00:26,320
This is this,
this ain't something else.

723
01:00:26,404 --> 01:00:28,239
This is this.

724
01:00:28,364 --> 01:00:30,615
From now on,
you're on your own.

725
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:36,872
I fixed you up
a million times.

726
01:00:36,997 --> 01:00:39,208
I fixed him up
a million times.

727
01:00:39,708 --> 01:00:42,503
I don't know now many times I
must have fixed him up with girls,

728
01:00:42,628 --> 01:00:44,588
and nothing ever happens.
Zero.

729
01:00:44,753 --> 01:00:46,422
Hey, you know your trouble,
Mike, huh?

730
01:00:46,547 --> 01:00:48,592
Nobody ever knows what the
fuck you're talking about.

731
01:00:48,758 --> 01:00:49,927
Huh? "This is this."

732
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:52,596
What the hell's that supposed
to mean? "This is this."

733
01:00:52,721 --> 01:00:55,390
I mean, is that some faggot-sounding
bullshit, or is that some-

734
01:00:55,515 --> 01:00:57,349
Shut up, Stan, will you?

735
01:00:57,432 --> 01:00:58,809
Hey, man,
you're out of line.

736
01:00:58,934 --> 01:01:00,643
Watch out
with that gun, Stan.

737
01:01:00,768 --> 01:01:01,852
Do you know what I think?

738
01:01:01,978 --> 01:01:02,938
You know what I think?

739
01:01:03,063 --> 01:01:05,442
There's times I swear, I
think you're a fucking faggot.

740
01:01:05,567 --> 01:01:07,234
Hey, come on, you guys.

741
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,070
Last week, last week
he could've had that

742
01:01:09,196 --> 01:01:11,031
new red-headed waitress
at the Bowladrome.

743
01:01:11,112 --> 01:01:12,447
He could've had it knocked.

744
01:01:12,572 --> 01:01:14,617
Look what he fucking did?
Nothing.

745
01:01:14,784 --> 01:01:15,869
That's what.

746
01:01:15,994 --> 01:01:18,704
Shut up, Stan!
Just shut up.

747
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:20,039
Just shut up.

748
01:01:20,164 --> 01:01:23,040
Take-Take Michael's
goddamn boots and shut up!

749
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,959
Otherwise,
I'm goin' home.

750
01:01:25,085 --> 01:01:26,795
Okay,
I'm going home right now.

751
01:01:26,921 --> 01:01:28,254
Get off my stuff.

752
01:01:28,379 --> 01:01:29,882
What the hell are you
doing in there?

753
01:01:32,801 --> 01:01:34,261
Hey, Stosh,

754
01:01:35,429 --> 01:01:36,679
I said no.

755
01:01:42,184 --> 01:01:43,977
What, are you gonna
shoot me?

756
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:45,270
Huh?

757
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:46,773
Here.

758
01:02:08,001 --> 01:02:09,794
What's the matter with you?

759
01:02:11,296 --> 01:02:12,423
Stan.

760
01:05:25,149 --> 01:05:27,234
Watch it, Mike! Watch it.

761
01:05:33,325 --> 01:05:34,825
Hey, Steven!

762
01:05:35,076 --> 01:05:37,161
Hey, Angela,
I got a big gun!

763
01:05:41,499 --> 01:05:44,044
Go home! Go home!

Think of something else.

796
01:13:49,762 --> 01:13:52,433
Control yourself.
Think of something else.

797
01:13:59,147 --> 01:14:00,814
We don't belong here.

798
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:22,379

It's gonna be okay.

Just take it easy.
Take it easy.

It's okay,
it's okay.

Shake it off. Shake it out.
Shake it out.

813
01:16:04,561 --> 01:16:06,771
Think of something else.
Think of home.

They're gonna have
to kill my ass, Mike.

817
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:02,574
Stevie, you gotta do it.
If you don't do it,

818
01:17:02,658 --> 01:17:04,784
they're gonna
throw you in the pit.

819
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,371
They throw you in the pit,
you're gonna die.

820
01:17:07,496 --> 01:17:09,707
Go ahead, you gotta do it.
You can do it.

821
01:17:10,165 --> 01:17:11,750
You can do it, Stevie.

822
01:17:18,548 --> 01:17:22,385
Look in my eyes. Stevie.
Stevie, look at me!

823
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:23,469
Mike?

824
01:17:23,595 --> 01:17:25,138
Do it! Do it!

825
01:17:25,263 --> 01:17:28,309
Go ahead! Show them you got
balls. Show 'em you got balls.

826
01:17:28,432 --> 01:17:30,184
Fuck you.

827
01:17:31,644 --> 01:17:32,686
Go ahead!

828
01:17:32,812 --> 01:17:34,563
Shoot me.
Go ahead.

829
01:17:36,315 --> 01:17:37,524
Come on.

830
01:17:43,363 --> 01:17:44,364
Go ahead.

831
01:17:44,489 --> 01:17:47,492
Go ahead, Stevie! Go ahead.
Show them you got balls!

832
01:17:47,617 --> 01:17:48,578
Go ahead!

833
01:18:03,132 --> 01:18:04,384
Hey, kid.

834
01:18:06,387 --> 01:18:09,012
Kid. Look at me,
Stevie, you did it.

835
01:18:13,684 --> 01:18:15,813
Stevie,
you showed these bastards.

836
01:18:16,354 --> 01:18:18,064
You showed 'em.

837
01:18:30,409 --> 01:18:31,787
Don't worry, kid.

838
01:18:34,164 --> 01:18:35,330
You did it.

839
01:18:51,806 --> 01:18:53,057
Michael!

840
01:18:54,516 --> 01:18:55,517
Michael!

841
01:18:55,601 --> 01:18:56,643
Stevie!

842
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:06,152
Michael.

843
01:19:06,694 --> 01:19:08,112
Michael.

844
01:19:14,576 --> 01:19:15,577
Stevie!

845
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:17,037
Stevie, don't worry.

846
01:19:19,789 --> 01:19:21,416
Mike, help!

847
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:25,880
Oh, God!
There's rats in here!

848
01:19:46,566 --> 01:19:47,817
Nicky.

849
01:19:56,743 --> 01:19:58,202
Motherfucker!

850
01:19:58,327 --> 01:20:00,455
Motherfucker!

851
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,332
Nicky, listen.

852
01:20:07,837 --> 01:20:10,965
It's up to us now.
It's me and you.

853
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:13,677
What about Steven?

854
01:20:13,926 --> 01:20:15,011
Forget him.

855
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:16,220
Forget him?

856
01:20:16,345 --> 01:20:18,473
Forget him.
He ain't gonna make it.

857
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:21,391
Who do you think you are?
God?

858
01:20:24,102 --> 01:20:25,978
Look at him, he's in a daze.

859
01:20:27,357 --> 01:20:29,608
He ain't coming out,
he's in a dream.

860
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:30,984
Mike,
what are you saying?

861
01:20:31,068 --> 01:20:32,362
I'm saying forget him, Nick.

862
01:20:32,445 --> 01:20:34,862
Get it through your head, or
you and me are both gone, too.

863
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:46,082
Gotta play with
more bullets.

864
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:47,207
What?

865
01:20:47,332 --> 01:20:48,709
More bullets.

866
01:20:50,877 --> 01:20:53,172
I gotta get more
bullets in the gun.

867
01:20:54,633 --> 01:20:55,592
What?

868
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:57,176
We got to play
with more bullets.

869
01:20:57,301 --> 01:20:59,179
More bullets in the gun?

870
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:01,097
How many more bullets?

871
01:21:02,223 --> 01:21:03,140
Three.

872
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,818
That means we've got
to play each other.

873
01:21:15,234 --> 01:21:16,569
More bullets
against each other?

874
01:21:16,736 --> 01:21:17,778
What, are you crazy?

875
01:21:17,904 --> 01:21:19,781
Nicky, it's the only way.

876
01:21:23,369 --> 01:21:25,203
I'll pick the moment.

877
01:21:25,287 --> 01:21:27,037
The game goes until I move.

878
01:21:27,121 --> 01:21:29,623
When I start shooting,
you go for the nearest guard

879
01:21:29,749 --> 01:21:31,585
you get his gun
and zap the fucker.

880
01:21:31,668 --> 01:21:33,461
I'm not ready for this.

881
01:21:33,586 --> 01:21:35,212
You gotta listen to me.

882
01:21:35,337 --> 01:21:36,966
You want to stay down here
and die?

883
01:21:38,549 --> 01:21:39,551
Go.

884
01:21:39,634 --> 01:21:42,220
It's up to you.
Now, it's up to you.

885
01:21:42,303 --> 01:21:43,388
No!

886
01:21:43,513 --> 01:21:45,723
Hey, him against me!

887
01:21:45,806 --> 01:21:46,766
Side by side.

888
01:21:49,101 --> 01:21:51,562
Get away! Get away!

889
01:21:51,688 --> 01:21:53,229
Side by side.

890
01:21:53,396 --> 01:21:54,815
Man, I can't wait!

891
01:21:55,648 --> 01:21:56,901
Michael!

892
01:21:58,777 --> 01:21:59,694
Michael!

893
01:22:38,482 --> 01:22:39,651
Come on!

894
01:22:39,775 --> 01:22:43,236
These fuckers, these fuckers.
Go ahead, Nicky. Go ahead, Nicky.

895
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:45,616
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

896
01:22:45,699 --> 01:22:48,367
Go ahead, Nicky. Go ahead,
Nicky. That's it. That's it.

897
01:23:04,215 --> 01:23:07,678
I do three bullets.
Three, three.

898
01:23:07,803 --> 01:23:10,681
We do three, huh?
One, two, three. Three.

899
01:23:21,607 --> 01:23:23,192
Three, three.

900
01:23:29,073 --> 01:23:31,658
Three, three.

901
01:23:33,994 --> 01:23:35,913
Don't worry, Nick.
Don't worry.

902
01:23:36,037 --> 01:23:38,208
In five minutes,
we're gonna be out of here.

903
01:23:38,333 --> 01:23:39,374
We're gonna be out of here.

904
01:23:50,886 --> 01:23:54,138
Now we got ourselves a game.
You and me. You and me.

905
01:24:16,954 --> 01:24:20,164
Okay. Okay, you want a game?

906
01:24:37,179 --> 01:24:38,221
Go ahead.

907
01:24:38,347 --> 01:24:39,348
No more.

908
01:24:39,474 --> 01:24:40,808
No, no more.

909
01:24:44,354 --> 01:24:45,521
That's fucked.

910
01:24:45,603 --> 01:24:47,523
I'm gonna will us
outta here.

911
01:24:47,606 --> 01:24:49,734
You've got an empty
chamber in that gun.

912
01:24:49,858 --> 01:24:52,321
Put an empty chamber
in that gun. Go ahead.

913
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:02,079
God damn it!

914
01:25:02,204 --> 01:25:03,580
It's gonna be all right,
Nicky.

915
01:25:03,663 --> 01:25:06,124
Go ahead, shoot!
Shoot, Nicky!

916
01:25:08,628 --> 01:25:10,128
You motherfucker!

917
01:25:12,631 --> 01:25:14,049
No, no, no, Nicky!

918
01:25:18,221 --> 01:25:20,473
Now you're gonna die,
you motherfucker!

919
01:25:20,597 --> 01:25:22,600
You're gonna die!

920
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:26,394
Go ahead, go ahead, Nicky,
just do it.

921
01:25:26,936 --> 01:25:28,689
Do it, do it, do it.

922
01:25:28,814 --> 01:25:30,148
Go ahead.

923
01:25:36,989 --> 01:25:38,323
You made it.

924
01:25:43,827 --> 01:25:45,331
It's all right.

925
01:25:45,456 --> 01:25:47,248
All right,
we're gonna show them.

926
01:25:57,343 --> 01:25:58,385
All right.

927
01:26:00,011 --> 01:26:00,886
All right.

928
01:26:21,614 --> 01:26:22,532
Yeah.

929
01:26:39,550 --> 01:26:41,175
Come on, come on.

930
01:26:42,344 --> 01:26:43,303
Come on.

931
01:26:43,885 --> 01:26:44,845
Nicky.

932
01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:47,597
Nicky.

933
01:26:48,224 --> 01:26:50,226
Come on, damn it!
Come on.

934
01:26:56,231 --> 01:26:57,607
Oh, shit.

935
01:27:00,778 --> 01:27:02,237
Get me up.

936
01:27:04,949 --> 01:27:06,159
Steve!

937
01:27:11,704 --> 01:27:13,873
Get on it. Get on it.

938
01:27:18,086 --> 01:27:20,047
Michael, Michael.

939
01:27:22,091 --> 01:27:23,300
Michael!

940
01:27:28,553 --> 01:27:30,055
Stevie, come on.

941
01:27:30,181 --> 01:27:33,268
Come on, Stevie. We're gonna
go for a swim. Come on, Stevie.

942
01:27:33,852 --> 01:27:35,937
Come on, come on.

943
01:27:39,565 --> 01:27:42,026
We don't belong here
in the jungle, Michael.

944
01:27:45,947 --> 01:27:48,698
Just get on, see?
Just get on.

945
01:27:48,823 --> 01:27:50,950
There's rats
in these waters.

946
01:27:53,662 --> 01:27:56,080
Hold on, right there.

947
01:27:56,999 --> 01:27:58,125
Hold on.

948
01:28:14,682 --> 01:28:15,725
Michael.

949
01:28:15,808 --> 01:28:16,515
Okay, buddy.

950
01:28:22,981 --> 01:28:24,067
Mike.

951
01:28:30,614 --> 01:28:31,740
Nicky.

952
01:28:56,597 --> 01:28:59,976
Mike, I want to go home, Mike.

953
01:30:03,954 --> 01:30:05,413
What is that?

954
01:30:07,248 --> 01:30:09,294
What's that sound, Michael?

955
01:30:22,263 --> 01:30:23,848
Hey! Hey! Hey!

956
01:31:35,919 --> 01:31:37,419
Go on! Go on!

957
01:31:37,502 --> 01:31:41,380
Mike! Mike!
Hold on, Michael.

958
01:31:45,178 --> 01:31:46,512
Mike!

959
01:32:32,306 --> 01:32:33,223
Steve!

960
01:32:57,414 --> 01:33:01,210
I hit some rocks, Michael.
I hit some rocks.

961
01:33:01,627 --> 01:33:03,212
On my legs, Michael.

962
01:33:03,378 --> 01:33:05,923
Okay. Relax.

963
01:33:08,591 --> 01:33:10,509
Come on, come on.

964
01:33:11,468 --> 01:33:14,222
Stevie, come on.

965
01:33:14,347 --> 01:33:16,057
Come on, Stevie.

966
01:33:16,141 --> 01:33:17,559
Please.

967
01:33:21,395 --> 01:33:22,563
My legs.

968
01:33:23,021 --> 01:33:24,356
I hit some rocks.

969
01:33:26,190 --> 01:33:27,358
Okay. All right.

970
01:33:35,617 --> 01:33:36,618
That's it.

971
01:33:36,742 --> 01:33:37,910
My arm.

972
01:33:39,621 --> 01:33:40,707
Okay.

973
01:33:40,790 --> 01:33:42,792
I can't feel my legs.

974
01:33:44,085 --> 01:33:46,879
All right, all right,
come on.

975
01:33:49,463 --> 01:33:50,756
My arm.

976
01:33:55,886 --> 01:33:57,389
Push yourself.

977
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:07,398
Whoa.

978
01:34:14,154 --> 01:34:16,657
Oh, man.

979
01:34:16,782 --> 01:34:20,327
Okay, kid, okay, shh, shh.

980
01:35:37,986 --> 01:35:39,237
Take him.

981
01:35:40,154 --> 01:35:41,280
Take him.

982
01:35:50,999 --> 01:35:52,416
Not me, him.

983
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:09,508
Are you Nikanor Chevotarevich?

984
01:38:12,385 --> 01:38:14,345
Can you understand me,

Yes.

Uh-huh, Chevotarevich.
Is that a Russian name?

988
01:38:29,902 --> 01:38:31,821
No. It's American.

989
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:35,407
All right,
let me see your name tag.

990
01:38:37,493 --> 01:38:38,702
Is this yours?

991
01:38:40,370 --> 01:38:41,537
It's his.

992
01:38:41,996 --> 01:38:43,956
What are your
parents' names?

993

Lou.

994

And what are your
parents' dates of birth?

997
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:46,767
We're gonna have
to get him out of here.

998

Sure, sure, sure.

1000
01:40:20,718 --> 01:40:22,010
Excuse me.

1001

1002
01:40:28,349 --> 01:40:29,475
Hello.

1013

I'll give you a call

01:57:16,157 --> 01:57:17,158
No.

1149
01:57:18,618 --> 01:57:19,578
No.

1150
01:57:28,001 --> 01:57:29,880
Did you hear
anything on Nick?

1151
01:57:32,924 --> 01:57:33,883
No.

1152
01:57:36,885 --> 01:57:40,348
Nothing. He's AWOL.
That's all we know.

1153
01:57:44,435 --> 01:57:45,894
He'll be back.

1154
01:57:47,021 --> 01:57:49,730
He never wrote to me.
He never called me.

1155
01:57:50,356 --> 01:57:51,942
Well, maybe you were out.

1156
01:57:53,901 --> 01:57:55,862
Yeah, maybe.

1157
01:58:01,410 --> 01:58:03,034
So how are you, anyway?

1158
01:58:04,369 --> 01:58:06,664
I'm fine, okay.
How are you?

1159
01:58:06,873 --> 01:58:11,085
Uh, me? I'm okay. I'm fine.
I go along, you know.

1160
01:58:12,003 --> 01:58:13,879
Still working at the market.

1161
01:58:15,547 --> 01:58:17,632
There's a million
things to do.

1162
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:20,384
Y- You sure you're all right,
huh?

1163
01:58:20,468 --> 01:58:21,428
Yeah, I'm all right.

1164
01:58:21,554 --> 01:58:23,389
What about your wounds?

1165
01:58:23,807 --> 01:58:25,391
There's nothing.

1166
01:58:26,268 --> 01:58:28,476
Just the usual complications,
that's all.

1167
01:58:28,559 --> 01:58:29,810
We heard-

1168
01:58:29,894 --> 01:58:32,523
No, that's not true.
A lot of guys go through it.

1169
01:58:32,689 --> 01:58:33,607
Mmm.

1170
01:58:36,943 --> 01:58:39,112
I made Nick that sweater.

1171
01:58:46,286 --> 01:58:48,788
I couldn't remember
the exact size,

1172
01:58:49,498 --> 01:58:52,417
but I think he's about
the same size as you, huh?

1173
01:58:56,086 --> 01:58:58,840
No, too big. Oops.

1174
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,885
Well,
I could fix that, though.

1175
01:59:04,221 --> 01:59:06,889
I mean, one thing about wool,
it's really a cinch...

1176
01:59:10,184 --> 01:59:11,393
to fix.

1177
01:59:13,728 --> 01:59:14,898
Oh, Christ!

1178
01:59:17,483 --> 01:59:18,484
It's okay.

1179
01:59:19,652 --> 01:59:20,863
It's okay.

1180
01:59:25,616 --> 01:59:26,616
It's okay.

1181
01:59:28,536 --> 01:59:29,704
How's your job?

1182
01:59:29,786 --> 01:59:32,038
Great. Fine, yeah.

1183
01:59:33,248 --> 01:59:34,999
Once or twice we
almost had to close.

1184
01:59:35,123 --> 01:59:36,710
I gotta go to work now.

1185
01:59:38,586 --> 01:59:39,753
You gotta go now?

1186
01:59:39,879 --> 01:59:41,047
Yes.

1187
01:59:41,173 --> 01:59:43,467
Uh, would you mind
if I walked you to work?

1188
01:59:47,678 --> 01:59:49,430
Mikey, you're so...

1189
01:59:50,472 --> 01:59:51,473
weird.

1190
01:59:52,683 --> 01:59:54,643
You're always
such a gentleman.

1191
02:00:03,693 --> 02:00:04,777
It's cold out there.

1192
02:00:04,860 --> 02:00:05,820
Yeah.

1193
02:00:05,904 --> 02:00:07,113
I'm not used to it.

1194
02:00:08,492 --> 02:00:10,618
Oh, I'm so glad you're alive.

1195
02:00:11,953 --> 02:00:13,245
I'm so happy.

1196
02:00:16,330 --> 02:00:18,666
I really don't know
what I feel.

1197
02:00:49,405 --> 02:00:50,949
Hello, hi, Mike.

1198
02:01:12,053 --> 02:01:16,557
Linda, I just wanted to say
how sorry I am about Nick.

1199
02:01:16,806 --> 02:01:18,849
And how...

1200
02:01:19,768 --> 02:01:21,686
I know how much
you loved him,

1201
02:01:21,769 --> 02:01:24,480
and I know that
it'll never be the same.

1202
02:01:26,065 --> 02:01:28,484
I just wanted
to tell you that.

1203
02:01:29,278 --> 02:01:31,028
Maybe...
I don't know.

1204
02:01:31,112 --> 02:01:33,364
Maybe you don't want
to talk about it.

1205
02:01:49,087 --> 02:01:50,796
How's it going, Hot Lips?

1206
02:01:53,384 --> 02:01:56,303
Yeah, no kidding.
He's a real tough guy.

1207
02:01:58,513 --> 02:01:59,847
It's okay.

1208
02:02:05,103 --> 02:02:06,854
Why don't you
come in with me?

1209
02:02:06,938 --> 02:02:09,858
Just say hello.
Come on. Oh, Mike, please.

1210
02:02:09,941 --> 02:02:11,943
Just say hello.
They want to see you, I know.

1211
02:02:12,068 --> 02:02:14,361
Yeah, just for a second,
okay? Okay.

1212
02:02:14,570 --> 02:02:16,071
Hey, look who's here?

1213
02:02:16,155 --> 02:02:17,197
It's Michael!

1214
02:02:17,281 --> 02:02:19,157
Look who's here.
Hey, everybody.

1215
02:02:20,577 --> 02:02:24,122
Oh, Michael, I read about
you in the paper. Oh, Michael.

1216
02:02:24,247 --> 02:02:25,958
Oh, Michael.
Oh, dear.

1217
02:02:26,125 --> 02:02:27,500
Doesn't he look terrific?

1218
02:02:27,624 --> 02:02:30,085
What a nice coat you have.
Hi, Michael.

1219
02:02:30,252 --> 02:02:31,629
Mike.
How beautiful you look.

1220
02:02:31,753 --> 02:02:33,130
You look good, Mike.

1221
02:02:33,213 --> 02:02:34,172
Welcome back.

1222
02:02:34,297 --> 02:02:35,299
Doesn't he
look gorgeous?

1223
02:02:35,424 --> 02:02:36,468
I'm glad he's home.

1224
02:02:36,593 --> 02:02:38,594
Hey, wait a minute.
Look at this. Medals.

1225
02:02:38,678 --> 02:02:39,928
Oh, my god.

1226
02:02:40,053 --> 02:02:41,345
All the medals.

1227
02:02:41,471 --> 02:02:42,680
Congratulations.

1228
02:02:42,805 --> 02:02:44,224
Oh, Michael.

1229
02:02:44,307 --> 02:02:45,516
Oh, Helen, come on.

1230
02:02:45,641 --> 02:02:46,978
Janie, leave me alone.

1231
02:02:48,979 --> 02:02:51,899
We really won over there,
huh, Mike? We won.

1232
02:02:51,983 --> 02:02:53,776
I have to go to work now.

1233
02:02:54,860 --> 02:02:56,695
Good seein' you, Mike.

1234
02:02:57,071 --> 02:02:58,530
See you, Michael.

1235
02:02:58,739 --> 02:03:01,200
Come see us, Michael.

1236
02:03:03,534 --> 02:03:04,702
Can I see you later?

1237
02:03:04,827 --> 02:03:05,994
Okay.

1238
02:03:06,119 --> 02:03:07,204
After work?

1239
02:03:07,329 --> 02:03:08,331
Yeah. Where?
Where.

1240
02:03:08,456 --> 02:03:09,998
At home?
At home? Okay.

1241
02:03:41,072 --> 02:03:42,406
One beer at John's. One beer.

1242
02:03:42,532 --> 02:03:43,740
What?

1243
02:03:43,865 --> 02:03:45,783
Come on,
I'll buy you a beer.

1244
02:03:46,908 --> 02:03:48,077
All right, just one.

1245
02:03:48,201 --> 02:03:50,664
Hey, Axel! Hey, Stosh!
Hey, Axel.

1246
02:03:51,330 --> 02:03:52,456
Hey!

1247
02:03:52,539 --> 02:03:54,125
Hey! He-hey!
Look at this!

1248
02:03:54,208 --> 02:03:55,501
How you doing?

1249
02:03:55,585 --> 02:03:57,544
Mikey! Hey, man, how
are you doing? All right.

1250
02:03:57,628 --> 02:03:59,463
Hey, where was you?
Where was you?

1251
02:03:59,546 --> 02:04:01,632
What do you mean, where
was I? Where were you?

1252
02:04:01,715 --> 02:04:03,760
Where was you, when we had
everything all set there.

1253
02:04:03,884 --> 02:04:06,095
The beer...
I'm I right, Axel? Huh?

1254
02:04:06,220 --> 02:04:07,680
I got delayed.

1255
02:04:08,514 --> 02:04:09,765
Something...

1256
02:04:09,890 --> 02:04:10,808
Hey.

1257
02:04:12,392 --> 02:04:13,852
You got a mustache.

1258
02:04:14,769 --> 02:04:15,938
Yeah.

1259
02:04:16,063 --> 02:04:17,773
Hey, it looks pretty good.

1260
02:04:18,773 --> 02:04:19,900
It's cute.

1261
02:04:20,025 --> 02:04:21,151
Yeah, it looks...

1262
02:04:21,235 --> 02:04:23,237
Come on,
we're going to John's.

1263
02:04:24,989 --> 02:04:26,864
So, how have you guys been?

1264
02:04:29,159 --> 02:04:30,534
Hanging in there. You know?

1265
02:04:30,617 --> 02:04:32,705
How does it feel
to be shot?

1266
02:04:32,788 --> 02:04:34,081
It don't.

1267
02:04:34,497 --> 02:04:35,458
Mmm.

1268
02:04:35,957 --> 02:04:38,918
It don't hurt, if that's what
you want to know.

1269
02:04:39,587 --> 02:04:41,921
How you been? Been okay?

1270
02:04:42,422 --> 02:04:43,549
Yeah.
Yeah.

1271
02:04:44,299 --> 02:04:45,717
Same old thing, you know?

1272
02:04:45,801 --> 02:04:47,594
Nothing's changed.

1273
02:04:47,844 --> 02:04:49,762
I'm getting more ass
than a toilet seat

1274
02:04:49,846 --> 02:04:52,013
and Axel here,
he's getting fatter than ever.

1275
02:04:55,892 --> 02:04:58,061
Hey, Stan, why don't you
show him that gun?

1276
02:04:58,187 --> 02:05:00,105
Shh. Take it easy.

1277
02:05:00,231 --> 02:05:02,482
That little pussy thing you
carry around, look at that.

1278
02:05:02,608 --> 02:05:03,568
Watch it.

1279
02:05:03,693 --> 02:05:05,027
What's that for?

1280
02:05:05,110 --> 02:05:06,444
Same thing
the other one was for.

1281
02:05:06,569 --> 02:05:07,653
And what was that for?

1282
02:05:07,779 --> 02:05:09,364
He's a worrier.

1283
02:05:09,447 --> 02:05:11,740
Ah, forget it. Come on,
let's go have a drink.

1284
02:05:11,824 --> 02:05:13,284
Yeah, let's get a drink.

1285
02:05:15,537 --> 02:05:18,246
Hey, Boom-Boom!
Look what I found!

1286
02:05:18,455 --> 02:05:21,375
Hey, Michael!
Never seen somebody...

1287
02:05:21,459 --> 02:05:23,669
Let this man through.
A little room!

1288
02:05:23,794 --> 02:05:25,339
How you doing, Mike?

1289
02:05:26,799 --> 02:05:28,175
What's up, buddy?

1290
02:05:30,969 --> 02:05:34,888
<i>"But she never complains of the fast
times and the bad things he's done"</i>

1291
02:05:35,013 --> 02:05:37,224
Come on, come on,
in the back, in the back.

1292
02:05:38,810 --> 02:05:40,060
Get in the back.

1293
02:05:40,143 --> 02:05:41,312
Come on.

1294
02:05:41,479 --> 02:05:43,271
<i>"She just talks about
the good times they've had"</i>

1295
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:45,481
<i>"and all the good times
to come"</i>

1296
02:05:45,649 --> 02:05:47,359
Hey, what's going on here?

1297
02:05:49,403 --> 02:05:51,155
Stosh,
get the glasses on the sink.

1298
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:52,906
Which ones, the dirty ones?

1299
02:05:53,073 --> 02:05:54,700
Yeah, use the dirty ones.

1300
02:05:55,242 --> 02:05:56,536
Phew, no shit.

1301
02:05:57,495 --> 02:05:59,746
Shit, what did you do?
Win the war all by yourself?

1302
02:06:00,872 --> 02:06:02,082
Look at this stuff here.

1303
02:06:02,166 --> 02:06:03,292
No help from you.

1304
02:06:03,416 --> 02:06:04,918
Here we go!

1305
02:06:05,002 --> 02:06:06,002
<i>Misha...</i>

1306
02:06:09,674 --> 02:06:10,799
To you, Mike.

1307
02:06:10,925 --> 02:06:12,133
To everybody.

1308

I have, uh, all this food.

comfort each other?

1362

No, I can't. Not here.
I gotta get out of here.

02:21:16,632 --> 02:21:17,885
What, you think
it was loaded?

1470
02:21:18,010 --> 02:21:19,178
Give me that!

1471
02:21:33,399 --> 02:21:34,859
You want to play games?

1472
02:21:34,984 --> 02:21:37,444
All right,
I'll play your fucking games!

1473
02:21:41,406 --> 02:21:42,282
Hey!

1474
02:21:42,407 --> 02:21:45,411
How do you feel now? Huh? Huh?

1475
02:21:46,411 --> 02:21:47,412
Hey!

1476
02:21:47,495 --> 02:21:48,622
Big shot!

1477
02:23:12,910 --> 02:23:14,330
Hi, Michael.

1478
02:23:14,579 --> 02:23:15,581
Linda's in back.

1479
02:23:15,665 --> 02:23:16,665
She's in back?

1480
02:23:16,749 --> 02:23:18,000
Yeah, hey,
how was the hunting?

1481
02:23:18,124 --> 02:23:19,502
It was fine, thanks.

1482
02:23:31,514 --> 02:23:33,473
Linda, what's the matter?

1483
02:23:38,353 --> 02:23:39,771
I don't know.

1484
02:23:42,107 --> 02:23:43,774
What's the matter?

1485
02:23:44,567 --> 02:23:46,403
Nothing, I don't know.

1486
02:23:52,031 --> 02:23:54,034
Well,
it's gotta be something.

1487
02:23:57,413 --> 02:23:59,249
I got the car outside.

1488
02:23:59,457 --> 02:24:01,210
Yeah. Well, that's okay.

1489
02:24:03,961 --> 02:24:05,003
You sure?

1490
02:24:05,087 --> 02:24:07,548
No, it's okay.
Just leave me alone, okay?

1491
02:24:09,592 --> 02:24:10,718
Really.

1492
02:24:29,820 --> 02:24:31,654
Good night,
see you in the morning.

1493
02:24:31,737 --> 02:24:33,656
Good night, see you tomorrow.

1494
02:24:37,534 --> 02:24:39,745
Come with me.
We'll get you home.

1495
02:24:43,206 --> 02:24:45,083
No, I think
I'll go with him.

1496
02:24:45,167 --> 02:24:46,877
Okay? Thanks.
Okay.

1497
02:24:56,677 --> 02:24:58,096
You okay?

1498
02:25:01,933 --> 02:25:04,645
Did you ever think life
would turn out like this?

1499
02:25:07,815 --> 02:25:08,856
No.

1500
02:27:42,005 --> 02:27:43,840
<i>I-27.</i>

1501
02:27:46,927 --> 02:27:48,093
<i>N-40.</i>

1502
02:27:48,219 --> 02:27:49,304
Bingo.

1503
02:27:49,804 --> 02:27:53,098
<i>We have a bingo,
Johnny come lately.</i>

1504
02:27:53,934 --> 02:27:55,894
<i>Where are you, Johnny?</i>

1505
02:27:55,978 --> 02:27:57,562
<i>There you are.</i>

1506
02:27:57,645 --> 02:27:58,897

02:27:58,980 --> 02:28:00,522
<i>Yeah.

<i>Right.

<i>We have... That's a winner.</i>

1512
02:28:07,278 --> 02:28:08,697
<i>Get out of my road there.</i>

1513
02:28:08,780 --> 02:28:11,909
<i>Ivan Stivan,
I can't see myself smokin'.</i>

<i>And the next number, I-16.</i>

1515
02:28:15,328 --> 02:28:18,498
<i>Wish it was I,
nice, sweet 16.</i>

1516
02:28:18,623 --> 02:28:21,835
<i>I-18. Then you become a man.</i>

1517
02:28:22,128 --> 02:28:24,922
<i>Let's go, men, G-60.</i>

1518
02:28:25,047 --> 02:28:27,548
<i>And those boys that
can't help themselves,</i>

1519
02:28:27,632 --> 02:28:29,550
<i>please, buddy, help them, too.</i>

1520
02:28:29,633 --> 02:28:31,803
<i>Oh, will you dance with me?</i>

1521
02:28:32,178 --> 02:28:34,097
<i>G-47.</i>

1522
02:28:35,014 --> 02:28:38,601
<i>But I'm still satisfied
with what I've got.</i>

1523
02:28:39,185 --> 02:28:41,479
<i>That wonderful life
I've lived.</i>

1524
02:28:41,604 --> 02:28:46,024
<i>Think it over, buddy boys,
and I'll give you O-61.</i>

1525
02:28:52,199 --> 02:28:53,782
Hi, how're you doing?

1526
02:28:57,954 --> 02:28:59,955
Steven,
there's a call for you.

1527
02:29:00,749 --> 02:29:02,625
Maybe it's from Angela.

1528
02:29:31,028 --> 02:29:32,070
Hello.

1529
02:29:32,237 --> 02:29:33,779
<i>Stevie, it's me, Mike.</i>

1530
02:29:34,155 --> 02:29:35,323
Michael?

1531
02:29:37,533 --> 02:29:38,492
Michael?

1532
02:29:39,076 --> 02:29:40,077
Hey.

1533
02:29:40,203 --> 02:29:41,496
<i>Hey.</i>

1534
02:29:42,998 --> 02:29:43,915
Hey.

1535
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:46,416
How's things?

1536
02:29:46,541 --> 02:29:48,835
<i>I'm okay. Never mind me.
How are you?</i>

1537
02:29:50,545 --> 02:29:51,712
Great.

1538
02:29:53,047 --> 02:29:54,048
Great.

1539
02:29:56,677 --> 02:29:58,929
Hey, wha-
hey, what's that noise?

1540
02:29:59,720 --> 02:30:00,805
What?

1541
02:30:01,097 --> 02:30:03,058
Oh, wheelchairs.

1542
02:30:03,766 --> 02:30:04,850
<i>What?</i>

1543
02:30:09,315 --> 02:30:11,025
Hey, Stevie,
when are you gettin' out?

1544
02:30:12,067 --> 02:30:14,985
Uh, I'm gonna stay
here awhile, Mike.

1545
02:30:15,527 --> 02:30:16,696
What for?

1546
02:30:16,905 --> 02:30:18,197
<i>The place is great.</i>

1547
02:30:18,406 --> 02:30:19,365
Huh?

1548
02:30:19,908 --> 02:30:21,576
It's like a resort.

1549
02:30:23,411 --> 02:30:25,622
I mean, they got basketball,

1550
02:30:25,870 --> 02:30:26,830
bowlin'.

1551
02:30:26,914 --> 02:30:27,999
<i>What?</i>

1552
02:30:29,916 --> 02:30:32,837
Princess Grace came to see us
the other day.

1553
02:30:34,840 --> 02:30:36,048
Michael?

1554
02:30:36,132 --> 02:30:37,299
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

1555
02:30:37,508 --> 02:30:38,468
Hey.

1556
02:30:38,802 --> 02:30:40,052
<i>Michael.</i>

<i>Steve?</i>

1558
02:30:42,930 --> 02:30:44,099
<i>Stevie.</i>

1559
02:30:44,223 --> 02:30:46,100
Hey, I gotta go, Mike.

1560
02:30:46,350 --> 02:30:47,434
I gotta go.

1561
02:30:48,018 --> 02:30:48,936
<i>Curfew, man.</i>

1562
02:30:50,104 --> 02:30:51,897
Stevie? Steve?

1563
02:31:58,668 --> 02:32:00,087
Mike?

1564
02:32:02,340 --> 02:32:04,133
Mike. Hey.

1565
02:32:07,344 --> 02:32:09,055
Mike, how are you?

1566
02:32:09,430 --> 02:32:10,305
Hey.

1567
02:32:10,431 --> 02:32:11,391
Hey.

1568
02:32:12,182 --> 02:32:13,184
Michael.

1569
02:32:14,685 --> 02:32:15,685
Hey.

1570
02:32:18,314 --> 02:32:20,191
Good. We made it.
We made it.

1571
02:32:20,567 --> 02:32:21,526
Okay.
Yeah.

1572
02:32:21,609 --> 02:32:23,194
Good.
That's it.

1573
02:32:23,319 --> 02:32:24,279
Hey.

1574
02:32:25,320 --> 02:32:27,031
I don't wanna go home.

1575
02:32:27,197 --> 02:32:28,031
I know.

1576
02:32:28,197 --> 02:32:29,617
Oh, good. Good.
I know.

1577
02:32:29,742 --> 02:32:30,701
Yeah, good.

1578
02:32:30,826 --> 02:32:31,701
I know.

1579
02:32:31,827 --> 02:32:32,994
Really.

1580
02:32:35,580 --> 02:32:36,790
You look good.

1581
02:32:36,873 --> 02:32:37,917
Yeah.

1582
02:32:38,249 --> 02:32:40,000
You do any hunting?

1583
02:32:41,043 --> 02:32:43,003
Hunting? Yeah, I did hunting.
Did you get one?

1584
02:32:43,129 --> 02:32:44,631
No, yeah, no, no.

1585
02:32:44,715 --> 02:32:46,341
You didn't get a deer?

1586
02:32:46,466 --> 02:32:48,718
Didn't get anything.
No, I know.

1587
02:32:48,844 --> 02:32:49,720
Oh.

1588
02:32:49,845 --> 02:32:51,512
I was tracking
this beautiful buck

1589
02:32:51,637 --> 02:32:53,139
and it slipped away.

1590
02:32:53,223 --> 02:32:54,223
Oh.

1591
02:32:54,974 --> 02:32:55,934
Oh.

1592
02:32:56,227 --> 02:32:57,728
Angela didn't send you?

1593
02:32:57,852 --> 02:32:58,729
Angela?

1594
02:32:58,853 --> 02:32:59,813
She didn't send you here?

1595
02:32:59,937 --> 02:33:00,814
No.

1596
02:33:01,439 --> 02:33:02,899
Yeah, good.

1597
02:33:02,983 --> 02:33:04,317
I got something
I wanna show you.

1598
02:33:04,398 --> 02:33:05,316
What's that?

1599
02:33:05,400 --> 02:33:06,903
I got something here.

1600
02:33:07,903 --> 02:33:09,363
Come here with me
for a minute.

1601
02:33:09,488 --> 02:33:11,449
It's something
I gotta show you.

1602
02:33:11,740 --> 02:33:12,741
Yeah.

1603
02:33:13,992 --> 02:33:16,496
Angela, she keeps
sending me socks.

1604
02:33:17,621 --> 02:33:19,998
It's not socks
I gotta show you, Mike.

1605
02:33:21,082 --> 02:33:23,835
This-This comes
every month from Saigon.

1606
02:33:23,918 --> 02:33:25,378
I don't understand.

1607
02:33:26,003 --> 02:33:27,255
I don't understand.

1608
02:33:27,381 --> 02:33:29,673
That place is
gonna fall any day now.

1609
02:33:34,261 --> 02:33:35,888
It's Nicky, Steve.

1610
02:33:37,014 --> 02:33:38,434
Nick's alive?

1611
02:33:40,101 --> 02:33:42,104
Mike? Hey.

1612
02:33:43,521 --> 02:33:44,939
What did you say?

1613
02:33:45,064 --> 02:33:46,399
How do you know?

1614
02:33:48,859 --> 02:33:49,818
Hey.

1615
02:33:49,985 --> 02:33:51,445
That place is
gonna get caught

1616
02:33:51,529 --> 02:33:53,197
in a terrible shitstorm.

1617
02:33:53,740 --> 02:33:56,408
Where's a guy like Nick
get money like this?

1618
02:33:57,909 --> 02:33:59,536
I don't know. Cards, maybe.

1619
02:33:59,620 --> 02:34:02,290
Listen, Steven,
I'm gonna take you home.

1620
02:34:02,414 --> 02:34:04,083
Oh, shit, Mike,
you promised me.

1621
02:34:04,166 --> 02:34:05,418
Stevie, I'm gonna
take you home.

1622
02:34:05,542 --> 02:34:08,253
Come on. I don't fit... You
can't stay here, come on.

1623
02:34:08,379 --> 02:34:09,755
Look... Hey.

1624
02:34:09,839 --> 02:34:11,214
I'm gonna take you home.

1625
02:34:11,298 --> 02:34:12,382
Fuck, man.
Look, you promised me, man.

1626
02:34:14,133 --> 02:34:16,261
I don't fit! Michael!

1627
02:34:16,511 --> 02:34:19,097
Hey, I'm sorry.

1628
02:34:19,347 --> 02:34:21,475
You do as your
heart tells you, man.

1629
02:34:54,339 --> 02:34:56,258
We got a Coke machine,
if anybody wants one.

1630
02:34:56,341 --> 02:34:58,426
No, Sergeant,
we're runnin' late.

1631
02:35:03,598 --> 02:35:04,725
Make way!

1632
02:35:08,687 --> 02:35:09,687
Make way!

1633
02:35:16,692 --> 02:35:17,652
Make way!

1634
02:37:08,385 --> 02:37:10,430
Hey, where are you going?

1635
02:37:10,514 --> 02:37:12,390
Are you going to come
with me?

1636
02:38:20,747 --> 02:38:21,997
Do you remember me?

1637
02:38:23,500 --> 02:38:24,834
You remember me?

1638
02:38:28,714 --> 02:38:31,174
You remember Nick?
You remember Nick?

1639
02:38:33,468 --> 02:38:34,511
Where is he?

1640
02:38:34,679 --> 02:38:37,597
I don't know.
Really, I don't know.

1641
02:38:37,721 --> 02:38:39,556
He disappeared
a long time ago.

1642
02:38:42,351 --> 02:38:43,310
Hold on a minute.

1643
02:38:43,435 --> 02:38:44,687
What are you
looking for?

1644
02:38:44,812 --> 02:38:46,439
Nothing to see
anymore here.

1645
02:38:46,564 --> 02:38:47,439
See that?

1646
02:38:47,565 --> 02:38:48,522
What you want?

1647
02:38:48,606 --> 02:38:49,608
I want a game.

1648
02:38:50,901 --> 02:38:52,443
That's for you.

1649
02:38:54,821 --> 02:38:56,366
It's too dangerous now.

1650
02:38:56,490 --> 02:38:59,785
These times are too dangerous
for this kind of game.

1651
02:39:01,703 --> 02:39:04,372
What do you think?
You think I'm afraid of you?

1652
02:39:06,917 --> 02:39:08,835
I want to play the American.

1653
02:39:09,418 --> 02:39:11,589
I'll match him.
Highest stakes.

1654
02:39:21,973 --> 02:39:23,057
Okay.

1655
02:39:24,685 --> 02:39:26,854
How do I know
you know where he is?

1656
02:39:27,271 --> 02:39:29,396
Because I know, that's all.

1657
02:39:29,605 --> 02:39:31,858
But I have to take you
by the river.

1658
02:39:45,495 --> 02:39:48,708
Only because I feel
comfortable with the whites.

1659
02:40:50,224 --> 02:40:51,267
We are.

1660
02:40:51,393 --> 02:40:53,854
You like change your mind?
There's still time.

1661
02:41:15,833 --> 02:41:17,251
Come on.

1662
02:41:29,637 --> 02:41:30,888
Wait here.

1663
02:41:55,080 --> 02:41:57,040
He said we have
to pay to go inside.

1664
02:41:57,165 --> 02:41:58,082
How much?

1665
02:41:58,249 --> 02:41:59,125
$1,000.

1666
02:41:59,917 --> 02:42:01,419
Tell him I'm coming up.

1667
02:42:36,118 --> 02:42:38,288
He said, yes, the famous
American is inside.

1668
02:42:38,413 --> 02:42:41,457
You have to give him $500 more
for this information.

1669
02:44:23,640 --> 02:44:25,141
Where's Nick?
I don't know.

1670
02:44:25,267 --> 02:44:26,850
What do you mean?
Where is he?

1671
02:44:26,975 --> 02:44:28,562
We have to go ask the boss.

1672
02:44:40,156 --> 02:44:41,866
Hey, Nick.

1673
02:44:42,992 --> 02:44:44,244
Are you all right?

1674
02:44:44,411 --> 02:44:45,702
Nick, it's me.

1675
02:44:46,995 --> 02:44:49,206
Nick. Hey. Hey.

1676
02:44:50,542 --> 02:44:53,376
What you're doing? Nick?
What you're... Oh.

1677
02:44:53,460 --> 02:44:54,879
What you're doing?

1678
02:44:54,963 --> 02:44:57,090
Nicholas, what's the matter?

1679
02:44:57,255 --> 02:44:59,049
Get over there.
Get over there.

1680
02:45:03,052 --> 02:45:04,845
Do you know it's me?
It's Mike.

1681
02:45:04,929 --> 02:45:06,266
Tell me, "it's Mike."

1682
02:45:06,433 --> 02:45:07,767
Tell me, "it's Mike."
It's Mike.

1683
02:45:07,891 --> 02:45:09,184
Tell me, "it's Mike."
It's Mike.

1684
02:45:09,267 --> 02:45:10,645
Mike. Mike who?

1685
02:45:11,020 --> 02:45:12,938
Mike who? Hey, Mike who?

1686
02:45:13,396 --> 02:45:15,065
"Mike who?" I don't know.

1687
02:45:20,279 --> 02:45:23,616
Nicholas, I came 12,000 miles
back here to get you.

1688
02:45:24,949 --> 02:45:27,201
Don't do that to me,
I'll fucking... Don't do it.

1689
02:45:27,285 --> 02:45:29,912
Don't do it. Don't do it.
What's the matter with you?

1690
02:45:30,037 --> 02:45:32,122
Don't you recognize me? Huh?

1691
02:45:32,248 --> 02:45:34,541
Don't you recognize me? Huh?

1692
02:45:38,005 --> 02:45:39,297
Nicky, I love you.

1693
02:45:39,422 --> 02:45:41,756
You're my friend,
what are you doing?

1694
02:45:53,059 --> 02:45:54,769
How could you fucking
do this to me?

1695
02:45:54,894 --> 02:45:56,396
You fucking...

1696
02:45:59,525 --> 02:46:01,193
Did you hear what I said?

1697
02:46:01,318 --> 02:46:02,903
Come here,
you fucking guinea.

1698
02:46:10,034 --> 02:46:10,994
<i>Salut.</i>

1699
02:46:22,839 --> 02:46:24,298
How much?

1700
02:46:24,632 --> 02:46:26,926
"How much?"
This is how much.

1701
02:46:33,682 --> 02:46:35,393
Here, you count it.

1702
02:46:45,776 --> 02:46:46,736
C'mon, why not?

1703
02:46:47,904 --> 02:46:49,155
Why not?

1704
02:46:51,158 --> 02:46:52,659
I don't want this money.

1705
02:46:52,784 --> 02:46:53,827
You don't want the money?

1706
02:46:53,910 --> 02:46:55,161
Here, take it,
take that, too.

1707
02:46:55,329 --> 02:46:56,623
Tell him, go ahead.

1708
02:47:48,964 --> 02:47:50,299
We don't have much time.

1709
02:47:50,424 --> 02:47:52,299
We don't have
much time, Nick.

1710
02:48:19,325 --> 02:48:20,744
Don't do it.

1711
02:48:59,323 --> 02:49:00,949
Is this what you want?

1712
02:49:02,451 --> 02:49:03,953
Is this what you want?

1713
02:49:14,503 --> 02:49:15,796

Nicholas.

1715
02:49:51,916 --> 02:49:53,917

1716
02:49:54,542 --> 02:49:56,670
Just come home. Home.

1717
02:49:59,548 --> 02:50:00,882
Talk to me.

1718
02:50:01,634 --> 02:50:03,426
Look, Nicholas,
talk to me.

1719

Nicky. Nicky.

1720
02:50:12,228 --> 02:50:14,813
Wait a minute.
What did you do to your arms?

1721
02:50:16,063 --> 02:50:17,523
Nicky, you remember the trees,

1722
02:50:17,648 --> 02:50:19,149
all the different ways
in the trees.

1723

Remember that?
Remember? Huh?

1724
02:50:22,738 --> 02:50:25,239

You remember all that?
