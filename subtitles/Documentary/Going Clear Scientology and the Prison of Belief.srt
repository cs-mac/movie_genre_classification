If you are so worried about him, then go and meet him.

5
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,220
- You just have to go and meet him.
- Ah seriously! What's wrong with you again?

6
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:02,020
Kim Jae Hyuk is okay, right? You have to always stay beside him, what if all those crazies bother him?

7
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,540
Is Kim Jae Hyuk still doing sports? Ah, but his shoulder shouldn't be injured.

8
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,640
Go and meet him by yourself, tell him you love him.

9
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,260
Go meet him, I will introduce you to him. He would definitely remember you.

10
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,500
- I don't want to.
- Why?

11
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,320
I'm shy.

12

<i>Hello everybody. FM Morning Show. No Hong Chul.</i>

13
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,860
<i>Just one night, and the temperature dropped.
 And please mind your outfits, everyone...</i>

14
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,160
<i>But my child, where are you going? To the office? To the shop?</i>

15
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,520
<i>Or to somewhere only you know?</i>

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,720
<i>Where is it? Is it the place that you could use to workout?</i>

17
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,660
If that is so, it's really okay.

18
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,440
<i>Everyone, don't get swear at, and don't swear. Enjoy this warm and fun day.</i>

00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,340
<i>I will play the song 'Bravo' with enthusiasm.</i>

20
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,540
Food!

21
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,180
What are you looking at?

22
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,980
Ah looking at the snow? You must like snow a lot.

23
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,140
- They said if you go hiking, you will meet...
- Because I love ice cream.

24
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:06,760
- I suddenly want ice cream when I see snow.
- Go to the supermarket, cook noodles, and then ice cream... 

25
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,380
If you asked, you can go out and do it.

26
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,520
Jae Hyuk, before doing it, you have to pray first because there are so many psychos there.

27
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,120
But I don't believe in that kind of thing.

28
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,740
<i>Uncles! Food!</i>

29
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,180
Everything is the same in here.
Don't ever eat the seaweed soup...

30
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,680
And don't eat the eggs, too.

31
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,780
Even though you want it, don't ever crack it.

32
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,400
This bastard. Just because he wants to be alright, he is always lost in his own thoughts.

33
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,300
Hey, he was pulled out from here, why did you bring him back?

34
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,200
He doesn't fit in with people like us.

35
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,700
Wait, it's still an honor...

36
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,460
When else could we be together with a superstar?

37
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,500
Hey! Porter!

38
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,720
Hey, where is the half of the chicken soup? Where is it?

39
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:27,080
Uncle, it's the people in kitchen who did the thing, my role is just to distribute it.

40
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,280
This kid, who do you think you are lying to?

41
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,080
Hey! Do you know who is in this room?

42
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,840
There's a superstar in here! Superstar Kim Jae Hyuk.

43
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,600
Someone who got jailed just because of hitting someone...

44
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,900
Someone who, after beating someone, still managed to look fine.

45
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,600
Oh gosh! This unfair world.

46
00:04:53,480 --> 00:05:00,480
No! Maybe God protects such people in order for them to keep staying in prison.

47
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,460
Oh?

48
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,340
Chicken neck. I'm blessed.

49
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,340
What a positive minded person. Watch and learn.

No!

57
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,280
- You've worked hard.
- Officer Lee must be happy because you are his fan. Congrats!

58
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,280
Don't forget.

59
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,420
- You've worked hard.
- Thank you.

60
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,460
Your wish came true Officer Lee. You got to meet Athlete Kim Jae Hyuk.

61
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,920
I didn't know that you really liked me.

62
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,360
- Shut it.
- Just say it...

63
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
- That we are friends.
- Nope.

64
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,980
I'm the one who is going to be tired in the end.

65
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,480
With everyone not knowing about this, I can take care of you more freely.

66
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,680
Cook the noodles.

67
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,880
People in here, though they already got out, they don't contact each other anymore...

68
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,580
That's why don't ever promise to meet up and give them your phone number...

69
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:39,100
Of course, you aren't that kind of person.
However, it's only a few days left, you have to be careful.

70
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,220
Especially with those people from the death row, they say they're the scariest.

71
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,280
- But before I go, there's a person that I want to greet...
- Who?

72
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,960
- But there's death row in here, too?
- Of course.

73
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,800
Although they used to be separated in the past, they're being put together now.

74
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,280
Those death row prisoners don't have a future. There's no hope, that's why they can do anything, so you have to be careful.

75
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,720
If you meet them, just avoid them, especially the white haired with star tattoo on his hand.

76
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,180
2300, Kim Jae Hyuk.

77
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,580
Turn around.

78
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,680
Right? Even though I came, you aren't happy at all.

79
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,760
I didn't come here because I want to, but because your mother told me to come so I couldn't do anything.

80
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,960
I saw a death row prisoner.

81
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,540
Jiho, I saw a death row prisoner earlier.

82
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,800
- How's the appearance? Must be really scary, right?
- No.

83
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,300
Looked pretty normal.

84
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,280
That's why it's really scary.

85
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,120
2300, Kim Jae Hyuk, turn around.

86
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,500
This place is really weird.

87
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,340
- Like a place for those evil people.
- That's the reason they got jailed, you fool.

88
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,980
A week left, hang in there for just one more week.

89
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,020
But you...

90
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,680
We have broken up, why do you keep coming back here?

91
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,000
Ah, your mother asked me to. I told you a minute ago.

92
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,860
You never pay attention to my words, indeed, it's always you who talks.

93
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,200
What you see, it's not everything.

94
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,900
Package delivery!

95
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,080
Don't trust anything and anyone.

96
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,820
Excuse me.

97
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,760
Excuse me.

98
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,740
Drink this.

99
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,460
Oh my, it's okay.

100
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,020
Don't worry too much, this place is still a place for humans.

101
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,360
Only one week left...

102
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,600
Just live as a fool.
Only one week left...

103
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,680
Just live as a fool.

00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,700
Like it used to be. Like usual.

105
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,200
I will check on this package.

106
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,020
Cola, orange juice, milk, citrus juice...

107
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:50,080
Chopsticks, sun cream, body lotion, and gloves.

108
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,980
Ah right. T-Money Card, this is for Uncle Seagull.

109
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,280
It's free as well today. Whose turn is it today?

110
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,280
I'm Song Se Min

111
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,580
Thank you Athlete Kim. It's an honor to meet you.

112
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,260
Hey, Porter!

113
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,900
Get out.

114
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,980

Even if you have 50,000 Won, I can get punished.
And even more.

118
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,980
It's your problem, whether you make it or steal it...

119
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,540
Bring it in tomorrow, understand?

120
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,400
Do you understand or not, you piece of shit?

121
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,240
Go.

122
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,940
- Just one bite.
- No.

123
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,980
This is my first ever package, If you want, I will give it for 7,000 won.

124
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,840
You have money? Didn't you have no money?

125
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,600
Ah, my sister gave me 300,000 won. I bought it with that money.

126
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,540
My donation money. Therefore you shouldn't ask for it too, Professor.

127
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,760
Dinosaur snack, cola, and orange juice, please keep it well.

128
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,200
Because you have to be here for a long time.

129
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,840
I don't need this kind of thing anymore. You can take it.

130
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,660
Why? Because I will get released next week.

131
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,480
No, seems like you can't get out of here..

132
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,420
Ah, you didn't know what happened to this person apparently.

133
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,440
This person is the famous White Money scammer

134
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,400
He counterfeited 50,000 won with a white paper.

135
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,480
He put in salt water into a small bottle and spread it to the white paper...

136
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:47,100
Then he put the white paper in cold water, and that white paper will turn into 50,000 won.

137
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,180
Yes, he is that great scammer.

138
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,940
What do you mean by scammer?

139
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,440
I'm a magician.

140
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,060
7 Free Stars, it was also a scam.

141
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,100
Kim Jae Hyuk.

142
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,480
Meet me for a minute.

143
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:27,740
Ah, there's no more of it. I will give all of these to our officers who are on duty.

144
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,860
Can I get one cup of coffee?

145
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,940
Ah, I can give 100 cups if you want.

146
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,760
He wants you to stay here for long...

147
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,340
But is it appropriate to say that?

148
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,560
Ah, Officer Lee said that. Let's meet again next time.

149
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,980
We can't say it these days.

150
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,380
Ah, do you happen to know Lee Joon Ho?

151
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,980
That person has always talked about Kim Jae Hyuk since then.

152
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,860
Not an ordinary fan.

153
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,300
Ah, he is too much.

154
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,700
Ah, seriously... He asked for everything.
Ah What's with him?

155
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
That.

156
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,620
- You think wisely.
- Everything is just the same.

157
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,520
T-Money Card works like ATM card here.

158
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,140
This is 100,000 won. But it works as money here.

159
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,240
You must have known about this. Even for one visit and one call only, it's very much impossible.

160
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,460
Because you're still not concerned about this, because you can't fight with just anyone outside

161
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,400
Therefore, even though T-Card is a useless thing outside here...

162
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,160
He can buy everything everyday.
Yes, exchange it with cigarette.

163
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,360
One T-Money Card a pack, means that it's equal to 10,000 to 50,000 won.

164
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,520
That time there was someone who owned a T-Money Card and he could ride the subway.

165
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,800
Doesn't work. Since a long time ago.

166
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,140
Then, what about that?

167
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,680
Got broken, last year.

168
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,840
Oh? It's still recording.

169
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
Is it?

170
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,600
Ah, it works fine. We can see it clearly.

171
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,320
What do you mean? I could only see one person.

172
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,820
Between the wall and 30cm from the chair, you couldn't see anything beyond that point anymore.

173
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,960
I got this information from one person 3 years ago, how could he know about it?

174
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,120
Really awesome. As expected, someone who is hard to beat.

175
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,160
I will check on something.

176
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,760
Everything could be seen.

177
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,260
- This is the reason why he is the chief.
- What Chief, he is just a gangster.

178
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,140
I'm leaving.

179
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,140
But Sir...

180
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,600
This place seems to be more and more out of reach. Want me to connect you with my journalist contacts?

181
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:08,420
Kim Jae Hyuk hit someone, but why is there not a single article?

182
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,960
Tell everyone that Superstar is scary.

183
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,820
Isn't that how it's supposed to be?

184
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,140
Hey, let's talk...

185
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Just for a while.

186
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,960
I'll shut you up a little.

187
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,420
Do I look easy to you?

188
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,220
Hey, asshole. Pretentious garbage.

189
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,680
People's patience doesn't last forever.

190
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,120
That's why you should finish your fucking prison term well.

191
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,340
I'm leaving.

192
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,180
I used to have a religion when I was in school.

193
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,940
I went to the temple with you yesterday, remember?

194
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:09,960
I don't go there at random. I've only been there twice, and during those two, I pondered hardly before I went.

195
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:15,700
Especially sometimes the Catholics and Buddhists give milk bread and varieties of candies, if we come and visit.

196
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,460
The timing and venue are really more important than anything.

197
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,480
In church there's hymnal and it's perfect when I want to shout.

198
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,520
But, Jae Hyuk...

199
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,020
Excuse me, Athlete Kim Jae Hyuk.

200
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,220
Tennis ball. I'm embarrassed to give it earlier, so I held on to it first.

201
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,040
You can use it until your release.

202
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,020
Hey! Porter!

203
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,180
Give me the fucking knife. Knife.

204
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,440
Because of this, there is no reason for me not to hit you.

205
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,720
Hey, look directly into my eyes.

206
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,400
This is the last warning, work properly.

207
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,780
If you come emptyhanded again tomorrow, I will stab you with that knife. Understand?

208
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,900
Do you understand?

209
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,320
Hey! What's happening there?

210
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,920
Sports time's up!

211
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,980
- It's cold today, are you alright?
- Yes, I'm fine.

212
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,600
- Thanks for caring about me.
- Ah it's okay, this is the Chief's special order.

213
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,080
We're the one who feel guilty because we can't allow you to do sports more than 30 minutes.

214
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,400
Wanna change?

215
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,940
Screaming makes you feel better.

216
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,920
Hey Swindler, are you really going out?

217
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,780
I'll bid goodbye first -- in the future, you have to live your life better.

218
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,540
This place isn't a nice place for people to live in.

219
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:29,080
- You swindled a lot of people, how can you go out this soon?
- What do you mean by how?

220
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,540
If you can go in, you can go out too.

221
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,480
Athlete Kim will be out soon too. Is the date same with mine?

222
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,900
- Ah.
- Dong Ho .

223
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,300
Ah, now...

224
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,080
Ah, Kim Jae Hyuk's time is coming to a close.

225
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:11,120
Who would know the verdict later on.

226
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,720
Isn't it too quiet today?

227
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,260
It's like something huge is about to happen.

228
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:22,120
<i>Chief, Chief! There is an emergency patient.</i>

229
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,640
<i>Send help, quick!</i>

230
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,360
<i>Room 7HA5, there's an emergency patient.</i>

231
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,020
Hey, hang on. You can still breathe, can't you?

232
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,580
- Dong Ho! Dong Ho!
- There's an emergency patient here!

233
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,460
Ah what are you doing?! You didn't call for an ambulance?

234
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,440
Attention! Please dispatch...

235
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,340
Hang on. Dong Ho. You're going to be alright.

236
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,680
- What do you call 119 for?
- Ah you didn't call for an ambulance?

237
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,780
I said call an ambulance!

238
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,600
- Start counting. One.
- Chief!

239
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,960
What are you guys doing?

240
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,260
Chief.

241
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,180
Please call the ambulance.

242
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,280
Two...

243
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,520
Dong Ho.

244
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,760
Three...

245
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,540
- I'm fine.
- Really?

246
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,080
- It got better really quickly.
- Thank God.

247
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,120
Dolmaeng, your acting skills got better.

248
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,760
This time you almost got me.

249
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,160
Chief, how did you find out?

250
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:53,700
Only idiots think that the heart is on the right side.

251
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,340
Remember that, Officer Choi.

252
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,240
He wants to go out so bad. To smell the fresh air and see the ladies.
And drive huge cars.

253
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,220
- That was just acting?
- Yes, but Chief Jo can tell with just one look.

254
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,280
Because I panicked so much, I couldn't think straight.

255
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,900
In the military, there will always be people like that.
I'm not envious at all.

256
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,660
My brother came. I'll be back soon.

257
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,560
Ah, this kid, really...

258
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:59,300
- He will be freed, right?
- Of course he will.

259
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,200
- Should I use this?
- Quit it.

260
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,340
Should I take it off?

261
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,840
Have you eaten?

262
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,100
How was your sleep?

263
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:26,600
Father, I will really be freed, right?

264
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,200
Of course, just wait a bit.

265
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,860
You will use Lawyer Kim Hae Chan, right?

266
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:39,360
Don't worry, your mother is seeing him today.

267
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,560
- Thank God. The people here hit me...
- Oh?

268
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,800
Kim Jae Hyuk. That's athlete Kim Jae Hyuk.

269
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,820
Please, just act normally, please.

270
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:17,020
Seriously, I don't even know why he's wearing this.

271
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,380
What are you doing? Come on, greet him quickly, it's your idol.

272
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,060
Hello.

273
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:31,240
I am... Lee Joon Ho... My brother... My brother is Lee Joon Ho...

274
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,240
I am his younger brother, Lee Joon Dol.

275
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,740
You really look like a fool.

276
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,660
I think I saw you when I was in middle school.

277
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,620
In your house.

278
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,960
Right, that was with me. There was him too.

279
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,960
You're good looking.

280
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,280
Hey, he used to be fine, he became like this when he started liking you.

281
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,920
You're a university student now?

282
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,220
How can you call a kid like this a university student?

283
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,060
Tell him your actual work.

284
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,240
In order to create a brighter and more harmonious society...

285
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,700
- Forget it. My brother...
- <i>Officer Lee.</i>

286
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,420
<i>The Chief said to return soon.</i>

287
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,660
You two go ahead and talk.

288
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,100
My kindhearted brother, there are only several minutes left.

289
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,640
I don't know when else I can meet him, please add just a little bit more time.

290
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:29,120
He'll come out in two days, just meet him directly then, or go to a sauna together.

291
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,840
- You have time, right?
- Of course.

292
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,540
Ah, today we have a special event. You have to come.

293
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,860
You can shout all you want there. You know that, right?

294
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,700
Indeed, it's nice there...

295
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,200
But it's also loud.

296
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,540
What do you do?

297
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,220
- I'll be back soon.
- Where to?

298
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,620
- To the office, it's my turn to clean up today.

299
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,180
I'll be the one going. Please rest.

300
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:23,280
<i>Today's activity is to teach you how to beg for salvation.</i>

301
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,220
<i>from hurting your friend's heart, or...</i>

302
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,300
<i>when you don't recognize God's grace and kindness.</i>

303
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,820
<i>It is hard to have a heart that easily forgives.</i>

304
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,380
<i>But Jesus,</i>

305
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:42,680
- <i>He is forgiving, even for repeating sinners.</i>
- Jae Hyuk, there are a few days left now.

306
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,320
You just might receive an innocent verdict during the trial,

307
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,020
but there might also be a problem in court. If so, just plead guilty.

308
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,340
But, Jae Hyuk...

309
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,980
You've worked hard.

310
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,880
Huge problem.

311
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,460
Uncle...

312
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,560
- Uncle Seagull..
- What? You surprised me.

313
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,180
What?

314
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,440
This kid is quite good. No one saw you, right?

315
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,980
Let's sing!

316
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,660
Let's finish it.

317
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,040
How stupid.

318
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,520
Ah, why hasn't he arrived yet?

319
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,440
I was planning to make a nice scene...

320
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,240
Ah, you shouldn't have gone this far.

321
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,240
- You're my favorite person.
- Me too...

322
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:19,660
But since it's almost time to go home, you have to go back now.

323
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:49,640
Looks like our friend Porter won't be eating dinner.

324
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,640
In life, there will always be that kind of moment.

325
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,500
Where have you been, Athlete Kim? We don't really have that much time left together.

326
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
What are you doing? Why didn't you enter straightaway?

327
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:33,320
They say today's dinner is Donkatsu, I can finally taste such dish here.

328
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,900
Have I finally held this knife after so long?

329
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,400
Quick, sit down.

330
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,280
Search! Alley seven!

331
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,700
Search!

332
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,580
Search and make sure you don't miss anything!

333
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,080
You there! Out!

334
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:16,240
Check everything meticulously from the head to toe!

335
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:36,600
One won't know when it'll be conducted, this is an activity done since last year.

336
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,440
If they find you out, you'll receive punishment 30 times as hard. It's as if you wished for a death row.

337
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,740
Since you'll be out in two days, you'll surely get away with this.

338
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,860
Anyhow, what a perfect timing.

339
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,120
Isn't it as if someone tipped that Seagull has a knife with him?

340
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,540
That's impossible. The officers and other prisoners wouldn't have known.

341
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,840
That's just because Seagull has a very bad luck.

342
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:52,280
By the way, this Donkatsu... why are we always short of it?

343
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,320
Of course, no one would give me more even if I ask for more, right?

344
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,500
Uncles...

345
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,420
Do you want me to add more Donkatsu?

346
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,700
Thank you.

347
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:21,340
Don't mention it. Compared to you who saved me from getting fired, this is really nothing.

348
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,360
But how did you know?

349
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,960
Aside from the Chief, no one else knows that schedule.

350
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,980
I saw it in Officer Choi's calendar.

351
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,580
Excuse me, but, may I have just a cup of coffee?

352
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,620
I'd even give you a hundred if you ask. Please wait a moment.

353
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,620
[Inspection]

354
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
Wait a minute.

355
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:31,900
There's nothing else I can say. Thank you for helping me out.

356
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,340
- Because I...
- I didn't do it because of you.

357
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,040
Hey!

358
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,820
Hey, Kim Jae Hyuk!

359
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,360
2300, Kim Jae Hyuk.

360
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,400
Come out.

361
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:17,640
- I need to sleep.
- I told you to stop making a fuss, didn't I?

362
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:22,680
Finish one thing at a time. Don't you have any goals?

363
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,320
How did you know about the inspection ?

364
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,880
I saw it when I signed a paper in the officer's room.

365
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,900
Did Porter look sad?

366
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,060
You helped him because Seagull harassed him, didn't you?

367
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,040
Porter, that person is as sly as anybody else, he's honestly nothing different.

368
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,560
That is true. Why don't you know people's personality?

369
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:24,700
Please, just shut up. Why are you suddenly so bothered by other people's business?

370
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,180
I did. That's not because of him.

371
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,720
I wanted to be like that, too.

372
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,660
I want to live peacefully to the point that I don't have to say anything.

373
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,680
But how am I supposed to stay still and not saying anything?

374
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,140
- Why couldn't you?
- Because he is a rapist.

375
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,660
Seagull, he's a rapist.

376
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,640
How could I stay still? How am I supposed to stay still, goddamn it?!

377
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,180
If I think of my sister.

378
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,140
That kind of person...

379
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,500
I'll definitely kill him.

380
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,740
<i>[Kal Dae Bong; Rape.]</i>

381
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,000
One more day left.

382
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,080
Tomorrow...

383
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,180
is the most important day in my life.

384
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,020
Please bear with it just one more day.

385
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,140
Okay.

386
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:51,720
Officer, Porter! There's a dead body here!

387
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,980
- Officer!
- Hey, Please breathe! Dong Ho!

388
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,700
<i>- Officer, over! There's a patient who stopped breathing here, over.</i> - Dong Ho.

389
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:06,840
Attention, we request for help. There's an unconscious patient over here. We need help.

390
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:13,200
- What's wrong?
- I don't know what's happening too, but please don't call the ambulance yet.

391
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,700
One...

392
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,880
Two...

393
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,620
What's this? Is this kid for real?

394
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,300
Dong Ho, Wake up, Damn it!

395
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,500
Dong Ho! Damn it.

396
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,080
Hey, call the ambulance, and wait in the waiting room. Do it now!!

397
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,700
Hey, hey, Dong Ho, wake up!

398
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,320
What are you doing? Please open this, now.

399
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,720
Hey! Dong Ho!

400
00:45:58,900 --> 00:45:59,960
Hey!

401
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,040
Hey, Damn it! Don't joke around! You have to wake up soon!

402
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,260
You crazy bastard!

403
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:16,100
What are you doing? Carry him, hurry!

404
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,280
Get out of my way!

405
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,340
Ah, I got goosebumps.

406
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,500
<i>Half of the month passed by already..</i>

407
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:51,060
<i>Don't you guys feel like this month passed by too quickly?</i>

408
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,020
No.

409
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,880
The days feel slow and long.

410
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,880
<i>Have you done something good and met someone nice today?</i>

411
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,840
<i>I mean, What's the point of being nice person?</i>

412
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,580
<i>To each of his own, but I think the good side of being nice depends on ourselves..</i>

413
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:20,500
Officer Lee isn't home yet.

414
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,500
Ah, I thought of going home now.

415
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,040
<i>People's judgment isn't really important</i>

416
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,800
<i>Respect those you see every day and those who are always there for you.</i>

417
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,500
<i>Prejudice and stereotype,</i>

418
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:47,080
<i>These two words are among many that they hate the most.</i>

419
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,520
<i>The closing song today...</i>

420
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,600
<i>Toi song - Good Person.</i>

421
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,200
Chief Jo, here.

422
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,840
Thank you, Officer Lee.

423
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:03,180
You've worked hard today.

424
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,400
We all worked hard.

425
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,080
I almost beat him while I'm on my duty.

426
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,560
He added so much unfortunate things in my life.

427
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,020
Officer Lee, remember this.

428
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:23,940
Don't avoid problems and don't trust people easily especially those you meet on duty.

429
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,920
Because all of those are just excuses.

430
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,900
Officer Lee, I always give the same advice to people I care for like my own brother.

431
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,140
Ah, the coffee is sweet.

432
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:42,580
Officer Lee, the more I see it, you seem like a nice person.

433
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,080
Oh? You worked overtime last night.

434
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,080
I have to work hard.

435
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,080
Of course.

436
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,060
Because today is Athlete Kim Jae Hyuk's last day, you must want to see him.

437
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,200
- Law Man is here, isn't he?
- Ah, he is.

438
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,400
He's there.

439
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:42,320
But whatever happens, you have to take care of this. Because you are not allowed to wear other outfits.

440
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,940
I will wash the clothes and prepare food for you, you can wear this.

441
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,820
Hey, Law Man.

442
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,800
You're free, go pack your stuffs.

443
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,120
- Are you doing something? Go follow me.
- But...

444
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:04,060
- May I ask for a little more time please?
- What bullshit is that? There's no time left, go follow me.

445
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,400
Hey!

446
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,220
That... But Jae Hyuk...

447
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,980
Thank... you.

448
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:51,500
Ah, Jae Hyuk... thank you very much.

449
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,340
My mother is still alive thanks to you.

450
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,920
Honestly I...

451
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,980
I am scared I could actually lose my mother.

452
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:07,260
If my mother ever leaves this world...

453
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,560
My life will fall apart.

454
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,240
I don't think I will ever have the desire to be alive as well.

455
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,540
Jae Hyuk, I really thank you.

456
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,420
I.. I really need to go this time, no...

457
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,460
I really want to go.

458
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,820
In my entire life...

459
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,380
I never said thank you for a long time.

460
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,520
And... in my entire life...

461
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,360
I have never received such help and support.

462
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,420
My heart is really breaking into pieces...

463
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,040
I don't know how to explain this feeling.

464
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,120
What I have said, I really feel sorry...

465
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,740
I will be with you forever from now on.

466
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:01,880
Hey!

467
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,440
Jae Hyuk...

468
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,740
You have to win...

469
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,180
You should join the Major League and succeed there.

470
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,840
Thank you.

471
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,200
I put something on the window.

472
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,840
That's my gift for you.

473
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:46,820
<i>There are many concerns directed to the ongoing trial after the abuse case of Kim Jae Hyuk...</i>

474
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,280
 <i>Tomorrow, at 11 am, there will be a second trial for Professional Baseball athlete Kim Jae Hyuk...</i>

475
00:52:52,660 --> 00:53:00,600
<i>Last January, he was sentenced for one year in prison by the court, and caused some unending controversies.</i>

476
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:05,240
<i>In the second trial, we will see the progress that the court will be presenting...</i>

477
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:09,280
Oh, Reporter Choi. Of course, I have completed all of it.

478
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:13,140
Only the insiders and court officers will be able to see this

479
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,560
That's why, send this tomorrow morning.

480
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,580
What?

481
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:24,200
Ah, What do you mean with that...

482
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,320
You've done your best. You've worked hard...

483
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,320
See you soon.

484
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:03,420
We finally see that tunnel, that means we're a bit closer.

485
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:08,260
It's cloudy, it looks like it's gonna rain.

486
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:16,960
People said that rain right before a trial is a bad sign. We really need to be careful when we arrive there.

487
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:21,280
- Thank you.
- Good Luck, Kim Jae Hyuk.

488
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,500
He's here!

489
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,860
Kim Jae Hyuk-ssi, do you accept all of those charges?

490
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:05,560
- Kim Jae Hyuk, do you have your own proof?
- What do you think about that, Mr. Kim Jae Hyuk?

491
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,980
Mr. Kim Jae Hyuk, your statement please.

492
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:11,140
- Please give us your statement.
- Mr. Kim Jae Hyuk.

493
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:20,020
<i>Today at 11, Kim Jae Hyuk trial has started...</i>

494
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:25,020
<i>Are we going to see the same result today, after seeing the victim's condition?</i>

495
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:33,080
<i>Because Kim Jae Hyuk's lawyers are very confident, people are all waiting to hear what they have wished all this time.</i>

496
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:38,320
Damn it, we still need to see the result?

497
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,720
I'm going to destroy their trial if they don't have the results.

498
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,680
- Why is it not out yet?
- I heard he couldn't sleep last night.

499
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,300
Don't you think he look the same?

500
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,340
Why wouldn't he enter the room already?

501
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,080
Everybody please stand up.

502
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:33,540
<i>We are going to start the trial for suspect number 2017/187.</i>

503
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,460
<i>First, suspect Kim Jae Hyuk,</i>

504
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:43,920
<i>He ran for the person who raped his sister, then he beat that person defending both of him and his sister.</i>

505
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:54,000
<i>But he didn't stop at that, he kept chasing his victim.</i>

506
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,340
<i>The main issue here, he beat him with fatal means, which was a trophy.</i>

507
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:02,540
<i>And because of that, the victim is now in a critical condition...</i>

508
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:06,880
<i>He did intensive treatment but now he suffers from extreme brain death.</i>

509
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:17,680
<i>Because of Kim Jae Hyuk's severe rage and violence, the victim is requesting to do some evaluation and postpone the trial today.</i>

510
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:25,360
<i>In the end, this self defense is regarded exceeding the limit itself.</i>

511
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:32,960
<i>Because he is already doing his punishment, an appeal against his sentence would not be considered.</i>

512
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:46,820
<i>Meanwhile, the Korean Baseball committee announced that there will be an immediate meeting between KBO Baseball association and...</i>

513
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:51,080
<i>Fans are no different.</i>

514
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:57,060
<i>Kim Jae Hyuk's fans who plead him free of charge were all shocked.</i>

515
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:07,560
<i>Boston side were expressing their disappointment while waiting for the results of the trial and</i>

516
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,640
<i>Nexen Heroes is not even able to predict what's going to happen.</i>

517
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:14,740
How can I meet Athlete Kim Jae Hyuk now?

518
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,340
But Professor Myung isn't going back, right?

519
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,380
Yes, You're right.

520
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:25,960
So what's actually the reason of this all?

521
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:31,800
People who did fraud to others for almost 7 million won can easily be freed from prison, but a person who literally saved her sister from a rapist couldn't.

522
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:35,660
I really don't know how this world works.

523
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:43,760
Only those who have power will be able to live peacefully.

524
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:00,700
Why is Officer Lee not back yet? I need to do the shift.

525
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:46,920
He has a separate room, until we're done with the prison cleaning, I have prepared a different room for you.

526
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:53,040
No worries, Officer. I don't want to make you busy, I am fine with the previous room I used to have.

527
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,700
Okay then, if you need something, please let me know.

528
01:02:56,860 --> 01:03:02,600
So compared to other prisoners, don't you think we should treat Athlete Kim with special treatment?

529
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,180
If so...

530
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:11,520
- May I ask for help? I promise only this time..
- What's that? Sure.

531
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:17,400
- I haven't done my exercise today, can I do some exercise?
- Exercise?

532
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,760
Of course.

533
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,720
- Thank you.
- Ah but...

534
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,940
It's....

535
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:51,000
That kid, what is he doing now...

536
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:31,880
- I'm fine.
- I'm not fine.

537
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,100
Let's go.

538
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,500
- Change your clothes with mine and go out...
- And...

539
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,520
Killing a person?

540
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:25,100
After running away, who should I kill?

541
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,820
Shall I kill the judge?

542
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:34,540
Or shall I kill that brain-dead person?

543
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:39,680
My life is a mess now, who should I blame?

544
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,620
It's okay.

545
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:48,680
Finally I have time to rest in my life.

546
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,680
But is that published in the news?

547
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,160
All day long.

548
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:05,420
- The news about you was published all day long.
- Not my news.

549
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:17,640
Reporter Choi, why didn't you receive my call?

550
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,220
Ah damn...

551
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:28,160
His number is active...

552
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:42,400
Oh?

553
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,060
A private room.

554
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,760
Oh, you look so happy.

555
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:49,480
Nice.

556
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,480
I like it.

557
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:22,420
<i>Athlete Kim Jae Hyuk that got sentenced in Seoul Western District Prison for attacking a man will be in trial today.</i>

558
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:27,700
<i>Even though suspicions raised up, his sentence has been upgraded to one year in prison.</i>

559
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:33,060
Published all day, all day. Here and there.

560
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:34,900
Hey, don't turn it off!

561
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:38,820
Published all day, all day. Here and there.

562
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:43,740
Hey, don't turn it off! This man, news reports should be watched until end.

563
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:05,420
Why are you coming just now?

564
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,480
Sorry.

565
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:19,120
<i>Moreover, just like his popularity, this prison is being the center of interest now.</i>

566
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:26,600
<i>Based on the officer, there are no special treatments for him, just like other prisoners.</i>

567
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:02,140
Hey, Officer Lee. Come here and let's watch together. There's an interesting news coming out.

568
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:12,760
<i>The continuation of the revealing case in public service...</i>

569
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:19,000
<i>The officer with a job that to serve prisoners, it was revealed that he is illegally giving them supplies.</i>

570
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:22,060
<i>Our KBC staff is preparing for further information.</i>

571
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:27,620
<i>This is the CCTV footage from Western Prison a while ago.</i>

572
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:34,840
<i>This video shows how he swaps cigarette with a T-Money card as their money in prison.</i>

573
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:41,440
<i>That's the T-Money card that we can buy easily.</i>

574
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:46,660
<i>That officer gives cigarette to the prisoners and in exchange, they have to give him a T-Money card.</i>

575
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:49,780
Shouldn't that be the camera's blind spot? What happened?

576
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:53,100
Someone must have fixed it already.

577
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:06,940
Alright, take some rest! Will there be a ghost attaching your body if you don't work out?

578
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:10,700
Hey, I have this.

579
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,300
Hey, where did you get this from? If you bring this, you'll get in trouble.

580
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,420
- Give it to me!
- No! The situation is not good now!

581
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,740
Hold on for a little bit, I'll give it to you in two days.

582
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:23,880
Okay.

583
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,860
Alright, I'll throw it once. Just once.

584
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:35,580
Where will you throw it?

585
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,160
Outside? You'll just throw it carelessly?

586
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,160
Really?

587
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,240
So...

588
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:49,300
I'll let you see how my pitch used to be.

589
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,420
I failed.

590
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,720
Ah, what a crazy person.

591
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:23,280
<i>The officer that's been caught on camera won't be able to avoid the penalty for three days, and this case has been sent to the court.</i>

592
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:28,620
<i>Meanwhile that officer was also caught doing the same thing to the prisoners' family.</i>

593
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:30,560
Ah, it's okay.

594
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:37,020
Don't worry, this is a place for people to live, too.

595
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:40,800
I'll keep it well.

596
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,520
Even though I've thought to keep it well.

597
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,620
The salary for an officer here is certain already.

598
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:54,040
Even though your heart wanted to do something good, in fact you can't do anything.

599
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:01,060
Besides, it's almost winter. I want to give something. But still everything is all about money.

600
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,840
Ah, I forgot to bring cash.

601
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:11,220
- Excuse me, where's the place to take money?
- Over there.

602
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:17,860
Please take care of my child for a little bit.

603
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:21,980
Please don't worry, just go. I'll be waiting for you here.

604
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,300
Let go.

605
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:03,860
How could the reporters know about that?

606
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:09,180
I'm not sure...
 Isn't he a prison guard?

607
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:16,040
<i>The citizens are demanding countermeasures and prevention so this action will not happen again.</i>

608
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:20,620
<i>Lee Joon Dol from KBC reporting from South Detention Center.</i>

609
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:24,040
Ah, what's your job?

610
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,900
I'm a reporter.

611
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:33,340
I'm a daily reporter.
Field reporter.

612
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:42,260
May I give you a present?

613
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,240
Jae Hyuk.

614
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,120
Don't worry.

615
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:11,260
You're gonna win the trial.

616
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:14,740
Because justice still exists.

617
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:21,640
One day, maybe if God gives His hand, and we'll met again coincidentally...

618
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:25,280
At that time, I'll buy you the most expensive ice cream.

619
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:29,440
For now, this is my only treasure.

620
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,240
I'm fine.

621
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:23,840
Please tell Mother and Je Hee, that I'll move away, so they don't need to come here.

622
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,260
Because probably it would be unavailing.

623
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:34,160
I've also thought about several things.

624
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,640
Maybe I couldn't come out from here...

625
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:41,120
...I also thought about that.

626
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,520
I am fine.

627
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:48,020
Seriously.

628
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,260
Really?

629
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:56,900
Are you sure that you're fine?

630
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:01,440
I said, are you sure that you're fine?

631
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:05,800
You can end up rotting in jail for one year, and if that's the case, will it be fine?

632
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,480
You already signed contract with the Major, is it still fine?

633
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,400
I said, are you sure that you're fine?
You already signed contract with the Major, is it still fine?

634
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:10,480
I said, are you sure that you're fine?

635
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,640
Ah, it sucks!

636
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:16,600
Ah it sucks, damn it!

637
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:41,780
I'm home.

638
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:48,620
Is my son doing okay?

639
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:53,880
- I'm sure his heart is aching.
- His face and expression was fine.

640
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,880
It's better than I thought.

641
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:00,120
You know what kind of person he is.

642
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,240
- You sure?
- Of course.

643
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:08,340
He is just like what I thought.
 I think he's doing better now.

644
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:11,100
Then, please don't worry too much.

645
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:16,660
Don't go visit him too often. School will start soon.

646
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:19,620
It's okay, after all I'm happy to go there.

647
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:25,560
Mother, living in Seoul is not that bad right? Although there's not much good restaurants compared to Gwangju, but people still live well.

648
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,540
Living with Je Hee is also fine, so we can eat home made food everyday.

649
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:37,100
Ah please say something, I'm really worried.

650
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:44,200
I already told you, he's doing fine.

651
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,360
You know his personality, too.

652
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:49,560
He is really fine, he is just worried about you.

653
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,960
Ah really, just live with him then.

654
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:53,200
I also want to have a brother who can be trusted like that.
Ah really, just live with him then.

655
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:56,320
I also want to have a brother who can be trusted like that.

656
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:06,960
Ah that's not what I meant. Jae Hee, he is truly fine, he is okay.

657
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:11,340
Ah, I already said to you, he is like a bear, I bet he already forgot the incident.

658
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:13,240
Ah, Jae Hee.

659
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,700
In a time like this, it would be good to go outside, right?

660
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:24,480
I thought that he would lose hope and spirit. If I were him, I would be like that, but Kim Jae Hyuk is different for sure...

661
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,560
...he is just doing his usual daily things, he exercised and practiced.

662
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:31,800
If so, then just get prepared, eat and then shower, get ready to work.

663
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:35,860
You're sure he's alright?

664
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:40,640
- Absolutely. He's fine. Don't you know who Kim Jae Hyuk is?
- A man who never gives up.

665
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:46,740
In 2005...

666
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,620
He got into an accident and his shoulder got broken.

667
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:53,040
Other people will think that life, everything is already ending, but..

668
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,480
It was like he died and was brought back to life. 

669
01:18:55,480 --> 01:19:01,780
He truly is.. whether it is rain or snow that pours, he kept doing his exercise and treatments straightaway.

670
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,980
And after that, three years later in 2008...

671
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:08,280
Finally he joined the rest of the Heroes team...

672
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:11,420
It doesn't make sense, as if it was just like a war.

673
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:16,940
Although there were a lot a great athletes, and he was standing in the last position...

674
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:25,840
He won over more than those 10 great athletes...

675
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:29,460
And after that the world held back on him, but...

676
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:38,000
The most important thing is that between those failures and trials, he was never disappointed and blamed himself...

677
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:24,240
Although my life has several events which ached my heart, but my body never got hurt...

678
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:29,340
The man who always smiled with confidence even during difficulties, is Kim Jae Hyuk.

679
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:36,580
- Even if the country cursed on him, he'll stay fine. Like that?
- Kim Jae Hyuk is the wisest person ever, different from you, you're someone worthless.

680
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:46,240
Athlete Kim Jae Hyuk, today there's an event at the church. You won't come, will you?

681
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,380
- You can just stay in the room.
- But I'll go there.

682
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:10,580
<i>Dear my beloved family...</i>

683
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:18,660
<i>Jesus will keep you in His blessing if you want to live with kindness.</i>

684
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:22,000
- Amen.
- Amen.

685
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:24,080
Alright, and next...

686
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:30,140
We will sing our pride song, number 338, together.

687
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:35,160
Today, a band from University of Cheonwon will accompany us all.

688
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:13,000
You fucker!

689
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:16,400
Fuck!!!

690
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:21,460
You fucker! Are you fucking satisfied?!

691
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,280
You fucker!!!

692
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,060
Kim Jae Hyuk is really pitiful, what to do about this?

693
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:02,240
What else can we do? We can just visit him often.

694
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,960
But until when is he going to stay here?

695
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:11,120
- He must be going out soon, right?
- Hey, even us know nothing about our punishment, nor about his.

696
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:14,480
If only he was here right now, then we will know certainly.

697
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:20,900
Even the sudden inspection, he already knew that beforehand, and maybe things related to himself, he must know it already.

698
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:23,460
What do you mean?

699
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,380
The truth about why Seagull get punished...

700
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:29,640
Kim Jae Hyuk is the one who snitched about it.

701
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:34,140
He told me first, I matched the timing and successfully got away.

702
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:40,220
- Ah, damn, justice still exists.
- Really?

703
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:45,120
Wow, amazing. How did he know about it?

704
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:21,200
Athlete Kim Jae Hyuk...

705
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,700
Today one person will come...

706
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,200
Just rest.

707
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,260
Is your body okay?

708
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,420
You, die!

709
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:04,180
