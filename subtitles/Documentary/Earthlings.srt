00:00:00,857 --> 00:00:03,778
The images you are about to
see are not isolated cases.

00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:06,799
These are the Industry Standard
for animals bred as Pets,

00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,184
Food, Clothing, for
Entertainment and Research.

00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:13,905
Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:19,163 --> 00:00:22,596
THE THREE STAGES OF
TRUTH

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,700
1. RIDICULE

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,200
2. VIOLENT OPPOSITION

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,700
3. ACCEPTANCE

9
00:00:53,298 --> 00:01:00,653
EARTHLINGS

10
00:01:22,185 --> 00:01:29,685
earth'ling: n.
One who inhabits of the earth.

11
00:01:31,578 --> 00:01:38,138
Since we all inhabit the earth,
all of us are considered earthlings.

12
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:43,823
There is no sexism, no racism or
speciesism in the term earthling.

13
00:01:43,824 --> 00:01:46,500
It encompasses each and every one of us:

14
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:51,095
warm or cold blooded, mammal,
vertebrate or invertebrate,

15
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:55,812
bird, reptile, amphibian, fish,
and human alike.

16
00:01:57,529 --> 00:02:00,767
Humans, therefore, being not the
only species on the planet,

17
00:02:00,768 --> 00:02:07,579
share this world with millions of other living
creatures, as we all evolve here together.

18
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,382
However, it is the human earthling
who tends to dominate the earth,

19
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:16,387
often times treating other fellow earthlings
and living beings as mere objects.

20
00:02:16,388 --> 00:02:18,547
This is what is meant by speciesism.

21
00:02:18,548 --> 00:02:21,268
FESTIVAL OF THE BULLS, SPAIN

22
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,917
By analogy with racism and sexism,
the term "speciesism" is a prejudice

23
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:29,250
or attitude of bias
in favor of the interests

24
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:35,058
of members of one's own species and
against those of members of other species.

25
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:37,966
If a being suffers there can be
no moral justification for

26
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:41,295
refusing to take that
suffering into consideration.

27
00:02:41,296 --> 00:02:46,035
No matter what the nature of the
being, the principle of equality requires

28
00:02:46,036 --> 00:02:54,436
that one's suffering can be counted equally
with the like suffering of any other being.

29
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,842
Racists violate the principle of
equality by giving greater eight

30
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:13,574
to the interests of members

31
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:17,054
of their own race when
their is a clash between their

32
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:22,175
interests and the interests
of those of another race.

33
00:03:26,271 --> 00:03:30,937
Sexists violate the principle of
equality by favoring

34
00:03:30,938 --> 00:03:33,978
the interests of their own sex.

35
00:03:40,194 --> 00:03:47,033
Similarly, speciesists allow
the interests of their own species

36
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:53,337
to override the greater interests
of members of other species.

37
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:59,393
In each case, the pattern is identical.

38
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:11,902
Though among the members of the human family
we recognize the moral imperative of respect

39
00:04:11,903 --> 00:04:15,187
(every human is a somebody, not a something),

40
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,472
morally disrespectful treatment occurs
when those who stand at the power end of a

41
00:04:18,473 --> 00:04:25,353
power relationship treat the less powerful
as if they were mere objects.

42
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:32,253
The rapist does this to the victim of rape.

43
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:35,690
The child molester
to the child molested.

44
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:38,249
The master to the slave.

45
00:04:38,673 --> 00:04:45,594
In each and all such cases, humans who
have power exploit those who lack it.

46
00:04:45,595 --> 00:04:53,115
Might the same be true of how humans
treat other animals, or other earthlings?

47
00:04:54,109 --> 00:04:56,187
Undoubtedly there are differences,

48
00:04:56,188 --> 00:05:01,868
since humans and animals are
not the same in all respects.

49
00:05:03,421 --> 00:05:08,061
But the question of sameness
wears another face.

50
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:15,869
Granted, these animals do not have
all the desires we humans have;

51
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,111
granted, they do not comprehend
everything we humans comprehend;

52
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,965
nevertheless, we and they do have
some of the same desires

53
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:26,711
and do comprehend some of the same things.

54
00:05:26,712 --> 00:05:31,483
The desires for food and water,
shelter and companionship,

55
00:05:31,484 --> 00:05:34,718
freedom of movement
and avoidance of pain?

56
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:40,639
these desires are shared by
nonhuman animals and human beings.

57
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:44,795
As for comprehension: like humans,

58
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:49,787
many nonhuman animals understand the
world in which they live and move.

59
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:52,988
Otherwise, they could not survive.

60
00:05:54,902 --> 00:05:59,782
So beneath the many differences,
there is sameness.

61
00:06:00,915 --> 00:06:06,810
Like us, these animals embody the
mystery and wonder of consciousness.

62
00:06:06,811 --> 00:06:11,529
Like us, they are not only in the world,
they are aware of it.

63
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:18,229
Like us they are the psychological
centers of a life that is uniquely their own.

64
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,884
In these fundamental respects humans
stand "on all fours", so to speak,

65
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:26,746
with hogs and cows,
chickens and turkeys.

66
00:06:26,747 --> 00:06:30,764
What these animals are due from us,
how we morally ought to treat them,

67
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,185
are questions whose answer begins
with the recognition of our

68
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:37,146
psychological kinship with them.

69
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:40,637
So the following film demonstrates

70
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:45,044
in five ways just how animals
have come to serve mankind

71
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:48,856
...lest we forget.

72
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:05,718
Nobel Prize winner Isaac Bashevis Singer
wrote in his bestselling novel

73
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:08,974
'Enemies, A Love Story' the following:

74
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:13,643
"As often has Herman had witnessed
the slaughter of animals and fish,

75
00:07:13,644 --> 00:07:17,911
he always had the same thought:
in their behavior toward creatures,

76
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:22,542
all men were Nazis. The smugness with
which man could do with other species

77
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:26,891
as he pleased exemplified the most
extreme racist theories,

78
00:07:26,892 --> 00:07:30,252
the principle that might is right".

79
00:07:32,837 --> 00:07:37,997
The comparison here to the holocaust
is both intentional and obvious:

80
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:43,334
one group of living beings anguishes beneath
the hands of another.

81
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:46,725
Though some will argue the suffering
of animals cannot possibly compare

82
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:52,483
with that of former Jews or slaves,
there is, in fact, a parallel.

83
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:58,027
And for the prisoners and victims
of this mass murder, their holocaust

84
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:00,277
is far from over.

85
00:08:17,885 --> 00:08:22,769
In his book 'The Outermost House'
author Henry Beston wrote

86
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,229
"We need another and a wiser
and perhaps a more mystical

87
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,070
concept of animals.

88
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,882
Remote from universal nature,
and living by complicated artifice,

89
00:08:34,883 --> 00:08:36,682
man in civilization surveys

90
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:41,323
the creatures through
the glass of his knowledge

91
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:46,644
and sees thereby a feather magnified
and the whole image in distortion.

92
00:08:46,645 --> 00:08:49,412
We patronize them for their incompleteness,

93
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:55,087
for their tragic fate of having taken
form so far below ourselves.

94
00:08:55,088 --> 00:08:58,608
And therein we err, and greatly err.

95
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:04,330
For the animal
shall not be measured by man.

96
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:08,219
In a world older and
more complete than ours

97
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,260
they move finished and complete,

98
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:20,448
gifted with extensions of the senses
we have lost or never attained,

99
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:26,201
living by voices we shall never hear.

100
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:35,796
They are not brethren;
they are not underlings;

101
00:09:37,523 --> 00:09:39,763
they are other nations,

102
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:45,276
caught with ourselves
in the net of life and time,

103
00:09:45,277 --> 00:09:50,957
fellow prisoners of the splendor
and travail of the earth".

104
00:09:56,148 --> 00:09:59,412
PART ONE: PETS

105
00:10:01,162 --> 00:10:07,941
For most of us, our relationship with animals
involves the owning of a pet or two.

106
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:11,062
So where do our pets come from?

107
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:19,615
Of course, one of the most obvious ways
animals serve man is as companions.

108
00:10:20,314 --> 00:10:22,178
BREEDERS

109
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:28,172
For these pets it starts with a breeder,
though not all breeders are considered professional.

110
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:32,948
In fact, in this profession, just about anyone
and everyone can be a breeder.

111
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:35,509
PET STORES AND PUPPY MILLS

112
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:41,016
For pet stores, most of their animals
are acquired from puppy mills,

113
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:43,977
even if they may not know it.

114
00:10:47,443 --> 00:10:49,340
Puppy mills are low-budget

115
00:10:49,341 --> 00:10:56,781
commercial enterprises that breed dogs
for sale to pet shops and other buyers.

116
00:11:04,682 --> 00:11:07,404
They are often backyard operations

117
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:16,205
that expose animals to filthy, overcrowded
conditions with no veterinary care or socialization.

118
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,856
Dogs from puppy mills often exhibit

119
00:11:20,857 --> 00:11:25,817
physical and psychological
problems as they grow up.

120
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:29,188
STRAYS

121
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:34,613
Strays, if they are lucky,
will be picked up and taken to a

122
00:11:34,614 --> 00:11:41,334
shelter or pound, where they
can only hope to find a new home again.

123
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:51,330
An estimated 25 million animals become
homeless every year.

124
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:59,749
And as many as 27% of purebred dogs
are among the homeless.

125
00:12:11,872 --> 00:12:15,673
Of these 25 million homeless animals
an average of 9 million

126
00:12:15,674 --> 00:12:18,794
die on the streets from disease,

127
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:21,313
starvation,

128
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:25,084
exposure,

129
00:12:26,217 --> 00:12:30,537
injury, or some other hazard
of street life.

130
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:36,939
Many others are strays, some of whom were
presumably dumped in the streets by their caretakers

131
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,072
The remaining 16 million
die in pounds or shelters that have no

132
00:12:41,073 --> 00:12:45,233
room for them and are forced to kill them.

133
00:12:51,175 --> 00:12:53,128
Sadly, on top of all this,

134
00:12:53,129 --> 00:13:00,809
almost 50% of the animals brought to
shelters are turned in by their caretakers.

135
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:08,863
Many people claim they don't visit shelters
because it's depressing for them.

136
00:13:08,864 --> 00:13:13,870
But the reason animals are crowded
into such dreary places as these,

137
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:19,654
is because of people's refusal
to spay or neuter their pets.

138
00:13:19,655 --> 00:13:23,867
Several pet owners feel,
particularly men for some reason,

139
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:28,988
that neutering a pet
emasculates the owner somehow ...

140
00:13:29,688 --> 00:13:39,048
... or they may just want their children to someday
experience the "miracle of life", so to speak.

141
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:51,672
In either case, pet owners like these
unknowingly take part in the euthanasia

142
00:13:51,673 --> 00:13:54,793
of over 60,000 animals per day.

143
00:13:57,306 --> 00:14:03,893
Euthanasia, generally defined as the act
of killing painlessly for reasons of mercy,

144
00:14:03,894 --> 00:14:08,222
is usually administered by
an injection in the leg for dogs,

145
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:11,983
and sometimes in the
stomach for cats.

146
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:24,411
It is a quick and painless procedure for
the animals, and by far the most humane,

147
00:14:24,412 --> 00:14:27,772
but not always the most affordable.

148
00:14:30,766 --> 00:14:33,877
Due to the increase of
euthanasia in shelters,

149
00:14:33,878 --> 00:14:38,137
and the growing, constant,
demand for drugs like Euthasol,

150
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:45,418
some shelters with budget constraints
are forced to use gas chambers instead.

151
00:14:47,004 --> 00:14:48,204
GAS CHAMBERS

152
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:52,312
In a gas chamber,
animals are packed very tightly

153
00:14:52,313 --> 00:14:56,633
and can take as long as
20 minutes to die.

154
00:15:07,993 --> 00:15:10,873
It is, by far, less merciful,

155
00:15:11,052 --> 00:15:13,612
more traumatic and painful.

156
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:18,008
But the procedure is less expensive.

157
00:15:25,912 --> 00:15:29,691
Perhaps some of the tough questions
we should ask ourselves about animals

158
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:32,732
that we keep as companions are:

159
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:37,434
Can we keep animals as companions
and still address their needs?

160
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:40,578
Is our keeping companion animals
in their best interest,

161
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:43,054
or are we exploiting them?

162
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:48,544
The answers to these questions may lie
in the attitudes of the human caretakers

163
00:15:48,545 --> 00:15:55,505
and their abilities to provide suitable
environments for companion animals.

164
00:16:21,237 --> 00:16:24,442
(CYANIDE POISON)
Most human beings are speciesists.

165
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:28,856
This film shows that ordinary
human beings (not a few exceptionally

166
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:32,664
cruel or heartless humans, but the
overwhelming majority of people),

167
00:16:32,665 --> 00:16:36,725
take an active part in,
acquiesce in, and allow their taxes

168
00:16:36,726 --> 00:16:40,916
to pay for practices that require
the sacrifice of the most important

169
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:44,794
interests of members of other species,
in order to promote the most

170
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:48,315
trivial interests of our own species.

171
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:53,252
STRAY OVERPOPULATION IN TURKEY

172
00:17:00,094 --> 00:17:02,555
The hope for the animals of tomorrow is

173
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:09,036
to be found in a Human Culture
which learns to feel beyond itself.

174
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:18,886
We must learn empathy,

175
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:25,726
we must learn to see into the eyes

176
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:32,687
of an animal and feel that their
life has value because they are alive.

177
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:49,279
PART TWO: FOOD

178
00:17:51,934 --> 00:18:02,629
"Oh, I missed. I missed you, honey.
But I'll get you again!"

179
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:10,838
"I got you! Good boy!"

180
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:13,666
What happens in slaughterhouses

181
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:20,947
is a variation on the theme of the
exploitation of the weak by the strong.

182
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:35,110
More than ten thousand times a minute,

183
00:18:35,111 --> 00:18:39,820
in excess of six billion times a
year, just in the United States,

184
00:18:39,821 --> 00:18:44,737
life is literally
drained from so-called "food animals".

185
00:18:44,738 --> 00:18:49,270
Having the greater power,
humans decide when these animals will die,

186
00:18:49,271 --> 00:18:50,819
where they will die,

187
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,060
and how they will die.

188
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,946
The interests of these animals themselves

189
00:18:55,947 --> 00:19:01,341
play no role whatsoever
in the determination of their fate.

190
00:19:01,342 --> 00:19:05,441
Killing an animal is,
in itself, a troubling act.

191
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:07,378
It has been said that if we had

192
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:11,281
to kill our own meat, we
would all be vegetarians.

193
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:14,364
Certainly very few people
ever visit a slaughterhouse,

194
00:19:14,365 --> 00:19:19,085
and films of slaughterhouse operations
are not popular on television.

195
00:19:19,086 --> 00:19:24,868
People might hope that the meat they buy
came from an animal who died without pain,

196
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:27,695
but they don't really
want to know about it.

197
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:32,218
Yet those who, by their purchases,
require animals to be killed,

198
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:37,532
do not deserve to be shielded from this
or any other aspect of the production

199
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:39,372
of the meat they buy.

200
00:19:39,373 --> 00:19:42,653
So where does our food come from?

201
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:49,165
For those of us living on a meat diet,
the process these animals

202
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,486
undergoes is as follows.

203
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:53,921
BRANDING

204
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:01,283
For beef, the animals are all branded ...

205
00:20:01,494 --> 00:20:04,774
... in this instance, on the face.

206
00:20:07,657 --> 00:20:08,740
DEHORNING

207
00:20:10,784 --> 00:20:14,703
Dehorning usually follows.
Never with anesthetic.

208
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:18,064
But rather a large pair of pliers.

209
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:34,290
TRANSPORTATION

210
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:40,052
In transportation, animals are packed
so tightly into trucks, they are

211
00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:42,474
practically on top of one another.

212
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:47,115
Heat, freezing temperatures,
fatigue, trauma, and health conditions

213
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:51,312
will kill some of these animals
in route to the slaughterhouses.

214
00:20:51,313 --> 00:20:52,208
MILKING

215
00:20:54,189 --> 00:20:56,145
Milking cows are kept chained

216
00:20:56,146 --> 00:21:01,186
to their stalls all day
long, receiving no exercise.

217
00:21:01,572 --> 00:21:08,772
Pesticides and antibiotics are also
used to increase their milk productivity.

218
00:21:22,441 --> 00:21:28,601
Eventually, milking cows,
like this one, collapse from exhaustion.

219
00:21:29,064 --> 00:21:32,979
Normally, cows can live
as long as twenty years,

220
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,140
but milking cows
generally die within four.

221
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:42,828
At which point, their meat is
used for fast food restaurants.

222
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:44,375
MEAT

223
00:21:48,878 --> 00:21:50,087
At this slaughterhouse,

224
00:21:50,088 --> 00:21:54,346
the branded and dehorned
cattle are brought into a stall.

225
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,319
CAPTIVE BOLTS

226
00:21:57,181 --> 00:21:59,195
The captive bolt gun, which was designed

227
00:21:59,196 --> 00:22:03,996
to reduce animals unconscious
without causing pain,

228
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:09,920
fires a steel bolt, that is powered
by compressed air or a blank cartridge,

229
00:22:09,921 --> 00:22:12,114
right into the animal's brain.

230
00:22:12,115 --> 00:22:14,143
BLEEDING

231
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:22,556
Though various methods of slaughter
are used, in this Massachusetts facility,

232
00:22:22,557 --> 00:22:27,624
the cattle is hoisted up
and his or her throat is slit.

233
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:32,985
Along with the meat, their blood will
be used as well.

234
00:22:42,047 --> 00:22:46,007
Though the animal has received
a captive bolt to the head,

235
00:22:46,008 --> 00:22:48,508
which is supposed to have rendered him

236
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:54,909
or her senseless ... as you can see
the animal is still conscious.

237
00:22:54,943 --> 00:22:57,023
This is not uncommon.

238
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:01,551
Sometimes they are still alive
even after they have been bled,

239
00:23:01,552 --> 00:23:07,952
and are well on their way down
the assembly line to be butchered.

240
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:15,329
KNOCKING BOXES

241
00:23:52,466 --> 00:23:55,131
KOSHER SLAUGHTER

242
00:23:57,189 --> 00:24:01,828
This is the largest glatt kosher
meat plant in the United States.

243
00:24:01,829 --> 00:24:09,589
Glatt, the Yiddish word for "smooth",
means the highest standard of cleanliness ...

244
00:24:12,412 --> 00:24:18,172
... and rules for kosher
butchering require minimal suffering.

245
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:30,319
The use of electric prods
on immobilized animals is a violation.

246
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:34,521
SHEKHITA - RITUAL SLAUGHTER

247
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:40,774
Inverting frightened animals
for the slaughterer's convenience

248
00:24:40,775 --> 00:24:42,775
is also a violation.

249
00:24:48,922 --> 00:24:57,162
The inversion process causes cattle to
aspirate blood, or breath it in, after incision.

250
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:03,198
Ripping the trachea and esophagi
from their throats is another

251
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:07,881
egregious violation, since kosher
animals are not to be touched ...

252
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:10,580
... until bleeding stops.

253
00:25:23,262 --> 00:25:27,001
And by dumping struggling
and dying steers through metal chutes

254
00:25:27,002 --> 00:25:29,402
onto blood soaked floors,

255
00:25:30,301 --> 00:25:35,261
with their breathing tubes
and gullets dangling out,

256
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,920
this "sacred task" is neither
clean or compassionate.

257
00:25:46,392 --> 00:25:50,402
Shackling and hoisting is
ruled yet another violation,

258
00:25:50,403 --> 00:25:56,323
nor does it correspond to the
kosher way of treating animals.

259
00:25:56,632 --> 00:26:02,152
If this was kosher, death was
neither quick nor merciful.

260
00:26:03,527 --> 00:26:05,471
VEAL

261
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,448
Veal, taken from their mothers
within two days of birth, are tied

262
00:26:10,449 --> 00:26:15,893
at the neck and kept restricted
to keep muscles from developing.

263
00:26:15,894 --> 00:26:18,870
Fed an iron-deficient liquid diet,

264
00:26:18,871 --> 00:26:22,071
denied bedding,
water, and light,

265
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,630
after four months of this miserable
existence they are slaughtered.

266
00:26:26,631 --> 00:26:28,426
PIGS

267
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:35,447
Sows in factory farms are
breeding machines, kept

268
00:26:35,448 --> 00:26:40,323
continually pregnant by means
of artificial insemination.

269
00:26:40,324 --> 00:26:44,243
Large pig market factories
will "manufacture",

270
00:26:44,244 --> 00:26:51,444
as they like to call it, between 50,000
and 600,000 pigs a year... each.

271
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:53,492
FACTORY CONDITIONS

272
00:27:10,287 --> 00:27:13,606
GESTATION CRATES

273
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:25,500
RUPTURES & ABSCESSES

274
00:27:38,415 --> 00:27:43,057
CANIBALISM

275
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:09,008
WASTE PITS

276
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:35,478
Tail docking is a practice derived
from the lack of space and stressful

277
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:41,706
living conditions so as to keep pigs
from biting each other's tails off.

278
00:28:41,707 --> 00:28:44,188
This is done without anesthetic.

279
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,389
EAR CLIPPING

280
00:28:47,194 --> 00:28:54,074
Ear clipping is a similar procedure,
also administered without anesthetic.

281
00:29:03,817 --> 00:29:06,438
As well as teeth-cutting.

282
00:29:25,745 --> 00:29:27,908
CASTRATION

283
00:29:28,693 --> 00:29:33,309
Castration is also done without
painkillers or anesthetic, and will

284
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:37,790
supposedly produce a more
fatty grade of meat.

285
00:29:46,675 --> 00:29:48,186
ELECTRIC PRODS

286
00:29:49,868 --> 00:29:55,388
The electric prods are used for
obvious reasons: handling.

287
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,957
ELECTROCUTION

288
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:31,301
Electrocution is another method
of slaughter, as seen here.

289
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:36,233
THROAT SLITTING

290
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,235
Throat slitting, however,

291
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:43,276
is still the least expensive
way to kill an animal.

292
00:31:05,508 --> 00:31:09,382
BOILING AND HAIR REMOVAL

293
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:15,011
After knife sticking, pigs are shackled,

294
00:31:15,012 --> 00:31:21,810
suspended on a bleed-rail and immersed
in scalding tanks to remove their bristle.

295
00:31:21,811 --> 00:31:27,565
Many are still struggling as they are dunked
upside down in tanks of steaming water,

296
00:31:27,566 --> 00:31:31,086
where they are submerged and drowned.

297
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,683
POULTRY

298
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:17,851
In regard to poultry, Americans currently
consume as much chicken in a single day

299
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:21,692
as they did in an entire year in 1930.

300
00:32:24,785 --> 00:32:29,329
The largest broiler companies
in the world now slaughter more than

301
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,850
8.5 million birds in a single week.

302
00:32:43,515 --> 00:32:45,218
DEBEAKING

303
00:32:49,007 --> 00:32:53,423
Debeaking prevents feather-pecking
and cannibalism in frustrated chickens,

304
00:32:53,424 --> 00:33:02,144
caused by over-crowding in single areas, where
they are unable to establish a social order.

305
00:33:06,596 --> 00:33:11,675
Today, done with infant chicks,
the procedure is carried out very quickly,

306
00:33:11,676 --> 00:33:14,076
about 15 birds a minute.

307
00:33:14,121 --> 00:33:20,089
Such haste means the temperature and
sharpness of the blade varies, resulting in

308
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:24,450
sloppy cutting and serious
injury to the bird.

309
00:33:24,451 --> 00:33:26,051
LIVING CONDITIONS

310
00:33:26,661 --> 00:33:31,343
As for their living conditions, anywhere
from sixty to ninety thousand birds can be

311
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:34,944
crowded together in a single building.

312
00:33:45,729 --> 00:33:51,602
The suffering for these animals is
unrelenting. It is a way of life.

313
00:33:51,603 --> 00:33:57,923
Although their beaks are severed,
they attempt to peck each other.

314
00:34:01,951 --> 00:34:09,951
For hens, they live in a laying warehouse,
crammed inside so-called "battery cages".

315
00:34:10,518 --> 00:34:12,802
BATTERY CAGES

316
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:21,286
Many lose their feathers and develop
sores from rubbing against the wire cage.

317
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:28,042
Crowding prevents them from
spreading their wings, and the hens cannot

318
00:34:28,043 --> 00:34:31,643
even fulfill minimal natural instincts.

319
00:34:32,231 --> 00:34:33,942
TRANSPORTATION

320
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:39,680
During transportation,
all animals suffer, and many die.

321
00:34:41,251 --> 00:34:45,045
And they suffocate when other
animals pile on top of them

322
00:34:45,046 --> 00:34:48,406
in overcrowded, poorly loaded cages.

323
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,597
SLAUGHTER

324
00:34:56,124 --> 00:35:03,530
"THE HANG PEN"
MOOREFIELD, WEST VIRGINIA

325
00:35:30,709 --> 00:35:35,755
Chickens and turkeys are
slaughtered in numerous ways.

326
00:35:35,756 --> 00:35:41,436
Some may be clubbed to death
or have their heads cut off.

327
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:58,200
But most are brought through
the assembly lines of factory farms.

328
00:36:01,072 --> 00:36:06,748
Dangled upside down on a conveyor belt,
their throats are slit,

329
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:10,349
and they are left to bleed to death.

330
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:21,708
Others may be placed head-first
in tubes to restrict their movement

331
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:24,909
while they slowly bleed to death.

332
00:36:27,323 --> 00:36:34,573
Surely, if slaughterhouses had glass walls,
would not all of us be vegetarians?

333
00:36:34,574 --> 00:36:37,023
But slaughterhouses do not have glass walls.

334
00:36:37,024 --> 00:36:41,674
The architecture of slaughter is opaque,
designed in the interest of denial,

335
00:36:41,675 --> 00:36:46,899
to insure that we will not see even if
we wanted to look. And who wants to look?

336
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:58,031
"Go mother fucker!
Don't fuckin' stop".

337
00:36:58,032 --> 00:37:08,049
"Let's go, let's go!!!
Come on, bitch!"

338
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:20,123
It was Emerson who observed,
more than a hundred years ago,

339
00:37:20,124 --> 00:37:25,652
"You have dined, and however scrupulously
the slaughterhouse is concealed in

340
00:37:25,653 --> 00:37:30,693
the graceful distance of miles,
there is complicity".

341
00:38:15,635 --> 00:38:17,786
SEA FOOD

342
00:38:21,575 --> 00:38:26,236
And for those who think eating seafood
is "healthier" than land animals,

343
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:30,554
just remember how much irretrievable
waste and contaminated sediments

344
00:38:30,555 --> 00:38:33,195
are dumped into our oceans.

345
00:38:33,606 --> 00:38:38,899
In the past ... oil ... nuclear ... and chemical
industries have done little for the

346
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,475
protection of marine environments ...

347
00:38:41,476 --> 00:38:48,103
... and dumping on or under the seabed has
always proved a convenient place

348
00:38:48,104 --> 00:38:51,304
to dispose of inconvenient wastes.

349
00:38:56,807 --> 00:38:59,208
COMMERCIAL FISHING

350
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:08,217
Today's commercial fishers intensify
this situation on massive scales.

351
00:39:08,218 --> 00:39:11,082
They use vast factory
trawlers the size of

352
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:18,043
football fields and advanced electronic
equipment to track and catch fish.

353
00:39:20,078 --> 00:39:26,997
Huge nets stretch across the ocean,
swallowing up everything in their path.

354
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:31,607
These factory trawlers, coupled with
our increased appetites for seafood,

355
00:39:31,608 --> 00:39:37,128
are emptying the oceans of
sea life at an alarming pace.

356
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:48,190
Already, thirteen of the seventeen major global
fisheries are depleted or in serious decline.

357
00:39:48,191 --> 00:39:52,444
The other four are
overexploited or fully exploited.

358
00:39:52,445 --> 00:39:54,317
DISEASE

359
00:40:00,204 --> 00:40:02,584
The recent outbreak of Pfiesteria,

360
00:40:02,585 --> 00:40:06,910
a microorganism 1,000 time
more potent than cyanide,

361
00:40:06,911 --> 00:40:12,089
spawned from millions of gallons of
raw hog feces and urine, poured into rivers,

362
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:16,793
lakes, and oceans, turning their
ecosystems into unflushed toilets,

363
00:40:16,794 --> 00:40:19,594
is proving the most alarming.

364
00:40:21,256 --> 00:40:26,421
Threatening sea life and humans alike,
Pfiesteria has killed over 1 billion fish,

365
00:40:26,422 --> 00:40:30,194
the southeast's largest fishkill on record,

366
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:33,272
and it's spreading.

367
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:40,239
Traces of Pfiesteria have already been found
from Long Island to the Florida Gulf,

368
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,680
at distances of up to 1,000 miles.

369
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:46,790
In fact, this water-based
Pfiesteria invasion

370
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:52,841
stands as one of the worst outbreaks of
a virulent microorganism in U.S history.

371
00:40:52,842 --> 00:40:59,082
It is a Level Three
Biohazard. Ebola is a Four. AIDS is a two.

372
00:41:00,237 --> 00:41:05,351
And this bug mutated as a direct result
of our mass consumption of animals,

373
00:41:05,352 --> 00:41:07,032
particularly pork.

374
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:16,794
With hog farms fattening millions of pigs for
slaughter, grain goes in and waste comes out.

375
00:41:16,795 --> 00:41:20,235
HURRICANE FLOYD
NORTH CAROLINA, 1999

376
00:41:20,998 --> 00:41:23,995
This waste finds its way into our oceans and
water-supply systems,

377
00:41:23,996 --> 00:41:27,451
contaminating the animals that live in it,

378
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:30,892
as well as those that eat from it.

379
00:41:32,273 --> 00:41:34,030
WHALING

380
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,115
Finally, whaling.

381
00:41:40,553 --> 00:41:45,465
Though the International Whaling Commission
prohibited commercial whaling in 1985,

382
00:41:45,466 --> 00:41:52,426
many countries continue to kill
whales for their so-called "exotic meat".

383
00:42:01,027 --> 00:42:02,876
They use harpoons,

384
00:42:04,085 --> 00:42:05,375
firearms,

385
00:42:06,763 --> 00:42:08,058
blunt hooks,

386
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,940
even explosives,

387
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,381
or drive them into
authorized whaling bays

388
00:42:15,382 --> 00:42:22,742
where they are made to beach and can
be killed with knives in the shallows.

389
00:42:45,257 --> 00:42:47,488
DOLPHINS

390
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:57,704
Every winter, between the months of October
through March, thousands of dolphins are

391
00:42:57,705 --> 00:43:03,145
confined and brutally killed
in small towns across Japan.

392
00:43:06,339 --> 00:43:13,699
Sounding rods beneath the water's surface
interfere with the dolphin's sonar.

393
00:43:16,808 --> 00:43:23,048
Once disoriented and enclosed
within the nets, the dolphins panic.

394
00:43:26,201 --> 00:43:31,675
Fisherman often injure a few captive dolphins
with a spear thrust or knife slash ...

395
00:43:31,676 --> 00:43:36,556
since dolphins never abandon
wounded family members.

396
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:42,047
Mothers and babies call out in
distress as they are separated,

397
00:43:42,048 --> 00:43:48,768
hoisted up and dragged off
... soon to be mercilessly hacked to death.

398
00:43:56,408 --> 00:44:00,496
these are benign and innocent beings ...

399
00:44:01,257 --> 00:44:06,538
... and they deserve better.

400
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:44,621
Yet here, as they lay
stricken and needful,

401
00:44:44,622 --> 00:44:50,192
wreathing helplessly on cement
floors, they are cut open with machetes

402
00:44:50,193 --> 00:44:53,233
and left to slowly suffocate ...

403
00:45:03,302 --> 00:45:11,782
... convulsing and contorting in the throes
of agony ... while school children walk on by.

404
00:45:27,303 --> 00:45:32,570
Such images of slaughter and bloody red water
clearly show the Japanese government has

405
00:45:32,571 --> 00:45:37,292
little respect for the state of the world's
oceans with their inhumane methods of

406
00:45:37,293 --> 00:45:42,071
fishing ... often in violation of international
treaties, laws and conventions designed

407
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:45,565
to protect over-exploiting the oceans ...

408
00:45:45,566 --> 00:45:49,406
... and the creatures that live in them.

409
00:45:51,601 --> 00:45:55,268
Dolphin meat is later sold in
markets and restaurants,

410
00:45:55,269 --> 00:45:59,029
though often mislabeled as "whale meat".

411
00:46:01,517 --> 00:46:06,878
But as though cruelty toward animals
raised for food wasn't enough,

412
00:46:06,879 --> 00:46:11,376
we've also found ways of making
use of them for all our clothes.

413
00:46:11,377 --> 00:46:17,264
Jackets, shoes, belts, gloves,
pants, wallets, purses, and so on,

414
00:46:17,265 --> 00:46:21,862
the next question is obviously:
where do our clothes come from?

415
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:27,785
PART TREE: CLOTHES

416
00:46:36,282 --> 00:46:36,842
(LEATHER)

417
00:46:36,843 --> 00:46:42,371
The demand for leather comes primarily from
the United States, Germany, and the U.K.

418
00:46:42,372 --> 00:46:45,252
Just about everybody wears it,

419
00:46:45,321 --> 00:46:48,610
with little or no thought of
where it came from.

420
00:46:48,611 --> 00:46:49,975
(INDIA COWS)

421
00:46:49,976 --> 00:46:53,435
Thousands of India cows are
slaughtered each week for their skins,

422
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:57,101
purchased from poor families
in part of rural India who sell them

423
00:46:57,102 --> 00:47:02,473
only after the assurance that the
animals will live out their lives on farms.

424
00:47:02,474 --> 00:47:04,518
SHOEING AND ROPING

425
00:47:13,183 --> 00:47:15,954
To relocate the animals to
a state where they can legally be killed,

426
00:47:15,955 --> 00:47:19,332
since cattle slaughter
is forbidden in most of India,

427
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:24,405
the animals must be shoed and roped together
in preparation for a harrowing "death march",

428
00:47:24,406 --> 00:47:27,686
which could last for several days.

429
00:47:34,849 --> 00:47:36,342
(TRANSPORTATION AND FATIGUE)

430
00:47:36,343 --> 00:47:40,660
Forced to walk through the heat and dust without
food or water, coupled with the sheer stress of

431
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:48,079
this terrifying experience for them, many of
the animals collapse and are unable to continue.

432
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:53,021
Bear in mind that most of the cattle are
being placed in a truck for the first time in

433
00:47:53,022 --> 00:47:55,406
their lives and are likely to be frightened,

434
00:47:55,407 --> 00:47:59,927
especially if they have been handled hastily
or roughly by the men loading the trucks.

435
00:47:59,928 --> 00:48:01,527
The noise and motion of the truck itself

436
00:48:01,528 --> 00:48:05,232
is also a new experience;
one which makes them ill.

437
00:48:05,233 --> 00:48:10,051
After one or two days inside the truck without
food or water, they are desperately thirsty

438
00:48:10,052 --> 00:48:15,368
and hungry, especially since it is normal for
such cows to eat frequently throughout the day.

439
00:48:15,369 --> 00:48:16,649
TAIL BREAKING

440
00:48:24,073 --> 00:48:29,361
But when the cattle become weary and grow
faint, the bones in their tales are broken in

441
00:48:29,362 --> 00:48:33,762
an effort to get them back up on their feet.

442
00:48:34,268 --> 00:48:39,381
This is done by repeatedly pinching the
tail in several areas.

443
00:48:39,382 --> 00:48:40,899
HANDLERS

444
00:48:48,164 --> 00:48:51,492
Handlers must constantly
keep the cattle moving,

445
00:48:51,493 --> 00:48:53,505
pulling them by nose ropes,

446
00:48:53,506 --> 00:48:55,347
twisting their necks,

447
00:48:55,348 --> 00:48:57,893
horns, or tails.

448
00:48:59,944 --> 00:49:01,480
They lead, or rather force,

449
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:05,877
the cattle down embankments and
in and out of trucks without ramps,

450
00:49:05,878 --> 00:49:11,638
causing injuries like
broken pelvises, legs, ribs, and horns.

451
00:49:18,972 --> 00:49:20,623
CHILI PEPPER

452
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:26,701
Chili pepper and tobacco are also used
to keep the animals walking.

453
00:49:26,702 --> 00:49:32,215
This practice is done by rubbing the pepper
directly into their eyes, in order to stimulate

454
00:49:32,216 --> 00:49:35,896
the animal back onto his or her feet.

455
00:49:39,073 --> 00:49:40,839
SLAUGHTER

456
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:52,630
And all this before the slaughter.

457
00:49:53,786 --> 00:49:57,544
As many as half of the animals will
already be dead by the time they

458
00:49:57,545 --> 00:50:00,265
arrive at the slaughterhouse.

459
00:50:17,573 --> 00:50:22,915
But to make the experience even more
traumatic and terrifying, they are

460
00:50:22,916 --> 00:50:25,879
often killed in full view of each other.

461
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,719
And instead of the required "quick slice"
across the throat with a sharp knife,

462
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:37,520
they are generally killed through
hacking and sawing with a dull blade.

463
00:50:50,301 --> 00:50:52,126
TANNING

464
00:50:55,363 --> 00:51:00,383
Afterwards, the skins from these animals
are sent to tanneries that use deadly

465
00:51:00,384 --> 00:51:05,835
substances like Chromium and other toxins
to stop decomposition.

466
00:51:05,836 --> 00:51:09,444
Remember, leather is dead flesh.

467
00:51:10,085 --> 00:51:16,442
It is dead skin, and, therefore, natural for
it to decompose and rot away unless treated

468
00:51:16,443 --> 00:51:19,963
with such potent substances as these.

469
00:51:20,095 --> 00:51:25,483
And for people, the health effects of
such chemicals in tanneries, in lieu of the

470
00:51:25,484 --> 00:51:30,924
continued demand for leather goods, is
yet another issue.

471
00:51:30,972 --> 00:51:33,035
RETAIL

472
00:51:37,768 --> 00:51:42,221
Ultimately, leather from Indian cattle
make their way to clothing stores

473
00:51:42,222 --> 00:51:44,302
all around the world.

474
00:51:55,669 --> 00:51:59,509
Most major chains sell Indian leather ...

475
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:06,882
... leather that comes from completely
different cows than those we eat.

476
00:52:06,883 --> 00:52:08,434
FUR

477
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:11,714
And what about fur?

478
00:52:11,718 --> 00:52:14,663
Over 100 million wild
animals are murdered

479
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:19,732
for their pelts every year, 25
million in the United States alone.

480
00:52:19,733 --> 00:52:25,385
These animals, obtained by hunting and trapping,
are kept on fur farms in conditions like these.

481
00:52:25,386 --> 00:52:27,402
CAGE MADNESS

482
00:52:29,902 --> 00:52:36,895
Naturally, these undomesticated, wild animals
are not accustomed to being caged,

483
00:52:36,896 --> 00:52:41,554
and cage madness develops when frightened
and frustrated animals are driven crazy

484
00:52:41,555 --> 00:52:45,413
from the stress of confinement.

485
00:52:46,529 --> 00:52:48,441
These wild, free-roaming animals,

486
00:52:48,442 --> 00:52:52,878
and their offspring, find themselves
unable to live a natural life,

487
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:59,052
can never take even a few steps
or feel the earth beneath their feet.

488
00:52:59,053 --> 00:53:04,250
Instead, they are reduced to
scratching, circling and pacing endlessly.

489
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:06,297
(INJURIES AND SLOW DEATH)

490
00:53:06,298 --> 00:53:09,638
The physical injuries these
animals endure on fur farms ...

491
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:13,219
involve broken and exposed bones ...

492
00:53:16,717 --> 00:53:19,406
... blindness ...

493
00:53:21,243 --> 00:53:23,675
... ear infections ...

494
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,568
... dehydration and malnutrition ...

495
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:29,249
... exposure to freezing temperatures ...

496
00:53:29,314 --> 00:53:32,194
... lack of veterinary care ...

497
00:53:32,718 --> 00:53:36,334
... and slow death.

498
00:53:42,473 --> 00:53:44,459
(KILLING)

499
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:47,146
No laws indicate the killing of
animals on fur farms, therefore,

500
00:53:47,147 --> 00:53:51,482
the least expensive methods
are the most appealing.

501
00:53:51,483 --> 00:53:56,402
Carbon monoxide poisoning,
Strychnine, suffocation,

502
00:53:56,403 --> 00:54:03,290
breaking the neck, and anal electrocution
are some of the more common methods used.

503
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:09,391
Removed from his or her cage with a heavy
neck-pole, the animal is walked past

504
00:54:09,392 --> 00:54:17,232
the rows of bodies of slaughtered foxes,
sables, raccoons and wolves, among others.

505
00:54:17,661 --> 00:54:22,458
Death by anal electrocution is a crude
process that requires a probe to be inserted

506
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:28,619
in the rectum while the animal
bites down on a metal conductor.

507
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:42,249
Often times this inept procedure must
be repeated to actually kill the animal.

508
00:54:53,004 --> 00:55:02,099
And the skinned carcasses seen here will later
be ground up and fed to the animals still caged.

509
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:05,908
CHINESE FUR FARM

510
00:55:34,404 --> 00:55:39,305
CANADIAN SEAL HUNT

511
00:56:28,989 --> 00:56:31,309
- How much is this one?

512
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:34,624
- This is... $49,500

513
00:56:36,623 --> 00:56:39,117
PART FOUR: ENTERTAINMENT

514
00:56:39,368 --> 00:56:42,808
And so we move on to entertainment.

515
00:56:44,856 --> 00:56:47,175
Mark Twain once said,

516
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:53,058
"Of all the creatures ever made
he (man) is the most detestable.

517
00:56:53,059 --> 00:57:00,499
He's the only creature that inflicts
pain for sport, knowing it to be pain".

518
00:57:02,902 --> 00:57:05,080
RODEOS

519
00:57:05,614 --> 00:57:11,913
In rodeos, bulls and broncos don't buck because
they're wild, but because they're in pain.

520
00:57:11,914 --> 00:57:14,713
A belt, called a flank strap or a
bucking strap, is secured around

521
00:57:14,714 --> 00:57:18,445
the animal's body over the genital area.

522
00:57:18,446 --> 00:57:21,953
As the animal leaves the chute, a tight
jerk on the belt is enough

523
00:57:21,954 --> 00:57:25,461
to start him bucking in pain.

524
00:57:28,271 --> 00:57:32,796
Apart from other injuries animals
incur at rodeos ...

525
00:57:32,797 --> 00:57:35,357
... such as broken legs ...

526
00:57:37,508 --> 00:57:41,237
... they are also worked up by being slapped ...

527
00:57:41,238 --> 00:57:42,518
... teased ...

528
00:57:42,837 --> 00:57:45,042
... given electric prods ...

529
00:57:45,043 --> 00:57:47,294
... and otherwise tormented ...

530
00:57:47,295 --> 00:57:51,375
... to bolt out of the chute in a frenzy.

531
00:58:35,836 --> 00:58:37,510
ROPING

532
00:58:44,996 --> 00:58:50,615
Roping, as seen here, involves throwing a rope
around the neck of a frightened animal running

533
00:58:50,616 --> 00:58:59,096
full speed, jerking the poor creature to
a halt, and slamming him or her to the ground.

534
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,371
GAMBLING

535
00:59:11,912 --> 00:59:14,289
Like any other business, dog racing
and horse racing are industries motivated

536
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:16,667
by a common denominator:

537
00:59:17,022 --> 00:59:17,918
profit.

538
00:59:28,825 --> 00:59:30,596
FAIR GROUNDS

539
00:59:30,929 --> 00:59:36,179
At fair grounds across the country,
animals are used to race,

540
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,998
bet with, and spectate over.

541
00:59:40,442 --> 00:59:45,966
Training for these events is accomplished
by withholding food and sometimes water.

542
00:59:45,967 --> 00:59:50,652
These animals ... unfamiliar with their
surroundings ... the noise ... the crowds ...

543
00:59:50,653 --> 01:00:00,024
even what they're supposed to be doing ...
are all-too-often injured and discarded ...

544
01:00:00,025 --> 01:00:07,033
(PIGEON BOWLING)
in pointless ... trivial ... outlandish contests
... designed to make profits and entertain.

545
01:00:07,034 --> 01:00:09,583
HUNTING

546
01:00:11,173 --> 01:00:17,413
Besides loss of habitat, hunting
is the number one threat to wildlife today.

547
01:00:17,414 --> 01:00:21,956
Hunters kill over 200 million
animals every year.

548
01:00:21,957 --> 01:00:27,957
Deer, rabbits, and squirrels top the list of
desirable targets.

549
01:00:29,004 --> 01:00:34,725
There is no denying it, if hunting is a
sport it is a bloodsport.

550
01:00:34,726 --> 01:00:36,966
The targets are living,

551
01:00:37,505 --> 01:00:40,545
and they undergo violent deaths.

552
01:00:51,513 --> 01:00:53,005
FISHING

553
01:00:53,807 --> 01:01:00,207
Fishing is also a death sport,
wherein the nonhuman animal suffers.

554
01:01:01,338 --> 01:01:08,635
Researchers have distinguished that fish show
pain behavior the same way mammals do.

555
01:01:08,636 --> 01:01:12,904
Anatomically, physiologically,

556
01:01:12,905 --> 01:01:18,181
and biologically, the pain system in fish is
virtually the same as in birds and mammals.

557
01:01:18,182 --> 01:01:21,033
In other words, fish are sentient organisms,

558
01:01:21,034 --> 01:01:23,834
so of course they feel pain.

559
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:35,588
For those who think fish die

560
01:01:35,589 --> 01:01:39,741
"gentler" deaths, consider that their
sensory organs are highly developed,

561
01:01:39,742 --> 01:01:45,391
their nervous systems complex,
their nerve cells very similar to our own,

562
01:01:45,392 --> 01:01:51,232
and their responses to certain stimuli
immediate and vigorous.

563
01:01:52,537 --> 01:01:55,617
CIRCUSES

564
01:01:58,745 --> 01:02:04,377
When going to the circus, rarely do
we stop for a moment and consider:

565
01:02:04,378 --> 01:02:09,966
What incites an animal to do something unnatural,
even dangerous, such as jumping through

566
01:02:09,967 --> 01:02:18,527
flames, balancing on one foot, or diving into
water from shaky platforms high in the air?

567
01:02:27,401 --> 01:02:30,666
Animal trainers would
like for the public to

568
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:38,267
believe that animals are coaxed into such
behaviors with the promise of rewards.

569
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:45,738
But the truth is that animals
perform because they fear punishment.

570
01:02:56,975 --> 01:03:01,301
In essence, circuses condemn animal

571
01:03:01,302 --> 01:03:06,337
who are wild by nature to live out their
days isolated in tiny, barren cages,

572
01:03:06,338 --> 01:03:10,312
denied normal exercise and socialization,

573
01:03:13,826 --> 01:03:17,266
shuttled around from place to place,

574
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:22,267
WINTER QUARTERS

575
01:03:24,896 --> 01:03:30,096
and shackled in chains
for up to 95% of their lives.

576
01:03:32,147 --> 01:03:34,569
TRAINING

577
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:41,410
"Elephants are taught to perform with
positive reinforcement, and never hit".

578
01:03:41,411 --> 01:03:47,174
"Never hit. Never, never, never

579
01:03:47,175 --> 01:03:54,695
will you see anyone use the ankus as
anything other than a guide or a tool".

580
01:04:09,837 --> 01:04:17,037
Dominance, subservience, and pain
are integral parts of the training process.

581
01:04:45,934 --> 01:04:48,343
- Hurt him. Don't touch him!

582
01:04:48,344 --> 01:04:49,768
Make him scream!

583
01:04:49,769 --> 01:04:54,419
If you're scared to hurt him,
don't come in this room.

584
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:58,315
When I say rip his fuckin' ---
you know how I am about touchin' him, right?

585
01:04:58,316 --> 01:05:02,584
So if I say rip his head off ...
rip his fuckin' foot off, what does that mean?

586
01:05:02,585 --> 01:05:05,693
Because it's very important to do it, right?
When he starts squirming too fuckin' much -

587
01:05:05,694 --> 01:05:09,427
both fuckin' hands - BOOM!
Right under that chin!

588
01:05:09,428 --> 01:05:11,722
Sit ... and he better back up.

589
01:05:11,723 --> 01:05:14,188
Then when he fucks around too much,
don't grab that leg ...

590
01:05:14,189 --> 01:05:19,775
... you fuckin' sink that hook and give everything
you've got ... and when it's in there go, ee-eeee-ee!!!

591
01:05:19,776 --> 01:05:21,907
And he's gonna start screaming.

592
01:05:21,908 --> 01:05:27,678
When you hear that screaming, then you know
you've got their attention a little fuckin' bit!

593
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:31,597
Right here in the barn.
Can't do it on the road.

594
01:05:31,598 --> 01:05:36,150
She's gonna fuckin' do what I want.
And that's just the fuckin' way it is.

595
01:05:36,151 --> 01:05:37,991
Alright, let's go.

596
01:05:38,459 --> 01:05:39,899
Becky! Becky!!!

597
01:05:43,313 --> 01:05:45,100
You motherfucker.

598
01:05:46,411 --> 01:05:50,091
Get your motherfuckin' --- get up here!

599
01:05:50,275 --> 01:05:51,497
Motherfucker!

600
01:05:53,156 --> 01:05:54,836
Come here, Becky.

601
01:05:56,402 --> 01:05:57,922
Move up, Becky.

602
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:00,639
Move up, Becky.

603
01:06:03,658 --> 01:06:05,047
Alright, tubs.

604
01:06:05,497 --> 01:06:07,119
Tubs!

605
01:06:09,831 --> 01:06:11,351
Hey, get loony.

606
01:06:11,499 --> 01:06:13,155
Hey, Becky.
Go on, move up.

607
01:06:13,156 --> 01:06:14,459
Hey, I'm alive.

608
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:15,835
I'm not a dead man.

609
01:06:15,836 --> 01:06:16,716
Move up.

610
01:06:17,061 --> 01:06:18,421
Come in line.

611
01:06:18,632 --> 01:06:20,632
Come in line, Becky.

612
01:06:20,859 --> 01:06:22,059
Motherfucker!

613
01:06:22,113 --> 01:06:23,873
Move, motherfucker!

614
01:06:27,982 --> 01:06:31,582
Yeah, come in line. Come here, Tommy.

615
01:06:31,957 --> 01:06:40,037
Why do they have to go through that because
you motherfuckers don't want to listen?

616
01:06:41,227 --> 01:06:42,724
Back up.

617
01:06:42,847 --> 01:06:49,327
You got a pussy-ass fuckin' attitude,
it's just the way they die.

618
01:06:55,988 --> 01:06:58,068
We know animals feel.

619
01:07:01,916 --> 01:07:07,516
They feel fear, loneliness, and
pain, just like humans do.

620
01:07:08,377 --> 01:07:12,561
What animal would choose to
spend their entire life in captivity ...

621
01:07:12,562 --> 01:07:15,042
... if they had a choice?

622
01:07:15,103 --> 01:07:17,964
RETALIATION

623
01:08:32,282 --> 01:08:34,177
- On the count of three.

624
01:08:34,178 --> 01:08:34,852
One.

625
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:36,687
Two.

626
01:08:37,195 --> 01:08:37,755
Tree.

627
01:08:38,391 --> 01:08:41,511
Take him.
You've got to shoot.

628
01:09:07,065 --> 01:09:08,728
ZOOS

629
01:09:11,633 --> 01:09:17,153
Are zoos valuable educational
and conservation institutions?

630
01:09:17,412 --> 01:09:21,482
Sure, zoos are interesting, but they are
only educational in the sense that they

631
01:09:21,483 --> 01:09:27,003
teach a disregard for the
natures of other living beings.

632
01:09:28,051 --> 01:09:35,251
Besides, what can we learn about
wild animals by viewing them in captivity?

633
01:09:36,658 --> 01:09:41,778
Zoos exist because we
are intrigued by exotic things,

634
01:09:41,876 --> 01:09:47,094
and to zoo-goers,
zoo animals are just that: things.

635
01:09:49,615 --> 01:09:53,413
In both cases, at circuses or zoos,

636
01:09:53,774 --> 01:09:57,657
wild and exotic animals
are captured, caged,

637
01:09:57,658 --> 01:10:03,658
transported and trained ... to
do what humans want them to do.

638
01:10:06,874 --> 01:10:09,477
BULLFIGHTING

639
01:10:09,898 --> 01:10:13,742
At best, the term "bullfighting"
is a misnomer,

640
01:10:13,743 --> 01:10:17,637
as there is little competition
between the sword of a nimble matador

641
01:10:17,638 --> 01:10:20,045
(which is Spanish for killer),

642
01:10:20,046 --> 01:10:27,646
and a confused, maimed, psychologically
tormented, and physically debilitated bull.

643
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:32,640
Many prominent former
bullfighters report

644
01:10:32,641 --> 01:10:36,949
that bulls are intentionally debilitated
with tranquilizers and laxatives,

645
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:45,750
beatings to the kidneys, and heavy weights hung
around their necks for weeks before a fight.

646
01:10:46,363 --> 01:10:52,456
Some of the animals are placed in darkness
for 48 hours before the confrontation,

647
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:57,106
then are released
blinded into the bright arena.

648
01:10:58,666 --> 01:11:03,942
In a typical event, the bull enters and
is approached by men who exhaust and

649
01:11:03,943 --> 01:11:10,692
frustrate him by running him in
circles and tricking him into collisions.

650
01:11:10,693 --> 01:11:13,454
When the bull is tired and out of breath,

651
01:11:13,455 --> 01:11:19,287
he is approached by picadors, who
drive lances into his back and neck muscles,

652
01:11:19,288 --> 01:11:23,439
twisting and gouging to ensure
a significant amount of blood loss,

653
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:28,400
and impairing the bull's
ability to lift his head.

654
01:11:28,666 --> 01:11:31,386
Then come the banderilleros

655
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:38,242
who distract and dart around the bull
while plunging more lances into him.

656
01:11:38,243 --> 01:11:40,999
Weakened from blood loss,

657
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:46,369
they run the bull in more circles
until he is dizzy and stops chasing.

658
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:51,934
Finally, the matador, this "killer",
appears and, after provoking a few exhausted

659
01:11:51,935 --> 01:11:58,655
charges from the dying animal,
tries to kill the bull with his sword.

660
01:12:00,133 --> 01:12:05,253
And this bloody form of amusement ...
is bullfighting.

661
01:12:06,712 --> 01:12:11,122
The pleasure derived from all these
activities and sports

662
01:12:11,123 --> 01:12:14,235
(a communion with nature, some would say),

663
01:12:14,236 --> 01:12:19,036
can be secured without
harming or killing animals.

664
01:12:19,152 --> 01:12:23,445
The commercial exploitation of wildlife
erroneously assumes that the value of wild

665
01:12:23,446 --> 01:12:28,208
animals is reducible to their
utility relative to human interests,

666
01:12:28,209 --> 01:12:31,431
especially economic interests.

667
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:41,590
But wild animals are not a renewable resource,
having value only relative to human interests.

668
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:47,810
That perception
can only be that of a speciesist.

669
01:12:52,097 --> 01:12:55,757
(SEAL HARVEST, ST. PAUL ISLAND)
Nevertheless, these practices exist

670
01:12:55,758 --> 01:13:02,398
only because we do not take
seriously the interests of other animals.

671
01:13:05,936 --> 01:13:12,336
In this light, are humans not
the most callous speciesists of all?

672
01:13:13,744 --> 01:13:17,993
PART FIVE: SCIENCE

673
01:13:21,348 --> 01:13:23,268
VIVISECTION

674
01:13:23,798 --> 01:13:27,606
The term vivisection is used
to apply to all types of experiments

675
01:13:27,607 --> 01:13:33,767
on living animals and is said to be
a form of medical science.

676
01:13:34,182 --> 01:13:36,521
The reason for experimentation of this

677
01:13:36,522 --> 01:13:43,082
type is to allegedly discover cures
for human ailments and illnesses.

678
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:48,959
But those who hope to find remedies
for human ills by inflicting deliberate

679
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:53,632
sufferings on animals commit
two fundamental errors in understanding.

680
01:13:53,633 --> 01:13:55,429
The first is the assumption

681
01:13:55,430 --> 01:14:00,175
that results obtained on animals
are applicable to mankind.

682
01:14:00,176 --> 01:14:02,322
The second concerns the inevitable

683
01:14:02,323 --> 01:14:08,125
fallacy of experimental science in
respect to the field of organic life.

684
01:14:08,126 --> 01:14:12,672
Since animals react differently
from human beings ... every new product

685
01:14:12,673 --> 01:14:15,400
or method tried out on animals must be tried

686
01:14:15,401 --> 01:14:23,317
out again on man ... through careful clinical
tests, before it can be considered safe.

687
01:14:23,318 --> 01:14:26,198
This rule knows no exceptions.

688
01:14:26,387 --> 01:14:31,623
Tests on animals are not only dangerous
because they lead to wrong conclusions

689
01:14:31,624 --> 01:14:35,801
but, furthermore,
they retard clinical investigation -

690
01:14:35,802 --> 01:14:38,682
which is the only valid kind.

691
01:14:39,639 --> 01:14:42,142
Just remember the fact that any disease

692
01:14:42,143 --> 01:14:48,491
deliberately provoked is unlike any
disease that arises spontaneously.

693
01:14:48,492 --> 01:14:51,360
MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS

694
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:54,989
Unfortunately, such
methods still sail today

695
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,775
under the flag of science

696
01:14:56,776 --> 01:15:03,336
- which is an insult to true science,
as well as human intelligence.

697
01:15:14,781 --> 01:15:19,741
And so vivisection applies to medical
experiments ...

698
01:15:20,365 --> 01:15:25,725
... done with the administration of noxious
substances ...

699
01:15:29,474 --> 01:15:32,754
... electric or traumatic shocks ...

700
01:15:43,352 --> 01:15:46,283
... unanesthetized operations ...

701
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,589
... burns ...

702
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:33,279
... drawn-out deprivations of food and drink ...

703
01:16:35,247 --> 01:16:38,236
... physical and psychological tortures ...

704
01:16:38,237 --> 01:16:40,066
... that lead to mental imbalance ...

705
01:16:40,067 --> 01:16:42,787
... infections ... and so on.

706
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:48,464
(UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA)
Head injury research involves partially

707
01:16:48,465 --> 01:16:52,010
or fully conscious baboons
strapped down with restraints ...

708
01:16:52,011 --> 01:16:54,802
... and their heads
cemented into a metal helmet,

709
01:16:54,803 --> 01:17:02,083
which will be thrust at a 60
degree angle at a force of up to 1,000 Gs.

710
01:17:28,926 --> 01:17:33,333
The purpose of this experiment
is to simulate auto crashes ...

711
01:17:33,334 --> 01:17:38,512
... football ... boxing ...
and other head related injuries.

712
01:17:38,513 --> 01:17:45,142
And this process is often repeated
again and again on the same animals.

713
01:17:45,143 --> 01:17:46,671
MILITARY RESEARCH

714
01:17:46,672 --> 01:17:49,552
And finally, military research.

715
01:17:50,379 --> 01:17:53,019
This one speaks for itself.

716
01:17:54,393 --> 01:17:57,993
>From sending monkeys into outer space,

717
01:17:58,545 --> 01:18:02,625
and testing atomic blasts on helpless dogs,

718
01:18:02,797 --> 01:18:07,305
to exposing primates to nuclear radiation.

719
01:18:08,951 --> 01:18:11,138
Twenty years ago, the number of animals

720
01:18:11,139 --> 01:18:15,778
dying of tortures through the practice
of vivisection was astronomical,

721
01:18:15,779 --> 01:18:19,699
estimated at 400,000 per day world wide,

722
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:24,053
and growing at an annual rate of five percent.

723
01:18:24,054 --> 01:18:26,149
Today that number is almost

724
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:32,183
beyond comprehension. 19,000
per minute. 10 billion per year.

725
01:18:39,352 --> 01:18:41,648
Some uneducated persons pretend to

726
01:18:41,649 --> 01:18:48,529
know that less intelligent animals
don't feel pain the same way we do.

727
01:18:48,538 --> 01:18:54,732
In truth, we know very little about how
specific animals may "feel",

728
01:18:54,733 --> 01:18:59,706
except that they must also submit to
the universal law that causes every

729
01:18:59,707 --> 01:19:07,067
organism dying by unnatural means to
suffer greatly before that final release.

730
01:19:09,005 --> 01:19:11,438
But it's nonsense to
say that the animals

731
01:19:11,439 --> 01:19:17,439
do not suffer because they have
a lower order of intelligence.

732

FORCE-FEEDING GEESE
"FOIE GRAS"

733
01:19:21,817 --> 01:19:26,171
Pain is pain,
conveyed by nerves to the brain,

734
01:19:26,172 --> 01:19:30,475
and there are other nerves
than those of intelligence...

735
01:19:30,476 --> 01:19:35,547
...nerves such as sight,
smell, touch, and hearing.

736
01:19:36,694 --> 01:19:44,054
And in some animals these nerves
are much more highly developed than in man.

737
01:19:46,484 --> 01:19:49,153
We know that there
has never been an epoch

738
01:19:49,154 --> 01:19:55,916
in which we could learn something about
the physiology of man by torturing animals;

739
01:19:55,917 --> 01:19:59,117
we only learned
something about animals.

740
01:19:59,118 --> 01:20:03,491
And if there is something we can learn
from them on the psychological level,

741
01:20:03,492 --> 01:20:09,840
it is not by means of steel or electricity,
much less so through psychic violences.

742
01:20:09,841 --> 01:20:14,733
The systematic torture of sentient beings,

743
01:20:14,838 --> 01:20:19,364
whatever the pretext and in whatever form,
cannot achieve anything more than it already has:

744
01:20:19,365 --> 01:20:25,685
to show us what is the
lowest point of debasement man can reach.

745
01:20:32,262 --> 01:20:35,732
If that's what
we want to know.

746
01:20:36,258 --> 01:20:43,473
"As long as there are slaughterhouses,
there will be battlefields".

747
01:20:44,556 --> 01:20:48,693
- Leo Tolstoy

748
01:21:02,707 --> 01:21:07,065
Ignorance is the speciesist's
first line of defense.

749
01:21:07,066 --> 01:21:14,193
Yet it is easily breached by anyone with the
time and determination to find out the truth.

750
01:21:14,194 --> 01:21:22,514
Ignorance has prevailed so long only because
people do not want to find out the truth.

751
01:21:22,576 --> 01:21:25,172
"Don't tell me, you'll spoil my dinner"

752
01:21:25,173 --> 01:21:31,609
is the usual reply to any attempt to tell
someone just how that dinner was produced.

753
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:33,599
Even people who are aware that

754
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:39,450
the traditional family farm has been
taken over by big business interests...

755
01:21:39,451 --> 01:21:44,483
...that their clothes come from slaughtered
cows, that their entertainment means the

756
01:21:44,484 --> 01:21:48,732
suffering and death of millions of
animals... and that some questionable

757
01:21:48,733 --> 01:21:51,125
experiments go on in laboratories,

758
01:21:51,126 --> 01:21:56,942
still cling to a vague belief
that conditions cannot be too bad,

759
01:21:56,943 --> 01:22:00,524
(PREGNAT MARE URINE AKA: "PREMARIN")

760
01:22:01,524 --> 01:22:04,304
or else the government or the animal welfare
societies would have done something about it.

761
01:22:04,305 --> 01:22:11,026
But it is not the inability to find out what
is going on as much as a desire not to know about

762
01:22:11,027 --> 01:22:18,479
facts that may lie heavy on one's conscience
that is responsible for this lack of awareness -

763
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:24,992
- after all, the victims of whatever it is that goes on in
all these awful places

764
01:22:24,993 --> 01:22:28,513
are not members of one's own group.

765
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:38,044
It all comes down to pain and suffering.

766
01:22:38,045 --> 01:22:44,055
Not intelligence, not strength,
not social class or civil right.

767
01:22:44,056 --> 01:22:48,758
Pain and suffering are in themselves bad
and should be prevented or minimized,

768
01:22:48,759 --> 01:22:55,319
irrespective of the race, sex,
or species of the being that suffers.

769
01:22:57,881 --> 01:23:01,080
We are all creatures.

770
01:23:02,114 --> 01:23:06,788
And non-human animals experience
sensations just like we do.

771
01:23:06,789 --> 01:23:13,344
They too are strong, intelligent,
industrious, mobile, and evolutional.

772
01:23:13,345 --> 01:23:16,489
They too are capable of
growth and adaptation.

773
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:21,019
Like us, first and foremost,
they are earthlings.

774
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:24,140
And like us, they are surviving.

775
01:23:26,151 --> 01:23:30,718
Like us, they also seek their own comfort
rather than discomfort.

776
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:35,119
And like us, they express degrees
of emotion.

777
01:23:36,682 --> 01:23:40,589
In short, like us, they are alive;

778
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:46,240
most of them being, in fact,
vertebrae, just like us.

779
01:24:05,219 --> 01:24:10,486
As we look back on how essential
animals are to human survival;

780
01:24:10,487 --> 01:24:13,447
our absolute dependence on them

781
01:24:14,041 --> 01:24:15,789
(for companionship ... food ...

782
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:17,230
... clothing ...

783
01:24:17,513 --> 01:24:20,079
... sport and entertainment ...

784
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:24,341
... as well as medical and scientific research),

785
01:24:24,342 --> 01:24:32,502
ironically ... we only see mankind's complete
disrespect for these non-human providers.

786
01:24:32,631 --> 01:24:36,215
Without a doubt, this must be what it is...

787
01:24:36,216 --> 01:24:39,816
... to "bite the hand that feeds us".

788
01:24:41,879 --> 01:24:46,759
In fact, we have actually stomped
and spit on it.

789
01:24:49,316 --> 01:24:52,880
Now we are faced
with the inevitable aftermath.

790
01:24:52,881 --> 01:24:58,026
This is evident in health reports due to
our over-excessive consumption of animals.

791
01:24:58,027 --> 01:24:58,806
Cancer,

792
01:24:59,298 --> 01:25:00,658
heart disease,

793
01:25:00,734 --> 01:25:02,082
Osteoporosis,

794
01:25:02,381 --> 01:25:03,181
strokes,

795
01:25:03,701 --> 01:25:05,061
kidney stones,

796
01:25:05,188 --> 01:25:06,377
Anemia,

797
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:08,641
diabetes, and more.

798
01:25:13,039 --> 01:25:18,917
Even our food has now been effected ...
and at its very source.

799
01:25:18,918 --> 01:25:22,087
With antibiotics used to
promote weight gain in animals

800
01:25:22,088 --> 01:25:27,945
(who can't gain weight under the stressful,
overcrowded living conditions in factory farms);

801
01:25:27,946 --> 01:25:32,635
with the over-use of
pesticides and insecticides;

802
01:25:32,636 --> 01:25:34,080
or artificial hormones

803
01:25:34,081 --> 01:25:39,794
(designed to increase milk
production, litter size and frequency);

804
01:25:39,795 --> 01:25:45,325
with artificial colors,
herbicides, larvicides,

805
01:25:45,326 --> 01:25:53,158
synthetic fertilizers, tranquilizers,
growth and appetite stimulants ...

806
01:25:53,501 --> 01:25:57,368
... it's no wonder that Mad Cow Disease ...
Foot and Mouth Disease ... Pfiesteria ...

807
01:25:57,369 --> 01:26:00,226
and a host of other animal related
abnormalities have been

808
01:26:00,227 --> 01:26:04,227
(POLLUTION)
unleashed on the human public.

809
01:26:04,825 --> 01:26:08,820
Nature is not responsible for these actions.

810
01:26:08,821 --> 01:26:11,323
(DEFORESTATION)
We are.

811
01:26:16,459 --> 01:26:21,643
So a change is inevitable.
Either we make it ourselves,

812
01:26:21,644 --> 01:26:26,203
or we will be forced to
make it by Nature Itself.

813
01:26:26,204 --> 01:26:30,283
The time has come for each of us
to reconsider our eating habits,

814
01:26:30,284 --> 01:26:31,845
our traditions,

815
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:34,538
our lifestyles and fashions,

816
01:26:34,539 --> 01:26:38,400
and above all,
our way of thinking.

817
01:26:45,601 --> 01:26:48,540
So, if there is any truth
to the age-old saying,

818
01:26:48,541 --> 01:26:54,462
"What goes around, comes around",
then what do they get for their pain?

819
01:26:54,463 --> 01:26:58,722
Do we even give it a second thought?

820
01:26:59,161 --> 01:27:05,641
If what goes around comes around,
what do they get for their pain?

821
01:27:08,053 --> 01:27:10,254
They are earthlings.

822
01:27:11,426 --> 01:27:17,186
They have the right to be here
just as much as humans do.

823
01:27:17,458 --> 01:27:22,615
Perhaps the answer is found
in another age-old saying ...

824
01:27:22,616 --> 01:27:25,016
... and one equally true:

825
01:27:27,267 --> 01:27:31,475
We reap just what we sow.

826
01:27:36,404 --> 01:27:42,484
So of course, animals feel,
and of course they experience pain.

827
01:27:44,081 --> 01:27:49,832
After all, has nature endowed these
wonderful animals with well-springs of sentiment

828
01:27:49,833 --> 01:27:52,953
so that they should not feel ...

829
01:27:53,287 --> 01:27:58,807
... or do animals have nerves
in order to be insensitive?

830
01:28:01,275 --> 01:28:04,604
Reason demands a better answer.

831
01:28:07,346 --> 01:28:14,198
But one thing is absolutely certain:
animals used for food, used for clothing,

832
01:28:14,199 --> 01:28:18,926
used for entertainment,
and in scientific experiments

833
01:28:18,927 --> 01:28:22,638
and all the oppression that is done to them
under the sun

834
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:26,141
they all die from pain.

835
01:28:26,532 --> 01:28:28,576
Each and every one.

836
01:28:31,779 --> 01:28:33,457
Isn't it enough that animals

837
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:39,449
the world over live in permanent retreat
from human progress and expansion?

838
01:28:39,450 --> 01:28:45,290
And for many species ...
there is simply nowhere else to go.

839
01:28:46,290 --> 01:28:51,518
It seems the fate of many animals
is either to be unwanted by man ...

840
01:28:51,519 --> 01:28:53,843
... or wanted too much.

841
01:28:55,449 --> 01:29:01,979
We enter as lords of the earth bearing
strange powers of terror and mercy alike ...

842
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:05,242
But Human beings
should love animals as ...

843
01:29:05,243 --> 01:29:10,491
the knowing love the innocent,
and the strong love the vulnerable.

844
01:29:10,492 --> 01:29:14,252
When we wince at the
suffering of animals,

845
01:29:14,253 --> 01:29:18,884
that feeling speaks well of
us even when we ignore it,

846
01:29:18,885 --> 01:29:24,120
and those who dismiss love for our fellow
creatures as mere sentimentality

847
01:29:24,121 --> 01:29:29,081
overlook a good and
important part of our humanity.

848
01:29:29,409 --> 01:29:35,474
But it takes nothing away from
a human to be kind to an animal.

849
01:29:35,475 --> 01:29:38,002
And it is actually within us

850
01:29:38,003 --> 01:29:42,643
to grant them a happy
life ... and a long one.

851
01:29:45,757 --> 01:29:52,276
On the heath, King Lear asked Gloucester:
"How do you see the world?"

852
01:29:52,277 --> 01:29:56,053
And Gloucester, who is blind, answered:

853
01:29:56,445 --> 01:30:00,201
"I see it feelingly".

854
01:30:01,576 --> 01:30:05,766
I see it feelingly.

855
01:30:06,522 --> 01:30:11,082
Three primary life forces
exist on this planet:

856
01:30:11,101 --> 01:30:13,160
Nature,

857
01:30:13,629 --> 01:30:15,594
Animals

858
01:30:17,227 --> 01:30:20,892
and Humankind.

859
01:30:23,123 --> 01:30:25,851
We are the Earthlings.

860
01:30:29,055 --> 01:30:32,168
Make the connection.

861
01:30:35,145 --> 01:30:43,863
