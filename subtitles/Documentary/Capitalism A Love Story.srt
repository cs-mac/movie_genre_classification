{1252}{1346}What can you say about a|25-year-old girl who died?
{1400}{1474}That she was beautiful and brilliant?
{1512}{1592}That she loved Mozart and Bach?
{1606}{1670}The Beatles?
{1671}{1724}And me?
{2147}{2228}- Do you have this book?|- You have your own library.
{2229}{2311}- Answer my question.|- Answer mine first.
{2312}{2396}We're allowed to use|the Radcliffe library.
{2397}{2480}I'm not talking legality,|I'm talking ethics.
{2481}{2565}Harvard's got five million books,|Radcliffe a few thousand.
{2566}{2650}I only want one. I've got|an hour exam tomorrow, damn it!
{2651}{2717}Please watch your profanity, preppy.
{2776}{2848}Why do you think|I went to prep school?
{2849}{2954}- You look stupid and rich.|- Actually, I'm smart and poor.
{2955}{3011}No, I'm smart and poor.
{3012}{3117}- Why are you so smart?|- I won't have coffee with you.
{3119}{3222}- I wouldn't ask you.|- That's what makes you stupid.
{3314}{3404}Comp. Lit. 105. Not bad.
{3406}{3558}Music 150. Not bad.|Music 201, that's a graduate course.
{3559}{3623}- Renaissance polyphony.|- What's polyphony?
{3624}{3693}Nothing sexual, preppy.
{3694}{3759}I told you, my name is Oliver.
{3760}{3831}- First or last?|- First.
{3832}{3902}- Oliver what?|- Barrett.
{3917}{4031}- Barrett like the poet?|- Yeah, no relation.
{4032}{4136}- Barrett like the hall?|- Yes.
{4137}{4217}I'm having coffee|with a Harvard building.
{4218}{4326}I'm not Barrett Hall. My great|grandfather just gave it to Harvard.
{4327}{4417}So his not-so-great grandson|could get in?
{4418}{4547}If you think I'm a loser, why did you|bulldoze me into buying you coffee?
{4574}{4647}I like your body.
{4832}{4908}- I major in Social Studies.|- It doesn't show.
{4909}{5019}- It's an honours programme.|- I know you've got a few brains.
{5020}{5131}- Really?|- You're hung up on me, aren't you?
{5241}{5305}- Jenny?|- Yeah?
{5306}{5424}Listen, you Radcliffe bitch.|There's a hockey game on Friday.
{5425}{5487}- So?|- I want you to come.
{5499}{5582}Why would I go|to a lousy hockey game?
{5600}{5688}- Because I'm playing.|- For which side?
{6664}{6746}Two minutes for number seven.|Holding.
{6763}{6900}Penalty, Barrett, Harvard,|Two minutes, Holding,
{7131}{7209}Why are you here|when your friends are playing?
{7210}{7286}I'm in the penalty box.
{7288}{7360}- What did you do?|- I tried too hard.
{7362}{7446}- Is that a big disgrace?|- I'm trying to concentrate.
{7447}{7517}- On what?|- On how I'll total that bastard.
{7518}{7572}Come on, Harvard, let's go!
{7586}{7676}Are you a dirty player?|Would you ever total me?
{7677}{7800}- I will right now if you don't shut up.|- I'm leaving. Goodbye.
{8024}{8149}Barrett back in the game,|Harvard have full strength,
{8957}{9085}And a goal, Ackerman,|Assist, Barrett,
{9097}{9177}- Now I've seen a hockey game.|- What did you like best?
{9178}{9274}- When you were on your ass.|- Thanks for coming.
{9275}{9360}I didn't say you could kiss me.
{9361}{9445}- I was carried away.|- I wasn't.
{9528}{9596}I may not call you for a few months,
{9597}{9698}or I might call you|when I get back to my room.
{9699}{9799}- Bastard.|- You can dish it out, but not take it.
{9977}{10041}- Hello, animals.|- Hey, Ollie.
{10042}{10104}- What did you get?|- An assist.
{10105}{10189}- Off Cavilleri?|- None of your business.
{10190}{10299}- I'm your roommate!|- Has Barrett got a new goodie?
{10300}{10405}Jenny Cavilleri.|It's a music type from Rhode lsland.
{10406}{10536}- I know her. Real tight-ass.|- Plays piano for the Bach Society.
{10537}{10656}- What does she play with Barrett?|- Probably hard to get.
{10669}{10749}Simpson. Up yours.
{10762}{10824}That proves it.
{11249}{11308}Hello, Jen?
{11309}{11468}What would you say if I told you...|I think I'm in love with you?
{11469}{11626}Never say "love" if you don't mean it.|You're a known quantity.
{11642}{11672}Meaning?
{11673}{11818}You're known for quantity.|At Radcliffe, every hall is Barrett Hall.
{11831}{11978}- You've been checking up on me.|- I won't dine outdoors with anybody.
{12005}{12112}- Am I just anybody?|- What do you think, preppy?
{12210}{12310}You'll have to fend for yourself|this weekend.
{12326}{12438}I'll be mixing it up|with Francis LaPierre.
{12459}{12540}- Very funny.|- Are you jealous?
{12541}{12641}He's the captain|of the Cornell hockey team.
{12642}{12731}You've been reading the sports page.
{12890}{12981}I wouldn't mind|watching you play against Cornell.
{12998}{13084}No. I'll be involved.
{13085}{13166}Oh, yeah. The All-lvy title.
{13346}{13422}- More than the All-lvy title?|- A lot more.
{13547}{13674}Cornell goal,|Score tied, 3-3,
{13813}{13880}Come on, man! Quit!
{14085}{14174}I'll kick your ass back to Montreal!
{14313}{14366}Get up!
{14399}{14480}You're out of the game, Barrett.|Come on!
{14531}{14647}- Je vais te casser la gueule!|- I'll break yours before mine!
{14648}{14745}Come on, Barrett, get off the ice!
{14875}{14945}You Montreal faggots!
{14959}{15039}What?! Francis LaPierre|started the fight!
{15040}{15106}- Get in!|- Come on!
{15107}{15171}Five minutes for number seven. Fight.
{15172}{15316}Penalty, Barrett, Harvard,|Five minutes for fighting,
{17132}{17201}You probably want a steak, son.
{17223}{17291}No, thanks. The doctor took care of it.
{17292}{17367}I meant for your stomach, Oliver.
{17388}{17516}- I'm supposed to eat with the team.|- Oh, that's fine.
{17534}{17624}- Does your face hurt?|- No, sir.
{17657}{17773}- Jack Wells should take a look at it.|- That's not necessary.
{17774}{17875}- Jack's a specialist.|- It's nothing special.
{17899}{18032}- My car's there. Can I give you a lift?|- I'll walk you to your car.
{18056}{18139}Have you heard from the Law School?
{18140}{18235}I haven't exactly decided|on the Law School.
{18236}{18358}I was merely asking|if the Law School had decided on you.
{18382}{18450}- No.|- There really isn't any doubt.
{18451}{18576}- About what?|- The school needs good men like you.
{18577}{18721}- They haven't got a hockey team.|- You have other qualities, Oliver.
{18744}{18816}I'm sorry you had to see Harvard lose.
{18817}{18897}I came to see you play.
{18931}{19023}The Dean of the school|is an old classmate...
{19024}{19093}That's very nice, sir.
{19163}{19250}- Goodbye.|- Goodbye, sir.
{19357}{19444}- Give my best to Mother.|- Yes, I will.
{20022}{20089}Briggs Hall. Sandy Davidson.
{20090}{20146}Jennifer Cavilleri.
{20147}{20234}You have a call.|She's in the downstairs phone booth.
{20235}{20304}- Where is that?|- Around the corner.
{20384}{20496}Would you please...|For God's sake, Phil!
{20512}{20655}Yes. Yeah, yeah,|for the million-and-oneth time, yeah!
{20656}{20776}Absolutely! Oh, I love you, too, Phil.
{20777}{20849}Yeah, I love you, too.
{20850}{20904}Goodbye.
{20947}{21049}- What happened? You look terrible.|- I'm injured.
{21050}{21124}Did you make|the other guy look worse?
{21125}{21197}I always make|the other guy look worse.
{21215}{21283}- Jenny?|- Yeah?
{21284}{21382}- Who's Phil?|- My father.
{21456}{21507}You call your father Phil?
{21508}{21605}- It's his name, what do you call yours?|- Son-of-a-bitch.
{21606}{21693}- To his face?|- I never see his face.
{21694}{21778}- Why? Does he wear a mask?|- In a way.
{21780}{21864}He must be proud.|You're a Harvard jock.
{21865}{21963}- So was he.|- Bigger than All-lvy?
{21964}{22070}He rowed single sculls|in the 1928 Olympics.
{22071}{22142}- Did he win?|- No.
{22143}{22226}- Then why is he a son-of-a-bitch?|- He leans on me.
{22227}{22319}- He makes me do the right things.|- So?
{22320}{22465}I don't like to have to put out X amount|of achievement every term.
{22466}{22552}You hate making the Dean's list|and being All-lvy!
{22553}{22692}He expects no less, and when|I come through, he is so indifferent.
{22694}{22778}- Ridiculous!|- And what did he say after the game?
{22779}{22836}He went all that way to watch you play?
{22837}{22995}After we blew the title|and after I was nearly massacred,
{22996}{23060}do you know what he said to his son?
{23061}{23163}- Whores in lthaca?|- "l know the Dean of the Law School."
{23165}{23280}What did you expect him to say?|"How is your sex life?"
{23282}{23395}- Whose side are you on?|- I didn't know it was a war.
{23412}{23520}- You don't understand.|- More than you wish I did.
{23521}{23628}Did the son-of-a-bitch|at least get lousy grades?
{23629}{23769}- He was a Rhodes scholar.|- There's a problem of overachievement.
{23770}{23869}- Forget about it. There's no problem.|- Right.
{23870}{24016}Do I call my father on the phone?|Do I say, "l love you, Phil?"
{24017}{24083}- No.|- There you are.
{24084}{24214}And do you know why?|Because his name is Oliver.
{24251}{24367}The great Barrett Hall.|Don't you salute when you pass it?
{24368}{24481}- It's ugly. I've never been inside.|- That's a mature attitude.
{24482}{24559}It's not easy living with history.
{24560}{24694}- How many have to cope with that?|- I could name two.
{24708}{24747}Thanks.
{25058}{25148}Must you play music while we study?
{25149}{25254}I'm studying the music,|It's called "Analysis of Form",
{25255}{25294}Yeah,,,
{25295}{25365}You'll flunk if you just stare at me,
{25366}{25484}- I'm not, I'm studying,|- Bullshit, You're looking at my legs,
{25485}{25601}- You're not that great looking,|- I can't help if you think so,
{25602}{25702}- Let's change the subject,|- I wasn't aware there was one,
{25703}{25805}You think that I wanted|to make love to you,
{25806}{25954}- But I'm not interested,|- Then we've got one thing in common,
{25955}{26119}I'm tired of playing your game.|You are a supreme Radcliffe smart-ass.
{26120}{26187}The best. You put down|anything in pants.
{26188}{26292}But verbal volleyball|is not my idea of a relationship.
{26293}{26425}If that's what you think it's all about,|go back to your music waltz.
{26470}{26615}I think you're scared. You put up|a wall to keep from getting hurt,
{26616}{26718}but it also keeps you|from getting touched.
{26738}{26810}It's a risk, isn't it, Jenny?
{26858}{26966}At least I had the guts|to admit what I felt.
{26980}{27120}Some day you'll have to come up with|the courage to admit that you care.
{27203}{27249}I care.
{28666}{28782}- Would your priest like this?|- I don't have one.
{28830}{28987}- Aren't you a good Catholic girl?|- Well, I'm a girl...
{29026}{29098}...and I'm good, right?
{29142}{29213}So that's two out of three.
{29238}{29337}- Why do you wear it?|- It was my mother's.
{29354}{29471}Why did you leave the Church?
{29485}{29600}I don't know.|I never really joined.
{29635}{29765}I never thought there was another world|better than this one.
{29795}{29888}What could be better than Mozart?
{29902}{29954}Or Bach?
{29975}{30027}Or you?
{30073}{30133}Jenny?
{30185}{30275}I'm up there with Bach and Mozart?
{30312}{30385}And The Beatles.
{30639}{30722}- Let me sack in your couch.|- How come?
{30724}{30807}- Barrett.|- Who's the guest of honour?
{30808}{30902}- Cavilleri.|- Again? Still?
{30903}{30976}Barrett's slipping.
{31419}{31487}It's amazing.
{31568}{31647}I'm really studying.
{31648}{31744}- I'm studying.|- Sorry.
{31918}{31981}Oliver?
{32067}{32114}I love you.
{36869}{36912}You were great.
{36913}{37001}- You know nothing about music.|- I know enough.
{37002}{37150}Wise up, would you please, Barrett?|I wasn't great or All-lvy, just OK. OK?
{37189}{37228}OK.
{37229}{37354}- I mean you should keep at it.|- Who said I won't?
{37355}{37428}I'm going to study|with Nadia Boulanger.
{37429}{37469}Who?
{37470}{37577}Next year.|I have a scholarship in Paris.
{37591}{37628}Paris?
{37629}{37725}Yeah, I've never been to Europe.|I can hardly wait.
{37739}{37848}- How long have you known?|- It's inevitable.
{37849}{37878}What is?
{37880}{37966}That we'll separate.|You'll go to Law School.
{37967}{38096}- What are you talking about?|- You're a millionaire, I'm a social zero.
{38097}{38209}What do you mean?|We're together, we're happy.
{38210}{38350}Harvard is like a bag full of toys,|but when the holiday is over,
{38351}{38431}you have to go back|where you belong.
{38432}{38559}- Back to bake cookies?|- Pastries. Don't make fun of my father.
{38560}{38619}Then don't leave me, Jenny!
{38736}{38796}Please.
{38810}{38923}What about my scholarship|and Paris, which I've never seen?
{38924}{39037}- What about our marriage?|- Who said anything about marriage?
{39069}{39124}I'm saying it, now.
{39146}{39211}You want to marry me?
{39252}{39300}Yeah.
{39307}{39349}Why?
{39510}{39550}Because.
{39649}{39730}That's a good reason.
{40153}{40275}- You're driving like a maniac.|- Everybody does in Boston.
{40276}{40356}You'll kill us before|your parents can murder us.
{40357}{40459}- My parents will love you.|- Even the son-of-a-bitch?
{40460}{40571}Of course. Where is|the old Radcliffe confidence?
{40572}{40680}- Back at Radcliffe.|- It's going to be OK, Jenny.
{40681}{40787}- What did you say on the phone?|- Just that I'd drop by.
{40788}{40868}- Very casual, huh?|- Yeah, right.
{40869}{40947}How often do you visit during a term?
{40948}{41051}- Never.|- Oh, that's casual...
{41827}{41900}Holy shit!
{42015}{42110}Stop, Oliver. No kidding, stop the car.
{42331}{42411}I didn't think it would be like this,
{42413}{42492}- Like what?|- I mean, like this rich.
{42504}{42649}- This is too much for me.|- Don't worry. lt'll be a breeze.
{42650}{42819}Yeah, but why do I wish my name|were Abigail Adams or Wendy Wasp?
{42875}{42919}Don't be scared.
{42947}{43035}- Aren't you?|- No.
{43492}{43581}- So far, so good.|- That's not saying much.
{43582}{43643}- Your hand is cold.|- So is yours.
{43644}{43769}- Let's get away from here.|- Master Oliver! Hello!
{43770}{43846}Hello, Florence. This is Jenny.
{43847}{43943}"Master"? I always knew|you had slaves.
{44026}{44158}Let me take your wrap.|Your parents are in the drawing room.
{44243}{44310}Thank you, Florence.
{44365}{44444}Half the buildings of Harvard|are hanging there.
{44445}{44502}Oh, it's nothing.
{44515}{44588}You're related to|the Sewall Boat House?
{44589}{44695}Yes, I come from a long line|of wood and stone.
{44927}{44984}Hello there.
{45026}{45136}- I'd like you to meet Jennifer Calaveri.|- Cavilleri.
{45137}{45245}- As in "Cavalleria Rusticana"?|- Right. No relation.
{45246}{45321}- Hello, Mum.|- Hello, darling.
{45322}{45395}Nice to meet you.|How are you, son?
{45417}{45485}Fine, sir, fine.
{45499}{45596}Please sit down|and make yourself at home.
{45927}{45983}We'll have to go soon.
{46002}{46097}Why are you so uncomfortable|with your parents?
{46098}{46230}- Why did you want to leave at once?|- I didn't like how they treated you.
{46231}{46285}"What is it your parents are in?"
{46286}{46382}- What is it your people are in?|- My father bakes cookies.
{46383}{46493}- What's the name of the firm?|- Phil's Bake Shop.
{46494}{46603}- Of Cranston, Rhode lsland.|- How interesting...
{46604}{46738}- So your people are from Cranston?|- Mostly. My mother is from Fall River.
{46739}{46873}- The Barretts have mills in Fall River.|- Where they exploited the poor.
{46874}{46929}In the 19th century.
{46930}{47041}When you inherit,|you can give all our money back.
{47047}{47124}That's what the philosopher|Saint-Simon advocated.
{47125}{47190}In the 18th century.
{47263}{47345}- It's late.|- Aren't you staying for dinner?
{47346}{47411}- Yes.|- No. I have to get back.
{47412}{47503}You're staying for dinner|and that's an order.
{47504}{47593}Everything is an order,|a directive, a command.
{47594}{47657}Where is your sense of humour?
{47658}{47745}In school, he used to send me memos.
{47746}{47819}Memos! Don't you find that odd?
{47820}{47887}I find it rather cute.
{47945}{48005}Have you heard from Law School?
{48031}{48125}- Not yet.|- He'll get in. Who's better than Oliver?
{48126}{48212}I agree. He'll graduate with honours.
{48213}{48304}He's always done well in school.|At Exeter, he was...
{48305}{48445}It doesn't mean a thing.|I'm just one of many trying to get in.
{48469}{48611}- I could give Price Zimmermann a ring.|- No! I mean, please don't, sir.
{48619}{48676}Just to find out if he knows.
{48680}{48776}I want to get my letter|with everyone else. Please.
{48838}{48990}- He was only trying to be helpful.|- I don't need that kind of help.
{48991}{49065}- OK.|- No, it's not OK.
{49066}{49197}He's not going to be satisfied|until he cuts them off.
{49198}{49289}What you wouldn't like to be cut off.
{49290}{49391}Oh... Well, we've got|to take care of those.
{49392}{49551}- Take care.|- Get there a minute later, but get there.
{49682}{49820}- You really like to bug your father.|- The feeling is mutual.
{49821}{49910}You wouldn't stop at anything|to get to him.
{49911}{49999}It's impossible to get|to Oliver Barrett lll.
{50040}{50158}Unless maybe if you marry|Jennifer Cavilleri?
{50303}{50408}- Is that what you think?|- Yes, it's part of it.
{50434}{50500}You don't believe I love you?
{50502}{50626}Yes, but you also love|my negative social status.
{50627}{50688}No.
{50689}{50780}I can't pass judgement.|I just think so.
{50781}{50948}I love not only you,|but also your name and your numeral.
{50949}{51033}After all, it's part of what you are.
{51047}{51132}- Oh, how can you do it?|- What?
{51176}{51239}How can you see me|and still love me?
{51256}{51330}That's what it's about, preppy.
{52076}{52184}- How are you, son?|- I'm OK, sir.
{52186}{52264}Did you hear from Law School?
{52265}{52379}- Yes. I called you, remember?|- Yes. Congratulations.
{52380}{52498}- You'll be on the Supreme Court.|- I may just chase ambulances.
{52499}{52574}Fine. How's Raymond?
{52576}{52650}He's fine. Got into OCS.
{52651}{52737}Army? That's good.
{52738}{52810}That's bad.
{52843}{52919}You haven't mentioned Jennifer.
{52920}{53035}What is there to say? You're|presenting us with a fait accompli,
{53036}{53152}- But what did you think?|- She's absolutely charming.
{53153}{53246}With her background,|to get to Radcliffe is...
{53247}{53386}- Get to the point!|- It doesn't concern her, but you.
{53387}{53467}Your rebellion. And you are rebelling.
{53468}{53524}I fail...
{53541}{53703}I fail to see how marrying a brilliant|Radcliffe girl constitutes rebellion.
{53704}{53782}She's not some crazy hippie.
{53783}{53850}She's not many things.
{53863}{53961}What irks you most,|that she's Catholic or poor?
{53975}{54036}- What attracts you most?|- I'm leaving.
{54037}{54213}Don't go off half-cocked.|I would only ask that you wait a bit.
{54227}{54270}Define "bit".
{54271}{54377}Finish Law School.|If it's real, it'll stand the test of time.
{54378}{54464}It is real,|but why should I put it through a test?
{54465}{54556}- I'm asking you.|- You're commanding me!
{54557}{54702}If you marry her now,|I'll not give you the time of day.
{54729}{54811}Father, you don't know the time of day!
{55429}{55527}We're looking forward|to having you with us.
{55528}{55591}Me too, Dean Thompson.
{55615}{55705}- Something has come up.|- A change of heart?
{55706}{55795}No, I'm still set on Law School, but...
{55811}{55881}I'm going to need a scholarship.
{55908}{56001}- Really?|- That's why I'm here.
{56012}{56133}That's rather curious,|considering your background.
{56158}{56263}- I'm not his son anymore.|- I beg your pardon?
{56312}{56460}We have had a misunderstanding.|It's a parting of the ways.
{56495}{56645}- This is very unfortunate, Mr Barrett.|- I'm not exactly jumping for joy.
{56646}{56777}We have many entering students|in far worse straits than you.
{56778}{56905}What's worse than destitution?|I'm getting married next month.
{56906}{57061}We'll work all summer, and then|Jenny will teach in a private school.
{57076}{57187}That's a living, but not tuition.|Your tuition is pretty steep.
{57188}{57229}Yes.
{57281}{57388}I need a scholarship.|I have already been accepted.
{57389}{57504}- I don't have any money.|- You have a millionaire father.
{57505}{57650}Had, Why should I be penalised just|because I was related to a rich man?
{57651}{57852}Mr Barrett, I don't think that this office|should enter into a family quarrel.
{57853}{58000}- A rather distressing one, at that.|- I see. Thank you.
{58037}{58123}Perhaps at mid-year's.
{58182}{58272}Thank you. You've been|very generous with your time.
{58427}{58559}- We just passed my junior high school.|- I can't believe he liked my poverty.
{58560}{58650}He did! Now you've got|something in common.
{58651}{58740}God, when I first told him|Oliver Barrett...
{58741}{58837}- Yeah?|- He couldn't believe it.
{58838}{58926}He reminded me|of the Eleventh Commandment.
{58927}{59012}- Eleventh?|- "Do not bullshit thy father."
{59026}{59091}Any other commandments|I should know?
{59092}{59150}Yeah. "Stay loose."
{59666}{59785}- So is he for it? Does he approve?|- What do you think?
{59786}{59913}- I won't allow it, do you get me?|- You're tilting at windmills, Phil.
{59915}{60041}Stop calling his father a windmill.|He's a distinguished citizen...
{60042}{60093}- Mr Cavilleri...|- Phil.
{60094}{60222}- I'll call his goddamn father.|- It won't do any good, goddammit!
{60223}{60303}- Don't use profanity in this house.|- You do.
{60304}{60387}- What will he think?|- That you've gone mad.
{60389}{60471}Because I won't allow a parent|to reject a child?
{60472}{60553}- Mr Cavilleri...|- Phil.
{60575}{60670}Phil, sir... I reject him, too!
{60671}{60809}Don't talk like that. A father's love|is something to cherish and respect.
{60810}{60897}- It's a rare thing.|- Especially in my family.
{60898}{61005}- Let's get him on the phone.|- We have this cold line.
{61006}{61155}He'll thaw and melt. Believe me,|when it's time to go to church...
{61156}{61206}Let's get him on the phone.
{61227}{61306}- Please, Phil.|- What?
{61320}{61384}About the church bit...
{61385}{61469}Well, we're kind of negative on it.
{61540}{61648}I didn't necessarily mean|the Catholic Church.
{61742}{61869}You know that Jennifer is Catholic?|She may have told you that.
{61870}{61987}And her sainted mother|always dreamed of
{61988}{62104}the whole mass rigmarole,|but you're...
{62139}{62230}But God would bless this union|in any church.
{62251}{62292}- Phil?|- Yeah?
{62294}{62359}- About the God bit.|- Yeah?
{62360}{62484}- We're sort of negative about that, too.|- About God?
{62533}{62690}- About anybody's God?|- Neither of us believe.
{62691}{62761}And we won't be hypocrites.
{62831}{62957}If that's what you wish.|Just tell me who performs the wedding.
{62958}{63008}We do.
{63079}{63157}You mean to do it yourself?
{63248}{63335}That's...wonderful.
{63423}{63545}I mean, that's just...wonderful.
{63630}{63766}Do it yourself, huh?|I think that's just wonderful.
{63776}{63912}But, tell me, is it...?|What's the word?
{63915}{63993}- You mean "legal"?|- Is it?
{63994}{64132}Yes. One of the college chaplains|just sort of...
{64147}{64258}He presides over it,|and the couple address each other.
{64259}{64322}You mean the bride speaks, too?
{64404}{64566}- It's a new world, Philip.|- Oh, yeah. It's new, all right.
{64907}{64940}Ready?
{64941}{65048}- Amen.|- They haven't started, yet.
{65063}{65150}How will I know?|I've never been to a do-it-yourself.
{65151}{65255}Listen to the words they have chosen|to read on this occasion.
{65256}{65297}Amen.
{65317}{65392}The priest said "sacred".
{65413}{65509}- He's not a priest.|- He is to me.
{65770}{65880}"When our two souls stand up|erect and strong
{65883}{65991}"Face to face, silent,|drawing nigh and nigher
{65992}{66095}"Until the lengthening wings|break into fire at either curved point,
{66096}{66171}"What bitter wrong|can the earth do to us
{66172}{66245}"That we should not|long be here contented?
{66246}{66357}"Think! In mounting higher,|the angels would press on us
{66358}{66444}"And aspire to drop some golden orb|of perfect song
{66445}{66518}"lnto our deep, dear silence
{66531}{66607}"Let us stay rather on earth, Beloved,
{66608}{66731}"Where the unfit contrarious|moods of men recoil away

{66805}{66900}"And permit a place|to stand and love in for a day

{67578}{67669}"Shall we stick by each other|as long as we live?"
{67799}{67909}l, Oliver Barrett,|take you, Jennifer Cavilleri,
{67910}{68018}to be my wedded wife|from this day forward...
{68057}{68172}...to love and to cherish|till death do us part.
{68186}{68287}l, Jennifer Cavilleri,|take you, Oliver Barrett,
{68288}{68391}as my wedded husband|from this day forward,
{68392}{68495}to love and to cherish|till death do us part.
{68815}{68903}By the authority vested in me by|the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
{68904}{68981}I pronounce you man and wife.
{69102}{69154}Now I'm being kept.
{69155}{69233}- You won't like it.|- I already do.
{69234}{69321}The school only pays me 3,000 a year.
{69322}{69408}- Why?|- Because my name is Mrs Barrett.
{69409}{69566}- Couldn't you be Miss Cavilleri?|- Then I'd be the Queen of Paris.
{69567}{69604}It's a bargain.
{69605}{69725}Four rooms for 82.50 a month|is impossible this side of Mongolia.
{69726}{69822}But this is the Mongolian section|of Cambridge.
{70006}{70058}Gee...
{70059}{70187}I have to admit that|it's even worse than I expected.
{70188}{70274}- Yeah, but it's home.|- Yeah.
{70288}{70344}- Well?|- Well what?
{70345}{70456}- Carry me over the threshold.|- Do you believe that nonsense?
{70457}{70551}- Carry me and I'll tell you.|- We're at the top floor!
{70552}{70641}OK, I'll be a young|and beautiful divorcee.
{70669}{70745}Hey, what is this, Barrett?
{70746}{70831}I'll tell you after we cross the threshold.
{70950}{71020}- This is not a threshold.|- Our name is there.
{71021}{71130}It's not an official threshold.|Upstairs, you preppy!
{71263}{71351}- Why are you so heavy?|- I might be pregnant.
{71352}{71431}- Are you?|- Scared you, didn't l?
{71432}{71509}- No, l...|- Don't bullshit me.
{71510}{71629}For a second I clutched.|Is this the official threshold?
{71630}{71697}- What do think?|- If you don't say yes...
{71698}{71752}Yes!
{73353}{73418}- Where's Barrett?|- Where are the kids?
{73419}{73563}Asleep, thank God. It's siesta time.|I've got 45 minutes.
{73564}{73631}That's more than they give me.
{73901}{73951}Damn it!
{73952}{74044}- What's wrong with this engine?|- You're a Harvard Magna.
{74045}{74127}- Not in mechanics.|- Welcome to the world, preppy.
{74128}{74209}- Listen, Cavilleri...|- The name's Barrett, Barrett.
{74210}{74300}Sometimes you are really a bitch.
{74485}{74572}- How are they treating you?|- Fine, except for one brat.
{74574}{74639}He'll be breaking and entering|before 10.
{74640}{74720}- What now?|- He tried to pinch me.
{74744}{74835}- I don't blame him.|- Next time, I'll wallop him.
{74836}{74916}Not until you get his parents' tip.
{74983}{75036}Damn it!
{75113}{75192}- Let's get out of here.|- Don't touch me.
{75193}{75317}- What a thing to say to your husband!|- Wash. You can touch me afterwards.
{75332}{75462}I had another salary hassle today|with Miss Anne Miller Whitman.
{75463}{75658}- I hope you laid it on thick this time.|- I told her I was proud to work for them.
{75659}{75756}I said, "Even Barretts|have to pay their rent."
{75757}{75855}- To which she retorted...|- "Ho, ho, ho!"
{75889}{76011}- Define "Ho, ho, ho".|- 3,500 for the year.
{76012}{76055}Ridiculous!
{76056}{76192}Would you like to support me while l|take courses to teach in public school?
{76258}{76362}- Would you please say something?|- Ho, ho, ho.
{77521}{77630}- I thought you'd call after the meeting.|- I wanted you to study.
{77631}{77703}- Have you eaten?|- I waited for you.
{77704}{77777}- You're a growing boy.|- Not anymore.
{77779}{77860}Yes, in the mind.|Did you check the mail?
{77862}{77943}Just one second.|This is a crucial precedent.
{78146}{78252}- Did you check the mail?|- No. Anything vital?
{78253}{78358}- We are cordially invited...|- ...to pay the light bill.
{78359}{78414}To a dinner.
{78427}{78513}Your father's 60th birthday.
{78564}{78626}- Did you hear me?|- Yes.
{78627}{78681}RSVP.
{78697}{78783}- You even have to ask?|- It's about time.
{78784}{78833}- For what?|- You know.
{78834}{78921}Does he have to crawl here?|He's reaching out.
{78922}{78987}My mother addressed it.
{79001}{79128}Think. 60 years old. Maybe he won't|be around for a reconciliation.
{79129}{79177}There won't be one.
{79178}{79271}- Oliver V will bug you...|- He won't be called that!
{79272}{79397}He can be called Bozo. He'll still|resent you for being a Harvard jock!
{79398}{79490}- You'll be on the Supreme Court...|- He won't resent me!
{79491}{79547}- Why not?|- Because l...
{79548}{79654}Your father loves you|like you'll love Bozo,
{79655}{79786}but you Barretts are so proud that you'll|always think you hate each other.
{79787}{79889}If it weren't for you?|The case is closed!
{80006}{80156}- There's still the RSVP.|- I think you can handle it.
{80176}{80288}I have never deliberately hurt anyone,|and I don't think I could.
{80289}{80353}Jennifer!
{80354}{80428}Just answer no.
{80442}{80565}- OK. What's the number?|- Can't you write a note?
{80566}{80644}I'll lose my nerve.|What's the number?
{80645}{80763}338-3434, and dial 1 first.
{81160}{81323}Good evening, this is Jennifer Barrett.|Mr Barrett! Good evening, sir.
{81324}{81390}Fine, thank you.
{81391}{81460}Yes, we did. That's why I'm calling.
{81461}{81574}I'm terribly sorry,|I mean we're terribly sorry,
{81575}{81650}but... no we can't.
{81682}{81739}I'm sorry.
{81763}{81859}Oliver, please talk to him.|Just say hello.
{81875}{81986}- I will never talk to him.|- Can't you do it for me?
{81987}{82147}I've never asked you to do anything|in my whole life. Just for me.
{82148}{82186}No.
{82265}{82333}You're a heartless bastard.
{82372}{82460}Mr Barrett?|Oliver would like you to know,
{82461}{82572}that in his own special way,|he loves you very much.
{82573}{82642}Get the hell out of my life!
{88210}{88257}I forgot my key.
{88309}{88395}Jenny, I'm sorry.
{88406}{88466}Don't.
{88467}{88541}Love means|never having to say you're sorry.
{93256}{93366}Concentrate on blending|and stop showing off your voice.
{93367}{93440}But I wasn't!
{93465}{93577}- No bullshit. You were showing off.|- Sorry, Jenny.
{93578}{93688}One last time and this time|I want crisp diction.
{94830}{94982}Wow! That was really|incredibly, absolutely...
{95008}{95059}...not bad.
{95140}{95273}- Tomorrow at 8.30, OK?|- OK. Bye, Jenny.
{95728}{95795}Well, Barrett,|what brings you to church?
{95808}{95866}The saloons closed early.
{95938}{96003}Did you get us a tree?
{96028}{96116}Don't worry about it.|We'll get one on the way home.
{96187}{96250}What are you doing New Year's Eve?
{96291}{96353}Sleeping.
{96460}{96523}I thought you'd want|to spend it with me.
{96546}{96621}What are you doing?
{96622}{96688}Sleeping.
{96798}{96899}Some day, we'll look back|on these days...
{96900}{96979}The sooner, the better.
{97143}{97200}Go!
{97330}{97396}Jennifer, come here!
{97436}{97511}Jennifer, come here!
{97512}{97627}What? Come on!|Start it over again.
{97628}{97722}- What is it?|- I have something important to tell you.
{97723}{97835}- Couldn't you tell me over there?|- No, I want to be alone with you.
{97866}{97940}Fantastic news. Here, read.
{97941}{98024}Harvard Law School?|You got kicked out.
{98026}{98107}Read it, will you?|It's great news.
{98109}{98245}- You were first in the class?|- Not quite. Third.
{98264}{98387}- Only third, huh?|- That means I make the Law Review.
{98450}{98516}Say something, please.
{98517}{98620}Not until I've met|numbers one and two.
{98952}{99137}And the William DeJersey Memorial|Award for the finest senior essay to...

{101044}{101096}That's us.
{101097}{101222}You won't laugh? I'm actually|getting to like the name Bozo.
{101223}{101288}- For what?|- Our kid.
{101289}{101353}Our huge and bruising All-lvy tackle.
{101354}{101461}- Bozo Barrett?|- It's the name of a Harvard superjock.
{101462}{101574}You would actually call|our offspring Bozo?
{101576}{101638}Only if it's a boy.
{101939}{102019}- We have crossed the poverty line.|- Not quite.
{102021}{102098}- What?|- Not until I'm carried over the threshold.
{102099}{102200}- We've done that!|- Now you're a lawyer. lt'll be legal.
{102201}{102300}- It's on the tenth floor!|- Carry me in the elevator.

{105006}{105149}- Whose fault is it?|- I wouldn't use the word "fault".
{105162}{105245}OK, we'll put it your way.
{105280}{105436}Two 24-year-olds can't make a baby.|One must be malfunctioning. Who?
{105437}{105493}Jenny.
{105549}{105618}All right, then we'll adopt kids.
{105619}{105753}The problem is more serious.|Jenny is very sick.
{105814}{105863}Define "very sick".
{105918}{105967}She's dying.
{106123}{106180}That's impossible.
{106181}{106252}I'm sorry to have to tell you this.
{106309}{106374}That's impossible.
{106408}{106481}It's a mistake, it has to be.
{106483}{106624}We repeated her blood test three times.|The diagnosis is correct.
{106641}{106715}She'll have to be told soon.
{106716}{106830}We can withhold treatment|for a little while, but not for long.
{106858}{106971}We'll have to begin therapy|sometime during the next few weeks.
{106986}{107048}She's only 24.
{107166}{107246}- Will it be painful?|- Hopefully not.
{107247}{107386}You'll want to talk to a haematologist.|I can refer you to Dr Addison.
{107425}{107480}Yeah.
{107521}{107622}What do I do?|What can I do for Jenny?
{107641}{107769}Act as normal as possible,|for as long as possible.
{107799}{107870}That's really the best thing.
{107921}{107983}Normal.
{108002}{108105}OK, I'll be as normal as hell.
{110319}{110370}Jen?
{110420}{110483}Jenny, I'm home.
{110500}{110573}- I need a lawyer.|- I'm a lawyer.
{110574}{110636}I need you.
{110637}{110733}- I need you, too.|- Why? I'm not a lawyer.
{110734}{110838}No, but you're a nut,|and I happen to need a nut.
{110860}{110950}- You look lovely, Jenny.|- Bullshit.
{110951}{111058}- OK, you look terrible.|- No, I never look terrible.
{111059}{111178}- I look OK for Thursday evening, OK?|- There's no poetry in "OK".
{111179}{111271}Screw poetry.|Just tell me what you see.
{111284}{111377}- I see you.|- That's poetry.
{111378}{111499}Did Dr Shapeley tell you|that we both checked out?
{111500}{111537}Yeah.
{111538}{111634}So we just have to keep trying, right?
{111655}{111778}- Yeah, let's try now.|- At this very minute?
{111780}{111842}Even sooner.
{112358}{112402}Jenny?
{112497}{112637}Get out there and support me in|the manner to which I'll be accustomed.
{112654}{112707}Get up.
{112758}{112838}- Are you meeting Stratton today?|- Who?
{112839}{112963}Ray Stratton, your best friend.|Your roommate before me.
{112988}{113126}- We're supposed to play, but I'll cancel.|- The hell you will!
{113127}{113226}- Why not?|- I don't want a flabby husband.
{113227}{113326}- All right, but I'll take you out to dinner.|- Why?
{113327}{113412}Can't I take my wife|to dinner if I want to?
{113413}{113538}- OK, Barrett, what's her name?|- What?
{113539}{113657}If you take your wife out in the middle|of the week, you're screwing somebody.
{114110}{114189}- What's the matter?|- Off day.
{114190}{114273}You've had an off day|for two weeks now.
{114274}{114389}Jonas wants me to go to Chicago|on a big case.
{114418}{114493}That newscaster|that got beat up by the cops.
{114494}{114588}Fantastic. You on the other side|of a punch-out rap.
{114589}{114649}- I turned him down.|- Why?
{114650}{114756}I couldn't see living in some hotel.
{114757}{114843}Boy, you're really married!
{114875}{114946}Your time will come.
{116445}{116487}Mrs Barrett!
{116488}{116555}I'm in the kitchen where I belong.|Come here.
{116556}{116641}- Guess what.|- You got fired.
{116642}{116756}- I got fired up. Guess where to.|- Reno, Nevada.
{116757}{116829}Paris, France.|We'll be there Christmas Day.
{116884}{116970}No, that's not the way we'll do it.
{116971}{117084}- Do what?|- I don't want Paris, I don't need Paris.
{117085}{117201}- I just want you.|- That you got, baby.
{117236}{117345}And I want time,|which you can't give me.
{117477}{117553}You saw Dr Shapeley?
{117568}{117667}And his buddy, too.|He's a very nice guy.
{117719}{117784}- Good. Who?|- Dr Addison.
{117786}{117930}He's a Yalie, college and med school.|But I said you wouldn't mind.
{117968}{118031}Not if he's nice.
{118032}{118131}He didn't bullshit me,|and that's what I wanted.
{118222}{118346}- OK, then for the Yalie doctor.|- OK.
{118644}{118770}I'm counting on you to be strong,|you goddamn hockey jock.
{118783}{118859}I will, baby. I will.
{118930}{119026}It will be hardest for Phil.
{119060}{119156}You, after all, are going to be|the merry widower.
{119232}{119368}- I won't be merry.|- Yes, you will. I want you to be merry.
{119383}{119454}You'll be merry, OK?
{119505}{119557}OK.
{119580}{119630}OK.
{121912}{122018}- Enough?|- No. I love watching you.
{122019}{122169}- The old hockey fake-out.|- That's you, the old hockey fake-out.
{122170}{122267}- Can we get hot chocolate?|- Sure, I'll even pay.
{122268}{122426}- Very gracious of you.|- I liked it best when I supported you.
{122427}{122548}You always supported me.|After all, what's money?
{122562}{122622}I don't know.
{122802}{122911}- Could we afford a taxi?|- Sure. Where do you want to go?
{122949}{123021}The hospital.
{125236}{125372}She's getting white cells and platelets,|which she needs most.
{125373}{125473}- She doesn't want antimetabolites.|- What's that?
{125474}{125620}A treatment that slows cell destruction.|But there are unpleasant side effects.
{125621}{125700}Jenny's the boss.|Whatever she wants.
{125701}{125810}Do everything you can|to make sure it doesn't hurt.
{125811}{125896}- We will.|- I don't care what it costs.
{125897}{125979}- It could take months.|- Screw the cost.
{125980}{126095}There's no way of knowing|how long she'll linger.
{126096}{126177}I want her to have the very best.
{126178}{126331}I'm wealthy. I'm rich.|Really, I'm like a millionaire.
{127311}{127389}- How have you been?|- Fine, sir.
{127390}{127497}- And how is Jennifer?|- She's fine, sir.
{127605}{127715}I need to borrow 5,000 dollars|for a very good reason.
{127831}{127906}Well?
{127907}{128011}- Sir?|- May I know the reason?
{128027}{128124}I can't tell you.|Just lend me the money, please.
{128126}{128221}- Don't they pay you at the firm?|- Yes, sir.
{128222}{128331}- And doesn't she teach...|- Don't call her "she".
{128355}{128420}- Doesn't Jennifer...|- Leave her out of it.
{128421}{128564}Just write out a cheque.|It's a very important personal matter.
{128583}{128657}You got some girl in trouble?
{128701}{128777}Yeah, that's it.
{128910}{128961}Please lend me the money.
{130036}{130114}Thank you, Father.
{131773}{131806}How is she?
{131807}{131879}She wants the troops home|for Christmas.
{131880}{131977}- Always running the show.|- She may succeed.
{131990}{132069}- That fast?|- Yes.
{132530}{132579}Hello, baby.
{132592}{132633}Phil.
{132634}{132698}How is it going, Mrs B?
{132713}{132815}It's going, preppy.|The troops will be home for Christmas.
{132816}{132899}- That's a little trite.|- It's the goddamn truth.
{132922}{133016}Watch your language.|There's a grown-up present.
{133036}{133132}I hope so. Phil made a few promises.
{133133}{133192}Don't worry, Jenny.
{133251}{133331}Maybe I ought to let you guys...
{133332}{133401}I'll be nearby.
{133636}{133702}It doesn't hurt, Ollie.
{133742}{133838}It's like falling off|a cliff in slow motion.
{133877}{133956}Only after a while you wish you'd hit|the ground already, you know?
{134005}{134043}Yeah.
{134048}{134133}Bullshit. You've never fallen off a cliff.
{134156}{134252}Yes, I did. When I met you.
{134293}{134346}Yeah.
{134347}{134424}"What a falling off was there."
{134444}{134528}- Who said that?|- I don't know. Shakespeare?
{134529}{134606}Yeah, but who?
{134626}{134691}I mean, what play?
{134692}{134767}I went to Radcliffe, I'm supposed|to remember those things.
{134909}{134990}I once knew all|the Mozart Kochel listings.
{135028}{135122}- Big deal.|- You bet it was.
{135163}{135259}What number is|the A Major Concerto?
{135288}{135446}- I don't know. I'll look it up.|- But I used to know all those things.
{135498}{135617}- Do you want to talk music?|- What do you want to talk? Funerals?
{135693}{135762}No, I don't.
{135924}{135980}Ollie?
{136000}{136111}I told Phil you could have|a Catholic service
{136112}{136216}and you'd say OK. OK?
{136283}{136376}lt'll really help him a lot, you know?
{136430}{136484}OK.
{136536}{136627}Now you've got to stop being sick.
{136628}{136679}Me?
{136693}{136788}That guilty look on your face,|it's sick.
{136958}{137094}Stop blaming yourself,|you stupid preppy. It's nobody's fault.
{137239}{137313}It's not your fault.
{137455}{137555}That's the only thing I'll ask you.|Otherwise, you'll be OK.
{137994}{138067}Screw Paris!
{138132}{138173}What?
{138203}{138323}Screw Paris and music and everything|you thought you stole from me.
{138341}{138430}I don't care, don't you believe that?
{138682}{138790}Then get the hell out of here!|I don't want you at my deathbed!
{138916}{138988}I believe you.
{138990}{139061}I really do.
{139105}{139163}That's better.
{139274}{139368}Would you please|do something for me?
{139516}{139574}Would you please hold me?
{139864}{139967}I mean really hold me. Next to me.
{141791}{141842}Philip?
{142138}{142193}I wish...
{142305}{142397}I wish I hadn't promised Jenny...
{142535}{142644}I wish I hadn't promised Jenny|to be strong for you.
{143724}{143773}Oliver.
{143791}{143853}Why didn't you tell me?
{143854}{143978}I made some calls, and when I found out|I jumped in the car.
{143979}{144052}Oliver, I want to help.
{144073}{144122}Jenny's dead.
{144189}{144243}- I'm sorry.|- Love...
{144300}{144394}Love means never having to say you're sorry.
