1
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,920
<i>(Dr Lemmon) A chimpanzee infant left
with his mother is a thing, a lump.</i>

2
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:28,106
Taken away, he acquires

3
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:30,995
human psychological test performances

4
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:32,999
which are well-nigh unbelievable.

5
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:46,544
<i>(Stephanie) Nim was born
at the primate centre in Oklahoma</i>

6
00:01:46,488 --> 00:01:49,237
<i>and I went out there to get him.</i>

7
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:55,060
<i>I had never been near
that many chimpanzees.</i>

8
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:57,092
<i>It was frightening, intimidating,</i>

9
00:01:57,531 --> 00:02:00,482
<i>and I knew Dr Lemmon and his wife
were watching me</i>

10
00:02:00,446 --> 00:02:03,019
<i>to see what kind of a
mother would I be.</i>

11
00:02:06,285 --> 00:02:11,035
<i>Carolyn, Nim's mother,
was sitting right there holding Nim,</i>

12
00:02:12,685 --> 00:02:15,312
<i>and she knew what was going
to happen better than I did.</i>

13
00:02:15,646 --> 00:02:21,651
<i>She had had six of her previous babies
removed, apparently, in the same way.</i>

14
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:29,228
(door opening)

15
00:02:29,253 --> 00:02:33,626
<i>When the time came
to take Nim from his mother,</i>

16
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:39,515
<i>she instantly took on this drama,</i>

17
00:02:39,374 --> 00:02:41,446
<i>this feeling of
something about to happen.</i>

18
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:46,106
(chimpanzee screeching)

19
00:02:46,097 --> 00:02:50,337
<i>And Dr Lemmon shot her
with a tranquilising gun</i>

20
00:02:50,577 --> 00:02:52,200
(chimpanzee screaming)

21
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,003
<i>And then said,</i>

22
00:02:55,013 --> 00:02:59,723
<i>"Quick, we have to get him before
she falls over and falls on him. "</i>

23
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:03,547
<i>She was trying to protect him
and cradle him.</i>

24
00:03:05,175 --> 00:03:07,552
So, he raced in and got Nim

25
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,834
and handed Nim to me

26
00:03:12,578 --> 00:03:16,908
and said, "Go back."
You know, go back in the other space.

27
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:30,307
<i>He was very dense.</i>

28
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:34,930
<i>Unlike a human baby that has fat,</i>

29
00:03:35,661 --> 00:03:37,706
<i>he was dense and hard.</i>

30
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:41,238
<i>He didn't struggle.
He didn't try to get away.</i>

31
00:03:41,224 --> 00:03:42,680
<i>He just screamed.</i>

32
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:48,124
<i>As much as he may be screaming
and protesting, he's also clinging.</i>

33
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:51,738
He was attaching for dear life.

34
00:04:15,112 --> 00:04:17,070
<i>(Herb) Wouldn't it be exciting</i>

35
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,854
<i>to communicate with a chimp</i>

36
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:22,309
<i>and find out what it was thinking?</i>

37
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,935
<i>If they could be
taught to articulate</i>

38
00:04:26,907 --> 00:04:31,824
<i>what they were thinking about, this
would be an incredible expansion</i>

39
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,547
<i>of human communication,
and possibly give us some insight</i>

40
00:04:35,472 --> 00:04:39,252
<i>into how language, in
fact, did evolve.</i>

41
00:04:40,077 --> 00:04:43,442
<i>And that's essentially
why I started Project Nim.</i>

42
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,328
(phone ringing)

43
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:49,393
<i>(Stephanie) I don't know what
was in his mind, but he just called.</i>

44
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:56,291
<i>He was asking me to bring
an infant chimpanzee into my home,</i>

45
00:04:56,436 --> 00:04:59,847
<i>raise this infant as
if he were a child,</i>

46
00:05:00,195 --> 00:05:02,869
<i>and see if he acquired language</i>

47
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:05,833
<i>as a function of being
part of a family.</i>

48
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:10,121
<i>(Herb) Stephanie was
a former student of mine.</i>

49
00:05:10,954 --> 00:05:15,539
<i>She had a large family of her own
children and her husband's children,</i>

50
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:18,908
<i>was exceedingly empathic and warm.</i>

51
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,912
A chimp could not have a better mother.

52
00:05:23,563 --> 00:05:26,136
<i>(Stephanie) I know nothing
about chimpanzees,</i>

53
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:29,706
and I never actually
sat down to study them

54
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,197
as one could have.
As I should have, perhaps.

55
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,328
<i>But my appetite and my drive
to have that intimate a relationship</i>

56
00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:41,991
<i>with an animal was...
Nothing would have stopped that.</i>

57
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:47,186
The fact that we could share language
with an animal

58
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,704
seemed like a very radical possibility
at that time.

59
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:53,633
<i>(Herb) It had been
known for some time</i>

60
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:56,973
<i>that chimps aren't able to make
the sounds of human language.</i>

61
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:59,501
- Do this, Viki. (blows raspberry)
- (blows raspberry)

62
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:02,660
<i>So why not teach them sign language?</i>

63
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,939
<i>The real breakthrough would be</i>

64
00:06:06,328 --> 00:06:09,080
<i>if, like human children,
a chimpanzee</i>

65
00:06:09,045 --> 00:06:11,505
<i>could create grammatical sentences.</i>

66
00:06:13,726 --> 00:06:18,601
So, without much preparation
and without really asking permission

67
00:06:18,652 --> 00:06:22,268
of my children, my husband,
I said, "Fine, I can do it."

68
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:26,755
<i>"I even have the funds to do it with.
We don't need to worry about money. "</i>

69
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:30,879
<i>And so it was launched.
The experiment was launched.</i>

70
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,371
<i>(Herb) When Nim came to New York,
he was barely two weeks old.</i>

71
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:40,269
<i>The idea was that he would be treated,
in every way, like a human infant.</i>

72
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:48,166
<i>(Stephanie) I had recently moved to
a brownstone on the Upper West Side</i>

73
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:50,051
<i>with my three children</i>

74
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:53,117
<i>and with my husband,
who had four children, Wer Lafarge.</i>

75
00:06:54,774 --> 00:06:58,519
<i>Wer was a poet and a writer.</i>

76
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:04,327
<i>He redefined himself, became what, at
that time, was called a rich hippie.</i>

77
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:13,628
<i>A new husband, new
family, new house,</i>

78
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:19,171
<i>and I brought Nim into
that rather turbulent situation.</i>

79
00:07:23,144 --> 00:07:27,057
<i>(Jenny) It just happened.
There was no family discussion about,</i>

80
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:28,931
<i>"Should we? Shouldn't we?"</i>

81
00:07:28,946 --> 00:07:31,060
<i>It was just, "Oh, we're
having a chimp."</i>

82
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,421
<i>We're going to teach
it sign language.</i>

83
00:07:34,947 --> 00:07:38,066
<i>And then the reality of it is sort of
hitting you that it's really...</i>

84
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:40,642
<i>You know, it's alive,
it's not a doll, it's not a toy,</i>

85
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:46,752
<i>it's not a human, it's a chimp
and it's an amazing, sweet little</i>

86
00:07:47,148 --> 00:07:51,187
<i>newborn baby, needy creature, so...</i>

87
00:07:52,947 --> 00:07:56,193
I think I fell in love instantly.

88
00:07:57,983 --> 00:07:59,858
<i>(Stephanie) Nim didn't like Wer.</i>

89
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:04,472
<i>And Wer didn't like him.</i>

90
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:09,824
Almost instantly I saw how complicated
this was going to be.

91
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:13,145
<i>(Jenny) I think Wer
went along with it.</i>

92
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:17,457
It was clearly Stephanie sort of saying,
"Let's have a chimp."

93
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,304
It was the '70s! (laughs)

94
00:08:22,907 --> 00:08:25,701
<i>(Stephanie) I breast-fed him
for a couple of months.</i>

95
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,340
<i>It seemed completely natural.</i>

96
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,874
<i>Everything was about treating him
like a human being.</i>

97
00:08:35,753 --> 00:08:40,169
<i>By the time I had Nim, of course,
I felt very comfortable with babies.</i>

98
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,962
I wasn't prepared at all
for the wild animal in him

99
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,749
and the drive.

100
00:08:51,515 --> 00:08:55,014
<i>By the time he was
three months old, I think,</i>

101
00:08:55,558 --> 00:08:58,257
<i>and starting to be ambulatory,</i>

102
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,987
<i>he was just right there,</i>

103
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:04,868
<i>nothing passive, nothing
passive, ever.</i>

104
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:13,772
I think he figured that he could just
get in between Wer and Stephanie

105
00:09:14,398 --> 00:09:15,808
on some level.

106
00:09:20,522 --> 00:09:25,352
And Wer put his arm around her,
and Nim just, you know,

107
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:28,567
half asleep, having a bottle,

108
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:32,018
turned and bit Wer on the arm
quite hard.

109
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,360
He didn't want Wer in the picture.

110
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,987
He wanted Stephanie all for himself.

111
00:09:40,403 --> 00:09:42,809
<i>(Stephanie) Wer definitely
felt excluded.</i>

112
00:09:44,242 --> 00:09:46,991
<i>Nim had just become
part of my being.</i>

113
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:52,056
<i>That was incompatible
with the role that I played as wife.</i>

114
00:09:54,048 --> 00:09:55,458
(phone ringing)

115
00:09:59,926 --> 00:10:02,878
<i>(Jenny) "Herb's coming,
Herb's coming, Herb's coming. "</i>

116
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:05,054
<i>"Herb's coming" was a big deal.</i>

117
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:10,871
<i>(Herb) I would just go over and visit
, just to see what his state was</i>

118
00:10:10,808 --> 00:10:12,766
<i>and how he was getting along.</i>

119
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:16,872
<i>(Stephanie) Herb was
infinitely exciting.</i>

120
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:23,165
<i>I admired his intellect and his goals
and his arrogance, all those things.</i>

121
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:31,228
There was something that didn't
sit right with me about him.

122
00:10:35,173 --> 00:10:39,007
<i>(Stephanie) The people that I am
the closest to, throughout my life,</i>

123
00:10:38,932 --> 00:10:43,427
<i>are people that I have had
some period of sexual contact with.</i>

124
00:10:44,572 --> 00:10:49,315
I don't think
that the previous sexual relationship

125
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,127
between Herb and myself

126
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:53,423
made a difference to the project at all,

127
00:10:54,932 --> 00:10:57,894
other than it was part of the glue

128
00:10:58,538 --> 00:10:59,947
that allowed it to happen.

129
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:05,695
<i>Herb didn't come very much.</i>

130
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,024
<i>He wasn't part of
the caretaking package at all.</i>

131
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,913
Young newborn chimps

132
00:11:13,903 --> 00:11:16,819
are always raised by their mothers,
not by their fathers.

133
00:11:18,099 --> 00:11:21,096
And I didn't see any way
of trying to change...

134
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,770
Or any point in trying to change that.

135
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:29,994
<i>For better or worse,
I never regarded him as a child.</i>

136
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,605
<i>I regarded him</i>

137
00:11:32,463 --> 00:11:36,166
<i>as an intelligent, personable centre
of a scientific project.</i>

138
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:43,384
<i>I had an implicit faith
that Nim would learn signs.</i>

139
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:45,803
<i>We had to wait and see.</i>

140
00:11:48,504 --> 00:11:51,589
<i>(Stephanie) How do they start
teaching the child to sign?</i>

141
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:55,535
Does the child just watch and...
Whatever. I don't know.

142
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:58,207
It was a problem. We were trying
to teach this chimp sign language

143
00:11:58,187 --> 00:12:00,804
and nobody in the house
really was fluent in sign language.

144
00:12:00,864 --> 00:12:04,454
We would mould his hand into
the sign for "drink", which is this,

145
00:12:05,186 --> 00:12:08,058
and then give him the bottle to drink.

146
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:19,163
It just happened.

147
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:21,520
<i>(Stephanie) It was just amazing.</i>

148
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,159
<i>And I thought, "Piece of cake."</i>

149
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,627
I was absolutely delighted.

150
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:32,010
<i>He picked up quite a few signs
after that rather quickly.</i>

151
00:12:34,468 --> 00:12:37,262
<i>"Eat", "me", "Nim"</i>

152
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:39,523
<i>were part of his first signs.</i>

153
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:41,044
<i>"Hug" was another one.</i>

154
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,114
<i>And it was as if, then,
"Okay, we're off.</i>

155
00:12:47,115 --> 00:12:49,901
<i>"Now we just got to
build up the vocabulary. "</i>

156
00:12:50,715 --> 00:12:52,590
As much as we were moulding him,

157
00:12:52,593 --> 00:12:55,962
we were moulding these damn hands
and all this stuff,

158
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:57,538
he was starting to mould us.

159
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:02,496
<i>He knew every dynamic
that was in the room, instantly.</i>

160
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:05,939
<i>(Jenny) He knew when you were upset.</i>

161
00:13:05,955 --> 00:13:09,161
<i>Whatever had happened in,
you know, a 13-, 14-year-old's life.</i>

162
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,796
And he would come over and he would
just come and sit with you and hug you,

163
00:13:14,678 --> 00:13:17,252
and then just kiss the tears away.

164
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:21,449
<i>You know, it was amazing.
Just unconditional.</i>

165
00:13:23,758 --> 00:13:27,044
<i>(Stephanie) He was my life line,
he was my buddy,</i>

166
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,368
<i>and he was bringing
something out in me,</i>

167
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,582
<i>a freedom to defy expectation
and authority.</i>

168
00:13:36,242 --> 00:13:40,025
<i>His greatest focus
of defiance was against Wer.</i>

169
00:13:41,644 --> 00:13:44,731
<i>(Jenny) He would kind of
pull books off the shelves,</i>

170
00:13:44,722 --> 00:13:47,182
and Wer liked his books a certain way.

171
00:13:47,164 --> 00:13:50,696
When he saw Wer coming,
he would really do it.

172
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:54,312
It was very focused. It was intentional.

173
00:13:54,321 --> 00:13:56,233
"Fuck you, I'm touching these."

174
00:13:59,723 --> 00:14:01,141
It was a problem.

175
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:04,848
<i>(Stephanie) Wer was so impotent.</i>

176
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:09,595
<i>I mean, what could he do? He'd chase
him around. "Drop that! Blah, blah."</i>

177
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:11,874
<i>I mean, he won every time.</i>

178
00:14:20,053 --> 00:14:25,468
<i>Nim saw Herb
as his next adult male challenge.</i>

179
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:28,447
<i>I mean, that is the life
that he's hard-wired for.</i>

180
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:33,145
To take on increasingly powerful
male figures until he's the top.

181
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,956
When Herb would come over,
expecting to step in

182
00:14:36,935 --> 00:14:40,380
and have control of Nim,
and he couldn't and didn't,

183
00:14:40,932 --> 00:14:43,426
we loved it. We loved it.

184
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:47,732
<i>(Herb) I cornered Nim</i>

185
00:14:48,977 --> 00:14:52,262
and just went to pull him out of some

186
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:55,120
hiding place, and he bit me.

187
00:14:56,694 --> 00:15:00,149
<i>(Stephanie) Frankly, everybody in
the family got a kick out of Nim</i>

188
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,385
<i>doing just what Herb hated.</i>

189
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:05,191
<i>No one ever put him in his place,</i>

190
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:08,420
<i>and he just grew
more and more and more powerful,</i>

191
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:10,751
<i>and that was exciting to me.</i>

192
00:15:15,504 --> 00:15:18,367
<i>We didn't have to try
to control him in any way. In fact,</i>

193
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:22,090
<i>we enjoyed just letting him
hang out and see how it went.</i>

194
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,283
<i>(Herb) Stephanie being
the kind of mother she was,</i>

195
00:15:32,386 --> 00:15:34,455
<i>was not very concerned
about discipline.</i>

196
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,595
<i>It was sort of the hippie mentality,</i>

197
00:15:39,185 --> 00:15:42,270
<i>and I think what I would tell her
would go in one ear and out the other.</i>

198
00:15:47,188 --> 00:15:50,848
<i>(Stephanie) Herb would have wanted
a schedule and a structure</i>

199
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:54,895
<i>and charted progress
and notes and all of that.</i>

200
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:01,122
<i>I didn't supply that,
I couldn't create that,</i>

201
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:04,102
<i>and I don't think Nim
would have thrived in that.</i>

202
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:19,477
<i>(Laura) I was taking classes
at Columbia University</i>

203
00:16:19,793 --> 00:16:22,659
<i>and there was a small
sign that said,</i>

204
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:25,630
<i>"Research assistant needed,
course credit granted. "</i>

205
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:32,387
A man opened the door

206
00:16:33,154 --> 00:16:35,393
and he was completely breathless.

207
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:39,735
Also, he's one of those men
who was balding on the top.

208
00:16:39,677 --> 00:16:42,339
So he had his hair pasted down,

209
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:45,067
but he was so upset and dishevelled

210
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:47,658
that his hair was standing
straight up on one side.

211
00:16:50,757 --> 00:16:53,507
<i>He explained it was
a language project</i>

212
00:16:53,473 --> 00:16:58,351
<i>and I immediately understood
the scientific relevance.</i>

213
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:03,352
Nim was going to test
the nature-versus-nurture hypotheses

214
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:04,689
that were prevailing at the time.

215
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:09,229
<i>It really was at the
cusp of science.</i>

216
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,565
<i>(Herb) You know, some
things are just</i>

217
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,476
<i>immediately obvious about someone
from the beginning.</i>

218
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:18,471
<i>You know what kind
of person you have.</i>

219
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,144
I think she was 18, if I'm not mistaken.

220
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,699
<i>(Laura) At the time, Nim was
in Stephanie Lafarge's house,</i>

221
00:17:27,637 --> 00:17:31,181
<i>and my first job
was to basically baby-sit.</i>

222
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:35,532
To go to the house and ostensibly
teach him sign language.

223
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,639
She came out of nowhere as a

224
00:17:39,563 --> 00:17:41,307
cute little thing from Ramapo.

225
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,732
<i>(Laura) When I got there,
I was actually really surprised.</i>

226
00:17:46,446 --> 00:17:49,979
There was utter chaos.

227
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:53,824
There was nothing.
This was a scientific project.

228
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:58,780
<i>There were no journals.
There were no log books.</i>

229
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:01,638
<i>They didn't know who
was covering Nim,</i>

230
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:03,152
<i>when they were going
to be covering Nim,</i>

231
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:06,245
<i>who would be teaching Nim,
when they would be teaching Nim.</i>

232
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,122
<i>They didn't know what
they were going to teach Nim.</i>

233
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:11,841
<i>(Stephanie) She quickly
felt her power.</i>

234
00:18:12,168 --> 00:18:14,293
<i>It was completely visible.</i>

235
00:18:14,287 --> 00:18:17,740
<i>Everybody had to adapt to it.</i>

236
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:19,928
<i>She wanted that mother role.</i>

237
00:18:21,048 --> 00:18:23,505
This animal

238
00:18:23,532 --> 00:18:25,984
climbed the walls all day.

239
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:30,512
He ripped apart Stephanie's house
all day.

240
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:37,650
<i>The kinds of things she was
exposing Nim to were atypical.</i>

241
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:44,624
<i>(Stephanie) He loved driving fast
in cars. He loved motorcycles.</i>

242
00:18:44,576 --> 00:18:48,189
He loved, you know,
virtually anything thrilling.

243
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:55,010
<i>He liked alcohol. You'd give
him a sip and he'd want more.</i>

244
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:59,453
<i>We gave him puffs on a joint.</i>

245
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,914
<i>We didn't have to
treat him like a child.</i>

246
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:13,021
<i>We could expose him to
the sensations that we enjoyed.</i>

247
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:19,882
I had an instinctive sense
that something was very amiss here,

248
00:19:20,903 --> 00:19:25,565
that this is not the way
you teach a child language

249
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,999
or you interact with a child

250
00:19:27,978 --> 00:19:31,017
or you teach anything language.

251
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:36,669
<i>(Stephanie) When Nim began to</i>

252
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:40,207
discover my body, my nakedness,
he'd be curious.

253
00:19:40,142 --> 00:19:44,188
Like a child, he was uninterested
and then one day he was interested.

254
00:19:49,664 --> 00:19:53,665
<i>I never felt sexually
engaged with him.</i>

255
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:59,026
<i>There was a sensuality,
but Nim was, you know, a pre-teen.</i>

256
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:05,331
<i>(Laura) Stephanie was a graduate
student in psychoanalysis.</i>

257
00:20:05,225 --> 00:20:09,521
<i>Her questions had to do with
the oedipal complex.</i>

258
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:11,590
And she was interested
in Nim's masturbation

259
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:13,873
and how he masturbated.
I couldn't believe it.

260
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,667
I realised that I could not do
what I call good science

261
00:20:21,548 --> 00:20:24,422
in Stephanie's home.
It just wasn't conducive to that.

262
00:20:26,115 --> 00:20:29,694
<i>So I set up a classroom at Columbia.</i>

263
00:20:31,756 --> 00:20:33,993
<i>(Stephanie) He's gonna
take Nim to school</i>

264
00:20:33,995 --> 00:20:37,241
<i>and I realise I'm starting to
lose my role</i>

265
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:40,474
<i>as the person who knows the best
what he needs.</i>

266
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:44,043
<i>(Laura) We had to get him
in a context that was</i>

267
00:20:44,354 --> 00:20:47,643
<i>neutral, calming, soothing.</i>

268
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:54,709
<i>I just mapped out
a teaching plan for Nim</i>

269
00:20:54,913 --> 00:20:56,376
<i>and I did it.</i>

270
00:20:58,076 --> 00:21:00,236
<i>(Herb) She was so enthusiastic
about this</i>

271
00:21:00,315 --> 00:21:03,850
that I made her, in a sense,

272
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:06,924
the director of education,
the curriculum.

273
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,645
<i>(Laura) I was feeling
good about myself.</i>

274
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:12,514
<i>Also, I was succeeding with Nim.</i>

275
00:21:12,517 --> 00:21:14,140
<i>I could see I was
succeeding with Nim.</i>

276
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,317
<i>I can see it, I can see that no one
could hold a candle to me.</i>

277
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:24,252
The only thing that mattered to him...
It became more and more tense.

278
00:21:25,003 --> 00:21:28,703
Words, words, words, words, words,
word order, word order, word order.

279
00:21:28,923 --> 00:21:30,881
He couldn't see anything else.

280
00:21:31,203 --> 00:21:34,983
Herb started seeing the signs
grow on that little graph.

281
00:21:34,924 --> 00:21:38,874
Every day, every other day,
every three days.

282
00:21:38,886 --> 00:21:42,465
Laura taught him another sign.
Laura taught him another sign.

283
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:46,326
<i>And I just went hell for leather.</i>

284
00:21:49,407 --> 00:21:53,947
<i>(Herb) Nim's signing was just
almost exponentially increasing.</i>

285
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,501
<i>I was very happy.</i>

286
00:21:57,002 --> 00:22:00,291
Words are a fucking nightmare

287
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:03,734
when it comes to closeness, often.

288
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:09,837
And here I was, married to a poet,
working for a linguist...

289
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,616
You know, words became the enemy.

290
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:20,192
She started restricting the times
we can come in the house.

291
00:22:21,413 --> 00:22:23,572
She started throwing us out.

292
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,145
She, apparently, was

293
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,657
encouraged to believe
that she was now the mother.

294
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:35,254
<i>(Laura) Stephanie began to threaten
to take Nim away from Herb.</i>

295
00:22:39,132 --> 00:22:40,877
<i>And Herb started panicking.</i>

296
00:22:43,014 --> 00:22:47,555
I definitely initiated
the move out of Stephanie's house.

297
00:22:47,457 --> 00:22:49,829
I think she was initially
quite resistant to it,

298
00:22:50,213 --> 00:22:54,293
especially since she didn't know
exactly how Nim was going to end up.

299
00:22:54,978 --> 00:22:57,384
God had spoken.
That's what had happened.

300
00:22:57,381 --> 00:23:00,580
That's what was going on.
And we didn't have control.

301
00:23:07,702 --> 00:23:13,116
So... my separation from him
was just as abrupt, in a way,

302
00:23:12,981 --> 00:23:17,389
at that moment,
as his was from Carolyn's.

303
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:24,480
I was ostensibly conscious
but I was no less...

304
00:23:24,338 --> 00:23:26,628
I was as unaware

305
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:32,345
and, you know, un-in charge
and helpless as she was.

306
00:23:34,145 --> 00:23:35,554
It...

307
00:23:39,747 --> 00:23:41,572
It was heart-breaking,

308
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:48,723
saying goodbye.

309
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:56,674
<i>(Stephanie) Part of me did not
want him to learn language.</i>

310
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,067
<i>He was less with language</i>

311
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,549
<i>than he was as his unique self.</i>

312
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:27,398
<i>(Herb) At that time,
a very lucky thing happened.</i>

313
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:33,797
<i>I was aware that there was an estate
that Columbia owned in Riverdale,</i>

314
00:24:34,314 --> 00:24:39,351
<i>a very large estate, that used to
be the home of the President.</i>

315
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:41,868
<i>And I went to him with a proposition</i>

316
00:24:41,874 --> 00:24:46,289
<i>that if he allowed me to raise the chimp
there, I would pay for the heat.</i>

317
00:24:47,476 --> 00:24:48,886
<i>And he said "Sure."</i>

318
00:24:58,994 --> 00:25:03,656
<i>(Laura) This was amazing!
This was a fairly tale.</i>

319
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,220
<i>(Herb) It was a 28-acre estate</i>

320
00:25:09,161 --> 00:25:11,031
<i>surrounded by lovely gardens.</i>

321
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:16,144
<i>And that allowed me
to put up Nim's teachers</i>

322
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,232
<i>in magnificent surroundings
and not pay any rent.</i>

323
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,177
<i>Life was good.</i>

324
00:25:23,681 --> 00:25:25,590
<i>(Laura) Nim got out of the car,</i>

325
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:29,091
<i>ran up to the front door,</i>

326
00:25:29,322 --> 00:25:32,529
<i>rolled down the hill,
and he was gone.</i>

327
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:35,486
<i>He was free.</i>

328
00:25:43,563 --> 00:25:46,437
<i>So, there was no reaction
at having taken him</i>

329
00:25:46,442 --> 00:25:48,317
<i>out of Stephanie's house.</i>

330
00:25:49,725 --> 00:25:54,882
<i>He was fine. And it was like
he had been there his whole life.</i>

331
00:26:01,006 --> 00:26:04,292
<i>(Herb) He certainly was a different
chimpanzee in this mansion</i>

332
00:26:04,243 --> 00:26:05,908
<i>than he was with Stephanie.</i>

333
00:26:07,245 --> 00:26:10,250
<i>So, I sort of got into more,</i>

334
00:26:10,206 --> 00:26:12,833
<i>you know, interacting with him.</i>

335
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:18,230
<i>(Laura) Herb's power as a professor,</i>

336
00:26:19,293 --> 00:26:20,780
<i>his age,</i>

337
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:24,000
<i>completely impacted me.</i>

338
00:26:25,248 --> 00:26:26,990
<i>He was my model.</i>

339
00:26:27,894 --> 00:26:29,966
<i>(Herb) We really clicked together.</i>

340
00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:38,647
<i>(Laura) I wanted so much
to be a part of his world.</i>

341
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,819
<i>I wanted to be
in that world of academia.</i>

342
00:26:44,254 --> 00:26:47,209
<i>(Herb) I had strong personal
feelings about Laura,</i>

343
00:26:49,572 --> 00:26:54,370
but I don't think that in any way
got in the way of our science.

344
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:08,451
<i>(Laura) Some of the daily bodily
requirements that Nim had</i>

345
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:11,192
<i>had to be addressed,
and very quickly.</i>

346
00:27:14,137 --> 00:27:17,758
<i>I eventually couldn't handle
the diapers any more.</i>

347
00:27:17,697 --> 00:27:21,032
<i>He was getting bigger
and he was eating more of our food,</i>

348
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,311
<i>so pragmatically I had to
get him off those diapers.</i>

349
00:27:26,585 --> 00:27:30,365
I watched his facial expressions
when he needed the potty

350
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:34,428
and I began to see it and grab him
and bring him to the potty.

351
00:27:36,306 --> 00:27:38,625
<i>(Herb) He did actually use
the toilet correctly,</i>

352
00:27:38,663 --> 00:27:44,041
<i>but it was certainly not as reliable
as what you'd see in a child.</i>

353
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:52,331
<i>(Laura) The idea was
that I would live with Nim</i>

354
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:56,801
<i>and I would train him for a
certain period of time in the house,</i>

355
00:27:56,748 --> 00:28:01,204
<i>but then I would bring him in
every day to Columbia University.</i>

356
00:28:04,431 --> 00:28:07,597
<i>(Bill) This was an experiment
to teach or see</i>

357
00:28:07,548 --> 00:28:09,837
<i>if a chimpanzee can
learn sign language.</i>

358
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,381
<i>I just thought it was really
intellectually interesting.</i>

359
00:28:15,266 --> 00:28:18,687
<i>Interesting to understand
how much chimpanzees are like us</i>

360
00:28:18,674 --> 00:28:20,629
<i>and how much they're not.</i>

361
00:28:23,394 --> 00:28:24,969
<i>At that time he was terribly cute</i>

362
00:28:24,988 --> 00:28:27,782
<i>and getting little photos
in New York magazine.</i>

363
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:31,070
<i>There was a daily lesson plan,
if you will.</i>

364
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:34,572
<i>We were supposed to teach
these particular signs to Nim</i>

365
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:39,449
<i>and they were supposed to
also teach him everyday activities.</i>

366
00:28:40,192 --> 00:28:43,980
<i>Dress yourself, undress yourself,
this sort of thing.</i>

367
00:28:44,795 --> 00:28:47,366
<i>(Herb) Like children
after they learn a few words,</i>

368
00:28:47,472 --> 00:28:50,391
<i>Nim has spontaneously
put signs together.</i>

369
00:28:50,758 --> 00:28:53,241
In many instances we allow Nim

370
00:28:53,235 --> 00:28:56,570
to use his own signs,
that he almost invents,

371
00:28:56,514 --> 00:28:57,931
so long as they're consistent.

372
00:28:57,956 --> 00:29:02,418
For example, this is the sign for "play"
that he invented.

373
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:05,927
He's learning signs rapidly.
They're going up, up, up, up, up.

374
00:29:06,796 --> 00:29:08,841
<i>(Herb) The project was
literally humming.</i>

375
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,777
<i>You know, everything was
going very smoothly.</i>

376
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,660
<i>I have a chimpanzee
who was making history.</i>

377
00:29:16,402 --> 00:29:18,774
<i>We did get a grant
somewhere in that time.</i>

378
00:29:19,197 --> 00:29:22,068
<i>(Laura) The project had
begun to enter the media,</i>

379
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,896
<i>so there was all this excitement
and hype about the project.</i>

380
00:29:25,966 --> 00:29:27,541
<i>We were thrilled.</i>

381
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:34,162
We've probably all seen
performing chimpanzees

382
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,487
on television or in circuses,

383
00:29:36,486 --> 00:29:38,441
but Nim is no ordinary chimp.

384
00:29:39,086 --> 00:29:42,622
Since he was a few weeks old,
Nim has lived in a close association

385
00:29:42,564 --> 00:29:45,269
with a group of scientists
under the direction of

386
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,735
Dr Herbert Terrace
of Columbia University.

387
00:29:48,243 --> 00:29:50,240
They're performing a unique experiment

388
00:29:50,244 --> 00:29:54,373
to try to determine whether apes can be
taught to communicate with humans

389
00:29:54,441 --> 00:29:55,858
using language.

390
00:29:56,606 --> 00:29:58,564
How big will he be when he's full-grown?

391
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:00,062
Oh, he's going to be big.

392
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:03,918
He's going to be about 5 feet tall,
perhaps 150 pounds,

393
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:07,596
and supposedly five to six times
the strength of a man.

394
00:30:07,526 --> 00:30:09,571
How are you going to be able
to handle him then?

395
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:12,782
<i>(Bill) He had grown.</i>

396
00:30:12,805 --> 00:30:15,186
I guess he was probably
something like that.

397
00:30:17,486 --> 00:30:20,942
If you had to hold him,
you really had to hold him.

398
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:24,622
<i>And he'd gone from being
this meek little huggable toy</i>

399
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:28,817
<i>to quite a robust young chimpanzee.</i>

400
00:30:33,096 --> 00:30:35,218
His eye teeth were never taken out,

401
00:30:35,212 --> 00:30:38,714
which means that he's got fangs,
essentially, sitting here.

402
00:30:38,652 --> 00:30:40,360
Extremely strong jaw.

403
00:30:40,376 --> 00:30:44,125
<i>If you didn't assert dominance
in some fashion,</i>

404
00:30:44,054 --> 00:30:46,343
<i>you were going to be
in trouble eventually.</i>

405
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:50,689
<i>(Herb) He could size somebody up
in two seconds.</i>

406
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:55,842
Whether they were confident
or secretly unconfident.

407
00:30:56,775 --> 00:30:58,687
<i>(Laura) If I stood up too quickly,</i>

408
00:30:58,695 --> 00:31:03,277
if I accidentally showed him
my back too quickly,

409
00:31:03,298 --> 00:31:07,169
if I had food and I didn't think
to share it with him,

410
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:09,624
he'd cross that threshold
and go into attack.

411
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:14,950
<i>(Bill) You could tell
that he was getting an attitude.</i>

412
00:31:14,978 --> 00:31:17,472
The hair would go up on his arms

413
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:20,295
and he'd sort of get this look
in his face.

414
00:31:20,941 --> 00:31:22,316
(hooting angrily)

415
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:24,003
When he would bark,

416
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,888
I'd feel it inside,

417
00:31:26,504 --> 00:31:28,126
the danger.

418
00:31:29,944 --> 00:31:31,651
<i>He had to lunge.</i>

419
00:31:32,145 --> 00:31:35,971
<i>The contact, the rip,
the tear and the release.</i>

420
00:31:36,065 --> 00:31:37,722
<i>And he had to draw blood.</i>

421
00:31:40,664 --> 00:31:45,045
<i>(Herb) She did not tell me that
in an alarming manner.</i>

422
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,443
<i>She was just reporting it.</i>

423
00:31:47,261 --> 00:31:49,139
Maybe I was just too

424
00:31:49,986 --> 00:31:52,480
looking ahead with blinkers
and not wanting to hear that.

425
00:31:52,505 --> 00:31:54,414
This is 37 stitches.

426
00:31:54,905 --> 00:31:57,030
I had four here,

427
00:31:57,346 --> 00:31:59,882
nine here. This one

428
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:01,526
sent me into the hospital.

429
00:32:01,551 --> 00:32:04,582
This one actually was the most dangerous
one because he hit a tendon.

430
00:32:17,788 --> 00:32:19,579
<i>(Joyce) It's a lot of work</i>

431
00:32:19,593 --> 00:32:22,342
<i>to take care of an animal
that's not your species</i>

432
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,140
<i>who has that kind of energy level.</i>

433
00:32:24,188 --> 00:32:27,227
I probably didn't know the difference
between chimpanzees and monkeys.

434
00:32:27,188 --> 00:32:31,025
So, I was as blind and as ignorant

435
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,658
and as naive as probably they came.

436
00:32:32,674 --> 00:32:34,084
I was on a quick learning curve.

437
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:40,697
I have high energy
and enthusiasm for a goal.

438
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:42,043
And he was my goal, apparently.

439
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:45,271
<i>(Laura) Joyce was a great teacher.</i>

440
00:32:45,314 --> 00:32:50,109
<i>She signed, she was completely
dedicated and motivated.</i>

441
00:32:49,994 --> 00:32:53,743
<i>She wanted to do this.
This was fantastic!</i>

442
00:32:56,234 --> 00:33:00,561
<i>(Joyce) He bit me really hard, and I
bit him on the ear right then and there,</i>

443
00:33:00,477 --> 00:33:04,059
<i>and I said, "That's over. You will
never bite me again. "And he never did.</i>

444
00:33:07,514 --> 00:33:10,601
<i>He did like a lot of
human body contact.</i>

445
00:33:12,317 --> 00:33:14,028
<i>Typically, when we would
leave the property,</i>

446
00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:16,664
<i>he would be really attached to you.</i>

447
00:33:18,556 --> 00:33:21,476
<i>The world would scare him,
so he would always come close.</i>

448
00:33:28,202 --> 00:33:31,034
<i>Bill and I hung tight with Nim.</i>

449
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,965
<i>(Bill) We sort of hit it off
on a lot of our different thinking.</i>

450
00:33:36,283 --> 00:33:39,816
<i>She and I got together as a couple.
(laughs)</i>

451
00:33:40,564 --> 00:33:42,769
<i>(Joyce) It helped
that we liked each other.</i>

452
00:33:42,768 --> 00:33:44,885
<i>And I think that that
helped Nim's life</i>

453
00:33:45,407 --> 00:33:48,273
<i>because we enjoyed
each other's company,</i>

454
00:33:48,247 --> 00:33:49,992
<i>so we would do things together</i>

455
00:33:50,005 --> 00:33:52,630
<i>and we would hang out
as kind of a unit.</i>

456
00:33:58,207 --> 00:33:59,704
Oh, he loved the cats.

457
00:34:01,485 --> 00:34:04,604
<i>(Bill) He was really, really tender
with the cat, and he'd hold it,</i>

458
00:34:04,569 --> 00:34:07,569
<i>and he sort of liked the feel,
the touch. Something about it.</i>

459
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:12,005
He would hold her and be like...

460
00:34:12,013 --> 00:34:13,420
And you could see him, like, shaking

461
00:34:13,447 --> 00:34:15,572
because he'd be so excited
that he had her.

462
00:34:16,571 --> 00:34:19,188
<i>(laughs) He actually kind of
pushed her down on the ground</i>

463
00:34:19,171 --> 00:34:21,163
<i>and then curled around her,</i>

464
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:23,919
<i>and just laid there, like,
"I'm in heaven."</i>

465
00:34:40,176 --> 00:34:42,378
<i>(Bill) I would say
that it was fairly clear</i>

466
00:34:42,377 --> 00:34:44,616
<i>that there was something more
going on than the project,</i>

467
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:46,869
<i>at least from his side.</i>

468
00:34:48,732 --> 00:34:51,694
<i>And I think we all felt it
and we kind of had...</i>

469
00:34:51,817 --> 00:34:54,186
<i>I don't want to say resentment,
but it was like,</i>

470
00:34:54,171 --> 00:34:57,213
<i>"Oh, jeez, would he stop
this Laura thing?"</i>

471
00:34:58,215 --> 00:35:00,888
If someone showed me some attention,

472
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:04,289
I thought it meant
that they cared for me.

473
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:07,837
<i>He had power.</i>

474
00:35:11,262 --> 00:35:15,422
I'm sure that, you know,
unconsciously I took advantage of that.

475
00:35:15,336 --> 00:35:18,757
Somebody admires you,

476
00:35:18,944 --> 00:35:20,521
um, why not...

477
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,660
So, yeah, we very briefly got involved

478
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:30,161
and he very, very briefly and abruptly
got out of it.

479
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:36,959
<i>The entanglement completely
affected my decision to leave.</i>

480
00:35:37,743 --> 00:35:41,077
<i>It's the humans I wanted to leave,
not the chimp.</i>

481
00:35:43,345 --> 00:35:44,968
Herb didn't want it to happen.

482
00:35:44,988 --> 00:35:48,901
He went into a very enthusiastic mode

483
00:35:48,824 --> 00:35:50,736
of trying to convince me not to go.

484
00:35:51,104 --> 00:35:52,769
I wasn't panicked.

485
00:35:52,947 --> 00:35:55,149
I wasn't panicked
that the project was just going to

486
00:35:55,147 --> 00:35:56,938
grind to a halt because Laura left.

487
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:02,175
<i>As I recall, Joyce and Bill
pretty much took care of that.</i>

488
00:36:02,231 --> 00:36:06,638
<i>So... I didn't lose any crucial
aspect of the project.</i>

489
00:36:13,112 --> 00:36:17,519
I started to go
to get the boxes to leave,

490
00:36:17,946 --> 00:36:21,570
and Nim pulled loose
from the person's hand,

491
00:36:21,754 --> 00:36:24,785
he climbs to the second floor
of the house.

492
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:29,022
<i>Then he must have lunged 25 feet.</i>

493
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:32,733
<i>He landed on me.</i>

494
00:36:35,597 --> 00:36:40,832
<i>He took my head and he started
pounding it into the pavement.</i>

495
00:36:43,317 --> 00:36:46,480
<i>It took four males
to get him off me.</i>

496
00:36:56,353 --> 00:36:57,930
<i>He wasn't my child.</i>

497
00:36:57,957 --> 00:36:59,668
<i>He wasn't my baby.</i>

498
00:37:00,438 --> 00:37:05,594
<i>You can't give human nurturing
to an animal that could kill you.</i>

499
00:37:17,481 --> 00:37:20,185
<i>(Herb) One of the easy
parts of the project</i>

500
00:37:20,603 --> 00:37:23,142
<i>was to advertise for teachers.</i>

501
00:37:23,681 --> 00:37:26,519
It was like, "Uh, this is nice."

502
00:37:27,441 --> 00:37:31,020
I didn't set out to have women
on the project predominantly,

503
00:37:30,962 --> 00:37:33,201
but it certainly turned out that way.

504
00:37:34,601 --> 00:37:36,723
And if that's the way it turned out,
that's the way it turned out.

505
00:37:36,878 --> 00:37:39,258
<i>(Renee) I was a trained
interpreter for the deaf.</i>

506
00:37:39,766 --> 00:37:41,253
<i>When I set my mind to something,</i>

507
00:37:41,283 --> 00:37:42,826
<i>I get what I want.</i>

508
00:37:44,246 --> 00:37:45,702
I kept saying, "I want to live here."

509
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:47,762
"When I am moving in?
When do I get to move in?"

510
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:49,973
<i>And I would annoy Herb.</i>

511
00:37:49,963 --> 00:37:52,122
<i>And finally he let me move in.</i>

512
00:37:53,561 --> 00:37:55,641
<i>(Bill) Probably, as time went on,</i>

513
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:58,927
<i>it may have become more difficult
for women to work with him.</i>

514
00:38:01,328 --> 00:38:02,738
<i>He was going to take
advantage of them</i>

515
00:38:02,772 --> 00:38:05,555
<i>and he was big enough
and strong enough that he could.</i>

516
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,089
<i>(Renee) I mean, it hurt!
His bites hurt.</i>

517
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:11,917
When he bit your hand, he got the nerve.

518
00:38:12,171 --> 00:38:14,075
And you'd get a running shock
up your arm.

519
00:38:17,689 --> 00:38:20,441
<i>We had epic battles, but we made up.</i>

520
00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:24,314
He'd make that face and sign "sorry".

521
00:38:25,655 --> 00:38:28,226
<i>So, "Well, if I sign this,
she'll forgive me. "</i>

522
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:31,832
I had a relationship with a chimpanzee,

523
00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:33,890
and I had conversations
with another species.

524
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:40,366
<i>(Joyce) It's not just him signing
that was important to me.</i>

525
00:38:40,334 --> 00:38:42,740
<i>It was what he was thinking
and experiencing,</i>

526
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:46,023
<i>because we would talk
when we would hang out.</i>

527
00:38:46,135 --> 00:38:47,591
<i>We would talk about
the things we would see,</i>

528
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,024
<i>the things we would hear.</i>

529
00:38:50,732 --> 00:38:52,195
<i>As far as I'm concerned,</i>

530
00:38:52,213 --> 00:38:54,339
<i>our classroom was the
house and the yard</i>

531
00:38:54,338 --> 00:38:56,824
<i>and the field trips
that we would take.</i>

532
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:08,822
<i>(Herb) Science is
a very objective enterprise.</i>

533
00:39:08,742 --> 00:39:12,434
You can't have personal anecdotes
of how I worked with Nim

534
00:39:12,379 --> 00:39:14,671
up at Delafield
as opposed to the classroom.

535
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,338
<i>That's just
of no interest to a scientist.</i>

536
00:39:18,902 --> 00:39:22,560
<i>Joyce did not see anything
special about the classroom.</i>

537
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:26,354
Hated it. Hated it, hated it.
He hated it. We hated it.

538
00:39:26,385 --> 00:39:30,423
That's not surprising, because she
didn't get the results in the classroom

539
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,698
that I was hoping for.

540
00:39:33,545 --> 00:39:35,835
<i>- Do you know what time it is?
- (man) Yeah.</i>

541
00:39:35,823 --> 00:39:38,530
<i>(Bill) Going into a dungeon
of a classroom, which it really was.</i>

542
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:40,244
<i>I mean, the thing was
15 feet square,</i>

543
00:39:40,265 --> 00:39:43,017
<i>including the observation booth
and everything else.</i>

544
00:39:43,705 --> 00:39:46,656
<i>No windows, no place
really to have any activity.</i>

545
00:39:46,627 --> 00:39:48,205
<i>Trying to get Nim's attention</i>

546
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,600
<i>was a bit of a struggle,</i>

547
00:39:49,629 --> 00:39:52,706
<i>and he would rather have been
been doing something else.</i>

548
00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:57,683
Pay attention to me.

549
00:40:00,672 --> 00:40:02,045
Shh!

550
00:40:04,431 --> 00:40:06,256
So, this is the sign for "dirty",

551
00:40:06,266 --> 00:40:09,853
so we used it for "toilet" for him
because it's a contact sign.

552
00:40:13,186 --> 00:40:16,026
<i>He would jump through the signs
that I asked him to jump through</i>

553
00:40:15,988 --> 00:40:17,452
<i>and then he would have had enough.</i>

554
00:40:17,508 --> 00:40:19,999
And he would say,
"I need to go to the bathroom."

555
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:28,092
And that's when I knew,

556
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:30,652
you little bugger.

557
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,918
You used that sign

558
00:40:32,954 --> 00:40:34,824
because you knew
it would make us leave there

559
00:40:34,874 --> 00:40:36,829
and get us out of there.

560
00:40:41,955 --> 00:40:44,282
<i>(Bill) He was growing
smarter and smarter.</i>

561
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:48,561
<i>And smarter in the sense
of recognising situations</i>

562
00:40:48,516 --> 00:40:52,387
<i>that he could take advantage of,
of when he could get what he wanted.</i>

563
00:41:02,515 --> 00:41:05,139
<i>(Renee) He was starting
to discover himself.</i>

564
00:41:05,721 --> 00:41:09,302
<i>There was a big rock in the front yard
and he used to like to hump it.</i>

565
00:41:10,555 --> 00:41:13,396
And we'd say, "You're gonna
hurt yourself. That's a rock."

566
00:41:13,442 --> 00:41:14,852
Like, look at himself and go,
"What's that?"

567
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:19,707
As this whole thing with the physicality
became an issue,

568
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:21,011
we were much more cautious, I think,

569
00:41:21,037 --> 00:41:23,664
about letting the cats around him,

570
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,135
and letting him play with the cats.

571
00:41:28,881 --> 00:41:30,379
<i>(Joyce) He would even try to,</i>

572
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:33,687
not engage directly in sexual
relationships with the animals,

573
00:41:33,646 --> 00:41:38,220
but definitely to bring them to him
and to his penis area.

574
00:41:43,122 --> 00:41:46,657
<i>And I just said, "No,
that's not what they're there for. "</i>

575
00:41:53,568 --> 00:41:56,273
<i>(Herb) We realised, I think
all of us, that it was becoming</i>

576
00:41:56,245 --> 00:42:00,192
<i>increasingly difficult
to pursue the experiment.</i>

577
00:42:00,964 --> 00:42:04,052
<i>(Renee) Nim was scratching hard,
he was biting harder,</i>

578
00:42:04,012 --> 00:42:06,708
<i>biting more often,
biting more people.</i>

579
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:11,534
<i>(Bill) We had mentioned
the growing concern that we had</i>

580
00:42:11,485 --> 00:42:13,485
<i>about how to deal with Nim.</i>

581
00:42:13,488 --> 00:42:15,032
(Nim screeching)

582
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,815
<i>Dr Terrace was pretty much
an absentee landlord.</i>

583
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:20,265
<i>(Joyce) Herb was never
alone with Nim,</i>

584
00:42:20,695 --> 00:42:23,357
<i>and Herb never had to spend
any kind of time with him.</i>

585
00:42:24,892 --> 00:42:26,770
<i>Once in a while, you
know, photo shoots.</i>

586
00:42:26,773 --> 00:42:30,519
<i>For him to either take photos or
for him to have photos taken of him.</i>

587
00:42:33,608 --> 00:42:35,855
<i>(Herb) Yes, there were
occasional bites.</i>

588
00:42:36,694 --> 00:42:40,360
<i>I imagine they increased in frequency
just because Nim was getting older.</i>

589
00:42:41,736 --> 00:42:44,188
<i>In that sense,
he was becoming more chimp-like.</i>

590
00:42:45,894 --> 00:42:48,982
But it didn't seem to be
a cause for alarm at that point.

591
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:54,457
<i>(Renee) It was the end of July,
it was July 28th,</i>

592
00:42:55,058 --> 00:42:59,465
<i>and Bill had him, and we
did the body-to-body transfer.</i>

593
00:43:02,016 --> 00:43:04,221
I mean, you're holding Nim

594
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,965
and the other person comes up

595
00:43:05,978 --> 00:43:09,184
and you just kind of hand
the chimp to the other person.

596
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,466
And I said, "Come on."
And I got the tether.

597
00:43:13,297 --> 00:43:15,589
You know, you've got the loop first

598
00:43:15,577 --> 00:43:17,657
and I then tied it to my belt.

599
00:43:18,141 --> 00:43:22,221
"Come here." And he came over
and he put his arms around me.

600
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,482
He just crunched my face.

601
00:43:27,019 --> 00:43:28,764
It just happened.

602
00:43:31,184 --> 00:43:34,104
And I grabbed Nim
and just dragged him into the house.

603
00:43:34,064 --> 00:43:36,353
And he was like,
(exclaims) "Sorry, sorry, sorry!"

604
00:43:36,341 --> 00:43:38,801
"No, no, no." And I passed
that armoire with that mirror

605
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:42,641
and saw all this blood.
He had bit through my cheek

606
00:43:42,903 --> 00:43:44,861
almost to the inside of my mouth.

607
00:43:45,145 --> 00:43:48,016
It was folded over,
so you could see inside my face.

608
00:43:52,825 --> 00:43:55,866
I don't recall if she went
to the emergency room,

609
00:43:55,826 --> 00:43:57,738
but I think something
like that happened.

610
00:44:00,584 --> 00:44:03,924
It was just bad.

611
00:44:05,149 --> 00:44:07,308
I was probably worried
that she would sue me,

612
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,622
or this would become public,

613
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,735
this would become public
knowledge about how

614
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,340
life-threatening the project might be.

615
00:44:18,633 --> 00:44:20,088
They couldn't sew it

616
00:44:20,114 --> 00:44:22,598
because of the infection
and the risk of infection,

617
00:44:22,592 --> 00:44:26,752
so I had an open gaping wound
on my face for three months.

618
00:44:36,237 --> 00:44:38,104
<i>And when I got out the
hospital, I said,</i>

619
00:44:38,115 --> 00:44:40,274
<i>"You know what? I want to see Nim."</i>

620
00:44:40,472 --> 00:44:41,936
He went... (grunts)

621
00:44:41,954 --> 00:44:44,411
And he went to reach for my face again.
I went, "Whoa!"

622
00:44:44,392 --> 00:44:47,400
"That's it. I don't need closure now.
I'm out of here."

623
00:44:47,917 --> 00:44:49,792
<i>I was scared.</i>

624
00:44:51,676 --> 00:44:53,915
<i>I'm tenacious
and I didn't want to let go.</i>

625
00:44:54,714 --> 00:44:56,839
<i>Sort of like breaking up
with a bad boyfriend.</i>

626
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,513
<i>(Herb) I was sorry
that it came to that,</i>

627
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,095
<i>but you just don't know how
Nim is going to change</i>

628
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:11,578
<i>and you just can't count on</i>

629
00:45:11,558 --> 00:45:14,265
<i>having outstanding teachers
all the time.</i>

630
00:45:23,037 --> 00:45:26,414
<i>I felt I was spreading
myself too thinly</i>

631
00:45:26,362 --> 00:45:28,518
<i>and experiencing too much stress</i>

632
00:45:28,762 --> 00:45:32,097
<i>and not enough, you
know, good results.</i>

633
00:45:36,045 --> 00:45:38,831
Nobody keeps a chimp
for more than five years,

634
00:45:38,924 --> 00:45:42,792
because at five years,
they don't know their own strength

635
00:45:42,722 --> 00:45:44,433
and they can do
a lot of damage to people.

636
00:45:50,763 --> 00:45:54,184
He called us together and dropped
the bomb and said, "It's over."

637
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,719
<i>I was one very angry young woman.</i>

638
00:46:06,527 --> 00:46:09,646
<i>You don't say,
"We're not doing this any more."</i>

639
00:46:09,649 --> 00:46:13,018
<i>And because Herb had
that card to play,</i>

640
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:15,176
<i>he played it,
'cause he was in the power seat.</i>

641
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,607
<i>(Herb) I think I said,</i>

642
00:46:22,088 --> 00:46:25,340
<i>"There's no point of
this going on scientifically. "</i>

643
00:46:28,136 --> 00:46:30,125
<i>I felt that Nim had
progressed a lot,</i>

644
00:46:30,129 --> 00:46:33,048
<i>and we hadn't had the chance
to really analyse our data.</i>

645
00:46:33,454 --> 00:46:36,070
<i>I just knew that we
had reams of data.</i>

646
00:46:39,854 --> 00:46:43,140
<i>(Bill) This whole mass of data
that needed to be organised,</i>

647
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:46,925
<i>and that was going to be
a long and tedious process.</i>

648
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,716
<i>(Herb) The fundamental question was,</i>

649
00:46:49,775 --> 00:46:51,767
<i>"Can a chimpanzee
create a sentence?"</i>

650
00:46:53,496 --> 00:46:56,663
<i>I don't think I had
any definitive conclusions to that.</i>

651
00:46:56,936 --> 00:46:58,678
<i>We had to wait and see.</i>

652
00:47:01,816 --> 00:47:04,440
<i>(Bill) It's kind of like
you're almost there</i>

653
00:47:04,416 --> 00:47:07,336
and you feel like
there's going to be a conclusion,

654
00:47:07,303 --> 00:47:09,965
and it's like, "Okay,"

655
00:47:10,616 --> 00:47:11,992
"it's over."

656
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:20,001
<i>(Herb) I thought that the
surroundings in which he was born</i>

657
00:47:20,065 --> 00:47:24,393
<i>would provide the most
psychological support for Nim.</i>

658
00:47:25,904 --> 00:47:29,483
<i>I felt the basic needs would be
taken care of.</i>

659
00:47:30,263 --> 00:47:32,085
(phone ringing)

660
00:47:32,701 --> 00:47:37,165
<i>So, once I got Bill Lemmon to agree
to take him back,</i>

661
00:47:37,306 --> 00:47:39,131
<i>that was it.</i>

662
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:52,454
<i>(Joyce) I hope he'll be okay.</i>

663
00:47:53,023 --> 00:47:54,819
<i>That's why I want to go with him.</i>

664
00:47:54,825 --> 00:47:58,874
I hope that I'll be able to
introduce him to his new life

665
00:47:59,024 --> 00:48:02,029
but still have an old part of his life
with him, namely me.

666
00:48:02,384 --> 00:48:05,636
And he can get used to it
and I can fade out and he'll be fine.

667
00:48:06,504 --> 00:48:10,641
It won't just be an abrupt break
between old and new.

668
00:48:30,831 --> 00:48:32,956
<i>(Bill) And we get Nim up early
one morning,</i>

669
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,034
he gets a shot and he's out.

670
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:48,067
<i>(Herb) I chartered a plane
and hired a pilot.</i>

671
00:48:58,357 --> 00:49:00,596
<i>Nim was given tranquillisers</i>

672
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:03,269
<i>to reduce the possibility of
his getting out of hand.</i>

673
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:11,340
<i>If he was tranquillised,
he'd be easier to control</i>

674
00:49:11,242 --> 00:49:14,774
<i>and not do any damage to the plane,
which could be quite dangerous.</i>

675
00:49:16,482 --> 00:49:18,639
<i>(Joyce) So that's how we get him
to Oklahoma.</i>

676
00:49:19,881 --> 00:49:23,170
It was just a nasty thing to do.

677
00:49:24,081 --> 00:49:25,990
Very deceitful, I think.

678
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,313
<i>(Herb) The question is, what
was going to happen in Oklahoma?</i>

679
00:49:33,964 --> 00:49:38,425
<i>And I didn't have any sense of that,
so, that was my concern.</i>

680
00:50:07,529 --> 00:50:11,027
<i>(Joyce laughing) "Holy shit"
was my first thought.</i>

681
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:17,744
And I think his reaction was
"holy shit" too.

682
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:20,799
Like he knew we were...
He knew it was bad.

683
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,963
<i>He'd never seen a chimp before,</i>

684
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:28,322
<i>and he was holding on tight.</i>

685
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:33,655
(screeching)

686
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:35,280
You look around, you see cages

687
00:50:35,378 --> 00:50:38,127
and you hear the sounds
of a lot of chimpanzees.

688
00:50:39,213 --> 00:50:42,254
Would I have envisioned this,
when I started on this project,

689
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:44,750
that he ever would end up there? No.

690
00:50:49,457 --> 00:50:50,947
It turned out to be

691
00:50:51,376 --> 00:50:54,628
a surprisingly more primitive facility
than I remembered.

692
00:50:57,339 --> 00:50:59,376
<i>(Bob) Because our cages were cages.</i>

693
00:50:59,381 --> 00:51:00,868
<i>They weren't just a room
with a locked door,</i>

694
00:51:00,899 --> 00:51:02,443
<i>they were cages.</i>

695
00:51:02,496 --> 00:51:04,161
I mean, it looked like a prison.

696
00:51:04,262 --> 00:51:09,598
A really stark, ugly, dark, dank prison.

697
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:14,818
<i>(Alyce) They had a chain
around their neck with a lock.</i>

698
00:51:17,382 --> 00:51:20,001
Should you get into a bad fight,

699
00:51:20,061 --> 00:51:22,465
you could grab the chain
and keep them off of you.

700
00:51:22,661 --> 00:51:24,205
<i>It was like prison behaviour.</i>

701
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:27,094
<i>We had to put up an electric fence
around the island</i>

702
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,349
<i>because we had had several murders</i>

703
00:51:29,338 --> 00:51:31,137
<i>and two suicides.</i>

704
00:51:31,941 --> 00:51:34,018
They'd just push them out
into the water,

705
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:35,483
and chimps can't swim.

706
00:51:35,662 --> 00:51:38,034
<i>(Joyce) Dr Lemmon ran the place.</i>

707
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:41,050
<i>I had an immediate
horrible reaction.</i>

708
00:51:41,548 --> 00:51:43,620
<i>He walked around with a cattle prod.</i>

709
00:51:46,704 --> 00:51:49,623
I remember trying to push Nim away,

710
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:51,793
because I knew what he was gonna do.

711
00:51:51,783 --> 00:51:55,733
And Nim is screaming
and holding on to me very tightly,

712
00:51:56,748 --> 00:51:58,953
and the only reason he let go

713
00:51:59,504 --> 00:52:02,456
was because he got zapped
with the electric prod.

714
00:52:08,351 --> 00:52:10,837
Come here a minute. Mac, come here.
Mac, come here.

715
00:52:11,146 --> 00:52:12,351
Come here, come here.

716
00:52:12,871 --> 00:52:16,734
<i>(Bill) The reasoning behind
the whole Mac-Nim interaction</i>

717
00:52:16,671 --> 00:52:19,542
<i>was that Mac was not dangerous.</i>

718
00:52:21,873 --> 00:52:25,284
<i>(Alyce) He was small, so he was</i>

719
00:52:25,233 --> 00:52:27,986
<i>not an aggressive, dominant chimp,</i>

720
00:52:27,952 --> 00:52:31,036
<i>so he was the perfect one
for Nim to start with.</i>

721
00:53:10,555 --> 00:53:12,936
<i>(Bill) Hey, Mac, uh-uh! Buh!</i>

722
00:53:22,404 --> 00:53:24,441
<i>(interviewer) How did you expect
Nim to react</i>

723
00:53:24,439 --> 00:53:26,649
<i>to his first meeting
with another chimp?</i>

724
00:53:27,284 --> 00:53:30,945
<i>(Herb) I think what happened was that
Nim was very apprehensive about Mac</i>

725
00:53:30,885 --> 00:53:32,794
<i>and he took his time</i>

726
00:53:32,801 --> 00:53:36,056
<i>and then when he was ready,
he and Mac got it off.</i>

727
00:53:38,365 --> 00:53:39,909
I feel very good about this,

728
00:53:39,923 --> 00:53:43,456
because I can leave now
knowing that Nim has a friend

729
00:53:43,406 --> 00:53:47,235
and he's going to worry less about
his human companions

730
00:53:47,168 --> 00:53:50,084
and have at least one other chimp
to turn to.

731
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,679
<i>(Bill) It was time to leave,</i>

732
00:54:00,688 --> 00:54:03,722
and that's when I took Nim
and put him in the cage.

733
00:54:07,725 --> 00:54:10,264
Sure, I didn't want Joyce doing it,

734
00:54:10,251 --> 00:54:11,704
so I just said,
"Well, I better go do it."

735
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:13,521
I didn't want Terrace doing it.

736
00:54:14,371 --> 00:54:17,535
So, I just decided I was gonna do it.

737
00:54:18,814 --> 00:54:20,350
(chimpanzee grunting)

738
00:54:20,373 --> 00:54:21,995
(cage rattling)

739
00:54:26,251 --> 00:54:28,787
You know, we coaxed him
down there and then,

740
00:54:29,088 --> 00:54:30,921
because he trusted us...

741
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:33,761
I just led him in there
and took the lead

742
00:54:33,815 --> 00:54:36,434
and tied it around
the far end of the cage

743
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:39,696
and said goodbye and walked out
and shut the door.

744
00:54:43,294 --> 00:54:45,371
(chimpanzees hooting)

745
00:54:48,574 --> 00:54:50,985
(cages rattling)

746
00:54:52,617 --> 00:54:55,369
He was sort of hooting
and trying to come after me,

747
00:54:56,253 --> 00:54:58,625
'cause he didn't really know
where he was.

748
00:54:58,618 --> 00:55:01,237
But I just walked away.

749
00:55:03,214 --> 00:55:05,507
And then when he wasn't looking,
he ran out,

750
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:06,877
out the door.

751
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,688
I did feel badly.

752
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:31,204
I felt in a certain basic sense
that was not the right thing to do

753
00:55:31,546 --> 00:55:35,161
to somebody, you know, who had
been part of my life for so many years,

754
00:55:35,382 --> 00:55:37,621
and that I was definitely doing

755
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:41,534
something that he somehow
would feel was unjust or wrong.

756
00:55:48,182 --> 00:55:51,806
<i>He had a little doll or something
that I think I left.</i>

757
00:55:58,549 --> 00:56:02,131
<i>(Joyce) I strongly believe that
we made a commitment to him</i>

758
00:56:02,066 --> 00:56:03,607
<i>and we failed.</i>

759
00:56:05,387 --> 00:56:08,968
<i>We did a huge disservice
to that soul,</i>

760
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:12,182
<i>and shame on us.</i>

761
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:17,228
(chimpanzees hooting)

762
00:56:21,793 --> 00:56:23,865
<i>(Bob) Assumed, I guess wrongly,</i>

763
00:56:23,912 --> 00:56:26,909
<i>that Nim was going to come back
and he was going to be celebrated</i>

764
00:56:26,873 --> 00:56:29,359
<i>in the sense that he was going to be
the great signing chimp.</i>

765
00:56:30,873 --> 00:56:32,748
<i>No, exactly the opposite.</i>

766
00:56:32,751 --> 00:56:34,629
<i>Exactly the opposite.</i>

767
00:56:36,475 --> 00:56:38,597
Nim, in the cage,

768
00:56:38,629 --> 00:56:41,972
no special treatment, no yogurt,
no granola,

769
00:56:41,916 --> 00:56:43,323
no... None of that.

770
00:56:43,993 --> 00:56:46,030
<i>It was pretty traumatic
for the chimp.</i>

771
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,540
They curl up

772
00:56:53,879 --> 00:56:55,332
and lay down.

773
00:56:55,835 --> 00:56:59,044
They lose interest in food. They just...

774
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:04,795
<i>It was a bad start with Nim and I.</i>

775
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,708
<i>The chimp is very upset.</i>

776
00:57:06,754 --> 00:57:10,210
And he just looks at me
and he jumps and lunges at me

777
00:57:10,163 --> 00:57:13,662
and bites through an artery
right in here.

778
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:15,918
<i>I did use a small shock stick.</i>

779
00:57:16,363 --> 00:57:18,486
(chimpanzee screeching)

780
00:57:19,363 --> 00:57:20,773
<i>He had to grow up</i>

781
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:24,712
<i>and not be a single, spoiled child
any more.</i>

782
00:57:26,562 --> 00:57:28,517
<i>So, you got to socialise,</i>

783
00:57:28,524 --> 00:57:30,561
<i>work on his "chimpanzee"</i>

784
00:57:31,165 --> 00:57:32,788
<i>and manners.</i>

785
00:57:40,641 --> 00:57:42,386
Everybody needs a job.

786
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,956
<i>Meaning and purpose.</i>

787
00:57:49,046 --> 00:57:52,465
<i>I had them out, they would
help me in the big kitchen</i>

788
00:57:52,406 --> 00:57:56,152
<i>where we prepped our food
and did stuff, they'd sweep...</i>

789
00:57:56,088 --> 00:57:59,951
<i>Nim was a compulsive hand washer,
he'd do dishes.</i>

790
00:58:00,572 --> 00:58:03,771
<i>Vanessa liked to dust,</i>

791
00:58:03,725 --> 00:58:08,060
<i>little Mac liked to clean cages
and wear my boots.</i>

792
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:14,379
This was a special group of chimps.

793
00:58:14,367 --> 00:58:16,245
They weren't ordinary chimps.

794
00:58:16,248 --> 00:58:19,086
You know, they had the capacity
for higher consciousness.

795
00:58:32,732 --> 00:58:34,397
(screeching)

796
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:43,870
<i>Terrace came back a year later.</i>

797
00:58:45,778 --> 00:58:47,934
<i>(Bob) Herb arrived with</i>

798
00:58:48,379 --> 00:58:51,245
<i>still photographers and cameras
and that sort of thing.</i>

799
00:58:52,176 --> 00:58:54,749
<i>It was a shoot
and it was arranged as such.</i>

800
00:58:57,496 --> 00:58:59,326
<i>(Herb) There was no question</i>

801
00:58:59,412 --> 00:59:01,873
<i>that he was very happy
that he could see me again.</i>

802
00:59:02,376 --> 00:59:05,750
There was no anger that,
"Why did you leave me here?"

803
00:59:05,821 --> 00:59:09,521
It was just, "Hey, that's great.
I wanna see him again."

804
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,466
<i>(Bob) You could see that he was like,
"Holy shit, I'm going back to New York!"</i>

805
00:59:14,424 --> 00:59:15,831
<i>It was like that.</i>

806
00:59:15,857 --> 00:59:17,522
<i>Like he was going to be rescued.</i>

807
00:59:20,776 --> 00:59:22,320
<i>It was kind of sad.</i>

808
00:59:25,744 --> 00:59:28,774
<i>(Herb) I played with him,
we got into games of signing.</i>

809
00:59:28,904 --> 00:59:31,231
<i>I remember I got him to sign "hug".</i>

810
00:59:31,261 --> 00:59:32,836
<i>I got him to sign "Herb".</i>

811
00:59:32,862 --> 00:59:35,021
<i>In fact, I could get almost any sign
out of him.</i>

812
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,978
<i>I didn't have to go through a drill.</i>

813
00:59:37,981 --> 00:59:41,650
<i>So, it was a very entertaining,
comfortable afternoon.</i>

814
00:59:41,904 --> 00:59:43,946
<i>No bad behaviour of any kind.</i>

815
00:59:44,865 --> 00:59:47,237
<i>(Alyce) At the end of the day,
looks at his watch,</i>

816
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:49,185
<i>gives me Nim back,</i>

817
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:50,595
<i>and flies off.</i>

818
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:53,927
And is gone.

819
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:57,468
<i>Next morning he barely ate.</i>

820
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:00,838
<i>He just started to crater.</i>

821
01:00:03,429 --> 01:00:05,085
<i>(Bob) Herb never came back.</i>

822
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:09,996
<i>I thought,
"I'm going to become Nim's friend,</i>

823
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:13,029
<i>"and I'm going to hang with Nim
and we'll see what happens. "</i>

824
01:00:14,633 --> 01:00:17,249
<i>I mean, there wasn't much I could do
for him in terms of the cage,</i>

825
01:00:17,232 --> 01:00:19,471
<i>but get him out.</i>

826
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:23,079
Oh, you saw that, huh?

827
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,328
See you later, Nim!

828
01:00:30,992 --> 01:00:32,368
<i>We just liked each other right off,</i>

829
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:34,767
<i>and sometimes it's like that.</i>

830
01:00:50,352 --> 01:00:51,849
<i>Chimps aren't humans.</i>

831
01:00:53,315 --> 01:00:55,273
<i>You have to kind of
understand chimps</i>

832
01:00:55,281 --> 01:00:58,939
<i>to be able to understand how
to work with them and be with them.</i>

833
01:01:04,158 --> 01:01:06,777
<i>I took him out on walks.
I didn't bring food.</i>

834
01:01:06,761 --> 01:01:09,051
<i>I didn't do the kind of things</i>

835
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:11,913
<i>that would interrupt
the relationship</i>

836
01:01:11,879 --> 01:01:14,370
<i>or the building of the relationship.</i>

837
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:21,553
<i>He grows on you quick.</i>

838
01:01:21,562 --> 01:01:23,854
<i>He was so charming.</i>

839
01:01:23,844 --> 01:01:28,753
<i>It didn't occur to me that animals
had that kind of personality like ours.</i>

840
01:01:30,402 --> 01:01:32,774
<i>(Alyce) And you had
to be true of heart.</i>

841
01:01:33,165 --> 01:01:35,069
<i>You had to be true of heart.</i>

842
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:39,250
<i>If you had dark places in you, they'd
know it and they wouldn't like you.</i>

843
01:01:57,484 --> 01:01:59,942
Good morning. With us this morning
is Dr Herbert Terrace,

844
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:02,551
a professor of psychology
at Columbia University.

845
01:02:02,925 --> 01:02:05,797
For several years, Dr Terrace
was in charge of an experiment

846
01:02:05,925 --> 01:02:07,883
where he and several other human beings

847
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,214
tried to teach a chimpanzee named Nim

848
01:02:10,405 --> 01:02:12,530
the sign language of the deaf.

849
01:02:12,648 --> 01:02:15,599
<i>But now in a book just published,
which is called Nim,</i>

850
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:19,152
you're saying, Dr Terrace,
that these experiments don't prove

851
01:02:19,094 --> 01:02:21,630
as much as you had
originally thought they did?

852
01:02:21,931 --> 01:02:24,764
<i>(Herb) I changed my
mind about the data.</i>

853
01:02:30,735 --> 01:02:34,234
<i>I suddenly saw what
the key to this was.</i>

854
01:02:35,493 --> 01:02:37,281
<i>Nim was a brilliant beggar.</i>

855
01:02:38,853 --> 01:02:41,180
<i>He learned how to beg</i>

856
01:02:41,816 --> 01:02:44,185
<i>and he could work his teachers</i>

857
01:02:44,254 --> 01:02:47,923
<i>and always get what he wanted by
moving his hands in different ways.</i>

858
01:02:48,613 --> 01:02:52,662
And most of the time he moved his hands
in the ways that the teachers suggested.

859
01:02:53,257 --> 01:02:55,748
And the motive for signing

860
01:02:55,973 --> 01:02:58,140
was not to say,

861
01:02:58,138 --> 01:03:01,336
"What a nice cat you have over there,"
but, "I want it."

862
01:03:02,496 --> 01:03:04,127
<i>(interviewer) When the experiments
were over,</i>

863
01:03:04,139 --> 01:03:07,010
you returned Nim to the primate colony
where he was born.

864
01:03:06,977 --> 01:03:10,679
A year after that you went back for a
visit, and we came along with a camera.

865
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:14,880
<i>You and he are talking
in sign language here.</i>

866
01:03:14,982 --> 01:03:17,431
<i>Here we have it in slow motion.
What's Nim saying?</i>

867
01:03:18,181 --> 01:03:21,469
<i>(Herb) He's saying,
"Give Nim banana."</i>

868
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:26,011
Why is it that you're saying
that he can't speak like a human being?

869
01:03:26,063 --> 01:03:29,843
Well, a string of signs is not
necessarily a sentence.

870
01:03:31,381 --> 01:03:34,332
You can learn a list of words by rote,

871
01:03:34,425 --> 01:03:37,212
and that says nothing about
your ability to use a grammar.

872
01:03:37,267 --> 01:03:40,880
Aren't you very disappointed that you
spent all this time and all this money?

873
01:03:40,987 --> 01:03:43,226
Well, it would have been
very electrifying news,

874
01:03:43,229 --> 01:03:45,545
almost like communicating
with a creature from outer space,

875
01:03:45,545 --> 01:03:49,161
if I could show that another organism

876
01:03:49,107 --> 01:03:51,510
could use language the way humans have.

877
01:03:51,507 --> 01:03:52,883
- But it didn't work.
- It didn't work.

878
01:03:53,066 --> 01:03:54,978
<i>Thank you very much, Dr Terrace.</i>

879
01:03:54,985 --> 01:03:57,476
<i>(woman) I hope somebody
can still talk to Nim, in any event.</i>

880
01:04:12,986 --> 01:04:15,559
<i>(Bob) I didn't care about
the language argument after a while,</i>

881
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:17,341
<i>it didn't matter to me.</i>

882
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:21,570
<i>He might not have had
sentences or grammar,</i>

883
01:04:21,628 --> 01:04:24,588
<i>but there's no question that there
was communication going on,</i>

884
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:26,630
<i>and I saw it clearly.</i>

885
01:04:33,676 --> 01:04:36,919
<i>He talked about the trees,
the berries that he found.</i>

886
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:43,501
He liked to play.

887
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,838
<i>Favourite sign, "play".</i>

888
01:04:51,556 --> 01:04:53,545
(Bob laughing)

889
01:04:55,078 --> 01:04:57,370
Holy shit, he doesn't know
which one to grab.

890
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:03,319
<i>(Bob) He knew what pot was,
or hash, or whatever.</i>

891
01:05:05,959 --> 01:05:08,914
<i>(chuckles) And he wanted
to smoke a joint.</i>

892
01:05:12,236 --> 01:05:13,612
Stone.

893
01:05:14,921 --> 01:05:16,377
Smoke.

894
01:05:16,841 --> 01:05:18,251
<i>Now.</i>

895
01:05:18,284 --> 01:05:21,561
<i>When we went out on walks with him,
Nim was one of us,</i>

896
01:05:21,521 --> 01:05:23,479
<i>and if we smoked a joint,
he smoked it with us.</i>

897
01:05:23,478 --> 01:05:25,356
<i>In the circle, we handed it to him.</i>

898
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,733
Chimps are like us, they're hedonistic,

899
01:05:30,723 --> 01:05:32,959
they like to do pleasurable things,
they like to...

900
01:05:33,001 --> 01:05:36,503
You know, they like to have fun,
and hell, who doesn't?

901
01:05:42,326 --> 01:05:44,696
<i>(Alyce) And there was something
in marijuana...</i>

902
01:05:47,084 --> 01:05:48,746
<i>They weren't aggressive.</i>

903
01:05:49,361 --> 01:05:51,821
You talk less, you do different things,

904
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:54,036
you enjoy each other.

905
01:05:56,767 --> 01:06:02,224
<i>(Bob) Lily and Nim lived together
in the pig barn.</i>

906
01:06:04,688 --> 01:06:06,978
<i>(Alyce) Both of them didn't have
many chimp friends,</i>

907
01:06:08,086 --> 01:06:11,038
<i>and then they became friends.</i>

908
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:18,811
<i>They were seen copulating,</i>

909
01:06:19,052 --> 01:06:22,585
<i>and we think Nim might have been
the father of Lily's baby.</i>

910
01:06:36,494 --> 01:06:38,653
Had the best time in my life,
I still say that.

911
01:06:38,814 --> 01:06:40,441
I've never had such a good time.

912
01:06:40,491 --> 01:06:43,579
Except maybe at a Grateful Dead show.
Pretty close.

913
01:06:43,854 --> 01:06:45,642
I don't even know which one I'd...

914
01:06:45,656 --> 01:06:49,025
Actually, being with Nim...
I'd rather be with Nim than Jerry,

915
01:06:48,973 --> 01:06:51,509
and, for me, that's saying something.

916
01:06:55,135 --> 01:06:58,554
<i>(man) That's real.
(Bob) Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a banana?</i>

917
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:01,275
Wanna eat the shoe?

918
01:07:03,621 --> 01:07:05,324
That's a shoe, this is a berry.

919
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:20,753
<i>(Bob) And that's when Mahoney
started showing up.</i>

920
01:07:22,584 --> 01:07:24,706
He was standing around,

921
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:27,955
looking at chimps and writing on his pad
and whatever.

922
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:29,982
When someone...

923
01:07:30,064 --> 01:07:31,642
When I found out who he was,

924
01:07:31,661 --> 01:07:35,449
and I'm sure it didn't take long
for me to figure it out, I was...

925
01:07:35,505 --> 01:07:38,504
Obviously he was checking out
the chimps for the lab.

926
01:07:38,545 --> 01:07:42,413
LEMSIP is best known by its acronym,
L-E-M-S-I-P,

927
01:07:42,342 --> 01:07:47,586
which is Laboratory for Experimental
Medicine and Surgery in Primates.

928
01:07:47,706 --> 01:07:51,489
He represented the devil to me.

929
01:07:51,507 --> 01:07:55,253
Most of the work that we did
with the chimpanzees, for example,

930
01:07:55,189 --> 01:07:56,892
was

931
01:07:57,989 --> 01:07:59,981
testing various

932
01:08:00,944 --> 01:08:02,944
candidate vaccines

933
01:08:03,033 --> 01:08:08,156
for, like, hepatitis B, hepatitis C,
HIV, AIDS.

934
01:08:08,228 --> 01:08:10,799
I think it's very difficult

935
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:14,950
to fund the kinds of research

936
01:08:14,948 --> 01:08:17,073
that I happen to be
very much interested in.

937
01:08:17,067 --> 01:08:20,074
It's been difficult to fund
social research in general.

938
01:08:21,947 --> 01:08:26,575
<i>(James) We heard about Dr Lemmon's
problems, which were financial.</i>

939
01:08:28,232 --> 01:08:30,312
<i>It was finally arranged that, yes,</i>

940
01:08:30,313 --> 01:08:33,732
<i>we would take a very large part
of their colony.</i>

941
01:08:36,636 --> 01:08:39,207
I thought Lemmon was trying
to scare the university.

942
01:08:39,474 --> 01:08:42,181
I thought they would go,

943
01:08:42,153 --> 01:08:44,062
"Oh, gosh, you can't sell them
to a medical lab."

944
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:45,488
"We've got to do something."

945
01:08:45,514 --> 01:08:47,594
I thought the community
would rise itself up.

946
01:08:47,633 --> 01:08:51,132
Bob and I tried so hard
with public appeal

947
01:08:51,192 --> 01:08:55,943
for something for the chimps,
and there was no response.

948
01:08:56,119 --> 01:08:58,077
And then, shortly after that,

949
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:00,148
the chimps were indeed sold.

950
01:09:07,959 --> 01:09:10,876
<i>(interviewer) Of the chimps that are
being sent off to the lab today,</i>

951
01:09:10,836 --> 01:09:13,676
<i>how many of them were subjects
of the signing research?</i>

952
01:09:13,876 --> 01:09:15,754
Only one

953
01:09:16,438 --> 01:09:20,487
was restricted to signing research.
This is Nim.

954
01:09:24,642 --> 01:09:26,353
(lorry engine running)

955
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:30,952
<i>(James) As a chimp, you've got no way
of knowing what's happening to you.</i>

956
01:09:30,919 --> 01:09:34,372
<i>You're just suddenly cut off
from seeing everything outside.</i>

957
01:09:36,122 --> 01:09:40,370
<i>Suddenly, after a day and a half
of constant driving,</i>

958
01:09:40,365 --> 01:09:43,532
<i>you get out the other end
and you're in another sort of room.</i>

959
01:09:51,008 --> 01:09:53,167
(chimpanzees hooting)

960
01:10:01,284 --> 01:10:04,493
<i>I wouldn't say
they were jumping with joy</i>

961
01:10:06,089 --> 01:10:08,211
<i>to find themselves in a new place.</i>

962
01:10:17,331 --> 01:10:22,127
Come on. Come here. Come on.
One more time. One more time!

963
01:10:22,012 --> 01:10:24,134
(chimpanzee screaming)

964
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:28,414
It's over. It's all right, it's over.

965
01:10:31,173 --> 01:10:34,295
I took on the role of being
the one who chose

966
01:10:34,774 --> 01:10:38,060
which animals would go into
which types of study.

967
01:10:39,938 --> 01:10:41,345
And I hated it.

968
01:10:41,617 --> 01:10:43,989
<i>(James) Spike, Spike,
come over here, Spike.</i>

969
01:10:43,974 --> 01:10:46,891
Spike, come on over here. Come on.

970
01:10:52,176 --> 01:10:53,921
You want to go away with Spike?

971
01:10:54,940 --> 01:11:00,397
These animals will be used
on hepatitis vaccine safety tests.

972
01:11:00,296 --> 01:11:03,795
It is a federal law that before

973
01:11:03,856 --> 01:11:07,727
a new batch of vaccine can be released
on the American market,

974
01:11:07,656 --> 01:11:10,741
it must be tested in four chimpanzees.

975
01:11:11,338 --> 01:11:13,911
<i>There's no way, in all honesty...</i>

976
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:17,481
There's no way
you can carry out research on animals

977
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:19,786
and for it to be humane.

978
01:11:19,819 --> 01:11:21,561
It can't be humane,

979
01:11:21,743 --> 01:11:24,363
because you already put them in a cage.

980
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:28,501
That was already the first step,
and from there on, it's downhill.

981
01:11:28,865 --> 01:11:31,528
(chimpanzees screeching)

982
01:11:35,182 --> 01:11:38,513
<i>We realised that certain
of the Oklahoma chimps</i>

983
01:11:38,579 --> 01:11:41,207
<i>could use sign language
and were trying</i>

984
01:11:41,183 --> 01:11:42,758
<i>to sign with us.</i>

985
01:11:42,785 --> 01:11:46,367
<i>What we did was,
we wrote down on sheets of paper,</i>

986
01:11:46,309 --> 01:11:48,758
<i>which we posted all over the place,</i>

987
01:11:48,747 --> 01:11:51,949
<i>on doors and walls
and everywhere we could find,</i>

988
01:11:51,911 --> 01:11:54,067
<i>certain signs,</i>

989
01:11:54,103 --> 01:11:57,269
<i>and it was hoped that,
as time went by,</i>

990
01:11:57,228 --> 01:12:01,936
<i>everyone would pick up at least
a certain amount of sign language.</i>

991
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:09,133
<i>I didn't see</i>

992
01:12:10,871 --> 01:12:14,620
<i>Nim as special,
above anyone else in the group,</i>

993
01:12:14,548 --> 01:12:18,336
<i>because they were all going through
the same thing.</i>

994
01:12:48,075 --> 01:12:53,037
<i>(Bob) I made a big, big stink about
it in every way I could.</i>

995
01:12:52,955 --> 01:12:57,706
<i>I called the press.
We bitched as much as we could.</i>

996
01:13:07,035 --> 01:13:09,407
<i>(Jim) The student Bob Ingersoll,</i>

997
01:13:09,599 --> 01:13:12,306
<i>he used to hound me
every chance he got,</i>

998
01:13:12,675 --> 01:13:14,922
<i>and I would start to
get really annoyed.</i>

999
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,345
And then it dawned on me

1000
01:13:17,358 --> 01:13:20,230
that he was the only one who cared.

1001
01:13:20,918 --> 01:13:23,625
Nobody, nobody,

1002
01:13:23,644 --> 01:13:25,518
except the press, helped us.

1003
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,719
<i>(interviewer) Is there anything
that you would consider doing</i>

1004
01:13:27,764 --> 01:13:29,631
to prevent what is going
to happen to him?

1005
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:33,383
Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do

1006
01:13:33,327 --> 01:13:35,989
because legally Nim is not mine.

1007
01:13:35,965 --> 01:13:39,668
Nim was loaned to me
for the duration of my project.

1008
01:13:40,004 --> 01:13:41,579
That project ran out of funds...

1009
01:13:41,605 --> 01:13:43,844
(phone ringing)

1010
01:13:47,767 --> 01:13:50,007
<i>(Henry) Somebody at the Boston Globe</i>

1011
01:13:50,087 --> 01:13:53,205
<i>told me to read a front-page story
on that day</i>

1012
01:13:53,446 --> 01:13:55,941
<i>and he said,
"I think you'd be interested,</i>

1013
01:13:55,927 --> 01:13:57,715
<i>"and I know you take unusual cases."</i>

1014
01:14:00,607 --> 01:14:02,432
As a human being, I thought it was

1015
01:14:02,526 --> 01:14:05,945
a kind of esoteric, unique form
of animal cruelty,

1016
01:14:05,886 --> 01:14:07,262
all the worse for that.

1017
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:10,489
And as a lawyer
I thought it was just plain illegal.

1018
01:14:10,567 --> 01:14:12,894
If the facts are, as I'm being told,

1019
01:14:12,893 --> 01:14:16,258
that this young chimp
was brought up from infancy

1020
01:14:16,253 --> 01:14:18,792
in a human family, you can't stick him

1021
01:14:18,771 --> 01:14:21,855
into a little cage
in some horrible medical lab

1022
01:14:21,809 --> 01:14:23,272
and use him for medical experiments.

1023
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:25,495
<i>It's per se animal cruelty.</i>

1024
01:14:26,812 --> 01:14:28,892
Early on, I decided this:

1025
01:14:29,576 --> 01:14:35,158
If this animal has been deliberately
brought up from infanthood

1026
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:37,500
to think of himself as human,

1027
01:14:37,494 --> 01:14:41,657
then, if I'm going to represent him,
I have to treat him like a human client.

1028
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:44,084
<i>Give him his day in court.</i>

1029
01:14:46,259 --> 01:14:51,046
<i>(Bob) Henry and I, Mr Herrmann, were in
communication pretty much every day.</i>

1030
01:14:52,736 --> 01:14:54,691
He used a really cool strategy,
actually.

1031
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:57,778
He said,
"Hey, this chimp can speak for himself."

1032
01:14:57,739 --> 01:14:59,282
"Let's bring him into court
and let him talk."

1033
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:01,660
What I had ready as a trial exhibit

1034
01:15:02,258 --> 01:15:04,049
was a steel cage

1035
01:15:04,139 --> 01:15:07,805
and a couple of strong guys with a pole
ready to carry it into court.

1036
01:15:08,059 --> 01:15:12,307
<i>And I was going to get Nim to go into
a frenzy and signal "out, out, out".</i>

1037
01:15:12,302 --> 01:15:14,260
And I believe the judge said

1038
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:17,866
something to the effect that,
"I'm not letting a fucking chimpanzee"

1039
01:15:17,819 --> 01:15:20,941
"come in here and make a mockery
of my courtroom,"

1040
01:15:20,898 --> 01:15:22,101
or something to that effect.

1041
01:15:22,262 --> 01:15:24,334
And that's when I said
I'm going to bring, in effect,

1042
01:15:24,343 --> 01:15:26,749
a habeas corpus petition
on behalf of the chimp.

1043
01:15:26,746 --> 01:15:28,366
<i>Bring him to court.</i>

1044
01:15:32,263 --> 01:15:36,210
<i>Our opponents were pigheaded,
but they weren't stupid.</i>

1045
01:15:36,345 --> 01:15:38,916
They realised that win, lose or draw,

1046
01:15:38,907 --> 01:15:40,944
once I got into court, they'd be losing,

1047
01:15:40,941 --> 01:15:43,435
because even if the judge
refused to hear him,

1048
01:15:43,467 --> 01:15:46,083
the media attention would
have been devastating.

1049
01:15:47,027 --> 01:15:49,521
<i>And the dean
of the medical faculty said,</i>

1050
01:15:49,706 --> 01:15:52,198
<i>"That's it, get that
chimp out of here."</i>

1051
01:15:58,384 --> 01:16:01,144
<i>Before anything could happen,</i>

1052
01:16:01,345 --> 01:16:03,090
<i>swooping down,</i>

1053
01:16:03,748 --> 01:16:06,534
<i>like in some Wagnerian drama,</i>

1054
01:16:06,511 --> 01:16:08,667
<i>comes Cleveland Amory.</i>

1055
01:16:12,587 --> 01:16:14,667
I want this to be a place

1056
01:16:14,752 --> 01:16:17,671
where those animals
that have been abused,

1057
01:16:17,631 --> 01:16:19,419
that have been misused,

1058
01:16:19,509 --> 01:16:22,262
will finally and forever

1059
01:16:22,312 --> 01:16:26,180
have a place that they never
will have to fear again.

1060
01:16:28,596 --> 01:16:31,874
<i>(Henry) Mr Amory had, up until then,</i>

1061
01:16:31,834 --> 01:16:33,491
<i>perhaps a well-deserved reputation</i>

1062
01:16:33,515 --> 01:16:36,177
<i>for doing important work
for animal rights.</i>

1063
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:39,000
<i>And he just went and buys the chimp,</i>

1064
01:16:39,555 --> 01:16:42,921
<i>takes him to his Black Horse Ranch
or whatever it was called,</i>

1065
01:16:42,991 --> 01:16:45,318
<i>and says, "I am saving Nim."</i>

1066
01:16:45,555 --> 01:16:47,757
<i>(reporter) Cleveland Amory
to the rescue again.</i>

1067
01:16:47,756 --> 01:16:50,790
<i>Nim will live here
for the rest of his natural life.</i>

1068
01:16:53,312 --> 01:16:57,895
<i>(Marion) "Here my story ends, my
troubles are over, and I am at home. "</i>

1069
01:16:58,676 --> 01:17:01,718
<i>And that's what it says as
you drive into Black Beauty Ranch.</i>

1070
01:17:03,157 --> 01:17:04,982
He was the only animal we ever bought.

1071
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,707
And we didn't know
a thing about chimpanzees,

1072
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:09,174
but we just thought it was better...

1073
01:17:09,196 --> 01:17:11,610
What we could do was better
than where he was.

1074
01:17:14,323 --> 01:17:17,402
<i>It was never meant to be
a home for caged animals.</i>

1075
01:17:19,159 --> 01:17:22,578
<i>It is really a home for abused
and abandoned equine animals.</i>

1076
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,725
<i>That's animals just with hooves.</i>

1077
01:17:29,726 --> 01:17:33,639
<i>(Henry) We were aghast that
he would just pick up this chimp,</i>

1078
01:17:33,562 --> 01:17:36,897
<i>transport him to a horse ranch
somewhere in the middle of nowhere,</i>

1079
01:17:37,766 --> 01:17:40,968
<i>and there was nobody there who
knew how to take care of a chimp.</i>

1080
01:17:43,567 --> 01:17:47,183
<i>(Marion) We brought him to Black
Beauty and built a house for him.</i>

1081
01:17:48,724 --> 01:17:51,723
It was a big, kind of a square place

1082
01:17:51,687 --> 01:17:54,137
and it had a porch outside
so that he could go outside,

1083
01:17:54,165 --> 01:17:57,119
and he had all sorts of toys
to play with, but it was solitary.

1084
01:18:09,253 --> 01:18:10,953
Chimps are social animals.

1085
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:14,057
And you can't just put
one chimp in a box

1086
01:18:14,133 --> 01:18:15,924
and expect everything to be cool.

1087
01:18:23,971 --> 01:18:27,339
Some of the time he was sitting
like this, in the corner.

1088
01:18:27,853 --> 01:18:29,431
And you just thought,
"What is he thinking,"

1089
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:30,947
"what is he missing, what can we do?"

1090
01:18:31,015 --> 01:18:34,381
<i>Will you please be sure to stop off
here in the nation's capital?</i>

1091
01:18:34,852 --> 01:18:37,939
We had a TV down and then he broke that,

1092
01:18:37,892 --> 01:18:39,934
and then we put one up in the ceiling,

1093
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:41,848
and he found a way to get up there.

1094
01:18:43,056 --> 01:18:44,676
<i>(chuckling) Well, okay,
you don't get a television</i>

1095
01:18:44,697 --> 01:18:46,153
<i>if that's gonna be your attitude.</i>

1096
01:18:49,579 --> 01:18:52,698
<i>(Bob) I wrote letters to Cleveland
bitching at him about how</i>

1097
01:18:53,377 --> 01:18:56,910
<i>leaving Nim there alone
was virtually torture.</i>

1098
01:19:06,461 --> 01:19:08,416
Not only did they not care
what I thought,

1099
01:19:08,663 --> 01:19:11,776
they wanted me as far away
from them as possible.

1100
01:19:12,898 --> 01:19:14,643
They wanted to make that pretty clear,

1101
01:19:14,902 --> 01:19:16,974
and they did make that pretty clear.

1102
01:19:16,982 --> 01:19:18,770
"If you come here, you'll be arrested."

1103
01:19:35,182 --> 01:19:37,968
I felt it, you know,
and I just wanted to...

1104
01:19:39,382 --> 01:19:41,257
I don't know, I...

1105
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,739
<i>(Marion) He got out
a number of times.</i>

1106
01:19:59,063 --> 01:20:02,026
<i>What he wanted to do
was go in the ranch house,</i>

1107
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:06,376
<i>be in the ranch house, be with
people, sleep in a bed.</i>

1108
01:20:07,031 --> 01:20:09,020
Well, we had a bed for him in his house.

1109
01:20:09,031 --> 01:20:10,521
We never slept in the bed in his house.

1110
01:20:12,909 --> 01:20:16,442
One time when he came in the house,
there was a little white poodle

1111
01:20:16,392 --> 01:20:18,384
that just barked and barked and barked

1112
01:20:18,395 --> 01:20:20,965
at this chimpanzee
coming through the door.

1113
01:20:21,033 --> 01:20:23,606
He just picked it up
and swung him against the wall.

1114
01:20:23,675 --> 01:20:26,705
He meant to shut the dog up,
but, of course, he killed the dog.

1115
01:20:27,473 --> 01:20:28,970
<i>There was another time
when he went in the house</i>

1116
01:20:28,992 --> 01:20:30,570
<i>and he picked up a chair
and threw it through the window.</i>

1117
01:20:37,517 --> 01:20:40,383
<i>This is a very miserable chimpanzee,
you know?</i>

1118
01:20:42,351 --> 01:20:43,814
<i>He'd had such a chequered life,</i>

1119
01:20:43,832 --> 01:20:46,673
<i>he'd gone from here to here
to here to here to here.</i>

1120
01:20:47,594 --> 01:20:51,127
<i>They should not be taken away from
their mothers in the first place.</i>

1121
01:20:51,637 --> 01:20:53,382
(knocking)

1122
01:21:02,396 --> 01:21:04,027
<i>(Stephanie) I knew
that Nim was there.</i>

1123
01:21:04,039 --> 01:21:06,789
<i>I didn't know anything about
the quality of his life there.</i>

1124
01:21:06,762 --> 01:21:09,928
<i>You heard good things and bad things
and so on.</i>

1125
01:21:09,879 --> 01:21:11,709
And I thought, why not go?

1126
01:21:14,399 --> 01:21:16,969
<i>(Jenny) So we all flew out to Texas,</i>

1127
01:21:16,998 --> 01:21:19,872
<i>we go to the ranch, we meet
the people taking care of him.</i>

1128
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,891
He was alone.
He was the only chimp there.

1129
01:21:29,799 --> 01:21:32,886
I happened to be looking at him
when Stephanie got out of the car,

1130
01:21:33,044 --> 01:21:36,131
and he saw her
and he recognised her right away,

1131
01:21:36,322 --> 01:21:38,447
and the look on his face was just,

1132
01:21:38,448 --> 01:21:39,821
"Oh, now you come."

1133
01:21:40,165 --> 01:21:43,454
<i>"Now you come. Now I've been
through all this, and now you come. "</i>

1134
01:21:47,848 --> 01:21:49,806
<i>(Jenny) He definitely recognised us.</i>

1135
01:21:50,886 --> 01:21:53,673
Whether he was happy to see us,
I don't know.

1136
01:21:57,124 --> 01:21:59,417
<i>(Stephanie) He wasn't
particularly attractive to me</i>

1137
01:21:59,405 --> 01:22:01,314
<i>now that he was an adult chimpanzee.</i>

1138
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:02,606
I didn't have a,

1139
01:22:02,649 --> 01:22:05,357
"Oh, isn't he beautiful,"
or anything like that.

1140
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:07,072
He was... I didn't know him.

1141
01:22:09,165 --> 01:22:10,964
My mother decides

1142
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:15,016
that she wants to go
into the enclosure with Nim.

1143
01:22:15,251 --> 01:22:16,795
Which didn't...

1144
01:22:16,971 --> 01:22:19,173
Which happened sort of,
"I'm going to go in with Nim."

1145
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:22,140
We said to her,

1146
01:22:22,173 --> 01:22:24,162
"He doesn't look like
he's going to welcome you,"

1147
01:22:24,174 --> 01:22:26,132
"so maybe you shouldn't go
into his facility."

1148
01:22:27,737 --> 01:22:29,638
I was curious. "Is he gonna sign?"

1149
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:31,276
"What's gonna happen?
What's it gonna be like?"

1150
01:22:31,611 --> 01:22:35,144
Stephanie, please don't go in there,
he's not in a good mood.

1151
01:22:35,094 --> 01:22:37,500
You know, you can tell
he's not in a good mood.

1152
01:22:37,497 --> 01:22:39,154
(grunting)

1153
01:22:40,253 --> 01:22:42,790
I opened the gate and walked in.

1154
01:22:43,337 --> 01:22:45,329
Nim went up to the, like,

1155
01:22:45,379 --> 01:22:47,748
first-and-a-half storey,
something like that,

1156
01:22:47,733 --> 01:22:49,364
pretty high up.

1157
01:22:49,652 --> 01:22:52,357
And I realised how much danger I was in.

1158
01:22:55,777 --> 01:22:57,355
(hooting)

1159
01:22:57,379 --> 01:23:01,508
He came down, and then it was a blur.

1160
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:04,352
He grabbed her by the ankle

1161
01:23:04,377 --> 01:23:07,164
and he starts dragging her,
running back and forth,

1162
01:23:07,142 --> 01:23:09,545
literally like a rag doll,
just pulling her back and forth.

1163
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:11,124
I think he's going to kill her.

1164
01:23:11,139 --> 01:23:12,515
He was gonna swing her against the wall

1165
01:23:12,544 --> 01:23:14,033
and then swing her
against the wall again.

1166
01:23:14,064 --> 01:23:15,718
There was nothing loving about it,
he was furious.

1167
01:23:15,942 --> 01:23:17,900
(hooting)

1168
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:21,329
I remember there being discussions about

1169
01:23:21,382 --> 01:23:24,002
getting the gun
or not getting the gun, yeah.

1170
01:23:25,022 --> 01:23:26,517
<i>So they got a gun.</i>

1171
01:23:31,742 --> 01:23:35,156
No, he's not going to kill her,
he's just really pissed off.

1172
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:36,834
(grunting)

1173
01:23:37,306 --> 01:23:39,971
<i>(Stephanie) Things dissipate
and he sort of wandered off</i>

1174
01:23:39,946 --> 01:23:41,691
and I was able to get out a door.

1175
01:23:41,705 --> 01:23:44,489
I have no idea how long
the whole thing lasted.

1176
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:49,683
The fact that he didn't kill her
meant a lot,

1177
01:23:49,706 --> 01:23:51,082
'cause he could have.

1178
01:23:52,425 --> 01:23:55,341
<i>And he would have been dead,
'cause they would have shot him.</i>

1179
01:23:58,947 --> 01:24:01,618
<i>(Stephanie) I had abandoned him,</i>

1180
01:24:01,671 --> 01:24:05,170
and he had managed to grow up,
and I had walked back in

1181
01:24:05,108 --> 01:24:09,271
as if I had not abandoned him,
and he said, "No."

1182
01:24:09,714 --> 01:24:11,121
"This is my space."

1183
01:24:11,147 --> 01:24:15,230
"I'm going to put you in your place,
but I'm not going to hurt you."

1184
01:24:23,595 --> 01:24:26,461
<i>We had done so much damage,</i>

1185
01:24:26,435 --> 01:24:30,515
<i>removing him from
what his life should have been.</i>

1186
01:24:30,593 --> 01:24:35,837
<i>We exploited his human-like nature
without regard to his chimpanzee nature.</i>

1187
01:24:36,272 --> 01:24:39,064
<i>We were co-opting him
right from the beginning.</i>

1188
01:24:39,831 --> 01:24:42,786
<i>It was wrong. It was wrong.</i>

1189
01:25:15,278 --> 01:25:17,905
<i>(Bob) About a year after Nim
was sold to the Fund,</i>

1190
01:25:17,881 --> 01:25:20,664
<i>they purchased a female chimpanzee
to be with him.</i>

1191
01:25:21,202 --> 01:25:25,036
<i>Around ten years after that,
I heard she was in failing health.</i>

1192
01:25:25,237 --> 01:25:27,865
<i>I was worried that Nim
was going to be on his own again.</i>

1193
01:25:28,761 --> 01:25:31,766
<i>That same time I was told that
a new guy had taken over the ranch,</i>

1194
01:25:31,723 --> 01:25:34,050
<i>and his name was Chris Burn.</i>

1195
01:25:34,647 --> 01:25:37,131
<i>So I approached Chris
about visiting Nim.</i>

1196
01:25:42,965 --> 01:25:47,627
<i>Once I met Chris
I was really, really reassured</i>

1197
01:25:47,522 --> 01:25:50,442
<i>that things were going to be
much better for Nim.</i>

1198
01:25:50,409 --> 01:25:53,025
<i>(man) Look, Nim.
Somebody's come to see you.</i>

1199
01:25:53,009 --> 01:25:54,712
Oh, he's got his hackles up.

1200
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:59,896
<i>- Hey, it's okay. - (Bob) Hi, Nim.
What's up, bud? Nim.</i>

1201
01:26:02,327 --> 01:26:04,819
Nim! What's up, bud?

1202
01:26:06,608 --> 01:26:08,485
(clicking tongue)

1203
01:26:08,571 --> 01:26:11,144
Yeah, I know, buddy. Who am I? Who am I?

1204
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,630
Hey, who are you?

1205
01:26:16,729 --> 01:26:18,139
Play, play.

1206
01:26:20,128 --> 01:26:21,873
Play where? Where?

1207
01:26:29,331 --> 01:26:30,908
(Bob panting playfully)

1208
01:26:33,573 --> 01:26:36,033
You are having such a good time.

1209
01:26:46,174 --> 01:26:50,087
<i>I said to Chris,
"I have a way to help you,</i>

1210
01:26:50,095 --> 01:26:53,102
<i>"and I know I can help you
to get other chimps,</i>

1211
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:55,369
<i>"so let's work together."</i>

1212
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:02,306
Buddy, things are improving.
Things are way improving.

1213
01:27:03,103 --> 01:27:06,883
It's taken awhile, though. It's taken
a long time. Hasn't been easy.

1214
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:12,224
<i>(James) On August the 10th, 1995,</i>

1215
01:27:12,218 --> 01:27:17,461
<i>the Dean of NYU Medical Center
announced that LEMSIP would be closed,</i>

1216
01:27:18,618 --> 01:27:23,166
<i>and I thought, "I'm going to try and
save as many of the chimps as I can,"</i>

1217
01:27:23,944 --> 01:27:27,389
<i>"but in a very quiet way, secretly."</i>

1218
01:27:28,463 --> 01:27:31,497
<i>(Bob) Hey, Lulu. What's up, girl?
How you doing?</i>

1219
01:27:31,465 --> 01:27:36,005
<i>(James) That's where Bob came in
through the secret network.</i>

1220
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:38,478
<i>(Bob) What's up, Nim?
Who is this over here?</i>

1221
01:27:38,746 --> 01:27:41,285
Who is this over here, Nim? Who is it?

1222
01:27:42,023 --> 01:27:43,981
This is gonna be your new roommate!

1223
01:27:48,547 --> 01:27:50,000
Isn't that nice?

1224
01:28:02,911 --> 01:28:06,613
<i>(Bob) What do you think, Mitch?
I told you it would be nice, didn't I?</i>

1225
01:28:06,551 --> 01:28:11,213
<i>Jim Mahoney moved literally
50, 60 chimps.</i>

1226
01:28:12,227 --> 01:28:16,811
<i>And we did indeed get
two chimps from LEMSIP,</i>

1227
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:19,714
<i>through Mahoney, to
Black Beauty Ranch.</i>

1228
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:24,000
<i>(James) Mitch was a
youngish adult male</i>

1229
01:28:24,428 --> 01:28:28,432
<i>and Lulu was very gentle.</i>

1230
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:36,626
Lulu immediately went to her defence
and Nim came over.

1231
01:28:36,991 --> 01:28:40,112
Very good, Lulu. She's so good.

1232
01:28:40,238 --> 01:28:41,691
<i>(Bob) Yeah, you're a friend, Lulu.</i>

1233
01:28:41,717 --> 01:28:45,960
<i>(James) I think Mitch and Lulu
really helped him out enormously.</i>

1234
01:28:50,236 --> 01:28:52,278
What? Now you're making noises for it.

1235
01:28:52,276 --> 01:28:54,021
What's the name of this?

1236
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,699
Nim's. Nim's what? Soda pop, I know.

1237
01:28:56,882 --> 01:28:59,712
<i>(Bob) Things were
as good as could be expected,</i>

1238
01:28:59,674 --> 01:29:04,055
<i>based on everything you know
that had gone on previous.</i>

1239
01:29:03,955 --> 01:29:06,582
Oh, yeah, that's so good, Nim.
Isn't it good?

1240
01:29:06,559 --> 01:29:09,563
<i>It wasn't exactly perfect.</i>

1241
01:29:09,519 --> 01:29:12,013
<i>But it was pretty damn good.</i>

1242
01:29:25,964 --> 01:29:29,500
<i>(James) Chimps are
truly wonderful animals.</i>

1243
01:29:31,205 --> 01:29:34,326
<i>They're very forgiving,
the vast majority of them.</i>

1244
01:29:38,964 --> 01:29:41,169
<i>They'll forgive you.</i>
