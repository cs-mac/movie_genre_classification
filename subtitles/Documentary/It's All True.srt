0
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:45,203
- Honey, I'm home.
- Roger that.

1
00:03:45,287 --> 00:03:48,643
Copy at the boathouse.
Right on time.

2
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:50,718
Faisil, get your butt in here.
Harry's inside.

3
00:03:51,807 --> 00:03:54,765
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

4
00:03:57,607 --> 00:04:00,041
- Hey, were you born in a barn?
- Whorehouse.

5
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:08,243
All right. You got
your fur-coated razor blade there...

6
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:10,636
and a bunch of guys with guns.

7
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:15,605
I'm switching to sub-vocal now.

8
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,122
Check, check.

9
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:19,959
- Check, check.
- It's talk radio.

10
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:21,196
- You're on the air.
- Check.

11
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:39,556
That guard nearest to you
is moving away.

12
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:50,324
He's at the service door.
He's inside.

13
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:32,086
Have you seen Khaled yet?

14
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:36,198
Yep, there he is.

15
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:38,403
How come billionaires
are always short?

16
00:05:43,487 --> 00:05:44,966
Excuse me.

17
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:46,719
Thank you.

18
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:52,243
Colonel! How are you?

19
00:05:52,327 --> 00:05:55,239
- It's so good to see you again.
- Yes, it's been a long time.

20
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,318
- Terrific.
- Who was that guy?

21
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:01,877
Could you hold this
for a second? Thanks.

22
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:06,846
You should be crossing the main foyer,
heading for the stairs.

23
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:14,437
Keep moving. Keep moving.

24
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:27,836
I'm in the library, heading out
to the second-floor balcony.

25
00:07:20,087 --> 00:07:24,046
Modem in place.
Transmitting now.

26
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:25,401
Affirmatory.

27
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,126
It's a good hook-up.

28
00:07:28,207 --> 00:07:31,995
These are encrypted files.
It's going to take me a few minutes.

29
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,803
I got your password.

30
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:17,640
- Magnificent, isn't it?
- Yes, quite.

31
00:08:17,727 --> 00:08:21,242
I thought I knew Khaled's friends,
but I don't believe I've met you before.

32
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:24,000
We haven't met,
because I certainly would remember.

33
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,317
Renquist, Harry Renquist.

34
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:30,045
-Juno Skinner.
-Juno Skinner.

35
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:33,600
Come on!

36
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:36,038
""Juno Skinner,
arts and antiquities dealer...

37
00:08:36,127 --> 00:08:38,436
specializing in ancient Persia.""

38
00:08:38,527 --> 00:08:41,166
This is Persian,
if I'm not mistaken.

39
00:08:41,247 --> 00:08:45,206
Very good.
Sixth century BC, to be exact.

40
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:48,723
- Do you like the period?
- I adore it.

41
00:08:56,967 --> 00:09:00,755
We got a problem.
Guards are going apeshit down there.

42
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:02,719
Acquired most of these pieces
for Jamal.

43
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:06,636
Do you tango?

44
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:08,401
Tango?

45
00:09:08,487 --> 00:09:12,116
Harry, you do not have time
to tango, buddy.

46
00:09:12,207 --> 00:09:14,198
You copy?

47
00:09:59,647 --> 00:10:02,798
Don't be stopping to smell
the roses now. You hear me?

48
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:05,959
- You gotta get out of there.
- Yes! Files are unlocked!

49
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:08,561
Fast Faisil strikes again.
I'm in. I'm down, baby.

50
00:10:08,647 --> 00:10:11,115
I got my hand up her dress,
and I am going for the gold--

51
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:12,959
Just copy the goddam files, okay?

52
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:44,319
Wow. And I thought
this was just gonna be...

53
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:47,365
another bunch of boring bankers
and oil billionaires.

54
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,166
Seconds count.
Ditch the bitch.

55
00:10:50,247 --> 00:10:53,557
Unfortunately, I have to leave.

56
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:55,638
I have a plane to catch.

57
00:10:57,767 --> 00:11:01,760
Well, call me sometime.

58
00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:03,963
My offices are in Rome.

59
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:06,003
I would like that.

60
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:16,205
Son of a bitch is with her two minutes,
and she's ready to bear his children.

61
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:18,557
Twinkletoes,
what's your exit strategy?

62
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:20,922
I'm going to walk
right out of the front gate.

63
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:23,441
Ballsy. Stupid, but ballsy.

64
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:32,957
Sir, may I see
your invitation, please?

65
00:11:33,047 --> 00:11:35,720
Sure. Here is my invitation.

66
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:44,878
Shit. Here we go.

67
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:46,480
Slight change in plans.

68
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:05,205
Stay!

69
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,637
We're en route to
the lower rendezvous point.

70
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:28,285
Repeat, back-up rendezvous point!

71
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:33,516
- Watch it!
- It's called ice, and it's slick.

72
00:12:50,327 --> 00:12:53,046
- Harry, do you copy? Whoa!
- I got it.

73
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:55,437
Shit!

74
00:12:56,687 --> 00:12:57,756
Whoops!

75
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,800
Oh, my God!

76
00:13:42,887 --> 00:13:44,923
Whoa! I got it!
I got it! I got it!

77
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:48,516
- There he is!
- Shit!

78
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,558
Hi, guys.

79
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,279
That worked good.
Right out the old front gate.

80
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:58,278
Can you lean back a second?

81
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:02,287
Let's go.
We can still make our flight.

82
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:18,924
All right, that's it
for Mr Renquist. Okay, go.

83
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:24,400
We got Harry Tasker billfold,
Harry Tasker passport, ticket stub.

84
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:27,638
Hotel bill, Tasker.
I got two postcards here from Geneva.

85
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:31,357
Got some house keys right there...

86
00:14:31,447 --> 00:14:34,757
and I've got a souvenir
Swiss snowing village.

87
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:37,042
- What's that for?
- It's for Dana, stupe.

88
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,402
Bring your kid home a gift,
the dad thing.

89
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:40,602
Nice touch.

90
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:44,202
- Pick me up tomorrow at 8:00.
- Will do.

91
00:14:46,607 --> 00:14:48,996
The debriefing is at 1 000.

92
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:52,039
- See you at 8:00. Bye.
- Hey, Harry.

93
00:14:52,127 --> 00:14:54,402
Did you forget something?

94
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:58,082
What a team.

95
00:14:58,167 --> 00:15:00,362
Sleep fast, buddy.

96
00:15:37,207 --> 00:15:40,756
Hi, honey. How was your flight?

97
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:44,397
- It was fine.
- Good.

98
00:15:58,327 --> 00:16:02,161
Brought you a little gift
from Switzerland. Snowy village.

99
00:16:02,247 --> 00:16:04,966
Wow. Thanks, Dad.

100
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,436
- I've never had one of these.
- You're welcome.

101
00:16:07,527 --> 00:16:09,483
You're late for school.
You better get going.

102
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:12,525
- Don't forget to feed Gizmo.
- Okay.

103
00:16:12,607 --> 00:16:15,075
It's pretty lame.

104
00:16:21,407 --> 00:16:23,204
- I'm late.
- Yeah, me too.

105
00:16:23,287 --> 00:16:26,597
How'd it go at the convention?
Make all the other salesmen jealous?

106
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:29,360
It was fantastic.
You wouldn't believe it.

107
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,961
You should have been there.
We were the big hit of the show.

108
00:16:32,047 --> 00:16:35,403
With that new model ordering system,
the 680 I told you about...

109
00:16:35,487 --> 00:16:37,682
I can write up an order
and immediately...

110
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:41,362
as soon as the customer's name comes up,
you see what his credit line is...

111
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:44,723
what he has ordered in the past,
what discount he has gotten.

112
00:16:44,807 --> 00:16:47,401
- Every little detail.
- Sounds great.

113
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:50,160
It's fantastic. That's why
I love the computer business.

114
00:16:50,247 --> 00:16:52,158
Listen, the plumber called.

115
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:56,559
He says he has to dig under the slab
or something that's gonna cost $600.

116
00:16:56,647 --> 00:16:59,923
- That's okay.
- It's not okay. It's extortion.

117
00:17:00,007 --> 00:17:01,918
What did you tell him?

118
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:05,283
I slept with him and
he said he'd knock off $ 1 00.

119
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:07,722
That's good thinking.
Bye, honey.

120
00:17:11,287 --> 00:17:13,005
Hello!

121
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:45,685
Boy, I remember the first time
I got shot out of a cannon.

122
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:48,679
- Good morning. Go to school.
- Yeah, I am.

123
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:54,286
Thanks, dear.

124
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:56,198
Check these out.

125
00:17:56,287 --> 00:17:57,606
Check them out.

126
00:17:57,687 --> 00:17:59,917
Where's the image coming from?

127
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:03,556
Got a CCD camera and a transmitter
in a pack of smokes out there.

128
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,558
It's pretty cool, huh?

129
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:10,085
What the hell?

130
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:18,236
Bye, Dad!

131
00:18:19,287 --> 00:18:22,199
- She's ripping you off.
- I knew it.

132
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:28,683
Let's go!

133
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:30,837
Can't stop! I'm late! Bye, Dad!

134
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,438
God. Shit.

135
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:38,525
Kids. Ten seconds ofjoy,
30 years of misery.

136
00:18:38,607 --> 00:18:41,280
I got married three times, but at least
I was never dumb enough to have any.

137
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:44,677
She shouldn't be stealing.
I taught her better than that.

138
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:46,678
You're not her parents any more,
you and Helen.

139
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:48,917
Her parents are
Axl Rose and Madonna.

140
00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:52,556
Five minutes a day you spend with her
can't compete with that bombardment.

141
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:54,160
You're outgunned, Daddy-o.

142
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:57,283
It's not just
because you're a bad parent.

143
00:18:57,367 --> 00:18:59,801
Kids today are ten years ahead
of where we were at the same age.

144
00:18:59,887 --> 00:19:01,798
- Morning.
- Morning, Mr Tasker.

145
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:04,003
- I bet you think she's still a virgin.
- Don't be ridiculous.

146
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:06,043
- She's only-- What is she now?
- She's 1 4.

147
00:19:06,127 --> 00:19:09,278
- She's only 1 4.
- Her hormones are going like an alarm.

148
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:11,437
It's even money she lets that physicist
on the bike boink her.

149
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:13,279
- Not Dana.
- ""Not Dana.""

150
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:16,006
Denial. It's not just a river
in Egypt no more, is it?

151
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:18,601
She's probably stealing the money
to pay for an abortion.

152
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:21,076
Why don't you open the door?

153
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:22,998
Or drugs.

154
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:28,759
Twenty here, 50 there. I figured
my wife's boyfriend was taking it.

155
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:31,839
He takes everything else. There's
never a beer in the goddam fridge.

156
00:19:31,927 --> 00:19:34,202
- Thought you moved out.
- I had to move back in.

157
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:37,040
My lawyer said it'd give me
a better shot at getting the house...

158
00:19:37,127 --> 00:19:39,721
during the property settlement,
but don't change the subject.

159
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:42,560
- You still owe me 200 bucks.
- Good morning, janice.

160
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:53,125
- Good morning.
- Identify yourselves to the scanner.

161
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:57,041
- Harry Tasker, 1 0024.
- Albert Gibson, 34991 .

162
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:13,883
All right, Frances. I don't believe
we need you any longer now. Thank you.

163
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:27,485
Sweet Jesus. You sure screwed
the pooch last night, didn't you?

164
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:32,516
Would you please tell me how I can see
this as anything but a total disaster?

165
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:34,723
""Total"" is a strong word.

166
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:36,798
There are different
degrees of totality.

167
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:40,084
It's a scale, really, with
a perfect mission on one end...

168
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:43,284
and then a total pooch screw
on the other, and we're more on this--

169
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,518
Faisil, you're new on Harry's team,
aren't you?

170
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:48,926
Yes.

171
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:54,161
So what makes you think the slack
I cut him in any way translates to you?

172
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,322
Let me show you what we got.

173
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:03,680
Jamal Khaled. We think he's dirty,
so we raid his private financial files.

174
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:08,485
One hundred million in wire transfers
from the Commerce Bank International.

175
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,365
Which is a front for certain countries
to finance terrorist activities.

176
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:14,086
That's why we think
something really big is going down.

177
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:16,203
We know that a week ago
four MIRV warheads were smuggled...

178
00:21:16,287 --> 00:21:18,323
out of the former
Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan.

179
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:22,320
We think Khaled's group bought the nukes
and is trying to bring them to US soil.

180
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:25,604
So far this is not
blowing my skirt up, gentlemen.

181
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:29,202
Don't you have anything
remotely substantial?

182
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:32,199
Harry, do you have any hard data?

183
00:21:32,287 --> 00:21:35,836
- Nothing you would call rock-hard.
- Actually it's pretty limp, sir.

184
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,246
Then perhaps you better get some...

185
00:21:37,327 --> 00:21:39,921
before somebody parks an automobile
in front of the White House...

186
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,805
with a nuclear weapon in the trunk.

187
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:45,355
It's not like
he's saving the world or anything.

188
00:21:45,447 --> 00:21:47,836
He's a sales rep, for Christ's sake.

189
00:21:47,927 --> 00:21:50,999
Whenever I can't sleep,
I ask him to tell me about his day.

190
00:21:51,087 --> 00:21:53,237
Six seconds and I'm out.

191
00:21:53,327 --> 00:21:56,239
He acts like he's curing cancer
or something.

192
00:21:56,327 --> 00:21:58,522
I guess this means you didn't
get away for the weekend after all.

193
00:21:58,607 --> 00:22:00,962
- Harry had to go out of town.
- I'm shocked.

194
00:22:01,047 --> 00:22:03,038
Yeah, well, you know Harry.

195
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:08,804
- What's up?
- Check this out.

196
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:12,766
There's a $2 million disbursement
from Khaled to Juno Skinner.

197
00:22:12,847 --> 00:22:14,758
That's right.
The babe at the party.

198
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:20,523
That doesn't mean anything.
She buys antiquities for Khaled.

199
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:23,599
He keeps his antique buys
on a completely separate ledger.

200
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:26,201
This is a little above market rate
for the horizontal bop...

201
00:22:26,287 --> 00:22:28,437
even for a total biscuit
like her.

202
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:30,757
I want a complete workup on her.

203
00:22:30,847 --> 00:22:33,600
- Do we know where she is?
- Right here in River City.

204
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:36,440
She lives in Rome, but she does stuff
for the Smithsonian.

205
00:22:36,527 --> 00:22:39,405
She has a lot of diplomatic connections,
so she has offices here.

206
00:22:39,487 --> 00:22:41,876
I guess it's time
to send in a specialist.

207
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,320
- Care to tango?
- Yes, I would.

208
00:22:50,447 --> 00:22:52,244
Assholes.

209
00:22:56,127 --> 00:23:00,405
It's all set up. You got a fax machine,
ghost phones, all the usual stuff.

210
00:23:00,487 --> 00:23:04,162
You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel
under the name of Renquist.

211
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:06,283
Reality check. Let's go.

212
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:10,679
My name is Harry Renquist. I own
an art consulting firm in San Francisco.

213
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:12,758
I have an appointment
with Miss Skinner.

214
00:23:12,847 --> 00:23:14,963
- Harry!
- Hello.

215
00:23:15,047 --> 00:23:16,446
Hello.

216
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:19,519
I thought I'd see you again.
I just didn't know it would be so soon.

217
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:22,519
- What's the point of waiting?
- I agree.

218
00:23:24,927 --> 00:23:29,045
Your clients are looking for something
for the lobby of their new headquarters?

219
00:23:29,127 --> 00:23:31,163
They would like to see something
very dramatic.

220
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:33,203
That's a nice piece.

221
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:37,041
I talked to a number of people,
and they all said you're the one to see.

222
00:23:37,127 --> 00:23:39,960
Really? Checking on me.

223
00:23:40,047 --> 00:23:43,960
So what did these people
say about me exactly?

224
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:48,279
That you can read ancient Sanskrit
without having to sound out the words...

225
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:52,519
and other art dealers and archaeologists
don't like you very much.

226
00:23:53,487 --> 00:23:55,125
Those wimps.

227
00:23:55,207 --> 00:23:59,325
It's because I use my diplomatic
contacts to export cultural treasures...

228
00:23:59,407 --> 00:24:02,399
from countries which tell them
to take a hike.

229
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:10,160
Most of our pieces
come from ancient Persia.

230
00:24:10,247 --> 00:24:15,037
Unfortunately, ancient Persia is 20 feet
under the sand of Iran, Iraq and Syria.

231
00:24:15,127 --> 00:24:17,721
Not the most popular places
lately.

232
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:22,561
So I've had to become an expert
in international diplomacy.

233
00:24:25,927 --> 00:24:27,201
Well, Mr Renquist?

234
00:24:28,687 --> 00:24:31,360
Do you see anything you like?

235
00:24:31,447 --> 00:24:33,597
Maybe.

236
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:37,441
Give me a break. I don't think
they bugged my tuna sandwich.

237
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:39,563
She's importing stuff
from all over the Mideast.

238
00:24:39,647 --> 00:24:41,478
She could be moving
money, guns, anything.

239
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:43,683
The second you left, we started
getting calls to the ghost numbers.

240
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:45,678
They were checking out
the Renquist front.

241
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:48,406
Let's step up the surveillance
and put on two more guys.

242
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:52,366
Maurizio, I said Saturday,
not Tuesday. Saturday.

243
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:59,478
Miss Skinner, may I have
a word with you, please?

244
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:12,682
Stupid, undisciplined bitch.

245
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:15,725
It's a good thing
you're paying me a lot of money.

246
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:20,766
Do you realize there are surveillance
teams watching this place right now?

247
00:25:20,847 --> 00:25:23,042
Your telephones are
almost certainly tapped.

248
00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:27,405
And you were busy laughing and flirting
like a whore with this Renquist--

249
00:25:27,487 --> 00:25:29,637
He checked out okay--

250
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:32,921
We do not tolerate mistakes.

251
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:39,278
What would you like me to do?

252
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:41,597
Find out where this Renquist is.

253
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:44,558
Hello, Tektel Systems.
Mr Tasker's office.

254
00:25:44,647 --> 00:25:47,207
Hi, Charlene? Hi, it's Helen.
Is he in?

255
00:25:47,287 --> 00:25:50,757
Harry's in a sales meeting, Mrs Tasker.
Let me try him in there. Hold, please.

256
00:25:51,847 --> 00:25:53,883
Relay, 1 0024.

257
00:25:55,407 --> 00:25:57,841
It's a patch from Tektel.

258
00:25:58,647 --> 00:26:00,558
It's Helen.

259
00:26:00,647 --> 00:26:03,207
Hello, honey. How are you?
What's going on?

260
00:26:03,287 --> 00:26:05,847
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you
in the middle of a meeting.

261
00:26:05,927 --> 00:26:08,646
It's just that Dana and I want to make
sure you were gonna be home by 8:00.

262
00:26:08,727 --> 00:26:10,922
We're going to a lot of trouble
for your big birthday.

263
00:26:11,007 --> 00:26:14,556
We just wanted to make sure
that you were gonna be home.

264
00:26:14,647 --> 00:26:16,717
Absolutely.
This time you can count on me.

265
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:18,126
- Promise?
- Trust me.

266
00:26:18,207 --> 00:26:19,925
- Great.
- Got to go. Bye.

267
00:26:20,007 --> 00:26:20,917
Bye.

268
00:26:21,007 --> 00:26:24,044
- That's disgusting, Dana.
- Calm down.

269
00:26:26,407 --> 00:26:30,241
We got a friend.
Three cars back on the inside lane.

270
00:26:30,327 --> 00:26:33,444
They've been on us
since we left the hotel.

271
00:26:33,527 --> 00:26:35,438
- You mean the station wagon?
- Yes.

272
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:39,440
- You want me to lose them?
- No. We need this lead.

273
00:26:39,527 --> 00:26:40,516
Unit Seven?

274
00:26:42,087 --> 00:26:43,236
Seven here.

275
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:45,716
We need you at the Georgetown Mall
in three minutes.

276
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:49,197
- Copy. We're rolling.
- Helen's gonna be pissed.

277
00:26:49,847 --> 00:26:52,156
This is the problem with terrorists.

278
00:26:52,247 --> 00:26:55,159
They're really inconsiderate
when it comes to people's schedules.

279
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:07,197
Pull over here. This is good.

280
00:27:11,527 --> 00:27:14,678
- Okay, testing, one, two, three.
- I got you. I got you. I got you.

281
00:27:18,807 --> 00:27:21,241
They're right with us.
I make three of them in the car.

282
00:27:32,407 --> 00:27:34,762
- Dickhead.
- Blow me.

283
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:52,882
I got a couple of them getting out
of the car and coming after you.

284
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:54,685
Think I'm blind?

285
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:58,601
You do look like Ray Charles.
So what's the plan?

286
00:27:58,687 --> 00:28:01,201
Just trying to get a closer look
at Beavis and Butt-head.

287
00:28:01,287 --> 00:28:04,563
- There's a third one still in the car.
- Stay on him.

288
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:29,163
Hi, Helen. Yeah, it's Gib.
Oh, not much.

289
00:28:29,247 --> 00:28:32,364
Listen, Harry forgot something
back at the office.

290
00:28:32,447 --> 00:28:35,564
You know Harry.

291
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,923
Yeah, Gib, I know Harry. Bye.

292
00:28:39,007 --> 00:28:40,326
Bye. See you soon.

293
00:28:41,407 --> 00:28:43,045
See?

294
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:25,366
I lost the third guy.

295
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:04,516
Shit!

296
00:30:09,287 --> 00:30:13,200
Shit! Hold it! Shit!

297
00:31:01,287 --> 00:31:03,801
Here. Cool off.

298
00:32:18,447 --> 00:32:20,961
Sorry about this.

299
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:28,000
Look out! Get out of the way!

300
00:32:33,727 --> 00:32:35,638
Hey! Freeze!

301
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:45,998
Oh, thank God.

302
00:33:02,687 --> 00:33:04,643
Get in the car.

303
00:33:10,127 --> 00:33:11,526
Here we go.

304
00:33:32,447 --> 00:33:34,642
Federal officer
in pursuit of suspect.

305
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:40,045
Sorry.

306
00:33:53,847 --> 00:33:57,283
- Harry, what's your 20?
- Westbound in the park.

307
00:33:57,367 --> 00:34:00,006
Suspect is on a motorcycle,
and he's coming out on Franklin.

308
00:34:00,087 --> 00:34:00,724
Copy!

309
00:34:00,807 --> 00:34:03,605
I want you on 1 4th
in case he turns south.

310
00:34:03,687 --> 00:34:06,360
I want Seven on the north side
to box him in.

311
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:11,080
Make it quick, because
my horse is getting tired.

312
00:34:11,847 --> 00:34:12,962
Your horse?

313
00:34:29,327 --> 00:34:32,046
- There he is! That's him!
- Come on!

314
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:48,039
- Go around to the back.
- Copy that.

315
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:52,796
Out of my way!

316
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:04,761
Out of my way!

317
00:35:05,847 --> 00:35:07,041
Sorry.

318
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:09,206
Excuse me.

319
00:35:18,287 --> 00:35:20,118
-Jesus!
- Sorry.

320
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:23,198
Open it!

321
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:27,956
Excuse me. Excuse me.

322
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:41,122
Out of the way!

323
00:35:48,367 --> 00:35:49,959
Move! Move! Move!

324
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:55,437
Federal officer! Get down! Now!
Get off or die!

325
00:35:57,127 --> 00:35:58,640
- Get down! Now!
- Move!

326
00:36:01,207 --> 00:36:03,323
Turn around! Hold still!

327
00:36:03,407 --> 00:36:05,204
Come on!

328
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:12,601
Whoa!

329
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:19,918
Hold still!

330
00:36:30,847 --> 00:36:32,803
Will you press the button
for the top floor, please?

331
00:36:34,407 --> 00:36:35,681
Thank you.

332
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:41,797
Help!

333
00:36:41,887 --> 00:36:43,605
Shut up!

334
00:36:45,687 --> 00:36:46,756
Whoa.

335
00:36:46,847 --> 00:36:49,566
Say something.

336
00:36:49,647 --> 00:36:51,842
That's a fine animal.

337
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,116
Stay against the glass!

338
00:37:13,207 --> 00:37:14,401
Come on.

339
00:37:14,487 --> 00:37:16,125
So sorry.

340
00:37:19,527 --> 00:37:22,041
Stay there! Don't move!

341
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:46,237
Come on, come on, come on!

342
00:38:35,687 --> 00:38:38,759
Okay, back up.

343
00:38:38,847 --> 00:38:40,166
Back up.

344
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,843
You can do it.
Come on.

345
00:38:46,927 --> 00:38:48,565
Good horse. Good.

346
00:38:48,647 --> 00:38:51,036
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, go back now.

347
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:53,118
Come on.
Yeah, that's teamwork now.

348
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:55,323
Keep pulling. Come on.

349
00:38:56,727 --> 00:38:59,287
A little bit more.

350
00:39:00,287 --> 00:39:01,686
That a boy.

351
00:39:05,687 --> 00:39:07,405
Okay.

352
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,956
What the hell were you thinking?

353
00:39:20,807 --> 00:39:23,958
I had the guy,
and you let him get away.

354
00:39:24,047 --> 00:39:27,926
Look at me when I talk to you.
What kind of a cop are you anyway?

355
00:39:47,447 --> 00:39:49,165
Hi, honey.

356
00:39:52,967 --> 00:39:56,039
I know you're upset.
I'm sorry.

357
00:39:57,367 --> 00:39:59,722
I hurried home
as fast as I could.

358
00:40:02,887 --> 00:40:04,605
It's okay.

359
00:40:05,887 --> 00:40:07,605
It's okay.

360
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:11,158
I'm sorry.

361
00:40:11,247 --> 00:40:13,442
Thank you for the party.

362
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:15,882
Yeah, it was great.

363
00:40:29,687 --> 00:40:31,120
Hey.

364
00:40:34,447 --> 00:40:35,641
That's him.

365
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:39,686
- Pause it right there.
- Salim Abu Aziz.

366
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:42,520
This guy is really hard-core.
Highly fanatical.

367
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,917
The man's a real psycho. He's been
linked to dozens of car bombings.

368
00:40:46,007 --> 00:40:49,522
You know that cafe bomb
in Rome last year? That was his.

369
00:40:50,807 --> 00:40:53,526
As well as a 72 7 out of Lisbon.
This guy's a major player.

370
00:40:53,607 --> 00:40:56,917
Now he's formed his own splinter faction
called Crimson Jihad.

371
00:40:57,007 --> 00:41:00,602
I guess he thought the other terrorists
were too warm and fuzzy for him.

372
00:41:00,687 --> 00:41:03,281
- They call him the Sand Spider.
- Why?

373
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:05,517
Probably because it sounds scary.

374
00:41:05,607 --> 00:41:08,041
This is impressive, gentlemen.

375
00:41:08,127 --> 00:41:11,881
It would be even more impressive
if you actually knew where he was.

376
00:41:12,647 --> 00:41:13,966
We'll get him.

377
00:41:14,527 --> 00:41:17,963
- Why don't you pull over here?
- What's up?

378
00:41:18,047 --> 00:41:21,005
I really screwed up
with Helen last night.

379
00:41:23,527 --> 00:41:28,237
I'm going to see if she's available
for lunch to smooth things over.

380
00:41:28,327 --> 00:41:30,602
- You just want me to hang?
-Just hang.

381
00:41:30,687 --> 00:41:32,166
I'll just be hanging.

382
00:41:38,007 --> 00:41:39,440
Hold, please.

383
00:41:41,527 --> 00:41:44,166
- It's your mystery man on two.
- Simon?

384
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:47,395
Oh, my God.

385
00:41:51,727 --> 00:41:53,126
Hello? Simon?

386
00:41:53,207 --> 00:41:54,959
Simon?

387
00:41:55,767 --> 00:41:57,564
Yes, I can talk.

388
00:42:00,247 --> 00:42:02,841
You mean right now?

389
00:42:02,927 --> 00:42:04,963
Yes, I can meet you.

390
00:42:05,727 --> 00:42:08,287
Okay, I can't wait.

391
00:42:08,367 --> 00:42:09,402
Bye.

392
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:12,278
Can you cover me for an hour?

393
00:42:12,367 --> 00:42:14,881
Just an hour? You should tell
that stud to take more time.

394
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:18,676
Would you shut up?
I should have never told you about him.

395
00:42:21,487 --> 00:42:22,556
Have a good time.

396
00:42:23,967 --> 00:42:26,356
Get a little bit for me
while you're at it.

397
00:42:35,807 --> 00:42:38,241
Hey! Hold it! Fucker!

398
00:42:38,327 --> 00:42:40,283
What's going on? Sick?

399
00:42:40,367 --> 00:42:42,756
Looks like you got gut-kicked.

400
00:42:42,847 --> 00:42:47,079
It's Hel-- It's Helen--
It's Helen.

401
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,442
It has something to do with Helen,
I'm guessing.

402
00:42:52,927 --> 00:42:54,724
Helen...

403
00:42:54,807 --> 00:42:56,763
is having an affair.

404
00:43:00,927 --> 00:43:03,487
Welcome to the club, man.

405
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:05,159
It can't be. Not Helen.

406
00:43:05,247 --> 00:43:07,363
Nobody thinks it could happen to them
the first time.

407
00:43:07,447 --> 00:43:10,200
Same thing happened to me
with wife number two, remember?

408
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:13,643
I had no idea nothing was going on.
I come home, and the house is empty.

409
00:43:13,727 --> 00:43:17,083
She even took the ice cube trays
out of the freezer.

410
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:22,560
What kind of a sick bitch takes
the ice cube trays out of the freezer?

411
00:43:23,487 --> 00:43:27,196
- It's not Helen.
- Helen still loves you.

412
00:43:27,287 --> 00:43:30,996
She just wants to bang this guy
for a while. It's nothing serious.

413
00:43:31,087 --> 00:43:34,284
- You'll get used to it soon--
- Stop cheering me up!

414
00:43:37,327 --> 00:43:39,079
What'd you expect?

415
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:41,397
Helen's a flesh-and-blood woman,
and you're never there.

416
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:44,397
It was just a matter of time.

417
00:43:50,967 --> 00:43:53,481
I say we concentrate on work.

418
00:43:53,567 --> 00:43:55,876
That's what I do every time
my life turns to dog shit.

419
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,003
I concentrate on work,
and that gets me by.

420
00:43:58,087 --> 00:44:00,555
Right, buddy?
It's gonna be great.

421
00:44:00,647 --> 00:44:03,002
We're gonna catch some terrorists.
We're gonna beat the crap out of them.

422
00:44:03,087 --> 00:44:05,157
You're going to feel a hell
of a lot better.

423
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:08,000
Watch your head.
Okay. All right.

424
00:44:14,767 --> 00:44:18,282
Women. Can't live with 'em,
can't kill 'em.

425
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,958
I came by your office today.

426
00:44:38,207 --> 00:44:40,926
I was in the area, and I thought
you might want to have lunch.

427
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:45,757
Really? Well,
you must have just missed me.

428
00:44:47,007 --> 00:44:49,521
That's what they said. They said
you had to run out or something.

429
00:44:49,607 --> 00:44:52,326
It was this rush job--

430
00:44:52,407 --> 00:44:56,286
They needed these documents
down at the district courthouse.

431
00:44:56,367 --> 00:44:59,564
So, of course, the big problem--
our printer shut down.

432
00:44:59,647 --> 00:45:03,606
So I went to the third floor
to use theirs, but they have the 1 720.

433
00:45:03,687 --> 00:45:07,077
Of course, the disk
isn't formatted for the 1 720.

434
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:09,886
So I had to go back upstairs
and reformat...

435
00:45:09,967 --> 00:45:12,276
go back downstairs
and use their printer.

436
00:45:12,367 --> 00:45:14,927
By the time I got there,
I couldn't get my car to start.

437
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:17,999
Then traffic--
I barely got there.

438
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:25,604
So a little excitement
in an otherwise dull day.

439
00:45:25,687 --> 00:45:27,245
Did it work out okay?

440
00:45:29,007 --> 00:45:30,963
Yeah. Great.

441
00:45:32,847 --> 00:45:34,758
I'll check on dessert.

442
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,758
I'm done.

443
00:45:42,087 --> 00:45:45,238
The great thing is that he's practically
given us a blank cheque on wiretaps.

444
00:45:45,327 --> 00:45:48,160
I set them up on all of Juno's
shipping agents and her clients.

445
00:45:48,247 --> 00:45:50,238
Faisil's made a list
of all the possible contacts...

446
00:45:50,327 --> 00:45:52,238
the Crimson Jihad
may have in this country.

447
00:45:52,327 --> 00:45:54,477
Now all we have
to do is sit around--

448
00:45:57,927 --> 00:46:01,317
Hey. This national security stuff
boring you?

449
00:46:01,407 --> 00:46:04,717
- Put a tap on her phone.
- What? I already did that.

450
00:46:04,807 --> 00:46:08,846
I'm talking about Helen's. Put a tap
on her office line and the house. Now.

451
00:46:08,927 --> 00:46:11,680
Come over here for a second.
That sounds great.

452
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:14,565
I want to ask you about something.
I got two words to describe that idea--

453
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:17,639
In-sane. An unauthorized wiretap's
a felony. You know that.

454
00:46:17,727 --> 00:46:21,640
And you're doing it 20 times a day,
so don't give me that crap.

455
00:46:21,727 --> 00:46:23,126
Do it.

456
00:46:34,967 --> 00:46:38,198
- Hello?
- Helen, it's Simon. Is it safe to talk?

457
00:46:38,287 --> 00:46:40,676
Yes, go ahead.

458
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:43,406
I can't talk long. Can you meet me
for lunch tomorrow? I must see you.

459
00:46:44,327 --> 00:46:46,602
I suppose so. Where?

460
00:46:46,687 --> 00:46:51,397
Same place, 1 :00.
I have to go now. See you tomorrow.

461
00:46:51,487 --> 00:46:53,717
Remember, I need you.

462
00:47:12,167 --> 00:47:15,000
I thought that we might
have lunch together tomorrow.

463
00:47:16,487 --> 00:47:19,365
You know-- darn it--

464
00:47:19,447 --> 00:47:23,326
I'm going to meet Allison.
We're going to go shopping. Sorry.

465
00:47:24,327 --> 00:47:26,045
No problem.

466
00:48:00,847 --> 00:48:03,156
I think you're going about
this whole thing all wrong.

467
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:05,283
Women-- they like you
to talk to them.

468
00:48:05,367 --> 00:48:07,881
Maybe it's just that you're not
in touch with your feminine side.

469
00:48:07,967 --> 00:48:11,516
I was watching Sally jessy Raphael--
All right.

470
00:48:11,607 --> 00:48:14,360
I got all the usual stuff here--
a telemetry burst transmitter.

471
00:48:14,447 --> 00:48:17,359
I got a GPS tracker, an audio
transmitter and a power supply.

472
00:48:17,447 --> 00:48:21,440
I've got it sewn into the lining here--
Hey, Harry?

473
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:24,360
If you need to talk,
speak into the purse.

474
00:48:28,847 --> 00:48:31,805
Here she comes. She's gonna pop out
right in front of us. Watch this.

475
00:48:31,887 --> 00:48:33,605
Bingo.

476
00:48:37,607 --> 00:48:39,757
Looks like she's going
into Chinatown.

477
00:48:43,527 --> 00:48:44,755
She's parking.

478
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:55,486
Okay, give me audio.

479
00:49:02,847 --> 00:49:04,917
You sure you weren't followed?

480
00:49:06,927 --> 00:49:10,476
No. I kept looking behind me like
you taught me, but I didn't see anyone.

481
00:49:10,567 --> 00:49:12,762
Okay, it's just that things
are a bit hot right now.

482
00:49:12,847 --> 00:49:17,045
If I get a signal,
I may have to leave suddenly.

483
00:49:17,127 --> 00:49:18,560
I understand.

484
00:49:22,807 --> 00:49:26,004
Look, it's my job to take risks,
but not yours.

485
00:49:26,087 --> 00:49:30,399
I feel bad about bringing you into this,
but you're the only one I can trust.

486
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:33,725
Were you out on a mission?

487
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:40,921
We say ""op,"" covert operation.
And this one, well, got a little rough.

488
00:49:41,007 --> 00:49:43,316
- Worse than Cairo?
- Cairo.

489
00:49:44,687 --> 00:49:47,645
Cairo was a day at the beach
next to this.

490
00:49:47,727 --> 00:49:50,719
- The guy's a spook.
- But for whom?

491
00:49:50,807 --> 00:49:52,798
He could be working her
to get to you.

492
00:49:53,487 --> 00:49:56,797
- Did you read the papers yesterday?
- Yes.

493
00:50:01,327 --> 00:50:04,603
Sometimes a story is a mask
for a covert operation.

494
00:50:04,687 --> 00:50:07,155
You see two men killed in a restroom
and two unidentified men...

495
00:50:07,247 --> 00:50:09,841
in a running shootout,
ending at the Marriott?

496
00:50:09,927 --> 00:50:11,440
That was you?

497
00:50:11,527 --> 00:50:12,926
- Me.
- You're very good.

498
00:50:13,007 --> 00:50:14,235
You recognized my style.

499
00:50:14,327 --> 00:50:16,841
You're a natural at this.

500
00:50:16,927 --> 00:50:19,157
The guy's a fake.
He's taking credit for our moves.

501
00:50:19,247 --> 00:50:21,681
- What happened?
- Hardly worth talking about.

502
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:24,398
Two of them
won't bother me again.

503
00:50:24,487 --> 00:50:27,797
- Unbelievable.
- You chased one?

504
00:50:27,887 --> 00:50:31,675
Something came over me. I had to nail
this guy no matter what the risk.

505
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:34,406
Pretty hairy. I thought
he had me a couple of times, but I--

506
00:50:34,487 --> 00:50:37,923
- I really can't take credit.
- Why not?

507
00:50:38,727 --> 00:50:41,366
It's the training. It shapes you
into a lethal instrument.

508
00:50:41,447 --> 00:50:43,358
You react in a microsecond
without thinking.

509
00:50:43,447 --> 00:50:46,439
I'm starting to like this guy.

510
00:50:46,527 --> 00:50:49,837
We still gotta kill him.
That's a given, you know.

511
00:51:14,967 --> 00:51:17,083
The guy is a goddamned
used car salesman.

512
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:19,806
This keeps getting better and better!

513
00:51:21,167 --> 00:51:23,556
I'm sorry.
I know this has gotta be painful.

514
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:26,320
But you gotta admit it's funny.
If it was just some idiot, not you...

515
00:51:26,407 --> 00:51:28,637
you'd be laughing your ass off.

516
00:51:29,647 --> 00:51:31,638
One born every minute.

517
00:51:32,687 --> 00:51:36,316
It wants you too.
Feel it vibrate?

518
00:51:36,407 --> 00:51:38,967
- Say, how about a little spin?
- Sure.

519
00:51:41,327 --> 00:51:44,205
See, it's not just a car.
It's a total image. An identity.

520
00:51:44,287 --> 00:51:47,006
You have to go for it.
This isn't some high-tech sports car.

521
00:51:47,087 --> 00:51:49,806
To tell you the truth,
it doesn't even handle that great.

522
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,878
But that's not the idea, is it?

523
00:51:51,967 --> 00:51:54,765
What are we talking about here?
Pussy, right?

524
00:51:56,487 --> 00:51:58,478
Absolutely.

525
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:04,558
Let's face it.
The 'Vette gets 'em wet.

526
00:52:04,647 --> 00:52:06,797
But it's not enough.

527
00:52:07,927 --> 00:52:11,124
If you really want to close escrow,
you gotta have an angle.

528
00:52:12,367 --> 00:52:14,005
I suppose you have an angle.

529
00:52:14,087 --> 00:52:15,839
It's killer.

530
00:52:15,927 --> 00:52:18,839
I mean, look at me.
I'm not that much to look at.

531
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,963
No, no, no.
I can be honest.

532
00:52:21,047 --> 00:52:24,483
But I got 'em lining up,
and not just the skanks either.

533
00:52:24,567 --> 00:52:26,558
- Well, some are.
- What's your angle?

534
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,960
No, sorry. Trade secret.

535
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:33,880
Okay, just ask yourself:

536
00:52:33,967 --> 00:52:35,878
What do women really want?

537
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,765
You take these bored housewives
married to the same guy for years.

538
00:52:38,847 --> 00:52:40,838
They're stuck in a rut.
They need some release.

539
00:52:40,927 --> 00:52:43,361
The promise of adventure,
a hint of danger.

540
00:52:44,367 --> 00:52:46,437
I create that for them.

541
00:52:46,527 --> 00:52:48,836
So basically you're lying
your ass off the whole time.

542
00:52:48,927 --> 00:52:51,885
- I couldn't do that.
- What are you, a Boy Scout?

543
00:52:51,967 --> 00:52:53,878
Think of it as playing a role.
It's fantasy.

544
00:52:53,967 --> 00:52:55,844
You gotta work on their dreams...

545
00:52:55,927 --> 00:52:59,476
get them out of their daily
suburban grind for a few hours.

546
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:01,558
- What about their husbands?
- Dickless!

547
00:53:01,647 --> 00:53:04,798
I mean, let's face it.
If they took care of business...

548
00:53:04,887 --> 00:53:07,321
I'd be out of business,
you know what I mean?

549
00:53:07,407 --> 00:53:09,284
Those idiots.

550
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:13,558
You mind keeping it under 90?

551
00:53:13,647 --> 00:53:16,036
I'm still trying
to pay for this dental work.

552
00:53:16,127 --> 00:53:18,357
So, who are you
working on right now?

553
00:53:18,447 --> 00:53:20,517
I always got a couple on the hook.

554
00:53:20,607 --> 00:53:23,917
There's this one right now,
I got her panting like a dog.

555
00:53:24,007 --> 00:53:26,157
- It's great.
- What does she do?

556
00:53:26,247 --> 00:53:28,920
Some sort of legal secretary
or something.

557
00:53:29,007 --> 00:53:31,475
You know,
uptight and conservative.

558
00:53:31,567 --> 00:53:33,762
But she could be so hot
if she wanted to be.

559
00:53:33,847 --> 00:53:36,077
And with you,
she gets to be real hot.

560
00:53:36,167 --> 00:53:38,476
Red hot!
Her thighs steam.

561
00:53:38,567 --> 00:53:41,161
It's like a dying plant.
Just needs a little water.

562
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,886
- Married to some boring jerk.
- Some boring jerk?

563
00:53:43,967 --> 00:53:47,357
He doesn't appreciate her.
She's like all these babes.

564
00:53:47,447 --> 00:53:50,598
You get their pilot lit,
they can suck-start a leaf-blower.

565
00:53:51,647 --> 00:53:55,083
She's got the most incredible body,
and a pair of titties...

566
00:53:55,167 --> 00:53:57,635
make you want to stand up
and beg for buttermilk.

567
00:53:57,727 --> 00:53:59,718
Ass like a ten-year-old boy.

568
00:54:06,647 --> 00:54:09,764
So, then she must be
really good in bed then, huh?

569
00:54:09,847 --> 00:54:11,758
Slow down.
You'll miss the turn.

570
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:25,766
See?

571
00:54:25,847 --> 00:54:29,157
You and this car were made
for each other. Why fight it?

572
00:54:29,247 --> 00:54:32,523
Sure, I got a couple other buyers
on the line, but I like your style.

573
00:54:32,607 --> 00:54:34,643
So, what do you say?

574
00:54:34,727 --> 00:54:37,002
Should we start up
the paperwork?

575
00:54:37,087 --> 00:54:38,918
Let me think about it.

576
00:54:39,007 --> 00:54:40,918
Hold it for me for a day, okay?

577
00:54:42,767 --> 00:54:45,122
Hey, because it's you.

578
00:54:45,727 --> 00:54:48,195
I got today's transcripts.

579
00:54:48,287 --> 00:54:50,198
Not much going on.

580
00:54:51,847 --> 00:54:54,042
- Nothing from Simon?
- No.

581
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:07,798
- My turn to drive?
- Give me the page.

582
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,798
- What?
- This jumped from page 9 to 1 1 .

583
00:55:09,887 --> 00:55:11,798
- Where's page 1 0?
- It's gotta be a typo.

584
00:55:11,887 --> 00:55:13,798
Give me the goddam page!

585
00:55:23,047 --> 00:55:25,800
- Seek help, Harry.
- Hello?

586
00:55:25,887 --> 00:55:29,562
Helen, I need your help.
Can you meet me tonight?

587
00:55:29,647 --> 00:55:31,524
- What's happened?
- It's serious.

588
00:55:31,607 --> 00:55:33,677
Meet me on K Street...

589
00:55:33,767 --> 00:55:36,042
under the Key Bridge,
8:00 sharp.

590
00:55:38,647 --> 00:55:39,796
Gotcha.

591
00:55:40,727 --> 00:55:43,878
Shit. It's almost 8:00.

592
00:55:49,807 --> 00:55:51,923
She's still at the house.

593
00:55:52,007 --> 00:55:53,963
The purse is still at the house.

594
00:55:54,047 --> 00:55:55,526
Shit.

595
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:59,647
Unit Two, Unit Seven,
immediate roll.

596
00:55:59,727 --> 00:56:02,287
Acquire subject
at K Street and Key Bridge.

597
00:56:02,367 --> 00:56:05,803
Vehicle is red and white convertible.
You got exactly six minutes.

598
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,481
Wait a minute.
Are you out of your mind?

599
00:56:08,567 --> 00:56:11,923
You can't pull agents off a priority
surveillance to follow your wife.

600
00:56:12,007 --> 00:56:16,125
That's a misappropriation of resources
and a breach of national security.

601
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:18,641
You copy?
You're losing it big-time, man.

602
00:56:18,727 --> 00:56:21,446
- I have to stop you.
- What are you gonna do, tell?

603
00:56:21,527 --> 00:56:24,166
Look, goddam it.
Both of our butts are on the line.

604
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:27,557
So your life's in the crapper.
Your wife's banging a used car salesman.

605
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:30,684
It's humiliating, I know,
but take it like a man!

606
00:56:30,767 --> 00:56:33,327
- You tell on me, I tell on you.
- What are you talking about?

607
00:56:33,407 --> 00:56:36,240
I'm as clean as a preacher's sheets.
I'm as clean as--

608
00:56:36,327 --> 00:56:38,238
What about when you blew
a six-week operation...

609
00:56:38,327 --> 00:56:41,205
because you were busy
getting a blow-job?

610
00:56:41,287 --> 00:56:43,403
You knew about that?

611
00:56:45,127 --> 00:56:47,038
Let's take Franklin.
It's quicker.

612
00:57:14,007 --> 00:57:16,441
Quick, get in.
Hurry up. Let's go.

613
00:57:24,487 --> 00:57:26,682
Two here.
Suspect vehicle in sight.

614
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:28,678
One male, one female.

615
00:57:28,767 --> 00:57:31,361
Now, don't be alarmed.

616
00:57:31,447 --> 00:57:34,007
If I'm spotted, it'd be best
if they didn't see you.

617
00:57:34,087 --> 00:57:36,282
You should keep your head down
till we're out of the city.

618
00:57:38,847 --> 00:57:41,281
Here, let me help you.

619
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:43,679
That's better.

620
00:57:48,247 --> 00:57:50,283
Now the woman has her head
in the guy's lap.

621
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:53,279
Southbound on the Key Bridge.
Two in pursuit.

622
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:56,564
Roger, Two.
One to Condor, you got a visual?

623
00:57:58,727 --> 00:58:00,957
Roger, One. This is Condor.
Subject is in sight.

624
00:58:01,047 --> 00:58:03,083
Repeat.: We have the ball.

625
00:58:03,167 --> 00:58:06,079
We got a pretty good lockup
on infrared.

626
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:09,079
She's got her head
in the guy's lap, all right.

627
00:58:10,287 --> 00:58:12,721
Maybe she's sleepy.

628
00:58:16,407 --> 00:58:18,318
This is a safe house.

629
00:58:18,407 --> 00:58:21,046
My place in the city
is a little too hot right now.

630
00:58:21,127 --> 00:58:23,083
So is the penthouse in New York.

631
00:58:36,087 --> 00:58:38,078
What is it exactly
you need me to do?

632
00:58:40,287 --> 00:58:42,323
I want you to be my wife.

633
00:58:42,407 --> 00:58:44,318
But I'm married!

634
00:58:44,407 --> 00:58:48,639
It's just for the operation in Paris.
I need to be married.

635
00:58:48,727 --> 00:58:50,638
They'll be looking for a man
travelling alone.

636
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:53,605
You want me to go to Paris?

637
00:58:53,687 --> 00:58:56,121
Paris, with a quick stopover
in London.

638
00:59:00,487 --> 00:59:03,047
There's a double agent in my outfit.
I don't know who.

639
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:07,476
There's no one I can trust,
except you.

640
00:59:07,567 --> 00:59:09,478
Can you get away,
just for a couple of days?

641
00:59:09,567 --> 00:59:11,478
I just don't know.

642
00:59:11,567 --> 00:59:13,842
Of course. I'm rushing you.
Forgive me.

643
00:59:13,927 --> 00:59:16,202
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

644
00:59:18,047 --> 00:59:20,641
Let me pour you some more wine.

645
00:59:35,327 --> 00:59:39,115
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

646
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:43,523
You just saved my life.

647
00:59:43,607 --> 00:59:46,360
You are incredibly brave.

648
00:59:46,447 --> 00:59:50,122
I have to remind myself
of the fear you must be feeling.

649
00:59:50,207 --> 00:59:52,675
You see, for me
fear is not an option.

650
00:59:52,767 --> 00:59:56,601
Now, in order to pull
this cover story off...

651
00:59:56,687 --> 00:59:59,838
we have to look like two people who are
completely intimate with each other.

652
00:59:59,927 --> 01:00:01,838
The enemy can spot a fake easily.

653
01:00:06,847 --> 01:00:08,917
- You see what I mean?
- Sorry.

654
01:00:09,007 --> 01:00:10,918
That reaction could
get us both killed.

655
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:14,363
- I'm sorry.
- We can't afford that.

656
01:00:14,447 --> 01:00:16,039
Try to relax.

657
01:00:16,127 --> 01:00:18,083
It's just been a long time...

658
01:00:18,167 --> 01:00:20,442
since anybody but Harry's
touched me like that.

659
01:00:20,527 --> 01:00:22,961
- It's a little difficult.
- I know.

660
01:00:23,047 --> 01:00:25,720
- It's awkward for me too.
- I'm sorry.

661
01:00:25,807 --> 01:00:28,958
- That's all right.Just sit back.
- I'm okay.

662
01:00:29,647 --> 01:00:31,558
There. That's better.

663
01:00:32,807 --> 01:00:36,322
Just let yourself
slip into the role.

664
01:00:44,527 --> 01:00:47,166
That's it.

665
01:00:47,247 --> 01:00:49,158
There you go.

666
01:00:50,607 --> 01:00:53,246
Just let yourself go.

667
01:00:53,327 --> 01:00:54,680
That's good.

668
01:00:54,767 --> 01:00:56,485
That's great.

669
01:00:57,607 --> 01:00:59,006
That's it.

670
01:00:59,087 --> 01:01:01,521
No, I can't do this.
I can't do this.

671
01:01:01,607 --> 01:01:04,280
- What's wrong? It's okay.
- I cannot do this.

672
01:01:04,367 --> 01:01:05,766
I cannot do this!

673
01:01:09,767 --> 01:01:12,235
If not for me...

674
01:01:12,327 --> 01:01:14,238
do it for your country?

675
01:01:42,927 --> 01:01:45,202
Oh, God!
Don't hurt me!

676
01:01:45,287 --> 01:01:47,164
I'll do whatever you want!

677
01:01:48,527 --> 01:01:50,358
Please!
I didn't do anything!

678
01:01:59,047 --> 01:02:00,526
Damn it!

679
01:02:20,887 --> 01:02:24,323
Take her! Take her!
Oh, God, don't hurt me!

680
01:02:28,647 --> 01:02:31,241
Son of a bitch!

681
01:03:20,007 --> 01:03:21,998
Sit down.

682
01:03:24,447 --> 01:03:26,836
I said sit down.

683
01:03:30,967 --> 01:03:33,356
Who do you work for?

684
01:03:35,127 --> 01:03:39,484
Stern, Kessler,
Goldstein & Krumpnick.

685
01:03:39,567 --> 01:03:42,798
- I'm just a legal secretary.
- Sure, Mrs Tasker.

686
01:03:42,887 --> 01:03:45,401
What were you doing
with the international terrorist...

687
01:03:45,487 --> 01:03:47,557
Carlos thejackal,
taking dictation?

688
01:03:47,647 --> 01:03:50,320
How long have you been
a member of his faction?

689
01:03:50,407 --> 01:03:52,318
I don't know anything
about a faction.

690
01:03:54,487 --> 01:03:57,160
I just met Simon...

691
01:03:57,247 --> 01:03:59,920
or whoever you say he is...

692
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:01,918
just a couple weeks ago.

693
01:04:02,007 --> 01:04:03,520
I barely know him.

694
01:04:03,607 --> 01:04:05,518
That's not what it looked like
when we found you.

695
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:09,681
How did you meet him?

696
01:04:11,567 --> 01:04:13,046
Well--

697
01:04:23,927 --> 01:04:26,521
Keep this for me.
I can't afford to be taken with it.

698
01:04:26,607 --> 01:04:29,201
- What?
- It's a matter of national security.

699
01:04:29,287 --> 01:04:33,405
Please, it's important.
I'll contact you.

700
01:04:33,487 --> 01:04:35,398
Oh, shit.

701
01:05:06,087 --> 01:05:08,521
Why did you continue
to see him?

702
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,598
He said he needed my help.

703
01:05:10,687 --> 01:05:13,076
Not because you were
attracted to him?

704
01:05:14,447 --> 01:05:17,280
You were not attracted
to him at all?

705
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:26,521
Well, maybe just a little.

706
01:05:26,607 --> 01:05:29,883
-So, is cheating a common thing for you?
-Never.

707
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:32,959
So you're telling me
this was your first time?

708
01:05:33,047 --> 01:05:35,561
I wasn't cheating!

709
01:05:35,647 --> 01:05:37,842
Tell me about your husband,
Mrs Tasker.

710
01:05:45,527 --> 01:05:47,961
What can I say about Harry?

711
01:05:48,047 --> 01:05:50,163
He's a sales rep
for a computer company.

712
01:05:50,247 --> 01:05:54,081
So sex with him isn't exactly
waving your flag any more?

713
01:05:54,167 --> 01:05:57,682
That is none of your goddam business!
What kind of questions are these?

714
01:05:57,767 --> 01:06:00,406
You're in a lot of trouble,
so I suggest you cooperate.

715
01:06:00,487 --> 01:06:02,876
If we want to know the most
intimate details about your life...

716
01:06:02,967 --> 01:06:05,197
you'd better tell us.

717
01:06:07,847 --> 01:06:09,758
My husband is a good man.

718
01:06:09,847 --> 01:06:12,759
But he's not exactly ringing
your bell these days, is he?

719
01:06:12,847 --> 01:06:16,806
Let me handle this part.
Do you mind?

720
01:06:16,887 --> 01:06:19,799
Why did you go
to Carlos'hideout?

721
01:06:19,887 --> 01:06:22,685
He wanted me to go to Paris with him
on a mission...

722
01:06:22,767 --> 01:06:26,282
to pose as his wife.

723
01:06:26,367 --> 01:06:28,278
And you agreed?

724
01:06:30,447 --> 01:06:32,199
Why?

725
01:06:33,287 --> 01:06:36,120
I don't know.

726
01:06:36,207 --> 01:06:38,516
I guess I needed something.

727
01:06:39,367 --> 01:06:40,959
What did you need?

728
01:06:46,887 --> 01:06:49,526
I needed to feel alive.

729
01:06:52,127 --> 01:06:55,199
I just wanted to do
something outrageous.

730
01:06:58,887 --> 01:07:02,197
And it felt really good...

731
01:07:02,287 --> 01:07:04,198
to be needed.

732
01:07:08,127 --> 01:07:10,038
And to be trusted.

733
01:07:13,247 --> 01:07:16,080
And to be special.

734
01:07:16,167 --> 01:07:18,078
It's just that there's...

735
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:20,203
so much I wanted to do
with this life...

736
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:22,676
and it's like
I haven't done any of it.

737
01:07:22,767 --> 01:07:25,486
And the sand's running out
of the hourglass...

738
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:28,240
and I wanted to be able
to look back and say...

739
01:07:28,327 --> 01:07:30,795
""See? I did that!

740
01:07:30,887 --> 01:07:34,641
I was reckless and I was wild
and I fucking did it!''

741
01:07:40,567 --> 01:07:42,478
Quite frankly,
I don't give a shit...

742
01:07:42,567 --> 01:07:44,683
whether you understand that or not.

743
01:07:47,287 --> 01:07:48,606
This Simon...

744
01:07:51,687 --> 01:07:53,757
did you sleep with him?

745
01:07:54,927 --> 01:07:56,838
- No.
- She's lying.

746
01:07:59,607 --> 01:08:01,643
You did not have
sexual relations with him?

747
01:08:04,087 --> 01:08:07,079
Listen, if you're gonna ask me
every question twice...

748
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:10,876
this is gonna take a really long time,
and I have to get back to my family.

749
01:08:10,967 --> 01:08:13,276
You're not going anywhere, lady.

750
01:08:13,367 --> 01:08:16,200
Just let me out of here!

751
01:08:16,287 --> 01:08:18,039
Answer the question.

752
01:08:19,967 --> 01:08:22,845
- Answer the question!
- No!

753
01:08:22,927 --> 01:08:25,885
I did not...

754
01:08:25,967 --> 01:08:28,720
sleep with him!

755
01:08:28,807 --> 01:08:30,399
Calm down, please.

756
01:08:30,487 --> 01:08:33,684
You hear me,
you chickenshit bastard?

757
01:08:33,767 --> 01:08:36,645
- Calm down.
- She could be telling the truth.

758
01:08:36,727 --> 01:08:38,797
Calm down, Mrs Tasker.

759
01:08:40,807 --> 01:08:42,399
Calm down, please.

760
01:08:45,487 --> 01:08:49,196
I've only one more question,
Mrs Tasker.

761
01:08:49,287 --> 01:08:50,481
What?

762
01:08:52,767 --> 01:08:56,203
Do you still love your husband?

763
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:05,284
Yes, I love him.

764
01:09:05,367 --> 01:09:08,006
I've always loved him...

765
01:09:08,087 --> 01:09:10,282
and I will always love him.

766
01:09:15,567 --> 01:09:18,001
She loves you.
Now what?

767
01:09:22,007 --> 01:09:24,919
There's only one solution
to your problem, Mrs Tasker.

768
01:09:25,007 --> 01:09:26,918
You must work for us.

769
01:09:28,967 --> 01:09:30,844
What are you doing?

770
01:09:30,927 --> 01:09:33,316
-Just giving her a little assignment.
- You gotta be shitting me!

771
01:09:33,407 --> 01:09:36,717
She wants a little adventure,
so I'm gonna give her one.

772
01:09:36,807 --> 01:09:39,765
I'm offering you a choice.

773
01:09:39,847 --> 01:09:42,042
If you work for us,
we will drop the charges...

774
01:09:42,127 --> 01:09:44,516
and you can go back
to your normal life.

775
01:09:44,607 --> 01:09:47,440
If not, you will go
to a federal prison...

776
01:09:47,527 --> 01:09:51,884
and your husband and daughter
will be left humiliated and alone.

777
01:09:51,967 --> 01:09:54,083
Your life will be destroyed.

778
01:09:57,727 --> 01:10:01,276
Gee. Let me think.

779
01:10:01,367 --> 01:10:03,676
Yes or no?

780
01:10:03,767 --> 01:10:05,678
Of course yes.

781
01:10:05,767 --> 01:10:07,678
What's involved?

782
01:10:07,767 --> 01:10:10,076
You will be contacted
with the assignment.

783
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:13,159
The code name of your contact
will be Boris.

784
01:10:14,447 --> 01:10:16,165
Your code name will be--

785
01:10:16,247 --> 01:10:18,317
- Natasha?
- No.

786
01:10:19,967 --> 01:10:21,116
Doris.

787
01:10:32,487 --> 01:10:35,047
Pricks!

788
01:10:43,527 --> 01:10:46,360
You son of a bitch. Did you think
you could elude us forever, Carlos?

789
01:10:46,447 --> 01:10:49,086
Wait! You got the wrong guy.
My name's Simon.

790
01:10:49,167 --> 01:10:52,398
Just let me go.
There's no need to kill me.

791
01:10:52,487 --> 01:10:54,842
I haven't seen your face--

792
01:10:54,927 --> 01:10:56,838
Don't! I didn't see it!
I didn't see it!

793
01:11:01,287 --> 01:11:02,720
It's you!

794
01:11:02,807 --> 01:11:05,162
Hey, you still interested
in that 'Vette at all?

795
01:11:05,247 --> 01:11:07,238
Hey, Carlos.
The game's over.

796
01:11:07,327 --> 01:11:09,443
Your career as an international
terrorist is well documented.

797
01:11:09,527 --> 01:11:10,926
- No!
- Oh, yeah!

798
01:11:11,007 --> 01:11:13,441
I sell cars.
That's all!

799
01:11:13,527 --> 01:11:16,200
Come on.
I'm not a terrorist.

800
01:11:16,287 --> 01:11:20,439
I'm actually a complete coward.
If I ever saw a gun I'd-- Oh, God!

801
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:23,325
Oh, please, don't!
Don't kill me!

802
01:11:25,647 --> 01:11:28,241
I'm not a spy.

803
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:31,956
I'm nothing!
I'm navel lint!

804
01:11:32,047 --> 01:11:36,916
I have to lie to women to get laid.
And I don't score much.

805
01:11:37,847 --> 01:11:41,044
I got a little dick.
It's pathetic.

806
01:11:42,647 --> 01:11:43,966
Oh, God.

807
01:11:45,287 --> 01:11:48,916
Would a spy pee himself?
Huh?

808
01:11:50,687 --> 01:11:52,917
Please, I'm not worth a bullet.

809
01:11:53,007 --> 01:11:56,556
- Have mercy, sir.
- Get the fuck out of here.

810
01:11:56,647 --> 01:11:58,319
Just beat it.
Go on.

811
01:12:00,327 --> 01:12:02,397
As soon as I turn,
you're gonna shoot me!

812
01:12:02,487 --> 01:12:04,205
You're gonna shoot me!

813
01:12:04,287 --> 01:12:07,404
Please! You can have
the car for free.

814
01:12:07,487 --> 01:12:09,398
What do you say, huh?

815
01:12:10,887 --> 01:12:12,400
Get lost, dipshit.

816
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:34,480
So last night must've been
pretty exciting for you.

817
01:12:38,407 --> 01:12:40,159
My flat tyre?

818
01:12:40,247 --> 01:12:42,158
Actually, it was a little scary...

819
01:12:42,247 --> 01:12:45,159
because the tow truck driver
took such a long time.

820
01:12:52,207 --> 01:12:53,720
I'll get it.

821
01:12:55,687 --> 01:12:57,040
Hello?

822
01:12:57,127 --> 01:12:58,640
Doris?

823
01:13:02,887 --> 01:13:04,684
Yes?

824
01:13:06,527 --> 01:13:07,880
Listen carefully.

825
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,879
In exactly one hour,
go to the Hotel Marquis.

826
01:13:11,847 --> 01:13:14,645
Pick up an envelope marked ""Doris""
at the front desk...

827
01:13:14,727 --> 01:13:16,797
- and dress sexy.
- What?

828
01:13:20,327 --> 01:13:23,444
No, no.
Turn around.

829
01:13:23,527 --> 01:13:26,485
Do it doucement.

830
01:13:26,567 --> 01:13:28,444
Do it very slowly.

831
01:13:28,527 --> 01:13:30,643
You've reached a new
all-time low.

832
01:13:30,727 --> 01:13:32,797
I can't believe you're crazy enough
to use the suite at the Marquis.

833
01:13:32,887 --> 01:13:36,243
Do you think I can afford
a suite like this on my salary?

834
01:13:36,327 --> 01:13:38,238
- Is jean-Claude done yet?
- Hang on.

835
01:13:38,327 --> 01:13:40,238
Who wrote this shit? Harry?

836
01:13:43,287 --> 01:13:44,800
It's going great.

837
01:13:57,687 --> 01:13:59,996
Do you have an envelope for Doris?

838
01:14:16,287 --> 01:14:18,084
This is Doris.

839
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:21,876
Listen, you are
a prostitute named Michelle.

840
01:14:21,967 --> 01:14:24,765
Go to the room.
There will be a man there.

841
01:14:24,847 --> 01:14:27,407
He is a suspected arms dealer.

842
01:14:27,487 --> 01:14:29,125
Now, wait a minute.

843
01:14:29,207 --> 01:14:33,041
You don't expect me to, uh,
you know.

844
01:14:33,127 --> 01:14:36,085
No. He has particular tastes.

845
01:14:36,167 --> 01:14:39,125
He likes to watch.

846
01:14:39,207 --> 01:14:43,644
Tell him that his regular girl,
Carla, is sick.

847
01:14:43,727 --> 01:14:46,116
If he likes you,
he will tell you what to do.

848
01:14:46,207 --> 01:14:48,277
You must plant the bug...

849
01:14:48,367 --> 01:14:51,677
near the telephone by the bed
before you leave.

850
01:14:51,767 --> 01:14:54,406
If you do not
complete your mission...

851
01:14:54,487 --> 01:14:56,398
the deal is off.

852
01:14:57,967 --> 01:15:00,003
I'm gonna go to hell.

853
01:17:11,087 --> 01:17:12,998
Have some champagne.

854
01:17:26,927 --> 01:17:28,599
Come in here.

855
01:17:47,087 --> 01:17:49,965
My name is Michelle.

856
01:17:50,047 --> 01:17:52,083
Carla thought you'd like me.

857
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:54,158
Let me do the talking.

858
01:17:54,247 --> 01:17:56,761
You may start by
unzipping your dress.

859
01:18:00,007 --> 01:18:03,477
No, no. Turn around.

860
01:18:03,567 --> 01:18:07,446
Do it doucement.
Do it very slowly.

861
01:18:13,767 --> 01:18:15,405
Good.

862
01:18:16,527 --> 01:18:19,246
Now slip the dress down slowly.

863
01:18:30,687 --> 01:18:31,961
Good.

864
01:18:38,327 --> 01:18:40,522
Now slide your nylons off
one by one.

865
01:18:43,207 --> 01:18:44,720
I'm not wearing any.

866
01:18:44,807 --> 01:18:46,604
That's good.

867
01:18:48,607 --> 01:18:50,916
Now, dance for me.

868
01:18:57,527 --> 01:18:59,199
Dance sexy.

869
01:18:59,287 --> 01:19:03,838
Let your hands be your lover's hands
on your own skin as you move.

870
01:21:05,767 --> 01:21:08,565
Now lie on the bed
and close your eyes.

871
01:21:14,847 --> 01:21:16,917
I thought you only
liked to watch.

872
01:21:21,927 --> 01:21:25,158
Now lie on the bed
and close your eyes.

873
01:22:46,567 --> 01:22:48,159
You pig!

874
01:22:49,287 --> 01:22:50,686
Bastard!

875
01:23:01,767 --> 01:23:03,644
Wait, wait, wait.

876
01:23:09,087 --> 01:23:12,966
Yes, it's Harry. I know it looks bad,
but I can explain.

877
01:23:14,527 --> 01:23:16,836
Nobody move!

878
01:23:16,927 --> 01:23:19,521
Don't move!

879
01:23:20,727 --> 01:23:22,877
Helen, just don't do anything.

880
01:23:22,967 --> 01:23:26,198
No, he has nothing to do with it!
I'm the one you want!

881
01:23:26,287 --> 01:23:27,436
Shut up!

882
01:23:27,527 --> 01:23:29,757
Quiet, Helen.
Do what they say.

883
01:23:32,087 --> 01:23:35,079
Come on, guys, let the hooker go.
She's not important.

884
01:23:35,167 --> 01:23:36,680
You don't need her.

885
01:23:36,767 --> 01:23:39,281
Harry, please,
just let me handle this.

886
01:23:39,367 --> 01:23:40,959
Shut up!

887
01:23:42,647 --> 01:23:44,842
What were you doing there?

888
01:23:44,927 --> 01:23:48,237
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
- Talk again and I'll kill you!

889
01:24:27,207 --> 01:24:30,040
I wish I could say
it's nice to see you again.

890
01:24:30,127 --> 01:24:32,163
You know her?

891
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:37,202
You know, this shade's
totally wrong for you.

892
01:24:37,287 --> 01:24:39,482
So who's your little friend?

893
01:24:39,567 --> 01:24:43,162
I'm Helen Tasker.
Harry is my husband. And you are?

894
01:24:43,247 --> 01:24:45,602
So now it's Tasker,
not Renquist.

895
01:24:47,047 --> 01:24:50,926
She's just some wacko hooker
I met down at the bar.

896
01:24:51,007 --> 01:24:54,317
What is the matter with you?
Just tell her the truth!

897
01:24:54,407 --> 01:24:56,967
We are married,
and we have a daughter.

898
01:24:57,047 --> 01:24:59,038
I don't know what
the crazy bitch is on.

899
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:02,722
You should cut her loose
so we can get down to business.

900
01:25:02,807 --> 01:25:04,763
Where did I get this then, huh?

901
01:25:04,847 --> 01:25:06,758
Where did I get this?

902
01:25:13,807 --> 01:25:16,241
Something before takeoff?

903
01:25:16,327 --> 01:25:18,795
That hurt, you b--

904
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:26,285
She was telling the truth,
wasn't she?

905
01:25:26,367 --> 01:25:28,278
She really doesn't know.

906
01:25:30,687 --> 01:25:32,325
How interesting.

907
01:26:19,487 --> 01:26:20,806
Bring them.

908
01:26:28,927 --> 01:26:30,838
Incredible, aren't they?

909
01:26:32,527 --> 01:26:35,166
I call them the Four Horsemen.

910
01:26:35,247 --> 01:26:38,159
They're warrior figures...

911
01:26:38,247 --> 01:26:41,637
from the Persian Empire
of Darius I...

912
01:26:41,727 --> 01:26:43,638
around 500 BC.

913
01:26:46,007 --> 01:26:47,998
They're absolutely priceless.

914
01:26:50,087 --> 01:26:51,918
Pity.

915
01:27:13,087 --> 01:27:15,078
Wait, wait!

916
01:27:16,127 --> 01:27:17,526
Open it.

917
01:27:45,887 --> 01:27:47,878
Do you know what this is?

918
01:27:49,887 --> 01:27:51,798
I know what this is.

919
01:27:54,887 --> 01:27:56,798
This is an espresso machine.

920
01:28:00,647 --> 01:28:03,115
It's a snow cone maker.
That's what it is.

921
01:28:07,327 --> 01:28:09,238
Is it a water heater?

922
01:28:12,807 --> 01:28:15,002
Do you know why
you've been brought here?

923
01:28:15,087 --> 01:28:17,601
So that this man
can verify to the world...

924
01:28:17,687 --> 01:28:20,599
the Crimson Jihad
is now a nuclear power.

925
01:28:22,567 --> 01:28:26,242
How can he do that?
He's just a salesman, for Christ's sake.

926
01:28:30,687 --> 01:28:34,282
If I'm wrong about him,
the last thing you'll see...

927
01:28:34,367 --> 01:28:36,961
will be your blood
spraying across his face.

928
01:28:43,247 --> 01:28:47,479
It's a Soviet MIRV-6
from an SS-22 air launch vehicle.

929
01:28:47,567 --> 01:28:51,003
The warhead contains
1 4.5 kilograms of enriched uranium...

930
01:28:51,087 --> 01:28:52,839
and a plutonium trigger.

931
01:28:52,927 --> 01:28:54,838
The nominal yield is 30 kilotons.

932
01:29:08,887 --> 01:29:12,243
What can I say?
I'm a spy.

933
01:29:20,607 --> 01:29:23,485
You bastard!
You lying son of a bitch!

934
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:26,718
- Sorry, honey.
- Don't you call me honey!

935
01:29:26,807 --> 01:29:28,763
You don't ever get
to call me honey again!

936
01:29:28,847 --> 01:29:30,803
You understand me, you pig?

937
01:29:30,887 --> 01:29:33,959
And I can verify that
they have the arming box...

938
01:29:34,047 --> 01:29:36,720
and all the equipment necessary...

939
01:29:36,807 --> 01:29:39,321
to detonate all four warheads.

940
01:29:47,847 --> 01:29:51,317
You have killed our women
and our children...

941
01:29:51,407 --> 01:29:54,797
bombed our cities from afar
like cowards...

942
01:29:54,887 --> 01:29:58,880
and you dare
to call us terrorists?

943
01:29:58,967 --> 01:30:01,640
Now the oppressed
have been given a mighty sword...

944
01:30:01,727 --> 01:30:05,402
with which to strike back
at their enemies.

945
01:30:05,487 --> 01:30:07,284
Unless you, America...

946
01:30:07,367 --> 01:30:09,961
pulls all military forces
out of the Persian Gulf area...

947
01:30:10,047 --> 01:30:12,322
immediately and forever...

948
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:15,205
the Crimson Jihad will rain fire...

949
01:30:15,287 --> 01:30:18,085
on one major U.S. city each week...

950
01:30:18,167 --> 01:30:20,476
until our demands are met.

951
01:30:20,567 --> 01:30:24,765
First, we will detonate one weapon
on this uninhabited island...

952
01:30:24,847 --> 01:30:27,725
as a demonstration of our power...

953
01:30:27,807 --> 01:30:31,880
and Crimson Jihad's willingness
to be humanitarian.

954
01:30:31,967 --> 01:30:35,243
However, if these demands
are not met...

955
01:30:35,327 --> 01:30:37,921
Crimson Jihad will rain fire...

956
01:30:38,007 --> 01:30:41,397
on one major American city
each week--

957
01:30:43,687 --> 01:30:45,325
Battery.

958
01:30:52,247 --> 01:30:54,477
Get another one, you moron.

959
01:30:54,567 --> 01:30:57,957
I think I have one in the truck.

960
01:30:59,927 --> 01:31:01,758
- What?
- Look at this.

961
01:31:03,487 --> 01:31:06,763
- That's not mine.
- Nice transmitter.

962
01:31:08,487 --> 01:31:11,559
Miami Tower,
Jet Star 64 7 9 Delta on final.

963
01:31:11,647 --> 01:31:13,683
- We'll be on the ground in 1 2 minutes.
- All right.

964
01:31:13,767 --> 01:31:16,327
Tell those D.E.A. boys
to have the helos...

965
01:31:16,407 --> 01:31:18,318
hot and ready to fly
in 1 2 minutes.

966
01:31:18,407 --> 01:31:22,195
Signal's definitely stopped moving.
It's an island in the Keys.

967
01:31:26,927 --> 01:31:29,077
- We lost the signal.
- Shit!

968
01:31:47,367 --> 01:31:50,484
All right, everyone.
This is Samir.

969
01:31:51,567 --> 01:31:54,764
For 50 points,
see if you can guess his specialty.

970
01:31:54,847 --> 01:31:56,644
Oral hygiene?

971
01:31:56,727 --> 01:32:00,959
- Not exactly.
- What's going on?

972
01:32:01,047 --> 01:32:03,561
Samir's just gonna ask Harry
a few questions.

973
01:32:03,647 --> 01:32:06,957
We're not even sure
which agency Harry works for.

974
01:32:07,047 --> 01:32:09,163
Now, Samir's absolutely first-class.

975
01:32:09,247 --> 01:32:12,876
On the other hand we have Harry,
who's managed to lie convincingly...

976
01:32:12,967 --> 01:32:15,640
to the woman he loves for 1 5 years.

977
01:32:15,727 --> 01:32:19,561
So it'll be interesting to see
how long he can resist.

978
01:32:19,647 --> 01:32:21,558
This will help.

979
01:32:22,847 --> 01:32:25,520
You know, you should
swab that with alcohol.

980
01:32:25,607 --> 01:32:27,518
I might get an infection.

981
01:32:29,087 --> 01:32:32,318
I'll return when
this has taken effect.

982
01:32:32,407 --> 01:32:35,001
Then we'll talk.

983
01:32:35,087 --> 01:32:37,442
I'm looking forward to it.

984
01:32:37,527 --> 01:32:40,325
Now, why are you helping
these raving psychotics?

985
01:32:40,407 --> 01:32:43,797
Because they're very well-funded
raving psychotics...

986
01:32:43,887 --> 01:32:46,321
and I'm getting a lot of money.

987
01:32:48,807 --> 01:32:51,082
What, you think I care
about their cause?

988
01:32:51,167 --> 01:32:54,716
Or yours?
Not at all.

989
01:32:55,967 --> 01:32:57,844
You're damaged goods, lady.

990
01:33:04,567 --> 01:33:06,683
Did you tell her about us?

991
01:33:06,767 --> 01:33:09,998
There is no ""us,""
you psychopathic bitch.

992
01:33:10,087 --> 01:33:12,442
Oh, sure.

993
01:33:12,527 --> 01:33:14,483
You say that now.

994
01:33:19,127 --> 01:33:22,597
Thanks for everything.
It wasn't bad while it lasted.

995
01:33:22,687 --> 01:33:24,757
Let's go.

996
01:33:24,847 --> 01:33:26,724
You two stay here.

997
01:33:32,127 --> 01:33:34,038
There was nothing.

998
01:33:35,927 --> 01:33:37,246
I swear.

999
01:33:59,127 --> 01:34:02,244
What did they give you?

1000
01:34:04,607 --> 01:34:07,599
Sodium Amytal,
or some other truth agent.

1001
01:34:09,007 --> 01:34:10,918
It makes you tell the truth?

1002
01:34:14,767 --> 01:34:17,156
Is it working?

1003
01:34:17,247 --> 01:34:20,045
Ask me a question
that I normally would lie to.

1004
01:34:22,167 --> 01:34:24,965
- Are we gonna die?
- Yep.

1005
01:34:25,047 --> 01:34:27,277
I'd say it's working.

1006
01:34:27,367 --> 01:34:30,882
They're gonna shoot us in the head,
or they're gonna torture us to death...

1007
01:34:30,967 --> 01:34:33,083
or they're gonna leave us here
and let the bomb--

1008
01:34:39,247 --> 01:34:42,159
How long have you been a spy?

1009
01:34:46,207 --> 01:34:48,163
Seventeen years.

1010
01:34:59,327 --> 01:35:01,522
Have you ever killed anyone?

1011
01:35:04,207 --> 01:35:06,437
Yeah, but they were all bad.

1012
01:35:35,167 --> 01:35:40,321
Is there anything you want to tell me
before we start?

1013
01:35:40,407 --> 01:35:41,806
Yeah.

1014
01:35:41,887 --> 01:35:44,196
I'm going to kill you pretty soon.

1015
01:35:44,287 --> 01:35:46,278
I see.

1016
01:35:47,327 --> 01:35:50,000
How, exactly?

1017
01:35:50,087 --> 01:35:54,239
First, I'm going to use you
as a human shield.

1018
01:35:54,327 --> 01:35:56,921
Then I'm going to kill
this guard over there...

1019
01:35:57,007 --> 01:35:59,396
with the Patterson trocar
on the table.

1020
01:36:00,407 --> 01:36:02,637
And then I was thinking
about breaking your neck.

1021
01:36:04,847 --> 01:36:08,203
And what makes you think
you can do all that?

1022
01:36:08,287 --> 01:36:10,642
You know my handcuffs?

1023
01:36:10,727 --> 01:36:12,445
I picked them.

1024
01:36:34,567 --> 01:36:36,478
Let's get out of here.

1025
01:37:24,567 --> 01:37:26,364
Come on!

1026
01:38:06,647 --> 01:38:08,478
Drop the gun!

1027
01:38:15,167 --> 01:38:17,840
Honey, next time, duck.

1028
01:38:22,967 --> 01:38:26,039
- Let's go.
- I married Rambo.

1029
01:38:51,207 --> 01:38:53,118
What are they doing?

1030
01:39:14,887 --> 01:39:16,718
It is done.

1031
01:39:19,807 --> 01:39:23,402
In 90 minutes,
a pillar of holy fire...

1032
01:39:23,487 --> 01:39:25,557
will light up the skies...

1033
01:39:28,807 --> 01:39:30,957
to show to the world...

1034
01:39:31,047 --> 01:39:33,515
that we speak the truth.

1035
01:39:48,127 --> 01:39:50,766
We are set on our course.

1036
01:39:50,847 --> 01:39:53,042
No force can stop us now.

1037
01:39:53,127 --> 01:39:55,880
We're cool, we're bad-asses,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

1038
01:39:55,967 --> 01:39:58,606
If we're on an island,
why are they using trucks?

1039
01:39:58,687 --> 01:40:01,599
We must be in the Florida Keys.

1040
01:40:01,687 --> 01:40:04,201
The overseas highway connects
the islands to the mainland.

1041
01:40:04,287 --> 01:40:07,165
There's no borders, no customs.

1042
01:40:07,247 --> 01:40:10,478
They can go anywhere in the U.S.
There's nothing to stop them.

1043
01:40:11,487 --> 01:40:12,886
Just us.

1044
01:40:14,687 --> 01:40:17,804
- Here, take this.
- Oh, shit.

1045
01:41:40,367 --> 01:41:41,561
Shoot!

1046
01:41:56,967 --> 01:41:58,480
Shit!

1047
01:44:50,487 --> 01:44:52,125
Let's go.

1048
01:44:59,087 --> 01:45:02,318
My condolences to the widow.

1049
01:45:17,527 --> 01:45:19,916
We may need the hostage.

1050
01:45:22,127 --> 01:45:24,436
Okay, let's go, Suzy Homemaker.

1051
01:45:30,687 --> 01:45:32,405
Hurry up!

1052
01:45:32,487 --> 01:45:34,398
Just get her in the car.
Let's get going.

1053
01:46:42,647 --> 01:46:46,720
- I thought this looked like your work.
- Let's go. I'll brief you in the air.

1054
01:46:46,807 --> 01:46:50,322
You're welcome. Let's go!
Let's get out of here!

1055
01:46:50,407 --> 01:46:52,398
Let's go!
Come on!

1056
01:47:13,767 --> 01:47:17,396
Well, you tell that son of a bitch
this is a Bright Boy Alert.

1057
01:47:17,487 --> 01:47:19,955
I repeat:
A Bright Boy Alert.

1058
01:47:20,047 --> 01:47:22,242
This is not a drill.
Do you understand that?

1059
01:47:22,327 --> 01:47:25,125
Hold on.
Put me through to the White House.

1060
01:47:25,207 --> 01:47:29,485
The minimum safe distance is 1 2 miles.
Get the marine patrol in right away.

1061
01:47:29,567 --> 01:47:31,797
I want the Coast Guard
and the sheriff's department too.

1062
01:47:31,887 --> 01:47:35,323
Anyone that cannot make that distance,
you gotta get 'em out by air.

1063
01:47:35,407 --> 01:47:38,683
You've got exactly 34 minutes.

1064
01:47:38,767 --> 01:47:41,281
I can get you two Marine Corps Harriers
here in 1 1 minutes.

1065
01:47:41,367 --> 01:47:43,961
- They're on manoeuvres outside Key West.
- Get them.

1066
01:47:44,047 --> 01:47:46,481
- I'll brief them on the way in.
- Send 'em in right away.

1067
01:47:57,327 --> 01:47:59,716
Would you like one?

1068
01:48:05,887 --> 01:48:09,118
I want the state police driving through
the streets on their damn loudspeakers.

1069
01:48:09,207 --> 01:48:10,925
Here they come.

1070
01:48:20,407 --> 01:48:24,241
Lime-Zero-One, got a tally on
three trucks eastbound on the bridge.

1071
01:48:24,327 --> 01:48:26,921
Roger, Lime-Zero-One.
You're clear to engage.

1072
01:48:27,007 --> 01:48:30,238
Ringo is padlocked.
In hot with guns.

1073
01:48:30,327 --> 01:48:32,682
Let's get some.

1074
01:49:33,287 --> 01:49:34,720
Okay, marines, time to kick ass.

1075
01:49:34,807 --> 01:49:37,560
Recommend using your Mavericks
to take out the bridge.

1076
01:49:37,647 --> 01:49:41,322
Roger that.
Lime flight, switch Mavericks. Two.

1077
01:49:41,407 --> 01:49:43,637
These missiles won't
set off those nukes, will they?

1078
01:49:43,727 --> 01:49:45,957
That's a negative.

1079
01:49:49,007 --> 01:49:51,316
Fire.

1080
01:50:10,767 --> 01:50:12,723
- Bingo!
- Good shooting, marines.

1081
01:51:02,647 --> 01:51:03,796
I'll kill you!

1082
01:51:21,087 --> 01:51:23,521
- It's out of control.
- Somebody capped the driver.

1083
01:51:30,727 --> 01:51:32,001
Bitch!

1084
01:52:01,167 --> 01:52:03,635
Like one?
How about two?

1085
01:52:29,127 --> 01:52:31,038
Get down to the limo!

1086
01:52:34,007 --> 01:52:36,760
Come on!
Take it down! Let's go!

1087
01:52:37,807 --> 01:52:40,685
- Get down!
- Take it down.

1088
01:52:49,447 --> 01:52:52,598
- The bridge is out!
- What?

1089
01:52:52,687 --> 01:52:55,565
The bridge is out!

1090
01:52:55,647 --> 01:52:57,558
I can't hear you!

1091
01:52:57,647 --> 01:52:59,126
What?

1092
01:53:02,047 --> 01:53:04,766
Oh, God!
The bridge is out!

1093
01:53:07,487 --> 01:53:09,557
Come on! Come on!

1094
01:53:09,647 --> 01:53:12,115
Speed up a little bit, now.
Get down there.

1095
01:53:20,167 --> 01:53:21,725
Come on! Hurry!

1096
01:53:21,807 --> 01:53:23,718
Hurry, Harry!

1097
01:53:23,807 --> 01:53:26,924
- Grab my hand!
- Come back!

1098
01:53:27,007 --> 01:53:30,556
- Okay, to the right.
- I can't reach! Get lower!

1099
01:53:40,127 --> 01:53:42,436
Here we go!
Hold on!

1100
01:53:42,527 --> 01:53:44,483
Hold on really tight!

1101
01:53:48,167 --> 01:53:50,965
Harry! Come back!

1102
01:53:51,047 --> 01:53:52,446
Pull up!

1103
01:53:55,407 --> 01:53:57,602
Grab my hand!
You can do it!

1104
01:53:57,687 --> 01:53:59,962
I can't reach!

1105
01:54:02,127 --> 01:54:04,402
Oh, God! Please!
Harry!

1106
01:54:08,687 --> 01:54:10,040
Oh, shit.

1107
01:54:11,247 --> 01:54:13,124
Come on, baby.

1108
01:54:20,207 --> 01:54:21,560
Hold on!

1109
01:54:21,647 --> 01:54:23,080
I got you!

1110
01:54:23,167 --> 01:54:26,443
- Oh, God!
- Hold on tight!

1111
01:54:58,247 --> 01:55:01,478
Let's get this thing on the ground.

1112
01:55:09,767 --> 01:55:11,723
Let's get these aircraft
on the ground.

1113
01:55:11,807 --> 01:55:14,879
We got a nuclear bomb going off
in about one minute.

1114
01:55:18,527 --> 01:55:20,916
Any minute now.
Go, go, go.

1115
01:55:21,007 --> 01:55:23,475
Come here.
Give me a bullhorn.

1116
01:55:25,727 --> 01:55:27,319
All right, it's show time.

1117
01:55:27,407 --> 01:55:30,160
Do not look at the flash.
Do not look at the flash!

1118
01:55:31,847 --> 01:55:33,758
We should be safe here.

1119
01:55:42,407 --> 01:55:45,046
This is the wrong finger.

1120
01:56:21,967 --> 01:56:23,320
Come here!

1121
01:56:24,327 --> 01:56:25,919
- Go to work.
- Okay. Bye.

1122
01:56:28,687 --> 01:56:32,441
Aziz's copter landed about 20 minutes
ago on top of a high-rise in Miami.

1123
01:56:32,527 --> 01:56:36,076
He rendezvoused with some faction
members. They're on the 20th floor.

1124
01:56:36,167 --> 01:56:39,443
I got SWAT down there.
The cops cordoned off the area.

1125
01:56:39,527 --> 01:56:41,916
They got a hostage.
It's Dana.

1126
01:56:43,607 --> 01:56:45,882
What do you mean?
My Dana?

1127
01:56:45,967 --> 01:56:47,878
I'm real sorry.
I don't know what to say.

1128
01:56:47,967 --> 01:56:50,037
I guess he grabbed her
in the middle of the night.

1129
01:56:50,127 --> 01:56:52,038
We just found out about it.

1130
01:56:52,127 --> 01:56:54,322
But I don't want you to worry.
We'll get her back.

1131
01:56:54,407 --> 01:56:56,318
I've got a guy on the inside.
Listen.

1132
01:56:56,407 --> 01:56:58,841
We're gonna get her back.
Here we go.

1133
01:57:01,407 --> 01:57:04,399
Excuse me, Captain. I got to
borrow your plane for a minute.

1134
01:57:04,487 --> 01:57:08,400
Listen, Force Comm cleared you
to give us total cooperation, right?

1135
01:57:08,487 --> 01:57:11,320
And you know that comes directly from
the president of these United States.

1136
01:57:11,407 --> 01:57:13,967
But, sir, you're gonna have
to sign for this aircraft.

1137
01:57:14,047 --> 01:57:17,005
I'll sign for it. You got a pen?
You take care of it.

1138
01:57:17,967 --> 01:57:20,037
Do you realize
it has been ten years...

1139
01:57:20,127 --> 01:57:22,038
since you've been behind
the wheel of one of these?

1140
01:57:22,127 --> 01:57:24,436
I break it,
they can take it out of my pay.

1141
01:57:24,527 --> 01:57:27,325
Listen, we got a guy on the inside.

1142
01:57:34,007 --> 01:57:37,158
Gotta move back, everybody!
Let's go!

1143
01:57:52,367 --> 01:57:54,437
All right, everybody,
it's gonna be all right!

1144
01:57:56,607 --> 01:57:59,075
He's got hundreds of hours
in the Harriers there.

1145
01:58:02,967 --> 01:58:06,926
He is a little rusty,
but that's a trademark Tasker takeoff.

1146
01:58:07,007 --> 01:58:10,079
It's like riding a bike.
You never forget, really.

1147
01:58:13,247 --> 01:58:16,557
We might wanna seek shelter!

1148
01:58:19,847 --> 01:58:22,122
Sorry.

1149
01:58:22,807 --> 01:58:24,126
Fuck!

1150
01:58:43,887 --> 01:58:48,517
The streets are filled with people
as police try to evacuate the buildings.

1151
01:58:48,607 --> 01:58:51,326
They appear to be shooting
wildly into the air as I'm speaking.

1152
01:58:51,407 --> 01:58:53,363
These seem to be warning shots.
So far...

1153
01:58:53,447 --> 01:58:55,677
they have not fired at us or police.

1154
01:58:55,887 --> 01:58:57,684
This apparently is the same group...

1155
01:58:57,767 --> 01:58:59,997
which just detonated a nuclear bomb
in the Florida Keys.

1156
01:59:00,087 --> 01:59:04,319
Crimson jihad will rain fire
on one major U.S. city each week...

1157
01:59:04,407 --> 01:59:07,319
until our demands are met.

1158
01:59:07,407 --> 01:59:11,082
This tape was released to the media
just minutes after the terrorists--

1159
01:59:11,167 --> 01:59:14,239
I have to go to the bathroom.

1160
01:59:14,327 --> 01:59:18,366
We'll repeat the tape following
this live report from the scene.

1161
01:59:21,807 --> 01:59:23,479
Hold your fire!

1162
01:59:23,567 --> 01:59:25,797
- The video crew you wanted is here!
- Send them!

1163
01:59:28,847 --> 01:59:31,122
They're coming in.
They're unarmed.

1164
01:59:47,167 --> 01:59:48,919
Come on. Let's go.

1165
01:59:49,007 --> 01:59:50,645
Go.

1166
01:59:55,887 --> 01:59:59,197
This is a communique
from Crimson Jihad.

1167
01:59:59,287 --> 02:00:02,404
You have seen a demonstration
of our power.

1168
02:00:02,487 --> 02:00:04,717
Do not force us
to destroy this city...

1169
02:00:04,807 --> 02:00:06,798
and do not try
to use force against us.

1170
02:00:06,887 --> 02:00:09,879
I, we are all prepared to die.

1171
02:00:09,967 --> 02:00:12,959
With one turn of that key...

1172
02:00:13,047 --> 02:00:16,676
two million of your people
will die instantly!

1173
02:00:16,767 --> 02:00:19,440
- What key?
- That key!

1174
02:00:19,527 --> 02:00:21,245
Who's taken the key?

1175
02:00:27,247 --> 02:00:29,124
Shoot her!

1176
02:00:53,287 --> 02:00:54,959
Holy shit!

1177
02:01:25,687 --> 02:01:28,679
Unit One to Unit Seven.
Give me a situation report.

1178
02:01:28,767 --> 02:01:31,565
One to Seven. Give me a sit rep.
Faisil, do you copy?

1179
02:01:32,967 --> 02:01:34,958
Seven here.
2 1 st floor secure.

1180
02:01:35,047 --> 02:01:38,596
About 1 2 faction members
on the 20th floor. No hostages there.

1181
02:01:38,687 --> 02:01:40,678
- Where's Dana?
- She's on the roof.

1182
02:01:40,767 --> 02:01:43,281
Okay, stay put.
Give me that address again.

1183
02:01:49,567 --> 02:01:51,285
You shoot me, this'll fall!

1184
02:01:53,807 --> 02:01:56,446
Stay where you are!
Stay where you are!

1185
02:02:00,487 --> 02:02:03,240
- Give me the key!
- I'll drop it, I swear!

1186
02:02:07,567 --> 02:02:09,717
Give me the key.

1187
02:02:09,807 --> 02:02:12,879
Come on, child.
You don't want to die, do you?

1188
02:02:15,047 --> 02:02:18,960
Give me the key
and you won't get hurt.

1189
02:02:19,047 --> 02:02:21,083
I give you my word!

1190
02:02:22,247 --> 02:02:24,283
No way, you wacko!

1191
02:02:29,327 --> 02:02:31,716
Help me!

1192
02:03:20,127 --> 02:03:22,118
Please don't come any closer!

1193
02:03:24,807 --> 02:03:26,479
Help me! Help me!

1194
02:03:26,567 --> 02:03:27,966
Somebody!

1195
02:03:39,567 --> 02:03:41,239
Dana, jump down!

1196
02:03:41,327 --> 02:03:42,806
Jump down!

1197
02:03:43,367 --> 02:03:44,766
Dad?

1198
02:03:52,967 --> 02:03:54,525
Help me!

1199
02:04:28,527 --> 02:04:30,677
Daddy, come back!

1200
02:04:35,407 --> 02:04:37,477
Daddy, get me down!

1201
02:04:41,847 --> 02:04:43,838
Jump!Jump!

1202
02:04:43,927 --> 02:04:45,485
Daddy will catch you!

1203
02:04:45,567 --> 02:04:47,637
-Jump!
- I can't!

1204
02:04:51,807 --> 02:04:52,922
Hold on!

1205
02:05:02,247 --> 02:05:04,442
Don't you let me fall, please!

1206
02:05:04,527 --> 02:05:06,483
- Daddy!
- I got you!

1207
02:05:06,567 --> 02:05:07,602
I'm slipping!

1208
02:05:12,047 --> 02:05:13,958
Help me!
I'm gonna fall!

1209
02:05:20,167 --> 02:05:21,759
Hold my hand!

1210
02:05:25,607 --> 02:05:27,837
Hold on tight, honey.

1211
02:06:20,647 --> 02:06:22,603
He's behind you!

1212
02:06:23,887 --> 02:06:27,163
Take this plane down, now!
I'll kill her!

1213
02:06:27,247 --> 02:06:29,920
Take it down, now!

1214
02:06:46,047 --> 02:06:48,038
My God, do something!

1215
02:06:55,047 --> 02:06:56,958
You're fired.

1216
02:07:41,087 --> 02:07:43,237
It's okay.

1217
02:07:45,927 --> 02:07:47,838
Honey, it's over.

1218
02:07:56,527 --> 02:07:58,119
Hi, pumpkin.

1219
02:08:01,527 --> 02:08:03,438
Just seconds after thejet landed...

1220
02:08:03,527 --> 02:08:07,076
the unidentified pilot was escorted
from the scene by Federal agents.

1221
02:08:07,167 --> 02:08:10,159
Though it is unclear at this moment
which agency was responsible...

1222
02:08:10,247 --> 02:08:12,636
for the operation which ended
the terrorist threat...

1223
02:08:12,727 --> 02:08:14,683
so dramatically
early this morning...

1224
02:08:14,767 --> 02:08:16,678
we've learned from Miami Police--

1225
02:08:24,087 --> 02:08:26,555
Do it properly.

1226
02:08:26,647 --> 02:08:30,845
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war.

1227
02:08:30,927 --> 02:08:33,964
Five, six, seven, eight,
try to keep your thumbs straight.

1228
02:08:34,047 --> 02:08:35,765
Don't! Stop it!

1229
02:08:35,847 --> 02:08:38,725
- Wait!
- I got you!

1230
02:08:38,807 --> 02:08:41,605
Just listen.
Listen to the rules.

1231
02:08:46,287 --> 02:08:49,518
- Hello?
- Boris and Doris?

1232
02:08:49,607 --> 02:08:51,279
We're on.

1233
02:08:52,967 --> 02:08:54,878
Yes? Go ahead.

1234
02:09:21,407 --> 02:09:23,318
Colonel, how nice to see you again.

1235
02:09:23,407 --> 02:09:25,637
Good evening.

1236
02:09:25,727 --> 02:09:27,479
Who was that?

1237
02:09:36,287 --> 02:09:38,801
What's the scoop, team?
You see your contact yet?

1238
02:09:38,887 --> 02:09:42,084
Haven't seen him yet.

1239
02:09:42,167 --> 02:09:44,840
But I see somebody
I'd like to say hello to.

1240
02:09:44,927 --> 02:09:47,043
Let me pour you
some more champagne.

1241
02:09:47,127 --> 02:09:49,357
I got to keep up the waiter bit.

1242
02:09:49,447 --> 02:09:51,881
These stakeouts can be tricky.

1243
02:09:51,967 --> 02:09:55,323
You never know when things might
explode into a life-or-death situation.

1244
02:09:55,407 --> 02:09:58,638
If it gets rough, stay low until
it's over and I'll contact you later.

1245
02:09:58,727 --> 02:10:03,039
- Maybe you should give me your--
- So, we meet again, Carlos.

1246
02:10:06,327 --> 02:10:08,841
Honey, I'm just gonna
do him right here, okay?

1247
02:10:08,927 --> 02:10:10,406
Go for it.

1248
02:10:11,767 --> 02:10:13,405
Oh, God.

1249
02:10:18,927 --> 02:10:20,838
Fear is not an option.

1250
02:10:32,847 --> 02:10:34,075
Dance?

1251
02:10:38,007 --> 02:10:39,759

1252
02:10:55,167 --> 02:10:57,442
Harry? Helen? Guys?

1253
02:10:57,527 --> 02:10:59,882
Come on, now.
Let's not get distracted.

1254
02:10:59,967 --> 02:11:01,878
We got some work to do.

1255
02:11:07,807 --> 02:11:09,923
All right, guys.
Come on.

1256
02:11:10,007 --> 02:11:13,920
You guys better get serious in there.
I'd be serious if I was in there.

1257
02:11:16,007 --> 02:11:18,521
Don't ignore me, Harry.
That's rude.

1258
02:11:21,847 --> 02:11:23,758
All right, guys.
Come on.

1259
02:11:26,647 --> 02:11:29,241
National security, guys.
Come on. Life and death.

1260
02:11:38,287 --> 02:11:40,482
Helen, I was always on your side.

1261
02:11:40,567 --> 02:11:42,478
I was always there for you.

1262
02:12:19,367 --> 02:12:22,803
You know what?
I'm sick of being in the van.

1263
02:12:22,887 --> 02:12:25,276
You guys are gonna be
in the van next time.

1264
02:12:25,367 --> 02:12:27,562
I been in the van for 1 5 years.
