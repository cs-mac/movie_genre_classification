1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,303
To be able to lie down
together like this,

2
00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:24,705
it's really great, right?

3
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:28,509
Yes, it's good.

4
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:34,115
Hyeong Seon, don't you feel
that this is going a bit too far?

5
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:38,619
You... what are you referring to?

6
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:43,124
Don't tell me that you're afraid
that I, before the marriage...

7
00:00:43,124 --> 00:00:46,627
Could it be...
that you don't trust me?

8
00:00:46,627 --> 00:00:51,332
I believe without a doubt that you'll hold
fast to your duties without wavering.

9
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:53,234
But I can't trust what is
within Your Highness

10
00:00:53,234 --> 00:01:01,042
as the urges of a man have
been hidden away for so long.

11
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:07,048
But, how can I sleep under
these circumstances?

12
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:14,355
Then, can we come to
a simple agreement?

13
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:17,058
Agreement?
What agreement?

14
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:22,864
No matter what...
absolutely... definitely don't

15
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:24,665
give in to your instincts.

16
00:01:24,665 --> 00:01:27,268
Don't touch a strand of agassi's hair.
(Agassi - young lady)

17
00:01:27,268 --> 00:01:31,472
You're really becoming
more and more outrageous!

18
00:01:32,373 --> 00:01:35,276
Hyeong Seon sir,

19
00:01:35,276 --> 00:01:37,078
His Majesty and I have already
been separated for 8 years.

20
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:39,881
Think about all those days
we were apart.

21
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:43,985
Really wishing not to be apart and thinking
of him every second, every minute.

22
00:01:43,985 --> 00:01:45,186
Please,

23
00:01:45,186 --> 00:01:51,492
At the very least, here in the pitch
black night, let me see His Majesty.

24
00:01:51,893 --> 00:01:55,596
I will cautiously advise you,

25
00:01:55,596 --> 00:02:02,703
please look into each other's eyes as much
as you want, but keep to yourselves.

26
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:14,515
He has attended to me for
almost 20 years,

27
00:02:14,515 --> 00:02:16,918
but instead he listened to you.

28
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:21,822
I will follow his damned instructions.

29
00:02:21,822 --> 00:02:27,028
He can rest assured that I won't
touch a strand of your hair.

30
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:33,834
Are you serious?

31
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:35,436
Of course.

32
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:40,341
A real man will not go back
on his word. Absolutely.

33
00:02:48,249 --> 00:02:52,153
For daring to touch your
hand without permission,

34
00:02:52,153 --> 00:02:56,157
will you chase me out?

35
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:01,762
Impossible.

36
00:03:01,762 --> 00:03:05,466
Will you punish me?

37
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:07,468
How can I?

38
00:03:07,468 --> 00:03:14,976
Your Majesty, it was not you
who touched me.

39
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:40,902
The palace maid has disappeared.

40
00:03:40,902 --> 00:03:46,407
I'm not sure if His Majesty
has become suspicious,

41
00:03:46,407 --> 00:03:50,411
but it's said that she was
moved to another palace.

42
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:53,814
We couldn't find any trace of her.

43
00:03:53,814 --> 00:03:55,016
Not only that.

44
00:03:55,016 --> 00:04:00,221
Except for the few who have served
His Majesty since he was the Crown Prince,

45
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:05,126
His Majesty has replaced all his
palace maids in the past few days.

46
00:04:05,126 --> 00:04:07,728
He replaced all his palace maids?

47
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:09,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

48
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,934
This is what I heard.

49
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:19,840
Something is definitely being
hidden in the King's Quarters.

50
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,742
What?

51
00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:28,249
Just what is His Majesty hiding?

52
00:04:31,452 --> 00:04:35,456
Your Excellency,
you shouldn't be running.

53
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:40,261
I'm sorry, Mother.

54
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:45,766
I just wanted to hurry and tell
the good news to mother.

55
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:49,770
I've felt your feelings of
happiness myself,

56
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,373
but you should be extra careful.

57
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:56,277
The physician has said so repeatedly.

58
00:04:56,277 --> 00:04:58,279
Yes, Mother.

59
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:05,086
From this day on,
I will be more careful.

60
00:05:17,298 --> 00:05:19,300
Have you been well these days,
Your Excellency?

61
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,602
Yes.

62
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:25,406
But, who are you?

63
00:05:25,606 --> 00:05:28,509
I'm an official from the
Royal Investigation Bureau, Hong Gyu Tae.

64
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:30,912
Is that so?

65
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:34,215
You have the appearance of bravery
which is well suited to your position.

66
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:38,019
You must be loyal to His Majesty.

67
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:42,523
Yes, I will follow your command.

68
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:54,535
The matter I asked you to
inquire about, is there any news?

69
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:56,737
Yes, according to your command,

70
00:05:56,737 --> 00:06:02,043
though rather difficult, I managed to
track down the former investigator.

71
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:06,047
However, there was nothing useful.

72
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:08,850
- Is that so?
- But...

73
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,552
What is it?

74
00:06:11,552 --> 00:06:17,358
Before the former King issued an order to stop the
investigation into the death of the Crown Princess,

75
00:06:17,358 --> 00:06:20,361
he frequently visited the Crystal Palace.

76
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:22,563
The Crystal Palace...

77
00:06:22,563 --> 00:06:26,767
Wasn't the Crystal Palace the place
where Princess Min Hwa lived?

78
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,069
Yes.

79
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:32,373
The former King always showed
great favor towards the Princess.

80
00:06:32,373 --> 00:06:35,276
This isn't surprising at all,

81
00:06:35,276 --> 00:06:38,880
but I keep feeling
that it's a bit strange.

82
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,482
How? What is it?

83
00:06:41,482 --> 00:06:45,786
The former King visited the
Crystal Palace many times,

84
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:51,092
and without another selection process, the current
queen was directly appointed as the Crown Princess.

85
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:54,195
This just feels a little...

86
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:58,199
So, I was anticipating what
you would ask next...

87
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,601
I discreetly found a palace maid who had been
working at the Crystal Palace at that time

88
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:03,204
to investigate further.

89
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:09,310
She said that the Great Queen Dowager was
also a frequent visitor at the Crystal Palace.

90
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,212
The Great Queen Dowager?

91
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:12,813
That's correct.

92
00:07:14,615 --> 00:07:19,120
Ah, right. I've found out about the spell that
you previously asked me to investigate.

93
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,622
There's no need to report
on that any more,

94
00:07:21,622 --> 00:07:23,724
I've already heard it from the
Celestial Hall's Head Shaman.

95
00:07:23,724 --> 00:07:25,126
If it's like that

96
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:26,827
then I'll take my leave.

97
00:07:26,827 --> 00:07:30,831
Wait. Since you have investigated it,

98
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:32,333
just tell me.

99
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,236
It's not much.

100
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:39,240
A normal spell will typically
use a straw doll,

101
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,843
but on occasions a human being can
replace the doll for the spell.

102
00:07:42,843 --> 00:07:46,746
Replace a straw doll with a person?

103
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:48,249
Yes, Your Majesty.

104
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:51,652
If a person with a strong desire is
used in place of a straw doll,

105
00:07:51,652 --> 00:07:56,757
then the effectiveness of
the spell is intensified.

106
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,363
<i>Just what exactly are
you trying to hide?</i>

107
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:07,768
<i>I'm trying to hide
what you're looking for.</i>

108
00:08:07,768 --> 00:08:10,571
<i>It's all for Your Majesty.</i>

109
00:08:10,571 --> 00:08:13,374
<i>Let me say it more clearly.</i>

110
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:15,376
<i>It's to protect Your Majesty</i>

111
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:21,682
<i>and those people that you cherish.</i>

112
00:08:21,682 --> 00:08:25,286
<i>The former king had a
reason to bury this matter.</i>

113
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:27,788
<i>You have that same reason.</i>

114
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:33,594
Before the former King issued an order to stop the
investigation into the death of the Crown Princess,

115
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:35,997
<i>he frequently visited the Crystal Palace.</i>

116
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:39,200
<i>If the former King wanted
to conceal the truth,</i>

117
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,604
<i>he must have had a good reason.</i>

118
00:08:44,906 --> 00:08:46,107
Your Majesty.

119
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:50,611
<i>She said that the Great Queen Dowager was
also a frequent visitor at the Crystal Palace.</i>

120
00:08:50,611 --> 00:08:52,813
Your Majesty.

121
00:08:52,813 --> 00:08:58,219
It's fine. You may leave now.

122
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,521
Yes.

123
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,832
<i>Why...</i>

124
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:16,637
<i>Why would Princess Min Hwa...?</i>

125
00:09:17,138 --> 00:09:19,640
Did you say pregnant?

126
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,042
Yes, Your Majesty.

127
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:22,643
We've just been to the
Royal Physician

128
00:09:22,643 --> 00:09:27,048
and confirmed that the
Princess is pregnant.

129
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:30,551
I couldn't be happier.

130
00:09:30,551 --> 00:09:34,956
Recently the palace has been
filled with a gloomy atmosphere.

131
00:09:34,956 --> 00:09:37,458
Now at long last I hear joyous news.

132
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,360
Recently the Princess hasn't
been feeling well.

133
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,864
She has been staying in bed,
so I was becoming very worried.

134
00:09:42,864 --> 00:09:47,568
Now it seems like it was
due to morning sickness.

135
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:49,670
You did well, Princess.

136
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,073
You did really well.

137
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:53,875
But Mother,

138
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:59,080
may I please excuse myself
and return home first?

139
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:01,782
Why do you want to go now?

140
00:10:01,782 --> 00:10:03,784
Are you feeling unwell?

141
00:10:03,784 --> 00:10:06,287
No, that's not it.

142
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:13,794
It's just that I want to give the good
news to my husband as soon as possible.

143
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:16,097
The Queen Dowager will be disappointed.

144
00:10:16,097 --> 00:10:18,099
You haven't been to the
palace in so long.

145
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:20,101
You should spend more
time with your mother.

146
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:21,702
It's not necessary.

147
00:10:21,702 --> 00:10:25,306
It's said that a married daughter
belongs to her husband's family.

148
00:10:25,306 --> 00:10:28,009
Just let the Princess leave first.

149
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:31,913
You can stay and chat with me
some more before you leave.

150
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:35,116
Let's do that, Mother.

151
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:38,119
Then, I'll be leaving now.

152
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,820
No matter how rushed you are,

153
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,124
don't forget to visit His Majesty first.

154
00:10:43,124 --> 00:10:44,225
Yes,

155
00:10:44,225 --> 00:10:46,727
I will.

156
00:10:57,238 --> 00:10:59,640
<i>Crown Prince,</i>

157
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:02,843
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

158
00:11:03,544 --> 00:11:06,347
<i>Why do you say such a thing?</i>

159
00:11:06,347 --> 00:11:09,650
<i>Your father is incompetent.</i>

160
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:13,554
<i> I was unable to help you
protect that child.</i>

161
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:16,457
<i>Crown Prince, you're clever
and quick-witted.</i>

162
00:11:16,457 --> 00:11:21,762
<i>There'll come a day when you'll
understand the meaning of these words.</i>

163
00:11:21,762 --> 00:11:26,067
<i>You must remember what
I'm going to tell you.</i>

164
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:27,768
<i>Please tell me.</i>

165
00:11:27,768 --> 00:11:34,275
<i>Please, you must forgive all the
people I tried to protect.</i>

166
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:37,678
<i>Please protect them all.</i>

167
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:38,679
<i>What?</i>

168
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:41,382
<i>If you can't do it,</i>

169
00:11:41,382 --> 00:11:44,685
<i>then the first person you
mustn't forgive is me.</i>

170
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:46,687
<i>Please forgive me for
being slow-witted,</i>

171
00:11:46,687 --> 00:11:48,589
<i>but I don't understand
what you mean Father.</i>

172
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:51,792
<i>I am unable to understand.</i>

173
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:57,398
<i>Crown Prince,</i>

174
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:00,902
<i>the royal throne,</i>

175
00:12:01,402 --> 00:12:03,704
<i>is a very lonely place.</i>

176
00:12:03,704 --> 00:12:06,707
<i>There are people everywhere
who are your enemies.</i>

177
00:12:06,707 --> 00:12:09,510
<i>It's possible for anyone to
become your enemy.</i>

178
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:15,917
<i>Sometimes you have no choice but to
make decisions contrary to your convictions.

179
00:12:16,617 --> 00:12:20,021
<i>Sometimes those enemies...</i>

180
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:24,926
<i>may be your close relatives.</i>

181
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:28,029
<i>My only hope is that you will</i>

182
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:37,538
<i>at least be able to forgive...
those relatives.</i>

183
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,545
<i>The people that I need
to forgive and protect,</i>

184
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:47,148
<i>who are they?</i>

185
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:00,061
<i>Min... Min Hwa, you...</i>

186
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:02,463
<i>Orabeoni, I hate you. I hate you!</i>

187
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:03,865
<i>Why are you like this?</i>

188
00:13:03,865 --> 00:13:05,566
<i>You were saying bad things about me.</i>

189
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:07,568
<i>Furthermore, to say it in
front of him.</i>

190
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:10,671
I hate you, hate you, hate you!

191
00:13:10,671 --> 00:13:13,975
<i>The Crown Prince's words
were all lies.</i>

192
00:13:13,975 --> 00:13:17,578
<i>I'm not headstrong,
I'm a very dignified lady.
</i>

193
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:22,183
<i>I've nearly finished memorizing the
Thousand Character Classic.</i>

194
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:29,790
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

195
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:34,495
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

196
00:13:35,596 --> 00:13:41,202
You've known... for a while.

197
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:45,106
So,

198
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:50,811
is that why you concealed from me that
you had recovered your memories?

199
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:16,837
<i>You need to stop
this right now!</i>

200
00:14:17,238 --> 00:14:20,942
<i>Your Majesty, please retract your
decree to make Heo Yeom the Uibin.</i>

201
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:23,744
<i>I order you to stand
up immediately!</i>

202
00:14:23,744 --> 00:14:26,847
<i>If you stop someone as talented as
Heo Yeom from having any official post,</i>

203
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:29,650
<i>you might as well give the
order to execute him.</i>

204
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,652
<i>Is it not an honor to become a
member of the Royal Family?</i>

205
00:14:31,652 --> 00:14:33,154
<i>How can you compare it to
a death sentence?</i>

206
00:14:33,154 --> 00:14:37,358
<i>Is to lose a life the only thing that
can be considered a death?</i>

207
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:39,861
<i>What did you say?</i>

208
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:42,763
<i>I will comply with your
royal command.</i>

209
00:14:42,763 --> 00:14:45,266
<i>As you have ordered, I will marry
the Minister's daughter.</i>

210
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:52,673
<i>But please, Your Majesty, retract your
decree to appoint Scholar Heo as the Uibin.</i>

211
00:14:54,575 --> 00:14:57,678
<i>Leave immediately.</i>

212
00:14:57,678 --> 00:15:02,984
<i>As long as Your Majesty refuses to
retract the order, I won't leave.</i>

213
00:15:02,984 --> 00:15:05,786
<i>Must I have you dragged out in
disgrace by the guards</i>

214
00:15:05,786 --> 00:15:07,188
<i>in order to obey an order?</i>

215
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:08,289
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

216
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,791
<i>Crown Prince, follow me!</i>

217
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,210
<i>You worthless brat.</i>

218
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,113
<i>Do you know what disaster
you're rushing into?</i>

219
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:33,514
<i>I...</i>

220
00:15:33,915 --> 00:15:36,317
<i>only want to protect Scholar Heo.</i>

221
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:38,219
<i>Protect him?</i>

222
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:42,423
<i>Do you know how many
people you've hurt today?</i>

223
00:15:42,423 --> 00:15:45,726
<i>Just by showing your true feelings
in front of all those people,</i>

224
00:15:45,726 --> 00:15:47,328
<i>Heo Yeom and his father,
Heo Yeong Jae...</i>

225
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:49,931
<i>have both become political targets.</i>

226
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:51,632
<i>That's two people.</i>

227
00:15:51,632 --> 00:15:54,435
<i>Furthermore, they'll start to question
your abilities as future King.</i>

228
00:15:54,535 --> 00:15:56,037
<i>That makes three.</i>

229
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:59,140
<i>Because of you, all your attendants
will be held accountable,</i>

230
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:03,945
<i>and the common people of Joseon who will
someday have to suffer under your rule.</i>

231
00:16:03,945 --> 00:16:07,248
<i>If you add all these together,</i>

232
00:16:07,248 --> 00:16:10,051
<i>it's enough to topple the
whole of Joseon.</i>

233
00:16:10,051 --> 00:16:12,653
<i>If you let your personal feelings
affect your decisions,</i>

234
00:16:12,653 --> 00:16:14,956
<i>just who can you protect?</i>

235
00:16:14,956 --> 00:16:20,560
<i>Then, do you simply want
me to be a bystander?</i>

236
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,463
<i>If I don't do anything,</i>

237
00:16:22,463 --> 00:16:24,165
<i>don't change anything,</i>

238
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:26,267
<i>don't protect anything,</i>

239
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:30,771
<i>and simply follow the usual rituals,
being powerless and feeble,</i>

240
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:34,976
<i>is that how you want me to live?</i>

241
00:16:35,576 --> 00:16:37,178
<i>The so-called King,</i>

242
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:41,382
<i>don't tell me that's
all there is to it.</i>

243
00:16:41,982 --> 00:16:44,986
<i>The more you want to protect,</i>

244
00:16:45,486 --> 00:16:47,688
<i>the more will be hurt.</i>

245
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:50,691
<i>The more you try to obtain
the thing you want,</i>

246
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:52,994
<i>the more you will lose.</i>

247
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:56,197
<i>This will someday,</i>

248
00:16:56,998 --> 00:17:00,201
<i>be your fate when you
sit on the throne.</i>

249
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:04,205
<i>If you really want to protect,
you mustn't expose any weaknesses.</i>

250
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:09,410
<i>If you want to gain one thing,
you must give up the other.</i>

251
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:12,813
<i>Only then can you achieve
your goal.</i>

252
00:17:12,813 --> 00:17:15,516
<i>You must lose one to gain one.</i>

253
00:17:15,816 --> 00:17:17,418
<i>This is...</i>

254
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,721
<i>politics.</i>

255
00:17:22,223 --> 00:17:28,729
<i>Then, Your Majesty,
what did you choose?</i>

256
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:32,333
<i>What did you gain,</i>

257
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,336
<i>and what did you lose?</i>

258
00:17:35,937 --> 00:17:39,740
<i>I lost a loyal subject but
preserved his safety.</i>

259
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:44,445
<i>I lost Prince Yang Myeong
but was able to protect you.</i>

260
00:17:45,446 --> 00:17:48,850
<i>I lost the Crown Princess,</i>

261
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,854
<i>but was able to protect
your sister, Min Hwa.</i>

262
00:17:52,954 --> 00:17:54,555
<i>I...</i>

263
00:17:54,956 --> 00:17:57,458
<i>won't do it the same way.</i>

264
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,460
<i>I only want to do it the right way.</i>

265
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,663
<i>Even if I had to put everything on the line,
I would still choose to protect it.</i>

266
00:18:02,763 --> 00:18:08,469
<i>If it's something I feel is wrong,
I will give up any gain.</i>

267
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,572
<i>My Joseon,</i>

268
00:18:12,773 --> 00:18:15,276
<i>will be like this.</i>

269
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:41,702
<i>Have you already forgotten
your resolution,</i>

270
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,106
<i>to change the way the nation's
affairs are managed?</i>

271
00:18:45,106 --> 00:18:48,910
<i> Are these your so-called politics?
Don't tell me you've forgotten?</i>

272
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:54,015
<i>Let all things and all people
return to their rightful position.</i>

273
00:18:54,415 --> 00:18:56,417
<i>Let those who aren't qualified
for their current position,</i>

274
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:59,120
<i>return it to those who are entitled.</i>

275
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,622
<i>This is the task of the future King.</i>

276
00:19:01,722 --> 00:19:03,324
<i>This is the path you should follow.</i>

277
00:19:03,324 --> 00:19:06,027
<i>Don't tell me you've already
forgotten it?</i>

278
00:19:31,452 --> 00:19:34,155
Didn't he say where he was going?

279
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:36,757
Your humble servant doesn't know.

280
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:41,963
Orabeoni.

281
00:19:43,064 --> 00:19:45,366
I trust that you've been well
since we last met.

282
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,975
I heard from Mother that your
health had greatly improved.

283
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:56,978
But why does your face look so dark?

284
00:19:57,778 --> 00:19:59,280
Min Hwa.

285
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,782
Yes, Orabeoni.

286
00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:06,387
Teacher Heo,

287
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:11,292
did you really want him that much?

288
00:20:11,492 --> 00:20:12,894
What?

289
00:20:13,494 --> 00:20:15,296
Is that why,

290
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:19,400
you did such a cruel thing?

291
00:20:19,901 --> 00:20:22,503
Cruel thing?

292
00:20:23,604 --> 00:20:28,009
What are you... referring to?

293
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:30,411
Teacher Heo's sister.

294
00:20:30,511 --> 00:20:32,113
What?

295
00:20:41,222 --> 00:20:45,927
I don't know...
what you are talking about.

296
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:47,728
Why?

297
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:51,132
Why did you do it?

298
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:55,036
Why were you involved in the
curse on the Crown Princess?

299
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:56,637
Why?

300
00:21:05,446 --> 00:21:07,648
For my husband and his family,

301
00:21:07,848 --> 00:21:10,751
please help protect my secret.

302
00:21:11,552 --> 00:21:13,955
For the sin that I've committed,

303
00:21:13,955 --> 00:21:16,157
I'm very sorry.

304
00:21:16,357 --> 00:21:17,959
But...

305
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,062
My husband and his family...

306
00:21:21,162 --> 00:21:22,864
Please!

307
00:21:23,164 --> 00:21:25,066
Please!

308
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:31,172
Lift up... your head.

309
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:35,176
I told you to lift up your head!

310
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:43,784
Do you... Do you know...

311
00:21:43,784 --> 00:21:46,787
Do you know what kind of
disaster you have caused?

312
00:21:46,787 --> 00:21:49,190
With those same eyes,

313
00:21:52,393 --> 00:21:54,595
the same voice,

314
00:21:56,998 --> 00:21:59,500
and also the same words,

315
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:06,407
Father once said that
to me too.

316
00:22:06,507 --> 00:22:10,711
<i>Please save me, Father.</i>

317
00:22:10,711 --> 00:22:13,514
<i> Do you know what kind of
disaster you have caused?</i>

318
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:15,716
<i>I didn't know.</i>

319
00:22:15,716 --> 00:22:19,921
<i>I really didn't know.</i>

320
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:27,328
<i> It was Grandmother who
told me to just sit there.</i>

321
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:33,935
<i> She said just by doing that
I could marry Teacher Heo.</i>

322
00:22:35,636 --> 00:22:41,742
<i>I really didn't know
that it would kill Yeon U.</i>

323
00:22:46,847 --> 00:22:50,151
<i>Listen carefully to what
I'm going to say now.</i>

324
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:52,053
<i>This matter,</i>

325
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:56,057
<i>must not be made
known to anyone.</i>

326
00:22:56,057 --> 00:22:58,860
<i>Until you die,</i>

327
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,163
<i> you mustn't speak a word of it.</i>

328
00:23:02,563 --> 00:23:05,066
<i>Do you understand?</i>

329
00:23:06,868 --> 00:23:11,272
<i>At that time I only replied
I didn't know.</i>

330
00:23:11,272 --> 00:23:12,874
Because...

331
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:15,076
Because I really didn't know.

332
00:23:15,076 --> 00:23:17,178
Afterwards,

333
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:21,282
seeing my husband sitting
in his sister's room so often,

334
00:23:21,682 --> 00:23:25,887
crying tears of blood, I...

335
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:30,992
I...

336
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:37,899
realized the impact of what I had done.

337
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:42,803
You've committed an unpardonable
sin against our late father.

338
00:23:42,803 --> 00:23:47,208
You've committed a mortal sin
against the late Chief Scholar,

339
00:23:47,308 --> 00:23:51,312
and against myself and Yeon U.

340
00:23:52,813 --> 00:23:58,819
All of these sins, exactly how
are you going to pay for them?

341
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,424
By what means will you be able
to redeem yourself?

342
00:24:03,424 --> 00:24:07,228
Even if I go back to that time,

343
00:24:07,228 --> 00:24:09,330
I...

344
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:14,435
I would still choose my husband.

345
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:18,139
Even if there's retribution
in the future,

346
00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:21,642
even if I'm engulfed in the
fires of hell after death,

347
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,947
the choice I made then,

348
00:24:25,947 --> 00:24:29,150
I will have no regret.

349
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,553
I will abandon you.

350
00:24:32,553 --> 00:24:34,856
Only by abandoning you,

351
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:40,161
only in this way, can the others
that were involved be punished.

352
00:24:40,261 --> 00:24:41,262
But you...

353
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:44,665
I will gladly accept my punishment.

354
00:24:44,765 --> 00:24:48,469
But, my husband...

355
00:24:51,472 --> 00:24:54,575
And within my womb...

356
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,980
is my husband's child.

357
00:24:59,981 --> 00:25:03,284
Please don't abandon them.

358
00:25:08,589 --> 00:25:11,292
Just now,

359
00:25:11,592 --> 00:25:14,295
what did you say?

360
00:25:21,903 --> 00:25:25,206
I should leave.

361
00:25:27,508 --> 00:25:31,712
My husband is still waiting for me.

362
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:40,781
Princess.

363
00:26:40,982 --> 00:26:42,884
Husband.

364
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,786
Why are you like this?

365
00:26:46,787 --> 00:26:49,090
Could it be that at the physician,

366
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,393
you heard some bad news?

367
00:26:52,693 --> 00:26:56,497
So, what was the result
of your examination?

368
00:26:56,697 --> 00:26:58,599
I...

369
00:27:00,701 --> 00:27:03,604
have your child,

370
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:08,109
within me.

371
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,911
What?

372
00:27:15,316 --> 00:27:17,418
How terrible of me,

373
00:27:17,518 --> 00:27:19,820
I should have known.

374
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,822
How could I be so oblivious?

375
00:27:21,822 --> 00:27:24,125
It's nothing.

376
00:27:25,326 --> 00:27:28,629
I didn't know either.

377
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:30,631
It's just that...

378
00:27:30,631 --> 00:27:34,936
"It's just", what?

379
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,143
I have something,

380
00:27:44,145 --> 00:27:49,550
to say to you.

381
00:27:51,953 --> 00:27:56,557
Yes, please speak.

382
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,063
Actually...

383
00:28:05,566 --> 00:28:08,369
Actually...

384
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,672
Don't tell me

385
00:28:11,672 --> 00:28:15,376
this isn't what you wanted?

386
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,082
No,

387
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:25,586
this is what I have always wanted.

388
00:28:30,391 --> 00:28:32,193
Thank you.

389
00:28:32,193 --> 00:28:35,696
No, just saying "thank you"

390
00:28:35,696 --> 00:28:39,000
isn't enough to express my feelings.

391
00:28:40,101 --> 00:28:41,502
Also,

392
00:28:41,602 --> 00:28:43,704
I'm always receiving your kindness,

393
00:28:43,704 --> 00:28:46,807
but I'm unable to repay you.
I'm really sorry.

394
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:48,609
From now on I'll return your kindness.

395
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:52,914
I'll be able to face my father proudly.

396
00:28:52,914 --> 00:28:54,815
You are really wonderful.

397
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:57,418
In the future I'll work harder,

398
00:28:57,418 --> 00:29:01,122
and return your kindness.

399
00:29:03,824 --> 00:29:05,326
Don't be like this.

400
00:29:05,426 --> 00:29:08,329
The child will be scared.

401
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,462
It's a son.

402
00:29:41,462 --> 00:29:44,365
Like his father he'll be clever,

403
00:29:44,465 --> 00:29:49,570
exceptionally wise, and noble with
unquestionable integrity.

404
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:53,875
He'll be a rare pillar for the nation.

405
00:30:03,584 --> 00:30:06,587
Eonni, what is it?

406
00:30:08,189 --> 00:30:11,192
Did I say something wrong again?

407
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:13,394
So, as I said...

408
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:16,197
That's why I told you not
to go there again.

409
00:30:16,197 --> 00:30:18,499
Why did you not listen?

410
00:30:18,499 --> 00:30:22,803
My young master is so pitiful,
what can be done?

411
00:30:22,803 --> 00:30:26,507
The woman who killed his sister
is now bearing his child.

412
00:30:26,507 --> 00:30:27,909
How can such a thing happen?

413
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,211
Be quiet!

414
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:33,414
You shouldn't have told me.

415
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:37,118
You were the one who threatened me
that if I didn't tell you the whole truth,

416
00:30:37,318 --> 00:30:41,822
you would immediately run to the
palace and reveal everything.

417
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,524
That was why I told you.

418
00:30:43,624 --> 00:30:46,327
But you still shouldn't have told me.

419
00:30:46,527 --> 00:30:49,230
Our Agassi and Young Master
are just so pitiful.

420
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:55,236
What can be done?

421
00:31:06,247 --> 00:31:07,949
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

422
00:31:11,152 --> 00:31:12,653
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

423
00:31:12,854 --> 00:31:15,356
<i>May I enter?</i>

424
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:21,162
No, you can't.

425
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:25,466
I...

426
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:28,169
can't face you.

427
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:36,777
I swore to find the people who had
done this to you, and then punish them.

428
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,680
But...

429
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:47,588
those responsible turned out to
be my own flesh and blood.

430
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:52,193
Those who placed the curse,

431
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:55,296
the people who killed you,

432
00:31:55,396 --> 00:31:58,900
and those who covered up
the truth about your death,

433
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,303
are all my flesh and blood.

434
00:32:03,204 --> 00:32:11,412
What right do I have to face you?

435
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:45,246
You once asked me why I didn't reveal
that I had regained my memories.

436
00:32:46,347 --> 00:32:50,952
It was because I was afraid
it would turn out like this.

437
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,956
That you would be terribly hurt.

438
00:32:57,258 --> 00:33:01,462
I was afraid you would never
want to see me again.

439
00:33:01,662 --> 00:33:04,765
For you to have been
hurt this way...

440
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:09,770
it can be said it's actually
because of me.

441
00:33:09,871 --> 00:33:12,673
If you say it like that,

442
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:17,780
I'll blame myself for still
being alive.

443
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,786
What should I do?

444
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:31,292
Please continue to conceal
the truth.

445
00:33:31,492 --> 00:33:34,094
If Orabeoni discovers the truth,

446
00:33:34,295 --> 00:33:37,098
it will be very hard on him.

447
00:33:37,197 --> 00:33:44,005
Don't you feel wronged having
to hide all these years?

448
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:49,911
Don't you feel hurt having
to suffer all those years?

449
00:33:50,011 --> 00:33:58,119
It's precisely that pain and anguish
I don't want to share with Orabeoni.

450
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:01,621
Do you only know how to feel
pity for your brother?

451
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:05,426
Don't you also feel pity for me?

452
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,530
If you're not the Queen,

453
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:13,834
I will have to embrace another woman.

454
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:17,438
Am I not pitiful to you?

455
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:22,643
How can you not feel pity for me?

456
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,264
<i>Did you say Onyang Palace?
(Onyang Palace - royal vacation
residence with hot springs)</i>

457
00:34:43,464 --> 00:34:44,866
That's right.

458
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:46,868
Although Spring is approaching soon,

459
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:49,770
the mornings and evenings are
still very cool.

460
00:34:49,871 --> 00:34:54,675
Compared to the palace, this will be
a more suitable place for your care.

461
00:34:54,876 --> 00:34:59,480
Is it really for the sake of my health that
you want me to go to Onyang Palace

462
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,381
or--

463
00:35:00,481 --> 00:35:03,885
It's time for you to let go
of your political power

464
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:06,687
and I advise you to now
rest in comfort.

465
00:35:06,787 --> 00:35:10,091
This is definitely not possible,
Your Majesty.

466
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:13,794
There is no one who can
remove me from this position.

467
00:35:13,995 --> 00:35:17,598
Then, please make your choice.

468
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,800
Either go to Onyang Palace
according to my advice,

469
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:23,504
or appear at the Interrogation Hall

470
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:26,507
and stand trial.

471
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,210
Interrogation Hall?

472
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,913
A trial?

473
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:33,414
Exactly what serious crime
have I committed

474
00:35:33,614 --> 00:35:35,917
for you to actually say
such a thing?

475
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:38,019
Eight years ago...

476
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:41,322
the crime of killing the
innocent Crown Princess.

477
00:35:41,422 --> 00:35:43,224
Please produce the evidence.

478
00:35:43,324 --> 00:35:47,428
Also, the crime of using your granddaughter
in a spell as an accomplice in that act.

479
00:35:47,528 --> 00:35:49,330
Please produce the evidence.

480
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:53,334
Please don't confuse me with my Father.

481
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:55,536
Your Majesty.

482
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:58,940
To determine the guilt in this matter,

483
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,243
I will not make any exceptions,
regardless of our family relationship.

484
00:36:02,443 --> 00:36:06,047
So, I ask you to set aside everything

485
00:36:06,147 --> 00:36:08,549
and go to the Onyang Palace.

486
00:36:08,649 --> 00:36:14,455
This is... all the consideration
I can give you as your grandson.

487
00:36:14,555 --> 00:36:18,059
Your Majesty, what do you think
you can achieve through this?

488
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:22,663
Justice. I only hope for this one word.

489
00:36:22,864 --> 00:36:27,969
Your Majesty, there'll still be a time
where you'll need me. Don't you know that?

490
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:30,972
You said there'll be punishment for
those who go against the natural order.

491
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:36,077
So... we can only let nature
take its course.

492
00:36:36,177 --> 00:36:37,879
Your natural course Grandmother

493
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:40,181
is to keep things as they are.

494
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:43,885
My path is to correct that
which is wrong.

495
00:36:44,085 --> 00:36:45,786
So...

496
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:50,791
I will restore everything to
its rightful place.

497
00:36:50,992 --> 00:36:55,196
Your Majesty, you can't treat me like this.

498
00:36:55,396 --> 00:37:02,803
I won't be there to see you off tomorrow.

499
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:07,708
Please stay healthy.

500
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:19,921
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

501
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:24,225
Your Majesty, your position
on the throne...

502
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:29,330
Don't tell me you don't know
who made it possible?

503
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,133
That was me!

504
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:36,437
It was me, your Grandmother!
For the sake of Your Majesty...

505
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:44,345
I got blood on my hands in order
to secure your position!

506
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:47,048
Now you want me to go to Onyang Palace?

507
00:37:47,248 --> 00:37:50,451
How can you ask me to give up my position?

508
00:37:50,651 --> 00:37:53,254
This is impossible!

509
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:59,961
This cannot be! You can't...

510
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,468
Your Highness.

511
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,973
Your Highness! Your Highness!
Your Highness!

512
00:38:12,173 --> 00:38:14,475
Quickly summon the
Royal Physician! Quickly!

513
00:38:14,675 --> 00:38:18,880
<i>Your Highness!
Your Highness!</i>

514
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,082
Why the sudden departure
to Onyang Palace?

515
00:38:21,182 --> 00:38:22,783
They said it's for a long vacation.

516
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:26,687
In truth, it's said that he asked his
own Grandmother to step down.

517
00:38:26,787 --> 00:38:28,689
He is so disrespectful.

518
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:31,692
This is the same as declaring war
against us.

519
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:35,096
If His Majesty already knows
the whole truth,

520
00:38:35,496 --> 00:38:38,199
and has decided to draw
his sword against us,

521
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,903
he will quickly eliminate us all.

522
00:38:42,303 --> 00:38:44,805
Since His Majesty has drawn his sword,

523
00:38:45,006 --> 00:38:49,010
none of us will be able to live.

524
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:52,013
What should we do about
this matter, Minister?

525
00:38:52,213 --> 00:38:57,118
Then, our only option is to strike first.

526
00:38:57,218 --> 00:38:58,719
You say we should strike first...

527
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,824
"If the temple is not to your liking,
then just get the monks to leave."

528
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,626
But,

529
00:39:05,726 --> 00:39:11,933
with so many monks, is there really
a need to force them all to leave

530
00:39:12,033 --> 00:39:15,736
when the problem can be solved
with just a change of abbot.

531
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:18,139
Isn't that right?

532
00:39:30,151 --> 00:39:33,054
Are you leaving now?

533
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:37,558
The wound is almost healed.

534
00:39:37,758 --> 00:39:42,663
I'm not a Buddhist, so there's no
reason for me to remain here.

535
00:39:42,864 --> 00:39:47,869
Can you come with me for a walk?

536
00:39:56,777 --> 00:39:58,379
Prince Yang Myeong.

537
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,782
Yes.

538
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,785
I won't waver.

539
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,687
I also won't break.

540
00:40:06,787 --> 00:40:11,092
Live however you wish.

541
00:40:15,596 --> 00:40:17,999
From now on,

542
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:23,304
you should follow your own heart
and mind Prince Yang Myeong,

543
00:40:23,704 --> 00:40:25,606
and live your own life.

544
00:40:25,606 --> 00:40:29,110
Are you being sincere?

545
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,512
Because I believe in you,
Prince Yang Myeong.

546
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:38,920
Because I believe you
will make the right decisions.

547
00:40:40,821 --> 00:40:46,127
Believe. Do you know how
scary this word is?

548
00:40:46,127 --> 00:40:51,732
Prince Yang Myeong,
everything shall pass.

549
00:40:53,334 --> 00:40:57,038
Just like the passing of time,
the seasons also change accordingly.

550
00:40:57,038 --> 00:41:02,143
One day, sadness will
also disappear.

551
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:08,449
Furthermore, an even better marriage,
predestined by fate, awaits you.

552
00:41:10,351 --> 00:41:15,957
No matter what experiences you
may face in the future, Prince Yang Myeong,

553
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,660
no matter what choices
you make in life,

554
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,564
as your mother, I truly believe
in you Prince Yang Myeong.

555
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:28,369
Did you say no matter
what I choose?

556
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:34,275
Yes. No matter what you choose.

557
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,103
Lord Yang Myeong!

558
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,406
Why are you gathering here
in the cold weather?

559
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:07,408
Please don't be concerned.

560
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,511
Your servant is here to
pay his respects.

561
00:42:11,512 --> 00:42:18,019
Paying respects at such a late hour,
let's go inside and speak.

562
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:25,726
Presently, our King is still
young and incompetent.

563
00:42:25,726 --> 00:42:28,729
Inside and outside the Imperial Court
there has been restlessness.

564
00:42:28,729 --> 00:42:31,232
Seeing that the country's future
will soon be in disorder,

565
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:34,635
your subjects are very concerned.

566
00:42:35,236 --> 00:42:37,538
It is not simply the fact
that there is no heir,

567
00:42:37,538 --> 00:42:39,941
up until now there has been
no consummation of marriage.

568
00:42:39,941 --> 00:42:42,343
The people are beginning to worry.

569
00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:44,845
The concern is groundless

570
00:42:44,845 --> 00:42:47,348
as His Majesty is still young

571
00:42:47,348 --> 00:42:50,651
and his royal body is healthy.

572
00:42:51,252 --> 00:42:53,454
What is it that you're worrying about?

573
00:42:53,454 --> 00:42:55,556
His Majesty should naturally be healthy,

574
00:42:55,556 --> 00:43:00,561
but, there should be precautions
in case anything happens.

575
00:43:01,762 --> 00:43:03,865
Be prepared?

576
00:43:04,765 --> 00:43:05,666
That's not bad.

577
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,169
Don't you feel it is unfair
that you are passed over?

578
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:12,473
In truth, in terms of being able to rule
you are more than capable.

579
00:43:12,473 --> 00:43:14,475
There's no one else but you.

580
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,478
The qualifications of a king.

581
00:43:17,478 --> 00:43:21,182
What you are saying is not only
outrageous. It's also very dangerous.

582
00:43:25,286 --> 00:43:29,190
So, what exactly are you saying?

583
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,893
If the king is unable to produce an heir,

584
00:43:31,893 --> 00:43:34,595
there will be disorder in the selection
of the next successor.

585
00:43:34,996 --> 00:43:37,999
Won't it be too late if we sit and
wait for something to happen?

586
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:46,507
So, what should I do?

587
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:52,013
His Majesty is still healthy and well,

588
00:43:53,414 --> 00:43:57,318
yet you are already discussing
the next successor.

589
00:44:14,135 --> 00:44:19,040
Look at the line of this sword.
Isn't it beautiful?

590
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,741
Y... Yes... it is.

591
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:28,749
It's a pity this precious sword will have
to be stained by the blood of pesky flies.

592
00:44:33,154 --> 00:44:35,656
Whose head should it start with?

593
00:44:36,357 --> 00:44:39,460
If I present your traitorous head to His Majesty,

594
00:44:39,861 --> 00:44:41,662
I wonder how much the reward will be?

595
00:44:41,662 --> 00:44:44,165
How can you say that we're traitors?
When did we...

596
00:44:44,165 --> 00:44:46,267
You've misunderstood, Prince Yang Myeong.

597
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:51,572
Do you want me to cut out your long, treacherous
tongue first as an example to warn others?

598
00:44:52,573 --> 00:44:56,077
Please don't misunderstand. We speak
only out of worry for this country.

599
00:44:56,077 --> 00:44:57,378
Let's just go.

600
00:44:59,881 --> 00:45:02,984
If you dare to speak such
nonsense again,

601
00:45:07,388 --> 00:45:12,593
your head and body will part forever.

602
00:45:15,396 --> 00:45:17,098
Seems like it's not possible.

603
00:45:17,098 --> 00:45:20,501
When he unexpectedly invited us into his
house I thought he had changed his mind.

604
00:45:20,501 --> 00:45:23,804
But, I almost lost my head.

605
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:30,211
Then again, it would have been
boring if he'd taken the bait so easily.

606
00:45:34,115 --> 00:45:37,518
So, is this everything?

607
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,920
That...

608
00:45:40,021 --> 00:45:45,226
<i>Who is the main conspirator?
Go and tell him</i>

609
00:45:45,927 --> 00:45:49,730
<i>not to use others to test me.</i>

610
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:55,136
<i>If he has something to say,
say it directly to me.</i>

611
00:45:55,636 --> 00:45:57,939
I understand. You can leave now.

612
00:46:05,646 --> 00:46:09,450
However, why does it have
to be Prince Yang Myeong?

613
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:12,753
Prince Yang Myeong has always been
the most loyal person to His Majesty.

614
00:46:12,753 --> 00:46:16,858
Minister of Defense, can't you see the
reason behind such an obvious matter?

615
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:20,061
Then, Minister of Finance,
do you know?

616
00:46:20,261 --> 00:46:25,666
Since ancient times, a motive
is very important in everything.

617
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:28,870
He made such an effort to rescue
and escape with that girl,

618
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:32,073
but in the end, she was
taken by His Majesty.

619
00:46:32,573 --> 00:46:36,878
Even if it's the King, he would like
to turn everything upside down.

620
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:41,883
Then, for a mere girl, would he
go against the King?

621
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:47,088
Won't it be dangerous? Even though
they have differences in opinion,

622
00:46:47,088 --> 00:46:51,893
Prince Yang Myeong won't
betray His Majesty easily.

623
00:46:52,193 --> 00:46:59,400
Betrayal usually comes from amongst
the most trusted allies.

624
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,304
A tiny crack can destroy a dam.
A small misunderstanding can lead
to tragedy.

625
00:47:03,304 --> 00:47:06,207
If the King were to pass away,

626
00:47:06,207 --> 00:47:10,211
the next in line to the throne
will be Prince Yang Myeong,

627
00:47:10,611 --> 00:47:12,914
so he will naturally take
over the throne.

628
00:47:13,114 --> 00:47:14,215
Moreover,

629
00:47:14,815 --> 00:47:17,218
if you want to replace the
country's king,

630
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:21,923
if the quality of the candidate
doesn't measure up,

631
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:24,025
how could we complete the task
with an unknown?

632
00:47:24,025 --> 00:47:27,528
But will Prince Yang Myeong
agree so easily?

633
00:47:28,729 --> 00:47:31,432
We have to find a way to
make him agree.

634
00:47:35,136 --> 00:47:36,437
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

635
00:47:37,038 --> 00:47:41,842
<i>Wouldn't you like to know what
your servant's last trump card is?</i>

636
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,862
Mother.

637
00:48:00,862 --> 00:48:03,164
Why are you visiting the
palace so frequently?

638
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:08,769
This child is our niece
who I told you about.

639
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:11,772
The Queen has been very depressed,

640
00:48:11,772 --> 00:48:14,775
so I brought this child to keep
her company.

641
00:48:14,775 --> 00:48:16,077
What is your name?

642
00:48:16,677 --> 00:48:18,379
My name is Gim Su Yeong.

643
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:20,681
Is this the first time you've
entered the palace?

644
00:48:21,082 --> 00:48:21,983
Yes.

645
00:48:22,884 --> 00:48:24,685
What do you think of it?

646
00:48:25,586 --> 00:48:27,688
The many layers of the
palace buildings

647
00:48:27,688 --> 00:48:31,792
are like guardians of the
King and Queen.

648
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:35,596
I now realize it's true about the
nine layers of the palace.

649
00:48:35,596 --> 00:48:39,500
If I could live in such
a beautiful palace,

650
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,302
it would be a wonderful thing.

651
00:48:41,302 --> 00:48:43,204
That is what I think.

652
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:48,409
Do you want to live inside
the palace?

653
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:49,610
Yes.

654
00:48:51,913 --> 00:48:55,116
Even though you are a girl,
you're quite outspoken.

655
00:48:56,617 --> 00:49:01,322
Then, would you like to
look around this palace?

656
00:49:01,722 --> 00:49:05,226
<i>Do you want to see the
royal palace?</i>

657
00:49:06,427 --> 00:49:07,228
<i>What?</i>

658
00:49:07,228 --> 00:49:13,034
<i>If you want to,
I can let you live there.</i>

659
00:49:17,438 --> 00:49:18,439
Your Majesty.

660
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:42,163
Although she's young,
she's very sensible and clever.

661
00:49:42,163 --> 00:49:45,466
She will give you great comfort,

662
00:49:45,466 --> 00:49:47,368
so let her keep you company.

663
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:50,171
Mother.

664
00:49:53,674 --> 00:49:57,078
Father is going to abandon me.

665
00:49:58,779 --> 00:50:01,983
How can he abandon you,
Your Majesty?

666
00:50:04,285 --> 00:50:06,687
Why would you say such a thing?

667
00:50:07,488 --> 00:50:11,692
No...

668
00:50:11,692 --> 00:50:14,996
With father's character,
he is able to do it.

669
00:50:15,496 --> 00:50:20,401
If he feels I'm useless,
even if I'm his own daughter,

670
00:50:21,302 --> 00:50:23,704
he'll abandon me without
the slightest hesitation.

671
00:50:25,206 --> 00:50:30,511
But, who can replace you
in the position of Queen?

672
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:43,724
Court Lady Jo.

673
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:51,232
Please give your command, Madam.

674
00:50:52,033 --> 00:50:55,236
Take this child out for some tea.

675
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,953
Even if it is as you say,

676
00:51:11,953 --> 00:51:15,056
and this girl was brought into the
palace as an adopted daughter,

677
00:51:15,056 --> 00:51:18,259
she could only be a concubine.

678
00:51:18,759 --> 00:51:21,362
Moreover, His Majesty,

679
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:24,465
would not be interested
in such a young girl.

680
00:51:24,465 --> 00:51:26,968
If the one who sits on the
throne is changed,

681
00:51:32,273 --> 00:51:34,575
the situation will become different.

682
00:51:34,976 --> 00:51:39,280
The one who sits on the Royal Throne,
how can it change?

683
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:41,582
If it's father,

684
00:51:45,987 --> 00:51:48,289
anything is possible.

685
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:50,892
<i>My Lord.</i>

686
00:51:52,393 --> 00:51:53,594
What is it?

687
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,403
Someone has come to see you.

688
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:05,406
Didn't I say I don't want
to see anyone?

689
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:07,808
Thi... This...

690
00:52:08,109 --> 00:52:12,213
I, a lowly servant, don't dare
to offend this person.

691
00:52:32,433 --> 00:52:38,439
I came here to ask you to have
a drink with me, Prince Yang Myeong.

692
00:52:51,252 --> 00:52:55,056
Since the group of rats that came
earlier have prepared the way,

693
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:59,861
let's skip the small talk and
get to the main reason you're here.

694
00:53:03,064 --> 00:53:07,468
Honestly, don't you want
to be the Sun?

695
00:53:10,972 --> 00:53:13,174
The words that you've
just spoken, Prime Minister,

696
00:53:14,175 --> 00:53:17,478
do you really not know
what they signify?

697
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,683
How would I not know?

698
00:53:23,384 --> 00:53:24,685
Interesting.

699
00:53:27,388 --> 00:53:28,990
Why me?

700
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,893
Why not go and find some
other royal gentleman?

701
00:53:31,893 --> 00:53:36,397
Motivation and qualifications
are the most important.

702
00:53:36,998 --> 00:53:39,100
The motivation to be the king,

703
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,203
and the qualifications to be king.

704
00:53:44,705 --> 00:53:47,608
I'm just free-spirited.
What are my special qualifications?

705
00:53:47,608 --> 00:53:49,710
In addition, I have a tendency
to be dissolute.

706
00:53:50,111 --> 00:53:53,414
I'm afraid I would find that
being a king wouldn't suit me.

707
00:53:54,015 --> 00:53:55,816
Neither do I have the motivation.

708
00:53:57,218 --> 00:54:00,821
So you have no reason to
include me in your conspiracy.

709
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:05,626
All of this attitude is just to conceal
your ability to be king.

710
00:54:05,626 --> 00:54:07,628
How would I not know?

711
00:54:07,628 --> 00:54:11,432
Heavens! You already know?

712
00:54:11,432 --> 00:54:13,334
Then it should be clear that

713
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:16,237
I have no wish to be pulled
against the wind.

714
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:21,242
If you leave now, I'll keep
this a secret from His Majesty.

715
00:54:21,242 --> 00:54:26,547
Do you want to live your whole
life under his shadow?

716
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:32,854
Even if I have the motivation,
and the qualifications,

717
00:54:33,855 --> 00:54:36,457
there must be justification for rebellion.

718
00:54:36,457 --> 00:54:40,561
Justification can be easily produced.

719
00:54:40,561 --> 00:54:41,863
Such as?

720
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:44,765
Avoiding the responsibility
of producing an heir.

721
00:54:44,765 --> 00:54:48,669
He has made the nation waver,
making him an irresponsible King.

722
00:54:48,669 --> 00:54:51,272
In a country based on Confucianism,

723
00:54:51,873 --> 00:54:54,175
he lusted after a shaman and kept
her in his room.

724
00:54:54,175 --> 00:54:55,977
An absurd King.

725
00:54:55,977 --> 00:54:59,981
Not listening to his elders,
a useless King.

726
00:55:00,982 --> 00:55:04,886
This should be sufficient.

727
00:55:06,587 --> 00:55:10,791
That shaman is not an
ordinary shaman.

728
00:55:11,993 --> 00:55:16,497
She's the Crown Princess who died
8 years ago and was reborn.

729
00:55:17,198 --> 00:55:19,200
How dare you insult her in this way.

730
00:55:20,001 --> 00:55:24,005
Personally, don't you find
this too shameful?

731
00:55:25,506 --> 00:55:29,610
Seems like... you already knew this.

732
00:55:30,111 --> 00:55:32,213
I knew about it

733
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:35,016
because my brain works pretty well.

734
00:55:35,016 --> 00:55:38,419
So, you already knew,

735
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:42,423
but you still wanted to
possess the King's woman.

736
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:47,128
You must have known this
was too greedy of you.

737
00:55:52,533 --> 00:55:53,834
You've worked hard.

738
00:55:54,235 --> 00:55:56,837
Thanks to you, we were able
to unravel the mystery.

739
00:55:56,837 --> 00:55:58,139
I was honored.

740
00:55:58,139 --> 00:56:00,041
However, I'm afraid the details
of my investigation

741
00:56:00,041 --> 00:56:02,643
will make Your Majesty
even more uneasy.

742
00:56:02,643 --> 00:56:05,446
This was something I needed to
experience to understand the course of events.

743
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:08,249
Although I should reward you
for your efforts,

744
00:56:08,249 --> 00:56:10,451
there's something that is
more pressing at this moment.

745
00:56:10,451 --> 00:56:12,453
What is it that you need?

746
00:56:22,563 --> 00:56:26,767
Written in this secret decree
are the things you need to do,

747
00:56:26,767 --> 00:56:29,170
and the people you need to meet.

748
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:31,172
Once you have memorized it,
destroy it immediately.

749
00:56:31,172 --> 00:56:33,274
I will obey your order.

750
00:56:43,885 --> 00:56:48,689
Since I am ready to accuse them of
a crime, they will try to strike back.

751
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:52,593
Very soon they will begin to spread
rumors attempting to blacken my name.

752
00:56:53,194 --> 00:56:57,698
<i> I am afraid my presence has
become troublesome for Your Majesty.</i>

753
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:03,304
Is it possible you thought I would
just allow them to attack me.

754
00:57:04,405 --> 00:57:05,706
Just wait and see.

755
00:57:06,407 --> 00:57:11,913
An interesting story will begin to spread
amongst the people very soon.

756
00:57:16,017 --> 00:57:20,021
Do you want to take a walk?

757
00:57:33,334 --> 00:57:40,841
Actually, I prepared a gift
and hid it for you here.

758
00:57:41,842 --> 00:57:44,245
I already have everything.

759
00:57:44,745 --> 00:57:48,349
How could I dare to want
anything else?

760
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:53,654
I've already prepared it.
Go and look for it.

761
00:58:27,889 --> 00:58:30,191
Didn't you just say that
you didn't need other things?

762
00:58:30,191 --> 00:58:33,094
For a person who just said that,
aren't you looking a bit too eagerly?

763
00:58:34,795 --> 00:58:36,697
What is it exactly?

764
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:41,802
Could it be so small that it can't
be seen with the naked eye?

765
00:58:42,003 --> 00:58:44,405
Small? It's not small!

766
00:59:05,126 --> 00:59:06,227
Could it be...

767
00:59:08,529 --> 00:59:11,832
you want to give me
the Secret Moon Pavilion?

768
00:59:13,834 --> 00:59:15,336
You really do think big.

769
00:59:15,336 --> 00:59:16,237
It's not.

770
00:59:16,837 --> 00:59:18,539
Then what is it?

771
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:21,642
What I want to give you,

772
00:59:23,244 --> 00:59:26,147
in this world there is nothing
that can be exchanged for it.

773
00:59:26,547 --> 00:59:29,050
In the whole world there
is only one.

774
00:59:30,151 --> 00:59:32,453
Every woman would want it.

775
00:59:32,954 --> 00:59:34,055
The only one.

776
00:59:35,957 --> 00:59:37,158
Is it possible...

777
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:40,862
Seems like you've guessed.

778
00:59:43,364 --> 00:59:47,168
That's right, it's me.

779
00:59:51,772 --> 00:59:53,574
What is the meaning of that laugh?

780
00:59:53,774 --> 00:59:55,476
Don't tell me you think
that it's funny.

781
00:59:55,476 --> 00:59:58,179
How can I dare be
disrespectful towards you?

782
01:00:00,882 --> 01:00:02,683
It's because I'm happy.

783
01:00:03,784 --> 01:00:06,287
I laughed because I'm
so very happy.

784
01:00:15,596 --> 01:00:21,302
Haven't you already
given your heart to me?

785
01:00:21,402 --> 01:00:28,509
Therefore, I will give my whole
self to you.

786
01:00:30,311 --> 01:00:31,612
Your Majesty.

787
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:34,715
Could it be that you've
already given up?

788
01:00:34,815 --> 01:00:39,520
His Majesty will take the shaman
as his concubine soon.

789
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:44,625
Besides, didn't the former king treat you
and the King very differently?

790
01:00:44,725 --> 01:00:47,228
Didn't he mistreat you, Prince
Yang Myeong?

791
01:00:47,428 --> 01:00:50,131
Could you possibly have forgotten?

792
01:00:56,938 --> 01:00:59,040
Minister Yun.

793
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:02,343
You've completely miscalculated.

794
01:01:02,543 --> 01:01:04,645
Did you think that I, Yang Myeong,

795
01:01:04,745 --> 01:01:09,150
because of jealousy towards His Majesty,

796
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:14,655
would try to seize the throne?

797
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:18,559
I have no desire for the title of King.

798
01:01:18,659 --> 01:01:21,562
I don't wish to conspire against the King...

799
01:01:21,662 --> 01:01:24,365
for wealth, fame or power.

800
01:01:24,565 --> 01:01:27,268
Things like power,

801
01:01:27,368 --> 01:01:29,971
I don't need them.

802
01:01:30,071 --> 01:01:33,674
<i>With no ambition nor aspiration,
it's very disappointing.</i>

803
01:01:33,774 --> 01:01:35,676
<i>It leaves me no choice.</i>

804
01:01:35,776 --> 01:01:39,180
<i>A chess piece of no
use can only be given up.</i>

805
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,582
What I want...

806
01:01:43,985 --> 01:01:48,489
is my ancestral rites at
the Jongmyo Shrine...
(Jongmyo Shrine - Royal Ancestral Shrine)

807
01:01:48,689 --> 01:01:52,193
and Heo Yeon U.

808
01:01:55,296 --> 01:01:59,100
Only those two things.

809
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,653
~ <i>I hope it isn't love.</i> ~

810
01:02:02,653 --> 01:02:06,107
~ <i>I hope it isn't you.</i> ~

811
01:02:06,107 --> 01:02:13,214
~ <i>I hope that not even an inch
of my heart will allow it.</i> ~

812
01:02:13,214 --> 01:02:16,717
~ <i>My heart that is stained red</i> ~

813
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,162
I...
