1
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,050
If I have four cookies
and I ate two of them,

2
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,636
what portion did I eat?

3
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:57,140
You had four cookies,
and you ate two,

4
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,017
and then you got to cross-multiply that.

5
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,979
Four, two, wait.

6
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:06,107
Four, two. Four, 20...

7
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:10,194
You ate f...
you ate 50 percent of your cookie.

8
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,618
One of the saddest days of my life

9
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,371
was when my mother
told me Superman did not exist.

10
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:24,333
I was a comic book reader, and I read
comic books, and I just loved them.

11
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:29,380
'Cause even in the depths of the ghetto,
you just thought,

12
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:32,592
"He's coming, I just don't know when,
because he always shows up,

13
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,344
and he saves all the good people,
and they never end up..."

14
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,014
I was reading, I don't know maybe
I was in the fourth grade, fifth...

15
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:40,558
My mother... I was like, "You know, Ma,
you think Superman is up there?"

16
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,602
She said, "Superman is not real."

17
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,772
I was like, "He's not? What do you mean
he's not?" "No, he's not real."

18
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:50,026
And she thought I was crying because
it's like Santa Claus is not real.

19
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,403
And I was crying
because there was no one coming

20
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,572
with enough power to save us.

21
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,896
Every morning it's the same.

22
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:32,527
Juice, shoes, backpack,

23
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,738
the morning ritual.

24
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,825
And with it comes the uneasy feeling.

25
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,702
No matter who we are

26
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,956
or what neighborhood we live in,

27
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:49,043
each morning, wanting
to believe in our schools...

28
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,588
...we take a leap of faith.

29
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,480
In 1999, I made a documentary
about public school teachers...

30
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:10,773
- Plus?
- Plus.

31
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,900
- What number's that?
- Seven.

32
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,570
- One plus seven equals?
- Eight.

33
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,239
...and I spent an entire school year

34
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,992
watching them dedicate
their lives to children.

35
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,118
It's Friday.

36
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,287
You need to start doing better
on these tests, OK?

37
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,331
- So write these...
- These teachers embodied

38
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,585
a hope and carried with them a promise

39
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,963
that the idea of public school
could work.

40
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:41,262
Ten years later, it was time to choose
a school for my own children...

41
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,891
...and then reality set in.

42
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,520
My feelings about public education
didn't matter as much

43
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,982
as my fear of sending them
to a failing school.

44
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,986
And so every morning,

45
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,822
betraying the ideals
I thought I lived by,

46
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,491
I drive past three public schools

47
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,912
as I take my kids to a private school.

48
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:11,334
But I'm lucky. I have a choice.

49
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,797
Other families pin their hopes
to a bouncing ball,

50
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,759
a hand pulling a card from a box,

51
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:23,012
or a computer that generates
numbers in random sequence.

52
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,182
Because when there's
a great public school,

53
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,852
there aren't enough spaces,
and so we do what's fair:

54
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,522
We place our children and their future

55
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,941
in the hands of luck.

56
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:41,197
- Are you good at school?
- Yes.

57
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:47,078
- Tell me.
- School's like, at first,

58
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,705
I was having difficulties at school,

59
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,960
but then, that's because I
wasn't coming home and studying.

60
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:58,297
And then that's when I just started
to study and I started to pass.

61
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:02,009
And I stayed back one grade,
and that was in the second grade.

62
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,345
Why did you stay back?

63
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,347
- Why?
- Because I was go...

64
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,642
'Cause my father had passed.

65
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,728
- Yeah? Do you remember that?
- Yeah.

66
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:17,066
- What happened?
- He just died.

67
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,527
He took drugs.

68
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,257
Thank you.

69
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,519
OK, see you.
Have a good day. Have fun.

70
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,355
- OK. See you later.
- Be careful.

71
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,274
OK.

72
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,785
And what was your choice
in taking him in like?

73
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:14,123
There wasn't a choice. I mean,
I wouldn't have had it any other way.

74
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:21,297
You know, I made a lot of mistakes,
when I was younger, with my kids.

75
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:24,216
I don't know what I would do
without him, at this point.

76
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,635
What, you? He needs you.
Why do you need him?

77
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,972
I don't know.
I think we need each other.

78
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,851
I really think we needs each other.
I do.

79
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,563
And there's nothing
I wouldn't do for him. Nothing.

80
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,649
One, two, three, four.
We broke them up into thirds.

81
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:45,112
- Each circle represents what fraction?
- Three.

82
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,989
- Three what?
- Thirds.

83
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,824
Three-thirds. Three over three.

84
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:53,829
Someone raise your hand and tell me,
what is 12 divided by two?

85
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:58,084
- Twelve divided by two. Anthony.
- Six.

86
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,838
I want to... Well,
I have a lot of choices.

87
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:06,133
I want to be a nurse,
I want to be a doctor,

88
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,804
and I want to be a veterinarian.

89
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,514
How come?

90
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:16,852
Because I just love animals
and I would like to tell...

91
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,190
I would like to help
somebody in need.

92
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,025
How'd you get that idea?

93
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,153
I read books in the library.

94
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:44,046
When the Native Americans...
came to the river,

95
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,299
what was the difference between
when the settlers have it?

96
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:52,012
The settlers... the settlers
had put pollution in it

97
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,974
and the Native Americans
took care of it.

98
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,893
Good observation.
How do you mean "pollution"?

99
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:02,022
Because they would use...
throw all of, like,

100
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,026
they would throw all the
paper endings to the river.

101
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:10,030
She chose her college and she
wrote a letter to the admissions

102
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:14,577
and asking them to allow her
to attend their college.

103
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,579
- Already?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

104
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,248
She's already... she knows
what she's gonna do.

105
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,584
So, what would you say to me
if I was your classmate and I said,

106
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,712
"It's too boring,
and it's too much work.

107
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,590
I just want to quit school."
What would you tell me?

108
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,259
Well, pay attention
instead of being bored.

109
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,053
Just look at the teacher
and find different ways

110
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,682
to make the learning fun.

111
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,102
...two, three! Next.

112
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,104
Do you think that
Daisy could be a veterinarian?

113
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,814
Oh, yeah. If she wants to.

114
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,275
If she believes hard enough
that she could do it,

115
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,028
- yeah, I believe her.
- But she has to go to high school

116
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,238
and then college
and then medical school.

117
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,365
College. Medical school.
That's a long time.

118
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,369
I think... I believe that's
six, seven years, eight years.

119
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,830
- Yeah, in college.
- Think she can do it?

120
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:00,998
Yeah.

121
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,590
My dad's struggling.

122
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,009
He sort of doesn't have a job.

123
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,261
My mom's the one with the job,

124
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,764
and my dad is trying
to get a job right now.

125
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,978
Bye...

126
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:33,197
Good schools.
That's what all of us want,

127
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:38,035
but sometimes I wish someone would
tell me just what these words mean.

128
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,705
It seems that we all have
different ideas on the subject,

129
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:47,169
yet each of us feels that
he has the very best solution.

130
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,842
Now, I grew up
in the South Bronx in the '50s.

131
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:58,138
The school that I was supposed
to go to was Morris High School.

132
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,683
If I had gone to Morris High School,
I would not be sitting here today.

133
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,769
It was a horrible school.
It was a failure factory.

134
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,522
I went into this business,
I mean, literally,

135
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,149
straight out of college,
the first thing I did was teach.

136
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:13,112
I went to the Harvard Graduate School
of Education, majored in Education,

137
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,530
and I came out and I was ready.

138
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,490
And I figured it was gonna take
me all of maybe two and half

139
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,827
to three years, if I, you know,
wasn't on my A game,

140
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,288
to straighten out education
in the nation. And then...

141
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,540
You wanted to straighten out
the education in the nation?

142
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,583
In the nation! It was just...
it wasn't that hard.

143
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,711
I was like, nah, I figured it out.
I read the papers.

144
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,963
I understood, you know,
what was going on.

145
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,799
This is '75, right?
I figured by '77, '78,

146
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,469
I'd have this whole thing straightened
out. And then I ran into this system.

147
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,223
It seems to me we need
a great deal more information.

148
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,101
What do you think, Mr. Rice?

149
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,478
I'd like to suggest a committee.

150
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,065
You could not find
the sort of architects

151
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:53,485
of why this thing
was as bad as it was,

152
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,906
and yet nobody seemed to be willing
to really look at this and say,

153
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,408
"This thing is an utter failure."

154
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:03,620
I'd like for this country to have a real
education president for a change.

155
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,165
I'd like to be the education president.

156
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:10,586
I don't ever expect
to sign my name to any law

157
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:14,214
that is more important
than the Education Act of 1 965.

158
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:19,219
Our goal of quality education
is on a collision course

159
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,264
with the escalating demands
for the public dollar.

160
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,601
Since 1 971 ,
educational spending in the U.S.

161
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:30,105
has grown from $4,300
to more than $9,000 per student,

162
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,940
and that's adjusted for inflation.

163
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,859
...passage of tuition tax credits...

164
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,196
We must address
some very real problems.

165
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,073
...voluntary school prayer...

166
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,785
It is not just a money problem,
but it is a money problem.

167
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,788
...and abolishing the
Department of Education.

168
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,624
So we've doubled
what we spend on each child.

169
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,086
But double the money is worth it,
if we're producing better results,

170
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,463
unfortunately, we're not.

171
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,966
Since 1 971 ,
reading scores have flat-lined,

172
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,261
and math is no better.

173
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:05,766
As yesterday's positive report
card shows, childrens do learn.

174
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:09,478
The day of reckoning is here.

175
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,189
Do you like school?

176
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,650
- No.
- No?

177
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:18,987
'Cause sometimes math
is too hard for kids,

178
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,448
so kids say, "I don't like math!

179
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:25,869
I don't like math!"
And I say, "I like math."

180
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:30,958
- So you do kind of like school.
- Everybody says they don't like math.

181
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:36,004
And I... I'm the only
one who says, "I like math."

182
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,298
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

183
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:43,971
A recorder... like you guys.

184
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:52,729
Come on, Francisco. I don't hear you.

185
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:09,329
Francisco, that's
'cause you cut your hair.

186
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,791
I can use the spray.

187
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,336
Make sure you close your eyes.
Don't put it in your eyes.

188
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,763
I haven't been inside the school.
Describe it to me.

189
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,641
If I was to walk in the school,
what kind of feelings would I have?

190
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,769
- What would I see?
- Walking in, you'll see a desk

191
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:37,399
with a security guard. That's it.
You can go no further than that.

192
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:47,576
They're in the district that's the third
largest overcrowded school in the Bronx.

193
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,757
Public education, you know,
that's the only option we have here.

194
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,551
This is...

195
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,762
Kids look at the world
and they make certain

196
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,224
predictions based on the evidence

197
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,143
they are receiving from their peers,

198
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,229
from their parents
and from their teachers.

199
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,814
From their perspective,
the world is a heartless,

200
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,984
cold-blooded place, because
they realize they've been given

201
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:24,279
the short end of the stick,
and they don't know why.

202
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,964
Hi. It's Bianca's mom.
I'm around the corner.

203
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,383
I'll be there in a few minutes.

204
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,552
A, apple. B, bug. C...

205
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,345
Say it in sign language.

206
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,430
- D, dog. E... F...
- Hello?

207
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,600
Bianca, say it in sign language,
with your hands.

208
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,661
Come on.

209
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:19,251
Come on. Push it open.

210
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,672
I never did envision having children.

211
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,467
It's... It's something,
'cause they grow so fast,

212
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,803
and you just see so many
different things with them.

213
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,519
- Mail?
- It's my song.

214
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,024
Oh, you have to read these
out loud by yourself?

215
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,275
Yeah.

216
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,530
- When did she give this to you?
- Today.

217
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,494
I don't care what I have to do.

218
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,414
I don't care how many
jobs L have to obtain,

219
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:01,710
but she will go to college,
and there's just...

220
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,212
no second-guessing on that one.

221
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,176
"Take my apples, boy,
and sell them in the city.

222
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:13,472
Then you will have money,
and you will be happy..."

223
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,932
When you go to college, you learn,

224
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,560
you get your education,
and you don't get a job,

225
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,313
you get a career,
that there's a difference.

226
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,900
"...and the tree was happy."

227
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,823
In January of 2002,
after decades of empty lip service

228
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,076
and political bickering,
it seemed for a moment

229
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,204
that what had proved impossible
might suddenly be possible.

230
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,710
Two men, a conservative
Republican president

231
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,755
and a leader of the liberal
wing of the Democratic Party,

232
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,341
were ready to put aside their
partisan differences

233
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,135
for the sake of America's children.

234
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:58,100
America, the world's
only remaining superpower,

235
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,769
the nation that had
put a man on the moon,

236
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,438
was finally going to fix education.

237
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:07,234
And now it's up to you,
the local citizens of our great land,

238
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:10,737
to stand up and demand, no child,

239
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:14,741
not one single child in America,
is left behind.

240
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,120
It was a bold promise,

241
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,871
and to make good on that promise,

242
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,998
the architects of No Child Left Behind

243
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,876
decided to measure every
student in the country.

244
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:29,005
I understand taking tests aren't fun.
Too bad.

245
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,134
We need to know in America,

246
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,512
we need to know whether or not children
have got the basic education.

247
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,476
So now it's eight years later,

248
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,729
and we have four years left
to reach our goal:

249
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,190
1 00 percent proficiency
in math and reading.

250
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:52,320
In Alabama, only 1 8 percent of eighth
graders are proficient in math,

251
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:56,241
and next door in Mississippi,
it's only 1 4 percent.

252
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,910
And it's not just Southern states.

253
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,206
New Jersey, 40 percent.

254
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,167
Connecticut, 35 percent.

255
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,711
New York, 30 percent.

256
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,175
Arizona, 26 percent.

257
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,636
And in California,
just 24 percent of eighth graders

258
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,723
are proficient in math.

259
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:22,684
When eighth graders across the country
were tested for reading,

260
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:26,646
most scored between 20
and 35 percent of grade level.

261
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:32,319
The worst scores for reading
are in Washington, D.C.,

262
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,863
our nation's capital.

263
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,539
So you're a kid,
you're doing fine in school

264
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,167
till you hit the fourth grade,
fifth grade.

265
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,461
Between the fifth grade
and the seventh grade,

266
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,214
you see a huge number of minority kids

267
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:56,635
go from being B students
to D students.

268
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,512
Now, one of two things is happening.

269
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,389
Either the kids are getting
stupider every year, right?

270
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,476
Or something is wrong
in the education system.

271
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:09,105
But what do kids... So I'm ten,
I've been a good student.

272
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,817
I'm 11 , I'm a C student.

273
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,236
I'm 12, I'm a D student.

274
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,279
What do you think
I think is going on?

275
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:21,076
And I'm looking now, let's say,
I'm in the seventh grade.

276
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,536
I'm going nowhere.

277
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,832
No.

278
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:38,844
How was school for you?

279
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,138
It was good,
but I'm one of the guys that

280
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,683
dropped out of school
because of money.

281
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:50,063
My dad, my dad was getting
laid off every so often,

282
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:54,025
and money was needed in the house,
food was needed on the table.

283
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:27,434
I want to go to a medical college
or a veterinarian college

284
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:30,061
to study about people and animals,

285
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,148
because I really
want to become a surgeon.

286
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:39,863
Daisy's path to medical school
begins with eighth grade algebra,

287
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:43,283
which she'll need to take when she
moves up to Stevenson Middle School.

288
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,745
By the time she leaves Stevenson,

289
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:50,498
only 1 3 percent of her classmates
will be proficient in math.

290
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,667
I might go to Stevenson.

291
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,295
My sister goes there
and she says it's really fun,

292
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,798
just that people make
a big drama about it.

293
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,801
Stevenson feeds into Roosevelt,

294
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:05,013
one of the worst performing
high schools in Los Angeles.

295
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:08,016
The way that the California public
university system is set up

296
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:11,394
is there's a set of 1 5 courses
called the A through G,

297
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,313
that you have to meet

298
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,816
in order to be accepted
into a four-year university.

299
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,862
Only three out of
a hundred students at Roosevelt

300
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:26,076
will graduate with the classes necessary
for admission to a four-year university.

301
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:32,999
And 57 percent of Daisy's
classmates won't graduate.

302
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:42,342
We basically know which students are
gonna drop out in the next five years.

303
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,387
We know which schools they go to,
and with just a little bit of digging,

304
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,555
we can see them raising their hands
and saying, "Help."

305
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,559

00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,937
has been studying
schools like Roosevelt.

307
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:56,523
He calls these schools,
where over 40 percent

308
00:21:56,691 --> 00:22:00,402
of the students don't graduate
on time, "dropout factories."

309
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,033
Balfanz began to see a pattern:

310
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:11,204
in cities, suburbs and rural areas,

311
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,790
failing elementary and middle schools,

312
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:17,877
feeding poorly educated students
into local high schools,

313
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,588
where they last one or two years.

314
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:27,053
In his research, he found
over 2,000 dropout factories.

315
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:35,228
Locke High School in Los Angeles
was one of the worst.

316
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,817
In 2008, Steve Barr took control.

317
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,030
Between ninth
and tenth grade at this school,

318
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,991
they go from 1 ,200 freshmen
to 300 to 400 sophomores.

319
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,412
So, we lose, you know, 800 kids
between ninth and tenth grade.

320
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,626
They come in the ninth grade.
This school, the kids read somewhere

321
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,295
between a first
and third-grade reading level,

322
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,547
and they've been pushed
through the system.

323
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,177
This school's 40 years old.

324
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,221
I think about 60,000 people
have gone to this school in 40 years.

325
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,309
Sixty thousand.
Forty thousand didn't graduate.

326
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,478
So over 40 years,

327
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,105
this is the damage that this school
has done to this neighborhood.

328
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:23,693
To be 1 5 years old and a dropout,

329
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,987
they're not going
to write screenplays.

330
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:33,161
Millions of kids are walking the streets
who have no vested interest in living.

331
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,122
They dropped out of school.

332
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,459
They have no diplomas.
They have no skills.

333
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:42,003
And you could name
the places where the schools...

334
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:45,298
You can talk about Detroit,
East Baltimore,

335
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:48,426
Camden, South Central,
this has all been going, this has...

336
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,845
since I was a child and even before.

337
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,266
For generations,
experts tended to blame

338
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,311
failing schools
on failing neighborhoods.

339
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,315
But reformers have begun
to believe the opposite,

340
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,567
that the problems
of failing neighborhoods

341
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:07,779
might be blamed on failing schools.

342
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:17,872
Bill Strickland has seen this firsthand
in his own neighborhood.

343
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,543
- This it here?
- Yeah, this is Oliver High School.

344
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,880
He went to Oliver High School,
a dropout factory in Pittsburgh.

345
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:28,967
Most of the kids had no aspirations.

346
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,136
They had no clue where they were going.

347
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:39,894
So this is the State Correctional
Institution in Pittsburgh.

348
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,274
That's where a bunch of my buddies are.

349
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,778
Rather than getting on with their life,

350
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:51,906
the vast majority of the guys
end up here or dead.

351
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,702
Sixty-eight percent
of inmates in Pennsylvania

352
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,620
are high school dropouts.

353
00:24:57,788 --> 00:25:01,916
The state spends $33,000
a year on each prisoner...

354
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,672
...which makes the total cost
of the average prison term $1 32,000.

355
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:12,051
The average private school
cost $8,300 a year.

356
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,761
So, for the same amount,

357
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,181
we could have sent a prison
inmate to a private school

358
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,683
from kindergarten through 12th grade,

359
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:23,855
and still had over $24,000
left for college.

360
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,940
It's a very expensive hotel, man.

361
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,776
You gotta feed them
three meals a day.

362
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,780
You have to provide recreation.
You have to provide security.

363
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,116
You have to provide medical care.

364
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:39,495
These guys don't pay taxes.
They don't work.

365
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:44,083
It's money that goes one way only.

366
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,178
I'm just so afraid for him.

367
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:57,180
I cries for him sometime,

368
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:59,724
'cause I'm just so afraid. I am.

369
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,435
I pray about Ant all the time,

370
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:06,189
'cause I know he can easily
be influenced to do things

371
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:10,610
that he shouldn't do, and it scares me.

372
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,326
He never knew his mom.

373
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,828
Think his mom had other kids,

374
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,915
but Anthony doesn't know those kids.

375
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:32,090
My mom left me when
I was probably about eight,

376
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,384
so my grandparents raised me.

377
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,177
Was school important to you?

378
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,388
No. It wasn't.

379
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,849
Hey, it probably wasn't because
I never had nobody to push me,

380
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,979
you know, to talk to me
about stuff, so it wasn't.

381
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,857
And your son?

382
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:57,156
He didn't... He didn't think school
was important either. No.

383
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,201
He didn't.

384
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:03,204
But he did his thing, I guess.

385
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,750
I pledge allegiance to the flag

386
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:10,044
of the United States of America,

387
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,714
and to the republic
for which it stands,

388
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:16,259
one nation, under God, indivisible,

389
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:18,511
with liberty and justice for all.

390
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,889
It's the worst possible example of
public schooling in the United States.

391
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,059
You know, lots of districts
have certain things wrong with them.

392
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,728
D.C. has everything wrong with it.

393
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,104
Good morning, my friends.

394
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:31,024
Good morning, Miss Thomas.

395
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,735
Well, are you excited about
what we're gonna do today?

396
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,612
- Yes.
- We wanna get a good look

397
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,489
at what middle school
is gonna look like.

398
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,202
Kimball Elementary
has been struggling.

399
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,749
But with a good teacher this year,

400
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,376
Anthony is showing promise.

401
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:56,007
Next year, Anthony's
class will leave Kimball

402
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,592
and move up to junior high.

403
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,927
This is Sousa. It's a middle school.

404
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,679
This is basically our
neighborhood school.

405
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,057
So when our children leaves Kimball,

406
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,060
they would automatically
be enrolled in Sousa.

407
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,520
And we're gonna try to also...

408
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,440
Most will go to John Philip Sousa,

409
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:15,985
which the Washington Post
called "an academic sinkhole."

410
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:22,116
If Anthony goes to Sousa, odds are,
he will enter high school

411
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:25,370
three to five grade levels behind.

412
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:29,290
You wake up every morning
and you know that 46,000 kids

413
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,126
are counting on you,
and that most of them are getting

414
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,295
a really crappy education
right now,

415
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:37,632
and you have the ability
to do something about that.

416
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,966
So you think
that most of the kids in D.C.

417
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,802
are getting a crappy
education right now?

418
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,180
Oh, I don't think they are.
I know they are.

419
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,477
Within the last hour,
I signed a mayoral order

420
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:52,355
to appoint Michelle Rhee
as acting chancellor

421
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:55,149
of the District of
Columbia Public Schools.

422
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,985
In 2007, the education world
went into a frenzy

423
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:02,407
over the possibility that Michelle Rhee
and D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty

424
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,450
could actually turn around
the school district.

425
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:08,162
Just in case there was any confusion,
I am 37 years old,

426
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,249
and, no, I have never run
a school district before.

427
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:15,503
Fenty picked somebody
who had never gotten a Ph.D.,

428
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,463
who had only been
a teacher three years,

429
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:20,007
hadn't been a principal, hadn't
been a superintendent anywhere else,

430
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,968
and said she was going
to tear up the district.

431
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:25,471
All of the eyes in the country
are now on D.C.

432
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,104
I think we have
a strategy committee

433
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,355
- meeting later, right?
- Yeah.

434
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:35,690
- OK. I'll see you for that.
- OK.

435
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:36,858
Bye.

436
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,239
Michelle Rhee
is the seventh superintendent

437
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:46,200
of the D.C. schools in just ten years.

438
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:51,080
Each of her predecessors
promised radical change,

439
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:54,709
and that this time, they could
turn their schools around.

440
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:56,461
Lieutenant General Julius Becton,

441
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,379
who was awarded two Purple Hearts

442
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,923
and a Silver Star
for heroic acts in battle,

443
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,176
said he never faced
a more difficult task

444
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,720
than reforming the schools
of Washington.

445
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,514
Remember, children first.

446
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,892
Failure is not an option.

447
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,189
It should be simple:

448
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,442
a teacher in a schoolhouse,

449
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,235
filling her students with knowledge,

450
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,531
and sending them on their way.

451
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,492
But we've made it complicated.

452
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,245
Why is it that the same student
who fails a proficiency test

453
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:34,457
in Longmeadow, Massachusetts,
can drive a mile south

454
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:38,002
and pass a similar test
in Enfield, Connecticut?

455
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,380
Here's why: The federal
government passes laws

456
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,257
and sends money to the states,

457
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,551
but the states fund schools, too,

458
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:48,513
and set their own,
often-conflicting standards.

459
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,808
And there are more than 1 4,000
autonomous school boards...

460
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:57,104
...making school governance
a tangled mess

461
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,941
of conflicting regulations
and mixed agendas.

462
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,151
You've got local school boards,

463
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,779
people from the State
Departments of Education,

464
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,240
Federal Department of Education,

465
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,660
district superintendents
and their huge staffs.

466
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,412
The things we've done
to help our schools work better

467
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,082
have become the things
that prevent them from working.

468
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:20,878
This whole collection of people,
which is sometimes called "The Blob,"

469
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:25,341
like out of some horror movie,
has been an impediment to reform.

470
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:29,345
No individual is necessarily
to blame, but collectively,

471
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:32,974
they are the Goliath of the system.

472
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,351
Central Office is
this behemoth that all your

473
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,812
taxpayer dollars go to,
and it's what I lead.

474
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,314
It's this organization that I lead,
that's the Central Office.

475
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,650
The District gives the Central Office
a pile of money.

476
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:46,153
Right. The city government gives the
District of Columbia Public Schools,

477
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,699
the Central Office,
a pile of money, to your point.

478
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:54,412
And the Central Office then
proceeds to screw everything up.

479
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,415
Michelle Rhee's first move

480
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,668
would be to tackle the problems
of her vast bureaucracy.

481
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:06,841
I mean, this district did not become
the way that it is by accident.

482
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:11,262
There's a complete and utter
lack of accountability

483
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,139
for the job that
we're supposed to be doing,

484
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:16,350
which is producing results for kids.

485
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,191
Go, stop.

486
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:28,279
Go. Stop. Go.

487
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:35,911
This is only his second year there.

488
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,498
You know, first grade for him
has been very horrible.

489
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,254
Francisco hasn't had...

490
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:48,633
He hasn't been that
fortunate with teachers.

491
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,845
Maybe that attitude of him not liking
school comes from that, I think.

492
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:01,604
His teacher is telling me
that he has difficulty in reading.

493
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:04,774
The teacher said he wasn't being
focused and this and that.

494
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:09,737
That he's at risk of staying behind,
repeating first grade,

495
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:13,866
which I don't understand,
because I do work with him at home.

496
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,409
- Is this a bat?
- Bat or rat?

497
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,036
- Mommy?
- Rat.

498
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,788
- Mommy, this is subtracting?
- R.

499
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,623
- I don't have an "R."
- I don't know. You tell me.

500
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:23,834
- Sound it out.
- "...kinds of loads."

501
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:28,047
- Very good.
- "...this yellow car makes it go.

502
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:32,134
Go, go, go. Don't be slow.

503
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:35,513
- Beep, beep."
- Very good.

504
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,933
So when you stand there,
what's the feeling of the place?

505
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:43,521
Why bother? You know, it's like, why?

506
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:46,691
Why are my kids here? Why?
Why do I have to go through this?

507
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,192
There's a lot of why, whys,

508
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,945
and to the point where I get upset...

509
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:52,530
They have a van.

510
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:55,366
...and wishing I could
do better for my kids.

511
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,827
- Right there?
- Yeah. Did you tell Mr. Saxon

512
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,955
that Mommy said that
she needed your folder?

513
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:04,291
- Yeah, and I got it.
- OK. So he said that was OK?

514
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,210
- Yeah.
- OK.

515
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,046
- We're stuck.
- It doesn't seem fair.

516
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:12,508
It's not fair,
but this is where we live.

517
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,178
Yes, hi. My name is Mrs. Regalado,

518
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:20,307
and I would like to
leave a message for Mr. Saxon.

519
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,892
Thank you.

520
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,150
Yeah, I would just like to have a
teacher-parent conference with him.

521
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:34,280
After lots of studies, we come down
to just what most parents believe,

522
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:37,074
and that is a good teacher
is what's working

523
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,201
and a bad teacher
is what's not working.

524
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:42,329
Eric Hanushek has tracked the effect

525
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,874
of individual teachers
on groups of kids.

526
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:49,211
The difference between a really good
teacher and a really bad teacher

527
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:53,090
is one year of learning
per academic year.

528
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:57,678
Students with high-performing teachers
progressed three times as fast

529
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:00,014
as those with low-performing teachers,

530
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,933
and yet they cost
the same to the school.

531
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,770
A bad teacher covers only 50 percent

532
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,189
of the required curriculum
in a school year.

533
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:12,777
A good teacher can cover 1 50 percent.

534
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:25,372
They gave a kid a video camera,

535
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,792
and he put it in his book bag.

536
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,545
- What are we doing in here today?
- Nothing!

537
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:36,592
He videotaped kids shooting crap
in the back of the room.

538
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,346
He videotaped teachers
reading newspapers.

539
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:44,725
We had a teacher put
a kid's head in a soiled toilet.

540
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:49,230
- Where's our teacher at?
- They mic me up live,

541
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,315
turn on the television,

542
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,943
and I see all of this going on.
So, the guy asked me,

543
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,278
"What are you gonna do?"

544
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:57,738
I said,
"I'm gonna fire these people!"

545
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,032
My staff is in the back of
the room going like this, like,

546
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,159
"Man, you can't fire nobody.
You can't...

547
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:05,079
What, you can't say that."
I thought I was in charge.

548
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:08,916
Howard Fuller fired the worst teachers
in the video,

549
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:12,127
but was forced to rehire them
with a year's back pay

550
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,840
because of a provision in the
teachers' contract called "tenure,"

551
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,342
which guaranteed their jobs for life.

552
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,763
The idea of tenure
started in universities.

553
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:25,766
It was meant to protect professors
from getting fired

554
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,769
for arbitrary or political reasons.

555
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:31,814
In universities, professors
are only granted tenure

556
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,149
after many years of teaching

557
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:38,779
and a grueling vetting process,
and many don't receive it.

558
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:42,616
But for public school teachers,
tenure has become automatic.

559
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:47,538
Three, two, one. OK, children,
I've just been granted tenure.

560
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,791
So I'm gonna sit back
and let Ralph teach for a while.

561
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:58,007
Class, in what year was one plus one?

562
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,802
The answer is The Amazing Ralph!

563
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,973
You can get tenure basically
if you continue to breathe

564
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:09,894
for two years, you'll get it,
and whether or not you can help children

565
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,645
is totally irrelevant
to whether or not...

566
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,772
And once you get tenure,
we cannot get rid of you.

567
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,942
Almost no matter what you do,
you are there for life,

568
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,278
even if it's proven
you're a lousy teacher.

569
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:22,990
Are you gonna teach us anything,
or are we just gonna sit here?

570
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,117
Just do whatever you want.

571
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:28,245
- I wanna learn from my teacher.
- Besides that!

572
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,539
Look, if we were talking about people

573
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:33,250
who made Tastykakes, right, I'd say,

574
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,711
"Look, I'm worried
that they might get rid

575
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:38,964
of the poor people who put
the squiggles on Tastykakes."

576
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,508
I'm sure it's a machine.
"They ought to be protected

577
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,677
and we should make sure they
don't lose their job, right?"

578
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:46,472
American educators,
organizing into unions,

579
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,100
on strike against conditions
they consider no longer tolerable.

580
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,020
They used to be able to get away
with paying women teachers

581
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:56,190
very little money,
because their husbands worked,

582
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:59,068
and that's how teachers' unions started.

583
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,864
Teachers had
little protection or recourse

584
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,867
from a system that routinely
took advantage of them.

585
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:12,748
Teachers organized
because they're in that situation

586
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:18,045
where they're infantilized and told
what to do. And yet, in their classroom,

587
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,631
they know they have
these huge responsibilities,

588
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:24,343
and so they said, "Look, how
am I going to get the power?"

589
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,220
If you care about the students
you teach,

590
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,722
if you wanna make a difference
in their lives,

591
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,058
if you wanna advocate
for what they believe in,

592
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,560
you have to go
where the decision-makers are.

593
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,651
Taken together,

594
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:44,947
the two biggest teachers' unions,
the NEA and AFT,

595
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:49,243
are the largest campaign
contributors in the country.

596
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:53,205
Over the last 20 years,
they've given over 55 million dollars

597
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:56,500
to federal candidates
and their parties,

598
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,503
more than the Teamsters, the NRA

599
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,006
or any other individual organization,

600
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:06,427
and more than 90 percent of
this money goes to Democrats.

601
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,679
At the national level,

602
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:13,267
the Democratic Party
was a wholly owned subsidiary

603
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:16,979
of the teachers' unions
on education policy.

604
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:20,441
Now, at the state level,
where a lot of policy is made,

605
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:24,111
the Republican Party was also,
and continues to be,

606
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,697
very tied in with the teachers' unions.

607
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,575
We have often
been called a special interest,

608
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:33,120
and I will never apologize for that

609
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:36,707
because our special interests
are the students we teach.

610
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,585
They're worth fighting for

611
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:42,129
with every weapon in our arsenal.

612
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:44,923
I kept running into this issue of,

613
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,467
Hey, you know what?
I don't think we can do anything

614
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,927
unless we deal with the unions.

615
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,096
Nope, nope. That's off the table.

616
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:54,641
You can't even bring it up? No.
Why can't you even talk...?

617
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,435
No. Because it's off the table.

618
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:59,646
The mayors didn't wanna talk about it,
the folks at the state houses,

619
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,440
the governor, no one
wanted to bring this up.

620
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:04,985
The teachers' unions,
in general, have taken a position

621
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,154
that I don't think is
actually in their own interest,

622
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,740
but the position that they've taken is

623
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,201
that we shouldn't make any
distinctions among teachers.

624
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,328
A teacher is a teacher is a teacher.

625
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,580
So, this is

626
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,499
an evaluation process
for all teachers.

627
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:22,669
It's called the Professional
Performance Evaluation Process,

628
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,505
or colloquially the P-PEP.

629
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,716
And there are strict rules
to replace a failing teacher.

630
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,718
It has 23 steps.

631
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:32,721
There is an initial conference
at the beginning of the year.

632
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,182
Weekly assistance must be provided.

633
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,769
Then the observation has to occur, it
has to be a certain number of minutes.

634
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:42,940
Then there's a post conference which
needs to happen after the observation.

635
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:46,860
Over those 90 days, the principal must
do three more observations...

636
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:49,196
If it isn't completed by January,

637
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,031
you have to wait
until the following year.

638
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,826
There's lots of forms
and dates and deadlines

639
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,495
that have to be followed,
and if a single date is missed,

640
00:40:56,663 --> 00:41:00,207
for whatever reason, the entire process
can be subject to grievance.

641
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,169
I don't know,
it just feels like a strange...

642
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:06,088
...game to me.

643
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:14,096
Jason Kamras
is not just a cold-hearted bureaucrat.

644
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:17,474
In 2005, he was named
teacher of the year.

645
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,145
People like Kamras will tell you,

646
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,731
there's nothing more difficult
than the life of a teacher.

647
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:30,154
I saw this when I followed the teachers
in my first documentary.

648
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,531
It was an incredible thing,

649
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:35,450
their total devotion
to the lives of children.

650
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,745
And I could see just
how tough their jobs were:

651
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:43,041
battling learning problems,
issues at home,

652
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,918
and rules from the system.

653
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:47,921
One day it can be really good,
and one day it can be, like,

654
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,507
not so good, and then the next
day it can be, like, horrible.

655
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:53,552
But the other thing reformers
and experts will tell you,

656
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,222
often under their breath,
is that their biggest obstacle

657
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,475
to real reform is a contract
with the teachers' union

658
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,186
which ties their hands.

659
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,105
So if you wanna
reward a really good teacher,

660
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:09,610
who's kicking ass, knocking it
out of the park, can you do that?

661
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:14,990
We, under the current contract,
cannot pay teachers

662
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:18,327
more based upon their performance.

663
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,996
- Why not?
- It's not in the contract.

664
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:26,710
The muscle and the zeal
that built our union is still with us.

665
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,297
You are heroes!

666
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:34,968
It's very, very important
to hold two contradictory ideas

667
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,137
in your head at the same time.

668
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:40,432
Teachers are great,
a national treasure.

669
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,936
Teachers' unions are,
generally speaking,

670
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,022
a menace and an
impediment to reform.

671
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:50,943
I'm a superintendent.

672
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,986
I'm assigning kids over to a school.

673
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:56,490
The day I send them over there, I know
they ain't gonna learn nothing,

674
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:58,784
'cause ain't nobody learned
anything over there in 20 years.

675
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:01,495
You go into a school building, right?

676
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:05,082
And you go into this classroom where
this great learning is taking place.

677
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,627
Then you walk right next door to death.

678
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:13,757
Teachers used to pass me notes,
"Make sure you go to room 222."

679
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,842
And the principal,
who would be taking me around,

680
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,345
before I go in, "OK,
Howard, I wanna tell you.

681
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,515
This is one of my,
what they call 'two-80-T'."

682
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:24,851
What that is,
is a provision in the contract

683
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:28,272
that provided what we call
the "dance of the lemons."

684
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,439
- And...
- The what?

685
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,941
"The dance of the lemons."

686
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:36,280
So when you have a system
that's completely dysfunctional,

687
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,908
you see good people
do strange things.

688
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:42,828
In Milwaukee, they call it
the "dance of the lemons."

689
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:44,496
Here's how it works.

690
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:46,248
Principals have their lemons.

691
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:48,709
These are teachers
who are chronically bad.

692
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:52,087
They know it,
the other teachers know it,

693
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:53,505
the school knows it,

694
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:57,301
but the union contract
says you can't fire them.

695
00:43:58,386 --> 00:43:59,720
So at the end of the year,

696
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:03,307
all the principals get together
and they do the lemon dance.

697
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:12,190
Fred gives Jack his lemons,

698
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,693
Jack gives Sally his lemons,

699
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:17,404
and Sally gives Greg her lemons.

700
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,156
The lemon dance.

701
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:21,575
Each principal hopes
the teachers he's stuck with

702
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:24,077
at the end of the dance
are somehow better

703
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:26,038
than the ones he's getting rid of

704
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,123
and that this year
he'll finally be able

705
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:31,752
to take his lemons
and make lemonade.

706
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,547
Each state deals with this
in a different way.

707
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:38,508
In some states, it's "pass the trash,"

708
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:42,596
others, it's the "turkey trot."

709
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:45,599
In New York,
they have something else.

710
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:53,648
Tenured teachers awaiting disciplinary
hearings on offenses

711
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:57,277
ranging from excessive lateness
to sexual abuse,

712
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:59,029
along with those
accused of incompetence,

713
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,782
are sent to the reassignment center

714
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:05,285
or what the rest of the world
calls the "Rubber Room."

715
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:10,957
These 600 teachers
collect their full salaries

716
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,919
and accumulate benefits
for spending seven hours a day

717
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:17,130
reading or playing cards.

718
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:20,217
They spend an average of three
years in the Rubber Room.

719
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:24,471
Their hearings last eight times longer
than the average criminal case.

720
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,849
The cost to the state of New York:

721
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:30,268
100 million dollars a year.

722
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:36,108
And none of this deals
with the larger pool of teachers

723
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,568
who just aren't good at their job.

724
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:44,157
If, in fact, we could just eliminate

725
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:48,412
the bottom six to ten percent
of our teachers

726
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,039
and replace them
with an average teacher,

727
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:55,168
we could bring the average U.S. student
up to the level of Finland,

728
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,462
which is at the top
of the world today.

729
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:03,176
The state of Illinois
has 876 school districts,

730
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:08,014
only 61 of them have ever attempted
to fire a tenured teacher,

731
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:12,060
and of those 61 ,
only 38 were successful

732
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:14,396
in actually firing a teacher.

733
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:17,274
Compare that to other professions.

734
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:22,195
For doctors, one in 57
lose their medical licenses.

735
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:25,991
One in 97 attorneys
lose their law licenses.

736
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:29,870
But for teachers, only one in 2,500

737
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,789
have ever lost their
teaching credentials.

738
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,667
I actually know how hard it is

739
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,586
to be a good teacher.

740
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,630
Then I taught English
and I taught social studies,

741
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,467
and I taught it to high school kids
who were two and three years behind.

742
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,469
And after all of my preparation,

743
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,679
I was a terrible teacher
for the first two years.

744
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:50,974
I mean, I was better than the other
teachers, but we were all terrible.

745
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,559
We could not move that group of kids.

746
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,811
It took me three years
to become a decent teacher

747
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:57,564
before I really learned my craft,

748
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,900
and in about five years,
I was a master teacher.

749
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,403
When Geoffrey Canada
pushed for change,

750
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:05,489
he was met at every step
by a system

751
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:09,993
with an infinite power to resist
and defeat his reforms.

752
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:14,873
So he joined a small group
of teachers and parents

753
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:17,000
who were looking
for solutions elsewhere.

754
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:23,590
In the early '90s,
a few communities began granting

755
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:26,927
provisional charters to create schools
that weren't bound

756
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:30,388
by the rules of the district
or union contracts.

757
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:33,016
Do you know anybody
in the fourth grade?

758
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,852
It's a free public school for...

759
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,270
It's a college prep charter school,

760
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,022
completely free,
over off the Marcy stop.

761
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:43,068
Charter schools were
a controversial experiment:

762
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:45,820
public schools with public money,

763
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,532
but independently run.

764
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,742
When there's limited space,

765
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:53,453
by law the school
must hold a lottery.

766
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:04,422
Geoffrey Canada petitioned
to start a charter school

767
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:08,468
in the worst-performing district
in New York State.

768
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:11,680
We chose 97 blocks in Central Harlem.

769
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,683
It had the worst educational
outcomes for children,

770
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,977
and we came here
because it had the worst.

771
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:22,524
These 97 blocks have the highest rate
of foster care,

772
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:26,778
and twice the unemployment rate
of the rest of New York City.

773
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:30,365
Many experts believed that even
the most motivated educators

774
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:36,162
could not overcome the problems that
these children brought from home.

775
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,791
But despite the failures
of reformers before him,

776
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:43,545
Geoffrey Canada made a promise
to the families of Harlem.

777
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:45,297
Your child comes to this school,

778
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:48,842
we will guarantee that we will
get your child into college.

779
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,511
We will be with you, with your child,

780
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,805
from the moment they enter our school

781
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:57,475
to the moment they graduate
from college.

782
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,193
I grew up in the public school system.

783
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:12,782
I had a economics teacher,

784
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,827
and that teacher refused to teach.

785
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,831
When you hear, "Well,
I get paid whether or not

786
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:23,501
you learn or not," it sticks with you.

787
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,587
And that's something that
no parent wants their child

788
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:29,007
to ever be a witness to or
to hear when they're going to school.

789
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:33,345
If I'm trusting you with my child
and teaching my child,

790
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:36,640
I expect you to do the same job
that you would want

791
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,391
for your... for your own children.

792
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,311
And I just knew that I wanted
her in parochial school.

793
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:53,740
Bianca's school is directly across
the street from their home.

794
00:49:57,495 --> 00:50:01,331
Every month, Nakia pays $500 tuition.

795
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,541
It's a struggle.

796
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,919
It's a struggle,
but it's a choice that I made.

797
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:09,130
It's my responsibility to my child.

798
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,803
Her first year in school,

799
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:18,431
I had lost my job
due to some layoffs,

800
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,684
and I did all that I could

801
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:24,229
and made sure that
she still got her education.

802
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:26,731
One notebook.

803
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,777
Do you ever think if you sent Bianca

804
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:34,155
to a public school, there would
be less pressure with money?

805
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:35,824
I have given that some thought,

806
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,535
but I revert right back
to the same thing.

807
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:41,454
I'll just have to find a way.

808
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:45,125
There's nothing short
of a firestorm surrounding

809
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,918
the future of the D.C.
Public School system.

810
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:50,797
At the center of the controversy, new
schools chancellor, Michelle Rhee.

811
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,591
D.C. School Chancellor Michelle Rhee
will not name names,

812
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,428
but more than 30 school principals
are being terminated this week.

813
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,305
No shortage of outrage tonight
among parents and teachers

814
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,434
caught up in the district's plan to
close nearly two dozen public schools.

815
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,186
Fifty-seven teachers
and 77 support staff

816
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:07,105
are having to reapply for their jobs.

817
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:11,317
Within a few months,

818
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,862
the initial burst of enthusiasm
for Michelle Rhee had faded.

819
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:17,490
She had cut over a hundred jobs
in the D.C. Central Office,

820
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:21,578
closed 23 schools
and fired a quarter of all principals,

821
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:24,789
including the principal
of her own children's school.

822
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:28,918
Don't close schools!
Don't close schools!

823
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:32,088
If you wanna quickly become the most
unpopular person in a city,

824
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:35,175
you just tell someone you're gonna
close down a school, much less 23.

825
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:39,095
We work hard every day to make
sure those strengths are strong.

826
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:51,733
I'm not a career superintendent.

827
00:51:51,901 --> 00:51:53,902
This will be my one
and only superintendency.

828
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:57,322
So I don't have to worry
about pissing the unions off

829
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:01,075
and, you know, making this person
upset or that person upset.

830
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:04,621
The bottom line is I don't believe
that you are gonna be the leader who

831
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:09,042
is going to take this school to... in
the direction that we need it to go in,

832
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,878
and have the highest
expectations for the kids.

833
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:17,217
This scorched earth debate may actually
make some people's career.

834
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,844
No, I'm terminating
your principalship now.

835
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:23,223
May make somebody popular
in terms of,

836
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,392
"I'm the change agent,"
but it's not gonna change schools.

837
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,982
We will not be moved!
We will not be moved!

838
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,694
There is this unbelievable willingness

839
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,989
to turn a blind eye
to the injustices that

840
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,408
are happening to kids
every single day in our schools

841
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:45,286
in the name of harmony amongst adults.

842
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:58,842
Francisco? Francisco?

843
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:03,346
Good morning, sleepyhead.

844
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,904
Maria still hasn't heard
from Francisco's teacher.

845
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:25,201
The old one is Spider-Man.

846
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:30,707
Francisco, tell Mr. Saxon
to send Mommy your folder

847
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:33,334
because Mommy wants to know
how you're doing in school.

848
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:35,795
He said we don't need it.

849
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:39,173
OK, but remember Mommy needs to
know if you're paying attention,

850
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:42,010
if he's giving you stickers. Remember?

851
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,683
As I grew up going to college
and was exposed to more,

852
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:52,312
only then did I realize how
much I was cheated as

853
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:55,023
a child in my education.

854
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,901
This was the day
I came back from college.

855
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:01,362
My dad, because of the diabetes,
has stopped...

856
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,489
He wasn't able to move too much.

857
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:07,452
That day, he actually
danced a song with me.

858
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:12,290
For my father,
education was everything.

859
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,459
It was like if he would've
had gotten a chance,

860
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:18,963
he would have become something in his
life, rather than just a factory worker.

861
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:23,301
This is a fork, and it's not a "hork."

862
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:27,180
Right, 'cause "hork" isn't even a word.
That's a made-up word, but...

863
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,182
- "Horse" is a word.
- "Horse" is a word,

864
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:33,019
and there you would use "H."
And what about this one?

865
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:37,649
Maria takes Francisco
to a reading class at a nearby college.

866
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:38,858
Teachers are really overwhelmed,

867
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:41,277
'cause it's really hard
to give each one that,

868
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:43,655
you know, individualized attention.

869
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:47,033
So it's more work for them
to have these kinds of meetings.

870
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:49,118
If they can avoid them, unfortunately,

871
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,537
you have some teachers
that will avoid them if they can.

872
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:54,832
Well, he's already been in two reading
programs and teachers are telling me

873
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,210
that he knows how to read,
he's comprehending,

874
00:54:57,378 --> 00:54:58,628
and the teachers keep telling me

875
00:54:58,796 --> 00:54:59,879
that there's something
with his comprehension.

876
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:01,589
- Have you taken it beyond the school?
- No.

877
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:02,757
You should.

878
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:10,890
If you want a better school
for your kid, it's all about options.

879
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:13,226
But the system is confusing.

880
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:16,020
Let's say you live in a district
with a hundred public schools.

881
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:20,400
Most are like Francisco's,
not terrible, but not great.

882
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,402
A fifth will be failing,

883
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:26,739
and more will be hovering
between mediocre and failing.

884
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,993
There's usually one mainstream school
that's defying the odds.

885
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,578
With a great principal
and outstanding teachers,

886
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,789
it can produce amazing results,

887
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,750
but you can't go there unless
you live in that neighborhood.

888
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:41,004
So, for years, unless you
could afford a private school,

889
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,339
you were stuck with your
neighborhood school.

890
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:45,925
In the 1 960s,
magnet schools were formed.

891
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:49,429
These were district-run schools
to give families another choice.

892
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,098
Some were for job training,
some were for the arts

893
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,142
and some were for academics.

894
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:57,979
But there aren't that many magnets,
and they're very difficult to get into.

895
00:55:58,147 --> 00:56:01,024
In the '90s,
public charter schools emerged.

896
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:04,610
They're independent from the district,
but open to anyone who lived there.

897
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:08,364
But only one in five charters
is producing amazing results,

898
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:13,036
and so the numbers of families
applying there are usually very high.

899
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:16,205
So a parent like Maria has to work hard

900
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,499
to find a great school for her kid.

901
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:23,463
She takes a 45-minute subway ride
across the Harlem River

902
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,131
to look at a charter school.

903
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:31,763
One of the things that we've really
put a lot of emphasis on

904
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,347
this past year
is reading comprehension.

905
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:36,893
So not just can they read the
words on the page with fluency?

906
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:38,936
It's do they really
understand what they're reading?

907
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,191
Freddy was...

908
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:46,569
So is the difference between
the school down here

909
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:50,448
and Harlem Success that great?

910
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:53,451
Yes. It's two different worlds.

911
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:59,373
"One Sunday morning,
the wrong sun came up, and pop!

912
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:02,585
Out of the egg came a tiny..."

913
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:06,005
- Caterpillar.
- Do you know...

914
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:08,591
Every student who's behind
in reading is assigned

915
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:11,677
a tutor and has one
until they're caught up.

916
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:15,056
How many books do you think you're
gonna read by the end of the school,

917
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:17,350
by the time school finished?

918
00:57:17,518 --> 00:57:20,269
Probably like the same amount
that I read last year.

919
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,647
- Which was what?
- One hundred and five.

920
00:57:22,815 --> 00:57:24,565
Wow! Really?

921
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:30,363
I don't care if we have to wake up
at 5:00 in the morning

922
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:34,826
in order to get there by 7:45,
then that's what we will do.

923
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:38,204
And do you start this at third grade
or do you start it from kindergarten?

924
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:40,373
- Kindergarten.
- Kindergarten? Wow.

925
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:42,542
- That's what we do here.
- So by the time they get to third,

926
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,128
this is easy for them. Yeah.

927
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:48,339
So if Francisco doesn't get in,
is there another chance?

928
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:52,468
No. No, because he'll
be going into second grade,

929
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:56,639
and most schools, they only take
kindergarten, first and second,

930
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:59,058
so this is Francisco's last chance.

931
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:02,603
- Abuela birthday is in June.
- June.

932
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:05,273
Harlem Success
will take 40 second graders...

933
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:09,402
...with 792 families applying.

934
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,487
Why don't we skip...

935
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:14,782
Now, can anyone tell us
what a picnic is?

936
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,578
A picnic is where you go out
in the country

937
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,288
and eat food off the dirt.

938
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:37,138
Up until the 1 970s, American public
schools were the best in the world.

939
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:40,391
Bob, you've been keeping
your grades up. That's good.

940
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:44,187
The image of public schools in our films
and TV reflects an ideal,

941
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:47,106
that even if you're unlucky enough
to be born in the wrong neighborhood,

942
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:49,150
education could be a ticket out.

943
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:52,778
Mr. Vincent Barbarino,
I don't see any homework.

944
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,448
All right, so I didn't do my homework.

945
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:58,534
So 'scuse me for living!

946
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:01,204
Public school was not an ordeal
we had to survive,

947
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:06,500
but rather the single most important
formative experience in our lives.

948
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,461
Since 1 900, U.S. public schools

949
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:10,463
have produced more than
a hundred Nobel laureates,

950
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:14,133
ten presidents and countless
numbers of great Americans.

951
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:28,981
Americans were really leading the world
in educating its young people

952
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:32,026
because we had sort of
this free education system,

953
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:35,154
and it was halfway decent,
40, 50 years ago.

954
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:38,699
We didn't really have global
competition. I mean, we really didn't.

955
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:42,578
And everybody thought
when Nixon opened China, right?

956
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:46,332
One of the... the time, you say,
"Look, you know what's gonna happen

957
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:50,169
if we could just sell
every Chinese person

958
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:54,048
a toothbrush? We'll make billions!
Why, there's just so many of them."

959
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:58,052
And we never realized that they would
be selling us the toothbrushes.

960
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:02,974
Since the 1 970s,
U.S. schools have failed to keep pace

961
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,934
with the rest of the world.

962
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:08,479
Among 30 developed countries,
we rank 25th in math

963
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:10,982
and 21st in science.

964
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:14,110
The top five percent of our students,
our very best,

965
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:17,363
rank 23rd out of 29
developed countries.

966
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:24,078
In almost every category,
we've fallen behind, except one.

967
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:28,708
The same study looked at math skills
and found in these eight countries,

968
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:32,211
the USA ranked last. But when
researchers asked the students

969
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:35,923
how they felt they had done,
"Did I get good marks in mathematics,"

970
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:40,261
kids from the USA
ranked number one in confidence.

971
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:01,324
We might be overconfident,

972
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,743
but if you look at the
public schools in our suburbs,

973
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:08,372
this belief that we're number one
doesn't seem so wrong.

974
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,416
Inner city schools may be failing,

975
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:14,003
but your kid's gonna be fine if his
school has a new athletic facility,

976
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:18,299
an art center and a closed circuit
system for the principal

977
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:19,759
to broadcast his morning messages.

978
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:22,094
Girls, when you're
doing a water event,

979
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:24,472
I understand that
you can wear a tankini,

980
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:27,933
but not a bykini, bikini.

981
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:33,189
People move into an area, and they
know they're paying a lot of money

982
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:36,776
for their mortgage, for their house,
so they assume that the school

983
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,527
must be just as nice as their house.

984
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,656
Many of the kids are actually
doing quite poorly

985
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:45,868
when it comes to basic subjects
like English and mathematics.

986
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:51,082
Redwood City is 30 minutes south
of San Francisco,

987
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,042
in the heart of Silicon Valley.

988
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,795
No inner city problems here.

989
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:59,298
The average home price
is almost a million dollars.

990
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:02,885
When you bought your house here, did
you think the schools would be good?

991
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:07,723
Well, we did, yes, we did. And as I say,
when we first moved in, they were.

992
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:15,815
What side of the periodic table
are metals found on?

993
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,651
Now you're asking me?

994
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:22,655
I can't answer that, love,
it's been too long.

995
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,991
I'd say the top side, but I don't know.

996
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:29,120
There is no top side.
"On the periodic table,

997
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:31,705
metals are found generally
on the left side. True."

998
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:35,584
Emily Jones is in the eighth grade
at Roy Cloud Middle School.

999
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,461
Now be a good girl.

1000
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:43,008
What's that mean?
The bosses don't know their employees?

1001
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,885
- Emily?
- 'Cause back in the old days

1002
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:46,554
when people had small businesses,

1003
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:48,514
there were only
like five or six people working,

1004
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:51,767
but in the factories, they had
hundreds and hundreds of people

1005
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:53,853
working, and they barely knew,
like, their names.

1006
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,271
Very good.

1007
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:56,981
What's your favorite subject?

1008
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:03,112
I'm not very good at math, but I think
I'd say it's my favorite subject.

1009
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:06,449
Math and science.

1010
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,242
I don't know what college
I want to go to,

1011
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,661
but I know I wanna be a teacher.

1012
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,749
Woodside High,
where Emily is slated to go next year,

1013
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:18,335
looks like a private boarding school,

1014
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:22,298
and Newsweek ranked it in the top six
percent of American high schools,

1015
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:26,385
but Emily and her family
wanna go somewhere else.

1016
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:30,848
Summit Prep is located
in an industrial neighborhood.

1017
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:34,226
It doesn't have the fancy
facilities of Woodside.

1018
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:36,479
It doesn't even have a gymnasium.

1019
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,356
But over 400 families
are entering the lottery here

1020
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:43,068
and hoping for a spot because of
something else it doesn't have.

1021
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,988
They all take the same courses
through their four years,

1022
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:47,990
which means we don't have tracking,
so...

1023
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,784
...yeah, so we don't track the students.

1024
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,454
So the school over there tracks
and you don't. Why?

1025
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:57,666
Because we think every kid should be
able to get to the highest level of

1026
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,836
curriculum, so we want to hold them all
to the same high standard.

1027
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:04,423
Emily's probably not gonna drop out,

1028
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:06,926
and it's very unlikely
she'll go to prison,

1029
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:11,931
but her test scores are low, which means
the stakes for her next year are high.

1030
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:16,644
Many families
and their children are unaware

1031
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:19,438
that their academic future will
be decided by a school official

1032
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:22,149
who will place them on a track.

1033
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:24,777
Tracking is often
determined by test results,

1034
01:04:24,945 --> 01:04:27,613
but research shows that
students are also tracked

1035
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:30,824
by arbitrary or subjective
factors like neatness,

1036
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:34,161
politenest
and obedience to authority.

1037
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:38,415
Lower tracks have lower expectations,
and often worse teachers.

1038
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:42,628
So students placed on lower tracks
often find they are running fast,

1039
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:45,005
but falling behind.

1040
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:47,967
As the years progress,
it becomes increasingly difficult

1041
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:51,136
for those kids to ever catch up.

1042
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,597
The high-performing kids,
they often have

1043
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:56,100
special programs where they
come through pretty well.

1044
01:04:56,268 --> 01:05:01,021
A lot of the kids who get hurt
are the ones in the middle.

1045
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:03,107
Eighty-seven years before...

1046
01:05:03,275 --> 01:05:04,525
Middle class schools
suffer from the same

1047
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:06,694
dysfunction as urban schools,

1048
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:09,363
but because they attract
more high-performing students,

1049
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:11,031
their test scores are inflated.

1050
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:14,493
It averages out to a point
where it masks the bottom

1051
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:17,288
75 percent of students
in those schools.

1052
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:19,999
The California State University system

1053
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:24,169
is designed to accept the top one-third
of high school graduates,

1054
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,171
but most are not prepared.

1055
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:30,509
They have to remediate 50 to 60 percent
of all incoming freshmen

1056
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:33,804
before they can take
college level classes.

1057
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:37,349
Look at Woodside High School.
Out of 100 ninth graders,

1058
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:42,605
62 will graduate and only 32 will be
prepared for a four-year college.

1059
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,899
But at Summit Prep,
out of a hundred students,

1060
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,776
96 will graduate,

1061
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,946
and all of them will be ready
for a four-year college.

1062
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:52,740
To LA. We're going to LA.
You remember we're going...

1063
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:55,618
Emily and her family have signed up
for the Summit lottery.

1064
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,329
The computer just randomizes
the numbers in an order.

1065
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:02,374
Say 54-A is like the 99th
student to get into Summit,

1066
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:05,002
then they have a list
of all the numbers who aren't

1067
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:07,087
gonna get in but who are
on the waiting list.

1068
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:09,965
- Was it 300... or 400 spots?
- Five hundred.

1069
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:13,135
- For a hundred spots?
- Five in one chance.

1070
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:19,224
- Well, we'll see.
- Yeah.

1071
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,688
It's not like
Woodside High School is so bad.

1072
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:27,066
Many families would be happy
to send their kids there.

1073
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:31,904
In fact, Woodside is doing the job it
was designed for, 50 years ago.

1074
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:38,369
The system of tracking
fit the demands of the time.

1075
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,746
Only 20 percent
of high school graduates

1076
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:42,915
were even expected to go to college.

1077
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:46,710
They would become doctors,
lawyers and CEOs.

1078
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:50,798
The next 20 percent were meant
to go straight into skilled jobs,

1079
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:54,426
like accountants,
managers and bureaucrats.

1080
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:57,262
And the bottom 60 percent
would become workers,

1081
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,932
like farmers and factory workers.

1082
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,935
There were jobs for everyone
in the booming post-war economy,

1083
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:07,940
and schools like Woodside did their part
to supply a useful workforce.

1084
01:07:08,108 --> 01:07:11,610
The problem is our schools
haven't changed,

1085
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:13,362
but the world around them has.

1086
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:21,787
Nowadays, you don't go to college,
you're kind of screwed in America,

1087
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:24,665
you know,
and America's kind of screwed.

1088
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:29,169
At the end of 2009, the unemployment
rate was almost ten percent,

1089
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:31,296
but the high-tech industry
could not find enough

1090
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:33,841
qualified people to fill their jobs.

1091
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:36,844
Instead, they had to go halfway
around the world to recruit

1092
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:39,763
the engineers and programmers
they needed.

1093
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:43,809
The only really proven thing
to make an economy work well

1094
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:46,729
is to have a well-educated workforce.

1095
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:50,899
You know, people get panicked about
the economic success of this country.

1096
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,694
Well, there's one thing
that will determine that.

1097
01:07:53,862 --> 01:07:57,531
Bill Gates was so worried about
the state of our schools,

1098
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,450
he testified before Congress.

1099
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:02,953
We cannot sustain
an economy based on innovation

1100
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:06,039
unless we have citizens
well-educated in math,

1101
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:09,334
science and engineering.
If we fail at this,

1102
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:12,629
we won't be able to compete
in the global economy.

1103
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:17,801
We're not just lacking graduates
in math and science.

1104
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:21,972
By the year 2020,
1 23 million American jobs

1105
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,850
will be high skill, high pay,

1106
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:28,812
but only 50 million Americans
will be qualified to fill them.

1107
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:31,356
How strong the country
is 20 years from now

1108
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,067
and how equitable the country
is 20 years from now

1109
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:37,488
will be largely driven by this issue.

1110
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:47,748
My parents actually tell me
I have to read 30 minutes

1111
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:49,833
and then I could go outside and play.

1112
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:55,088
Go get it, go get it.

1113
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:57,299
Has your mom and dad
told you about the lottery?

1114
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:59,384
No.

1115
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:05,432
The lottery? Isn't that when
people play and they win money?

1116
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:14,274
Daisy and her parents have
found one other option.

1117
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:23,325
Eighth graders at KIPP LA Prep
get triple the classroom time

1118
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:25,994
in math and science,

1119
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,704
and by the time they
finish eighth grade,

1120
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:30,541
they will have doubled their
math and reading scores.

1121
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:35,796
You can see the trees.
You can see a building, a pole.

1122
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:45,556
Judith and Jose have decided
to enter Daisy into the KIPP lottery.

1123
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:50,602
KIPP is a better school
that they won't let you fail.

1124
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:53,814
- They won't let you fail?
- No.

1125
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:06,952
Good morning.

1126
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:14,793
Mom! Everybody's
going to school now!

1127
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:20,048
- I know.
- I'm not graduating.

1128
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,968
No, you're graduating.
You just won't be at the ceremony.

1129
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:25,220
When am I gonna graduate?

1130
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:27,973
Nakia's hours
have been cut back at work,

1131
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:32,603
and she has had trouble making her
monthly payments to Bianca's school.

1132
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:37,274
Today is her graduation,

1133
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:39,359
and she's not allowed to go

1134
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:43,405
because I do owe some tuition,

1135
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:47,034
and they will not allow her
to go to the ceremonies.

1136
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:49,828
And...

1137
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:53,832
It's enough that I
have to explain it to her,

1138
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,335
but...

1139
01:10:57,337 --> 01:10:59,254
And I spoke to the principal about this

1140
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:03,842
and I asked him, why penalize
her for my responsibility?

1141
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:07,679
I can understand them not
giving her, her certificate

1142
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:11,308
or not giving her, her report card,

1143
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:15,312
but to not let her be
a part of the ceremony

1144
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,315
is just... it's harsh.

1145
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:32,204
The Catholic schools,
the scholarships

1146
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:35,165
are very limited
or they're already used up.

1147
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:39,878
They just said,
then try again for next year.

1148
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:47,177
I said, "Mommy wanted you
to stay in your school,"

1149
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:48,679
and she finished my sentence,
she said,

1150
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:51,181
"I know, but you
didn't have enough money."

1151
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:52,849
I said, "That's right."
I said, "But that was Mommy's choice

1152
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:55,560
to put you in that school,
and it's gonna be Mommy's job

1153
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:58,146
to get you another school
that's better."

1154
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:17,207
Nakia is entering Bianca into
the lottery at Harlem Success.

1155
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,084
I'm very nervous.

1156
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:21,878
We're gonna go over

1157
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:25,132
and we're gonna keep our fingers
crossed and hope that we get called.

1158
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:45,110
When Geoffrey Canada opened
the doors to his new charter,

1159
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:49,156
he saw kids that were two
and three grade levels behind,

1160
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:51,074
and they brought
with them other problems

1161
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:53,785
that middle class students
didn't have:

1162
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:58,957
poverty, crime, troubled homes.

1163
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:01,710
In his neighborhood,

1164
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,962
more kids knew people
who had been to prison

1165
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:06,757
than had gone to college.

1166
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:14,556
For decades, tests have
shown an achievement gap

1167
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:18,060
between rich and poor children,
and that over time,

1168
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,312
despite everything we've tried,

1169
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,732
nothing seems to make it any better.

1170
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,650
Even progressive educators

1171
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:29,196
began to believe that
the gap could never be closed.

1172
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:33,283
And for those of us who drive
by these schools,

1173
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:36,161
maybe we make
the same dark assumption,

1174
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:40,248
that those kids, the ones
in the poorest neighborhoods,

1175
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,501
just can't learn.

1176
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,090
One-eight-seven.

1177
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:56,264
In 1 947, many felt that the sound
barrier could never be broken.

1178
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:01,186
Even men of science believed
that our fastest planes

1179
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:04,856
would break apart when they
approached the speed of sound.

1180
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:08,026
The glass would shatter
and the metal would shred.

1181
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:10,904
It was a belief that kept
many a pilot on the ground

1182
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:15,909
and science from moving forward,
until Chuck Yeager.

1183
01:14:16,077 --> 01:14:19,538
About half of the engineers
gave us no chance at all

1184
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:23,500
of ever successfully flying
beyond the speed of sound.

1185
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:25,836
They said it's a so-called barrier,
and the airplane

1186
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:29,381
would, you know,
go out of control or disintegrate.

1187
01:14:29,549 --> 01:14:31,550
I didn't look at it that way.

1188
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:37,556
Almost everybody who
comes in to do school,

1189
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:41,268
they come in and try
to save kids after they're lost.

1190
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:45,689
Having seen firsthand the failures
of reformers before him,

1191
01:14:45,857 --> 01:14:48,984
Geoffrey Canada knew he had
to rethink the way a school worked

1192
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:51,069
in a troubled neighborhood.

1193
01:14:57,702 --> 01:15:01,246
At the same time in Houston,
David Levin and Mike Feinberg

1194
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:06,001
were two frustrated teachers
looking for another way.

1195
01:15:06,169 --> 01:15:10,088
Across the hall from Levin was
a veteran teacher named Harriet Ball.

1196
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:14,843
Break it down and show me how you
choose for these other measures

1197
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:18,180
How do you choose for these
other measures? Like the liter.

1198
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:21,600
She noticed that her kids
had trouble learning math terms,

1199
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:23,268
but could memorize a rap song.

1200
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:26,438
It doesn't matter how heavy it is

1201
01:15:26,606 --> 01:15:29,900
So she turned her multiplication tables
into a song.

1202
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:32,485
I'm a mathbook that I left on the...

1203
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:34,362
She called them "disposable crutches,"
and she said,

1204
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:37,490
"Once I have the basics in that way,
in an enjoyable way,"

1205
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:39,576
and the kids would sort of sing
these songs out in the playground,

1206
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,244
"then I can move to the next step."

1207
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:46,208
For Levin and Feinberg,
it was nothing short of a revelation.

1208
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,792
Can you count by seven?

1209
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,502
- Yes!
- Let's do it.

1210
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:52,339
Seven, 14, 21 ...

1211
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:54,925
They studied Ball's methods,

1212
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:58,428
and drew from other teaching practices,

1213
01:15:58,596 --> 01:16:01,431
and opened two new schools
called KIPP Academy,

1214
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:04,976
one in Houston
and the other in the Bronx.

1215
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:11,983
Against the advice of skeptics, Geoffrey
Canada laid out an ambitious vision

1216
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:15,570
for a school that would go far
beyond what others had tried.

1217
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:18,949
We said, "What if we never
let our kids get behind?"

1218
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:22,827
He created an educational pipeline,
which started at birth...

1219
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:24,579
Can I give you a flyer
on The Baby College?

1220
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:28,333
...following each child through
every stage of their development,

1221
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:29,960
whatever it took.

1222
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:33,338
Eight, 16, 24, 32, 40.

1223
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:36,508
Both KIPP and Canada
used the same fundamentals.

1224
01:16:36,676 --> 01:16:39,010
They increased classroom hours,

1225
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:42,180
held school on Saturdays
and even in the summertime...

1226
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:44,557
- Does everybody agree with that?
- Yes.

1227
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:46,309
...put relentless
focus on achievement

1228
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:49,437
with a singular emphasis
on a pathway to college...

1229
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:51,940
Could you hand me the
dissecting needle, please?

1230
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:55,360
Right from the start,
there is a "No excuse."

1231
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:58,780
"We expect you all
to perform at high levels."

1232
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:02,575
And everybody
cares about this. Everybody.

1233
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:04,035
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come here, come here,
come here, come here, come here.

1234
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:06,579
What's up with this?
It's a whole new look.

1235
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:07,872
I'm going to gym.

1236
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,958
That scientists have discovered
you can avoid...

1237
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:12,335
...and the results have been staggering.

1238
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:16,256
The top charter schools are sending
over 90 percent of their kids

1239
01:17:16,424 --> 01:17:19,634
to four-year colleges, because
when you get the culture right,

1240
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:22,804
and the teachers
are helping each other out,

1241
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:26,766
and that long school day means
that that is the primary thing

1242
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:30,395
that student is engaged in, it works.

1243
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:33,898
KIPP Academy has been named

1244
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:38,320
the highest-performing middle
school in the entire Bronx.

1245
01:17:40,323 --> 01:17:41,740
Congratulations, Kippsters.

1246
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:43,158
- Austin!
- Texas!

1247
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:44,743
But the experts refused to accept

1248
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,912
that this was anything more
than a few charismatic leaders,

1249
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:52,250
an idea that could never be
repeated or brought to scale.

1250
01:17:54,045 --> 01:17:56,963
Sixteen years later,
there are 82 KIPP schools

1251
01:17:57,131 --> 01:18:00,133
across the country, each in low-income,

1252
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:05,555
under-performing neighborhoods,
including KIPP LA Prep,

1253
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:08,600
where Daisy is applying.

1254
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:10,018
You can't beat their data.

1255
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:12,520
We have now data
from the first thousand kids

1256
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,273
who have gone through
four years of KIPP.

1257
01:18:16,734 --> 01:18:22,697
Those kids have gone from the 32nd
to the 60th percentile in reading,

1258
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:26,576
and from the 40th
to the 82nd percentile in math.

1259
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:30,497
We have never had those kinds
of gains for low-income kids.

1260
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:33,583
I want somebody to come up
and draw three quarters for me.

1261
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:36,711
In Geoffrey Canada's program,
there are 8,000 students.

1262
01:18:36,879 --> 01:18:38,797
In a neighborhood where less

1263
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:42,092
than one out of ten residents
have a college degree,

1264
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:44,594
nine out of ten are proficient in math

1265
01:18:44,762 --> 01:18:47,180
and are on track to go
to a four-year college.

1266
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:51,267
Twenty-five years ago, there was no
proof that something else worked.

1267
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:53,686
Well, now we know what works.

1268
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:58,858
We know that it's just a lie that...
that disadvantaged kids can't learn.

1269
01:18:59,026 --> 01:19:03,029
We know that if you apply the
right accountability standards,

1270
01:19:03,197 --> 01:19:05,281
you can get fabulous results.

1271
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:07,325
So why would we do something else?

1272
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:09,994
Brilliant. What, you
could be one of my teachers.

1273
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:13,373
When you finish, and you get your
college degree, come work for me.

1274
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:14,958
You can help us teach math, all right?

1275
01:19:15,126 --> 01:19:18,503
The students at KIPP
and Geoffrey Canada's schools

1276
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:21,005
don't just do better
than other poor kids.

1277
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:25,260
They do better than everyone,
closing the achievement gap

1278
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:29,639
and shattering the myth
that those kids can't learn.

1279
01:19:46,866 --> 01:19:49,284
Anthony's class visits the SEED School,

1280
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:52,328
the first urban public boarding
school in the country.

1281
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:56,499
I'm sure a mother, father,
sister, brother, aunt, uncle,

1282
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:59,669
grandparent, neighbor, someone
has taken an interest in you

1283
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:01,671
and someone loves you,

1284
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:03,882
and they recognize the
importance of education.

1285
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:06,885
To come to SEED,
geography and luck, that's it.

1286
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:08,303
You have to live in
the district, and we have

1287
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:11,681
to pull out a bingo ball,
call your number.

1288
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:14,225
You can actually have posters
on your side of the room.

1289
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:16,936
- You can decorate however you want.
- This is like a college.

1290
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:19,272
Yes, this is like a college.
This is exactly...

1291
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,317
And so because you're
in a boarding school, by the time

1292
01:20:22,485 --> 01:20:26,988
you get ready to go to college, you will
already know what it's gonna be like.

1293
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:32,035
If I get into SEED,
I'm gonna have seven classes.

1294
01:20:32,203 --> 01:20:35,705
Gotta wake up early, usually,

1295
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:38,583
and then you gotta wear ties and stuff.

1296
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:41,127
No TV...

1297
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:44,964
...no games, no nothing.

1298
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:48,134
So you hoping you get in,
or you hoping you don't get in?

1299
01:20:49,762 --> 01:20:51,930
It's bittersweet to me if I get in.

1300
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:55,099
They give me a better chance in life,
but if I don't,

1301
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:57,602
I just be with my friends.

1302
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:01,189
One, two...

1303
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:06,069
Where are you? 'Sup with you?

1304
01:21:06,237 --> 01:21:08,488
In a way I want him to get in,
buts another part of me

1305
01:21:08,656 --> 01:21:10,615
really don't want him to get in.

1306
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:12,116
Why?

1307
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:15,537
Because he'll be gone all that time,
but I want him to go.

1308
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:22,335
A part of me wants him to go.

1309
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:36,975
What are the odds of getting in?

1310
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:43,898
I don't know.

1311
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:49,195
I wanna go to college
and get an education.

1312
01:21:49,363 --> 01:21:51,239
Why?

1313
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:53,783
Because I... if I have kids,

1314
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:56,786
I don't want kids to be
in this environment.

1315
01:21:56,954 --> 01:21:59,956
- What?
- Like around here.

1316
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:05,628
I mean, I want my kids
to have better than what I had.

1317
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:08,840
You're already
thinking about your kids?

1318
01:22:09,008 --> 01:22:10,717
No, I'm just saying.

1319
01:22:13,304 --> 01:22:15,430
I wanna go to school.

1320
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:54,385
After a short time,
Michelle Rhee had made clear progress.

1321
01:22:54,553 --> 01:22:56,846
Test scores were up across the city,

1322
01:22:57,014 --> 01:23:00,183
and her broad powers allowed
her to shift resources away

1323
01:23:00,351 --> 01:23:04,062
from the Central Office
and into her schools.

1324
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:06,856
For the first time
in Washington, D.C. public schools,

1325
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:09,901
we've ensured that every single
school has an art teacher,

1326
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:12,737
a music teacher, a PE teacher,
a librarian and a nurse.

1327
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:15,907
But when she tried
more fundamental changes,

1328
01:23:16,075 --> 01:23:18,493
the kind she saw
in successful charter schools,

1329
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:21,579
the more she ran up against the system.

1330
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:24,082
She couldn't extend the school day,

1331
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:26,626
effectively evaluate her teachers

1332
01:23:26,794 --> 01:23:28,670
or alter the terms of tenure.

1333
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,761
So in the summer of 2008,

1334
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:40,264
Rhee proposed a radical change
in the way the D.C. school district

1335
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:43,393
and the union had done business
for almost a century.

1336
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,770
How soon do you think you'll
have a contract with the teachers?

1337
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:47,939
- We're going to...
- Within weeks? A couple of weeks?

1338
01:23:48,107 --> 01:23:51,901
We're going to present our final offer

1339
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:53,361
in the next couple of weeks.

1340
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:58,116
We are gonna change the face
of public education in this country.

1341
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:01,119
Instead of demanding the end of tenure,

1342
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:04,122
Rhee made a proposal that
would give teachers a choice.

1343
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:08,292
Keep tenure and get a modest raise,

1344
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:13,464
or give up tenure and earn potentially
twice as much in merit pay.

1345
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:16,134
Everyone says teachers
don't get paid enough.

1346
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:18,469
We're gonna pay teachers
six-figure salaries.

1347
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:20,805
Everybody has a choice in the matter.

1348
01:24:20,973 --> 01:24:23,933
It seemed that Rhee had come up
with a magic formula

1349
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:27,812
to solve the most intractable
problem in all of education.

1350
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:32,608
If she succeeded, it could open
the way for even broader reforms.

1351
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:39,031
Educators were watching closely,
and, not surprisingly,

1352
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,242
so was the National Teachers' Union.

1353
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:47,081
What we're against is
proposals that divide people,

1354
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:49,292
and that undermine education.

1355
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:54,338
The mentality is that
they have a right to that job.

1356
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:58,593
I believe that that mindset has
to be completely flipped on its head,

1357
01:24:58,761 --> 01:25:01,971
and unless you can show that you're
bringing positive results for kids,

1358
01:25:02,139 --> 01:25:05,475
then you cannot have the privilege
of teaching in our schools

1359
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:07,226
and teaching our children.

1360
01:25:07,394 --> 01:25:09,812
We ultimately wanna have
the most highly effective

1361
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:12,356
and highly compensated educator
force in the country.

1362
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:16,778
We wanna make sure that we recognize
and reward our effective teachers,

1363
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:19,447
and I think that this proposal
will go a long way to doing that.

1364
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:25,828
After months of highly charged debate,

1365
01:25:25,996 --> 01:25:30,374
the local union leadership
found Rhee's proposal so threatening,

1366
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:32,376
they would not even allow a vote.

1367
01:25:50,312 --> 01:25:55,066
Now I see in a lot more coherent ways

1368
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:58,736
why things are the way they are.

1369
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:05,284
It all becomes about the adults.

1370
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,592
We've tried money...

1371
01:26:24,263 --> 01:26:26,138
...passing laws...

1372
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:31,394
...and the latest reforms.

1373
01:26:33,272 --> 01:26:39,151
I want you to get a real good idea
when you start to create your figures.

1374
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:43,114
But the one thing those
who work in the trenches know

1375
01:26:43,282 --> 01:26:47,326
is that you can't have a great school
without great teachers.

1376
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:52,039
How is it possible that all three of
these rectangles have the same area?

1377
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:56,669
When you see a great teacher,
you are seeing a work of art.

1378
01:26:56,837 --> 01:27:00,089
You're seeing a master,
and it is as, I think,

1379
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:02,592
unbelievable as seeing a great athlete

1380
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:06,304
- or seeing a great musician.
- Add them all up.

1381
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:08,306
What do we do to find the money?

1382
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:11,517
Look past all the noise and the debate,

1383
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:14,520
and it's easy to see.

1384
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:17,315
Nothing will change without them.

1385
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:37,001
What happens when
a school fails a kid?

1386
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:40,588
What happens over time?

1387
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:50,181
Now that we know it's possible

1388
01:27:50,349 --> 01:27:52,934
to give every child
a great education,

1389
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:57,021
what is our obligation
to other people's children?

1390
01:28:01,068 --> 01:28:03,694
Sometimes, I think it's easier to think
of the millions of children

1391
01:28:03,862 --> 01:28:06,864
who are in our schools,
and look at the numbers,

1392
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:10,409
and all of the problems,
scratch our heads,

1393
01:28:10,577 --> 01:28:13,871
throw up our hands and give up,

1394
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:17,208
rather than look at just one...

1395
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:24,507
"...to spike..."

1396
01:28:24,675 --> 01:28:27,134
...and ask ourselves,

1397
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:33,265
"Did we do the right thing?
Did we do enough?"

1398
01:28:50,075 --> 01:28:52,284
As long as she has the VGA,
I'll just hook it up.

1399
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:54,829
OK. We're done.

1400
01:28:54,997 --> 01:28:56,247
Sixth-grade males.

1401
01:28:56,415 --> 01:28:58,249
In column A here,

1402
01:28:58,417 --> 01:29:01,419
I've assigned every student
a lottery ID number.

1403
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:04,714
And you have a one-preference
if you live in district

1404
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:08,426
and a two-preference
if you live out of district.

1405
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:11,929
I looked at 400 random
numbers compared to each other,

1406
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:15,558
and ran it about a hundred times,
and they never matched.

1407
01:29:15,726 --> 01:29:17,685
Go like this. Cross your fingers.

1408
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:20,229
I got a good feeling about this.

1409
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:25,735
Charter law,
which allows these schools,

1410
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:30,614
requires that if you have more
applications for a grade in your school

1411
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:32,491
than you have spaces available,

1412
01:29:32,659 --> 01:29:34,785
you must hold a random,
public drawing...

1413
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:38,164
We must conduct the lottery
and it's a random selection.

1414
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:40,583
You see the cages up here.
It's a random selection.

1415
01:29:40,751 --> 01:29:43,377
You all have your numbers, right? OK.

1416
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:48,174
OK, Daisy, let's go.

1417
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:52,303
The spaces with the Xs is for all
of the fifth-grade students

1418
01:29:52,471 --> 01:29:55,931
that are moving into the
sixth grade for next year.

1419
01:29:58,310 --> 01:30:00,311
We're gonna start
with the kindergartners

1420
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:02,772
and first and second graders,

1421
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:05,858
with some of the people
on the wait list at the end.

1422
01:30:06,026 --> 01:30:09,820
Are you nervous? No? I am.

1423
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:12,323
Come on, Daisy, cross your fingers.

1424
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:33,886
Let's get started.

1425
01:30:52,531 --> 01:30:53,656

Welcome to Harlem
Success Academy Two!

1471
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:11,330
Welcome, all scholars.
We are so excited to meet you.

1472
01:35:19,756 --> 01:35:21,215
Nine.

1473
01:35:27,806 --> 01:35:28,806
Twelve.

1474
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:37,731
Eighteen.

1475
01:35:55,834 --> 01:35:57,501
Twenty-two.

1476
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:05,426
The remaining numbers
will be on our waiting list.

1477
01:36:11,474 --> 01:36:13,225
Sixteen.

1478
01:36:18,022 --> 01:36:20,232
Thirteen.

1479
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:27,614
Twenty-seven.

1480
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:34,204
Three.

1481
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:40,961
Thank you to all
of you for being here.

1482
01:36:41,129 --> 01:36:43,922
Give yourselves a round of applause.
Thank you.

1483
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:47,634
For families who are on the waiting
list, you should receive at some time

1484
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:51,305
the early part of next week, confirming
where you are on the waiting list.

1485
01:36:51,473 --> 01:36:52,890
And here we go, our final five.

1486
01:36:53,057 --> 01:36:55,684
Students, thank you. Parents...

1487
01:36:57,228 --> 01:36:59,229
We are really excited
to serve your children.

1488
01:36:59,397 --> 01:37:01,648
And here they come, our last group.

1489
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:10,741
What can I say?

1490
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:16,455
Yeah. I won't give up on my kids.

1491
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:36,475
OK.

1492
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:42,481
Don't cry. You gonna
make Mommy cry. OK?

1493
01:37:45,652 --> 01:37:48,153
I told Francisco,
Mommy's trying to get you

1494
01:37:48,321 --> 01:37:51,990
into a good school, a better school.

1495
01:37:52,158 --> 01:37:53,700
It was much easier for me,

1496
01:37:53,868 --> 01:37:56,078
knowing that if he didn't get in,

1497
01:37:56,246 --> 01:37:58,288
for him not to be here,

1498
01:37:58,456 --> 01:38:00,165
'cause then, on my way home,

1499
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:02,584
I could get my thoughts together.

1500
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:19,059
There are just so many
different parents out there

1501
01:38:19,227 --> 01:38:21,812
that want so much
for their children.

1502
01:39:06,566 --> 01:39:09,735
We know we have
the tools to save those kids.

1503
01:39:09,902 --> 01:39:12,863
People are doing it
every day, right now.

1504
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:20,162
You know, the status quo can be
changed, but it takes a lot of outrage

1505
01:39:20,330 --> 01:39:21,872
and a lot of good examples,

1506
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:25,250
leading people to say yes,
we can do this.

1507
01:39:25,418 --> 01:39:27,044
We can show that this is different.

1508
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:33,216
The question is,
do we have the fortitude

1509
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:36,345
that it would take
as a city and as a country

1510
01:39:36,512 --> 01:39:40,307
to make the difficult decisions
that would be necessary?

1511
01:39:42,268 --> 01:39:47,981
If we give up,
then what is the result?

1512
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:50,108
What is the result?

1513
01:39:50,276 --> 01:39:51,693
Superman!

1514
01:39:51,861 --> 01:39:53,570
The children
are all right, Miss Lane.

1515
01:39:53,738 --> 01:39:55,614
- Just a little shaken up.
- Oh, thank goodness.

1516
01:39:55,782 --> 01:39:58,575
- And Wagner? What about him?
- See for yourself.

1517
01:39:58,743 --> 01:40:01,203
Someone destroyed
his ability to think.

1518
01:40:03,081 --> 01:40:04,956
I would love to say it's all fixed,

1519
01:40:05,124 --> 01:40:07,584
and everybody says, "Oh,
great, great, we believe now."

1520
01:40:07,752 --> 01:40:10,629
No. It is every day,
you are back in the struggle,

1521
01:40:10,797 --> 01:40:14,257
saying to these kids, "Don't give up,"

1522
01:40:14,425 --> 01:40:18,887
so kids believe again
that education is a way out.

1523
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:37,030
Hello. Yes, ma'am, he is. Hold on.

1524
01:40:38,783 --> 01:40:40,450
Hello.

1525
01:40:40,618 --> 01:40:42,703
- Hello. Is this Anthony?
- Yes.

1526
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:44,955
Hi, Anthony. It's Mrs. Inman

1527
01:40:45,123 --> 01:40:47,332
from the SEED Public Charter School.
How are you?

1528
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,710
- Fine.
- You're fine?

1529
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:53,797
What did you think about the lottery?

1530
01:40:53,965 --> 01:40:58,176
It was OK, but it could've been better
if I would've got in.

1531
01:40:58,344 --> 01:41:00,971
I'm actually calling
with some good news.

1532
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:02,973
So we reconciled all of our numbers,

1533
01:41:03,141 --> 01:41:06,685
and we were able to move students
up to be enrolled,

1534
01:41:06,853 --> 01:41:08,979
and I was so excited
to see your name.

1535
01:41:09,147 --> 01:41:11,523
We have a space for you.

1536
01:41:11,691 --> 01:41:13,984
Thank you.

1537
01:41:47,059 --> 01:41:48,477
- How's it going?
- Fine.

1538
01:41:48,644 --> 01:41:50,187
- Good. How was your summer?
- Good.

1539
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:52,272
Good? If I can just
get you to sign in, ma'am.

1540
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:53,857
- I need to sign him in?
- Yes, ma'am.

1541
01:41:54,025 --> 01:41:57,027
- You just sign right by his name there.
- Just give me a second.

1542
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:02,532
How you doing? Mr. Bagley,
your life skills counselor.

1543
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:05,911
Mr. Michaels. Life skills counselor.
So how are you guys doing?

1544
01:42:06,078 --> 01:42:08,538
- Hi. Fine. How are you?
- In here, sir.

1545
01:42:09,373 --> 01:42:14,836
You're the first one, so you can choose
what you want, one of the three beds.

1546
01:42:16,214 --> 01:42:19,216
I want this one.

1547
01:42:21,052 --> 01:42:22,469
No, I want that one.

1548
01:42:34,524 --> 01:42:36,650
- Love you.
- Me too.
