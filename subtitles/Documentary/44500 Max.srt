1
00:00:27,358 --> 00:00:29,258
<i>I don't believe in heaven.</i>

2
00:00:30,694 --> 00:00:32,662
<i>I believe in pain.</i>

3
00:00:33,797 --> 00:00:35,765
<i>I believe in fear.</i>

4
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:39,002
<i>I believe in death.</i>

5
00:00:57,454 --> 00:00:59,922
<i>There's an army ofbodies
under this river-</i>

6
00:01:00,024 --> 00:01:04,723
<i>criminals, people who ran
out of time, out of friends.</i>

7
00:01:14,238 --> 00:01:18,607
<i>Next time they drag this river, they'll find me
on the bottom with the rest of them.</i>

8
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:21,200
<i>There won't be anyone left
to say I was different.</i>

9
00:01:38,395 --> 00:01:40,420
<i>I could feel the dead
down in there...</i>

10
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:42,522
<i>just below my feet...</i>

11
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:45,466
<i>reaching up to welcome me
as one of their own.</i>

12
00:01:49,306 --> 00:01:51,638
<i>It was an easy mistake to make.</i>

13
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:11,391
<i>All the cold investigations
in the city are collected up...</i>

14
00:02:11,495 --> 00:02:13,759
and delivered over here to us.

15
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:18,801
We call each of the witnesses to see if they
have anything to add to their original statements.

16
00:02:18,902 --> 00:02:24,033
- And if they can? - We send the file
to the original precinct for follow-up.

17
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:28,601
Don't get your hopes up though.

18
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:35,717
This is the Cold Case office.

19
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,949
Once you've been through the file
and come up empty, you bring it here.

20
00:02:40,057 --> 00:02:43,220
<i>Max here handles all our files.</i>

21
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:46,922
It hits his desk,
the case is officially dead.

22
00:02:47,031 --> 00:02:48,999
So what if there's no phone number
for a witness?

23
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:52,068
- Should I follow-up in person?
- No, no. We don't do that kind of stuff down here.

24
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:53,761
I don't understand.
Then how-

25
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:57,363
How am I supposed to solve the unsolvable
murder mystery and redeem yourself?

26
00:02:57,474 --> 00:03:01,137
<i>- Man, Internal Affairs-
- Look, look, stop. All right, trust me.</i>

27
00:03:01,245 --> 00:03:06,308
There's a tragic story behind why
I'm standin' here givin' you this tour.

28
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:09,215
We all did something,
so just save it.

29
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:17,025
What do you say we grab a beer
after work or something?

30
00:03:27,037 --> 00:03:29,528
- So what's his story?
- There is none.

31
00:03:30,574 --> 00:03:32,565
- But back there you said-
- Listen.

32
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:37,238
His wife and kid were murdered.
They never found the guy.

33
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:40,009
That's his story.

34
00:03:40,117 --> 00:03:45,111
Remember when you were a kid and you'd hold
your breath when you went past a graveyard?

35
00:03:45,222 --> 00:03:48,157
Just, uh, leave that man alone.

36
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:39,367
Yo, homey,
that's a really nice watch.

37
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:42,632
Kinda reminds me of one I lost.

38
00:05:44,975 --> 00:05:48,934
Oh, you didn't lose it. You pawned it
up on 128th a few hours ago.

39
00:05:50,314 --> 00:05:52,612
Ask Doug. He was there with you.

40
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,720
Are you followin' us, asshole?

41
00:05:58,822 --> 00:06:00,722
No.

42
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:04,786
I'm only following you.

43
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:07,830
Aw, hell, no.
What, you a cop or somethin'?

44
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,467
Not tonight.

45
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:15,936
That's too bad.
Now go get my watch.

46
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:21,842
Come on, Dougie.
Come get his watch.

47
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:32,355
I guess this ain't
your lucky day, now, is it?

48
00:06:40,197 --> 00:06:41,323
Whoa!

49
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:54,973
No! No! No!

50
00:07:03,954 --> 00:07:05,854
<i>Watch over me.
Watch over me.</i>

51
00:07:05,956 --> 00:07:07,617
Watch over me. Watch over me.

52
00:07:07,724 --> 00:07:09,817
- Watch over me. Watch over me.
- Open your eyes. Now!

53
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:12,793
- Oh, Jesus.
- Have you ever seen this woman?

54
00:07:14,131 --> 00:07:16,565
- No.
- You got busted robbing a house in New Jersey...

55
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:18,567
with William Preston
six months ago.

56
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:22,230
- Bill's dead.
- Why the hell do you think I'm talkin' to you?

57
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:25,172
- Did you ever hear anyone say
anything about this woman? - Bill died-

58
00:07:25,275 --> 00:07:27,175
Bill died 'cause their wings
couldn't lift him up.

59
00:07:27,277 --> 00:07:30,371
No, he got shot robbing a liquor store.
What are you talking about?

60
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,007
- Their wings are gold, Max. They
just look black. Feathers- - Get up!

61
00:08:26,821 --> 00:08:28,755
- All right. All right.
- Hey, buddy.

62
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,811
Man, I told you not to come here.

63
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,419
William Preston was a dead end.

64
00:08:35,521 --> 00:08:38,081
I am done helping you, Max.

65
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,626
I paid my debt to society,
you know?

66
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,958
L- I've cooperated enough, man.

67
00:08:45,064 --> 00:08:47,089
Okay?

68
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:49,099
What's goin' on in there?

69
00:08:49,201 --> 00:08:51,431
What? It's a dinner party.
Okay?

70
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:53,596
I'm a little offended
I didn't get my invitation.

71
00:08:53,706 --> 00:08:57,836
I didn't send out invita-
Look, I told you. Go find Bill's partner.

72
00:08:57,943 --> 00:09:00,434
I did. Dougie only wanted to talk
about birds or something.

73
00:09:00,546 --> 00:09:02,707
He was a whack job.
Now I need a new name.

74
00:09:02,815 --> 00:09:04,806
- Well, I'm outta ideas then!
- Hey, baby.

75
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:07,750
- Okay. What- Not now, bitch!
- Asshole!

76
00:09:07,853 --> 00:09:11,584
Look, okay? I told you.
I don't know those kinds of people now.

77
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,715
<i>I've moved up in the world, Max.</i>

78
00:09:13,826 --> 00:09:16,818
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Yeah. Th-Th-This is a dinner party.

79
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:19,625
<i>All right? These are my friends.
Do you remember friends?</i>

80
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:22,292
Listen. If you don't give me a new name...

81
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:24,995
I'm gonna start frisking
every one of your friends.

82
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:27,937
<i>Three years on the street
is a lifetime, man.</i>

83
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,032
<i>Whoever you're lookin'for,
there's no way they are still out there.</i>

84
00:09:31,143 --> 00:09:33,771
You're chasing ghosts, Max. God!

85
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:37,610
You try sleeping once in a while,
you could see that for yourself.

86
00:09:37,716 --> 00:09:39,980
I thought I knew
all ofTrevor's friends.

87
00:09:41,387 --> 00:09:44,049
Max, Natasha.
Natasha, Max.

88
00:09:44,156 --> 00:09:46,522
Jesus Christ!

89
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,526
- Got a light?
- I don't smoke.

90
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:54,359
- That's interesting.
- What?

91
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:56,525
Your tattoo.
That's interesting.

92
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,365
Oh, thank you.

93
00:10:08,614 --> 00:10:10,741
I don't know him. Okay?

94
00:10:11,784 --> 00:10:13,684
- Shit.
- What?

95
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,023
<i>Stay back! What are you doing here?</i>

96
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:22,923
<i>- You can't keep following me around.
- Come with me.</i>

97
00:10:23,028 --> 00:10:25,553
- Hey!
- Mind your own business.

98
00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:27,029
<i>You have no right to be here!</i>

99
00:10:27,132 --> 00:10:28,759
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

100
00:10:28,868 --> 00:10:32,201
<i>I'm clean.
I'm not doing anything wrong.</i>

101
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:34,272
- Da?
- Da.

102
00:10:34,373 --> 00:10:37,342
Hey!
Why don't you relax?

103
00:10:38,444 --> 00:10:41,936
It's a party.
Have a drink.

104
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,709
<i>Just stop it.
These are new friends.</i>

105
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:47,782
<i>I don't see the others anymore!</i>

106
00:10:49,154 --> 00:10:50,178
<i>He's a cop.</i>

107
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:53,190
<i>How much trouble can I get in?</i>

108
00:11:04,336 --> 00:11:08,204
My sister.
Sort of a bitch.

109
00:11:09,308 --> 00:11:11,208
- Hey, Max! Max.
- What are you doing?

110
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,210
You have to go.
Okay? Now.

111
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:15,542
I need to
ask her something first.

112
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,417
Oh, Jesus Christ.

113
00:12:50,451 --> 00:12:53,011
There you are.

114
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,611
Where'd you go?

115
00:12:55,723 --> 00:12:59,284
Take me somewhere. I'll tell you.

116
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:03,353
See you around, Lupino.

117
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,577
Hey.

118
00:13:58,686 --> 00:14:01,553
Easy.

119
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:06,725
You just move in?

120
00:14:06,827 --> 00:14:09,387
So we're somewhere.

121
00:14:09,497 --> 00:14:12,091
What was goin' on
in that room back there?

122
00:14:16,027 --> 00:14:18,325
Hey!

123
00:14:20,465 --> 00:14:23,025
Who was the guy
with the tattoos on his face?

124
00:14:25,803 --> 00:14:28,601
Mmm.

125
00:14:36,848 --> 00:14:38,782
Fine.
What was her name?

126
00:14:39,884 --> 00:14:41,784
What are you talkin' about?
Who?

127
00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:45,686
The girl from the boring story
you want to tell me-

128
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,281
the one that ends
with you living here.

129
00:14:48,393 --> 00:14:51,021
Very sad.

130
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:55,793
<i>I'll tell you what.
Call me by her name.</i>

131
00:14:57,335 --> 00:15:00,896
Like this you can make love to her
just like she never left you.

132
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,773
Oh, Max. I miss you.

133
00:15:09,213 --> 00:15:11,113
Get out.

134
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:16,313
- Excuse me?
- I said, get out now.

135
00:15:20,725 --> 00:15:22,920
<i>You're kicking me
out of your bed?</i>

136
00:15:23,027 --> 00:15:25,689
Yeah.
Get your shit and get out.

137
00:15:54,992 --> 00:15:56,892
This is Owen. Leave a message.

138
00:15:56,994 --> 00:16:00,259
Owen, it's Natasha.

139
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:04,266
Where's Lupino?
I need some more stuff.

140
00:16:04,368 --> 00:16:07,462
Yeah. Call me. Okay?

141
00:16:58,489 --> 00:16:59,979
No!

142
00:17:00,091 --> 00:17:02,753
No, not yet!
Not yet! Not yet!

143
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,483
- What?
- Look. Jump in, will you?

144
00:18:14,932 --> 00:18:18,629
- Where are we going?
- I need you to look at something.

145
00:18:22,974 --> 00:18:25,306
- What about cameras?
Security cameras anywhere?

146
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:27,673
There's got to be somebody
who saw something.

147
00:18:31,883 --> 00:18:33,783
Time of death is?

148
00:18:36,187 --> 00:18:38,451
We got body parts.

149
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,356
<i>- They're already canvassing.
- What happened to them?</i>

150
00:18:43,461 --> 00:18:46,294
Her. Just one.

151
00:18:50,668 --> 00:18:53,865
I don't believe it.

152
00:18:53,971 --> 00:18:57,600
What, are you two back together?
Did you kiss and make up?

153
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,268
Where are we on the weapon?

154
00:19:00,378 --> 00:19:03,108
We're nowhere yet.
I mean, looks like a blade...

155
00:19:03,214 --> 00:19:07,014
but, uh, too much blood
for that to be right.

156
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:10,349
Hey, O'Brien! Just a sec. Hey, listen.

157
00:19:10,454 --> 00:19:14,117
- Why are you showing me this?
- We found this here.

158
00:19:17,361 --> 00:19:19,158
Did you know her, Max?

159
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:39,048
It's Natasha.

160
00:19:41,485 --> 00:19:43,715
Let's take a ride.

161
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:46,847
<i>Folks, we need you
to move back, please.</i>

162
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:13,748
- What are we doing here?
- We're getting a beer, right?

163
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:18,281
You'd rather do this
in the street?

164
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:23,725
Fine. You were with the victim last night.
Your wallet was found in the alley.

165
00:20:23,828 --> 00:20:27,025
If you don't wanna talk to me, they're gonna
send somebody who doesn't know you...

166
00:20:27,131 --> 00:20:29,031
and won't care about
your side of the story.

167
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:32,432
- I didn't kill her. I don't need a side.
- What's goin' on, Max?

168
00:20:32,536 --> 00:20:35,096
What are you mixed up in, man?
You can talk to me.

169
00:20:40,244 --> 00:20:42,940
You know what they think about you
at the force already, right?

170
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:45,515
You should hear all the questions
I get about my old partner.

171
00:20:45,616 --> 00:20:49,746
- Well, good thing you got my back then, huh?
- What's that supposed to mean?

172
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:51,754
It means that with your follow-through
on unsolved murders...

173
00:20:51,856 --> 00:20:53,756
I don't have much hope
for that girl in the alley.

174
00:20:53,858 --> 00:20:55,849
Is that what you think?

175
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,952
That I didn't
work Michelle's case?

176
00:21:01,232 --> 00:21:03,223
I did everything.

177
00:21:03,334 --> 00:21:05,564
<i>- Everything!
- He's still out there somewhere.</i>

178
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:08,263
One of them is still out there.
That's everything.

179
00:21:08,372 --> 00:21:10,499
<i>All right?</i>

180
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:13,475
We're done here.

181
00:21:13,577 --> 00:21:15,977
<i>Come on! Max!</i>

182
00:21:17,648 --> 00:21:19,639
Very good.

183
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,241
<i>Pleasure doing business with you.</i>

184
00:22:14,972 --> 00:22:17,167
- Detective Max Payne-
- Is not available.

185
00:22:17,274 --> 00:22:19,174
- Shit!
- Please leave a message.

186
00:22:19,276 --> 00:22:21,176
Max, it's me, Alex.

187
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:29,411
Ms. Sax?

188
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,420
I'm sorry for your loss.

189
00:22:34,992 --> 00:22:38,189
And we pulled
her cell phone log.

190
00:22:38,295 --> 00:22:42,595
Uh, last call was to an...
Owen Green.

191
00:22:44,668 --> 00:22:46,568
Called him twice.

192
00:23:08,926 --> 00:23:10,917
Max, it's me, Alex.

193
00:23:11,028 --> 00:23:12,996
<i>You're not gonna believe this,
but I think there's a connection...</i>

194
00:23:13,097 --> 00:23:15,156
<i>between that girl in the alley
and Michelle's murder.</i>

195
00:23:15,266 --> 00:23:17,393
<i>I'm heading over
to your apartment right now.</i>

196
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:43,519
Alex, are you in here?

197
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,765
Alex?

198
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:18,854
Alex?

199
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:28,490
Alex?

200
00:25:00,888 --> 00:25:04,415
<i>The E.R. Doctor's old man
was a patrolman in the 45th.</i>

201
00:25:04,525 --> 00:25:06,425
<i>Got you on a quiet floor.</i>

202
00:25:06,527 --> 00:25:09,587
BB? Where am I?

203
00:25:09,697 --> 00:25:11,631
Saint Mary's.

204
00:25:11,732 --> 00:25:15,065
Came in lookin' pretty bad, Max.
What happened?

205
00:25:15,169 --> 00:25:17,660
I don't-

206
00:25:17,771 --> 00:25:20,672
Alex.

207
00:25:20,774 --> 00:25:23,607
When dispatch
couldn't raise him...

208
00:25:23,711 --> 00:25:27,306
they found out from Christa
where he'd gone.

209
00:25:27,414 --> 00:25:30,440
First unit got to you in time.

210
00:25:30,551 --> 00:25:32,451
But Alex was-

211
00:25:34,021 --> 00:25:35,955
Alex was dead.

212
00:25:39,226 --> 00:25:41,558
I got six shots off.
I hit something- someone-

213
00:25:41,662 --> 00:25:43,653
- You gotta check the hospitals.
You gotta check for-

214
00:25:43,764 --> 00:25:47,723
I'm not a cop anymore, Max.
I came to see about you.

215
00:25:49,703 --> 00:25:51,603
He wanted to
tell me something.

216
00:25:51,705 --> 00:25:55,471
Listen. Anything
you can remember will help.

217
00:25:55,576 --> 00:25:57,476
They got nothing for leads.

218
00:25:57,578 --> 00:26:00,479
<i>The whole force has you pegged
as the prime suspect.</i>

219
00:26:00,581 --> 00:26:02,481
Yeah, you tell them
where to find me.

220
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:06,051
Wake starts in an hour.

221
00:26:06,153 --> 00:26:08,053
I'll pass that along.

222
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,421
<i>- What do you think you're doing?
- Paying my respects.</i>

223
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,328
Not like that, you aren't.

224
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:23,426
I should have a clean shirt
for you at the office. It's on the way.

225
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,436
<i>Mr. Hensley? There you go.</i>

226
00:27:06,013 --> 00:27:09,881
- When did they move in here?
- I guess we got the building last year.

227
00:27:09,984 --> 00:27:12,009
- "We"?
- Sorry.

228
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:14,246
Gets to be a habit.

229
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:31,501
- Mornin', Spike.
- Good morning, Mr. Hensley.

230
00:27:31,605 --> 00:27:35,041
You know the drill, sir.
Sign in your guest, please.

231
00:27:38,645 --> 00:27:41,375
Oh, my God.

232
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,076
Max.

233
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:46,311
Ms. Horne.

234
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,048
How have you been?

235
00:27:49,156 --> 00:27:51,147
Fine, thanks.

236
00:27:51,258 --> 00:27:53,920
I hope you know
you can always call me.

237
00:27:54,028 --> 00:27:57,191
<i>Please, Max, if there is
ever anything we can do</i>

238
00:27:57,297 --> 00:28:00,357
I know. I've been meaning to.
I got the cards. Thank you.

239
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:03,493
She was such a bright light
in this company.

240
00:28:07,174 --> 00:28:09,438
I'm not makin' any guarantees
that any of this'll fit.

241
00:28:14,381 --> 00:28:17,214
I saved one of those for you.
Third page from the back.

242
00:28:18,452 --> 00:28:21,478
<i>They set up a scholarship
in her name.</i>

243
00:28:21,588 --> 00:28:24,921
<i>Kept comin'to me for suggestions
about what she might want.</i>

244
00:28:25,025 --> 00:28:28,188
<i>I said art.</i>

245
00:28:28,295 --> 00:28:30,855
She liked art, right?

246
00:28:30,964 --> 00:28:34,866
<i>They knew we were close.
Thought I was family.</i>

247
00:28:34,968 --> 00:28:37,300
It's a nice thing,
a scholarship.

248
00:28:37,404 --> 00:28:39,702
<i>Good way to remember somebody.</i>

249
00:28:39,807 --> 00:28:42,275
Hey, Joe.

250
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:45,209
Max, you rememberJoe,
right?

251
00:28:45,312 --> 00:28:48,042
Hey. You here pickin' up
some overtime?

252
00:28:48,148 --> 00:28:52,312
I'd think twice about that.
Hear the boss is a real asshole.

253
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:56,287
Now that he's head of security,
we're supposed to laugh at his jokes.

254
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,290
They still pay me like the janitor.

255
00:28:58,392 --> 00:29:00,758
<i>She's lookin' for you.</i>

256
00:29:00,861 --> 00:29:02,886
Just tried me
in my office too.

257
00:29:04,431 --> 00:29:06,331
Give me a second.

258
00:29:06,433 --> 00:29:07,900
Yeah?

259
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:10,526
<i>Nicole?</i>

260
00:29:10,637 --> 00:29:13,572
<i>Relax.
I'm the head of security.</i>

261
00:29:35,496 --> 00:29:37,396
Christa.

262
00:29:41,768 --> 00:29:44,362
<i>Jesus.</i>

263
00:29:47,007 --> 00:29:50,272
All it would have taken
is one word from you...

264
00:29:51,378 --> 00:29:53,812
to give Alex some peace.

265
00:29:56,517 --> 00:29:58,576
Are you happy now, Max?

266
00:30:01,889 --> 00:30:04,050
You made him think
he hadn't done enough.

267
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,360
What have you done, Max?

268
00:30:09,796 --> 00:30:11,991
What has Max Payne done?

269
00:30:14,268 --> 00:30:16,168
Except for bring misery...

270
00:30:17,538 --> 00:30:19,733
to everyone
who ever cared for him.

271
00:30:23,443 --> 00:30:26,640
Now please get out of my house.

272
00:30:26,747 --> 00:30:28,647
Please, just go.

273
00:30:44,331 --> 00:30:47,494
Ah, geez.
Watch out for this prick.

274
00:30:48,602 --> 00:30:50,502
Detective Max Payne?

275
00:30:50,604 --> 00:30:53,038
Jim Bravura, Internal Affairs.
I need you to come with me.

276
00:30:54,441 --> 00:30:57,035
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

277
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,975
How'd the girl
have your wallet?

278
00:31:02,082 --> 00:31:04,107
She stole it.

279
00:31:04,218 --> 00:31:06,880
What do you mean, "stole"?
Like, picked your pocket?

280
00:31:10,357 --> 00:31:12,257
How was it
you knew each other?

281
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:14,520
We met through a friend.

282
00:31:16,863 --> 00:31:19,058
Trevor Duncan.

283
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:21,532
- He's your friend?
- I guess.

284
00:31:21,635 --> 00:31:24,001
That's classy.

285
00:31:24,104 --> 00:31:26,595
You know what Trevor does
for a livin', I assume.

286
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,573
He used to snitch for me.

287
00:31:29,676 --> 00:31:31,667
Oh, used to.

288
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,280
Tell me somethin', Max.

289
00:31:36,383 --> 00:31:39,477
What's a glorified file clerk
still need a snitch for, huh?

290
00:31:42,689 --> 00:31:45,249
So you'd piss
in a cup for us, right?

291
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,295
You just said the magic words. Why don't
you call when you hear from a union lawyer?

292
00:31:49,396 --> 00:31:53,264
You and Detective Balder haven't
worked together since your reassignment.

293
00:31:54,768 --> 00:31:57,362
<i>What made you
get back in touch, huh?</i>

294
00:31:57,471 --> 00:32:00,304
<i>- He wanted to talk.
- And?</i>

295
00:32:02,276 --> 00:32:05,074
Hey, asshole!
I got two bodies in 10 body bags.

296
00:32:05,178 --> 00:32:07,078
<i>You were the last person
to see either one.</i>

297
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,445
<i>Yeah, and some of that blood is mine.
Good luck with your case.</i>

298
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,451
Nice work, Detective.

299
00:32:14,788 --> 00:32:19,782
Look, if you're really his friend,
then talk to him.

300
00:32:28,135 --> 00:32:30,797
Well, let's hope that felt good.

301
00:32:30,904 --> 00:32:33,532
Makes you look guilty.
You understand that, right?

302
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,973
It's not just Alex's unit
that thinks you're the guy.

303
00:32:37,077 --> 00:32:40,069
You need friends
on the force right now.

304
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,205
There's only so much I can do
from the outside.

305
00:32:45,285 --> 00:32:47,446
Where you goin'?

306
00:32:50,324 --> 00:32:52,224
Stupid son of a bitch.

307
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,285
<i>Hey. I don't believe it.</i>

308
00:32:56,396 --> 00:33:00,162
<i>- Just the guy.
- You gotta be kiddin'me.</i>

309
00:33:00,267 --> 00:33:03,634
<i>- Let's get the son of a bitch.
- Where you think you're goin'?</i>

310
00:33:03,737 --> 00:33:07,264
<i>- Unbelievable.
- The detective in that office was killed.</i>

311
00:33:07,374 --> 00:33:11,003
<i>Get back here, asshole!
Where do you think you're goin'?</i>

312
00:33:11,111 --> 00:33:12,976
<i>There's no point runnin: Max!
What are you gonna do in there?</i>

313
00:33:22,081 --> 00:33:24,242
Back up. Back up.
Make a hole!

314
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:26,783
Back up, goddamn it!
Make a hole!

315
00:33:27,986 --> 00:33:30,716
<i>- He's a cop killer.
- Open up, Max!</i>

316
00:33:30,823 --> 00:33:33,792
<i>Open up the goddamn door, Max!</i>

317
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:39,693
Open up! Don't make it hard!
Open up!

318
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:46,069
Goddamn it! Open up this fuckin' door!

319
00:33:46,171 --> 00:33:48,765
<i>- Open it!
- Let's bust his face!</i>

320
00:33:48,874 --> 00:33:52,674
<i>- Open the goddamn door!
- You're only gonna make it worse!</i>

321
00:33:54,346 --> 00:33:57,110
<i>Come on, Max!
Get your ass out here!</i>

322
00:33:57,216 --> 00:33:58,615
<i>- Bust it down!
- Open up!</i>

323
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:08,290
<i>Now, Max! Now!
Open the door!</i>

324
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:13,392
Get ya, Max!

325
00:34:13,499 --> 00:34:15,399
Son of a bitch!

326
00:34:24,843 --> 00:34:27,209
Hey, Mike.
Where is he?

327
00:34:31,374 --> 00:34:35,367
Oh, for God's sake, Max. You're gonna freeze
to death. Why don't you come inside?

328
00:34:35,478 --> 00:34:38,538
Alex knew something about Michelle.
Something new.

329
00:34:38,648 --> 00:34:40,548
Don't you think he would've
told you if he had something?

330
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,641
He was trying to
the night he was killed.

331
00:34:42,752 --> 00:34:45,915
- Whatever was in the room-
- What do you think you're looking for?

332
00:34:46,022 --> 00:34:48,217
- Forget it. All right?
- Max, talk to me!

333
00:34:48,324 --> 00:34:50,315
Max?

334
00:34:50,427 --> 00:34:52,725
Now where you goin'?

335
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:05,467
<i>...Max Payne.</i>

336
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:42,971
Drop your weapon.

337
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:45,108
Just take it easy.

338
00:35:47,053 --> 00:35:50,716
<i>Remove your backup piece with your left hand.</i>

339
00:35:59,165 --> 00:36:01,326
- That's it.
- Kneel down.

340
00:36:01,434 --> 00:36:03,425
- What?
- Kneel the fuck down!

341
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:07,238
Shit.

342
00:36:14,314 --> 00:36:16,714
We need to talk about my sister.

343
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,849
Look, my partner was killed too.
We're both looking for the same person.

344
00:36:23,957 --> 00:36:26,187
Yeah, you.

345
00:36:30,954 --> 00:36:33,548
Who's Owen Green?

346
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:38,090
- How did you get that name?
- Look, Natasha called-

347
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:41,392
- Don't say her name!
- I heard her call him. Okay?

348
00:36:41,498 --> 00:36:44,228
Owen's probably the last person
who saw her alive.

349
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:48,896
Yeah? Except for the guy that
left his wallet laying by her body.

350
00:36:49,005 --> 00:36:51,530
Does that sound like something
a homicide cop gets wrong?

351
00:36:51,641 --> 00:36:56,010
Whoever killed your sister probably did
the same thing to my partner and maybe my-

352
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:01,383
Look, you wanna help?
Help me find Owen Green.

353
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,769
<i>Right here.</i>

354
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,930
Green is on the top floor.

355
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:29,173
You know what I do for a living.
You try anything, and I'll kill you.

356
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,760
Who is this guy?

357
00:38:10,862 --> 00:38:13,296
Some junkie
my sister used to know.

358
00:38:45,863 --> 00:38:49,492
<i>Owen! Owen, open up!</i>

359
00:38:50,868 --> 00:38:53,029
<i>Owen?</i>

360
00:38:57,241 --> 00:38:59,266
Owen?

361
00:39:03,714 --> 00:39:05,614
Hey!

362
00:39:07,285 --> 00:39:09,276
They're comin'.

363
00:39:10,388 --> 00:39:12,288
<i>Owen!</i>

364
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,290
<i>Hey, Owen.</i>

365
00:39:16,761 --> 00:39:19,229
They're coming.

366
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,958
Owen, look at me.

367
00:39:22,066 --> 00:39:24,694
<i>Owen, look at me.</i>

368
00:39:24,802 --> 00:39:28,670
I know Natasha called you.
Do you know what happened to her?

369
00:39:30,308 --> 00:39:32,469
She's gone.

370
00:39:35,379 --> 00:39:38,075
They took her.

371
00:39:38,182 --> 00:39:40,116
<i>Owen?</i>

372
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:44,747
Owen, just relax.

373
00:39:44,855 --> 00:39:47,255
They took her up in their wings.

374
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,351
They took her.

375
00:39:53,164 --> 00:39:55,928
<i>Owen-</i>

376
00:40:00,204 --> 00:40:01,501
<i>Owen.</i>

377
00:40:30,224 --> 00:40:32,283
Jesus.

378
00:40:52,313 --> 00:40:56,716
<i>You know, it isn't anything new. Peoplejump
out of windows. They go crazy for no reason.</i>

379
00:40:56,817 --> 00:40:58,978
It just happens.

380
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:05,390
My Natasha
got all her work done here.

381
00:41:16,203 --> 00:41:18,603
I have to
call you back, okay?

382
00:41:21,008 --> 00:41:23,067
Can I help you
with somethin'?

383
00:41:23,177 --> 00:41:25,145
Yeah.

384
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,273
If I wanted to
get this tattoo-

385
00:41:28,382 --> 00:41:30,373
- You in the marine corps?
- This one.

386
00:41:30,484 --> 00:41:33,009
<i>What's it mean?</i>

387
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,554
That's a Norse Valkyrie.

388
00:41:35,656 --> 00:41:38,352
Vikings used to wear them
for protection.

389
00:41:38,459 --> 00:41:43,328
Valkyries fly over the battlefield
picking out the righteous dead.

390
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:47,457
They reward the people
who draw first blood.

391
00:41:47,568 --> 00:41:49,468
A soldier's angel.

392
00:41:52,072 --> 00:41:55,132
In Norse mythology...

393
00:41:55,242 --> 00:41:57,904
the only way
you get to go to heaven...

394
00:41:58,011 --> 00:42:01,003
is to die in violence.

395
00:42:01,115 --> 00:42:04,107
You die in your sleep,
you go to hell.

396
00:42:06,454 --> 00:42:09,753
- Protection from what?
- Huh?

397
00:42:09,858 --> 00:42:12,884
What do you mean, "huh"?
You said people get the tattoo as protection.

398
00:42:12,994 --> 00:42:15,758
What are they afraid of?

399
00:42:18,466 --> 00:42:23,130
<i>Please!</i>

400
00:42:28,343 --> 00:42:30,743
Please-

401
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:11,716
- Come on!
- Callate!

402
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:15,381
<i>Callate!</i>

403
00:43:36,645 --> 00:43:38,806
Oh, God!

404
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,860
This is far enough.

405
00:44:41,609 --> 00:44:44,134
I need to speak with Lincoln.

406
00:45:06,101 --> 00:45:10,902
- You expecting company there, Lincoln?
- It's very dangerous right now.

407
00:45:11,006 --> 00:45:12,906
I hear about your sister.

408
00:45:14,275 --> 00:45:17,574
Yeah?
You know anything about it?

409
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,148
She will not be the last.

410
00:45:24,686 --> 00:45:26,677
What about the tattoos?

411
00:45:26,788 --> 00:45:29,086
Huh? What do they mean?

412
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,090
The wings.

413
00:45:32,527 --> 00:45:34,427
He marks them.

414
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:37,830
Yeah? What does that mean?

415
00:45:37,932 --> 00:45:40,799
The devil
is building his army.

416
00:45:41,903 --> 00:45:43,461
Yeah.

417
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,400
Does this devil have a name?

418
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:50,842
Many.

419
00:45:50,945 --> 00:45:53,641
The one you are looking for
is Lupino.

420
00:45:56,618 --> 00:45:59,587
A place called Rag Na Rock.

421
00:45:59,687 --> 00:46:02,247
<i>It's an old club. East Side.</i>

422
00:46:06,094 --> 00:46:10,121
Listen. Um, you still got
an in with the cops, right?

423
00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:14,402
See if they know anything
about a Detective Max Payne.

424
00:46:14,502 --> 00:46:17,027
Max Payne?

425
00:46:19,074 --> 00:46:21,042
What?

426
00:46:21,142 --> 00:46:23,940
<i>Max Payne-
he's been hunting.</i>

427
00:46:25,213 --> 00:46:28,444
Three years
of kicking down doors.

428
00:46:30,752 --> 00:46:33,414
He is looking
for something...

429
00:46:33,521 --> 00:46:36,649
that God wants
to stay hidden.

430
00:46:36,758 --> 00:46:40,751
And that's what makes him
even more dangerous.

431
00:46:45,266 --> 00:46:49,600
Mona,
stay away from Max Payne.

432
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,436
You don't want to be near him
when Judgment Day comes.

433
00:47:07,255 --> 00:47:09,951
<i>They took her up in their wings.</i>

434
00:47:10,058 --> 00:47:12,754
<i>Their wings are golden.
The feathers only look black.</i>

435
00:47:14,796 --> 00:47:16,764
<i>That's a Norse Valkyrie.</i>

436
00:47:16,865 --> 00:47:19,698
<i>A soldier's angel.</i>

437
00:47:19,801 --> 00:47:21,996
<i>She was
such a bright light in this company.</i>

438
00:49:34,302 --> 00:49:36,964
- What is it? What's going on?
- Coffee?

439
00:49:37,071 --> 00:49:39,062
It isn't that
I've been missing something.

440
00:49:40,508 --> 00:49:42,408
<i>It's that something is missing.</i>

441
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:46,139
<i>- So?
- BB, what do you mean, "so"?</i>

442
00:49:46,247 --> 00:49:48,545
What would somebody want
with her work papers?

443
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:50,208
I don't know.

444
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:52,786
Who would then? Her old supervisor-
What is his name?

445
00:49:52,887 --> 00:49:55,788
<i>- Max, this has gone far enough! - That
snotty-nosed, little preppy prick- What is his name?</i>

446
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:58,552
Colvin. John Colvin.
Is he still around?

447
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,924
Hold on, Max.

448
00:50:01,029 --> 00:50:03,054
BB, is he still working
for the company?

449
00:50:06,768 --> 00:50:08,668
Jason Colvin.

450
00:50:09,704 --> 00:50:11,604
Guy's name is Jason.

451
00:50:11,706 --> 00:50:13,867
Thank you.

452
00:50:27,021 --> 00:50:28,921
<i>This is Detective Bravura.</i>

453
00:50:29,023 --> 00:50:32,424
<i>Detective, I need to speak
with you about Max right away.</i>

454
00:50:32,527 --> 00:50:34,654
<i>Please. It's urgent.</i>

455
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:39,596
<i>Detective, thanks for seeing me at my office.</i>

456
00:50:39,701 --> 00:50:41,999
<i>I need to explain
what happened to Max.</i>

457
00:50:42,103 --> 00:50:44,867
A file
can't tell you everything.

458
00:50:44,972 --> 00:50:48,408
Maybe you think that's all
you need to know about Max.

459
00:50:53,114 --> 00:50:56,083
<i>Can't tell you
how beautiful Michelle was...</i>

460
00:50:57,719 --> 00:50:59,778
how happy they were together-

461
00:51:05,326 --> 00:51:08,261
<i>Can't tell you how the baby
lookedjust like him.</i>

462
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:21,674
<i>It started out as a robbery.</i>

463
00:51:24,846 --> 00:51:29,806
<i>The perps were losers, garbage.
Had records, but nothing big.</i>

464
00:51:32,387 --> 00:51:35,151
<i>That day, though, who knows?</i>

465
00:51:37,258 --> 00:51:40,159
<i>Guess they were out
for something... more.</i>

466
00:52:22,537 --> 00:52:25,199
Michelle!

467
00:52:25,306 --> 00:52:28,764
Michelle! Michelle!

468
00:52:28,876 --> 00:52:32,334
Michelle!

469
00:52:37,452 --> 00:52:40,717
It's okay. The angels burn
within them now.

470
00:53:38,779 --> 00:53:42,545
<i>He was maybe 10 minutes too late.</i>

471
00:53:48,289 --> 00:53:51,725
<i>That's all.
Ten minutes.</i>

472
00:54:04,906 --> 00:54:07,466
We looked everywhere for the third guy.
But there was nothin' to go on.

473
00:54:09,302 --> 00:54:10,462
<i>Max...</i>

474
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:15,064
<i>transferred to Cold Case,
working leads that went nowhere.</i>

475
00:54:15,175 --> 00:54:20,078
<i>He was... never the same.</i>

476
00:54:21,514 --> 00:54:24,381
Of course not.

477
00:54:24,484 --> 00:54:29,478
Understand.
This is my old partner's kid.

478
00:54:31,424 --> 00:54:34,552
He's family.
You gotta help him here.

479
00:54:35,862 --> 00:54:38,296
You should hear the kind of things
Max is saying.

480
00:54:38,398 --> 00:54:40,662
<i>None of it
makes any sense.</i>

481
00:54:40,767 --> 00:54:44,760
He's gotten in his head that someone here
at the company is responsible.

482
00:54:44,871 --> 00:54:50,639
I'm worried he's gonna... get into another
situation before I can convince him to come in.

483
00:54:52,545 --> 00:54:55,105
- So you really think he's-
- I think you need to find him.

484
00:55:28,581 --> 00:55:30,515
What is it, Jason?

485
00:55:31,651 --> 00:55:33,551
I, uh-

486
00:55:48,835 --> 00:55:51,463
Is this a threat?

487
00:55:52,672 --> 00:55:55,903
No! No, I-

488
00:55:56,943 --> 00:55:58,911
I just thought
you should be aware.

489
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:03,281
Just take care of it, Jason.

490
00:56:27,607 --> 00:56:29,802
You'll have the opportunity
to come in and talk to-

491
00:56:34,914 --> 00:56:36,814
There's someone in your office.

492
00:56:41,454 --> 00:56:43,479
It's a detective.

493
00:56:59,022 --> 00:57:01,047
This your daughter?

494
00:57:02,793 --> 00:57:06,024
Yes, it is.
Three years old.

495
00:57:06,129 --> 00:57:08,063
She's beautiful.

496
00:57:08,165 --> 00:57:10,497
Is there something I can
help you with, Detective?

497
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:12,796
I don't know yet.

498
00:57:15,272 --> 00:57:18,173
Maybe if you told me
what this was about.

499
00:57:19,509 --> 00:57:22,774
It's a homicide-
multiple homicides.

500
00:57:25,249 --> 00:57:27,149
I didn't get your name.

501
00:57:29,186 --> 00:57:31,711
Max Payne.

502
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:35,857
Sorry.
I didn't recognize you.

503
00:57:35,959 --> 00:57:38,689
That's okay.

504
00:57:38,795 --> 00:57:41,161
What can you tell me about
what Michelle was working on...

505
00:57:43,267 --> 00:57:45,167
right before she died?

506
00:57:52,843 --> 00:57:54,936
I don't know, routine projects.
Um-

507
00:57:57,114 --> 00:57:59,014
Nothin' really
out of the ordinary.

508
00:58:05,689 --> 00:58:08,886
Look, it's really hard
to be specific that... long ago.

509
00:58:08,992 --> 00:58:11,961
- Um-
- Well, can't you look it up?

510
00:58:13,864 --> 00:58:16,162
I don't know how I would,
really.

511
00:58:19,069 --> 00:58:22,698
You know th-that far back,
uh, any documents we had-

512
00:58:22,806 --> 00:58:26,401
Would be gone, and-

513
00:58:29,379 --> 00:58:31,347
I'm not-
I'm not sure of any other way.

514
00:58:31,448 --> 00:58:33,416
So there's just no trace of her?

515
00:58:33,517 --> 00:58:36,281
Well, it's nothing personal.
We just, uh-

516
00:58:37,721 --> 00:58:40,690
Can't keep-
Save everything and, uh-

517
00:58:40,791 --> 00:58:44,192
- You need to make a call?
- Maybe I should.

518
00:58:44,294 --> 00:58:48,754
Yeah. Beautiful office
you have here.

519
00:58:48,865 --> 00:58:53,234
Jackie, hi. Uh, Detective-

520
00:58:54,971 --> 00:58:56,768
- What do you know?
- Wait.

521
00:58:58,975 --> 00:59:02,536
- I need to talk to somebody about a woman that used to work here.
- You can have a seat over there.

522
00:59:07,273 --> 00:59:09,605
Uh, Mr. Colvin?

523
00:59:09,709 --> 00:59:11,802
- You're lying to me! Why?
- I'm not!

524
00:59:11,911 --> 00:59:14,880
<i>Mr. Colvin?</i>

525
00:59:14,981 --> 00:59:17,609
- Tell me what happened to Michelle.
- I don't know.

526
00:59:17,717 --> 00:59:19,412
Mr. Colvin, are you okay?

527
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:23,114
<i>- Jackie!
- Mr. Colvin, it's Jackie! I can hear you!</i>

528
00:59:23,222 --> 00:59:25,281
<i>Are you all right?</i>

529
00:59:28,561 --> 00:59:32,122
- What was she working on?
- I don't know!

530
00:59:32,231 --> 00:59:35,098
I was in charge of a different project.
It was a government contract.

531
00:59:35,201 --> 00:59:36,828
What did it have to do
with Michelle?

532
00:59:36,936 --> 00:59:39,302
Nothing! She was just-

533
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,840
Security.

534
00:59:42,942 --> 00:59:44,842
Can I speak to BB, please?

535
00:59:46,979 --> 00:59:49,072
- Yeah?
- BB, help! It's Jackie. Jason's in trouble.

536
00:59:49,182 --> 00:59:51,082
- What?
- Should I call your guys?

537
00:59:51,184 --> 00:59:54,381
- No, no, no. I'll call.
- Hurry, please.

538
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:59,858
Oh, shit. Okay.

539
00:59:59,959 --> 01:00:02,519
It was a military operation.

540
01:00:02,628 --> 01:00:07,292
<i>It was something to make...
soldiers more aggressive in combat.</i>

541
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:13,270
It was a disaster. It only worked
on one percent. Made them invincible.

542
01:00:13,373 --> 01:00:17,969
All right? The rest suffered horrible
hallucinations- devils, demons.

543
01:00:20,146 --> 01:00:22,341
<i>It drove them insane.</i>

544
01:00:22,448 --> 01:00:26,578
I mean,
the effects were uncontrollable.

545
01:00:26,686 --> 01:00:31,282
And the stuff was so addictive, we couldn't
even guarantee the safety of our own scientists.

546
01:00:31,391 --> 01:00:36,556
<i>And we had to shut it down.
The test subjects, they'd follow 'em home.</i>

547
01:00:36,662 --> 01:00:39,028
They'd kill 'em,
just for an extra dose.

548
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:43,932
- Is that what happened to Michelle?
- No.

549
01:00:46,539 --> 01:00:48,439
<i>Let's go! Move! Move!</i>

550
01:00:55,915 --> 01:00:58,406
- What do you mean, no? What happened to her then?
- Please! Jesus!

551
01:00:58,518 --> 01:01:02,750
Please! Look. She didn't even know
what was coming for her.

552
01:01:02,855 --> 01:01:06,313
<i>Mr. Colvin, I called security,
and they're on their way!</i>

553
01:01:06,426 --> 01:01:10,920
I will tell you what happened. You gotta
get me outta here though. Right now.

554
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:13,965
- What are you talking about?
- I will confess to everything, but you gotta get me outta here!

555
01:01:14,066 --> 01:01:16,933
That's not good enough! You tell me
what happened to her right now!

556
01:01:17,036 --> 01:01:21,268
She was killed because of the drugs!
The envelope.

557
01:01:21,374 --> 01:01:24,366
<i>Bring it with us.
Everything. It's all in there.</i>

558
01:01:24,477 --> 01:01:28,140
Please. You've gotta
protect me from them.

559
01:01:28,247 --> 01:01:30,078
Who are you talking about?

560
01:01:30,183 --> 01:01:32,617
The man who killed your wife!

561
01:01:32,718 --> 01:01:35,619
Get the envelope.
Get it!

562
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:39,249
Let's go.

563
01:01:42,695 --> 01:01:44,663
Calm down!

564
01:01:44,764 --> 01:01:47,164
Relax! N.Y.P. D!

565
01:02:20,566 --> 01:02:22,295
<i>Shots fired!</i>

566
01:02:28,441 --> 01:02:30,773
- Central Dispatch.
- This is Jim Bravura. I.A.

567
01:02:30,877 --> 01:02:32,936
What unit is responding
to the Aesir call?

568
01:02:38,384 --> 01:02:40,215
The Aesir building! You mean
nobody's called anything in yet?

569
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:43,186
- Would you like to report an incident?
- Hell, yes, I'd like to report somethin'!

570
01:02:43,289 --> 01:02:44,779
We have machine gun fire
in Midtown!

571
01:02:52,398 --> 01:02:53,422
Fire!

572
01:02:57,537 --> 01:02:59,004
<i>God damn it!</i>

573
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:06,174
<i>Get down!</i>

574
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,054
Move! Move! Move! Move!

575
01:03:21,727 --> 01:03:23,991
<i>Hold fire! Hold fire!</i>

576
01:03:43,916 --> 01:03:47,113
- Knock down that door!
- Put your hands up!

577
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:49,551
- You need to come in now!
- Not a chance!

578
01:03:49,655 --> 01:03:51,646
- Come on!
- Is this about your wife?

579
01:03:51,757 --> 01:03:54,317
- Colvin knew.
- Take it easy, Max.

580
01:03:54,427 --> 01:03:56,691
Just come in and we'll talk about this
right now. All right?

581
01:03:56,796 --> 01:03:59,856
Clear!

582
01:04:02,134 --> 01:04:04,034
Move!

583
01:04:04,136 --> 01:04:06,104
- Where is he?
- I can't see!

584
01:04:06,205 --> 01:04:08,105
Got anything?

585
01:04:08,207 --> 01:04:10,402
No, he's gone!

586
01:04:10,509 --> 01:04:13,239
Great job, boys! See what you did?
You let 'im get away.

587
01:04:13,346 --> 01:04:15,541
<i>- Let me see your hands!
- Relax, motherfucker! N.Y.P.D.</i>

588
01:04:15,648 --> 01:04:18,242
<i>- What the fuck is goin'on up there?
- Yeah. Good job!</i>

589
01:04:18,351 --> 01:04:21,184
Everybody gonna get a medal for this.
Great! Damn!

590
01:04:28,894 --> 01:04:30,521
I'm at the office.
I'll call you back.

591
01:04:59,215 --> 01:05:04,312
<i>...and will forever give them
the combat edge in conflicts of the future.</i>

592
01:05:04,421 --> 01:05:10,018
<i>Valkyr- 100% effective.
100% combat tested.</i>

593
01:05:10,126 --> 01:05:13,357
<i>The new weapon
in the war on terror.</i>

594
01:05:13,463 --> 01:05:16,523
<i>Valkyr, the strength of freedom.</i>

595
01:05:16,633 --> 01:05:21,229
<i>- Valkyr, winning the war on terror.
- You need to see this.</i>

596
01:05:23,907 --> 01:05:26,307
<i>From the dawn of time...</i>

597
01:05:26,409 --> 01:05:30,277
great generals have always known
the one fundamental truth of warfare.

598
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:33,178
<i>Morale wins battles.</i>

599
01:05:33,283 --> 01:05:37,014
Thanks to the breakthroughs made
by Aesir Pharmaceuticals...

600
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:43,059
the military of tomorrow will be able to
unlock the limitless potential inside every soldier.

601
01:05:43,159 --> 01:05:48,961
<i>Introducing Valkyr.
The strength of freedom.</i>

602
01:05:50,133 --> 01:05:53,227
<i>That's what this is about? A drug?</i>

603
01:06:01,044 --> 01:06:06,482
How has your experience of combat
improved since taking the drug Valkyr?

604
01:06:06,583 --> 01:06:09,916
Well, I'm never scared, for starters.

605
01:06:10,019 --> 01:06:14,456
<i>Describe to me, if you will,
how is Valkyr winning the war on terror?</i>

606
01:06:14,557 --> 01:06:17,287
You face down
a group of insurgents...

607
01:06:17,393 --> 01:06:22,456
and instead of fear,
you're filled with, um, peace, I guess.

608
01:06:22,565 --> 01:06:26,001
<i>It's like something's
watching over you from above.</i>

609
01:06:26,102 --> 01:06:27,797
You feel like you have wings.

610
01:06:27,904 --> 01:06:31,772
<i>So wouldn't you say you feel stronger,
more secure, more capable?</i>

611
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:36,369
Oh, definitely. It's just whatever it takes
to win the war out there.

612
01:06:36,479 --> 01:06:39,642
I feel indestructible.
Nothing can stop me.

613
01:06:39,749 --> 01:06:41,979
I can face anything.

614
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:45,145
<i>Have you noticed any side effects?</i>

615
01:06:47,857 --> 01:06:50,553
I can only speak for myself,
and, um, no.

616
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:55,324
- I apologize. You wanna do it again?
- No, we're good.

617
01:06:55,431 --> 01:06:59,162
<i>That's enough. Turn it off.</i>

618
01:07:01,204 --> 01:07:04,571
Killed my wife.

619
01:07:04,674 --> 01:07:06,835
<i>Natasha too.</i>

620
01:07:08,778 --> 01:07:11,178
He's in an old club
called Rag Na Rock.

621
01:07:14,851 --> 01:07:19,151
- You know where it is?
- Yeah.

622
01:07:26,496 --> 01:07:29,863
<i>Forget it, Max.
You go there, you die.</i>

623
01:07:33,369 --> 01:07:35,929
You have my help with anything else,
but not to go in there.

624
01:07:36,039 --> 01:07:37,939
Yeah, you keep it then.

625
01:07:42,045 --> 01:07:44,240
You don't wanna
make it out alive.

626
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:50,381
You think that if he puts you out
of your misery, you'll be with them again.

627
01:07:51,955 --> 01:07:54,685
Yeah, I hope
that's how it works.

628
01:09:25,381 --> 01:09:27,679
<i>Copy that. You need help up front?</i>

629
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:34,720
<i>Unit Six, Lupino is secure.</i>

630
01:10:01,289 --> 01:10:03,223
Ow!

631
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:07,291
You hear them coming.

632
01:14:10,504 --> 01:14:14,065
We'll see which one of us
they're flying for.

633
01:14:14,175 --> 01:14:16,905
We'll see which one of us
they love best.

634
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:21,648
God, you're so blessed.

635
01:14:23,384 --> 01:14:28,651
The angels-The angels are not
done with you yet!

636
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:54,138
BB?

637
01:14:59,779 --> 01:15:01,804
What's goin' on here, BB?

638
01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:05,908
Let's go.

639
01:15:06,019 --> 01:15:09,147
Let's get outta here.

640
01:15:16,329 --> 01:15:18,854
BB- BB, what's goin' on here?

641
01:15:18,965 --> 01:15:22,833
BB, I looked at Lupino, he didn't know
who I was. What are you doin' here?

642
01:15:27,474 --> 01:15:29,942
- Now?
- No, not yet!

643
01:15:30,043 --> 01:15:32,011
Cuff him.

644
01:15:37,384 --> 01:15:41,821
<i>What was I supposed to do?
Michelle kept nosin'around.</i>

645
01:15:41,921 --> 01:15:45,186
<i>Some boxes from a dead project
went missing.</i>

646
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:47,953
She mentioned it to me without knowing
what it really meant.

647
01:15:48,061 --> 01:15:51,690
I had to-
I had to talk to her.

648
01:15:51,798 --> 01:15:55,529
Show her my side
before she took it to someone else.

649
01:15:55,635 --> 01:15:57,796
<i>Before that night...</i>

650
01:15:57,904 --> 01:16:01,396
<i>the things that went wrong for me
seemed impossible to do anything about.</i>

651
01:16:03,143 --> 01:16:07,876
Michelle was the first problem in my life
small enough to reach out and stop.

652
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:14,140
Once that happened, though, once I realized
I could use the strength of my hands...

653
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:17,242
to keep one thing
from being taken away from me-

654
01:16:18,654 --> 01:16:23,557
Well, by the time Michelle
stopped screaming that night...

655
01:16:23,659 --> 01:16:25,854
I'd learned
the most amazing lesson.

656
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:31,222
I could've been doing this
my entire life.

657
01:16:33,669 --> 01:16:37,366
I was a new person
that night.

658
01:16:39,108 --> 01:16:42,635
All the other things
that I'd ever let go.

659
01:16:42,745 --> 01:16:47,910
The-The times I'd accepted
my own... weakness...

660
01:16:48,017 --> 01:16:50,508
I could've just reached out
my hands and stopped it.

661
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:55,250
<i>And from there, figuring out
how to put the drug on the street...</i>

662
01:16:55,358 --> 01:17:00,057
how to make use of Lupino and
the rest of them, well, that was easy.

663
01:17:00,163 --> 01:17:02,529
But only because of Michelle-

664
01:17:02,632 --> 01:17:05,999
the first problem
I really solved for myself.

665
01:17:08,504 --> 01:17:12,600
The second... was the baby.

666
01:17:32,495 --> 01:17:35,396
Okay, enough.
Enough of this shit.

667
01:17:35,498 --> 01:17:37,398
BB!

668
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,992
Joe, why don't you
calm the fuck down?

669
01:17:52,181 --> 01:17:55,673
It's not like we didn't see it comin'.

670
01:17:55,785 --> 01:17:58,083
Sullen, withdrawn.

671
01:17:58,187 --> 01:18:01,088
<i>Max just never seemed
the same after the tragedy.</i>

672
01:18:03,092 --> 01:18:04,787
Grab me some of that rope.

673
01:18:05,027 --> 01:18:09,020
It's a good thing his father
didn't live to see it though.

674
01:18:09,131 --> 01:18:14,068
<i>The great Bill Payne's only son.</i>

675
01:18:15,771 --> 01:18:20,504
A strung-out
junkie suicide.

676
01:18:22,178 --> 01:18:23,736
It would have eaten him alive-

677
01:18:29,619 --> 01:18:30,916
<i>Get him, Joe!</i>

678
01:18:55,702 --> 01:18:59,331
Screw him.
He'll freeze to death.

679
01:19:02,042 --> 01:19:03,942
Come on.

680
01:20:35,669 --> 01:20:37,637
Not yet, Max.

681
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:13,525
<i>Bravura! What the hell is goin'on?</i>

682
01:23:13,627 --> 01:23:18,155
Why is half my force here instead of out
on the street? Under what authority do you-

683
01:23:18,265 --> 01:23:21,792
I am investigating the shooting
of an unarmed civilian, Jason Colvin.

684
01:23:21,902 --> 01:23:24,700
And the attempted murder
of Detective Max Payne.

685
01:23:24,804 --> 01:23:26,704
Really? Well, I heard
he took the first shot.

686
01:23:26,806 --> 01:23:30,537
If I know the men I serve with, I don't think
that they're gonna contradict that.

687
01:23:30,644 --> 01:23:33,010
- Yeah, and what kinda men would that be?
- These are real cops.

688
01:23:33,113 --> 01:23:34,808
- Oh.
- No offense.

689
01:23:34,915 --> 01:23:40,080
None taken. Agent Taliente,
I'd like you to meet a real cop.

690
01:23:40,186 --> 01:23:44,486
Detective. Jack Taliente,
Special Agent, F.B.I. Who are you?

691
01:23:50,664 --> 01:23:53,827
Bravura called in the F.B.I.

692
01:23:53,934 --> 01:23:55,868
They're on their way.

693
01:23:59,172 --> 01:24:03,302
For God sakes, come on!
Max is dead! They got nothin' else!

694
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:05,674
<i>Come on!</i>

695
01:24:07,047 --> 01:24:09,777
- Get 'em in! Get 'em in!
- Car's waiting! Let's go!

696
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:13,718
<i>Hit the button! P1!</i>

697
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:16,721
Calm down, Joe.

698
01:24:16,823 --> 01:24:20,054
This is Air One
proceeding northbound 3-5-0-500.

699
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:23,220
E.T.A. Three mikes.
Give me a frequency to push to.

700
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:26,891
<i>P.D. Air One,
please return my frequency. 126-105.</i>

701
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,195
Copy that, Dispatch.
We're inbound.

702
01:24:31,338 --> 01:24:33,363
Your car's waiting, sir.

703
01:24:48,855 --> 01:24:50,823
Oh, shit.

704
01:24:53,054 --> 01:24:55,648
- He's not dead. He's here.
- Bullshit.

705
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,224
- Let's move it! Move! Move!
- Go!

706
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:05,491
Get him, Joe!

707
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,534
Where the hell is he?

708
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:13,206
Where the hell you going, Joe?

709
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:19,679
<i>- P.D. Air One, say your last.
- We need more information.</i>

710
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:23,512
Do you got Bravura on the line for us? We need-
We need more information on this situation.

711
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:25,381
Who you callin'?

712
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:31,653
It's late.

713
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:36,322
- I need you to send a helicopter to the roof.
- What are you talking about, BB?

714
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:39,525
The Michelle Payne thing's
coming back on us!

715
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:53,804
<i>Air One,
this is LieutenantJim Bravura.</i>

716
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:56,577
<i>Federal agents and uniforms
are inbound at this time.</i>

717
01:26:09,697 --> 01:26:12,427
Take some C-4.

718
01:26:12,534 --> 01:26:16,630
- Wire it so he can't make it to the roof.
- Are you nuts?

719
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:19,263
<i>You saw him.</i>

720
01:26:19,374 --> 01:26:22,366
<i>You saw him, Joe.
He isn't gonna stop.</i>

721
01:26:30,118 --> 01:26:31,915
No!

722
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:51,705
Okay, we got multiple shots
fired. We need back-up ASAP.

723
01:26:51,806 --> 01:26:52,773
<i>Copy that, P.D. Air One.</i>

724
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:16,180
<i>- Michelle?
- Max.</i>

725
01:27:18,725 --> 01:27:20,886
Max?

726
01:28:32,055 --> 01:28:36,549
Max! Max, come on.

727
01:28:36,659 --> 01:28:40,857
Listen, I will hold them off for as long
as I can, but you have to finish this.

728
01:28:40,964 --> 01:28:44,991
Max, come on.

729
01:28:45,101 --> 01:28:48,195
Come on.
Come on. Take it.

730
01:28:48,304 --> 01:28:49,896
Take it!

731
01:28:52,776 --> 01:28:54,676
Max, come on.
Look at me.

732
01:28:57,180 --> 01:28:59,307
You're not done yet.

733
01:29:09,759 --> 01:29:14,025
Come on. Come on, pick up!
Where are you? Come on!

734
01:29:47,630 --> 01:29:51,498
<i>Be careful with that thing.</i>

735
01:29:51,601 --> 01:29:54,468
Come on now, Mona.

736
01:29:55,638 --> 01:29:58,072
I'm sure we can
work something out.

737
01:30:06,049 --> 01:30:08,643
BB!

738
01:30:34,878 --> 01:30:40,248
<i>Detective Max Payne is in the line
of fire. Snipers, do not take the shot.</i>

739
01:30:43,286 --> 01:30:46,847
- Bravura!
- You take Payne alive if there's anything left.

740
01:31:05,742 --> 01:31:08,370
Calm down, BB.

741
01:31:14,475 --> 01:31:17,967
Holy shit!
Breaker, this is Air One.

742
01:31:32,559 --> 01:31:34,993
Run!

743
01:31:35,095 --> 01:31:36,995
Go! Go!

744
01:31:52,246 --> 01:31:54,441
<i>LaGuardia Tower, this is P.D. Air One.</i>

745
01:31:54,548 --> 01:31:56,778
<i>We have a major explosion
at the Aesir building.</i>

746
01:31:56,884 --> 01:31:58,943
<i>Bravura! You all right?</i>

747
01:31:59,053 --> 01:32:01,715
- Get everybody upstairs! Now!
- Guys, that's our cue.

748
01:32:01,822 --> 01:32:05,223
- Division One, upstairs! Right now!
On the double! Let's go!

749
01:32:09,463 --> 01:32:14,162
Where are you?

750
01:32:45,897 --> 01:32:49,162
It's unbelievable, all that snow.

751
01:32:49,267 --> 01:32:51,667
And watch it end up
being a beautiful day.

752
01:32:55,173 --> 01:32:57,505
You want my confession first?

753
01:34:10,574 --> 01:34:13,600
<i>I don't know about heaven.</i>

754
01:34:19,583 --> 01:34:21,813
<i>But I do believe in angels.</i>

755
01:34:24,955 --> 01:34:27,856
Yeah. It's Daddy.

756
01:34:27,958 --> 01:34:32,258
<i>- Hey, buddy.
- Is that your daddy?</i>

757
01:34:40,437 --> 01:34:43,201
Not yet, Max.

758
01:34:47,778 --> 01:34:51,805
We have him. Max Payne is alive.
He's okay. We got him.

759
01:41:37,621 --> 01:41:39,885
It's good to have you back.

760
01:42:12,722 --> 01:42:14,815
Hey.
