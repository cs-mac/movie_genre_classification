1
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,575
Eleanor Roosevelt?

2
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,038
Virginia Woolf?

3
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,542
Amanda Lear?

4
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:29,213
Liz Taylor?

5
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,092
Marie...

6
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:34,718
Marie.

7
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,845
Marie Curie.

8
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,989
Benazir Bhutto?

9
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,593
Maria Callas?

10
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,661
Bravo, Margaret.

11
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,705
Heard you clinched the deal.

12
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,914
My schedule?

13
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,334
Got the black dress, car's waiting, 15 minutes.

14
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,212
Find Malcolm, we meet at a quarter to.

15
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,339
I think that's pushing it.

16
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,675
Pushing it? I dine on frozen food,

17
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:00,137
sob over Toy Story 2,
sell global-warming power plants,

18
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,182
pushing it is not a problem.

19
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,142
- Low cut?
- The dress?

20
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,979
Full cleavage for the Chinese.
Overkill, but they like it.

21
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,857
I think the Chinese prefer the nape,

22
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,110
yet your breasts deserve to be seen...

23
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,196
Arnaud, am I dreaming?

24
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,823
Hold on.

25
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,040
What's a karstic aquafer? A disease?

26
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,334
Aquifer!

27
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,835
Just about.

28
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,713
So, at worst, the contract blows,

29
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,423
at best, the plant.

30
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,593
What do we pay experts top dollar for?

31
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,887
Listen, you've hooked the Chinese.

32
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,181
You could sell scales to a snake,

33
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,474
flames to Lucifer!

34
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,477
Meaning, other such plants

35
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,897
have already been built on karstic aquifers.

36
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,983
So, where else? Bhopal, Chernobyl?

37
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,406
So, the Americans are undercutting us?

38
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,532
They built the Mattel plant

39
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,661
on floodable terrain...

40
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,622
So let's call Ken and Barbie to ask how!

41
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,043
Then we keep our cool.

42
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,881
While the competition is promising the moon

43
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:23,345
our only advantage is to be rock solid.

44
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,433
Coffee?

45
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,602
It's tepid.

46
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,854
The re-assessment. Another coffee?

47
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,731
No, I'd rather you at your post.

48
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,776
A country notary is here to see you.

49
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,570
Seems like family business.

50
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,823
Just needs a signature.

51
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,116
Who? To sign what?

52
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,786
Mr Merignac, from a village down south, Saou...

53
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,415
It's pronounced "Sou".
Drome region, district of Crest-Sud.

54
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,083
Should I cancel?

55
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,421
I'll just freshen up. Be right there.

56
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,173
Margaret, I didn't yet get time to say it. . .

57
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,925
Happy birthday!

58
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,393
Not now! Why tonight?

59
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,397
Couldn't he forget me, or die, or both!

60
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,111
He's just a country notary.

61
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,365
Maria Callas.

62
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,118
Appear unshakeable.

63
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,836
This is our excuse for coffee.

64
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,630
It's best we talk here...

65
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:43,800
It's hot!

66
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,761
And undrinkable.

67
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,180
I'm not a coffee person.

68
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,639
So, Saou. . .

69
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:53,101
300 people, a 1 5th Century chapel,
a bowling ground,

70
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,686
one bus a day and even a notary.

71
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,481
A notary now retired.

72
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,524
Saou no longer needs notaries.

73
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,235
Not like here.

74
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,364
I came once before, in 91 .

75
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,490
It's changed, no?

76
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:10,660
It sure has. I hardly recognised it.

77
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,538
Even you, I wouldn't have...

78
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,500
recognised you.

79
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,793
I meant the place.

80
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,461
We've met?

81
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,964
Sorry, but I'm hopeless with names.

82
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,259
I just need you to sign...

83
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,178
Here. . .

84
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,055
Excuse me...

85
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,517
300 what? Million?

86
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,976
Can do better.

87
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:40,023
Okay, be done in 3 minutes.

88
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,528
Sounds like a hot deal.

89
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:45,946
Yeah, everything's "hot" here:

90
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,323
coffee, business and schedule.

91
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,076
Not a fun birthday.

92
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,536
You said it.

93
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:57,290
Aren't you surprised I know your birth date?

94
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,209
Sorry?

95
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,047
Still don't recognise me?

96
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,385
Must be a mistake.

97
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,430
My name is Margaret Flore, not Marguerite.

98
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,598
But it's not the first time.

99
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,727
A mistake...Well,

100
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,021
here's the mistake.

101
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,444
Well, I'm just in time to catch my train...

102
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,195
That's all?

103
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,740
Expecting something else?

104
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,201
Patience.

105
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,711
- How long have I got?
- 7 minutes.

106
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,589
I stalled the driver,
checked the dress: low-cut...

107
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,177
"Marguerite Flore, wherever she is,
on 21 Sept. 201 0."

108
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,053
Say, Arnaud,

109
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,015
for my birthday, I hope you didn't order flowers?

110
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,434
Little do you know me, Margaret.

111
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,936
No, they're not for here.

112
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,772
But if you're done, we'd better go.

113
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,109
Tell Malcolm we meet downstairs.
Don't forget the dress.

114
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,781
Arnaud.

115
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,825
Change of plan, downstairs in 1 5.

116
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,245
What? I think we should go now...

117
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,830
Don't think!

118
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,172
Letters 3 and 4...

119
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,843
Letter 1 .

120
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,306
Dear me,

121
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,766
first, happi birthday.

122
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,393
Wow, can't even spell "happy"!

123
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,438
I have a present for you. Hope you like it.

124
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,232
They're my favourites

125
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,108
and I've got almost 200.

126
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,654
Today, I'm seven. The age of reason.

127
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,990
It's the neatest birthday I've ever had.

128
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,286
There's Dad,

129
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,248
Mom, my little brother. . .

130
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,625
Lots of movers.

131
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,050
No furniture left

132
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,471
and even a bailiff with a repossession order.

133
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,476
We played lots of new games.

134
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,353
We played shadows,

135
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,854
echoes,

136
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,189
even beggars.

137
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,650
It's so corny!

138
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,444
The Queen piled up 21 mattresses

139
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,573
and slipped a pea underneath.

140
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,493
And Mom made me a princess's dress. . .

141
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,748
I can feel the pea!

142
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,959
with the bedroom curtains. . .

143
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,795
But to be honest, I'm lying.

144
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,550
I liked my birthday a little, a lot,

145
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,718
passionately,

146
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,886
wildly, not at all.

147
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,722
It's so fusty.

148
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,932
So sugar sweet.

149
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,351
It smells of cheap violet.

150
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,270
At the time of reading,

151
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,315
it's your birthday. So, happy birthday.

152
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,775
Mom says ladies don't tell their age.

153
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:15,405
But believe me, you're
at the silliest age of your life.

154
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,824
So I wrote this to help you remember

155
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:21,077
the promises I made today at the age of reason.

156
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,497
We, Mathieu and Marguerite Flore,
do solemnly swear...

157
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,458
To save the elephants.

158
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,251
To never eat oysters!

159
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,837
To hold our breath till 1 1 7.

160
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,966
To make a popcorn tart to see
if it jumps in the oven.

161
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,926
No, above all,

162
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,094
above all,

163
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,056
to set things straight.

164
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,602
Right, let's start with what matters most.

165
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,938
What have you become?

166
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,608
What do I want to be?

167
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,151
Here's my list of jobs that you can do.

168
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,987
a) Whale vet.

169
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,282
b) Saint.

170
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,994
c) Martian explorer.

171
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,293
d) Wedding-cake maker.

172
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,590
e) Princess.

173
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,513
f) Other.

174
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:33,274
Come on, let's go!

175
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,862
I need 3.5%.

176
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,446
4%

177
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,781
The dress!

178
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:40,865
3.5!

179
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,499
Here, take this.

180
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,839
Black, low-cut.

181
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,216
Size 36, body-hugging.

182
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,427
Might make up for your bungling.

183
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,011
I meant the parcel.

184
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,556
It's a parcel. Don't sidetrack.

185
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,350
I announce 3.5%  to throw the competition.

186
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,144
At election time, the presidential candidates

187
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:13,314
do it 3 to 4 times a day.

188
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,315
What? Lie?

189
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,358
Change in cars.

190
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,027
They lie too.

191
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,738
3.80%

192
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,450
any lower, the board won't back you.

193
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,910
Group reliability is at stake.

194
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,623
What's reliable is what I get if I fail: the boot.

195
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,167
You've done worse.

196
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:35,628
Never. Chance has no place in my life.

197
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,008
And this. . . Is that chance?

198
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,386
Should I pursue?

199
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,889
I never mix work and play.

200
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,518
Now's not the time.

201
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,413
Keep it, I'll open it after the deal.

202
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,254
3%

203
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,256
4%

204
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,466
3.50%

205
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:22,759
4%

206
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,302
Three and a half.

207
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:25,929
4%

208
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,430
3!

209
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,398
What're you doing?

210
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,527
Come back!

211
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:41,694
Merignac!

212
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,696
We'll be late, dammit!

213
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,327
Marguerite? What are you doing here?

214
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,663
Margaret! Get off. Let's talk.

215
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,957
- Come!
- No, I can't.

216
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:59,629
There's only one bus a day for Saou,
I can't miss my bowling.

217
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:00,922
I'll pay a taxi.

218
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,423
No, no thanks.

219
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,426
I wouldn't upset your schedule, Marguerite.

220
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,095
No, my name is Margaret. . .

221
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,348
Margaret Flore!

222
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,851
We have to talk, Merignac!

223
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,981
Old fart! Bloody old...

224
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,024
Bloody old fart!

225
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,244
They're here.

226
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,583
What came over you? Is it that parcel?

227
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,211
Malcolm, this is the clincher.

228
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,881
You're crazy!

229
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,597
I know.

230
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,601
I know that too.

231
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,192
Sorry...

232
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:05,778
Sorry.

233
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,823
Sorry!

234
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:15,663
Sorry.

235
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,890
I guess that means I've become

236
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,392
e) a princess.

237
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,736
Some of the children I'd like to have...

238
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,363
Will you be their mother?

239
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,822
Yes!

240
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,077
It's the nicest gift I've ever had.

241
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,273
Setting. . .

242
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,860
things...

243
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,906
straight.

244
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,119
So, whale vet?

245
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:36,869
No.

246
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,496
Saint?

247
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,831
Maybe. . .

248
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,625
But to be eaten by lions, no.

249
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:46,504
Martian explorer, wedding-cake maker, no, no.

250
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,132
For all these jobs, read letter 2.

251
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:50,883
If not,

252
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,802
for princess,

253
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,306
read letter 3.

254
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,518
Other, read letter 4.

255
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:04,105
"Other", that's a bit vague.

256
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,983
Well then, princess.

257
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,111
Princess.

258
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,157
Liar!

259
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:17,285
Why? Because "Martian explorer" rings true?

260
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,666
Wedding-cake maker...

261
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,544
Martian explorer...

262
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,337
Congratulations!

263
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,839
Oh, yeah?

264
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,427
Well, I've become an other, and I'm delighted.

265
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,803
So, "other". . .

266
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,513
letter number 4.

267
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,351
Get this straight,

268
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,771
I'll never call my son Walter.

269
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:49,358
Then, he'll be my son.

270
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,087
Setting things straight.

271
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:10,797
Be seated.

272
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,107
Shit!

273
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,079
Coco Chanel.

274
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,416
- We're pushing it.
- Don't you start too.

275
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,402
This arrived for you.

276
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,666
Be right back.

277
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,331
I guess you haven't become
what I wanted and I'm sad.

278
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,707
Yet I expected that.

279
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,335
You're at the silliest age of your life,

280
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,920
but I can help you.

281
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:18,090
Yesterday, the furniture left, today, it was Dad.

282
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,135
He hid the car from the bailiffs.

283
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,012
He sold it this morning,

284
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,014
left us the money, and went.

285
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,807
Dad's leaving.

286
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:31,062
He feels his professional and matrimonial failure

287
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,523
is his fault and suggests...

288
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,692
What's "matrimoanial"?

289
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,654
Mom didn't even try to lie.

290
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,698
She could've said Dad had become a spy

291
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,326
in a spatiotemporal organisation

292
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:49,580
and that he'd to go back in time to save Atlantis.

293
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,001
In fact, Dad is gone to Sumatra

294
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,586
to get an orang-utan for your birthday.

295
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,506
I'll call him Geronimo.

296
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,341
"Geronimo".

297
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,892
Philibert...

298
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,778
You've become an other
and didn't even open letter .

299
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,321
Well?

300
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,656
Well what?

301
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,575
Dad forgot you, not I.

302
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,245
I couldn't, though I tried my best.

303
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,998
I'd almost succeeded before you showed up.

304
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,084
- And Philibert?
- Philibert?

305
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:39,046
He matters as much to me as the Saou annual fete.

306
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,298
I've forgotten Philibert.

307
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:45,428
And even if I hadn't, he's long forgotten me.

308
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,139
That's how life is.

309
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,348
Maybe not?

310
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,476
What do we decide?

311
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,604
I decide. You, are a crazy kid.

312
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,565
I, am a responsible adult.

313
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,734
So you're going back to oblivion.

314
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,287
Goddam!

315
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,415
Goddam it!

316
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,962
A bit short, young man.

317
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,843
Isn't that your phone?

318
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,262
Could well be.

319
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,520
Mr Merignac? Margaret Flore.

320
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:22,149
My little Marguerite, this very morning I was...

321
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,734
Don't bother.

322
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,487
I have one minute to tell you three things:

323
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,364
1 ) My name is Margaret Flore,

324
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,324
neither little nor yours.

325
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,160
So drop the country
granddad routine and use "Miss"

326
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,247
old fashioned, but de rigueur.

327
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:41,377
2) I order you to stop pestering me
with those kid's letters

328
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,088
whose legal bind has now expired.

329
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,923
3) Goodbye!

330
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,884
Marguerite Flore was born in Saou.

331
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,637
On her sixth birthday she got a pink bike

332
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,682
that she covered in dragonfly stickers.

333
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,936
Then she moved, grew up,
and called herself Margaret"

334
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,564
to seem less provincial.

335
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,567
So I'll stop playing the country granddad

336
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,445
and you, yourself,

337
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,739
stop playing the stuck-up careerist.

338
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,451
Still there?

339
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,745
Let's take that again.

340
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:21,250
I was born in Lille. At age 3, I left for Sumatra

341
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,170
where my father was a diplomat.

342
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,548
For my sixth birthday I got a pet orang-utan

343
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:32,094
called Geronimo who lived on giant spiders.

344
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,429
Like my CV? Still there?

345
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,433
Yes, the minute is up.

346
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,102
I know your time is precious.

347
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,481
Maybe in a month you'll find another minute.

348
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,107
Goodbye.

349
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,112
Surname: Bakary...

350
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,073
First name: Philibert. . .

351
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,867
Send.

352
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,203
I'll prove to you he's forgotten me.

353
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,297
Hello, is that Philibert Bakary?

354
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,298
Yes.

355
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,552
It's for you!

356
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,305
Yes, that's me.

357
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,140
Philibert speaking...

358
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,402
Philibert!

359
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,699
Am I disturbing?

360
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,628
This deal is crucial to our branch.

361
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,755
Your job is to win it.

362
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,757
Hence your faith in me.

363
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,509
I have no faith in you.

364
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:57,221
Nor any leniency for you as a woman.

365
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,183
Business doesn't care about your sex.

366
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,851
Our sex.

367
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,854
And I'll let no feelings of feminine solidarity

368
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:08,315
stand in my way.

369
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,860
You respect me, don't you?

370
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,696
I admire you.

371
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,614
In that case,

372
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,242
let's be frank and settle this.

373
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,371
To me, you are just a rival,

374
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,040
but with talent enough to scare.

375
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,088
What's that?

376
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:33,799
A coupon.

377
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,385
May I tell you a story?

378
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:40,097
Mom used to always tell us to finish our bread

379
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,433
for the starving children.

380
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,102
I didn't see how eating bread

381
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,771
could feed kids in far-off lands.

382
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:51,358
I had a childhood friend, Philibert.

383
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,486
He dreamt of being a "hole digger".

384
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,614
Hope he succeeded.

385
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,992
"Hole digger". Where does success come in?

386
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,368
I'm getting there.

387
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,998
Philibert dug a hole in a dry well we found.

388
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,586
Look what the baker gave us!

389
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,259
There you are.

390
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,136
Where would I be? America!

391
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,014
But that hole is tiny.

392
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:27,353
It's bigger than you. Not happy, you dig.

393
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,271
No, I'm a girl.

394
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,940
- Then, help me.
- No, I'm a girl.

395
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,817
Who won't get dirty.

396
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,569
No, because I'm a girl.

397
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,488
Quiet.

398
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,492
Let's see if it works.

399
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:18,237
It's from the best bakery in the region!

400
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:22,491
We'll send some every day! And tomorrow, sweets!

401
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:36,755
The worms must've eaten kilos of bread

402
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,257
that year.

403
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,551
Is there a message in all this?

404
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,512
None.

405
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,266
Don't worry about your job,

406
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:50,185
I'm aiming much higher, so for safety

407
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,355
remember to duck, you're in the firing line.

408
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,524
A present.

409
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,286
- You said that to de Lorca?
- Yes.

410
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,249
Malcolm, use your calm.

411
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,293
For once I need it, help me.

412
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,099
- Tell me of your childhood.
- Why?

413
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,185
I want to know. Do we change?

414
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,480
Are you still the boy you were? What's growing up?

415
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,191
Growing up is moving on.

416
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,651
- Moving on?
- Yes.

417
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,616
So moving on is a variable.

418
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,619
Usually, at age 7, girls get a doll.

419
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,330
I got a visit from the repo men.

420
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,541
They emptied the house on my seventh birthday.

421
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:59,213
So I hid a pile of plates, now of no use to anyone,

422
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,923
as I'd always fancied smashing plates,

423
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,967
and now I could, just for kicks.

424
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,260
What's all this?

425
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:08,096
Smashing plates?

426
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,308
One day we talk of kids

427
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:15,020
- and the next, it's a holy row?
- Don't mix everything.

428
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:20,317
Those plates stayed in my room, untouched,

429
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,361
night after night, till I forgot them,
like all the rest.

430
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:26,490
Because I did my all to forget, to move on.

431
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,830
My childhood dream was me now.

432
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,540
And no one,

433
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,459
not even you, will sway me.

434
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,926
I never became a racing driver.

435
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,179
So, sometimes

436
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,265
I console myself, thinking

437
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:37,644
that my job is like a high speed race.

438
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:38,979
I slalom between the obstacles

439
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,939
and accelerate to cross the line

440
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,983
ahead of the competition.

441
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,653
It's the same.

442
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,823
Almost the same.

443
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,547
Dear me,

444
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:09,551
we've no money, but Mom pretends we have.

445
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,930
It's funny how adults lie for stupid stuff...

446
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,557
Money doesn't bring richness.

447
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,561
People are blind to true wealth.

448
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,231
And don't lie for important stuff.

449
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:27,945
To turn on a tap and drink, that's true wealth.

450
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,281
But Mom forgot to pay the bills.

451
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,537
Maybe money is useful after all.

452
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,130
Not much.

453
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,465
- 200?
- 1 00.

454
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,718
So Mom sold our very last belonging:

455
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,261
my clarinet.

456
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,890
I understood even dreams have a price.

457
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,606
Sorry, sorry...

458
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,035
Ava Gardner.

459
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,578
Ava. . .Gardner.

460
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,957
For Aleyrac, turn right

461
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,835
then take direction: Condillac.

462
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,964
Nothing has changed here.

463
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,552
Condillac, Barsac

464
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,053
Aleyrac...

465
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,639
Get off my back!

466
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,559
Destination not found.

467
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:44,062
Ava Gardner.

468
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,672
"NOTARY"

469
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,051
Barsac, Condillac, Aleyrac, off my back. . .

470
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,553
Merignac?

471
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:17,637
Not here.

472
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,431
So I see. Where is he?

473
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:22,684
- Given the hour, he must be. . .
- Okay

474
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,584
Here's the deal: 5,000 and you keep the lot.

475
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:49,961
Quiet!

476
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,714
5,000 what?

477
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,179
5,000 Euros.

478
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,932
Why? Still use Roman money here?

479
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,061
5,000 Euros. . . How many measures is that?

480
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,397
- Of what?
- Pastis.

481
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,900
Listen, I know we don't have the same values...

482
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,694
Yes, you know a lot Marguerite. . .

483
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,655
- Margaret.
- Whatever...

484
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,323
Only, you're wrong.

485
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:22,744
Without the same values
you'd not have found me here

486
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,413
in the best crayfish spot in the region.

487
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:30,377
You feel no emotion,
returning after all these ears?

488
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,839
- Yes. I feel I'm wasting my time.
- Sure. . .

489
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,591
And time, is money...

490
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,260
You got it.

491
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,721
Keep that up, we'll save time translating.

492
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,768
Shop talk... "Savings", "time"...

493
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,645
Next you'll be spouting "profit", "optimisation"

494
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:49,938
and "planning".

495
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,690
You're doing it on purpose!

496
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:56,111
I battle every second to live the life I chose

497
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,656
and I won't let some fusty old letters stop me!

498
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:00,740
Those wicked letters!

499
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:04,703
Spare me your cynicism, I have copyright. . .

500
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:05,453
Careful!

501
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,788
Don't move!

502
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,833
Look at the size of it!

503
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,293
I hate this place.

504
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:15,130
I hate that rug, I hate your shorts,

505
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,965
this old-world charm.

506
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,427
I hate being cold, and even this tea.

507
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,636
Sugar?

508
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:22,971
Saccharine.

509
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,306
Honey?

510
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,559
- Why not maple syrup!
- Honey. . .

511
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:32,105
I don't want to remember my childhood. . .

512
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,482
But that's why you wrote them.

513
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:38,153
- That doesn't mean I was right.
- True.

514
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,990
As a kid you always thought you were.

515
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:47,329
From the present we judge
the past and mistrust the future.

516
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:50,373
Is that pop philosophy, or barfly wisdom?

517
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,878
It was in October.

518
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,257
I was a young notary who'd just opened.

519
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,719
You asked me to keep your mail

520
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,013
and send it to you in 201 0,

521
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,350
in exchange for your savings.

522
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,687
1 2 Francs and 57 Centimes.

523
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:16,024
That makes about 1 euro 91 cents.

524
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,734
Your fees were reasonable.

525
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,195
It seemed so important to you

526
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,697
that over time

527
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,407
it became so for me.

528
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,534
It was amazing.

529
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:30,247
At the age of 7,
you'd done the work of a lifetime.

530
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:34,376
Notary Merignac. . .

531
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:39,214
Marguerite Flore...

532
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,842
So I waited all these years

533
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,553
to know what'd become of you, which is why...

534
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,889
I came to see you.

535
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,308
It's legal, no loopholes.

536
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:55,939
Good. So you can find the treasure
you and Philibert hid.

537
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,899
Nuance, "a" treasure.

538
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,317
It was a game.

539
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,403
It's probably just a bag of marbles.

540
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,321
You take things so literally.

541
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,908
You sign dumb contracts with kids who bury...

542
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,495
How'd you know about the treasure?

543
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,205
From next week's letter.

544
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,332
- What? You opened my. . .
- Yes.

545
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,251
- Only natural...
- It's my mail!

546
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,962
No, it was well done.

547
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,048
I steamed it open and glued it back.

548
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,592
Only I told you, you'd never know.

549
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,177
That's just not done.

550
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:29,264
People do things daily that aren't done.

551
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,182
- Not me.
- Really?

552
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,811
Like binning a half-drunk coffee

553
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,105
in a non-biodegradable cup?

554
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,774
I get it. You're a utopian.

555
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,735
Who doesn't bury treasure.

556
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,195
- It was a game.
- A treasure.

557
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,322
- A game.
- No, a treasure.

558
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,908
- A game.
- A treasure.

559
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,119
Here, your letter.

560
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,288
It's my favourite.

561
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,584
I've read it so often I no longer re-glue it.

562
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,296
There are grains of rice inside.

563
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,678
Today, Philibert and I

564
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,472
got married.

565
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,652
I promise to marry you.

566
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,945
Sure...

567
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:29,157
What's wrong? First I kidnap you,
then I marry you.

568
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,369
- Easy, no?
- Cliche you mean.

569
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,828
In 20 years of promises

570
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,289
you'll not have kidnapped even one girl.

571
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,166
But at least she'll believe me!

572
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:47,175
Promise me you'll become a "hole digger".

573
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,010
And?

574
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,888
And I'll always love you.

575
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,766
Always is a long time, especially for a girl.

576
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,393
Oh yeah? Then kiss me.

577
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,146
Easy.

578
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,535
Okay...

579
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,557
And now?

580
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:37,934
I've already forgotten you.

581
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,231
Then I'll be a "hole digger"
so you'll never forget me!

582
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,029
Pass me down your treasure.

583
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,082
It can't be still there.

584
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,297
Well, you could dig and find out.

585
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,717
Nothing to lose.

586
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,345
I have. . . My dignity.

587
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,977
There's a shovel here.

588
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,105
Margaret, there's a shovel!

589
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,775
Then dig! To me the past is dirty.

590
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,611
A dress didn't make me a princess.

591
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,614
Throwing bread in a hole didn't feed Africa.

592
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:33,865
A kid's game!

593
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,409
As for your treasure, keep it!

594
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:39,746
The mysteries of my childhood laid bare.

595
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,290
- Thank you, Dr Freud.
- Here...

596
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,169
Won't find that where you are.

597
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,046
It's why I live there.

598
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,008
Picasso said something I really like.

599
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:55,553
He said: "Become who you are."

600
00:41:57,139 --> 00:42:00,683
You're now an art collector
as well as a notary and a shrink?

601
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,019
I bet you tap dance too.

602
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,230
Become who you are.

603
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,774
Why do you say that?

604
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,527
Because it's not as lame as the usual:

605
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:13,821
"Drive safely and call me when you arrive."

606
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,826
Drive safely and call me when you arrive.

607
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:31,047
Well, so much for Ava Gardner!

608
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,615
Here's a list of the important things in life:

609
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,201
First, bury a treasure.

610
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,288
That's done, so let's move on.

611
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,081
Jumping in puddles.

612
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,750
Banging in nails straight.

613
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,921
Making the best paper planes.

614
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,007
Repainting Mona Lisa.

615
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:17,844
- Wonderful!
- A masterpiece!

616
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,888
Cooking all-chocolate dinners.

617
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,601
Running up down-escalators.

618
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,853
Kissing princes.

619
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,534
Not here!

620
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,799
Joan of Arc...

621
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,593
Yeah, a bit wacky.

622
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,511
She heard voices. . .

623
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,513
Just like me!

624
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,870
Still no mail?

625
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,633
Dear me,

626
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,347
I hope you've not forgotten our meeting with
the world's greatest hole-digger.

627
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,809
It's tomorrow.

628
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,061
PS:

629
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,729
Dear me,

630
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,564
it's very important.

631
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:57,694
Dear Philibert, meet at 9 at Angel Cave.

632
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:02,824
PS: Dear Philibert, you have to be there.

633
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,121
Another PS:

634
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,247
Dear me,

635
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,083
if you ever keep but one promise

636
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,335
it's this one.

637
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:19,549
Now listen to my instructions on the tape.

638
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,343
Arnaud, find me a cassette player.

639
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,762
An MP3 player might be more...

640
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:29,976
No, a cassette player. Remember these?

641
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,689
- But the audio quality is. . .
- Arnaud!

642
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,238
Hello, Marguerite.

643
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,198
Remember our song?

644
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,248
Anything else, Margaret?

645
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:54,667
Yes,

646
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,754
try to call me Marguerite now and again.

647
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,091
Thank you.

648
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,137
Find the outfit to suit the music.

649
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,682
You'll be a knockout.

650
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,568
And if you have a boyfriend,

651
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:21,986
he can come.

652
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,404
Come where?

653
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:24,906
Down south.

654
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:33,122
May I remind you we're dining with
the board of PARM

655
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,416
tonight.

656
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:40,296
I really need you. Can't we cancel?

657
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:41,255
No.

658
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:42,423
Malcolm...

659
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:45,760
I love you, I love our life.

660
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,472
But can't we change it a little?

661
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,517
Like, when did we last make love?

662
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:55,102
Wednesday. Even noted in my diary.

663
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:56,521
And where?

664
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,940
- At the Hyatt.
- At the airport.

665
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,900
Room 1 03.

666
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,820
Me off to Prague, you back from London.

667
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,990
When's our next free weekend

668
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,035
without work and business dinners?

669
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:11,911
December.

670
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,623
But baby hasn't happened.

671
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,626
We don't have a weekend off before December!

672
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,628
We give our all to our jobs.

673
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,755
Can't we have one evening not pre-planned

674
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:26,092
2 months ahead on our Blackberries?

675
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:33,266
Even if it were a romantic trip to the Seychelles,

676
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,977
if de Lorca called urgently,

677
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,772
I'd cancel and go to the office.

678
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,485
So. . .

679
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:49,866
Either you slip into something
that shows your curves or. . .

680
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,910
- Go as Supergirl.
- You are a Supergirl.

681
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,996
No need for the outfit.

682
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,257
Cheers!

683
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,811
Say, is that a diamond?

684
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,521
It's charming.

685
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:21,814
Charming indeed,

686
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:25,902
like the diamond wars that
wreak nothing but death, famine,

687
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,614
and prostitution.

688
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,408
You're right, it's charming.

689
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,118
We did our best, Madam.

690
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,162
A dream come true.

691
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,122
An all-chocolate dinner.

692
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,128
Excuse me.

693
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,258
Got an early meeting tomorrow.

694
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:03,064
As it's a long trip, I prepared some music.

695
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,403
Well, just for your birthday.

696
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,742
Spelt properly.

697
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:31,008
So the guy says to the old man: "Sir,"

698
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,802
"you have a banana in your ear."

699
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,595
"Sorry?" he replies.

700
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:37,306
So the guy repeats: "Sir,"

701
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,183
"you have a banana in your ear!"

702
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,268
Annoyed, the old man says:

703
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:46,565
"Speak up young man, can't you see
I've a banana in my ear!"

704
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,538
Happy birthday, Marguerite!

705
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,956
Amazing, no?

706
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,049
What am I doing here?

707
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,594
Let it play, it's so beautiful.

708
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:40,930
Meryl Streep.

709
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,474
Mozart.

710
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:44,767
Meryl Streep.

711
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,393
No, Mozart.

712
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,145
Meryl Streep.

713
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:49,271
Mozart.

714
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,732
Clarinet concerto, K622.

715
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,068
Like it?

716
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,654
Decidedly quaint,

717
00:51:57,405 --> 00:52:00,407
a touch arrogant, yet quite daring.

718
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,661
The music? The art?

719
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,371
Your pick up routine.

720
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,081
Inspired by you.

721
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,091
You can breathe out now.

722
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,599
I played that as a kid

723
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:27,101
on the clarinet.

724
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,937
Only Mom sold it as we'd no money.

725
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,481
So I began writing letters,

726
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,526
and can no longer play the clarinet, but so what?

727
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,112
Let's take it from the top.

728
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,364
It's the first time in ages

729
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:43,826
I haven't talked efficiency, sales, contacts...

730
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:45,661
That bothers you?

731
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,372
Don't want to sit?

732
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,251
- It's just earth.
- Sure, just earth.

733
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:53,794
We did worse, come on.

734
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,672
Sit.

735
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,967
Now speak to me, talk.

736
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:02,636
About what?

737
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:03,679
Anything.

738
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:05,764
The bison there. . .

739
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:08,559
It's more like an aurochs.

740
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,686
Or a kangaroo, if you prefer.

741
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:13,814
It's a vanished animal, talking to us.

742
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:16,400
This cave is a language.

743
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,278
Its creatures are the letters of
a primitive alphabet.

744
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:22,364
And the artist wrote with simple words.

745
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,034
Words you understand?

746
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:26,410
Sure.

747
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,829
He wrote: "Don't forget me."

748
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:31,916
Count to 1 00.

749
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,293
Sorry?

750
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:38,756
Help me. I've this mad urge to kiss you

751
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:42,509
and if it's but a passing whim
it'll be gone by 1 00, no?

752
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,721
And if not, what do we do?

753
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:50,434
That's enough!

754
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,854
Anyway, they're gone.

755
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,276
The hamsters, they're gone.

756
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,362
Thank you, Philibert.

757
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:03,113
I'm so very happy.

758
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:05,032
You're here, I'm here

759
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,243
and the hamsters are gone.

760
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,249
Marguerite!

761
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,085
Excuse me.

762
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,546
Where do the hamsters come in?

763
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,340
That's it, they don't.

764
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:26,303
I always thought meeting you again
I'd get hamsters in my tummy.

765
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:29,765
But no, meaning I can face my past anxiety-free.

766
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,227
We set up this meeting years ago.

767
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,187
I even got a reminder parcel:

768
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:38,774
"Meet me at Angel Cave, it's importan. . ."

769
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:41,110
"Important" ends in "t".

770
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,530
Not even a thank you, unsigned. . .

771
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:45,906
It had to be you.

772
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,741
That was when we were kids.

773
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,077
Seriously, Philibert

774
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:52,663
you thought we'd start over?

775
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,707
I bet it crossed your mind too.

776
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,093
And now,

777
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,012
you feel the hamsters?

778
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,305
No.

779
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,683
The truth is, they're gone.

780
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:14,268
Or almost.

781
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,978
To be honest,

782
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:20,107
I only feel the hamsters rarely,

783
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:24,945
like when the eyes of rich investors wonder

784
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,615
if it's a Wonderbra or for real. . .

785
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,451
while I worm a few more million out of them.

786
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:33,537
So, is it a Wonderbra, or for real?

787
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:34,955
Philibert,

788
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,585
I don't think you can afford a creature like me.

789
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:49,136
If you no longer fear
the past just tell me goodbye.

790
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,891
It's a Wonderbra.

791
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,079
The meeting's started, are you far away?

792
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:22,836
Yes, I'm on my way.

793
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,963
Malcolm, darling, it's me.

794
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,673
You're always on voicemail.

795
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,176
Sorry for yesterday.

796
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,512
I've one more thing to settle

797
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,806
and then I'm home, for good.

798
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:38,769
Tell Ms de Lorca I worked till late.

799
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,437
We'll start afresh,

800
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:43,774
like we just met, and set it all straight.

801
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:49,071
As if I'd just fall into his arms!
A childhood crush.

802
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:52,157
And if he's not a "hole-digger" then what is he?

803
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:55,702
A bus driver with his two-bit chatter.

804
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,375
I hope you're having a lovely day.

805
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,919
For me, it was the worst day of my life.

806
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:05,462
We were moving.

807
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,506
Mom told me to be ready by midday,

808
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,633
but at noon I was still waiting.

809
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:10,717
Philibert?

810
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,011
Mom's looking all over for you.

811
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,555
Are you coming?

812
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:16,723
I wasn't able to say goodbye.

813
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,272
Marguerite!

814
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,953
Marguerite, it's time to go.

815
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,256
But he never came.

816
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:03,145
Mom, it's him!

817
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:06,273
We waited as long as we could.

818
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,030
He's behind us!

819
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,698
Stop!

820
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,588
Get in. Let's go, Sir.

821
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:36,637
See? You can't count on others.

822
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:41,725
What matters most is never to
forget those you love.

823
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,036
Rosa gallica...

824
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:04,331
the ancestor of all today's roses.

825
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:07,334
What's extraordinary about plants

826
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:10,170
is that they'll grow on any terrain,

827
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,089
in any climate...

828
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,341
But a rose bush

829
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:17,135
will always be a rose bush,

830
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:20,639
an oak tree will always be an oak,

831
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,683
and a Marguerite

832
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:26,019
will always be a daisy.

833
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,107
Hello Marguerite, everything okay?

834
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,608
Hello, Sir.

835
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,652
Sir?

836
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:37,698
I'm now retired, my name's Fernand.

837
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,491
I didn't know.

838
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,451
That I had a first name?

839
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:42,953
Well I do.

840
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:45,497
Even old notaries have first names.

841
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,541
Mine was barely used,

842
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,544
it's brand new.

843
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,172
You found Philibert?

844
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,341
No,

845
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:58,302
you did.

846
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,722
It was in our contract.

847
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,391
It was easy, his mom still lives here

848
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:07,019
and I run into him occasionally.

849
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:10,230
I can't let a kid of 7 run my life.

850
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,899
I must set things straight.

851
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,277
That's it,

852
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:18,905
set things straight and bother you no more.

853
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:23,702
We moved in with a friend of Mom's.

854
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,830
She found Mom a job at the shoe factory.

855
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:28,206
It's so pretty here,

856
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,500
the future looks bright.

857
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,273
You must be Simon?

858
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,485
Is your dad in?

859
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:59,488
Dad, there's a lady to see you.

860
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:01,615
Lucrezia Borgia, no. . .

861
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,158
Denise Fabre. . .

862
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,410
No, no good. Margaret Thatcher.

863
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:06,953
Yes?

864
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:18,090
- Hello, Marguerite.
- Hi, Mathieu.

865
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,348
What a surprise!

866
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,058
You should've called.

867
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:31,978
I was in the vicinity. How are you?

868
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,648
That's Simon?

869
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:37,234
Your nephew, nearly five.

870
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:38,985
- And you?
- No

871
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,822
I mean, still no kids.

872
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:43,949
But soon.

873
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:45,867
Come on in, have a drink.

874
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,911
No, I won't bother you.

875
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,580
Once every 1 5 years isn't really a bother.

876
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,377
I was down on business, and. . .

877
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,671
You've more urgent things to do.

878
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:01,842
No, I just wanted to say

879
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:04,594
we should start afresh.

880
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:06,471
Just because we're brother and sister

881
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,516
doesn't mean we have to go overboard.

882
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,853
What I mean is...

883
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:16,690
I know you don't want to invite me to your home,

884
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,191
I understand that. . .

885
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:20,694
You know it all, big sister.

886
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:26,074
Well, be seeing you.

887
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:38,670
Mathieu.

888
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,631
Do you remember. . .

889
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,341
Do you remember

890
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,511
those letters I wrote

891
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:48,847
when I was about seven?

892
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,560
You came to talk about you.

893
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:57,481
Not a word from my dear sister for years,

894
01:02:57,648 --> 01:03:00,734
my son doesn't even know
his aunt and you breeze in

895
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:04,196
between meetings just so I'd talk about you.

896
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:07,365
You ask if I remember? Well, no.

897
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:10,911
I've forgotten you, I don't want to remember.

898
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:14,206
The advantage of the past is it's past.

899
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:29,554
Simon,

900
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:33,892
I'm. . .

901
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:38,104
Did your dad ever mention your aunt Marguerite?

902
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:43,944
Look. . .

903
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,453
She asked me to give it to you.

904
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:56,832
It's nice.

905
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,795
You can take it home, okay?

906
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:06,967
Thanks, lady.

907
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:24,985
I had a lousy day. But I understood two things.

908
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:29,114
First, we'll try 3.8% .

909
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,116
And second?

910
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:35,078
We have that baby?

911
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,543
You book a room at the Hyatt?

912
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:47,257
With hamsters or not?

913
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,801
With.

914
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:58,727
Mother Teresa?

915
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:03,398
To deal a nuclear power plant?

916
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,164
Ms de Lorca.

917
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:22,083
I read your report. 3.8% ?

918
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,961
Yet you told them 3.5?

919
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:27,672
Yes, but I said that maybe. . .

920
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,800
Whatever, we on the board will decide.

921
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:32,969
We?

922
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,387
Well, I.

923
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,599
Of course, you weren't here yesterday.

924
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:41,728
In your absence I was appointed to the board.

925
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,564
To that seat above me you were targeting.

926
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:49,444
So, no need for me to duck, I'm out of range.

927
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:53,531
I accept your congrats.

928
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,837
There's a man who wants to see you.

929
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:08,797
No time.

930
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:11,841
A Mr Philibert Bakary, he's quite determined.

931
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:13,343
Don't you understand!

932
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,595
- I must see her...
- Sir, please leave!

933
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:17,597
You heard me!

934
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:21,476
Hold on. . . I'll take care of this.

935
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:24,229
- He says it's yours.
- Mine? Never.

936
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,480
You? Here?

937
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:28,942
And you? Locked in like a killer on death row?

938
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,318
I'm meant to laugh?

939
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:33,363
And how are you? Great to see you.

940
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,740
What? I should feel guilty?

941
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,742
You want airs and graces?

942
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:40,954
Well beat it, Philibert. I despise you.

943
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:43,498
Careful, that's a feeling.

944
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:45,125
You have feelings?

945
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:47,335
Philibert, you're a past.

946
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:49,045
What a slip of the tongue!

947
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:51,506
Well, if I'm a past it means you have several.

948
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:54,175
Provincial! Must I spell it?

949
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,721
Hugely quaint.

950
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:01,725
Jurassically nice.

951
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,852
Ordinarily ordinary.

952
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,354
See? No change. Except for one thing.

953
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:07,313
What?

954
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:08,732
Stupidly free!

955
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:11,526
I guess that too is past?

956
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:13,820
No, that's mine.

957
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,406
Come back here.

958
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:18,158
Come back here!

959
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:27,333
Looking for me?

960
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:29,919
Or this?

961
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:34,841
How did you get this?

962
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,553
Merignac. He had a stroke.

963
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,389
Damn! How is he?

964
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:43,683
He's on life support.

965
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:46,686
At the hospital, he begged me to give you this

966
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:49,189
and to say it's the last.

967
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:55,236
I'm totally lost.

968
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:08,750
Philibert

969
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:10,126
Yes?

970
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:14,506
Tell me you've become a "hole digger".

971
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,677
Yeah, I've become a "hole digger".

972
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,246
Marguerite,

973
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:48,873
or Margaret if you prefer.

974
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,000
I asked Philibert

975
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:53,169
to bring you this letter.

976
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:56,172
Be nice with him.

977
01:08:57,424 --> 01:09:00,218
He drove all night.

978
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:03,763
I read it, of course.

979
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:08,935
Whatever you read

980
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:11,980
and whatever you decide,

981
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:17,193
know that. . . I'm proud of you.

982
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:19,571
Your life is a success.

983
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:23,158
You've become who you are.

984
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:46,014
Excuse me, you're expected in room 5.

985
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:50,852
Dear me,

986
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:54,898
I've watched Mom since we moved.

987
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:57,066
She comes home late,

988
01:09:57,484 --> 01:09:59,319
sad, tired,

989
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:02,071
and yet she still reads us stories.

990
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:05,450
I want no more pretty tales.

991
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:08,745
- Still hungry?
- Yes!

992
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:11,581
Now, what I dream of most

993
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:12,999
is to grow up.

994
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:15,335
Yet I no longer believe in dreams,

995
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:18,296
but in ambition, in money.

996
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:21,132
I want to wear suits, to be the best

997
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,594
to be admired, respected, feared.

998
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:27,722
I want to forget all the lies, the betrayals.

999
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:30,892
Now I want to lie and believe in my lies.

1000
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,853
I've decided to grow up.

1001
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:36,022
Don't leave me, Marguerite.

1002
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:38,441
I need you.

1003
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:46,991
Marguerite...

1004
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,037
it's time to go.

1005
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:58,086
Right.

1006
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:17,689
Laura!

1007
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:20,149
May I call you Laura?

1008
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:23,903
Because inside Ms de Lorca
there's also a Laura, no?

1009
01:11:24,071 --> 01:11:27,407
- They're waiting, Margaret.
- No, my name is Marguerite.

1010
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:30,368
My mom obviously liked flowers.

1011
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:33,579
But I felt Margaret was less twee for customers,

1012
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,957
our customers.

1013
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,168
Something to tell me? You have one minute.

1014
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:42,797
No, on the contrary.

1015
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:45,091
I've found my way.

1016
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,968
And that door isn't it.

1017
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:50,513
That was not my childhood dream, nor yours.

1018
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:52,724
When I was little

1019
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:56,477
my clarinet was enough to make me happy.

1020
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:58,146
So who went astray?

1021
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,856
You did.

1022
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,111
Forgive me.

1023
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:07,572
Sure, we're all under pressure.

1024
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,115
The meeting. . .

1025
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:11,284
I ask forgiveness

1026
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:13,661
of you all,

1027
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:16,372
for fooling you for so long.

1028
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:19,000
And of my little brother,

1029
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,461
my mom and my dad.

1030
01:12:23,964 --> 01:12:25,840
- We need you.
- No.

1031
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:29,469
I'm not Greta Garbo,

1032
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:32,221
nor Marie Curie, nor Coco Chanel.

1033
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:34,474
I'm not you, Laura.

1034
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:36,142
You'll go in there

1035
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:37,935
with your wolfish smile,

1036
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:40,229
your pretty wolfish smile.

1037
01:12:40,397 --> 01:12:42,065
And you'll stun them with your spreadsheet.

1038
01:12:42,232 --> 01:12:46,235
Promise me not to go below 4%.

1039
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:49,280
And as the board says bravo
you'll feel the amsters,

1040
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:52,325
right there.

1041
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:13,471
Anyone anything to add?

1042
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:14,889
No.

1043
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:16,432
Then let's go.

1044
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:21,604
- What are you taking?
- One thing.

1045
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:23,356
Letter number 4,

1046
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:25,775
to be opened if I've become an other.

1047
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:38,704
No need to get up.

1048
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,416
Under control? How do you feel?

1049
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:44,544
Like Britney Spears about to shoot up.

1050
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:49,715
Thank you.

1051
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:08,359
Look, that's her.

1052
01:14:31,758 --> 01:14:33,843
4%

1053
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:33,986
Bravo!

1054
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:47,416
You did it.

1055
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,377
Bravo.

1056
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:02,139
Thank you, Marguerite.

1057
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:51,731
My treasure!

1058
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,340
"Keep digging"

1059
01:17:41,573 --> 01:17:42,782
Dear me,

1060
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:44,784
if all has gone to plan

1061
01:17:44,951 --> 01:17:49,330
this dug-up letter will be our last.

1062
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:54,085
I lied: I said these letters were to help you.

1063
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:55,336
Truth is,

1064
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,463
only you can save me.

1065
01:17:57,964 --> 01:18:00,383
Help me be the one we were,

1066
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:01,926
to believe,

1067
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:04,220
to dream, to dare. . .

1068
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,555
Come find me.

1069
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,848
Malcolm, I'm sorry.

1070
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:51,225
I'm wrecking my life

1071
01:18:51,351 --> 01:18:53,686
but one thing I don't want to harm

1072
01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:55,146
is you.

1073
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:57,898
If one breaks things, may as well do it right.

1074
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:02,236
Remember that pile of plates I hid at age 7?

1075
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:07,366
One by one?

1076
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:11,245
A matter of taste, I'd go three by three.

1077
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:16,542
Spontaneously, I'd do one at a time.

1078
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:18,377
It's your methodical side.

1079
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:32,057
I've got time. Been waiting since I was 7.

1080
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:34,518
So... I'm savouring.

1081
01:19:34,686 --> 01:19:37,980
Well savour by looking elsewhere,

1082
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:39,774
you're putting me off.

1083
01:19:44,362 --> 01:19:48,616
Think of this as our first and last domestic row.

1084
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,743
Okay, you asked for it.

1085
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:39,333
Little brother,

1086
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:42,336
where to begin after all these years?

1087
01:20:42,754 --> 01:20:46,549
A good place might be when all was well

1088
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:49,051
before I left for boarding school

1089
01:20:49,427 --> 01:20:52,388
when I decided to become the adult I am today.

1090
01:20:53,765 --> 01:20:55,182
I missed you.

1091
01:20:55,892 --> 01:20:57,476
But the truth is,

1092
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,562
I missed me, too.

1093
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:06,944
Now I'm fighting for a cause I at last believe in.

1094
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:09,280
But Marguerite's no wheeler dealer.

1095
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:11,448
So I asked for help from an old friend,

1096
01:21:11,616 --> 01:21:15,119
a certain Margaret.

1097
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:19,957
And, best of all, great news!

1098
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:21,876
I'm going to be a mom.

1099
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:24,420
That should set a lot straight.

1100
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:30,801
To finance my project I used old contacts

1101
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:33,095
who believe that morality, like dreams

1102
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:35,014
costs money.

1103
01:21:36,516 --> 01:21:37,933
As for the logistics

1104
01:21:38,101 --> 01:21:42,396
it meant just one of us
keeping one childhood promise.

1105
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:53,407
Philibert has really become a "hole digger".

1106
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,124
As Oscar Wilde said:

1107
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:04,627
"One's dreams must be big enough"

1108
01:22:04,794 --> 01:22:07,379
"so as not to lose sight of them."

1109
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:12,509
I ran, I've run so far. . .

1110
01:22:12,677 --> 01:22:15,262
And it's not over, my dream is huge.

1111
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:18,641
Today, we finished that tunnel.

1112
01:22:24,147 --> 01:22:25,147
Simon!

1113
01:22:26,232 --> 01:22:27,524
Come quickly!

1114
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:29,151
Let's go, buddy.

1115
01:22:29,402 --> 01:22:32,613
The kids were so happy when we found water.

1116
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:34,239
Where are we going, Dad?

1117
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:37,952
You'll see. I'll show you something wonderful.

1118
01:22:39,162 --> 01:22:41,330
Some will think I'm condescending,

1119
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:44,750
but I don't claim to be better, or model,

1120
01:22:44,918 --> 01:22:47,628
I have simply become who I am.

1121
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:30,587
And I had one last thing to do.

1122
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:33,048
Open letter number 4.

1123
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:35,634
As I've become neither whale vet,

1124
01:23:35,802 --> 01:23:37,803
saint, Martian explorer,

1125
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:40,639
wedding-cake maker, nor princess. . .

1126
01:23:41,057 --> 01:23:42,808
it means I've become

1127
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:44,351
an other.

1128
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:50,399
Marguerite...

1129
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,171
(I love you)

1130
01:24:36,029 --> 01:24:37,279
The age of reason

1131
01:24:37,947 --> 01:24:39,490
is now.
