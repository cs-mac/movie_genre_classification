- Watch the ball!
- [blows whistle]

157
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:30,985
Hey. Are you in trouble?

158
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,147
- [boy] Not really.
- OK.

159
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,821
He's always such
an unhappy-looking child.

160
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,692
I see you guys
laughing over there.

161
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,208
Now, Cody.

162
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,978
[woman lecturing indistinctly]

163
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,013
[Lockwood whispering]
Cody, come here.

164
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,651
[teacher] You don't have a book?
Oh, 'cause you just snuck in?

165
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:05,118
We're on page 364.
Maggie, go ahead and read it, please.

166
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,154
[child reading out loud indistinctly]

167
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,054
[Lockwood] Mrs. Pucilek, open a window.

168
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,024
- [Pucilek] Huh?
- Open a window.

169
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,220
[Pucilek] Can I do that
without getting in trouble? OK.

170
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,524
Yes. Come here, sweetie.

171
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,669
Cody, can you tell me what's
happening at lunch table?

172
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,500
[stammers] He calls me a faggot.

173
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,538
[Lockwood] Mm-hm. He does?

174
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,512
How does that make you feel?

175
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:32,479
Uh, it... It breaks my heart.

176
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,175
It breaks your heart. I see.

177
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,048
So what do you think we should do?

178
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,159
<i>[Lockwood] Tell me how to fix this.</i>

179
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,060
Tell me how to fix this.

180
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,393
I don't know.
I don't have any magic.

181
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,035
[woman] Just, you know,
and it's a really awful feeling.

182
00:14:56,195 --> 00:15:01,042
How many people in here have,
um, at least one friend?

183
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:05,209
OK. How many people in here
have two friends?

184
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,747
How many people in here have
more than two friends?

185
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,687
Almost everybody.

186
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,549
[students chattering]

187
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:51,621
<i>[Alex] People think
that I'm different,</i>

188
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,287
<i>I'm not normal.</i>

189
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,301
<i>Most kids don't
want to be around me.</i>

190
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:09,109
<i>I feel like I...
I belong somewhere else.</i>

191
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,296
[laughter]

192
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,593
<i>[girl] You can always count on
something happening</i>

193
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,639
when you're walking down the hall
at school and in the classroom,

194
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,436
after school,
when I'm walking home, uh,

195
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,670
when I'm walking through the parking
lot in the mornings, to school.

196
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,782
- I wasn't welcomed at church.
- [girls giggling]

197
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:49,613
I'm not welcomed
in a lot of people's homes.

198
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,187
I know these guys get called "gay"
just for hanging out with me.

199
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,516
Everybody thinks I'm a lesbian.

200
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,181
[girl] Everybody thought
we were lesbians

201
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,849
- right when we started hanging out.
- I'm straight.

202
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,462
- [Kelby] And she's straight.
- I'm straight.

203
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,529
[Kelby] Like I told you,
she's K-gay.

204
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,167
I'm not straight any more.

205
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,860
We were walking back from lunch
and these guys,

206
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:11,202
there was probably like six older guys,
driving in their mom's minivan.

207
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,535
They were mostly jocks.

208
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,735
I was gonna find out
what their problem was,

209
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,245
so I kinda walked in the road,

210
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,748
and instead of slowing down
or stopping to talk to me,

211
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,546
they sped up
and I flew onto the wind-shield.

212
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,052
[girls giggle]

213
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,816
I couldn't have gotten hit by something
cool, like a Jeep or something.

214
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,584
I had to get hit by a minivan.

215
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,887
- [girls cheering]
- [clapping rhythmically]

216
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,861
[spectators shouting]

217
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:42,204
<i>[Kelby] Tuttle. Country town.</i>

218
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,363
- [crowd] What did he say?
- [Kelby] Friday <i>night</i> games.

219
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,407
[girls chanting] Football, football
Let's play football!

220
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:51,207
[boys chanting] Defence!
Defence! Defence!

221
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,350
<i>[Kelby] Bible Belt Oklahoma.</i>

222
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:00,182
<i>Any time someone comes around
that's the least bit different,</i>

223
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:03,087
<i>they make sure to put 'em down.</i>

224
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:13,200
This is where I got the most crap.
Playing basketball.

225
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,269
I loved basketball.

226
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:19,739
But they just told me many times
they don't want to touch me.

227
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,607
It's pretty much on that court
was my worst year ever.

228
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,752
Every time I look at that board,

229
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,978
I know my name
should be up there.

230
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,983
<i>I was told many times I could
have got a scholarship.</i>

231
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,900
<i>I was a cutter.</i>

232
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,267
<i>I've tried to commit suicide
three times.</i>

233
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:59,108
<i>[man] Once Kelby came out
and the town learned about her,</i>

234
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,148
<i>it was overnight.</i>

235
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,088
<i>We've pretty much been
isolated here.</i>

236
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:10,018
There are people that we spent...

237
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:15,928
years with, side by side,
coaching their children...

238
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:20,002
that will not even wave to us
any more, won't look at us.

239
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,505
We were sitting in the car one day,
driving down the street

240
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,473
and I looked over at her,
and it was just me and her in the car,

241
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,512
and I said, "Kelby, are you gay?"

242
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,344
And she started crying and saying,
"Don't hate me.

243
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,646
Please don't stop loving me."

244
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,847
She never said yes,
but I could tell by her reaction

245
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,392
that she was
and she was scared to death.

246
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,020
I mean, she grew up in a family
that taught Sunday school

247
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,360
and raised her to believe that...

248
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,502
that was a sin

249
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,798
[sniffles]

250
00:19:55,961 --> 00:20:01,343
And I think you feel that way
until you're in that situation,

251
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,481
and... and then it's personal.

252
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:13,179
<i>[Kelby] They made it very clear
that I wasn't welcomed at the school.</i>

253
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,883
When I opened my locker,
there was a note that said,

254
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,154
"Faggots aren't welcomed here."

255
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,230
And the teacher was calling roll

256
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:27,234
and said, "Boys,"
and then he said, "Girls"

257
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,532
and then paused and said, "Kelby."

258
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:35,668
<i>And another teacher told me
how they burned fags,</i>

259
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:40,249
and kept talking about it
with me in the classroom,

260
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,214
and everyone was laughing.

261
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,588
And they knew it was hunting me,
and they kept going.

262
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,590
And I offered her the out.
I said, "You know,"

263
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,695
we can go somewhere bigger.

264
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,695
Somewhere where it's not
gonna be like a microscope

265
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,460
and you're not
gonna be an outcast,

266
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,104
"and if you want to do that
I understand. We'll go."

267
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,036
And from the very first day,

268
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:07,734
she said, "No, if I leave, they win."

269
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,936
The school doesn't care.

270
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,309
We've had so many meetings
with the principal

271
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:15,111
and the superintendent.

272
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,312
And they all give you
the same plastic smile

273
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:23,654
and say, "Yes, I understand.
I'll do everything I can."

274
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,817
And nothing's ever done.

275
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,998
- [woman] I love you too.
- [man] I'll see you here in a bit.

276
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,405
- [woman] OK.
- [girl] Bye. I'll see you.

277
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,296
[woman sighs]

278
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:06,595
This was Troy's room,
and this was Tyler's room.

279
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:10,001
And when David opened the door,
that was Tyler's bed.

280
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,768
And he saw the note
lying on the bed.

281
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,877
But, of course, you can't see
into the closet from here

282
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,341
because it's just a door.

283
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,947
So when David walked in

284
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:22,779
is when he saw the inside of the closet,
and there was Tyler.

285
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,888
And then, of course,
David yelled for me, and Troy got up.

286
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:31,187
So Troy... saw everything.

287
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,387
He saw everything.

288
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,032
So we had to switch them.
That's what we thought was best.

289
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,826
We put Troy
on that side of the house

290
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:42,165
and moved Teryn on this side
of the house and just repainted.

291
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:45,069
Because that was the only way
we could get through.

292
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,404
Because all we see
when we come in here still...

293
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,740
[clears throat]

294
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,007
is the picture
of Tyler hanging there.

295
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:58,816
So we had to change everything,
and now this is headquarters.

296
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:03,756
Headquarters for the e-mails,
headquarters for...

297
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,259
our project of working
to keep Tyler's voice alive.

298
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,568
[sighs] We took the shelf down.

299
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:21,400
We took the shelf down,
you can see.

300
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,050
<i>[woman] Breathe, breathe, breathe.</i>

301
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:30,719
Ready?

302
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:34,619
One, two, three, four, and five,
six, seven, eight.

303
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,061
[continues counting]

304
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:45,095
[indistinct conversation]

305
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:51,637
[instructor] Turn around,
and ball change, and turns.

306
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,470
Your turns have been
phenomenal today.

307
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:57,273
And drop over and roll. Up.

308
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:02,481
- Bye. Thanks.
- Bye.

309
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,620
<i>[David] When I found him
that morning...</i>

310
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,659
we knew...

311
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,966
why Tyler did what he did.

312
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,329
There was no doubt in our minds.

313
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:30,778
<i>When... you're in the shower
and your clothes are taken,</i>

314
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,678
and you have no way
of getting out of the gym

315
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,341
other than walking out naked.

316
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:39,353
When you're standing
in the bathroom

317
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,924
and you're urinating,
and kids come up

318
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:44,754
and push you from behind
up against the stall

319
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:48,295
and against the wall
and you urinate on your pants.

320
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:51,297
When you're sitting in the classroom,
somebody comes by and grabs your books

321
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,926
and throws them on the floor
and tells you, "Pick them up, bitch."

322
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:58,939
Those are things that happened to Tyler.

323
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,674
<i>Did he ever come home
with blood running down his face? No.</i>

324
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:10,519
<i>It was the mental abuse</i>

325
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:14,714
<i>and the not-so-physical abuse
that Tyler endured.</i>

326
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:21,058
<i>We can control what goes inside
those walls, inside the school.</i>

327
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:26,464
And the atmosphere has to be set
completely by all the administration.

328
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,499
<i>They all are part
of the school system,</i>

329
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,642
<i>and they're there
to protect the kids.</i>

330
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:38,238
<i>And if they don't,
then this is what happens.</i>

331
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:46,580
He had a target on his back.
Everybody knew that.

332
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:23,249
Hold on, hold on.
Wait, wait here. Come by me.

333
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,792
Come on.

334
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,255
[Jada] There's a car coming.

335
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,263
I don't want to go on...

336
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,801
Here, I just got
these new shoes so...

337
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,371
[Jada] I got my own princess shoes!

338
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:37,768
[babbling]

339
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,441
- [Alex] Yeah, water?
- [Jada] Turn the water on.

340
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,745
- [mother] How'd it go?
- Good and...

341
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:55,323
nobody did anything
to me today, so...

342
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,920
[mother] That's good.

343
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,293
How was your day?

344
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,474
Are you in there?

345
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:18,306
- Yeah.
- Good to know.

346
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,417
I'm glad you didn't have
any problems today.

347
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,147
Next time I get
the whole story, OK?

348
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,324
<i>[Jackie] He doesn't
share a whole lot.</i>

349
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,092
<i>He was always pretty quiet.</i>

350
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,173
<i>He was born at 26-weeks gestation.</i>

351
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:52,441
<i>Uh... So that's pretty far from 40.</i>

352
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:56,017
<i>Um... and, uh...</i>

353
00:27:56,174 --> 00:28:00,714
<i>they came in and said that...</i>

354
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:04,452
<i>They said he wouldn't live 24 hours.</i>

355
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,961
It's 13 years, so he made it.

356
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:24,476
<i>My biggest goal for him
is I need him to learn to communicate.</i>

357
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:31,184
You spend all your free time
with these little people.

358
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:37,082
It's crazy to think you
don't really know them

359
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,990
or what happens to them or...

360
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,692
[sighs] It's scaly.

361
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,379
[students chattering]

362
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,378
- What?
- You feel that?

363
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,858
Hey, I texted you back.

364
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,369
They must be coming in.
Bringing them in, Vicky?

365
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:40,245
You all right, Cole?

366
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,288
Mrs. Lockwood,
I'm in the middle of this,

367
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,826
- and I'm sick and tired of it.
- No, no, no. You just go, OK?

368
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:50,626
Cole, stay right here.
Right here.

369
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,066
I'm gonna ask you guys
to shake hands. Can you do that?

370
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:56,637
- Yeah.
- Shake hands.

371
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:01,003
Cole!

372
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,804
- Cole!
- [Cole] What?

373
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,811
You are not going anywhere.

374
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,850
He is offering his hand.
And let this drop.

375
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,180
[groans]

376
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,285
You may go.

377
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:17,153
Cole, I expected more.

378
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,659
He criticizes me every single day.

379
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,095
- Then why are you around him?
- I don't. He comes to me.

380
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:25,632
I try to get away from him,
he follows me.

381
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,533
And he criticizes me,
calling me a "P-U-S-S-Y."

382
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:32,675
OK, honey, that's not right,
and he shouldn't do that.

383
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,367
- I don't even know why.
- You know what?

384
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,808
He was trying
to say he was sorry.

385
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,879
He already did,
and he didn't mean it

386
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,539
because it continued on.

387
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:44,983
You didn't mean it when you
stuck out your hand, either.

388
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:48,056
So that means you're
just like him, right?

389
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:51,786
- What you don't like in him, you...
- Except I don't hurt people.

390
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,488
By not shaking his hand,
you're just like him.

391
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,655
Like someone who
pushes you into walls,

392
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,460
threatens to break your arm,

393
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:02,161
threatens to stab you and kill you?
Shoot you with a gun?

394
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,568
He apologized.

395
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,141
Have you reported
all that son of stuff?

396
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:09,801
- Yes.
- OK, then it's been taken care of.

397
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,141
And all of them said,
even the cops said...

398
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:13,543
told him to stay away from me,

399
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,843
- and he doesn't.
- OK.

400
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,215
All right. Can you try to get along?

401
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,380
I think you guys might be
really good friends at some time.

402
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,857
We were.
And then he started bullying me.

403
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,996
[school bell rings]

404
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:33,197
[children chattering]

405
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,860
Ow.

406
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:52,848
Two people to a seat, dumb-ass.

407
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,924
Get out of the damn seat!
There's two people already here.

408
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,292
<i>[Alex] They punch me in the jaw...</i>

409
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:10,029
strangle me.

410
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,243
<i>They knock things
out of my hand...</i>

411
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,304
<i>take things from me...</i>

412
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,312
sit on me.

413
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:34,488
<i>They... push me so far that...</i>

414
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:38,395
that I... I want to become the bully.

415
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:58,777
This is her comfort zone,
to herself.

416
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,147
She was a basketball player.

417
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,987
These are her trophies, her awards.

418
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:09,454
Got her names on them
and everything.

419
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:14,797
She's an honour student.

420
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:20,609
Yeah, she is an honour student.

421
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,335
She said when she finished school,

422
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,041
she said she wanted to go to the, uh,
Navy, I think that's what she said.

423
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:29,879
Because she didn't
want to see me work so hard,

424
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,884
and she wanted to help me out.

425
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,032
<i>She said, "Mama, I'm sorry."</i>

426
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,872
<i>She said, "I didn't mean
to put you through this. "</i>

427
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,538
<i>She said, "I got tired
of them messing with me,</i>

428
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,706
<i>picking at me, day by day. "</i>

429
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,183
She said, "Mama, I wasn't
trying to hurt nobody."

430
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:05,753
I just wanted to scare them."

431
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,734
<i>[Ja'Meya] It all started back
when school first began,</i>

432
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:25,273
<i>and there was a lot of kids on the bus
saying things about me.</i>

433
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:38,743
I tried my best to tell an adult,
but it got worse.

434
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:46,726
It was about 8:30 to 8:45

435
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:50,093
when I got the call that morning.

436
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,531
- [telephone ringing]
- [indistinct chattering]

437
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,368
[Barbara ]I was shocked,

438
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,734
<i>because I couldn't believe
that was my daughter.</i>

439
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:01,740
And I asked the lady, I said,
"Are you sure you got my daughter?"

440
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,436
And she said, "Yeah."
I said, "Well, what is her name?"

441
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,878
She said, "Ja'Meya Jackson."

442
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:11,150
And it's like I just...
My heart just dropped.

443
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:12,982
'Cause I couldn't believe it.

444
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,920
I'm like, "She couldn't
have gotten my gun."

445
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,151
And she said, "She got your gun."

446
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:21,058
And I'm like,
"She didn't hurt anybody, did she?"

447
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,426
<i>She said, "No,
she didn't hurt anybody. "</i>

448
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:34,272
<i>[Ja'Meya] It felt like everybody
just turned against me.</i>

449
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:36,844
It was like nine of them,
nine or ten of them

450
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:40,471
<i>calling me stupid and dumb,</i>

451
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:45,144
<i>and they started
throwing things at me.</i>

452
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,255
<i>And one of the guys
said something to me,</i>

453
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:49,584
<i>and he threatened me, talking
about what he was gonna do to me,</i>

454
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:52,853
<i>and he'll fight girls,
and everybody was laughing.</i>

455
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:54,963
And I was telling him to be quiet,

456
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,759
and he kept talking,
and that's when I got up.

457
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,526
<i>[Woman] What?</i>

458
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,537
<i>Now come here, baby.</i>

459
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:06,103
<i>Come here, baby.</i>

460
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,868
<i>[Ja'Meya muttering]</i>

461
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,672
<i>- Popped a gun on...
- [woman] What did you do?</i>

462
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,213
<i>- [woman] What are they doing?
- They're talking,</i>

463
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:16,147
<i>and I pulled a gun on them
showing up on my life now.</i>

464
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:19,550
<i>- Y'all talking?
- [woman] Sit down and leave her alone.</i>

465
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,055
<i>[shouting indistinctly]</i>

466
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:25,387
[man] At the point to where
she takes the gun out,

467
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,463
that's 22 counts of kidnapping.

468
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:32,226
She has 22 counts
of attempted aggravated assault.

469
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,304
She's got 45 total
felony charges facing her.

470
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,066
<i>[Ja'Meya] Y'all quit talking to me!
Do not talk to me!</i>

471
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,733
<i>- [boy] Calm down!
- [Ja'Meya shouting hysterically]</i>

472
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:49,050
For me, there's nothing,
no amount of bullying or teasing

473
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,188
or picking on or whatever,

474
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:55,586
there's nothing unless
someone was actually

475
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,384
whipping on this girl every day,

476
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:01,394
unless someone was hitting
this young lady in the head

477
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,930
and being physically brutal to her,

478
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:07,092
there's nothing, to me,
that justifies

479
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,432
her taking the gun on that bus,
I don't care what it is.

480
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:14,509
- [shouting continuing]
- [screaming]

481
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,110
<i>[boy]! Got it, I got it, I got it.</i>

482
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:19,009
<i>[woman] You've got it?
You have it?</i>

483
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,351
<i>[Ja'Meya] The police, by the time
I had walked up off the bus,</i>

484
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:28,183
<i>he just grabbed my arms
and put the cuffs up on me...</i>

485
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,625
and I walked to the car.

486
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,699
<i>[man] Even though things
came out as best</i>

487
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,199
<i>as they possibly could have,</i>

488
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:43,532
<i>if you added up all the years
that she could get,</i>

489
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,970
<i>it would be hundreds of years.</i>

490
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,939
[sighs]

491
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,879
Yeah, that would devastate me.

492
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,387
I don't even know
if I could live behind it.

493
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,761
I really don't.

494
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:10,296
[woman] Our Father,
who an in Heaven...

495
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,492
we come to you right now gathered
with bowed down heads, oh, Father God.

496
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:17,572
We ask you, right now, oh, Father God,
in your dying son Jesus' name forever

497
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,799
to have mercy up on us.

498
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,807
<i>[woman 2] I just never thought.</i>

499
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,446
<i>I'd see this happening
to this family.</i>

500
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:27,082
I hate that she was getting
bullied like that

501
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,309
and we couldn't do anything about it.

502
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,849
'Cause Ja'Meya don't mess with anybody.

503
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:39,156
It's going on in all schools,
it's happening to all kids,

504
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,593
and it's a problem
that needs to be stopped,

505
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,823
an end needs to be put to it now.

506
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,832
- That's right.
- Children hurt themselves

507
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,801
and hurt others all the time
because of bullying.

508
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,170
'Cause parents don't talk to their
children about not bullying.

509
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,107
- Right.
- Teachers don't do nothing

510
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,871
about kids bullying.

511
00:38:58,035 --> 00:38:59,639
The board don't do nothing,

512
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:02,216
the principals don't do nothing,
nothing is done.

<i>crowded a Murray County
schoolroom this evening,</i>

527
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,054
<i>all revolving
around the recent death</i>

528
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,190
<i>of 17-year-old Tyler Long.</i>

529
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:18,418
<i>His parents say unpunished bullying
at the school</i>

530
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,755
<i>led him to take his own life.</i>

531
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,894
<i>[David] There were numerous times</i>

532
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,536
<i>that I had to leave work
to go to the school</i>

533
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:32,936
<i>because of situations that
arose with Tyler being bullied.</i>

534
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:38,740
Their attitude was, "We can't stop kids
from saying bad things."

535
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:43,545
We can't watch what every kid
does at every moment."

536
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:46,654
You don't want
to take care of the problem.

537
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:49,291
And if you did want to take care of it,
it would be took care of.

538
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,394
Bullying is a serious problem
in American schools.

539
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,154
- It would be...
- [Tina] In this school.

540
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,128
- It would be unfair to say...
- Let's be honest, this school.

541
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,631
OK, it would be unfair to say

542
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,462
that we do not have
instances of bullying.

543
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,434
My baby was missing two
and three days of school a week

544
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,471
because there's
a gang of five boys

545
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,838
threatening to beat him up
at school every single day.

546
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:12,003
It was reported to everyone
and nobody did nothing.

547
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,083
<i>"[David] " Kids will be kids,
boys will be boys.</i>

548
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,584
<i>They're just cruel at this age. "</i>

549
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:20,813
<i>And it was
a continuous fight with them.</i>

550
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:25,290
The perception that the school
is a haven for bullies is just not true.

551
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,656
Do we have some bullying problems?
I'm sure we do.

552
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,196
All school systems do.

553
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:33,767
But is it a major overarching
concern in our high school?

554
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:35,301
No, it is not.

555
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,029
<i>My name's Tina Long.
I'm Tyler's mother.</i>

556
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,072
[sniffling]

557
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:18,179
Um, I'm a nurse,
and I appreciate y'all being here.

558
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,508
I'm David Long.
I'm retired military

559
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:23,015
and work with the BoEU,
over on Fifth Avenue,

560
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:26,347
in extrusion
as a department manager.

561
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:30,014
And I, too, really
wanted to thank everybody

562
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,525
for coming out tonight
and being here.

563
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:37,359
We have invited either superintendent
or anyone from central office

564
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:39,364
or school board members
to participate.

565
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,196
So I want to, right up front,

566
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:42,996
if anyone's here
from Murray County schools,

567
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,164
we'd love to have you up here
to represent the school system.

568
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:51,940
OK, uh, we did invite them.
I wish someone had come.

569
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:53,877
That's all you can do.

570
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:59,179
My name's Jeff Johnson,
and I run a business here,

571
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,846
I'm also a pastor at a local church.

572
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:04,288
Some of the church kids came to me

573
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:08,021
after Tyler had committed
this awful thing,

574
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:12,031
and they said that kids came
to school on the next school day

575
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:13,634
with ropes around their necks.

576
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,429
My question
to the school board would be,

577
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:20,406
why in God's name would some teacher,
some counsellor,

578
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:23,272
somebody in enforcement
not do something?

579
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,472
Because that is very
derogatory to any kid.

580
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:29,618
That's like a slap in the face
to these parents.

581
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:34,449
And my question is, if bartenders are
responsible for a drunk

582
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,489
that goes out and kills
an innocent person,

583
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,320
how come the bullies
are not responsible

584
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:40,894
for the death
of this precious child?

585
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:48,225
This is an awfully complicated
and difficult issue.

586
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:53,171
I know there's a lot of anger
about the school system here.

587
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,937
But the school can't, by itself,

588
00:43:57,101 --> 00:44:00,776
change a child's behaviour
if they're going home

589
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:04,977
and not being reinforced at home

590
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,315
- to change their behaviour.
- [woman] Good luck with that.

591
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:11,016
Most of these parents could really,
I hate to say it, could care less.

592
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:13,821
We've been there, done that.
You're not going to get them in there.

593
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,157
So then what do you do?

594
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,928
We've been
in this scenario, and...

595
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:26,464
you couldn't get
the parents involved.

596
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,268
So then what do you do?

597
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:30,173
And we went to the police.

598
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,813
Their hands are tied.

599
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:35,280
You go to the school,
um, "Kids will be kids."

600
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,942
Um, "Let these girls work it out."

601
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:41,112
Um, "Let your child work it out."

602
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:44,122
Well, it's not just in school.

603
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:48,320
They go on the Internet,
cell phones.

604
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:52,627
They can damage somebody's life,
like they did to your son.

605
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:03,240
Yes, I'm Howard Ensley.
I'm the sheriff here in Murray County.

606
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,006
We have school resource
officers in the school,

607
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,309
and they're there
to protect the students.

608
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:10,349
[Tina] Mr. Ensley,

609
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:14,978
last year when two children
beat Tyler up,

610
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:16,988
your school resource officer

611
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:21,687
refused to file the charges.

612
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:23,024
I had to fight.

613
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:25,724
Here, what we get is,
"Nothing's wrong.

614
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:30,998
We didn't do anything.
Everything's fine."

615
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:34,370
But, bottom-line here is, when you send
your child to that school,

616
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:37,273
it doesn't matter
what parents that child has,

617
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:40,540
they should be
safe and protected. Period.

618
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:52,353
[David] There's a young man
back there with his hand up.

619
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:53,517
Are you a student?

620
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:56,187
- Yes, I'm a student.
- OK, if you would.

621
00:45:57,621 --> 00:46:00,795
Um, I was a very good
friend of Tyler Long's,

622
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:04,269
and whenever you'd
walk around that school,

623
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,567
you notice
that everybody gets bullied.

624
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,438
And then the teachers
just kind of shrug it off.

625
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,911
As in, "Oh, he done
something wrong to that kid,"

626
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:17,450
that's why he got what he got.
And it's OK, it's just fine."

627
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:22,057
That's a load of daggom crap.
It's a big lie.

628
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:24,954
[David] All right, DJ,
thank you very much.

629
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:29,730
[boy] I've been dealing with it for four
years, and I finally got tired of it.

630
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:33,733
[David] So one day you'd
had enough. What'd you do?

631
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:37,134
I just went off on the kid
because I couldn't stand it any more.

632
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,740
I couldn't take it.
It came to the point that, last year,

633
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:45,006
I stayed out of school purposely
to try to stay away from them.

634
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:47,979
I've been to my mom,
my grandparents and the principal,

635
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,617
all for the last three years,

636
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:51,309
and they haven't done
anything about it.

637
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,183
It's a shame that Tyler
had to do what he done

638
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:58,156
for people to notice what's going on
in the schools at Murray County.

639
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:02,161
It's a shame that he had to do
this for anybody to notice it.

640
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,499
[David] We can make a difference.

641
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,934
We can make a difference for kids

642
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,266
that don't have to go four years

643
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:16,673
of torment and sadness
and not wanna go to school.

644
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:21,146
As I told the school board,
my voice is not gonna fall silent.

645
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:26,118
I will go to my grave
until a difference is made.

646
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:43,370
I know what Tyler was going through.

647
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,235
I know how he was
thinking about suicide.

648
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,644
They went around,
they were calling me a pussy,

649
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:55,875
shoving me into lockers,
saying, "Eff you."

650
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:59,748
And now, after I've
actually stood up for myself,

651
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:04,757
they just walk by me, like,
"Oh, there's another kid.

652
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:07,486
He's just another kid
here at our school."

653
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:11,695
It really came down to the point

654
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:15,200
that I had to go, myself,
and literally stand up for myself

655
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,430
for them to leave me alone.

656

[sighs]

658
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:29,707
Come here, buddy. Hi, buddy.

659
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:32,854
Calm down. It's OK.

Hey, it's OK. TJ. TJ.

00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,896
Hey, TJ.

[wind howling]

667
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:43,289
Well, I think this year we're
gonna get 25 inches of snow.

668
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:46,121
I have to shovel it, though.
That stinks.

669

[water running]

670

- Shut up.

<i>You gonna dance for mom?
You want some faster music?</i>

672
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:07,204
[Jackie] You had just
the cutest little face.

673
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:10,147
You had
the chubbiest little cheeks.

674
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,810
Look how cute you are.

675
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,217
- [man] What happened?
- [Jackie laughs]

676
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:20,561
There was one song I'd play,

677
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:23,789
and he'd just bounce
to the beat, back and forth.

678
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:30,236
[Jackie]
Alex, do you want to dance?

679
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:33,034
- Here.
- ["One Headlight" plays]

680

[Jackie laughs]

681
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:42,173
Dance.

682
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:49,987
<i>Hey! All right, that's my head.</i>

683

- Come <i>on.</i>

00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,389
<i>All right.</i>

00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,030
[man] All rise.

686
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:42,742
Yazoo County Youth Court
is now in session.

687
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:45,311
Judge Derek Parker presiding.

688
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:12,333
- [Barbara] It's over.
- Not yet.

689
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:15,170
- [Barbara] It is. What do you mean?
- I'm still here.

690
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:16,572
[Barbara laughing]

691
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:18,508
I'm saying the hard pan
is over, sweetie.

692
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:22,115
- You're going home.
- In three months.

693
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:23,979
You don't know,
you keep saying three months.

694
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,315
You gonna speak three months,
and it's gonna be three.

695
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,926
You hear?

696
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:35,689
[laughs] You gaining
some weight. Them thighs, girl.

697
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:40,162
I just wanna get bigger, plumper.

698
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,597
- What?
- I wanna get plump.

699
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:43,032
No, you don't.

700
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:45,605
You gonna look a hot mess.

701
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:52,772
Uh-uh. You don't want
to get too big, Ja'Meya.

702
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:58,518
So the doctor said
you're doing good. OK?

703
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,655
You stop being all that,
'cause he said you were doing good.

704
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:05,020
He told me you were doing good.
Said, "She doing real good."

705
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:12,165
[sighs] You wasn't thinking,
and you made a big mistake.

706
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,697
Don't cry.

707
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:24,334
- I want to go home, Ma.
- I know, baby.

708
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:29,246
You're going.
You're going, Ja'Meya.

709
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:30,885
[sniffling]

710
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:42,592
You're going home.

711
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,500
[sniffling]

712
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:00,173
It'll be all right.

713
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,455
I want you to work on
getting yourself together, OK?

714
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:13,060
So you can come home.
Might not be but a month or two.

715
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:15,696
- All right?
- OK.

716
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,200
I'm going to go see
where the doctor's at.

717
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:20,926
I'll see you in a bit.

718
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:33,307
[indistinct chattering]

719
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,040
[girl] As you're voting,
vote for the candidates

720
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,445
you can trust and rely on.

721
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,608
This is not a popularity contest.

722
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,413
[boy] If we work together
to show how great we can be

723
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:41,817
with our behaviour and grades,

724
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:43,719
we can make East Middle
a better school.

725
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,985
Remember, a vote for Trevor
is the best vote ever.

726
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:48,095
Thank you.

727
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,498
[girl] Next,
we have Chloe Albright.

728
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,800
[applause]

729
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,102
Hey, guys,
my name is Chloe Albright.

730
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:05,246
I am here giving this speech
because I would like to be.

731
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:07,348
East Middle's
next student body president.

732
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:09,415
[students chattering]

733
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:12,951
Zip that up, zip that up.

734
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:16,579
It got ripped. It can't zip up.

735
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,661
[girls laughing]

736
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,201
- [father] Alex?
- What?

737
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:35,001
[father] Come here.

738
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:43,946
What happened this week
on the bus? Anything?

739
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,219
This high-schooler was strangling me,

740
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:52,883
but I think he was
just messing around.

741
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:57,794
He, uh, calls me the b-word.

742
00:55:57,954 --> 00:56:00,867
- And he says that I'm...
- That's not messing around.

743
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:06,303
- Well, he says I'm his b-word.
- That's not messing around.

744
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:10,377
But I think when he strangles me
he's messing around.

745
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:11,876
That's not messing around, either.

746
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,873
- [Alex] OK.
- [Philip] Who knows, next year

747
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,418
this high school kid,
instead of picking on you,

748
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:22,250
is gonna then pick on
your little sister.

749
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:24,824
And what are you gonna do about it?

750
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:27,052
'Cause you're her big brother.

751
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,763
You can't let this stuff go on.

752
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:36,428
'Cause then people just start
seeing you as a punching bag.

753
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:41,736
Nobody respects a punching bag.

754
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,038
Well, if Maya gets picked on,
I'll tell somebody about it.

755
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:49,013
- But if I get picked on...
- You should stop it now.

756
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:54,845
You're starting to make me
scared to go to middle school.

757
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:56,422
[Alex] Why?

758
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,684
'Cause if you get picked on,
I'm gonna get picked on.

759
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:02,091
I already get picked on at school
'cause you're my brother.

760
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,232
[Alex] Well,
that makes a lot of sense.

761
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:09,097
Why do you get picked on
'cause I'm your brother?

762
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,932
That makes no sense at all.

763
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,471
Kids don't like you at my school.

Bullying's not cool.
And I'll tell you,

823
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:14,167
in the second grade, I tried
to fit in with so many people

824
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:16,325
that I was probably
the biggest bully

825
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:19,063
in the whole school,
when I was in second grade.

826
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:21,799
But once I got into third...

827
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:25,912
In third, I started to realize
what a jerk I was being to kids

828
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:27,411
and what it could do.

829
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,572
And then in fourth
I really started realizing

830
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:31,514
that it's gonna hurt someone,

831
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:33,654
so I decided
to be cool with everyone.

832
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:40,651
Even when people would bully him

833
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:46,631
I'd, like, I'd get
so angry, and I could...

834
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:50,293
I think I could have hurt those kids
so bad that done something to him.

835
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:53,702
Like they'll push him down and say,
"Shut up, spaz. You're a spaz,"

836
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:57,367
or throw him into a locker
or shove him into one.

837
01:03:57,533 --> 01:04:01,504
And I'd just, like, go to take off
after them and he'd be like,

838
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,550
"Trey, it's not worth it.
Be better than them.

839
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:08,052
"It's all right." And then
he'd walk off with a smile.

840
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:11,624
And I don't know
how he could do it.

841
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:14,819
He was way stronger than I was.

842
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:23,527
If it was up to me, if I was
the king of the United States,

843
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:26,401
I'd make it to where
there was no popularity,

844
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:31,068
everyone was equal,
because that's how it should be.

have been after that so quick.

hold it in any more, they cry?

It's someone else on the planet
you can connect with.

917
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:07,174
Your only connection to these kids
is that they like to pound on you.

918
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:17,479
If you... If you say
these people aren't my friends,

919
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:20,525
then what friends do I have?

920
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:43,539
[Jackie] I'd like to see Kim
or Paula or someone?

921
01:10:43,706 --> 01:10:44,707
- [woman] Are you guys together?
- Yes.

922
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:46,546
[woman] OK.

923
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:51,085
How can I help you guys?

924
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:54,126
My voice is shaking.
I'm very upset.

925
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:57,560
I'm gonna be honest. I'm upset enough I
don't want him to ride the bus any more.

926
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:00,360
- What bus is he on?
- Fifty-four.

927
01:11:00,522 --> 01:11:02,968
- OK.
- It's absolutely not acceptable.

928
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:05,628
I mean, they're
stabbing him with pencils,

929
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:07,933
and choking him, and...

930
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:13,809
Buses are notoriously bad places
for lots of kids.

931
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:17,075
I... You know, I wish I could say

932
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:19,742
I could make it stop on that,
but I'm not gonna lie to you.

933
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:24,948
I can't. Um, but what we can do
is we can get him on another bus.

934
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:29,986
So if I put him on another bus
I have, what, little to no guarantee

935
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:31,961
that he'll be safe on that bus, either?

936
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,601
When I was on the bus,
when I was a kid,

937
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:36,634
if you got out
of your seat, they pulled over,

938
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:40,501
the whole world stopped until
everybody sat down and shut up.

939
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:44,076
How come they don't do anything now?
They just drive.

940
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:47,146
Like, there should be
more responsibility than that.

941
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,442
She's... [stammering]

942
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:51,846
It's gotta be heard, at least,

943
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:54,783
and they're up, running up
and down the hall of the bus.

944
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:57,082
Now, I've ridden 54.

945
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,955
I've been on that route.

946
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:02,288
I've been on a couple of them.

947
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:04,453
They are just as good as gold.

948
01:12:10,926 --> 01:12:13,099
I feel real bad
that this happened.

949
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:14,536
You send your kids to school
with the assumption

950
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:16,199
that if they're out of your care,

951
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:18,845
they're in someone else's
who is just as capable as you

952
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:21,743
of keeping them safe,
and I don't feel like that.

953
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:25,851
- He's not safe on that bus.
- [Lockwood] I don't, either.

954
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:29,683
It's hard. It is hard.
And you know what?

955
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:32,189
This was my day on Thursday.

956
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:35,056
This is my granddaughter
and her new baby brother.

957
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:37,390
I'd be sitting there,
crying, just like you

958
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:39,897
if anything happened
to those two kids.

959
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:44,866
See my new baby, huh?

960
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:50,073
We don't want anything
to happen to these babies.

961
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:52,678
Any of them.

962
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:57,215
This is totally wrong, totally wrong
that this situation would happen.

963
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,853
Absolutely. But...

964
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:03,080
It just seems to me,
if it's a few kids, then...

965
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:04,918
you take away the few kids.

966
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:09,856
[sighs] You'll just have to trust me

967
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:12,055
that we'll take care
of that other child.

968
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:14,497
And I really am glad you came in.

969
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:18,938
Come on.

970
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:22,002
Goodbye, sweetie.

971
01:13:22,164 --> 01:13:23,336
- Thanks again.
- Thank you.

972
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:25,445
- I'll talk to you later, OK?
- All right.

973
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:31,076
We're sorry about this,
but we will take care of it.

974
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:34,346
Wait for your mom.

975
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:35,955
[Jackie] What did she say
when we were leaving,

976
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:38,557
"We'll take care of it"? I'm pretty sure
that's what she said in the fall.

977
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:40,125
[Philip] Yeah.

978
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:44,128
[Jackie] She politicianed us.
She'd not gonna do anything.

979
01:13:57,966 --> 01:14:02,642
[Lockwood] If something is not done
and the kids don't hear about it,

980
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:06,082
it will say, "Oh, this is fine."

981
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,087
<i>[Crandall]
What I'm doing is investigating</i>

982
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:13,226
<i>what happened to Alex the other day.</i>

983
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:15,828
<i>- Do you...
- [boy] Alex the red...</i>

984
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:17,964
the red-haired one
or the blond-haired one?

985
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,394
Can you tell me
a little bit about it?

986
01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:21,466
'Cause I don't know,
really, much about it.

987
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:23,796
I've seen people doing stuff to him,

988
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:28,499
but I don't know nothing about,
like, what's really been going on.

989
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:32,134
[Crandall] Have you ever seen
anything happen to him on the bus

990
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,838
that would be considered hurtful?

991
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:36,778
Not that I know of.

992
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:41,479
Teddy and other people, like,
call him "fish face" on the bus.

993
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:44,783
It's jokes and stuff,
and he even laughs about it.

994
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:47,427
- So, yeah.
- [Crandall] OK.

995
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:51,159
Hi, Jerry, come on in.

996
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:58,999
I understand that you
haven't been getting along

997
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,767
very well with Alex Hopkins.

998
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:06,511
Um, sometimes we have, like,

999
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:10,138
this kid from the high school
that picks on me and him.

1000
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:12,943
He's kinda chubby.

1001
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:21,024
[Crandall] Do you think that
the bus is very safe, Thomas?

1002
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,526
No.

1003
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:26,723
[Crandall]
And have you ever hit him?

1004
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:30,666
Uh, yes, I have because
he's really made me mad.

1005
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:34,864
[Crandall]
You will not be teasing anybody,

1006
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,067
or using bad words.

1007
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:39,838
OK.

1008
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:43,848
You tell me "OK,"
and I'll believe it when I see it.

1009
01:15:48,243 --> 01:15:50,484
You will be talking
to Officer Mattus,

1010
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:53,923
and you probably won't be riding
that bus for the rest of the year

1011
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:58,053
if you think that it's OK
for you to hit people.

1012
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:02,669
"Go ahead, hit him,
attack him, do it."

1013
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,367
And that's going
in your discipline file.

1014
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:09,099
- OK.
- All right?

1015
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:11,608
I'll be watching you.

1016
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:23,619
What's one thing that you need
to start doing that you haven't done?

1017
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:28,961
- Tell someone.
- Yes.

1018
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:32,360
Do you trust us that we'll
do something when you tell us

1019
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:34,762
that someone's bothering you?

1020
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:40,703
Well, in sixth grade,
uh, you, uh...

1021
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:44,538
did nothing about, uh,

1022
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,771
Teddy sitting on my head.

1023
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:51,874
- On the bus?
- Yeah, there's, like, a little knob.

1024
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,611
Then, once you unlock that knob,

1025
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:56,778
you can, like, lift up the seats.

1026
01:16:56,945 --> 01:17:01,485
And he lifted up the seat,
put my head in it, sat on my head.

1027
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:04,426
[Crandall] How do you know
I didn't do anything?

1028
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:07,657
I don't know, 'cause...

1029
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:12,568
Alex, did he sit on
your head after you told me?

1030
01:17:12,694 --> 01:17:15,106
- He...
- I did talk to him.

1031
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:19,403
And he didn't do that again, did he?

1032
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:25,475
[Alex]

1033
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,817
[indistinct chattering]

1034
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:38,129
Come on, pop the trunk.

1035
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:41,392
[chattering indistinctly]

1036
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:55,673
I'm home! Whoo!

1037
01:17:57,606 --> 01:17:59,313
[all laughing]

1038
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:03,322
I'm at home!

1039
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,536
The house looks so better.

1040
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:23,074
Oh! It looks so different.

1041
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:32,579
Ooh!

1042
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:34,652
Ooh-whee.

1043
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:40,522
Mom, the house looks so pretty.

1044
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:44,425
- [Barbara laughs] Huh?
- It looks so pretty.

1045
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:46,259
- [Barbara] What?
- It's just like my first time here.

1046
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:47,593
Why do you keep
turning the lights off?

1047
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:49,736
Oh, my bad.

1048
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:06,775
[chuckles]

1049
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:12,119
"Sometimes sweetness and love
is all you need."

1050
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:17,423
Dear Mother, I want to thank you
for all you have given me:

1051
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,089
Love, trust, care, help, fun, life.

1052
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:22,633
Happy Mother's Day.

1053
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:25,935
This coupon is good
for one chore.

1054
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:30,099
This coupon is good
for one breakfast in bed.

1055
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:33,644
"This coupon is good
for three days of fun."

1056
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:40,146
[all laughing]

1057
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,158
[clears throat] Mmm.

1058
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:52,955
Kinda sucks that it's Mother's Day.

1059
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:55,226
I don't feel like
a very good mother today.

1060
01:19:57,225 --> 01:20:00,638
Come here. Come here.

1061
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,776
[sobbing]

1062
01:20:10,605 --> 01:20:12,949
Alex, he just can't fit in.

1063
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:14,815
He tries.

1064
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:19,152
He just comes across
so weird to people, you know?

1065
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:22,727
What really
ticks me off is, like,

1066
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:25,159
if they got to know him,

1067
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,460
he'd probably be the most
devoted friend they ever had.

1068
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:34,536
I'm sure we haven't made
things easier here, huh?

1069
01:20:34,696 --> 01:20:37,506
If he came home and told us
this stuff, on a regular basis,

1070
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:41,375
when it happened,
then we would've known.

1071
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:43,675
I imagine
the only thing worse than...

1072
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:47,616
him crying or breaking down
in front of those boys

1073
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:48,846
when they're beating
the crap out of him

1074
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:51,388
is having to come
home and tell you.

1075
01:21:00,222 --> 01:21:01,895
He wants to be you.

1076
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:03,900
Never sees you cry.

1077
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:15,812
Well, the next time he's around,

1078
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:17,917
I'm gonna punch you hard
and you start crying.

[both chuckle]

1080
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:29,556
Um, Mom? Can I ride
my roller skates?

1081
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:31,391
- If you change your pants.
- OK.

1082
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:33,999
If you fall, I don't
want you to rip your slacks.

<i>[woman] May I have your attention,

Why do you always have
your hair like that? Like...

1088
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:59,248
Like, my bangs are weird.

1089

[indistinct chattering]

1090
01:22:03,051 --> 01:22:05,292
OK.

1091

Hold on, let me get
your shin still.

1092
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:20,101

- Hey, can I sign your shin?

1093

Sure.

[girl] Do we get
our things today?

1096
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,082
What is that?

01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:34,193
- I don't know.
- Dumb, probably.

<i>[Alex]! Don't believe in luck,
but I believe in hope.</i>

1099
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:06,182
Right there and right there.
There's the twins right there.

1100
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:09,488
Rebecca... Oh!
I can't tell them apart!

1101
01:23:11,353 --> 01:23:13,697
There's Fatima, right there.

1102
01:23:13,855 --> 01:23:16,836
I asked her if I could
have a dollar at lunch

1103
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:21,805
'cause I wanted to buy a switch,
but she said, "Maybe."

1104
01:23:21,963 --> 01:23:24,239
She has a cute nose.

1105

[laughs]

1106
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:28,841
Girls are like candy.

1107
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:32,281
Sometimes you want,
like, a Hershey's bar,

1108
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,181
sometimes you want
a Snickers bar.

1109
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:36,982
You can't really tell
which one you want.

1110
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:45,487
Sometimes you want,
like, a Popsicle.

1111
01:23:45,653 --> 01:23:47,030
[laughs]

1112
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:52,834
It's a complicated feeling.

[pencil clatters]

1114
01:24:39,507 --> 01:24:41,077
One more week.

1115
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:48,126
When you look back and you wonder
where the year has gone...

1116
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:54,358
and what it would be like
if Tyler was here.

1117
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,037
How would he be?

1118
01:24:58,193 --> 01:25:00,298
How much would he have changed?

1119
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:03,572
You just don't know.

1120
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:21,626
Yeah, you know, I went in thinking
it was gonna be a new year,

1121
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:23,592
and people were used to me.

1122
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:29,929
And I went into class, and the class was
already full and I sat down,

1123
01:25:30,091 --> 01:25:32,628
and everyone around me
moved seats.

1124
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:34,671
Like every single person.

1125
01:25:34,829 --> 01:25:36,968
I was the only one
sitting in a little circle.

1126
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:39,240
That was enough.

1127
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:51,415
Maybe there's another place
I can go try to make a difference.

1128
01:25:52,947 --> 01:25:55,154
We've decided, as of this week,

1129
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:57,091
that we've pulled her
out of school here.

1130
01:25:58,953 --> 01:26:00,364
<i>I never knew what the saying,</i>

1131
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:02,024
<i>"You don't know what
a person's been through</i>

1132

<i>until you walk a mile
in their shoes. "</i>

1133
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:07,997
<i>I never really understood
the depth of that meaning</i>

01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:10,268
<i>until I had a gay child.</i>

1135
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:16,842
It has made me completely re-evaluate
who and what I am as a human being...

1136
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:21,218
to see the ugliness
that has come out.

1137
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:28,290
It took me a while to realize
that you can't change it all at once.

1138
01:26:28,449 --> 01:26:31,157
It's gonna take multiple people,

1139
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:33,856
at separate stages
of people's lives,

1140
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:36,969
talking and making a difference.

1141
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:40,163
It's not just gonna take me.

1142
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:54,751
It's a little one-room schoolhouse

1143
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:58,857
that my grandmother
taught at a long time ago.

1144
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:03,826
And my family's been
out in this area for over 100 years.

1145
01:27:03,985 --> 01:27:08,058
Our farm's
a Centennial Oklahoma Farm.

1146
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:13,534
It's Progress.

1147
01:27:17,565 --> 01:27:19,203
This is home.

1148
01:27:21,336 --> 01:27:25,876
Ty's name is in the foundation
of the house we're living in.

1149
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,713
He helped me build it.

1150
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:31,789
He worked his butt off.
I can't go nowhere.

1151

<i>This is where worldwide

about six weeks ago.

1153
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:03,954
It's a pretty amazing thing.

1154
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,750
The idea came to me,

1155
01:28:05,913 --> 01:28:08,257
and I started this group,
Stand for the Silent,

1156
01:28:08,416 --> 01:28:11,954
in Ty's memory,
to take on bullying, and...

1157
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:15,897
I threw the idea out there,
and it took off like wildfire.

1158
01:28:18,893 --> 01:28:21,499
The lnternet's an amazing thing.

1159
01:28:21,663 --> 01:28:26,976
We... We reached out to parents
that have lost kids

1160
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:30,605
in Illinois and Texas
and Alabama.

1161

bullied all over the world.

They don't have power out there,
on the south lawn of the Capitol,

1166
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:59,134
