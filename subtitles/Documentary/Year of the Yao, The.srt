00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,460
<i>Episode 20.</i>

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,730
Why are you giving this to me?

3
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,710
Starting immediately,

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:16,930
quit your job at the company.

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,980
Really, what are you afraid of

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,810
that you're even giving me money.

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,430
Afraid of what?

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,210
Anyway, what's there to be afraid of?

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,530
My Joo Ri,

10
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,710
because of you, she going crazy

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,960
She told me she couldn't work at the company.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,910
That's why I'm giving you the money.

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,930
Who is that?

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,480
Isn't that Joo-ri's Mother?

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,640
It seems like you want to shut me up with this money.

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,690
I'm sorry, but this won't do.

17
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,280
Have you even counted carefully how many zeros there are?

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,250
It's not 5,000 won. It's 500 million won, 500 million.

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,870
Merely 500 million?

20
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,310
So you're trying to keep my mouth shut with the mere 500 million.

21
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,630
It might be different if it's 5 billion!

22
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,260
This won't do.

23
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,370
I'll never quit my job!

24
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,130
You are Joo Ri's mother, right?

25
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,160
Is something wrong?

26
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,850
They say you should not take care of someone else's child.

27
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,140
In the end, I get this kind of treatment.

28
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,690
Why are you being like this? Who was that woman?

29
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:35,130
She's my daughter-in-law. To be precise,

30
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,050
she was my daughter-in-law.

31
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,100
Daughter-in-law?

32
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,200
Aioo... Aioo... Aioo...

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,600
Do you feel a little calmer now?

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,680
Aioo... Since I had something refreshing...

35
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,960
I can think a little clearly.

36
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,800
If you don't mind, may I ask what it was about?

37
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,500
You saw everything, so there's nothing to hide.

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,570
I told you Joo Ri has an older brother, right?

39
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,310
He's so kind and innocent. Really, in this world,

40
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,430
-there is no one like him.
-I see...

41
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,850
But, he met the wrong woman.

42
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:36,220
She's very vain, and she has a complicated history with men.

43
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,260
They parted after 3 years of marriage.

44
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,950
Then, that... woman...

45
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,010
Yes. You're right.

46
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,500
But, what made you to...

47
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,870
Aigoo... Really, I don't know what kind of unfortunate fate this is...

48
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,870
She got divorced and found a job... out of all places

49
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,570
My company, isn't it?

50
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:10,150
My Joo Ri is so calm and gentle

51
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,580
The difference in their style is so great

52
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,090
Even when living with her brother

53
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,310
Joo Ri used to despised her sister-in-law.

54
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,860
So,

55
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:30,060
it seems like she is very uncomfortable to work at the same company.

56
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,430
Of course. So,

57
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,590
I asked if she could move to a different company

58
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,020
I asked so nicely, yet

59
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,050
she asked for 5 billion.

60
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,900
Oh my God!

61
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,340
What kind of department

62
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,610
is she in, and what is her name?

63
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,560
No, it's fine.

64
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,110
I do business, too, but

65
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,820
Important people shouldn't

66
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,830
Be involved in private matters like this.

67
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,870
Please act like you didn't hear a word I said today.

68
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,630
Ice water!

69
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,310
What's the reason why you didn't take the money?

70
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,850
I already told your mother.

71
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,410
That I'll quit if I get 5 billion.

72
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,920
How are you so confident?

73
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,520
Is there any reason why I shouldn't be confident?

74
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,260
To be honest, aren't the unconfident ones you and your mother?

75
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,300
What's the real reason why you won't quit?

76
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,250
You think you found our weaknesses, right?

77
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,720
Because you were wrongfully treated at our house,

78
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:48,710
do you want to take revenge now?

79
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,170
do you want to take revenge now?

80
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,040
I have no such interest, so just go and do your work

81
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,240
Can you leave your work like this during your duty hours?

82
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,160
It's not because he's my son-in-law

83
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,310
But this type of man is hard to find nowadays.

84
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:28,010
He is kind, hard working, good provider, and healthy.

85
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:33,890
If only he gets married, as the kids say these days, you got a real catch!

86
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,430
Please stop, mother-in-law.

87
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:43,180
I will guarantee about my son-in-law by stamping with a seal.

88
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,150
Don't worry too much, okay?

89
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:50,030
Let's leave these two to talk.

90
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,840
Yes, of course! I know when to leave, too.

91
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,520
You youngsters should enjoy yourselves.

92
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,890
Son-in-law Min, have a good time.

93
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,130
And I'll pay for the coffee.

94
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,000
I have money, too, mother-in-law.

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,280
I'm not giving it to you because you don't have it.

96
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,520
Then I'll see you soon.

97
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,700
Let's get going.

98
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,710
Aigoo, they're filming a movie.

99
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,860
This is what you call a nice-looking man and woman.

100
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,840
It seems like you get on well with your mother-in-law

101
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,300
Ah, yes.

102
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,840
When i heard that you lived with her for almost 30 years after your wife's death

103
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,560
I was really touched

104
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,480
I really wanted to meet you.

105
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,630
I'm flattered.

106
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:10,640
I have to go to the toilet, excuse me.

107
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,860
Chun...chunhee ssi

108
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,390
Bad guy

109
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:30,050
Chunhee ssi, this is a misunderstanding

110
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,080
Chunhee, chunhee!

111
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,290
Hyodong ssi!

112
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,050
Chunhee ssi!

113
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,400
Let's talk somewhere else. Please don't misunderstand.

114
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,620
Misunderstanding? I saw it with my own eyes

115
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,830
I understand that it could be misunderstood.

116
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,250
I had the blind date today because...

117
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,130
What are you doing?

118
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,850
I was a fool to trust a guy like you

119
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,780
I'm a fool

120
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,530
Chunhee, listen to what i have to say!

121
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,280
Lunch time already has passed and she isn't here yet

122
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,900
I'm going crazy

123
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,790
Isn't this too much?

124
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,140
How could you take care of a patient like this?

125
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,580
I'm not in the mood right now, so don't talk to me

126
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,520
CAN'T YOU STOP THERE?

127
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,150
Who are you telling to stop?! Who are you to give me an order?

128
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,480
Without hearing about my situation, why did you hit me first?

129
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,120
I have my reasons

130
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,640
What reasons? Looked like you really liked her

131
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,940
It's nothing like that. For now, apologize first.

132
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,390
Apologize?

133
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,190
For hitting me!

134
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,310
If i hit you it was because you deserved it. Why should i apologize?

135
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,300
There's no reason for hitting me!

136
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,280
I never knew you were this kind of person

137
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,430
You met that woman in front of my eyes... and there's no reason to get hit?

138
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,800
Utility Pole! Did you have a blind date?!

139
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,770
How it was arranged, why I had to go,

140
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,750
you didn't even hear my reasons, and you just slapped me!

141
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,570
Weren't you too rash?!

142
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,620
Madam Yang, did you slap him?

143
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:26,540
That's enough. Starting today, I stopped having feelings for you, so

144
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,330
let's live our lives pretending not to know each other from now on.

145
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:36,020
Fine. Women who are violent with hot temper like you...

146
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,360
I'm sick of them too!

147
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,470
Why are you guys being like this, really?! Aren't you too uncivilized?

148
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,480
Okay! That's the end of the story then!

149
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,780
Let's finish our relationship with this!

150
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,410
Fine with me!

151
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,130
Oh, these people. No matter how mad you are

152
00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:00,810
How could you break up so easily? Let's calm down and talk it over.

153
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:07,540
The time we spent together was very pleasant. Good bye, Min Hyo Dong-ssi.

154
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,700
Hey, Madam Yang! Madam Yang! Won't you go after her?

155
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:17,230
It was pleasant for me, as well. Good bye, Yang Chun Hee-ssi!

156
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,060
This is wrong. No matter how angry you're, this is wrong.

157
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,980
You have feelings for each other, you shouldn't talk about breaking up that easily!

158
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,420
MOVE!

159
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,810
What kind of situation is this? Why are you like this?

160
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:41,080
Instead of pork, let's go to eat duck meat

161
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,550
But we already told Nutritionist Min we were going to the pork restaurant

162
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,380
You guys are going out tonight?

163
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:46,900
Omo...

164
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,590
Hello

165
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:53,660
Yes. We have a new employee and since we've been busy we've not gone out in a while.

166
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,820
don't say that. It just makes me feel hungry

167
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,230
Where should we go for dinner tonight?

168
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,630
How about pork rinds?

169
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,510
Pork rinds?

170
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,160
You don't like them?

171
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,660
No, no, no

172
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,690
You know how to eat that kind of stuff?

173
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,400
I really like them a lot.

174
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,580
Let's go.

175
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,840
Yes

176
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,050
Cheers!

177
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,620
I really didn't know you'd like pork rinds?

178
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,290
This is really strange right?

179
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,650
Honestly, this is my first time.

180
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,600
Before you said you really like them a lot.

181
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,730
The meeting was not too comfortable. Instead of being too formal,

182
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,500
I thought eating comfortably at a place like this would be nice.

183
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,200
This is acceptable, right?

184
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,360
It's alright by me.

185
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,010
Why don't you order?

186
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,860
Yes

187
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,810
I'm sorry I'm late.

188
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,410
We already had a round of drinks.

189
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,490
Here.

190
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,490
In one shot, drink all of it.

191
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,520
One shot. One shot.

192
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,210
Woah!

193
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,570
Here, why don't you have a drink?

194
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,310
I'm sorry, but I don't think I should drink tonight.

195
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,810
What might be the issue?

196
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,610
Ah,

197
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,290
It's that I have an appointment. Here, why don't I pour you a drink?

198
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,430
Wow, you drink well

199
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,100
Drinking almost at the speed of light.

200
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,290
Yes!

201
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,900
Dinner is ready

202
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,790
My mouth is very bitter..

203
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,630
Ahjumma, make some nurungji

204
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,060
Yes

205
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,900
Aioo... Push your lips back. You're pouting too much.

206
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,980
I can't live because of you!

207
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,080
that's right. it's all my fault

208
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,790
What're you going to do now?
Now that zero said she won't quit the company!

209
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,630
Even if it wasn't for her,

210
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,770
It's only a matter of time before the truth comes out.

211
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,030
Then why did you do that?

212
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,630
Did i know this would happen?

213
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,840
What're you going to do now?

214
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,270
First, his mother...

215
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,690
I'll take care of her

216
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,940
Her mother already acknowledges you as her Daughter-in-law. Now, just get married.

217
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,850
Sunbae looks like a mama boy?

218
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,690
What?

219
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,180
Sunbae is not like that.

220
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,830
He's far from being a mama boy.

221
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,490
Hey, perhaps...

222
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,410
your sunbae...

223
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,840
with "that thing"...

224
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,090
Are they in that kind of realationship?

225
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,140
"that thing"?...

226
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,140
Are you talking about "Zero"?

227
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:36,560
It's just that I did everything I can

228
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,930
to bring those two together.

229
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,380
Don't talk no sense

230
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,540
Sunbae has such high standards. Someone like her...?

231
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,860
Mom, do you have dementia?!

232
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,300
Who do you think you're shouting to?

233
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,590
You drive me crazy.

234
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,970
Hey!

235
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,270
Don't tell anything to your brother

236
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,030
He'll make this bigger

237
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,710
Do you think I'm stupid?!

238
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,760
That..that

239
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,530
I can endure my father and my brothers looking down on me

240
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:37,190
But I can't put up with my mom, who gave me birth, being like that.

241
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:42,040
Anyway, I'm like a curse in my mom's forehead.

242
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,820
Please, take me out of there. I need your help.

243
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,860
You must have been lonely like me.

244
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,090
Your life is really pitiful too.

245
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,430
eat up guys

246
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,280
How come the meal tables are not full of people?

247
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,260
Chaewon said she had a meeting so she'll be late today.

248
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,390
It seems like Brother-in-law is doing well with his blind date.

249
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,080
Since he's not home yet.

250
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,290
She looked as kind as Buddha.

251
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,940
I could tell right away she is the mate for your brother-in-law.

252
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,180
It's already too late.

253
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,750
What do you mean?

254
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,030
Mom, really, would he leave a beautiful person like Madam Yang alone, and

255
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,210
get interested in someone who looks like Buddha?

256
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,840
I really don't know why Madam Yang, whatever,

257
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,140
is so pretty.

258
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,700
That's what I'd say. Maybe she would look pretty for 3 seconds.

259
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,570
You would get tired of her if you were to look at her constantly.

260
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,070
If I were a man, if I had a truck load of women like Madam Yang, I still wouldn't like it.

261
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,820
The worst nauseating style.

262
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,820
Right. She has the face for bad fortune.

263
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,740
Hello?

264
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,350
Yes.

265
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,680
One moment please.

266
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,330
They want to talk you, Grandma.

267
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,060
Me?

268
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,640
I'm on the phone.

269
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,990
yes yeah min jung omma

270
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,950
son in law min hasn't come home yet

271
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,570
what do you mean by that?

272
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,740
Huh?

273
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,750
He left in the middle of his arranged date and didn't return?

274
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,550
Yes.

275
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,830
Ok, I understand.

276
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:50,330
When my son-in-law returns, I'll find out what happened and will give you a call.

277
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,870
So let's wait a little and see.

278
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,290
Ok.

279
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,950
Brother-in-law disappeared while he was on his blind date, Mom?

280
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:01,090
That's what they said. I really don't know what's going on.

281
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,920
What else can it be?

282
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,740
He went out because of you.

283
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,710
But in his heart, he only has Madame Yang only.

284
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,280
Bo Reum's mother...

285
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,180
Go and bring me a needle and thread.

286
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,330
Why do you need a needle and thread, while we're eating dinner?

287
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,120
I want to sew your husbands's mouth shut. Why?

288
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,200
I'm so upset, really...

289
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,900
Where are you going while we're eating?

290
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,700
Obviously, he'd be at the cafe or whatever, so I have to bring him back.

291
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,990
I'll come with you, mom.

292
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,690
Me too.

293
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,920
I'm home.

294
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,980
Where did you just come from?

295
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,140
I'm a bit tired, so I'll go in and rest.

296
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,010
But, what's up with him...?

297
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,870
Let him go.

298
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,790
He probably has a headache, so let him rest.

299
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:26,770
from today on I will forget you

300
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:30,040
<i>From now on, let's pretend that we don't know each other.</i>

301
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,760
<i>That's fine! Women who are</i>

302
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,750
<i>violent and have hot temper like you... I'm sick of them!</i>

303
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,340
Even if all the men in the world change,

304
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,950
I thought Utility Pole Oppa would never change.

305
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,220
He's not that great.

306
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,470
man are all the same

307
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:15,090
Shit.

308
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,150
I mean,

309
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,470
it's not I'm caught between two fires,

310
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,900
so they were fine before why the fighting now?

311
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,020
I'm so starving.

312
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,800
Hey!

313
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,140
Lesson teacher.

314
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,870
Why're you here?

315
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,110
I've been solving my dinner these last few days.I can't cook with my hand like this.

316
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,740
But what about you?

317
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,560
My nephew wants to eat crackers.

318
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,030
Hello.

319
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,050
My second older brother's son.

320
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,310
You look exactly like your dad.

321
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,590
Pick out something you want to eat.

322
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,090
Yes, aunt.

323
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,720
Is your brother-in-law at home right now?

324
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,700
Yes, he came a little while ago.

325
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,650
Wait.

326
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,350
Don't call him.

327
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,700
Completely low right now.

328
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,740
Madame Yang has her shop closed too.

329
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,760
What is with those two?

330
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,210
Do they really love each other?

331
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,360
Why are you ticking your tongue?

332
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,860
A prune like you will never understand it.

333
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:24,340
What do you think I am?

334
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,690
I'd have a son as old as Bo Reum had I not failed at my first love.

335
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,190
First love?

336
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,710
You even have something like that?

337
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,790
Of course I do!

338
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,590
The time, 20 years ago.

339
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:02,640
I was playing Mozart's sonata at the competition.

340
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:06,650
I forgot the notes by mistake.

341
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:23,640
He handed me a handkerchief,

342
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,030
"student, your recital,

343
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,480
is sincere."

344
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:37,080
"What matters more than technique is the heart of the musician."

345
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:42,770
"Student, you have that sincerity."

346
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,710
He was a vocalist who was sitting among the judges.

347
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,610
But he followed me because he was worried about me.

348
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,970
Isn't he someone so tender?

349
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:03,230
And romantic.

350
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:11,270
He was a new talent who received international awards.

351
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:15,070
He'd reply back now and then when I wrote him fan-letters.

352
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,960
But he started to keep his location hidden.

353
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,440
And my letters came back undelivered.

354
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:30,130
Where did he go when I was talking here?

355
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,840
He has no tear-drop of manner!

356
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,860
Aunt, I'm all done.

357
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,150
Okay, let's go.

358
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,690
Add the cup ramen and two triangle seaweed rolls, it's $5 dollars total.

359
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,520
Cup ramen and triangle seaweed roll?

360
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,350
The person you were with said you would pay together.

361
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,270
I beg your pardon!

362
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,010
I'll enjoy it !

363
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,980
That man has no consicience!

364
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,420
You have to pay, customer!

365
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:02,230
This is really pissing me off.

366
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,970
I thought you wouldn't drink and be all coy.

367
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,690
You are different than you look.

368
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,400
Coy?

369
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:17,200
That's definitely not it.

370
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,280
You seem drunk, will you be okay?

371
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,730
This is my welcome party to the company.

372
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,980
The protagonist can't sit out.

373
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,610
I will accept fully.

374
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:35,710
You are such a breeze.

375
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,020
Manager, don't hate me now.

376
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:49,940
I know I still need to work on stuff but I will work hard! Allegience pledged.

377
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,270
When did I ever say I hated her?

378
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,810
Since we're in the same direction,

379
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,430
we can just get in one taxi.

380
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,940
What about Chae Won though?

381
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,570
No worries.

382
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:19,190
I can get home fine.

383
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,100
Please go first.

384
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,150
You seem really drunk.

385
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,940
We'll go after you leave.

386
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,900
Yeah, let's do that.

387
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,750
You can't!

388
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:34,020
I'm the newest hire so in no way can I go first.

389
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,950
That's mutiny.

390
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,730
You go first, seniors.

391
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,440
Are you sure you're going to be alright?

392
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,870
I'm fine.

393
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,860
No problem!

394
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,520
Taxi!

395
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,770
Taxi, taxi.

396
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,330
Hurry and get in, seniors.

397
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,560
Are you sure you'll be alright?

398
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,520
I'm fine. No problems!

399
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,810
Go safely!

400
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,940
Yes.

401
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:06,010
See you tomorrow morning.

402
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,760
Go safely.

403
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,940
Go home safely, seniors.

404
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,870
I should go home too.

405
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:42,170
This is too good to watch by myself.

406
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:51,630
Who are you again?

407
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,230
You drank everything they offered you.

408
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,490
I see that your wits are out.

409
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,940
Captain Hong!

410
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,750
Who's Captain Hong?

411
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:07,430
You didn't see the movie? "No matter what happens to who and where or when."

412
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:12,420
The one who will appear, Captain Hong.

413
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:20,230
You always appear whenever I'm in trouble.

414
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:23,010
Oh, you're not Captain Hong.

415
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,400
You're Captain Lee!

416
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,580
Enough drunk drama. I'll send you home so get in.

417
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,940
Yes, Captain Lee!

418
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,480
I am okay!

419
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,480
No problem.

420
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,250
What no problem?

421
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,660
You look full of problems.

422
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,330
Joori.

423
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,050
Hello?

424
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,230
She's doing all sorts of stuff.

425
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:18,390
Dad, I just finished the party and I'm coming home.

426
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,640
I got in the cab so I should be home soon.

427
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,810
Don't worry and sleep well.

428
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,910
A formidable foe.

429
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,460
I'll hold the flashlight up,

430
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,820
so you switch our noodles with your brother's.

431
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,310
Ack,

432
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,290
this is robbery.

433
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,230
You didnt' see it in the movies and dramas?

434
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,650
People do more extreme stuff than this to win.

435
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,100
We're talking 10 million here!

436
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,350
I got it.

437
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,200
I got it, I said!

438
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,680
Anyone home?

439
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,830
Oh my.

440
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,790
Who's this?

441
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,690
Se Yoon, right?

442
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:58,760
It's me, Aunt Dohee.

443
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,120
Oh, hello.

444
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,980
Yup.

445
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,110
Director Kim.

446
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,740
Hello.

447
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,100
But what are you doing here?

448
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,890
I'm Chae Won's aunt, and he's her uncle.

449
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:11,770
You are?

450
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:16,300
But why is she so wasted?

451
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,120
How come you're taking our Chae Won home?

452
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,240
We had a company dinner party tonight.

453
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,790
Miss Min Chae Won drank a lot.

454
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:30,060
I had an errand to run around here so it was on my way.

455
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,350
Everyone fine with your family? Your mom?

456
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,340
Of course.

457
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,340
You came all the way here, so come in for some tea.

458
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,550
No, it's alright. It's late so I'll be going.

459
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,610
Then, goodnight.

460
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,540
That smells.

461
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,610
What smells?

462
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:57,600
Not like they're in the same department and Chae Won just started. For him to drive her home already?

463
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,070
Something definitely smells a bit here.

464
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:05,550
There you go again with the nonsense. Come on.

465
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,160
Is it still too early?

466
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,690
What's that?

467
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:51,650
"Thank you for driving me home yesterday."

468
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,710
"Enjoy this soup. Min Chae won."

469
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:59,650
Sunbae took her home?

470
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:08,410
Are they in that kind of relationship?

471
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:10,780
What's this?

472
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:16,480
As mom said, is she trying to seduce him?

473
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,210
You came early.

474
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,270
Have this coffee for a hangover.

475
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:30,900
I thought you might had a drink with people from work last night.

476
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,650
Thank you.

477
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:02,500
From now, the judging starts.

478
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,940
Starting from Uhm Gi Ok

479
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,960
Yes, father.

480
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,350
You chose well the flour, but not the salt.

481
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:27,180
The flavor's weak and you used refined salt that is not good for the health.

482
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:31,220
The shape did not form well either.

483
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,490
The noodle's missing a pure taste.

484
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,830
40 points.

485
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:41,240
40 points? Aren't you being unfair father?

486
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,830
Conclude.

487
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,940
It's our turn, father

488
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,310
"Uhm Gi Chun"

489
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,240
What happens, father?

490
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,850
These are your noodles?

491
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:08,360
Obviously! My name is there, father.

492
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,960
It's ours, father-in-law!

493
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:32,320
Although the flour wasn't the right one.

494
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,970
Your combination of hard and soft flour was good.

495
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:39,890
And the taste wasn't bad.

496
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:43,580
It was good that you used sea salt

497
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,840
that is full of minerals.

498
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:50,640
Above everything, your noodles had a good chew.

499
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,570
Thought not perfect, among the three ...

500
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,760
These are the best noddles.

501
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,340
Yay

502
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,900
Thanks, father-in-law!

503
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,070
Their noodles scored highest?

504
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,820
This is someone screwing us.

505
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,280
I know.

506
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,080
They were the worst before.

507
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,940
Father, are you sure you didn't make a mistake?

508
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,530
What do you mean by that?

509
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:16,580
You're disregarding father-in-law's capability?

510
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,110
We'll work harder, father-in-law!

511
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,030
Thank you

512
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,280
Noddles are like your childs.

513
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,680
If the parents are going to change their child just because he's ugly

514
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,480
what parents,

515
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,700
would just sit and let their children be stolen?

516
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,770
On that, eldest child, Um Gi Moon, who stole the noodles,

517
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:51,390
is kicked out of this round and disqualifies for next round of competition as well.

518
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,340
What are you saying, father-in-law?

519
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:57,030
You should know what I'm saying better than anybody.

520
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:05,150
And second son, Um Gi Joon, who doesn't even realize he was robbed,

521
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,390
gets zero points.

522
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,420
So what is this?

523
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:15,610
You swtiched our noodles?

524
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,960
What the hell?

525
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,200
I know people steal from each other in this world,

526
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,560
but your own brother? How could you?

527
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,300
You can't give us zero points for it! We're victims.

528
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,590
Conclude.

529
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,900
Wait.

530
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,930
So I'm first place.

531
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,210
Hyung!

532
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:40,300
Isn't this too much?

533
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,500
I'm sorry.

534
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,340
I told you not to do it.

535
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,740
Father-in-law is so sharp.

536
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,390
Sorry about it.

537
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,590
Sorry, sister-in-law.

538
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:54,150
How can you switch them even if you have no conscience?

539
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,460
Don't you think you are playing too dirty?

540
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,540
Sorry, sister-in-law.

541
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,300
I have no justfication.

542
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,230
Getting zero ponits for doing nothing wrong!

543
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,990
This is so unfair!

544
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,330
We cant' win.

545
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,260
Geesh!

546
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,700
I was harsh yesterday.

547
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,990
Forgive me for hurting your feelings.

548
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,900
Flowers to make up.

549
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,790
Let's make up now.

550
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,720
Leasing out?

551
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,680
Isn't that too extreme?

552
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:56,320
I can empty out the store by the end of the week.

553
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,990
So if you like it, you should sign the lease.

554
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:03,840
We're leasing it out cheap because she has to leave for the U.S. suddenly.

555
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,270
It's hard to find a shop like this at this price.

556
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,730
U.S.?

557
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,300
Going?

558
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,890
We'll come back after thinking about it a little.

559
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,080
Then, please come by when you've thought about it.

560
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,870
Bye now.

561
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,830
Didn't you see the notice?

562
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,900
I am not in business anymore.

563
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,360
You're going back to America?

564
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,850
Without a word with me? How could you?

565
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:43,640
How funny. Why would I discuss with you about leaving?

566
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,020
No matter how hurt and disappointed you are with me,

567
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,210
don't you think this is too extreme?

568
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,030
Forget it.

569
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:54,700
I made up my mind without any concern to you.

570
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,730
So don't try to involve yourself.

571
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,150
I got it.

572
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:03,060
Go to America or to China.

573
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,350
Do as you please.

574
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:16,040
What? He should be begging me not to go.

575
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,580
But "do as you please" he says?

576
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:24,510
Seriously?! Isn't he being too much!

577
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,920
Utility Pole, you should back down first.

578
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,920
Kneel and put your hands together and beg.

579
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,390
Forget it. She will do as she pleases.

580
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:51,120
I have no wish for a woman like her!

581
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,200
It's not the time to think of your pride!

582
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,320
Forget everything!

583
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,010
This is bloody.

584
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,010
Geesh.

585
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:08,130
What do I do about my lunch?

586
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,270
A madame newly moving in?

587
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,440
Killer style.

588
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,240
For lease.

589
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,600
What is it now?

590
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,910
Choon-hee!

591
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,590
Oh, unnie!

592
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,190
What brings you here with a call?

593
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:47,880
The help made seafood kimchi and I thought of you so I brought you some.

594
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,950
Wow.

595
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,830
You don't need to.

596
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,140
Thank you.

597
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,680
First, sit down.

598
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,570
As I was coming in,

599
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,370
I saw the for lease sign.

600
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:12,160
This is a good alley and the deposit is low so I think it will be leased out soon.

601
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,830
You've made up your mind to go back then?

602
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,880
Yup.

603
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,820
There's nothing good for me here.

604
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,190
So I plan to leave as soon as the shop gets leased.

605
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,350
Is there anything I can help you with?

606
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:30,550
Just seeing your face again after 30 years is plenty.

607
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:33,390
What more would I wish for?

608
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,860
I'm sorry Choon-hee

609
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,640
I'm really sorry.

610
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,690
Why are you always sorry to me?

611
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:45,310
Just.

612
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:48,260
Everything. About everything.

613
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:48,250
No, unnie.

614
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,900
No, unnie.

615
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,400
30 years ago,

616
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,370
when I was roaming around like a crazy woman.

617
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,870
If you weren't by my side then,

618
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:04,810
I wouldn't be able to be here right now.

619
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:07,440
I would've died then.

620
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,410
I'm only alive now because of you.

621
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,290
That only

622
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:18,000
makes you my life's savior.

623
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,550
For getting mad at you when I didn't mean to,

624
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,850
I'm sorry, Unni.

625
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:26,320
Forgive me, okay?

626
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,370
What forgive.

627
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,310
Why do you say such a thing?

628
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,630
Hello!

629
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,460
Isn't this too much?

630
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,250
What?

631
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,890
I dropped you at home when you were drunk

632
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:59,590
Then shouldn't you at least send a 'thank you' text message?

633
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:03,730
Anyway, I heard from my aunt that you dropped me off.

634
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:05,610
Thank you.

635
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,460
That's why I left a note and pollock soup in the morning.

636
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,540
Pollock soup?

637
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:15,090
In a thermos, I left it on your desk. You didn't see it?

638
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,960
I didn't see it.

639
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,470
Did assistant yoon take it?

640
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:22,670
So Lee Seyoon ssi, i mean, Director Lee

641
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:26,920
did you also have a get-together at the pork rind place?

642
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,310
Yes...

643
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:32,570
I guess that place is our company's get-together spot.

644
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:37,030
Did I perhaps make any mistake yesterday?

645
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:41,280
As I take after my dad, i'm not good at at drinking

646
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,270
Why are you laughing?

647
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,740
Did I make a mistake somewhere?

648
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,610
No, you didn't.

649
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:49,170
If I didn't, why are you laughing?

650
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:51,150
What is it? Oh, I did make a mistake.

651
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:54,170
There isn't anything like that.

652
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,370
You created a website?

653
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,210
Yes.

654
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:05,640
I can put out the menu early and get requests and reviews on tastes.

655
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,300
That's a good idea.

656
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:12,380
'Idea Bank' has always been my nickname.

657
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,950
Drunk drama and now, self-flattering.

658
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,580
A formidable foe.

659
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,140
Drunk drama?

660
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:21,370
What..

661
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:25,550
I did something while I was drunk right?

662
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,710
What are those two doing?

663
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:38,190
That 'ding' ...

664
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:41,240
I seriously can't just leave her be.

665
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:50,470
You were probably shocked to hear me talking about setting the wedding date so soon.

666
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:53,740
Well a wedding is a life's big event.

667
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:57,520
It's not like picking out beans to eat.

668
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,420
I thought maybe we're rushing it.

669
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,490
To have the bride's side rush the wedding,

670
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:11,030
may have people wondering if the bride's got a flaw.

671
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:12,370
No!

672
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:16,720
What do you mean flaw? Not at all.

673
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,070
That's right...

674
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:23,460
Who'd dare to say such a thing about the precious daughter of one of the greatest families of Korea.

675
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,160
Well,

676
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:30,050
not quite 'dare' though.

677
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:33,000
You probably heard from Mz. Go,

678
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,820
my father-in-law's very ill.

679
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,600
The hospital also said to prepare our hearts.

680
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,000
That was quite a while ago too.

681
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,220
Yes.

682
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:47,700
We are a family who respects traditions and conventions.

683
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:54,240
So if he passes away, our daughter can't marry for 3 years.

684
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,970
As the mother of a daughter of some age, I'm in a rush.

685
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:02,330
Yes that must be..

686
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:04,570
I understand.

687
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,790
My mom should be

688
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:18,510
meeting your mom, trying to rush the wedding using my grandpa as excuse.

689
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:21,670
I wonder if her scheme's working out well.

690
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,450
You talk like it's about someone else.

691
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:25,920
I don't get along with my mom.

692
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,510
I'm not exactly on great terms with my mom either.

693
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:31,950
The rumors have you as a devoted son though.

694
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:36,070
Not devoted son, but a mamaboy, I bet.

695
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,200
Yup.

696
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:42,610
The biggest mamaboy of the century.

697
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:44,730
That's what they say.

698
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:47,450
I like your honesty.

699
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:49,640
My mom's no easy cake.

700
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,700
She's going to bully you if you ever marry me.

701
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:02,920
You will marry me?

702
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:09,410
I'll answer you after I asked someone about it.

703
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:13,290
Who are you going to ask about your own marriage?

704
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:16,300
Do you believe in fortune tellers?

705
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,910
A great couple.

706
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,370
Oh my.

707
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:36,910
The weather's still cold. Aren't your hands chilly?

708
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,400
I'm fine.

709
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,660
Oh my. See how demure and graceful you are.

710
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,340
You're not like the other misses of these days.

711
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:51,170
It looks like you really like your daughter-in-law-to-be.

712
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:53,690
Of course.

713
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:58,910
What took you so long to come to us finally?

714
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:03,710
Oh my see how pretty her smile is too.

715
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:09,370
Don't be my daughter-in-law. Be my daughter instead.

716
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,610
Long time no see

717
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:36,910
What again?

718
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:37,600
Let's talk.

719
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,120
I've told you. I don't have anything to talk about with you.

720
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:45,620
Today is really the last time.

721
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:54,350
For the last time. A real final time,

722
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:57,340
I have to decide something after meeting you so I came.

723
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:01,050
Just give me 10 minutes to talk with you.

724
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:05,590
Quickly say it If you have anything to say

725
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:07,380
My family's waiting for me at home.

726
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:12,410
They're all good, right? Father-in-law too.

727
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,120
He's not your father-in-law anymore.

728
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,150
You don't need to be so precise.

729
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,000
I know.

730
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,590
What did you need to say?

731
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:28,980
A few days ago, I went on a marriage meeting.

732
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:32,880
My mom really likes the woman.

733
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,020
That's good.

734
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:37,800
The parents are the two sides are rushing the wedding.

735
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:43,950
So they're saying to set a wedding date soon.

736
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:46,200
Congrats!

737
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,410
I wanted...

738
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:54,590
to ask you something for the last time.

739
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,680
What do you want to ask?

740
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,920
We...

741
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:02,160
Can't we start again?

742
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,920
Are we really over?

743
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,330
I already told you.

744
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:08,420
We are over.

745
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:11,250
You may have ended it

746
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,580
But i didn't.

747
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:20,080
If there's a thread of hope left.

748
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,150
I want to grab onto it.

749
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:28,430
I want to start again.

750
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:35,780
I really can't send you away.

751
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,880
Our fate's finished.

752
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,000
It's over now.

753
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,530
You did all you could.

754
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:58,340
You begged, you threatened, and you clang on pitifully.

755
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:01,870
But still, I won't ever come back to you.

756
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:07,790
I'm sorry, but the more you're like this, the scarier to me.

757
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:10,040
I see.

758
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:19,540
I see.

759
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:24,790
Now that you met a new woman, start again.

760
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:28,950
Luckily, your mother likes her.

761
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:28,960
So you'll be able to live happily
Luckily, your mother likes her.

762
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:36,770
So you'll be able to live happily

763
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:42,430
So, this is really the end?

764
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:47,080
It's the end.

765
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:54,750
Okay.

766
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,550
I won't look for you again.

767
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,440
Then please leave.

768
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,930
Wait a minute.

769
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:13,630
Because it's the last time.

770
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:20,180
Really the last time.

771
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,610
You have to live well.

772
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:42,880
Go!

773
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,870
I'm leaving.

774
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:12,090
What did I tell you?!

775
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:16,580
Changing the noodles is stealing!

776
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:18,540
Only if you had chosen well the materials...

777
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,300
I wouldn't have thought of doing this.

778
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,740
So it's all my fault?

779
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:25,160
No matter how much i think about it...

780
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,330
it's like that

781
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:31,280
I'd rather come in last than lose the right to participate in the next competition.

782
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,890
I told that Seul Rong to come back to the country so long ago. But where the heck is he?

783
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:37,510
Would that shape us any better anyway?

784
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:40,320
It's be better to have an extra brain.

785
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,250
Yo whats up mom

786
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:49,830
HEY!

787
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:51,690
COME HOME RIGHT NOW!

788
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:57,710
I think this is to unfair father-in-law

789
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:00,560
Give us at least 20 points

790
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:05,170
We worked really hard on those noodles and we got 0 points.

791
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:08,990
And frankly, we weren't the ones who stole the noodles.

792
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:12,410
But what can we do when someone steals them?

793
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:16,360
The old saying goes, 10 people can't fight 1 robber.

794
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,240
No need to waste time talking about what's already done.

795
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,270
Just prepare for the next challenge.

796
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:27,910
Then Father-in-law, given this situation

797
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:30,120
Give us a hint please

798
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,320
I'm hungry. Are you almost done getting it ready?

799
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:39,860
Father-in-law, father-in-law!

800
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,650
He's screwing with us!

801
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:48,300
Why did sister-in-law pull us down too?

802
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,800
Calm down

803
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,680
Let's calm down

804
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:07,350
Uhm...

805
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:14,510
Dad, are you hurt anywhere?

806
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:16,710
No, I'm okay.

807
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:22,460
Grandma told me you were in your room all day.

808
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:27,530
Oh, i think you have fever.

809
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:31,900
Fever? What fever? I'm okay

810
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,050
Eat dinner now.

811
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:37,760
Because I was in bed all day

812
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,400
I haven't digested the lunch yet.

813
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,700
I have no appetite so you go out and eat first.

814
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:47,170
It's really weird.

815
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:49,120
Are you really not hurt anywhere?

816
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,200
I'm fine

817
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,700
Don't worry about me

818
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:58,990
And have dinner now, my princess.

819
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:04,910
Go to eat!

820
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:20,900
You're returning to America?

821
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,400
How can you do this?

822
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,590
I can decide this on my own

823
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,390
so, don't get in my way

824
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:37,830
How can she make that decision without telling me?

825
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:40,410
So that means that our love...

826
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:44,480
didn't mean anything

827
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:05,770
This is too much. If i'm telling him i'm going back to America

828
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:08,760
At least he should try to stop me

829
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,430
During all this time, did he really love me?

830
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:15,130
How can he be so cruel?

831
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:26,570
So were you with daughter-in-law all this time?

832
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:28,460
No.

833
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:32,480
Then if you didn't and you don't smell like alcohol...

834
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,880
Where were you till now?

835
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,040
I just had some things to think over.

836
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,000
So i went on a drive

837
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,060
What did you have to think?

838
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:49,790
Why don't you answer?

839
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:50,960
I'll do it

840
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,570
What thing?

841
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,100
Marriage.

842
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:57,410
I'll do it.

843
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:02,730
Really?

844
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:03,680
Yes.

845
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:10,230
Aigoo, finally

846
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:14,220
Do you like it that much?

847
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:18,430
Of course I do!

848
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:24,570
Manse manse!

849
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:27,250
Why are you so noisy?

850
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:32,050
Your brother says he's made a decision!

851
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,200
Decision?

852
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,260
He's marrying with Taesan Group's youngest daughter!

853
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:41,750
Really oppa?

854
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,480
Yes.

855
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,640
Aigoo, my Cheol Gyu

856
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,680
Yay

857
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,150
This is a dream come true

858
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:59,410
Joori, pinch me.

859
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,630
It's real life!

860
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,420
My mom is really excited, huh?

861
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,580
This is like winning the lottery.

862
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:16,090
My biggest lottery in my life.

863
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,820
Hurray!

864
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,650
Did something good happen?

865
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:30,530
I just received my pay.

866
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:33,580
Today must be pay day.
Congrats.

867
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:37,150
I can't remember the last paycheck I got from working.

868
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:40,870
It's like I accomplished something big and I feel full already without eating.

869
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:44,570
I feel like I became rich.

870
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:50,050
And when I think about how my dad's going to be happy, I feel so great, you know.

871
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:54,960
I have had him worried this whole time but now he can relax finally.

872
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,380
This is all thanks to you.

873
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:01,260
Are you only going to thank me in words?

874
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:05,080
I can't just say it in words.

875
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:08,960
Buy me something then.

876
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,410
My dinner appointment has been cancelled, you can buy me dinner

877
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:19,190
Oh, what can i do? I have a nutritionalists' meeting in Crystal hotel today

878
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,870
What? Aren't you making an excuse?

879
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:29,590
I can't today, but next time, I will treat you a grand,

880
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:33,350
no, two meals!

881
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:36,120
Sorry for today.

882
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:42,000
Wow!

883
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:48,150
There's nobody like you.

884
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:51,310
Thank you.

885
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:55,020
Did you have a nice dream last night?

886
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:01,410
What... what's that?

887
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:03,360
It's my dog Coco.

888
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,670
Why is this here?

889
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:10,200
He's a family member

890
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,970
Coco, say hi!

891
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:15,940
I..I don't like it.

892
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:20,750
It's okay.

893
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:23,090
Aigoo, aigoo.

894
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:25,520
Coco, where're you going?

895
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,570
Coco, where are you?

896
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:36,500
That girl, what is she doing?

897
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:42,580
Her mother-in-law fell and she goes after that dog?

898
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:47,620
Is she in her right mind or what?

899
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:11,500
Chae-won.

900
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:19,150
Coco, Coco where are you?

901
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:31,200
Cheol gyu ssi!

902
01:02:50,560 --> 01:03:10,910
