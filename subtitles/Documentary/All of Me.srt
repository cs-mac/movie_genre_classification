1
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:04,463
You took the part

2
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:08,425
That once was my heart

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,596
So why not Take all of me?

4
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:19,895
One-two-three-four.

5
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,628
Take it, Roger.

6
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:33,070
Ok, Dog.

7
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,259
Oh, God!

8
00:02:56,218 --> 00:03:00,472
Happy birthday, my darling. Oh!

9
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,434
So how does it feel to be 38?
-Oh, great.

10
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,605
Just think, in 2 years I'll be 40,
in 12 years I'll be 50.

11
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,985
I'm really excited about this...
It's fun.

12
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,947
Oh, sweetie!
-Hey, what am I doin' with my life?

13
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:21,118
What am I doin' with my career?
What am I doin' with us?

14
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,580
You're boring us.
-Yeah!

15
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:31,044
Do you love it?
It's an African grave post.

16
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,173
Is that gorgeous?

17
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:38,760
You bought me a 'grave post'
for my 38. birthday?

18
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:43,849
Look, I'm sorry. I like it... really.
Look, uh, I've been thinkin'.

19
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:48,437
Remember that thing you used
to wanna talk about and I never did?

20
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,899
You know, uh, the 'M' word?

21
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:56,069
Well... I think maybe it's time
that we did the 'M' word.

22
00:03:56,153 --> 00:04:00,240
Roger, I don't think your're ready
to do the 'M' word.

23
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:05,120
Yeah, I am, honest.
Peggy, I wanna get 'M'd'.

24
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,917
Roger, if you can't say the 'M' word
then you're not ready

25
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:14,087
to do the 'M' word.
-I can say the 'M' word. Geez!

26
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:21,178
Ma... marriage, marriage, of course,
I can say it. What do you think?

27
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:25,349
We shouldn't get into this right now.
You're gonna be late for work

28
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:29,645
and you know how daddy hates that.
I just came by to wish you

29
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:34,233
a happy, happy 38.
-That's a contradiction in terms.

30
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:56,964
That was very bodacious.
Hey, Roger Dodger, what it is?

31
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,967
Hey, Bix!

32
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,972
You makin' any money today?
-A1most as much as I made last night.

33
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:09,142
That bad, huh?
-Yeah. Look, Roger, I've been thinkin'

34
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:12,813
o' joinin' Jimmy Bowers' Big Band.
I want you to come and go with me.

35
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:16,984
Oh, I appreciate it, Ty, but...
-No, don't give me that, but jive.

36
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:21,238
Hey, look at this face.
-I'm quitting the group, Ty.

37
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:25,200
You're doin' what?
-I gotta give up something.

38
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,371
I still have time to make something of
myself as a lawyer, not as a musician.

39
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:33,125
Oh, this is an unhappy face.

40
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,296
It's not that unhappy.
-Hey, this is the face of a man

41
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:41,466
who has givven up the wrong thing!
-Don't pick my nose, ok?

42
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:45,637
And if you don't correct your thinking
I shall be force to tell the world

43
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,808
that you are a Honky Mook!
-Tyrone, you really should not call

44
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,478
another person a Honky Mook.
-And why not?

45
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,690
Well, for one reason, you're white.
-I am?

46
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,775
Yeah!

47
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,328
Oh, my God, I am.
-I'm late, Ty, I gotta go.

48
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:13,707
I'm doing the right thing, really.
-Be cool! Good jammin' with you, Bix.

49
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,059
Well?

50
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:36,855
Well, you're dying all right.
-Ever since I was a child doctors have

51
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:40,692
been telling me I'm dying.
-I guess you've had enough practice,

52
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:45,197
because you're really doing it now.
-How much time?

53
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,825
A week, a day...
-A month?

54
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,911
M'mhm.

55
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,998
Good. The phone.

56
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:03,423
Got a cigarette? It can't hurt now.
-You don't smoke.

57
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:12,391
Thank you.

58
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,979
After 32 years of marriage you're
still a naughty little devil!

59
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:23,026
Pick up. Maybe it's your wife.
-Oh, ever since she filed for divorce

60
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:26,488
she hardly ever calls any more.

61
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,951
I'm sorry, Mr. Schuyler,
but Edwina Cutwater is on 1.

62
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:35,330
Oh, God. All right.
-It's ok.

63
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:39,626
I just wanted to tell you
your wife subpoenaed me.

64
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,006
Oh, Gretch, I am so sorry about that.

65
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:48,177
I do have to take this call.
-Oh!

66
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:54,308
Good morning, Margo.
-Good morning, Roger. Morning, Bix.

67
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:58,687
Any good ones for me today? Unfairly
victed tenants, farm workers, lndians?

68
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:03,901
Well, Mr. Van Rensselaer called.
He wants you to fire his chauffeur.

69
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:08,822
Mr. Spencer sen. wants you to draw up
a pre-marital agreement

70
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:14,536
for Mr. Spencer jun. And finally,
Mr. Spencer jun. called, he wants you

71
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:18,916
to tell Mr. Spencer sen. to mind
his own friggin' business.

72
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,878
May justice prevail.
-Why do I do it?

73
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:27,049
I think it's called paying dues.
-I've been paying dues for 11 years.

74
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,719
I should own the entire club by now.
-Right on, Roger.

75
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:35,390
No more. I want worthwhile cases.
I want to defend right against wrong!

76
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:39,895
And I want a partnership!
-You're telling the wrong people!

77
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:44,066
I know. I was practicing. Pretty good!
Wadding the messages's very effective.

78
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:48,237
I'll do this for Schuyler right now.
-Seymour, she was the 4th woman today

79
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:53,116
to tell me she'd been subponenaed!
-Mr. Schuyler, I have to talk to you.

80
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:57,204
I don't want her on the stand!
Listen, if you haven't got the guts

81
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:02,292
to handle this the right way,
I'm going to find someone who does!

82
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:06,046
Mr. Schuyler...
-I was just gonna call you.

83
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:10,217
Got Miss Cutwater's files. Go to her.
Edwina claims that she's finally dying

84
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:14,388
and needs to get her affairs in order.
-No, I have to discuss my future

85
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:18,559
here with you right now.
-Well, we are discussing your future.

86
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:23,564
You're going out to Edwina Cutwater.
-I want a partnership.

87
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:27,943
Listen, the day you give up be-bop and
concentrate on the law, we'll talk!

88
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:32,447
Start talking. I quit the band.
As of today I'm dedicating myself

89
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:38,287
full time to my legal career.
Later today I'm going to buy a vest.

90
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,457
My God, you're serious.
-I am serious.

91
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:47,254
But I wanna start handling real cases,
big cases, no more trick or treat.

92
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:52,259
I waited so long to hear you say that.
-I'm not going out to Edwina Cutwater.

93
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:56,430
No, no, no! Listen to me. Long after
Edwina is gone from this earth,

94
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,601
her estate is going to generate
more income for this office

95
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:04,771
than most small countries
see in a year.

96
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:09,234
And it's gonna take a lot of
very sophisticated legal expertise

97
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:13,405
to structure and administer these
affairs. Now, you do this for me,

98
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:17,784
today, go out to her house, and I'll
put you in charge of all that.

99
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,955
Now, if that's not real law,
if that's not big law,

100
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,875
then I don't know what the hell is.
-The more I think about this thing,

101
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,754
the better it sounds.

102
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:33,133
Don't look at me like that, will you?

103
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:37,387
I don't go there as a messenger boy
but as a highly skilled legal advisor.

104
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:41,558
This is really good. No more being
looked down upon by people that think

105
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:45,854
they're better than I am because
they're rich. From now on I'm gonna

106
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:50,108
be respected by people who think
they're better than I am.

107
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,656
Hi. Roger Cobb from Schuyler and
Mifflin to see Miss Cutwater.

108
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:59,701
Yes, sir, you are expected.
-I'll show him up.

109
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,123
Betty Ahrens.
-I'm Roger Cobb.

110
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:08,669
Try not to excite her, ok?
-Grayson?

111
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,963
Oh, yes, Madam?

112
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:15,259
Don't forget to pick up
the invitations and make sure they're

113
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:19,429
hand delivered the moment I die.
-The moment you die. Yes, Madam.

114
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,015
Oh! Oh, Mr....
-Cobb.

115
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:26,186
Cobb. Oh, yes, you're the tedious one.
Would you mind accompanying me back

116
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:30,357
to my deathbed? Now, here's the name
of my caterer, and the evening's menu.

117
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:34,236
Make sure they have plenty
of goose pate, it's marvelous.

118
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:38,282
Excuse me. Is this for the funeral?
One does not have that at a funeral.

119
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:42,452
Now, Mr. Fulton Norris is a wonderful
society orchestra. I should like you

120
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:46,540
to engage him for the entire weekend.
-Is this for the wake, Ma'am?

121
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,502
Heavens, no. It's for a party and
I want it to a corker.

122
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,630
Guess what I'm going to do?
-What?

123
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,093
I'm going to come back from the dead.
-Oh! And...

124
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:02,681
what makes you think you can do that?
-Because I'm rich.

125
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,771
Grayson, come in here, please, over.

126
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:14,151
Miss Cutwater, this is not a parking
ticket we're talking about here,

127
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:19,281
this is the, oh, The Grim Reaper.
You cannot bribe the Grim Reaper.

128
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:23,660
Oh, Mr. Cobb, I spent a lifetime
shackled by freilty and poor health...

129
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:28,749
wheelchairs and sick beds.
It's my heart, you see. It means well,

130
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:35,631
but it's alsways been
something of lemon.

131
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:40,427
I've hat all the money in the world
and not one good chance to enjoy it.

132
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:45,641
I have never been to Europe.
I've ner been anywhere really.

133
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:51,813
Oh, sure I've ordered from Neiman's
and Gucci's,

134
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:56,485
but I've never actually been there.
I've never ridden my own horses.

135
00:12:57,027 --> 00:13:01,198
I've never been to the ballet.
I've never danced.

136
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:07,037
But Cutwater's aren't quitters.
So, I've decided that if my wealth

137
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:12,459
cannot help me in this life, then by
God, it's going to buy me another one.

138
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:16,088
Ah, Grayson.
-You walkie-talkied, Madam?

139
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:20,259
Yes, please, send in Mr. Prakha Lasa
and what's her name, Fred's daughter.

140
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:23,387
Miss Terry, Madam.
-Gas me.

141
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:27,766
Am I just getting you goose pate
or do you have any legal work for me.

142
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:31,937
Of course I do. I need you to amend
my will so that what's her name, uh,

143
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:37,150
Fred's daughter will become inheritor
over my entire estate.

144
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:42,364
So we must draw up a new codicile.
We need it witnesses. Ah, Your Grace.

145
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:47,578
It's all, Prakha, come in.
Come in, come in, come in.

146
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:50,706
Come, come.

147
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:57,921
What's going on here?
-Wait.

148
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:02,176
Who's Fred's daughter?

149
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:05,304
Hello.

150
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:10,851
Hello. I'm Terry Hoskins.
-Roger Cobb. You're Fred's daughter?

151
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:18,150
Who the heck is Fred?
-Daddy, come in, please.

152
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:23,655
Oh, I'm against the whole thing, I am.
-Daddy is Miss Cutwater's stable man.

153
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:27,534
It's unnatural.
-Let me get something straight here.

154
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:31,705
You want to will all your money to the
stableman's daughter. He's against it.

155
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,790
No.
-He said...

156
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:38,462
You see, I should inherit nothing.
-She should be your sele beneficiary.

157
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:42,341
That is correct.
-So you will inherit the estate.

158
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,552
No, she won't.

159
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:49,515
What am I missing here?
-Thanks to his Highness Prakha Lasa,

160
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,602
I'm going to be transmigrated.

161
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:59,441
What?
-Transmigrated means that my soul

162
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:03,612
is going to leave my body forever
and become one with the Universe.

163
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:08,408
Then my soul will enter her body.
-Ah, good plan.

164
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:12,788
I'm sorry but I don't think
it's a good plan at all.

165
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:16,750
My dauther's soul leavin' her body
and going off to who knows where?

166
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,129
Fred, let's not go through again.
-Oh, I know I wasn't much of a father

167
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:24,758
to her when she was growing up, but l
won't lose her again! No, I won't!

168
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:28,637
Zip it, Fred.
-Miss Cutwater,

169
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,808
as your attorney it is my duty
to inform you that the will

170
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:37,479
could be contested if you're deemed
not of perfectly sound mind.

171
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:43,527
Why you presumptuous ambulance chaser.

172
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:47,906
Are you insinuating that I am
not of perfectly sound mind?

173
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:52,703
No, I wouldn't do that, but I think
practically everybody

174
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:56,874
in the solar system would.
-Mr. Cobb, the last thing I need

175
00:15:56,874 --> 00:16:01,461
around here is your ill-informed
negativity. Get out.

176
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:10,846
Thanks for not exciting her.
All right? There, there.

177
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:20,230
Terry! No, Prakha, not yet.
Prakha, not yet!

178
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:28,488
All right.
-I'm not ready.

179
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:32,326
Is everybody here bananas?
-Mr. Cobb,

180
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:36,830
Iet me explain something to you.
You see...

181
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,667
closer please.

182
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:47,132
That's for bananas, now get out!

183
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:51,512
What century is this?
-Now you hurt my hand.

184
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,016
I'm gonna tell Mr. Schuyler
that you're an insolent little toad

185
00:16:56,016 --> 00:17:00,187
and demand that he fire you.
-Why don't you just enter his body

186
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:05,192
and do it yourself?
-And don't you come back, you peasant!

187
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:11,532
Look, lady, just because my grandpa
didn't rape the environment

188
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:15,702
and exploit the workers doesn't make
me a peasant! I'm sure he tried!

189
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:20,290
It's just that as a barber he didn't
have that much opportunity!

190
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:30,425
Grayson, bring the car
and my hairdresser

191
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:34,805
and the golden diamond jewelry, over.

192
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:43,647
I've got to say, it's brilliant.
-What is?

193
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:48,235
Your scam. It's legal, it's logical.
Only the bowl was overdoing

194
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,197
but it's certainly original.
-The bowl, Mr. Cobb, is attuned

195
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:56,368
to the harmonics of Miss Cutwater's
life force. When her body dies

196
00:17:56,368 --> 00:18:00,539
it becomes a repository of that force
so I hold the bowl and it becomes

197
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:05,669
the conduit from her body to mine.
-And you really believe that?

198
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:08,797
Yes.
-Of course,

199
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:13,594
if you're wrong you inherit
20 million bucks.

200
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:18,265
I don't want her money.
When I was 15 I ran away from home

201
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:23,478
thinking I could find myself in the
material world. I found only pain.

202
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:28,901
His Holiness Prakha Lasa teaches
that possessions transmit pain.

203
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:33,071
I want something far more valuable
than money, far more elusive for which

204
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:37,993
I'm giving up my physical being
and become one with the Universe.

205
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:42,789
And, uh, don't you think that's
just a little bit whacko?

206
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:48,420
Feel my heart.

207
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:54,343
You are unhappy.
You are anxious and unfulfilled

208
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:58,931
because you are not doing
with your life as you wish.

209
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:03,435
I am at peace.
Which one of us is crazy?

210
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:09,775
You are. Well, thank you.

211
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:30,003
Margo.
-Oh, Mr. Durand called.

212
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:34,174
He needs you to set up a Bermuda
Corporation so he can write off

213
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:38,345
his honeymoon. And a call...
-Forget it. I'm telling Schuyler today

214
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:43,559
he's gotta play me or trade me.
-Conference room with Miss Cutwater.

215
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:48,480
She's here?
-Also with her doctor, her nurse,

216
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:52,943
Mr. Mifflin, some English girl
with no bra. And a Hindu

217
00:19:55,153 --> 00:20:00,367
holding a bedpan on a stick.
I don't think you should go in there.

218
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:06,832
We just have a little bit more left.
Are you strong enough to continue?

219
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:10,043
What? Oh, I'm fine.

220
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:14,339
Really. I'm fine. Tell them.

221
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:18,177
She could drop dead any minute.
Never mind her.

222
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:22,055
She's only trying
to make me feel good.

223
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:26,226
I'm very sorry to interrupt.
Madam, I wish to apologize

224
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:30,397
for upsetting you before.
Mr. Schuyler, if I could see you...

225
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:35,485
Mr. Cobb, please don't grovel.
-I'm not grovelling,

226
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:39,239
I'm apologizing.
If I could see you outside.

227
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:43,202
If you're trying to save your job,
you're too late.

228
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:47,372
What?
-It's quite lost by now.

229
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:55,297
Let me tell you something. My father
worked himself into an early grave

230
00:20:55,422 --> 00:21:00,636
defending the rights of needy people
in his store front over on 9th Street.

231
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:04,806
When he died my mother took a job as
a plumber's assistant so I could go to

232
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:08,977
Iaw school and carry on in his name!
So now that the only job I can get

233
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:12,314
is in some skid-row legal aid office!
I'd just as soon take it as...

234
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:16,151
That's enough!
-... explore your energy vampire!

235
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:20,531
Suck out my fun of being a lawyer!
-Shut up! Now, that's enough!

236
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,536
I never heard such a moronic load
of crap in my life!

237
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:29,706
Well, I don't have to take that.
-No, not you, her. Did you hear

238
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:33,168
what she wants to do with her soul?
-Yeah.

239
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:36,713
Jesus Christ, she's is looney tune.
-She's nuts!

240
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:41,385
But you've got guts! I never saw you
stand up to anyone like that before.

241
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:47,641
You have a fire burning inside you.
To defend people who really need you.

242
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:51,603
And I never knew that
about your father or your mother.

243
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:54,439
I made that up.
-You did?

244
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,525
Yeah.
-Son-of-a-gun!

245
00:21:56,525 --> 00:22:00,487
It was pretty good, huh?
-I like a man who thinks on his feet.

246
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:04,116
Well, thanks.
-Roger, I have a case that needs

247
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:09,121
a lawyer just like you. You win it
and I'll put you up for a partnership.

248
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:13,500
But not for an rich goofball.
-No, no, no. It's for a very nice man

249
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,588
who's getting divorced.

250
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:21,425
I think I'm gonna be a partner.
-Mazeltoff!

251
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:26,346
Oh, Bix, you're gonna be
a partner's best friend.

252
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:32,060
Call the Fulton Morris Orchestra.
Tell them Miss Cutwater has requested

253
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:36,231
her favorite saxaphone player
Tyrone Wattell for her party.

254
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:40,402
And she'd like him to receive
a thousand dollars for the night.

255
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:44,072
We gonna inform Mr. Wattell.
Come on, Bix.

256
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:47,618
What a guy!
-Now then...

257
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:54,499
Mr. Mifflin can witness the codicil.
I will sign as executor of the estate

258
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:59,087
and then we will be all signed,
sealed and...

259
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:02,841
Oh, a tunnel...

260
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:06,887
Edwina?
-With a very bright light.

261
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:10,557
I was afraid of this.
-What the hell's she talking about?

262
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:13,143
Terry! Prakha!

263
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:18,357
What the hell is going on?
-Miss Cutwater?

264
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:29,535
Did she sign everything?
-Jan, an S 10... I. V. Hurry!

265
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:33,497
Call the insurance company.

266
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:44,967
How is she? Will she be all right?
-I'm losing her. I'm losing her!

267
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:53,934
Get out of my way, you fool!

268
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:59,147
I lost her.

269
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:12,160
Where am l?
-What?

270
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,540
Ah, I'm breathing. I must be alive.
-Who said that?

271
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:20,210
No, I can't be. I just died.
-Wait a minute.

272
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:24,798
I'm picking up General Hospital
in my fillings.

273
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:28,760
Oh, it worked. Oh, my Lord!

274
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:36,560
What the hell's happening to me?
-I feel...

275
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:41,565
Iike the healthiest woman alive. Oh!

276
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:45,736
Who said that? I did. I'm going crazy.

277
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:49,907
Oh-oh! That does not sound
like Fred's daughter.

278
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:55,245
No, I'm not going crazy.
Something hit me on the head. Oh!

279
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:59,291
I'm just hallucinating. That's all!

280
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:02,211
Oh!
-Oh, shit!

281
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:07,341
What the hell are you doing in there?
-Unbelievable! I can't even die right.

282
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:13,180
Why are you doing this to me?
-God, don't you get enough laughs?

283
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:17,559
What did I ever do to you?
-Somebody tell me this doesn't happen!

284
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:21,522
I'm afraid it is, so let's just
go inside and have Prakha Lasa

285
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:25,901
straighten out this mess.
-Oh, geez! I can't move my right leg!

286
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:29,947
I'm paralyzed!
-Here let me try.

287
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:32,366
Now!

288
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:37,454
Oh, we... we obviously have
mutual control over our body.

289
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:41,124
This is my body!
I'm not sharing my body with anyone!

290
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:45,295
Everybody's gonna be disappointed.
-Oh, where we going?

291
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:50,592
We've got to find Prakha Lasa!
-I can't got in there! Schuyler...

292
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:55,097
Excuse me, this is a private
conversation, do you mind? Ah, no!

293
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:59,268
Please, just do as I say!
-No! Oh!

294
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:12,823
Oh, you seem to have control
over the left side of your body,

295
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:16,785
while I feel dominant on the right.

296
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:21,164
Oh, let go of that.

297
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:26,044
You bitch! How about a little respect
for the deceased?

298
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:29,173
Ow! Ow!

299
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:33,260
Let go of my hand, you bruthe!
I will not!

300
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:36,180
Oh, oh! Ow!

301
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:40,350
Just stop it!
If you want me out of you,

302
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:44,521
stop this ridiculous behavior.
-Lady, I don't know how you got in

303
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:48,984
but I'm gonna get you out of me
right now! Let's go!

304
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,740
Just wait, I'll go first.
Calm down and try to concentrate.

305
00:26:56,408 --> 00:27:00,787
I'm the right side, uh,
and you're the left.

306
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:04,333
First me, then you.

307
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:08,795
Me, you.
See, if we just cooperate...

308
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:12,674
Now all we have to do
is find Prakha Lasa.

309
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:16,637
There's something we have to do first.
-What?

310
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:21,016
Oh, I have to take a leak.
-Oh!

311
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:28,190
Bix, go see Margo.
-Your foot, my foot,

312
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:32,778
your foot, my foot, very good.
Oh, you're doing wonderfully well.

313
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,908
Isn't it awful?
-I have no idea.

314
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:42,162
I can't go in there. That's the
Men's Room. Shut up and do as I say.

315
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:53,841
Don't you ever, ever yell at me again.
-I'm sorry,

316
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:57,928
this is not my idea of a good time.
-I'm not having my lucky day, either.

317
00:27:57,928 --> 00:28:02,307
I died 5 minutes ago.

318
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:06,895
Oh, God! You'll have to do it!
-I'll have to do what?

319
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:11,692
You know, take it out.
-Take what out?

320
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:15,946
The little fireman.
-The little fireman?

321
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:19,074
You know, my penis!
-How dare you say

322
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:23,662
penis to a dead person?
-Listen, lady,

323
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:27,833
if you don't give Big Ed
some air he's gonna piss all over

324
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:30,961
your half of my body!
-Mr. Cobb,

325
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:35,340
if you are trying to scare me,
it won't work.

326
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:44,725
Oh! Ow! Damnit, stop it!

327
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:52,566
All right, first let go of your grip!

328
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:56,820
Now slowly take your hand. Now slowly!

329
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,991
All right,
now we're going to try it again.

330
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:05,370
Carefully, very carefully.

331
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:15,380
What the hell are you doing in there?
-I am trying to release your Mr. Ed.

332
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:19,343
Stop playing with it already
and take it out.

333
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:23,514
You don't have to talk out loud.
I can hear your thoughts.

334
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:28,018
Oh, great, just what I always wanted.

335
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:44,993
Shall I tap?
-Yes.

336
00:29:45,202 --> 00:29:48,330
Tap, tap.
-Thank you.

337
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:53,544
I meant what I say about yelling.

338
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:03,971
I was just talking to myself in there.
It wasn't anything really.

339
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:08,141
Ah, there's Fred's daughter.
-Yoohoo, Terry. Stop it!

340
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:12,729
No, I don't use my mouth!
Try to walk more like a man.

341
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:15,566
All right!

342
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:21,488
Mr. Cobb, I feel so terrible.
-I know. It's not your fault

343
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:25,158
it didn't work.
-How do you know it didn't work?

344
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:30,038
You won't believe. Where's the Swami?
-He left when those people came in.

345
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:34,418
He's very shy, you know?
-Left? Well, where did he go?

346
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:38,714
Don't worry, I know where to find him.
-Mr. Cobb?

347
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:42,676
Do you still wanna go through
this transmigration? Fine.

348
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:47,264
Mr. Schuyler needs to see you.
-Fine, thanks.

349
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,935
Where can we reach you?
-At Miss Cutwater's. Who's we?

350
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:56,106
Roger? He said now!
-I'll explain later. Trust me.

351
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:04,781
Don't swing your arm so much.
-There's something very odd at Cobb.

352
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:09,161
He brings a dog to a law office for
3 years and you just noticed he's odd?

353
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:13,832
But he's speaking with a funny voice!
-Have you heard his secretary?

354
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:17,169
And he's impli...

355
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:21,465
We'll discuss this later!

356
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:25,719
Tattle tale!
-Are you feeling all right?

357
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:30,098
This Cutwater thing got under my skin!
I need to leave for about an hour.

358
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:34,269
No! We're going to court tomorrow.
-Court tomorrow. Uh, really, l...

359
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:38,565
Clear the decks. Sit down.

360
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:43,654
It's my divorce. Ah, nobody knew.
Tell you the truth,

361
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:47,824
it's a little embarrasing.
Seymour was representing me,

362
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:52,955
but he wasn't doing squat!
You want a partnership, you do for me

363
00:31:52,955 --> 00:31:56,792
what you did in the Brenner case.
-Oh, God, not now.

364
00:31:56,917 --> 00:32:00,963
Oh, just explain what happened.
-Are you crazy? I don't believe it.

365
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:05,133
If I tell him he'll have me put away.
Before I can take care of any of this

366
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:09,429
there's something very personal...
-Oh, yes, of course. All right,

367
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:13,600
sit down, I'll tell you everything.
-Oh, no, no, I meant that l...

368
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:17,771
Ok, don't be embarassed. I started
cheating on my wife 3 years ago.

369
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:21,942
Oh, goody, man! Talk.
-I never intended to.

370
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:26,113
Women just threw themselves at me.
-Oh, you must be joking.

371
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:29,741
What?
-I said, uh, must be choking.

372
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:34,037
Anyway, I'm Paul Newman or anything.
-You can say that again.

373
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:38,834
What?
-I said... could you say that again?

374
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:44,464
I'm not Paul Newman?
-Not Paul Newman.

375
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:52,806
Anyway, it seems that my wife's best
friend suddenly lost her husband.

376
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:58,437
Women usually do outlive their men.
So, naturally, she found herself

377
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:02,482
cut off from her
normal sexual relations and...

378
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:06,653
She turned to you and you comfort her.
I understand, sir,

379
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:10,824
you really didn't do anything wrong.
-Believe it. I was incredible.

380
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:14,995
I see, sir. I can figure out the rest.
-Oh, and then another one was widowed.

381
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:19,082
Ok, so 2 little indiscretions.
That's not such a big deal.

382
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:24,296
And then, another one. And another.
Going to a funeral gave me a hard-on.

383
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:29,301
Speaking on behalf of the dead,
I find this disgusting!

384
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:34,097
I think I got the picture now.
-I'm not sure. It's not just sex.

385
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:39,311
Let me tell you. These sweet darling
ladies gave new purpose to my life!

386
00:33:40,145 --> 00:33:45,150
They gave me the opportunity to give
something back instead of just take!

387
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,487
Are you all right?
-I'm fine, fine!

388
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:52,658
Anyway, you understand what I say?
I give love and happiness to people

389
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:56,912
who really need and appreciate it!
I'm the West Coast distributor of

390
00:33:56,912 --> 00:34:01,083
Iove and happiness. And for that I've
to go court? I don't deserve that!

391
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:05,045
I should get a dinner!
-He should get a social disease.

392
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:09,132
I won't let you down.
-Well, I'm counting on you! Son.

393
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:13,720
Shake hands with him. Like a man.

394
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,600
Crazy musicians.
-You won't regret this.

395
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:23,814
I know I won't. If I do, you'll never
practice in the Free World again.

396
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:34,658
I hope you plan on losing that case.
-How did it go, Roger?

397
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:39,246
The only thing I plan to lose is you!
-Nice talking to you, Roger.

398
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,376
You have a great deal to learn about
making someone feel welcome.

399
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:48,964
Let's get something straight here.
I never liked you in your body,

400
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:53,010
I certainly don't like you in mine!
-Well, I don't see why you're

401
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:57,181
getting so upset about all this.
-Because I want my body back!

402
00:34:57,181 --> 00:35:01,268
And I want my freedom and my privacy.
And most of all, I'd like to be able

403
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:05,439
to take a leak without being fondled!
-You may find this hard to believe,

404
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:10,235
but fondling you while you make
pee-pee is not my idea of a good time.

405
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:15,866
Fine! Fine! It's two o'clock.

406
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:20,871
Round about.
-I have a lot of work to do.

407
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:24,499
I want you out of me by three fifteen!
Now where's the swami?

408
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:29,296
Well, he's never been away from Tibet.
So I put him up at the Ambassador.

409
00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:35,344
Let's see. What is that number?
Hotels.

410
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:39,515
H, H, H, H. Let's see.

411
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,685
Let your fingers do...
Oh, here it is. The Ambassador.

412
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:47,856
And look over here. The Arlington.
That's where Mummy in spring of '62

413
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:52,653
had her amethyst stolen from her in
the elevator. It was so distressing!

414
00:35:52,778 --> 00:35:56,323
Give me that!

415
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:33,861
No. No, he hasn't checked out.

416
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:44,997
Oh, dear!
-Yeah, oh, dear. Don't worry, I know

417
00:36:44,997 --> 00:36:49,501
where to find him. Good going, Edwina!
-It's Miss Cutwater to you!

418
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,255
Hello, Margo.
-Oh, hi, Peg.

419
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:57,426
... follows me in a men's room I think
I can be on a first name basis with!

420
00:36:57,509 --> 00:37:02,639
You told me to pull out your penis!
-How about a cup o' coffee?

421
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:12,649
Where is she?
-Oh, boy!

422
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:15,861
Where is she?
-There's nobody here.

423
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:20,365
Liar! I heard her!
-Peggy, I swear! Nobody else here!

424
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:27,122
Come on out, you little slut!
-Oh, who is she calling a slut? Sssh!

425
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:30,250
I heard that! Come on, denty it!
Where is she?

426
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:37,674
It was me. Bix, stop that!
-What was you?

427
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:42,554
The voice you heard. I was talking to
myself. Hey, your perfume suits you.

428
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:46,850
It's cheap and common!
-Ha! At least it was your side.

429
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:50,479
Who fondled you in the Men's Room?
-Me.

430
00:37:50,604 --> 00:37:53,607
Liar!
-How dare she? Edwina!

431
00:37:53,732 --> 00:37:57,903
Edwina? My name is Peggy, you pig!
-Oh, no, let me explain!

432
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:02,074
It's Edwina Cutwater!
She died today!

433
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:06,662
You did it with a dead woman?
-No!

434
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:10,832
You are sick! I came here to talk
about our marriage, although I heard

435
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:15,712
how you stick by my mother.
-What has your mother to do with this?

436
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:20,717
Tomorrow you attend the opposite side
against my own mother!

437
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:25,305
But I attend your father!
-You gonna tear her off a strip!

438
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:29,685
Now, that's...
-lf you go to court, it's the end!

439
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:32,813
And if I don't go,
your father will kick me in my balls.

440
00:38:32,813 --> 00:38:36,984
Either me or your balls, Roger!
You can't get both!

441
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:45,534
Really a very interesting alternative.
I do not even know the use of balls

442
00:38:45,534 --> 00:38:50,664
but I believe they are more important
for you than for your girl-friend.

443
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:57,129
Now?
-I depend too much on them, Peggy.

444
00:38:57,129 --> 00:39:00,048
Farewell, Roger.

445
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:05,137
By the way, your dog is disgusting!
And jazz is absolutely hare-brained!

446
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:17,149
Oh! And I faked them,
all those orgasm...

447
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:26,617
Sound familiar?

448
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:30,913
Yeah, well, I faked mine, too!

449
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:37,461
Believe we're better off without her.
She isn't right for us.

450
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:47,888
Since our little accident, I sensed
a lot of hostility coming from you.

451
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:53,101
Excuse me! But I'm watching my entire
career going right down the sewer,

452
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:57,272
'cause I've got a dead woman
living inside me. And only person

453
00:39:57,272 --> 00:40:01,443
that can get you out is cosmic weirdo
you can't even find!

454
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:06,031
I can so find him! I think! Oh, wait,

455
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:10,202
I'm sure I know where he'll be
this evening. Do you have a car?

456
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:13,747
Oh, this is fun!
-Shift, damnit!

457
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:17,501
Shifting, wheee!
-What are you doing?

458
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:21,255
I never learned driving! Which...
-The brake not the gas!

459
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:25,217
I don't know which it is. Oh!
-Bix, let go of her!

460
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:29,304
Stop it! Let go! Ow! I'm gonna
strangle this mangy mongrel.

461
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:32,850
All right, that's it.
-This is wrong! Where are we going?

462
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:38,146
It's enough that I've to put up wit
you, but I won't subject Bix to this!

463
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:42,860
Tyrone. Great, I gotta talk to you.
-Hey, Roger Dodger!

464
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:47,865
Got a call from the union about a gig.
They didn't say who recommended me,

465
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:52,452
but I smelled your fingerprints...
-lt was nothing really.

466
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:56,623
Can we get on with this, please?
-Uh, who's that? Someone with you?

467
00:40:56,623 --> 00:41:00,878
Sort of, yeah.
-Well, introduce me to the lady.

468
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:06,425
M'm Edwina Cutwater, Tyrone Wattell.

469
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:10,679
Please to meet you.
-Pleased to meet you.

470
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:15,184
Hairy knuckles for a chick.
-Can you take care of Bix?

471
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:19,646
Oh, sure, l... Wait a minute.
Roger, what's wrong?

472
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:24,443
I really don't think I can explain it.
-What's wrong, Roger?

473
00:41:24,568 --> 00:41:29,781
Edwina died today. Her soul entered me
and took the right half of my body.

474
00:41:30,282 --> 00:41:34,453
Why didn't you say straight away?
-I knew you'd understand.

475
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:38,624
Thanks for not having me comitted.
-I got friends crazier than you,

476
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:42,794
but I ain't got many better.
-Thanks, pal. Go with him, Bix.

477
00:41:42,794 --> 00:41:46,965
C'on, Bix. Nice meetin' you, Edwina.
-Bye.

478
00:41:53,138 --> 00:41:57,935
A woman who would rather buy a candle
than to curse the darkness.

479
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:06,568
Pack 'em in don't you?
-Hello! Come in.

480
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:11,782
I can start over if you'd like.
-No, thank you.

481
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:18,038
And we wonder, Oh Lord, what it means
when a person passes away

482
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:23,669
and so few take the time
to pay final respects.

483
00:42:23,794 --> 00:42:27,756
Oh, big deal.
-He's not here. Let's got find him.

484
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:32,761
However, we have received a number
of mailgrams, from reaved loved ones.

485
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:36,932
Wait, wait, wait! I must hear this.
-I got to prepare the most important

486
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:42,020
case of my life, let's get out here!
-No, I want to hear these mailgrams.

487
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:45,691
Oh, I really got to...
-I mean it, sit!

488
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:50,279
Very touching. "We will miss her.
The Valley Oxygen Supply Company."

489
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:54,533
(Edwina) Oh, that's sweet.
-"She was truly a great customer.

490
00:42:55,158 --> 00:42:59,538
J & J. Wheelchairs."
-Oh, they remembered.

491
00:42:59,538 --> 00:43:03,917
Browning Orthopedic Mattresses:
"May she continue to rest in peace."

492
00:43:05,169 --> 00:43:09,256
Oh, how deeply touching.

493
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:24,771
Mr. Cobb? Mr. Cobb?

494
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:29,985
Oh, hi! What time is it?

495
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:36,366
Almost midnight. Now, please tell me
how you knew it didn't work?

496
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,206
Edwina?

497
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:46,251
She's asleep.
-Who's asleep?

498
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:50,422
Edwina. Don't wake her. Wow.

499
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:54,927
Great. When she's asleep, I can...
-Mr. Cobb, Miss Cutwater is dead.

500
00:43:55,969 --> 00:44:00,015
No. She's not.
She entered me instead of you.

501
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,143
What?
-Oh, where's the swami?

502
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:07,105
I haven't seen him.
-Maybe he's back at the hotel.

503
00:44:07,231 --> 00:44:11,276
I just called and there's no answer.
-We should go there and wait for him.

504
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:15,447
I gotta find him. I can't take more...
-You poor dear. You must relax.

505
00:44:15,572 --> 00:44:20,035
Stop worrying.
-No, I think we oughta find him.

506
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,789
I'm sure he'll be at the funeral
tomorrow morning.

507
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:27,543
And if Miss Cutwater really
is inside you, he will help her

508
00:44:27,543 --> 00:44:31,088
Ieave your body and enter mine.

509
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:37,135
I think I envy her.

510
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,306
Mr. Cobb,

511
00:44:41,306 --> 00:44:45,686
this morning,
when I placed your hand on my heart

512
00:44:46,854 --> 00:44:49,857
did you feel anything special?

513
00:44:49,982 --> 00:44:54,027
Yes, I felt your left...
-Yes!

514
00:44:54,778 --> 00:44:59,449
I felt something
very special pass between us.

515
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:03,620
Oh, Mr. Cobb, by this time tomorrow
my soul will be gone!

516
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:07,499
I want to know love one last time.

517
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:11,670
Don't you think we really oughta go...
-Please. Mr. Cobb,

518
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:16,466
Iet me take the memory of passion
to sustain me in the next world.

519
00:45:18,844 --> 00:45:23,223
So this would be
like for a good cause?

520
00:45:24,266 --> 00:45:26,894
Oh, yes.

521
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:31,899
We have to be very quiet.
-I'm not sure that will be possible.

522
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:38,989
My God!

523
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:45,662
It's a good cause. It's a good cause.
It's a good cause.

524
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:54,004
I'm ready, Mr. Cobb. Take me!

525
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:58,175
Sssh, keep sleeping, Edwina. Oh!

526
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:02,221
Now! Oh!

527
00:46:02,638 --> 00:46:05,057
Now!

528
00:46:14,525 --> 00:46:17,569
What is all this?

529
00:46:17,778 --> 00:46:21,114
Now!
-What's going on here?

530
00:46:21,114 --> 00:46:23,617
Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

531
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:28,288
What are you doing to her?
-Nothing. I'm not doing anything.

532
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:33,293
Go back to sleep, you're dreaming.
Why, Miss Hoskins! You whore!

533
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:37,464
You lascivious whore! Oh, no!
-Oh, yes.

534
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:40,926
You're a shameles little slut!
-Yes!

535
00:46:40,926 --> 00:46:44,471
Shut up!
-Talk dirty.

536
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:48,517
You're nothing but a cheap sex tramp!
-Good. Good.

537
00:46:48,642 --> 00:46:53,438
Now call me a poodle, Mr. Cobb.
Call me a cheap, slut, sex poodle!

538
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:57,693
Why you deserve a good spanking?
-Oh, Mr. Cobb!

539
00:46:57,693 --> 00:47:01,864
You little bed bunny!
-Edwina, no!

540
00:47:02,072 --> 00:47:06,243
Mr. Cobb, yes, you love rocket!
-Ah, stop talking like that!

541
00:47:06,243 --> 00:47:10,622
Oh, spank me again, you bad boy!
-Oh, Edwina, stop it! Edwina!

542
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:16,253
She should be ashamed of herself!
-And you should, too!

543
00:47:16,879 --> 00:47:19,381
Mr. Cobb?

544
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:24,803
For God's sake, Edwina, go away!
My body! What if you got pregnant?

545
00:47:24,928 --> 00:47:28,473
You have no right!
No, you have no right!

546
00:47:28,557 --> 00:47:32,519
And you have no class! You're rude,
crude and thoroughly unattractive!

547
00:47:32,644 --> 00:47:36,273
God, it is Miss Cutwater!

548
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:42,446
I'm sorry you had such a lousy life.
But just because you never did this

549
00:47:42,446 --> 00:47:47,242
doesn't mean we have to go without.
-I'm quite proud of my virginity!

550
00:47:47,326 --> 00:47:52,539
It's something I've always treasured!
-Yeah! Nobody else ever wanted it!

551
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,919
Terry, wait!

552
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:13,602
Lady, if Prakha cocker
doesn't show up tomorrow

553
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:18,315
I'm gonna get a lobotomy or a high
colonic or something, but you're

554
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:22,694
getting the keys to the street!
-Oh, stop being such a martyr.

555
00:48:22,778 --> 00:48:27,908
I'll pay you for your troubles.
-Maybe. Oh, Jesus, I just realize

556
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:32,579
why no one showed up at your memorial
service. You forgot to hire mourners.

557
00:48:33,747 --> 00:48:37,793
You are insensitive horse's ass,
do you know that?

558
00:48:37,918 --> 00:48:42,297
Oh, drop dead!
-Look, Cobb, I am talking to you!

559
00:48:42,297 --> 00:48:47,719
For your information, there is a
perfectly good reason nobody showed up

560
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:51,557
at my memorial service.
-Yeah, what?

561
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:55,727
I don't have any friends.

562
00:48:55,853 --> 00:49:00,524
I'm looking back at an entire lifetime
and I don't have one friend.

563
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:04,486
I've never had any friends.

564
00:49:04,486 --> 00:49:08,782
I'v had only nanny's and tutors
and servants and nurses. Oh.

565
00:49:13,245 --> 00:49:18,166
Once my parents hired a clown to
entertain me, but he didn't like me.

566
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:23,046
And when my parents weren't
in the room he'd just sit there.

567
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:27,551
He didn't lift a finger to amuse me.
Oh!

568
00:49:33,182 --> 00:49:37,561
That's a terrible clown.
-Yes. Well, that's not all.

569
00:49:38,604 --> 00:49:43,400
When Fred's daughter was a little girl
came to my house to visit her father

570
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:47,863
and the nurses would push my
oxygen tent over to the bedroom window

571
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:52,576
so I could watch her and
all her little friends ride my horses

572
00:49:53,285 --> 00:50:00,918
and swim in my pool and run and play
and laugh and dance. Oh!

573
00:50:02,669 --> 00:50:06,840
Then I swore. I'd give every cent
I ever had to be able to do all that.

574
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:11,345
To be free. To be like her.

575
00:50:13,222 --> 00:50:17,392
Well, I've humiliated myself.

576
00:50:19,478 --> 00:50:24,483
Anyway, what I wanted to say was
I'm sorry if I spoiled your birthday.

577
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:30,948
And I'm sorry if I made you being dead
an unpleasant experience.

578
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:35,327
Well, I am dead, aren't l?
Oh, please, make me not dead!

579
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:39,581
I can't, Edwina.

580
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:44,711
No sense wishing.

581
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:51,051
Oh, I feel much better.
-It's really late. Go back to sleep.

582
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:55,430
Well, aren't you coming to bed?

583
00:50:55,556 --> 00:51:00,561
I can't. I gotta prepare for this
case tomorrow. You go to sleep.

584
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:03,564
Oh, ok.

585
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:08,902
Good night, Roger.

586
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:12,656
Good night, Edwina.

587
00:51:12,656 --> 00:51:13,907
Roger? Roger? Roger!

588
00:51:13,907 --> 00:51:15,993
Roger? Roger? Roger!

589
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:20,372
Wake aup! Wake up, Roger.
Funeral time!

590
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:24,835
Let's go, we've to to get up, Roger!
Come on! Up! Up, up, up! Let's go!

591
00:51:24,835 --> 00:51:28,088
What...

592
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:34,344
Did you have a good night's sleep?
-Oh, yeah. I got the full seven...

593
00:51:34,428 --> 00:51:38,098
and a half minutes. No problem. Oh!

594
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:50,611
Ommm! Ring! Ohh!

595
00:52:06,752 --> 00:52:08,837
Oh, Roger!

596
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:19,181
All right, I'm awake. I'm awake.
-You have no idea what it's like

597
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:23,769
to be inside a healthy body!
-I tried to find out last night!

598
00:52:26,271 --> 00:52:31,485
I cannot believe you'ar still upset
about that. Careful, careful.

599
00:52:31,902 --> 00:52:36,365
Of course you can't. Can we hurry this
up, please? See, your problem is,

600
00:52:36,365 --> 00:52:40,661
you don't understand how to live life.
It's to be experienced and savored.

601
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:44,831
I know that, you big dope. Why do you
think I've gone to so much trouble

602
00:52:44,915 --> 00:52:48,585
and expense to buy myself
another chance?

603
00:52:48,585 --> 00:52:52,756
Cause you're under mistaken assumption
that it's going to make a difference.

604
00:52:52,756 --> 00:52:56,927
It will, too, make a difference.
-You'll still be the same sour puss.

605
00:52:56,927 --> 00:53:01,306
You'll wind up as bitter and alone
as you always have been.

606
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:06,520
I think not. I'm gonna dance, Roger.
I'm gonna twirl and whirl and spin.

607
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:11,608
I'm gonna cha-cha in the rain game.
I'm gonna dip deeply.

608
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:14,736
Good, this one.
-It's too unattractive.

609
00:53:14,736 --> 00:53:18,907
So's a deep scar. Just do as I say,
we don't have time to argue.

610
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:22,661
What's the big hurry anyway?
My funeral's not until 10.30.

611
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:26,832
Cause I have to be in court at 8.30.
How are we gonna make a 10.30 funeral

612
00:53:26,832 --> 00:53:32,171
if you have to be in court?
-I'll figure it out at 10.29, ok?

613
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:37,384
You are so cranky when you
haven't had enough sleep.

614
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:41,847
Did you sign this check?
-Yes.

615
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:45,392
And this?
-Yes.

616
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:49,271
And this?
-Yes.

617
00:53:49,271 --> 00:53:53,233
No further question.
-Counselor?

618
00:53:54,276 --> 00:53:57,404
Roger? Roger! Roger!

619
00:53:59,489 --> 00:54:03,744
God! You can't fall asleep on me now.
Counselor?

620
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:06,872
Just a second.

621
00:54:06,997 --> 00:54:11,251
Roger, please wake up.
-Counselor, the Court is waiting!

622
00:54:15,964 --> 00:54:18,342
Well.

623
00:54:21,178 --> 00:54:25,224
Oh, Your Honor...
-Edwina, a man, act like a man.

624
00:54:25,224 --> 00:54:28,769
Your Honor...

625
00:54:40,656 --> 00:54:43,784
Your Honour, yes...

626
00:54:43,784 --> 00:54:47,871
Proceed with the witness.
-What the hell's the matter with you?

627
00:54:47,871 --> 00:54:52,042
I'm just a little nervous, that's all.
-It's just your career that's a stake,

628
00:54:52,042 --> 00:54:57,047
that's all. So, don't be nervous.
-Ah, Mr. Schuyler, you didn't really

629
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:01,301
give those women a half million
dollars in gifts now, did you?

630
00:55:05,806 --> 00:55:08,934
Yes, I did.

631
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:14,773
Well, I'll bet you had a darn good
reason to, now didn't you, sport?

632
00:55:15,816 --> 00:55:19,987
Why are you acting like this?
-Say yes.

633
00:55:20,904 --> 00:55:22,990
Yes.

634
00:55:23,115 --> 00:55:27,286
He had a darn good reason.

635
00:55:27,911 --> 00:55:30,914
Proceed.
-Proceed?

636
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:35,002
Proceed, Edwina. Like a man!
Proceed like a man!

637
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:38,755
Proceed, uh?

638
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:44,178
Wait a second. Every Christmas you
gave me... Miss Cutwater

639
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:47,306
darling little gifts, didn't you?
-Yeah.

640
00:55:47,306 --> 00:55:52,311
So it is your practice! Indeed,
ladies and gentlemen of the world.

641
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:57,733
It is standard practice among many
business professionals to reward

642
00:55:57,733 --> 00:56:01,695
valued clients with gifts, is it not?

643
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:05,866
Oh!
-Yeah. Yes, it is.

644
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:11,288
Objection. The money in question came
from the Schuyler's personal account,

645
00:56:11,288 --> 00:56:16,502
not from the law firm and therefore
cannot be construed as business gifts.

646
00:56:16,919 --> 00:56:20,047
Good point, Toots.

647
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:24,510
Oh! Women! Uh, can't live with 'em,
can't live without 'em.

648
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:28,805
Oh, Roger, please, wake up!

649
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:33,185
Mr. Cobb!

650
00:56:33,268 --> 00:56:36,813
I'm sorry, Roger.

651
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:39,858
Roger! Roger!

652
00:56:45,155 --> 00:56:48,825
Oh! Oh! What?
-Mr. Cobb, are you all right?

653
00:56:48,825 --> 00:56:53,705
Yeah. No problem.
-How do you respond to the objection?

654
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:56,959
Objection?

655
00:56:57,251 --> 00:57:01,338
Uh, could you read that back, please?
-The money in question came from the

656
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:05,509
Schuyler's personal account, not from
the law firm and therefore cannot be

657
00:57:05,592 --> 00:57:09,346
construed as business gifts.
-Business gifts?

658
00:57:09,346 --> 00:57:13,642
Sorry, I didn't have another idea.
-Edwina, you're brilliant!

659
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,562
Your Honor,

660
00:57:16,645 --> 00:57:20,190
Mrs. Schuyler's sole source of support
was Mr. Schuyler whose sole source

661
00:57:20,315 --> 00:57:24,361
of income was the law firm. So the
better the law firm's business was

662
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:28,532
the more money Mr. Schuyler could take
home to Mrs. Schuyler, therefore,

663
00:57:28,657 --> 00:57:32,703
since business gifts are intended to
increase business, the more generous

664
00:57:32,828 --> 00:57:36,874
Mr. Schuyler was with his gift giving
the better able he was to support

665
00:57:36,999 --> 00:57:41,587
Mrs. Schuyler in the manner
to which she'd become accustomed to.

666
00:57:44,173 --> 00:57:47,843
Give me a minute.

667
00:57:50,345 --> 00:57:54,516
Edwina, I could kiss you. We'll win!
I'm gonna get my partnership and we're

668
00:57:54,516 --> 00:57:59,313
gonna make that funeral! None of those
were clients, but don't tell anyone!

669
00:58:00,147 --> 00:58:03,984
What?
-I'm going to overruel the objection.

670
00:58:04,109 --> 00:58:07,863
Thank you, Your Honor.
-Just a second, this isn't fair.

671
00:58:07,946 --> 00:58:12,034
You Honor, I move we dismiss claim
for damages because those women...

672
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:15,370
Shut up!
-What did you just say?

673
00:58:15,454 --> 00:58:18,498
Nothing.
-Just tell me what you said.

674
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:21,627
I didn't say anything.
-Those women...

675
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:25,797
Those women were not his clients.
-Mr. Cobb, are you all right?

676
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:30,886
I just bit my tongue, that's all.
-Were any of those women clients?

677
00:58:32,137 --> 00:58:35,891
Uh, here we go.

678
00:58:36,016 --> 00:58:40,395
No! You're dead meat, Buddy!
-It's Edwina Cutwater's soul in me!

679
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:44,566
Oh, that's right blame it all on me!
-It's your fault, I had this case won.

680
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:47,694
No, I had it won!
-What the hell's going on here?

681
00:58:47,778 --> 00:58:51,865
It's all not fair!
-There's no fairness in a court room!

682
00:58:51,949 --> 00:58:56,745
500 dollars. Contempt of court!
-Good for you, Judge.

683
00:58:56,745 --> 00:58:58,830
1,000 dollars!
-Shut up!

684
00:58:58,956 --> 00:59:03,210
No, you shut up! 1,500!
-Not you, her. I got her inside me.

685
00:59:04,044 --> 00:59:08,215
Well then, both o'you shut up.
-Don't tell me to shut up, Charles!

686
00:59:08,215 --> 00:59:12,594
2.000 dollars and Bail throw
this jackass out of my court!

687
00:59:12,928 --> 00:59:16,974
I am going to the State Bar. Lunatic!
-You can't do this to me!

688
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:20,936
Not just a lunatic, a pervert, too.
He plays with himself!

689
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:25,315
And he cheated on mewith a dead body!
-You're fired, Cobb!

690
00:59:28,235 --> 00:59:32,406
Oh, Roger, I see what you mean
about life is to be savored!

691
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:37,327
It's so... dramatic.
-I am going to kill you.

692
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:42,833
I was just trying to help.
-You failed!

693
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:47,754
What happened since you help me?
I've lost my girl, I've lost my job,

694
00:59:47,754 --> 00:59:51,592
I've alienated my dog!
I broke my sunglass.

695
00:59:51,717 --> 00:59:55,470
You can't even get that kind any more.
Stop helping me!

696
00:59:55,554 --> 00:59:59,641
You're so ungrateful. If it weren't
for me you would get that partnership

697
00:59:59,725 --> 01:00:03,812
and have to take cases like that!
Kiss your Dad's high ideals goodbye.

698
01:00:03,896 --> 01:00:09,026
You'd also be married to Peggy.
You call that savoring life?

699
01:00:10,277 --> 01:00:14,656
Who's talking about savoring life!
-I spent my life in a sick bed.

700
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:17,993
What's your excuse?

701
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:23,498
You know, it's just like a dead person
to say something like that.

702
01:00:27,586 --> 01:00:30,714
How much to the airport?
-Uh, 30 bucks.

703
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:36,011
100. PanAm. He has to get his plane.
-lt doesn't leave till midnight.

704
01:00:36,136 --> 01:00:38,305
Make it 200.
-No problem.

705
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,807
No problem.
-Bon voyage.

706
01:00:40,933 --> 01:00:43,310
Voyage?

707
01:00:45,395 --> 01:00:49,566
Waste of time. Hurry to the cemetery.
-He better be there, lady!

708
01:00:49,691 --> 01:00:54,279
(Edwina) Maybe Terry picked him up.
-He just better be there!

709
01:00:54,279 --> 01:00:58,534
Oh, there's the elevator.
Hurry! Oh, I love running!

710
01:01:07,918 --> 01:01:11,588
Have you seen Prakha?
-I was hoping you had.

711
01:01:11,672 --> 01:01:16,802
He wasn't at the hotel this morning.
-Oh, I'm ruined. God!

712
01:01:19,596 --> 01:01:23,767
What is that? And who are
all those people behind my hearse?

713
01:01:23,892 --> 01:01:27,521
Oh, I invited them.
-What do you mean?

714
01:01:27,646 --> 01:01:31,692
Last night while you were asleep,
I wanted to surprise you.

715
01:01:31,817 --> 01:01:36,488
I thought it might make your funeral
a little more fun. I don't know.

716
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:43,579
Edwina. Edwina?

717
01:01:47,124 --> 01:01:51,920
You got a little mirror?
Compact or something?

718
01:01:58,177 --> 01:02:02,347
Oh! Oh, Roger, thank you.

719
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:06,852
Ok. Don't make a big deal out of it,
I just did it because I thought

720
01:02:06,852 --> 01:02:11,023
I liked you. I've gotten
over that since then.

721
01:02:11,023 --> 01:02:14,651
Now, come on.
-It's all right. I'm ok now.

722
01:02:14,651 --> 01:02:18,614
Really. I'm fine.
-You're ok?

723
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:23,952
Yes. It's the nicest thing anybody's
ever done for me.

724
01:02:24,453 --> 01:02:28,624
Don't say that.
-Well, it is...

725
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:34,379
You're best friend I've ever had.

726
01:02:40,844 --> 01:02:42,804
Thanks.
-Are you all right?

727
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:46,350
Oh, yeah. The music got to me.

728
01:02:49,811 --> 01:02:54,691
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever. Amen.

729
01:02:55,025 --> 01:02:57,110
Amen.

730
01:03:09,081 --> 01:03:11,375
Terry?

731
01:03:13,043 --> 01:03:17,005
I have this terrible feeling we're
never going to see Prakha Lasa again.

732
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:21,176
I'll find him. Maybe at the hotel.
-I told you. He's not there.

733
01:03:21,176 --> 01:03:25,472
Let's file a Missing Persons report.
Hey, maybe he's trying to get home!

734
01:03:25,556 --> 01:03:29,643
Let's try the airports.
-Actually, the hotel might be better.

735
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:33,689
He's bound to turn up there
eventually. We should try there first.

736
01:03:40,779 --> 01:03:45,158
What are you doing?
-We may not have another chance.

737
01:03:45,284 --> 01:03:49,329
Oh, but I don't think I can...
-Please, Roger, I want to feel

738
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:54,126
your naked skin next to mine.
I want to feel our bodies merge.

739
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,047
Well, I guess there's nothing wrong
with a quick little old merge.

740
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:03,218
Oh, no, you don't do that once again!
-Why don't you relax,

741
01:04:03,302 --> 01:04:07,389
maybe you'll learn something.
-I thought we've to find Prakha Lasa?

742
01:04:07,472 --> 01:04:11,560
I'm just taking a little breather.
-Well, put your little breather back

743
01:04:11,643 --> 01:04:15,731
in your trousers and let's find him!
-Roger, what's wrong?

744
01:04:15,731 --> 01:04:18,859
What?
-Don't I excite you?

745
01:04:18,859 --> 01:04:23,322
Edwina, what are you doing?
-I am thinking of very old nuns.

746
01:04:23,864 --> 01:04:28,243
Oh, please don't do this to me.
-Roger, don't you want me?

747
01:04:28,243 --> 01:04:33,457
Oh, God! Now she's thinking of
dead kittens! Would you excuse us?

748
01:04:37,002 --> 01:04:41,173
All right! What happend to
"Oh, Roger, you're my best friend!"?

749
01:04:41,256 --> 01:04:45,344
I just don't feel like performing
a sexueal act on Fred's daughter.

750
01:04:45,427 --> 01:04:48,555
How about if she performs one on us?
-No!

751
01:04:48,555 --> 01:04:52,643
Please?
-No! What is so important about sex?

752
01:04:52,726 --> 01:04:57,731
So important about sex? That's like
"What's important about laughing?"

753
01:04:57,731 --> 01:05:01,276
Or Duke Ellington or the World Series?

754
01:05:01,401 --> 01:05:05,447
It's one of those things that makes
you feel like you're really living,

755
01:05:05,572 --> 01:05:09,618
Iike you're glad to be alive!
-I am already glad to be alive.

756
01:05:09,743 --> 01:05:13,789
I don't need to play 'tonsil hockey'
with some English tart to feel good,

757
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:18,585
In fact, I feel quite tingly!
-Yeah! You're feeling my tingles!

758
01:05:19,962 --> 01:05:24,550
What do you mean?
-It's called "sexual excitement".

759
01:05:25,801 --> 01:05:29,346
It is?
-Yes. If you think this feels good,

760
01:05:29,429 --> 01:05:34,560
wait'll you feel what
hot passionate boffing feels like.

761
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:40,190
And what happens? Bigger tingles?
-Oh, major tingles.

762
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:45,696
Will she still respect us tomorrow?
-She doesn't respect us now!

763
01:05:45,821 --> 01:05:49,366
Let's boff!
-Yeah!

764
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:54,162
This could be sort of embarrassing.
-For who?

765
01:05:54,246 --> 01:05:58,208
For me. As soon as I get Terry's body,
you'll know what I look like naked.

766
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:01,879
I swear to God I'll never tell anyone.

767
01:06:01,879 --> 01:06:06,049
Ok, thank you.
-You're welcome, now shut up.

768
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:10,220
What should I do? How can I help?
-Fantasize.

769
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:13,640
Oh. Ok. I'm good at that.
-Oh, Terry.

770
01:06:13,765 --> 01:06:18,020
Oh, Roger.
-Oh, Clark. Wait a second, wait!

771
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:24,276
What are you doing?
-I'm fantasizing.

772
01:06:24,276 --> 01:06:28,447
I see Clark Gable takes his shirt off!
-I know. Isn't this hot?

773
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:33,660
No! It's cooling me off, you know?
-It's making me tingle like crazy.

774
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:40,542
Ok. Now just throw a couple o' women
on top of him and we're in business!

775
01:06:40,959 --> 01:06:44,087
Ok.
-All right!

776
01:06:44,838 --> 01:06:48,258
Is it all right now?
-Sort of. She's got the whole cast

777
01:06:48,675 --> 01:06:52,221
of "Gone With The Wind"
humping in my head.

778
01:06:52,346 --> 01:06:54,306
Oh, Roger.
-Oh, Terry.

779
01:06:54,431 --> 01:06:58,685
Oh, Clark! Vivian and Olivia.

780
01:06:58,894 --> 01:07:03,065
Oh, Ashley and Butterfly.

781
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:10,280
At last. Oh, no! Son-of-a-bitch!
-Son-of-a-bitch?

782
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:14,451
I don't believe it!
Now where the hell have you been?

783
01:07:14,535 --> 01:07:19,540
Been?
-The airport? What did you there?

784
01:07:19,665 --> 01:07:24,753
Prakha, it is now time for Miss
Cutwater's soul to enter Miss Hoskins.

785
01:07:25,796 --> 01:07:29,758
Enter Miss Hoskins!
-It's me, Prakha, I'm inside Roger.

786
01:07:29,758 --> 01:07:33,720
Yeam?
-Go warm up the bowl!

787
01:07:33,846 --> 01:07:36,223
Oh!
-Yeah!

788
01:07:45,107 --> 01:07:49,778
Terry? I guess it wasn't meant to be
betwen us. I'll always regret that.

789
01:07:49,987 --> 01:07:54,366
But I want you to know that,
wherever it is you're going,

790
01:07:54,366 --> 01:07:58,745
I hope you'll be verry happy.
-I will. I've got a wonderful house,

791
01:07:58,871 --> 01:08:03,250
beautiful horses and all the money in
the world why shouldn't I be happy?

792
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:05,335
What?

793
01:08:05,419 --> 01:08:09,381
If you think I'm really going through
with this you're not just stupid,

794
01:08:09,381 --> 01:08:13,260
you're crazy.
-What? I'll handle this. What?

795
01:08:13,343 --> 01:08:17,431
From the beginning I thought if mad
Edwina wants to give her money away,

796
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:22,102
she may as well give it to me. I never
thought that "Flying Nun" could do it.

797
01:08:22,102 --> 01:08:26,273
Wait! You just can't leave her in me!
-I'd really love to stay and chat

798
01:08:26,273 --> 01:08:30,444
darling, but I've got get back
to my mansion, get ready for my party.

799
01:08:33,989 --> 01:08:36,074
Ciao!

800
01:08:36,074 --> 01:08:40,245
Oh, by the way, don't bother coming.
The guards will have orders

801
01:08:40,245 --> 01:08:45,167
to keep you out!
Bye, Roger. Goodbye, Miss Cutwater.

802
01:08:46,418 --> 01:08:49,630
So long, Prakha!

803
01:08:54,635 --> 01:08:58,514
Please, don't say it.

804
01:08:58,722 --> 01:09:03,936
Oh, dear God, all I want
was a second chance, a fair shake!

805
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:08,607
Instead I've made a complete mess
of your life,

806
01:09:08,732 --> 01:09:12,778
and I've left all my money to a...

807
01:09:12,903 --> 01:09:16,740
Iying, cheap slut, sex poodle! Oh!

808
01:09:23,956 --> 01:09:28,752
Prakha, I want you to release my soul.
Give Roger his freedom.

809
01:09:28,836 --> 01:09:32,381
No! She double-crossed us,
we can fight this.

810
01:09:32,506 --> 01:09:37,719
No. Perhaps Prakha can put my soul
into an eagle or some wonderful bird.

811
01:09:37,803 --> 01:09:41,765
So that I can fly free with the wind.

812
01:09:44,184 --> 01:09:48,230
Hover over my house
and shit on her head.

813
01:09:48,856 --> 01:09:53,235
Stop talking like that.
-I can't help it. I'm pissed!

814
01:09:55,028 --> 01:09:59,199
I became a lawyer because I wanted
to fight injustice. I wanted to help

815
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:02,744
the little guy against the big guy.
-Big guy!

816
01:10:02,828 --> 01:10:06,999
Instead I wound up representing
powerful rich people like you.

817
01:10:07,958 --> 01:10:12,004
But now, you see, you're a pauper!
You're bilked out of what's rightfully

818
01:10:12,129 --> 01:10:16,508
yours by Miss Terry Hoskins, who is
today one of the wealthiest women

819
01:10:16,925 --> 01:10:21,388
in the State of California.
And you wanna be a bird?

820
01:10:21,388 --> 01:10:25,475
Forget it!
Don't go soft on me now.

821
01:10:25,559 --> 01:10:29,521
Oh, it's no that. It's just that
offering you your freedom is the first

822
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:33,275
unselfish thing I've ever done.
-How's it feel?

823
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:37,029
Oh, wonderful.
-You're ok, Edwina.

824
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:39,656
Give me the number of the
Fulton Norris orchestra, please.

825
01:11:08,644 --> 01:11:12,481
Dad, you don't have to do that.
You're not an employee any more.

826
01:11:12,606 --> 01:11:16,568
Someone's gotta do it.
-I'll hire someone. Pack your things.

827
01:11:16,568 --> 01:11:20,739
You're moving up to the house.
No, I won't. It's not right!

828
01:11:20,739 --> 01:11:24,701
Yes, you will. I won't have people
saying my father lives in a stable.

829
01:11:24,785 --> 01:11:28,872
I bought you a tuxedo. You're coming
to the party tonight. And take a bath!

830
01:11:28,956 --> 01:11:33,252
You know, you're nicer to that horse
than you are to people?

831
01:11:33,335 --> 01:11:37,840
Why don't you take him to your party?
-lf it were appropiate to me I would!

832
01:11:40,551 --> 01:11:44,596
Oh, you're lucky you're a gelding.
-Snap it up, guys. Thank you.

833
01:11:44,721 --> 01:11:48,767
Smile, please. Oh, and if you have
to winkie let's do it now.

834
01:11:48,892 --> 01:11:53,772
They have a full rehearsal
in 5 minutes.

835
01:11:56,608 --> 01:12:00,779
Come on. Come on. Come on!
-Come on.

836
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:06,910
How you plan on pullin' this off?
-Beats the heck outta me.

837
01:12:07,035 --> 01:12:10,873
Well, if I can be of any help at all,
you in worse trouble than I thought.

838
01:12:10,998 --> 01:12:14,126
That's right.

839
01:12:17,337 --> 01:12:21,633
That's more fun than being a lawyer.
-I know.

840
01:12:21,633 --> 01:12:25,470
I think you should forget the law
and become a muscian full time.

841
01:12:25,596 --> 01:12:29,641
Oh, it's a nice dream, but I can't.
-There's nothing sadder than

842
01:12:29,766 --> 01:12:33,812
Iooking back at the end of your life
and saying, "l didn't do it right".

843
01:12:33,937 --> 01:12:38,108
And believe me, I know.
-Yeah. Oh, my solo's coming up.

844
01:12:38,108 --> 01:12:42,279
Can you give me control of my hand?
-Sure.

845
01:12:50,287 --> 01:12:53,957
I'm sorry again.

846
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:58,128
Is this some sort of a joke?
-You didn't like that?

847
01:13:01,548 --> 01:13:05,511
Listen, I'll be ok.
I just need a minute.

848
01:13:05,636 --> 01:13:09,598
Ok, gentlemen, let's take a break.
-Who are those guys?

849
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:13,769
Bring the bowl. Come on.
-The bowl.

850
01:13:14,603 --> 01:13:18,982
You know, your friend's a real freak.
-Thank you.

851
01:13:22,194 --> 01:13:25,239
See you in the mornin'.

852
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:29,409
I'm gonna put on a bloody tuxedo.

853
01:13:35,457 --> 01:13:38,794
Prakha! Now!

854
01:13:44,925 --> 01:13:47,135
Good boy.

855
01:13:50,681 --> 01:13:53,392
Oh! Edwina?

856
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:57,563
Oh!

857
01:14:00,482 --> 01:14:04,444
Ok! Miss Hoskins!
-Hoskins.

858
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:12,244
Grab that bowl!

859
01:14:12,244 --> 01:14:16,331
Grab that bowl!
-Stop it! Let go!

860
01:14:30,512 --> 01:14:34,474
Edwina in bowl?
-Edwina.

861
01:14:35,601 --> 01:14:39,271
Where's Edwina?
-Edwina.

862
01:14:39,771 --> 01:14:41,857
Edwina in water?
-Edwina.

863
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:46,570
You just made a big mistake, Buster!
Guards! Guards!

864
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:51,366
Put Edwina back in the bowl?
-Back in bowl.

865
01:14:51,366 --> 01:14:55,329
Yes, back in bowl. Yes, back in bowl.
-Back in bowl. Nyhm.

866
01:14:55,329 --> 01:14:59,374
Nyhm? Whatta you mean?

867
01:14:59,499 --> 01:15:03,045
Oh, you have to fix the bowl?
-Fix bowl.

868
01:15:03,128 --> 01:15:05,130
Fix bowl.
-Fix bowl.

869
01:15:05,214 --> 01:15:09,301
You put Edwina back in bowl.
-Back in bowl.

870
01:15:09,384 --> 01:15:13,889
Edwina back in bowl. Go fix bowl.
Go fix bowl. Go, go, go!

871
01:15:14,306 --> 01:15:18,268
Edwina, if you can hear me
blow some bubbles or something.

872
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:21,813
I'm talking to a bucket!

873
01:15:21,897 --> 01:15:26,068
Get that bucket! Get that bucket!
Don't let him get away!

874
01:15:52,135 --> 01:15:55,055
Ty, feel this.
-What is it?

875
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:58,183
Take good care of it!
-What is it?

876
01:15:58,308 --> 01:16:02,354
It's very, very special.
-No problem.

877
01:16:15,284 --> 01:16:19,663
Hey, where are you going
with that green bucket?

878
01:16:24,793 --> 01:16:27,379
Get out of my way!

879
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:36,138
Oh! Shit!

880
01:16:43,437 --> 01:16:47,608
Oh! Damn!
-It's all right.

881
01:16:50,861 --> 01:16:52,821
No!

882
01:16:54,823 --> 01:16:58,994
Want us to throw him out, ma'am?
-No, he's harmless.

883
01:17:18,597 --> 01:17:21,600
Goodbye, Edwina.

884
01:17:23,602 --> 01:17:24,728
Good evening.
-Miss Hoskins?

885
01:17:24,728 --> 01:17:28,690
Mr. Mifflin! Mr. Schuyler.
We have rather a pleasant orchestra.

886
01:17:28,815 --> 01:17:32,027
Daddy, how debonaire.

887
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:39,868
Oh, good evening. I'm Terry Hoskins.
Welcome to Hoskins Manor.

888
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:43,080
"All of me. Why not take all of me.

889
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:53,924
Can't you see.
I'm not good without..."

890
01:18:12,818 --> 01:18:16,655
God rest her wonderful soul.
I'll never forget her.

891
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:20,826
Just remember how comforting it'll be
to look around this magnificent home

892
01:18:20,951 --> 01:18:24,997
and always see a little bit
of Edwina in everything.

893
01:18:25,122 --> 01:18:29,168
Yes. Especially the flower bed.
-Yes.

894
01:18:36,175 --> 01:18:40,345
Ty, I thought I had everything
under control.

895
01:18:40,429 --> 01:18:44,600
I'm sorry, man. I didn't see her
grab the pitcher.

896
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:48,770
You know what I'm sayin'?
-It's not your fault, Ty.

897
01:18:49,104 --> 01:18:53,150
Oh, man, I feel empty.

898
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:57,654
You know, I know this sounds crazy,
but I actually miss the old girl.

899
01:18:57,738 --> 01:19:01,408
Who are you calling an old girl?

900
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:05,579
It's no funny... Ty!
-I'm not trying to be funny,

901
01:19:05,996 --> 01:19:07,873
you peasant!
-Edwina?

902
01:19:08,081 --> 01:19:11,710
No, it's Pearl Bailey.
Who the hell do you think it is?

903
01:19:11,835 --> 01:19:15,464
Oh, Edwina!
-Hey, hey, that's my side, stupid!

904
01:19:15,464 --> 01:19:19,134
I'm over here!
-What are you doing in Ty?

905
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:23,305
How should I know? I see nothing!
-Man, when you set that pitcher down

906
01:19:23,305 --> 01:19:27,476
here and said take care of it,
I thought it was gin and I drank some.

907
01:19:27,476 --> 01:19:32,064
But why didn't you say something?
-I wanted to see if you missed me.

908
01:19:32,898 --> 01:19:37,069
Cute, cute, cute. Oh, God!
Come on, Ty, come on. Come on!

909
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:41,240
Hey, Bix.

910
01:19:45,202 --> 01:19:47,162
Prakha?
-Fix bowl.

911
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:52,084
Ah, fix bowl. Great.
-Edwina in water?

912
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:56,547
Edwina not in water. Say something.
-Your Holiness, it is l,

913
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,634
Edwina Cutwater.
-Edwina?

914
01:20:00,717 --> 01:20:04,888
Yes.
-I fail to see humor in the situation.

915
01:20:04,888 --> 01:20:08,767
He drink her.
Drink her?

916
01:20:09,268 --> 01:20:13,438
He drink her.
-lf it hat not been for Mr. Wattell,

917
01:20:13,438 --> 01:20:17,609
I'd be Edwina the Flower Bed
right now, you big dope!

918
01:20:17,609 --> 01:20:21,780
Big dope!
-Look, look! Take Edwina out,

919
01:20:22,322 --> 01:20:25,742
put back in me.
-ln me.

920
01:20:25,868 --> 01:20:28,036
Ok?
-Ok.

921
01:20:28,161 --> 01:20:31,999
Really?
-It's the only safe place.

922
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:37,212
Oh, you really are my friend.
-I sure hope nobody else can see this.

923
01:20:39,715 --> 01:20:41,925
Ok.

924
01:20:47,848 --> 01:20:52,019
Good night. We're in the Roosevelt.
-lf you need anything you call Grace.

925
01:20:52,144 --> 01:20:55,981
Good night.
-Good night.

926
01:20:56,106 --> 01:20:59,943
Ty, you gotta get back on the bus.
-Oh, no way, Jose, I gotta find out

927
01:21:00,068 --> 01:21:03,071
how this megillah ends.
-Ty!

928
01:21:03,197 --> 01:21:08,410
Besides I can be of help. Walkin'
around in the dark is my territory.

929
01:21:08,619 --> 01:21:10,579
Ok, you're hired.
-Thank you.

930
01:21:10,704 --> 01:21:15,792
Oh, God! This way.
-What kind o' seein' eye dog is this?

931
01:21:16,752 --> 01:21:21,006
You hang back here.
-Hang back here.

932
01:21:35,729 --> 01:21:39,983
Hi, Sailor.
-Are you having a good time?

933
01:21:40,108 --> 01:21:45,197
Yeah, I am. I hope I have as much fun
in my new body as I've had in yours.

934
01:21:46,573 --> 01:21:48,325
Thanks.

935
01:21:52,621 --> 01:21:56,250
There she is.
-Roger, now that you know what

936
01:21:56,250 --> 01:22:00,629
a horrible person she is, aren't you
glad you weren't intimate with her?

937
01:22:07,636 --> 01:22:11,682
I thank my lucky stars.
-I'm glad you said that.

938
01:22:12,224 --> 01:22:16,478
I've been thinking.
If things work out

939
01:22:17,104 --> 01:22:21,483
you just might get another chance.
-Oh, Edwina Cutwater!

940
01:22:25,779 --> 01:22:28,991
That's our cue.

941
01:22:32,536 --> 01:22:36,290
Let's go.
-Let's go.

942
01:22:48,093 --> 01:22:51,930
Ty, watch your head. Sssh!

943
01:22:52,264 --> 01:22:56,435
Come on, Prakha, come on, come on.
Bix, go outside, go on.

944
01:22:56,935 --> 01:23:00,689
Go on. Prakha, take care o' Ty.
-Ty.

945
01:23:00,814 --> 01:23:04,234
Take care of Ty.
-Ty.

946
01:23:18,123 --> 01:23:21,126
Sssh! Sssh! Sssh!
-Sssh! Sssh! Sssh!

947
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:37,809
Oh!
-Hello, darling!

948
01:23:38,018 --> 01:23:42,606
Whatta you waitin' for, grab her!
Watch out! I think she's got a gun.

949
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:46,485
Let's all take a nice little
walk now, shall we?

950
01:23:46,568 --> 01:23:50,239
Where we goin'?
-Sh, don't wake up the other guests.

951
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:54,493
What are you going to do?
-You sneaked back in here to rob me.

952
01:23:54,618 --> 01:23:58,872
Oh, we in trouble, Roger.
-You took the gun from my night table.

953
01:23:58,872 --> 01:24:03,043
Big trouble.
-You led me to a quiet room.

954
01:24:03,043 --> 01:24:07,339
This is what I shall say. Get in here!
-How do you expect to get away?

955
01:24:07,339 --> 01:24:11,176
I'll just tell the truth. You brought
me to this room, we struggled,

956
01:24:11,301 --> 01:24:15,264
I grabbed the gun.
-What the hell is going on?

957
01:24:15,347 --> 01:24:19,434
Watch out! Sounds like a gunshot!
Somebody's fighting now, Roger.

958
01:24:19,518 --> 01:24:22,980
Sombody just knocked over
some furniture.

959
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:27,568
Sounds like an end table
with chock keys on it, Roger.

960
01:24:27,568 --> 01:24:30,904
It's ok now. It's all over.
Who won?

961
01:24:30,904 --> 01:24:34,032
We did, Ty.
-I'm calling the police!

962
01:24:34,032 --> 01:24:38,203
Good idea. Who's that?
-No, don't! I won't go back to jail!

963
01:24:38,203 --> 01:24:41,331
Back to jail?
-Who's going back to jail?

964
01:24:41,331 --> 01:24:45,294
Terry? What about all these people?
-Get me the police.

965
01:24:45,294 --> 01:24:49,464
Police?
-Attempted homicide. 2 counts, maybe.

966
01:24:49,673 --> 01:24:54,469
No, that'll be her third conciction!
-Third conviction?

967
01:24:54,469 --> 01:24:58,640
You're a 3 time lost. You'll go into
the slammer. They throw away the key.

968
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:03,437
I promise I'll kill myself first!
-She would, you know.

969
01:25:03,437 --> 01:25:07,608
Police? Burton Schuyler. I want to
report an attempted homicide!

970
01:25:07,608 --> 01:25:11,987
Yes, I'm over here...
-Stop! Miss Cutwater?

971
01:25:12,487 --> 01:25:16,658
Yes?
-My body will go to jail, too.

972
01:25:22,414 --> 01:25:26,585
Hang up, Schuyler.
-I'll make a deal with you.

973
01:25:47,314 --> 01:25:49,316
Terry!
-Terry...

974
01:25:49,399 --> 01:25:53,987
Oh, my Lord, that was powerful.
-Edwina!

975
01:25:54,112 --> 01:25:55,239
Roger!

976
01:25:56,406 --> 01:26:00,994
It worked. It really worked.
-ls Terry in there, too?

977
01:26:04,331 --> 01:26:07,251
She's gone.

978
01:26:14,341 --> 01:26:16,635
Terry?

979
01:26:19,221 --> 01:26:23,392
Are you shure this is what you want,
honey bun?

980
01:26:24,852 --> 01:26:28,939
Thank you, ma'am. I don't know I will
explain this to her probation officer,

981
01:26:29,022 --> 01:26:32,568
but thank you.
-That's quite all right, Fred.

982
01:26:32,693 --> 01:26:36,738
Come on, baby. I'm gonna fix you
a nice private stable

983
01:26:36,864 --> 01:26:40,409
and never leave Daddy again.

984
01:26:40,492 --> 01:26:44,663
No more thieving, no more swindling
just runnin' and prancin'

985
01:26:44,663 --> 01:26:49,251
and jumpin' for the rest of your life.

986
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:36,924
So, how do you feel?
-Alive and happy...

987
01:27:39,092 --> 01:27:42,554
and scared.
-Why?

988
01:27:42,846 --> 01:27:47,434
Because I finally got
what I always wanted,

989
01:27:47,559 --> 01:27:52,773
and I've no excuses any more.
-Yeah. Welcome to the real world.

990
01:27:56,944 --> 01:27:59,446
What?
-Tingles.

991
01:27:59,446 --> 01:28:04,034
I hope you try it more often.
-ls that advice from my lawyer?

992
01:28:04,034 --> 01:28:07,996
I'm no lawyer. I'm a musician.
-You are?

993
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:12,167
I had more feelings in the last 2 days
than in the last ten years in office!

994
01:28:12,251 --> 01:28:17,464
Those papers stacked up to height
and that flourescent lighting burning

995
01:28:17,589 --> 01:28:21,635
off all my vitamins. Unlike you, most
of us only get around once in life,

996
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,806
and I'm not going to spend the rest
of my mine sitting behind a desk.

997
01:28:26,014 --> 01:28:30,185
Oh, you talk like a beer commercial.
-Hey, let's dance.

998
01:28:32,813 --> 01:28:35,816
I don't know how.
-Oh, it's easy.

999
01:28:36,441 --> 01:28:40,112
Now, ut your feet on top of mine.
Come on.

1000
01:28:40,195 --> 01:28:44,575
This is how kids learn how to dance.
See?

1001
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:48,453
Try it with your own feet.

1002
01:29:06,805 --> 01:29:11,059
All of me.
Why not take all of me?

1003
01:29:13,562 --> 01:29:18,150
Can't you see,
I'm no good without you.

1004
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:24,406
Take my lips.
I wanna lose them.

1005
01:29:26,825 --> 01:29:31,079
Take my arms.
I'll never use them.

1006
01:29:33,498 --> 01:29:37,753
Your Goodbye
left me with eyes that cry.

1007
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:44,551
Now can l
go on, Dear, without you.

1008
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:50,891
You took the part
that once was my heart.

1009
01:29:53,185 --> 01:29:57,564
So why not take all of me?

1010
01:29:57,564 --> 01:30:02,069
Why not take all of me?

1011
01:30:03,529 --> 01:30:07,699
Take all of me.
Can't you see.

1012
01:30:08,951 --> 01:30:13,330
I'm no good without you.

1013
01:30:13,747 --> 01:30:17,918
Take my lips.
I wanna loose them.

1014
01:30:20,003 --> 01:30:24,174
And take my arms.
I'll never use them.

1015
01:30:27,094 --> 01:30:31,473
Your Goodbye
left me with eyes that cry.

1016
01:30:34,184 --> 01:30:38,772
How can l
go on, Dear, without you.

1017
01:30:40,649 --> 01:30:45,028
You took the part
that once was my heart.

1018
01:30:46,697 --> 01:30:50,868
So why not take all of me?
