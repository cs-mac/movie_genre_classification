00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
SUPER HYBRID (2010)

2
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,851
(heartbeat)

3
00:03:16,498 --> 00:03:19,048
(distorted voices)

4
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:24,997
- (people chattering)
- (distant rock music playing)

5
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:29,497
(music plays louder)

6
00:03:29,498 --> 00:03:32,495
(two men chattering)

7
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:35,647
Allison?
She just doesn't do it for me.

8
00:03:37,296 --> 00:03:39,396
I don't see you
strolling out of there

9
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:40,995
with three hotties
on each arm.

10
00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:42,995
[Man #2]:
I got Jessica's digits.

11
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:44,696
[Man]:
No, you didn't.

12
00:03:44,697 --> 00:03:47,095
She left her number
on a napkin on the bar.

13
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:49,896
Yeah, and I got it.
You're just jealous.

14
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,694
Yeah, Jessica...
are you sure that was a girl?

15
00:03:52,695 --> 00:03:56,394
Well, she did have a pretty deep voice,
now that you mention it.

16
00:03:56,395 --> 00:03:57,994
I wasn't the only one
who took her number.

17
00:03:57,995 --> 00:04:00,092
Did you see the size
of her hands?

18
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:01,894
Yeah, she was...

19
00:04:01,895 --> 00:04:05,293
(sloshing sound)

20
00:04:05,294 --> 00:04:07,794
Holy shit.

21
00:04:07,795 --> 00:04:10,692
Oh, listening to your crap
almost made me miss it.

22
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:12,194
Dude, don't.

23
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:14,592
Don't.

24
00:04:14,593 --> 00:04:16,143
Dude.

25
00:04:18,193 --> 00:04:20,243
Just leave the car alone.

26
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:22,893
Oh, shut up.

27
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:25,342
Check this.
There's keys.

28
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,042
Hey, man, just get in the car.

29
00:04:30,492 --> 00:04:33,390
Dude, wait. I bet you
this is some sort of setup.

30
00:04:33,391 --> 00:04:35,291
- I bet there's some cops down the all...
- You bet your ass it is.

31
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:37,590
Some rich dude needs
insurance money,

32
00:04:37,591 --> 00:04:40,942
parks it here, leaves the keys...
boom. Gone.

33
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:44,642
You want to disappoint
that guy?

34
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:48,940
(laughs) Whoo!

35
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,388
What the hell? My door just...

36
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:56,889
(gulping sound)

37
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,888
What the...?

38
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:01,540
Where's the ignition?

39
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,288
No, it's probably one of those cars
without any...

40
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:05,438
No, man, it's gone.

41
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,887
Dude, the door...

42
00:05:09,888 --> 00:05:12,787
dude, I told you
we shouldn't have done this.

43
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:14,487
Why'd you talk me into this?

44
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,586
Just... dude, I can't...

45
00:05:16,587 --> 00:05:18,587
I can't get out either.

46
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:20,837
(both screaming)

47
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:31,636
(screaming)

48
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:37,735
(sloshing sound)

49
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:50,328
(tires screech)

50
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,427
(siren wailing)

51
00:07:08,477 --> 00:07:11,275
Stand back. Stand back.

52
00:07:11,276 --> 00:07:13,576
We've got a two-car collision.

53
00:07:13,577 --> 00:07:16,226
10-52.

54
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:20,227
(police radio chatter)

55
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,926
(distant sirens wailing)

56
00:07:29,776 --> 00:07:31,874
- (high-pitched squeal)
- What was that?

57
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,072
[Man]:
Don't know.

58
00:07:34,073 --> 00:07:36,725
Nobody could have
gotten out of here alive.

59
00:08:05,172 --> 00:08:06,770
Sorry, man,
but we're remodeling.

60
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:08,771
We're not taking any more cars
until we're finished.

61
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:10,170
Come on, man.

62
00:08:10,171 --> 00:08:11,870
I got, like, 10 minutes left
in my shift.

63
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:14,070
Don't make me haul this thing
all the way across town.

64
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:15,970
[Mechanic]: At least
you're getting home soon.

65
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:17,469
I'm pulling a double shift here.

66
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,570
[Driver]: Yeah, but I'm guessing
you don't got a pregnant wife

67
00:08:19,571 --> 00:08:21,720
waiting for you at home.

68
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,069
Okay, man. And consider it a present
to your last days of freedom.

69
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,118
All right.
Thanks a lot.

70
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:40,566
 Now I gotta play for real... 

71
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:44,718
(hip-hop song continues)

72
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:47,267
 I'm telling you, I'm telling you 

73
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:51,216
 Now you're gonna know the deal 

74
00:08:52,468 --> 00:08:54,966
 Yo, I'm telling you 

75
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,117
 I'm telling you, I'm telling you... 

76
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:04,865
David.

77
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:07,265
David, have you seen my locket?

78
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:09,165
Hold on, Til.

79
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,316
Well...

80
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:14,916
(turns off music)

81
00:09:18,664 --> 00:09:21,263
Locket, locket.

82
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:23,063
The one your mom gave you?

83
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:25,415
Yeah. Yeah.

84
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:32,462
What's the big hurry?

85
00:09:32,463 --> 00:09:35,112
Some of us have a job.

86
00:09:36,364 --> 00:09:41,414
And feel free to grab some groceries
if you get a second, hmm?

87
00:09:44,862 --> 00:09:46,460
Okay, bye.

88
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,562
Oh, and don't call me
tonight, okay?

89
00:09:48,563 --> 00:09:50,560
Ray wants to start docking us
for personal calls.

90
00:09:50,561 --> 00:09:52,362
Yeah, well, I can't reach you
on your cell phone either.

91
00:09:52,363 --> 00:09:55,960
Yeah, I work in a concrete box.
What can I do?

92
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:57,661
Hey, Til, speaking of work,

93
00:09:57,662 --> 00:09:59,760
when are you gonna cut
yourself loose from that place?

94
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:02,059
I mean, the promotion... what was that,
like, three weeks ago?

95
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,260
Those grease monkeys
don't deserve you.

96
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:06,411
I...

97
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,410
Yeah.

98
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:16,558
You know, David, there's a lot of jobs
that don't involve your back.

99
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,159
Yeah, I know, but my back hurts
even when I'm doing nothing, so...

100
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,808
Well, they've stopped
paying you for that.

101
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,858
Hey, Til, what's the word
on my wheels?

102
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:33,157
I can't go to interviews
without it.

103
00:10:33,158 --> 00:10:35,407
The bus makes me sweat.

104
00:10:35,457 --> 00:10:39,408
Yeah, I'm working on it.
I'll see you in the morning.

105
00:11:00,555 --> 00:11:02,605
(dispatch radio chatter)

106
00:11:14,353 --> 00:11:16,354
Before you become a millionaire,

107
00:11:16,355 --> 00:11:18,852
would you be so kind as to organize
this pile of shit?

108
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:22,052
Insurance won't cover any files
lost during construction.

109
00:11:22,053 --> 00:11:23,652
And I'm not taking the blame.

110
00:11:23,653 --> 00:11:26,352
Enough with the scratched-CD routine,
Ray. I got it.

111
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,052
Yeah? Then how is it
not done by now?

112
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:31,903
You know, I am just praying that you get
that supervising job in Imperial.

113
00:11:31,953 --> 00:11:34,202
Be careful what you wish for.

114
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:38,802
(toy squeaks)

115
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,901
(sloshing sound)

116
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:24,397
(exhales)

117
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:27,898
I've got to see an eye doctor.

118
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:43,196
(car moving)

119
00:13:11,843 --> 00:13:15,894
The dumbass doesn't know enough
to put on the parking brake?

120
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:32,491
(screams)

121
00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:37,392
(grunting)

122
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:53,188
- (tires screech)
- (screams)

123
00:14:08,637 --> 00:14:11,088
(rock music playing on radio)

124
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:19,535
You think when they remodel
we'll get a little reception in here?

125
00:14:19,536 --> 00:14:21,237
Why? Who are you trying to call?

126
00:14:21,238 --> 00:14:24,536
Anybody.

127
00:14:24,537 --> 00:14:26,887
(dispatch radio chatter)

128
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:32,487
Hey, Gordy, where's Hector?

129
00:14:33,936 --> 00:14:36,734
And we're off.

130
00:14:36,735 --> 00:14:38,834
- (chuckles)
- [Ray]: I can see you guys.

131
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:41,333
Bobby, tell Gordy to put his ears
back on

132
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:42,783
and answer the damn intercom.

133
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:53,482
He's looking for Hector.

134
00:14:55,034 --> 00:14:58,332
Gee golly, sorry, Sarge.

135
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,833
He's not on this level,

136
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:02,432
but I'm going to get Al
to go look for him.

137
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:04,730
[Ray]: Oh great. The retarded
leading the retarded.

138
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:07,431
Listen, Hector was supposed to have
all the newer models...

139
00:15:07,432 --> 00:15:09,331
moved to the Imperial facility
by yesterday.

140
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:11,731
I still see a couple up here.
What about down there?

141
00:15:11,732 --> 00:15:14,230
No, we're pretty much
cleared out here.

142
00:15:14,231 --> 00:15:16,232
We're just working on
some old inventory.

143
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:19,330
[Ray]: Bobby,
study on your own time.

144
00:15:19,331 --> 00:15:23,281
- (intercom squeals)
- Oh gee.

145
00:15:27,632 --> 00:15:29,130
Do you mind, Al?

146
00:15:29,131 --> 00:15:30,628
Mind what?

147
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,030
Stay with me, brother.
You going to find Hector.

148
00:15:33,031 --> 00:15:37,228
Oh, okay, you mean that's what...?
Yeah, I'm going.

149
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:39,480
(laughs)

150
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:44,129
Oh yeah.

151
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,228
Give me some cars to move.

152
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:49,828
Yeah? Well, knock yourself out.

153
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:52,027
- Level 3 still needs to be cleared.
- Got you.

154
00:15:52,028 --> 00:15:55,179
Keys are in the ignition.
Have a good time. Hey.

155
00:15:56,627 --> 00:15:58,826
Do you know if Til's
coming in tonight?

156
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:03,876
Yeah, as soon as she can
tear her lips away from you-know-who.

157
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:38,975
It's about time
to get this place fixed.

158
00:16:41,524 --> 00:16:44,023
Hey, Tilda, you're almost late.

159
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:46,522
Sorry, I...

160
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:49,923
By the way,

161
00:16:49,924 --> 00:16:52,422
I catch your nephew studying
on the job again,

162
00:16:52,423 --> 00:16:54,221
and he's out of here, all right?

163
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,022
You got him this gig.
You make sure he keeps it.

164
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:58,072
Yeah, I got it, Ray.

165
00:16:59,221 --> 00:17:01,621
Hey, Maria, how are you doing?

166
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:04,020
Oh, I just won the Quick Pick
for a million dollars.

167
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:05,519
But I thought I'd finish
my shift.

168
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,320
Yeah. What is it
about this place?

169
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:10,019
I don't know.

170
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,720
Say, I think I lost my necklace... the
one with the locket. Have you seen it?

171
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:15,319
No, sorry,
but I'll keep my eyes peeled.

172
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,619
It's cool. I think
I just left it here yesterday.

173
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,918
Hector, where the heck are you?

174
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:23,319
Looks like Ray's meds
have kicked in tonight.

175
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,818
- [Ray]: Hector.
- Yeah, a huge improvement.

176
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,570
[Ray]: Hector.

177
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,768
Hector.

178
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,468
Yo, Hector.
Come on, man, where are you?

179
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:42,416
Oh Hector.

180
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:45,517
Where are you?

181
00:17:45,518 --> 00:17:49,666
Yo, Hector man, come on.
Everybody's looking for you.

182
00:17:53,716 --> 00:17:57,167
Okay, ha ha. You got me.
You can kill the lights now.

183
00:17:58,717 --> 00:17:59,866
Hector.

184
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:04,166
Come on, wake up, man.

185
00:18:21,814 --> 00:18:23,214
(screams)

186
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:25,213
(laughs)

187
00:18:25,214 --> 00:18:27,212
What are you doing, buddy?

188
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:28,814
I'm looking for Hector.

189
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:30,712
But Hector ain't in there.

190
00:18:30,713 --> 00:18:32,312
Did you look hard enough?

191
00:18:32,313 --> 00:18:34,313
Maybe next time.

192
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,112
- Is this...?
- I'm going back.

193
00:18:36,113 --> 00:18:39,313
Is this the car
from this morning?

194
00:18:39,314 --> 00:18:41,662
I don't know. Ask Hector.

195
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:55,109
Going to the store isn't
going to hurt your back, David.

196
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,561
Maria, punch up L3,
will you?

197
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:59,309
Okay, you know what?
I have to go.

198
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,510
No, I'll ask, but... yes.
No, I love you.

199
00:19:02,511 --> 00:19:04,908
Aww, I love you too.
Isn't that sweet?

200
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:06,708
- David...
- We don't get that enough around here.

201
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:07,709
Just one second.

202
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,909
What did I tell you
about using the phone?

203
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,908
Okay, I gotta go. Bye.

204
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:14,659
(dispatch radio chatter)

205
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:21,907
(toy squeaks)

206
00:19:21,908 --> 00:19:24,059
You know I could sue
for harassment, right?

207
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:26,607
And did you know
that there's a regulation...

208
00:19:26,608 --> 00:19:29,308
secretaries only get
a 10-minute lunch break?

209
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:31,658
'Cause if it was any longer,
then you'd have to retrain them.

210
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:38,306
Hey, down on L3,
what the heck's going on down there?

211
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:42,206
Hey, when you see Hector,
you send him up here right away.

212
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:46,257
Yeah, sure. Listen, can I work
on David's car tonight?

213
00:19:49,305 --> 00:19:51,006
Of course, sweetheart.

214
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:54,155
What you do during your lunch break
is up to you.

215
00:19:55,305 --> 00:19:57,805
I'm serious.

216
00:19:57,806 --> 00:20:00,604
You drive off into the sunset
with loser...

217
00:20:00,605 --> 00:20:02,404
I mean lover boy.

218
00:20:02,405 --> 00:20:03,604
Right.

219
00:20:03,605 --> 00:20:07,102
Listen, we've got a shitload of work
to do before the night's out.

220
00:20:07,103 --> 00:20:10,103
All these cars have got to be moved
and cleared for the painters next week.

221
00:20:10,104 --> 00:20:11,502
- Okay.
- You can start by giving me

222
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:13,104
an inventory
of what's left on L3,

223
00:20:13,105 --> 00:20:14,902
- on the double.
- Yes, sir.

224
00:20:14,903 --> 00:20:16,202
- On the double.
- (mouths)

225
00:20:16,203 --> 00:20:17,852
Yes, sir.

226
00:20:26,002 --> 00:20:29,051
(gate whirring)

227
00:20:41,702 --> 00:20:44,999
What do you mean, you don't know
what kind of car it is?

228
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,500
Take a look.

229
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:48,199
Okay, but I should warn you,

230
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,099
the last car I couldn't make
model and year on,

231
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,899
I was 15, and that was the 1914
customized...

232
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,598
...'14 customizable Asco Bufera.

233
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:56,851
Yeah. Thanks.

234
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,398
That's what I thought.

235
00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:02,998
(heartbeat)

236
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:04,598
Aunt Tilda,

237
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,897
tell me there isn't something
seriously weird about this car.

238
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,398
First off, Bobby,
enough with the "aunt" stuff, okay?

239
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:10,798
I'm not old enough
to be your aunt.

240
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,796
But you are my aunt.

241
00:21:12,797 --> 00:21:14,798
That's not the point.

242
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,196
As far as everyone's concerned,
we're just cousins.

243
00:21:18,197 --> 00:21:19,997
Got it?

244
00:21:19,998 --> 00:21:22,196
- (distorted) Got it.
- Now what's all the fuss?

245
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,448
You should tell us, Auntie.

246
00:21:26,697 --> 00:21:28,595
That's some paint job.

247
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:30,647
(gasps)

248
00:21:31,497 --> 00:21:34,945
Doesn't feel metallic.

249
00:21:38,495 --> 00:21:40,796
But it's not fiberglass.

250
00:21:40,797 --> 00:21:42,495
Hmm.

251
00:21:42,496 --> 00:21:46,046
Where's...? I don't...
there's no Bondo.

252
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:52,994
That side panel...
that's a factory part.

253
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:56,643
It's '76 or '77.

254
00:21:59,394 --> 00:22:02,343
It lines up perfect.

255
00:22:03,894 --> 00:22:06,392
I mean, it's got to be
a standard part.

256
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:08,892
But it's not.

257
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:11,343
That's what I said.

258
00:22:11,393 --> 00:22:13,390
- Yeah, it's almost like a...
- Like what?

259
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:16,391
Well, it's almost like
you showed this model to somebody

260
00:22:16,392 --> 00:22:19,492
and they built a copy of it,
but it's like they did it by memory,

261
00:22:19,493 --> 00:22:23,789
because it's... it's almost right
until you look really close.

262
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,690
Who the hell would do
something like that?

263
00:22:26,691 --> 00:22:29,090
Al, where's Hector?

264
00:22:29,091 --> 00:22:31,090
Oh yeah, I was gonna go
look for him.

265
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:33,090
- Yeah.
- I'll go.

266
00:22:33,091 --> 00:22:35,388
[Bobby]:
See you, buddy.

267
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:37,540
Hmm.

268
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,340
It's still warm.

269
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,339
It can't be.

270
00:22:49,489 --> 00:22:51,638
They brought it in this morning.

271
00:22:58,189 --> 00:22:59,538
What?

272
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:02,737
Til?

273
00:23:05,888 --> 00:23:08,538
(low growling)

274
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:19,938
That's not like any engine
I've ever heard.

275
00:23:21,087 --> 00:23:24,784
It's more like listening to a...

276
00:23:24,785 --> 00:23:26,236
Let me get that for you.

277
00:23:30,184 --> 00:23:31,485
Pop it.

278
00:23:31,486 --> 00:23:34,434
Yeah. Let me try.

279
00:23:36,486 --> 00:23:37,784
(grunts)
You got it?

280
00:23:37,785 --> 00:23:39,534
Apparently not.

281
00:23:41,485 --> 00:23:43,235
Nothing.

282
00:23:46,183 --> 00:23:48,883
Okay, you know what?
Let's get a rig down here.

283
00:23:48,884 --> 00:23:52,232
We'll tow this baby up to L2, put it
on a lift and get a real look at it.

284
00:23:57,984 --> 00:24:02,880
Oh wait.
We're forgetting Hector and Al.

285
00:24:02,881 --> 00:24:04,482
- Til, I can get them for you.
- I'll get them.

286
00:24:04,483 --> 00:24:06,780
No no, you guys just go
upstairs, okay?

287
00:24:06,781 --> 00:24:09,382
I'll meet you up there.
Let's not start that again.

288
00:24:09,383 --> 00:24:12,132
All right.

289
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,274
[Tilda]: Al!

290
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:16,375
Hey, Til, come check this out.

291
00:25:16,376 --> 00:25:18,574
What... did you repark the car?

292
00:25:18,575 --> 00:25:19,673
No.

293
00:25:19,674 --> 00:25:22,075
What do you mean, no?
We just...

294
00:25:22,076 --> 00:25:23,673
Well, they... they just
kind of moved.

295
00:25:23,674 --> 00:25:26,974
Oh, okay, very funny.

296
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:29,324
Let's get it moved back
before Ray has a fit.

297
00:25:32,374 --> 00:25:35,223
(Al screaming)
- (creature screeching)

298
00:25:37,075 --> 00:25:39,472
- Tilda!
- Al! Al!

299
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:43,772
- Tilda, open up. Open up.
- Okay, come on.

300
00:25:43,773 --> 00:25:45,671
- Tilda!
- Al! Come on.

301
00:25:45,672 --> 00:25:47,973
- Tilda!
- Al! Al!

302
00:25:47,974 --> 00:25:50,922
Help! No! Al!

303
00:25:53,071 --> 00:25:55,422
- Let me out, Tilda.
- Hold on. Hold on.

304
00:25:57,771 --> 00:26:00,222
Let me out.

305
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:04,870
Al!

306
00:26:04,871 --> 00:26:07,070
Tilda!

307
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:08,669
Al!

308
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,370
Let me out!

309
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:14,320
(screams)

310
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:33,867
[Tilda]: Help!

311
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:36,267
Help!

312
00:26:36,268 --> 00:26:38,367
(dispatch radio chatter)

313
00:26:38,368 --> 00:26:40,817
(Tilda screaming in distance)

314
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:45,966
Stay here.

315
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:48,767
- (horn honking)
- Help! Help!

316
00:26:48,768 --> 00:26:50,917
Hey!

317
00:26:53,165 --> 00:26:55,466
[Ray]: Let's see
a show of hands...

318
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:58,764
who thinks Hector and Al...

319
00:26:58,765 --> 00:27:02,265
were killed by a man-eating car?

320
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:04,865
I'm not crazy, Ray.

321
00:27:04,866 --> 00:27:06,964
You think I'm an idiot? Huh?

322
00:27:06,965 --> 00:27:10,063
Al... oh, and Hector eaten?

323
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:13,115
Come on, you guys,
you're probably in on this.

324
00:27:14,664 --> 00:27:17,164
I'm not crazy.

325
00:27:17,165 --> 00:27:20,362
Ray, there... there was something
really weird about it.

326
00:27:20,363 --> 00:27:23,362
Oh, well, that's a far cry
from it looks like it might attack

327
00:27:23,363 --> 00:27:25,662
and devour a man,
Poindexter.

328
00:27:25,663 --> 00:27:28,662
Now I want to take a look
at this goddamn vehicle,

329
00:27:28,663 --> 00:27:31,361
whatever it is.

330
00:27:31,362 --> 00:27:33,362
- Ray, wait.
- Hey! Shut up, Tilda.

331
00:27:33,363 --> 00:27:35,362
- Don't.
- Al, Hector, get out here!

332
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:37,662
- Ray, don't. Listen to me.
- Don't listen to you?

333
00:27:37,663 --> 00:27:39,362
Finally something
that makes sense.

334
00:27:39,363 --> 00:27:41,360
Ray, you have to believe me.

335
00:27:41,361 --> 00:27:42,760
- Til.
- Gordy.

336
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:46,511
Til, don't... tell me this isn't
more to do with Lake Forest.

337
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:52,459
What are you talking about?

338
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,760
Nothing, all right?
Nothing, Sarge.

339
00:27:54,761 --> 00:27:57,459
Talk to me, Gordy.

340
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,560
Look, it's complicated, all right?

341
00:27:59,561 --> 00:28:02,510
Come on, spit it out.

342
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,059
She's had a rough time, all right?

343
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,858
Freshman year at school
she had to drop out.

344
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:11,910
She was having panic attacks,
thought some people were stalking her.

345
00:28:18,358 --> 00:28:20,757
Well, that explains
the raving antics.

346
00:28:20,758 --> 00:28:23,058
[Gordy]: Hey.

347
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:25,407
I'm not crazy.

348
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:28,757
All right, where is it? Hmm?

349
00:28:28,758 --> 00:28:31,456
Now what did you do
with the car?

350
00:28:31,457 --> 00:28:34,807
(creature screeching)

351
00:28:36,856 --> 00:28:39,007
What the hell was that?

352
00:28:52,055 --> 00:28:54,253
Al? Hector?

353
00:28:54,254 --> 00:28:57,405
You guys come out now,
before I bloody up the inside.

354
00:28:57,455 --> 00:29:00,754
Hey, does anybody hear a car engine?
'Cause I don't hear a car engine.

355
00:29:00,755 --> 00:29:02,653
Ray, just...

356
00:29:02,654 --> 00:29:05,454
Ray, Ray, get away from it.
Get away right now.

357
00:29:05,455 --> 00:29:08,653
Tilda, just because
you've got issues with cars...

358
00:29:08,654 --> 00:29:10,803
don't mean we all do.

359
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:15,702
This feels like the other car.

360
00:29:27,251 --> 00:29:30,351
Gordy, get a crowbar
from that toolbox.

361
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,549
We're gonna pop
this damn hood.

362
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:35,701
[Bobby]: You think
that's a good idea, Ray?

363
00:29:41,051 --> 00:29:44,302
Ray. Ray.

364
00:29:47,549 --> 00:29:49,801
Just listen.

365
00:29:55,351 --> 00:29:57,199
(heartbeat)

366
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,398
What the hell was that?

367
00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:05,597
All right, Gordy,

368
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:07,199
go ahead.

369
00:30:12,948 --> 00:30:14,598
(grunts)

370
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:21,197
- (screeching)
- (all shouting)

371
00:30:23,847 --> 00:30:25,597
Oh!

372
00:30:27,847 --> 00:30:29,996
(shouting)

373
00:30:33,045 --> 00:30:35,296
[Ray]:
Get to the stairs.

374
00:30:38,644 --> 00:30:41,595
- [Tilda]: Come on, Bobby.
- [Gordy]: Oh jeez.

375
00:30:43,245 --> 00:30:45,495
(all shouting)

376
00:30:47,744 --> 00:30:49,795
All right! Jeez!

377
00:30:53,243 --> 00:30:56,094
[Bobby]:
Come on, let's go.

378
00:31:04,342 --> 00:31:07,393
[Bobby]: Til, get outta there.
Come on, come on.

379
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:09,841
You have to jump.

380
00:31:09,842 --> 00:31:11,391
Jump!

381
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:16,991
Get up, get up.
Come on, get up.

382
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:19,891
Come on. Look out.

383
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:32,590
Look out.

384
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,290
Look out.

385
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:49,788
- (panting)
- (creature growling)

386
00:31:56,139 --> 00:31:59,836
What the hell
are we dealing with here? Huh?

387
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:01,638
Monsters?
How should I know?

388
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:05,436
All right, okay, okay, you were right,
all right? Take a medal.

389
00:32:05,437 --> 00:32:07,436
How many of them are there?

390
00:32:07,437 --> 00:32:10,135
One. It changes.

391
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,335
What? Come again?

392
00:32:11,336 --> 00:32:13,936
[Gordy]: It changes?
Like a shapeshifter.

393
00:32:13,937 --> 00:32:17,234
What, like... like one of those robots
from outer space?

394
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,235
I don't know where it's from.
But you saw underneath the hood.

395
00:32:20,236 --> 00:32:22,633
I mean, that thing's not a machine.
It's like it's...

396
00:32:22,634 --> 00:32:24,286
Alive.

397
00:32:24,336 --> 00:32:28,184
Right, where did it come from and what
the hell is it doing in my garage, huh?

398
00:32:33,934 --> 00:32:35,385
[Gordy]: Hey.

399
00:32:38,734 --> 00:32:40,633
Maybe that's what it does.

400
00:32:40,634 --> 00:32:42,433
What?

401
00:32:42,434 --> 00:32:44,731
Well, I studied this thing in school,
in marine biology...

402
00:32:44,732 --> 00:32:47,432
it was this kind of squid called

403
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,632
"parateuthis ennoculatas,"
something like that.

404
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:52,484
I mean, it could make itself
look like other things...

405
00:32:52,534 --> 00:32:54,531
like a shell, a rock, a piece of coral.

406
00:32:54,532 --> 00:32:56,633
A fish would come swimming by,

407
00:32:56,634 --> 00:32:59,031
see what looks to be
a nice, safe hiding place.

408
00:32:59,032 --> 00:33:01,932
In it goes, and it's lunch.

409
00:33:01,933 --> 00:33:05,730
Yeah, like some kind of giant
camouflaged squid.

410
00:33:05,731 --> 00:33:07,931
I mean, it looked
almost insectoid.

411
00:33:07,932 --> 00:33:10,981
I have no idea. Maybe...
maybe it's some sort of hybrid.

412
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,430
Thank you for the scientific
analysis, Newton,

413
00:33:14,431 --> 00:33:16,729
but who cares?

414
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,530
This thing could have been evolving
for millions of years.

415
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,929
Ray, what are you doing?

416
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:25,129
It could have been imitating a cave
or a hut by the side of the road.

417
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,728
Cars could be the latest form
that it takes.

418
00:33:27,729 --> 00:33:29,929
Cars can move.
They wouldn't have to wait for dinner.

419
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,878
They could...
they could become real hunters.

420
00:33:34,128 --> 00:33:36,979
Is that what you are? Huh?

421
00:33:38,228 --> 00:33:40,228
A hunter?

422
00:33:40,229 --> 00:33:41,828
- (air hisses)
- (screams)

423
00:33:52,428 --> 00:33:54,625
(pop song playing)

424
00:33:54,626 --> 00:33:56,778
(Maria humming)

425
00:34:02,227 --> 00:34:04,125
(tires screeching)

426
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,325
[Ray]:
Whoa, it's on the run.

427
00:34:06,326 --> 00:34:07,977
All right, hey hey,
it's getting away.

428
00:34:15,725 --> 00:34:18,023
No one's seen one of these
before, right?

429
00:34:18,024 --> 00:34:19,224
How would I know?

430
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:22,223
How do we know Area 51 doesn't have
a whole damn fleet of them?

431
00:34:22,224 --> 00:34:24,324
- What if we caught one?
- This isn't one of your trophy hunts,

432
00:34:24,325 --> 00:34:26,323
Ray, okay? This thing
has killed two people.

433
00:34:26,324 --> 00:34:28,723
Hey, we don't know that, okay?
We don't know what happened to Hector.

434
00:34:28,724 --> 00:34:30,523
Let's stick to the facts,
all right?

435
00:34:30,524 --> 00:34:32,323
Okay, we need to get help.
We're gonna call the precinct.

436
00:34:32,324 --> 00:34:34,421
Oh, hello, Officer.

437
00:34:34,422 --> 00:34:36,023
Yeah yeah,
we're in the garage here.

438
00:34:36,024 --> 00:34:37,722
We have a little situation.

439
00:34:37,723 --> 00:34:40,823
There's one of those "pentacoccus
innoculates" or whatever it is.

440
00:34:40,824 --> 00:34:42,972
It's on the loose and, uh...
well...

441
00:34:43,022 --> 00:34:45,620
oops, we got disconnected.

442
00:34:45,621 --> 00:34:48,121
Let's just say they find Al's
or Hector's body.

443
00:34:48,122 --> 00:34:50,621
There's no way in hell anybody
would believe us.

444
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:52,821
It's either death row
or the loony bin.

445
00:34:52,822 --> 00:34:55,420
Come on, guys, we could
vouch for each other, right?

446
00:34:55,421 --> 00:34:57,820
This is a big story, all right?

447
00:34:57,821 --> 00:35:00,220
It's a really big story.

448
00:35:00,221 --> 00:35:03,120
I bet you we could get, like,
$250,000 for this.

449
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:04,919
I mean, that's more
than $60,000 each.

450
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,120
$50,000 each. Maria.

451
00:35:09,121 --> 00:35:12,118
Yeah yeah, $50,000. Maria.

452
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,820
What are you talking about?

453
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:15,818
We're gonna trap this sucker.

454
00:35:15,819 --> 00:35:18,919
Anybody who doesn't want to participate
can go up to the office,

455
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,419
help Maria
with the crossword puzzle.

456
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,018
What's a five-letter word
for "loser"?

457
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,217
This is bullshit.

458
00:35:23,218 --> 00:35:25,118
If we work together,
we can catch it.

459
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,417
The elevator pit.

460
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:29,918
We could raise the car elevator.
The pit's almost 15' deep.

461
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,917
If we force it in there,
it'll be stuck.

462
00:35:32,918 --> 00:35:34,715
There you go. That's right.

463
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,017
All right, first thing...
we're gonna go up to L2.

464
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:39,267
We're gonna block off the ramp
leading down here, all right?

465
00:35:39,317 --> 00:35:40,917
Barricade it.
It'll be stuck down here.

466
00:35:40,918 --> 00:35:43,716
- Bobby, this is crazy.
- Til, this could work.

467
00:35:43,717 --> 00:35:45,714
Gordy.

468
00:35:45,715 --> 00:35:47,916
There's no stopping him
when he gets an idea, Til.

469
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:49,515
That's right, baby.
Let's go.

470
00:35:49,516 --> 00:35:51,867
Come on, let's go.

471
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,614
Hey, listen, somebody needs
to stay down here

472
00:35:55,615 --> 00:35:58,015
and watch the car while we are
working on the barricade up there.

473
00:35:58,016 --> 00:36:00,165
You think Bobby's up for it?

474
00:36:01,815 --> 00:36:04,214
- I'll do it.
- That's my good girl.

475
00:36:04,215 --> 00:36:07,564
Now keep an eye on it. Make sure
it doesn't go up the ramp or change.

476
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:24,311
No, this barricade couldn't keep out
a golf cart.

477
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:27,463
I'm gonna get another one.
Keep your eyes open, man.

478
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:52,905
God damn it.

479
00:37:52,906 --> 00:37:55,355
Maria, Maria.

480
00:37:57,503 --> 00:37:59,155
What's up, Tilda?

481
00:37:59,205 --> 00:38:01,602
Maria, I need you to call
the precinct

482
00:38:01,603 --> 00:38:03,602
and get some units over here
right away.

483
00:38:03,603 --> 00:38:06,903
And why would you
want me to do that?

484
00:38:06,904 --> 00:38:10,203
Maria, I'm serious.
This is an emergency.

485
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:13,201
Oh, okay.
What kind of emergency?

486
00:38:13,202 --> 00:38:15,602
God damn it, Maria,
I'm serious.

487
00:38:15,603 --> 00:38:18,601
Tilda, are we under
a terrorist attack?

488
00:38:18,602 --> 00:38:20,202
Is your hair on fire?

489
00:38:20,203 --> 00:38:24,000
Did... oh, did little aliens
land on the roof?

490
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:26,301
- Maria.
- Come on, Til.

491
00:38:26,302 --> 00:38:28,801
You know, I would expect this kind
of bullshit from the guys,

492
00:38:28,802 --> 00:38:30,899
but you of all people?

493
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,451
Maria. Maria.

494
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,551
See? Told you.

495
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,850
(grunts)

496
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,549
(pounding on door)

497
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:01,849
Damn it.

498
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:30,993
The door up on main...
it's welded shut.

499
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:34,094
- Listen, you don't want to do this.
- No no, hey, Tilda, we can do this.

500
00:39:34,095 --> 00:39:35,794
- No.
- If you want to go, that's okay.

501
00:39:35,795 --> 00:39:38,594
I understand.
Just don't stick around for me.

502
00:39:38,595 --> 00:39:41,693
All right, guys, we need
to pull the elevator up.

503
00:39:41,694 --> 00:39:43,794
Afterwards you meet us
downstairs.

504
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:46,493
We're gonna run whatever it is
into the elevator pit.

505
00:39:46,494 --> 00:39:48,094
[Tilda]: Hi.

506
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:50,093
What happened to you?

507
00:39:50,094 --> 00:39:52,842
I know what happened to Al.

508
00:39:57,193 --> 00:39:59,193
All right, Bobby, come on.

509
00:39:59,194 --> 00:40:00,793
This is teamwork.
I need you.

510
00:40:00,794 --> 00:40:03,990
You can help Gordy and I
round it up.

511
00:40:03,991 --> 00:40:07,191
You know what, Ray?
The door up on main is welded shut.

512
00:40:07,192 --> 00:40:08,891
Yeah, to keep
the crackheads out.

513
00:40:08,892 --> 00:40:11,442
You're not getting away
with this, Ray.

514
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,541
- (elevator whirring)
- Whoa. Are we having fun yet? Whoa.

515
00:40:18,591 --> 00:40:22,990
This isn't funny, Gordy, okay?
Come on. You know that this is wrong.

516
00:40:22,991 --> 00:40:24,989
Til, I'll tell you what I know.

517
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,590
There are a few things
that I did learn with Ray in the army.

518
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,188
There are leaders
and there are followers.

519
00:40:30,189 --> 00:40:32,490
And I am no leader.

520
00:40:32,491 --> 00:40:36,188
Ray is an asshole, okay?
He's put all of us in danger.

521
00:40:36,189 --> 00:40:38,189
Yeah, maybe.

522
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,388
Like this...
what, this monster hunt?

523
00:40:40,389 --> 00:40:41,888
Okay? We're mechanics, Gordy.

524
00:40:41,889 --> 00:40:43,888
We're not X-Men.
We can't possibly do this.

525
00:40:43,889 --> 00:40:47,338
Listen, if things get weird,
I got your back.

526
00:40:49,189 --> 00:40:52,538
We should get going.
Are you coming?

527
00:41:02,886 --> 00:41:05,438
(creature growls)

528
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:16,836
Ray?

529
00:41:19,485 --> 00:41:21,636
Where are you guys?
Hello?

530
00:41:23,086 --> 00:41:25,334
Bobby, Bobby, watch out.

531
00:41:27,186 --> 00:41:29,083
(laughs)
We got it.

532
00:41:29,084 --> 00:41:30,634
It's trapped.

533
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:36,133
Bobby!

534
00:41:42,383 --> 00:41:45,034
What's going on?

535
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:50,233
Guys.

536
00:41:53,582 --> 00:41:56,282
Hey, it's me.

537
00:41:56,283 --> 00:41:58,480
Bobby.

538
00:41:58,481 --> 00:42:00,133
Come on.

539
00:42:01,382 --> 00:42:02,981
Hey.

540
00:42:02,982 --> 00:42:05,681
Hey, it's me.

541
00:42:05,682 --> 00:42:07,780
Hey.

542
00:42:07,781 --> 00:42:10,679
(growls)

543
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,030
(screeching)

544
00:42:43,577 --> 00:42:45,028
Somebody help me!

545
00:42:49,977 --> 00:42:51,476
Everybody, up to main now!

546
00:42:51,477 --> 00:42:55,077
- What the hell's going on?
- It's headed after Maria.

547
00:42:55,078 --> 00:42:56,826
Help!

548
00:43:26,073 --> 00:43:29,723
(Maria screams)

549
00:43:31,373 --> 00:43:33,524
(all shouting)
Maria! Maria, get out of the way!

550
00:43:45,772 --> 00:43:48,170
(men shouting)

551
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:49,620
Get away!

552
00:43:54,171 --> 00:43:56,321
Maria!

553
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:11,218
Come on.

554
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:21,718
- Hold on. Hold on.
- To what?

555
00:44:26,067 --> 00:44:27,817
Get out of the way!

556
00:44:40,267 --> 00:44:41,666
Who the hell is driving
that thing?

557
00:44:41,667 --> 00:44:43,716
No one.

558
00:44:54,365 --> 00:44:56,665
(creatures screeches)

559
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:58,815
(Maria yelps)

560
00:45:10,663 --> 00:45:13,214
- (screams)
- Stop it. You're going to kill us.

561
00:45:25,863 --> 00:45:27,361
Fuck.

562
00:45:27,362 --> 00:45:29,762
Hey!

563
00:45:29,763 --> 00:45:31,061
Hey, come on.

564
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:32,911
You need a little fight
in your diet!

565
00:45:40,261 --> 00:45:42,811
(noises echoing)

566
00:45:45,761 --> 00:45:50,009
(noises echoing)

567
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:59,159
- Gordy!
- Get to the stairs.

568
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,408
Come on.

569
00:46:05,258 --> 00:46:06,608
Gordy!

570
00:46:39,855 --> 00:46:42,405
- Gordy!
- (screaming)

571
00:46:50,453 --> 00:46:53,304
(creature screeching)

572
00:47:05,553 --> 00:47:08,103
(creature growls)

573
00:47:14,053 --> 00:47:17,102
(Bobby whispers)
Oh no.

574
00:47:36,351 --> 00:47:38,699
[Maria]:
What was that?

575
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:48,299
[Bobby]: Oh no.

576
00:48:00,447 --> 00:48:03,547
He was a good man.
He was a brave man.

577
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:05,198
Shut the hell up.

578
00:48:10,647 --> 00:48:12,696
Hey.

579
00:48:25,346 --> 00:48:27,895
(crying)

580
00:48:38,245 --> 00:48:41,494
Ray. Ray.

581
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:44,142
Ray, where is the key?

582
00:48:44,143 --> 00:48:46,544
The key?

583
00:48:46,545 --> 00:48:48,542
The key...
the key's on my desk.

584
00:48:48,543 --> 00:48:50,642
Help yourself.

585
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:53,094
Oh no.

586
00:49:03,243 --> 00:49:05,341
Are you gonna help?

587
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:07,441
(lights buzzing)

588
00:49:07,442 --> 00:49:10,640
How long are these emergency lights
gonna burn?

589
00:49:10,641 --> 00:49:12,640
Three hours,

590
00:49:12,641 --> 00:49:14,640
if you change the batteries
when you're supposed to.

591
00:49:14,641 --> 00:49:17,239
I don't think these batteries
have been changed since... ever.

592
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,741
Okay, so we need to get out
of here now.

593
00:49:19,742 --> 00:49:22,090
There is no way out, Bobby.

594
00:49:24,139 --> 00:49:26,291
What are you talking about?

595
00:49:44,539 --> 00:49:47,189
(elevator whirring)

596
00:50:25,835 --> 00:50:27,533
What the hell?

597
00:50:27,534 --> 00:50:30,332
I had Al weld it shut
two days ago

598
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:32,333
to stop the break-ins
and keep the junkies out.

599
00:50:32,334 --> 00:50:34,732
You welded an emergency exit?

600
00:50:34,733 --> 00:50:37,433
It's an emergency exit, Ray.

601
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:41,431
I didn't know back then that we'd be
stuck in here with a killer car.

602
00:50:41,432 --> 00:50:42,983
You're such an idiot.

603
00:50:51,532 --> 00:50:54,131
Oh, come on.

604
00:50:54,132 --> 00:50:56,981
Help!

605
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:06,730
Look, we're all shaken up
by what's happened.

606
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:08,129
I understand.

607
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:10,730
But I... I still think
we should stick to the plan.

608
00:51:10,731 --> 00:51:13,029
We have a plan?

609
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,328
Not anymore.

610
00:51:14,329 --> 00:51:16,929
- Yeah, we're gonna catch this sucker.
- No.

611
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:19,028
- Tilda, I know how you feel...
- We're going to kill it.

612
00:51:19,029 --> 00:51:21,429
Could someone tell me
what's going on here?

613
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:24,878
It's bleeding.
If it can bleed, it can die.

614
00:51:26,229 --> 00:51:29,027
Tilda, you saw what it survived.
It's not gonna be that easy.

615
00:51:29,028 --> 00:51:30,626
That's why we have to
move fast.

616
00:51:30,627 --> 00:51:34,327
Well, what if we hide on the stairs
till someone comes?

617
00:51:34,328 --> 00:51:36,326
The next shift only arrives
Monday morning.

618
00:51:36,327 --> 00:51:37,927
We might not survive till then.

619
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,826
The Messerschmitt KR200,
the Citro체n 2CV prototype,

620
00:51:40,827 --> 00:51:42,927
the Mercedes Smart Car...
three cars off the top of my head

621
00:51:42,928 --> 00:51:44,726
that are narrow enough
to fit up those stairs.

622
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:47,425
- (phone beeping)
- All it needs is one of those and...

623
00:51:47,426 --> 00:51:51,425
Maria, Maria,

624
00:51:51,426 --> 00:51:53,026
I'll get us out of here.

625
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:56,076
Trust me, okay?

626
00:51:57,025 --> 00:52:00,724
Huh. Huh.

627
00:52:00,725 --> 00:52:01,924
Now listen...

628
00:52:01,925 --> 00:52:04,325
Wait wait, "now listen" my ass.

629
00:52:04,326 --> 00:52:06,424
With all due respect,

630
00:52:06,425 --> 00:52:08,723
who all of a sudden
put you in charge, huh?

631
00:52:08,724 --> 00:52:10,824
Nobody. I'm not.
No one's in charge.

632
00:52:10,825 --> 00:52:13,423
Well, it sure sounds to me
like somebody's in charge.

633
00:52:13,424 --> 00:52:15,924
We're doing this together, okay?

634
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:18,522
Whether you like it or not,
you're not running a platoon.

635
00:52:18,523 --> 00:52:20,222
You run a garage, okay?

636
00:52:20,223 --> 00:52:22,673
You check cars in and out.
You write up repair schedules.

637
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:25,221
You're not a leader, Ray.

638
00:52:25,222 --> 00:52:27,674
You're just a bully.

639
00:52:29,722 --> 00:52:33,222
It's hurt, okay?
We've still got light.

640
00:52:33,223 --> 00:52:35,321
The ramp down to L3
is barricaded.

641
00:52:35,322 --> 00:52:37,872
That means we can work
down there.

642
00:52:40,421 --> 00:52:42,573
Let's go.

643
00:52:50,321 --> 00:52:52,819
Hey, Tilda,

644
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,420
if you're not in charge,

645
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,019
how come everybody's
following you, huh?

646
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,970
(lights buzzing)

647
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,420
Hey, Ray, if you want to help,
come with us.

648
00:53:04,421 --> 00:53:07,169
If you don't,
stay where you are.

649
00:53:28,617 --> 00:53:30,767
(growling)

650
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:00,508
It's up here.

651
00:55:00,509 --> 00:55:02,208
Then why are we?

652
00:55:02,209 --> 00:55:05,259
Maria, help Bobby pull the chain
across the ramp.

653
00:55:07,209 --> 00:55:09,106
That's like stopping a bull
with a string.

654
00:55:09,107 --> 00:55:11,507
You'd know.
You're the hunter.

655
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:13,358
Or did you buy those
trophies on eBay?

656
00:55:17,108 --> 00:55:20,405
A warning system.

657
00:55:20,406 --> 00:55:22,757
A built-in delay.

658
00:55:25,506 --> 00:55:28,157
You really think that's gonna
do any good?

659
00:55:29,606 --> 00:55:31,756
I feel better already.

660
00:55:43,806 --> 00:55:46,103
Okay, we might not
have power,

661
00:55:46,104 --> 00:55:48,402
but as long as the batteries hold out,
we can make more of these.

662
00:55:48,403 --> 00:55:51,303
More of these? What for?

663
00:55:51,304 --> 00:55:53,102
You ever hear
of a Burmese tiger trap?

664
00:55:53,103 --> 00:55:56,103
I have. It's a pit with sharp spikes
at the bottom,

665
00:55:56,104 --> 00:55:58,402
covered to make it look
like the ground.

666
00:55:58,403 --> 00:56:01,053
Yeah, we watch
the Discovery Channel.

667
00:56:16,803 --> 00:56:19,200
[Ray]:
Hurry up. Let's go.

668
00:56:19,201 --> 00:56:21,699
Pull.

669
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:24,500
That's right, come on.

670
00:56:24,501 --> 00:56:26,499
Pull. Come on, let's go.

671
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,400
Come on.

672
00:56:28,401 --> 00:56:29,999
Come on, guys,
let's move.

673
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,099
- On the double, come on.
- [Tilda]: Keep going.

674
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,250
One two, one two.
Let's move, come on.

675
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:45,750
I'll start over here.

676
00:56:56,999 --> 00:56:58,647
(screams)

677
00:57:01,298 --> 00:57:04,047
Is everything okay?

678
00:57:05,796 --> 00:57:07,597
Oh.

679
00:57:07,598 --> 00:57:09,096
Hector.

680
00:57:09,097 --> 00:57:11,246
Look, at least now we know
for sure.

681
00:58:03,192 --> 00:58:05,341
(growling)

682
00:58:13,391 --> 00:58:16,240
(chain jingling)

683
00:58:32,589 --> 00:58:35,139
Guys, the lights are going.
Hurry up.

684
00:58:37,189 --> 00:58:39,337
Let's get the headlights on.

685
00:58:48,387 --> 00:58:50,538
This one doesn't work.

686
00:58:51,888 --> 00:58:54,036
Over here.

687
00:59:09,285 --> 00:59:11,035
You got it.

688
00:59:13,085 --> 00:59:15,084
Over here.

689
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:17,634
(grunting)

690
00:59:29,784 --> 00:59:31,934
How is it going
up there, guys?

691
00:59:35,684 --> 00:59:38,081
(screeches)

692
00:59:38,082 --> 00:59:40,933
(siren wailing)

693
00:59:43,382 --> 00:59:45,533
(siren stops)

694
00:59:54,082 --> 00:59:56,332
We don't have much time.

695
00:59:59,081 --> 01:00:01,129
(chain jingling)

696
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,530
(growling)

697
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:49,375
Okay, that's gonna have to do.

698
01:00:49,376 --> 01:00:52,275
We still need time to get upstairs
and pull the tarp across the shaft.

699
01:00:52,276 --> 01:00:54,175
I'll go upstairs
and block the elevator.

700
01:00:54,176 --> 01:00:56,173
Bobby, Ray, you guys
pull the tarp out.

701
01:00:56,174 --> 01:00:57,475
You're the boss.

702
01:00:57,476 --> 01:00:59,074
[Maria]:
Well, what can I do?

703
01:00:59,075 --> 01:01:01,773
[Ray]: Get some rags,
some bottles... glass bottles,

704
01:01:01,774 --> 01:01:03,374
some gasoline...

705
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:05,873
One order of Molotov cocktails
coming up.

706
01:01:05,874 --> 01:01:07,675
Hey, are you all right?
Are you okay?

707
01:01:07,676 --> 01:01:08,874
Yeah, I'm good.

708
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:10,524
(siren wailing)

709
01:01:10,574 --> 01:01:12,672
All right, it's down to L2 now.
We gotta move.

710
01:01:12,673 --> 01:01:14,973
Okay, listen,
stick to the plan, okay?

711
01:01:14,974 --> 01:01:17,172
It's the only way that
we're gonna get through this.

712
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,673
If anything happens to me,
you get them out of here.

713
01:01:19,674 --> 01:01:22,122
Oh, you think
I can handle that? Huh?

714
01:01:34,272 --> 01:01:36,522
(siren stops)

715
01:01:45,271 --> 01:01:47,270
Hey relax.

716
01:01:47,271 --> 01:01:49,470
She'll be back soon.

717
01:01:49,471 --> 01:01:51,870
There's nothing
you can do anyway.

718
01:01:51,871 --> 01:01:53,570
- Hey.
- Hey.

719
01:01:53,571 --> 01:01:56,269
- How are you holding up?
- I can't find any bottles.

720
01:01:56,270 --> 01:02:00,269
- Have you checked the trash cans?
- Yeah.

721
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:02,367
Al keeps a stash of beer
in his repair bay.

722
01:02:02,368 --> 01:02:06,267
No no no, you're not going to L2.
That thing's there right now.

723
01:02:06,268 --> 01:02:08,069
- Hey, Darwin.
- What?

724
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:10,267
Get her number
and get it over with.

725
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,468
And get back to work.

726
01:02:11,469 --> 01:02:14,719
There's too much work.
Let's go.

727
01:02:47,265 --> 01:02:49,415
(growling)

728
01:03:45,159 --> 01:03:47,759
(gasps)

729
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,009
- (chain jingling)
- (car growling)

730
01:04:30,454 --> 01:04:33,405
- (engine starts)
- Thank you.

731
01:04:51,453 --> 01:04:53,704
- Hey.
- What took so long?

732
01:04:53,754 --> 01:04:56,251
Never mind.
I'm finished up here.

733
01:04:56,252 --> 01:04:58,304
Pull the tarp up
and I'll help you tie it off.

734
01:04:59,253 --> 01:05:01,203
Where's Maria?

735
01:05:04,254 --> 01:05:06,302
Hey, where did you go?

736
01:05:09,853 --> 01:05:11,502
Nice work.

737
01:05:13,551 --> 01:05:16,051
I'm guessing
it's on its way to us.

738
01:05:16,052 --> 01:05:19,201
The ramp's still blocked. By the time
it figures its way out, we'll be ready.

739
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:23,250
Oh!

740
01:05:23,251 --> 01:05:25,399
Bobby, watch it.

741
01:05:26,451 --> 01:05:29,000
(panting)

742
01:05:35,649 --> 01:05:37,749
Cocktails, anyone?

743
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:39,999
I could use a dry martini
right about now.

744
01:05:46,148 --> 01:05:48,299
(chain jingling)

745
01:06:12,346 --> 01:06:15,044
(loud crash)

746
01:06:15,045 --> 01:06:18,445
Okay. You guys
get everything ready, okay?

747
01:06:18,446 --> 01:06:21,745
I'm gonna go lure it up.

748
01:06:21,746 --> 01:06:23,095
Tilda.

749
01:07:34,338 --> 01:07:36,488
(engine stops)

750
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:57,386
(tires screeching)

751
01:08:39,233 --> 01:08:41,231
[Ray]: Bobby.

752
01:08:41,232 --> 01:08:43,583
[Maria]: Bobby, no.

753
01:09:24,628 --> 01:09:26,877
(growling)

754
01:09:55,926 --> 01:09:58,175
(tires screeching)

755
01:10:25,423 --> 01:10:28,173
Tilda!

756
01:10:31,022 --> 01:10:33,522
Look, she said if anything
happened to her,

757
01:10:33,523 --> 01:10:35,221
I was to take charge of you.

758
01:10:35,222 --> 01:10:38,370
She made it back
last time, right?

759
01:10:40,722 --> 01:10:41,920
Oh.

760
01:10:41,921 --> 01:10:45,071
(metal squeaking)

761
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,169
(growling)

762
01:10:54,519 --> 01:10:57,569
Come on. Come on.

763
01:10:59,019 --> 01:11:01,170
Come on.

764
01:11:08,718 --> 01:11:11,616
Bobby.

765
01:11:11,617 --> 01:11:12,917
(groans)

766
01:11:12,918 --> 01:11:14,917
Get on.

767
01:11:14,918 --> 01:11:17,469
Got any more of those things?

768
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:22,566
Ray, we've got to help them.

769
01:11:26,316 --> 01:11:29,067
Down to L2.

770
01:11:29,917 --> 01:11:31,615
Maria.

771
01:11:31,616 --> 01:11:33,365
I got it!

772
01:11:44,716 --> 01:11:47,614
What the fuck?

773
01:11:47,615 --> 01:11:49,963
- (screaming)
- Maria!

774
01:11:53,514 --> 01:11:55,412
Maria, no!

775
01:11:55,413 --> 01:11:56,413
No!

776
01:11:56,414 --> 01:11:59,064
(screams)

777
01:12:29,112 --> 01:12:31,961
- The stairs.
- I got it.

778
01:12:48,608 --> 01:12:50,909
[Bobby]: Come on.

779
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:52,559
Come on.

780
01:13:25,206 --> 01:13:28,854
- What's going on?
- Where's Maria?

781
01:13:34,404 --> 01:13:37,704
She's...

782
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:40,304
in the pit.

783
01:13:40,305 --> 01:13:42,654
- What?
- No.

784
01:13:42,704 --> 01:13:44,853
What happened?

785
01:13:54,403 --> 01:13:56,401
Oh shit.

786
01:13:56,402 --> 01:13:59,301
Listen, there's no time for tears.

787
01:13:59,302 --> 01:14:03,302
We've got to move the SUV.

788
01:14:03,303 --> 01:14:04,901
Then let's do it.

789
01:14:04,902 --> 01:14:06,800
Hey, how do you know

790
01:14:06,801 --> 01:14:09,301
it won't just crawl
into some corner and die, huh?

791
01:14:09,302 --> 01:14:12,399
How much experience have you had
with wounded animals?

792
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,552
You have no idea.

793
01:14:16,401 --> 01:14:18,501
No.

794
01:14:18,502 --> 01:14:21,399
(crying)

795
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:24,351
Don't. Tilda, don't.

796
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:29,048
Come on, Bobby,
move the damn car.

797
01:14:43,398 --> 01:14:45,347
Guys, keys.

798
01:14:46,798 --> 01:14:49,796
Hang on.

799
01:14:49,797 --> 01:14:52,448
Bobby, get out!

800
01:14:57,198 --> 01:14:59,347
(both screaming)

801
01:15:08,597 --> 01:15:10,746
Bobby.

802
01:15:12,994 --> 01:15:15,246
No. No.

803
01:15:24,596 --> 01:15:27,044
Bobby!

804
01:15:34,393 --> 01:15:36,644
Hey.

805
01:15:48,393 --> 01:15:50,942
Must have pushed that car
out of the way, huh?

806
01:15:54,692 --> 01:15:57,089
Probably got hungry again.

807
01:15:57,090 --> 01:15:58,742
Huh, Tilda?

808
01:16:00,491 --> 01:16:02,640
- You son of a bitch!
- All right, I'm sorry.

809
01:16:02,690 --> 01:16:04,690
- You son of a bitch!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

810
01:16:04,691 --> 01:16:06,389
I shouldn't have said that.

811
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:09,441
I got him this job.

812
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:14,141
And now I...

813
01:16:17,589 --> 01:16:20,340
just like his mom.

814
01:16:22,788 --> 01:16:24,538
Hey, it's...

815
01:16:30,889 --> 01:16:33,837
Hey, listen.

816
01:16:35,487 --> 01:16:37,487
Sometimes that's just,
you know...

817
01:16:37,488 --> 01:16:40,186
that's just the cards
that life deals, you know.

818
01:16:40,187 --> 01:16:42,738
It's got nothing to do with you.

819
01:16:43,987 --> 01:16:46,185
Hey, listen.

820
01:16:46,186 --> 01:16:48,885
You gotta pull yourself
together, all right?

821
01:16:48,886 --> 01:16:51,036
We still have a job to do.

822
01:16:52,487 --> 01:16:55,984
Hey. Hey.

823
01:16:55,985 --> 01:16:58,186
I thought we were gonna
follow the plan.

824
01:16:58,187 --> 01:16:59,536
Hey.

825
01:17:01,285 --> 01:17:03,936
This isn't how you catch
a Burmese tiger.

826
01:17:35,282 --> 01:17:36,733
Okay.

827
01:17:38,083 --> 01:17:40,631
Who's gonna be the goat?

828
01:17:42,183 --> 01:17:43,831
Let's go.

829
01:17:47,682 --> 01:17:49,631
(engine starts)

830
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:54,979
This reminds me
of the good old times.

831
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:57,230
Yeah, are you happy now?

832
01:18:02,379 --> 01:18:04,479
[Tilda]: Damn it.

833
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:07,629
We're lucky if we have enough gas
to get over to the ramp.

834
01:18:34,277 --> 01:18:36,877
- [Ray]: How about you, hmm?
- What about me?

835
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:41,175
Are you still calling the shots?
Is that the way it is?

836
01:18:41,176 --> 01:18:43,475
You want to take over, Ray?
Be my guest.

837
01:18:43,476 --> 01:18:46,374
I'll take over?
I thought you weren't even in charge.

838
01:18:46,375 --> 01:18:49,175
I'm just trying to get us out of here
alive, okay? Why don't you shut up?

839
01:18:49,176 --> 01:18:53,024
Yeah? Well, you'd better hurry up.
Ain't many of us left.

840
01:18:54,075 --> 01:18:57,073
- (engine dies)
- Crap.

841
01:18:57,074 --> 01:18:59,874
[Tilda]: Shit.

842
01:18:59,875 --> 01:19:02,072
(engine grinding)

843
01:19:02,073 --> 01:19:04,225
(engine starts)

844
01:19:11,474 --> 01:19:13,723
There it is... blood.

845
01:19:19,472 --> 01:19:22,023
It's still hurting.

846
01:19:22,073 --> 01:19:23,722
[Tilda]: Good.

847
01:19:42,671 --> 01:19:44,820
(engine dies)

848
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:48,270
[Tilda]: Damn it.

849
01:19:48,271 --> 01:19:49,869
(engine grinding)

850
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:52,268
I guess this is not
our night, huh?

851
01:19:52,269 --> 01:19:56,719
Hey, Til, you know about that promotion
you applied for...

852
01:19:57,668 --> 01:19:59,868
I told them you were
the best mechanic I had,

853
01:19:59,869 --> 01:20:03,418
but supervisor... you know, you didn't
have the balls for that, I said.

854
01:20:10,069 --> 01:20:13,566
Anyway, I didn't know about you then
what I know about you now, huh?

855
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:16,967
Why don't you
shut the hell up, Ray?

856
01:20:16,968 --> 01:20:19,416
Do you even know how to use
that thing?

857
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:23,017
Hmm?

858
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:26,364
There you go, killer.

859
01:20:26,365 --> 01:20:28,765
You know, I try
to give you a compliment,

860
01:20:28,766 --> 01:20:31,065
and you want to blow my head off?
That's not nice.

861
01:20:31,066 --> 01:20:33,565
I'm gonna show this to you
just once.

862
01:20:33,566 --> 01:20:36,115
So pay attention.

863
01:20:40,265 --> 01:20:42,663
(gun clicks)

864
01:20:42,664 --> 01:20:45,563
If you want to shoot something,
you put it into your shoulder,

865
01:20:45,564 --> 01:20:48,964
wide stance, aim, fire.

866
01:20:48,965 --> 01:20:52,262
You want to reload,
you pump it.

867
01:20:52,263 --> 01:20:54,264
You got that?

868
01:20:54,265 --> 01:20:56,362
You're still a jackass.

869
01:20:56,363 --> 01:20:58,713
Yeah, you're welcome.

870
01:21:22,762 --> 01:21:26,409
Hey, Tilda,
you ever go hunting?

871
01:21:27,761 --> 01:21:30,160
Not before tonight, no.

872
01:21:30,161 --> 01:21:32,460
You know, sometimes
when an animal's being hunted,

873
01:21:32,461 --> 01:21:35,059
you know what it'll do?

874
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:36,609
What?

875
01:21:38,261 --> 01:21:40,558
Backtrack.

876
01:21:40,559 --> 01:21:42,609
(tires screeching)

877
01:21:57,558 --> 01:21:59,606
That's right. Come to Papa.

878
01:22:02,657 --> 01:22:05,408
Come on.
Tilda, let go, baby! Let go!

879
01:22:14,156 --> 01:22:16,807
(screaming)

880
01:22:22,257 --> 01:22:24,554
[Ray]: Tilda!

881
01:22:24,555 --> 01:22:26,205
(screaming)

882
01:22:30,754 --> 01:22:33,505
[Ray]:
Tilda, are you there? Tilda.

883
01:22:36,654 --> 01:22:39,053
(roaring)

884
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:41,104
Ray!

885
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:54,803
[Ray]: Hold on, Tilda.

886
01:22:59,751 --> 01:23:02,602
(screams)

887
01:23:18,351 --> 01:23:21,300
(creature screams)

888
01:23:55,146 --> 01:23:57,496
(screaming)

889
01:24:18,245 --> 01:24:20,894
(gasping)

890
01:24:42,443 --> 01:24:44,593
(grunts)

891
01:25:34,339 --> 01:25:36,987
(thud)

892
01:25:39,036 --> 01:25:42,787
(grunting)

893
01:25:56,637 --> 01:25:59,285
The strong survive, huh?

894
01:26:19,834 --> 01:26:23,431
So I guess it's 50/50, huh,

895
01:26:23,432 --> 01:26:27,031
since, well,

896
01:26:27,032 --> 01:26:29,732
they're all dead?

897
01:26:29,733 --> 01:26:32,430
Well, you know,
I was thinking...

898
01:26:32,431 --> 01:26:35,032
it should be more like 60/40,

899
01:26:35,033 --> 01:26:37,881
since, well, I mean
I'm still the boss, right?

900
01:26:38,731 --> 01:26:40,831
Right?

901
01:26:40,832 --> 01:26:42,881
How do we get out of here?

902
01:27:13,529 --> 01:27:15,578
Uh...

903
01:27:21,028 --> 01:27:23,725
somebody wanna explain to me
what the hell is going on?

904
01:27:23,726 --> 01:27:26,226
I've been trying to call all night.

905
01:27:26,227 --> 01:27:30,577
Oh my God, Til, are you all right?
What happened?

906
01:27:32,427 --> 01:27:34,675
Your car's all set.

907
01:27:35,927 --> 01:27:38,475
Knock yourself out.

908
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:47,376
Til, just a minute.

909
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:35,772
(creatures growl)

910
01:29:04,118 --> 01:29:06,267
(dials)

911
01:29:10,717 --> 01:29:13,015
Channel 1 News?

912
01:29:13,016 --> 01:29:15,668
(creatures growling)

913
01:29:57,312 --> 01:29:59,563
(pop song playing)

914
01:31:18,705 --> 01:31:21,705
 A man 

915
01:31:21,706 --> 01:31:24,554
 Once said to me 

916
01:31:26,305 --> 01:31:29,403
 When lightning comes
from the sky 

917
01:31:29,404 --> 01:31:31,954
 God is angry 

918
01:31:33,604 --> 01:31:36,402
 A priest 

919
01:31:36,403 --> 01:31:38,953
 Once said to me 

920
01:31:40,703 --> 01:31:43,903
 If I question what he speaks 

921
01:31:43,904 --> 01:31:46,851
 That's blasphemy 

922
01:31:48,303 --> 01:31:51,301
 I don't know 

923
01:31:51,302 --> 01:31:55,501
 is he wrong or is he right? 

924
01:31:55,502 --> 01:31:59,301
 He knows what he's been told 

925
01:31:59,302 --> 01:32:01,600
 But I can see 

926
01:32:01,601 --> 01:32:05,151
 The light 

927
01:32:06,501 --> 01:32:10,500
 Who should I believe? 

928
01:32:10,501 --> 01:32:14,498
 Who can I believe? 

929
01:32:14,499 --> 01:32:17,399
 If I want to be free 

930
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:21,799
 I've got to believe in me 

931
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:25,697
 Who should I believe? 

932
01:32:25,698 --> 01:32:29,298
 Who can I believe? 

933
01:32:29,299 --> 01:32:32,198
 If I want to be free 

934
01:32:32,199 --> 01:32:37,149
 I've got to believe in me 

935
01:33:20,995 --> 01:33:24,292
 My mom 

936
01:33:24,293 --> 01:33:27,244
 Once gave to me 

937
01:33:28,993 --> 01:33:31,391
 The opportunity 

938
01:33:31,392 --> 01:33:34,543
 To join humanity 

939
01:33:36,492 --> 01:33:39,391
 The man 

940
01:33:39,392 --> 01:33:41,842
 Drilled in to me 

941
01:33:43,992 --> 01:33:47,190
 "To live a life that's free 

942
01:33:47,191 --> 01:33:50,390
 Is a felony" 

943
01:33:50,391 --> 01:33:54,091
 Who's to know? 

944
01:33:54,092 --> 01:33:58,888
 Am I wrong to think I'm right? 

945
01:33:58,889 --> 01:34:01,689
 Empty words don't hold 

946
01:34:01,690 --> 01:34:04,890
 Once you've seen 

947
01:34:04,891 --> 01:34:08,439
 The light 

948
01:34:09,688 --> 01:34:13,488
 Who should I believe? 

949
01:34:13,489 --> 01:34:16,988
 Who can I believe? 

950
01:34:16,989 --> 01:34:20,287
 If I want to be free 

951
01:34:20,288 --> 01:34:24,986
 I've got to believe in me 

952
01:34:24,987 --> 01:34:28,387
 Who should I believe? 

953
01:34:28,388 --> 01:34:31,785
 Who can I believe? 

954
01:34:31,786 --> 01:34:34,986
 If I want to be free 

955
01:34:34,987 --> 01:34:38,737
 I've got to believe...
