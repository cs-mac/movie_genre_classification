Nah, no need.

Why?

73
00:04:04,288 --> 00:04:05,376
Is the company asking you to?

But she's not evil.

81
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:32,658
It's just that her own standards are so high.

No, it's not like that.

83

Just . . .

84
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:40,945

a job I can do well.
That's why.

I know, because I've worked as a designer before too.

The girl who got the nickname Seo Yoon Foot!

Someone mentioned Seo Yoon Foot after seeing her in France.

And at a high luxury apartment, at that!

166
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:24,391
I know it was really hard to get the job,

167
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:25,625
and you do need to earn money,

168
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,108
and you'll have to marry too in the future as well.

169
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,013
It's true you can't continue living unemployed.

170
00:09:33,163 --> 00:09:35,679
Yeah, you'll have to run Seo Yoon Foot's errands.

171
00:09:36,188 --> 00:09:37,366
It's true.

172
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:38,343
You have to.

173
00:09:38,343 --> 00:09:40,041
That's reality.

174
00:09:41,271 --> 00:09:43,786
Well, work life is all like that anyway.

175
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:45,627
Right?

176
00:09:45,948 --> 00:09:47,394
I'll have to earn money, right?

177
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:48,262
Of coursies.

178
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:50,718
Yup, and I need to marry too, right?

179
00:09:50,718 --> 00:09:51,491
Of coursies.

180
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,805
Yup and I have to quit living as an umemployed.

181
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:54,825
Right?

182
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,047
Stop, bitch.

183
00:09:58,047 --> 00:09:59,525
You're pitiful.

184
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,553
You're not like this because I said to break up, right?

185
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:10,464
You better answer when I'm still talking nice, So In Chan.

186
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:13,808
Answer your phone!

187
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:22,560
<i>Come to Pera Gallery in Cheongdamdong.</i>

188
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,805
You're here.

189
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:53,028
Thanks so much for coming.

190
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,451
I'm in charge of this meeting alone, you see.

191
00:10:56,451 --> 00:10:58,746
It's a very important matter.

192
00:10:58,746 --> 00:11:02,751
You don't know how relieved I am because you're going to help me.

193
00:11:02,751 --> 00:11:05,108
Not so, Madame. (formal speech)

194
00:11:05,108 --> 00:11:06,163
What?

195
00:11:06,163 --> 00:11:09,364
I am merely doing my work duty.

196
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:12,994
So funny.

197
00:11:12,994 --> 00:11:16,222
Hey, why are you being awkward?  Relax.

198
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:19,142
This is more comfortable for me.

199
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:20,462
Please consider it.

200
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:22,661
Madame, if you went into work,

201
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:28,253
and the superior you're reporting to is your classmate.
So, could you treat her relaxed like a friend?

202
00:11:31,262 --> 00:11:36,994
I see . . .  So you're going to treat me officially when we're meeting over work?

203
00:11:37,893 --> 00:11:40,713
Alright.  I guess that makes sense too.

204
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:44,854
Actually, that is how work life is, isn't it?

205
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:47,797
Having to endure and do the tasks you don't want to.

206
00:11:47,897 --> 00:11:50,099
And at times, having to put on forced smile as well.

207
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:51,618
Fine then.

208
00:11:51,618 --> 00:11:55,260
Whatever makes you comfortable.

209
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:04,773
Should we begin the meeting preparations then?

210
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:06,852
Yes.

211
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:11,625
You'll have to be careful taking that off.

212
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,274
Yes.

213
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:15,007
But there's a mark.

214
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:17,523
No, you'll have to fix that.

215
00:12:17,523 --> 00:12:21,313
The furniture!  You have to mind the furniture too.

216
00:12:28,286 --> 00:12:30,719
You're here?  Let's see.

217
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:34,360
They said this was the style favored by the Artemis President.

218
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,995
There's so little known about him.

219
00:12:35,995 --> 00:12:38,110
I had to put some effort into finding it out.

220
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,716
Be careful of that.

221
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:41,808
<i>Moreover, the Chairman I work for,</i>

222
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:49,249
<i>is precisely, merely, the one your side, GN Fashion, is bending over backwards to try to collaborate with.</i>

223
00:12:53,204 --> 00:12:55,632
It does look high class.

224
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,920
But must it be this extreme just to eat one meal?

225
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:10,116
What's known to the public,

226
00:13:10,116 --> 00:13:16,631
is the name, Jean Thierry Cha. The youngest CEO of Artemis Korea ever.

227
00:13:16,855 --> 00:13:20,638
Thanks to his work in the luxury market of Korea,

228
00:13:20,638 --> 00:13:24,635
last year, Artemis Korea's yearly sales was over 40 million dollars.

229
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:29,986
This is a meeting to entertain someone of that caliber.

230
00:13:29,986 --> 00:13:35,159
It's not just to eat one meal.

231
00:13:37,052 --> 00:13:39,904
That's crooked.

232
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:42,332
How can you put that on the floor?

233
00:13:42,332 --> 00:13:45,161
Bring it to me.

234
00:13:46,322 --> 00:13:48,793
Clear this stuff off the floor.

235
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:56,637
<i>Seo Yoon Foot, incredible!</i>

236
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:05,142
<i>Look.  I started from her and made this big turn,</i>

237
00:14:05,142 --> 00:14:09,130
<i>and turned all the way to her and the answer came!</i>

238
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,012
About what?

239
00:14:10,012 --> 00:14:12,597
Living in France as "Yoon Joo, Cha" . . . !

240
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:16,134
Yoon Joo, CHA?  Not Yoon Joo, SEO?

241
00:14:16,312 --> 00:14:20,912
This is it.  The reason Seo Yoon Joo lived as Cha Yoon Joo in France.

242
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,372
I found it on Gi Seon's homepage.

243
00:14:23,372 --> 00:14:26,446
While traveling to France, she met CHA, Yoon Joo.

244
00:14:26,446 --> 00:14:27,858
But why "Cha" as the last name?

245
00:14:27,858 --> 00:14:30,230
In other countries, you take on your husband's last name after marriage.

246
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,194
Then this is her wedding photo?

247
00:14:32,194 --> 00:14:36,006
Not officially.  A wedding just by themselves at the Catholic church.

248
00:14:36,754 --> 00:14:40,368
But our CEO is a "Shin" as a last name.

249
00:14:40,368 --> 00:14:42,740
That's the point that is incredible!

250
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,931
She met a guy in France and lived with him as Cha Yoon Joo, then she married your CEO.

251
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:49,338
Isn't it totally obvious seeing how it wasn't an official marriage?

252
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:53,619
She kicked her husband with the last name Cha to the curb, in order to marry a wealthier man with more abilities.

253
00:14:53,619 --> 00:14:57,520
We've known her since high school,
but isn't she really so scary?

254
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,585
She struck a big blow to bite a better man.

255
00:15:00,585 --> 00:15:02,936
She's venomous (coldhearted).

256
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:06,603
What duplicity.

257
00:15:06,603 --> 00:15:07,365
Isn't she?

258
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,800
I mean you!  You!

259
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,616
You were so envious of her at Da Eun's wedding.

260
00:15:11,616 --> 00:15:13,214
But why are you cussing Seo Yoon Joo now?

261
00:15:13,214 --> 00:15:14,850
Hey, but that's . . .

262
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,409
She's the one who really made her dream come true.

263
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:20,470
She's the girl who claimed this was all her skill; her ability.

264
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,915
True.  She looked so pathetic back then.

265
00:15:25,243 --> 00:15:27,126
But these days, this is ability too.

266
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:31,952
But what's going on with you and So In Chan?

267
00:15:32,385 --> 00:15:35,212
What do you mean what?

268
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:38,941
So In Chan was absent without an excuse today.

269
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:46,513
<i>Your call cannot be reached . . .</i>

270
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:51,382
<i>They're unable to get on the surgery schedule with the unpaid hospital bill still outstanding.</i>

271
00:15:52,841 --> 00:15:55,679
I'm in a bit of of a bind.

272
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,385
My bag . . . I still can't get a refund for it?

273
00:15:58,385 --> 00:16:00,726
Customer, please come this way briefly.

274
00:16:03,014 --> 00:16:04,383
Illegally distributed?

275
00:16:04,383 --> 00:16:09,331
As you can see, there's a defective workmanship at the end of the thread stitch.

276
00:16:09,331 --> 00:16:14,563
Our company retracts all defective merchandize and puts them through incineration.

277
00:16:14,563 --> 00:16:19,076
We do not sell defective merchandize such as this, no matter what.

278
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:20,717
That can't be true.

279
00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:24,861
They are confirming it at the headquarters.
So when that's done, we will contact you.

280
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:26,935
But I'm sure there isn't any issue with this.

281
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:30,290
This is definitely not one of those "illegally distributed" or what have you.

282
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,161
But anyway, please contact me as soon as that's confirmed.

283
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,793
<i>"Omo, Royal Department Store is having a sale.  Grand Name-Brand Sale.</i>

284
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,211
<i>ID: Seungseung Jojo</i>

285
00:16:58,206 --> 00:16:59,710
<i>Gotta go then!</i>

00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,484
<i>Can a 50-day-old infant go to the department store?</i>

287
00:17:01,484 --> 00:17:02,911
<i>But they don't really have many famous brands.</i>

288
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:06,589
<i>Royal doesn't carry Artemis.</i>

289
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:10,783
<i>Artemis is a 'no-sale' brand anyway. So annoyed.</i>

290
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:14,702
<i>Let's start a boycott campaign.</i>
<i>They need to wake up.</i>

291
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:19,614
<i>They're saying Artemis is going up by 10% in price.  The classic line.</i>

292
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,730
<i>Really? No way.</i>

293
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,096
<i>Going out to buy it now.
But I'm only getting paid next week.</i>

294
00:17:24,096 --> 00:17:28,635
<i>Dearies, what about the campaign?</i>

295
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:32,018
Mr. Chairman.

296
00:17:35,895 --> 00:17:37,620
What is it?

297
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,400
It's your bag, right?

298
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,147
But you can't give me a refund, and you can't fix it?

299
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:47,022
This bag isn't an officially distributed merchandise.

300
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:48,460
Hey!

301
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,992
Then are you saying I bought it illegally?

302
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:55,090
Who's he now? The store manager?

303
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:29,283
Hey, you sold the likes of this bag and what now?
Illegal distribution?

304
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:33,291
I'm sorry, Customer, but where did you purchase this?

305
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,342
I didn't buy it at the store.

306
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,410
But this isn't a knock-off.  Check it.

307
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,284
You're right, Customer.

308
00:18:40,284 --> 00:18:43,701
Regardless of where you bought it,
it is indeed our product.

309
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:46,583
Do you desire a refund or an exchange?

310
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,014
Exchange.  Switch for me.

311
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:52,357
With that.

312
00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:56,522
Customer, the product price difference is three thousand two hundred . . .

313
00:18:56,522 --> 00:18:59,365
Exchange what she wants for her.

314
00:19:00,115 --> 00:19:01,504
What?

315
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:14,738
I apologize for the inconvenience to you.

316
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:19,576
And I hope you will make the purchase at an official store next time.

317
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:25,932
Customer, your mental health is more important than money, isn't it?

318
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,881
Convene a meeting.

319
00:19:38,531 --> 00:19:40,165
Yes.

00:20:08,321 --> 00:20:11,365
<i>For not putting Artemis into Royal Department Store.</i>

324
00:20:11,365 --> 00:20:15,089
<i>Stuff like that is such a case of headache.</i>

325
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,878
<i>Hey, Cha Seong Jo.</i>

326
00:20:17,878 --> 00:20:20,291
<i>No, Jean Thierry Cha.</i>

327
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:25,094
<i>Your grudge-bearing?  You take that after me.</i>

328
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:32,784
<i>Hey, but is your last name "Ssha" now?</i>

329
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:37,376
<i>Ssha ssi? Ssha ssi?</i>

330
00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:41,618
<i>But why is your name Jean Thierry?
Why didn't you go with aluminum?</i>

331
00:20:41,618 --> 00:20:44,668
<i>Aluminum Sshassi (punk).</i>

332
00:20:45,063 --> 00:20:47,189
<i>Heck, you little rascal!</i>

333
00:20:50,305 --> 00:20:52,981
The products to be incinerated were distributed.

334
00:20:52,981 --> 00:20:54,503
Who did it?

335
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,582
We're not sure.

336
00:20:55,582 --> 00:21:00,739
But Deputy So In Chan of the Marketing Department has been on an unexcused absence since two days ago.

337
00:21:02,988 --> 00:21:04,945
Is this how you've been working this whole time?

338
00:21:04,945 --> 00:21:08,089
Haphazard with product inspection and you don't even know when someone snatch products out?

339
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:12,095
And have defective merchandize show up on the market?!

340
00:21:14,703 --> 00:21:18,070
I bet some among you is thinking this right now.

341
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,575
Other brands sell their defective products at a discount.

342
00:21:20,575 --> 00:21:23,705
People buy these expensive bags happily at a cheap price.

343
00:21:23,705 --> 00:21:25,573
Yes, that's right!

344
00:21:25,673 --> 00:21:30,485
Why don't we throw them all out on some family sale?  At unbelievable prices?

345
00:21:30,485 --> 00:21:33,195
Then, whoever wants it,

346
00:21:33,195 --> 00:21:35,129
be it a college student, or a mom, or granny,

347
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:37,716
it becomes something anyone can buy.

348
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:41,418
Is that the famous brand you all want?

349
00:21:42,315 --> 00:21:45,676
Deputy So In Chan . . . find him!

350
00:21:51,295 --> 00:21:52,885
Did In Chan show up?

351
00:21:52,885 --> 00:21:56,354
So In Chan really caused huge trouble.

352
00:21:56,354 --> 00:21:59,970
In Chan did an illegal distribution?

353
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,648
That's how it seems.

354
00:22:01,648 --> 00:22:05,005
For 2 days, he's been out of contact.

355
00:22:05,005 --> 00:22:07,900
The company wants to handle this quietly.

356
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,912
Before this becomes public, So In Chan should quickly come forward.

357
00:22:11,912 --> 00:22:15,873
The company could have made a mistake during the product quality assuarance process.

358
00:22:17,228 --> 00:22:20,880
That has not happened even once, yet.

359

<i>The person you have called is not reachable at this time.  Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

<i>He has illegally distributed 5 defective bags.</i>

361
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:35,180
<i>In one month, we will be $2150 in the hole and in one year, it will become $25,800!</i>

362
00:22:38,576 --> 00:22:41,698
That kind of bag...if 5 of them...

363
00:22:42,457 --> 00:22:44,298
It would be $30,000.

What is this?
Private financial debt, $69,300!

373

That's nauseatingly a lot.

374
00:24:01,955 --> 00:24:04,175
How much is the debt?

375
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:08,166
For you...from this point, you don't know anything about this.

376

You don't even know a person by the name So In Chan.

What?

378
00:24:12,395 --> 00:24:16,295
You should not put your foot in to a place you cannot be responsible to begin with.

379
00:24:16,295 --> 00:24:19,811
There is no reason for you to be responsible for his debt.

380
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:22,776
That's right. I can't be responsible.

381
00:24:22,776 --> 00:24:24,959
I don't have the ability as well.

382
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:30,023
But, are you telling me to give up on In Chan oppa in this situation?

383
00:24:31,024 --> 00:24:34,404
Se Kyung.  I gurantee you.

384
00:24:34,404 --> 00:24:37,732
He doesn't want you at his side.

385
00:24:37,732 --> 00:24:40,248
You know he stole those bags.

386
00:24:40,248 --> 00:24:43,611
If you were him, would you want to show yourself to him?

387
00:24:43,611 --> 00:24:45,862
I'm going to pretend I don't know.

388
00:24:45,862 --> 00:24:49,313
You better not say anything weird to him.

389
00:24:49,313 --> 00:24:51,366
Is this something you can just pretend you don't know about?

390
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:54,900
This will pass. It's a situation that will go away.

391
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,038
It's not like a terminal illness to die from.

392
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,939
It's just money that needs to be repaid.

393
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:01,330
Money to be repaid, that's all.

394
00:25:02,342 --> 00:25:06,450
Nowadays, poverty is the terminal disease!

395
00:25:08,379 --> 00:25:10,524
Where are you going?

396
00:25:10,524 --> 00:25:13,460
I have to go and find In Chan oppa.

Ah that's right, Se Kyung

Your boyfriend works for Artemis?

406
00:25:58,777 --> 00:26:01,334
I heard from a manager at Artemis

407
00:26:01,334 --> 00:26:03,846
that there has been some unsavory happening?

408
00:26:07,805 --> 00:26:11,741
You'd better be careful.  It could negatively affect you.

409
00:26:15,988 --> 00:26:21,377
And Se Kyung. That kind of man...
Shouldn't you cut him off quickly?

410
00:26:21,377 --> 00:26:27,461
If you keep getting entangled with that sort of things, you could be held responsible as well.

So then, I will be leaving.

Yes.

No.  I don't think of the fact that we went to the same school at all.

Oh, that's right.

430
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,314
What was that saying?

431
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:19,589
What you said in French during the interview.

432
00:28:19,589 --> 00:28:22,357
That saying left me a deep impression.

433
00:28:24,731 --> 00:28:28,325
You said president is coming up. Hasn't he come in yet?

No, not yet.  He should have been up by now.

00:32:04,317 --> 00:32:09,693
Not at all!  I simply gave you a job.

480
00:32:09,693 --> 00:32:13,035
As it looked like you so desperated wanted it.

481
00:32:14,384 --> 00:32:20,976
Of course, in your eyes, I could still be..."you know what".

482
00:32:22,057 --> 00:32:24,353
But is that important?

483
00:32:30,934 --> 00:32:33,929
What's important is...

00:32:33,929 --> 00:32:36,047
thanks to a "you know what" person,

you got a job.

No, but . . .

Didn't I say I was the CEO's secretary?

You can speak to me.  What is it that you have to tell him?

533
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:29,916
Please tell him that Mr. So In Chan will return no matter what.

534
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:32,218
To wait for him just a bit longer.

535
00:39:32,218 --> 00:39:35,369
He will return no matter what and explain and take any responsibility.

536
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:37,715
Did he say it himself, that he'd return?

537
00:39:37,715 --> 00:39:40,018
That he'd be responsible for everything?

538
00:39:40,018 --> 00:39:41,953
Did you see him?

539
00:39:43,957 --> 00:39:47,006
This lady always makes me repeat myself.

540
00:39:48,017 --> 00:39:49,623
I asked whether you saw him.

541
00:39:49,623 --> 00:39:51,023
I talked to him on the phone.

542
00:39:51,023 --> 00:39:52,968
Mr. So In Chan said so, on the phone?

543
00:39:52,968 --> 00:39:55,093
For sure, it was a call from him.

544
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:56,672
And he will take responsibility.

545
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:59,469
What is this?  You haven't even spoken to him properly over the phone?

546
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:01,956
It's not that he said he'd be responsible?

547
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:07,788
Aigo, of course that's how they play.  The person himself doesn't even show up but sends a woman . . .

548
00:40:08,418 --> 00:40:11,975
I'm not here because he sent me, but on my own.

549
00:40:12,672 --> 00:40:15,996
Why?
-- Because I believe in him.

550
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,097
You believe in him?

551
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,326
I said I have faith in So In Chan.

552
00:40:20,326 --> 00:40:24,055
He might have had a momentary lapse in judgment but he's not one to shirk his responsibility.

553
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:28,058
Even this lapse was due to his sense of responsibility.

554
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:30,351
How many years have you dated him?

555
00:40:30,351 --> 00:40:32,217
6 years.

556
00:40:32,217 --> 00:40:36,333
Do you know how much debt your 6-year-long boyfriend has?

557
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:39,596
Even though he may have some debt . . .
That he is officially declared delinquent?

558
00:40:40,247 --> 00:40:41,967
I guess you didn't know.

559
00:40:41,967 --> 00:40:46,322
Then, think about it very carefully from now on.
Then you'd be like, oops, why did I go there to see him?

560
00:40:46,322 --> 00:40:50,987
Omo, I must've been crazy.  I must wake up to reality and get away from him as soon as possible!

561
00:40:50,987 --> 00:40:53,744
That's what you'd think.

562
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:57,707
Because I know women better than women themselves,

563
00:40:57,707 --> 00:41:01,051
I can offer you this advice.

564
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:06,961
What the . . . ?  Were you laughing at me just now?

565
00:41:06,961 --> 00:41:08,199
Oh, seriously . . .

566
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,540
YOU are laughing at ME?

567
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:14,986
You, you may know women very well.

568
00:41:14,986 --> 00:41:17,532
But you haven't loved, right?

569
00:41:17,532 --> 00:41:19,636
Nor have been loved, right?

570
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:33,036
By the way, you, are you the CEO or something?

571
00:41:33,036 --> 00:41:33,862
What?

572
00:41:33,862 --> 00:41:37,683
You're not the CEO, but from the way you act and speak, it's as though you're the CEO, CEO!

573
00:41:37,683 --> 00:41:42,441
You!  Stop costume-playing the CEO and just relay my message to the CEO.

574
00:41:42,441 --> 00:41:44,000
That So In Chan will return for sure.

575
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,032
That I give my word.

576
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,668
Hey!

577
00:41:51,668 --> 00:41:56,996
I've loved and been loved enough and that's where that life's insight comes from!

578
00:41:56,996 --> 00:41:58,909
So speechless . . .

579
00:42:02,442 --> 00:42:05,814
Umm, yes, I'm coming down now.

580
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:17,484
Have you brought it?

581
00:42:17,484 --> 00:42:19,779
This works well, right?

582
00:42:19,779 --> 00:42:20,848
Can it record even from inside my pocket?

583
00:42:20,848 --> 00:42:25,031
I use it when I treat a lot of my patients.
OK.

584
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:29,537
But I'm asking you why, why are you borrowing a recorder all of a sudden?

585
00:42:29,537 --> 00:42:30,818
You told me to heal myself.

586
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:32,123
Hey, hey, hurry and get out, get out.

587
00:42:32,123 --> 00:42:32,759
Get out, I'm late.

588
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:34,609
Quickly, go!

589
00:42:37,753 --> 00:42:40,766
You just wait, Seo Yoon Joo.

590
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,843
Here comes Edmond Dantes.

591
00:43:00,527 --> 00:43:02,940
Why are you in such a good mood from earlier on?

592
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,635
Aren't you nervous?

593
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:10,357
I think I know now why people watch movies

594
00:43:10,357 --> 00:43:13,693
like "The Count of Monte Cristo

595
00:43:13,693 --> 00:43:15,718
and root for Edmond Dantes to take his revenge.

596
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:19,161
What?  Why do they root for him?

597
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:26,087
I think revenge is somehow beneficial to a person's health.

598
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:46,427
Sister-in-law, you're here?

599
00:43:46,427 --> 00:43:52,056
The balance is not bad.

600
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,212
CEO Jean Thierry Cha has arrived.

601
00:44:10,212 --> 00:44:12,373
I see.

602
00:44:28,373 --> 00:44:31,247
Everything is ready, right?
Of course.

603
00:44:31,776 --> 00:44:34,385
You are very pretty today.

604
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:55,151
Time to (take) revenge.

605
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:27,233
It's nice to meet you.  I'm Shin Min Hyuk.

606
00:45:33,248 --> 00:45:36,275
Until we meet like this, information about you was so limited

607
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,353
that I was actually a bit nervous.

608
00:45:38,353 --> 00:45:40,235
In France, I was just an Asian nobody

609
00:45:40,235 --> 00:45:43,592
on the marketing team.

610
00:45:43,592 --> 00:45:50,854
How can that be? Rumor has it that you came up with all the recent marketing strategies Artemis used in Korea.

611
00:45:50,854 --> 00:45:53,773
Due to my personal experience,

612
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,327
I gave deep thoughts

613
00:45:59,814 --> 00:46:02,540
to the Korean female psyche and they were the results.

614
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,708
In the end, the modern marketing strategy

615
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:07,598
is about how to quantify the human psyche and

616
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:11,092
how to translate it into sales.

617
00:46:11,092 --> 00:46:13,424
Isn't that so?

618
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:22,590
Oh, is that so?

619
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:25,397
I . . .

620
00:46:25,397 --> 00:46:28,222
don't know much about things like that.

621
00:46:29,096 --> 00:46:35,705
Somehow, I thought Artemis's policy could not be explained away as a simple high price strategy.

622
00:46:35,705 --> 00:46:38,062
May I say a psychological basis

623
00:46:38,062 --> 00:46:40,511
that makes one's psyche vibrate.

624
00:46:42,131 --> 00:46:43,195
You're overcomplimenting me.

625
00:46:43,195 --> 00:46:44,756
At any rate, you're incredible.

626
00:46:44,756 --> 00:46:47,056
I don't know what experience you had,

627
00:46:47,056 --> 00:46:50,541
or how agonized you must have been

628
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,376
to gain enough insight to come up with all the marketing plans.

629
00:46:55,071 --> 00:46:57,988
Well, about that, if we have time in the future . . .

630
00:47:00,589 --> 00:47:02,822
Here!

631
00:47:02,822 --> 00:47:04,808
Oh, shoot . . .

632
00:47:04,808 --> 00:47:08,472
Honey, one more bottle of the same, please.

633
00:47:15,298 --> 00:47:17,041
Ah . . . yes.

634
00:47:38,144 --> 00:47:40,166
The house is very spacious.

635
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:46,861
Still . . .

636
00:47:48,611 --> 00:47:50,431
such a loser you are.

637
00:47:57,744 --> 00:48:00,466
What about you who has to kiss up to a loser

638
00:48:01,646 --> 00:48:03,495
and your husband?

639
00:48:07,296 --> 00:48:08,579
This time

640
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,564
you must shield me.

641
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:16,305
Still . . .

642
00:48:16,305 --> 00:48:17,747
what an egotist you are.

643
00:48:21,321 --> 00:48:23,384
Don't worry.

644
00:48:23,384 --> 00:48:27,028
I simply came to return something.

645
00:48:33,566 --> 00:48:35,028
Oh, thanks.

646
00:48:36,668 --> 00:48:37,853
Oh, and you know

647
00:48:37,853 --> 00:48:42,324
that I am also the CEO of Eclaire Korea.

648
00:48:42,324 --> 00:48:44,456
I brought a small gift

649
00:48:44,456 --> 00:48:47,506
for your wife.

650
00:48:50,855 --> 00:48:54,262
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Wonderland Team @ viki.com</i>

651
00:48:57,729 --> 00:48:59,260
Oh, thank you.

652
00:49:00,377 --> 00:49:02,853
Honey, hurry and open it.

653
00:49:06,322 --> 00:49:07,897
Yes.

654
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,897
That was it!

655
00:49:58,008 --> 00:49:59,510
<i>Yoon Joo, why are you doing this?</i>

656
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:01,289
<i>I love you.</i>

657
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,333
<i>Enough to give up everything.</i>

658
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,830
<i>Why did you give up?</i>

659
00:50:06,373 --> 00:50:08,491
<i>When the things you gave up</i>

660
00:50:09,232 --> 00:50:13,280
<i>could have shielded me in such happiness.</i>

661
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,091
<i>Now, do you see?</i>

662
00:50:16,443 --> 00:50:18,464
<i>To me, you were</i>

663
00:50:20,979 --> 00:50:23,411
<i>just business.</i>

664
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,726
<i>What about you who has to kiss up to a loser</i>

665
00:50:33,726 --> 00:50:36,506
<i>and your husband?</i>

666
00:50:36,506 --> 00:50:40,718
This is it!  Wow, the line is to die for!

667
00:50:40,718 --> 00:50:43,910
What was I going to do if Seo Yoon Joo hadn't called me a loser?

668
00:50:45,447 --> 00:50:47,878
Wow, this is terrific!

669
00:50:50,488 --> 00:50:52,192
Got to hear it again.

670
00:50:52,192 --> 00:50:55,937
<i>What about you who have to kiss up to a loser and your husband?</i>

671
00:50:55,937 --> 00:50:57,694
That's right, yeah!

672
00:51:00,473 --> 00:51:03,564
Wow, this is really healing me.

673
00:51:24,389 --> 00:51:26,200
Oppa!

674
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,980
Oppa, you're inside, right?

675
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:32,234
Oppa, please open the door.  It's me, Se Kyung!

676
00:51:32,234 --> 00:51:33,815
What are you doing here?

677
00:51:45,701 --> 00:51:47,222
Hey, you crazy bastard.

678
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,391
You, jerk!

679
00:51:51,801 --> 00:51:54,108
Where have you been?

680
00:51:55,885 --> 00:52:00,780
Why did you do it, why?  When you've been holding up so well all this time?  Why?

681
00:52:22,822 --> 00:52:24,867
Where have you been?

682
00:52:27,348 --> 00:52:31,628
To where did you wander so much, you fool.

683
00:52:41,847 --> 00:52:45,667
I'm going to sort it out with the company, so you don't have to worry about it.

684
00:52:47,621 --> 00:52:49,926
What are you going to do?

685
00:52:49,926 --> 00:52:52,062
I'll probably be fired.

686
00:52:52,062 --> 00:52:54,732
And again, I will find a way . . .

687
00:52:58,501 --> 00:53:00,780
Umm, Oppa . . .

688
00:53:15,655 --> 00:53:16,455
[I got into Artemis.]

689
00:53:31,188 --> 00:53:33,746
I've said such schmaltzy things.

690
00:53:36,491 --> 00:53:38,927
That's the message you wrote me,

691
00:53:38,927 --> 00:53:41,386
after the junior year midterm exams.

692
00:53:43,208 --> 00:53:46,085
And this is what I wrote you because you wallowed so much about not being able to get a job.

693
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:51,125
At that time, only you got a job and

694
00:53:51,125 --> 00:53:54,241
I couldn't, that's why.

695
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,777
[Next year, I won't make you toil. I love you.^^]

696
00:54:04,788 --> 00:54:06,465
Still,

697
00:54:06,465 --> 00:54:09,755
this was the most fun time.

698
00:54:20,478 --> 00:54:23,566
What are you doing?  Oppa!  Oppa!

699
00:54:23,566 --> 00:54:25,028
Oppa, why are you doing this?

700
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:25,751
Oppa!

701
00:54:25,751 --> 00:54:28,604
Now, stop all this!

702
00:54:32,357 --> 00:54:34,988
You know too that this was all BS.

703
00:54:34,988 --> 00:54:36,724
What?

704
00:54:36,724 --> 00:54:41,196
Efforts make a difference?  Efforts are my force?

705
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:47,904
Okay, I also thought that way at the beginning.  So I tried.

706
00:54:47,904 --> 00:54:50,305
I wanted to show you.

707
00:54:50,305 --> 00:54:54,657
I wanted to prove to you that I could change, make progress.

708
00:54:56,435 --> 00:55:00,228
Get married to you and

709
00:55:00,228 --> 00:55:03,373
have kids, buy a house, buy a car . . .

710
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:06,306
But

711
00:55:09,284 --> 00:55:11,928
no matter how hard I try, nothing changes.

712
00:55:13,571 --> 00:55:17,627
What is getting better?  The more I try, the deeper grows my despair.

713
00:55:17,627 --> 00:55:23,869
Of the myriad of apartments, there is no house I can buy.
No matter how much I work, I'm always in the red, I'll never be in the black.

714
00:55:27,092 --> 00:55:29,156
And in such a state, I . . . get married to you?

715
00:55:30,954 --> 00:55:32,875
Have kids?

716
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:35,258
The kids born to you and I

717
00:55:35,258 --> 00:55:37,270
have to, under poor parents,

718
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:39,800
study, go to college,

719
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:44,656
and work.  What bad have they done? What bad have they done to deserve a life like mine?

720
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:55,046
The bags others buy so easily . . .

721
00:55:56,633 --> 00:55:58,009
But my mom's life

722
00:55:59,097 --> 00:56:04,366
can be saved or lost by a few of those.
So I ended up stealing them.

723
00:56:04,366 --> 00:56:07,655
I got together the money for her operation.

724
00:56:08,681 --> 00:56:12,474
Do you know the first thought I had, seeing mom coming out of the operation room?

725
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,823
When will I get the money together again?

726
00:56:20,337 --> 00:56:25,133
Her hospital bills, chemotherapy, medicine bills, all I see is pitch black.

727
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:31,476
We don't know when it may recur, medical bills will continue to come.

728
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,409
They say the operation was a success and I'm not happy at all.

729
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:43,819
Yes, maybe, maybe I was disappointed.  Rather, had she passed away . . .

730
00:56:47,628 --> 00:56:49,501
It's a rare cancer.

731
00:56:49,501 --> 00:56:51,523
They say the insurance doesn't cover it.

732
00:56:52,986 --> 00:56:56,330
Shit, a person doesn't pick and choose what cancer they get.

733
00:57:00,104 --> 00:57:01,633
Is this a human being?

734
00:57:03,899 --> 00:57:08,500
The So In Chan you used to know may have been a human, but now, I'm no human being.

735
00:57:12,364 --> 00:57:15,607
And you, what are you doing right now next to me?

736
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:22,272
Why did you have to keep by my side and see me even like this, why?

737
00:57:25,095 --> 00:57:27,291
Why?

738
00:57:41,761 --> 00:57:44,773
Things will work out if we put in efforts,

739
00:57:44,773 --> 00:57:46,854
let's work hard . . .

740
00:57:47,911 --> 00:57:50,691
For always saying only those things,

741
00:57:56,054 --> 00:57:57,825
I'm sorry.

742
00:58:00,339 --> 00:58:01,461
But

743
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:05,538
I really thought

744
00:58:05,538 --> 00:58:07,849
things would work out that way.

745
00:58:09,223 --> 00:58:13,001
Because we worked so hard,

746
00:58:13,001 --> 00:58:15,106
because, besides

747
00:58:15,106 --> 00:58:17,983
working hard,

748
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:21,003
we had no other option.

749
00:58:24,516 --> 00:58:26,479
So let's break up.

750
00:58:29,238 --> 00:58:33,573
If you stay by my side, I think I'll really go crazy.

751
00:58:33,573 --> 00:58:37,767
I'll really go crazy because I'll be such a loser and failure.

752
00:58:56,778 --> 00:58:58,651
I'm sorry.

753
00:59:00,742 --> 00:59:03,280
For making you say even these things.

754
00:59:04,734 --> 00:59:11,390
For forcing you to say even these things.

755
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:15,633
I am really sorry, Oppa.

756
00:59:25,996 --> 00:59:28,579
I'm sorry.

757
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:42,099
What about you, who has to please a loser?

758
00:59:42,099 --> 00:59:44,843
And what about your husband?

759
00:59:44,843 --> 00:59:49,424
This time, please protect me.

760
00:59:49,424 --> 00:59:54,670
You're still as selfish as you were before.

761
00:59:56,468 --> 01:00:01,711
Don't worry.  I only came here to return something.

762
01:00:01,711 --> 01:00:04,241
<i> S. J. Cha </i>

763
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:21,279
<i>Y. J. Cha</i>

764
01:00:21,279 --> 01:00:23,453
<i> S. J. Cha</i>

765
01:00:54,528 --> 01:00:58,784
Se Kyung, don't worry.

766
01:00:58,784 --> 01:01:02,253
Our house won't be foreclosed.

767
01:01:02,253 --> 01:01:05,956
I'll repay our debts somehow.

768
01:01:05,956 --> 01:01:09,854
How?

769
01:01:09,854 --> 01:01:15,686
I'll have to work hard.  When haven't we worked hard?

770
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:20,189
Yes Dad.

771
01:01:20,189 --> 01:01:24,943
Is there a time when we didn't try hard?

772
01:01:24,943 --> 01:01:29,870
But, if it's true that

773
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:32,866
what you get out of something depends on how hard you try.

774
01:01:32,866 --> 01:01:36,550
Why do we live like this?

775
01:01:37,586 --> 01:01:40,960
There is no answer.

776
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:46,198
No matter how hard I try, there is no answer.

777
01:01:46,198 --> 01:01:50,970
Who doesn't know that.

778
01:01:51,891 --> 01:01:56,368
Even if you try, nothing will be different.

779
01:01:56,368 --> 01:01:59,929
There is nothing to get better.

780
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:04,692
If you accept that, you can't live.

781
01:02:04,692 --> 01:02:08,058
If you try, it will be okay.  Things will get better.

782
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:12,579
It is with at least that hope that we're able to live.

783
01:02:12,579 --> 01:02:20,088
We aren't the only people who live like that.  Everyone in the world lives like that.

784
01:02:20,858 --> 01:02:27,874
That's the only way.

785
01:02:46,136 --> 01:02:49,834
<i>No matter how hard I try, nothing changes.</i>

786
01:02:49,834 --> 01:02:56,373
<i>What gets better if I try?  The only thing that gets bigger is my despair.</i>

787
01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:09,758
<i>How could I not pick you?</i>

788
01:03:09,758 --> 01:03:12,950
<i>You were trying so hard.</i>

789
01:03:20,322 --> 01:03:26,407
<i>What's important is that thanks to someone like me, you got a job.</i>

790
01:03:26,407 --> 01:03:33,696
<i>And no matter what I'm like, I earned my place through my work</i>

791
01:03:33,696 --> 01:03:35,822
<i>and my abilities.</i>

792
01:03:35,822 --> 01:03:40,888
<i> L'effort est ma force
My effort is what makes me.</i>

793
01:03:53,672 --> 01:03:58,902
Ma'am, you have a visitor.

794
01:03:58,902 --> 01:04:03,304
A visitor?

795
01:04:53,287 --> 01:04:56,533
I didn't give you any orders.

796
01:04:58,368 --> 01:05:02,286
There was something I wanted to ask you.

797
01:05:03,125 --> 01:05:06,178
You speak some French, right?

798
01:05:06,178 --> 01:05:09,556
Yes.  But why?

799
01:05:09,556 --> 01:05:15,215
Have you been to France before?

800
01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:18,158
I have.  But why?

801
01:05:18,158 --> 01:05:24,051
When you were in France, you were Cha Yoon Joo, right?

802
01:05:27,307 --> 01:05:32,677
I saw it.  The photo.

803
01:05:36,707 --> 01:05:41,219
It's this, right?

804
01:05:45,947 --> 01:05:48,694
It's okay if you delete it.

805
01:05:57,610 --> 01:06:00,626
What are you?

806
01:06:01,901 --> 01:06:11,355
I can tell from your surprise that the president--your husband, doesn't know yet.

807
01:06:11,355 --> 01:06:13,746
You said that

808
01:06:13,746 --> 01:06:20,399
whatever you're like, you earned your place through your own work and abilities.

809
01:06:20,399 --> 01:06:25,361
Did you really try hard?

810
01:06:25,361 --> 01:06:26,341
What?

811
01:06:26,341 --> 01:06:32,046
Did you really try hard to get to the place you are now?

812
01:06:32,046 --> 01:06:33,906
Is it true?

813
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:37,321
Is it true that your efforts are what put you in this place?

814
01:06:37,321 --> 01:06:39,865
Han Se Kyung.

815
01:06:39,865 --> 01:06:43,990
What are you trying to do?

816
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:48,852
Do you think that you can steal this place that I've earned through my work with one photograph?

817
01:06:48,852 --> 01:06:51,568
Are you trying to blackmail me and threaten to knock me out of my position?

818
01:06:51,568 --> 01:06:55,121
Yes.  You're right.

819
01:06:55,121 --> 01:06:58,694
I'm threatening you right now.

820
01:06:58,694 --> 01:07:02,031
But I'm not saying I'll knock you out of your position.

821
01:07:02,031 --> 01:07:04,248
Don't worry

822
01:07:04,248 --> 01:07:10,070
What are you trying to do?

823
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:12,969
Tell me how.

824
01:07:12,969 --> 01:07:13,947
What?

825
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:16,499
L'effort est ma force.

826
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:20,161
Tell me with what efforts you were able to get to your position.

827
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,664
Let me know as well.

828
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:24,688
Yes, the

829
01:07:24,688 --> 01:07:27,217
abilities, the effort that made you what you are.

830
01:07:27,217 --> 01:07:30,760
That secret.

831
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:35,520
Let me know it as well.

832
01:07:39,121 --> 01:08:14,881

834
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:19,583
You were able to.  Why can't I?

835
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,088
Just because I was able to

836
01:08:21,088 --> 01:08:23,314
means that you can as well?

837
01:08:25,212 --> 01:08:26,971
It tickles right here.

838
01:08:26,971 --> 01:08:30,016
And my heart flutters.

839
01:08:30,016 --> 01:08:32,221
Did you volunteer?

840
01:08:32,221 --> 01:08:33,359
Rumors?

841
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,661
What rumors?

842
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,364
A woman?

843
01:08:36,364 --> 01:08:37,872
A woman.

844
01:08:37,872 --> 01:08:40,556
If my text messages make you uncomfortable, then tell me that they are.

845
01:08:40,556 --> 01:08:41,878
He's definitely bad luck.

846
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:46,864
Figure out what their relationship is.

847
01:08:46,864 --> 01:08:48,623
In life,

848
01:08:48,623 --> 01:08:50,034
there are things that pass

849
01:08:50,034 --> 01:08:53,445
and things that do not pass.

850
01:08:53,445 --> 01:08:56,020
I'll do what I want to.

851
01:08:58,782 --> 01:09:00,070
Isn't it crazy?

852
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:02,030
What's wrong? Why are you suddenly...

853
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:04,198
What's that?

854
01:09:04,198 --> 01:09:05,845
Start right now.

855
01:09:05,845 --> 01:09:08,219
Don't you know anything about your president?

856
01:09:11,577 --> 01:09:16,137
There is love.
