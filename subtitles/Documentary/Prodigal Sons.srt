1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:04,904
(wind whistling faintly,
birds chirping)

2
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:21,888
Woman: My brothers and I
grew up in the '70s in Montana.

3
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:25,091
Everyone called it
the big sky country.

4
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:28,294
It seemed anything
could happen there.

5
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:29,896
And anything did.

6
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,166
My dad, Loren,
was a doctor.

7
00:00:36,502 --> 00:00:40,106
My mom, Carol,
was a schoolteacher.

8
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,311
They adopted
my older brother Marc

9
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:47,713
because they thought they
couldn't have children.

10
00:00:53,986 --> 00:00:55,187
The day they picked him up

11
00:00:55,187 --> 00:00:58,391
was probably the day
they conceived me.

12
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,994
Hormones are sometimes
unpredictable that way.

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,437
A year later,
along came another surprise,

14
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:13,439
our younger brother,
Todd.

15
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:23,249
(clapping and cheering)

16
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,651
It looks like
a fairytale childhood,

17
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:28,054
but appearances
can be deceiving.

18
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:32,458
After high school,
I left for san Francisco,

19
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,860
then new York.

20
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,862
I'd never stopped loving
my home,

21
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,864
but I never really returned.

22
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:44,403
I thought I’d put
my past behind me,

23
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:45,605
but 20 years later,

24
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,808
I decided to go back
for my high school reunion.

25
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,413
My brother Marc
was in the same grade as me,

26
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,216
so he was going to be
at the reunion, too.

27
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,621
I was nervous about seeing
my classmates,

28
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,824
but I was more nervous
about seeing Marc.

29
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:08,427
We'd been estranged
for more than a decade.

30
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,507
Kim is here this week
from new York

31
00:02:21,907 --> 00:02:23,109
for the class reunion.

32
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,511
Marc comes in tonight.

33
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:29,115
Two more come in today
around midnight.

34
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:32,318
And so it's wild
and crazy.

35
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,825
It wasn't too shabby,
that little plane.

36
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:41,160
Good.

37
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,764
Compared to the big ones,
you know,

38
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,166
it does ride
a little rougher.

39
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,570
Mom and I were walking
on eggshells around Marc.

40
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,172
We always did.

41
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,974
It was going to be
the longest Marc and I

42
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,376
would spend together
in years.

43
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:59,378
Marc,
show me your scar.

44
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,781
What scar,
this thing?
Yeah.

45
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,984
Well, you can't see it all yet,
but it's getting worse.

46
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,585
Badge of honor.

47
00:03:06,585 --> 00:03:09,388
It's getting worse.
Badge of honor.

48
00:03:09,388 --> 00:03:12,491
The rest of that hair goes,
you'll see.

49
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:16,429
We'd had a rough time being
siblings the first time around.

50
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,431
Marc was held back
in preschool,

51
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,433
putting us
in the same class.

52
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,235
So he always felt a lot
of competition with me.

53
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:26,839
But I was hoping this
was our chance to start over.

54
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:30,309
Everybody ready to go?

55
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:33,913
Banana bread, anyone?

56
00:03:34,313 --> 00:03:36,716
I feel like we need
to do something

57
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,951
to commemorate
our departure.

58
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:42,555
Marc: I love Montana.
Montana is awesome.

59
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,891
My beautiful wife
doesn't like Montana.

60
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:52,298
I had a horrible accident
when I was young

61
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:56,302
in Las Vegas
and rolled my truck.

62
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:59,105
And then I had
part of my brain removed.

63
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,639
So it's been a tough one.

64
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,641
Yeah.
Yeah.

65
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:05,811
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Marc, but here's turtle rock,

66
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:07,413
your lovely
turtle rock.

67
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:14,487
I was born in Tacoma,
Washington.

68
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,889
Dr. Loren E. McKarrow
chose me,

69
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,160
and they brought me home,
and then...

70
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,562
Paul was born.

71
00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:27,967
(clears throat)
Paul, who is now Kim.

72
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:54,927
My dad had passed away
two years earlier.

73
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:02,535
He was the bedrock
of our family,

74
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,937
and we missed him.

75
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,939
He had known about
my transition for years,

76
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:11,343
and it amazed me
how easily he accepted me.

77
00:05:11,343 --> 00:05:13,345
But it was on the day
dad died

78
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:16,148
that Marc found out
I would be his sister.

79
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,353
We were on our way
to the farm

80
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:22,955
our great-grandfather
homesteaded.

81
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,156
It's where dad grew up,

82
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:26,158
and his two brothers
still live there.

83
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:28,160
And there was a big,
huge grain elevator

84
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:31,363
that was built
by my dad and his brothers

85
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:32,832
in one summer.

86
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,834
You know they built that
in one summer?

87
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,435
Yeah.
It's incredible.

88
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:40,039
Yeah, that's where
it all goes back to.

89
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,842
What'd you say, Marc?
Yeah.

90
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,443
Going back to the farm.

91
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:52,351
Hey!
Good to see you!

92
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:53,786
Somebody's got it.

93
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:55,788
We're missing somebody?

94
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,389
Hi, Marc.
Hello.

95
00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:59,792
Wasn't surprised
that you were coming.

96
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,761
Hi, darling.
So good to see you.

97
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:04,763
(indistinct conversations)

98
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:15,040
Marc,
what do you think?

99
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,942
That's the way to go.

100
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:19,745
What do you think is the front?
The one with the bow?

101
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:22,147
I'd definitely keep the bow
in front.

102
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,749
The bow in front?
Yeah.

103
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:26,151
You think?
Gotta have it in front.

104
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:29,755
You're so concerned
about my bow.

105
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:31,357
(laughter)

106
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,958
I need that cowboy hat.

107
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,560
I think that's another
McKarrow trait,

108
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,163
is the little, tiny...
grab that cowboy hat
there.

109
00:06:38,163 --> 00:06:39,765
Oh, that's me.

110
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:41,767
Ooh, that's dusty.

111
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:44,169
That...
that's the real me.

112
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:47,773
Mm-hmm.
(clicks tongue)

113
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:49,375
It hangs up
on your visor.

114
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,777
Oh. Oh no,
this is for money.

115
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:53,779
Meter money
and your pencils

116
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:57,783
and receipts
and sunglasses and coins.

117
00:06:57,783 --> 00:06:59,385
Just found that today.

118
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:02,588
One word for ya...
plastics.
Yep.

119
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:32,251
Man:
What were you playing?

120
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,653
I do not know.

121
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:41,060
I was just playing whatever
my lovely fingers play.

122
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,062
(chuckles)

123
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,664
That's the thing
I don't understand.

124
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:48,467
It's just something
that...

125
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,469
I don't know
where it came from.

126
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:53,272
It's another reason
I want to research

127
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,674
the family
a little bit more.

128
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,077
Bye.

129
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:01,814
My hometown had heard about
my transition a while ago.

130
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:05,417
Just before my dad's funeral,
my mom had a tea party

131
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:07,820
and broke the news
to her closest friends,

132
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,023
then asked them
to spread the word.

133
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:13,993
Mom kept saying
that my dad had died

134
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,395
but I was being reborn.

135
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,397
So my classmates
had heard about me,

136
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,399
but this was going to be
the first time

137
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,602
most of them
would actually see me.

138
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:27,206
We're going to a barbeque,
and everybody's gonna be there.

139
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:30,576
And there's already like
14 trucks parked outside.

140
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,177
And there's a Budweiser...

141
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:33,379
Claire:
She's wigging out!

142
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,781
I'm wigging, kinda.
I'm a little bit nervous.

143
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,516
This party is at
Kevin Bartsch's house.

144
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:39,518
Kevin Bartsch
was the co-captain

145
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:42,721
of the football team
with yours truly.

146
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:44,056
Announcer:
Paul McKerrow!

147
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,058
Newscaster: Let's run down
the Bengal offense for you.

148
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,060
They're led by senior
quarterback Paul McKerrow,

149
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,062
who wears number 7
in the backfield.

150
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:51,663
Newscaster: McKerrow's throwing
the ball right on the button.

151
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,665
I'm pretty impressed
with his throwing arm tonight

152
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:54,867
and his accuracy.

153
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,468
McKerrow’s passed
to 56...

154
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,470
so far what I’ve seen
of McKerrow,

155
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,671
this quarterback
for Helena high,

156
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,273
he is a darn good one,

157
00:09:01,273 --> 00:09:02,875
and I wouldn't be surprised
a bit

158
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,877
if he went
to a major college.

159
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,879
(Marching band playing,
crowd talking indistinctly)

160
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,689
Twenty years ago,

161
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:20,092
they'd voted me
most likely to succeed.

162
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:23,295
Now I was just hoping
they wouldn't laugh at me.

163
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:24,797
Hey, john!

164
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,799
Hey, Kim.
How are you?

165
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,601
You have to come all the way
to Montana to see me?

166
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,470
How are you?
Nice to see you.

167
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,072
Is that Gina?
That's Gina.

168
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,673
Hi, Gina,
how are you?

169
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,076
Good, how are you?
It's good to see you.
I'm nervous.

170
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,277
I need a beer.

171
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:40,479
(indistinct conversations)

172
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,481
I have doubles at home
anyway.

173
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,883
What is it?
What is that picture?

174
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:47,252
A picture of her and I
at a dance

175
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:48,454
freshmen in high school.

176
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:52,057
Yeah, put your arm
around me.

177
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:56,662
All the girls that...
like, Anna and Cindy and...

178
00:09:57,062 --> 00:09:58,664
they were all upset

179
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:02,267
because he asked me
and not them

180
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:04,670
'cause they all had crushes
on him.

181
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,521
Cheers!

182
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,523
(indistinct conversations)

183
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:29,261
I don't recognize you,
that's for sure.
She remembers you.

184
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:32,064
You do?
Not me.

185
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:35,567
Do you know who I am?
Oh, yes.
Yes, I do.

186
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,338
Does anybody in this city
not know who I am by now?

187
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,740
Does anybody in this city
not know who I am?

188
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,342
I so need to move.

189
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,943
Everybody knows
who you are.
Your name is Nanc...

190
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,945
Chris, Marc!
Chris!
Chris Welles.

191
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,748
Jesus!
Pullman!
Pullman!

192
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:51,750
Chris Pullman.

193
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,754
Give me a break, though.
I got a head injury.

194
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:58,023
Have you seen
our annual?
No.

195
00:10:58,423 --> 00:11:00,826
I'll bring it tomorrow.
I would love to see that.

196
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,427
Oh, god.

197
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:05,631
It took me years to get her
to show me old photos.
(sighs)

198
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,834
She was just like,
"no, no, that's the past.

199
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:10,435
"It's a part of my life

200
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,039
that I don't want to be
in touch with anymore."

201
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,807
The cop,
when he pulled us over...

202
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:19,278
and you don't remember this...
he says, "I clocked you at 105,

203
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,481
"and I shut the radar off
at 105,

204
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,816
and you guys blew by me
at 120."

205
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:28,420
I kid you not... 120.

206
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,556
(laughs)

207
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,962
Actually, I had never seen a keg
in real life until tonight.

208
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,364
I was a Mormon.

209
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,767
I escaped.
I recovered.

210
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,369
Yeah, in fact...
sure.

211
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,772
I don't know,
is it cool to sit on the cars?

212
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:48,774
Woman: I can understand
her being nervous,

213
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,375
because it is Montana.

214
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,045
Compared to new York,
I’m sure we're like hickville.

215
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,047
Maybe she was anticipating
more adverse reaction?

216
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:57,849
I don't know,
but I haven't felt that

217
00:11:57,849 --> 00:11:59,851
or heard anybody
even say anything like that.

218
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:01,453
I said, "yeah, I had a dream
we were all partying

219
00:12:01,853 --> 00:12:03,855
at your house,
and we were all fat, bald,

220
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,857
and old,
and you were a girl!"

221
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:09,461
I mean, all of us have changed,
and all of us are different

222
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:11,863
and maybe not
what we thought we would be.

223
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,266
Marc:
I didn't quit mine.

224
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,469
I had to do
the bankruptcy scene.
Well, that's...

225
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:19,871
I don't know if you guys
heard about that, but...

226
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:22,274
I think you were getting...
starting in on that

227
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,676
the last time we saw you.

228
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:25,877
That wasn't fun.

229
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:27,879
No, not at all.

230
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,481
Hopefully that day'll come

231
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:31,483
when they get this brain
straightened out enough,

232
00:12:31,483 --> 00:12:33,485
and get
the right medications

233
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:35,487
to where I can
get back to work, so...
yeah.

234
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:38,023
Man: The two main things
I remember about Marc McKarrow...

235
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,959
one night I went out with him
partying very hard,

236
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,362
and he may or may not
have had relations

237
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,364
with a young woman
on my mother's couch.

238
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:46,965
So that's number one.

239
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:49,701
Number two
is I sold him my car

240
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:52,104
shortly around
the end of high school,

241
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,307
and he never paid me for it
and he blew up the engine.

242
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,910
And then I had to take him
to small claims court,

243
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:02,281
and he never showed up.

244
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:06,218
But, again,
really nice guy.

245
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:07,819
And, you know,
I didn't know

246
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:10,222
she was a woman driver
at the time,

247
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:13,025
but her actions
should have tipped me off,

248
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,827
because we come up
to this intersection,

249
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,429
and it's glare ice,

250
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:21,667
and the light turns red,
and Paul keeps going.

251
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,469
And cars are just, like,
sliding into this,

252
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:26,872
and we're all holding
on for dear life,

253
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:29,675
and it all's over,
and everybody's like, "ahh..."

254
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:33,278
and I said, "well,
that was a tremendous example

255
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:38,483
of defensive driving
on the part of everybody else."

256
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:41,853
How can you be a male,
and now you're a female,

257
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:43,455
but yet you like females?

258
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,925
You know
who you are as a woman,

259
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:48,927
and you identify
as a woman, right?

260
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,531
You can accept the fact
that maybe...

261
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,533
I mean, you even said,
earlier tonight,

262
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,935
you said you wish you could be
a lesbian, right?

263
00:13:56,935 --> 00:14:00,872
So you can conceive of...
I really do.

264
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,874
With a little bit
of shock therapy,

265
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:04,876
I think we can make
that happen.

266
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,679
I'm so kidding.
I really couldn't.
I really couldn't.

267
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,082
I wish I could.
That's such a bad joke.

268
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,084
I could as far as,
like, mentally,

269
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:15,687
but not as far
as physically.

270
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:18,757
I still don't get
the difference

271
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,293
between being homosexual,
gay, lesbian...

272
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,695
whatever the words are...
and transgender.

273
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:25,964
When you look in the mirror,
what do you see?

274
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,165
Do you see a woman?

275
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:28,600
(laughs) yeah.

276
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,403
Okay.
What are you attracted to?

277
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,604
Men.

278
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:34,206
Okay...
it's that simple.

279
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,407
Switch those up.

280
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:36,608
It's that simple.
You know?

281
00:14:36,608 --> 00:14:38,210
What if you looked
in the mirror,

282
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,811
and you saw
the wrong thing,

283
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:43,148
and you were still attracted
to men?

284
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:46,718
"Words...
Paul McKerrow, the real man!"

285
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:49,121
Oh, man,
that's funny,

286
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,523
because I always remembered that
as a question mark,

287
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,925
but it's
an exclamation point.

288
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:55,527
(laughs)

289
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:59,931
Hmm! Somebody was
a little confused. Okay.

290
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,300
(tom petty's "American girl"
playing)

291
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,163
Being back in Helena
reminded me

292
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,965
how conflicted I used to be
about my gender.

293
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,173
If being masculine meant
throwing a football,

294
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,575
I was going to throw
the perfect spiral.

295
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:51,583
I thought that would fix me
and that it would prove to me

296
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,386
and to everyone else
I was normal.

297
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,792
So we're on about
the 10-yard line,

298
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:03,195
20-yard line.

299
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:05,997
My first kiss
was on the bleachers

300
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:07,933
inside the gym there.

301
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:12,904
I was having so many problems
trying to figure out my gender

302
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:15,307
that I would find
all of these ways

303
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,910
to kind of foist the decision
of whether or not

304
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,113
I was gonna be a female
onto something else,

305
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,516
and I always used to have
these games

306
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:25,951
that I would play,

307
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,753
stuff like if you don't run
to that sign in 10 seconds,

308
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:30,355
then you have to be
a girl tonight.

309
00:16:30,755 --> 00:16:32,357
So I’d always run
just slow enough

310
00:16:32,357 --> 00:16:33,825
so I’d have to be a girl.

311
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:36,228
"Oh, I have to be
a girl tonight."

312
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,829
Ridiculous.

313
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,700
You know, I shut
a lot of this out.

314
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:48,073
Guess I’m here
to bring it back somehow.

315
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:51,276
I don't need to relive
my high school football games,

316
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,678
but, you know,

317
00:16:53,678 --> 00:16:57,682
it's a shame that I just had
to forget half of my life.

318
00:17:03,688 --> 00:17:06,491
Since my transition,
I’d just wanted to pass,

319
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:09,694
to fit in and disappear.

320
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:10,896
And I’d done that.

321
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:14,499
I was a magazine editor
in new York,

322
00:17:14,499 --> 00:17:17,702
but none of my friends
knew about my life in Helena.

323
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,908
So actually talking
about being transgender

324
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,310
was really new to me.

325
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,712
Marc: I just remember
the good old times.

326
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:32,117
And the kegger times
and the fun times and the...

327
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:37,255
remembering my el Camino
and my Camaro and...

328
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:40,859
you... you have
a lot of car stories.
(laughs)

329
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,995
I was a mad man.
I was...
yeah.

330
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:45,931
I was the party animal.
I know.

331
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,567
You were doing that, like,
long before I was.

332
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,369
I used to do keggers
big-time.

333
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:54,973
You weren't near as much
into those as I was.
I wasn't.

334
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,776
That's 'cause I was a dork.
No, you weren't no dork.

335
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,178
You just weren't as much
in...

336
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:02,180
you were a sport fanatic,
buddy.

337
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,182
Well, I was a bit
of a dork, too.

338
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:06,184
I loved sports, too,
was the problem.

339
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:08,587
I just didn't put
my concentration on 'em,

340
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:12,424
that was the problem,
and I had something there

341
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:16,027
that kept me from being
what I could have been.

342
00:18:16,027 --> 00:18:19,230
(slow piano music,
indistinct conversations)

343
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:26,838
No, I don't...
I get really tense.

344
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:30,442
I can't play with people.
It's real hard, I...

345
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,844
would you rather I go
in the other room?
Huh?

346
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:34,446
Would you rather I go
in the other room?

347
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,448
(plays notes)

348
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:38,850
No, it's just such a...
I don't know what it is.

349
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,252
When I know people
are listening, it's just...

350
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,856
it's a good song.

351
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:47,258
(piano music resumes)

352
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:58,470
Marc!

353
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,872
Ah! Get too tensed up
when I have people watching.

354
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:03,675
I can't play.
I get... oh, I know.

355
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,478
I just... it's hard.

356
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,282
Marc crashed his car
when he was 21,

357
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:12,884
but he recovered quickly.

358
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:14,486
Then five years later,

359
00:19:14,886 --> 00:19:16,888
he suddenly started getting
seizures.

360
00:19:16,888 --> 00:19:19,290
He had surgery
after surgery.

361
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,892
His mood swings got worse.

362
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:23,261
He started
on serious medications.

363
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:25,797
His short-term memory
began to fade,

364
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:29,200
and he started clinging
to the past more than ever.

365
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,770
But I wasn't there
for any of that.

366
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,172
I was changing myself.

367
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:37,375
So much had changed
in the decade we'd spent apart,

368
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,178
I’d hoped we could reinvent
our relationship,

369
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:41,379
but over the next few days,

370
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,182
I began to see how some things
were just the same

371
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:45,383
or even worse.

372
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:49,154
I spoiled myself rotten

373
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:52,757
by continuing to think
all I had to do was say, "dad!"

374
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:56,594
I was the first kid
in the family,

375
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:58,596
and then boom,
11 months later...

376
00:19:58,596 --> 00:20:00,198
(snaps fingers)
Here comes somebody else.

377
00:20:00,598 --> 00:20:03,001
And, boom, a year later,
here comes Todd.

378
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,403
But I was actually
the first kid.

379
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:08,473
That's why I felt
like I was the number one.

380
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,475
But then here comes preschool,
and they say,

381
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:13,678
"Marc,
you're too hyperactive!

382
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,814
"Slow down!
(laughter)

383
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:19,818
We're gonna keep you
in preschool one more year."

384
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,021
"What!?
Preschool?"

385
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:27,025
And then, boom, guess who's
in preschool with me?

386
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:32,630
They put him, this one,
in preschool with me at the...

387
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,634
so I had to grow up
next to that one all my life.

388
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,838
And this one was taking all
the top-notch stuff in school.

389
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:43,041
And I... I... so my brain
was saying,

390
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,644
holy sheisty von-don,
man.

391
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:51,816
Marc: Do you recollect
prior to the injury

392
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,152
how hard school
was for me?

393
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,154
I know, Marc.

394
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:59,724
'Cause here I was
taking all the basic shit,

395
00:20:59,724 --> 00:21:02,660
and, you know,
I got a brother

396
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,264
that's taking
all the major shit.

397
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:07,866
So I had to hide that.

398
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,268
That hurt the fuck...
excuse my language,

399
00:21:10,668 --> 00:21:13,071
but I was still able
to keep popularity.

400
00:21:13,471 --> 00:21:17,675
Get your pill out now,
and take the...
I’m okay!

401
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:20,879
No, Marc, you're getting...
you're getting wound up.

402
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,281
Would you quit thinking
I’m...

403
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:27,685
well, you are getting
wound up.
No, I’m not!

404
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:35,527
I had a severe injury,

405
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:39,130
and I had a very harsh part
of my brain removed.

406
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,333
And I... I am on beaucoup
medication.

407
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:47,539
So harsh behavioral transactions
do take place

408
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:52,744
that I have no control over
when it takes place.

409
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,746
It is not the real me.

410
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,949
You gotta look
at the reality of I have...

411
00:21:58,349 --> 00:22:01,953
a big part
of my head missing!

412
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:05,757
(shouting)
The other part of it is

413
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:10,728
is when
I was 21 years old,

414
00:22:10,728 --> 00:22:14,732
I about died,
and went off of a blazer

415
00:22:14,732 --> 00:22:17,135
that went boom!

416
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:20,305
? and I’m lucky
to be alive!?

417
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:23,675
Do you want me to call
the neurologi...

418
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:29,280
the neurologist surgeon?!
In Seattle?!

419
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,683
Want me to take you there

420
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:36,087
so they pull out the stuff
and show you my brain?!

421
00:22:36,487 --> 00:22:38,890
That half of it's
missing?!

422
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,091
Huh?!

423
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:42,493
Marc, I know.
To show you the truth?!

424
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:43,695
Marc...

425
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:48,099
since you don't want
to believe it?!

426
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:50,501
Come on, Claire,
please.

427
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:52,503
Claire, please.
Come on.

428
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,462
I couldn't believe
how bad Marc had gotten.

429
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:20,265
I thought I’d return
for the reunion,

430
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:22,667
but it was going to be
much more complicated.

431
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,273
Carol:
It's just day and night.

432
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,275
It's very puzzling.

433
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,277
It's very exhausting.

434
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:37,482
Marc feels very badly
after it's over.

435
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:40,285
The seizures were bad,
so he had surgery,

436
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:41,886
and there were two of those

437
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:45,890
to remove the scar tissue
that was causing the seizures.

438
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:51,496
The seizures got better,
but the mood swings increased.

439
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:57,468
See, I...
Loren was the detail person.

440
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,470
And I...

441
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,674
the less I knew
about what they were doing...

442
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:06,277
I didn't need to know
all the details.

443
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:10,281
There's just always been
something about Kim

444
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,084
that has been threatening.

445
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:17,689
Marc was wondering,
"why don't I hear from Paul?"

446
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:20,892
And that was very difficult
for me.

447
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,695
I was, you know...

448
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:27,298
using every reason
in the book.

449
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:28,900
So that was difficult,

450
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,703
those years that he wasn't
hearing from Paul.

451
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:37,709
But I do know that Marc
would give anything in the world

452
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:42,513
if... if they could
be on a good...

453
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:45,316
on a good...

454
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,719
string.

455
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,326
Claire was flying back home
to new York,

456
00:24:55,326 --> 00:24:59,330
back to our apartment,
our dogs, our stability.

457
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:02,934
I felt compelled to stay around
for a few extra days.

458
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,336
Mom and I had been talking
about buying a cabin together,

459
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:07,338
and we needed to sort out
the details.

460
00:25:15,346 --> 00:25:17,749
Of course I get a hug.

461
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:20,952
You can't
not give me a hug.

462
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,755
Oh...

463
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,757
good to see you.
Good to meet you.

464
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:26,958
You too.

465
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:28,960
It was a pleasure.

466
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,996
And good luck
in everything you do.
Thank you.

467
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:35,199
I'm the one that needs
major luck too, though,

468
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:37,201
with this bizarre head
of mine.

469
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:39,737
I can't give you
enough thankfulness

470
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,739
for being by my side

471
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:45,743
for the unbelievable
negativity that you saw.

472
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,946
Well, it's really big of you
to apologize.

473
00:25:48,946 --> 00:25:52,150
It tears me up that
you guys went through it.

474
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,552
'Cause I’m not
that kind of person.

475
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,354
I'm glad to hear that.

476
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,756
I can say god bless
to the beautiful wife

477
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:00,758
and family I got.

478
00:26:00,758 --> 00:26:03,961
And I just want you both
to know that I appreciate

479
00:26:03,961 --> 00:26:05,963
everything
that you have done,

480
00:26:05,963 --> 00:26:08,366
and I appreciate you
being here for me,

481
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:15,173
and I love you both intensely,
and I am sorry immensely.

482
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,175
And I give you everything
in the world

483
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,577
for being by my side
and loving me

484
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:20,778
for who and what I am.

485
00:26:20,778 --> 00:26:23,181
Just try to hold on
to that positive attitude.

486
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,583
It'll get you far.
I will.
And you take care.

487
00:26:25,983 --> 00:26:27,585
I will.
And god bless ya.

488
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,587
Carol.

489
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:30,388
So glad you came.

490
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:33,191
I'm so glad you came,
my dear.

491
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:35,993
Oh, you're so welcome.
You're so welcome.

492
00:26:35,993 --> 00:26:38,796
See you in a few days?

493
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:51,342
You protected me, too.

494
00:26:53,344 --> 00:26:55,746
Scandalous.
Scandalous.

495
00:26:55,746 --> 00:26:56,948
Scandalous.

496
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:04,155
Marc was also heading home
later that afternoon.

497
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,557
It was a relief
to see him go.

498
00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:08,960
I'd reconnected
with my classmates,

499
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,362
and it seemed like I might even
be able to feel welcome

500
00:27:11,762 --> 00:27:13,364
in Montana again.

501
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:16,567
But that wouldn't happen
until I made peace with Marc.

502
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:19,370
I just wanted us
to be able to move on,

503
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,972
but before I knew it,

504
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:24,575
we'd ended up exactly
as we used to be.

505
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:27,778
Kim: There's still part of me...
like, I feel so guilty

506
00:27:27,778 --> 00:27:30,581
that I’m not talking
to him all the time

507
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:32,583
and supporting him
like you do,

508
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,786
like, you know,
the rest of the family does.

509
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:37,655
Do you think I should?

510
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,657
Well,
I hope you will now

511
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:41,659
because I think
that he thinks

512
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:43,661
things are gonna
be better now.

513
00:27:44,061 --> 00:27:45,663
You mean after the reunion?
Mm-hmm.

514
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:49,667
I tried to work out just where
things were going wrong.

515
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:52,470
It felt like Marc
would have given anything

516
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:56,073
to be the man I’d have given
anything not to be.

517
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:02,480
We were both haunted
by the same ghost.

518
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:10,087
I had no idea
how to solve it.

519
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,089
I wondered whether
I should just handle it

520
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:13,691
like our younger brother,
Todd.

521
00:28:14,091 --> 00:28:17,295
He had escaped to a life
as an architect in san Diego

522
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,297
and barely spoke to Marc.

523
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:22,466
(cell phone rings)

524
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:23,668
It's Claire.

525
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:26,003
The gay ring.

526
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:28,406
Todd's my buddy.

527
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:31,609
He came out as gay
before I transitioned,

528
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:33,211
and for a few years,

529
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,846
we were the only ones
who knew each other's secrets.

530
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,848
What?

531
00:28:37,848 --> 00:28:40,251
Here, tell Claire
what you won last night.

532
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,653
Hey, guess what I won?

533
00:28:42,653 --> 00:28:46,657
I won the comedy central thing
for work.

534
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,259
I'm the fun...

535
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,661
one of the funniest guys
at work, ha ha ha ha.

536
00:28:50,661 --> 00:28:52,863
This is funny.

537
00:28:52,863 --> 00:28:58,269
So that's Marc, and that's me,
and that's my cousin.

538
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,872
And we would
always put on plays

539
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,675
for everybody,
for the family.

540
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:08,279
And Susan always wanted
to have a younger sister,

541
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,281
'cause she never had one.

542
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:13,084
So she would always make me play
the younger sister,

543
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,685
and Marc
was always the dad.

544
00:29:14,685 --> 00:29:17,488
You know, with that stuff,
I always used to feel left out.

545
00:29:17,888 --> 00:29:19,090
Why?

546
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,492
I just... I was never involved
in any of that stuff.

547
00:29:21,892 --> 00:29:23,494
You were too butch.
I was too butch, yeah.

548
00:29:23,894 --> 00:29:27,098
You didn't want
to put on a dress.
I didn't.

549
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,100
I didn't either,
but she always made me.

550
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,102
You got stuck with it.

551
00:29:31,502 --> 00:29:35,906
Um, you know what,
is even at that age, the re...

552
00:29:35,906 --> 00:29:40,311
I was... I don't know
if I’ve ever told you this.

553
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:44,315
I thought that if
I touched women's clothing,

554
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:47,118
I would turn into a girl,
so I was afraid...

555
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,520
like, that...
you would turn
into a girl?

556
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,721
Yeah.
Why?

557
00:29:50,721 --> 00:29:53,124
At that age, I was more...
it's weird.

558
00:29:53,524 --> 00:29:55,526
Wow, you must have touched
a lot of...

559
00:29:55,526 --> 00:29:57,528
(laughs) I know.

560
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:04,168
When we were kids, Todd, Marc,
and I always made films.

561
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,152
There was never any question
who was going to be the star.

562
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,321
Marc always took
the limelight.

563
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:28,526
He would try on
any identity he could.

564
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,637
For several years,
Marc had been trying

565
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:42,840
to track down his birth parents
through the adoption agency.

566
00:30:45,242 --> 00:30:47,645
Marc: The other two
in the family,

567
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:50,047
they knew
where they came from.

568
00:30:50,047 --> 00:30:52,049
I didn't.

569
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:55,519
There was always
that side of me,

570
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:57,855
wondering
where's my blood?

571
00:30:57,855 --> 00:30:59,857
Where'd it come from?

572
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:02,259
My body, heart, and soul
said I wanna know

573
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:05,062
everything about me.

574
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:09,800
Imagine finding out
after 38 years

575
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,802
your family tree
is recognizable

576
00:31:11,802 --> 00:31:13,804
to just about every
classic movie fan.

577
00:31:13,804 --> 00:31:15,406
Rosebud...

578
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,007
reporter: Imagine how surprised
you'd be to find out

579
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:19,744
that movie stars Rita Hayworth
and Orson Welles

580
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:21,345
are your birth grandparents.

581
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:24,148
Oh, it's unbelievable
knowing...

582
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:28,152
finding out the truth
of where I originally came from,

583
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,754
um...

584
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:33,357
and what I was a part of
is astonishing.

585
00:31:33,357 --> 00:31:35,359
Reporter: Marc's birth mother,
Rebecca Welles,

586
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:37,762
was the daughter of Orson Welles
and Rita Hayworth,

587
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:40,564
who were married from 1943
to 1948.

588
00:31:40,564 --> 00:31:41,699
He learned that,
and other things

589
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,300
about his birth mother
Rebecca,

590
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,703
and they began communicating
by mail.

591
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:48,506
Just before the two were
to be reunited, Marc got a call.

592
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,107
His wife, Debbie.

593
00:31:50,107 --> 00:31:52,109
He called me on the cell phone
when I was at school

594
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,514
and told me that she died,
and then that also, you know,

595
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:59,717
Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth
were his grandparents,

596
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:03,320
and I was like, "oh, my gosh,"
you know?

597
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,123
It's so fulfilling for him.

598
00:32:06,123 --> 00:32:09,326
Finding out about who he was
means more to him

599
00:32:09,326 --> 00:32:11,729
that we'll ever understand.

600
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,932
If you think about it,
the last two years,

601
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:17,735
with the dad dying,
with finding out about Kim,

602
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:20,137
finding out about
your birth mom dying,

603
00:32:20,137 --> 00:32:23,340
and finding out about your
heritage being famous people,

604
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,110
I mean,
all these emotions.

605
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,913
I'm sure his head
is just busy all the time.

606
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:30,514
(slow piano music playing)

607
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,516
He was invited
to the funeral,

608
00:32:32,516 --> 00:32:34,518
which is where he learned
the news about Orson,

609
00:32:34,518 --> 00:32:38,122
the boy genius, and Rita,
the sex goddess.

610
00:32:38,522 --> 00:32:40,524
The first time Marc saw
his birth mother,

611
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:43,727
she was in a casket.

612
00:32:46,263 --> 00:32:47,865
News of Marc's existence

613
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:49,467
began to spread
through the Welles family.

614
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,869
He received a call
from Ojai Kodar,

615
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,838
Orson’s co-writer, muse,

616
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,907
and lover for the last
two decades of his life.

617
00:32:56,907 --> 00:32:58,709
Welles: Her name...

618
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:00,644
is Ojai.

619
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:04,949
Many other ladies flitted
across the front pages

620
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,351
and our cameras
never got close to them,

621
00:33:07,351 --> 00:33:09,520
but Ojai Kodar
was something else.

622
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,490
Marc: They weren't
officially married,

623
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,292
but they were soul mates
for 25 years.

624
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:17,995
Ojai wanted to fly him
and his family to Croatia

625
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:20,397
to meet her and to learn
about his grandfather.

626
00:33:20,397 --> 00:33:23,067
It had only been a month
since the reunion.

627
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,870
She just says
we really would give

628
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,272
anything in the world
to have you come out

629
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:32,943
and meet you and your wife,
and we can't wait to see you.

630
00:33:32,943 --> 00:33:35,346
He'd also been invited
to be in a documentary

631
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,615
about Orson’s unseen work.

632
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,216
It was going to be a big trip

633
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:42,820
because he'd never even left
the country before.

634
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,089
Oh, my goodness.

635
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,690
Home sweet home, huh?

636
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:50,694
So Marc asked me to come along
for moral support.

637
00:33:50,694 --> 00:33:52,096
It was just as well,

638
00:33:52,496 --> 00:33:54,899
because I would have pushed
for it if he hadn't.

639
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,301
I'd been a big fan
of Orson Welles for years.

640
00:33:57,301 --> 00:34:00,104
(indistinct conversations)

641
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:01,705
How you doing?

642
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:03,307
Good to see you.

643
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,709
My brother had always envied
my genes.

644
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,711
Now I envied his.

645
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,794
(telephone rings)

646
00:34:24,194 --> 00:34:26,196
(knock on door)

647
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:31,402
Hello. Debbie?
Yes.

648
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,404
Hi, Debbie.
I am Ojai, hi.

649
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,605
Nice to meet you.

650
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,206
Come on in.
Marc's on the deck.

651
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:39,410
This must be Kelsie.
You are Kelsie?

652
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,412
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi.

653
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,814
Marc:
Oh, my goodness.
Welcome to Croatia.

654
00:34:44,214 --> 00:34:45,015
Hello, America.

655
00:34:45,015 --> 00:34:47,017
Man: Hi.
I'm Sasha.

656
00:34:47,017 --> 00:34:49,820
Hello.
The one I’ve been
waiting for all my life.

657
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,222
I don't know about that,
but, hi.

658
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:53,824
Nice to see you.

659
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,226
Good to see you.

660
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:58,228
Oh, my goodness.

661
00:34:58,629 --> 00:34:59,830
Yes, exactly.

662
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,832
Oh, my goodness.
Debbie?

663
00:35:01,832 --> 00:35:03,434
No?
No, I’m Kim.

664
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,836
Ah, you are Kim.
Hi, Kim.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

665
00:35:05,836 --> 00:35:08,639
Thank you for everything
you're doing for my brother.

666
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,242
Yeah, well, um,
I organized a lunch.

667
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:14,478
It's astonishing
seeing you.

668
00:35:14,478 --> 00:35:16,080
Yeah. Sorry I’m keeping
my glasses on.

669
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,882
It means... it means...
it means the world to me.

670
00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:21,285
That's very sweet.
Inside and out.

671
00:35:21,685 --> 00:35:22,486
Thank you.

672
00:35:22,486 --> 00:35:25,689
I organized a lunch for us,
for all of us.

673
00:35:25,689 --> 00:35:28,025
Okay, are you hungry?

674
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,027
Yes, you are.

675
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,228
We're more than ready.

676
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,631
Yeah, good, let's go.

677
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:39,103
L... I can say
he looks like Orson.

678
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,304
Yes.

679
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,507
(laughs)

680
00:35:43,907 --> 00:35:47,511
Yeah, he has a little twinkle
in his eyes like he's...

681
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:51,815
(talking indistinctly)

682
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:56,220
You know that at one time,
we were contemplating

683
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,922
adopting a little boy
from brazil.

684
00:35:58,922 --> 00:36:01,325
It brings a tear
to my eyes.

685
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:04,528
He wanted so much
to have a boy.

686
00:36:04,528 --> 00:36:08,132
And not knowing you
is just a crime.

687
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:11,735
(voice breaking) it's a crime
to you and to your mother

688
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:13,737
and to everybody.

689
00:36:13,737 --> 00:36:16,540
I'm so sorry.

690
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,142
God bless you.

691
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:20,944
So sorry.

692
00:36:20,944 --> 00:36:23,347
I love you.

693
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,550
You're loved.

694
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:30,154
I love you.

695
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:31,755
I'm happy to know you.

696
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:34,558
Oh, god bless you.

697
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:37,361
Accepted.

698
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,763
We're together now.
Yes.

699
00:36:39,763 --> 00:36:41,765
That's what counts.
Right?

700
00:36:41,765 --> 00:36:42,566
Yes.

701
00:36:42,966 --> 00:36:44,168
Right here and now.

702
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:45,369
Yes.

703
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,970
You know it.

704
00:36:54,578 --> 00:36:56,180
Okay!

705
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,582
Yee-ha!

706
00:36:58,582 --> 00:37:00,984
Good job!

707
00:37:18,602 --> 00:37:20,204
Beautiful!

708
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:29,980
I'd never seen Marc
this happy.

709
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,982
Now he had an identity

710
00:37:31,982 --> 00:37:34,785
that wasn't built
in opposition to me.

711
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:36,386
That seemed to liberate him.

712
00:37:36,386 --> 00:37:38,756
I hoped
it would liberate me.

713
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,758
Marc was the one person

714
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,360
who wouldn't let me forget
my past.

715
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,763
My transgender friends
didn't talk at all

716
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:47,364
about their previous lives.

717
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,167
Some had even burned
all of their early photos.

718
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:53,771
So I thought if Marc could
let go of who I used to be

719
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,573
and embrace
his new Welles identity,

720
00:37:56,573 --> 00:37:58,976
we could finally lay Paul
to rest.

721
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:04,982
I want to see you
try on the vest.

722
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:07,518
Yeah.
Try it on for us.

723
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:12,523
My lovely grandpa's shirt.

724
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:14,858
They passed it on to me.

725
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,063
May not have the height,

726
00:38:20,063 --> 00:38:23,267
but I got the body size,
I think.

727
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:26,069
The vest is what he wore
in "dean martin show."

728
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:29,807
I think it just...
buttons on the top.

729
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,775
I can't figure out
what that is.

730
00:38:34,978 --> 00:38:37,981
Seems like this would button
onto the coat or something?

731
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:39,583
Oh,
maybe that's what it is.

732
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:41,185
Okay, so just pretend
like I’m not here.

733
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:44,388
That right?
Should I lower it?

734
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:46,790
Yeah,
that's about right.

735
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:50,727
With the new medication
that I have,

736
00:38:50,727 --> 00:38:52,729
I haven't
been having seizures,

737
00:38:52,729 --> 00:38:56,333
and my noggin
is starting to recollect.

738
00:38:56,333 --> 00:39:00,671
I'm astonished at the...
at last,

739
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,874
I’m becoming the person
I want to become.

740
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:10,681
And I’m getting the chance
to get out there and do it...

741
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,683
and go somewhere in life.

742
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:17,087
Hayworth:
? so if you love me?

743
00:39:17,087 --> 00:39:22,292
? then don't take your lips?

744
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:25,495
? or your arms?

745
00:39:25,495 --> 00:39:29,099
? or your love?

746
00:39:29,499 --> 00:39:35,105
? away?

747
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:43,113
Hello!

748
00:39:43,113 --> 00:39:45,315
Welcome to my house.

749
00:39:45,315 --> 00:39:46,917
What is this?

750
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:48,518
Oh, this is... I...

751
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:50,520
your food?
Your medicine?

752
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,722
Your... hello.

753
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,124
Uh, hi.

754
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:56,026
Just pictures, I’m...
pictures?

755
00:39:56,426 --> 00:39:57,628
Yeah.
What pictures?

756
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:00,430
Pictures of, uh... of...

757
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:03,233
of the McKerrow clan.

758
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:04,835
Oh, yeah?

759
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,436
We can look at them later?

760
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:08,038
Whenever.

761
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:11,174
Actually, your grandfather
bought these chairs

762
00:40:11,174 --> 00:40:12,376
and this table.

763
00:40:12,776 --> 00:40:15,545
This was his working room,

764
00:40:15,545 --> 00:40:17,948
and you see the little bit
of a chair here.

765
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:19,549
Oh, yeah, I do.

766
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,356
Stay like that.

767
00:40:38,101 --> 00:40:40,637
Okay...

768
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:42,639
(talking indistinctly)

769
00:40:45,442 --> 00:40:48,645
The briefness of...

770
00:40:48,645 --> 00:40:51,448
he wants to hear
from when you found out

771
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:53,450
and that point forward.

772
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,452
Like, just since
you've found out.

773
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:02,826
Okay, Marc, here,
tell us what's happened

774
00:41:03,226 --> 00:41:07,230
after you discover that you
are son of Rebecca Welles.

775
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:12,436
With my son?

776
00:41:12,836 --> 00:41:18,275
No. When you discover that
you are son of Rebecca Welles.

777
00:41:20,844 --> 00:41:24,448
Um...

778
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:26,049
it's...

779
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,990
Kim: I think he wants
to hear, like,

780
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,792
when you first got that news,
what did you do?

781
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:38,195
And then...
because, I mean,

782
00:41:38,595 --> 00:41:40,197
you just had this news
out of nowhere.

783
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:44,501
And I think that's the part
of the story he's looking for.

784
00:41:44,901 --> 00:41:46,503
Director:
What she told you.

785
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:50,507
Um,
it tore her up inside

786
00:41:50,907 --> 00:41:55,312
that it had happened
the way it did.

787
00:41:55,712 --> 00:42:00,751
And after you got the message
that your mother passed away,

788
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,352
what's happened?

789
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,721
Uh, they had a funer...
the casket.

790
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:08,725
It was open,
and so I was able to see her.

791
00:42:08,725 --> 00:42:12,062
So actually you saw her,
for the first time...

792
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:13,663
you saw her dead?

793
00:42:13,663 --> 00:42:15,265
I did.
Yeah.

794
00:42:15,265 --> 00:42:20,070
I saw her whole... yeah.

795
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:23,140
And I hugged her and I,
uh...

796
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,942
it was intense.

797
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:34,551
Well, you asked me
a few minutes

798
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:37,454
about this engraving
on the wall.

799
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:43,860
This was great-great-granduncle
of your grandfather.

800
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:49,733
Really.
His name was Ives,
like your great-grandmother.

801
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,735
Her name
was Beatrice Ives.

802
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:55,739
She was a famous pianist,
wonderful pianist.

803
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,541
Do you play?

804
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,543
Yeah,
but I don't know how.

805
00:42:59,943 --> 00:43:01,545
Well, uh...
I don't know...

806
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:03,146
I don't know
how to read music.

807
00:43:03,146 --> 00:43:05,148
I don't know chords.
I don't know nothing.

808
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:06,750
I just sit down and play.

809
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,752
Well,
that comes from her.

810
00:43:09,152 --> 00:43:11,955
And I wondered
where that came from.

811
00:43:11,955 --> 00:43:13,723
Okay.

812
00:43:13,723 --> 00:43:15,325
Thank you.

813
00:43:15,325 --> 00:43:16,927
Thank you, Marc.
Thanks a lot.

814
00:43:17,327 --> 00:43:19,329
Really, thanks a lot.

815
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:20,530
Okay.

816
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:22,132
Yes.

817
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:24,134
(indistinct conversations)

818
00:43:26,536 --> 00:43:29,106
We taking a break
or something?

819
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:31,508
Well,
I guess it's over.

820
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:33,110
Oh, it's over?
Yes.

821
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,512
I didn't want it
to be over.

822
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,761
That's you, Kelsey.

823
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:58,502
And that's the parents
that raised me.

824
00:44:03,573 --> 00:44:05,976
Here we are.

825
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:09,346
Marc, Paul, and Todd.

826
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,995
(both chuckle)

827
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:31,001
(laughter and conversation
in foreign language)

828
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:45,048
Marc, do you realize how
uncomfortable it makes me feel...

829
00:44:45,048 --> 00:44:48,251
hmm?
Do you realize how uncomfortable
the photos made me feel?

830
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:50,654
The what?
The photos.

831
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:53,456
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Claire has seen one photo
of me from high school,

832
00:44:53,456 --> 00:44:56,660
and that's 'cause we were
at the reunion.
Okay.

833
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,062
Do you see why it makes me
uncomfortable?

834
00:44:59,062 --> 00:45:01,464
Oh, I can understand that,
yes.

835
00:45:01,464 --> 00:45:02,666
I, um...

836
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,668
they were laughing at me,
Marc.

837
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:09,873
I guess it's all about...
what's in my head,

838
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:15,478
in developing a format
of my life story

839
00:45:15,478 --> 00:45:18,682
of what I went through
is why I do it.

840
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:21,484
I guess that's why
my head is...

841
00:45:21,484 --> 00:45:23,887
could you tell that story
without showing

842
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,090
a couple photos
that had me in it, too?

843
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:29,893
Could you have showed...
could you have shown, like,

844
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:32,696
190 photos
instead of 200?

845
00:45:33,096 --> 00:45:35,098
Would that really change
it that much?

846
00:45:35,098 --> 00:45:37,500
Because you know what, Marc?
Those 10 photo...

847
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,104
it would change it
a tremendous amount for me.

848
00:46:02,492 --> 00:46:06,496
Marc: I don't know about you,
but the truth is the truth.

849
00:46:06,496 --> 00:46:12,502
And if you can't bring up
just a little bit and piece

850
00:46:12,502 --> 00:46:16,906
of where she came from
and what she was all about,

851
00:46:16,906 --> 00:46:20,910
then the truth of the story
isn't there.

852
00:46:22,912 --> 00:46:27,317
Because that's the reality
of what my life's all about.

853
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:32,922
And that's the reality
of what Kim’s life's all about.

854
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:36,526
She can't say she's always been
where she's been.

855
00:46:45,735 --> 00:46:47,737
Debbie:
The first time Marc came over,

856
00:46:47,737 --> 00:46:50,940
he had a shoebox
full of pictures of his family.

857
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,942
And so he sat there
and went through

858
00:46:52,942 --> 00:46:56,146
and pointed out all of his
different family members

859
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,948
and the house he grew up in.

860
00:46:58,948 --> 00:47:02,152
And, you know,
that's not a thing a guy does

861
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:05,288
is, you know,
show off family photos

862
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:06,890
on a date, you know?

863
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:10,093
So I figured there must be
something in this guy

864
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,495
that I needed to pursue
to find out.

865
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:17,300
Kim:
You're right, Marc.

866
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,103
I should get over
a lot of that stuff.

867
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:22,906
But at the end of the day,
you know,

868
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:25,308
maybe I’m just not big enough
to get over it,

869
00:47:25,308 --> 00:47:26,509
and you know what?

870
00:47:26,509 --> 00:47:29,312
The photo thing
makes me uncomfortable.

871
00:47:29,312 --> 00:47:33,116
You know,
it's no different

872
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:36,319
than Todd
going up to somebody

873
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,522
and saying, "hey, guess what?
I'm gay."

874
00:47:39,522 --> 00:47:41,124
There isn't anybody
in this world

875
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:44,327
that doesn't accept people
for who and what they are

876
00:47:44,327 --> 00:47:46,129
and where they're at
today.

877
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:48,932
There's... there's a lot
of people who don't accept.

878
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:51,334
I've told people
about myself.

879
00:47:51,334 --> 00:47:54,504
They've stood up
and walked out of the room,

880
00:47:54,904 --> 00:47:56,506
never to talk to me again.

881
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:59,109
There's one sentence
that I can tell people,

882
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:01,911
and they will never want
to talk to me again.

883
00:48:01,911 --> 00:48:03,513
It's big news.

884
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:09,085
Well, that's where you
gotta let go of the negative.

885
00:48:09,085 --> 00:48:11,821
When I look at a photo
from me from high school,

886
00:48:11,821 --> 00:48:13,823
I don't see myself.

887
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,825
I see someone
who was trying really hard

888
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:19,028
to act in a certain way
to please other people

889
00:48:19,028 --> 00:48:21,831
and have a million
different facades

890
00:48:21,831 --> 00:48:25,435
and just kind of acting
the entire time.

891
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:27,036
That wasn't me.

892
00:48:27,036 --> 00:48:29,439
I was not comfortable
in my skin.

893
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,040
That wasn't me.

894
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:33,042
I know that.

895
00:48:33,042 --> 00:48:37,447
The truth within you...

896
00:48:37,847 --> 00:48:39,449
was hidden.

897
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:44,020
This is the first time
I’ve ever seen you two

898
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:49,058
talk this long
with different opinions.

899
00:48:49,058 --> 00:48:49,993
Yeah, you're right.

900
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:52,562
And it... and it ending
beautifully.

901
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:55,765
Yeah, I know,
usually if we differ at all,

902
00:48:55,765 --> 00:48:59,169
it's like...
yeah,
it starts to get...

903
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:02,772
and so I’m just
real excited that you...

904
00:49:02,772 --> 00:49:07,177
you guys are able to start
to communicate better.

905
00:49:08,778 --> 00:49:09,579
Bye, Marc.

906
00:49:09,979 --> 00:49:11,848
It's about that time.

907
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:13,450
Love you.
Love you.

908
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,051
It's been a great trip.

909
00:49:15,051 --> 00:49:17,053
It's been great.
Thank you for coming.

910
00:49:17,053 --> 00:49:18,655
Thank you so much.

911
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:21,458
I really like your new shirt.
Looks good on you.

912
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:25,462
We're gonna continue on
and make this awesome.

913
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,864
We're not gonna give up.

914
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:29,065
Good.

915
00:49:29,065 --> 00:49:31,067
In my body, heart,
and soul,

916
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,669
this is gonna be awesome.

917
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:35,472
We're gonna go
to any length.

918
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:40,109
? then don't take your lips?

919
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,580
? or your arms?

920
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,783
? or your love?

921
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:52,789
? away?

922
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:05,201
It had been a long time

923
00:50:05,201 --> 00:50:07,604
since I’d felt
this close to Marc.

924
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:09,205
We'd gotten a fresh start,

925
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:11,207
and it seemed like
our new identities

926
00:50:11,207 --> 00:50:12,408
might finally mesh.

927
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,614
Marc seemed to forget
about Croatia

928
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:20,016
and Orson Welles
pretty quickly.

929
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:22,418
I guess
it was too much to take in.

930
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:25,221
But the experience
really lived with me.

931
00:50:25,221 --> 00:50:27,223
The whole photo thing
made me realize

932
00:50:27,223 --> 00:50:29,225
I had to make peace
with my past.

933
00:50:31,227 --> 00:50:32,829
And I was hoping
that might also mean

934
00:50:33,229 --> 00:50:35,632
making peace with Marc.

935
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:38,434
He had told me
I couldn't just erase Paul.

936
00:50:38,434 --> 00:50:41,237
I decided to go back
to san Francisco,

937
00:50:41,237 --> 00:50:43,239
the last place Paul was seen.

938
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,042
I wanted to visit David
and his wife.

939
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:47,644
He was one
of my oldest friends

940
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:49,646
and my tennis partner
in high school.

941
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:52,048
David: I remember
being back in Helena

942
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:54,851
and getting a 12-pack
of Henry Weinhard's

943
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,452
and coming over
to your house.

944
00:50:56,452 --> 00:50:59,656
I thought that was the most
exotic beer I had ever seen...

945
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:02,458
oh, yeah,
it's pretty fancy stuff.
Because it was dark.

946
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:04,160
I think
I said something like,

947
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,162
"there's a big world
out there.

948
00:51:06,162 --> 00:51:07,764
You might
want to check it out."

949
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:09,532
And then when did you come
to Berkeley?

950
00:51:09,532 --> 00:51:12,335
So it was a year after that
conversation that I started.

951
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,838
So I got that apartment
as a male,

952
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,241
but when I left,
I was female.

953
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,842
I had changed my name.

954
00:51:19,842 --> 00:51:21,844
I had changed
my driver's license

955
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:25,848
and social security
and passport and everything.

956
00:51:25,848 --> 00:51:28,818
Checked in as male.
Checked out as female.

957
00:51:29,218 --> 00:51:31,921
I would segregate
all of the restaurants.

958
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:36,125
For example, I would go
to muddy waters as male,

959
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,394
but I would go to Sparky's
as female

960
00:51:38,394 --> 00:51:40,396
because I had female friends,

961
00:51:40,396 --> 00:51:43,166
and I’d been going there
for a long time.

962
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:45,168
This burrito place was male.

963
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:47,570
Another one a block away
was female.

964
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,572
It was crazy
living like that.

965
00:51:49,572 --> 00:51:52,775
Super, yeah.
With hot sauce, hot.

966
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:58,348
During this period of my life,
I was a nervous wreck.

967
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:02,285
I was going through puberty
knowing I was going through it.

968
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,486
'Cause you know how awkward

969
00:52:03,486 --> 00:52:05,088
and freaked out you are
in puberty?

970
00:52:05,488 --> 00:52:07,090
I knew I was being awkward
and freaked out,

971
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,092
but I couldn't do anything
about it.

972
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:10,693
So everything I did
was overcompensating

973
00:52:10,693 --> 00:52:12,528
for everything else.

974
00:52:12,528 --> 00:52:16,132
I was about here,
and I’m walking down the street.

975
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:18,534
And I see the two of you

976
00:52:18,534 --> 00:52:20,937
walk out of the Thai house
on the corner.

977
00:52:21,337 --> 00:52:23,740
And you say... with your
lovely southern accent,

978
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,742
you say, "it's cold!"

979
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,510
(laughter)

980
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,679
And I hear, "it's Paul!"

981
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:32,048
And I saw you look at me,
and I’m like,

982
00:52:32,448 --> 00:52:36,319
I... maybe he saw me,
maybe he didn't.

983
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,721
Kind of made eye contact.

984
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:41,924
And you did this major duck
behind the trees.

985
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,327
Did I duck?
It was like...

986
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:47,930
it was like a dive,
duck, dive, and run.

987
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:50,466
And getting about here,
kind of recognizing.

988
00:52:50,466 --> 00:52:53,269
(laughter)

989
00:52:53,269 --> 00:52:54,804
I wouldn't have been
that sure

990
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:58,007
if you hadn't really,
really run away.
Bolted?

991
00:52:58,007 --> 00:53:00,643
(laughter)

992
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:02,612
But when I went
to your wedding?
Yeah.

993
00:53:03,012 --> 00:53:05,014
I felt like I was in drag,
the entire time.

994
00:53:05,014 --> 00:53:07,417
Oh, yeah.
I did.

995
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:11,421
'Cause you were dressed
as a groomsman?
Yes.

996
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,589
(laughter)

997
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:18,795
My decade in san Francisco
had set me free.

998
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:21,597
I had a new body
and a new identity.

999
00:53:21,597 --> 00:53:23,599
I'd even gotten rid
of my old last name

1000
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,601
because I wanted
to start over.

1001
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:29,205
I didn't realize
I had abandoned Marc.

1002
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:32,008
(beep)
Kim: Hey, Marc, how you doing?

1003
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:35,211
Hey, remember that cabin that
mom and I were interested in?

1004
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:38,414
Well, we just found out
that it's ours if we want it.

1005
00:53:38,414 --> 00:53:39,615
And I really want it.

1006
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:41,617
So, you know,
I’m wondering if...

1007
00:53:41,617 --> 00:53:43,219
if maybe I could come
to Spokane.

1008
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:46,022
I'd love to see you
and Debbie and Kelsey and...

1009
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:48,424
I’d never been
to Marc's home before.

1010
00:53:48,424 --> 00:53:51,227
Now seemed like a good time
to take that step.

1011
00:53:51,627 --> 00:53:53,129
I wanted to see him,

1012
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:55,932
and I was gonna drive
dad's truck back to Montana.

1013
00:54:01,537 --> 00:54:03,940
Kim: So this is your...
where you hang out, huh?

1014
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,942
Uh, yeah.

1015
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:07,543
Well, for now.

1016
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:10,880
It's not on...
that's not a regular...

1017
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,685
what's the other thing
up there?

1018
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:20,356
That's your
Helena Bengal shorts.

1019
00:54:20,356 --> 00:54:25,161
You might have worn 'em
when you were in basketball,

1020
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:27,163
or, uh...

1021
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,769
probably?

1022
00:54:39,575 --> 00:54:41,177
Yeah.

1023
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,815
That's a good family picture
in that old wooden boat

1024
00:54:46,215 --> 00:54:49,819
that would have been
awesome to have.

1025
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:54,624
And there's a good
picture there.

1026
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,827
That would have been
my official senior picture

1027
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:59,428
at graduation.

1028
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:10,206
That's Todd and me.

1029
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:12,809
And that's the farm
dad grew up on.

1030
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,211
That's you and Todd

1031
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:17,213
I think
you were sitting next to.

1032
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:20,149
I've always wanted
a family.

1033
00:55:20,149 --> 00:55:23,352
I've always wanted
that life.

1034
00:55:23,352 --> 00:55:26,155
I love kids.
I love the family.

1035
00:55:26,155 --> 00:55:28,958
I just, um...

1036
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,260
it makes me happy to see
where they're at

1037
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,663
and what they're doing
because I see it within myself

1038
00:55:34,063 --> 00:55:36,065
and what I could have been.

1039
00:55:45,174 --> 00:55:47,176
Smile really big.

1040
00:55:47,176 --> 00:55:48,678
Scoot in.
Scoot your head in.

1041
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,680
Male voice:
Four, three, two...

1042
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,281
smile!

1043
00:55:52,281 --> 00:55:55,084
(both laugh)

1044
00:55:55,084 --> 00:55:57,086
All right.
What should we do?

1045
00:55:57,086 --> 00:55:58,688
This'll be really goofy
this time.
A funny one.

1046
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,090
This'll be really goofy.

1047
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:02,692
Five, four...

1048
00:56:03,092 --> 00:56:04,694
Kim:
It had been a nice visit.

1049
00:56:05,094 --> 00:56:06,162
(laughs)

1050
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:09,365
I was surprised
at how sentimental Marc was,

1051
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:11,367
and I was really touched.

1052
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:16,906
(telephone rings)

1053
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:18,908
I was going to leave early
the next morning,

1054
00:56:19,308 --> 00:56:22,111
but Marc wanted to fix
the gas gauge on dad's truck,

1055
00:56:22,111 --> 00:56:23,713
even though it had been
broken for years.

1056
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:26,515
Hello, McKerrows.
Yes.

1057
00:56:26,515 --> 00:56:28,818
Well, the gauge
is only telling me

1058
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:30,019
it's a fourth of a tank

1059
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,755
when I just filled it up
last night.

1060
00:56:32,755 --> 00:56:35,157
And how long
would that take?

1061
00:56:35,157 --> 00:56:36,759
Marc, what's going on?

1062
00:56:36,759 --> 00:56:39,962
I gotta make sure
it works with my schedule.

1063
00:56:39,962 --> 00:56:41,564
Okay, all right.

1064
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,765
(telephone beeps)

1065
00:56:42,765 --> 00:56:46,202
What are they saying?

1066
00:56:46,602 --> 00:56:51,007
Would you shut the fuck up,
and take my fucking car?
Marc...

1067
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:52,208
mom's car.

1068
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,409
Get it the f...

1069
00:56:53,809 --> 00:56:55,811
get the fuck outta here
and take that car.

1070
00:56:55,811 --> 00:56:59,815
Marc...
take the car and get
the fuck outta here!

1071
00:56:59,815 --> 00:57:05,021
'Cause I’m gonna get this truck
fixed up no matter what.

1072
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:06,622
Take the car!

1073
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:09,025
So you can get outta here
at 5:00 in the morning!

1074
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:11,427
Take the fucking car!

1075
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:13,429
You understand me?!

1076
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:15,264
Marc,
I want to take the truck.

1077
00:57:15,264 --> 00:57:16,465
Fuck you.
You don't need the truck.

1078
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:18,467
Do you know why
I need the truck?
No, you don't.

1079
00:57:18,467 --> 00:57:20,870
I need the truck
because of the cabin.

1080
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,471
And there's
a ton of furniture...

1081
00:57:22,471 --> 00:57:24,874
but there is nothing...
bullshit.

1082
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:28,811
Do you want to come
with us, Kim?
Yeah, I do.

1083
00:57:28,811 --> 00:57:30,713
Stop it, Marc!

1084
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:31,914
(thudding)

1085
00:57:31,914 --> 00:57:33,916
Stop it!

1086
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:35,518
(crashing,
telephone beeping)

1087
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:36,953
Marc, please stop.

1088
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,355
Just... please.
Just don't.

1089
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:40,957
Marc! I swear to god,

1090
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,959
I’ll call the cops
if you don't stop it.

1091
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,560
Fuckin' pussy.

1092
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,562
Please, just don't.
Marc!

1093
00:57:46,562 --> 00:57:47,763
Stop hitting her!

1094
00:57:47,763 --> 00:57:49,765
Just please, don't.

1095
00:57:49,765 --> 00:57:50,967
Please, hey...

1096
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,969
(grunts)
Aah!

1097
00:57:55,771 --> 00:57:57,773
(groaning)

1098
00:57:57,773 --> 00:58:01,677
(off-the-hook signal
beeping)

1099
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:44,920
When you're a quarterback,

1100
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,124
you learn that just after
you throw a pass,

1101
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:50,526
you have to go limp

1102
00:58:50,526 --> 00:58:52,528
because
you're about to get hit.

1103
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:57,733
I drove all night

1104
00:58:57,733 --> 00:59:01,337
thinking about how Marc and I
had been getting so close.

1105
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:05,041
But I felt like I’d lost
my brother all over again.

1106
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:10,012
Since Croatia,
I’d tried and tried,

1107
00:59:10,012 --> 00:59:12,815
but now I was gonna be like
almost everyone else

1108
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:14,417
and disengage.

1109
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:19,922
Part of me wanted to get

1110
00:59:19,922 --> 00:59:21,857
the first flight back
to new York,

1111
00:59:21,857 --> 00:59:23,859
but we had
a family Christmas planned,

1112
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,630
and I was determined to spend
the holidays in Montana.

1113
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:32,435
I arrived in Helena
at dawn.

1114
00:59:43,712 --> 00:59:45,314
(Marc over telephone)

1115
01:00:39,568 --> 01:00:41,804
Carol:
Okay, sweet sweetie.

1116
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:46,208
Kim: Mom, who is this woman
decorating your tree?

1117
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:49,011
This is my sweet sister.

1118
01:00:49,011 --> 01:00:50,613
My sweet sister Jan.

1119
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:53,015
All the way from Houston.

1120
01:00:53,015 --> 01:00:56,218
(crowd talking indistinctly)

1121
01:00:59,021 --> 01:01:02,625
Hi, darling.
Welcome.

1122
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,230
Yeah.
Oh, there he is!

1123
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:09,832
Hey, Marcus!

1124
01:01:10,232 --> 01:01:11,433
(laughs)

1125
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,637
Oh...
(talking indistinctly)

1126
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:16,238
Merry Christmas!

1127
01:01:16,238 --> 01:01:19,441
He made it.

1128
01:01:19,441 --> 01:01:22,411
Hello.

1129
01:01:22,411 --> 01:01:24,547
Did you send
a pill schedule?

1130
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:30,553
All of 'em
on the right-hand side?

1131
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:31,754
Not that one.

1132
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:33,355
I don't... what's this
white one all about?

1133
01:01:33,355 --> 01:01:36,959
What's the white one,
he wants to know.

1134
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:40,963
Oh!
Are you tired, honey?

1135
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:43,199
It had been uncomfortable
around Marc,

1136
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,001
but I’d only told my mom about
what happened at his house,

1137
01:01:46,001 --> 01:01:48,804
and it seemed like things
were going smoothly.

1138
01:01:48,804 --> 01:01:50,806
Let's circle up.

1139
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:57,446
But suddenly,
Marc attacked Todd.

1140
01:01:57,446 --> 01:01:59,848
Carol: He went crazy,
and I don't know why.

1141
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:02,918
Nobody did anything
to aggravate him.

1142
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,921
I have a bad back,
and you slammed me in the back

1143
01:02:05,921 --> 01:02:07,489
without me even knowing
what the hell's going on.

1144
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:11,093
And then after that,
then you grabbed my neck.

1145
01:02:11,093 --> 01:02:12,294
Do you remember that?

1146
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:15,731
You know, there are good ways
to be the center of attention.

1147
01:02:15,731 --> 01:02:18,133
I don't give a rat's...
I was popular,

1148
01:02:18,133 --> 01:02:20,536
and I was more popular
than any of these motherfuckers.

1149
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:22,938
Okay, fine.
Way more popular.

1150
01:02:22,938 --> 01:02:24,707
Fine.
I was popular!

1151
01:02:25,107 --> 01:02:28,711
I didn't want to turn
into a woman!
Okay!

1152
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:31,513
I was popular than shit
in high school.

1153
01:02:31,513 --> 01:02:33,115
Just 'cause I wasn't
a quarterback

1154
01:02:33,515 --> 01:02:34,717
and didn't get straight as

1155
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:36,719
and wasn't the president
of the student body.

1156
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:37,920
I was more popular
than him.

1157
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,556
I was good-looking.
I had top-notch chicks.

1158
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:44,159
I did the normal fucking.
Not the pussy eating.

1159
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,962
What does that have to do
with tonight?

1160
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:50,165
You know, I...
there's a woman and a man.

1161
01:02:50,165 --> 01:02:52,968
And when you have
the good lord...
you cut it out.

1162
01:02:52,968 --> 01:02:56,572
And you read a bible...
no, you read a bible...
cut it out.

1163
01:02:56,572 --> 01:03:00,576
When you read a bible...
do you believe in the bible?

1164
01:03:03,779 --> 01:03:04,980
Do you?

1165
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:07,549
We're talking about Marc
going off.

1166
01:03:07,549 --> 01:03:09,551
Do you believe
in the bible?

1167
01:03:09,551 --> 01:03:10,753
(sighs) yes, I do.

1168
01:03:11,153 --> 01:03:13,956
Okay,
the bible will tell you,

1169
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,958
as any church will say,

1170
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:19,561
there is no such thing
as this stuff.

1171
01:03:19,561 --> 01:03:22,765
And you don't do it.
It don't go.

1172
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:25,567
Okay, well,
these people are...
and there's no such thing

1173
01:03:25,567 --> 01:03:27,970
as that stuff,
where you suck dick...
my friends and family.

1174
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:30,372
All the time
and butt fuck.

1175
01:03:30,372 --> 01:03:33,575
These people
are my friends and...
ah! Ah! Ah!

1176
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,312
Okay, you don't do this
in my house.

1177
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:39,114
I have...
people here.

1178
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:41,116
I have my sister here.

1179
01:03:41,116 --> 01:03:43,919
I have friends that have never
been in my house before.

1180
01:03:43,919 --> 01:03:45,521
I never have a family because
they are what they are.

1181
01:03:45,921 --> 01:03:49,925
I have people who have never
been in my house before.

1182
01:03:49,925 --> 01:03:52,328
Pita has never been
to my home,

1183
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,330
and look what sh...
Iook what's happening.

1184
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,332
(dog barks)

1185
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,399
Who called?

1186
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:58,600
Kim: I did.

1187
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,202
You did. Okay.

1188
01:04:00,202 --> 01:04:03,005
And everybody was here when
whatever happened happened?

1189
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:05,407
Yeah.
It was a little, uh...

1190
01:04:05,407 --> 01:04:09,011
it was... i-i...
I have a head injury.

1191
01:04:09,411 --> 01:04:10,212
Okay.

1192
01:04:10,212 --> 01:04:11,814
And I take
a lot of medication,

1193
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:14,616
and I’m short on taking
some meds right now.
Okay.

1194
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,618
Like, my wife,
I can call her

1195
01:04:16,618 --> 01:04:19,221
and have her talk to you
about it, 'cause she knows.

1196
01:04:19,221 --> 01:04:21,223
What I’m concerned about
is what happened tonight.

1197
01:04:21,623 --> 01:04:23,625
So what I’m gonna do
is ask you to be quiet.

1198
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:25,627
I'm gonna talk
to the person that called,

1199
01:04:25,627 --> 01:04:28,030
and then I’ll come in
and talk to you guys, okay?

1200
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,032
So can I talk to you
outside?

1201
01:04:34,436 --> 01:04:37,239
This is what happens, Marc,
when you ruin people's...

1202
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:39,641
you want me to get busted?

1203
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,444
Marc...
Marc, nobody wants that.
Nobody wants that.

1204
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:44,847
What the fuck do you think
she's gonna do?

1205
01:04:45,247 --> 01:04:48,450
Don't you dare call Debbie
and ruin her evening.

1206
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:50,052
Marc,
what are you looking for?

1207
01:04:50,452 --> 01:04:51,653
(metal clangs)

1208
01:04:51,653 --> 01:04:54,456
Come on. Everybody
out of the house now.

1209
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:56,859
Everybody
get out of the house.

1210
01:04:57,259 --> 01:04:58,460
What's going on?
What's going on?

1211
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:03,966
You did the right thing.

1212
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:07,035
Todd: Well,
I said to call 911.

1213
01:05:07,035 --> 01:05:09,438
Did you see him
just grabbing a knife right now?
Yeah.

1214
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:15,444
Go ahead.
(on radio)
We get all his meds?

1215
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:17,446
They're on the way.
10-4.

1216
01:05:17,846 --> 01:05:21,049
Okay.
Can I ask you,
where is Marc now?

1217
01:05:21,049 --> 01:05:22,651
He's at the jail.

1218
01:05:23,051 --> 01:05:26,255
When we come to a call where
family members are involved,

1219
01:05:26,655 --> 01:05:29,057
it has nothing to do
with the family members.

1220
01:05:29,057 --> 01:05:31,059
It has to do
with the state.

1221
01:05:31,059 --> 01:05:34,263
I felt that you guys
had enough fear

1222
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,532
that he violated
Montana law, so...

1223
01:05:36,932 --> 01:05:41,570
is there any way
that he could be taken

1224
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:44,173
to warm springs
for an evaluation?

1225
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:46,175
This has happened
in the past with...

1226
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:48,577
with people
I’ve been involved with.

1227
01:05:48,977 --> 01:05:51,380
There's nurses and doctors
at the jail.

1228
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:53,649
(clears throat)

1229
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:01,590
This is what needs
to happen.
Okay.

1230
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:03,592
I have a friend
who is a therapist,

1231
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:07,196
and she said, "Carol,
if that happens,

1232
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:10,399
that would be the very
best thing in the long run,

1233
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:16,004
because maybe then
he would be admitted...

1234
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:19,408
and get some evaluation."

1235
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:22,845
And it scared me to death
when she said that,

1236
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:28,450
but now I realize that
that's what...

1237
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:30,052
needs to be done.

1238
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:32,054
That's what he needs.

1239
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:41,263
(clucking)

1240
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:49,905
The next day,
Christmas day,

1241
01:06:49,905 --> 01:06:53,242
we all tried
to soldier on as usual,

1242
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:55,644
but it wasn't
going to happen.

1243
01:06:55,644 --> 01:07:00,449
Even when Marc wasn't there,
he was the center of attention.

1244
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:08,824
The important thing
is that this is a milestone.

1245
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:13,362
I mean, with all this,
and with Kim, it's...

1246
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:16,565
things are going to be
different from now on.

1247
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:23,338
Todd: I was looking
at this wilderness

1248
01:07:23,338 --> 01:07:26,542
and fresh air and snow,
and it was just beautiful.

1249
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:30,812
And... I just kept thinking
about my dad.

1250
01:07:36,418 --> 01:07:40,422
(voice breaking)
And how beautiful it is,

1251
01:07:40,422 --> 01:07:47,229
and how... how he would just love
to go there for the weekend.

1252
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:48,830
And then...

1253
01:07:50,832 --> 01:07:53,635
I guess it just went
from that to, like,

1254
01:07:53,635 --> 01:07:57,639
the scenes of what happened
the night before.

1255
01:07:57,639 --> 01:07:59,641
And it just, you know...
it just hit me.

1256
01:07:59,641 --> 01:08:02,044
You know, the violence.

1257
01:08:02,444 --> 01:08:04,446
Where I usually just,
like, shake it off,

1258
01:08:04,446 --> 01:08:06,048
and say,
"oh, he'll change.

1259
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:08,050
That's just Marc.
Blah, blah, blah."

1260
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:10,852
And he actually had me
in a choke hold.

1261
01:08:10,852 --> 01:08:15,657
And it's, like,
I have bruises on my neck.

1262
01:08:15,657 --> 01:08:18,860
It's just... scary.

1263
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:20,462
Scared the shit out of me.

1264
01:08:20,462 --> 01:08:22,864
But then, you know, it's like,
I was scared growing up.

1265
01:08:22,864 --> 01:08:24,866
I was scared...

1266
01:08:24,866 --> 01:08:28,070
like, how long
does this have to go on?

1267
01:08:36,478 --> 01:08:39,281
They'd only release Marc
into a treatment program.

1268
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:41,283
So for the week
after Christmas,

1269
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:43,685
mom and I called every facility
in the northwest

1270
01:08:43,685 --> 01:08:44,886
to find him a spot.

1271
01:08:46,888 --> 01:08:49,691
But it was taking awhile.

1272
01:08:53,695 --> 01:08:55,697
I postponed my return home

1273
01:08:55,697 --> 01:08:57,699
until we settled things
with Marc.

1274
01:08:57,699 --> 01:09:02,104
Mom and Debbie couldn't face
visiting him in a cell,

1275
01:09:02,504 --> 01:09:05,307
so it was up to me to show Marc
we all still cared.

1276
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:10,512
(door clangs shut)

1277
01:09:10,512 --> 01:09:12,514
(knock on glass)

1278
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,527
(knock on glass)

1279
01:10:07,335 --> 01:10:09,738
(door clangs shut)

1280
01:10:16,945 --> 01:10:18,947
(telephone rustling)

1281
01:10:28,156 --> 01:10:30,158
Kim: Hey, mom, okay.

1282
01:10:30,158 --> 01:10:32,160
After two weeks of nothing
at all but dead ends,

1283
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:34,963
it looks like everything's
gonna happen all at once,

1284
01:10:34,963 --> 01:10:36,565
as usual.

1285
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:40,168
Marc has decided that he's gonna
voluntarily commit himself,

1286
01:10:40,168 --> 01:10:42,337
but we have to leave
this afternoon.

1287
01:10:42,337 --> 01:10:45,941
Father Moran has agreed
to drive us, so, I don't know.

1288
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:47,542
Just give me a call.
Bye.

1289
01:10:56,718 --> 01:10:57,919
Okay.

1290
01:10:57,919 --> 01:10:59,521
Well, good luck to you,
Mr. McKerrow.

1291
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:02,324
Take care, bud.
Have a good evening.

1292
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:07,763
Is it okay if I film...
oh, I’m...

1293
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:10,565
you're doing a good thing
for the future, Kim.

1294
01:11:10,565 --> 01:11:13,568
If you haven't noticed
that I don't respect you

1295
01:11:13,568 --> 01:11:15,971
for who you are...
oh, I do, I do.

1296
01:11:16,371 --> 01:11:19,174
I just have a hard time
that ki...

1297
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:22,778
that Todd and mom
won't even say hello to me.

1298
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:23,979
Yeah, well...

1299
01:11:24,379 --> 01:11:25,981
what does mom say,
by the way?

1300
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:28,383
Can't I even talk to her
on the phone?

1301
01:11:28,383 --> 01:11:29,985
You know what it is,
Marc, is...

1302
01:11:30,385 --> 01:11:31,987
she won't even let me
talk to her on the phone

1303
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:33,989
because she thinks
I’m that bad?

1304
01:11:34,389 --> 01:11:37,592
She wants to make
the statement...

1305
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:39,995
not even talk to me?
No, she says...

1306
01:11:40,395 --> 01:11:41,596
on the phone even?

1307
01:11:41,596 --> 01:11:44,399
That she will talk to you
when you're in treatment.

1308
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:47,202
And that's the same thing
that Debbie is saying.

1309
01:11:47,602 --> 01:11:51,373
You know
what that was for?

1310
01:11:51,773 --> 01:11:52,574
Yeah.

1311
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:58,180
Myself.

1312
01:12:00,982 --> 01:12:02,984
Everybody... what,
everybody was thinking

1313
01:12:02,984 --> 01:12:05,787
I was gonna come
after them?

1314
01:12:08,723 --> 01:12:10,325
You know who wouldn't
be scared of me

1315
01:12:10,725 --> 01:12:13,528
is the person I love the most,
and the only person...

1316
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:16,331
I could almost say
the only person I love...

1317
01:12:16,731 --> 01:12:20,702
that man that adopted me
that is dead that was a doctor.

1318
01:12:20,702 --> 01:12:23,104
You know what?
He wouldn't be scared of me.

1319
01:12:23,104 --> 01:12:26,708
That doctor, Loren e. McKerrow,
would be hugging me tight,

1320
01:12:26,708 --> 01:12:29,110
and take me home.

1321
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:32,314
I'll put thousands
of bucks on that.

1322
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:34,316
'Cause he's a doctor,
and he knows it

1323
01:12:34,316 --> 01:12:37,118
and understands it
and would be with me right now,

1324
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:40,722
and he's the only McKerrow
that I would love.

1325
01:12:40,722 --> 01:12:42,324
I'm sorry to say that,

1326
01:12:42,724 --> 01:12:45,126
but that man
would love me intensely

1327
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:47,128
and would not leave me
in jail.

1328
01:12:47,128 --> 01:12:51,533
You know, if I had been there
at that time

1329
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:54,336
and you had done
the things you did with Todd,

1330
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:55,937
and you pulled a knife,

1331
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:58,340
you know what I probably
would have done?

1332
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:00,342
I probably
would have decked ya.

1333
01:13:00,742 --> 01:13:03,144
Would have what?
I would have hit you.

1334
01:13:03,144 --> 01:13:05,347
Yeah.
To try to disarm you

1335
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:08,383
to... to get control
of the situation.

1336
01:13:08,783 --> 01:13:10,785
So when they called 911,

1337
01:13:10,785 --> 01:13:14,789
they didn't call because
they wanted to punish you.

1338
01:13:14,789 --> 01:13:16,791
They called because
they were frightened

1339
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:19,594
and didn't know
what to do.

1340
01:13:28,403 --> 01:13:31,606
Carol:
Uh, Marc?

1341
01:13:31,606 --> 01:13:33,608
Okay, Marc, I’m not...

1342
01:13:33,608 --> 01:13:36,811
I can't talk with you
any longer.

1343
01:13:36,811 --> 01:13:39,614
Marc, I cannot...

1344
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:43,618
you're tearing me apart
by telling me

1345
01:13:43,618 --> 01:13:47,989
that we put you there
and that we don't care.

1346
01:13:47,989 --> 01:13:52,527
Kim has talked with with
the social worker twice now.

1347
01:13:52,527 --> 01:13:55,330
Yeah,
I know it's weirding you out.

1348
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:58,133
And it's weirding them out

1349
01:13:58,133 --> 01:14:00,535
for you not to be taking meds
in the evening.

1350
01:14:00,535 --> 01:14:02,938
So you try a little bit.

1351
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:08,543
Because your mind
is playing tricks on you.

1352
01:14:08,543 --> 01:14:10,946
(sighing) oh...

1353
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:13,748
we'll talk with you
tonight.

1354
01:14:13,748 --> 01:14:18,153
You take the meds.
You eat a little bit today.

1355
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:19,354
Okay?

1356
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:22,691
I'm gonna say goodbye now,
Marc.

1357
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:24,693
Goodbye for now, Marc.

1358
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,630
Goodbye.

1359
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,632
Goodbye.

1360
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:36,237
Oh, my lord.

1361
01:14:36,237 --> 01:14:37,839
(sighs)

1362
01:14:45,013 --> 01:14:48,616
Hi,
I was calling to inquire

1363
01:14:48,616 --> 01:14:52,220
about the Nami
education course.

1364
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:55,023
My name is Carol.

1365
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:58,226
(telephone beeps)

1366
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:07,435
Marc had been in the hospital
for a week,

1367
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:09,437
and I went to visit him.

1368
01:15:11,239 --> 01:15:16,044
It's weird visiting your
brother in a mental hospital.

1369
01:15:16,044 --> 01:15:18,446
And being transgender,
technically,

1370
01:15:18,446 --> 01:15:21,516
I was more mentally ill
than he was.

1371
01:15:21,516 --> 01:15:23,918
Marc didn't have
a diagnosis yet,

1372
01:15:23,918 --> 01:15:26,721
but officially, I did.

1373
01:15:26,721 --> 01:15:29,124
I'd experienced
so much frustration

1374
01:15:29,524 --> 01:15:31,526
with the body
I was born into,

1375
01:15:31,526 --> 01:15:34,996
but I always knew
I could rely on my mind.

1376
01:15:35,397 --> 01:15:37,799
Now Marc was losing his.

1377
01:15:41,002 --> 01:15:44,606
Do you want to see
what we brought?

1378
01:15:44,606 --> 01:15:46,608
What's wrong?

1379
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:55,817
This has, um...
socks.

1380
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:59,020
You mentioned you wanted
some socks.

1381
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:02,624
And this has
a bunch of clothes.

1382
01:16:03,024 --> 01:16:05,026
I put some CDs in here,
Marc.

1383
01:16:07,028 --> 01:16:09,831
I found all your CDs.

1384
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:12,233
Why didn't you just
bring a gun and kill me?

1385
01:16:12,233 --> 01:16:14,235
Huh?
I know you want me dead.

1386
01:16:14,235 --> 01:16:15,437
No, Marc.

1387
01:16:15,437 --> 01:16:17,038
They are coming in here

1388
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:21,042
'cause they think
you're scared...
no, they don't.

1389
01:16:21,042 --> 01:16:22,644
Because of me.
That's not
why they came in.

1390
01:16:22,644 --> 01:16:24,646
Yes, it is, Kim.
Don't lie.

1391
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:26,648
That's not
why they came in.
Kim, please.

1392
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:28,650
Kim, yes, it is.

1393
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:32,253
Kim, please,
please, don't.

1394
01:16:32,253 --> 01:16:34,255
Don't even give me
this shit.

1395
01:16:34,255 --> 01:16:36,257
I know what it is,
and I’m gonna be dead,

1396
01:16:36,257 --> 01:16:38,259
and you're not admitting it.

1397
01:16:38,259 --> 01:16:39,861
Marc...
Kim...

1398
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:42,664
they're gonna help you.
Kim.

1399
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:48,703
Let me show you the cake.

1400
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:50,705
(bag rustling)

1401
01:16:50,705 --> 01:16:55,110
See?
Mom got this for you.

1402
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:57,512
See?
Look at you.

1403
01:16:57,512 --> 01:16:58,713
Huh?

1404
01:16:58,713 --> 01:17:01,516
There you are again.
What?

1405
01:17:01,916 --> 01:17:04,319
You're scared to death
right now.

1406
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:06,321
What are you talking
about?

1407
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:08,723
I'm moving this stuff
out of the way

1408
01:17:08,723 --> 01:17:11,126
so I can show you the cake.

1409
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:14,229
It's right here.

1410
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:19,634
This is a carrot cake
with buttermilk frosting

1411
01:17:20,034 --> 01:17:23,238
mom said you liked,
so she got that for you.

1412
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,242
Want a piece?

1413
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:35,250
I want one.
Oh...

1414
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:37,252
can I have a piece?
Bury me first.

1415
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:38,853
Oh, Marc.

1416
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:40,855
It's your birthday,
come on.

1417
01:17:40,855 --> 01:17:44,459
So I can be buried
on my birthday.

1418
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:59,274
Marc was going to be released
after a month in the hospital.

1419
01:17:59,674 --> 01:18:01,676
So I arranged to work
from Montana

1420
01:18:01,676 --> 01:18:04,479
and extended my stay again
to see him when he got out.

1421
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:08,483
Debbie had asked Marc to live
independently for a month

1422
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:10,885
to show he could take his meds
and be stable.

1423
01:18:12,887 --> 01:18:16,090
My parents used to visit me
in new York and san Francisco,

1424
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:19,294
but when I came to Montana,
we would meet in other cities,

1425
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:22,096
where nobody
could recognize me.

1426
01:18:22,096 --> 01:18:25,300
When I left home,
I never thought I’d return,

1427
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:28,102
or if I did,
I’d never go out in public.

1428
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:31,706
But suddenly I found myself
surrounded by the community

1429
01:18:31,706 --> 01:18:33,975
I’d never dreamed
I’d come back to.

1430
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:37,011
Do you have a white?
Yeah.

1431
01:18:37,011 --> 01:18:39,013
Can I have two glasses?
Sure, okay.

1432
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:41,015
You want me to help
hold something?

1433
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:43,017
Hold onto that for a minute.
(laughs)

1434
01:18:43,017 --> 01:18:46,621
Because of Marc's treatment,
I’d spent two months in Helena,

1435
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:48,623
my hometown, once again.

1436
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:49,824
(cheers and applause)

1437
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:52,627
Man over pa: John Steinbeck
celebrated our city

1438
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:54,629
in "travels with Charlie."

1439
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:56,030
"Dear mother,"
wrote Steinbeck,

1440
01:18:56,431 --> 01:19:00,034
"I think I may have found
my place in the world.

1441
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:03,638
"Helena is a city
turned modern overnight.

1442
01:19:04,038 --> 01:19:07,242
"It's bursting with energy,
and the vitality of our time.

1443
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:10,044
I feel so alive
here in Helena."

1444
01:19:10,445 --> 01:19:13,648
(cheers and applause)

1445
01:19:13,648 --> 01:19:15,650
(slow piano music)

1446
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:17,945
I'm very proud of you.

1447
01:20:17,945 --> 01:20:19,547
Keep it up.
Keep it up.

1448
01:20:19,947 --> 01:20:21,149
You're doing great.

1449
01:20:21,549 --> 01:20:23,151
All right.
I'm gonna say goodbye.

1450
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:25,153
I love you.
And I love you.

1451
01:20:25,553 --> 01:20:26,754
We're really proud
of you, Marc.

1452
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:29,157
I'm really,
really proud of you.

1453
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:54,649
(piano music fades)

1454
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:37,425
Marc made it
through his month alone,

1455
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:41,028
and soon he was back
with Debbie and Kelsie.

1456
01:21:41,028 --> 01:21:43,831
I'd like to say everything
was fine after that.

1457
01:21:43,831 --> 01:21:47,034
But it wasn't long before he
was back in the hospital again.

1458
01:21:49,036 --> 01:21:51,839
The most precise diagnosis
he's gotten

1459
01:21:51,839 --> 01:21:55,042
is "personality change
due to head injury."

1460
01:21:57,445 --> 01:22:00,248
It had been almost a year
since our reunion.

1461
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:03,851
That first day,
back in the Helena airport,

1462
01:22:03,851 --> 01:22:06,654
I was hoping we'd be able
to start over.

1463
01:22:09,457 --> 01:22:11,859
I spent way too long trying
to make Marc change,

1464
01:22:11,859 --> 01:22:16,264
but really loving Marc meant
letting him hold onto his past.

1465
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:19,467
I thought I’d changed enough
for one lifetime,

1466
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:21,469
but being with Marc
made me realize

1467
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:24,272
I was only halfway there.

1468
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:27,875
We had gotten a chance
to reinvent our relationship,

1469
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:29,877
but in the end,
it didn't really have

1470
01:22:29,877 --> 01:22:32,680
anything to do with my gender
or his genes.

1471
01:22:35,883 --> 01:22:39,086
I'd become someone new.

1472
01:22:39,086 --> 01:22:41,489
I encouraged Marc
to become a Welles,

1473
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:43,491
but he just wanted
to be a McKerrow,

1474
01:22:43,891 --> 01:22:45,893
the name I left behind.

1475
01:22:45,893 --> 01:22:49,096
Actually, lately,
I’ve been thinking

1476
01:22:49,096 --> 01:22:51,499
about taking that name
back again.

1477
01:22:58,105 --> 01:23:01,709
For Marc's next birthday,
I found the perfect gift...

1478
01:23:02,109 --> 01:23:03,711
a digital photo frame.

1479
01:23:05,713 --> 01:23:07,715
I loaded it up
with the pictures

1480
01:23:07,715 --> 01:23:08,916
I knew he'd want to see.

1481
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:11,319
(slow violin music plays)

1482
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:20,528
Welles: I know
what it is to be young.

1483
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:28,135
But you, you don't know
what it is to be old.

1484
01:23:32,139 --> 01:23:37,745
Someday, you'll be saying
the same thing.

1485
01:23:42,149 --> 01:23:47,355
Time takes away,
so the story is told.

1486
01:23:50,391 --> 01:23:53,594
I've asked
so many questions

1487
01:23:53,594 --> 01:23:55,596
of the wise men I’ve met.

1488
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,003
Couldn't find
all the answers.

1489
01:24:04,405 --> 01:24:06,707
No one has as yet.

1490
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:11,512
There'll be days
to remember...

1491
01:24:13,648 --> 01:24:18,052
full of laughter
and tears.

1492
01:24:18,452 --> 01:24:21,255
After summer...

1493
01:24:21,255 --> 01:24:23,057
comes winter.

1494
01:24:23,057 --> 01:24:27,061
And so go the years.

1495
01:24:27,461 --> 01:24:29,430
So, my friend...

1496
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:34,936
let's make music together.

1497
01:24:39,073 --> 01:24:41,475
I'll play the old...

1498
01:24:41,475 --> 01:24:45,012
while you sing me the new.

1499

01:24:56,023 --> 01:24:57,391
