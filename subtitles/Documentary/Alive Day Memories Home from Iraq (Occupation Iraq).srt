1
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,830
Dear Brother,

2
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,799
on July 4th, 2003...

3
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,831
... in Suleymaniye North-lraq
as l was on duty...

4
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,675
for the security of the region
with ten of my soldiers,

5
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,596
the American troops,

6
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,959
with whom we drank
tea and fought together,

7
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,274
have ambushed
our quarters

8
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,790
and pointed their
guns at us.

9
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,228
Sir, we're receiving insistent
orders not to fight.

10
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,429
Give it to me.

11
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,119
Sir, it's me.

12
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,033
We are 11 people.

13
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,398
We have a machine
gun on the roof.

14
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,918
We have the firepower
to hit half the

15
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,672
100 Americans and
60 local soldiers.

16
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,680
They aren't intended to
make a search, sir.

17
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,875
The guys we served tea
are pointing guns at us.

18
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,195
lt is not against us, but
against the Turkish nation.

19
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,199
With my 10 soldiers,

20
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,714
l'm waiting for your
orders to die, sir!

21
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,913
Sir, l said l'm waiting for
your orders to die, sir!

22
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,039
Put your gun
down soldier.

23
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,633
Sir...

24
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,239
Son, this is an order,
put your gun down!

25
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,678
Search whatever you want,
and get out of here!

26
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,149
This is the smoking room.
We smoke here.

27
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,313
What the?

28
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,790
Major, it's not safe for
our allies outside.

29
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,394
You asked for permission to
search the building only.

30
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,076
We will not go out.
Kill us if you like.

31
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,710
Don't make any mistakes
or else we'll kill you.

32
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,633
My men will take you to
headquarters for questioning.

33
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,800
You mean ''interrogation.''
About what?

34
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,800
Well, you'll see.

35
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,950
That's why it's
called questioning.

36
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,479
But while you're here why don't
you tell me where the C4 is?

37
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,472
We are soldiers.

38
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,990
We are neither detainees
nor prisoners.

39
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,760
Your men are not
wearing uniforms.

40
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,520
So it's very difficult
for us to decide

41
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,590
whether you're soldiers
or terrorists.

42
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,830
We cannot know this
without questioning you.

43
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,478
You're not
wearing a uniform.

44
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,389
You don't have a stripe.
You have no authority.

45
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,309
- You're not even a soldier!
- l used to be one.

46
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,119
Arrest them!

47
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,553
You have no
right to do this.

48
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,268
We're soldiers, don't
destroy our dignity.

49
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,798
Major, these men are soldiers
and they're very proud.

50
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,679
- Try not to let their
faces be seen. - Yes sir.

51
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,551
Turkish headquarters
have been raided.

52
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,230
- Who's done it?
- Americans.

53
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,835
Move it!

54
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,675
Move it!
Move it faster!

55
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,359
Dear Brother...

56
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,834
Everyday in lraq we
asked ourselves,

57
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,996
what are we
doing here?

58
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,678
Than we noticed
that everyone,

59
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,388
who had the power
over this region,

60
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,719
has oppressed the
people of this land.

61
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,115
Except our ancestors.

62
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,559
On that specific day,

63
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,440
we have not been able
to prove ourselves

64
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,192
worthy of our ancestors.

65
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,788
We couldn't
die for justice,

66
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,036
for our fight
against tyranny,

67
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,674
nor for our honor.

68
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,113
This is just what l
ask of you now.

69
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,679
lronic, isn' it?

70
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,436
Your brother Suleyman.

71
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,272
Long live the homeland.

72
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,072
VALLEY OF THE WOLVES
lRAQ

73
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,477
- Where are we, Abdulhey?
- We're there.

74
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,468
Where is it? l cannot
see the red carpet.

75
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,317
You'll soon see the shining
red, yellow and green.

76
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,438
Traffic lights, Memati.

77
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,231
Shaving is masculine.

78
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,828
And a beard is feminine.

79
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,029
No matter how
hard the beard is,

80
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,037
the brush takes
all hardness away.

81
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,715
First, you will nicely
soften the beard.

82
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,995
Soften it...

83
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,594
Soften it...
Soften it...

84
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,238
- Come on in Ali.
- What're you doing?

85
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,113
- Dad.
- Where's your mother? Go!

86
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,671
There's a checkpoint
ahead.

87
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,830
Are they policemen
or soldiers?

88
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,469
Police in the city,

89
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,631
soldiers in the mountain,
it's the same.

90
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,634
You remain captive
until you tame your ego.

91
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,831
Dad...

92
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,832
Leyla, my daughter...

93
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,476
Don't ever remove
this until you're free.

94
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,593
Passports!

95
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,152
You too.

96
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,870
Papers are okay,
everything's okay.

97
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,393
Are you Kurdish?

98
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,708
Yes.

99
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,911
Get off, we'll
do a search.

100
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,640
He says we should
get off, boss.

101
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,676
Let's give him
something and go.

102
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,870
We will get off then.

103
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,951
Stand next to the car.

104
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,760
Look inside
the car too.

105
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,159
l don't like
these guys.

106
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,868
Why are you
causing trouble?

107
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,876
Let them do their
job, Abdulhey!

108
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,433
What's your name?

109
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,551
lt's in the passport.

110
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,591
l'm asking you!

111
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,998
Polat Alemdar.

112
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,479
What are you
here in Erbil for?

113
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,552
Trade.

114
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,393
What trade?

115
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,512
Human trade.

116
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,078
l was told that these
things were cheap here!

117
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,071
Lie down, we'll do
a search. Lie down!

118
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,876
Lie down!
Lie down!

119
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,995
What does he
say, Abdulhey?

120
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,910
Lie down.

121
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,998
You will lie down!

122
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,950
lf you're going to do it,
do it decently.

123
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,520
l'm not lying down!

124
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,794
Yes you will!

125
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,952
Let's go.

126
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,515
From now on,
this is yours.

127
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,952
Very nice.

128
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,469
lt's from my forefathers,
very precious.

129
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,312
Since Selahuddin Eyyubi,

130
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,195
men of my ancestors gave
this dagger to their wives,

131
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,631
for them to
protect our honor.

132
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,675
My son's trust
is with me.

133
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,430
My son's trust
is with me.

134
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,440
ls this real?

135
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,880
Of course. lt's a
thousand years old.

136
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,316
Since when do men give
real gifts to women?

137
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,840
Don't be jealous, none
of you are married and

138
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,990
you all covet my
husband, don't you!

139
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,952
l got my real gift.

140
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,315
Haven't you got
anything else?

141
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,911
- Selaam Alaikum.
- Alaikum Selaam.

142
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,080
How are you groom?

143
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,593
This is a great honor,
you're welcome.

144
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,200
Come on Abu Tarik.

145
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,875
l said my son is your son,
you still call him groom!

146
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,752
l'm on the bride's
side today.

147
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,229
Your son is my son but

148
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,312
Leyla is my
beloved daughter.

149
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,119
No one has opened
fire yet, sir.

150
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,598
They will start firing
soon. You'll see.

151
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,560
Sir, we've received the lists
from Grand Harilton.

152
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,278
The vehicle is
in the hotel.

153
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,759
Let's go.

154
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,270
They are terrorists now!
Let's go!

155
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,996
Let's go!

156
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Excuse me sir, the gentlemen
are from the police station.

157
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,076
- They want to talk to you.
- l'm listening.

158
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,872
We will go
to the station.

159
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,516
Which station?

160
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,910
Don't cause us
trouble, mister.

161
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,349
Which country's station
are you inviting me to?

162
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,392
lraqi Kurdistan.

163
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,271
l don't acknowledge you.

164
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,757
Let the owner of this
place come and get me.

165
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,390
The building is surrounded.
You'll come with me.

166
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,429
Bring me the hotel's
manager. Right now!

167
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,948
Or else neither we nor
you can leave this place!

168
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,439
ls there a problem?

169
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,954
Who's organized
this gathering?

170
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,115
lt's a wedding!

171
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,911
Sorry for bothering
you, Mr...

172
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,991
...Fender. Have
a seat, please...

173
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,469
Look, Mr. Alemdar...

174
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,629
l don't know what
the problem is,

175
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,154
but certainly my hotel is
not the place to solve it.

176
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,518
Unfortunately, this
is the exact place.

177
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,551
Please sit down and
send these men away.

178
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,880
Your customers
are being disturbed.

179
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,555
Let's go.

180
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,314
No, not there
please, here.

181
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,871
Can l ask you a
technical question?

182
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,880
How many main
supporting columns

183
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,598
does this
hotel have?

184
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,353
- Excuse me?
- Let me explain.

185
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,113
Your hotel has six main
supporting columns.

186
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,034
When l blow up the
first one, we sway.

187
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,999
When l blow up the second,
the building starts to bend.

188
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,435
With the third and
the fourth one,

189
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,870
the building collapses.

190
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,840
But l also installed C-4 on
the other two columns too.

191
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,512
Formalities, you know.

192
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,592
What do you
want from me?

193
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,832
First of all, l don't want
anyone to get hurt.

194
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,600
Please evacuate
the hotel calmly.

195
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,034
Those who're responsible
will come with us.

196
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,355
l take the
responsibility here.

197
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,951
Sam Marshall
is my friend.

198
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,190
You can find
nothing here.

199
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,079
lf you must take
someone away,

200
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,674
l'll bring that person to
you with my own hands.

201
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,080
But that's after
the wedding.

202
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,959
They'll come with us.
Right now!

203
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,952
Search them all!

204
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,954
l want to see
everyone's lD!

205
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,232
Give it to me.

206
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,910
Come on, move!

207
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,075
The lD!

208
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,071
Quick, quick!

209
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,073
You!
Give your lD.

210
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,038
Let's go!

211
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,114
Please don't!
What is it you want?

212
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,069
Let's go!

213
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,200
Ali!

214
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,632
Sayid!

215
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,510
Well, the hotel's
been evacuated.

216
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,909
Now, how can we
settle things with you?

217
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,750
Are you trying
to reconcile,

218
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,190
or are you trying
to negotiate?

219
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,800
Which one
do you prefer?

220
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,554
Sam William Marshall.
l want him here.

221
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,758
Mr. Marshall has nothing
to do with our hotel.

222
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,876
lsn't he on
your payroll?

223
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,277
ls the American
capitalism

224
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,192
not the patron of
American soldiers?

225
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,118
Excuse me?

226
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,120
Call him please.

227
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,788
Hello?

228
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,478
Hold on.

229
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,318
l'm listening Fender.

230
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,318
We have a situation
here, Sam.

231
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,630
You must come
to the hotel.

232
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,955
l can't. l'm going
to a party now.

233
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,237
Sam, this is serious.

234
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,758
Hello, Sam.

235
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,192
Who is this?

236
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,600
l am the one
who will blow up

237
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,272
the Grand Harilton
into pieces.

238
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,477
lf, of course, you do not
honor us with your presence.

239
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,676
May l have the
desserts menu?

240
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,033
l've heard that American
apple pie is great.

241
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,913
Am l wrong?

242
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,758
May l have a
kunefa instead?

243
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,791
The apple pie
you said, chief,

244
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,877
is also available
at McDonald's.

245
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,073
Call the bomb squad,

246
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,276
and tell them the
situation at the hotel.

247
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,874
l want the bombers
to be identified.

248
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,911
And call the Kurdish
leader to tell him

249
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,436
we're not going to
make it tonight.

250
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,393
Wait.
Wait a second!

251
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,556
We did a hell of a
good job, lieutenant.

252
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,560
They'll be traveling
for hours.

253
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,357
They will die of
suffocation in there.

254
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,396
You are right!
Stop the car! Stop it!

255
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,677
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

256
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,718
l'm helping them breathe.

257
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,710
They're not going to die
of suffocation anymore.

258
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,512
These men could
be terrorists.

259
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,148
But don't forget that
we're soldiers.

260
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,558
Let me tell
you something!

261
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,993
Don't ever talk to
me like that again.

262
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,832
Do you understand?

263
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,991
l'll report you.
This infamy...

264
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,071
l don't care who you're
going to report me to.

265
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,549
Get out of my
sight now.

266
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,915
You're not going anywhere.
l'm arresting you.

267
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,235
Dear guests, l am sorry
to announce that

268
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,557
Mr. Marshall will
not be able

269
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,599
to attend due to
unexpected business.

270
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,798
Yes...

271
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,640
This patient is going to
be in pain for a while.

272
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,717
So if necessary,
give him morphine.

273
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,389
Okay sir.

274
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,710
Okay, good.
Good.

275
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,750
What kind of man
could do this?

276
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,911
Rebels, sir!

277
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,550
Stop lying to me,
and tell me the truth!

278
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,434
How many times
must l tell you?

279
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,755
These are human beings,
not animals!

280
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,354
l hold animals in
higher regard, sir.

281
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,399
lf you don't stop
killing my patients,

282
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,989
l cannot remove
their organs properly.

283
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,073
ln that case, believe me,
l'll kill you in your sleep!

284
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,551
l'll kill you!

285
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,633
God!

286
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,388
Take the injured to the
infirmary right away!

287
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,279
Right now!

288
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,836
Let's be a little more
patient, please...

289
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,598
He'll be here soon.

290
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,840
l am okay.

291
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,513
But what you are
doing is so wrong.

292
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,439
Abdulhey!

293
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,314
Mr. Fender says what
you're doing is very wrong.

294
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,833
Who are you?

295
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,156
- My name is Polat Alemdar.
- Are you a Turk?

296
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,435
l am.

297
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,437
What do you expect
to gain by this?

298
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,073
Mr. Fender, we
bothered you a lot.

299
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,120
You may go now.
Thank you.

300
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,033
Are you aware
that you're

301
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,236
getting yourself
into big trouble?

302
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,190
Are you aware of the trouble
you are already in?

303
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,718
What do you want?

304
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,440
Blow up the hotel,
if you like.

305
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,589
You'll get nothing
from me.

306
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,870
l don't want
anything from you.

307
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,069
But you have
something to give me.

308
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,196
l will slip this sack
on your head.

309
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,030
The same treatment
for your men, too.

310
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,631
Then all of you will leave the
hotel with your sacks on,

311
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,076
journalists will
take your pictures.

312
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,755
You can give me this
much, can't you?

313
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,156
And in return, l'll give
you the Grand Harilton.

314
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,714
Then l'll go away.

315
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,240
These sacks...

316
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,549
Are they the same ones
l put on your soldiers?

317
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,351
Put it on your
head while you,

318
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,192
still have it on
your shoulders.

319
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,229
Or else l have a body bag
that'll suit you just fine!

320
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,952
Look Turk!

321
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,240
l've been in this
region for 15 years.

322
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,600
l know Turks
very well.

323
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,880
They love praising
themselves.

324
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,633
You have your own rules,
your own red lines.

325
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,760
You have unchanging
policies for lraq.

326
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,034
You always say
that nothing

327
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,156
can be done here,
if you don't want it.

328
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,520
Let me tell
you something,

329
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,397
we've already erased
all the red lines.

330
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,280
We screwed your
policies for lraq.

331
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,440
l don't get it.

332
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,671
This doesn't bother you,
but two stupid sacks do.

333
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,440
Let me tell you what you
really felt offended for.

334
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,637
The US have been paying
you for the last 50 years.

335
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,554
We supply even the rubber
for your underpants.

336
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,270
Why can't you
produce anything?

337
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,080
You want money
and we send it.

338
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,958
ls this why you
cheat each other?

339
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,240
You wanted arms,
we sent them.

340
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,520
You wanted to fight,

341
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,800
but you started negotiating
before sending in your troops.

342
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,836
And then again you
wanted money.

343
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,040
How can you forget that
you've been begging for us

344
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,519
to save you from
the communists!

345
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,120
lt's obvious why
you're offended,

346
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,111
we don't need
you anymore.

347
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,069
l am not a political
party leader.

348
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,192
Not a diplomat,
nor a soldier.

349
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,794
l am a Turk, as you
pointed out very well.

350
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,160
l wreak havoc
upon those who put

351
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,840
a sack over a
Turk's head!

352
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,391
Now, shut up
and put this on!

353
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,637
Okay, blow it up. Blow
it up and see if l care!

354
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,995
You ruin my sacred place,
and i ruin yours!

355
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,470
You...
Wait a minute.

356
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,238
Whatever, look...

357
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,070
We all have
sensitive issues.

358
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,920
By throwing that
sack on my face,

359
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,280
you've touched a
sensitive issue of mine.

360
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,271
This was not nice.

361
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,551
l know what you're
sensitive to!

362
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,588
Bring them in!

363
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,716
You are a
despicable man.

364
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,438
No, l love children.

365
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,913
You know why?

366
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,120
Because they are
fearless. Just like me.

367
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,997
They're also not
afraid to die.

368
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,429
But when they grow up,
they become cowards,

369
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,119
just like all sinners.

370
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,800
You know, sometimes, l wonder,
what the world would be like

371
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,920
if we killed all the children
before they grew up?

372
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,114
What do you think?

373
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,316
You are already
a baby-killer!

374
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,157
How many kids did you kill
to get these 30 kids here?

375
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,350
Now you tell me that
l cannot kill them?

376
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,998
Let me tell
you something.

377
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,873
l don't kill them!
l don't abuse them!

378
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,640
lf l did that what
would be the difference

379
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,000
between you
and me?

380
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,275
Let me tell you
the difference.

381
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,194
You cannot sacrifice
eleven of your men,

382
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,272
so you sit there and watch
your country be destroyed.

383
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,392
But l sacrifice 11 thousand
of my men if necessary.

384
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,840
You cannot spare thirty kids
because you're emotional

385
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,912
but l'd kill each one of
them for their feelings.

386
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,156
l kill all who'd
destroy peace.

387
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,910
Unlike you, l am not
here by coincidence.

388
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,829
l'm on a mission from God
to establish peace.

389
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,916
He who establishes
peace is God's child.

390
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,270
l do not have
a child like you.

391
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,148
lf you'd like to push that
button, go ahead and push it.

392
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,839
l'm leaving now!

393
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,148
We shall meet again.

394
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,960
God! Are you
okay, kids?

395
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,599
Thank you, sir.

396
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,838
Yes, what's
under there?

397
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,760
We'll take the kids
out if you like, sir.

398
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,876
lt looks like it's going
to take a while.

399
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,800
Would you like to
go home, kids?

400
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,870
Thank you, sir.

401
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,594
l think they
want to stay.

402
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,398
Do me a favor and
get this table out of here!

403
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,472
What did he say, boss?

404
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,995
He said, he was the
son of God, Memati.

405
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,478
Son of a bitch.

406
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:23,796
Be brothers, you people,
this is what our God wishes.

407
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,513
Everything passes away,

408
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,633
and friends are the
last ones to leave you.

409
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,839
To humanity,
to honesty.

410
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,311
Open your heart to
humanity, to honesty.

411
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,436
Don't ever
be afraid.

412
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:49,871
Human beings are born free
with the right to live freely!

413
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,920
You're wonderful,
it was great!

414
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,715
Everybody, strip, now!

415
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,229
l'd like to see you all
naked in one minute.

416
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,351
Everyone, take
your clothes off.

417
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,988
Everyone will be
stark naked.

418
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,872
Now!

419
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,116
Welcome to hell.
You can't survive here!

420
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,309
You'll burn here
for eternity.

421
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,800
You'll only find
pain here!

422
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,120
Do you want to
ease your pain?

423
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,678
Sorry for you terrorists.

424
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,354
You ought to think about it
before you became terrorists!

425
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,198
God, don't let anything
bad happen to them.

426
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,590
Let them
arrive soon.

427
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,389
God, don't let Abdulhey
sit on the wrong chair.

428
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,673
Don't leave me alone
here in this place, God.

429
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,799
lt didn't explode, Boss?

430
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,714
lt did.

431
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,876
Abdulhey, you weren't
clumsy as l usual l hope?

432
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:02,519
l want to stay alive
and fight, my Sheikh.

433
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,509
Only the Allah wills are
important, not yours.

434
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,120
The ones who
have religious faith,

435
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,111
do not lose anything
when they die.

436
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,713
However, as long as
they are alive,

437
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,791
it remains unknown
what will happen.

438
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:23,439
The only thing you can do
now is to pray for others.

439
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,909
Those prayers will all come
back to you as Allah's mercy.

440
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,194
Leyla?

441
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,755
Allah witnessed
all that happened!

442
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,111
lf only l were
killed, too.

443
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,792
Stand up, my daughter!
Stand up!

444
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,880
You, the groveling
cannibal...

445
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,680
What are you doing?
Kissing the ground?!

446
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,440
l will show you
how to pray now!

447
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,749
Come on!
Hurry up!

448
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,118
- Where are you taking me to?
- Go! Go!

449
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:32,518
Don't you have fear of God?
Aren't you afraid?

450
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,755
Kill these
disgusting men!

451
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,753
Show them what
torture means.

452
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,915
...Allahu Aqbar!
...The God is the greatest!

453
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,110
My husband has
died for God's sake.

454
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:04,952
lf l shed even a single tear
for him let God damn me!

455
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,714
But why did they kill Ali?
Why him?

456
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,230
l swear l will walk
towards them

457
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,832
with bombs tied around me
to blast those murderers.

458
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,668
Then they will understand
how many of them...

459
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:32,958
...are worth of
one Leyla!

460
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,080
Dad, please let
me kill them all,

461
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,513
together with myself.

462
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:45,599
How can you think, l could
approve such an action?

463
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,760
How could one, who has chosen
the way of Allah, wish that?

464
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:57,993
How could one, who
comprehends lslam, desire this?

465
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,274
But, what else
can l do?

466
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,120
Leyla, choosing to be a
suicide bomber means

467
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,032
revolting against Allah's will
in two ways by a single action.

468
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,960
lt means first giving
up your hope

469
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,359
and committing suicide,

470
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,560
and then accepting the risk
of sacrificing innocent people

471
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,994
together with
your enemy.

472
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,469
Can you know
how many will die,

473
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:25,156
when you're a suicide
bomber? You can't!

474
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,149
And since it not
possible to know that,

475
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,118
killing innocent
people is like,

476
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,558
killing the
whole humanity.

477
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,520
People who instilled this idea
into the minds of Muslims,

478
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,400
and recruited them as
suicide bombers are the ones

479
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,392
who recreate Hasan Sabbah's
wickedness again.

480
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:57,116
This is a sign of domesday my
daughter and is certainly evil.

481
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,720
l see your grief.

482
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:05,033
However, l feel sorry to see
your desire to be one...

483
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,077
... of the suicide bombers who
make the world think that...

484
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,880
... Muslims
are terrorists.

485
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,634
Never forget that
Allah isn't helpless,

486
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,040
my daughter; our current
helplessness and

487
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,800
weakness is due to
our deviation from

488
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,960
The Quran and our
Prophet's way

489
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,954
and also due to our
failure to be united.

490
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,430
Each suicidal act increases
this weakness and helplessness.

491
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,792
That's why, our
enemies desire

492
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,315
the number of such
acts to increase.

493
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,279
Moreover, they may
have already organized

494
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,200
these actions
themselves already.

495
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,398
Our only hope for survival
is to commit to Allah's way.

496
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:51,394
We must to pray Allah,
in order to wite and be free.

497
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,915
- Selaam Alaikum.
- Alaikum Selaam.

498
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,156
Welcome, it's nice
to see you.

499
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,158
Hasan Agha. Here are my
comrades Polat, and Memati.

500
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,713
And this is Abdulhey.

501
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,835
Glad to meet you!

502
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,676
He worked for Turkish
Special Forces,

503
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,429
and had many assignments
out of the country.

504
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,040
On his last mission,

505
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,800
he had to have facial
plastic surgery to infiltrate

506
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,555
the Turkish Mafia,
causing it to collapse.

507
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,280
And he did it almost
single-handedly.

508
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,480
What about the others?

509
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,118
They are his team,
also Special Forces.

510
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,518
Are they on assignment
for the government?

511
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,839
No, not officially.

512
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,672
Of course it's
not, ''officially''.

513
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,751
What is wrong
with you?

514
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,435
They allocated the
mountains to the Kurds,

515
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,471
the deserts to the Arabs...

516
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,915
...and the oil
to themselves.

517
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,914
There's nowhere
left for us to go.

518
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,351
This wasn't
planned today.

519
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:51,356
He doesn't even let us see
each other independently.

520
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,471
We've got to hold our meetings
under his supervision.

521
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:58,108
- Do you have an
upcoming meeting? - Yes.

522
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,039
- Where?
- At the bazaar.

523
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,637
Have you gone
out of your mind?

524
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,076
l'm here to save
people's lives.

525
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,549
You are trying to
save the rich!

526
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,360
lf you leave me no chance l'll
report you to the authorities,

527
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,560
you know l can do it.

528
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,800
You are my friend,

529
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,560
but we should never
forget why we are here.

530
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,073
l have always
been here before,

531
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,470
risking my life
for your safety.

532
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,273
l set the Kurds, Turks and
Arabs fighting one another.

533
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,669
But you're complaining about
a cheap kidney to me.

534
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,512
Are you kidding?

535
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,195
How could you
be so selfish?

536
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,880
Could you stop putting
pressure on me?

537
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,120
Leave me in peace.

538
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,760
Do you know how l
can hardly handle it all?

539
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,389
Do you? Don't bother me
with such minor details!

540
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,518
l only want your men to
behave well to the convicts.

541
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,674
l need them. l don't ever
mind whom you kill.

542
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,518
lt doesn't interest me
how many you kill

543
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,158
or why you kill them.

544
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,120
l only ask you to order your
men not to shoot convicts

545
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,874
on the way as long as they
bring those people to me.

546
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,800
l need their
organs alive!

547
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,360
OK, l'll do it. l understand.
lt's all right.

548
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,757
You'll go out
sooner or later.

549
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,712
Haven't you
started yet?

550
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,030
How could we
before you arrive!

551
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,718
Very kind of you.

552
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,870
Have you found the
hotel bombers yet?

553
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,075
Unfortunately not, sir.

554
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,431
We're investigating the
matter to the smallest detail.

555
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,920
l don't think you get me.

556
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,708
l have a single aim which
is to hold lraqis together.

557
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,280
And then, to form a
permanent government

558
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,794
as proof of the fact that you
could all live here in peace.

559
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,720
But as long as you continue
your alliance with Turks,

560
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,075
and you with Arabs,
and you insist on

561
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,397
establishing an independent
Kurdish state,

562
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,154
peace can never be
established on this land.

563
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,468
l only object to this
polarization, gentlemen.

564
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,074
Can l have a cold
orange juice please?

565
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,594
But you don't treat
us as equals.

566
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,800
We are guilty because
we created Saddam.

567
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,711
We're all
terrorists to you.

568
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,558
Why are the people at the
wedding declared ''terrorists''?

569
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,876
Just because they fired
through the sky?

570
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,600
No! The real
reason is that

571
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,592
you keep on training
terrorists and bombers.

572
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,193
All right. Tell me about
your problems.

573
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,396
l'll try to find
the solutions.

574
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:46,000
Look! Our villages are not
being evacuated due to

575
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,673
labour as
mentioned before.

576
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,353
Villager families
are systematically

577
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,830
forced to migrate by
made-up excuses.

578
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:01,073
And not only ours,
but also Arab villages

579
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,240
are being
evacuated, too.

580
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,390
ls that true,
Abu Tarik?

581
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,397
Unfortunately, yes.

582
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,749
And there is only one
reason for that: Oil!

583
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,040
We are being forced
out of oil sites

584
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,156
in Mosul and
Kirkuk one by one.

585
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,711
Oil is the greatest
value of this land.

586
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,270
Don't we have
a right to it?

587
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:28,712
Of course you do! But, we
must ensure security first.

588
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,560
Then we will address
economic matters.

589
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,000
You can't expect me to
share this wealth among you

590
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,116
in the absence
of stability.

591
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,395
- How are you?
- Well, l'm fine.

592
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,440
Now let's move on to concrete
demands as you wish.

593
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,873
l'm listening to you.

594
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,397
Unfortunately, there are
a lot of innocent Arabs

595
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:09,200
who were arrested or taken
into police custody due to

596
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,714
alleged connections to
terrorist organizations.

597
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,680
There are many families who
lost their close relatives

598
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,120
in these custody cases.

599
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,588
l'll take care of
this personally.

600
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,800
Our demand is clear
and apparent:

601
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,560
We want the families who
were forced out of their

602
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,836
villages to come back
safe and sound.

603
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:35,630
From now on, Kurds must also
give up treating us like a minority.

604
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,513
OK. l will take care of
the migrated families.

605
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,040
lf any problems exist about
their present accommodation,

606
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,952
l'll do my best to
ensure their safe return.

607
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,270
We need more financial
support for security and

608
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,359
stability reasons, and
more educated men

609
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,351
for the development
of the region!

610
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,720
ln fact, there isn't a
single trainee in the ClA

611
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,560
who hasn't memorized the
Kurdish translation of such

612
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,471
sentences over the
last twenty years!

613
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,633
Hey, Abu Ali!
Where are you going?

614
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:03,869
To Ali.

615
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,760
l beg you for God's
sake. Don't do that!

616
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,479
Leyla, leave
this place.

617
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,750
Please stop!
For God's sake!

618
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:30,029
Gentlemen, thank
you very much.

619
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,432
The meal
was wonderful.

620
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,960
Can l speak with you for a
moment, please? Privately?

621
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,520
l'd also like to speak
to you indeed.

622
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,633
Thank goodness!

623
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,832
Let's go!

624
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:15,715
This may hurt a little. lf it
does, we can use morphine.

625
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:20,078
How dare they?
lt is pure insolence.

626
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,310
Considering the life
they have here,

627
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,514
there are people
dying to go to heaven

628
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,752
with the aim of reaching that
life of happiness beyond the veil.

629
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,360
No, l don't understand
those who

630
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,680
have a dream of
going to heaven,

631
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,796
and yet do not embrace
our Lord, Jesus Christ.

632
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,720
So, you can go to
heaven, but l can't!

633
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,312
ls that what
you mean?

634
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,839
Christ bequeathed this
world to you when he died.

635
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:53,989
We were chosen by him in
order to set up His kingdom.

636
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,918
l've no
objection to it.

637
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:02,437
But my folks are the only ones
who can bargain with God.

638
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,040
That's why they
wouldn't leave Heaven

639
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,508
to anyone else,
l suppose.

640
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,120
What do you say?

641
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,678
Morphine.

642
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,838
Sir! One of Polat's men,
disguised as a bodyguard,

643
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,911
was reported to
be at the scene.

644
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,440
Well, bring that
Turkmen leader to me.

645
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,237
Yes, sir!

646
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,632
- Anybody coming?
- No, Boss.

647
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,709
Any news from Agha?

648
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:51,960
Thankfully, he is
good, boss.

649
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,791
They took him to
hospital for examination.

650
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,110
- Who was the bomber?
- We don't know, boss.

651
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,677
Go and get
the news then.

652
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,477
This way.

653
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,110
Stop! We'll wait here.

654
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,040
Don't tell anything
l haven't told.

655
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,393
All right, Agha!

656
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:28,760
Hasan, you asked to
talk to me in private.

657
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,957
What was it about?
Were you going to say:

658
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:34,680
''Sam, a bomb is going to
go off in a few seconds,'' or

659
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:39,200
was it ''Sam, the men
that l hired from Turkey will

660
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,954
open fire on you and your
men after the bomb explodes''?

661
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,239
Which one was it?

662
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:50,120
Where have
you been?

663
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,792
The road was
not clear, boss.

664
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,360
We've got to
leave this place.

665
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,560
lt is not safe.

666
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:00,595
Agha?

667
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,191
But, you are treating
us unfairly again.

668
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,799
We were all there,
that is to say

669
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,440
we all were
in danger.

670
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,352
Hasan, l'm going to
ask you one more time.

671
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,478
Where is he?
Polat Alemdar?

672
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,110
Polat Alemdar?

673
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,636
Where is Polat Alemdar?

674
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,838
Surround the house, quick!

675
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,072
They are runnig
away, hurry!

676
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,518
Come on, to the trucks!
Quick!

677
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,560
Which direction
are we going, boss?

678
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,551
We'll see, Abdulhey.

679
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,957
Keep what's in the
briefcase ready.

680
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,752
People live in
these houses, boss.

681
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,552
l didn't mean to blow
up the houses, Erhan!

682
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,437
Chief, look!
Light...

683
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,598
Come on,
this way.

684
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,598
They're coming,
hurry up!

685
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,035
What does she
say, Abdulhey?

686
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,392
Get down!

687
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,311
We lost track of
them here, sir.

688
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:25,558
- Search every house.
- Yes, sir!

689
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,719
You too!

690
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,193
Hold on here.

691
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:58,275
Chief, this girl isn't
trying to trap us, is she?

692
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,796
Well, if it's a trap
then we will fight.

693
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:39,998
What the hell?

694
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:43,431
Go, go, go! Move on!
Quick!

695
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,077
There is only me
and my daughter.

696
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,754
What do you
want from us?

697
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,399
Aren't you ashamed
for breaking into

698
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,232
the house of a
widow like me?

699
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,840
Can l help you?

700
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,479
Are you hiding anyone
in your house?

701
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,560
There is no one except
my grandma and me.

702
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:34,959
Where is
your husband?

703
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,156
He is in Heaven.

704
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,589
Do you know what
kills the Arabian men?

705
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,793
- No. What?
- Their wives.

706
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,478
All the houses
are clear.

707
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,159
Let's go!

708
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,509
You can go to
hell for all l care.

709
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,672
They have left,
come up.

710
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,758
- What's your name?
- Does it matter?

711
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,469
l would like to know the
name of the person l owe.

712
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:28,428
You'll learn when
you return it.

713
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,438
You have saved
our lives.

714
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,189
You've welcomed
us into your home

715
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,590
and showed us
great hospitality.

716
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,117
But we've
got to leave.

717
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,196
Americans are
everywhere.

718
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,870
You have to wait
some more time.

719
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,276
lf we wait for the
Americans to leave,

720
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,436
we grow old
here, Leyla.

721
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,511
We need information
from outside

722
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,318
and move accordingly.

723
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,155
What information
do you need?

724
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,400
Let me get it!

725
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,868
No, you can't do it.

726
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:04,431
Maybe Abdulhey can,
but they will recognize him.

727
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,193
Here is the meal.

728
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,275
lf you go out
with Erhan,

729
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,510
will you be able to
walk around freely?

730
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,439
Sir...

731
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,640
Sometimes l want to
revolt against you,

732
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,074
because you don't
want me by your side.

733
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,673
Then l realize that my duties
to you are not complete yet.

734
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,840
Blessed is the man
who endures temptation,

735
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,432
or when he has
been approved,

736
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,272
he will receive
the crown of life.

737
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,040
May you glorify the
souls of heroes

738
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,474
departed and heroes
yet to come.

739
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,957
May you give us peace.
May you always guide us.

740
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:09,473
These are sacrifices
in a high calling

741
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:13,394
the defense of our Lord,
and the peace of the world.

742
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,880
l try to fulfill my
duties to you

743
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,599
with all my
might, Sir.

744
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,880
This world was created
so that l might prove

745
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,916
my devotion to you
through my deeds.

746
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,797
Before you return
to this world

747
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,120
grant me the ability to resolve
the conflict in Babylon

748
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,475
as you promised
in the Holy Bible.

749
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,840
And as the next generations
show their gratitude

750
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:37,920
to their heroes who
build the Kingdom of God,

751
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,600
what a great honour
it would be for me,

752
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,716
should they remember
me in their prayers.

753
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:46,240
When St. Petrus left
Rome, my Lord,

754
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,117
you asked him:
''Quo vadis?''...

755
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:52,193
''Where are you going?'' This
is Babylon, my homeland.

756
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,280
And you will never ask
me where l am going to.

757
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,872
l promise.

758
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,511
l will fade away here,

759
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:00,796
my blood will water
the soil of this land.

760
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,120
My blood will flow till
the promised day comes,

761
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,792
that is till
you return,

762
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,190
and that is till the
promised land is ours.

763
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:12,789
When the promised land
is ours peace will reign.

764
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:16,874
And the one who sets the
peace will be God's child!

765
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:30,189
Before you all, l would like
to share a surprise that

766
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:33,238
l am not supposed to
tell about actually.

767
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,160
We can never forget
what Mr. Marshall

768
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,196
did for this country,
and for us.

769
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:42,353
As lraqis, we have
informed Baghdad

770
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,114
of our gratitude
to Mr. Marshall.

771
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:48,200
And our honorable
president has returned

772
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,760
this gratitude
by a small gift.

773
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,592
Mr. Marshall...

774
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,400
You can call
me Sam, please.

775
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:59,872
OK. Sam! l would like you
to accept the piano,

776
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:04,120
which is a gift from Saddam's
palace and is currently on

777
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:06,920
the train coming here
as an expression

778
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,559
of the lraqi people's
gratitude to you.

779
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:15,675
Thank you! Thank
you very much.

780
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,995
l am honored,
honored very much.

781
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,948
What's that?!
Holly smoke! Look!

782
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,512
Thank you
very much.

783
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,960
Hey listen! Turkmens
are done with.

784
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,757
Now, it's the
Arabs' turn.

785
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,436
Take a photo
of us together.

786
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:23,157
Allah, we've heard your
call and obeyed it:

787
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,629
Allah is always
victorious.

788
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,200
However the
situation seems,

789
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:31,476
whoever the winner
or the loser is,

790
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,000
you are the only
victorious and

791
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,230
the only sovereign
who rules it all.

792
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:39,069
Allah, you're the
one who even let

793
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:42,118
our Prophet Mohammed
take the test of defeat.

794
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,114
You never
behave cruelly,

795
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,996
we have believed in and
affirmed your clemency.

796
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:51,435
We have
tormented ourselves

797
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,194
by not uniting
in your path

798
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:59,434
the desires of our egos,
oppressing ourselves in the end.

799
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,120
Because we behaved
cruelly to each other

800
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,429
now our enemy
is oppressing us.

801
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,035
My Allah! Give us shelter
from the oppressors

802
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,236
and from your
wrath as well.

803
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:15,600
We have been ignorent,
have become sinners,

804
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,478
then convicted, and
finally defeated.

805
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,400
We weren't awoken by
the wisdom of the Quran

806
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,520
and The Sunna
(Prophet's Way)...

807
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,751
so you've awakened us with
the assaults of our enemies.

808
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:31,355
Now, grant us the
ability and power...

809
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,915
...to repel
these assaults,

810
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,920
and confer us
conscious patience

811
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,956
and perseverance,
my Allah.

812
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:43,509
Allah! ln reverence to
our blessed Prophet

813
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,920
who brought us the
religion of peace, lslam,

814
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,160
do not let us abandon
his jurisprudence

815
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:50,196
and morals that
he remained

816
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:52,320
true with utmost
care even in times

817
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,675
when he had no
choice but to fight.

818
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,675
Tell them that
we have guests.

819
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,473
You must
not sit here.

820
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,357
lt's not safe.

821
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,114
You can be spotted.

822
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:09,149
l am stuck in here
because of Sam.

823
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:14,558
He is oppressing people
and l can't do anything!

824
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,716
Sam is doing
nothing new.

825
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:20,910
His oppression has
nothing to do with you!

826
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:27,239
Nobody could want him
killed more than me!

827
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:32,232
However, we have no choice,
but to show patience.

828
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:36,115
How did you learn
to be that patient?

829
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:43,112
The life has taught me the
unbearable part of patience;

830
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:49,749
and my Sheikh taught me
the bearable part of it.

831
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,799
Sheikh?

832
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:58,793
Abdurrahman Halis Kerkuki.
He brought me up.

833
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,954
What about
your parents?

834
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,111
l have never
seen my father.

835
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,754
And, when my
mother died,

836
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,751
l was too young
to remember anything.

837
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,271
He brought me
up just as he did

838
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:19,716
all the orphans
and the homeless.

839
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:39,353
What is your greatest
ambition in life, Leyla?

840
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,198
Before, l had
only one dream:

841
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:51,558
l used to close my
eyes, and imagined

842
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:55,235
breathing my last
breath in this land

843
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,828
while staring
at the stars.

844
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,796
That was my
only dream then.

845
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,432
Now?

846
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:09,235
Now, my only desire is
to stab this dagger...

847
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:16,237
... into that
scoundrel's heart.

848
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:22,709
Only then will l be
able to understand...

849
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:27,589
... if he's also got
a heart or not.

850
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,869
And then l can
die in peace.

851
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:40,556
lf l prevent you from
realizing this desire...

852
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,432
... will you be
angry with me?

853
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:57,159
Chief, how will we
get on a moving train?

854
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,276
When it slows down
we'll jump on, Memati.

855
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:05,550
ls there nobody in
charge of the piano?

856
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,796
lf there is, we'll
shoot him down.

857
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,678
What about the
gun's noise?

858
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,468
Then we will not shoot him,
but throw him off the train.

859
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,594
No, we can't! They
would realize it then.

860
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:24,829
- Hopefully nobody is there.
- lf God wills!

861
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,429
lt's coming.

862
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,430
Keep a protective
eye on our visitors.

863
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,228
Don't get distressed
over the high number

864
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:36,920
of requests and complaints,
,and don't get annoyed.

865
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,720
lt's neither your,
nor my home.

866
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:41,000
But belongs
to the homeless.

867
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,752
All right,
Sheikh!

868
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:51,311
Remember...

869
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:56,590
Patience doesn't mean
to bow, but to struggle!

870
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,030
l'm sick of this Sheikh.

871
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,960
The Turkmens, the Arabs they
all go to him to ask for help.

872
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:14,080
And his closest
men are Kurds!

873
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,832
Who is this Sheikh,
for God's sake?

874
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,911
He descended
from the Prophet.

875
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:20,080
All people
respect him.

876
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:21,479
l don't care about
his descendance.

877
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:24,080
lf he is trying to spoil
all that l had done here,

878
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:26,230
then he is the chief
of terrorists to me!

879
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,596
Please don't
say so, sir...

880
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:32,880
lf Abdurrahman Halis
Kerkuki weren't here,

881
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,235
who would look after the
orphans and the widows?

882
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:38,240
Who would help the
unemployed, helpless people?

883
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:41,152
Then everyone
would be terrorists.

884
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:43,560
lf he is that good,

885
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,630
then he shall be the
president of lraq!

886
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,440
l have been telling
you for years that

887
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:48,280
this man is dangerous.

888
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:50,157
But you have always
defended him!

889
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:51,560
Now tell me: Who
do you side with?

890
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:53,516
Me or him?

891
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:55,477
What do you
benefit from him?

892
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,714
l don't benefit
from anybody!

893
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:00,833
Get your men
ready, now.

894
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,600
The Sheikh will
be arrested.

895
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,238
Yes sir!

896
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:07,469
l am not going to
take part in this, sir!

897
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,831
Excuse me?
l can't hear you.

898
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,397
Speak slowly!

899
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:17,711
My father, my grandfather
and his father,

900
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:24,399
even my grandfather's
grandfather got our bread there.

901
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,514
He freed us from the
tyranny of Saddam.

902
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:31,792
l can't point
a gun at him.

903
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,798
He would
paralyze us!

904
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:35,958
Paralyze you?

905
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,157
You mean this
man is a wizard?

906
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:43,310
No, no sir. You know
nothing about him.

907
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:47,120
l've learnt enough.
Thank you.

908
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:48,917
l think this
meeting is over.

909
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:30,040
We would like
everyone to see,

910
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:32,160
what happens in the end to
the American occupiers of lraq.

911
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:36,960
Unless the Americans, Brits,
and Jews go away from lraq,

912
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,872
we'll behead them
all one by one.

913
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:45,755
Lord, please save me.
l don't want to be killed!

914
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,398
What are you
doing here?

915
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:20,989
Whom are you
imitating? Whom?

916
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,600
Are you trying to act
like the puppets

917
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,431
who work for
those oppressors?

918
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:28,000
Our Prophet never
committed such acts.

919
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,673
Then who taught
you about this?

920
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:34,077
This guy is a henchman
of those murderers,

921
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:36,116
he is a journalist.
He is not innocent!

922
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,959
What?
Are you Allah...

923
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:43,038
... to know who is
innocent and who is not?

924
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:05,954
He may be cruel could
be a liar as well.

925
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,237
lf your heads are
to be chopped off,

926
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:12,158
he might even
say that

927
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,120
''Muslims are butchering
each other'',

928
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:17,078
while taking your photographs
with a great enthusiasm.

929
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:21,872
But how can you
regard such cruel things

930
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:24,679
as suitable for
you? How?

931
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:28,992
Stand up.
Stand up!

932
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,593
Take this.

933
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:38,799
Behead him.

934
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:42,560
Chop his head off!

935
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,994
Do whatever your heart
tells you. Come on!

936
01:32:54,520 --> 01:33:00,117
l'm just a journalist.
Do you understand?

937
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,113
Thank you.

938
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:11,916
Thank you
very much.

939
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:42,075
Darling, you are
mine at last.

940
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,917
You should
be proud.

941
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:14,271
Groveling bastards!

942
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:26,118
What's that noise!
Will you stop that please?

943
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:32,751
l don't want any noise.
Thank you!

944
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:35,111
l'm trying to do
some practice.

945
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:56,589
Stop playing football,
today is our lucky day.

946
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:58,838
lt's eid!

947
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:08,720
You should
have seen it.

948
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:11,029
That murderer's house
has collapsed on him!

949
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,355
The house has
come down on him.

950
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,596
God!
Thank goodness!

951
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:18,398
What does she
say Abdulhey?

952
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,238
Sam was killed.

953
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:23,072
ls that true, chief?

954
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:33,960
You gotta leave
this place.

955
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:35,791
l'm not going
anywhere!

956
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:38,799
He is dead now.
What's he going to do?

957
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:41,349
Can his filthy soul
disturb me?

958
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:46,389
Leyla, the hardest
times are yet to come.

959
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:49,031
The superceding
officer might find out

960
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:51,435
that you have gotten
in touch with us.

961
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,280
How can he?

962
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:56,716
Leyla, somebody must have
seen you and Erhan together.

963
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:02,560
Are you still
sitting here,

964
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,993
while the kids
are chanting,

965
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,840
Turkey is proud of you
outside screaming.

966
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,796
Don't interrupt Erhan,
we are talking.

967
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:11,037
You don't even understand
what they say.

968
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,797
Will you be safe
with the Sheikh?

969
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,313
Why?

970
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,360
l'll notify
our neighbours.

971
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:29,316
They were going to
send us a food supply.

972
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:31,038
Stop, mother!

973
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:32,473
Abdulhey...

974
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:35,956
We've got to be
sure he is dead.

975
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:38,720
Disguise yourself
and go downtown.

976
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,199
And find a
vehicle for us.

977
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:13,517
Are you proud
of Turkey?

978
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:19,470
Are you proud?

979
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,000
Erhan, get the supplies
off the vehicle.

980
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,433
All right, boss!

981
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:56,078
You can have a rest.

982
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:05,630
Does your Sheikh come
for the morning prayer?

983
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:08,439
- Certainly, he does.
- Okay.

984
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,559
- l'll wash my face there.
- All right.

985
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:36,269
- Selaam Alaikum.
- Alaikum Selaam.

986
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:38,799
Where from?

987
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:42,311
- From the city.
- Mashallah.

988
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,552
Who is your family?

989
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:48,835
- l am from Turkey.
- Turkey! Mashallah!

990
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:54,276
Allahu Aqbar,
Allahu Aqbar!

991
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,113
What does the
Hodja say?

992
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:04,875
He says God is
great, Abdulhey.

993
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:06,880
And he adds that,

994
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,519
we will still have a
journey back to lstanbul!

995
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,715
My woman died, and
l get older each day.

996
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:22,560
Let's marry you off
with a Turkish bride.

997
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:25,120
Our Sheikh
wouldn't allow it.

998
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:28,678
What is your name?

999
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:31,833
Peko Hseyin.

1000
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,593
Only Allah knows, who
will live, who will die!

1001
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,198
Boss!

1002
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:06,750
Take the briefcase
and leave the car.

1003
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,200
They will not get
out of this village!

1004
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:27,680
Burn every building
to kill them.

1005
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:28,715
Yes sir!

1006
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:31,879
Run!

1007
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:47,919
Are you all OK?

1008
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,438
We are fine, chief.

1009
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:53,278
Give me a gun.

1010
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:58,388
Hold this point.
Don't let them in!

1011
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,629
Get out of
the mosque!

1012
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:34,113
Leave the buildings,
for God's sake!

1013
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:35,918
Come out!

1014
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:01,233
Turn right!

1015
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:04,918
What's that?

1016
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:46,395
- Erhan?
- Boss!

1017
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:54,391
They're killing everyone.

1018
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:00,798
He's still alive!

1019
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:03,152
Stop!

1020
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:07,072
- Erhan, go and support them.
- OK, boss.

1021
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:19,998
Here you are...

1022
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:38,753
- Are you OK?
- l'm OK. Nothing's wrong...

1023
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:43,038
That's all because
of these Kurds!

1024
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:43,870
What Kurds?

1025
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,434
- Simply Kurds!
- l am Kurdish too!

1026
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,552
You're different Abdulhey.

1027
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:50,997
lt all starts
like this!

1028
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:59,354
Patience, Dante.
Patience...

1029
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:01,911
This Turk is getting
on my nerves...

1030
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:10,629
Patience means
waiting your turn.

1031
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:14,391
They're surrounding
us, l think!

1032
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:16,272
l'm taking the back!

1033
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:17,515
Abdulhey!

1034
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:32,432
Abdulhey!

1035
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:35,679
My God!

1036
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,393
Die like a dog!

1037
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:33,555
Leyla!

1038
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,711
Allahu Aqbar!

1039
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:42,315
Leyla?

1040
01:47:57,400 --> 01:47:59,038
Does it hurt, Erhan?

1041
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:02,273
Yes it does,
but not my wound!

1042
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:06,030
We have to
find the boss!

1043
01:48:57,640 --> 01:48:59,949
You'll never win!

1044
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:05,513
Have you killed him?

1045
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:27,634
lt was nice...

1046
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:32,112
... to know you.
