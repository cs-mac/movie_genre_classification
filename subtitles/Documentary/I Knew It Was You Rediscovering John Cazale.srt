1
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:24,565
Daddy, you're sure
I've never been to Africa before?

2
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:27,276
It looks familiar.

3
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:30,822
You saw the same scenery last summer
driving to Las Vegas.

4
00:03:30,947 --> 00:03:34,159
Oh, sure. Where Daddy lost all
that money at the crap -

5
00:03:34,284 --> 00:03:37,163
- Hank!
- Table.

6
00:03:37,288 --> 00:03:40,458
Hey, look! A camel!

7
00:03:43,753 --> 00:03:47,216
Uh-huh. Course this isn't really Africa.
It's the French Morocco.

8
00:03:47,383 --> 00:03:49,218
Well, it's Northern Africa.

9
00:03:49,343 --> 00:03:51,179
Still seems like Las Vegas.

10
00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:54,850
We're just a hundred miles
north of the Sahara Desert.

11
00:03:54,975 --> 00:03:58,646
I don't know. In school they
call this the Dark Continent.

12
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,065
This is twice as bright as Indianapolis.

13
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:03,360
You just wait till we get to Marrakech.

14
00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:08,490
- Marrakech? Sounds like a drink.
- Mmm. It sure does.

15
00:04:41,404 --> 00:04:43,906
Wait a minute. Hold on there.
What's the matter?

16
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:07,517
Well, I sure want to thank you.

17
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:09,978
Without your help,
anything might have happened here.

18
00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:11,981
My pleasure, monsieur.

19
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:14,692
There are moments in life
when we all need a little help.

20
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:17,821
Yeah. Just what was the trouble?

21
00:05:17,946 --> 00:05:21,283
Uh... your little boy accidentally
pulled off his wife's veil.

22
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:23,452
- Oh. Yeah.
- Hank!

23
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:25,413
I want to introduce my wife,
Mrs McKenna.

24
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:27,207
- How do you do?
- How do you do, madame?

25
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:28,833
My name is Louis Bernard.

26
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,378
We thank you very much, Mr Bernard.

27
00:05:31,545 --> 00:05:33,756
- That's our son, Hank.
- Hello, Hank.

28
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:35,925
Hello. You talk Arab talk.

29
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,886
A few words.

30
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:40,222
Why was he angry? It was an accident.

31
00:05:40,388 --> 00:05:44,518
But the Muslim religion
allows for few accidents.

32
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:46,521
- Yeah, I suppose so.
- Oh.

33
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:49,524
- May I?
- Yeah, sit down right in front of Jo.

34
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:53,111
Oh, I thought his name was Hank.

35
00:05:53,237 --> 00:05:55,197
Oh, it's my wife's name.

36
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:57,492
- J-O. No E.
- How different.

37
00:05:57,617 --> 00:05:59,452
Short for Josephine.

38
00:05:59,577 --> 00:06:02,706
I've called her that so long
nobody knows her by any other name.

39
00:06:02,873 --> 00:06:04,833
- I do. Mommy.
- Oh, yeah.

40
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,503
Now, about the accident.

41
00:06:07,628 --> 00:06:11,925
A Muslim woman never takes off her veil
in public under any circumstances.

42
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:14,011
They feed her intravenously?

43
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:17,556
- No, Hank.
- What a big word for such a small boy.

44
00:06:17,723 --> 00:06:19,559
I'm a doctor.

45
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:22,354
Oh. Well, he sounds like one.

46
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,523
He can spell haemoglobin.

47
00:06:24,648 --> 00:06:27,610
He has a little trouble
with words like dog and cat.

48
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,531
Where do you practise, doctor?

49
00:06:31,698 --> 00:06:34,701
Indianapolis, Indiana.
Good Samaritan Hospital out there.

50
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:36,829
What brings you to Marrakech?

51
00:06:36,954 --> 00:06:38,956
We were attending
a medical convention in Paris

52
00:06:39,123 --> 00:06:41,084
and I thought,
inasmuch as we were in Europe,

53
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:43,670
I'd come and see Morocco again.

54
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:47,091
Daddy liberated Africa.

55
00:06:47,257 --> 00:06:49,218
I was stationed up in Casablanca

56
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:52,222
at an army field hospital during the war.

57
00:06:52,347 --> 00:06:55,267
- Do you live in Morocco, Mr Bernard?
- No.

58
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:58,187
I suppose you came directly from Paris.

59
00:06:58,312 --> 00:07:00,481
No, we looked in on Lisbon and Rome.

60
00:07:00,606 --> 00:07:03,318
- And Casablanca.
- And Casablanca.

61
00:07:04,486 --> 00:07:07,155
I hope you will have time
to truly enjoy Marrakech.

62
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:10,034
Let's see.
We'll have, at the most, three days.

63
00:07:10,826 --> 00:07:15,040
You will, naturally, be stopping
at the Hotel Mamounia or Le Menara?

64
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:16,708
Why do you ask?

65
00:07:17,793 --> 00:07:20,838
Because they are hotels
for tourists of good taste.

66
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:24,300
Oh. Do you live in France, Mr Bernard?

67
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:26,470
- Sometimes.
- Do you eat snails?

68
00:07:26,636 --> 00:07:28,722
When I'm lucky enough.

69
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:31,684
If you ever get hungry,
our garden back home is full of snails.

70
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,811
Thank you for the invitation.

71
00:07:33,978 --> 00:07:36,940
That's alright.
We tried everything to get rid of them.

72
00:07:37,065 --> 00:07:39,401
We never thought of a Frenchman.

73
00:08:36,968 --> 00:08:38,970
Here we go.

74
00:08:39,763 --> 00:08:42,307
Say, do you want to
share a taxi with us to the hotel?

75
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:45,936
That's kind of you, Doctor, but
unfortunately I have some business first.

76
00:08:46,103 --> 00:08:48,523
- Oh. OK.
- What business are you in, Mr Bernard?

77
00:08:48,648 --> 00:08:51,943
I'll be there later and perhaps
we might have a drink together.

78
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,071
Come up to our suite.
We'll have a drink up there.

79
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:57,825
- In that case, I will take you to dinner.
- No, no. That's not fair.

80
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,745
I know Marrakech.
I can show you an Arab restaurant

81
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,498
where the food is different
and the manner of eating exotic.

82
00:09:03,624 --> 00:09:05,626
That's what we came here for.

83
00:09:05,751 --> 00:09:08,421
- How about one of those Arabian nights?
- I'd love it.

84
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:12,968
How would you prefer to travel
to the hotel, by taxi?

85
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:16,263
- Gee, I don't know.
- A wagon! I wanna ride in a wagon!

86
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,892
I guess it's a wagon. See you later.

87
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,354
Au revoir. I look forward to the cocktails.

88
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,940
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

89
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:28,444
Hank, you sit up with the driver.

90
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:32,615
How do you like this?
A horse-drawn convertible.

91
00:09:46,507 --> 00:09:49,009
Well, I just saw Louis Bernard
talking to that Arab.

92
00:09:49,176 --> 00:09:51,137
- What Arab?
- The one that was shouting at Hank.

93
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:53,556
They were talking like
they were dear friends.

94
00:09:53,681 --> 00:09:55,684
Well, he probably knew him before.

95
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:57,561
What does that mean?

96
00:09:57,686 --> 00:10:00,731
It means that Mr Bernard
is a very mysterious man.

97
00:10:00,856 --> 00:10:04,569
What? He seemed perfectly normal to me.

98
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:06,697
Now, what do you
really know about him?

99
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:10,075
What do I - I know his name.
We were sitting there, we were talking.

100
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:14,831
You don't know anything about this man,
and he knows everything about you.

101
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:16,458
Oh, wait.

102
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,627
He knows that you live
in Indianapolis, Indiana.

103
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:21,172
He knows you're a doctor
at the Good Samaritan Hospital.

104
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:25,009
He knows that you attended
a medical convention in Paris,

105
00:10:25,176 --> 00:10:28,138
and that you stopped off
in Rome, Lisbon and Casablanca.

106
00:10:28,305 --> 00:10:29,973
Alright.

107
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:34,771
He knows that you served
in North Africa in an army field hospital.

108
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:37,983
Honey, it was just a casual conversation,
that's all.

109
00:10:38,108 --> 00:10:40,194
Darling, you weren't just talking casually.

110
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:43,155
He was asking all kinds of questions,
and you were answering them.

111
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:45,450
You might as well have
handed him your passport.

112
00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:49,621
We just had a conversation.
I've got nothing to hide.

113
00:10:49,746 --> 00:10:53,918
But I have a feeling that Mr Bernard has.

114
00:10:54,043 --> 00:10:56,129
I know this is mysterious Morocco,

115
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:59,049
but we're not
gonna lose our head, are we?

116
00:10:59,174 --> 00:11:02,011
- I know. I know what it is.
- What?

117
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:05,681
You're sore because this fella
didn't ask you any questions.

118
00:11:05,848 --> 00:11:08,393
- Oh, hardy-har-har.
- Hardy-har.

119
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,113
- Well, this eases the pain.
- What pain, Mommy?

120
00:11:54,238 --> 00:11:56,741
- It's just an expression.
- Hey, can you take care of the driver?

121
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:59,702
- My name is Dr McKenna.
- I'll take care of everything.

122
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:07,753
- Come on.
- We're being watched.

123
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,839
What? Oh, come on!

124
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:28,861
# Que sera, sera

125
00:12:28,986 --> 00:12:32,240
# What will be will be

126
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:36,537
# When I was just a little boy

127
00:12:36,703 --> 00:12:38,873
# I asked my mother

128
00:12:38,998 --> 00:12:41,042
What will I be

129
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:45,672
- He'll make a fine doctor.
- # Will I be handsome

130
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,175
# Will I be rich

131
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:51,971
- # Here's what she said to me
- Come on, darling.

132
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:56,143
# Que sera, sera

133
00:12:56,309 --> 00:13:00,523
# Whatever will be will be

134
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,527
# The future's not ours to see

135
00:13:04,694 --> 00:13:09,033
# Que sera, sera

136
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:12,370
# What will be will be.

137
00:13:12,537 --> 00:13:14,205
Second verse.

138
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,710
# When I was just a child in school

139
00:13:18,836 --> 00:13:21,213
# I asked my teacher

140
00:13:21,338 --> 00:13:23,257
# What should I try

141
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:25,093
Catch.

142
00:13:25,218 --> 00:13:27,220
# Should I paint pictures

143
00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:29,556
# Should I sing songs

144
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:33,269
# This was her wise reply

145
00:13:33,394 --> 00:13:37,357
# Que sera, sera

146
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:41,779
# Whatever will be will be

147
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,950
# The future's not ours to see

148
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,411
# Que sera, sera.

149
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,414
Oops.

150
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,375
# What will be will be

151
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:55,336
May I have this next dance?

152
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:57,297
- Yes.
- Alright.

153
00:13:57,422 --> 00:14:01,343
# Dum, dee, dum-da-dum

154
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:03,304
# Da-da-da-da #º

155
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:05,431
Oh, you're divine.

156
00:14:11,313 --> 00:14:14,525
- Dinner for the boy.
- Yeah, come in.

157
00:14:18,446 --> 00:14:21,074
I can't tell you how beautifully
your wife sings.

158
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,953
- Pretty good, isn't she?
- Oh, she's marvellous.

159
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:26,080
Too bad it was interrupted.

160
00:14:26,205 --> 00:14:28,666
I've had that same feeling
myself many times.

161
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,127
Well, everything's fine.
The manager has a babysitter for us.

162
00:14:31,294 --> 00:14:32,963
Good.

163
00:14:33,088 --> 00:14:35,174
Permit me the pleasure of
serving you a drink.

164
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:37,301
I would love it. Thank you.

165
00:14:37,468 --> 00:14:39,512
Were you on the American stage,
Mrs McKenna?

166
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:46,061
Yes, Mr Bernard,
I was on the American stage

167
00:14:46,187 --> 00:14:48,189
and the London stage
and the Paris stage.

168
00:14:48,314 --> 00:14:49,983
Oh?

169
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:52,277
I thought perhaps you had
seen me in Paris, being French.

170
00:14:52,402 --> 00:14:55,531
The theatre requires time,

171
00:14:55,656 --> 00:14:57,992
and for me time is often a luxury.

172
00:14:59,535 --> 00:15:01,705
Have you ever been to Paris, Mr Bernard?

173
00:15:02,706 --> 00:15:04,583
I was born there.

174
00:15:05,626 --> 00:15:07,628
Oh.

175
00:15:12,592 --> 00:15:17,515
- What business are you in?
- I buy... and sell.

176
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:21,269
- What?
- Whatever gives the best profit.

177
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,277
Now that you're in Marrakech,
what are you buying and selling?

178
00:15:28,402 --> 00:15:32,699
You know, I would much rather
talk about the stage.

179
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,993
If you tell me what shows you are in -

180
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,248
Would you excuse me? I'll get it.

181
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:41,375
- No, I'll get it.
- No, I will.

182
00:15:59,563 --> 00:16:01,941
I'm inquiring for the room
of Mr Montgomery.

183
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:04,194
He asked me for a drink, and I -

184
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:06,363
I'm sorry. There's no Montgomery here.

185
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,866
Pardon me, monsieur.
I regret disturbing you.

186
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:10,659
OK.

187
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,965
- May I use your telephone, please?
- Sure.

188
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:25,093
- Mommy!
- Yes?

189
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,346
- I can't cut this meat.
- I'll do it for you.

190
00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:36,147
Merci.

191
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:38,817
Allô?

192
00:16:46,284 --> 00:16:48,119
D'accord.

193
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:56,045
I'm terribly sorry, but I cannot go
to dinner with you tonight.

194
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,715
- Oh?
- I have neglected an important matter

195
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,677
- which now requires my attention.
- Oh, I see.

196
00:17:01,802 --> 00:17:06,057
- Perhaps another night?
- Oh, sure, sure.

197
00:17:06,182 --> 00:17:08,184
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

198
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,980
- Bye.
- Good night.

199
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,234
Good night.

200
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:33,297
- Bonsoir, madame, monsieur.
- My name's McKenna.

201
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:36,592
Of course. The hotel phoned.
Follow me, please.

202
00:17:39,262 --> 00:17:42,766
- I'm certain you'll find this comfortable.
- Thank you.

203
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:17,640
Honey, move over here.

204
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:28,611
You're on my dress.

205
00:18:42,335 --> 00:18:44,170
Whoop.

206
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,146
Yeah.

207
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:01,440
We always wash
the hands before eating.

208
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:11,869
Thank you.

209
00:19:21,755 --> 00:19:23,966
- Those people are staring at us.
- What people?

210
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:26,094
- Right in back of us.
- What?

211
00:19:26,261 --> 00:19:28,221
- Yes.
- Here.

212
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:30,349
They were staring at us
in front of the hotel too.

213
00:19:30,474 --> 00:19:32,726
Jo, will you please stop imagining things.

214
00:19:32,852 --> 00:19:34,645
I'm not.

215
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,524
Good evening.
You must think me awfully rude.

216
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:40,193
I've been staring at you
since I saw you at the hotel.

217
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,032
- You are Jo Conway, the Jo Conway?
- Yes, I am.

218
00:19:45,157 --> 00:19:49,162
I knew I was right.
I'm Lucy Drayton, and this is my husband.

219
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:52,124
- How do you do?
- We're Dr and Mrs McKenna.

220
00:19:52,249 --> 00:19:55,586
My wife tells me Mrs McKenna
appeared at the London Palladium.

221
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:57,547
We hardly ever see a show now.

222
00:19:57,672 --> 00:19:59,674
Edward is such an old stick-in-the-mud

223
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:02,177
so I have to
console myself with your records.

224
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:07,308
I must admit I love 'em.
I'm not one for this terrible be-bop.

225
00:20:07,475 --> 00:20:10,312
- Thank you very much.
- When are you coming back to London?

226
00:20:10,437 --> 00:20:12,773
- Possibly never again, professionally.
- Oh.

227
00:20:12,898 --> 00:20:15,568
- Don't say you're giving up the stage.
- Well, temporarily I am.

228
00:20:15,693 --> 00:20:19,155
It's just that I'm a doctor,
and a doctor's wife never has much time.

229
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,616
What my husband is trying to
say is Broadway musical shows

230
00:20:21,741 --> 00:20:23,911
are not produced in Indianapolis, Indiana.

231
00:20:24,036 --> 00:20:28,332
We could live in New York. I hear
that doctors aren't starving there either.

232
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,461
It's not that I have any objection
to working in New York.

233
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:35,466
It's just that it'd be hard for my patients
to come from Indianapolis for treatment.

234
00:20:35,591 --> 00:20:37,885
I'm always
saying the wrong thing. I'm sorry.

235
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,887
Not in the least.

236
00:20:40,054 --> 00:20:42,015
Dr McKenna, do you -

237
00:20:42,182 --> 00:20:46,604
Why don't all of you sort of
turn around here, or something.

238
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:49,065
It's kind of - kind of hard on the neck.

239
00:20:49,774 --> 00:20:51,776
It's in one of our English counties.

240
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:54,947
It's not what you'd call a farm.
It's more of a smallholding.

241
00:20:55,072 --> 00:20:57,241
Here we are.

242
00:20:57,408 --> 00:20:59,243
- Oh.
- Isn't that fascinating?

243
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:00,954
Yes.

244
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,415
- There we are.
- Uhh.

245
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:08,254
- Hey, they look good.
- Surprise.

246
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,381
Oh, they look wonderful.

247
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:13,301
Ah, looks like bread.

248
00:21:14,469 --> 00:21:16,972
- We're not going to eat all that, are we?
- No.

249
00:21:17,097 --> 00:21:19,392
Is that the way you do it?

250
00:21:19,517 --> 00:21:22,353
Yes, just break it, just like this.

251
00:21:23,229 --> 00:21:25,607
It won't break. Oh, no.

252
00:21:25,732 --> 00:21:28,444
Well, I'm gonna - There.

253
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:31,948
- Is that the way you do it?
- That's quite alright.

254
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:34,659
That was a tough one.

255
00:21:34,784 --> 00:21:37,412
Does it chew any better than it tears?

256
00:21:39,248 --> 00:21:43,127
- Is it fattening?
- I imagine it must be.

257
00:21:43,294 --> 00:21:45,255
No, it's pretty good, hon.

258
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:47,591
- Well, I -
- No plate.

259
00:21:47,716 --> 00:21:49,718
- No?
- No. No knives and forks either.

260
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:51,846
I understand you're supposed to dig in.

261
00:21:51,971 --> 00:21:54,307
Oh, allow me to show you, will you?

262
00:21:54,474 --> 00:21:57,436
You use only the first two fingers
and thumb of the right hand.

263
00:21:57,561 --> 00:22:00,731
You don't use the other two fingers,
and always the left hand in the lap.

264
00:22:00,856 --> 00:22:03,526
- Oh, I see.
- May I show you?

265
00:22:03,651 --> 00:22:07,155
- Ju-Just these two fingers, huh?
- I'll hold it for you.

266
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,335
- See.
- There we are.

267
00:22:19,544 --> 00:22:22,047
Well, I, uh... uh...

268
00:22:22,172 --> 00:22:24,592
Boy, could I use this hand.

269
00:22:24,717 --> 00:22:28,179
- I can't, uh...
- It's alright.

270
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,849
- It's good stuff.
- No one minds.

271
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,353
- It's messy, but worth it.
- I'll practise on an olive.

272
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,315
Oh, honey, it's wonderful.
Here. Take a bite.

273
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,442
- Good?
- Yeah.

274
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:42,363
Tell me - does this way of eating
have to do with religion, or something?

275
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,657
I think it's more social than religious.

276
00:22:44,824 --> 00:22:46,701
I don't know.

277
00:22:46,826 --> 00:22:49,287
It seems like if you have
four good fingers and a thumb

278
00:22:49,412 --> 00:22:51,623
you oughta be able to use all of 'em.

279
00:22:51,748 --> 00:22:53,751
- It's very good.
- Very good.

280
00:22:54,543 --> 00:22:56,504
Well, as I was saying,

281
00:22:56,671 --> 00:22:59,674
I was quite happy farming my bit of land

282
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:02,719
when these United Nations fellows
started worrying me.

283
00:23:02,886 --> 00:23:05,556
Edward was a big noise
in the Ministry of Food during the war.

284
00:23:05,723 --> 00:23:09,436
So we pulled ourselves up at the roots,
and here we are, United Nations Relief.

285
00:23:10,103 --> 00:23:12,105
Sounds like interesting work.

286
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,651
I'm preparing a report
on soil erosion at the moment.

287
00:23:15,776 --> 00:23:19,072
Parts of this country are not unlike
your dustbowl formation.

288
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:21,199
A thin layer of topsoil,

289
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,076
and underneath, so...

290
00:23:31,086 --> 00:23:34,131
How do you like that?
First he promises to take us to dinner -

291
00:23:34,256 --> 00:23:37,760
Yeah.
Well, we just met him today, honey.

292
00:23:37,927 --> 00:23:40,263
You can't expect him
to change his whole life.

293
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,390
Ben, what's the matter with you?

294
00:23:42,557 --> 00:23:44,810
Nothing. What's the matter with you?

295
00:23:44,935 --> 00:23:47,354
I just don't want to be insulted.

296
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,440
Oh, you're not being insulted.

297
00:23:49,565 --> 00:23:53,737
You can't blame him for turning
down an old married couple like us.

298
00:23:53,862 --> 00:23:57,283
- We're not an old married couple!
- Alright.

299
00:23:57,449 --> 00:23:58,951
Alright, he's a heel.

300
00:23:59,118 --> 00:24:00,745
I don't understand him,

301
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,872
but I'm beginning not to like
what he's doing to our whole night.

302
00:24:02,997 --> 00:24:05,000
I must do some
shopping in the market tomorrow.

303
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,668
I do hope it will be fine.

304
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:09,422
Well, not too fine.

305
00:24:09,588 --> 00:24:12,675
I know our English weather
is pretty awful, but sometimes,

306
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,803
we don't realise when we're lucky.

307
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:19,809
All this sunshine day after day,
well, it doesn't seem natural somehow.

308
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:22,061
- I want to get up.
- Ben, don't.

309
00:24:22,186 --> 00:24:26,233
I know you. Once you get
worked up, you start a fight.

310
00:24:26,817 --> 00:24:28,944
Will you come to the market
with us tomorrow?

311
00:24:29,111 --> 00:24:31,948
As a matter of fact, Louis Bernard,
the big buyer from Paris,

312
00:24:32,073 --> 00:24:34,451
was going to take us
to the marketplace tomorrow.

313
00:24:34,576 --> 00:24:39,331
- Yeah. I think I'll cancel out.
- Sit down and eat your dinner.

314
00:24:39,498 --> 00:24:42,335
- We - We'd love to go.
- Oh, we'd be delighted.

315
00:24:43,002 --> 00:24:46,673
I don't know why he gets so worked up
over unimportant things.

316
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,849
Non, Monsieur! Monsieur.

317
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,962
# Ho! Ho! Ho!

318
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:22,381
# Ho, ho, ho, ho!

319
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,424
What's he saying, Mrs Drayton?

320
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:01,259
He's the teller of tales, Hank.

321
00:26:04,722 --> 00:26:06,724
Isn't this exciting?

322
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:08,851
Just like the county fair
when I was a kid.

323
00:26:08,977 --> 00:26:11,730
They got everything
but the balloon ascension.

324
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:17,111
What's so funny?
Did you ever see a balloon ascension?

325
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:20,448
I was thinking. You know what's paying
for these three days in Marrakech?

326
00:26:20,615 --> 00:26:22,701
- Me.
- Mrs Campbell's gallstones.

327
00:26:22,826 --> 00:26:24,661
Oh.

328
00:26:24,787 --> 00:26:26,789
- You know the purse I bought in Paris?
- Yeah.

329
00:26:26,956 --> 00:26:28,916
Bill Edward's tonsils.

330
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,793
Mommy! Daddy!

331
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,923
Daddy, come with us!
We're gonna see the medicine man.

332
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:38,052
- Maybe you can learn something, Daddy.
- I wouldn't be surprised.

333
00:26:38,177 --> 00:26:40,179
Anytime he starts wearing you out -

334
00:26:40,304 --> 00:26:42,974
I haven't enjoyed the market so much.

335
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:47,271
- I never thought of it that way before.
- What?

336
00:26:47,438 --> 00:26:50,441
I'm wearing
Johnny Matthews's appendix.

337
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,610
What about the boat trip?

338
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,614
It took two boys, one girl,
and two sets of twins, didn't it?

339
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,742
And Mrs Morgan's hives.

340
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,503
- How are the acrobats today?
- Wonderful.

341
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:09,964
Watch that kid that goes
clear to the top there.

342
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:12,467
- I'll see you later.
- Yes.

343
00:27:15,303 --> 00:27:18,682
All the way home we'll be riding on
Herbie Taylor's ulcers.

344
00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:21,185
And Allida Markle's asthma.

345
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:24,856
Now if we could just get four cases
of seven-year-itch we could retire.

346
00:27:25,023 --> 00:27:27,150
Or if Mrs Yarrow's really
gonna have triplets,

347
00:27:27,317 --> 00:27:30,070
we could completely
redecorate the house.

348
00:27:30,196 --> 00:27:32,365
What would they say if they heard us?

349
00:27:32,532 --> 00:27:34,826
One of the reasons
I came to a place like Marrakech

350
00:27:34,951 --> 00:27:38,372
is so we could say things like that
without everybody hearing us.

351
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:43,169
I'd like to say something
where nobody could hear us.

352
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,296
This is the safest place.

353
00:27:45,421 --> 00:27:48,091
When are we
going to have another baby?

354
00:27:49,092 --> 00:27:51,345
You're the doctor.
You have all the answers.

355
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,390
Yeah, but this is the first time
I've ever heard the question.

356
00:27:54,557 --> 00:27:56,685
Mommy, look! Come here!

357
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:04,819
Look. Sewing machines.
Looks like a television commercial.

358
00:28:06,154 --> 00:28:08,156
- Having a good time, Hank?
- I guess so.

359
00:28:08,281 --> 00:28:10,117
He's delighted with everything.

360
00:28:18,877 --> 00:28:20,879
Hank! Hank, come back here!

361
00:28:21,004 --> 00:28:22,923
- Hank!
- Hank!

362
00:28:23,883 --> 00:28:26,386
- It's best to keep out of trouble, Hank.
- What's going on?

363
00:28:26,928 --> 00:28:29,264
Looks like the police
are chasing somebody.

364
00:29:04,263 --> 00:29:05,764
Aaah!

365
00:29:29,917 --> 00:29:32,671
Hey. Hey, look there.

366
00:29:35,716 --> 00:29:37,718
You better stand back.
Go on. Stand back.

367
00:29:53,862 --> 00:29:55,697
Monsieur McKenna.

368
00:29:57,866 --> 00:30:00,411
I'm Louis Bernard.

369
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:10,548
A man, a statesman,

370
00:30:10,673 --> 00:30:13,176
he is to be killed,

371
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:15,470
assassinated,

372
00:30:15,595 --> 00:30:17,764
in London

373
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,893
soon, very soon.

374
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:25,941
Tell them in London

375
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,946
Ambrose Chappell.

376
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:34,534
Chappell.

377
00:31:01,148 --> 00:31:03,150
- Ben, who is he?
- Louis Bernard.

378
00:31:03,275 --> 00:31:05,319
- You got something to write on?
- Louis Bernard!

379
00:31:05,445 --> 00:31:07,447
He's dead.

380
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:35,938
He says, "Do you know this man?"

381
00:31:36,105 --> 00:31:39,192
Yes, we do know him.
He's Louis Bernard, the French...

382
00:31:39,317 --> 00:31:42,487
Louis Bernard?

383
00:31:42,654 --> 00:31:44,782
Monsieur and Madame McKenna.

384
00:31:48,494 --> 00:31:51,081
He wants you to go to
police headquarters to make a statement.

385
00:31:51,206 --> 00:31:54,543
- OK.
- Our friends have to go to the station.

386
00:31:54,668 --> 00:31:56,545
- I'd better go with them.
- Yes, of course.

387
00:32:03,887 --> 00:32:06,891
You don't want your
little boy to go, do you?

388
00:32:07,016 --> 00:32:09,936
But I want to go to the police station.

389
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,397
I think it's better
if I take him back to the hotel.

390
00:32:12,522 --> 00:32:14,524
- Would you, please.
- Certainly.

391
00:32:14,691 --> 00:32:16,819
Thank you. Be good, Hank.

392
00:32:16,986 --> 00:32:20,531
We're to be going.

393
00:32:20,698 --> 00:32:22,951
Heaven knows when we shall be back.

394
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:32,253
Why do you suppose he turned up
in an Arab outfit and wearing make-up?

395
00:32:32,378 --> 00:32:34,506
What's more important:
why was he killed?

396
00:32:34,673 --> 00:32:36,675
I bet he was a spy or something.

397
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,928
What were you writing down?
What was he telling you?

398
00:32:39,053 --> 00:32:40,930
I'll tell you later.

399
00:32:41,055 --> 00:32:43,725
What is it?

400
00:32:43,892 --> 00:32:47,396
I-I just feel kinda funny.

401
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:50,608
Why should he pick me out to tell?

402
00:32:50,733 --> 00:32:53,695
After what we said about him last night.

403
00:33:06,626 --> 00:33:10,047
When we get in with the inspector,
I'll do my best to cut the red tape.

404
00:33:10,172 --> 00:33:14,803
- Fine. Fine.
- I'm going to stretch a bit.

405
00:33:14,928 --> 00:33:19,183
I'm afraid the questions will go till
doomsday if you admit you knew him.

406
00:33:19,308 --> 00:33:21,811
I don't know him at all.
We met yesterday on a bus.

407
00:33:21,936 --> 00:33:26,274
They're a cynical lot, these French.
They might refuse to believe that.

408
00:33:26,441 --> 00:33:29,236
Well, they've got to believe it.

409
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:31,363
Look at it from their point of view.

410
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:33,783
They saw this poor fellow
whispering to you,

411
00:33:33,908 --> 00:33:36,202
and then they saw you
write something down.

412
00:33:36,327 --> 00:33:38,830
Are you gonna show them
what you wrote?

413
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:02,274
Thank you, Mr Drayton,
but a translator will not be necessary.

414
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,069
Won't you come inside,
madame, monsieur?

415
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:11,076
Do me the kindness to wait.
I might have questions for you later.

416
00:34:22,673 --> 00:34:24,675
Passports, please.

417
00:34:39,317 --> 00:34:41,486
You came to French Morocco
four days ago?

418
00:34:41,611 --> 00:34:43,614
That's right.

419
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,866
You are a doctor, sir?

420
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:50,663
Yes, I'm a surgeon,
a tourist and American citizen.

421
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,834
Three good reasons why you should have
nothing in common with Louis Bernard.

422
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:56,378
I didn't have.

423
00:34:56,545 --> 00:34:58,506
You were in Paris recently?

424
00:34:58,673 --> 00:35:00,842
Yes, I was attending
a medical convention.

425
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:03,220
You came to Marrakech in the same bus.

426
00:35:03,387 --> 00:35:05,222
You had an aperitif with him
in your hotel room.

427
00:35:05,347 --> 00:35:07,099
You ate at the same restaurant last night.

428
00:35:07,224 --> 00:35:09,227
Yes, but at different tables.

429
00:35:14,191 --> 00:35:16,276
So Louis Bernard is a stranger to you?

430
00:35:16,402 --> 00:35:19,864
I met him for the first time
yesterday on a bus.

431
00:35:21,157 --> 00:35:23,910
And yet, out of 5,000 people

432
00:35:24,035 --> 00:35:25,871
in a great marketplace,

433
00:35:25,996 --> 00:35:27,998
he comes to you
when he is about to die.

434
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,670
Is that the action
of a casual acquaintance?

435
00:35:32,796 --> 00:35:35,424
I know absolutely nothing
about Louis Bernard.

436
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:39,303
Not even, I suppose, that he was
an agent of the Deuxieme Bureau.

437
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,764
The - What's that?

438
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,103
Perhaps you have also
never heard of the American FBI?

439
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:47,730
Now, wait. I -

440
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:49,607
It would be so much easier
for both of us

441
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:51,275
if you would cease to pretend.

442
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:52,902
Look here -

443
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:55,947
The dead man found out what
he had been sent here to discover.

444
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:57,616
That's why he was killed.

445
00:35:57,783 --> 00:36:00,703
He told you what he had discovered.

446
00:36:01,454 --> 00:36:06,585
Why? Because he placed
complete confidence in you.

447
00:36:06,752 --> 00:36:09,797
You not only ask the questions,
you answer 'em too, don't you?

448
00:36:09,964 --> 00:36:12,425
Let me ask you a question.

449
00:36:12,592 --> 00:36:16,805
Assuming that Bernard trusted me
as implicitly as you say,

450
00:36:16,972 --> 00:36:19,475
then I'd never reveal
anything he said to me.

451
00:36:20,392 --> 00:36:22,395
Even Americans, I suppose,

452
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:27,025
find it sometimes desirable
to betray a confidence.

453
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,319
Let's get some things straight here.

454
00:36:29,486 --> 00:36:31,739
I'm a tourist. I'm travelling for pleasure.

455
00:36:31,864 --> 00:36:34,117
I somehow got involved in this
very unfortunate incident,

456
00:36:34,242 --> 00:36:36,244
and I came here to make
a simple statement of fact

457
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:38,371
and not be subjected to a police grilling.

458
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:40,499
- I would like you -
- No, you let me finish.

459
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:42,835
Entrez.

460
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,216
Wait a minute. Did he say
I was wanted on the telephone?

461
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:50,344
I'll take that call now.

462
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,763
- But, sir -
- You just take it easy.

463
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:06,028
- Hello.
- Dr McKenna?

464
00:37:06,195 --> 00:37:08,031
This is Dr McKenna. Who's this?

465
00:37:08,198 --> 00:37:10,408
If you tell even one word

466
00:37:10,534 --> 00:37:14,371
of what Louis Bernard whispered to you

467
00:37:14,497 --> 00:37:16,958
your little boy will be in serious danger.

468
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:20,879
Remember, say nothing.

469
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:27,845
Hello?

470
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,772
Drayton?

471
00:37:39,818 --> 00:37:43,155
Didn't you tell me your wife was going
to take Hank back to the hotel?

472
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,449
- I thought so, yes.
- Call her up.

473
00:37:45,574 --> 00:37:47,702
Somebody just called me,
threatened me about Hank.

474
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:49,871
Call her up, see if he's alright.

475
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:02,427
Hotel Mamounia?

476
00:38:14,691 --> 00:38:17,194
Bien. Merci.

477
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:21,157
My wife doesn't answer.

478
00:38:25,621 --> 00:38:28,541
Concierge?

479
00:38:40,805 --> 00:38:43,933
Oh. Bien. Merci.

480
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:47,271
Oh, ye - Uh...

481
00:38:47,396 --> 00:38:50,316
What's your room number?

482
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:52,443
414.

483
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:06,209
Bien. Merci.

484
00:39:06,334 --> 00:39:07,961
I can't believe it.

485
00:39:08,837 --> 00:39:12,508
- She hasn't come back yet, huh?
- At least, nobody's seen her.

486
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:17,514
Alright, now you go back to the hotel.

487
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:22,019
You - And...
see if you can find out what's going on.

488
00:39:22,144 --> 00:39:24,063
It's so unlike my wife.

489
00:39:24,188 --> 00:39:26,983
I'll take care of the police
and join you as soon as I can.

490
00:39:27,108 --> 00:39:28,777
Look here. Don't worry.

491
00:39:28,902 --> 00:39:31,363
It's probably some
stupid misunderstanding.

492
00:39:31,488 --> 00:39:34,742
If I find anything out before you get back,
I'll telephone you here.

493
00:39:34,867 --> 00:39:37,203
- Don't waste any time.
- Goodbye.

494
00:39:44,045 --> 00:39:45,880
Who was it, Ben?

495
00:39:47,048 --> 00:39:49,217
It was the, uh...

496
00:39:49,384 --> 00:39:53,138
the, uh... concierge at the hotel.

497
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:55,808
He found out we were
being held by the police.

498
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:58,478
He just called to see
if there was anything he could do.

499
00:39:58,603 --> 00:40:02,024
- That's very nice of him.
- Yes, I thought so.

500
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,568
I told him if we weren't
back there in 15 minutes,

501
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:08,198
for him to call the American Consulate
at Casablanca.

502
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,704
But, monsieur,
if you had only told me in the first place

503
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:15,831
that you wished
to consult with your consul.

504
00:40:15,957 --> 00:40:17,959
Yeah, yeah. Come on, Jo.

505
00:40:18,084 --> 00:40:20,337
There is just one small formality.

506
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:22,965
I must request you to sign a statement.

507
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,259
If it doesn't take too long, of course.

508
00:40:25,426 --> 00:40:28,388
Wait a moment. I will send for a typist.

509
00:40:35,938 --> 00:40:37,899
Ben?

510
00:40:38,065 --> 00:40:39,984
Yeah?

511
00:40:40,109 --> 00:40:43,155
Aren't you going to
let me see the message?

512
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,616
I don't - I...

513
00:40:46,826 --> 00:40:49,162
I don't think I should.

514
00:40:49,287 --> 00:40:51,289
Darling, I'm not the police inspector.

515
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,917
I think that I should see it.

516
00:41:05,305 --> 00:41:07,308
Ben, why didn't you
give this to the police?

517
00:41:07,474 --> 00:41:09,435
- Because I didn't want to.
- But, Ben, a man's life -

518
00:41:09,602 --> 00:41:11,604
Is at stake, yeah I know.

519
00:41:11,729 --> 00:41:14,524
I just - I-I don't know
what's the right thing to do.

520
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:22,742
We should go back to the hotel,
pick up Hank and get out of here.

521
00:41:22,867 --> 00:41:24,870
- Maybe.
- Think about Hank.

522
00:41:24,995 --> 00:41:27,247
What a terrible thing this is for him,

523
00:41:27,372 --> 00:41:29,458
seeing a man murdered
right before his eyes.

524
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:32,587
- It's a horrible shock to a little boy.
- I know.

525
00:41:32,712 --> 00:41:35,382
Why don't you take that note,
give it to the American Consulate,

526
00:41:35,507 --> 00:41:38,051
and let's not
get any more involved, please.

527
00:41:51,525 --> 00:41:53,653
Why don't you get the key?
I'll take care of the driver.

528
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:55,321
Alright.

529
00:42:02,538 --> 00:42:05,041
Say, uh... you know a Mrs Drayton?

530
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:07,169
- English lady.
- That's right.

531
00:42:07,335 --> 00:42:11,173
Did you see her coming
from the marketplace in the last hour?

532
00:42:11,298 --> 00:42:15,053
- No, sir.
- Wait a minute. This is very important.

533
00:42:15,178 --> 00:42:19,600
- She had my little boy with her.
- No, sir.

534
00:42:19,725 --> 00:42:23,229
- What about Mr Drayton?
- Mr Drayton checked out.

535
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,649
- He what?
- Checked out.

536
00:42:26,775 --> 00:42:28,735
- But he couldn't have.
- Yes, sir, he did.

537
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,780
Mr Drayton, the Englishman
with the horn-rimmed glasses.

538
00:42:31,905 --> 00:42:33,908
Yes, sir. He checked out.

539
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:44,378
I don't know about you,
but I'm exhausted.

540
00:42:46,965 --> 00:42:49,551
I'll call Mrs Drayton,
tell her she can bring Hank back.

541
00:42:49,718 --> 00:42:52,137
- Just hold that call a minute, Jo.
- Why?

542
00:42:52,262 --> 00:42:54,265
Because I asked you to!

543
00:42:55,558 --> 00:42:59,604
Ben, are we about to have
our monthly fight?

544
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,275
I hope not.

545
00:43:03,442 --> 00:43:05,778
Well, then stop acting like that.

546
00:43:06,779 --> 00:43:09,282
I merely said
I was going to call Mrs Drayton.

547
00:43:09,449 --> 00:43:11,535
Just a minute.

548
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,328
Wait a minute.

549
00:43:13,454 --> 00:43:15,790
Just a minute. Just a minute.

550
00:43:15,956 --> 00:43:18,418
I want you to take these.
They'll relax you.

551
00:43:18,584 --> 00:43:22,673
Relax me? I'm so relaxed I'm tired.

552
00:43:22,756 --> 00:43:25,259
- Maybe you need them.
- These are for you, Jo.

553
00:43:25,384 --> 00:43:28,513
- I'm the doctor. Here.
- Ben -

554
00:43:28,638 --> 00:43:31,641
You know what happens
when you get excited and nervous.

555
00:43:31,808 --> 00:43:33,769
Here. Do me a favour.

556
00:43:33,936 --> 00:43:36,480
Six months ago you told me
I took too many pills.

557
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:39,150
Six months ago you weren't
a witness to a murder.

558
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:41,987
You've been excited.
You've been talking a blue streak.

559
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:44,823
- You've been walking around in circles.
- I haven't!

560
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:49,537
Jo, I make my living knowing
when and how to administer medicine.

561
00:43:49,662 --> 00:43:52,248
You'll feel better if you take these.

562
00:43:52,374 --> 00:43:55,836
You don't think you will -
I'll make a deal with you.

563
00:43:55,961 --> 00:43:57,963
We'll make a deal. What is this?

564
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:00,800
There's something about
this Louis Bernard, the police station

565
00:44:00,925 --> 00:44:03,178
and this whole spy business
I haven't told you yet.

566
00:44:03,678 --> 00:44:05,847
- What?
- Here's the price of curiosity.

567
00:44:06,014 --> 00:44:08,142
- What is it?
- There's one way of finding out.

568
00:44:13,231 --> 00:44:17,403
Alright, Dr McKenna.
I'm now relaxed and listening.

569
00:44:19,196 --> 00:44:22,825
There's been something strange about
this whole thing from the very beginning.

570
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:27,623
It wasn't any accident Louis Bernard
came up to us, helped us on the bus

571
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,750
and started up a conversation.

572
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,503
- You were right about him.
- You see there?

573
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,673
I know. I know. That's what I said.

574
00:44:34,798 --> 00:44:36,967
You were right. He was strange.

575
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:40,888
Yes, I know all that.
But what were you going to tell me?

576
00:44:41,055 --> 00:44:44,684
He started to talk to us,
and the reason he started

577
00:44:44,809 --> 00:44:48,230
was because he was on the lookout
for a suspicious married couple.

578
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:51,525
There's nothing very suspicious-looking
about us, is there?

579
00:44:51,692 --> 00:44:55,447
No, because he was wrong.
It was a different married couple.

580
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,284
Oh. And he was killed
before he found them?

581
00:44:59,409 --> 00:45:02,914
No, he found them.
He found them, all right.

582
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,583
It was in the restaurant
where we had dinner last night.

583
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,711
That's one of the reasons
he was killed.

584
00:45:09,254 --> 00:45:11,882
You'll be telling me next
it's Mr and Mrs Drayton.

585
00:45:12,049 --> 00:45:13,509
That's who it was, Jo.

586
00:45:16,095 --> 00:45:19,224
Ben, if this is your idea of a joke,
it's not a very funny one.

587
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:25,898
- I think I'll lie down.
- Now, listen to me, Jo.

588
00:45:26,441 --> 00:45:28,276
Now, listen to me very carefully.

589
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:34,617
That phone call at the police station,
that wasn't the concierge at the hotel.

590
00:45:35,409 --> 00:45:37,537
That was a man with a foreign voice.

591
00:45:37,662 --> 00:45:42,334
He told me if I mentioned one single word
of what Bernard told me in the market,

592
00:45:42,459 --> 00:45:44,462
that something
would happen to Hank.

593
00:45:44,628 --> 00:45:46,631
Hank? Why Hank?

594
00:45:46,798 --> 00:45:48,550
They've taken him away.

595
00:45:50,343 --> 00:45:53,514
But Mrs Drayton brought him
back to the hotel.

596
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:56,559
Mrs Drayton never got back to the hotel
and neither did Hank.

597
00:45:56,684 --> 00:45:58,686
- But Mr Drayton -
- Listen, Jo.

598
00:45:58,812 --> 00:46:02,107
Mr Drayton checked out
of the hotel 40 minutes ago.

599
00:46:02,232 --> 00:46:04,234
Now, come on, Jo. Sit down.

600
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,405
I could kill you!
You gave me sedatives!

601
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:10,325
- Sit down.
- You did! Let go!

602
00:46:10,492 --> 00:46:13,161
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wasn't sure.

603
00:46:13,328 --> 00:46:16,749
- You did! You did!
- Jo, please! Please!

604
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:20,170
Let go of me! Let go!

605
00:46:20,336 --> 00:46:22,923
- Ben!
- Lie down, Jo.

606
00:46:23,048 --> 00:46:25,926
Oh, Ben, let me find my baby!

607
00:46:26,051 --> 00:46:28,346
Oh, dear God!

608
00:46:28,471 --> 00:46:31,975
- I want my boy!
- Jo, please.

609
00:46:32,142 --> 00:46:34,144
Ben, please. Oh, dear God!

610
00:46:34,269 --> 00:46:35,938
Where is he, Ben?

611
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,653
Forgive me, Jo.

612
00:46:41,778 --> 00:46:43,780
Forgive me.

613
00:47:39,595 --> 00:47:41,555
There's still no word of him, Jo.

614
00:47:41,722 --> 00:47:45,226
The Draytons are definitely gone.

615
00:47:45,351 --> 00:47:48,063
The register in the hotel
says they came from London.

616
00:47:48,188 --> 00:47:50,858
Drayton told the concierge
he was a college professor.

617
00:47:51,901 --> 00:47:54,362
I don't think there's
anything we can do here, Jo.

618
00:47:54,487 --> 00:47:56,781
I can't bring the police in.

619
00:47:56,906 --> 00:47:59,076
I'd even thought of taking that chance.

620
00:47:59,201 --> 00:48:01,912
But the minute they connect
Hank's disappearance

621
00:48:02,037 --> 00:48:04,040
with Louis Bernard's murder,

622
00:48:04,457 --> 00:48:07,127
then the first thing they'll do
is make me tell them

623
00:48:07,294 --> 00:48:09,922
what Louis Bernard whispered to me
in the market place.

624
00:48:10,756 --> 00:48:13,008
That won't do Hank any good.

625
00:48:14,135 --> 00:48:16,137
We're going to London.

626
00:48:16,763 --> 00:48:19,599
The Draytons had a private aeroplane.
I found that out.

627
00:48:19,725 --> 00:48:21,727
That's how they got Hank out of here.

628
00:48:23,229 --> 00:48:26,357
It could land anyplace,
no trouble with passports or anything.

629
00:48:27,192 --> 00:48:29,194
So we're going to London to find him.

630
00:48:33,782 --> 00:48:37,912
Now, Jo... now listen to me.
This is what Bernard said.

631
00:48:38,037 --> 00:48:41,083
"A man, a statesman,
is to be killed, assassinated,

632
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:43,627
in London soon, very soon."

633
00:48:43,752 --> 00:48:47,674
"Tell them in London
to try Ambrose Chappell."

634
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,676
That's the fella we've got to find.

635
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:54,640
If he knows anything, I'm gonna offer him
every penny I have to get Hank back.

636
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,810
The Chappell guy's our only hope.
Do you understand?

637
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,647
I've got a car waiting downstairs.

638
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:05,027
I've paid the hotel bill.
We get packed, we'll be all set.

639
00:49:05,152 --> 00:49:07,154
Honey?

640
00:49:08,698 --> 00:49:12,869
We don't have much time.
You'll have to get up and get ready.

641
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:15,831
Please, Jo.

642
00:49:17,249 --> 00:49:20,086
Please, Jo.

643
00:49:41,236 --> 00:49:43,196
Would you just wait, sir?

644
00:49:43,363 --> 00:49:46,450
- Come this way.
- Jo! Love from the fan club!

645
00:49:49,078 --> 00:49:51,372
How could they
remember me so well, Ben?

646
00:49:51,497 --> 00:49:53,541
It's been four years
since I played London.

647
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:56,461
You're the kind of gal they don't forget.

648
00:49:57,421 --> 00:50:00,842
Who told them we were coming?
Ben, you didn't -

649
00:50:00,967 --> 00:50:05,680
I wired the Parnells to get us a hotel.
I never figured on anything like this.

650
00:50:12,063 --> 00:50:14,149
Dr and Mrs McKenna,

651
00:50:14,274 --> 00:50:17,611
I'm Inspector Edington of
the Criminal Investigation Department.

652
00:50:17,778 --> 00:50:22,116
As things are, there's no need for you
to go through customs. Come this way.

653
00:50:24,953 --> 00:50:26,580
How about a photo, Jo?

654
00:50:26,705 --> 00:50:28,207
Hi, Jo!

655
00:50:33,212 --> 00:50:35,215
This way, please.

656
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:37,968
We want Jo!

657
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,350
This is Mr Woburn. Dr and Mrs McKenna.

658
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:47,145
- How do you do?
- What do you people want with us?

659
00:50:47,312 --> 00:50:50,899
- Mr Buchanan would like to talk to you.
- Who's he?

660
00:50:51,025 --> 00:50:53,194
Special Branch, Scotland Yard.

661
00:51:01,787 --> 00:51:04,457
This is Mr Buchanan.
Dr and Mrs McKenna.

662
00:51:04,582 --> 00:51:07,127
How do you do? Thank you, Woburn.

663
00:51:08,086 --> 00:51:10,088
Do sit down, won't you?

664
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:15,511
Let me say we're shocked that your son
was taken from you in Marrakech,

665
00:51:15,678 --> 00:51:17,722
and deeply sympathetic.

666
00:51:17,847 --> 00:51:20,267
- Do you know where he is?
- Have you heard anything?

667
00:51:20,392 --> 00:51:22,728
I only wish I could give you
some cheerful news,

668
00:51:22,811 --> 00:51:26,399
but we might find him quite soon, indeed,
if we work together.

669
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:30,529
Bernard the Frenchman
was sent to Morocco at our request

670
00:51:30,696 --> 00:51:33,782
to check up on an assassination plot
here in London.

671
00:51:33,908 --> 00:51:39,122
You know, a good agent keeps on
staking his life. He doesn't always win.

672
00:51:39,748 --> 00:51:42,251
Bernard reckoned you
were a man to trust.

673
00:51:42,376 --> 00:51:44,378
He relied on you to come to us.

674
00:51:44,545 --> 00:51:47,632
Those people kidnapped your boy
in order to keep your mouth shut.

675
00:51:49,592 --> 00:51:54,473
- That's right, isn't it?
- No, I think they took him for money.

676
00:51:54,598 --> 00:51:58,603
Why didn't you go to your consulate
in Casablanca? Why come to London?

677
00:51:58,728 --> 00:52:00,730
- Well, I...
- Mr Buchanan -

678
00:52:00,897 --> 00:52:03,150
You're convinced these people
brought your son to London.

679
00:52:03,275 --> 00:52:06,362
You're convinced you can find him
off your own bat.

680
00:52:06,529 --> 00:52:08,781
You can't. It's impossible.

681
00:52:08,906 --> 00:52:12,285
But with the help we can give you,
there's a chance.

682
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:15,581
- A really good chance.
- But they told us not to say anything.

683
00:52:15,748 --> 00:52:18,876
Anything you tell me will be
in the most absolute confidence.

684
00:52:19,043 --> 00:52:21,045
Yes, that may be true, but -

685
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:23,715
Your son is the trump card
these people hold.

686
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,843
He's perfectly safe for the moment.

687
00:52:25,968 --> 00:52:28,971
When they've done what they want,
they'll let him go.

688
00:52:29,096 --> 00:52:31,140
Are we supposed to just sit and wait?

689
00:52:31,266 --> 00:52:36,814
If they consider your boy a nuisance,
afterwards, I'm afraid...

690
00:52:37,439 --> 00:52:40,777
There's no need for you to try
and scare us, Mr Buchanan.

691
00:52:40,902 --> 00:52:44,364
That's exactly what I am trying to do -
scare you.

692
00:52:44,489 --> 00:52:48,661
I'm trying to prevent
a man being murdered here in London.

693
00:52:48,786 --> 00:52:50,955
If you don't tell me all you know,

694
00:52:51,122 --> 00:52:53,917
you become an accessory
before the fact of murder.

695
00:52:54,042 --> 00:52:57,004
- Ben, what can we do by ourselves?
- Now, wait just a minute.

696
00:52:57,129 --> 00:53:00,132
You've been working
on the wrong McKenna.

697
00:53:00,299 --> 00:53:04,137
- Bernard talked to me, not my wife.
- Then, you tell me.

698
00:53:04,304 --> 00:53:08,308
He spoke to me in French.
I don't understand a word of it.

699
00:53:08,475 --> 00:53:11,062
Oh, Ben,
maybe they could find those people.

700
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:13,189
Maybe's not good enough for me.

701
00:53:13,314 --> 00:53:15,317
I don't think it ought to be
good enough for you.

702
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:19,154
- You're not the only one concerned -
- I didn't mean it that way.

703
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:22,283
We made up our minds
what we're gonna do. Let's stick to it.

704
00:53:24,661 --> 00:53:27,330
I'm sorry, Mr Buchanan, we...

705
00:53:27,497 --> 00:53:31,419
we'd like to cooperate with you
on this thing, but we just can't.

706
00:53:31,544 --> 00:53:34,005
I've got a son of my own.

707
00:53:35,632 --> 00:53:37,551
I don't know what I'd do.

708
00:53:37,676 --> 00:53:39,678
Excuse me.

709
00:53:47,896 --> 00:53:50,232
Telephone call for you, Mrs McKenna.

710
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:55,863
Put the telephone call for Mrs McKenna
through here please.

711
00:54:03,205 --> 00:54:05,583
- Hello.
- Mrs McKenna?

712
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:10,255
- Yes.
- This is Mrs Drayton. Remember me?

713
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,383
Mrs Drayton.

714
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:14,802
Where is our son?
Where have you got him?

715
00:54:17,931 --> 00:54:21,560
He's here with me.
You mustn't worry about him.

716
00:54:21,727 --> 00:54:23,896
Where's our son?
Where have you got him?

717
00:54:24,063 --> 00:54:26,399
I expect you'd like to speak to him.

718
00:54:26,566 --> 00:54:28,902
Yes, please. Please.

719
00:54:30,862 --> 00:54:35,284
- Hank! Hello, Hank!
- Just a minute.

720
00:54:38,997 --> 00:54:41,249
Mommy? Mommy, is that you?

721
00:54:41,416 --> 00:54:44,920
Oh, Hank darling,
are you really all right?

722
00:54:45,087 --> 00:54:50,051
I'm a little scared, Mommy,
but I'm all right, I guess.

723
00:54:50,218 --> 00:54:54,139
I miss you, Mommy. I miss you so much!

724
00:54:54,264 --> 00:54:58,603
Oh, here. Hank. Hank, this is Daddy.

725
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:01,940
- Is Mommy crying?
- Hank, listen to me.

726
00:55:02,107 --> 00:55:06,320
Where are you? Where are you?

727
00:55:06,445 --> 00:55:11,618
I didn't mean to make her cry, Daddy,
but I'm scared and I want to see her.

728
00:55:11,785 --> 00:55:16,248
Hank, now listen to me.
Tell me - where are you?

729
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,336
- Welbeck, eight...
- Yeah?

730
00:55:20,461 --> 00:55:22,797
Eight? Come on, Hank.

731
00:55:22,923 --> 00:55:24,925
Hank!

732
00:55:39,275 --> 00:55:41,611
Ben, he was so scared.

733
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:50,496
It was a London telephone exchange.

734
00:55:50,663 --> 00:55:53,541
Public call box - West One.

735
00:55:53,666 --> 00:55:57,170
Do I have to say any more?
Come on, dear.

736
00:55:57,337 --> 00:55:59,590
You may change your minds.

737
00:56:00,883 --> 00:56:02,885
If you do...

738
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:06,431
this number will find me.

739
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:14,566
Baggage for Air France flight 592.

740
00:56:24,911 --> 00:56:26,913
- Everything all right, sir?
- Yeah, yeah.

741
00:56:27,038 --> 00:56:29,208
- Your room key.
- Thank you.

742
00:56:29,374 --> 00:56:31,669
Oh, uh, here.

743
00:56:31,794 --> 00:56:34,005
- Thank you, sir.
- There you are.

744
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:36,800
It's from the Parnells.
'Welcome home, Jo.

745
00:56:36,925 --> 00:56:39,928
Look forward to seeing your family,
especially the little - '

746
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:56,239
'With love, from Jan and Cindy.'
That's very nice.

747
00:57:02,496 --> 00:57:04,498
'Ambrose Chappell.'

748
00:57:04,624 --> 00:57:10,338
There he is, big as life.
'61 Burdett Street, Camden Town,

749
00:57:10,464 --> 00:57:13,050
Gulliver 6198.'

750
00:57:13,217 --> 00:57:15,219
What are you going to say?

751
00:57:15,344 --> 00:57:19,349
That I'll keep my mouth shut
and offer him all the money we have.

752
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:23,354
Operator?

753
00:57:23,479 --> 00:57:28,067
Operator, I want Gulliver 6198.

754
00:57:28,192 --> 00:57:30,695
I'll get it.

755
00:57:34,283 --> 00:57:36,243
Jo! Oh, you look wonderful!

756
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:38,496
When we got your wire,
I couldn't believe it.

757
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,458
- What were you doing in Morocco?
- Sightseeing.

758
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:45,421
You're the perfect answer to what
London needs, Jo. This week's so dull.

759
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:47,548
Ambrose Chappell?

760
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:49,425
Mr Ambrose Chappell?

761
00:57:49,592 --> 00:57:52,095
Oh, Mr Conway,
I didn't know you were there.

762
00:57:52,262 --> 00:57:55,432
McKenna! Dr McKenna.
Welcome to London town, Doctor.

763
00:57:55,557 --> 00:57:57,893
I knew you were married, but a doctor?

764
00:57:58,019 --> 00:58:01,064
How clever. Especially in
such a psychosomatic business.

765
00:58:01,189 --> 00:58:05,986
Jan, be quiet. You wouldn't know
what psychosomatic means.

766
00:58:06,111 --> 00:58:08,573
It's when your mind gets sick
of your body.

767
00:58:08,698 --> 00:58:13,370
- The doctor's trying to telephone.
- No, no. It's just some business.

768
00:58:13,495 --> 00:58:17,041
Business is everything. Shh.

769
00:58:17,166 --> 00:58:20,253
Hello. Hello? Ambrose Chappell.

770
00:58:20,378 --> 00:58:23,006
I say, is this Mr Ambrose Chappell?

771
00:58:23,173 --> 00:58:25,509
My name's McKenna.

772
00:58:25,676 --> 00:58:28,304
Dr Benjamin McKenna.

773
00:58:30,014 --> 00:58:32,892
We don't need to be quiet.
How about a drink?

774
00:58:33,017 --> 00:58:36,313
I was wondering
if you'd be at your address for a while.

775
00:58:36,438 --> 00:58:39,775
I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes.

776
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,903
Thank you. I'll be right over.

777
00:58:43,488 --> 00:58:45,657
I'd like all of you to meet my husband.

778
00:58:45,824 --> 00:58:48,744
I've heard so much about you.
It's nice to see you in person.

779
00:58:48,869 --> 00:58:51,372
This is Val's wife, Helen.

780
00:58:51,539 --> 00:58:56,211
You look just like those pictures Jo had.
Haven't changed a bit.

781
00:58:56,378 --> 00:58:59,506
Why should he? He's a doctor.
Probably gets free hormones.

782
00:58:59,673 --> 00:59:02,176
I'm Jan Peterson.
I sing almost as well as your wife.

783
00:59:03,386 --> 00:59:06,890
And this is Cindy Fontaine
from Harrisburg, PA.

784
00:59:07,057 --> 00:59:09,435
Oh, Harrisburg. Been back home lately?

785
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,896
How can I?
They know me there As Elva McDuff.

786
00:59:12,063 --> 00:59:14,107
It doesn't quite fit me any more.

787
00:59:14,232 --> 00:59:17,194
Where's your boy? I'd like to see
which one of you he looks like.

788
00:59:17,319 --> 00:59:21,240
He's staying with some other people
so we could have some time alone.

789
00:59:21,407 --> 00:59:24,661
- What's his name?
- Hank. Henry, really.

790
00:59:24,786 --> 00:59:28,457
I hope he looks like you
and has the doctor's brains.

791
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,502
These flowers are lovely -

792
00:59:31,627 --> 00:59:33,629
Well, I'll order some drinks.

793
00:59:33,754 --> 00:59:37,092
OK, but dinner tonight's on me,
a 'welcome home' for Jo.

794
00:59:37,258 --> 00:59:40,178
I wish I could persuade
her to stay a month.

795
00:59:40,304 --> 00:59:43,140
I'm terribly sorry,
but I have an appointment.

796
00:59:43,265 --> 00:59:47,103
I wonder if you'd order the drinks.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

797
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:50,065
- Excuse me, please.
- Ben, please.

798
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,443
- Ben...
- It's got to be done.

799
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:55,738
- Take me with you.
- I can't. I won't disappear.

800
00:59:55,905 --> 00:59:59,910
- Please let me go with you.
- Two are easier to follow than one.

801
01:00:00,077 --> 01:00:03,247
We don't want Buchanan's men
or the others on our tracks.

802
01:00:03,372 --> 01:00:06,083
I'm going out through
the service entrance.

803
01:02:57,490 --> 01:02:59,492
- Yes, sir?
- Ambrose Chappell?

804
01:02:59,659 --> 01:03:01,620
Come in.

805
01:03:08,002 --> 01:03:10,005
There's a gent to see you, sir.

806
01:03:18,097 --> 01:03:20,892
Good afternoon, sir.
I am Ambrose Chappell.

807
01:03:21,017 --> 01:03:22,978
What can I do for you?

808
01:03:23,854 --> 01:03:25,981
Well, I - I, uh -

809
01:03:26,107 --> 01:03:28,526
If you gave me your name,
that might be a start.

810
01:03:28,693 --> 01:03:33,240
My name is McKenna.
Dr Benjamin McKenna.

811
01:03:33,365 --> 01:03:35,910
- I phoned you.
- Oh, yes, yes.

812
01:03:36,035 --> 01:03:39,414
You are Ambrose Chappell?

813
01:03:39,539 --> 01:03:43,543
Well, I've been Ambrose Chappell
for nearly 71 years.

814
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:46,505
But, uh...
I think I understand your problem.

815
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:48,591
- You do, huh?
- Certainly.

816
01:03:48,716 --> 01:03:52,429
It happens all the time.
You expected someone else?

817
01:03:52,971 --> 01:03:55,808
Just a moment. Ambrose?

818
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,357
I think this gentleman
wants to talk to us.

819
01:04:08,489 --> 01:04:12,410
Now, Father, why don't you
go and have a nice rest?

820
01:04:12,535 --> 01:04:15,288
Hm? I have centuries of rest
ahead of me, thank you.

821
01:04:15,414 --> 01:04:17,416
Good day to you, sir.

822
01:04:18,542 --> 01:04:21,295
- Now, what can I do for you?
- I'm Dr McKenna.

823
01:04:23,631 --> 01:04:27,720
- That name mean anything to you?
- No. No, I don't think so.

824
01:04:28,304 --> 01:04:30,139
You've no idea why I'm here?

825
01:04:32,475 --> 01:04:34,644
My dear sir, I haven't the faintest idea.

826
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,859
But your name was given to me
by someone I met in Marrakech.

827
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:44,072
- Oh, yes?
- Yes, and I think you know this man.

828
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:49,244
- Louis Bernard, a Frenchman.
- Louis Bernard?

829
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:54,417
Let's stop fooling around. Bernard
told me to come here just before he died.

830
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:58,422
This man is... dead?

831
01:04:58,547 --> 01:05:00,549
You know he's dead just as well as I do.

832
01:05:00,674 --> 01:05:03,928
Now, I have a business proposition.
I don't see how you can turn it down.

833
01:05:11,353 --> 01:05:16,609
- Exactly what had you in mind?
- Well er... You want to talk here?

834
01:05:16,735 --> 01:05:19,571
Certainly.
We have no secrets from our employees.

835
01:05:21,156 --> 01:05:23,117
OK, now, in the first place,

836
01:05:23,242 --> 01:05:27,205
I haven't uttered a word of what Bernard
told me before he died, and I never will.

837
01:05:27,747 --> 01:05:30,459
Frankly, I'm not interested
in political intrigue.

838
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:33,546
I don't care who you fellows
are gonna kill in London.

839
01:05:33,671 --> 01:05:37,884
All I want's that boy, and I'll take
the next aeroplane back to America.

840
01:05:38,468 --> 01:05:41,013
Come on, please. Listen to me, will ya?

841
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:44,642
Honestly, if money means anything to you,
I'll do...

842
01:05:44,767 --> 01:05:48,104
Father, call the police.
Shall we go into this -

843
01:05:48,229 --> 01:05:52,025
Wait a minute.
You told him to call the police.

844
01:05:52,192 --> 01:05:55,529
- What's the idea, trying to bluff me?
- My dear sir -

845
01:05:55,655 --> 01:05:58,992
- And you don't know Louis Bernard?
- Never heard of him.

846
01:05:59,117 --> 01:06:01,745
You've got no idea what happened
in Marrakech and where my boy is?

847
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:03,872
- No.
- Where is he?

848
01:06:04,039 --> 01:06:06,626
William! Edgar! Davis! Help!

849
01:06:08,211 --> 01:06:10,714
Now, wait a minute! Wait! Hold on.

850
01:06:10,881 --> 01:06:15,344
It's obvious I'm in the wrong place.
Now, let go of me.

851
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:31,488
I made a mistake. Now, let me go.

852
01:06:41,207 --> 01:06:43,210
Hold him! Hold him!

853
01:06:47,256 --> 01:06:49,050
Ouch!

854
01:06:49,175 --> 01:06:51,177
Hold him. Hold him.

855
01:06:57,893 --> 01:07:01,230
He said that even if Bud Flanagan
was dressed by Hartnell,

856
01:07:01,356 --> 01:07:03,650
nobody would believe
he was an aristocrat.

857
01:07:03,775 --> 01:07:06,570
So I said, "Listen, Chris,

858
01:07:06,695 --> 01:07:10,116
why don't you take William
Hickey's column out of the paper?"

859
01:07:10,241 --> 01:07:13,870
Jo? Jo, what's become of that
unpredictable husband of yours?

860
01:07:13,995 --> 01:07:15,789
He's been gone over an hour now.

861
01:07:15,956 --> 01:07:20,586
- He went to see some man. Church?
- No, it was Chappell.

862
01:07:28,303 --> 01:07:30,848
It's not a man. It's a place.

863
01:07:34,561 --> 01:07:36,563
It's Ambrose Chapel!

864
01:07:36,688 --> 01:07:40,150
- Do they list chapels in the directory?
- Let's take a look.

865
01:07:40,317 --> 01:07:42,278
Please help me find it.

866
01:07:42,987 --> 01:07:46,700
Let's see. Here we are. Ambrose...

867
01:07:46,825 --> 01:07:50,663
Ambrose and Chafer...
Ambrose Chapel! 17 Ambrose Street, W2.

868
01:07:50,788 --> 01:07:52,790
17 Ambrose Street, W2.

869
01:07:52,915 --> 01:07:55,919
17 Ambrose Street, W2.

870
01:07:56,044 --> 01:07:58,463
17 Ambrose Street.

871
01:08:00,299 --> 01:08:02,301
Look, darlings, I have to go.

872
01:08:02,426 --> 01:08:05,597
I'm very sorry. Have another drink.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

873
01:08:05,722 --> 01:08:08,266
And explain to Ben when he comes in,
would you?

874
01:08:08,391 --> 01:08:11,562
Explain what?

875
01:08:26,287 --> 01:08:29,082
Look, there's something
weird going on here and I -

876
01:08:29,207 --> 01:08:32,044
Let's try to figure the whole thing out.
First, there was a man named -

877
01:08:32,169 --> 01:08:34,880
- Ambrose Chappell.
- And Ben dashed off to see him.

878
01:08:35,047 --> 01:08:38,009
Then Jo said it wasn't a man but a place
and she dashed off.

879
01:08:38,176 --> 01:08:41,013
Don't mention it again,
or I might dash off.

880
01:08:41,138 --> 01:08:43,557
- What a temptation.
- Can you fathom it?

881
01:08:43,682 --> 01:08:48,188
It's probably some new American gag.

882
01:08:49,397 --> 01:08:52,359
- Well, hello again.
- Oh.

883
01:08:52,484 --> 01:08:56,155
I'm awfully sorry I had to rush off,
but there was something I had to do.

884
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:59,159
Oh, boy, I could use this.

885
01:08:59,284 --> 01:09:03,205
Thank you. Well, I - Where's Jo?

886
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:05,916
- She's gone to Ambrose Chapel.
- I just came from there.

887
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:10,547
- Not your Ambrose Chappell.
- It isn't a he, it's a building.

888
01:09:10,672 --> 01:09:13,050
She just left 20 minutes ago.

889
01:09:13,175 --> 01:09:17,221
She... What? What do you mean?

890
01:09:17,346 --> 01:09:20,517
- Where's the address?
- I'll look it up again.

891
01:09:20,642 --> 01:09:23,353
What is this? You say it's a building?

892
01:09:23,478 --> 01:09:26,816
Ambrose Chapel,
17 Ambrose Street, Bayswater.

893
01:09:26,941 --> 01:09:28,943
17 Ambrose Street, Bayswater.

894
01:09:32,405 --> 01:09:36,577
Yes? Doctor!
Doctor, come back! It's Jo.

895
01:09:40,331 --> 01:09:43,001
- Jo?
- Ben? What happened?

896
01:09:43,126 --> 01:09:48,090
- No. It was a wild-goose chase.
- It must be the chapel. I've found it.

897
01:09:48,215 --> 01:09:51,427
It's just a short way from here.

898
01:09:51,594 --> 01:09:53,930
I know the address. I'll be right over.

899
01:09:54,055 --> 01:09:55,349
I'll meet you outside.

900
01:09:55,474 --> 01:09:57,977
Bye, dear.
What did you say the address was?

901
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:00,980
17 Ambrose Street, Bayswater.

902
01:10:01,105 --> 01:10:03,108
I don't know how to thank you.

903
01:11:00,632 --> 01:11:04,303
Three men. You don't know much
about checkers, do you?

904
01:11:04,428 --> 01:11:07,349
You'd better go to bed,
or you'll be overtired.

905
01:11:07,474 --> 01:11:09,643
Can I finish? I'm winning.

906
01:11:09,768 --> 01:11:13,689
Yes, finish.
Edna, see he has some milk and biscuits.

907
01:11:13,814 --> 01:11:16,860
He'd better be put to sleep.
I've got to get downstairs.

908
01:11:17,026 --> 01:11:21,323
No, it's not necessary tonight.
You'll sleep, Hank, won't you?

909
01:11:21,448 --> 01:11:25,328
- I guess so.
- Oh, hurry up, if you want to finish this.

910
01:11:25,453 --> 01:11:28,790
Look, it doesn't hurt to be kind, does it?

911
01:11:30,417 --> 01:11:33,337
Give me a yell
when you want me to unlock the door.

912
01:11:44,475 --> 01:11:46,811
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

913
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,761
I wish it was tomorrow.

914
01:12:15,928 --> 01:12:18,431
That's not a very orthodox sentiment.

915
01:12:20,975 --> 01:12:22,936
Ah, before I forget.

916
01:12:23,812 --> 01:12:25,814
Here you are, my friend.

917
01:12:25,981 --> 01:12:30,695
Two tickets for the concert
at the Albert Hall, with my compliments.

918
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:32,948
Your box is nicely placed.

919
01:12:33,073 --> 01:12:35,617
Or, should we say, strategically placed.

920
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:39,330
- And now for the most important part.
- What is it?

921
01:12:39,497 --> 01:12:42,250
A record of the delightful piece
they're going to play.

922
01:12:42,375 --> 01:12:45,879
Music's less in your line
than marksmanship.

923
01:12:46,922 --> 01:12:51,344
If you listen, I'm going to play you
the exact moment when you can shoot.

924
01:12:51,511 --> 01:12:53,471
So listen carefully.

925
01:12:53,638 --> 01:12:57,476
# Finding...

926
01:12:58,727 --> 01:13:02,982
# Release! #

927
01:13:03,107 --> 01:13:07,404
We'll have it once more.
Listen for the crash of the cymbals.

928
01:13:07,529 --> 01:13:11,158
# Finding...

929
01:13:12,535 --> 01:13:16,748
# Release! #

930
01:13:20,044 --> 01:13:24,507
You see? At such a moment,
your shot will never be heard.

931
01:13:24,632 --> 01:13:26,927
Even the listeners
will be undisturbed.

932
01:13:27,052 --> 01:13:31,432
I think the composer would've
appreciated that. No-one will know.

933
01:13:32,391 --> 01:13:38,023
- No-one except one. - That's
right, if you're clever, my friend.

934
01:13:39,024 --> 01:13:42,820
- Any questions, musical or otherwise?
- No.

935
01:13:42,945 --> 01:13:46,366
There's one comforting thought -
it happens early in the evening.

936
01:13:46,491 --> 01:13:50,996
I hope I shan't upset you if I tell you
you've only time for one shot.

937
01:13:51,121 --> 01:13:54,459
- If you need another, the risk is yours.
- I don't take risks.

938
01:13:54,584 --> 01:13:56,586
I'm very glad to hear that.

939
01:13:56,753 --> 01:14:00,549
Traipsing all the way to Marrakech
for you, I should like you to do me credit.

940
01:14:02,009 --> 01:14:04,011
Your distinguished target
is already on his way.

941
01:14:04,136 --> 01:14:07,515
There's a car waiting for you downstairs
in the back entrance.

942
01:14:08,058 --> 01:14:12,855
You're to pick up a Miss Benson
on the way. She'll be your companion.

943
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:16,776
She'll lend you an air of respectability,
if that's possible.

944
01:14:17,944 --> 01:14:20,906
Will you have the money
when I return?

945
01:14:21,448 --> 01:14:23,367
Don't you trust me?

946
01:14:25,202 --> 01:14:27,413
What is your English proverb?

947
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:30,167
"A wolf in sheep's clothing."

948
01:14:31,251 --> 01:14:34,880
A very clever disguise, I must say.

949
01:14:35,005 --> 01:14:39,177
I think you'd better be going.
It's impolite to be late for a concert.

950
01:14:39,302 --> 01:14:43,974
And it would be awkward if they made
you wait until the first item was over.

951
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:48,563
- Will you show our friend to the car?
- Yes, of course.

952
01:14:48,688 --> 01:14:53,527
I'm sorry you have to sneak out, but
we must preserve a respectable front.

953
01:15:04,081 --> 01:15:08,252
# Finding...

954
01:15:09,462 --> 01:15:12,048
# Release!

955
01:15:44,961 --> 01:15:46,797
There it is.

956
01:15:49,216 --> 01:15:53,680
Yeah. You just may have hit it
right on the nose.

957
01:15:53,847 --> 01:15:56,850
You can't be farther wrong than I was.

958
01:15:56,975 --> 01:16:00,020
- Let's go.
- Should we get help from the police?

959
01:16:00,187 --> 01:16:03,316
No, honey, please.
Let's take a crack at this alone.

960
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:26,635
# Portents abound

961
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:29,513
That earth

962
01:16:29,638 --> 01:16:32,808
# And heav'n

963
01:16:32,934 --> 01:16:36,104
# Amaze

964
01:16:36,271 --> 01:16:38,690
# Wherefore

965
01:16:38,815 --> 01:16:41,986
# Do earthquakes

966
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:47,075
# Cleave the ground?

967
01:16:47,242 --> 01:16:52,581
# Why hides the sun

968
01:16:52,706 --> 01:16:56,711
# In shame?

969
01:16:58,421 --> 01:17:01,842
# Let sin no more...

970
01:17:01,967 --> 01:17:04,261
- Ben.
- Ssh, ssh!

971
01:17:04,387 --> 01:17:10,102
# My soul enslave

972
01:17:10,227 --> 01:17:13,439
# Break now...

973
01:17:13,606 --> 01:17:19,321
# This is just another wild goose chase

974
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:23,075
- # O save me
- # Let's wait -

975
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:28,164
- # Whom Thou camst
- # And look around

976
01:17:28,331 --> 01:17:30,917
# To save

977
01:17:31,042 --> 01:17:34,797
# Nor bleed

978
01:17:34,922 --> 01:17:40,887
- # Nor die in vain
- # Look who's coming down the aisle

979
01:17:43,557 --> 01:17:46,060
# From whence

980
01:17:46,185 --> 01:17:48,563
# These dire

981
01:17:48,688 --> 01:17:54,027
# Portents abound?

982
01:17:54,194 --> 01:17:59,701
# That earth and heav'n

983
01:17:59,867 --> 01:18:03,330
# Amaze

984
01:18:03,789 --> 01:18:06,500
# Wherefore

985
01:18:06,625 --> 01:18:10,046
# Do earthquakes

986
01:18:10,171 --> 01:18:15,177
# Cleave the ground?

987
01:18:15,302 --> 01:18:18,222
# Why hides

988
01:18:18,389 --> 01:18:21,392
# The sun

989
01:18:21,559 --> 01:18:25,480
# In shame?

990
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:32,197
Let sin

991
01:18:32,363 --> 01:18:34,449
# No more

992
01:18:34,574 --> 01:18:39,997
# My soul enslave

993
01:18:40,122 --> 01:18:43,042
# Break now

994
01:18:43,168 --> 01:18:49,133
# The tyrant's chain

995
01:18:49,633 --> 01:18:53,137
# O save me

996
01:18:53,263 --> 01:18:57,935
# Whom Thou camst

997
01:18:58,102 --> 01:19:01,439
# To save

998
01:19:01,606 --> 01:19:04,150
# Nor bleed

999
01:19:04,275 --> 01:19:07,571
# Nor die

1000
01:19:07,696 --> 01:19:11,409
# In vain #

1001
01:19:20,169 --> 01:19:24,382
The subject of my address
to you this evening is adversity.

1002
01:19:25,341 --> 01:19:27,761
The average life,
yours and mine,

1003
01:19:27,886 --> 01:19:30,931
is often harassed and perplexed

1004
01:19:31,056 --> 01:19:33,976
by disappointments and by cruelties

1005
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:36,479
beyond our control.

1006
01:19:36,604 --> 01:19:41,360
Now, strangely enough, it is often
these things beyond our control...

1007
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:43,821
That's Buchanan's number.

1008
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:47,951
Go out, call him up, tell him to surround
this place with police.

1009
01:19:48,118 --> 01:19:52,373
- What if he asks me -
- Tell him anything.

1010
01:19:52,498 --> 01:19:56,628
This is the time.
I'm sure Hank's round here someplace.

1011
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:03,344
- But I don't want to leave you.
- I don't know how else to do it, honey.

1012
01:20:03,469 --> 01:20:05,471
You go on now.

1013
01:20:09,809 --> 01:20:12,813
and therefore
the goodness of all mankind.

1014
01:20:20,655 --> 01:20:23,742
Few of us pause

1015
01:20:23,867 --> 01:20:27,163
to consider how life's adversities
work in our behalf

1016
01:20:27,288 --> 01:20:29,624
to make better men and women of us.

1017
01:20:29,749 --> 01:20:33,003
But I think we should pause,
and pause now,

1018
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:37,717
to do a little stocktaking,
to look into our own hearts and lives

1019
01:20:37,884 --> 01:20:39,844
and see what we find there.

1020
01:20:41,888 --> 01:20:44,850
Therefore,
instead of continuing the service,

1021
01:20:44,975 --> 01:20:47,812
I think we should all
return to our homes

1022
01:20:47,937 --> 01:20:52,734
for private meditation, remembering
how little we have to complain of

1023
01:20:52,901 --> 01:20:55,320
and how much to be grateful for.

1024
01:20:55,446 --> 01:20:59,534
Next week, I shall discuss
the fruits of our meditations.

1025
01:20:59,701 --> 01:21:03,455
Until then, my blessing
upon each and every one of you.

1026
01:22:10,157 --> 01:22:12,451
This is a pleasant surprise, Doctor.

1027
01:22:12,577 --> 01:22:14,746
Where's my boy, Drayton?

1028
01:22:14,871 --> 01:22:16,873
He's upstairs.

1029
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:20,169
You've come just in time
to help my wife with his food.

1030
01:22:20,336 --> 01:22:23,297
It seems Hank doesn't care
for our English cooking.

1031
01:22:23,464 --> 01:22:25,300
What do you want?

1032
01:22:25,425 --> 01:22:28,553
I'll give you money, keep my mouth shut.
All I want's my boy.

1033
01:22:29,179 --> 01:22:33,809
And what about your wife? Did she
go outside just to get some fresh air?

1034
01:22:33,935 --> 01:22:36,145
Tell me what you want.
I'll do anything.

1035
01:22:36,312 --> 01:22:40,192
All right. You'll see your boy.
All in good time.

1036
01:22:40,901 --> 01:22:43,738
Hank! Hank McKenna!

1037
01:22:44,614 --> 01:22:46,616
Daddy?

1038
01:22:46,741 --> 01:22:48,368
Daddy! I'm here, Daddy!

1039
01:22:48,535 --> 01:22:49,995
I'm here!

1040
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:09,809
My husband's there now, watching them.

1041
01:23:09,935 --> 01:23:13,147
He sent me to call you so you could
do something before they get away.

1042
01:23:13,272 --> 01:23:15,149
It isn't as easy as all that.

1043
01:23:15,274 --> 01:23:19,404
My husband is in that chapel
waiting for me to bring help.

1044
01:23:20,405 --> 01:23:24,660
May I speak to Mr Buchanan?
He told me to call him if I needed him.

1045
01:23:24,785 --> 01:23:27,747
I'm awfully sorry.
I can't get in touch with him.

1046
01:23:27,914 --> 01:23:30,875
He's at an important diplomatic affair
at the Albert Hall.

1047
01:23:31,001 --> 01:23:33,211
Then call him there! Please call him.

1048
01:23:33,337 --> 01:23:36,048
He's on his way.
I don't know how -

1049
01:23:36,215 --> 01:23:39,302
Mr Woburn, it isn't a matter of days,
it's a matter of minutes.

1050
01:23:39,427 --> 01:23:42,556
Now, you've got to send
the police right away!

1051
01:23:42,681 --> 01:23:46,519
- Or do I have to go to Albert Hall myself?
- That won't be necessary.

1052
01:23:46,644 --> 01:23:49,105
I'll have the chapel
put under immediate observation.

1053
01:23:49,272 --> 01:23:51,733
By the time you get back,
a police car should be there.

1054
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:56,030
Tell your husband to come out
and let the police take over.

1055
01:23:56,155 --> 01:23:59,075
Woburn, Special Branch. Hold on.
I must ring off, Mrs McKenna.

1056
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,037
Please believe me.
I'll have everything laid on.

1057
01:24:33,281 --> 01:24:35,283
There's nobody there.

1058
01:24:35,408 --> 01:24:38,036
- Are you Mrs McKenna?
- Yes. There's something wrong, officer.

1059
01:24:38,162 --> 01:24:40,665
That place was full of people a few
minutes ago and now there's no-one.

1060
01:24:40,831 --> 01:24:44,210
We are to keep it under observation
until the Scotland Yard car arrives.

1061
01:24:44,335 --> 01:24:47,422
But my husband is in there.
There were 30 or 40 people -

1062
01:24:47,547 --> 01:24:50,593
- When was this?
- No more than five minutes ago.

1063
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:53,763
- Hm, let's take a look.
- I've tried the door. It's locked.

1064
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:55,890
We'll have to force it open.

1065
01:24:56,016 --> 01:24:58,644
I'm sorry, madam. We can't break in.

1066
01:24:58,811 --> 01:25:01,772
- Requires a search warrant.
- Well, can't we get one?

1067
01:25:01,897 --> 01:25:05,735
That all takes time.
We'll have a look around, shall we?

1068
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:07,863
Matthews, take the other end.

1069
01:25:34,435 --> 01:25:38,607
- There's no-one there.
- Are you certain this place was just full?

1070
01:25:38,732 --> 01:25:42,569
Of course I'm certain.
I was there myself with my husband.

1071
01:25:42,695 --> 01:25:45,656
He sent me out to call Scotland Yard.

1072
01:25:47,325 --> 01:25:50,537
I'm afraid it's much too complicated
to explain why.

1073
01:25:50,662 --> 01:25:54,166
We'll just have to sit tight
and wait for the car from The Yard.

1074
01:26:00,674 --> 01:26:03,969
- There's no sign of life.
- Report back here.

1075
01:26:04,094 --> 01:26:07,306
Very good, sir. Walden, you stand by
and wait for the car from The Yard.

1076
01:26:07,432 --> 01:26:09,476
- That's all, Matthews.
- You're not leaving?

1077
01:26:09,601 --> 01:26:12,604
Orders, madam.
Can we give you a lift somewhere?

1078
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:16,734
- Take me to Albert Hall, please.
- The Albert Hall's off our beat.

1079
01:26:16,859 --> 01:26:19,779
Suppose we drop you off
at the nearest taxi rank?

1080
01:27:38,704 --> 01:27:40,664
Wait here.

1081
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:50,175
- They're here.
- Wait till I clear the kitchen.

1082
01:28:00,938 --> 01:28:04,108
Everybody out!
Into the corridor. Five minutes.

1083
01:28:04,233 --> 01:28:06,236
Come on!

1084
01:28:06,403 --> 01:28:09,239
Do as he tells you.
Come on. It'll only take a minute.

1085
01:28:09,364 --> 01:28:11,575
Come on. All of you, out.

1086
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:32,391
All right. This way.

1087
01:28:34,894 --> 01:28:37,730
Always something funny going on
at this embassy.

1088
01:28:37,856 --> 01:28:41,860
- Bringing people in in secret.
- Give me the Swiss embassy anytime.

1089
01:28:41,985 --> 01:28:44,447
There's neutrality for you.

1090
01:30:04,998 --> 01:30:07,000
Please, may I see the manager?

1091
01:30:07,126 --> 01:30:09,962
I'm sorry, madam.
The manager's on duty in the lobby.

1092
01:30:10,087 --> 01:30:12,549
- So is his assistant.
- I must speak with them.

1093
01:30:12,715 --> 01:30:14,676
Over there somewhere.

1094
01:30:39,997 --> 01:30:42,166
You have a very nice
little boy, madame.

1095
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:46,463
His safety will depend
upon you tonight.

1096
01:30:46,588 --> 01:30:49,383
Where is he? Where is he?

1097
01:31:01,146 --> 01:31:03,232
Good evening.

1098
01:31:03,357 --> 01:31:06,569
- Is that the prime minister?
- No, the ambassador.

1099
01:31:06,736 --> 01:31:09,406
His prime minister's
the one with the bald head.

1100
01:31:35,228 --> 01:31:38,565
- Your ticket, madam?
- I'm sorry. I'm looking for someone.

1101
01:32:13,438 --> 01:32:16,108
Cantata - Storm Clouds

1102
01:35:00,382 --> 01:35:02,509
# There came

1103
01:35:02,634 --> 01:35:05,054
# A whispered terror

1104
01:35:05,179 --> 01:35:09,350
# On the breeze

1105
01:35:10,435 --> 01:35:16,442
# And the dark forest shook

1106
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:20,697
# And on the trembling trees

1107
01:35:20,864 --> 01:35:25,160
# Came the nameless fear

1108
01:35:25,744 --> 01:35:28,623
# And panic overtook

1109
01:35:28,748 --> 01:35:31,000
# And panic overtook

1110
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:33,378
# Each flying creature

1111
01:35:33,545 --> 01:35:38,217
# Of the wild

1112
01:35:50,815 --> 01:35:54,402
# And when they all had fled

1113
01:35:54,528 --> 01:35:56,738
# And when they all had fled

1114
01:35:56,864 --> 01:35:59,575
# And when they all had fled

1115
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:02,912
# And when they all had fled

1116
01:36:03,079 --> 01:36:05,749
# Yet stood the trees

1117
01:36:05,874 --> 01:36:08,419
# Yet stood the trees

1118
01:36:08,585 --> 01:36:12,548
# Yet stood the trees

1119
01:36:12,674 --> 01:36:17,137
# Around whose heads

1120
01:36:17,262 --> 01:36:19,306
# Screaming

1121
01:36:19,473 --> 01:36:25,355
# The night birds wheeled
and shot away

1122
01:36:29,985 --> 01:36:32,989
# Yet stood the trees

1123
01:36:33,156 --> 01:36:36,117
# Yet stood the trees

1124
01:36:36,284 --> 01:36:38,912
# Yet stood the trees

1125
01:36:39,037 --> 01:36:44,919
# Yet stood the trees

1126
01:36:45,044 --> 01:36:51,051
# Yet stood the trees

1127
01:36:51,176 --> 01:36:55,056
# Yet stood the trees

1128
01:36:55,181 --> 01:36:58,727
# Yet stood the trees

1129
01:36:58,852 --> 01:37:03,983
# Yet stood the trees

1130
01:37:04,108 --> 01:37:07,111
# Around

1131
01:37:07,237 --> 01:37:10,449
# Whose head

1132
01:37:10,574 --> 01:37:13,410
# Screaming

1133
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:16,664
# The night birds

1134
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:21,920
# Wheeled

1135
01:37:22,045 --> 01:37:27,510
# And shot

1136
01:37:32,224 --> 01:37:38,189
# Away

1137
01:38:13,855 --> 01:38:17,109
# Finding release

1138
01:38:17,276 --> 01:38:20,905
# From that which drove them
onward like their prey

1139
01:38:21,030 --> 01:38:23,492
# Yet stood the trees

1140
01:38:23,617 --> 01:38:26,286
# Finding release

1141
01:38:26,453 --> 01:38:30,583
# From that which drove them

1142
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:33,795

01:38:33,962 --> 01:38:37,508

1144
01:38:37,633 --> 01:38:40,219

1145
01:38:40,344 --> 01:38:42,347
# The storm clouds broke

1146
01:38:42,472 --> 01:38:45,016
# The storm clouds broke

1147
01:38:45,142 --> 01:38:48,187
# The storm clouds

1148
01:39:19,848 --> 01:39:22,852
# Finding release

1149
01:39:22,977 --> 01:39:27,149
# From that which drove them
onward like their prey

1150
01:39:27,315 --> 01:39:29,318

1151
01:39:29,443 --> 01:39:31,278

01:39:31,403 --> 01:39:33,239
# Finding release

1153
01:39:33,364 --> 01:39:36,493
# From that which drove them
onward like their prey

1154
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:39,329
# Yet stood the trees

1155
01:39:39,496 --> 01:39:43,084
# Finding release

1156
01:39:43,209 --> 01:39:45,920
# Finding release

1157
01:39:46,045 --> 01:39:48,048
# The storm clouds broke

1158
01:39:48,215 --> 01:39:50,843
# The storm clouds broke

1159
01:39:55,807 --> 01:40:01,021
# The storm clouds broke
and drowned the dying moon

1160
01:40:01,438 --> 01:40:04,984
# The storm clouds broke

1161
01:40:05,109 --> 01:40:08,279
# And drowned the dying moon

1162
01:40:08,405 --> 01:40:12,201
# The storm clouds broke

1163
01:40:12,368 --> 01:40:15,663
# The storm clouds broke

1164
01:40:15,788 --> 01:40:21,545
# The storm clouds broke

1165
01:40:31,306 --> 01:40:33,517
# Finding release

1166
01:40:33,642 --> 01:40:37,396
# The storm clouds broke

1167
01:40:37,563 --> 01:40:39,899
# Finding release

1168
01:40:40,025 --> 01:40:44,071
# The storm clouds broke

1169
01:40:44,238 --> 01:40:46,991
# Finding release

1170
01:40:47,116 --> 01:40:53,457
# The storm clouds broke

1171
01:40:58,296 --> 01:41:04,177
# Finding

1172
01:41:04,636 --> 01:41:07,389
# Release #

1173
01:41:31,584 --> 01:41:33,586
What happened?

1174
01:41:33,712 --> 01:41:35,797
I saw the gun.
He was pointing it at the Prime Minister.

1175
01:41:35,964 --> 01:41:37,967
He was going to kill him,
and I realised I had to scream.

1176
01:41:52,066 --> 01:41:55,904
- Then he didn't kill him?
- Your wife saved him.

1177
01:41:57,614 --> 01:41:59,617
Oh, there they are.

1178
01:41:59,742 --> 01:42:02,912
Please come over
and let the prime minister thank you.

1179
01:42:03,037 --> 01:42:06,374
It won't take very long.
Would you come along?

1180
01:42:12,799 --> 01:42:14,801
Oh, yes.

1181
01:42:15,927 --> 01:42:18,472
Yes. Prime Minister,
this is the young lady.

1182
01:42:18,597 --> 01:42:20,766
Dear lady, I'm forever in your debt.

1183
01:42:20,891 --> 01:42:22,852
This is her husband.

1184
01:42:22,977 --> 01:42:25,897
I trust you'll permit me
to wait upon you tomorrow

1185
01:42:26,064 --> 01:42:30,068
and to express
to you the depth of my gratitude.

1186
01:42:30,235 --> 01:42:35,158
- It wasn't -
- But it was, my dear lady. It was.

1187
01:42:35,325 --> 01:42:37,327
Will you excuse us.

1188
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:40,706
Excuse me, but I have to go.

1189
01:42:49,132 --> 01:42:51,885
I think Mr Buchanan
would like a word with you.

1190
01:42:57,725 --> 01:42:59,770
Where's our boy? Where's Hank?

1191
01:42:59,936 --> 01:43:02,398
We can talk if you'll come in here.

1192
01:43:05,568 --> 01:43:07,528
So you both knew
the time and place all along.

1193
01:43:07,695 --> 01:43:09,114
Don't be a fool.

1194
01:43:09,281 --> 01:43:11,241
An odd coincidence,
both of you turning up here.

1195
01:43:11,408 --> 01:43:14,578
It's a pity you didn't contact
your assistant. He told us you were here.

1196
01:43:14,703 --> 01:43:17,707
- I beg your pardon?
- We need that help you offered.

1197
01:43:20,794 --> 01:43:22,754
Sir, we've questioned
the woman.

1198
01:43:22,921 --> 01:43:25,090
Said she bought a ticket which happened
to place her in the box

1199
01:43:25,257 --> 01:43:27,260
with the man
who did the shooting.

1200
01:43:27,385 --> 01:43:30,430
- If she knows anything, she won't say.
- I'll see her later.

1201
01:43:30,597 --> 01:43:33,433
- Very good, sir.
- Please tell me everything, now.

1202
01:43:33,559 --> 01:43:37,104
Everything.
There's still plenty of room for hope.

1203
01:43:46,157 --> 01:43:48,117
His Excellency will see you now.

1204
01:44:11,936 --> 01:44:13,980
And that's that, I suppose.

1205
01:44:14,147 --> 01:44:16,150
Yes. All right.

1206
01:44:20,154 --> 01:44:23,325
Excuse me, sir.
I have a lot to explain to you.

1207
01:44:24,534 --> 01:44:26,995
Something very unusual has happened.

1208
01:44:28,789 --> 01:44:31,501
I also have to have the money
to pay the marksman.

1209
01:44:32,168 --> 01:44:34,170
Wouldn't that be superfluous,

1210
01:44:34,296 --> 01:44:36,673
considering... that he's dead?

1211
01:44:44,182 --> 01:44:48,061
His aim wasn't quite as good
as you led me to expect.

1212
01:44:48,228 --> 01:44:51,691
The target merely received
a slight flesh wound in the arm.

1213
01:44:51,858 --> 01:44:54,277
Worse than useless.

1214
01:44:54,402 --> 01:44:58,574
Then your French friend panicked,
made a fatal crash,

1215
01:44:58,740 --> 01:45:00,868
landing on the floor of the Albert Hall.

1216
01:45:05,206 --> 01:45:08,001
I don't see how you
can blame me for that.

1217
01:45:08,126 --> 01:45:10,713
He was warmly recommended
by our people in Marrakech.

1218
01:45:10,838 --> 01:45:14,300
I'm glad that you are able
to treat the matter so lightly.

1219
01:45:14,425 --> 01:45:16,761
I'm holding a reception
here this evening.

1220
01:45:16,928 --> 01:45:20,641
In a few moments, I have to welcome
our prime minister as my guest of honour,

1221
01:45:20,766 --> 01:45:24,937
when I hoped and expected
that he would be totally unable to attend.

1222
01:45:26,606 --> 01:45:30,360
- That amuses you, no doubt.
- I don't know what to say...

1223
01:45:30,486 --> 01:45:31,820
No.

1224
01:45:34,740 --> 01:45:38,537
But I do. You have muddled everything
from the start.

1225
01:45:38,662 --> 01:45:41,165
Taking that child
with you from Marrakech.

1226
01:45:41,290 --> 01:45:44,752
Don't you realise that Americans
dislike having their children stolen?

1227
01:45:44,877 --> 01:45:47,922
How else could I make sure
that McKenna would keep quiet?

1228
01:45:48,089 --> 01:45:51,218
Then, to crown it all, you get cold feet

1229
01:45:51,343 --> 01:45:55,306
and come running along here to hide,
bringing the wretched child with you.

1230
01:45:55,431 --> 01:45:58,852
Don't you see what you've done
to the diplomatic status of this embassy?

1231
01:45:58,977 --> 01:46:01,063
I didn't think.
I only thought we could -

1232
01:46:01,188 --> 01:46:05,943
How are you going to get
the child out of here, eh? Eh? EH?

1233
01:46:06,819 --> 01:46:09,197
No difficulty about that, surely?
The car.

1234
01:46:09,322 --> 01:46:13,911
With plainclothes detectives planted
right 'round this building?

1235
01:46:14,036 --> 01:46:16,873
You English intellectuals
will be the death of us all.

1236
01:46:16,998 --> 01:46:19,000
I'll think of something.
Only give me time.

1237
01:46:19,167 --> 01:46:21,127
Time. Huh!

1238
01:46:28,511 --> 01:46:31,932
I want the child
removed from this embassy,

1239
01:46:32,057 --> 01:46:36,437
and removed in such a way
that he won't be able to say any more

1240
01:46:36,562 --> 01:46:38,564
where he has been tonight.

1241
01:46:38,689 --> 01:46:40,191
Oh, no!

1242
01:46:44,279 --> 01:46:47,283
- I'll see to it.
- Drayton!

1243
01:46:47,783 --> 01:46:50,328
I trust that nothing
will go wrong this time.

1244
01:46:56,794 --> 01:46:58,963
It would be very unfortunate for you if -

1245
01:47:00,882 --> 01:47:02,676
Yes, come in.

1246
01:47:05,429 --> 01:47:09,267
Your Excellency, the princess should be
arriving at any moment.

1247
01:47:21,906 --> 01:47:24,200
I recognised him. He recognised me.

1248
01:47:24,367 --> 01:47:27,246
He tried to get away, made a jump for it.
That was all.

1249
01:47:27,413 --> 01:47:29,915
Trying to liquidate
one of their own big shots.

1250
01:47:30,082 --> 01:47:32,919
I wish they'd stick to their usual custom
and do it in their own country.

1251
01:47:36,089 --> 01:47:38,050
Yes?

1252
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:41,721
Buchanan speaking.

1253
01:47:45,183 --> 01:47:47,185
Right. Thank you.

1254
01:47:48,187 --> 01:47:50,189
The Draytons are at the embassy.

1255
01:47:50,314 --> 01:47:52,316
- The what?
- How do you know?

1256
01:47:52,441 --> 01:47:55,070
We have ways of finding out,
from the inside.

1257
01:47:55,236 --> 01:47:58,407
If the Draytons are at the embassy,
then our boy's there too.

1258
01:47:58,532 --> 01:48:02,745
- Probably. But we can't do anything.
- What do you mean?

1259
01:48:02,870 --> 01:48:05,498
Every embassy in a foreign country
has extra-territorial rights.

1260
01:48:05,623 --> 01:48:08,919
- What's that? - It's as if
the embassy is on foreign soil.

1261
01:48:09,044 --> 01:48:12,590
So they can steal kids
and get away with it? What is this!

1262
01:48:12,715 --> 01:48:16,428
We could have the Foreign Office serve
a writ on the ambassador.

1263
01:48:16,553 --> 01:48:20,098
I'm not responsible for the complications
of international law.

1264
01:48:20,265 --> 01:48:24,687
If only we had some positive proof
that your boy really is in there.

1265
01:48:31,361 --> 01:48:34,156
Say, wh-what's the phone number
of that embassy?

1266
01:48:34,323 --> 01:48:36,701
- You got it?
- What are you thinking of -

1267
01:48:36,826 --> 01:48:40,288
- Let me try something.
- Grosvenor 0-1-4-4.

1268
01:48:40,455 --> 01:48:43,125
Grosvenor 0-1-4-4, please.

1269
01:48:44,043 --> 01:48:46,629
That fellow that got shot's
a prime minister, isn't he?

1270
01:48:48,673 --> 01:48:52,136
Hello? Hello, I'd like to speak to
the prime minister, please.

1271
01:48:52,261 --> 01:48:54,430
Yeah, yeah. No, look...

1272
01:48:54,555 --> 01:48:57,308
Just tell him the lady that saved his life
would like to speak to him.

1273
01:48:57,433 --> 01:49:00,896
- It's very important.
- Ben, what do I say?

1274
01:49:01,021 --> 01:49:03,148
He wanted to visit with us
so he could thank you.

1275
01:49:03,273 --> 01:49:05,693
Tell him you want to come over
to the embassy tonight,

1276
01:49:05,818 --> 01:49:08,196
cos we're going to leave London
tomorrow.

1277
01:49:08,363 --> 01:49:10,282
Hello? Here you are.

1278
01:49:10,407 --> 01:49:11,908
Hello?

1279
01:49:12,034 --> 01:49:15,871
My dear lady, this is a charming surprise.

1280
01:49:16,872 --> 01:49:18,833
Uh-huh.

1281
01:49:19,834 --> 01:49:23,338
Mm-hm. Delighted. Delighted, delighted.

1282
01:49:23,505 --> 01:49:26,091
The ambassador too would be delighted.

1283
01:49:26,217 --> 01:49:28,594
Any friends of mine are friends of his.

1284
01:49:32,474 --> 01:49:34,309
He said all right.

1285
01:49:35,018 --> 01:49:37,980
- If he asks you, we're all set.
- What if they don't?

1286
01:49:38,147 --> 01:49:40,817
Have we ever been to a party
where they didn't ask you?

1287
01:49:40,942 --> 01:49:43,862
Now, your job is to hold
their attention, right?

1288
01:49:48,784 --> 01:49:51,371
Good evening -
Dr and Mrs McKenna.

1289
01:49:51,538 --> 01:49:53,999
How very nice to see you.

1290
01:49:54,124 --> 01:49:57,127
The prime minister's waiting for you.
Come this way.

1291
01:50:05,470 --> 01:50:07,306
Ah, madam!

1292
01:50:08,098 --> 01:50:11,769
- Good evening, good evening.
- Good evening.

1293
01:50:11,936 --> 01:50:15,482
This is the charming lady
who saved my life at the concert.

1294
01:50:15,607 --> 01:50:20,738
Madam, you saved the life of the one man
who's irreplaceable in our country.

1295
01:50:22,490 --> 01:50:25,410
I hear you are the famous Jo Conway,
madam?

1296
01:50:25,535 --> 01:50:28,831
- Yes, I'm Jo Conway.
- Perhaps we might...

1297
01:50:28,956 --> 01:50:31,751
I'm sure my wife would be delighted
to sing for you.

1298
01:50:31,876 --> 01:50:35,088
- Wouldn't you, dear?
- Well, it's been quite some time...

1299
01:50:35,213 --> 01:50:36,506
I beg you, madam.

1300
01:50:36,631 --> 01:50:40,469
A tranquil coda
to conclude a dramatic evening.

1301
01:50:40,636 --> 01:50:41,888
I'm very flattered.

1302
01:50:42,013 --> 01:50:44,140
Um, Stanis?

1303
01:50:45,100 --> 01:50:47,769
Would you put up some chairs?
And hurry up, please.

1304
01:50:47,894 --> 01:50:53,735
Ladies and gentlemen, Jo Conway has
consented to sing a few songs for us.

1305
01:50:54,736 --> 01:50:58,323
Darling, would you see
that the prime minister gets a good seat.

1306
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:03,955
Would you like to come to the piano?
I do hope it's tuned.

1307
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:07,292
- Would you not like to sit down, sir?
- Er...

1308
01:51:07,459 --> 01:51:10,129
No, thank you. I'll just stand over here.

1309
01:51:26,606 --> 01:51:29,484
# When I was just a little girl

1310
01:51:29,609 --> 01:51:34,115
# I asked my mother, What will I be?

1311
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:38,912
# Will I be pretty? Will I be rich?

1312
01:51:39,037 --> 01:51:43,250
# Here's what she said to me

1313
01:51:43,375 --> 01:51:47,881
# Que sera, sera

1314
01:51:48,047 --> 01:51:51,843
# Whatever will be, will be

1315
01:51:52,678 --> 01:51:56,015
# The future's not ours to see

1316
01:51:56,474 --> 01:52:00,228
# Que sera, sera

1317
01:52:00,395 --> 01:52:05,317
# What will be, will be

1318
01:52:05,484 --> 01:52:09,113
# When I was just a child in school

1319
01:52:09,239 --> 01:52:12,492
# I asked my teacher, What should I try?

1320
01:52:13,577 --> 01:52:17,665
# Should I paint pictures?
Should I sing songs?

1321
01:52:17,790 --> 01:52:21,169
# This was her wise reply

1322
01:52:21,294 --> 01:52:25,549
# Que sera, sera

1323
01:52:25,674 --> 01:52:29,887
# Whatever will be, will be

1324
01:52:30,013 --> 01:52:33,433
# The future's not ours to see

1325
01:52:43,612 --> 01:52:46,573
# When I grew up and fell in love

1326
01:52:46,699 --> 01:52:52,414
# I asked my sweetheart,
What lies ahead?

1327
01:52:52,539 --> 01:52:57,544
# Will we have rainbows day after day

1328
01:52:57,670 --> 01:53:01,132
# Here's what my sweetheart said

1329
01:53:01,257 --> 01:53:05,387
# Que sera, sera

1330
01:53:05,512 --> 01:53:09,976
# Whatever will be, will be

1331
01:53:10,101 --> 01:53:14,564
# The future's not ours to see...

1332
01:53:14,731 --> 01:53:16,733
That's my mother's voice!

1333
01:53:16,858 --> 01:53:20,571
- That's my mother singing!
- What?

1334
01:53:22,198 --> 01:53:24,242
Are you sure, Hank?

1335
01:53:24,367 --> 01:53:26,369
Are you quite sure?

1336
01:53:26,495 --> 01:53:28,330
That's her! I know it!

1337
01:53:30,833 --> 01:53:32,794
What's she doing here?

1338
01:53:47,185 --> 01:53:50,147
Hank, can you whistle that song?

1339
01:53:50,272 --> 01:53:52,316
I guess so.

1340
01:53:54,652 --> 01:53:56,613
Then go on. Whistle it.

1341
01:53:56,780 --> 01:53:59,283
Whistle it as loud as you can.

1342
01:54:10,128 --> 01:54:12,715
# Will we have rainbows

1343
01:54:12,882 --> 01:54:15,259
# Day after day?

1344
01:54:15,385 --> 01:54:18,805
# Here's what my sweetheart said

1345
01:54:23,936 --> 01:54:27,899
# Ever will be, will be

1346
01:54:28,066 --> 01:54:31,361
# The future's not ours to see

1347
01:54:31,528 --> 01:54:33,989
# Que sera, sera

1348
01:54:35,116 --> 01:54:38,995
# What will be, will be

1349
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:42,249
# Now I have children of my own

1350
01:54:42,416 --> 01:54:47,255
# They ask their mother, What will I be?

1351
01:54:47,422 --> 01:54:52,886
# Will I be handsome? Will I be rich?

1352
01:54:53,053 --> 01:54:58,226
# I tell them tenderly

1353
01:54:58,351 --> 01:55:02,814
# Que sera, sera

1354
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:07,236
# Whatever will be, will be

1355
01:55:07,361 --> 01:55:10,824
# The future's not ours to see

1356
01:55:10,949 --> 01:55:15,204
# Que sera, sera

1357
01:55:15,329 --> 01:55:19,834
# What will be, will be... #

1358
01:55:19,959 --> 01:55:23,505
You two wait in the mail room.
I'll bring him down.

1359
01:55:25,799 --> 01:55:28,135
Give me about five minutes.

1360
01:56:25,869 --> 01:56:27,162
No!

1361
01:56:30,207 --> 01:56:32,251
Oh, Daddy!

1362
01:56:34,295 --> 01:56:36,464
Take the boy. Go! But you must be quick!

1363
01:56:36,590 --> 01:56:38,592
Come on, son.

1364
01:56:43,055 --> 01:56:44,474
Don't touch him.

1365
01:56:49,646 --> 01:56:51,690
I don't think
you're going to do any shooting,

1366
01:56:51,857 --> 01:56:54,444
not with these people
downstairs and police outside.

1367
01:56:54,569 --> 01:56:57,989
You're not in a very happy
position yourself, you know.

1368
01:56:59,574 --> 01:57:03,704
- You've got to let the boy go!
- Precisely what I'm thinking.

1369
01:57:04,205 --> 01:57:08,460
Now I'm sure you're going to be sensible
and help me out of here.

1370
01:57:08,585 --> 01:57:11,422
Don't ask me for help, you miserable s-

1371
01:57:11,588 --> 01:57:14,800
You wouldn't want
your father to get hurt, would you, Hank?

1372
01:57:17,095 --> 01:57:20,557
Now we're going
to walk downstairs together, casually,

1373
01:57:20,724 --> 01:57:22,893
like three old friends.

1374
01:57:23,018 --> 01:57:27,231
Then we're going to take a stroll
as far as the nearest taxi rank.

1375
01:57:27,398 --> 01:57:30,861
I hope there won't be
any emotional scenes on the way down.

1376
01:57:31,028 --> 01:57:33,030
Do as he says, Hank.

1377
01:57:35,116 --> 01:57:37,660
No, the other way. The other way.

1378
01:57:37,785 --> 01:57:39,788
Shall we be going?

1379
01:57:39,955 --> 01:57:41,915
All right, start down the hall, son.

1380
01:57:44,543 --> 01:57:46,546
Don't say anything.

1381
01:58:21,377 --> 01:58:26,258
# Now it's goodbye

1382
01:58:26,383 --> 01:58:28,552
# And we're facing

1383
01:58:28,678 --> 01:58:34,685
# Such lonely tomorrows

1384
01:58:36,019 --> 01:58:40,149
# So many sunsets

1385
01:58:40,316 --> 01:58:43,695
# Till there's a sunset

1386
01:58:44,780 --> 01:58:47,533
# When all at once

1387
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:51,329
# You'll be there

1388
01:58:52,705 --> 01:58:56,793
# Then we'll

1389
01:58:56,919 --> 01:59:00,256
# Kiss again

1390
01:59:00,381 --> 01:59:04,052
# And again

1391
01:59:04,219 --> 01:59:05,971
# And again #

1392
01:59:15,482 --> 01:59:17,484
Hank!

1393
01:59:20,863 --> 01:59:22,824
Come on, Hank.

1394
01:59:29,081 --> 01:59:31,083
Oh, Mother!

1395
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:41,804
I'm sorry we were gone so long,
but we go and pick up Hank.

1396
01:59:41,929 --> 01:59:43,931
Ohh!
