1
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,859
Listen to me, please.

2
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:35,862
You're like me, a homo sapiens,

3
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:38,365
a wise human.

4
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:39,766
Life,

5
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:43,970
a miracle in the universe,
appeared around 4 billion years ago.

6
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,975
And we humans
only 200,000 years ago.

7
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:53,980
Yet we have succeeded in disrupting
the balance so essential to life.

8
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,685
Listen carefully to this
extraordinary story, which is yours,

9
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:02,188
and decide
what you want to do with it.

10
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:22,908
These are traces of our origins.

11
00:02:23,108 --> 00:02:27,713
At the beginning, our planet
was no more than a chaos of fire,

12
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:30,415
a cloud
of agglutinated dust particles,

13
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:34,019
like so many similar clusters
in the universe.

14
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:38,323
Yet this is where
the miracle of life occurred.

15
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,972
Today, life, our life,

16
00:03:29,172 --> 00:03:32,075
is just a link in a chain
of innumerable living beings

17
00:03:32,115 --> 00:03:37,480
that have succeeded one another
on Earth over nearly 4 billion years.

18
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:42,986
And even today,

19
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:46,089
new volcanoes continue
to sculpt our landscapes.

20
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,093
They offer a glimpse of what
our Earth was like at its birth,

21
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:53,496
molten rock surging from the depths,

22
00:03:53,696 --> 00:03:59,001
solidifying, cracking, blistering
or spreading in a thin crust,

23
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:01,103
before falling dormant for a time.

24
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:18,520
These wreathes of smoke
curling from the bowels of the Earth

25
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:22,024
bear witness
to the Earth's original atmosphere.

26
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:25,527
An atmosphere devoid of oxygen.

27
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,830
A dense atmosphere,
thick with water vapor,

28
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,233
full of carbon dioxide.

29
00:04:32,134 --> 00:04:33,835
A furnace.

30
00:04:43,945 --> 00:04:45,747
The Earth cooled.

31
00:04:45,947 --> 00:04:50,251
The water vapor condensed
and fell in torrential downpours.

32
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:54,155
At the right distance from the sun,
not too far, not too near,

33
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:58,960
the Earth's perfect balance
enabled it to conserve water

34
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,162
in liquid form.

35
00:05:01,362 --> 00:05:03,664
The water cut channels.

36
00:05:03,864 --> 00:05:07,668
They are like the veins of a body,
the branches of a tree,

37
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:11,872
the vessels of the sap
that the water gave to the Earth.

38
00:05:23,183 --> 00:05:29,389
The rivers tore minerals from rocks,
adding them to the oceans' freshwater.

39
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,893
And the oceans became heavy with salt.

40
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,513
Where do we come from?

41
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:56,816
Where did life
first spark into being?

42
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,019
A miracle of time,

43
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:04,123
primitive life forms still exist
in the globe's hot springs.

44
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:08,727
They give them their colors.
They're called archeobacteria.

45
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:19,237
They all feed off the Earth's heat.

46
00:06:20,238 --> 00:06:22,441
All except the cyanobacteria,

47
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,544
or blue-green algae.

48
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:28,246
They alone have the capacity
to turn to the sun

49
00:06:28,446 --> 00:06:30,949
to capture its energy.

50
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:37,956
They are a vital ancestor of all
yesterday's and today's plant species.

51
00:06:38,656 --> 00:06:42,260
These tiny bacteria
and their billions of descendants

52
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,464
changed the destiny of our planet.

53
00:06:46,664 --> 00:06:50,168
They transformed its atmosphere.

54
00:06:54,972 --> 00:06:58,976
What happened to the carbon
that poisoned the atmosphere?

55
00:06:59,977 --> 00:07:03,280
It's still here,
imprisoned in the Earth's crust.

56
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:09,587
Here, there once was a sea,
inhabited by micro-organisms.

57
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:13,591
They grew shells by tapping into
the atmosphere's carbon

58
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,294
now dissolved in the ocean.

59
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,497
These strata
are the accumulated shells

60
00:07:19,697 --> 00:07:24,001
of those billions and billions
of micro-organisms.

61
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:33,210
Thanks to them, the carbon drained
from the atmosphere

62
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,913
and other life forms could develop.

63
00:07:39,717 --> 00:07:43,120
It is life
that altered the atmosphere.

64
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:47,624
Plant life fed off the sun's energy,

65
00:07:47,724 --> 00:07:52,429
which enabled it to break apart
the water molecule and take the oxygen.

66
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:56,233
And oxygen filled the air.

67
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:01,037
The Earth's water cycle
is a process of constant renewal.

68
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:04,441
Waterfalls, water vapor,

69
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,543
clouds, rain,

70
00:08:06,943 --> 00:08:09,546
springs, rivers,

71
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:13,449
seas, oceans, glaciers...

72
00:08:13,549 --> 00:08:15,651
The cycle is never broken.

73
00:08:15,752 --> 00:08:18,354
There's always the same quantity
of water on Earth.

74
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:24,460
All the successive species on Earth
have drunk the same water.

75
00:08:25,361 --> 00:08:28,464
The astonishing matter that is water.

76
00:08:28,664 --> 00:08:30,766
One of the most unstable of all.

77
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:33,569
It takes a liquid form
as running water,

78
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:38,073
gaseous as vapor,
or solid as ice.

79
00:08:40,976 --> 00:08:45,080
In Siberia, the frozen surfaces
of the lakes in winter

80
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,584
contain the trace of the forces
that water deploys when it freezes.

81
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:51,386
Lighter than water, the ice floats.

82
00:08:51,426 --> 00:08:54,389
It forms a protective mantle
against the cold,

83
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,093
under which life can go on.

84
00:09:33,827 --> 00:09:37,030
The engine of life is linkage.

85
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:39,233
Everything is linked.

86
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,735
Nothing is self-sufficient.

87
00:09:41,835 --> 00:09:44,037
Water and air are inseparable,

88
00:09:44,137 --> 00:09:48,542
united in life
and for our life on Earth.

89
00:09:48,642 --> 00:09:51,144
Sharing is everything.

90
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:14,967
The green expanse through the clouds
is the source of oxygen in the air.

91
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:17,670
70% of this gas,

92
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,673
without which our lungs
cannot function,

93
00:10:20,873 --> 00:10:25,077
comes from the algae that tint
the surface of the oceans.

94
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:29,581
Our Earth relies on a balance,

95
00:10:29,682 --> 00:10:32,384
in which every being
has a role to play

96
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:36,288
and exists only through the existence
of another being.

97
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:41,693
A subtle, fragile harmony
that is easily shattered.

98
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:53,805
Thus, corals are born
from the marriage of algae and shells.

99
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:58,109
Coral reefs cover
less than 1% of the ocean floor,

100
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:03,915
but they provide a habitat for thousands
of species of fish, mollusks and algae.

101
00:11:04,115 --> 00:11:07,819
The equilibrium of every ocean
depends on them.

102
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:23,033
The Earth counts time
in billions of years.

103
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:27,938
It took more than 4 billion years
for it to make trees.

104
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:34,845
In the chain of species,
trees are a pinnacle,

105
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:38,048
a perfect, living sculpture.

106
00:11:38,248 --> 00:11:40,150
Trees defy gravity.

107
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:46,156
They are the only natural element
in perpetual movement toward the sky.

108
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:51,361
They grow unhurriedly toward the sun
that nourishes their foliage.

109
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,777
They have inherited
from these miniscule cyanobacteria

110
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,580
the power to capture light's energy.

111
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,383
They store it and feed off it,

112
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,186
turning it into wood and leaves,

113
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:21,390
which then decompose
into a mixture of water, mineral,

114
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,493
vegetable and living matter.

115
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:29,498
And so,

116
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:31,099
gradually,

117
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,302
soils are formed.

118
00:12:45,013 --> 00:12:49,217
Soils teem with the incessant activity
of micro-organisms,

119
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:53,721
feeding, digging,
aerating and transforming.

120
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:59,127
They make the humus, the fertile layer
to which all life on land is linked.

121
00:13:20,547 --> 00:13:23,450
What do we know about life on Earth?

122
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,554
How many species are we aware of?
A tenth of them?

123
00:13:27,754 --> 00:13:28,655
A hundredth perhaps?

124
00:13:28,695 --> 00:13:32,559
What do we know
about the bonds that link them?

125
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,172
The Earth is a miracle.

126
00:13:46,373 --> 00:13:48,675
Life remains a mystery.

127
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,894
Families of animals form,
united by customs and rituals

128
00:14:08,994 --> 00:14:12,198
that are handed down
through the generations.

129
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,519
Some adapt
to the nature of their pasture

130
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:37,322
and their pasture adapts to them.

131
00:14:37,422 --> 00:14:39,424
And both gain.

132
00:14:39,624 --> 00:14:44,028
The animal sates its hunger
and the tree can blossom again.

133
00:15:25,168 --> 00:15:27,771
In the great adventure
of life on Earth,

134
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:30,073
every species has a role to play,

135
00:15:29,673 --> 00:15:32,676
every species has its place.

136
00:15:33,477 --> 00:15:36,480
None is futile or harmful.

137
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,683
They all balance out.

138
00:15:52,596 --> 00:15:54,497
And that's where you,

139
00:15:54,698 --> 00:15:57,400
homo sapiens, wise human,

140
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,502
enter the story.

141
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:05,408
You benefit from a fabulous
4-billion-year-old legacy

142
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:07,510
bequeathed by the Earth.

143
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:17,620
You are only 200,000 years old,

144
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,923
but you have changed
the face of the world.

145
00:16:22,725 --> 00:16:27,429
Despite your vulnerability, you have
taken possession of every habitat

146
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:32,334
and conquered swathes of territory,
like no other species before you.

147
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,443
After 180,000 nomadic years,

148
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,045
and thanks to a more clement climate,

149
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:45,347
humans settled down.

150
00:16:46,348 --> 00:16:49,551
They no longer depended
on hunting for survival.

151
00:16:49,751 --> 00:16:53,455
They chose to live in wet environments
that abounded in fish,

152
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,557
game and wild plants.

153
00:16:55,757 --> 00:16:59,661
There where land,
water and life combine.

154
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,691
Even today,

155
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:34,895
the majority of humankind
lives on the continents' coastlines

156
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,798
or the banks of rivers and lakes.

157
00:17:53,713 --> 00:17:56,916
Across the planet,
one person in four

158
00:17:57,116 --> 00:18:01,120
lives as humankind did
6,000 years ago,

159
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,325
their only energy that which nature
provides season after season.

160
00:18:06,726 --> 00:18:10,630
It's the way of life
of 1.5 billion people,

161
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:15,534
more than the combined population
of all the wealthy nations.

162
00:19:17,294 --> 00:19:21,498
But life expectancy is short
and hard labor takes its toll.

163
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:26,003
The uncertainties of nature
weigh on daily life.

164
00:19:26,803 --> 00:19:30,107
Education is a rare privilege.

165
00:19:30,507 --> 00:19:33,810
Children are a family's only asset

166
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,313
as long as every extra pair of hands

167
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:39,716
is a necessary contribution
to its subsistence.

168
00:19:50,526 --> 00:19:51,527
Humanity's genius

169
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:54,530
is to have always had a sense
of its weakness.

170
00:19:57,033 --> 00:20:01,938
The physical strength, with which
nature insufficiently endowed humans,

171
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:06,742
is found in animals that help them
to discover new territories.

172
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:37,372
But how can you conquer the world
on an empty stomach?

173
00:20:41,476 --> 00:20:46,381
The invention of agriculture
turned our history on end.

174
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:49,784
It was less than 10,000 years ago.

175
00:20:49,884 --> 00:20:53,888
Agriculture
was our first great revolution.

176
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,998
It resulted in the first surpluses

177
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:07,101
and gave birth to cities
and civilizations.

178
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:18,512
The memory of thousands of years
scrabbling for food faded.

179
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:23,317
Having made grain the yeast of life,
we multiplied the number of varieties

180
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:26,520
and learned to adapt them
to our soils and climates.

181
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:46,839
We are like every species on Earth.

182
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,643
Our principal daily concern
is to feed ourselves.

183
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:54,647
When the soil is less than generous

184
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:56,950
and water becomes scarce,

185
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,153
we are able
to deploy prodigious efforts to extract

186
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:03,356
from the land
enough to live on.

187
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:29,581
Humans shaped the land with the patience
and devotion the Earth demands

188
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:33,185
in an almost sacrificial ritual
performed over and over.

189
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:40,492
Agriculture is still
the world's most widespread occupation.

190
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,895
Half of humankind tills the soil,

191
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:48,099
over three-quarters of them by hand.

192
00:22:54,205 --> 00:23:00,011
Agriculture is like a tradition handed
down from generation to generation

193
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:03,114
in sweat, graft and toil,

194
00:23:03,314 --> 00:23:07,218
because for humanity
it is a prerequisite of survival.

195
00:23:16,427 --> 00:23:21,031
But after relying on muscle-power
for so long, humankind found a way

196
00:23:21,131 --> 00:23:24,735
to tap into the energy
buried deep in the Earth.

197
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:38,648
These flames are also from plants.
A pocket of sunlight.

198
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:41,651
Pure energy.
The energy of the sun,

199
00:23:41,852 --> 00:23:45,155
captured over millions of years
by millions of plants

200
00:23:45,355 --> 00:23:47,757
more than 100 million years ago.

201
00:23:47,957 --> 00:23:50,460
It's coal. It's gas.

202
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,363
And, above all, it's oil.

203
00:24:07,977 --> 00:24:12,882
And this pocket of sunlight freed
humans from their toil on the land.

204
00:24:14,383 --> 00:24:16,685
With oil began the era of humans

205
00:24:16,785 --> 00:24:19,989
who break free
of the shackles of time.

206
00:24:20,389 --> 00:24:24,593
With oil, some of us
acquired unprecedented comforts.

207
00:24:24,693 --> 00:24:27,296
And in 50 years, in a single lifetime,

208
00:24:28,197 --> 00:24:30,699
the Earth has been
more radically changed

209
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,603
than by all previous generations
of humanity.

210
00:24:40,508 --> 00:24:42,310
Faster and faster.
In the last 60 years,

211
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:46,514
the Earth's population
has almost tripled.

212
00:24:46,714 --> 00:24:50,418
And over 2 billion people
have moved to the cities.

213
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:52,820
Faster and faster.

214
00:24:53,021 --> 00:24:54,522
Shenzhen, in China,

215
00:24:54,622 --> 00:24:58,025
with hundreds of skyscrapers
and millions of inhabitants,

216
00:24:58,126 --> 00:25:02,730
was just a small fishing village
barely 40 years ago.

217
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,632
Faster and faster.

218
00:25:04,832 --> 00:25:07,835
In Shanghai,
3,000 towers and skyscrapers

219
00:25:08,035 --> 00:25:12,239
have been built in 20 years.
Hundreds more are under construction.

220
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:18,245
Today, over half of the world's
7 billion inhabitants

221
00:25:18,445 --> 00:25:20,047
live in cities.

222
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,761
New York.

223
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:36,963
The world's first megalopolis

224
00:25:37,063 --> 00:25:41,067
is the symbol of the exploitation
of the energy the Earth supplies

225
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:45,772
to human genius.
The manpower of millions of immigrants,

226
00:25:45,972 --> 00:25:50,276
the energy of coal,
the unbridled power of oil.

227
00:26:02,288 --> 00:26:05,891
America was the first
to harness the phenomenal,

228
00:26:06,092 --> 00:26:09,595
revolutionary power of "black gold".

229
00:26:11,797 --> 00:26:16,201
In the fields,
machines replaced men.

230
00:26:16,301 --> 00:26:19,204
A liter of oil
generates as much energy

231
00:26:19,304 --> 00:26:23,108
as 100 pairs of hands in 24 hours.

232
00:26:25,911 --> 00:26:29,414
In the United States,
only 3 million farmers are left.

233
00:26:30,015 --> 00:26:33,718
They produce enough grain
to feed 2 billion people.

234
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,523
But most of that grain
is not used to feed people.

235
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:41,826
Here, and in all other
industrialized nations,

236
00:26:42,026 --> 00:26:46,231
it is transformed into livestock feed
or biofuels.

237
00:26:51,536 --> 00:26:55,640
The pocket of sunshine's energy
chased away the specter of drought

238
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,341
that stalked farmland.

239
00:26:58,142 --> 00:27:01,245
No spring escapes
the demands of agriculture,

240
00:27:01,345 --> 00:27:06,150
which accounts for 70%
of humanity's water consumption.

241
00:27:08,152 --> 00:27:11,155
In nature, everything is linked.

242
00:27:11,355 --> 00:27:14,858
The expansion of cultivated land
and single-crop farming

243
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:18,262
encouraged
the development of parasites.

244
00:27:18,862 --> 00:27:22,265
Pesticides, another gift
of the petrochemical revolution,

245
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:23,767
exterminated them.

246
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:27,771
Bad harvests and famine
became a distant memory.

247
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:28,472
The biggest headache now

248
00:27:28,512 --> 00:27:33,777
was what to do with the surpluses
engendered by modern agriculture.

249
00:27:34,878 --> 00:27:37,981
But toxic pesticides
seeped into the air,

250
00:27:38,181 --> 00:27:41,284
soil, plants,
animals, rivers and oceans.

251
00:27:41,885 --> 00:27:43,886
They penetrated the heart of cells

252
00:27:44,087 --> 00:27:48,491
similar to the mother cell
shared by all forms of life.

253
00:27:48,891 --> 00:27:52,595
Are they harmful to the humans
they released from hunger?

254
00:27:52,695 --> 00:27:56,399
These farmers
in their yellow protective suits

255
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:59,001
probably have a good idea.

256
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:12,114
Then came fertilizers,
another petrochemical discovery.

257
00:28:13,415 --> 00:28:18,720
They produced unprecedented results
on plots of land thus far ignored.

258
00:28:24,826 --> 00:28:27,429
Crops adapted to soils and climates

259
00:28:27,629 --> 00:28:32,133
gave way to the most productive
varieties and easiest to transport.

260
00:28:32,734 --> 00:28:34,436
And so, in the last century,

261
00:28:34,636 --> 00:28:38,039
three-quarters of the varieties
developed by farmers

262
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:41,743
over thousands of years
have been wiped out.

263
00:28:46,147 --> 00:28:50,851
As far as the eye can see,
fertilizer below, plastic on top.

264
00:28:50,952 --> 00:28:55,456
The greenhouses of Almeria, Spain,
are Europe's vegetable garden.

265
00:28:55,656 --> 00:28:59,860
A city of uniformly sized vegetables
waits every day

266
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,764
for hundreds of trucks to take them
to the continent's supermarkets.

267
00:29:07,267 --> 00:29:11,972
The more a country develops,
the more meat its inhabitants consume.

268
00:29:12,472 --> 00:29:16,777
How can growing worldwide demand
be satisfied without recourse

269
00:29:16,877 --> 00:29:19,880
to concentration camp-style
cattle farms?

270
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,782
Faster and faster.

271
00:29:21,882 --> 00:29:24,784
Like the life cycle of livestock,
which may never see a meadow.

272
00:29:25,585 --> 00:29:30,790
Manufacturing meat faster than
the animal has become a daily routine.

273
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:34,794
In these vast foodlots,
trampled by millions of cattle,

274
00:29:34,894 --> 00:29:37,497
not a blade of grass grows.

275
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,802
A fleet of trucks from every corner
of the country brings tons of grain,

276
00:29:43,002 --> 00:29:45,605
soy meal and protein-rich granules

277
00:29:45,805 --> 00:29:48,107
that will become tons of meat.

278
00:29:58,317 --> 00:30:01,220
The result is that
it takes 100 liters of water

279
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,423
to produce 1 kilogram of potatoes,

280
00:30:04,623 --> 00:30:08,427
4,000 liters for 1 kilo of rice

281
00:30:08,627 --> 00:30:13,432
and 13,000 liters for 1 kilo of beef.

282
00:30:13,632 --> 00:30:18,336
Not to mention the oil guzzled
in the production process and transport.

283
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:26,945
Our agriculture
has become oil-powered.

284
00:30:27,045 --> 00:30:29,547
It feeds
twice as many humans on Earth,

285
00:30:29,747 --> 00:30:33,351
but has replaced diversity
with standardization.

286
00:30:33,952 --> 00:30:37,455
It gives many of us comforts
we could only dream of,

287
00:30:37,555 --> 00:30:42,360
but it makes our way of life
totally dependent on oil.

288
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,363
This is the new measure of time.

289
00:30:46,063 --> 00:30:51,068
Our world's clock now beats
to the rhythm of indefatigable machines

290
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:54,071
tapping into the pocket of sunlight.

291
00:30:54,471 --> 00:30:57,975
The whole planet is attentive
to these metronomes

292
00:30:58,175 --> 00:31:00,878
of our hopes and illusions.

293
00:31:01,478 --> 00:31:05,382
The same hopes and illusions
that proliferate along with our needs,

294
00:31:05,482 --> 00:31:09,386
increasingly insatiable desires
and profligacy.

295
00:31:09,586 --> 00:31:12,489
We know that the end of cheap oil
is imminent,

296
00:31:12,589 --> 00:31:14,991
but we refuse to believe it.

297
00:31:16,693 --> 00:31:17,894
For many of us,

298
00:31:17,994 --> 00:31:22,098
the American dream is embodied
by a legendary name.

299
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:24,300
Los Angeles.

300
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:28,404
In this city
that stretches over 100 kilometers,

301
00:31:28,605 --> 00:31:33,009
the number of cars is almost equal
to the number of inhabitants.

302
00:31:35,211 --> 00:31:39,815
Here, energy puts on a fantastic show
every night.

303
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:55,431
The days seem no more
than a pale reflection of nights

304
00:31:55,531 --> 00:31:58,534
that turn the city into a starry sky.

305
00:32:07,743 --> 00:32:09,644
Faster and faster.

306
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:13,449
Distances are no longer
counted in miles, but in minutes.

307
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:17,453
The automobile shapes new suburbs,
where every home is a castle,

308
00:32:17,653 --> 00:32:20,255
a safe distance
from the asphyxiated city centers,

309
00:32:20,295 --> 00:32:25,560
and where neat rows of houses
huddle around dead-end streets.

310
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:28,663
The model of a lucky-few countries

311
00:32:28,763 --> 00:32:33,969
has become a universal dream
preached by TVs all over the world.

312
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:35,770
Even here in Beijing,

313
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:40,175
it is cloned, copied and reproduced
in these formatted houses

314
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,778
that have wiped pagodas off the map.

315
00:32:50,485 --> 00:32:55,389
The automobile has become the symbol
of comfort and progress.

316
00:32:56,591 --> 00:32:59,393
If this model were followed
by every society,

317
00:32:59,593 --> 00:33:04,198
the planet wouldn't have 900 million
vehicles, as it does today,

318
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:06,300
but 5 billion.

319
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:09,803
Faster and faster.

320
00:33:10,004 --> 00:33:13,507
The more the world develops,
the greater its thirst for energy.

321
00:33:13,707 --> 00:33:17,311
Everywhere, machines dig, bore
and rip from the Earth

322
00:33:17,351 --> 00:33:21,515
the pieces of stars buried
in its depths since its creation...

323
00:33:22,516 --> 00:33:24,017
Minerals.

324
00:33:48,941 --> 00:33:53,045
As a privilege of power,
80% of this mineral wealth

325
00:33:53,145 --> 00:33:57,349
is consumed
by 20% of the world's population.

326
00:34:01,353 --> 00:34:03,355
Before the end of this century,

327
00:34:03,556 --> 00:34:08,560
excessive mining will have exhausted
nearly all the planet's reserves.

328
00:34:26,578 --> 00:34:28,580
Faster and faster.

329
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:33,384
Shipyards churn out oil tankers,
container ships and gas tankers

330
00:34:33,585 --> 00:34:37,989
to cater for the demands
of globalized industrial production.

331
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:41,092
Most consumer goods travel
thousands of kilometers

332
00:34:41,192 --> 00:34:45,296
from the country of production
to the country of consumption.

333
00:34:46,497 --> 00:34:52,403
Since 1950, the volume of international
trade has increased 20 times over.

334
00:35:00,411 --> 00:35:03,814
90% of trade goes by sea.

335
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:09,319
500 million containers
are transported every year.

336
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,623
Headed for the world's major hubs
of consumption,

337
00:35:12,823 --> 00:35:14,725
such as Dubai.

338
00:35:14,825 --> 00:35:18,328
Dubai is a sort of culmination
of the Western model,

339
00:35:18,528 --> 00:35:21,531
a country where the impossible
becomes possible.

340
00:35:21,631 --> 00:35:24,334
Building artificial islands in the sea,
for example.

341
00:35:27,937 --> 00:35:30,840
Dubai has few natural resources,

342
00:35:31,641 --> 00:35:35,845
but with oil money it can bring in
millions of tons of material

343
00:35:36,346 --> 00:35:39,248
and workers from all over the planet.

344
00:35:40,149 --> 00:35:42,852
Dubai has no farmland,
but it can import food.

345
00:35:45,655 --> 00:35:50,559
Dubai has no water, but it can afford
to expend immense amounts of energy

346
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:55,464
to desalinate seawater and build
the world's highest skyscrapers.

347
00:35:55,664 --> 00:36:00,169
Dubai has endless sun,
but no solar panels.

348
00:36:00,469 --> 00:36:06,675
It is the totem to total modernity
that never fails to amaze the world.

349
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:22,390
Dubai is like the new beacon
for all the world's money.

350
00:36:30,498 --> 00:36:33,601
Nothing seems further removed
from nature than Dubai,

351
00:36:33,701 --> 00:36:37,705
although nothing depends on nature
more than Dubai.

352
00:36:37,805 --> 00:36:41,809
Dubai is a sort of culmination
of the Western model.

353
00:36:42,009 --> 00:36:47,114
We haven't understood that
we're depleting what nature provides.

354
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,785
Since 1950, fishing catches
have increased fivefold

355
00:37:59,885 --> 00:38:04,289
from 18 to 100 million metric tons
a year.

356
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:08,894
Thousands of factory ships
are emptying the oceans.

357
00:38:09,294 --> 00:38:12,097
Three-quarters of fishing grounds
are exhausted,

358
00:38:12,297 --> 00:38:15,901
depleted or in danger of being so.

359
00:38:16,201 --> 00:38:19,104
Most large fish have been fished
out of existence

360
00:38:19,304 --> 00:38:22,507
since they have no time to reproduce.

361
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:39,624
We are destroying the cycle of a life
that was given to us.

362
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:02,346
At the current rate, all fish stocks
are threatened with exhaustion.

363
00:39:03,547 --> 00:39:08,452
Fish is the staple diet
of one in five humans.

364
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:28,672
We have forgotten
that resources are scarce.

365
00:39:29,472 --> 00:39:33,176
500 million humans
live in the world's desert lands,

366
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:36,379
more than the combined population
of Europe.

367
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,281
They know the value of water.

368
00:39:39,282 --> 00:39:41,684
They know how to use it sparingly.

369
00:39:42,185 --> 00:39:46,189
Here, they depend on wells
replenished by fossil water,

370
00:39:46,389 --> 00:39:50,893
which accumulated underground
back when it rained on these deserts.

371
00:39:50,993 --> 00:39:53,696
25,000 years ago.

372
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,503
Fossil water also enables crops
to be grown in the desert

373
00:40:01,603 --> 00:40:04,506
to provide food for local populations.

374
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:07,009
The fields' circular shape derives

375
00:40:07,209 --> 00:40:11,013
from the pipes that irrigate them
around a central pivot.

376
00:40:12,314 --> 00:40:13,315
But there is a heavy price to pay.

377
00:40:15,016 --> 00:40:18,320
Fossil water
is a non-renewable resource.

378
00:40:30,532 --> 00:40:31,833
In Saudi Arabia,

379
00:40:32,033 --> 00:40:35,937
the dream of industrial farming
in the desert has faded.

380
00:40:36,938 --> 00:40:38,840
As if on a parchment map,

381
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,344
the light spots on this patchwork
show abandoned plots.

382
00:40:43,544 --> 00:40:45,947
The irrigation equipment
is still there.

383
00:40:46,047 --> 00:40:48,749
The energy to pump water also.

384
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:52,953
But the fossil water reserves
are severely depleted.

385
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:03,964
Israel turned the desert
into arable land.

386
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:12,773
Even though these hothouses
are now irrigated drop by drop,

387
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:17,277
water consumption continues
to increase along with exports.

388
00:41:22,682 --> 00:41:26,286
The once mighty River Jordan
is now just a trickle.

389
00:41:26,486 --> 00:41:29,789
Its water has flown to supermarkets
all over the world

390
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:32,392
in crates of fruit and vegetables.

391
00:41:48,407 --> 00:41:51,010
The Jordan's fate is not unique.

392
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:54,913
Across the planet,
one major river in ten

393
00:41:55,114 --> 00:41:58,917
no longer flows into the sea
for several months of the year.

394
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:11,329
Deprived of the Jordan's water,

395
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:16,334
the level of the Dead Sea goes down
by over one meter per year.

396
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:42,760
India risks being the country
that suffers most

397
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,663
from lack of water
in the coming century.

398
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:49,066
Massive irrigation
has fed the growing population

399
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:55,172
and in the last 50 years,
21 million wells have been dug.

400
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,274
In many parts of the country,

401
00:42:57,474 --> 00:43:01,078
the drill has to sink every deeper
to hit water.

402
00:43:01,778 --> 00:43:06,883
In western India,
30% of wells have been abandoned.

403
00:43:07,684 --> 00:43:11,288
The underground aquifers
are drying out.

404
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:19,696
Vast reservoirs will catch monsoon rains
to replenish the aquifers.

405
00:43:22,498 --> 00:43:27,503
In the dry season, local village women
dig them with their bare hands.

406
00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:48,724
Thousands of kilometers away,

407
00:43:48,901 --> 00:43:51,604
800 to 1,000 liters of water
are consumed

408
00:43:51,704 --> 00:43:54,106
per person per day.

409
00:43:54,306 --> 00:43:57,509
Las Vegas was built out of the desert.

410
00:43:57,609 --> 00:43:59,911
Millions of people live there.

411
00:44:00,112 --> 00:44:02,614
Thousands more arrive every month.

412
00:44:02,814 --> 00:44:07,318
Its inhabitants are among the biggest
water consumers in the world.

413
00:44:18,728 --> 00:44:22,432
Palm Springs is another desert city
with tropical vegetation

414
00:44:22,632 --> 00:44:24,534
and lush golf courses.

415
00:44:27,736 --> 00:44:31,440
How long can this mirage
continue to prosper?

416
00:44:35,443 --> 00:44:38,246
The Earth cannot keep up.

417
00:44:39,147 --> 00:44:42,350
The Colorado River,
which brings water to these cities,

418
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:45,552
is one of those rivers
that no longer reaches the sea.

419
00:44:47,154 --> 00:44:52,258
Water levels in the catchment lakes
along its course are plummeting.

420
00:45:03,669 --> 00:45:09,574
Water shortages could affect nearly
2 billion people before 2025.

421
00:45:36,198 --> 00:45:40,502
The wetlands represent
6% of the surface of the planet.

422
00:45:41,002 --> 00:45:44,305
Under their calm waters
lies a veritable factory,

423
00:45:44,405 --> 00:45:48,409
where plants and micro-organisms
patiently filter the water

424
00:45:48,609 --> 00:45:51,011
and digest all the pollution.

425
00:45:52,012 --> 00:45:56,016
These marshes are indispensable
environments for the regeneration

426
00:45:56,216 --> 00:45:58,718
and purification of water.

427
00:45:58,918 --> 00:46:02,822
They are sponges
that regulate the flow of water.

428
00:46:03,022 --> 00:46:04,023
They absorb it in the wet season

429
00:46:05,024 --> 00:46:07,526
and release it in the dry season.

430
00:46:37,353 --> 00:46:39,655
In our race to conquer more land,

431
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:43,258
we have reclaimed them
as pasture for livestock,

432
00:46:43,558 --> 00:46:46,861
or as land for agriculture or building.

433
00:46:48,663 --> 00:46:53,167
In the last century,
half the world's marshes were drained.

434
00:46:53,467 --> 00:46:57,671
We know neither their richness
nor their role.

435
00:47:03,376 --> 00:47:05,878
All living matter is linked.

436
00:47:06,078 --> 00:47:10,883
Water, air, soil, trees.

437
00:47:10,983 --> 00:47:15,687
The world's magic
is right in front of our eyes.

438
00:47:26,196 --> 00:47:30,700
Trees breathe groundwater
into the atmosphere as light mist.

439
00:47:30,801 --> 00:47:35,104
They form a canopy that alleviates
the impact of heavy rains.

440
00:47:35,305 --> 00:47:39,508
The forests provide the humidity
that is necessary for life.

441
00:47:42,111 --> 00:47:43,612
They store carbon,

442
00:47:43,812 --> 00:47:47,215
containing more
than all the Earth's atmosphere.

443
00:47:48,016 --> 00:47:53,821
They are the cornerstone of the climatic
balance on which we all depend.

444
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:05,131
The primary forests provide a habitat

445
00:48:05,331 --> 00:48:08,434
for three-quarters
of the planet's biodiversity,

446
00:48:08,835 --> 00:48:12,438
that is to say,
of all life on Earth.

447
00:48:21,446 --> 00:48:24,949
These forests provide the remedies
that cure us.

448
00:48:25,149 --> 00:48:30,154
The substances secreted by these plants
can be recognized by our bodies.

449
00:48:30,354 --> 00:48:33,056
Our cells talk the same language.

450
00:48:33,256 --> 00:48:36,159
We are of the same family.

451
00:48:54,676 --> 00:48:57,778
But in barely 40 years,
the world's largest rainforest,

452
00:48:58,579 --> 00:49:02,883
the Amazon,
has been reduced by 20%.

453
00:49:15,294 --> 00:49:19,198
The forest gives way to cattle ranches
or soybean farms.

454
00:49:19,398 --> 00:49:23,802
95% of these soybeans are used
to feed livestock and poultry

455
00:49:23,902 --> 00:49:25,703
in Europe and Asia.

456
00:49:25,904 --> 00:49:29,006
And so, a forest is turned into meat.

457
00:49:40,817 --> 00:49:44,320
Barely 20 years ago, Borneo,
the 4th largest island

458
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,524
in the world,
was covered by a vast primary forest.

459
00:49:48,624 --> 00:49:51,026
At the current rate of deforestation,

460
00:49:51,126 --> 00:49:54,429
it will have disappeared
within 10 years.

461
00:50:00,335 --> 00:50:04,138
Living matter
bonds water, air, earth and the sun.

462
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:08,842
In Borneo, this bond has been broken

463
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:13,747
in what was one of the Earth's
greatest reservoirs of biodiversity.

464
00:50:23,455 --> 00:50:27,359
This catastrophe was provoked
by the decision to produce palm oil,

465
00:50:27,459 --> 00:50:32,163
one of the most productive and consumed
oils in the world, on Borneo.

466
00:50:32,764 --> 00:50:36,867
Palm oil not only caters
to our growing demand for food,

467
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:42,372
but also cosmetics, detergents
and, increasingly, alternative fuels.

468
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:47,277
The forest's diversity was replaced
by a single species, the oil palm.

469
00:50:47,317 --> 00:50:50,780
For local people,
it provides employment.

470
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,883
It's an agricultural industry.

471
00:50:57,986 --> 00:51:01,990
Another example of massive deforestation
is the eucalyptus.

472
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:04,992
Eucalyptus is used to make paper pulp.

473
00:51:05,093 --> 00:51:08,396
Plantations are growing
as demand for paper has increased

474
00:51:08,596 --> 00:51:10,998
fivefold in 50 years.

475
00:51:11,298 --> 00:51:14,801
One forest
does not replace another forest.

476
00:51:15,202 --> 00:51:17,203
At the foot of these eucalyptus trees,

477
00:51:17,404 --> 00:51:22,608
nothing grows because their leaves form
a toxic bed for most other plants.

478
00:51:25,711 --> 00:51:29,715
They grow quickly,
but exhaust water reserves.

479
00:51:31,516 --> 00:51:33,818
Soybeans, palm oil,

480
00:51:34,018 --> 00:51:35,320
eucalyptus trees...

481
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:41,225
Deforestation destroys the essential
to produce the superfluous.

482
00:51:41,425 --> 00:51:42,726
But elsewhere,

483
00:51:43,027 --> 00:51:46,530
deforestation is a last resort
to survive.

484
00:51:55,438 --> 00:51:57,239
Over 2 billion people,

485
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,542
almost one third
of the world's population,

486
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:03,545
still depend on charcoal.

487
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,447
In Haiti,

488
00:52:05,647 --> 00:52:07,949
one of the world's poorest countries,

489
00:52:08,049 --> 00:52:11,652
charcoal is one of the population's
main consumables.

490
00:52:13,554 --> 00:52:16,056
Once the "pearl of the Caribbean",

491
00:52:16,156 --> 00:52:20,760
Haiti can no longer feed
its population without foreign aid.

492
00:52:24,764 --> 00:52:29,268
On the hills of Haiti,
only 2% of the forests are left.

493
00:52:30,769 --> 00:52:32,571
Stripped bare,

494
00:52:32,771 --> 00:52:34,573
nothing holds the soils back.

495
00:52:35,173 --> 00:52:39,177
The rainwater washes them
down the hillsides as far as the sea.

496
00:52:39,277 --> 00:52:43,180
What's left is increasingly
unsuitable for agriculture.

497
00:52:50,687 --> 00:52:55,091
In some parts of Madagascar,
the erosion is spectacular.

498
00:52:55,492 --> 00:53:00,096
Whole hillsides bear deep gashes
hundreds of meters wide.

499
00:53:00,696 --> 00:53:04,500
Thin and fragile,
soil is made by living matter.

500
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,803
With erosion,
the fine layer of humus,

501
00:53:08,003 --> 00:53:11,906
which took thousands of years to form,
disappears.

502
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:41,933
Here's one theory of the story
of the Rapanui,

503
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:44,135
the inhabitants of Easter Island,

504
00:53:44,235 --> 00:53:46,938
that could perhaps
give us pause for thought.

505
00:53:47,438 --> 00:53:50,541
Living on the most isolated island
in the world,

506
00:53:50,641 --> 00:53:55,145
the Rapanui exploited their resources
until there was nothing left.

507
00:53:55,645 --> 00:53:58,448
Their civilization did not survive.

508
00:53:58,488 --> 00:54:03,152
On these lands stood
the highest palm trees in the world.

509
00:54:03,352 --> 00:54:05,154
They have disappeared.

510
00:54:05,254 --> 00:54:08,257
The Rapanui
chopped them all down for lumber.

511
00:54:08,357 --> 00:54:10,659
They then faced
widespread soil erosion.

512
00:54:13,762 --> 00:54:18,966
The Rapanui could no longer go fishing.
There were no trees to build canoes.

513
00:54:24,571 --> 00:54:29,376
Yet the Rapanui formed one of the most
brilliant civilizations in the Pacific.

514
00:54:29,576 --> 00:54:33,479
Innovative farmers, sculptors,
exceptional navigators,

515
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:38,184
they were caught in the vise of
overpopulation and dwindling resources.

516
00:54:39,184 --> 00:54:43,688
They experienced social unrest,
revolts and famine.

517
00:54:43,789 --> 00:54:47,192
Many did not survive the cataclysm.

518
00:55:06,409 --> 00:55:11,413
The real mystery of Easter Island is not
how its strange statues got there,

519
00:55:11,614 --> 00:55:12,915
we know now.

520
00:55:13,115 --> 00:55:16,518
It is why the Rapanui
didn't react in time.

521
00:55:24,225 --> 00:55:29,730
It's only one of a number of theories,
but it has particular relevance today.

522
00:55:47,646 --> 00:55:52,650
Since 1950, the world's population
has almost tripled.

523
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,352
And since 1950,

524
00:55:54,452 --> 00:55:58,155
we have more fundamentally
altered our island, the Earth,

525
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:02,659
than in all
of our 200,000-year history.

526
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:06,563
Nigeria is the biggest oil exporter
in Africa,

527
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:11,467
yet 70% of the population
lives under the poverty line.

528
00:56:12,468 --> 00:56:17,573
The wealth is there, but the country's
inhabitants don't have access to it.

529
00:56:17,773 --> 00:56:20,075
The same is true all over the globe.

530
00:56:20,275 --> 00:56:24,679
Half the world's poor
live in resource-rich countries.

531
00:56:28,983 --> 00:56:33,187
Our mode of development
has not fulfilled its promises.

532
00:56:33,287 --> 00:56:39,192
In 50 years, the gap between rich
and poor has grown wider than ever.

533
00:56:39,893 --> 00:56:40,894
Today,

534
00:56:40,994 --> 00:56:47,199
half the world's wealth is in the hands
of the richest 2% of the population.

535
00:56:53,605 --> 00:56:57,008
Can such disparities be maintained?

536
00:56:57,709 --> 00:57:00,211
They are the cause
of population movements

537
00:57:00,811 --> 00:57:03,714
whose scale we have yet
to fully realize.

538
00:57:04,214 --> 00:57:09,319
The city of Lagos
had a population of 700,000 in 1960.

539
00:57:10,019 --> 00:57:14,623
That will rise to 16 million by 2025.

540
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:18,927
Lagos is one of the fastest growing
megalopolises in the world.

541
00:57:19,127 --> 00:57:22,631
The new arrivals are mostly farmers
forced off the land

542
00:57:22,831 --> 00:57:27,635
for economic or demographic reasons,
or because of diminishing resources.

543
00:57:27,835 --> 00:57:30,738
This is a radically new type
of urban growth,

544
00:57:30,038 --> 00:57:34,342
driven by the urge to survive
rather than to prosper.

545
00:57:39,547 --> 00:57:45,352
Every week, over a million people swell
the populations of the world's cities.

546
00:57:50,556 --> 00:57:56,362
1 human in 6 now lives in a precarious,
unhealthy, overpopulated environment

547
00:57:56,562 --> 00:58:02,367
without access to daily necessities,
such as water, sanitation, electricity.

548
00:58:37,698 --> 00:58:39,700
Hunger is spreading once more.

549
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:43,103
It affects nearly 1 billion people.

550
00:59:15,032 --> 00:59:19,836
All over the planet, the poorest
scrabble to survive, while we continue

551
00:59:20,036 --> 00:59:23,739
to dig for resources
that we can no longer live without.

552
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:26,142
We look farther and farther afield

553
00:59:26,242 --> 00:59:28,644
in previously unspoilt territory

554
00:59:28,844 --> 00:59:33,148
and in regions that are
increasingly difficult to exploit.

555
00:59:39,754 --> 00:59:41,956
We're not changing our model.

556
00:59:42,957 --> 00:59:45,159
Oil might run out?

557
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:49,162
We can still extract oil
from the tar sands of Canada.

558
00:59:49,362 --> 00:59:54,167
The biggest trucks in the world
move thousands of tons of sand.

559
00:59:54,467 --> 00:59:57,870
The process of heating
and separating bitumen from the sand

560
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:01,273
requires millions
of cubic meters of water.

561
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:03,875
Colossal amounts of energy are needed.

562
01:00:03,976 --> 01:00:06,678
The pollution is catastrophic.

563
01:00:06,878 --> 01:00:09,180
The most urgent priority, apparently,

564
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:12,884
is to pick every pocket of sunlight.

565
01:00:46,013 --> 01:00:48,816
Our oil tankers
are getting bigger and bigger.

566
01:00:49,016 --> 01:00:52,219
Our energy requirements
are constantly increasing.

567
01:00:52,419 --> 01:00:54,821
We try to power growth
like a bottomless oven

568
01:00:54,861 --> 01:00:59,025
that demands more and more fuel.

569
01:01:14,939 --> 01:01:16,641
It's all about carbon.

570
01:01:15,941 --> 01:01:19,944
In a few decades, the carbon
that made our atmosphere a furnace

571
01:01:20,145 --> 01:01:25,149
and that nature captured over millions
of years, allowing life to develop,

572
01:01:25,249 --> 01:01:27,852
will have largely been pumped back out.

573
01:01:28,052 --> 01:01:31,355
The atmosphere is heating up.

574
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:36,359
It would have been inconceivable for
a boat to be here just a few years ago.

575
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:41,464
Transport, industry,
deforestation, agriculture...

576
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:45,968
Our activities release gigantic
quantities of carbon dioxide.

577
01:01:46,668 --> 01:01:50,172
Without realizing it,
molecule by molecule,

578
01:01:50,272 --> 01:01:53,775
we have upset
the Earth's climatic balance.

579
01:01:57,278 --> 01:02:00,180
All eyes are on the poles,

580
01:02:01,081 --> 01:02:04,685
where the effects of global warming
are most visible.

581
01:02:06,086 --> 01:02:08,388
It's happening fast, very fast.

582
01:02:08,988 --> 01:02:13,993
The north-west passage that connects
America, Europe and Asia via the pole,

583
01:02:14,193 --> 01:02:15,594
is opening up.

584
01:02:16,195 --> 01:02:18,697
The arctic ice cap is melting.

585
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,501
Under the effect of global warming,

586
01:02:23,702 --> 01:02:28,706
the ice cap has lost
40% of its thickness in 40 years.

587
01:02:28,906 --> 01:02:33,610
Its surface area in the summer
shrinks year by year.

588
01:02:34,511 --> 01:02:38,114
It could disappear
in the summer months by 2030.

589
01:02:38,315 --> 01:02:40,917
Some say 2015.

590
01:02:52,728 --> 01:02:56,231
The sunbeams that the ice sheet
previously reflected back

591
01:02:56,331 --> 01:02:59,834
now penetrate the dark water,
heating it up.

592
01:03:00,034 --> 01:03:03,237
The warming process gathers pace.

593
01:03:11,845 --> 01:03:15,248
This ice contains the records
of our planet.

594
01:03:15,448 --> 01:03:18,951
The concentration of carbon dioxide
hasn't been so high

595
01:03:19,151 --> 01:03:21,854
for several hundred thousand years.

596
01:03:23,655 --> 01:03:27,058
Humanity has never lived
in an atmosphere like this.

597
01:03:39,469 --> 01:03:44,774
Is excessive exploitation of resources
threatening the lives of every species?

598
01:03:45,275 --> 01:03:46,776
Climate change

599
01:03:46,876 --> 01:03:48,478
accentuates the threat.

600
01:03:48,678 --> 01:03:52,381
By 2050,
a quarter of the Earth's species

601
01:03:52,481 --> 01:03:55,083
could be threatened with extinction.

602
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:57,486
In these polar regions,

603
01:03:57,686 --> 01:04:01,189
the balance of nature
has already been disrupted.

604
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:37,776
Around the North Pole,

605
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:43,381
the ice cap has lost 30%
of its surface area in 30 years.

606
01:05:44,782 --> 01:05:47,084
But as Greenland
rapidly becomes warmer,

607
01:05:47,284 --> 01:05:52,689
the freshwater of a whole continent
flows into the salt water of the oceans.

608
01:06:04,399 --> 01:06:09,804
Greenland's ice contains 20%
of the freshwater of the whole planet.

609
01:06:10,805 --> 01:06:15,710
If it melts,
sea levels will rise by nearly 7 meters.

610
01:06:30,923 --> 01:06:33,826
But there is no industry here.

611
01:06:34,626 --> 01:06:37,529
Greenland's ice sheet suffers
from greenhouse gases

612
01:06:37,629 --> 01:06:39,831
emitted elsewhere on Earth.

613
01:06:43,034 --> 01:06:46,337
Our ecosystem doesn't have borders.

614
01:06:46,437 --> 01:06:47,738
Wherever we are,

615
01:06:47,938 --> 01:06:51,341
our actions have repercussions
on the whole Earth.

616
01:06:51,442 --> 01:06:55,545
Our planet's atmosphere
is an indivisible whole.

617
01:06:55,645 --> 01:06:58,748
It is an asset we share.

618
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:04,954
In Greenland,
lakes are appearing on the landscape.

619
01:07:05,854 --> 01:07:10,358
The ice cap is melting at a speed
even the most pessimistic scientists

620
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:13,661
did not envision 10 years ago.

621
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:26,373
More and more of these glacier-fed
rivers are merging together

622
01:07:26,473 --> 01:07:28,875
and burrowing though the surface.

623
01:07:29,275 --> 01:07:33,179
It was thought the water would freeze
in the depths of the ice.

624
01:07:33,379 --> 01:07:36,182
On the contrary,
it flows under the ice,

625
01:07:36,382 --> 01:07:41,186
carrying the ice sheet into the sea,
where it breaks into icebergs.

626
01:08:26,927 --> 01:08:29,529
As the freshwater
of Greenland's ice sheet

627
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:32,232
seeps into the salt water of the oceans,

628
01:08:32,432 --> 01:08:36,035
low-lying lands around the globe
are threatened.

629
01:08:39,338 --> 01:08:41,340
Sea levels are rising.

630
01:08:42,341 --> 01:08:44,843
Water expanding as it gets warmer

631
01:08:45,043 --> 01:08:46,345
caused, in the 20th century alone,

632
01:08:47,345 --> 01:08:49,748
a rise of 20 centimeters.

633
01:08:50,248 --> 01:08:53,351
Everything becomes unstable.

634
01:08:53,551 --> 01:08:58,255
Coral reefs are extremely sensitive
to the slightest change

635
01:08:58,455 --> 01:09:01,358
in water temperature.
30% have disappeared.

636
01:09:01,398 --> 01:09:06,463
They are an essential link
in the chain of species.

637
01:09:10,566 --> 01:09:14,970
In the atmosphere, major wind streams
are changing direction.

638
01:09:15,971 --> 01:09:18,774
Rain cycles are altered.

639
01:09:18,974 --> 01:09:21,376
The geography of climates is modified.

640
01:09:22,377 --> 01:09:24,979
The inhabitants of low-lying islands,

641
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:28,382
here in the Maldives, for example,
are on the front line.

642
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:31,585
They are increasingly concerned.

643
01:09:31,685 --> 01:09:35,589
Some are already looking for new,
more hospitable lands.

644
01:09:41,294 --> 01:09:44,997
If sea levels continue to rise
faster and faster,

645
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:49,801
what will major cities like Tokyo,
the world's most populous city, do?

646
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:55,406
Every year, scientists' predictions
become more alarming.

647
01:09:57,408 --> 01:10:02,613
70% of the world's population
lives on coastal plains.

648
01:10:02,813 --> 01:10:05,415
11 of the 15 biggest cities

649
01:10:05,616 --> 01:10:09,019
stand on a coastline or river estuary.

650
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:13,423
As the seas rise,
salt will invade the water table,

651
01:10:13,623 --> 01:10:16,425
depriving inhabitants
of drinking water.

652
01:10:16,465 --> 01:10:20,028
Migratory phenomena are inevitable.

653
01:10:20,229 --> 01:10:23,632
The only uncertainty
concerns their scale.

654
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,963
In Africa,
Mount Kilimanjaro is unrecognizable.

655
01:10:59,564 --> 01:11:01,466
80% of its glaciers have disappeared.

656
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:05,569
In summer,
the rivers no longer flow.

657
01:11:05,769 --> 01:11:09,173
Local peoples are affected
by the lack of water.

658
01:11:09,873 --> 01:11:14,477
Even on the world's highest peaks,
in the heart of the Himalayas,

659
01:11:14,677 --> 01:11:17,980
eternal snows and glaciers
are receding.

660
01:11:19,982 --> 01:11:23,886
Yet these glaciers play
an essential role in the water cycle.

661
01:11:24,286 --> 01:11:27,289
They trap the water
from the monsoons as ice

662
01:11:27,489 --> 01:11:30,592
and release it in the summer
when the snows melt.

663
01:11:43,703 --> 01:11:47,907
The Himalayan glaciers are the source
of all the great Asian rivers,

664
01:11:48,107 --> 01:11:51,911
the Indus, Ganges,
Mekong, Yangtze Kiang...

665
01:11:52,912 --> 01:11:57,015
2 billion people depend on them
for drinking water

666
01:11:57,216 --> 01:12:01,019
and to irrigate their crops,
as in Bangladesh.

667
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:05,223
On the delta
of the Ganges and Brahmaputra,

668
01:12:05,423 --> 01:12:09,927
Bangladesh is directly affected
by phenomena occurring in the Himalayas

669
01:12:10,127 --> 01:12:11,328
and at sea level.

670
01:12:11,829 --> 01:12:15,932
This is one of the most populous
and poorest countries in the world.

671
01:12:16,133 --> 01:12:18,935
It is already hit by global warming.

672
01:12:19,235 --> 01:12:23,639
The combined impact of increasingly
dramatic floods and hurricanes

673
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:27,242
could make
a third of its land mass disappear.

674
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:30,545
When populations are subjected
to these devastating phenomena,

675
01:12:31,546 --> 01:12:34,149
they eventually move away.

676
01:12:39,854 --> 01:12:42,356
Wealthy countries will not be spared.

677
01:12:42,556 --> 01:12:45,259
Droughts are occurring
all over the planet.

678
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:49,863
In Australia,
half of farmland is already affected.

679
01:13:01,173 --> 01:13:05,377
We are in the process of compromising
the climatic balance

680
01:13:05,577 --> 01:13:09,881
that has allowed us to develop
over 12,000 years.

681
01:13:16,988 --> 01:13:22,092
More and more wildfires
encroach on major cities.

682
01:13:23,193 --> 01:13:26,596
In turn,
they exacerbate global warming.

683
01:13:26,796 --> 01:13:29,599
As the trees burn,
they release carbon dioxide.

684
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:35,905
The system that controls our climate
has been severely disrupted.

685
01:13:36,105 --> 01:13:40,208
The elements on which it relies
have been disrupted.

686
01:14:11,336 --> 01:14:16,241
The clock of climate change is ticking
in these magnificent landscapes.

687
01:14:16,741 --> 01:14:20,244
Here in Siberia,
and elsewhere across the globe,

688
01:14:20,344 --> 01:14:23,948
it is so cold
that the ground is constantly frozen.

689
01:14:24,048 --> 01:14:27,851
It's known as permafrost.

690
01:14:27,951 --> 01:14:32,055
Under its surface
lies a climatic time-bomb.

691
01:14:32,255 --> 01:14:33,556
Methane,

692
01:14:33,756 --> 01:14:38,361
a greenhouse gas 20 times
more powerful than carbon dioxide.

693
01:14:53,374 --> 01:14:55,076
If the permafrost melts,

694
01:14:55,276 --> 01:14:58,579
the methane releases would cause
the greenhouse effect

695
01:14:58,779 --> 01:15:02,983
to race out of control
with consequences no one can predict.

696
01:15:08,387 --> 01:15:12,992
We would literally
be in unknown territory.

697
01:15:20,598 --> 01:15:24,602
Humanity has no more than 10 years
to reverse the trend

698
01:15:24,802 --> 01:15:27,805
and avoid
crossing into this territory...

699
01:15:28,505 --> 01:15:31,508
Life on Earth
as we have never known it.

700
01:15:59,133 --> 01:16:03,537
We have created phenomena
we cannot control.

701
01:16:03,737 --> 01:16:05,038
Since our origins,

702
01:16:05,238 --> 01:16:09,843
water, air and forms of life
are intimately linked.

703
01:16:11,944 --> 01:16:15,548
But recently
we have broken those links.

704
01:16:17,049 --> 01:16:18,150
Let's face the facts.

705
01:16:18,190 --> 01:16:21,453
We must believe what we know.

706
01:16:24,356 --> 01:16:28,759
All we have just seen is a reflection
of human behavior.

707
01:16:30,261 --> 01:16:33,564
We have shaped the Earth in our image.

708
01:16:34,064 --> 01:16:36,767
We have very little time to change.

709
01:16:37,367 --> 01:16:41,971
How can this century carry the burden
of 9 billion human beings

710
01:16:42,071 --> 01:16:44,774
if we refuse to be called to account

711
01:16:44,874 --> 01:16:48,077
for everything we alone have done?

712
01:16:55,483 --> 01:17:01,088
20% of the world's population
consumes 80% of its resources

713
01:17:20,806 --> 01:17:24,209
The world spends
12 times more on military expenditures

714
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:27,913
than on aid to developing countries

715
01:17:40,824 --> 01:17:45,128
5,000 people a day die
because of dirty drinking water

716
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:49,732
1 billion people
have no access to safe drinking water

717
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:05,446
Nearly 1 billion people are going hungry

718
01:18:19,759 --> 01:18:24,763
Over 50% of grain
traded around the world

719
01:18:24,964 --> 01:18:29,267
is used for animal feed or biofuels

720
01:18:42,279 --> 01:18:47,284
40% of arable land
has suffered long-term damage

721
01:19:00,195 --> 01:19:04,699
Every year,
13 million hectares of forest disappear

722
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:22,515
1 mammal in 4, 1 bird in 8, 1 amphibian
in 3 are threatened with extinction

723
01:19:22,615 --> 01:19:28,020
Species are dying out at a rhythm
1,000 times faster than the natural rate

724
01:19:37,829 --> 01:19:42,233
Three quarters of fishing grounds
are exhausted,

725
01:19:42,433 --> 01:19:45,135
depleted or in dangerous decline

726
01:19:55,044 --> 01:19:58,347
The average temperature
of the last 15 years

727
01:19:58,548 --> 01:20:00,950
has been the highest ever recorded

728
01:20:15,563 --> 01:20:20,968
The ice cap is 40% thinner
than 40 years ago

729
01:20:32,378 --> 01:20:41,286
There may be at least 200 million
climate refugees by 2050

730
01:20:48,993 --> 01:20:50,394
The cost of our actions is high.

731
01:20:50,434 --> 01:20:54,798
Others pay the price
without having been actively involved.

732
01:20:55,198 --> 01:20:57,200
I have seen refugee camps

733
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:00,303
as big as cities,
sprawling in the desert.

734
01:21:00,903 --> 01:21:03,105
How many men,
women and children

735
01:21:03,306 --> 01:21:05,407
will be left by the wayside tomorrow?

736
01:21:06,308 --> 01:21:10,212
Must we always build walls
to break the chain of human solidarity,

737
01:21:10,312 --> 01:21:11,613
separate peoples

738
01:21:11,813 --> 01:21:15,516
and protect the happiness of some
from others' misery?

739
01:21:15,617 --> 01:21:17,418
It's too late to be a pessimist.

740
01:21:18,119 --> 01:21:21,722
I know that a single human
can knock down every wall.

741
01:21:21,922 --> 01:21:23,824
It's too late to be a pessimist.

742
01:21:23,924 --> 01:21:27,427
Worldwide,
4 children out of 5 attend school.

743
01:21:27,627 --> 01:21:30,730
Never has learning been given
to so many human beings.

744
01:21:30,830 --> 01:21:34,534
Everyone, from richest to poorest,
can make a contribution.

745
01:21:34,734 --> 01:21:37,236
Lesotho,
one of the world's poorest countries,

746
01:21:37,336 --> 01:21:41,840
is proportionally the one that invests
most in its people's education.

747
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:46,945
Qatar, one of the richest states,
has opened up to the best universities.

748
01:21:47,145 --> 01:21:49,447
Culture, education,
research and innovation

749
01:21:49,487 --> 01:21:52,550
are inexhaustible resources.

750
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:54,451
In the face of misery and suffering,

751
01:21:54,652 --> 01:21:57,854
millions of NGOs prove that solidarity

752
01:21:57,955 --> 01:22:01,458
between peoples is stronger
than the selfishness of nations.

753
01:22:01,498 --> 01:22:04,961
In Bangladesh,
a man thought the unthinkable

754
01:22:05,161 --> 01:22:07,763
and founded a bank
that lends only to the poor.

755
01:22:07,964 --> 01:22:13,068
In 30 years, it has changed
the lives of 150 million people.

756
01:22:13,168 --> 01:22:16,972
Antarctica is a continent
with immense natural resources

757
01:22:17,172 --> 01:22:19,474
that no country can claim for itself,

758
01:22:19,674 --> 01:22:23,277
a natural reserve
devoted to peace and science.

759
01:22:23,477 --> 01:22:25,779
A treaty signed by 49 states

760
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:28,882
has made it a treasure
shared by all humanity.

761
01:22:28,982 --> 01:22:30,984
It's too late to be a pessimist.

762
01:22:31,184 --> 01:22:35,688
Governments have acted to protect
nearly 2% of territorial waters.

763
01:22:35,889 --> 01:22:39,492
It's not much but it's 2 times more
than 10 years ago.

764
01:22:39,692 --> 01:22:43,295
The first natural parks were created
just over a century ago.

765
01:22:43,395 --> 01:22:46,598
They cover over 13% of the continents.

766
01:22:46,798 --> 01:22:48,700
They create spaces
where human activity

767
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:53,404
is in step with the preservation
of species, soils and landscapes.

768
01:22:53,604 --> 01:22:57,508
This harmony between humans and nature
can become the rule,

769
01:22:57,708 --> 01:22:59,410
no longer the exception.

770
01:22:59,610 --> 01:23:03,413
In the US, New York has realized
what nature does for us.

771
01:23:03,613 --> 01:23:06,916
These forests and lakes
supply all the city's drinking water.

772
01:23:08,117 --> 01:23:12,121
In South Korea,
the forests had been devastated by war.

773
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:14,924
Thanks to
a national reforestation program,

774
01:23:15,124 --> 01:23:18,226
they once more cover
65% of the country.

775
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:21,730
More than 75% of paper is recycled.

776
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:26,034
Costa Rica has made a choice between
military spending and land conservation.

777
01:23:26,074 --> 01:23:28,536
The country no longer has an army.

778
01:23:28,736 --> 01:23:32,340
It prefers to devote its resources
to education, ecotourism

779
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:35,042
and the protection
of its primary forest.

780
01:23:35,242 --> 01:23:38,345
Gabon is one of the world's
leading producers of wood.

781
01:23:38,445 --> 01:23:43,249
It enforces selective logging.
Not more than 1 tree every hectare.

782
01:23:43,349 --> 01:23:46,953
Its forests are one of the country's
most important resources,

783
01:23:47,153 --> 01:23:49,555
but they have time to regenerate.

784
01:23:49,755 --> 01:23:53,459
Programs exist that guarantee
sustainable forest management.

785
01:23:53,659 --> 01:23:55,660
They must become mandatory.

786
01:23:56,561 --> 01:24:00,565
For consumers and producers,
justice is an opportunity to be seized.

787
01:24:01,466 --> 01:24:04,969
When trade is fair,
when both buyer and seller benefit,

788
01:24:05,169 --> 01:24:08,772
everybody can prosper
and earn a decent living.

789
01:24:09,573 --> 01:24:11,775
How can there be justice and equity

790
01:24:11,975 --> 01:24:15,078
between people
whose only tools are their hands

791
01:24:15,278 --> 01:24:19,382
and those who harvest their crops
with a machine and state subsidies?

792
01:24:22,585 --> 01:24:25,387
Let's be responsible consumers.

793
01:24:25,487 --> 01:24:27,789
Think about what we buy!

794
01:24:31,192 --> 01:24:32,093
It's too late to be a pessimist.

795
01:24:33,594 --> 01:24:36,397
I have seen agriculture
on a human scale.

796
01:24:36,497 --> 01:24:38,099
It can feed the whole planet

797
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:42,903
if meat production doesn't take
the food out of people's mouths.

798
01:24:43,503 --> 01:24:46,706
I have seen fishermen
who take care what they catch

799
01:24:46,806 --> 01:24:49,409
and care for the riches of the ocean.

800
01:24:50,309 --> 01:24:52,111
I have seen houses
producing their own energy.

801
01:24:53,112 --> 01:24:55,414
5,000 people live in the world's

802
01:24:55,514 --> 01:24:59,017
first ever eco-friendly district
in Freiburg, Germany.

803
01:24:59,217 --> 01:25:01,319
Other cities partner the project.

804
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,222
Mumbai is the thousandth to join them.

805
01:25:04,522 --> 01:25:09,326
The governments of New Zealand, Iceland,
Austria, Sweden and other nations

806
01:25:09,527 --> 01:25:12,629
have made the development
of renewable energy sources

807
01:25:12,830 --> 01:25:14,531
a top priority.

808
01:25:15,332 --> 01:25:20,537
80% of the energy we consume
comes from fossil energy sources.

809
01:25:20,737 --> 01:25:21,537
Every week,

810
01:25:21,738 --> 01:25:25,141
two new coal-fired generating plants
are built in China alone.

811
01:25:26,242 --> 01:25:30,445
But I have also seen, in Denmark,
a prototype of a coal-fired plant

812
01:25:30,546 --> 01:25:34,349
that releases carbon into the soil
rather than the air.

813
01:25:34,449 --> 01:25:37,452
A solution for the future?
Nobody knows yet.

814
01:25:37,652 --> 01:25:39,554
I have seen, in Iceland,

815
01:25:39,754 --> 01:25:42,356
an electricity plant
powered by the Earth's heat.

816
01:25:42,556 --> 01:25:44,058
Geothermal power.

817
01:25:44,258 --> 01:25:46,160
I have seen a sea snake

818
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:49,462
lying on the swell
to absorb the energy of the waves

819
01:25:49,563 --> 01:25:51,564
and produce electricity.

820
01:25:52,365 --> 01:25:54,167
I have seen wind farms
off Denmark's coast

821
01:25:55,168 --> 01:25:58,471
that produce 20%
of the country's electricity.

822
01:25:58,571 --> 01:26:04,176
The USA, China, India, Germany
and Spain are the biggest investors

823
01:26:04,476 --> 01:26:05,177
in renewable energy.

824
01:26:06,177 --> 01:26:09,881
They have already created
over 2.5 million jobs.

825
01:26:10,381 --> 01:26:12,984
Where on earth
doesn't the wind blow?

826
01:26:14,085 --> 01:26:18,188
I have seen desert expanses
baking in the sun.

827
01:26:18,689 --> 01:26:21,091
Everything on Earth is linked,

828
01:26:21,291 --> 01:26:25,395
and the Earth is linked to the sun,
its original energy source.

829
01:26:25,595 --> 01:26:28,798
Can humans not imitate plants
and capture its energy?

830
01:26:29,498 --> 01:26:33,902
In one hour, the sun gives the Earth
the same amount of energy

831
01:26:34,102 --> 01:26:37,906
as that consumed
by all humanity in one year.

832
01:26:38,006 --> 01:26:42,610
As long as the Earth exists,
the sun's energy will be inexhaustible.

833
01:26:42,710 --> 01:26:43,711
All we have to do

834
01:26:43,911 --> 01:26:46,213
is stop drilling the Earth
and start looking to the sky.

835
01:26:47,214 --> 01:26:50,317
All we have to do
is learn to cultivate the sun.

836
01:26:50,517 --> 01:26:52,219
All these experiments
are only examples,

837
01:26:52,259 --> 01:26:55,422
but they testify to a new awareness.

838
01:26:55,522 --> 01:26:58,725
They lay down markers
for a new human adventure

839
01:26:58,925 --> 01:27:02,828
based on moderation,
intelligence and sharing.

840
01:27:18,242 --> 01:27:21,545
It's time to come together.

841
01:27:22,446 --> 01:27:24,247
What's important

842
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:26,249
is not what's gone,

843
01:27:26,449 --> 01:27:28,852
but what remains.

844
01:27:30,553 --> 01:27:33,556
We still have
half the world's forests,

845
01:27:33,656 --> 01:27:39,061
thousands of rivers, lakes and glaciers,
and thousands of thriving species.

846
01:27:42,364 --> 01:27:45,967
We know that the solutions
are there today.

847
01:27:46,968 --> 01:27:49,970
We all have the power to change.

848
01:27:51,672 --> 01:27:53,974
So what are we waiting for?
