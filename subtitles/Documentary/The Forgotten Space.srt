<i>do you know why people hate
to admit they're lonely?</i>

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,290
<i>it's because when you do,</i>

00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,130
<i>everyone thinks
something's wrong with you.</i>

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,990
<i>They think,"I have people in my life.</i>

5
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,950
<i>Why don't you?</i>

6
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,810
<i>" But the strange thing is,</i>

7
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,540
<i>you can have people in your
life and still be alone.</i>

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,360
<i>No one knows that better than I do.</i>

12
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,970
Jane doe.

13
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,310
She just collapsed?

14
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,890
In a local park.

15
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,700
We're thinking no foul play.

16
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,510
The M.E.  'S finishing the autopsy,but
we got a heads-up on the cause of death--

17
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,500
too much insulin in her system.

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,050
Was she diabetic?

19
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,200
Well,they found recurring
injection marks in her stomach.

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,810
Looks like an overdose.

21
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,380
Suicide.

22
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,920
Her problems got so bad,she
couldn't see any other way out.

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,070
Or an accident.

24
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,780
Hard to know why,but
maybe she didn't realize

25
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,860
she had already taken her shot.

26
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,870
Either way,our investigation's limited.

27
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,860
Department policy.  They won't assign more
manpower unless it's declared a homicide.

28
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,110
- Right. 
- We need your help giving her a name.

29
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,090
I understand.  We'll do
what we can to get her home.

30
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,810
She just died in the middle
of the park like that,

31
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,260
in front of a bunch strangers?

32
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,450
And she was young.

33
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,140
Those are always the hardest to take.

34
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,690
Probably mid-20s,based on the
photo and what she was wearing.

35
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,170
She had a purse with
her,but no wallet,no I.D.

36
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,840
What kind of woman carries
a purse with no wallet?

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,650
That's like a telephone repairman
not carrying his echo sensitizer.

38
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,030
Right.

39
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,170
And when she fell,her purse
spilled onto the grass.

40
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,930
If she had a wallet,it's
possible somebody

41
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,110
at the scene swiped it in all the chaos.

42
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,130
Wow.  Swiping a dying wan's
wallet.  Man,that's cold.

43
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,150
Whatever was in her
purse is at the princt.

44
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,900
Candace,lindsey,maybe you
guys could take a look.

45
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,970
There might be something in
there that helps us identify her.

46
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,370
What about the databases?

47
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,300
Police ran the prints and the D.N.A.

48
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,960
No criminal record,no missing
persons,but it's only been about 48 hours.

49
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,050
There's no wedding ring.

50
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,040
If she lived on her own,it might take
a few days before somebody reports her.

51
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,330
It might,but maybe we can
I.D.  Her a little sooner.

52
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,840
The police found this
in our jane doe's pocket.

53
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,450
Looks like a hotel key.

54
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,910
I don't think it's a hotel.

55
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,090
You're late.

56
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,760
Huh.  Did you miss me?

57
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,770
Most hotels put a name
or a logo on their cards.

58
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,370
But if it's blank like that,could
be a corporate apartment.

59
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,320
- Why corporate? 
- They change 'em out.

60
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,420
Companies keep apartments in town.

61
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,000
When a client comes
in,they print him off a key.

62
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,940
My dad's company does it a lot.

63
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,980
Couldn't the cops just
hack the strip on the back?

64
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,920
Yeah,but it's just an entry code.

65
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,080
There's no address.

66
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,320
So if you lose it,nobody
knows what it's for.

67
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,230
She was pretty well-dressed.

68
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,360
Maybe our jane doe was
in town for business.

69
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,380
If she was,maybe she
was staying in the area.

70
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,310
The police already checked two
the blocks around the scene.

71
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,980
I think we should expand it to ten.

72
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,170
Tyler,walter,you're with me.

73
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,820
Quality time,boys.

74
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,770
Nothing.  Any luck?

75
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,780
Six more blocks to go.

76
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,630
Swing and a miss.  Wrong building.

77
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,050
But the guy said he recognized the gold
card from a building a few blocks up.

78
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,070
It's called the gold standard.

79
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,010
Thanks so much.

80
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,900
Russell said the police took a look,but
they didn't see any contact info.

81
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,970
It still helps.

82
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,900
Just want to get to
know her a little bit.

83
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,210
I mean,a woman's purse is
like a time-space continuum--

84
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,000
next week's concert
tickets,last year's chewing gum.

85
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,730
Yeah.

86
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,580
It just feels strange
going through her stuff.

87
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,110
Okay,we got one lip gloss,coloR...

88
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,870
pink.

89
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,490
And that is not a high-fashion pink.

90
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,380
Now this-- this
is high-fashion.

91
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,800
- It's classic. 
- Yep.

92
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,290
The clasp is broken.

93
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,890
That's beautiful.

94
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,440
For a woman in her mid-20s,she
was obviously making good money.

95
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,630
Hey,here's something.

96
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,670
She didn't have a cell
phone,but she had a music player.

97
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,350
I don't see any names or addresses,

98
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,140
but there are some
friends' photos in there.

99
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,440
We should get those to alex.

100
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,550
You know what?  Maybe we can
get their names another way.

101
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,250
Thanks f bringing this over.
 We have permission for this?

102
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,600
- All clear from detective russell. 
- Great.

103
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,220
Okay,here we go.

104
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,350
Well,it certainly
looks like one of ours.

105
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,540
We had them specially
made for the color.

106
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,390
Gold is our trademark.

107
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,300
ah,yes.  We coded this key about
three weeks ago for apartment 42.

108
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,360
And is this the woman who
was staying in that unit?

109
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,860
I remember her face.

110
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,140
She was here.

111
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,220
She ave st h abeen guest
of one of our residents.

112
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,660
She looked me in the
eye when she said hello.

113
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,750
A lot of our visitors just can't
be bothered,but she was nice.

114
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,860
here we are.

115
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,450
That unit's owned by
the wellman corporation.

116
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:29,030
The only tenant to use it in the
last month was a mr.  Roger turow.

117
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,490
Thank you.

118
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,220
Mr. Donovan?

119
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,790
I'm roger turow.

120
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,760
I appreciate you meeting me out here.
 I'm certainly not looking for trouble.

121
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,480
Trouble?  Why would there be trouble?

122
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,960
Well,it's my job to book all the
corporate apartments for the firm.

123
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,600
I make them available to
out-of-town clients or guests.

124
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,280
And sometimes when I see they're
not being used,I use them myself.

125
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,290
Use them for what?

126
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,840
For gatherings,parties.

127
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,740
It's nothing shady,I assure you.

128
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,830
It's all perfectly normal.

129
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,520
I host wine tastings or book readings.

130
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,110
I have a number of guests.

131
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,550
Was she one of 'em?

132
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,360
Uh,no.

133
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,470
Well,possibly,but I don't recognize her.

134
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,870
She had a key to the apartment
made only three weeks ago.

135
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,330
Really?  Well,I have a number of
keys printed before each event.

136
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,120
I make them available so people
can come and go as they please.

137
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,620
I'd like to have the
names of those people.

138
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,020
I'm not sure I have them all.

139
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,260
You see,it's not just my guests.

140
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,180
It's their friends and
friends of their friends.

141
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,590
Mr. Turow,I'm not looking have
you fired,but this woman is dead.

142
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,960
I need to have the names of every
guest who might have one of those keys.

143
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,050
Of course.  Um,I'll-- I'll
write them down for you.

144
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,470
And I appreciate you not mentioning
anything to my boss abt this.

145
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,370
we're making progress.

146
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,920
So are we.  I just got a call from
the M.E.'S office.  Meet me there.

147
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,820
We called you as soon as we saw it.

148
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,370
Well,why didn't you see this before?

149
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,580
Because it didn't exist.

150
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,910
It can take up to two days for
bruising like this to emerge.

151
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,540
Okay,surprise number one.

152
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,170
After autopsy,we noticed a
bruise forming in the middle back.

153
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,330
After looking closer,we realized
it was an injection site.

154
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,760
She was injected in the back?

155
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,320
Definitely,and with a lot of
force,like a stabbing motion.

156
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,060
This was a homicide?

157
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,400
You said surprise number one.

158
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,560
Is there another one coming?

159
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,830
This is
number two--

160
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,260
routine dental x-rays
of the wisdom teeth.

161
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,050
Guys,they aren't developed at all.

162
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,310
what are you saying?

163
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,250
I'm saying your jane
doe isn't in her mid-20s.

164
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,980
She couldn't be any older than 15.

165
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,780
15?

166
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,840
I mean,what was she doing at a wine
tasting in a corporate apartment?

167
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,550
When I was 15,I did my
wine tasting in private.

168
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,380
In the backseat of
the quarterback's car?

169
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,980
And where are her parents? 
They must know she's missing.

170
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,790
I mean,why haven't they reported it?

171
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,980
Maybe they don't know.

172
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,200
Or maybe they think she's fine.

173
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,520
You'd be surprised at what kids
can hide from their parents.

174
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,850
And you'd be surprised
at the number of parents

175
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,520
who don't really care
where their kids are.

176
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,330
Well,I'm sure they would have at
least expected her to check in,

177
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,330
but he may be right. ****

178
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,070
It's in the fridge. 
You can heat it up later.

179
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,720
Just got back from the chicago P.D.

180
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,210
With the insulin shot in the back,

181
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,840
the case is officially a homicide,but
the "who is it?  " Is still on us.

182
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,190
We need to figure out this girl's story.

183
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,770
Maybe she's a runaway.

184
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,860
Yeah,maybe she's one of those kids

185
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,920
who got her education
from the streets,right?

186
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,570
Not from the schools.

187
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,110
It happens.

188
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,220
We can still find jane doe's friends.

189
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,180
There were photos on the music player.

190
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,810
Lindsey and I got one of the names
from the midsummer night's ball

191
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,120
and tracked down an address.

192
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,030
So we'll go talk to her tomorrow.

193
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,490
Good,and we'll start calling
schools in the morning.

194
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,270
She had to be a student somewhere,rig?

195
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,970
A charity ball
for heart disease--

196
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,390
is that really something
a tenth grader wants in on?

197
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,610
I don't get it.

198
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,680
If we just found out she's 15,she
did a pretty good job of hiding it.

199
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,440
So I wonder who else
in her life didn't know?

200
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,400
Or got angry when they found out.

201
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,360
here she comes.

202
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,810
Erin ingall?

203
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,140
We're trying to track
down a friend of yours.

204
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,070
Excuse me?  Who are you?

205
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,510
We're from the forgotten network.

206
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,050
We're volunteers that help
identify jane and john does.

207
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,340
That's from the midsummer night's ball.

208
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,600
That's lisa.

209
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,810
Her name is lisa?

210
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,770
Oh,my god.  Did something happen to her?

211
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,590
She was killed a few days ago.

212
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,040
we don't know her that well.

213
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,520
I-I don't even know her last name.

214
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,150
She's dylan's girlfriend.

215
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,980
- Who? 
- Dylan dreslan.  He's an old friend.

216
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,730
He told us about these get-togethers,

217
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,800
like mixers,at this building downtown.

218
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,410
- The gold standard. 
- Yeah.

219
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,810
Dylan's a regular.

220
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,450
He's brought lisa as
his date a few times.

221
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,910
Yeah,that's dylan.

222
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,600
We've known him since high school.

223
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,920
Did you know lisa was still
young enough to be in high school?

224
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,670
What?

225
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,180
<i>I really thought dylan would
make things better for me.</i>

226
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,100
<i>Most of the boys I knew were
still figuring out who they were.</i>

227
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,740
<i>But dylan...</i>

228
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,620
<i>he me me want to fit inthis world.</i>

229
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,520
you're here about lisa?

230
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,930
Yso da ago,your girlfriend
lisa was murdered.

231
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,270
U didn't know that?

232
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,040
- Murdered? 
- Yeah.

233
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,510
How?

234
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,320
Okay,w-wait.

235
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,060
First of all,she wasn't my girlfriend.

236
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,230
Careful,mr.  Dreslan.

237
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,910
I promise you,you do
not want to lie to me.

238
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,490
No,I'm not lying.

239
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,840
We went out a few times.

240
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,580
I-I took her to a few parties thrown
by a friend of mine.  That's it.

241
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,660
We need to know lisa's full name.

242
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,550
Chang.  Lisa chang.

243
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,710
When was the last time you saw her?

244
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,620
Two days ago,here.

245
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,930
She came to my office,said
that she didn't think

246
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,850
that we should see each other anymore.

247
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,650
Well,did she say why?

248
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,580
No,she just said she wasn't ready
to be in a relationship,and I agreed.

249
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,990
I mean,we only met a few
weeks ago at a museum exhibit.

250
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,270
Do you know where she lives,where
her parents might live?

251
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,620
No.  We never talked about that.

252
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,540
Uh,she said one time that her
mother was a hairstylist,I think.

253
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,830
You think?

254
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,210
Look,we never talked about that.

255
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,360
It turned out we didn't
have a lot in common.

256
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,960
yeah,well,maybe that's
because she was only 15.

257
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,480
I don't know what that means.

258
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,580
It means lisa chang
was only 15 years old,

259
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,620
which at minimum makes you
a suspect for statutory rape.

260
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,820
That's not possible.

261
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,950
It is possible.

262
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,730
She was young enough
to be in high school.

263
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,950
No,no,no.  She teaches high school.

264
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,320
That's what she said.  I-I
dropped her off a few times.

265
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,320
- Where? 
- Uh,lincoln rhodes prep.

266
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,990
The last time you saw her,

267
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,890
we need to know where you
were for the rest of the day.

268
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,730
I was in meetings with a client
all afternoon.  You can check.

269
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,150
Trust me,we will.

270
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,610
"Trust me,we will"?

271
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,920
Too much?

272
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,160
You know,you may not be a cop a,more
but you still know how to act like one.

273
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,900
lisa chang?

274
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,740
No,her name is li wen.

275
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,660
And she wasn't a teacher.

276
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,600
She was a sophomore.

277
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,550
We need to contact her parents.

278
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,510
Li lived with her aunt.

279
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,070
We've left her several messages,

280
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,940
and if we didn't hear
back in the next two days,

281
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,250
it's our policy to call the police.

282
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,140
Li also has a brother.

283
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,960
He graduated here three years ago.

284
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,350
He's in college now--
northwestern,I think.

285
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,870
No mother or father?

286
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,210
Well,I'm sure they're back in taiwan.

287
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,020
It's common for our
international students

288
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,200
to live with a relative or guardiaN.

289
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,040
It's the guardians that
register them here at school.

290
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,680
But to be perfectly honest,we don't
always know the family situation.

291
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,920
If a student lives
with a legal guardian,

292
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,950
we don't pry into personal history.

293
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,200
I know you can't get close to
every student,but did you know li?

294
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,070
Only a little.

295
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,050
I do think she was
having trouble adjusting.

296
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,630
Adjusting?

297
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,380
Socially.

298
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,610
Well,the kids here-- some
are from down the block.

299
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,220
Some are from all over the world.

300
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,970
It's--it's hard to figure
out where you fit in.

301
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:09,350
<i>School was exciting at first--
a fresh start in a new country,</i>

302
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,240
<i>the english textbooks,the
new clothes,fr new iends.</i>

303
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,980
<i>My brother quon loved it here.</i>

304
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,100
<i>D saiI would,too,but he was wrong.</i>

305
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,940
Hey,you ready?

306
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,420
We need to find the aunt.

307
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,410
How come she never reported li missing?

308
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,320
The address in li's file
is 33 hayworth.  Let's go

309
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,270
they didn't answer the phone.

310
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,410
When was the last time
you saw the tenants?

311
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,740
It's been a while.

312
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,180
Thank you.

313
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,230
Nothing.

314
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,810
This has to be hers.

315
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,110
And she was all alone.

316
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,960
<i>I was happy when I came here.</i>

317
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,060
<i>But sometimes when
you're in a strange place,</i>

318
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,920
<i>you never stop feeling like a stranger.</i>

319
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:12,110
Alex,they found insulin
in the refrigerator.

320
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,750
Li wen was living here.

321
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,510
How does this happen--
a 15-year-old girl

322
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,540
living by herself on lake shore drive?

323
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,540
Where's her guardian?

324
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,010
Who pays for this place?

325
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,640
The name on the lease
is mei chen,li's aunt,

326
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,490
but she doesn't pay for the rent.

327
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,250
The landlord says the money gets
wired into his account every month.

328
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,040
It'll take a minute,but
we're tracking from where.

329
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,190
Probably her parents in taiwan.

330
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,960
The school paperwork lists
her brother as quon wen.

331
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,560
We called his dorm at northwestern,

332
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,560
but he didn't answer,so
we're sending a unit.

333
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,630
Well,lindsey knows
northwestern pretty well.

334
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,220
Maybe she can help.

335
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,960
Yeah,I'm sure she can.

336
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,960
What?

337
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,010
Nothing.

338
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,040
Nothing?  I thought you liked lindsey.

339
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,280
I think lindsey's fine.

340
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,520
You know what I think?

341
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,860
I think maybe you're a little jealous.

342
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,330
- I mean,lindsey and I do spend an awful lot of time together. 
- Oh,my goodness.

343
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,500
- And we used to be partners.  It's only natural...For you to feel a little threatened. 
- I am not jealous,and you can spend time with whoever you want.

344
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,780
Are we done now?

345
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,330
Can we go back to work now?

346
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,310
I'll send candace and
tyler to li's school.

347
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,670
Maybe some of the students
can help us fill in the gaps.

348
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,110
Hey,hold on.

349
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,100
Didn't li's boyfriend dylan
say something about her mother?

350
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,440
He said she was a hairstylist.

351
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,650
The white lotus salon.

352
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,130
Maybe it wasn't her mother.
 Maybe it was her aunt.

353
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,230
how's she doing?

354
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,910
She seems devastated.

355
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,650
When patrol picked her up at the
salon,she had no idea li was gone.

356
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,940
Maybe she didn'T.

357
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,600
Ms. Chen,uh,if you're ready,we would
like to ask you a few questions.

358
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,910
- You're li's aunt? 
- Yes.

359
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,280
Not by blood,but I take care of her.

360
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,320
When her parents sent her
here from taiwan,they hired me.

361
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,950
My god.

362
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,180
When they see she's gone...

363
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,840
I need to call them.

364
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,720
But I still don't know what happened.

365
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,720
Forgive me,but I'm trying
to see how that's possible.

366
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,010
You're li's legal guardian.

367
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,110
You had to know she was missing.

368
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:05,030
No,she was traveling
with the school choir.

369
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,520
They were performing at
a school in grand rapids.

370
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,990
She's coming back on the weekend.

371
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,390
That's what she told you?

372
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,330
Of course.  I just assumed it was true.

373
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,920
Li never lied to me.

374
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,810
Ms. Chen,with all due respect,I
think you're the one who's lying.

375
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,680
We went to li's apartment.

376
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,710
The apartment?

377
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,410
She was living there
alone-- a 15-year-old girl.

378
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,320
- No,that's not right. 
- It is right.  We were there.

379
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,650
Please listen.

380
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,520
I don't stay at the
apartment,but neither does li.

381
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,340
She lives with me.

382
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,740
At first,it was my
hope to stay with her.

383
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,880
But I have my own family.

384
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,780
They need me closer to them.

385
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,370
So li understands.

386
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,920
We saw her room.

387
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,220
Yes,that's the apartment
her parents arranged for us.

388
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,890
My space isn't big
enough for her things.

389
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,680
I think every teenager
needs a room of her own.

390
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,980
Li goes there during the day
to play music and be a teenager.

391
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,250
She was dating a 25-year-old
man.  Did you know that?

392
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,690
No.  I don't believe that.

393
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,040
Her school's been leaving messages.

394
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,130
You haven't returned any of those calls.

395
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,580
I didn't know.

396
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,710
They must have been
calling the apartment.

397
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,040
Li was on her trip.

398
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,140
I never thought to check.

399
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,450
Please...

400
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,810
li was like my own daughter.

401
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,910
excuse me.  What's going on?

402
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,410
Cops are searching one of the rooms.

403
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,310
- You know who? 
- Quon wen.

404
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,980
Someone said he killed his sister.

405
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,120
- Where'd you hear that? 
- Just around.

406
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,700
I bet it's true,thoug 'cause his
girlfriend kate's really freaking out.

407
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,210
Excuse me!

408
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,760
Excuse me,kate,are
you quon's girlfriend?

409
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,510
- Do I know you? 
- It's okay.

410
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,660
We're not with the police.

411
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,010
We're with a group called
the forgotten network.

412
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,620
I don't know where quon is.

413
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,410
We really need to talk to him,kate.

414
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,540
I can't help you.

415
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,950
Kate,you know what
happened to his sister li.

416
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,180
It's not about helping us.

417
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:10,370
If you want to help him,tell
us where we can find him.

418
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,180
So where does your boss
think you are right now?

419
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,570
Nsuran iance seminar.

420
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,690
You ever been to one?

421
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,550
Yeah,it's like being shot
with a tranquilizer dart.

422
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,170
Oh.  So you just blew it off?

423
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,390
Aren't you worried he'll find out?

424
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,530
Well,I mean,the seminar
was on avoiding risk,

425
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,350
so yeah,maybe I should've gone.

426
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,260
I went to a school like
this-- eastlake prep.

427
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,690
Nothing but a holding pen
for out-of-control rich kids--

428
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,180
somewhere for their parents to park them

429
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,790
until they're old enough to
send them away to college.

430
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:50,250
You know,the whole out-of-control
thing I get,but rich?  Really?

431
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,810
I mean--I-I just-- I can't picture
you in the blazer and tie getup.

432
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,530
I'm not rich.  My parents are.

433
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,380
There's a big difference

434
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,660
and I burned the blazer and
tie the minute I graduated.

435
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,400
Li wen she was a sophomore.

436
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,770
Yeah,I knew her.

437
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,360
Didn't talk to her much.

438
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,650
We didn't exactly roll
with the same crowd.

439
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,320
And what crowd did li roll with,exactly?

440
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,560
Who's asking?

441
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,060
Name's tyler.

442
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,980
- You're not a cop? 
- No.  I'm a volunteer.

443
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,910
I'm just trying to learn about her life.

444
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,500
And you're not worried?

445
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,650
Why would I be worried?

446
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,300
I'm just saying,whoever
killed that girl,

447
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,800
they might not want
you asking questions.

448
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,130
Honestly,li didn't talk to too
many people,but we were friends.

449
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,080
Must have been hard trying
to be an american teenager.

450
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,350
I guess,but...

451
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,830
a lot of students at lincoln
rhodes are from taiwan,

452
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,050
and she could have hung out
with them if she wanted to,

453
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:54,000
but they have a whole
social thing going on.

454
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,110
What kind of social thing?

455
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,240
I can't really talk about it now.

456
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,660
Okay.  Then when?

457
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,910
Li was a cool girl.

458
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,190
You know,'te didn deserve
what happened to her.

459
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,250
You guys ever eat komodo dragon soup?

460
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,690
No.

461
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,290
Well,if you get hungry
later,around 11:00,

462
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,790
that's the place to get it.

463
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,520
And we can talk then?

464
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,500
What is this?

465
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,460
I think it's what
we're having for dinner.

466
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,680
so what about the boyfriend
dylan?  His story checked out?

467
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,230
He was with clients the
afternoon li was murdered.

468
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,220
- What about the guardian? 
- Looks good,too.

469
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,770
Russell sent a unit to the apartment.

470
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,840
The aunt said that li was
living on a pullout couch.

471
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,220
And what about the choir trip?

472
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,290
Never happened.  If that's
what she told her,she was lying.

473
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,550
I wonder if her parents know something.

474
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,380
We can ask 'em. They're
on their way from taiwan,

475
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,710
but when they get here, I'd like
to be able to tell them wt happened.

476
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,390
You sure about this?

477
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:21,730
Definitely.

478
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,110
My friends used to do this
all the time in high school.

479
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,840
So you're gonna order a soup
made from an endangered species?

480
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,170
Trust me.  There's no soup involved.

481
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,060
I'll have the komodo dragon soup.

482
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,940
You want fries with that?

483
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,370
so what did he give you?

484
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,180
The address of the party.

485
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,920
so what is this?

486
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,360
during the day,it's
an abandoned theateR.

487
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,990
I think that proves thwe I
nt to the wrong high school.

488
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,860
allright that's
dana hayes--

489
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,270
the girl who tipped us
off about this place.

490
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,430
Well,maybe now she'll tell us why.

491
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,030
li was a P.K.

492
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,170
What is that?

493
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,910
P.K. Stands for parachute kid.

494
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,140
We have a lot of
them at our school--

495
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,850
kids from taiwan or china who get
dropped into the united states.

496
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,240
Dropped by who?

497
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,440
Their parents.

498
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,890
They want them to have
an american education,

499
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,500
so they send them here alone
and arrange for a guardian.

500
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,100
How do you know all this?

501
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,380
From li.  Her brother quon did it.

502
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,940
Now he's in college.

503
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,320
Li's parents sent her over a year
ago,but she never liked it here.

504
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,760
Why not?

505
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,510
This is why not.

506
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,970
Some P.K.  S are pretty
much on their own.

507
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,850
Seems to me like most kids
would want that kind of freedom.

508
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,050
No.  Li wasn't like that.

509
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,730
<i>I tried to like them-- the
other kids e nt herlike me.</i>

510
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:20,070
<i>But I just wasn't re
y to grow up that fast.</i>

511
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,070
Alex!

512
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,670
Alex,you seeing this?

513
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,870
If you don't know,somebody
knows.  No,honestly.

514
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,550
That's quon--
li's older brother.

515
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,040
- I'm a t gonncalm down!  I'm not leaving! 
- What are you talking about?

516
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,220
Quon wen?

517
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,700
russell thinks li's brother
was involved in the murder.

518
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,510
Yeah,but why would he
kill his own sister?

519
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,900
Good question.  He's four years older.

520
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,090
They don't live together,it doesn't
even seem like their lives intersect.

521
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:09,740
Yeah,but people have all kinds of
baggage when it comes to siblings.

522
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,220
That was a general
statement.  I love my sister.

523
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,050
Maybe it wasn't some preplanned thing.

524
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,920
He got angry about
something,and it just happened.

525
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,330
Well,that fits with the insulin.

526
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,270
It was the only weapon around,so he
grabbed it and stabbed her in the back.

527
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,210
I just don't want us assuming anything.

528
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:27,800
The way we work is by learning about
li,and right now I don't see the connection.

529
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,620
Okay,so we stay open to everything.

530
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:35,270
Li was living in two worlds--
her school and hanging with dylan.

531
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,500
And we know dylan checked out.

532
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,180
I took a ton of pictures at the rave,

533
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,860
and I'll bet that some of those
other kids there were P.K.S.

534
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,300
We should look into that.

535
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,800
Sounds like a plan.

536
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,250
I' talk with russell about quon.

537
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,290
You guys start with these.

538
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:50,030
If they knew our girl,we
need to get to know them.

539
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,470
I'm not saying it's him.

540
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,120
I'm saying most people who run
from the cops are criminals.

541
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,560
- Any luck finding him? 
- Not yet,but we will.

542
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,190
I mean,think about it--
if quon was innocent,

543
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,900
why wouldn't he come
in,ask for our help?

544
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,050
I don't know.  He might be
guilty.  It just feels wrong.

545
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,970
What?

546
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,820
You're the one who tells me I should
get more in touch with my feelings.

547
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,660
Okay,no rush to judgment.

548
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,490
Co I just got the voice mails from li's
apartment put on disc.  Have a seat.

549
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,010
The first two are from the school
principal,asking why li was absent.

550
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,960
Then this...

551
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,910
<i>mei,it's quon. I can't
reach li. Call me.</i>

552
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,220
<i>It's quon. Where are you?</i>

553
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,510
<i>Is li okay? Please call me.</i>

554
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,210
You still think he's involved?

555
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,180
<i>yes,ms. Chen,my name is hal gordon.</i>

556
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,340
<i>I'm with the department of
social services here in chicago.</i>

557
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,300
<i>We received a report
regarding child neglect</i>

558
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,430
<i>for a young woman named li wen.</i>

559
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,820
<i>I've been out to see you
twice now,but you weren't home,</i>

560
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,030
<i>and you haven't responded to
my notes asking you to call.</i>

561
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,770
social services?

562
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,200
Someone filed a complaint for neglect,and
a few days later li was murdered?

563
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,260
We need to find the person
who filed that complaint.

564
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,300
She's right over there.

565
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,100
Dana.

566
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,200
Just want to ask you a couple
more follow-up questions.

567
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,800
You never told us that you
reported li to social services.

568
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,590
Don't deny it.

569
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,410
You made an anonymous call,but
that call was recorded.

570
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:18,600
Social services sent us the
tape,and I recognized your voice.

571
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,500
I couldn't tell you.

572
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,480
So what happened?  Did li
find out that you reported her?

573
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,040
Was she upset?

574
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,130
- Dana,if you hurt li
in self-defense-- - no.

575
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,160
I didn't report li because I wanted to.

576
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,790
I reported her because she asked me to.

577
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,890
she wanted to go home.

578
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,220
She couldn't do it herself,

579
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,070
not after everything her
parents gave up to send her here.

580
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,740
She told me they would never understand.

581
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,400
I helped her.

582
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,730
I reported her,and it got her killed.

583
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,980
Well,then who killed her?

584
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,650
The P.K.S.

585
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,260
They don't want investigations.

586
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,700
they don't want anyone going to
the authorities about anything.

587
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,040
Nobody threatens their freedom.

588
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,140
Dana,you were just at a party with them.

589
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,060
I had to go.

590
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,270
I have to be exactly the
same as always around them.

591
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,670
Why?

592
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,380
b-- they must have found out
about li and social services.

593
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,720
I don't want them to
know that I was involved.

594
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,020
Why didn't you tell
us any of this before?

595
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,110
'Cause I'm scared.

596
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,140
I mean,if they killed li,what do
you expect they're gonna do to me?

597
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,110
<i>I never wanted that
kind of freedom--</i>

598
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,280
<i>staying out all night,partying.</i>

599
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,450
<i>I tried.</i>

600
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,030
<i>I just never felt like I belonged.</i>

601
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,840
<i>I couldn't tell them
I wanted to go home.</i>

602
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:46,380
<i>They would never have understood.</i>

603
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,250
Okay,wang feng is a
sophomore,sun zhizhi,

604
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,760
senior,and chen shipeng is a freshman.

605
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,540
And there's nine boys in all.

606
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,830
And ten girls.

607
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,410
These are the parachute kids at
the rave who went to school with li.

608
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,650
Now li didn't hang out
with the P.K.S as much,

609
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,800
but these are the ones who
saw her on a daily basis.

610
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,520
Nice job.  So 19 kids.

611
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,270
Which means 19
suspects,assuming one of them

612
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,340
found out about li and social services.

613
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,150
It's hard to believe.
 They're just kids.

614
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,570
It's one thing to like your freedom.

615
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,280
It's another thing
to kill to protect it.

616
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,890
What,you think we're on the wrong track?

617
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,160
Let's find out.  We gotta
look at this from both sides--

618
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,380
social services and these kids.

619
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,770
I know social services.

620
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:25,150
I've dealt with them once in
a while with my own students.

621
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,640
They didn't write up any findings?

622
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,290
They never got a chance.  Li was killed
two days after the complaint was received.

623
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,560
Okay,lindsey,you take social services,

624
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,180
find out what they did on this case.

625
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,600
Walter,you're with lindsey.  Everybody
else,we're going back to that school.

626
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,210
Uh,what if they won't talk to us?

627
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,230
'Cause I thought that P.K.  S don't
talk to anyone outside their own circle.

628
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,380
Li talked with dana. 
Somebody will talk with us.

629
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,150
Parachute kids--
I-I've heard the term,

630
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:51,360
but all of the kids here at lincoln
rhodes have registered guardians.

631
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,290
From what we hear,those guardians
may not be doing their jobs.

632
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,880
They're doing fine in their classes.

633
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,190
There's no problem with
attendance or G.P.A.S.

634
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:02,250
We found 19 of your students at a rave
in an abandoned theater on a school night.

635
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,460
With all due respect,there
may be more problems here

636
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,350
than you're actually aware of.

637
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,590
- Nothing. 
- Dana was right.

638
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,080
These kids won't talk about li.
 They won't talk about anything.

639
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,360
They're scared.  If they're
living without supervision,

640
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,850
they know they can be
sent back to taiwan.

641
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,180
I think you should pick 'em up.

642
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,630
- Which ones? 
- All of them.

643
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,600
I mean,think about it.  These
kids could be living alone.

644
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,840
If that's true,it's endangering
the welfare of a child.

645
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,570
You have an obligation to investigate.

646
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,900
According to the principal,these
kids have guardians.

647
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,160
Fine.  So let them prove it.

648
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,780
Ifne of these kids killed li wen,

649
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,610
we need to know which ones
have something to hide.

650
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,040
hey.  Okay,so far only three loolegit.

651
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,850
Two live with grandparents,one with an
uncle who had all the right paperwork.

652
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,020
- We're still contacting their other guardians. 
- Let's keep going.

653
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,890
Alex,this is hal gordon from
social services,a friend.

654
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,090
Thanks for your help.  You didn't
have to come all the way down here.

655
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,940
Hal was assigned to li's case.

656
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,240
I was out at the house a
few times but got no answer,

657
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,110
so I took a ride to see
li's brother at northwestern.

658
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,390
- Juan? 
- Uh,quon.

659
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,760
Oh,right.  Well,he was out,but I
did speak to his girlfriend kate.

660
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,310
So kate knew that you
were investigating li?

661
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:18,100
Well,I told her.  Does that help you?

662
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,100
Yeah,I think it does.

663
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,020
I haven't seen quon.

664
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,530
I told you,I don't know
anything about this.

665
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:30,710
You're lying,kate.

666
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,330
You knew li was being
investigated by social services.

667
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,180
You knew she could have been sent home.

668
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,460
Did you think quon might
have to go with her,

669
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,850
that if the police thought
li was being neglected,

670
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,640
that quon could get into
some kind of trouble?

671
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,520
Maybe even deported?

672
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,650
How much do you love
your boyfriend,kate?

673
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,150
Would you kill to keep from losing him?

674
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,900
it wasn'T...

675
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,520
I can't hear you.

676
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,350
I wasn't worried about the government.

677
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,630
I was worried about his parents.

678
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,870
I know them.

679
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,920
If li was being neglected,they
would blame quon.

680
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:07,230
they would order him to come
home,and he would listen.

681
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,120
I just didn't know what to do.

682
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,630
And so I went to see mei.

683
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,710
Li's guardian?

684
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,200
I went to the salon where she works,

685
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,200
and I told her that social
services came to see quon.

686
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:28,050
Mei was upset.

687
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:30,240
Why didn't you tell us this before?

688
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,620
Not tell you what?

689
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,720
That I'm the one that
started all of this?

690
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,470
That I'm the one that got li killed?

691
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,350
I went to mei,and she told
me she would take care of it,

692
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,540
and I-I don't know what she did.

693
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,230
Did you tell this to quon?

694
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:50,500
Kate,does quon know it was mei?

695
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,880
Mei's apartment's at t end of the hall.

696
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,320
I liked this part much
better when I carried a gun.

697
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,770
I kinda like you better without one.

698
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,240
miss chen?

699
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,420
Miss chen?

700
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,350
Either this place was tossed
or someone left here in a hurry.

701
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,810
Who are you?!  What do you want?!

702
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,750
- All right,take it easy.  - Why are you chasing me?
 What do you want?  - Chicago police!  - Drop the gun!

703
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,900
Drop the gun!  Do it now!

704
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,590
- Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you chasing me? 
- Drop the gun!  Do it now!

705
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,970
Last chance!  Put it down right now!

706
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,870
- Nobody's gonna do anything. 
- Alex,step back,right now!

707
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,470
Quon,just listen. 
We're not here for you.

708
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,760
We're trying to find mei chen.

709
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,770
You're not the police.

710
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,680
I saw you the other
night.  You chased me.

711
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,160
That's right.  My name's alex donovan.

712
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,490
I'm not a cop,but this
is detective russell.

713
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,020
There's a badge on her belt.

714
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,120
We're tying to find out
what happened to your sister.

715
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,000
my sister was murdered.

716
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,860
That's right.  We think
we know who did it.

717
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,990
Mei.

718
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,500
That's who we're trying to find.

719
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,660
We kw it wasn't you.

720
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:18,510
Grace,please.  We're fine here.  Okay?

721
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,770
Quon,think about your parents,all right?

722
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,920
They've already lost one child.

723
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,470
Please don't do this.

724
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,420
Please.

725
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,940
come on.

726
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,730
I know you want revenge,quon,

727
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,030
but you have to know this was wrong.

728
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,730
Mei killed my sister.

729
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,780
If you knew that,

730
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,870
why didn't you go to the police?

731
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,290
Why did you run?

732
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,430
You don't understand. 
My sister and I are P.K.S.

733
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,990
There are people who
take advantage of that.

734
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,400
They kidnap us and ransom
us back to our parents.

735
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,860
You thought she was kidnapped?

736
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,890
I thought maybe someone grabbed
her,then she tried to escape.

737
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,210
Did you call your parents?

738
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,640
No.  I couldn't face them.

739
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,760
They'd blame me for not
protecting li,and they'd be right.

740
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,960
MeI chen said that li
was living with her.

741
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,250
Is that true?

742
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,040
No.  Li was living alone.

743
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,720
You knew that?

744
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,340
I didn't know in time.

745
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,530
when li died,I couldn't find mei.

746
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,150
I started asking around,trying
to find out about her.

747
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:34,950
She lied to me and my parents,and
not just about taking care of lI.

748
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,570
About what?

749
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:39,170
She wasn't just li's guardian.

750
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:42,710
She was the guardian for a lot of
kids-- P.K.  S all over chicago.

751
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,180
It was a business for mei.

752
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,970
If li had reported
her to social services,

753
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,740
her whole enterprise
would have collapsed.

754
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,250
That gives us motive.

755
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,860
Now we just have to find her.

756
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,090
I'll call it in.  I'll get
airports,trains,buses covered.

757
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,560
She has a car.

758
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,450
What kind?

759
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,860
A new cadillac.  I've seen it.

760
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,190
Well,if it's new
enough,maybe we can stop her.

761
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,420
technology,miss chen.

762
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,970
That car of yours has a lot of features.

763
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:40,430
One is a service that can start and
stop your engine from a company computer.

764
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,970
Comes in handy when you lose your key,

765
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:45,030
not so handy when you kill someone.

766
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,140
I told you.

767
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,680
I don't know what happened to li.

768
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,840
I remember what you told us.

769
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,060
You're here because of
what you didn't tell us.

770
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,730
You knew li was being
investigated by social services.

771
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:58,750
In other words,you were being investigated
for criminal neglect of a child.

772
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,640
I never neglected li.

773
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,340
The fact is,you're no
just li's guardian,are you?

774
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,750
That's why you ran.

775
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,790
Once we started questioning P.K.
 S,you knew we could find out.

776
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:11,020
You're listed as guardian
for 11 kids in chicago.

777
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,230
You took their parents' money,and
then you abandoned their children.

778
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,740
I guess most of those
ki like their freedom,

779
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,720
but li--she wasn't
like them,was she?

780
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:29,840
It was her.

781
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,920
The problem is,I'm not
sure we can prove it.

782
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,750
We still can't put her at the scene.

783
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,600
I think I know how.

784
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,770
I need to see the stuff
that we found in li's purse.

785
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,730
It's right here.

786
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,780
All right.

787
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,820
I knew when I saw this before that it was
a sophisticated choice for a young woman.

788
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,370
Now I know why.

789
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,340
It's not li's necklace.

790
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,170
It's mei'S.

791
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,390
It was on the ground.

792
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,030
We thought it was one of the things

793
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,870
that fell out of li's
purse,but it wasn'T.

794
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:19,030
Li must have ripped it off your
neck right before you killed her.

795
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,700
I warned her.

796
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,860
But she wouldn't listen.

797
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,560
she never listened.

798
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,400
I just wanted to go home.

799
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,300
she came from a small town,like I did.

800
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,670
She said all the right
things to my parents,

801
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:53,080
and they believed she
would keep us safe.

802
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,460
But I never thought she'd
go as far as she did.

803
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:12,130
For so long,I felt powerless.

804
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:15,390
But that day,I stood up for melF.

805
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,120
I grew up,

806
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:20,970
even if it was just for that moment.

807
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,510
In the end,

808
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,260
I didn't get to go home after all.

809
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:57,570
But in a way,home came to me.

810
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:18,170
My name is li wen.

811
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,790


812
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:13,730


813
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:22,620
