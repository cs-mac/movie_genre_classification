1
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:14,325
<i>Before we start,
I want you to know something.</i>

2
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,660
<i>I'm not a rat.</i>

3
00:01:17,787 --> 00:01:19,497
You understand?

4
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:23,000
I want that on record before we start.

5
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,669
<i>Okay.</i> You are not a rat.

6
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:28,339
<i>And it's on record.</i>

7
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:30,925
<i>Mr. Weeks, the charges against you,</i>

8
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,428
<i>racketeering, extortion, kidnapping,</i>

9
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:37,348
<i>and accomplice to murder,
are very serious.</i>

10
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:40,184
<i>Am I correct in stating that
you are here today</i>

11
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:43,187
<i>to make a deal
with the federal government?</i>

12
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:44,980
Correct.

13
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,900
And am I correct in stating
that you are going from

14
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:52,238
trusted confidant to one of
South Boston's most notorious

15
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:55,991
and violent gangsters
to government witness?

16
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:57,910
Correct.

17
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,579
<i>Then I need to know everything you know</i>

18
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:05,918
about the Winter Hill Gang,
the FBI and John Connolly,

19
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,711
and specifically,

20
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:10,256
what you know about your former boss

21
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:13,718
and now fugitive, James "Whitey" Bulger.

22
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:18,222
Well, let's start.

23
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,572
It'll be a good time tonight. We gotta...

24
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:36,490
Sorry, buddy. I can't let you in.

25
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,242
Yeah. That's cool, man.
I'm friends with Jimmy.

26
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:39,493
- Really?
- Yeah.

27
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:40,828
- You're with Jimmy?
- Yeah.

28
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,038
Well, I still can't let you in.

29
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,499
Who the fuck are you?

30
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,751
The guy who works here.

31
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:49,197
You probably don't remember this,

32
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,255
but you were here last Saturday night

33
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:53,507
with a few of your friends,
around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.

34
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,509
You took a piss up against the bar.

35
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,803
And that's frowned upon here.

36
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,140
But if you go down to Brannigan's,

37
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:02,808
just right down there,

38
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,853
they'll let you take a shit
in the middle of the floor,

39
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,438
if that's what you wanna do.

40
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,523
But you can't... You can't do it here.

41
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:10,858
All right. Yeah.

42
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,943
- Okay?
- Oh, yeah, we'll go.

43
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:16,197
Hey, look. No hard feelings, okay?

44
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:19,950
Fuck out of my fucking way,
you fuckin' retard.

45
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,411
Whoa!

46
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,080
Tough guy wants to dance.

47
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:27,666
Come on! Step the fuck...

48
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,501
<i>She's all fired up,
she knows he's over</i>

49
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:32,546
<i>at the Bulldog, running his mouth again.</i>

50
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,090
<i>She go over there
and she got a little fork</i>

51
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:36,800
<i>in her pocket, you know?</i>

52
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,594
<i>She walk right in there,</i>

53
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,721
tap him on the shoulder,
take his fuckin' eye out,

54
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,640
<i>right there, in front of everybody.</i>

55
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,308
<i>And Connors was fuckin' in there.</i>

56
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,810
<i>He couldn't even look.
He had to look away.</i>

57
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,145
<i>"MARTORANO". Connors ain't no tough guy.</i>

58
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,647
DeNucci whipped his ass in '59.

59
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,983
'Course he did,
he's a professional fighter.

60
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,485
Yeah, so is Connors.

61
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,819
Connors's a tough kid, but, you know,

62
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:58,656
Joe DeNucci's the real thing,
is all I'm saying.

63
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:00,032
<i>Well, I'm saying that Connors</i>

64
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,825
<i>didn't want no part of this broad.</i>

65
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,661
Hey, you know something?

66
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,246
MARTORANO <i>What?</i>

67
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,960
For 15 straight minutes,
I been watching you

68
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:14,672
putting your big fat fuckin' fingers

69
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,465
into your disgusting mouth,

70
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:21,303
<i>which is filled with God knows
what kind of fuckin' bacteria,</i>

71
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:25,099
and then you take the same
big fat fuckin' filthy fingers

72
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:27,685
and you stuff 'em back into the bowl

73
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,688
that is there for public consumption.

74
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,107
Now what the fuck are you thinkin', John?

75
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,026
Well, I wasn't thinking, Jimmy.

76
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,194
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,154
Just don't do it again.

78
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,740
<i>"BARMAN". Jimmy.</i>

79
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,409
Uh, sorry to bother you.

80
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,661
We got trouble outside.

81
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,710
<i>Fuck!
Ronald, hold him up straight!</i>

82
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,003
<i>"MAN". Put him up against the car!</i>

83
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,552
<i>Get him up! Get him up!</i>

84
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,471
Put a stop to it.

85
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,558
Charlie! Charlie,
he's a fucking kid, Charlie.

86
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:08,726
- Charlie!
- Come on.

87
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,019
<i>The fuck! He's fucking dead!</i>

88
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:11,562
<i>Charlie. Come here.</i>

89
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:12,730
- What the fuck, Jimmy?
- Shut up.

90
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,398
- Where're you going?
- You're fuckin' dead, you...

91
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:16,400
Did I fuckin' tell you to shut up?

92
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,569
You listen to me. I won't say it twice.

93
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,154
- Get in the fuckin' bar.
- Come on, pretty boy.

94
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:21,405
Asshole!

95
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,534
Hey, you know,

96
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,245
Charlie, the guy you was just beatin' on?

97
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,788
Yeah.

98
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,416
Yeah, he's Charlie McTiernan.

99
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,669
He's married to one of Jimmy's cousins.

100
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,482
How the fuck am I supposed to know that?

101
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:42,593
I don't know.

102
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,264
Good luck, kid.

103
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,004
Get in the fuckin' car.

104
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,509
No, no, no, no, no. You drive.

105
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,253
<i>Are we meetin' Carmelo out here?</i>

106
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,138
What the fuck, Jimmy?
What are we doin' here?

107
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,507
<i>- I mean...</i>
- Kill <i>the engine.</i>

108
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,092
Jimmy, look, I'm sorry.

109
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,010
<i>I was doing my job.
Shut the fuck up.</i>

110
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,527
Ah! Shit!

111
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:30,993
All right, that's enough.

112
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,206
<i>You got something I like, kid.</i>

113
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,584
<i>It's Kevin, right?</i>

114
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,044
<i>Meet Joey Anguilo.</i>

115
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,511
<i>"WEEKS". And just fucking like that,</i>

116
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,555
<i>I was Winter Hill.</i>

117
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,599
<i>And that was a big deal to me.</i>

118
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,518
<i>What'd you do?</i>

119
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,562
<i>"WEEKS". The everyday, smalltime stuff,</i>

120
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,564
<i>the rackets,
driving around making pickups,</i>

121
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:03,525
<i>checking on our vending machines,
you know.</i>

122
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,819
<i>And listenin' to Mickey bullshit.</i>

123
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,738
So, this guy at the Libra Lounge

124
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,656
in Revere over there is tellin' me

125
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,409
that the porn stars in California,

126
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,952
they eat a lot of celery

127
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,330
before they gonna perform, you know?

128
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:19,500
Wait. Whoa. Stop for a second.
That's old Mrs. Cody.

129
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,418
Mickey, you remember old Mrs. Cody?

130
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,086
'Course I do.

131
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:24,922
Going strong. Look at her.

132
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,801
Pardon me, Mrs. Cody,

133
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,054
but I think I smell
a little shepherd's pie

134
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,223
sneaking out of that
bag there. Am I right?

135
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:35,891
As I live and breathe, it's Jimmy!

136
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,017
It is.

137
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,686
When did you get out of Alcatraz?

138
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:43,607
Oh. Ah, that's nearly
10 years ago now, Mrs. Cody.

139
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,108
- Oh.
- More than a minute.

140
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,194
Well, it's wonderful to have you back

141
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,654
in the neighborhood, son.

142
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,614
You remember Mickey, don't you?

143
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,260
Hello, there. How are you, sweetheart?

144
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,492
- Good to see you.
- Lt's nice to see you.

145
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,203
You know this kid, Kevin?
Your paperboy, right?

146
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,330
- I grew up a little bit, huh?
- Kevin, yes. Good to see you.

147
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,499
Make sure everything gets
put away nice, you know.

148
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,626
She got everything she needs, huh?

149
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,112
<i>The truth of the matter is,</i>

150
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,880
<i>a lot of people in Southie loved Jimmy.</i>

151
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,258
<i>And you'd include
John Connolly in that group?</i>

152
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,635
<i>"WEEKS". Well, especially John Connolly.</i>

153
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,554
<i>I mean, he grew up in the projects</i>

154
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,348
a <i>few doors down
from the Bulger brothers.</i>

155
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,594
<i>And he was tight with Billy,</i>

156
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,401
<i>but like every other
kid in the neighborhood,</i>

157
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,770
<i>he was in awe of Jimmy.</i>

158
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,455
<i>The story goes, when he was growing up,</i>

159
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,983
<i>Connolly was taking
a beating from some guys</i>

160
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:30,112
<i>and Jimmy stepped in
and saved his ass, I guess.</i>

161
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,114
We've now come home to focus
on this office's top priority,

162
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,782
which is really the North End
of the Italian Mafia,

163
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,534
<i>led by Gennaro Angiulo.</i>

164
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,995
<i>He's a hell of a cop,
he's a straight shooter,</i>

165
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,998
and well, we're damn lucky
to have him. Welcome, John.

166
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,503
<i>"WEEKS". You know, Southie kids,</i>

167
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,005
<i>we went straight from playing</i>

168
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,490
<i>cops and robbers on the playground</i>

169
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,050
<i>to doing it for real in the streets.</i>

170
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,635
<i>And just like on the playground,</i>

171
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,388
<i>it wasn't always easy to tell who's who.</i>

172
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,307
There he is.

173
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,975
Oh, John!

174
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,978
- How are you?
- Very good.

175
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,563
If I'm buying anyone,

176
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,248
- I'm buying Gary Carter.
- Gary Carter.

177
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:08,525
That kid is a star in the making.

178
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:09,973
Which is why it'll never happen.

179
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:12,195
Not in a million fuckin' years.
You know why?

180
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,781
- Because it's the Sox.
- Lt's the Sox.

181
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,368
So, seriously, what do I call you now?

182
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:22,289
I mean, is it Billy?
Or I gotta call you Senator?

183
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,666
Oh, come on. I'm the one drooling here.

184
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,084
Mr. FBI Hero.

185
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,670
How's the wife? How's Marianne?

186
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,088
Great. Can't complain.

187
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:33,133
Okay, look at you. Look at you.

188
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,638
I haven't forgotten where we came from.

189
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,003
"Don't you ever do that again."

190
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,936
"I don't want to see you
throw the first punch,"

191
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,258
"throw the first two punches!"

192
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,272
Oh, man. Yeah, I gotta get
down to the Old Harbor.

193
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,859
You ought to, John.
Ma would love to see you.

194
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,528
How's, uh, how's your brother?

195
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,865
- How is Jimmy?
- Jimmy's Jimmy. You know?

196
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,033
Why do you ask?

197
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,534
Well, it's no secret that.

198
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,204
Southie's been a war zone lately.

199
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,623
<i>What, with 60, 70 slayings?</i>

200
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,876
But your brother and his Winter Hill boys,

201
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,002
they're still out there.

202
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,171
They must be doing something right. Right?

203
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,635
All right, John.
Let's call this what it is.

204
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,428
You're jerking me off under the table

205
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:19,638
<i>- to get to Jimmy.</i>
- Aw, <i>Billy.</i>

206
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,056
Jimmy's business is Jimmy's business.

207
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,933
It sure as hell ain't none of mine.

208
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,812
I got an edict to eradicate the Mafia.

209
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,315
<i>And I know that Jimmy and Stephen Flemmi</i>

210
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,901
<i>are musclin' in on their numbers rackets</i>

211
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,903
and their vending machines.

212
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,238
And I know that this

213
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,031
<i>ain't sitting very well with Angiulo.</i>

214
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,437
- I don't wanna hear this.
- You need to hear this, Billy.

215
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,619
Your brother

216
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,790
is wading in some very dark waters.

217
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,214
You know, we all need friends.

218
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,509
Even Jimmy.

219
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,845
Even you.

220
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,472
Nobody gets there on their own.

221
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,433
Ain't that right, Senator?

222
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,519
You know what, John?

223
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,147
It's good to see you
doing so well. Really, it is.

224
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:13,191
Give my regards to the boys at the Plaza.

225
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,818
Listen, you don't wanna
give that to Jimmy?

226
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,779
Fine. But just... Just tell him I said,

227
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,616
"Hello," and I'm back.

228
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,493
Oh, if Jimmy wants to get in touch,

229
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,829
he'll find you. Trust me.

230
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,331
You ought to come over to dinner sometime.

231
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:30,250
Mary and the kids would love to see you.

232
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,296
- Robert, how are things?
- How are you, Senator?

233
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,672
Good to see you.

234
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,433
Oh, there she is.

235
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,352
Agent Marianne.

236
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,855
Hands where I can see 'em.

237
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,066
Looks good. You're making progress.

238
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,943
Well, thank you, Agent Connolly.

239
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,654
- Did you save Boston yet?
- Mmm.

240
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,698
It's early, but I'm working on it.

241
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,383
Well, you better work hard,
because Hoover's expecting big things

242
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,161
from his favorite son.

243
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,539
- He won't be disappointed.
- Oh, is that so?

244
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,597
Hey, you little thief.

245
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,934
What're you doing? I know what you want.

246
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,352
<i>Jimmy?</i>

247
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,770
- Is <i>that</i> you?
- What's she looking for?

248
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,563
<i>Good morning, Ma!</i>

249
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,358
How was work?

250
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,401
It was long. I gotta get
some sleep, sweetheart.

251
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,737
- Oh.
- How we doin', huh?

252
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:42,739
All right, hey.

253
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:45,659
You still owe me $56.

254
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,410
What do you say?

255
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,789
- Oh... All right, one hand, huh? One hand.
- Ah, yeah, yeah.

256
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,917
And $56 is still a lot of money, Jimmy.

257
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,204
<i>Oh, don't I know it.</i>

258
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,420
<i>You gonna cheat me again
or you gonna play straight?</i>

259
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,257
Ah, look who's talkin'. Cheat.

260
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:03,468
Ah, Jimmy. Get the jacket off.

261
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:04,761
Here we go.

262
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:23,780
Gin.

263
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,782
Come on. Not again.

264
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,994
You not paying attention?

265
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,121
Can't you see I'm after hearts?

266
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,623
And you just keep feeding me hearts!

267
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,542
Billy, I'm getting creamed over here.

268
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:36,751
Better you than me, pal.

269
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,336
Did you learn nothing in prison?

270
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,007
Oh! All those hours and no one
taught you how to play gin.

271
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:45,093
Well, they didn't teach me
how to cheat against my mom.

272
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,637
Look, here's my cards. Count 'em out.

273
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,140
Hey, Ma, did you hear
old Mother Burke died

274
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,641
over on Baker Street?

275
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,685
No one found her for a couple of weeks.

276
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,103
That's right.

277
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,147
And when they broke down the door,

278
00:14:57,272 --> 00:15:00,066
her cats had devoured
the best part of her.

279
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,155
That's... That's beautiful, Ma.
Who's hungry?

280
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,824
I'm out. I got creamed,
I'm going to take a nap.

281
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,075
Thanks for cheating, Ma.

282
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,660
<i>See you later.</i>

283
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,581
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Yeah.

284
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:17,000
<i>Do you remember little John Connolly?</i>

285
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,668
<i>Yeah, why? What's up?
What's the matter?</i>

286
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,922
<i>He's an FBI agent now.
Just... He's come back home.</i>

287
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,780
Connolly.

288
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,826
I'm on my way.

289
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,741
Hey, Jimmy.

290
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,743
It's good to see you.

291
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,288
The fuckin' FBI, John?

292
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,794
You got two minutes.

293
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,505
All right, I'm gonna cut right to it.

294
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,801
I have it on very good authority

295
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:53,596
that Gennaro Angiulo is
planning to have you murdered.

296
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,599
Is that so?

297
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,935
And how does he plan to achieve that?

298
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:03,606
That's the kind of information
that my side gets.

299
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,134
And that's the kind of information

300
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,276
that we can provide.

301
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,112
John, do you know what I do to rats?

302
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:12,615
It ain't rattin', Jimmy. It's an alliance.

303
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,744
An alliance between
me and the fuckin' FBI?

304
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,329
No, no, between you and me.

305
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:24,085
I can help you, Jimmy,
and you can help me.

306
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:27,714
Listen, the whole
fucking game has changed.

307
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,092
And I'm not trying to
clean up Southie. Fuck that!

308
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,511
I fuckin' love this place.

309
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,306
I'm interested in the North End.

310
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:39,142
And taking down the fuckin' wops.

311
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,978
I'm interested in the Mafia
and I bet you are too.

312
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:49,819
That's two minutes.

313
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,905
Just think about it, will you?

314
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:32,862
Hi.

315
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,160
Here she is, Miss America.

316
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,499
And don't we look beautiful today.

317
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,297
Where's my boy, sleeping upstairs?

318
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:52,841
- Yeah.
- Should I wake him up?

319
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,385
- No.
- You don't want me to wake him up?

320
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,178
- No!
- You sore at me?

321
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,304
Jimmy, don't wake him up.

322
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,848
I'll be sore if you wake him up.

323
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,350
I'm gonna go wake him up now.

324
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,060
<i>- Don't</i> wake <i>him up.
- Wakin' him up.</i>

325
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:28,001
Hey, buddy. Got a question for you.

326
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,673
What are you gonna do
with the rest of that?

327
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,049
Not drink it.

328
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,719
No, buddy, you gotta
drink every drop of that.

329
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:38,845
You know why?

330
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,265
That is pure vitamin C,

331
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,893
and it's freshly squeezed by your mommy,

332
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,854
which is, obviously,
makes it more special,

333
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,606
even magical-like.

334
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,775
It's true. Go on. Put it away.

335
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,154
Good boy.

336
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:58,907
So...

337
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,620
Do you feel like, maybe,
you want to tell me what...

338
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,246
What happened in school yesterday?

339
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:17,091
Oh, I remember. Something did happen.

340
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:18,635
Yeah? What happened?

341
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:22,472
Timmy. He's the kid who's
always trying to trip me.

342
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,682
And he stole my coloring
pencils off my desk

343
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,392
when my back was turned.

344
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,144
So I punched him in the face.

345
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,812
Good boy.

346
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:30,980
<i>Jimmy.</i>

347
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,106
Hey.

348
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,067
<i>Let me ask you a question,</i>

349
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,693
is that why you think you got in trouble?

350
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,695
'Cause you punched him in the face?

351
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,699
All right. I need you
to listen very carefully

352
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:42,992
<i>to what I'm sayin' because</i>

353
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,494
there are lessons again and again

354
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,579
throughout your whole life.

355
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,499
And you gotta learn
from these things, right?

356
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,209
Here's the deal.

357
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:54,837
You did not get in trouble
because you punched

358
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,465
this sneaky brat in the face, not at all.

359
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,842
You got in trouble

360
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:03,012
because you punched
this sneaky little brat in the face

361
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,847
in front of other people.

362
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,184
<i>Jimmy?</i>

363
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,186
I really don't think
that that's the right thing

364
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,729
to be teaching your kid.

365
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:16,651
No, that's absolutely what
I should be tellin' him, babe.

366
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,072
So, the lesson you gotta learn is this,

367
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:24,450
it's not what you do,
it's when and where you do it.

368
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,870
And who you do it to or with.

369
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:30,456
Huh? You follow?

370
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:33,710
Yes, I follow. Punch people
when no one's looking.

371
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,379
That's exactly right.

372
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,631
If nobody sees it,

373
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,302
it didn't happen.

374
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,407
Well, look what crawled out of the gutter.

375
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,701
Good afternoon, Officer Flynn.

376
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,537
What happened? I must
have been doing 30 in a 25.

377
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,247
Gonna lock me up for life or somethin'?

378
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,335
<i>Hey, why don't you do
your fucking job instead of</i>

379
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,002
trying to jerk off on us,
you pathetic fuckin' stiff?

380
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,211
Quiet, Tommy. Tommy!

381
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,504
I'm doing my fuckin' job.

382
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,174
I'm sure the officer
didn't stop us by accident.

383
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,508
You wouldn't happen to be

384
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,594
carrying a message now, would you?

385
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,429
In fact, lam.

386
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:30,099
Gerry Angiulo sends his regards.

387
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,306
Says he doesn't like finding
his boys beat to a pulp

388
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,145
and left for dead in empty parking lots.

389
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,396
<i>He also said he's confident</i>

390
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:36,814
<i>you ain't gonna cause him
any more troubles,</i>

391
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,274
'cause if you do,

392
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,401
it's only gonna cause
much worse troubles for you.

393
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:41,736
Listen, motherfucker.

394
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,571
<i>You think 'cause you're
wearing a fucking uniform,</i>

395
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,656
you can do what you want?
Go fuck yourself!

396
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,075
- Settle down, fucking rummy!
- Fuck you!

397
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,285
<i>Tommy, close the fucking door.</i>

398
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,579
<i>I gotta tell you something, Officer Flynn.</i>

399
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,582
It's a sad day when a native son

400
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,459
takes up with his oppressor.

401
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:59,504
There's a word for that
back home, you know.

402
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:00,838
Penalty's death.

403
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,007
You threatenin' me, Bulger?

404
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,718
The last thing I would do
if I was planning to harm you

405
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,429
is to warn you in advance, you dumb fuck.

406
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,264
You better watch yourself, Bulger.

407
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,933
You better fuck yourself, Flynn.

408
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,268
Fuck you, you project rat.
And fuck you, you rummy.

409
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,867
<i>I never trusted Flynn.
He's</i> a <i>fucking prick.</i>

410
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,327
<i>"LEONARD". Take it easy, will you?</i>

411
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,913
Even as kids,
he was a fuckin' prick.

412
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,207
- A fuckin' prick.
- Please, calm down.

413
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:39,168
Swear to God,
I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.

414
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:40,495
I'll fucking kill that Flynn.

415
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,713
Take it easy, will you? Come on.

416
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:45,216
Cock-sucking,
turncoat motherfucker.

417
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,342
He's fucking dead!

418
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:48,302
You're not fuckin'
killing anybody, Tommy,

419
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,596
and you ain't killing a cop any time.

420
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,014
You hear me?

421
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,561
Fuck you, Whitey.

422
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:58,604
Oh, Jesus. Tommy...

423
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:01,899
- Go fuck yourself.
- Tommy, come on. Enough.

424
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,359
Huh?

425
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,194
- Fuck you.
- Take it easy.

426
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,362
Take it easy, come on.

427
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,728
You want to take a shot, Tommy?

428
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:08,948
Enough. Enough.

429
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,283
Take your shot.

430
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:13,077
But make it your fucking best,
'cause I get up, I eat you.

431
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,843
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Let's go. Come on.

432
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:17,373
Sit down. Relax. Jimmy,
he's shit-faced. I'll deal with him.

433
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:18,708
- You fuckin' better.
- Don't even worry about it.

434
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,585
What, you think I look fucking worried?

435
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,919
Sit down. Please, sit down.

436
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:25,047
Jesus Christ,
he's fuckin' retarded.

437
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,215
<i>"TOMMY". Jack O!</i>

438
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,718
Give me another one, huh?

439
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,094
Hey, Tommy.

440
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,387
Yeah?

441
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,097
You watch yourself.

442
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,060
Mr. Martorano,

443
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,813
<i>you are one of the most
feared men in Boston.</i>

444
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:43,399
<i>And well-known as the chief executioner</i>

445
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,901
<i>for the Winter Hill Gang.</i>

446
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,235
<i>Is that correct?</i>

447
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:47,820
Yes.

448
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:52,533
<i>You are also reputed to
have murdered some 20 people.</i>

449
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,077
Would you say that is accurate?

450
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,413
That is accurate, yes.

451
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,583
Mr. Martorano, I want you to
be as specific as possible

452
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,836
in answering why the war
between the Angiulos

453
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:06,297
and Winter Hill escalated.

454
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:08,799
Simple. Territory.

455
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,093
Specifically South Boston?

456
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,262
Yes, Southie.

457
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,348
<i>Angiulo wanted to control everything,</i>

458
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,309
<i>loan-sharking, vending machines,</i>

459
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:19,769
<i>all the rackets.</i>

460
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,230
<i>"OLSEN". And there were consequences.</i>

461
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,107
Yeah. There was consequences.

462
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,654
What the fuck?

463
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,880
<i>Tommy.</i>

464
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,048
Yeah.

465
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,299

<i>We need you. We're looking for Suitcase.</i>

467

Suitcase? The fuck did he do?

468
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,848
He set up Mickey.

469
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,601
Fuck me.

470
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:04,272
Hang on a minute.

471
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,524
Hey, what's going on, Jimmy?

472
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:08,317
You guys looking for Suitcase?

473
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,278
I seen him up on Winter Hill
a few hours ago.

474
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:11,654
Need me to jump in?

475
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:13,614
Nah, we got it, Buddy.

476
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:16,909
<i>What the fuck
are you doing, Tommy?</i>

477
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,875
It's a fuckin' vest.
You got a problem with it?

478
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,585
Makes you look like a faggot.

479
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,877
We'll see who the faggot is

480
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:29,338
when it stops a couple
of fuckin' bullets, huh?

481
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,609
Hey, Jimmy, about that bullshit

482
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:52,194
the other night at Triple O's, I was...

483
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,571
I was fucking way outta line.

484
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:56,032
Forget about it, Tommy. You was drunk.

485
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:59,076
I know I was drunk,
but that ain't an excuse.

486
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,328
Should never have fuckin' happened.

487
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:01,829
No, it should never have happened.

488
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,664
But that's the thing. That's...

489
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,875
I want you to listen to me.

490
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,461
- You need to keep an eye on it.
- Yeah.

491
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:10,546
Because, you know, the juice,

492
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,340
it'll sneak up and bite you on the ass

493
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,265
and you never know when,
you know what I mean?

494
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:15,468
Absolutely, absolutely.

495
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:18,220
And I... I worry about you, that's all.

496
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:21,557
I'll keep an eye on it,
I promise. I promise.

497
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,184
We good?

498
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:24,310
Yeah, we good.

499
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,650
Lots of good your vest did you today,

500
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:32,276
you fucking prick.

501
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,989
Put him in the trunk.

502
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,412
<i>Why'd they kill Tommy?</i>

503
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:44,664
<i>"WEEKS". I think Jim was convinced</i>

504
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:47,542
<i>that Tommy ratted out Mickey to Angiulo.</i>

505
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,044
<i>Either that or Tommy
raising a fist to Jimmy,</i>

506
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,047
<i>which is never a good idea.</i>

507
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,882
<i>"OLSEN". Where'd they bury him?</i>

508
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,426
<i>WEEKS". In Jim's favorite spot.</i>

509
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,137
<i>Right there under the bridge
in Neponset River.</i>

510
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:03,974
<i>He buried so many bodies in that shithole,</i>

511
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,979
<i>it became known
as the Bulger Burial Ground.</i>

512
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,818
I don't know how you fuckers
didn't get it. I really don't.

513
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:17,113
I mean, in the beginning,
Jim was a small-town player

514
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:19,907
who really only mattered in Southie.

515
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,158
Don't get me wrong,

516
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:24,870
he was a tough motherfucker,
but smalltime.

517
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,580
And then, the next thing you know,

518
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:28,791
he's a goddamn kingpin.

519
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,459
You know why?

520
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,421
Because the FBI let it happen.

521
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:44,098
<i>"CONNOLLY". This is John.</i>

522
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,391
Connolly.

523
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:48,144
Jimmy.

524
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:49,430
<i>This is potentially</i>

525
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:50,604
<i>the biggest opportunity</i>

526
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:52,565
<i>the Bureau will ever have had</i>

527
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,483
in the history of the city of Boston,

528
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,360
and you need time to think about it?

529
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:59,196
Before you go flying
any further off the handle,

530
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,906
it might help to recall

531
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,574
that Whitey Bulger is an ex-convict.

532
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,244
- Yeah.
- And that his parole category is.

533
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:06,704
"Supervised Release Status,"

534
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:09,415
a designation that we would be
required to get withdrawn

535
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,710
or else we would be
in violation of Bureau regulations.

536
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:15,004
So? We withdraw or we violate.

537
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,172
What we don't do,

538
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:17,631
unless we're clinically insane,

539
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,216
is blow this chance!

540
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:23,596
And by the way,
it's "Jimmy," not "Whitey."

541
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:27,099
The only thing you're gonna get
by calling him Whitey is a fucking smack.

542
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,392
Oh, is that so?

543
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,686
So I'm supposed to cater
to this fucker's whims?

544
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:32,772
<i>If it brings you Angiulo, yes!</i>

545
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:35,483
And what makes you so sure

546
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:37,088
that he's gonna be a reliable source?

547
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:38,360
Because in my experience,

548
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:39,820
every one of those Winter Hill pricks

549
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,864
is a double-crossing cocksucker.

550
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:43,616
I grew up with him in Southie.

551
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,536
Jimmy, his brother Billy, and me.

552
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:51,540
And that is a bond
that doesn't get broken.

553
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,584
I mean, if he gives me his word,

554
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:54,794
he will keep it.

555
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:57,004
So we're relying on the word of criminals.

556
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,006
Jimmy's no ordinary criminal.

557
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,258
<i>McGUIRE: Well, you're right about that.</i>

558
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,303
"A vicious animal who
won't take no for an answer."

559
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:07,139
<i>"Violent decisiveness
at any hint of betrayal."</i>

560
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,351
Oh! "A ripened psychopath"

561
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,311
"determined to succeed above all else."

562
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,355
<i>I got a lot of respect for you, Charles,</i>

563
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,399
but I cannot fucking believe
what I'm hearing.

564
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:20,361
<i>Four Mafia murders in the North End
this month alone,</i>

565
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,655
<i>and we don't have
a legitimate case on any of them.</i>

566
00:30:22,947 --> 00:30:24,588
The Angiulos are out there laughing at us

567
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,992
like we're fuckin' a bunch of clowns!

568
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,911
<i>A bunch of clowns!</i>

569
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:34,250
Come on, guys. If we're serious
about bringing down the Italians,

570
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,085
Jimmy is the only way.

571
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:38,045
What about these
LSD experiments in prison?

572
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,171
He can't be stable.

573
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:41,215
He did it for time off and money.

574
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,758
And it was a handful of times.

575
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:45,344
It was 50 times, John.

576
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,597
Just trust me when I tell you

577
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:52,768
he is a smart, stable motherfucker.

578
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,815
What do you think, Morris?

579
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:04,613
I think that we have more
to gain than to lose on this.

580
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,866
I think we go with John.

581
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:10,494
I think we bring Whitey,
uh, Jimmy, into the tent.

582
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,754
No drugs. No fuckin' murder, Connolly.

583
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:48,991
<i>You listen good,
'cause I'm only gonna say this once.</i>

584
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:52,661
<i>I will never hurt, or adversely affect</i>

585
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,788
any of my friends or financial partners.

586
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,374
<i>I do not consider this rattin'</i>

587
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,377
or informin'.

588
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:00,836
This is business.

589
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,713
I couldn't have said it any better.

590
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,841
<i>You're a liaison.</i>

591
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:07,488
<i>You pretty much do whatever you want.</i>

592
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:09,053
And no one's gonna raise an eyebrow

593
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:11,389
so long as you're leadin' us
into some pretty big busts.

594
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:15,184
<i>There's just one restriction on our side,</i>

595
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:19,021
you can't kill anybody, Jimmy.

596
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,527
<i>Kevin, did you know
that Whitey was an informant?</i>

597
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:27,071
<i>No, I didn't know.</i>

598
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:29,365
<i>I mean, he hated rats.</i>

599
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,992
<i>We fuckin' buried rats,
especially our own.</i>

600
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,371
<i>I mean, I knew he had
his connections in the FBI.</i>

601
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:36,914
<i>I knew he had his sources.</i>

602
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,040
<i>But I figured he was playing them</i>

603
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:39,541
<i>like he did everybody else.</i>

604
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,962
<i>But obviously, he had a plan.</i>

605
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,385
Where do you get the energy
for that shit, Jimmy?

606
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:54,515
Hey, Steve. Hang on a minute.

607
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:59,395
We've known each other
a long fuckin' time, you know?

608
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,149
Can I trust you, Stevie?

609
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:08,237
- You know you can trust me.
- Good.

610
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,241
'Cause there's something
I want you to know.

611
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,662
I'm making a deal with the Feds.

612
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:18,706
An alliance.

613
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:22,084
- You're informing to the FBI?
- No.

614
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:24,420
There's informing,
and then there's informing.

615
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:28,257
Informing, you should be
fucking chopped up

616
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:30,551
and put into a garbage bag, that's it.

617
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:33,095
Informing, you're the scum of the scum.

618
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,098
But it's not informing
when you're bringing down

619
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:40,936
the cocksuckers who deserve
to be brought down.

620
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:43,439
Like the fucking Brits in the six counties

621
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:46,775
or the goddamn Dagos up in the North End.

622
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:49,570
It's a business opportunity.

623
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:55,451
Get the FBI to fight our wars
against our enemies,

624
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:58,787
while they protect us,

625
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:01,749
and we do whatever the fuck we wanna do.

626
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:16,764
All right, Jimmy.

627
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,394
There's a guy named John Connolly.

628
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:24,814
He's a Southie boy, we grew up together.

629
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,981
He's all right.

630
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,112
So, we're doing this?

631
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:33,947
Yeah, we're gonna do this.

632
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,855
Ho, ho, ho!

633
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,858
He's asleep,
he's a little sick.

634
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,612
He's a little sick? Sick With what?

635
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,657

00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:15,737
We have given Bulger miles
and miles of leeway and so far

794
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,572
he's given us dick in return.

795
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,368
<i>I need a wire inside
Angiul0's headquarters.</i>

796
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:22,911
<i>That fucker's been moving around so much,</i>

797
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:24,245
<i>I need to know specifically</i>

798
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:27,052
where his fucking headquarters even are.
And the fact that we don't

799
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:29,122
makes us look like a bunch of
fucking Keystone Kops.

800
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:30,752
<i>I need evidence</i>

801
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:32,637
<i>that I can present
to the Federal prosecutor.</i>

802
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:33,755
And you'll get it.

803
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:35,757
You got two weeks.

804
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:39,094
That's fucking it!

805
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:40,595
Then I pull the plug.

806
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:53,900
<i>Are you telling me that
your fucking boys at the Bureau</i>

807
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,944
<i>can't find Angiulo's place?</i>

808
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:59,072
For fuck's sake, everyone in Boston
knows where the guy is!

809
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,199
The fucker keeps moving
all over the North End.

810
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,159
I need specifics, Jimmy.

811
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:06,788
Not tomorrow, not next week, now. Today.

812
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:10,625
I need to get a wire
inside Angiulo's headquarters

813
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:12,794
or I can't keep protecting you.

814
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:14,796
It's that simple.

815
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:20,093
All right.

816
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:22,137
But I need you to do something for me.

817
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:26,599
You want a fucking wiretap or not?

818
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:28,935
Jesus, Jimmy. Jimmy.

819
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:33,648
I want all of Angiulo's vending machines
out of the Old Colony.

820
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:35,483
<i>I don't care how you do it,</i>

821
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:39,446
<i>I just want 'em gone. Do you follow?</i>

822
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,073
<i>Do you fucking follow?</i>

823
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,707
<i>All right, then.</i>

824
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:54,002
When you leave for work tomorrow morning

825
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:58,465
after you've gone for your jog
down Silver Street,

826
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,342
<i>after you stopped at McNulty's</i>

827
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:03,178
<i>for a black coffee and a Danish,</i>

828
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:05,513
<i>after you read the sports page,</i>

829
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,849
<i>after you kissed Marianne goodbye,</i>

830
00:46:08,016 --> 00:46:11,102
<i>you walk straight out
your door to your car,</i>

831
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:13,188
<i>which is parked in the same fuckin' spot</i>

832
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:14,773
<i>it's always parked in.</i>

833
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:19,694
<i>Right before you put your keys
into the ignition,</i>

834
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:22,363
<i>maybe have a look in the glove box.</i>

835
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:29,662
<i>There just might be an early
Christmas present in there for you.</i>

836
00:46:45,804 --> 00:46:46,805
What's this?

837
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,224
Gentlemen, this is Intel,

838
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,351
from our source in Winter Hill.

839
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:56,314
<i>Holy Shit.</i>

840
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:57,649
<i>"CONNOLLY". 98 Prince Street.</i>

841
00:46:57,774 --> 00:47:00,026
<i>Angiulo family headquarters.</i>

842
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,194
FITZPATRICK <i>Fuck</i> me.

843
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,321
Yeah, "Fuck me," and fuck you is right.

844
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:08,034
<i>An hour ago,
I got a wet shave in a barbershop</i>

845
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,704
<i>right across from 98 Prince
in the heart of the North End.</i>

846
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:15,542
And within 15 minutes,
I saw Mikey Angiulo,

847
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:19,212
Bobby Carozza, and one
Vincent "The Animal" Ferrara

848
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:20,547
all go inside.

849
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:21,756
Jesus, John.

850
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:24,717
<i>Do you wanna talk about
who's a valuable asset, Charles?</i>

851
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,344
<i>In five fucking years</i>

852
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:29,430
of nobodies with Scotch on
their breath giving us shit.

853
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:30,932
Not a goddamn thing.

854
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:32,600
And giving them 40 bucks
to go around the corner

855
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,727
and get drunk
and dick us around? Fuck that.

856
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:37,856
This, on the other hand,
is the kinda Intel we get

857
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:41,818
from James "Whitey" Bulger, gentlemen.

858
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:43,736
No one else.

859
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:04,591
<i>Jimmy always had a plan.</i>

860
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:09,637
<i>Like him giving up Angiulo's
address at 98 Prince Street.</i>

861
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,307
<i>Now that was a smart play.</i>

862
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:17,061
Because it kept Connolly, you know,

863
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:18,938
off our backs.

864
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:22,066
<i>We had stuff going on in Florida.</i>

865
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:24,319
Situation down there was changing.

866
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,654
And not for the better.

867
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:30,032
World Jai Alai would like to
introduce its new owner,

868
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:32,535
CEO, and Chief Operating Officer

869
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:34,037
Roger Wheeler.

870
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:36,581
- Roger?
- Thank you, Alan.

871
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:38,750
It's an exciting time for jai alai,

872
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:40,543
and I'm honored to be part of its growth

873
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:42,545
and expansion here in South Florida.

874
00:48:43,046 --> 00:48:46,174
John Callahan has us
poised for great success.

875
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:50,046
<i>I can't believe
people pay to watch this shit.</i>

876
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:51,804
Well, they fucking love it, Stevie.

877
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:53,890
<i>They fucking love to bet on it.</i>

878
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:56,809
<i>That's making us very rich.</i>

879
00:48:56,935 --> 00:48:59,187
But who knows for how much longer
with Wheeler moving in?

880
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:01,481
Guy's a fucking double-barreled prick.

881
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:03,566
But at least we still got this.

882
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,860
Oh, no, no, no.
You give that to Kevin, not me.

883
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,320
<i>All right.</i>

884
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,951
<i>So what's the problem
with this Wheeler guy?</i>

885
00:49:13,076 --> 00:49:14,118
<i>What's his deal?</i>

886
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:17,371
He's got CPAs crawling all up my ass,

887
00:49:17,497 --> 00:49:19,958
and all over the books,
checking every fucking thing.

888
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:22,794
The cash flow, the free meals,
the parking lot receipts.

889
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:24,462
It's just a matter of time
before he finds out

890
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:25,922
how much cash is missing.

891
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:28,758
Just make him an offer for the company.

892
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:30,301
I tried. Won't sell.

893
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:33,388
Would his widow sell?

894
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:39,352
<i>Maybe she could be persuaded.</i>

895
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,437
<i>Maybe Balloonhead over here,</i>

896
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:43,064
you could do us a favor.

897
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:44,315
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

898
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:47,986
Sure. Whatever you say, Stevie.

899
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:50,613
But, you know,
there must be some other way.

900
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,031
Yeah, but, you don't get rid of him,

901
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,200
how's he supposed to go away?

902
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:56,619
<i>What's the downside
of this thing, John?</i>

903
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:58,871
<i>There's no downside, Stevie.</i>

904
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:01,833
<i>The upside is,
we get our cut and keep printing money.</i>

905
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:04,836
I mean, what's to connect you
to anything that happens to Wheeler?

906
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:06,879
He lives in Tulsa, for fuck's sake.

907
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,260
Everybody knows we have World Jai Alai.

908
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:13,720
Who's "everybody"?

909
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:15,847
We're fucking everybody.

910
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:17,765
Brian.

911
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:20,749
Take the bag, I want you to have it.

912
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:25,857
Yeah. I want you to have it.

913
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:27,900
No.

914
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:29,360
<i>Lot of money in that bag, Jimmy.</i>

915
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:32,113
I know exactly how much
money's in that fucking bag.

916
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:34,949
Brian, take the bag, and get out of here.

917
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,661
To do the hit on Wheeler?

918
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:39,871
No.

919
00:50:39,996 --> 00:50:42,582
That's $20,000

920
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:45,293
for you to not do the hit.

921
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,089
I don't get it.

922
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:52,216
Take the money,
keep your fucking mouth shut

923
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:53,634
about what you just heard.

924
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:57,305
It's best you're not involved.
Take the fucking money.

925
00:50:57,472 --> 00:50:59,974
Take the fucking money.
Take the fucking money.

926
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:03,394
Okay.

927
00:51:06,022 --> 00:51:07,148
Um...

928
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,902
So, I should go now?

929
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:13,362
Yeah, you should go now.

930
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:18,659
Thank you.

931
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:20,661
You're welcome.

932
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,837
Hey, listen, I know you guys
have your ways

933
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:31,839
and everything like that, don't you?

934
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:35,635
But don't ever hand me a bag
of fucking money in public.

935
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,888
Ah, I'm sorry, Jimmy.
I just... I thought that...

936
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,640
No, I know. I get it. It's all right.

937
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:43,184
Don't sweat it. But, I mean...

938
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:47,105
All right. Never again.

939
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:48,856
But we're good with Wheeler?

940
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:50,191
Right?

941
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:08,835
- Afternoon, Mr. Wheeler!
- Hi!

942
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,027
Roger Wheeler?

943
00:52:43,411 --> 00:52:44,746
<i>What the fuck is this</i>

944
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,373
<i>jai alai thing that
Whitey's got his fingers into</i>

945
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:49,417
<i>all of a sudden? What is this bullshit?</i>

946
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:51,419
<i>"MAN". That's the word on the street.</i>

947
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:53,588
<i>Looks like a stupid
fucking game, you ask me.</i>

948
00:52:53,713 --> 00:52:55,089
<i>Yeah, Well, I'll tell ya.</i>

949
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:56,590
<i>I don't picture Bulger
going all the way out</i>

1262
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:18,006
- Well, he's a good man.
- Mmm.

1263
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:25,013
I remember sitting at
this very table with you,

1264
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:28,516
some 20 years ago,
working on my first campaign.

1265
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:33,396
I was stuffing envelopes,
and licking stamps

1266
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:35,148
until my tongue was dry.

1267
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:39,486
- Oh, Jesus, we were just kids.
- Mmm-hmm.

1268
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:41,363
Now look at us.

1269
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:50,163
John.

1270
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:52,707
I'm very sorry for your loss, Jimmy.

1271
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:54,709
Your mother was a good woman.

1272
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:56,169
Thanks.

1273
01:10:56,878 --> 01:11:00,548
Well, I'll let you guys have some time.

1274
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:03,176
God bless.

1275
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:25,031
It's so quiet.

1276
01:11:31,413 --> 01:11:33,915
Never heard this house so quiet.

1277
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:40,088
<i>First his son died,
then his mother passed.</i>

1278
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:43,383
<i>And Jimmy was devastated.</i>

1279
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:46,136
<i>He was never the same.</i>

1280
01:11:46,261 --> 01:11:47,762
<i>The only time he ever seemed happy</i>

1281
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,764
<i>was when he was talking about the IRA.</i>

1282
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,437
<i>How you doing?</i>

1283
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:57,564
Jimmy Bulger, Joe Cahill.

1284
01:11:57,731 --> 01:11:59,232
I know who Jimmy is.

1285
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:01,318
And I know who Joe Cahill is.

1286
01:12:01,443 --> 01:12:02,610
It's a real pleasure, sir.

1287
01:12:02,736 --> 01:12:04,571
- Thank you, Jimmy.
- Come on in, Joe.

1288
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:06,364
We're really deep in it, Jimmy,

1289
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:08,074
and we're gonna need your help.

1290
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:09,242
Well, you're gonna get it.

1291
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:10,535
<i>Police had led virtual siege</i>

1292
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,078
<i>to the IRA man's home,</i>

1293
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:14,789
<i>obviously determined not to
let the provos stage a repeat</i>

1294
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:17,000
<i>of the paramilitary funeral
they gave his cousin</i>

1295
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:18,460
<i>shot by the SAS two weeks ago.</i>

1296
01:12:18,585 --> 01:12:20,670
So, you can see what we're up against.

1297
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:22,255
It's pure evil.

1298
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:24,674
Joe, on my honor,

1299
01:12:25,133 --> 01:12:26,634
I can promise that you will have

1300
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:27,844
the biggest weapons cache

1301
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:30,305
you ever laid your Irish eyes on.

1302
01:12:30,472 --> 01:12:31,556
I have to tell you,

1303
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:33,767
that would be
a rather large arsenal, indeed.

1304
01:12:34,601 --> 01:12:36,603
<i>We're not choirboys.</i>

1305
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:40,315
L want you to know
I'm here for you, always.

1306
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:43,151
The old country thanks you, Jimmy.

1307
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:48,323
<i>- Sláinte.
- Sláinte.</i>

1308
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:50,342
Say <i>cheese!</i>

1309
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:51,743
Hey, thanks for all your support.

1310
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:54,371
Jerry, Jerry. Oh.

1311
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:58,041
Congratulations. And a hell of a career.

1312
01:12:58,166 --> 01:12:59,501
Hey. Thank you, John.

1313
01:12:59,626 --> 01:13:00,919
And same for you, huh?

1314
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:03,254
Raise, promotion, the whole shebang.

1315
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:06,049
Ah, enough about me.
What's next for you, champ?

1316
01:13:06,174 --> 01:13:08,635
To tell you the truth,
I don't really care.

1317
01:13:08,802 --> 01:13:10,428
Enough of this public sector shit.

1318
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:12,305
I'm starting my own defense practice.

1319
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:13,556
Start making real money.

1320
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:15,100
I don't blame you.

1321
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:17,185
- Best of luck with that.
- Mmm.

1322
01:13:17,477 --> 01:13:19,521
And you're leaving us in
the hands of a new prosecutor.

1323
01:13:19,646 --> 01:13:20,730
- Yeah.
- Who is he?

1324
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:22,482
Fred Wyshak.

1325
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:24,732
<i>Fucking bulldog who was
kicking ass down in Jersey,</i>

1326
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:26,653
<i>but returned to save his hometown.</i>

1327
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:28,071
<i>Sound familiar?</i>

1328
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:32,492
- Keep doing what you're doing.
- I will.

1329
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:34,339
A lot of people
are very sad to see you go.

1330
01:13:34,411 --> 01:13:35,453
Thanks for coming, John.

1331
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:37,080
- Take care.
- You too.

1332
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:46,798
<i>This is so fucking sick.</i>

1333
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:49,551
You're sick, Stevie.

1334
01:13:50,218 --> 01:13:52,512
What the fuck was in your mind
when you decided

1335
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,264
that your girlfriend's daughter,

1336
01:13:54,389 --> 01:13:56,683
who happens to call you "Daddy,"

1337
01:13:56,808 --> 01:13:59,060
was a good choice to suck your cock?

1338
01:13:59,811 --> 01:14:01,146
Stepdaughter.

1339
01:14:01,271 --> 01:14:03,314
Don't correct me, Stevie.

1340
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,899
Not now.

1341
01:14:05,275 --> 01:14:07,527
And she's a fucking prostitute,
is that correct?

1342
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,362
Jimmy, you know she's a prostitute.

1343
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:12,449
Do not assume what I do or do not know.

1344
01:14:12,574 --> 01:14:14,117
You answer my fucking question.

1345
01:14:14,242 --> 01:14:16,411
Is she or is she not a prostitute?

1346
01:14:16,536 --> 01:14:17,745
Correct.

1347
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:23,042
And she's a fucking hopeless
drug addict as well. Huh?

1348
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:25,545
Little whores on drugs that talk

1349
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:26,963
don't make me feel any better.

1350
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:28,256
Hi.

1351
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:30,967
She may know a few things
she shouldn't have.

1352
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:32,260
I'm sorry.

1353
01:14:33,428 --> 01:14:35,930
You fucking better be sorry, pal.

1354
01:14:38,725 --> 01:14:41,311
- Hi!
- How you doin'?

1355
01:14:45,899 --> 01:14:47,442
Is this for me?

1356
01:14:47,859 --> 01:14:49,527
<i>Every stitch.</i>

1357
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:52,071
This is wicked shit!

1358
01:14:53,031 --> 01:14:54,908
Yeah, it is wicked shit.

1359
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:56,659
So where are we going?

1360
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:57,994
Well...

1361
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:00,205
Not far.

1362
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:02,999
We found a place
where you could stay a while.

1363
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:05,126
It's very comfortable, you know.

1364
01:15:05,627 --> 01:15:08,463
Quiet. Nobody's gonna bother you.

1365
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:09,964
Sounds great.

1366
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:15,386
But before we leave, I, uh,
I have a few questions.

1367
01:15:16,179 --> 01:15:18,264
Sure. What do you wanna know?

1368
01:15:18,765 --> 01:15:20,141
<i>What did you just talk about?</i>

1369
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:21,267
<i>Me?</i>

1370
01:15:21,935 --> 01:15:23,269
Yeah, you.

1371
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:24,979
With who?

1372
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:28,399
Deborah, sweetheart, you just spent

1373
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:30,360
the fucking night in the can.

1374
01:15:30,485 --> 01:15:31,569
Yeah.

1375
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:34,155
Okay, so, where the fuck
did you sleep last night?

1376
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,950
- There.
- And what the fuck is that?

1377
01:15:38,952 --> 01:15:41,371
- Police station.
- And who would you be talking to

1378
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:43,248
in a goddamn police station, Deborah?

1379
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:46,918
The police?

1380
01:15:47,502 --> 01:15:49,003
Exactly.

1381
01:15:50,088 --> 01:15:52,507
So what did the police say to you

1382
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:55,468
and what did you say back to them?

1383
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:58,513
Nothing much.

1384
01:15:58,638 --> 01:15:59,847
The usual.

1385
01:16:00,515 --> 01:16:02,767
What is the fucking usual?
I don't know the usual.

1386
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:04,394
What's the fucking usual?

1387
01:16:04,519 --> 01:16:05,728
<i>You know. Drugs are bad.</i>

1388
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:08,273
Prostitution's illegal. Shit like that.

1389
01:16:09,649 --> 01:16:13,486
And did Stevie and I figure
into this conversation at all?

1390
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:17,240
They asked if I was involved with you.

1391
01:16:17,365 --> 01:16:20,243
<i>I said no. They asked if I was
involved with Stevie too.</i>

1392
01:16:20,368 --> 01:16:21,411
<i>I said no.</i>

1393
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:24,247
That part was actually a lie,

1394
01:16:24,414 --> 01:16:26,040
- obviously.
- Obviously.

1395
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:30,128
So what did they want to know
about Stevie and I?

1396
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:33,506
If I'd seen you commit any crimes.

1397
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:37,135
And drugs. They think
you're selling a lotta drugs.

1398
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:39,137
- Do they?
- Yeah.

1399
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:40,930
And what did you tell them?

1400
01:16:41,389 --> 01:16:43,099
That you didn't.

1401
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:45,518
That you hang out at Triple O's.

1402
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:47,937
That you was real clean,
your clothes was real clean,

1403
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:51,065
you hardly drink any liquor,
you don't do drugs.

1404
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:52,859
And that you always say,
"Don't believe what you read"

1405
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:54,611
"in the fucking papers."

1406
01:16:54,736 --> 01:16:56,279
That was good, right?

1407
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,240
You said all that?

1408
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:00,575
Yeah.

1409
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:02,702
It was good, yeah?

1410
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:05,830
- Yeah, you done good.
- Yeah.

1411
01:17:07,415 --> 01:17:09,208
All right, let's head over.

1412
01:17:09,334 --> 01:17:11,669
You know how to get there, Stevie, right?

1413
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:25,475
Thanks, Stevie.

1414
01:17:27,018 --> 01:17:28,227
Wow!

1415
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:32,440
Oh.

1416
01:17:33,024 --> 01:17:34,442
Oh, my God.

1417
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:36,110
This is amazing!

1418
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:37,695
Yeah, I thought you might like it.

1419
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:40,573
- Yeah!
- A big kitchen there, right?

1420
01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:41,908
Fuck.

1421
01:17:43,951 --> 01:17:44,952
Wow.

1422
01:17:49,749 --> 01:17:52,085
We'll have some furniture
brought in, you know?

1423
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:53,419
Super comfy stuff.

1424
01:17:53,544 --> 01:17:55,129
Sure.

1425
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:57,048
Oh, my God, it's huge!

1426
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:58,216
Yeah.

1427
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:01,719
Wow.

1428
01:18:06,516 --> 01:18:09,602
You know, this was real sweet
of you to think of me, Jimmy.

1429
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:11,354
Don't mention it.

1430
01:18:11,479 --> 01:18:14,023
No one's never done nothing
like this for me before.

1431
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:15,566
Oh, come on, kid, don't say that.

1432
01:18:15,692 --> 01:18:17,694
You're breaking my fucking heart.

1433
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:20,279
No!

1434
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:23,991
Stop, please! No, please!

1435
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:27,787
Fuck! Jimmy! Don't!

1436
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:33,960
<i>Jimmy! Please!</i>

1437
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:11,831
Clean up your fucking mess.

1438
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:14,667
<i>I'm taking a nap.</i>

1439
01:19:15,168 --> 01:19:17,754
<i>We got dinner at Connolly's in an hour.</i>

1440
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:37,898
<i>"OLSEN". Mr. Flemmi, did you ever see.</i>

1441
01:19:38,024 --> 01:19:40,067
<i>Whitey Bulger murder anyone?</i>

1442
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:53,789
<i>I don't know, I thought
Boggs had</i> a <i>good game last night.</i>

1443
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:55,541
<i>He hit Well.</i>

1444
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:05,134
<i>They're not headed
here, don't worry about it.</i>

1445
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,220
Look great.

1446
01:20:09,263 --> 01:20:11,023
Don't touch them skewers
with your fuckin'...

1447
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:12,558
Honey.

1448
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:15,895
- Is the oven on?
- Mmm-hmm.

1449
01:20:19,899 --> 01:20:22,443
Could you at least pretend
to be nice to them,

1450
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:23,903
may the part?

1451
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:26,781
John, I'm very uncomfortable here.

1452
01:20:26,906 --> 01:20:28,658
Okay? We've lived with this for years,

1453
01:20:28,783 --> 01:20:29,823
but never in my own house.

1454
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:30,952
They can see you.

1455
01:20:31,077 --> 01:20:32,787
I don't give a shit if they can see me,

1456
01:20:32,912 --> 01:20:34,433
it's my fucking kitchen!

1457
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:36,624
I mean, you have to be
breaking a rule here, no?

1458
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:38,390
You can't be socializing with these guys.

1459
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:40,711
- It's gotta be against regulations.
- I am not socializing. I am...

1460
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:42,997
What do you call drinking
fucking beers, eating steaks?

1461
01:20:43,089 --> 01:20:44,465
I'm maintaining my relationship

1462
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:45,842
- with my informant.
- Ha!

1463
01:20:45,967 --> 01:20:47,176
That relationship

1464
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:49,095
is the prime reason
I keep getting promoted,

1465
01:20:49,262 --> 01:20:50,862
which is why we live in this fancy house

1466
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:52,974
and you drive that brand new car
that you so desperately wanted.

1467
01:20:53,099 --> 01:20:55,268
That's how you wanna play this, John, huh?

1468
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:56,727
- You keep your voice down.
- Fuck you!

1469
01:20:56,853 --> 01:20:59,480
Fuck you, keep my voice down.
This is my kitchen.

1470
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:01,107
It's your kitchen.

1471
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:04,819
Don't even fucking start with that, okay?

1472
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:07,113
I'll be in our room. I'll be in our room

1473
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,906
with the door locked. Shut up.

1474
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:10,366
Fuck.

1475
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:23,028
Stevie, what's the matter with you?

1476
01:21:23,129 --> 01:21:24,422
You're quiet tonight, huh?

1477
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:28,843
You got a problem with people
keeping their mouths shut?

1478
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:30,970
I'm breaking your balls. Hmm.

1479
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:36,183
Do yourself a favor, don't.

1480
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:40,187
So, uh, guys.

1481
01:21:41,731 --> 01:21:42,857
Uh...

1482
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:46,861
I hate to bring this up
at a social dinner,

1483
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:50,031
<i>but there's this detective in Florida
that keeps calling us</i>

1484
01:21:50,156 --> 01:21:51,198
<i>about Callahan.</i>

1485
01:21:51,324 --> 01:21:53,159
<i>Asking questions, and...</i>

1486
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:57,371
Well, he just won't leave it alone,
and I have to handle it.

1487
01:21:57,997 --> 01:21:59,540
Then handle it.

1488
01:22:02,168 --> 01:22:03,336
Handle it.

1489
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:04,545
Well...

1490
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:06,505
Yeah.

1491
01:22:08,883 --> 01:22:09,926
And, Morris,

1492
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:15,598
you and I gotta have
a little sit-down here.

1493
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:22,730
What the fuck did you
marinate this steak in?

1494
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:25,942
Because it's outta this world.
You're killing me with it.

1495
01:22:26,067 --> 01:22:28,027
Now, now, now.

1496
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:30,446
It's a family secret. Hmm.

1497
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:33,699
Come on!

1498
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:34,867
Oh!

1499
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:38,955
That is one of the best goddamn steaks
lever had in my life.

1500
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:40,706
Even.

1501
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:47,088
I got a knife over here.

1502
01:22:47,213 --> 01:22:48,881
Oh, come on, come on.

1503
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:50,216
What's the... What's the...

1504
01:22:50,341 --> 01:22:52,218
What's the family's secret recipe?

1505
01:22:52,385 --> 01:22:55,930
It's ground garlic
and a little bit of soy.

1506
01:22:57,348 --> 01:23:00,017
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it. That's it.

1507
01:23:03,938 --> 01:23:05,064
Hmm.

1508
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:10,444
I thought it was a family secret.

1509
01:23:13,781 --> 01:23:15,992
It's a recipe.

1510
01:23:16,117 --> 01:23:17,243
No.

1511
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:20,079
No.

1512
01:23:21,122 --> 01:23:23,749
You said to me this is a family secret,

1513
01:23:23,958 --> 01:23:27,169
and you gave it up to me,
boom,

1514
01:23:27,294 --> 01:23:29,588
just fucking like that.

1515
01:23:31,132 --> 01:23:32,299
Don't look to John,

1516
01:23:32,425 --> 01:23:34,885
'cause he's not gonna fucking help you.

1517
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:43,102
You spill the secret family recipe today,

1518
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:45,813
maybe you fucking spill about me tomorrow.

1519
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:48,524
Is that something, maybe,
that's a possibility?

1520
01:23:48,649 --> 01:23:49,729
<i>I was just saying...</i>

1521
01:23:49,775 --> 01:23:51,110
You were "just sayin" '?

1522
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:54,280
"Just sayin" ' gets people sent
to Allenwood.

1523
01:23:55,448 --> 01:23:57,283
"Just sayin"'

1524
01:23:57,575 --> 01:24:00,870
got me a nine-year stretch
in Leavenworth and Alcatraz.

1525
01:24:00,995 --> 01:24:02,455
You understand?

1526
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:05,499
So, "just sayin"

1527
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:10,796
could get you buried real fucking quick.

1528
01:24:29,148 --> 01:24:30,691
Look at his fucking face!

1529
01:24:31,358 --> 01:24:33,694
<i>Hey! I'm fucking with you.</i>

1530
01:24:34,153 --> 01:24:35,446
<i>I'm fucking with you.</i>

1531
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:37,656
It's a recipe. Couldn't give a shit.

1532
01:24:37,782 --> 01:24:40,159
Tastes great. I'm fucking with you.

1533
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:45,998
You got... Well, you got me too.

1534
01:24:46,749 --> 01:24:49,001
Listen, I wanna make a toast.

1535
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,088
To success.

1536
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:55,841
Just getting started.

1537
01:25:03,182 --> 01:25:04,350
Mmm.

1538
01:25:04,809 --> 01:25:06,477
Where's the wife?

1539
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:07,812
She's, uh...

1540
01:25:07,937 --> 01:25:11,023
She's resting.
She's a little under the weather.

1541
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:13,692
Didn't...

1542
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:15,694
Didn't I just see her?

1543
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:17,863
Yeah, she was helping. She, uh...

1544
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:20,533
Well, she's not feeling very good.

1545
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:21,867
Oh, gee.

1546
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:23,244
Like a...

1547
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:26,205
You know what? I'll go have a look at her.

1548
01:25:26,539 --> 01:25:30,001
Jimmy. Jimmy! She's sick!
She's fi... Listen, fine.

1549
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:51,897
Oh.

1550
01:25:52,022 --> 01:25:54,191
I thought you were John.

1551
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:56,735
No, it ain't John.

1552
01:25:57,570 --> 01:25:59,572
Come on. Come down and join us.

1553
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:02,700
I'm not feeling well. Thank you, though.

1554
01:26:03,993 --> 01:26:05,473
Marianne, you know what you're doing?

1555
01:26:05,536 --> 01:26:06,620
You're embarrassing your husband

1556
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:09,540
in front of his friends,
that's what you're doing.

1557
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:12,251
And you know that's what you're doing.

1558
01:26:12,918 --> 01:26:14,086
I don't know what John told you,

1559
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:15,671
but I'm feeling ill.

1560
01:26:17,882 --> 01:26:19,091
That's all.

1561
01:26:19,592 --> 01:26:21,343
Please, no offense.

1562
01:26:24,388 --> 01:26:25,764
Well, let's see what you got.

1563
01:26:27,433 --> 01:26:28,434
Um...

1564
01:26:30,436 --> 01:26:31,604
Yeah.

1565
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:36,317
Well...

1566
01:26:37,735 --> 01:26:39,904
You don't feel warm.

1567
01:26:42,156 --> 01:26:43,866
Got any chills?

1568
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:46,619
'Cause normally, you get the chills

1569
01:26:46,785 --> 01:26:48,829
before the flu comes on, you know?

1570
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:54,960
Any soreness there?

1571
01:26:57,296 --> 01:27:00,508
What are you feelin' there?
You feel something?

1572
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:06,513
'Cause I don't feel
any swollen glands there.

1573
01:27:08,474 --> 01:27:13,896
But you know, me,
I had to learn the hard way

1574
01:27:15,648 --> 01:27:18,484
not to take chances
with this kind of thing.

1575
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:20,653
You know what I'm saying?

1576
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:24,365
Poor little thing.

1577
01:27:25,699 --> 01:27:27,201
You get some rest.

1578
01:27:27,743 --> 01:27:30,246
Wouldn't want nothing to happen to you.

1579
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:42,341
John's a lucky man.

1580
01:28:14,498 --> 01:28:15,791
Jimmy?

1581
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:19,253
I'll get it there safe and sound.

1582
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:21,422
You can sleep on it.

1583
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:25,551
I know you will, Mclntyre.
Have safe travels, huh?

1584
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:27,344
All right.

1585
01:28:28,137 --> 01:28:30,681
- Stevie.
- Take care of it, John.

1586
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:33,100
Weeksy, give me a call.

1587
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:35,477
Thanks for everything, Jimmy.
We won't forget it.

1588
01:28:35,602 --> 01:28:36,979
For me, it's an honor.

1589
01:28:37,104 --> 01:28:38,605
The honor's ours.

1590
01:28:38,981 --> 01:28:40,399
Thanks, pal.

1591
01:28:57,166 --> 01:28:58,751
<i>"CONNOLLY". Hope I'm not interruptin'!</i>

1592
01:28:59,001 --> 01:29:00,878
Special Agent John Connolly.

1593
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:02,087
I know who you are.

1594
01:29:02,212 --> 01:29:04,631
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Good things, I hope.

1595
01:29:04,757 --> 01:29:08,010
Listen, little Welcome Wagon
present for you. Big game.

1596
01:29:08,135 --> 01:29:09,136
I'm <i>good.</i>

1597
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:10,262
Are you sure about that?

1598
01:29:10,429 --> 01:29:11,555
Clemens is on the mound tonight.

1599
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,182
I'm sure about that.

1600
01:29:13,474 --> 01:29:14,600
All right.

1601
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:16,310
Work, work, work.

1602
01:29:16,477 --> 01:29:18,437
Well, listen, after... After you finish,

1603
01:29:18,604 --> 01:29:20,105
come down to the Bell-In-Hand.

1604
01:29:20,481 --> 01:29:21,565
I would like to buy you a pint,

1605
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:24,443
and you can meet some of the other agents.

1606
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:29,114
Do you have a case for me, Agent Connolly?

1607
01:29:29,782 --> 01:29:32,451
No, I just came to introduce myself.

1608
01:29:32,618 --> 01:29:35,079
You know, couple of local boys
moving up the ranks.

1609
01:29:35,204 --> 01:29:37,331
Maybe we can help each other along.

1610
01:29:38,374 --> 01:29:40,959
Bring me cases,
that's all the help I need.

1611
01:29:42,211 --> 01:29:43,295
All right.

1612
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:47,841
All right, well,
I'll leave you to it, then.

1613
01:29:47,966 --> 01:29:49,426
Hey, you know, since you're here.

1614
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:50,803
Yeah?

1615
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:53,222
How come no one has nailed Whitey Bulger?

1616
01:29:53,347 --> 01:29:55,099
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1617
01:29:55,224 --> 01:29:57,309
That won't work.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1618
01:29:57,684 --> 01:29:59,853
<i>Excuse me'?
Now, what's Bulger done?</i>

1619
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:04,065
He's a smalltime hood,
but he's an invaluable asset.

1620
01:30:05,025 --> 01:30:06,693
What's he done?

1621
01:30:07,569 --> 01:30:09,738
Everything, evidently.

1622
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:12,324
Drugs, extortion, murder.

1623
01:30:12,991 --> 01:30:15,202
I'd heard rumors,
but these other informant reports

1624
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:16,370
make it clear.

1625
01:30:16,495 --> 01:30:17,788
And here's the thing, every time we start

1626
01:30:17,913 --> 01:30:19,581
a formal investigation, poof!

1627
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,167
Goes away. He slips free.

1628
01:30:22,668 --> 01:30:24,044
How do you account for that?

1629
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:25,838
I don't know.

1630
01:30:26,505 --> 01:30:28,048
Luck of the Irish.

1631
01:30:28,173 --> 01:30:30,384
"Luck of the lrish"?

1632
01:30:30,509 --> 01:30:32,094
That's what you're going with?

1633
01:30:32,219 --> 01:30:33,512
Well, it's...

1634
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:37,182
It's slander and lies

1635
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:39,810
from his brother Billy's
political opponents.

1636
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:41,311
These fucking assholes

1637
01:30:41,437 --> 01:30:43,677
<i>from Cambridge, they will do
anything to bring Billy down</i>

1638
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:45,274
<i>because they can't stand</i>

1639
01:30:45,399 --> 01:30:47,651
power in the hands of a mick from Southie.

1640
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:50,336
You don't think Billy's protecting
his older brother, just maybe?

1641
01:30:50,446 --> 01:30:51,905
No! No way.

1642
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:53,407
<i>Really?</i>

1643
01:30:54,032 --> 01:30:56,832
Well, seems to me you'd have to
believe in fuckin' leprechauns to think

1644
01:30:56,869 --> 01:30:59,538
we'd have the biggest crime lord in Boston

1645
01:30:59,663 --> 01:31:03,041
and be brothers with
the most powerful politician in the state,

1646
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:05,878
and them not be helping each other out.

1647
01:31:06,044 --> 01:31:08,880
I grew up with Billy, Southie.

1648
01:31:09,006 --> 01:31:10,757
Sol know him,

1649
01:31:10,883 --> 01:31:13,218
I know that he knows
that it would be crazy for him

1650
01:31:13,343 --> 01:31:15,929
to get mixed up in
anything that Jimmy does.

1651
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:18,182
It's, you know, too brazen.

1652
01:31:18,891 --> 01:31:20,642
I'll ask you again.

1653
01:31:20,767 --> 01:31:23,395
How come no one has done Whitey Bulger?

1654
01:31:23,562 --> 01:31:26,148
He seems to be involved
in every crime in the city

1655
01:31:26,273 --> 01:31:28,317
<i>and yet the Bureau
keeps saying he's clean.</i>

1656
01:31:28,442 --> 01:31:30,819
<i>It's only when another agency
has an informant</i>

1657
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:33,405
that I hear maybe Whitey
isn't so squeaky clean.

1658
01:31:35,782 --> 01:31:37,409
Well, I hear that he's very careful,

1659
01:31:37,576 --> 01:31:40,245
he doesn't use phones,
that kinda stuff, and, uh...

1660
01:31:41,914 --> 01:31:44,208
Who did you say
these other informants were?

1661
01:31:45,209 --> 01:31:46,543
I didn't.

1662
01:31:49,421 --> 01:31:51,507
Listen, from what I hear,

1663
01:31:51,632 --> 01:31:53,675
his criminal days are all but over.

1664
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,844
His partner and him, they gone legit...

1665
01:31:55,969 --> 01:31:57,638
Christ, Connolly, you fucking with me?

1666
01:31:57,763 --> 01:32:00,140
<i>Is Whitey never using phones and careful,</i>

1667
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:01,767
or is Whitey retired?

1668
01:32:01,975 --> 01:32:03,435
I don't...

1669
01:32:04,478 --> 01:32:06,480
I mean, I just... I'm not in my office...

1670
01:32:06,605 --> 01:32:07,940
These are things that I hear,

1671
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:09,316
<i>I don't know if all of them are true...</i>

1672
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:11,735
Do your job and find out!

1673
01:32:15,113 --> 01:32:16,823
I am, lam. I...

1674
01:32:18,617 --> 01:32:20,285
<i>"CONNOLLY". You know I wouldn't come here</i>

1675
01:32:20,452 --> 01:32:21,954
if it wasn't serious.

1676
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:24,665
If there was anywhere else
I could turn, and I know that

1677
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:27,459
the last thing you need is
to have Jimmy's business

1678
01:32:27,584 --> 01:32:28,835
crossing paths with yours.

1679
01:32:28,961 --> 01:32:30,963
Your grasp of the situation is so keen,

1680
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:32,631
it makes me wonder what you're doing here.

1681
01:32:32,798 --> 01:32:34,300
This new guy, Wyshak,

1682
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:36,051
has a serious hard-on

1683
01:32:36,176 --> 01:32:37,177
for Jimmy.

1684
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:38,971
And that can't be good for any of us.

1685
01:32:39,137 --> 01:32:40,378
And you're telling me this why?

1686
01:32:40,514 --> 01:32:42,307
Maybe you can influence him.

1687
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:44,643
<i>Make him listen to reason!</i>

1688
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:46,091
I'm not kissing your ass, Billy,

1689
01:32:46,144 --> 01:32:48,480
but you are the most
powerful man in the city.

1690
01:32:48,647 --> 01:32:49,982
Not that I would, but Wyshak's federal

1691
01:32:50,107 --> 01:32:51,441
and I'm state, and you know that.

1692
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:54,820
But where we come from, I know

1693
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:59,157
and you know that what is
written on a piece of paper

1694
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:02,286
is less important than blood

1695
01:33:02,411 --> 01:33:03,829
and honor

1696
01:33:04,496 --> 01:33:05,998
and loyalty.

1697
01:33:09,668 --> 01:33:11,503
I'm not asking you to help me.

1698
01:33:12,838 --> 01:33:15,257
I'm asking you to help your brother.

1699
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:20,178
That's the same thing now, isn't it?

1700
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:32,858
Billy?

1701
01:33:35,319 --> 01:33:38,948
Wyshak is asking questions about you too.

1702
01:33:41,992 --> 01:33:43,118
Oh.

1703
01:33:50,167 --> 01:33:53,211
John, you know I have
the utmost respect for you.

1704
01:33:53,337 --> 01:33:55,213
Really, I do, which is why I can tell you

1705
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:57,341
with all my heart

1706
01:33:57,466 --> 01:33:59,551
that if you ever come into my office again

1707
01:33:59,676 --> 01:34:01,386
with a fucked-up idea like that,

1708
01:34:01,553 --> 01:34:04,973
you'll rue the day you ever
thought of joining the FBI.

1709
01:34:10,562 --> 01:34:12,397
Jeannie will show you out.

1710
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:23,527
<i>This report has
information attributed to</i>

1711
01:34:23,575 --> 01:34:26,161
our prized informant, Whitey Bulger.

1712
01:34:29,915 --> 01:34:32,209
And this is the same piece of information

1713
01:34:32,334 --> 01:34:34,211
from one of our other informants,

1714
01:34:34,336 --> 01:34:35,879
dated four weeks earlier.

1715
01:34:40,175 --> 01:34:41,677
This is information credited

1716
01:34:41,802 --> 01:34:43,887
to our supposedly prized informant,

1717
01:34:44,012 --> 01:34:45,681
James "Whitey" Bulger.

1718
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:51,937
<i>And the same piece of information</i>

1719
01:34:52,104 --> 01:34:55,524
dated six weeks earlier,
different informant.

1720
01:34:57,526 --> 01:34:59,403
<i>In fact, if you take a look
at Bulger's pile,</i>

1721
01:34:59,569 --> 01:35:00,904
<i>you'll find the same situation</i>

1722
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:02,790
<i>played out time and again
from other sources.</i>

1723
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:06,785
In fact, you'll find
very little from Bulger

1724
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:08,537
that means shit.

1725
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:18,755
<i>Customs officials in Boston
say they have seized a trawler</i>

1726

<i>used to smuggle weapons
to Irish terrorists.</i>

1727
01:35:21,675 --> 01:35:22,926
<i>Agents say the trawler ferried</i>

1728
01:35:23,051 --> 01:35:24,803
<i>a load of arms and ammunition</i>

<i>- to the Irish coast last week.
- Jesus fucking Christ.</i>

1730
01:35:26,722 --> 01:35:29,224
<i>The weapons were intercepted
by the Irish Navy</i>

1731
01:35:29,349 --> 01:35:31,310
<i>after they had been
transferred to a smaller ship.</i>

1732

<i>Officials say they have seized

- and other doc...
- Motherfucker.

1734
01:35:35,147 --> 01:35:36,815
Northern Ireland?

1735
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:38,275
Yeah.

1736
01:35:40,527 --> 01:35:42,087
Well, how did they know about the ship?

1737
01:35:42,195 --> 01:35:43,321
The pilot.

1738
01:35:43,447 --> 01:35:45,907
Turns out he's also a snitch
for DEA. Customs, too.

1739
01:35:48,076 --> 01:35:49,077
What's his name?

1740
01:35:50,203 --> 01:35:52,456
- I don't know.
- How do you not know?

1741
01:35:52,998 --> 01:35:54,416
I don't know, John.

1742
01:35:57,878 --> 01:36:00,797
All right, well, where is
this guy now, the pilot?

1743
01:36:01,465 --> 01:36:02,799
I wanna talk to him.

1744
01:36:02,924 --> 01:36:04,009
Oh, no can do.

1745
01:36:04,176 --> 01:36:06,845
What do you mean, "no can do"?
Yes, can do.

1746
01:36:07,012 --> 01:36:08,305
Sorry, he belongs to DEA.

1747
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:10,932
Well... Okay.

1748
01:36:11,183 --> 01:36:13,560
Ask permission for us to talk to him.

1749
01:36:13,727 --> 01:36:15,395
- I did.
- And?

1750
01:36:15,896 --> 01:36:17,939
It's not gonna happen, John.

1751
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:48,231
<i>"McINTYRE". I don't like that guy, though.</i>

1752
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:50,138
<i>He's got a big fucking mouth.</i>

1753
01:36:52,432 --> 01:36:53,683
<i>Yeah, just take</i> a <i>right here.</i>

1754
01:36:53,809 --> 01:36:55,144
MclNTYRE: Yeah? All right.

1755
01:36:55,268 --> 01:36:56,728
Oh, yeah, I got it.

1756
01:36:59,356 --> 01:37:01,775
A-ha! Weeksy, what's up?

1757
01:37:04,194 --> 01:37:06,822
Where is everybody?
I thought it was a fucking party.

1758
01:37:08,907 --> 01:37:10,200
McGUIRE: Bulger's playing us, Nick.

1759
01:37:10,325 --> 01:37:11,660
Making a fool of the Bureau,

1760
01:37:11,785 --> 01:37:13,411
hiding behind his informant status

1761
01:37:13,537 --> 01:37:15,539
to run roughshod over my city.

1762
01:37:15,664 --> 01:37:18,583
Using us to cover for him.
I won't stand for it.

1763
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:20,189
<i>And I am distressed about that.</i>

1764
01:37:20,293 --> 01:37:22,546
<i>But from where I sit,
we have bigger priorities</i>

1765
01:37:22,671 --> 01:37:23,713
<i>to consider.</i>

1766
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,281
So you're telling me to do nothing.

1767
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:26,883
<i>No, not at all.</i>

1768
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:30,428
<i>I'm telling you we can't taint
one of the most successful.</i>

1769
01:37:30,554 --> 01:37:31,596
<i>RICO prosecutions</i>

1770
01:37:31,763 --> 01:37:34,933
<i>in the history of the Bureau
just to get Whitey Bulger,</i>

1771
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:37,060
<i>psychopath or not.</i>

1772
01:37:38,311 --> 01:37:40,605
<i>But we have no objection
to your going after</i>

1773
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:42,732
<i>the agents handling him.</i>

1774
01:37:45,277 --> 01:37:46,695
Can't you see what's happening?

1775
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:48,697
The vise is closing on us.

1776
01:37:49,906 --> 01:37:51,366
Listen to me.

1777
01:37:51,867 --> 01:37:54,244
Did you know it was Hampton and Dawson

1778
01:37:54,411 --> 01:37:56,997
that hit that National Bank on Exeter?

1779
01:37:57,247 --> 01:37:58,373
No.

1780
01:37:58,498 --> 01:38:01,167
And neither did I,
until Whitey Bulger told us.

1781
01:38:01,376 --> 01:38:04,629
- Whitey didn't tell us that.
- Yes, he did.

1782
01:38:04,963 --> 01:38:07,382
Nick McVeigh is running speed

1783
01:38:07,507 --> 01:38:09,259
through high schools in Newton.

1784
01:38:09,426 --> 01:38:11,970
High school kids, for fuck's sake.

1785
01:38:12,804 --> 01:38:14,264
Thank God for Whitey Bulger.

1786
01:38:14,389 --> 01:38:16,391
- Thank God for Whitey Bulger.
- You hear me?

1787
01:38:16,516 --> 01:38:20,061
Whitey introduced dope
to every kid in Southie.

1788
01:38:20,228 --> 01:38:23,356
Twelve and 13-year-old girls, John.

1789
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:26,859
What about Halloran? And Callahan, huh?

1790
01:38:27,068 --> 01:38:29,153
Douchebags who got what was coming to 'em.

1791
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:30,906
It's not our fault.

1792
01:38:31,114 --> 01:38:32,574
It's not our fault?

1793
01:38:32,699 --> 01:38:34,409
- Whose fault is it?
- Not ours.

1794
01:38:34,743 --> 01:38:37,162
That's gonna sound great in court.

1795
01:38:38,622 --> 01:38:40,165
McGuire is gonna go to Washington.

1796
01:38:40,332 --> 01:38:41,958
You know that, right?

1797
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:44,836
And he's gonna bring
all the informant files.

1798
01:38:45,003 --> 01:38:47,088
And Wyshak is dead-set

1799
01:38:47,213 --> 01:38:49,507
on hanging our asses on his wall.

1800
01:38:49,633 --> 01:38:52,802
We are fucked, John. We are fucked.

1801
01:38:52,928 --> 01:38:55,347
Listen to me. The Bureau wants results.

1802
01:38:55,472 --> 01:38:56,848
We gave them results.

1803
01:38:57,015 --> 01:38:59,851
We drove a stake through
the black heart of the Mafia.

1804
01:39:00,143 --> 01:39:02,687
Everything else is gonna be a sideshow.

1805
01:39:02,854 --> 01:39:05,315
Now we're stuck with Whitey,
and without the Italians,

1806
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,524
nobody can rein him in

1807
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:08,526
and we can't even pull on his chain

1808
01:39:08,652 --> 01:39:09,986
because we're in too deep!

1809
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:11,488
And he knows it!

1810
01:39:11,613 --> 01:39:14,491
You understand
what I'm saying about a vise?

1811
01:39:19,579 --> 01:39:21,623
I thought I was doing good.

1812
01:39:22,499 --> 01:39:24,793
I actually thought
I could make a difference.

1813
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:26,002
But we made a difference!

1814
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:27,879
We put the Mafia out of business.

1815
01:39:28,046 --> 01:39:30,715
If that ain't good, I don't know what is.

1816
01:39:31,758 --> 01:39:32,842
Yeah.

1817
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,888
And you know what we're doing now, John?

1818
01:39:37,055 --> 01:39:39,265
Digging our own fucking graves.

1819
01:40:02,288 --> 01:40:03,748
God damn it!

1820
01:40:10,338 --> 01:40:11,715
Marianne!

1821
01:40:15,051 --> 01:40:17,470
Marianne, don't do this!

1822
01:40:21,182 --> 01:40:24,227
Marianne, are you fucking kidding me?

1823
01:40:34,779 --> 01:40:36,579
<i>This informant
has been</i> a <i>minor player</i>

1824
01:40:36,698 --> 01:40:39,367
<i>in the Boston crime syndicate
since he was a teenager.</i>

1825
01:40:39,492 --> 01:40:41,453
<i>- So you checked his house?
- Yes.</i>

1826
01:40:41,578 --> 01:40:42,621
- And <i>work?</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

1827
01:40:42,746 --> 01:40:43,872
And he's never missed

1828
01:40:43,997 --> 01:40:45,790
- an informant meeting before?
- None I'm aware <i>of.</i>

1829
01:40:45,999 --> 01:40:48,043
<i>"- Yeah? AGENT". No, nothing.</i>

You wanna <i>see</i> me?

1831
01:40:49,961 --> 01:40:51,212
<i>Yeah, I wanna see you!</i>

1832
01:40:51,463 --> 01:40:54,507
Mclntyre has vanished off
the face of the fuckin' Earth.

1833
01:40:54,924 --> 01:40:56,634
Which seems to be a common
phenomenon for any informant

1834
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:59,387
that says something incriminating
against Whitey Bulger.

1835
01:41:01,431 --> 01:41:02,751
You got nothing to say, Connolly?

1836
01:41:04,184 --> 01:41:05,894
<i>You see these gentlemen here?</i>

1837
01:41:06,019 --> 01:41:07,937
<i>They're gonna help me get this cocksucker.</i>

1838
01:41:08,063 --> 01:41:10,982
<i>If we have to arrest
every lowlife in Boston to do that,</i>

1839
01:41:11,107 --> 01:41:12,108
we'll arrest them.

1840
01:41:12,233 --> 01:41:14,903
Every loan shark, every bookie,
every drug dealer.

1841
01:41:15,028 --> 01:41:17,489
One of those guys is gonna
make a case against him.

1842
01:41:18,782 --> 01:41:20,992
<i>Of all fucking people.</i>

1843
01:41:23,453 --> 01:41:24,662
You.

1844
01:41:34,255 --> 01:41:35,975
MclNTYRE:
<i>I'm sorry, Jimmy.</i>

1845
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:37,653
You've always been fucking weak, John,

1846
01:41:37,717 --> 01:41:38,843
since we was kids.

1847
01:41:39,135 --> 01:41:40,512
<i>What'd you tell them?</i>

1848
01:41:40,678 --> 01:41:43,723
I don't wanna fuckin' die. Oh, God, Jimmy!

1849
01:41:44,349 --> 01:41:47,143
I need to know exactly
who you fucking talked to,

1850
01:41:47,268 --> 01:41:49,437
and exactly what you said.

1851
01:41:49,562 --> 01:41:52,482
A DEA agent by the name of Brown.

1852
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:54,025
<i>I told him everything!</i>

1853
01:41:54,192 --> 01:41:56,611
The IRA, Cahill, the whole bit!

1854
01:41:57,112 --> 01:41:58,988
I know I shouldn't have, Jimmy,

1855
01:41:59,114 --> 01:42:00,532
but I had no choice!

1856
01:42:03,785 --> 01:42:05,120
Fuck you.

1857
01:42:06,454 --> 01:42:08,706
You always have a choice.

1858
01:42:08,873 --> 01:42:11,376
You just happened to make
the wrong fucking one.

1859
01:42:14,754 --> 01:42:16,131
<i>Look at me.</i>

1860
01:42:18,675 --> 01:42:20,260
I said fucking look at me.

1861
01:42:22,554 --> 01:42:24,639
I've known you a long time.

1862
01:42:25,765 --> 01:42:28,518
And for you to fuck me like this...

1863
01:42:30,937 --> 01:42:32,939
It fucking hurts.

1864
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:39,737
So I'm gonna fucking bury you right here,

1865
01:42:39,904 --> 01:42:42,824
where all the other weak people
have been buried.

1866
01:42:42,949 --> 01:42:44,033
Jimmy, I'm sorry!

1867
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:46,411
But you'll be dead before
Stevie pulls your teeth,

1868
01:42:46,536 --> 01:42:49,080
which is more than you fucking
deserve, I'll tell you that.

1869
01:42:49,205 --> 01:42:50,415
Jimmy, I'm sorry, Jimmy, I'm sorry,

1870
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:52,292
Oh, God, Jimmy, I'm...

1871
01:43:18,234 --> 01:43:19,694
<i>Take out his fucking teeth.</i>

1872
01:43:19,819 --> 01:43:21,654
Bury him next to the whore.

1873
01:43:47,764 --> 01:43:50,058
Special Agent John Morris, FBI.

1874

<i>Gerard O'Neill, Boston Globe.</i>

1875
01:43:52,644 --> 01:43:54,312
Dick Lehr, same.

1876
01:43:54,479 --> 01:43:56,814
Thank you for meeting with us.

1877
01:43:57,649 --> 01:43:59,317
I feel like, uh...

1878
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:05,031
Like I should be in a confessional.

1879
01:44:05,323 --> 01:44:07,992
It's the right thing to do, John.

1880
01:44:10,995 --> 01:44:12,872
Anything I tell you has to be
off the record.

1881
01:44:12,997 --> 01:44:14,082
You understand?

1882
01:44:14,207 --> 01:44:15,208
Of course.

1883
01:44:15,333 --> 01:44:19,295
We'll develop our own sources,
corroborate everything.

1884
01:44:22,966 --> 01:44:24,676
Where do I start?

1885
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:31,432
What do you know?

1886
01:44:31,557 --> 01:44:33,517
<i>- All of it.
- We know.</i>

1887
01:44:33,643 --> 01:44:34,686
And you're running it?

1888
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:37,021
We wouldn't be here if we weren't.

1889
01:45:22,734 --> 01:45:23,901
What?

1890
01:45:26,612 --> 01:45:28,072
What is it, Jim?

1891
01:45:43,921 --> 01:45:45,715
<i>What the fuck, Jim?</i>

1892
01:45:49,427 --> 01:45:51,554
What the fuck... This is bullshit.

1893
01:45:54,265 --> 01:45:56,142
Right? This isn't true.

1894
01:45:57,602 --> 01:45:58,603
Right?

1895
01:46:00,104 --> 01:46:03,483
Kevin, you're gonna hear

1896
01:46:04,275 --> 01:46:08,112
and you're gonna fuckin' read
a lotta bullshit about me.

1897
01:46:08,279 --> 01:46:10,323
A lotta nasty things.

1898
01:46:10,948 --> 01:46:14,786
And most of it, if not all of it,
is fucking untrue.

1899
01:46:14,952 --> 01:46:16,829
It's pure fiction.

1900
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:19,332
You know me.

1901
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:24,420
And you know these people.
You know these fucking people.

1902
01:46:24,962 --> 01:46:26,631
They're liars.

1903
01:46:29,133 --> 01:46:31,761
They ain't got no fucking code of honor.

1904
01:46:35,139 --> 01:46:37,975
How many envelopes of fucking cash

1905
01:46:38,142 --> 01:46:40,812
did you deliver to these Feds?

1906
01:46:41,479 --> 01:46:44,816
How many cases of wine
for that prick Morris?

1907
01:46:45,441 --> 01:46:46,567
Or fucking vacations,

1908
01:46:46,692 --> 01:46:51,155
or, uh, fucking money,
money, money. Fuck it.

1909
01:46:58,621 --> 01:47:01,541
Does that sound like
what an informant does?

1910
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:07,171
Guy ran a sports and numbers
racket out of Heller's Cafe.

1911
01:47:07,338 --> 01:47:08,923
Parlayed it into loan sharking,

1912
01:47:09,048 --> 01:47:10,675
and that into money laundering.

1913
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,177
Says he can give us some big fish.

1914
01:47:13,302 --> 01:47:14,303
Evidence?

1915
01:47:14,846 --> 01:47:16,514
Pictures and sound.

1916
01:47:17,223 --> 01:47:18,724
FBI know anything about this?

1917
01:47:18,891 --> 01:47:20,393
No, but I can call them if you want.

1918
01:47:20,518 --> 01:47:22,228
Absolutely not.

1919
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:24,440
<i>Can you get me
into Witness Protection?</i>

1920
01:47:25,148 --> 01:47:26,649
Depends what you have.

1921
01:47:26,899 --> 01:47:28,693
I have Whitey Bulger.

1922
01:47:29,193 --> 01:47:31,446
So, Whitey Bulger took a piece
of everything you made?

1923
01:47:31,571 --> 01:47:33,322
What, are you fucking kidding me?

1924
01:47:33,573 --> 01:47:35,700
Everything. Wasn't small either.

1925
01:47:35,867 --> 01:47:38,203
Yeah, Whitey introduced drugs to Southie.

1926
01:47:38,369 --> 01:47:39,996
White stuff, brown stuff...

1927
01:47:40,204 --> 01:47:43,499
Cocaine, heroin, marijuana.

1928
01:47:44,417 --> 01:47:46,137
<i>Like I said,
I was a half a block away,</i>

1929
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:48,379
<i>but it was unmistakable what was going on.</i>

1930
01:47:48,546 --> 01:47:50,089
<i>I don't know who it was.</i>

1931
01:47:50,214 --> 01:47:51,924
<i>Pulled him out of a car
and shot him on the fucking...</i>

1932
01:47:52,049 --> 01:47:53,926
<i>Right on the ground.</i>

1933
01:47:57,847 --> 01:47:59,348
It's everything.

1934
01:48:00,016 --> 01:48:01,350
Extortion.

1935
01:48:01,726 --> 01:48:03,269
Racketeering.

1936
01:48:03,686 --> 01:48:05,062
Murder.

1937
01:48:06,022 --> 01:48:08,065
They got you on all of it.

1938
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:11,068
And I guess they got me too.

1939
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:15,698
You used me, Jimmy.

1940
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:19,285
It was an alliance,
John. Nothing more.

1941
01:48:22,914 --> 01:48:24,248
I'll call you in a week.

1942
01:48:24,582 --> 01:48:26,667
Just let me know what you know.

1943
01:48:26,792 --> 01:48:29,378
There's nothing more
I'm gonna know.

1944
01:48:30,254 --> 01:48:31,464
Even.

1945
01:48:38,304 --> 01:48:39,555
Okay.

1946
01:49:10,211 --> 01:49:12,463
- Gentlemen.
- John Connolly?

1947
01:49:12,964 --> 01:49:15,132
Yeah, I'm John Connolly.

1948
01:49:15,299 --> 01:49:17,260
<i>We have a warrant
for your arrest.</i>

1949
01:49:21,138 --> 01:49:22,979
<i>Mr. Connolly, step out
of the building, please.</i>

1950
01:49:25,476 --> 01:49:26,727
Mmm.

1951
01:49:30,273 --> 01:49:31,691
Do me a favor, boys,

1952
01:49:31,816 --> 01:49:33,734
and let me leave with some dignity.

1953
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:36,654
Mr. Connolly, step out
of the building, please.

1954
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:38,656
Mr. Connolly, this way.

1955
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:43,327
Yeah.

1956
01:49:45,663 --> 01:49:47,498
You know, this is, uh...

1957
01:49:47,665 --> 01:49:48,666
Uh...

1958
01:50:15,526 --> 01:50:16,736
Show me your hands!

1959
01:50:16,861 --> 01:50:19,322
Show me your hands! Up in the air!

1960
01:50:19,447 --> 01:50:22,283
Turn around slow.
The other way. The other way!

1961
01:50:23,534 --> 01:50:25,369
<i>Put your hands on your head.</i>

1962
01:50:26,329 --> 01:50:28,289
Put your hands on your head!

1963
01:50:29,707 --> 01:50:32,001
<i>"OLSEN". Mr. Flemmi, now that you</i>

1964
01:50:32,126 --> 01:50:35,212
<i>look back at your time with James Bulger,</i>

1965
01:50:35,504 --> 01:50:38,049
<i>what is your opinion of him?</i>

1966
01:50:45,389 --> 01:50:47,350
Strictly criminal.

1967
01:51:16,337 --> 01:51:17,505
Jimmy?

1968
01:51:18,881 --> 01:51:20,508
Hey, Billy Boy.

1969
01:51:21,217 --> 01:51:23,177
Been reading the papers?

1970
01:51:23,678 --> 01:51:25,554
<i>Not even a little.</i>

1971
01:51:26,013 --> 01:51:27,431
Smart man.

1972
01:51:28,349 --> 01:51:30,351
I wouldn't if I was you.

1973
01:51:31,435 --> 01:51:33,396
Well, listen.

1974
01:51:36,941 --> 01:51:39,443
You're not gonna see me for a while.

1975
01:51:41,278 --> 01:51:43,072
You know? So, uh...

1976
01:51:44,699 --> 01:51:47,118
<i>Just look after yourself, you know.</i>

1977
01:51:47,451 --> 01:51:49,954
You sure you want to do it this way?

1978
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:52,957
<i>Is there any other way?</i>

1979
01:51:58,379 --> 01:51:59,964
Take care, kid.

1980
01:54:38,455 --> 01:54:39,623
<i>"REPORTER". Let's begin this morning...</i>

1981
01:54:39,748 --> 01:54:40,791
<i>FBI, you're under arrest!</i>

1982
01:54:40,916 --> 01:54:42,084
<i>With the breaking news,
the overnight arrest</i>

1983
01:54:42,209 --> 01:54:43,689
<i>of mob boss, James "Whitey" Bulger...</i>

1984
01:54:48,382 --> 01:54:50,342
<i>Last night,
in Santa Monica, California,</i>

1985
01:54:50,467 --> 01:54:51,635
<i>the FBI finally...</i>

1986
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:52,970
<i>He's talking
to federal authorities</i>

1987
01:54:53,137 --> 01:54:55,639
<i>and Bulger will be returned
to Boston to face trial.</i>
