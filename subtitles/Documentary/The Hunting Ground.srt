1
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:42,765
Like, I already know. Like...

2
00:00:47,528 --> 00:00:50,771
I got in. I got in, I got in!

3
00:00:50,865 --> 00:00:55,440
Oh, my God! I got in!

4
00:01:01,543 --> 00:01:03,080
Okay

5
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:14,264
- What? Denied?
- I got in!

6
00:01:26,404 --> 00:01:30,512
Yes! Yes!

7
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:33,852
Boo-yah! Boo-yah!

8
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:36,586
Boo-yah! Yes!

9
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:40,592
"Application status
decision made."

10
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:44,332
I'm sorry, Janelle.
Admitted!

11
00:02:02,678 --> 00:02:05,956
- Oh, my God!
" Yes, Yes, yes!

12
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,221
Whoo!

13
00:03:09,853 --> 00:03:13,198
<i>New students,
as I look out on you today,</i>

14
00:03:13,256 --> 00:03:18,229
<i>I recognize that you must be
feeling incredible excitement,</i>

15
00:03:18,362 --> 00:03:22,276
<i>anticipation, and perhaps</i>
a <i>little relief as well.</i>

16
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:24,870
<i>This is the day.</i>

17
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:30,984
<i>As your parents learned when
they dropped you off today,</i>

18
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:34,490
what happens in college
stays in college.

19
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,890
Most of the time.

20
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,962
<i>Few things are more worthy
of celebration</i>

21
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,166
than the entry of a new class
of students into the university.

22
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:52,302
You have strengths
and skills and smarts

23
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,903
<i>that you don't yet even realize.</i>

24
00:03:55,003 --> 00:04:00,818
Our Kansas State University
new undergraduate students today

25
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,857
<i>are indeed the next generation
of leaders</i>

26
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:06,825
<i>on whom we will all rely.</i>

27
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:12,367
<i>Let us, the faculty, know what
we can do to help you reach that goal.</i>

28
00:04:12,456 --> 00:04:16,769
We will be there to advise you,
to support you, to guide you,

29
00:04:16,828 --> 00:04:20,674
to point you to vast resources
and opportunities on your way.

30
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:25,977
To our new treasured students,
this is your moment.

31
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:43,826
Ah. You see? Ah...

32
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,960
Does it get any higher?

33
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,137
Ha-ha!

34
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,041
<i>Growing up in inner-city Miami,</i>

35
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:53,909
<i>people like me don't really go anywhere.</i>

36
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:56,549
<i>My dad came over from Cuba,</i>

37
00:04:56,638 --> 00:04:59,642
<i>and then my mom is second
generation Cuban-American.</i>

38
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:03,316
<i>I really wanted to get out of Miami
and do something different.</i>

39
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:06,883
I'm the first person of my family
to ever leave the state and go to college.

40
00:05:09,052 --> 00:05:11,726
<i>I was actually Valedictorian
in high school.</i>

41
00:05:11,822 --> 00:05:13,893
<i>One of my favorite trips was coming
to DC. when I was eight,</i>

42
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:17,370
and I cried when I saw
the Declaration of Independence.

43
00:05:18,897 --> 00:05:22,344
<i>I've always been really fascinated
with the law and politics</i>

44
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,277
<i>and just, like, our country's history.</i>

45
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:26,714
<i>And I knew I wanted to go
to</i> a <i>school that had that history.</i>

46
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,910
<i>And UNC was the first public school,</i>

47
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:31,010
<i>and they had so much
in its history, you know,</i>

48
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,182
<i>of activism and social justice,
and I just knew I belonged.</i>

49
00:05:36,716 --> 00:05:40,289
<i>I grew up in Raleigh,
North Carolina, kind of in suburbia.</i>

50
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:42,867
High school I actually
had a great time in.

51
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:44,868
I was athletic.
I played a lot of sports.

52
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,439
<i>I was the first female
in my class to letter.</i>

53
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:51,101
<i>I lettered in cross country.
And then I played soccer.</i>

54
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,977
<i>I was basically a straight-A student,
graduated third in my class.</i>

55
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,107
<i>For college, I thought
I would go somewhere in state,</i>

56
00:05:57,206 --> 00:06:00,380
and UNC was the best school.

57
00:06:01,443 --> 00:06:04,323
<i>I really had a good time there.</i>

58
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:08,123
<i>I learned a lot.
I loved my professors.</i>

59
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:11,564
The first few weeks,
I made some of my best friends,

60
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:14,728
<i>and we're still really,
really close to this day.</i>

61
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,069
But two of us were sexually assaulted
before classes had even started.

62
00:06:23,268 --> 00:06:25,111
<i>It was at night.</i>

63
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:27,444
<i>We were dancing.
I was out with some friends.</i>

64
00:06:27,572 --> 00:06:32,249
<i>People were drinking,
but nobody was ridiculously drunk.</i>

65
00:06:32,311 --> 00:06:36,020
And I got pulled outside
and banged my head against a wall

66
00:06:36,115 --> 00:06:38,357
and was raped.

67
00:06:41,255 --> 00:06:44,099
<i>I physically fought
and getaway and ran,</i>

68
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:47,799
and then went to the bathroom
and, like, I still remember

69
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:51,172
just putting my hands on the sink
and just looking at myself in the mirror,

70
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:52,939
shaking, like,
"What just happened?"

71
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,476
<i>My sophomore year,
right after spring break,</i>

72
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:03,147
a <i>really good friend of mine said,
"Hey, you wanna go to this party?"</i>

73
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:06,194
<i>And it was pretty late in the night.</i>

74
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,296
<i>I started dancing with this guy.</i>

75
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:11,856
He was really attractive
and a really, really great dancer

76
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:13,958
and just a really good person.
At least, I thought he was.

77
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,397
<i>It all happened really quickly.</i>

78
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:23,003
I was actually a virgin,
so that adds a bit to it,

79
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:27,481
but he just started kind of, like,
pulling me towards the bathroom.

80
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:31,315
<i>He grabbed my head
by the side of my ear</i>

81
00:07:31,377 --> 00:07:33,823
<i>and slammed it
against the bathroom (He.</i>

82
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:37,522
<i>And it didn't stop.</i>

83
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,926
<i>I couldn't move.</i>

84
00:07:42,022 --> 00:07:44,229
<i>I could hear the laughter
outside the door.</i>

85
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:46,168
<i>I could hear people dancing.</i>

86
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,832
<i>And it made me wonder,
why does nobody see me?</i>

87
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,841
<i>Why has nobody come
to the bathroom?</i>

88
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,537
<i>Why am I not screaming?</i>

89
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:59,414
When you're scared, when you don't know
what's happening to you,

90
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:03,251
you just stay there,
and you hope that you don't die.

91
00:08:03,346 --> 00:08:07,352
And that's what I was hoping, that
I had more than just 20 years to live.

92
00:08:12,055 --> 00:08:15,094
We've <i>known
for probably</i> 25 <i>years now</i>

93
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:18,766
that the problem of sexual assault
on college campuses is enormous.

94
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:23,408
On college campuses, it is not
the person jumping out of the bushes

95
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:27,212
or in the parking lot, who is going
to rape or sexually assault you.

96
00:08:27,272 --> 00:08:29,081
It is the person whom you know,

97
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:32,316
the person you may have classes with,
the person you see at a party.

98
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,951
<i>You think about- It's, you know,
it's the people we don't know</i>

99
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,155
<i>that we should be worried about, but
it's really the people that you do know</i>

100
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,891
<i>that you should be worried about.</i>

101
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:45,166
<i>But! think</i> a <i>lot of parents think,
"Well, we'll drop our daughter off,</i>

102
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,830
she'll have
a great college experience,

103
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,808
and everything will be fine
because the college has a reputation

104
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,310
for being a safe place."

105
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:55,348
Um... it's not.

106
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,866
<i>I learned later on that I wasn't
the only one who was raped that weekend.</i>

107
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,132
But at the time,
we didn't talk about it

108
00:09:17,195 --> 00:09:19,641
because it was something
that nobody talked about.

109
00:09:19,697 --> 00:09:24,147
<i>Rape's</i> a <i>scary word.
You don't wanna fall into</i> a <i>category.</i>

110
00:09:24,203 --> 00:09:26,774
<i>You don't wanna
be catted the victim.</i>

111
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:29,445
<i>I did not want to admit
that it happened to me.</i>

112
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:36,454
<i>I didn't tell anybody
for</i> a <i>really long time.</i>

113
00:09:36,516 --> 00:09:40,328
I went to classes, um...
did everything kind of normally,

114
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,231
and it was just...
something in the back of my mind,

115
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:45,463
and it really started to affect me.

116
00:09:45,526 --> 00:09:47,836
And I was like,
"I need to do something about this."

117
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,536
<i>And it actually wasn't until one of my
other friends came to me and said,</i>

118
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:55,046
<i>"I was assaulted at</i> a <i>fraternity.
How do I report?"</i>

119
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:57,845
And I said,
"Actually, I don't know."

120
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,318
And I disclosed to her
that I was assaulted as well,

121
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,391
and we sat down
and just pulled up Google

122
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,586
and started looking up
how to report at UNC.

123
00:10:06,683 --> 00:10:09,824
<i>I knew I was more comfortable
reporting than she was.</i>

124
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,764
So I said, "Okay, I'm gonna go report
and then I'll figure out how to do it,

125
00:10:12,857 --> 00:10:14,837
and then I'll tell you,
and then you can do it too."

126
00:10:15,993 --> 00:10:19,407
<i>Sol told this administrator
I was violently raped,</i>

127
00:10:19,498 --> 00:10:23,503
<i>and we're sitting down at this point,
and she looks at me and she's like,</i>

128
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:27,676
"Rape is like a football game, Annie,
and if you look back on the game,

129
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:31,346
what would you do differently
in that situation?"

130
00:10:31,444 --> 00:10:34,426
I was expecting resources.
I was expecting support.

131
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:39,430
And instead she gives me
this metaphor that rape is football.

132
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,194
And it made no sense.
And I ask her-- I was just,

133
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:44,531
"No, rape is not like football at all!"

134
00:10:44,626 --> 00:10:47,038
And she's like,
"Well, you know, were you drunk?"

135
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:48,870
And, "What would you
have done differently

136
00:10:48,963 --> 00:10:51,204
if you could replay
the situation again?"

137
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:53,873
And I was just getting blamed
and blamed and blamed for this.

138
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:58,945
They kept asking me,
like, "What were you wearing?

139
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,044
What were you drinking?
How much did you have to drink?

140
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:02,215
Did you pregame?"

141
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:06,625
He kind of just lectured us about
how we shouldn't go out in short skirts.

142
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:09,755
And we shouldn't drink because,
I mean, that's our fault.

143
00:11:09,887 --> 00:11:13,630
"Did you say no? How many times
did you say no? How did you say it?

144
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:15,226
Okay, what were you wearing?"

145
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:18,831
There was no response.
There was no response for seven months.

146
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:22,435
I thought that if I told them, like,
they would take action.

147
00:11:22,568 --> 00:11:25,105
But the only action
they took was against me.

148
00:11:25,237 --> 00:11:27,912
After I was sexually assaulted,
they said I should just drop out

149
00:11:28,007 --> 00:11:31,477
until everything blows over.
Out of school.

150
00:11:31,578 --> 00:11:35,025
I went back into her office,
and I asked her what happened.

151
00:11:35,114 --> 00:11:38,688
She looked me right in the eye
and told me that she forgot.

152
00:11:38,786 --> 00:11:40,424
The school's response
always seemed like

153
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:42,501
they were more concerned
about him and his needs.

154
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,835
She said, "You don't know what he's
going through right now and neither do I.

155
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:49,499
He could be really having a hard time."

156
00:11:49,598 --> 00:11:52,944
They also told me,
despite the fact that I had

157
00:11:53,002 --> 00:11:55,209
a written admission of guilt from him,

158
00:11:55,304 --> 00:11:57,682
that I didn't have enough evidence
and that, in fact,

159
00:11:57,773 --> 00:12:02,018
what I'd presented to them, um,
could only prove that he loved me.

160
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:07,189
There's a lot of victim blaming
with this crime,

161
00:12:07,284 --> 00:12:09,787
which has a silencing
effect on survivors.

162
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:21,043
If a student comes
to an administrator with a problem,

163
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:24,410
it's not as if the administrator
wants that student to be harmed.

164
00:12:24,503 --> 00:12:28,316
It's not as if the administrator wants
the harm to be perpetuated,

165
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,584
but their first job is to protect
the institution from harm,

166
00:12:31,678 --> 00:12:33,316
not the student from harm.

167
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,883
What you do is you make it difficult
for students to report,

168
00:12:35,982 --> 00:12:38,657
so you don't have 200
or a thousand reported assaults,

169
00:12:38,753 --> 00:12:40,892
or whatever the number
would be on that campus.

170
00:12:40,988 --> 00:12:43,434
So you can artificially
keep your numbers low.

171
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:47,607
<i>One really easy way,
when</i> a <i>lot of students report,</i>

172
00:12:47,696 --> 00:12:51,075
<i>they very much discourage them
from going to the police.</i>

173
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,077
And that's because
if it goes to the police,

174
00:12:53,168 --> 00:12:55,080
then it's more likely to end up
as a public record.

175
00:12:56,572 --> 00:13:00,179
<i>Colleges have been mandated
for</i> a <i>long time to report the crimes</i>

176
00:13:00,276 --> 00:13:02,847
<i>that occur on campus
to the federal government.</i>

177
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:06,884
But it is in the interest of the college
to actually suppress

178
00:13:07,017 --> 00:13:09,623
all knowledge that
that rape has happened.

179
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:23,805
There is a desire to have this
addressed internally.

180
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,451
And part of that is silencing
the kind of problem.

181
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:32,047
It's viewed as a public relations
management kind of a problem, I would say.

182
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:36,824
Universities are protecting a brand.
They're selling a product.

183
00:14:03,146 --> 00:14:06,424
<i>I got</i> a <i>call from
the Dean of Admissions first, asking,</i>

184
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:10,159
you know, "if you were to get
into Harvard, would you accept?"

185
00:14:10,254 --> 00:14:13,360
And I said yes because I knew my mom
would kill me if I said anything else.

186
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,698
But...

187
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:19,207
I had mentioned a little pressure.
Just a little.

188
00:14:19,297 --> 00:14:21,971
You know, I saw it
as a great opportunity.

189
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,809
You know, a Harvard Law degree. Wow.

190
00:14:27,774 --> 00:14:32,155
<i>I saw the inside of a court room
during my second year of law school.</i>

191
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:37,388
It was insanely stressful,
but also super rewarding.

192
00:14:37,484 --> 00:14:40,898
So, yeah, I really loved
my second year there.

193
00:14:42,457 --> 00:14:47,202
<i>It was during the winter term
of my third year.</i>

194
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:51,676
<i>I knew him really well.
We'd met</i> a <i>couple of years earlier.</i>

195
00:14:52,635 --> 00:14:55,548
<i>The guy and my girlfriend who was over,</i>

196
00:14:55,638 --> 00:14:58,916
<i>we all met at my apartment
to have some drinks beforehand,</i>

197
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:01,421
<i>and then we went out to this bar.</i>

198
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:04,219
<i>He continued to
buy us both more drinks.</i>

199
00:15:05,515 --> 00:15:10,431
<i>Half an hour into it, I noticed
my girlfriend seemed wasted.</i>

200
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:15,665
<i>People started to comment on
how drunk my friend seemed.</i>

201
00:15:17,996 --> 00:15:21,170
<i>Almost instantly
after we got into the taxi,</i>

202
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:24,681
<i>I just felt this extremely
heavy feeling come over me.</i>

203
00:15:26,673 --> 00:15:31,053
<i>My friend, she was just
kind of passed out completely.</i>

204
00:15:32,178 --> 00:15:35,888
It was, like, a maybe ten-minute
ride back to my place.

205
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:41,691
<i>Me and my girlfriend kind of just
flopped down, face first on my bed.</i>

206
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:48,570
The next thing I remember,
he, um, was on top of me,

207
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:52,976
and he had a hand
inside of my underwear,

208
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:55,242
and he was trying to put
a finger inside of me.

209
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,147
<i>I yanked him by the hair, and I looked
over, and I just saw her naked back,</i>

210
00:16:02,246 --> 00:16:05,819
<i>and I know that she'd fallen asleep
with all of her clothes on.</i>

211
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:10,423
And so my next question was,
"Why is she naked?" Um...

212
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:15,061
And he smiled as he was still on top
of me, fondling me with one hand,

213
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:17,437
and he reached out
and pet her naked belly and said,

214
00:16:17,563 --> 00:16:19,941
"I did that. I undressed her."

215
00:16:20,065 --> 00:16:22,272
And I asked, you know,
"And you took off her bra?"

216
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:27,147
Then, um, he--
he touched her naked breast,

217
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,813
while she was still totally unconscious,
and said, "Yeah, I did that too."

218
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,457
<i>And the next day he texted me.</i>

219
00:16:34,582 --> 00:16:37,825
And I said something
very casually like,

220
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,627
"Am I gonna have to tell her
that she needs a pregnancy test?"

221
00:16:40,755 --> 00:16:43,327
And he said in the text message,

222
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:48,773
"No, we didn't do anything serious.
Maybe I put a finger in her V at most."

223
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:56,345
<i>It seemed pretty clear
that he had assaulted both of them</i>

224
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:58,180
while they were unconscious.

225
00:16:58,274 --> 00:17:03,623
I absolutely presumed
that Harvard would do right by Kamilah.

226
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,554
<i>I went to
the Dean of Students' office,</i>

227
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,634
<i>and she said, "I just want
to make sure, above all else,</i>

228
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,160
that you don't talk
to anyone about this.

229
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:18,538
It could be bad for everyone
if people started rallying around, like,

230
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:24,047
having him removed from campus."
And I was like, "Well, he's a predator,

231
00:17:24,136 --> 00:17:26,845
and he's dangerous and actually
that's exactly what I want."

232
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:32,588
<i>We both had the right
to legal representation.</i>

233
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:34,659
<i>My lawyer was pro</i> Bono.

234
00:17:36,517 --> 00:17:38,861
<i>She was</i> a <i>phenomenal client.</i>

235
00:17:38,987 --> 00:17:42,867
She really told her story
with a great deal of confidence.

236
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:46,565
<i>I went into the hearing,
and even the professors were like,</i>

237
00:17:46,662 --> 00:17:49,074
<i>did I give him the wrong message
with our friendship,</i>

238
00:17:49,164 --> 00:17:51,201
<i>and that he misunderstood our friendship.</i>

239
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:55,508
My response was like,
"No, because, you know,

240
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:58,711
sex was never part of that friendship.

241
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:02,222
And if it were ever
going to be introduced,

242
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:04,623
when I was awake
would be a good time for that."

243
00:18:06,517 --> 00:18:10,055
<i>I'm getting questions like,
"Why didn't you fight him?"</i>

244
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:14,764
And he's like, I think,
like 6' 3", over 200 pounds.

245
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,740
I was unconscious
or just coming to.

246
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:21,802
L, like, could barely
take control of my own body.

247
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,881
But, "Why didn't you fight him?"

248
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,748
<i>There was this extreme
reluctance to believe me.</i>

249
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:33,491
<i>Campus administrators are
overly concerned about false reporting.</i>

250
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,060
You look at statistics
on false reporting.

251
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:39,064
It's much, much smaller
than what people estimate it to be.

252
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,158
The data about false rape claims
is that they're a tiny minority

253
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:43,964
of all reports ever made.

254
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:48,270
Rape and sexual assault have
the same percentage of false reports

255
00:18:48,397 --> 00:18:50,843
that any other crime has
in our country.

256
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:54,107
The best research
from around the world

257
00:18:54,236 --> 00:18:57,980
<i>would put the percentage of false reports
somewhere between two and eight percent.</i>

258
00:19:01,244 --> 00:19:03,155
<i>Which means 90 percent,</i>

259
00:19:03,246 --> 00:19:07,821
but more likely 95 to 98 percent
of reports, are not false.

260
00:19:09,787 --> 00:19:13,600
<i>We got done with the hearing
probably at 4:30 or 5:00.</i>

261
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:15,866
And they came back very quickly.

262
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:19,306
They'd found that
he had assaulted me.

263
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:24,707
<i>When we got the call that he was
expelled, she was in utter disbelief.</i>

264
00:19:24,804 --> 00:19:27,216
And that doesn't come very often
with these college cases.

265
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:33,022
<i>The next September,
I came back to Cambridge,</i>

266
00:19:33,114 --> 00:19:35,685
<i>and I got a Facebook message
from the Dean of Students.</i>

267
00:19:37,518 --> 00:19:42,662
<i>She said that the assailant,
he could appeal the ad board's decision,</i>

268
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:48,003
and they voted again on whether
to uphold the decision to remove him

269
00:19:48,131 --> 00:19:49,804
and decided to let him back in.

270
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,527
<i>The message is clear.</i>

271
00:20:07,652 --> 00:20:10,656
It's, "Don't proceed through
these disciplinary hearings.

272
00:20:11,322 --> 00:20:13,826
<i>No matter what you do,
you're not gonna win.“</i>

273
00:21:16,729 --> 00:21:18,572
<i>I was like, well,
you know what? I'm okay,</i>

274
00:21:18,664 --> 00:21:20,644
<i>and I've never had anything
happen to me and Fm fine.</i>

275
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:21,939
<i>Fm gonna get through this.</i>

276
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:24,845
<i>But I started feeling different.</i>

277
00:21:39,454 --> 00:21:44,131
<i>Not only was my mind in</i> a <i>place
of turmoil, my body was as well.</i>

278
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,940
I had nightmares that were so vivid
that I would wake up

279
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:49,600
and my neck was bleeding
of how much I was scratching off

280
00:21:49,665 --> 00:21:52,272
that invisible rapist
on my neck again.

281
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,720
<i>So finally, when it became
very overwhelming,</i>

282
00:22:02,813 --> 00:22:06,124
<i>I knew that! couldn't
keep denying it anymore.</i>

283
00:22:07,853 --> 00:22:10,527
<i>So actually the first person
I told was Annie Clark.</i>

284
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,659
<i>She was a senior
when I was a first year.</i>

285
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:16,329
<i>I kind of Face-booked her,
and I said, you know,</i>

286
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:18,169
<i>“Can I talk to you about something?“</i>

287
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,412
Hey, it's Annie.
Yeah, how are you doing?

288
00:22:23,503 --> 00:22:26,383
<i>- I mean, we just hit it off.</i>
<i>- Oh,</i> my gosh.

289
00:22:26,473 --> 00:22:29,386
<i>She, till this day, has been
my greatest support system.</i>

290
00:22:29,476 --> 00:22:32,685
Are you in a place-- Do you feel
comfortable talking about it, or...?

291
00:22:33,314 --> 00:22:36,489
After I spoke to Annie,
I came out publicly to the entire campus

292
00:22:36,584 --> 00:22:40,760
in October of my sophomore year
with a project called The Courage Project,

293
00:22:40,855 --> 00:22:44,394
<i>which was a photo project
of survivors on campus.</i>

294
00:22:45,227 --> 00:22:49,903
<i>As I became more public,
I became kind of that gateway for people</i>

295
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:52,844
<i>to actually start talking about
what had happened to them.</i>

296
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:19,704
<i>Within four weeks,
I met nine rape survivors at UNC.</i>

297
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:23,271
My school needed to know
this was a problem,

298
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,043
and I thought that
they honestly just didn't know.

299
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,278
<i>I made meetings with the Vice Chancellor,</i>

300
00:23:29,377 --> 00:23:30,947
<i>and I made meetings
with the Dean of Students,</i>

301
00:23:31,045 --> 00:23:33,286
<i>and they were passed off
and ignored and delayed.</i>

302
00:23:33,381 --> 00:23:36,829
<i>And I kept saying,
"UNC has</i> a <i>problem with sexual assault."</i>

303
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:40,297
I had the same meeting
with the Chancellor four years ago,

304
00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:42,892
and it's like, as soon as there's
a new cycle of students,

305
00:23:42,991 --> 00:23:45,598
there's no institutional memory,
and the problem starts all over again.

306
00:23:45,728 --> 00:23:46,729
And so unless you have...

307
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:49,935
<i>To see it happen with my friends
going through the same thing</i>

308
00:23:50,066 --> 00:23:53,480
I experienced six years ago,
it's heartbreaking.

309
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:57,746
And it's... That has affected me
more than my own rape.

310
00:23:57,841 --> 00:24:00,822
People stop talking about it,
and then it just continues

311
00:24:00,911 --> 00:24:04,359
and it makes you wonder,
what is it gonna take?

312
00:24:04,449 --> 00:24:06,793
<i>And we started working
with Dean Melinda Manning,</i>

313
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:10,127
<i>who was somebody who</i> a <i>lot of survivors
have worked with and trusted.</i>

314
00:24:10,255 --> 00:24:12,258
So in your time at UNC,

315
00:24:12,324 --> 00:24:15,328
how many students came to you
and said they'd been assaulted?

316
00:24:15,428 --> 00:24:20,344
Um... yeah, it's hard
to put a number on it, so...

317
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,669
At least 100.

318
00:24:23,603 --> 00:24:24,877
<i>And of the hundred,</i>

319
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:27,850
<i>how many of the perpetrators
were removed from campus?</i>

320
00:24:27,941 --> 00:24:30,684
From what I remember,
no one was expelled during that time.

321
00:24:30,778 --> 00:24:33,054
So these guys
could just get away with it?

322
00:24:33,147 --> 00:24:37,187
Absolutely. Absolutely.
And people could commit it repeatedly.

323
00:24:37,986 --> 00:24:43,402
I was certainly aware of some individuals
who had committed it repeatedly.

324
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:48,869
<i>A survivor
at Occidental College contacted me.</i>

325
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:53,675
I noticed that her rapists name
matched the name of two other cases.

326
00:24:53,803 --> 00:24:57,479
So, she was the third student
to be raped by this student.

327
00:24:57,575 --> 00:25:01,717
And the most troubling aspect
of this case

328
00:25:01,812 --> 00:25:06,387
is that he was allowed back,
or is allowed to come back onto campus.

329
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:11,156
<i>I thought it was only one,
but now I know (herds two other women.</i>

330
00:25:11,223 --> 00:25:14,865
And who knows who else
who just wasn't able to step forward.

331
00:25:14,927 --> 00:25:19,239
<i>It seemed like prime hunting ground
for someone like him.</i>

332
00:25:19,732 --> 00:25:22,907
<i>My assailant,
he's done much worse to other people.</i>

333
00:25:23,003 --> 00:25:27,850
He has assaulted at least four different
women. That's just who I know of.

334
00:25:28,342 --> 00:25:30,619
About two weeks after I reported,

335
00:25:30,712 --> 00:25:33,591
I got a call from the detective,

336
00:25:33,681 --> 00:25:37,094
saying that they found two other girls

337
00:25:37,185 --> 00:25:39,860
that he had previously raped.

338
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:44,598
And they were both
University of Tulsa students,

339
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:47,607
and they had both reported to the school.

340
00:25:51,034 --> 00:25:56,713
<i>The vast majority of men
don't rape, won't rape, haven't raped,</i>

341
00:25:57,208 --> 00:26:00,553
so when you start looking at the rapists
who are committing these crimes,

342
00:26:00,611 --> 00:26:03,956
it is the repeat offenders
who are the core of this problem.

343
00:26:13,158 --> 00:26:16,606
<i>I was incarcerated for six
and</i> a <i>half years for sexual assault.</i>

344
00:26:17,797 --> 00:26:19,902
I--I know I was at fault.

345
00:26:23,237 --> 00:26:27,083
You know, like I said, I guess the reason
I really wanted to do this interview

346
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:30,588
was to maybe help someone else out.

347
00:26:30,644 --> 00:26:34,457
You know, maybe have them
become aware of,

348
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:35,994
<i>you know,
what they re dam' wrong.</i>

349
00:26:36,952 --> 00:26:39,956
<i>The really practiced sex offenders
identify groups of people</i>

350
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:41,966
<i>who are more vulnerable.</i>

351
00:26:42,091 --> 00:26:45,300
<i>College is</i> a <i>place where
lots of alcohols consumed,</i>

352
00:26:45,428 --> 00:26:49,138
and the number of victims is endless.

353
00:26:50,801 --> 00:26:53,839
<i>These men
select victims ahead of time.</i>

354
00:26:53,937 --> 00:26:55,143
<i>It could be a bar.</i>

355
00:26:55,272 --> 00:26:58,618
<i>It could be</i> a <i>fraternity party
where people are drinking.</i>

356
00:27:00,278 --> 00:27:04,158
At the parties, like, frat parties,
I mean, people are getting wasted.

357
00:27:04,215 --> 00:27:07,197
So it's not like... A lot of the time,
depending' on who they're with,

358
00:27:07,286 --> 00:27:11,200
nobody, um, keeps an eye on them.

359
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,668
<i>The alcohol is
essentially</i> a <i>weapon</i>

360
00:27:13,726 --> 00:27:17,675
<i>that is used to render somebody
extremely vulnerable.</i>

361
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:23,813
<i>Alcohol definitely makes it
easier to overpower</i> a <i>victim.</i>

362
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:29,048
If they're inebriated or under
the influence, less struggle, for sure.

363
00:27:29,143 --> 00:27:31,680
<i>And then there's
an isolation phase.</i>

364
00:27:31,812 --> 00:27:34,692
<i>So, you know, somebody who has
deliberately gotten this young woman</i>

365
00:27:34,816 --> 00:27:37,763
<i>extremely intoxicated,
and at some point he says to her,</i>

366
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:39,833
<i>“H! walk you back to your room.“</i>

367
00:27:39,888 --> 00:27:44,167
<i>or, “You can sleep it off if you want.
We have a bed upstairs.“</i>

368
00:27:44,227 --> 00:27:46,537
<i>And that's where
the assault occurs.</i>

369
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,522
<i>A lot of people say, "Why don't
they just have students go to the police?"</i>

370
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:06,528
I have a lot of good friends who are
police officers, and I love them dearly,

371
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:09,589
but they have some work to do.

372
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:19,636
Even if law enforcement
does do a good job,

373
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:22,213
a lot of district attorneys
don't wanna take these cases.

374
00:28:28,976 --> 00:28:32,549
And even if there is a prosecution,
it takes a long time.

375
00:28:32,613 --> 00:28:34,719
It takes a year, two years.

376
00:28:34,783 --> 00:28:39,596
In the meantime, that alleged perpetrator
could do it again and again and again.

377
00:28:41,123 --> 00:28:43,502
<i>So universities,
if they have good evidence</i>

378
00:28:43,593 --> 00:28:46,335
<i>that somebody is perpetrating
that crime on that campus,</i>

379
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:48,807
<i>they should remove them
to protect their other students,</i>

380
00:28:48,898 --> 00:28:50,741
<i>with or without the police.</i>

381
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,181
No more violence!
No more rape!

382
00:28:55,272 --> 00:28:57,775
No more silence! No more hate!

383
00:29:03,749 --> 00:29:06,593
<i>Mamet“ What we're seeing today
has been going on</i>

384
00:29:06,651 --> 00:29:09,360
for a very long time
on college campuses.

385
00:29:11,691 --> 00:29:15,298
Sexual violence has always been
part of the college experience.

386
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:18,366
Here at Brown University,

387
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,308
<i>names of men accused of rape</i>

388
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:23,871
<i>appeared on bathroom walls
all over the campus.</i>

389
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:28,045
<i>The administration
called the tactic vigilantism.</i>

390
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:31,215
<i>One student had a word
for the women who did it:</i>

391
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:34,816
Idiots. I have a lot
of friends on the list,

392
00:29:34,883 --> 00:29:36,886
and by no means are they rapists.

393
00:29:36,986 --> 00:29:39,557
They might be aggressive
at parties, flirtatious.

394
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:42,534
And if girls carry a grudge,
they call 'em rapists.

395
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:47,575
And to be saying that just because
a woman says no and because you have sex,

396
00:29:47,664 --> 00:29:50,076
those are the two facts.
The woman said no and you had sex.

397
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:52,704
Then are you a rapist
automatically because of that?

398
00:29:52,803 --> 00:29:57,549
<i>A national study says one
out of every four female college students</i>

399
00:29:57,642 --> 00:30:01,488
<i>will be the victim of a rape
or attempted sexual assault.</i>

400
00:30:01,546 --> 00:30:04,858
The first national study was done--
published in 1987.

401
00:30:04,983 --> 00:30:07,987
Mary Koss's survey
of colleges around the country.

402
00:30:08,053 --> 00:30:11,695
<i>And those numbers have been
replicated over and over again.</i>

403
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:15,162
Good evening.
As troubling as your statistics,

404
00:30:15,261 --> 00:30:17,673
are charges that this date
or acquaintance rape

405
00:30:17,764 --> 00:30:20,006
is being hidden
by universities and colleges

406
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,276
in order to protect their image among
prospective students and their families.

407
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,423
<i>We had been trying
to change the university for years,</i>

408
00:30:35,517 --> 00:30:37,623
<i>and nothing was getting any better.</i>

409
00:30:39,021 --> 00:30:42,400
And so we started looking to do
something to force them or shame them

410
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:43,903
into doing the right thing.

411
00:30:44,794 --> 00:30:48,038
<i>We started digging and doing
months and months of research</i>

412
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:51,045
<i>on sexual harassment law,
on rape statutes.</i>

413
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:53,206
<i>And then I read about Title IX.</i>

414
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:57,048
<i>Title IX is a gender equity law.</i>

415
00:30:57,141 --> 00:31:01,783
<i>And it guarantees anyone
the right to an equal education.</i>

416
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:07,094
<i>When perpetrators are allowed to remain
on campus, and schools don't expel them,</i>

417
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:10,996
<i>even when they're found responsible,
then they're in violation of Title IX</i>

418
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:14,129
<i>for contributing to</i> a <i>hostile environment.</i>

419
00:31:14,227 --> 00:31:16,764
<i>If</i> a <i>school is found
in violation of Title IX,</i>

420
00:31:16,897 --> 00:31:19,810
<i>the government has the power
to revoke ail federal funds,</i>

421
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,848
<i>which would hopefully force
a school lo be in compliance.</i>

422
00:31:22,937 --> 00:31:25,474
Title IX and the pending Campus Save Act

423
00:31:25,606 --> 00:31:27,313
and now this law? Like, what?

424
00:31:27,408 --> 00:31:28,580
<i>And so,</i>

425
00:31:28,643 --> 00:31:30,851
<i>we decided to file</i> a <i>Title IX complaint.</i>

426
00:31:30,946 --> 00:31:33,586
You basically write
to the Department of Education,

427
00:31:33,682 --> 00:31:36,822
and you not only explain
what happened to you,

428
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:40,265
but you also explain how
it's a violation of Title IX.

429
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,932
So it is Thursday night,
and instead of going out,

430
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:47,304
we are in, learning case law
until we know Title IX

431
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:50,037
and the case law
like the back of our hands.

432
00:31:50,134 --> 00:31:53,172
<i>I had ear-buds in.
if I was walking, if I was, you know,</i>

433
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,340
<i>going on a run or whatever,</i>

434
00:31:54,438 --> 00:31:56,350
<i>instead of music
there were Supreme Court cases.</i>

435
00:31:56,441 --> 00:32:01,015
<i>I read all the case law
on all existing Title IX cases.</i>

436
00:32:01,112 --> 00:32:04,059
<i>Like, we're sleeping in shifts.
I would write for three hours</i>

437
00:32:04,149 --> 00:32:07,962
<i>and then sleep for three hours,
and she would do the same.</i>

438
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,796
<i>And I learned that
you don't have to be</i> a <i>lawyer to file it,</i>

439
00:32:10,856 --> 00:32:14,964
<i>that you could be 20
and take on</i> a <i>ZOO-year-old university.</i>

440
00:32:15,963 --> 00:32:17,203
<i>We didn't know how to file.</i>

441
00:32:17,297 --> 00:32:21,507
<i>So we faxed it, we emailed it,
and we matted it.</i>

442
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:23,047
We didn't know what to expect,

443
00:32:23,137 --> 00:32:26,744
and so I go into
my university mail office one day,

444
00:32:26,841 --> 00:32:30,050
and I have this big envelope
from the Department of Education,

445
00:32:30,144 --> 00:32:32,989
and I'm just, like, freaking out.

446
00:32:33,082 --> 00:32:36,188
I'm, like, crying, I'm calling
Drea, Melinda. I'm just like,

447
00:32:36,318 --> 00:32:39,162
<i>“They took our case.
They took our case.“</i>

448
00:32:41,191 --> 00:32:44,661
Flat out denial.
Leaders at UNC say accusations

449
00:32:44,761 --> 00:32:48,174
that the university under-reported
sexual assault cases is false.

450
00:32:48,264 --> 00:32:51,508
UNC Chapel <i>Hill</i>
General Council <i>Leslie Strohm</i> pointed out

451
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,675
<i>what</i> a <i>false claim can do
to</i> a <i>university's reputation.</i>

452
00:32:54,772 --> 00:33:00,621
The allegations are false. They are
untrue. And they are just plain wrong.

453
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:07,728
<i>"False. Untrue.
And just plain wrong."</i>

454
00:33:07,854 --> 00:33:11,700
That resonates in my head.
I hear that when I sleep.

455
00:33:11,758 --> 00:33:13,362
To say, "None of this happened.

456
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:15,464
We're not under-reporting.
We didn't mess up,"

457
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:16,870
it's just betrayal.

458
00:33:19,867 --> 00:33:23,610
Schools are actively and aggressively
not wanting to tell the truth

459
00:33:23,704 --> 00:33:25,582
about what's going on on their campuses

460
00:33:25,707 --> 00:33:28,051
because the first campuses
to do so will be,

461
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:29,713
you know, kind of known as
the rape campuses,

462
00:33:29,778 --> 00:33:31,655
where they actually have a rape problem.

463
00:33:31,746 --> 00:33:34,785
But, you know, rape is happening
at all college campuses,

464
00:33:34,884 --> 00:33:37,330
and there are perverse economic
and reputational incentives

465
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,797
to hide those numbers.

466
00:33:38,888 --> 00:33:42,837
I analogize it to getting a letter.

467
00:33:42,926 --> 00:33:47,068
So you're a parent, and you get a letter
in the middle of the summer,

468
00:33:47,164 --> 00:33:49,735
and it says,
"Dear Mr. and Mrs. Schultz,

469
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:52,337
we're so happy that Johnny
is going to be a freshman,

470
00:33:52,437 --> 00:33:55,816
and we thought we might need
to let you know

471
00:33:55,907 --> 00:33:58,854
that there's a one-in-four or five chance
that while Johnny's here,

472
00:33:58,943 --> 00:34:02,482
he's going to be the victim
of a drive-by shooting.

473
00:34:02,581 --> 00:34:07,587
What's so vexing about this problem
is that the shooters are other students.

474
00:34:07,653 --> 00:34:09,759
Thank you so much
for your tuition money.

475
00:34:09,823 --> 00:34:13,532
We so look forward
to welcoming Johnny in the fall."

476
00:34:13,626 --> 00:34:16,972
Would any parent send
his or her child there?

477
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:19,669
They protect perpetrators,
I think, across the board

478
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:22,270
because they have
a financial incentive to do so.

479
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:25,340
Perpetrators who are found responsible
for rape are much more likely

480
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:28,353
to sue institutions than survivors are,

481
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:30,684
and institutions like to avoid lawsuits.

482
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:33,885
And so in an effort
to avoid lawsuits,

483
00:34:33,982 --> 00:34:37,487
they pretty much do whatever they can
to give them a slap on the wrist.

484
00:34:38,621 --> 00:34:42,068
What to expect
if you are accused of a sexual assault.

485
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:45,000
<i>If you are found responsible,
you may</i> be...

486
00:34:45,796 --> 00:34:47,798
<i>suspended for one semester...</i>

487
00:34:48,732 --> 00:34:50,973
<i>suspended over summer vacation...</i>

488
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:53,905
<i>suspended for one day...</i>

489
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:57,149
<i>given a $75 fine...</i>

490
00:34:58,243 --> 00:35:00,189
<i>given a $25 fine...</i>

491
00:35:00,813 --> 00:35:02,759
<i>given</i> a <i>warning...</i>

492
00:35:03,649 --> 00:35:06,687
<i>assigned a paper
to reflect on your experience...</i>

493
00:35:07,887 --> 00:35:09,697
<i>required to construct a poster board,</i>

494
00:35:09,756 --> 00:35:12,566
<i>listing ten ways to approach</i>
a <i>girl you like...</i>

495
00:35:14,094 --> 00:35:19,511
<i>assigned 50 hours of community service
at a rape crisis center.</i>

496
00:35:21,569 --> 00:35:23,276
Any allegation
of sexual assault is something

497
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,112
that we at the university
take very seriously.

498
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:28,416
ASU issued</i> a <i>statement
saying in part, "Arizona State University</i>

499
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:31,184
<i>takes all sexual misconduct
complaints very seriously."</i>

500
00:35:31,246 --> 00:35:35,217
The university says it's taking
these allegations very seriously.

501
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,388
We take all incidents very seriously.

502
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,591
We take
these accusations very seriously.</i>

503
00:35:39,689 --> 00:35:41,794
We take
reports <i>like</i> this very seriously.

504
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:44,371
They take all reports very seriously.

505
00:35:44,427 --> 00:35:46,032
<i>James Madison University</i>

506
00:35:46,096 --> 00:35:47,905
<i>takes the safety and well-being</i>

507
00:35:47,965 --> 00:35:49,740
<i>of our students very seriously.</i>

508
00:35:49,867 --> 00:35:52,313
So-So what's the punishment?

509
00:35:52,403 --> 00:35:55,044
All three students responsible

510
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,780
<i>for sexual assault and harassment,</i>

511
00:35:57,876 --> 00:36:00,584
<i>expelled upon graduation.</i>

512
00:36:00,712 --> 00:36:04,058
Yes! Justice! Unbe-- Wait a minute.

513
00:36:05,284 --> 00:36:08,663
Expelled upon graduation?

514
00:36:11,325 --> 00:36:12,998
Isn't that...

515
00:36:13,093 --> 00:36:14,629
graduation?

516
00:36:23,404 --> 00:36:25,145
We <i>will</i> strive to <i>build</i>

517
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:30,020
a <i>community where education,
inquiry, and faith combine</i>

518
00:36:30,112 --> 00:36:33,093
<i>to respond to the demands of justice.</i>

519
00:36:35,117 --> 00:36:37,325
<i>This is our goat,</i>

520
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:41,027
<i>that no one ever say
that we dreamed too small.</i>

521
00:36:44,761 --> 00:36:47,936
<i>My career
in law enforcement started in 1969</i>

522
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:51,276
from the South Bend
Police Department and then went

523
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:53,144
to the University of Notre Dame
Police Department.

524
00:36:53,271 --> 00:36:58,221
<i>University students are...
they're just wonderful kids.</i>

525
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:01,848
But there's... just like anywhere,
there's a percentage

526
00:37:01,947 --> 00:37:06,021
of, um, of...

527
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:10,033
absolutely horrible people, too.

528
00:37:10,123 --> 00:37:13,333
You know. And, of course,
I had to deal with that too.

529
00:37:17,398 --> 00:37:21,039
<i>Saint Marys is
the sister school to Notre Dame.</i>

530
00:37:21,136 --> 00:37:24,242
It's one of the best Catholic
all-women's colleges in the nation,

531
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:26,876
and I was proud to go there.

532
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:32,917
<i>I was really happy.
I was pan of Campus Ministries.</i>

533
00:37:33,015 --> 00:37:36,394
<i>I decided to be a biology major.</i>

534
00:37:36,485 --> 00:37:39,831
<i>I had</i> a <i>dream of going
to medical school.</i>

535
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:43,331
Compared to my sister,
I'm more of a book person,

536
00:37:43,393 --> 00:37:48,343
<i>and she kinda always made fun of me
'cause I liked to stay in on the weekends,</i>

537
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:53,041
and she'd kinda say I was a party pooper
and want me to come out and stuff.

538
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,583
And I did go out. And it was fun.

539
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:59,411
<i>It was Halloween.</i>

540
00:38:00,913 --> 00:38:03,917
<i>A call came in on my phone.</i>

541
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:07,294
<i>It was from someone I knew
who went to Notre Dame.</i>

542
00:38:07,387 --> 00:38:11,392
<i>He's like, "You have to come
to</i> a <i>Halloween party."</i>

543
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:16,207
You know, I trust people.
I trusted what he said.

544
00:38:17,531 --> 00:38:20,535
So, you know,
I just went along with it.

545
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,280
<i>We got to his dorm.</i>

546
00:38:24,373 --> 00:38:26,979
<i>You know, I asked him,
"Well, where is everyone else?"</i>

547
00:38:27,075 --> 00:38:29,612
<i>And he's like,
"Oh, they're coming."</i>

548
00:38:30,746 --> 00:38:34,889
And eventually
his friends left,

549
00:38:34,951 --> 00:38:36,658
and it was just me and him.

550
00:38:42,926 --> 00:38:44,906
And that's when it happened.

551
00:38:47,731 --> 00:38:50,508
She, of course, said, "No."

552
00:38:50,602 --> 00:38:53,139
You know, trying' to keep him
from doing' what he was doing'.

553
00:38:53,238 --> 00:38:58,313
And then he eventually just forced her
and... and raped her.

554
00:39:02,081 --> 00:39:04,652
Lieutenant Cottrell interviewed
all the people that,

555
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,163
you know, I had known
that were involved.

556
00:39:07,254 --> 00:39:09,928
In my opinion,
I had a conspiracy

557
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:15,839
of not only the suspect that was involved
in... in raping the victim,

558
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:21,278
but I also had friends of his
that helped convince her

559
00:39:21,335 --> 00:39:23,713
that there was a party
that she was going to.

560
00:39:26,341 --> 00:39:29,686
<i>The university had
their judicial hearing.</i>

561
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,528
I had this idealistic view
that if I was telling the truth

562
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:42,002
that they would support me.
And, um... they didn't.

563
00:39:43,294 --> 00:39:47,743
They preferred to have the crime stats

564
00:39:47,832 --> 00:39:52,714
as low as possible,
so that, you know,

565
00:39:52,804 --> 00:39:58,652
it doesn't detract
from applicants to the university.

566
00:40:00,313 --> 00:40:04,887
<i>I met with the president
of Saint Mary's, Dr. Mooney.</i>

567
00:40:07,053 --> 00:40:11,161
Hello, I'm Carol Ann Mooney,
President of Saint Mary's College.

568
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:16,498
Saint Mary's must always be committed
to providing our students

569
00:40:16,563 --> 00:40:21,013
with an excellent intellectual
and academic experience.

570
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:24,676
She kind of blew it off
and didn't take it seriously, you know.

571
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:29,353
<i>She said, “Well, these things
don't happen here.“</i>

572
00:40:33,115 --> 00:40:38,464
<i>It got worse and worse for me
as the years went along.</i>

573
00:40:38,555 --> 00:40:44,768
Um... not only dealing with
what happened to the victim,

574
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:50,278
<i>but also dealing with
what the university did.</i>

575
00:40:50,368 --> 00:40:55,045
<i>My bosses were saying that they had</i>

576
00:40:55,107 --> 00:40:59,055
empathy for victims of crimes,

577
00:40:59,144 --> 00:41:04,891
but it was like
I told them, that-that

578
00:41:04,951 --> 00:41:06,453
"Talk is cheap.

579
00:41:06,553 --> 00:41:09,933
And that's all it is
with you guys is talk.

580
00:41:10,057 --> 00:41:12,901
You don't really support
victims of crimes.

581
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,735
I do.

582
00:41:16,063 --> 00:41:17,633
And I can't work
for you any longer."

583
00:41:22,103 --> 00:41:24,174
<i>I didn't really talk about it.</i>

584
00:41:24,272 --> 00:41:25,615
I kinda just...

585
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:31,452
stayed in my room
for a couple months until Christmas.

586
00:41:32,748 --> 00:41:35,319
And I didn't sleep.

587
00:41:35,418 --> 00:41:38,332
My nights and days
were mixed up. Um...

588
00:41:38,422 --> 00:41:41,995
I had to, um...
couldn't go to class,

589
00:41:42,092 --> 00:41:44,163
and so I cut down.

590
00:41:44,261 --> 00:41:48,039
<i>I just completely changed
as a person.</i>

591
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:56,185
<i><i>I think the biggest reason
why it's so hard to be on</i> a <i>college campus</i>

592
00:41:56,275 --> 00:42:00,451
after you've been raped or sexually
assaulted is that it's a small place,

593
00:42:00,546 --> 00:42:02,618
right, where everything is structured.

594
00:42:02,682 --> 00:42:05,128
Your living space is structured,
your eating space is structured,

595
00:42:05,185 --> 00:42:06,858
so you're gonna run into your rapist.

596
00:42:06,953 --> 00:42:10,901
I couldn't go out.
Like, I couldn't mingle with strangers.

597
00:42:10,992 --> 00:42:14,132
I felt the campus getting
smaller and smaller to me.

598
00:42:14,195 --> 00:42:16,402
There were less and less places
I felt comfortable going.

599
00:42:16,497 --> 00:42:22,073
I walk around with my pepper spray
on my keys, and I'm always just on edge.

600
00:42:24,373 --> 00:42:27,149
<i>There's</i> a <i>whole
physiological side to PTSD.</i>

601
00:42:27,209 --> 00:42:29,656
<i>When you experience
a traumatic event like this,</i>

602
00:42:29,712 --> 00:42:35,492
your nervous system, um,
tends to get very reactive.

603
00:42:35,585 --> 00:42:37,998
I started having more panic attacks.

604
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:40,830
When I was in my depressed state,
I just slept all day long.

605
00:42:40,924 --> 00:42:44,997
I couldn't stop crying. I couldn't stop
thinking about it. I self-harmed.

606
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:50,872
During the vacation between, I guess,
semester one and semester two,

607
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:52,777
I tried to kill myself.

608
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:58,553
I had a lot of, I mean, of course,
depression, suicidal thoughts.

609
00:42:58,678 --> 00:43:02,125
Trey Malone took his own life last June.

610
00:43:02,214 --> 00:43:06,186
<i>In his suicide note, Malone wrote
about being sexually abused</i>

611
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:10,759
<i>while a student at Amherst College
and the school's lack of response.</i>

612
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:12,929
Men are sexually assaulted.

613
00:43:13,027 --> 00:43:16,304
And typically that is
perpetrated by other men.

614
00:43:16,397 --> 00:43:20,243
And I think for a lot of male survivors
who are sexually assaulted,

615
00:43:20,368 --> 00:43:23,782
it challenges many beliefs
that they have about themselves.

616
00:43:23,872 --> 00:43:25,715
Men aren't supposed to become vulnerable.

617
00:43:25,774 --> 00:43:28,448
They always say, "You allowed
yourself to do it. Why did you do it?

618
00:43:28,544 --> 00:43:29,716
Why didn't you fight them off?"

619
00:43:29,778 --> 00:43:33,317
Men have to be strong, and men
wouldn't let this happen to them.

620
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:40,426
Because of the emphasis there is
on it being a crime against females,

621
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:43,495
men feel less comfortable
coming forward with it.

622
00:43:43,594 --> 00:43:47,839
Reporting rates amongst men
are just so infinitesimal

623
00:43:47,933 --> 00:43:50,937
that it actually makes it very hard
to do research on this,

624
00:43:51,069 --> 00:43:56,952
let alone to get a real understanding
of the scope of the problem.

625
00:44:12,092 --> 00:44:16,166
<i>You are built
from the ground as</i> a <i>Tar Heel...</i>

626
00:44:17,766 --> 00:44:21,771
<i>as a member of a community
that is so much bigger than you.</i>

627
00:44:22,772 --> 00:44:24,649
<i>I was directly going against it.</i>

628
00:44:26,776 --> 00:44:30,349
Tonight the US. Department of Education
has launched its own investigation

629
00:44:30,446 --> 00:44:35,192
into how UNC Chapel Hill has been handling
sexual assault cases on campus.

630
00:44:36,787 --> 00:44:40,793
<i>it wasn't until we filed the
complaint that the retaliation started.</i>

631
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:42,496
<i>And ifs been bad.</i>

632
00:44:45,163 --> 00:44:47,575
<i>I've gotten death threats,
We gotten rape threats.</i>

633
00:44:47,665 --> 00:44:50,044
Of course, Internet trolls
are always there.

634
00:44:50,135 --> 00:44:54,641
But I had one in-person threat,
which was kind of scary. Um...

635
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,720
"Bang-bang, bitch. Die."

636
00:44:56,809 --> 00:45:01,384
<i>My residence hall was broken into,
and it was completely vandalized.</i>

637
00:45:01,481 --> 00:45:05,054
<i>Spray paint everywhere,</i>
a <i>knife was left behind.</i>

638
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,189
<i>And messages were painted all over.</i>

639
00:45:10,724 --> 00:45:14,103
<i>I felt like
I was in danger all the time,</i>

640
00:45:14,195 --> 00:45:16,870
<i>and that's what! thought of
when I went to classes.</i>

641
00:45:18,033 --> 00:45:20,912
<i>I went, you know,
from being Valedictorian in high school</i>

642
00:45:21,002 --> 00:45:23,846
<i>and then, you know,
struggling to finish my classes.</i>

643
00:45:23,905 --> 00:45:26,682
<i>And not Knowing how to tell my parents,
which I never did.</i>

644
00:45:30,746 --> 00:45:32,692
Can you talk a little bit
about what it was like

645
00:45:32,748 --> 00:45:34,956
when your parents found out?

646
00:45:35,052 --> 00:45:36,895
- They still don't know.
- They still don't know.

647
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,227
Yeah. Um...

648
00:45:41,058 --> 00:45:45,735
I thought about telling them
many, many times.

649
00:45:45,864 --> 00:45:49,437
And I didn't tell my parents
until a couple days later,

650
00:45:49,567 --> 00:45:53,880
which was probably, like, the hardest
thing I've ever had to do, ever.

651
00:45:53,939 --> 00:45:55,077
Um...

652
00:45:56,475 --> 00:45:59,251
- Now I'm gonna start crying.
- It's okay, you can cry.

653
00:45:59,379 --> 00:46:03,418
- You don't have to hold it in.
- Like, I remember Skyping my dad...

654
00:46:06,586 --> 00:46:09,090
What worries you
about telling them?

655
00:46:09,156 --> 00:46:12,296
The conversation afterwards.

656
00:46:13,327 --> 00:46:14,931
I worry that they'd
look at me differently.

657
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:20,806
I'm worried that they'd want
to talk about it again.

658
00:46:24,606 --> 00:46:26,780
And just the fact
that they would know.

659
00:46:30,113 --> 00:46:33,117
That it would just be there in their minds
when they looked at me.

660
00:46:34,284 --> 00:46:38,028
Just to hear my mom's voice on the phone,
her feeling so helpless in that moment,

661
00:46:38,122 --> 00:46:41,365
is probably one of the worst aspects
of this entire ordeal,

662
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:43,803
which probably makes me
the most angry at my assailant.

663
00:46:44,496 --> 00:46:47,636
My mom was on the plane
the next day after I told her.

664
00:46:54,473 --> 00:46:59,047
My dad, he wears
his Notre Dame ring every day.

665
00:46:59,145 --> 00:47:03,322
I've never seen him take it off, and
he didn't-- he wasn't wearing it anymore.

666
00:47:03,383 --> 00:47:08,025
His finger that has
a permanent mark from his ring

667
00:47:08,155 --> 00:47:12,070
didn't have his ring on.
And it just...

668
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,006
It was even more heartbreaking
for me to watch my dad.

669
00:47:16,064 --> 00:47:20,207
I call her from a thousand miles away
and tell her this.

670
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:24,851
And I just wanted
her to be there.

671
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:38,193
<i>Lizzy always had this big,
beautiful, radiant smile.</i>

672
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:42,327
It was electric, and it--it--it
made other people happy.

673
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:47,236
<i>We had 11 family members
attend Notre Dame</i>

674
00:47:47,332 --> 00:47:50,370
<i>and two family members, including Lizzy,
that went to Saint Marys.</i>

675
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:56,352
And she, I think, really felt affirmed
that this was the right choice.

676
00:47:56,409 --> 00:48:00,755
<i>She was really,
really happy to be there.</i>

677
00:48:02,215 --> 00:48:04,526
And a little bit of chicken fry

678
00:48:04,585 --> 00:48:08,533
<i>She went over
on August 31st with a friend</i>

679
00:48:08,589 --> 00:48:11,127
<i>to attend an activities fair
at Notre Dame,</i>

680
00:48:11,226 --> 00:48:14,207
and that evening they went back

681
00:48:14,262 --> 00:48:18,802
to, um, this football player's room.

682
00:48:22,238 --> 00:48:24,115
<i>It was four of 'em in mere.</i>

683
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,948
<i>The football player and his friend
and Lizzy and her friend.</i>

684
00:48:27,076 --> 00:48:29,283
<i>And--And,</i> um...

685
00:48:29,412 --> 00:48:31,119
I guess, rather suddenly,

686
00:48:31,247 --> 00:48:35,127
the... the... the other two left the room

687
00:48:35,251 --> 00:48:37,595
and left Lizzy alone
with this football player.

688
00:48:37,653 --> 00:48:40,599
And then he basically jumps her.

689
00:48:40,655 --> 00:48:44,398
<i>He pulls her on top of him</i>

690
00:48:44,459 --> 00:48:48,999
<i>and-and removes her shirt,
um, and bra,</i>

691
00:48:49,097 --> 00:48:52,772
<i>and then also begins to try
to take off her pants.</i>

692
00:48:54,936 --> 00:48:57,644
<i>And the next day Lizzy reports.</i>

693
00:48:57,772 --> 00:49:00,446
It never crossed our mind
that they wouldn't do right.

694
00:49:02,744 --> 00:49:06,817
<i>The accused, they couldn't find him.
They had difficulty locating him.</i>

695
00:49:08,149 --> 00:49:12,824
<i>Everyone knows where this individual is.
Certainly the athletic department knows.</i>

696
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,834
He played two home football games
before he was interviewed.

697
00:49:16,924 --> 00:49:20,337
<i>Notre Dame stadium holds 80,000 people,</i>

698
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:24,534
<i>so that's times two, 160,000 people
knew where this guy was</i>

699
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:27,976
before the Notre Dame
Security Police could find him.

700
00:49:29,036 --> 00:49:34,315
There was a directive
that the campus police

701
00:49:34,374 --> 00:49:37,480
cannot contact an athlete

702
00:49:37,544 --> 00:49:40,388
at any athletic facility...

703
00:49:41,715 --> 00:49:46,356
and we cannot contact
any athletic employee

704
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:52,300
to assist us in contacting the athlete
that we would be looking for.

705
00:49:52,358 --> 00:49:54,304
So what was the point of that?

706
00:49:56,362 --> 00:49:59,866
I guess just <i>to...</i>

707
00:49:59,999 --> 00:50:04,345
keep us away
from student athletes.

708
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:07,747
So Lizzy ends this exchange
of intimidating texts

709
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,480
from the football player's friend,

710
00:50:10,543 --> 00:50:13,319
and he comes at her with a text,

711
00:50:13,379 --> 00:50:15,381
"Don't do anything you would regret.

712
00:50:15,515 --> 00:50:18,654
Messing with Notre Dame football
is a bad idea."

713
00:50:19,351 --> 00:50:20,989
And then Lizzy takes that message

714
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:24,590
and immediately forwards it
to the detective in charge.

715
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:28,865
And later the county prosecutor said
that they would not be filing any charges

716
00:50:28,927 --> 00:50:33,307
on that particular complaint
and saying that it wasn't a threat

717
00:50:33,365 --> 00:50:36,642
because the individual who sent it

718
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:42,117
believed he was trying to prevent
someone from filing a false report.

719
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:49,714
<i>She was becoming very anxious
about this-this whole situation.</i>

720
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,888
<i>One of her friends is quoted
as saying that she said, you know,</i>

721
00:50:54,018 --> 00:50:55,861
"He's <i>gonna get away with it.</i> "

722
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,727
<i>He denied everything,</i>

723
00:50:57,788 --> 00:51:00,769
<i>and made comments like,
“She was the aggressor.“</i>

724
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:06,369
Friday evening,
I finally looked at my phone,

725
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:11,243
and I saw a text
from my wife's best friend, saying,

726
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:13,780
"You need to call right away."

727
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:19,047
And--And I remember
the words in it was, uh,

728
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:21,782
"It's bad. It's bad.

729
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:24,584
Lizzy took her life today.

730
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,094
<i>She's gone.“</i>

731
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:44,772
<i>You know, ifs... brutal.</i>

732
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:48,610
It's just really profoundly sad
in those moments

733
00:51:48,671 --> 00:51:51,776
when you just think,
she's not here with us.

734
00:52:00,282 --> 00:52:01,955
<i>Is it just students?
Is it everybody?</i>

735
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:11,437
<i>So I'm in Oregon.</i>

736
00:52:11,493 --> 00:52:14,838
<i>' Drea ends up moving to Oregon
and taking the semester off.</i>

737
00:52:18,634 --> 00:52:23,379
Every place I've separated
with a semicolon is a different...

738
00:52:23,471 --> 00:52:26,111
<i>She and I started talking. We're like,
“Okay, we're gonna keep doing this.</i>

739
00:52:26,173 --> 00:52:28,676
<i>Don't know how we're gonna fund it,
but we're gonna do something.“</i>

740
00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:30,516
<i>We called everybody.</i>

741
00:52:30,645 --> 00:52:33,125
<i>Most people totally laughed it off.</i>

742
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:37,458
Just looking at rape reporting
in general, it's really low...

743
00:52:37,518 --> 00:52:40,988
<i>But one of the people who we had
reached out to about the UNC case</i>

744
00:52:41,055 --> 00:52:43,831
<i>was at The New York Times.
And hes like, “Oh, that's interesting.“</i>

745
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:46,131
<i>It ended up becoming a front page
New York Times story.</i>

746
00:52:48,663 --> 00:52:53,737
That's when we got a flood
of emails, Facebook, tweets.

747
00:52:53,834 --> 00:52:57,337
Like, somebody tweeted at me,
"Me too. It happened to me too."

748
00:52:57,404 --> 00:53:00,248
This is Annie.
And Andrea's here with me.

749
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:04,015
Do you see a button in the middle
of your screen? It says "start video."

750
00:53:05,178 --> 00:53:06,418
- Yay!
- Oh, look at that.

751
00:53:06,513 --> 00:53:10,154
It was my freshman year.
I'd been at school for a couple of weeks.

752
00:53:10,216 --> 00:53:12,059
I'd made friends
in some frat houses.

753
00:53:12,185 --> 00:53:14,028
<i>People reached out
through all these different mediums.</i>

754
00:53:14,154 --> 00:53:15,997
<i>A lot of Facebook. A lot of emails.</i>

755
00:53:16,056 --> 00:53:18,366
"I froze and couldn't fight back."

756
00:53:18,491 --> 00:53:22,166
"I don't know if it's appropriate to have
told this story to you without asking,

757
00:53:22,228 --> 00:53:27,870
and I'm sorry if it's been harmful to you
in any way, but it needs to stop."

758
00:53:29,034 --> 00:53:30,570
Wow.

759
00:53:30,703 --> 00:53:33,547
I remember I was in one meeting
after some story broke,

760
00:53:33,672 --> 00:53:37,017
and I had 50 calls in an hour.
I had 50 calls.

761
00:53:37,076 --> 00:53:40,683
I've never heard
of a case that has gone

762
00:53:40,746 --> 00:53:43,727
- in, like, the survivor's favor.
- I mean, he admitted it.

763
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:46,295
He admitted to sexual assault
and got an eight-week suspension.

764
00:53:46,385 --> 00:53:47,227
Mm-hmm.

765
00:53:47,353 --> 00:53:50,300
The Dean of Students
accused me of being drunk

766
00:53:50,389 --> 00:53:52,960
and told me that I had,
like, a serious problem.

767
00:53:53,058 --> 00:53:55,402
<i>So many of the survivors
coming forward were saying,</i>

768
00:53:55,461 --> 00:53:56,599
<i>“My rape was bad,</i>

769
00:53:56,695 --> 00:53:58,572
<i>but the way I was treated was worse.“</i>

770
00:53:58,697 --> 00:54:01,540
I was raped in the Honors Dorm

771
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:04,603
above the department's office.

772
00:54:04,736 --> 00:54:08,445
And the department office took
my scholarship. It just doesn't...

773
00:54:08,539 --> 00:54:10,746
<i>I was up working at four,
and then I'd go to work,</i>

774
00:54:10,808 --> 00:54:13,288
<i>and then I come back
and sometimes there'd be survivors</i>

775
00:54:13,411 --> 00:54:15,721
<i>in my apartment that needed to talk.</i>

776
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:18,283
You probably hear
stories like this all the time.

777
00:54:18,383 --> 00:54:20,488
I know, but it doesn't make it any better.

778
00:54:20,585 --> 00:54:25,500
Now I'm realizing, like, how much better
I feel from talking about it.

779
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:29,299
You're not alone. You're not alone.
And no matter how many awful things...

780
00:54:29,394 --> 00:54:30,839
<i>I basically had to make</i> a <i>choice</i>

781
00:54:30,928 --> 00:54:33,305
<i>if I wanted to continue
to support survivors</i>

782
00:54:33,397 --> 00:54:37,174
<i>or have my actual administrative job
at</i> a <i>university.</i>

783
00:54:37,267 --> 00:54:41,443
<i>I figured I could do more good
this way, so I resigned.</i>

784
00:54:42,939 --> 00:54:46,751
- On our to-do list, we have Vanderbilt.
- Yep.

785
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:48,687
- Um...
- UConn.

786
00:54:48,779 --> 00:54:50,520
Formalizing a national network

787
00:54:50,614 --> 00:54:52,958
- is on our to-do list.
- That's pending.

788
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:54,858
I found my paychecks.

789
00:54:59,289 --> 00:55:03,031
<i>What Drea and I are looking
to see is how do we show that UNC,</i>

790
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:05,298
<i>it's not in isolation?</i>

791
00:55:06,796 --> 00:55:10,334
<i>We started seeing, you know, what was
happening at campuses across the country.</i>

792
00:55:13,469 --> 00:55:18,145
<i>We look at all the cases we've heard,
then we make this map,</i>

793
00:55:18,207 --> 00:55:21,677
<i>and every time another school called
or whatever, we put a dot on the map.</i>

794
00:55:21,811 --> 00:55:26,226
<i>I remember talking to Drea, and I'm like,
"Why has no one connected the dots before?</i>

795
00:55:26,315 --> 00:55:30,627
<i>We have a case at Amherst, Vale,
Penn State, Berkeiey, Oxy, UNC,</i>

796
00:55:30,686 --> 00:55:33,565
<i>and nobody said,
'I think we should connect these dots</i>

797
00:55:33,656 --> 00:55:37,125
<i>'cause there might be something
going on here bigger than one problem"</i>

798
00:55:37,192 --> 00:55:41,140
<i>And you see how many people
are being impacted by them,</i>

799
00:55:41,196 --> 00:55:43,802
<i>and every one of those dots
being more than one story.</i>

800
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,370
<i>You start to see it as an epidemic.</i>

801
00:55:47,502 --> 00:55:49,675
<i>What if we could build a network?</i>

802
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:52,683
<i>What if we could connect our stones?</i>

803
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:57,347
<i>We could actually make campus rape</i>
a <i>problem that people cared about.</i>

804
00:56:03,351 --> 00:56:04,523
Hi, Sofie!

805
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:07,259
Hello.

806
00:56:07,354 --> 00:56:09,334
Hi!

807
00:56:09,389 --> 00:56:11,027
Do you wanna see Drea?

808
00:56:12,593 --> 00:56:15,767
- Can you see?
- Drea!

809
00:56:16,697 --> 00:56:19,234
<i>Sofie was one
of the first activists who reached out,</i>

810
00:56:19,366 --> 00:56:21,004
<i>and she was from Berkeley.</i>

811
00:56:21,068 --> 00:56:23,548
There's been an increase
in the number

812
00:56:23,604 --> 00:56:26,414
of sexual assaults
that have happened.

813
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,884
<i>She's like, "This is exactly
what's happening at Berkeley.</i>

814
00:56:28,942 --> 00:56:30,751
<i>I know so many other people
that are dealing with this.</i>

815
00:56:30,878 --> 00:56:32,687
<i>How can we do what you did?“</i>

816
00:56:32,746 --> 00:56:35,090
<i>And so we started working together.</i>

817
00:56:37,417 --> 00:56:39,555
- Annie!
- Hi!

818
00:56:43,189 --> 00:56:44,634
- How are you?
- Hi!

819
00:56:44,724 --> 00:56:46,465
- Oh!
- Hi, how was your trip'?

820
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,369
- Are you scared of retaliation at all?
- Yeah.

821
00:56:50,363 --> 00:56:54,778
So far, the students who know
have been really, really supportive.

822
00:56:54,901 --> 00:56:58,576
I think that once maybe
the fraternities find out,

823
00:56:58,704 --> 00:57:02,413
then that could be bad.

824
00:57:02,542 --> 00:57:06,752
It's called Collegiate ACB,
and there are all of these fraternities

825
00:57:06,812 --> 00:57:09,759
that post on it about, like,
"Oh, who's the most attractive?

826
00:57:09,815 --> 00:57:12,727
Which house is the best house?"
Or people that say,

827
00:57:12,784 --> 00:57:16,664
"I was raped at Sigma Chi last weekend."
Or "I was raped at Teke once."

828
00:57:17,756 --> 00:57:19,463
Why is your name in it?

829
00:57:19,591 --> 00:57:21,434
Oh, my God.
I don't know.

830
00:57:21,493 --> 00:57:24,667
I did not think I was gonna be
on this stupid site.

831
00:57:24,763 --> 00:57:26,743
Well, also how
they spelled your name, though.

832
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:29,677
I know.
"Sofiem Karasekem"?

833
00:57:29,768 --> 00:57:31,941
- Whatever that means.
- They wrote my name--

834
00:57:32,003 --> 00:57:33,641
They wrote it in Latin.
I don't understand.

835
00:57:33,772 --> 00:57:34,773
Probably search it?

836
00:57:40,612 --> 00:57:41,784
Interesting.

837
00:57:57,328 --> 00:57:59,035
Whoo!

838
00:58:03,334 --> 00:58:07,805
<i>The American fraternity industry
spans thousands of American colleges,</i>

839
00:58:07,871 --> 00:58:11,512
from the most elite,
private Ivy League institutions

840
00:58:11,609 --> 00:58:12,986
to small regional colleges.

841
00:58:15,945 --> 00:58:19,119
<i>We all know about
inflicted trauma from hazing.</i>

842
00:58:19,182 --> 00:58:21,856
<i>But it's</i> a <i>matter of public record</i>

843
00:58:21,985 --> 00:58:25,455
<i>that the second most common
type of insurance claim</i>

844
00:58:25,521 --> 00:58:26,693
<i>against the fraternity industry</i>

845
00:58:26,823 --> 00:58:28,734
<i>is from sexual assault.</i>

846
00:58:28,825 --> 00:58:30,532
I don't wanna
single out fraternities

847
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,469
because it's actually
a minority of fraternities,

848
00:58:32,528 --> 00:58:35,168
<i>but what you inevitably get
are certain fraternities</i>

849
00:58:35,231 --> 00:58:38,542
<i>where the sexual assault
is really rampant.</i>

850
00:58:38,668 --> 00:58:40,875
<i>Within just, say,
the last five to ten years,</i>

851
00:58:41,004 --> 00:58:43,314
<i>Sigma Alpha Epsilon's
had</i> a <i>number of problems.</i>

852
00:58:43,373 --> 00:58:47,218
SAE is known at a lot of places
as "Sexual Assault Expected."

853
00:58:47,342 --> 00:58:50,915
- Sexual Assault Expected.
- Sexual Assault Expected.

854
00:58:51,013 --> 00:58:52,822
SAE. Sexual Assault Expected.

855
00:58:52,881 --> 00:58:55,760
ls there any, like, parties or
places that you've been warned not to go?

856
00:58:55,851 --> 00:58:59,025
- Yes, SAE.
- Sexual Assault Expected.

857
00:59:00,355 --> 00:59:03,359
<i>Sigma Nu. SAE.
Deke, at the very top.</i>

858
00:59:03,492 --> 00:59:05,597
Those are, like, the main ones,
where as a freshman you're told,

859
00:59:05,694 --> 00:59:06,695
like, "Don't go there."

860
00:59:06,762 --> 00:59:10,733
There's one fraternity on campus
that is called "the date rape frat."

861
00:59:10,832 --> 00:59:12,834
DKE is known as the roofie frat.

862
00:59:12,901 --> 00:59:15,245
There is one
that was called the rape dungeon.

863
00:59:17,105 --> 00:59:20,415
<i>Once you get</i> a <i>group
of people like this in that kind of</i>

864
00:59:20,508 --> 00:59:23,751
synergistic kind of culture forming,

865
00:59:23,844 --> 00:59:26,552
<i>it intensifies this problem.</i>

866
00:59:27,048 --> 00:59:31,087
Pledges at a fraternity at Yale
surrounded the dorm

867
00:59:31,218 --> 00:59:35,098
<i>where many of the freshman girls lived,
at night, shouting...</i>

868
00:59:37,758 --> 00:59:41,399
"No" means "yes!"
"Yes" means "anal!"

869
00:59:43,297 --> 00:59:45,208
"No" means "yes!"
"Yes" means "anal!"

870
00:59:45,266 --> 00:59:47,974
I ended up pledging SAE,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

871
00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:50,947
It's one of the largest
national fraternities

872
00:59:51,037 --> 00:59:54,416
somewhat notorious
for its bad reputation.

873
00:59:55,241 --> 00:59:57,949
<i>Every Wednesday night we would have
what we would call meetings</i>

874
00:59:58,078 --> 01:00:02,049
where all the brothers, usually about 70
if all were in attendance,

875
01:00:02,115 --> 01:00:05,892
would gather in the basement
and begin a highly structured ritual

876
01:00:05,952 --> 01:00:09,627
<i>exchanging stories of sexual conquest.</i>

877
01:00:09,723 --> 01:00:13,967
If a brother had had anal sex
with a woman, that would be mentioned,

878
01:00:14,094 --> 01:00:16,165
and that would be a kind of
a pat-on-the-back moment.

879
01:00:16,262 --> 01:00:18,833
And I think that that's something
that the women at Dartmouth

880
01:00:18,932 --> 01:00:21,935
who hooked up with the fraternity brothers
didn't really know.

881
01:00:22,067 --> 01:00:26,015
That guy who tried
to sexually assault me at ATO,

882
01:00:26,105 --> 01:00:30,144
he was a pledge at the time, right?
And so all the pledges had to, like,

883
01:00:30,275 --> 01:00:35,122
photograph girls without
anything on their tops, right'?

884
01:00:35,247 --> 01:00:36,851
- What?
- Had to photograph shirtless girls.

885
01:00:36,949 --> 01:00:38,951
- I hate that.
- And so apparently in the basement

886
01:00:39,017 --> 01:00:43,693
there were pictures of girls
and just, like, their tits.

887
01:00:43,789 --> 01:00:47,794
And apparently this kid...
this kid who was, like, so pushy with me,

888
01:00:47,926 --> 01:00:51,533
he had, like, the most pictures of girls.
So when he comes at me,

889
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:53,200
his behavior of being
sexually aggressive

890
01:00:53,298 --> 01:00:54,367
gets rewarded by his brothers.

891
01:01:00,972 --> 01:01:03,543
<i>Fraternities are
essentially unregulated bars.</i>

892
01:01:03,641 --> 01:01:07,054
And the individuals that are responsible
for managing that alcohol

893
01:01:07,145 --> 01:01:09,819
are themselves
legally incapable of consuming it.

894
01:01:11,115 --> 01:01:12,822
<i>Most sororities
don't throw parties</i>

895
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:16,830
because you can't have alcohol at all
on the premises, even if you're over 21.

896
01:01:16,888 --> 01:01:20,700
So if sorority women want to drink
or go to a party even, at all,

897
01:01:20,825 --> 01:01:22,327
<i>they have to do it at a fraternity</i>

898
01:01:22,393 --> 01:01:26,340
<i>where the fraternity brothers control
the dispersion of alcohol.</i>

899
01:01:26,463 --> 01:01:29,376
Usually the drinks
had Everclear in them.

900
01:01:29,466 --> 01:01:31,070
What's Everclear?

901
01:01:31,168 --> 01:01:34,081
It's a very strong form of alcohol,

902
01:01:34,171 --> 01:01:35,980
and I...

903
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:39,077
The reason why they put it in there
is because it would get you drunk quickly.

904
01:01:39,176 --> 01:01:42,680
The idea would be to get everyone
so incredibly intoxicated, you know,

905
01:01:42,813 --> 01:01:45,020
blackout drunk,
that would increase the chances

906
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:46,992
<i>that people would be getting Said.</i>

907
01:01:48,018 --> 01:01:50,726
<i>There was certainly something
predatory about it.</i>

908
01:01:51,221 --> 01:01:54,862
<i>The fraternity brothers took great pride
in having a predator/prey relationship</i>

909
01:01:54,925 --> 01:01:56,996
<i>with the women that would come
to these parties.</i>

910
01:01:59,161 --> 01:02:02,267
- I was at a fraternity party.
- I went to a fraternity.

911
01:02:02,364 --> 01:02:05,675
I went to a fraternity party at MIT.

912
01:02:05,734 --> 01:02:10,114
I'd never really, I guess,
been in a situation like that.

913
01:02:12,541 --> 01:02:15,283
He came up to me
and we started talking.

914
01:02:15,377 --> 01:02:18,586
He was just this guy I thought was cute,
and then we were just dancing at FIJI.

915
01:02:18,714 --> 01:02:22,127
This big frat brother came up to me,
and he put his arm around me

916
01:02:22,218 --> 01:02:25,563
and he took me away from my friends,
but he was really nice.

917
01:02:25,688 --> 01:02:30,432
A friend at the time, um,
really fed me a lot of drinks.

918
01:02:30,558 --> 01:02:33,767
He said, "Why don't we go outside?"

919
01:02:33,895 --> 01:02:35,397
He asked if I wanted to go upstairs.

920
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:38,704
- We went upstairs.
- And he invited me to go into a room.

921
01:02:38,766 --> 01:02:40,404
He took me downstairs
to their basement.

922
01:02:42,203 --> 01:02:47,983
He pinned me against the wall
and took off my clothes and assaulted me.

923
01:02:48,076 --> 01:02:51,250
That's when they both assaulted me.

924
01:02:51,312 --> 01:02:53,724
I was assaulted by at least
two members of their fraternity.

925
01:02:57,318 --> 01:03:00,595
It's extremely difficult,
if not impossible,

926
01:03:00,722 --> 01:03:05,101
to get accurate information about whether
or not there have been sexual assaults

927
01:03:05,158 --> 01:03:07,798
in a particular...
particular fraternity house.

928
01:03:07,928 --> 01:03:10,932
What you find in many
circumstances that universities

929
01:03:10,998 --> 01:03:14,275
have created contractual
relationships with fraternities

930
01:03:14,334 --> 01:03:17,178
that involve them
promoting the fraternities,

931
01:03:17,271 --> 01:03:21,811
but not then also disclosing the risks
that they've had with those fraternities.

932
01:03:21,909 --> 01:03:24,014
On the Johns Hopkins University
campus today,

933
01:03:24,111 --> 01:03:27,456
following allegations of a gang rape
at an off-campus fraternity.

934
01:03:27,581 --> 01:03:31,154
Students say the university failed
to tell students about the investigation.

935
01:03:31,285 --> 01:03:33,594
<i>Problem after problem after problem</i>

936
01:03:33,653 --> 01:03:37,294
for the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity at UNM.

937
01:03:37,423 --> 01:03:40,267
And that was before
a new claim of rape.

938
01:03:40,326 --> 01:03:43,205
Digging for answers
after the same Yale frat house</i>

939
01:03:43,296 --> 01:03:45,367
<i>has had</i> a <i>whole bunch of problems.</i>

940
01:03:45,998 --> 01:03:49,207
I'm telling you, almost every time
there's a rape in a fraternity chapter,

941
01:03:49,302 --> 01:03:52,283
there's someone at the university,
certainly the person who's

942
01:03:52,338 --> 01:03:55,319
in the Office of Greek Residence Life,
who's paid for by the university,

943
01:03:55,374 --> 01:04:00,221
he or she knew that that chapter
was likely to have a rape sometime.

944
01:04:00,313 --> 01:04:02,315
<i>But they won't tell the young women.</i>

945
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:06,192
Or if they do, there's hell to pay
for these college presidents.

946
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:10,357
It happened at Wesleyan. There was
a problem fraternity, Beta Theta Pi.

947
01:04:10,488 --> 01:04:14,061
<i>The university sent</i> a <i>letter in the
spring to all students and all parents.</i>

948
01:04:22,167 --> 01:04:24,408
The fraternity went ballistic.

949
01:04:24,502 --> 01:04:27,312
The parents of the fraternity brothers
went ballistic,

950
01:04:27,372 --> 01:04:30,046
and the new class of freshman women
came in, and they didn't send the warning

951
01:04:30,175 --> 01:04:32,815
to the new class of freshman women.
It was Halloween weekend

952
01:04:32,877 --> 01:04:35,153
before a girl
was violently raped upstairs.

953
01:04:35,213 --> 01:04:36,851
<i>Frat house
at Wesleyan University</i>

954
01:04:36,981 --> 01:04:39,928
is facing a lawsuit by a student
who claims she was raped.

955
01:04:40,017 --> 01:04:43,021
And this isn't the first time
that frat has come under fire.

956
01:04:45,022 --> 01:04:47,263
<i>After that rape,
a young woman shows up</i>

957
01:04:47,358 --> 01:04:49,565
<i>at an emergency room
in Middletown, Connecticut.</i>

958
01:04:49,693 --> 01:04:52,173
<i>"I was assaulted at Beta Theta Pi.</i> "

959
01:04:54,732 --> 01:04:59,010
It's, to me, outrageous the extent
that our colleges and universities

960
01:04:59,069 --> 01:05:04,212
are complicit in the sexual assault
of young women at these fraternity houses.

961
01:05:04,341 --> 01:05:07,083
So why don't the schools
just disassociate themselves

962
01:05:07,211 --> 01:05:10,623
from the fraternities
and kick them off campus?

963
01:05:10,713 --> 01:05:14,183
Right. Well, the colleges
and universities have much more to gain

964
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:16,526
from the fraternities
than the fraternities have to gain

965
01:05:16,586 --> 01:05:18,065
from the colleges and universities.

966
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:26,232
<i>One out of every eight college students
living on campus lives in Greek housing.</i>

967
01:05:26,295 --> 01:05:28,775
<i>That's a tremendous amount
of housing stock</i>

968
01:05:28,898 --> 01:05:31,777
<i>the colleges don't have to pay for,
don't have to supervise.</i>

969
01:05:31,901 --> 01:05:36,907
You also have to remember you tie alumni
to your campus in a very powerful way

970
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,144
when you have a fraternity system.

971
01:05:40,909 --> 01:05:43,947
<i>Alumni giving is a massive pan
of your annual giving,</i>

972
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:46,719
<i>and a large part of that
is fraternity membership.</i>

973
01:05:54,589 --> 01:05:57,900
<i>Ifs a deeply powerful industry.</i>

974
01:05:57,959 --> 01:06:01,429
You start tracing back,
and you find out they're pouring money

975
01:06:01,563 --> 01:06:06,012
into political campaigns,
and they're hugely overrepresented.

976
01:06:06,101 --> 01:06:09,605
There's no college or university
or type of college or university

977
01:06:09,671 --> 01:06:14,642
<i>that's more represented within Congress
than the fraternity system itself is.</i>

978
01:06:15,676 --> 01:06:17,917
So people are very loath
to get involved

979
01:06:17,978 --> 01:06:20,982
and very loath to come up
against the fraternity system.

980
01:06:24,285 --> 01:06:26,788
- Checklist? Phone charger?
- Mm-hmm.

981
01:06:26,854 --> 01:06:27,958
- Laptop?
- Mm-hmm.

982
01:06:36,163 --> 01:06:39,007
<i>It's not</i> a <i>coincidence that you
can fly to Boston and fly to California</i>

983
01:06:39,133 --> 01:06:40,976
<i>and hear me same stones.</i>

984
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:44,945
<i>We started visiting
other campuses.</i>

985
01:06:45,004 --> 01:06:47,883
<i>We felt that if we created</i> a <i>model
for how to file</i> a <i>Title IX complaint,</i>

986
01:06:47,974 --> 01:06:49,647
<i>others would do it.</i>

987
01:07:01,321 --> 01:07:05,463
These are our two fraternities
where a student was sexually assaulted.

988
01:07:05,525 --> 01:07:09,029
<i>And it was going there
and being walked to the fraternities</i>

989
01:07:09,129 --> 01:07:12,008
<i>and being walked to where
their assaults had happened.</i>

990
01:07:12,065 --> 01:07:14,636
<i>You know, details that were critical
for every single case.</i>

991
01:07:15,902 --> 01:07:16,902
Weird, right?

992
01:07:18,237 --> 01:07:21,047
So, for the email I'm just gonna...

993
01:07:21,173 --> 01:07:24,017
<i>So we move forward with
this model, saying, "Here's</i> a <i>complaint.</i>

994
01:07:24,076 --> 01:07:26,181
<i>Here's how this process works.“</i>

995
01:07:27,079 --> 01:07:30,219
<i>My 21st birthday,
I was helping students at Swarthmore</i>

996
01:07:30,349 --> 01:07:32,056
<i>file</i> a <i>Title IX complaint.</i>

997
01:07:41,593 --> 01:07:43,903
<i>So I think I went to Columbia
twice before they filed.</i>

998
01:07:44,029 --> 01:07:46,100
<i>Just sat with a group of students
and talked them through</i>

999
01:07:46,198 --> 01:07:47,939
<i>how to file</i> a <i>complaint.</i>

1000
01:07:48,033 --> 01:07:51,445
If people are going to talk publicly,

1001
01:07:51,536 --> 01:07:54,176
then it needs to be about
their treatment here at Columbia.

1002
01:07:54,238 --> 01:07:55,945
- Focus on Columbia.
- Yeah.

1003
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:59,715
<i>We don't have lawyers.
You have 18, 19-year-old students</i>

1004
01:07:59,844 --> 01:08:02,791
<i>who are standing up
to their institutions.</i>

1005
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,453
We are at Amherst
and we found a place to stay.

1006
01:08:07,885 --> 01:08:09,865
Hi, Drea.

1007
01:08:09,921 --> 01:08:14,199
- Where we sleeping tonight?
- Out on the least terrifying parking lot.

1008
01:08:15,459 --> 01:08:19,601
And we are changing and doing stuff
in a Wendy's bathroom. Yay!

1009
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:36,747
I found politicizing my own experience
to be actually the most helpful step.

1010
01:08:37,581 --> 01:08:41,154
<i>It's really exciting to actually
get to meet the other activists.</i>

1011
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:44,664
I had felt so cared for,
until I actually needed Yale,

1012
01:08:44,754 --> 01:08:47,291
at which point I became this,
like, administrative matter.

1013
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:51,805
The administration kept telling us
to "take our foot off the pedal."

1014
01:09:03,138 --> 01:09:05,584
- Hi.
- Hi.

1015
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:08,815
- Nice to meet you. I'm Annie.
- I'm Rachel. Nice to meet you.

1016
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:13,121
I just decided to take some time off,
kind of... I moved here with my sister,

1017
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:15,253
and I've been a nanny,

1018
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:18,196
- and it's the most amazing thing, so...
- That's so cool. Yeah.

1019
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:23,669
And, uh, seeing the two little girls
that I nanny for, I like...

1020
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,137
One of the reasons I've wanted
to do this is, like, I never want...

1021
01:09:31,499 --> 01:09:35,174
them to ever have to deal
with something like this.

1022
01:09:37,639 --> 01:09:44,056
So it's really late, and we have
a survivor who's cutting,

1023
01:09:44,145 --> 01:09:46,853
and, um, she doesn't know
if she can stop.

1024
01:09:50,318 --> 01:09:52,730
<i>The worst pan for me
has been having to relive</i>

1025
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:54,731
<i>the experience of everybody else.</i>

1026
01:09:54,822 --> 01:09:58,234
<i>This vicarious trauma
that I couldn't process anymore.</i>

1027
01:09:58,325 --> 01:10:02,330
It's just not fair.
It's really not fair.

1028
01:10:04,631 --> 01:10:07,009
<i>But it's the only way
I get up in the morning.</i>

1029
01:10:08,168 --> 01:10:10,546
<i>I would've given anything to have had
someone who believed me,</i>

1030
01:10:10,671 --> 01:10:12,344
<i>someone who supported me.</i>

1031
01:10:19,513 --> 01:10:22,221
"Hi!
"Hi!

1032
01:10:22,349 --> 01:10:23,828
- Hi, I'm Andrea.
- I'm Abby.

1033
01:10:23,884 --> 01:10:25,420
- Nice to meet you, Abby.
- Nice to meet you.

1034
01:10:25,519 --> 01:10:27,499
- Andrea. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Good to meet you.

1035
01:10:28,487 --> 01:10:32,526
I was raped by a basketball player
at the University of Tulsa.

1036
01:10:32,658 --> 01:10:36,504
And I felt like,
because he was an athlete,

1037
01:10:36,562 --> 01:10:42,205
everyone was acting like he's worth
more than I am because he's an athlete.

1038
01:10:42,335 --> 01:10:45,043
And that's what happens
over and over and over again.

1039
01:10:45,171 --> 01:10:47,617
It's like you need to re-read
your mission statement.

1040
01:10:47,707 --> 01:10:50,881
Are you here to play sports? Or are you
here to educate and protect your students?

1041
01:10:52,845 --> 01:10:56,224
An alleged sexual assault case
involving three basketball players.

1042
01:10:56,349 --> 01:11:00,125
Four former Vanderbilt University
football players are charged with rape.

1043
01:11:00,218 --> 01:11:03,791
<i>Derrick Washington
already had</i> a <i>documented history</i>

1044
01:11:03,888 --> 01:11:05,799
<i>of violence against women at Missouri.</i>

1045
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:08,598
<i>It was former
Michigan kicker Brendan Gibbons</i>

1046
01:11:08,727 --> 01:11:12,607
<i>involved in the alleged sexual assault
of a woman back in 2009.</i>

1047
01:11:12,731 --> 01:11:16,577
This is the fifth student athlete to be
accused of sexual assault on campus.

1048
01:11:25,076 --> 01:11:27,647
<i>I really do believe
the vast majority of student athletes</i>

1049
01:11:27,746 --> 01:11:28,952
are worthy of our admiration.

1050
01:11:29,047 --> 01:11:31,391
I think they're mostly,
for the most part,

1051
01:11:31,449 --> 01:11:33,587
a lot of good people out there
who are trying to do the right thing.

1052
01:11:34,618 --> 01:11:39,590
<i>But when you have 18 to 22-year-old kids
who are celebrities,</i>

1053
01:11:39,723 --> 01:11:44,502
<i>it creates</i> a <i>toxic environment
for</i> a <i>lot of bad behavior.</i>

1054
01:11:45,262 --> 01:11:48,266
<i>When they walk across campus,
ifs not like any other student</i>

1055
01:11:48,399 --> 01:11:49,776
<i>walking across campus.</i>

1056
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:54,110
There's a multi-billion dollar industry
that wraps around these young men,

1057
01:11:54,171 --> 01:11:57,118
and if you don't think that they're
part of a culture of entitlement,

1058
01:11:57,174 --> 01:11:59,620
just look at the fanfare
that's around college football.

1059
01:12:19,462 --> 01:12:21,464
<i>I grew up in Zephyrhills, Florida.</i>

1060
01:12:21,597 --> 01:12:25,101
<i>Ifs a small town,
so everybody does know everybody.</i>

1061
01:12:25,168 --> 01:12:27,114
<i>I've lived there my entire life.</i>

1062
01:12:28,137 --> 01:12:32,051
I did very well in high school.
I graduated with honors.

1063
01:12:32,141 --> 01:12:35,122
I took a lot of AP and honors classes.

1064
01:12:36,311 --> 01:12:39,656
<i>When I was younger,
a family friend of ours</i>

1065
01:12:39,781 --> 01:12:42,523
<i>gave me a Florida State
cheer-leading uniform,</i>

1066
01:12:42,651 --> 01:12:44,358
<i>and it came with pom-poms.</i>

1067
01:12:44,486 --> 01:12:49,128
<i>She was the best child
any father could have.</i>

1068
01:12:49,191 --> 01:12:53,970
She was fabulous. Never any problems.
Always had a great smile.

1069
01:12:54,029 --> 01:12:56,509
Just a joy to be around.

1070
01:12:56,565 --> 01:13:00,570
<i>She kept saying she was going
to FSU, going to FSU,</i>

1071
01:13:00,669 --> 01:13:02,649
<i>and then when she first got there,</i>

1072
01:13:02,704 --> 01:13:05,480
<i>I knew she made the right choice.</i>

1073
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:10,181
My first semester was really...
It was a lot of science classes.

1074
01:13:10,244 --> 01:13:14,693
I was in six classes.
I wanted to go to med school.

1075
01:13:14,748 --> 01:13:18,355
I didn't go out a lot just because
I was in a lot of classes.

1076
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:26,069
<i>So it was the week before finals,
and we drove to Potbelly's,</i>

1077
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:28,764
<i>and we were just hanging out.</i>

1078
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:31,366
<i>This guy started following me around,</i>

1079
01:13:31,499 --> 01:13:35,379
and I, like, said to him, "What...? Stop."
You know? "Stop following us."

1080
01:13:35,503 --> 01:13:38,575
And a man standing at the bar

1081
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:42,551
saw that I was uncomfortable
with this guy following me,

1082
01:13:42,675 --> 01:13:45,451
and so he kind of like,
grabbed me and was like,

1083
01:13:45,545 --> 01:13:48,253
"This is my girlfriend.
Leave her alone."

1084
01:13:48,381 --> 01:13:50,383
And I was like, "Thank you."
Like, the guy left,

1085
01:13:50,517 --> 01:13:51,894
and I was just like, "Thank you."

1086
01:13:52,018 --> 01:13:55,397
And he's like, "Do you wanna take a shot?"
And I said, "Sure."

1087
01:13:55,522 --> 01:13:58,560
So I turned around, like,
to make sure that this guy was gone,

1088
01:13:58,691 --> 01:14:01,570
<i>and when I turned back around
he handed me a shot.</i>

1089
01:14:04,564 --> 01:14:08,239
<i>I'm fairly certain that there was
something in that drink.</i>

1090
01:14:08,301 --> 01:14:11,281
As a college student,
I had been drunk before,

1091
01:14:11,403 --> 01:14:14,043
and I had not drank nearly enough

1092
01:14:14,106 --> 01:14:17,610
to become drunk
and incompetent that night.

1093
01:14:19,811 --> 01:14:24,760
<i>T remember being in a cab,
and there were three guys in the cab also.</i>

1094
01:14:25,918 --> 01:14:29,957
<i>Anyone you ask would tell you, like,
I never would go home with</i> a <i>guy, period,</i>

1095
01:14:30,088 --> 01:14:33,399
<i>and especially not three people
that! didn't know.</i>

1096
01:14:34,259 --> 01:14:37,331
<i>I remember specific things after that.</i>

1097
01:14:37,429 --> 01:14:40,137
<i>I was in, like, an apartment,</i>

1098
01:14:40,265 --> 01:14:43,768
and this guy was...

1099
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:47,474
sexually assaulting me.
He was raping me.

1100
01:14:47,605 --> 01:14:50,449
He was on top of me,
and I couldn't really breathe that much,

1101
01:14:50,575 --> 01:14:53,579
but I was saying,
"Please stop. Stop."

1102
01:14:53,644 --> 01:14:58,821
Like, I remember his roommate,
or whoever this other guy was,

1103
01:14:58,950 --> 01:15:02,659
came in and he was saying,
"Dude, stop. Like, what are you doing?

1104
01:15:02,787 --> 01:15:05,461
<i>She's telling you to stop."</i>

1105
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:08,002
<i>Since his door
to the bedroom wouldn't lock,</i>

1106
01:15:08,125 --> 01:15:12,471
<i>he picked me up
and he carried me into the bathroom.</i>

1107
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:15,703
<i>He said, “The door will lock in here.“</i>

1108
01:15:15,799 --> 01:15:19,679
<i>He put me on the tile bathroom floor.</i>

1109
01:15:19,803 --> 01:15:24,946
I was trying to, like, push him off
and kick him off, but he was just too big.

1110
01:15:25,008 --> 01:15:28,285
And I said, "Please stop"
multiple times, and I said "no."

1111
01:15:28,345 --> 01:15:34,057
Eventually he pushed his hand over my face
and, like, pushed my face into the floor.

1112
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:35,652
Um...

1113
01:15:35,719 --> 01:15:39,189
And he just continued to rape me.

1114
01:15:40,991 --> 01:15:47,566
<i>He finished and then he put my clothes
back on, and he said, “You can leave now."</i>

1115
01:15:47,663 --> 01:15:50,735
<i>And then he's like,
“H! take you home on my scooter.“</i>

1116
01:15:50,833 --> 01:15:54,474
I mean...okay.
I had no idea where I was.

1117
01:15:54,536 --> 01:15:56,413
I didn't know how else
I was supposed to get home.

1118
01:15:56,505 --> 01:15:59,315
<i>I wanted to get out of there.</i>

1119
01:16:00,843 --> 01:16:05,519
<i>This was the worst feeling because
I didn't wanna hold onto him, you know?</i>

1120
01:16:05,648 --> 01:16:09,687
<i>But I was afraid
that I was gonna fall off of the scooter.</i>

1121
01:16:09,752 --> 01:16:12,528
<i>He dropped me off
at the intersection where I told him</i>

1122
01:16:12,588 --> 01:16:15,159
<i>because I didn't want him
to know where I lived.</i>

1123
01:16:15,224 --> 01:16:19,365
<i>I didn't know really
what I was supposed to do.</i>

1124
01:16:20,895 --> 01:16:23,705
<i>I tweeted, "Someone help me.</i> "

1125
01:16:25,767 --> 01:16:27,678
<i>My friend responded, and she was like,</i>

1126
01:16:27,735 --> 01:16:29,237
<i>“Well, tell me what happened.“</i>

1127
01:16:29,837 --> 01:16:31,009
And we decided that

1128
01:16:31,072 --> 01:16:32,449
we need to call the police.

1129
01:16:32,707 --> 01:16:35,347
- You said she was raped?
- Yeah.

1130
01:16:35,410 --> 01:16:38,619
- Okay, so she did not know the person.
- No.

1131
01:16:40,081 --> 01:16:42,618
<i>The Florida State University
Police took me</i>

1132
01:16:42,717 --> 01:16:46,096
<i>in the back of</i> a <i>police car
to the hospital.</i>

1133
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:51,464
I got all of the, um...the blood work
and the rape kit and everything.

1134
01:16:51,558 --> 01:16:55,096
They were watching bruises appear
as I was laying in the hospital bed.

1135
01:16:55,228 --> 01:16:59,540
We got a call about three in the morning.
We grabbed some stuff,

1136
01:16:59,599 --> 01:17:01,476
and we jumped in the car

1137
01:17:01,568 --> 01:17:04,378
<i>and started heading to FSU
as quick as we could.</i>

1138
01:17:05,405 --> 01:17:09,080
She was laying in the hospital bed,
and we each went to one side,

1139
01:17:09,142 --> 01:17:14,319
and we just held her, and all three of us
laid there-- sat there, and cried.

1140
01:17:16,450 --> 01:17:20,091
<i>That's when
Investigator Angulo came in.</i>

1141
01:17:20,153 --> 01:17:22,462
<i>And I told him kind of everything.</i>

1142
01:17:23,823 --> 01:17:26,133
I'm very pro law enforcement.

1143
01:17:26,258 --> 01:17:31,435
And Tallahassee PD was there, and we
assumed they were taking care of things.

1144
01:17:59,824 --> 01:18:02,634
<i>I went back
in the beginning of January.</i>

1145
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:07,540
<i>It was my first class on Tuesday,
and I see him walk into the class.</i>

1146
01:18:07,632 --> 01:18:09,612
And I knew.
I was like, "That's him."

1147
01:18:10,969 --> 01:18:14,280
<i>They were about to take attendance,
and that's what-- I needed to stay calm</i>

1148
01:18:14,339 --> 01:18:17,183
<i>and just kind of wait it out.</i>

1149
01:18:17,275 --> 01:18:20,051
He was one of the very last names
that they called,

1150
01:18:20,145 --> 01:18:22,147
and, um...

1151
01:18:22,213 --> 01:18:25,319
my teacher said, "Jameis Winston?"
And he raised his hand.

1152
01:18:25,383 --> 01:18:27,828
<i>I didn't know who he was.</i>

1153
01:18:27,885 --> 01:18:30,365
<i>The nation's
number one high school quarterback,</i>

1154
01:18:30,487 --> 01:18:34,401
<i>Jameis Winston, won Gatorade State
Player of the Year this past season.</i>

1155
01:18:34,491 --> 01:18:36,801
Jameis, tell me why
you chose Florida State.

1156
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:39,568
Just because we're trying to build
a tradition there,

1157
01:18:39,663 --> 01:18:41,700
and hopefully we can get
a few national championships

1158
01:18:41,832 --> 01:18:43,004
and hopefully a Heisman Trophy.

1159
01:18:43,066 --> 01:18:46,912
<i>I notified
Investigator Angulo of who it was.</i>

1160
01:18:47,004 --> 01:18:51,851
<i>I think at that point he knew that
he was gonna be the big football star.</i>

1161
01:18:51,909 --> 01:18:54,082
He said,
"This is a huge football town.

1162
01:18:54,178 --> 01:18:56,317
<i>You really should think long and hard</i>

1163
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:59,383
<i>about whether you want
to press charges or not.“</i>

1164
01:19:05,521 --> 01:19:07,432
<i>It didn't make sense to me, realty.</i>

1165
01:19:07,523 --> 01:19:11,938
<i>I...</i> I just thought,
like, you know, that's his job.

1166
01:19:12,028 --> 01:19:14,770
Why isn't he...?
Why is he not gonna do it?

1167
01:19:30,245 --> 01:19:31,724
The hype for Jameis Winston <i>is</i>

1168
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:34,590
<i>as much as I've ever seen
for a first-year starting quarterback.</i>

1169
01:19:34,683 --> 01:19:36,856
Winston, Winston! Winston!

1170
01:19:36,918 --> 01:19:38,795
<i>Into the end zone!
Touchdown, Florida State.</i>

1171
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:45,565
Sports teams are the business
on these campuses.

1172
01:19:46,461 --> 01:19:50,432
<i>When you build stadiums
that cost 200, 300 million dollars,</i>

1173
01:19:50,565 --> 01:19:53,603
<i>when you build athletic facilities
that can get up into that range as well,</i>

1174
01:19:53,735 --> 01:19:56,909
<i>and then you look at the
multibillion dollar television contracts.</i>

1175
01:19:56,972 --> 01:19:59,111
<i>When you're talking
about that kind of money,</i>

1176
01:19:59,241 --> 01:20:01,982
there's an enormous investment
in a student athlete

1177
01:20:02,076 --> 01:20:06,115
who may be a quarterback
on a top 20 team

1178
01:20:06,247 --> 01:20:09,251
that's pulling in hundreds of millions
of dollars in revenue.

1179
01:20:09,383 --> 01:20:11,454
Nineteen-year-old Winston <i>is</i> on the verge

1180
01:20:11,585 --> 01:20:13,997
<i>of leading his team
to the ultimate victory.</i>

1181
01:20:14,088 --> 01:20:16,830
Our main goal is to win
a national championship.

1182
01:20:16,924 --> 01:20:19,097
<i>He's had</i> a <i>meteoric rise to fame,</i>

1183
01:20:19,226 --> 01:20:21,604
<i>becoming the starting quarterback
as a freshman.</i>

1184
01:20:22,263 --> 01:20:24,971
He's a star on the team,
and that doesn't mean he's guilty,

1185
01:20:25,099 --> 01:20:28,979
but the point is you have to treat
that person like you would

1186
01:20:29,103 --> 01:20:32,949
anyone else in these cases,
and that didn't happen here.

1187
01:20:33,073 --> 01:20:36,679
Poised to play in and possibly win
the national championship,

1188
01:20:36,776 --> 01:20:38,687
a frontrunner
for the Heisman Trophy award,

1189
01:20:38,778 --> 01:20:40,951
Florida State quarterback,
Jameis Winston,

1190
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:44,186
now possibly finds himself
in some hot water.

1191
01:20:44,284 --> 01:20:46,958
Winston is part
of an ongoing investigation

1192
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:50,297
into a sexual assault complaint
filed nearly a year ago,

1193
01:20:50,423 --> 01:20:53,029
but today was turned over
to the state attorney.

1194
01:20:53,126 --> 01:20:55,697
As soon as I saw this story break,

1195
01:20:55,795 --> 01:21:00,869
I thought how terribly, terribly unfair
it is to this young man.

1196
01:21:00,967 --> 01:21:03,880
I think it's very, very unfortunate
that this young dude

1197
01:21:03,970 --> 01:21:08,714
with this Magic Johnson caliber smile
and a level of production

1198
01:21:08,807 --> 01:21:12,516
and the things that he has done en route
to pursuing a national championship,

1199
01:21:12,644 --> 01:21:16,649
and the Heisman Trophy,
and now it comes out?

1200
01:21:16,782 --> 01:21:18,523
It just stinks to me.

1201
01:21:24,323 --> 01:21:28,863
DNA analysis confirmed
the DNA provided by Winston

1202
01:21:28,994 --> 01:21:31,804
matched that sample
taken from the accuser.

1203
01:21:33,332 --> 01:21:36,643
Although he has never spoken directly
to cops or prosecutors,

1204
01:21:36,702 --> 01:21:40,342
Jameis Winston, through his attorneys,
maintains his innocence

1205
01:21:40,404 --> 01:21:42,816
<i>and says any sex was consensual.</i>

1206
01:21:43,374 --> 01:21:46,548
Jameis Winston!
He's into the promised land!

1207
01:21:46,677 --> 01:21:48,350
<i>Touchdown, FSU!</i>

1208
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:51,688
<i><i>His voice, his way, his team.</i>

1209
01:21:52,583 --> 01:21:55,757
<i>Our football team
kept winning games.</i>

1210
01:21:55,853 --> 01:21:58,493
<i>We were gonna play
in the national championship.</i>

1211
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:02,398
<i>AH these people were praising him.</i>

1212
01:22:02,493 --> 01:22:06,600
People were just calling me names:
a slut, a whore.

1213
01:22:07,531 --> 01:22:08,942
<i>I got a tweet</i>

1214
01:22:09,033 --> 01:22:12,036
<i>from a girl who I didn't know.</i>

1215
01:22:12,102 --> 01:22:14,605
<i>The tweet was like, “Why would you blame</i>

1216
01:22:14,704 --> 01:22:17,617
<i>such a good guy for doing this?“</i>

1217
01:22:17,707 --> 01:22:22,178
<i>People were threatening me, my family.</i>

1218
01:22:22,245 --> 01:22:25,590
<i>And there was other people
that were threatening my sorority,</i>

1219
01:22:25,715 --> 01:22:28,218
<i>saying, “We're gonna
burn down their house.“</i>

1220
01:22:29,552 --> 01:22:32,556
<i>Jameis Winston
will not be charged with the rape</i>

1221
01:22:32,689 --> 01:22:35,465
<i>that allegedly happened
exactly a year ago.</i>

1222
01:22:35,558 --> 01:22:39,734
<i>Here's prosecutor
and FSU alumni Willie Meggs.</i>

1223
01:22:39,863 --> 01:22:42,433
We've carefully examined
all the evidence in this case

1224
01:22:42,564 --> 01:22:49,106
and have concluded that no charges
will be filed against anyone in this case.

1225
01:22:49,238 --> 01:22:52,412
Do you think
Jameis Winston raped that girl?

1226
01:22:52,541 --> 01:22:57,251
Uh... I think I did not have
sufficient evidence

1227
01:22:57,379 --> 01:23:02,419
to prove that he sexually assaulted her
against her will.

1228
01:23:03,385 --> 01:23:04,659
Uh...

1229
01:23:04,753 --> 01:23:10,169
I think things that happened there
that night were...not good.

1230
01:23:10,993 --> 01:23:13,302
<i>As FSU fights for the national title,</i>

1231
01:23:13,428 --> 01:23:15,135
<i>the alleged victim drops out of school.</i>

1232
01:23:15,229 --> 01:23:19,109
<i>FSU football fans are
predictably delighted by this result.</i>

1233
01:23:21,135 --> 01:23:23,445
Florida State! Whoo!

1234
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:28,177
- Jameis Winston.
- He's amazing! What a great guy.

1235
01:23:28,276 --> 01:23:30,950
Jameis Christ. That's it.

1236
01:23:31,012 --> 01:23:34,619
The justice system was proved right.
Right? It worked.

1237
01:23:34,749 --> 01:23:39,823
Every school in the country
that's a big time powerhouse football team

1238
01:23:39,954 --> 01:23:41,934
has players dealing with this shit.

1239
01:23:41,989 --> 01:23:46,300
Some girl got jealous and wanted to be
like, a part of the scene, you know.

1240
01:23:46,426 --> 01:23:48,929
She was a liar.

1241
01:23:50,263 --> 01:23:52,641
Football star, Jameis Winston,
Florida State quarterback,

1242
01:23:52,766 --> 01:23:54,609
had the game
of his young life Monday,

1243
01:23:54,668 --> 01:23:57,148
<i>when he led the Seminoles
to the national championship.</i>

1244
01:24:23,729 --> 01:24:26,642
<i>Sexual assault cases
are always tough.</i>

1245
01:24:26,699 --> 01:24:30,044
<i>Probably the first time
someone is apprehended</i>

1246
01:24:30,169 --> 01:24:33,241
is not the first time that they have...

1247
01:24:33,339 --> 01:24:37,014
engaged in forceful conduct on someone.

1248
01:24:37,076 --> 01:24:43,027
I went to see my victim's advocate.
And in that meeting, we were just talking.

1249
01:24:43,149 --> 01:24:48,155
She was like, "We just wanna let you know,
like, there's another victim from him."

1250
01:24:50,021 --> 01:24:54,993
<i>It's my pleasure to announce
the 2013 Heisman Memorial Trophy winner.</i>

1251
01:24:55,059 --> 01:24:57,938
Jameis Winston,
Florida State University!

1252
01:25:04,369 --> 01:25:07,441
<i>Is it hard for you to believe
that this all has happened?</i>

1253
01:25:11,276 --> 01:25:13,882
I kinda just wanna know, like...

1254
01:25:15,947 --> 01:25:17,392
Why me?

1255
01:25:31,295 --> 01:25:33,639
It doesn't really make sense.

1256
01:25:38,602 --> 01:25:40,479
<i>He won the Heisman Trophy,</i>

1257
01:25:40,571 --> 01:25:43,916
<i>and the sad thing about that
is that the world of college football</i>

1258
01:25:43,974 --> 01:25:46,784
didn't hold him accountable for the kind
of person that he is off the field.

1259
01:25:49,246 --> 01:25:52,159
<i>The system is based
largely on money.</i>

1260
01:25:52,915 --> 01:25:55,259
<i>And ifs not just revenue
in terms of TV revenue,</i>

1261
01:25:55,384 --> 01:25:59,093
<i>but it's also revenue
in terms of alumni and trustees.</i>

1262
01:25:59,889 --> 01:26:03,598
<i>We need to remember where
the power really lies on these campuses.</i>

1263
01:26:03,726 --> 01:26:06,297
Presidents hire athletic directors.

1264
01:26:06,395 --> 01:26:08,773
Athletic directors hire coaches.

1265
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:12,074
Coaches then receive salaries
that are higher than the president.

1266
01:26:12,134 --> 01:26:14,978
- Tell me your title.
- President of Florida State University.

1267
01:26:15,071 --> 01:26:17,745
Wow! So you've got to be
the happiest man on earth.

1268
01:26:17,807 --> 01:26:22,847
You know what? I think it's hard to find
a happier person. No doubt about it.

1269
01:26:22,945 --> 01:26:26,118
<i>These cases are nightmares
for college presidents.</i>

1270
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:30,627
This is college presidents
who hold their nose and cover their ears

1271
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:33,427
because they know that this
is part of what comes

1272
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:35,798
<i>with the big business of college sports.</i>

1273
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:38,838
<i>There is</i> a <i>great fear
among many presidents</i>

1274
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:43,306
of alienating
important influential people.

1275
01:26:44,633 --> 01:26:49,446
What's the number one responsibility
of a college president? Fund-raising.

1276
01:26:49,504 --> 01:26:52,007
One hundred million dollars
to UC San Diego,

1277
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:54,177
the second largest gift
in the school's history.

1278
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:56,481
Two hundred million dollars.

1279
01:26:56,610 --> 01:27:00,649
That's the gift University of Michigan
alum Stephen Ross has given to the school.

1280
01:27:00,781 --> 01:27:04,957
Harvard University has received the
largest donation in the school's history,

1281
01:27:05,019 --> 01:27:07,295
350 million dollars.

1282
01:27:07,354 --> 01:27:09,197
<i>Good lord, that's</i> a <i>lot of money.</i>

1283
01:27:10,724 --> 01:27:11,964
<i>Colleges are big business.</i>

1284
01:27:12,026 --> 01:27:15,303
<i>They have boards mat are trying
to maintain their endowments,</i>

1285
01:27:15,362 --> 01:27:17,308
<i>and they don't want anything
that's going to touch that.</i>

1286
01:27:17,364 --> 01:27:21,312
This is about millions and billions
of dollars being spent every year

1287
01:27:21,368 --> 01:27:22,972
to keep this institution running.

1288
01:27:23,037 --> 01:27:28,384
Harvard is in the midst
of a six billion dollar capital campaign.

1289
01:27:29,742 --> 01:27:32,518
<i>Donors might be troubled
if they understood the magnitude</i>

1290
01:27:32,578 --> 01:27:34,888
<i>of sexual assault on the campus.</i>

1291
01:27:35,014 --> 01:27:38,359
<i>I think that's part of the effort
to silence the problem.</i>

1292
01:27:40,687 --> 01:27:45,659
Numerous times I was taken aside
by a senior tenured female faculty person

1293
01:27:45,725 --> 01:27:48,569
and told the way to make it at Harvard
is by being a dutiful daughter.

1294
01:27:48,695 --> 01:27:51,767
If you hear it, pretend you didn't.

1295
01:27:51,864 --> 01:27:54,777
If you see it, you shut up about it.

1296
01:27:54,867 --> 01:27:56,210
Silence.

1297
01:28:19,257 --> 01:28:22,136
There's a reason we haven't seen
more faculty involved.

1298
01:28:22,227 --> 01:28:26,141
It does harm your career
in ways that you can't even predict.

1299
01:28:26,231 --> 01:28:28,939
Certainly if you're nontenured,
but even if you are tenured,

1300
01:28:29,034 --> 01:28:31,878
it makes it much more difficult
to move from one institution to the next

1301
01:28:31,937 --> 01:28:34,280
if you've been branded
an activist or a troublemaker.

1302
01:28:34,372 --> 01:28:35,817
I've had the honor
to work with students

1303
01:28:35,906 --> 01:28:37,476
who've been asking
these kinds of questions

1304
01:28:37,575 --> 01:28:39,748
for the five years
that I've been here.

1305
01:28:39,810 --> 01:28:41,653
We heard that things
were gonna happen,

1306
01:28:41,746 --> 01:28:43,783
but then there was
no conversation about it.

1307
01:28:43,914 --> 01:28:46,485
And I think there's a huge gap
in between that still needs to,

1308
01:28:46,584 --> 01:28:49,758
A, be bridged,
and to be discussed more publicly.

1309
01:29:08,671 --> 01:29:13,780
I feel like there's this moral high ground
in higher education

1310
01:29:13,843 --> 01:29:15,823
that is just sitting vacant.

1311
01:29:15,912 --> 01:29:19,621
What I haven't yet seen
anywhere, that I'm aware of,

1312
01:29:19,682 --> 01:29:23,755
is a president who has decided

1313
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:28,291
that whatever it takes,
it has to be done.

1314
01:29:28,358 --> 01:29:29,928
And that's what leadership is.

1315
01:29:29,993 --> 01:29:33,440
...that we would tolerate
for one moment

1316
01:29:33,496 --> 01:29:36,806
sexual violence and intimidation
on our campus.

1317
01:29:36,865 --> 01:29:39,709
These assumptions are patently false,

1318
01:29:39,802 --> 01:29:43,648
and such speculations are
very, very inappropriate.

1319
01:30:46,666 --> 01:30:49,772
At the end of the day,
I think we share all the same goals,

1320
01:30:49,870 --> 01:30:54,546
which is to create a safe place
where all our students can thrive.

1321
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:12,191
Of your 25 possible complainants,
how many of them are survivors?

1322
01:31:12,258 --> 01:31:13,430
Twenty.

1323
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:16,398
How many are willing to go public?

1324
01:31:17,897 --> 01:31:21,037
Um, probably five.

1325
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:22,875
So what about
just a press conference?

1326
01:31:22,935 --> 01:31:24,744
Yeah. That, I think could be good.

1327
01:31:36,715 --> 01:31:40,424
<i>Good morning and thank you for
your attendance at this important event.</i>

1328
01:31:40,553 --> 01:31:42,931
My name is Sofie Karasek,
and I'm a third year student

1329
01:31:43,055 --> 01:31:44,761
here at the University
of California Berkeley.

1330
01:31:44,889 --> 01:31:46,459
My name is Meghan Warner.

1331
01:31:46,558 --> 01:31:47,969
My name is Iman Stenson.

1332
01:31:48,059 --> 01:31:50,335
My name is Shannon Thomas,
and I'm a proud fourth year,

1333
01:31:50,428 --> 01:31:51,839
soon to be graduate,
of UC Berkeley.

1334
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:55,844
<i>I'm</i> a <i>survivor of a sexual assault
that occurred less than</i> a <i>year ago.</i>

1335
01:31:55,934 --> 01:31:58,175
I didn't realize at the time
that the nightmare I was in

1336
01:31:58,269 --> 01:32:00,442
was not limited
to the night of the assault.

1337
01:32:00,572 --> 01:32:04,179
<i>The process that followed is far
more upsetting than the assault itself.</i>

1338
01:32:04,275 --> 01:32:06,516
When I looked at resources
from the university online,

1339
01:32:06,644 --> 01:32:08,453
I saw that most were
for the perpetrator,

1340
01:32:08,513 --> 01:32:11,357
including an info-graphic
for what to do if you're accused,

1341
01:32:11,449 --> 01:32:13,326
<i>not what to do
if you're</i> a <i>survivor seeking help.</i>

1342
01:32:13,418 --> 01:32:15,954
She made me feel like
what happened to me wasn't real,

1343
01:32:16,019 --> 01:32:18,522
like it wasn't a big deal,
like it was my fault.

1344
01:32:18,622 --> 01:32:19,828
- My fault.
- My fault.

1345
01:32:19,923 --> 01:32:22,164
Sexual assault at UC Berkley
is an epidemic.

1346
01:32:23,493 --> 01:32:26,599
<i>Several female students
say they were sexually assaulted</i>

1347
01:32:26,663 --> 01:32:30,611
on the University of California campus,
but they weren't taken seriously.

1348
01:32:31,935 --> 01:32:35,109
<i>We were tracking the media frame
and how it changed and where it spiked</i>

1349
01:32:35,172 --> 01:32:37,015
<i>and what articles worked and what didn't.</i>

1350
01:32:37,107 --> 01:32:40,350
These students who spoke today
went from sexual assault victims

1351
01:32:40,444 --> 01:32:42,947
to survivors and now activists.

1352
01:32:43,013 --> 01:32:44,686
Their efforts are gaining
the attention...

1353
01:32:44,781 --> 01:32:47,727
<i>We saw what was effective,
and that was personal narrative</i>

1354
01:32:47,817 --> 01:32:50,627
<i>and putting a face
and a name to the issues.</i>

1355
01:32:51,787 --> 01:32:53,460
My name is Carolyn Luby.

1356
01:32:53,522 --> 01:32:55,559
My name is Alexa Schwartz.

1357
01:32:55,658 --> 01:32:59,071
My name is Ari Mostov,
and I would like to provide you

1358
01:32:59,161 --> 01:33:02,074
<i>with a more personal account
of the kind of abuses that occurred here</i>

1359
01:33:02,164 --> 01:33:04,405
<i>at the University of Southern California.</i>

1360
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:07,970
<i>My name is Hope Brinn.
Fm a sophomore at Swarthmore.</i>

1361
01:33:08,037 --> 01:33:11,712
I was sexually assaulted and stalked
by fellow students on this campus.

1362
01:33:11,807 --> 01:33:14,185
<i>I was raped during
my freshman year at Occidental.</i>

1363
01:33:14,243 --> 01:33:18,885
I wish that I had not been discouraged
by a dean from reporting my rape.

1364
01:33:18,981 --> 01:33:22,018
I'm filing as the lead complainant
against the University of Connecticut.

1365
01:33:22,083 --> 01:33:24,893
- Against UC Berkeley.
- Against the institution that I love.

1366
01:33:28,056 --> 01:33:31,230
Okay, let's go!

1367
01:33:48,176 --> 01:33:51,247
<i>Seeing students
over the last year to two years</i>

1368
01:33:51,345 --> 01:33:53,689
<i>almost taking control of this...</i>

1369
01:33:54,682 --> 01:33:57,185
<i>for me ifs been
a miraculous thing to witness.</i>

1370
01:33:58,352 --> 01:34:00,855
<i>For my senior thesis,
I will be carrying the mattress with me</i>

1371
01:34:00,921 --> 01:34:03,197
as long as he's still on this campus.

1372
01:34:04,358 --> 01:34:07,601
<i>Our individual stories
are what makes this</i> a <i>story.</i>

1373
01:34:07,695 --> 01:34:11,233
<i>Here is the experience
of 700 survivors,</i>

1374
01:34:11,298 --> 01:34:15,144
<i>and unless something happens,
ifs not going to change.</i>

1375
01:34:15,235 --> 01:34:19,149
<i>There is a revolution
happening on campuses across the country,</i>

1376
01:34:19,239 --> 01:34:23,653
and I'm very hopeful that this really is
our watershed moment.

1377
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:30,556
We are fed up!

1378
01:34:30,616 --> 01:34:33,222
- With your university!
- Dartmouth has a problem!

1379
01:34:33,286 --> 01:34:34,993
Dartmouth has a problem!

1380
01:34:35,088 --> 01:34:38,501
...of assault and harassment, and today we
decide that we will no longer tolerate it.

1381
01:34:38,591 --> 01:34:40,161
- What do we want?!
- A safe campus!

1382
01:34:40,259 --> 01:34:42,239
- When do we want it?!
- Now!

1383
01:34:42,295 --> 01:34:45,902
We're watching! We're here!
We've made ourselves clear!

1384
01:34:47,066 --> 01:34:48,909
<i>It was happening so quickly.</i>

1385
01:34:49,769 --> 01:34:52,181
<i>I mean, within</i> a <i>year
of our complaint against UNC,</i>

1386
01:34:52,271 --> 01:34:55,149
<i>the issue had shot
to the top of the national agenda.</i>

1387
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,413
<i>Thank you so much
for coming to my office.</i>

1388
01:34:57,476 --> 01:34:59,251
What else do you
think we need to do?

1389
01:34:59,311 --> 01:35:00,984
Do you wanna run
through some of those items

1390
01:35:01,079 --> 01:35:02,149
on the list that we marked off?

1391
01:35:02,247 --> 01:35:04,284
Yeah. Sure, sure, sure.
Yeah, I have my list.

1392
01:35:04,416 --> 01:35:08,330
<i>The week before my senior finals,
I was in D.C. talking to senators.</i>

1393
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:10,093
<i>We have seen an inspiring wave</i>

1394
01:35:10,155 --> 01:35:12,431
of student-led activism
and a growing number of students

1395
01:35:12,491 --> 01:35:15,199
who found the courage
to come forward and report attacks.

1396
01:35:15,794 --> 01:35:19,173
<i>We owe all these brave young people
an extraordinary debt of gratitude,</i>

1397
01:35:19,264 --> 01:35:22,143
<i>but we cannot stop there.</i>

1398
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:26,171
I still hear stories from survivors
whose experiences reporting to the school

1399
01:35:26,271 --> 01:35:28,648
sound exactly like mine.

1400
01:35:28,706 --> 01:35:31,710
<i>Activists all around the country
were speaking out on this issue.</i>

1401
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:35,120
Stand up for justice. Don't let
other students go what I went through.

1402
01:35:35,179 --> 01:35:37,955
<i>It used to be that
the Department of Education</i>

1403
01:35:38,015 --> 01:35:41,189
<i>didn't release names
of who was under investigation,</i>

1404
01:35:41,285 --> 01:35:44,698
<i>but after pressure from</i> a <i>lot of student
activists, they've begun to do that.</i>

1405
01:35:44,789 --> 01:35:47,326
Fifty-five colleges and universities

1406
01:35:47,391 --> 01:35:50,531
facing a Title IX
sexual abuse investigation.

1407
01:35:50,628 --> 01:35:53,905
Sixty universities have been put on notice
by the Department of Education.

1408
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,979
<i>More than 70 schools
nationwide are now under investigation.</i>

1409
01:36:19,322 --> 01:36:22,735
<i>We have over 70
that are currently being investigated.</i>

1410
01:36:23,326 --> 01:36:25,670
<i>When they released
that list of schools,</i>

1411
01:36:25,728 --> 01:36:30,574
<i>that map of where they pinpointed it
matched our map.</i>

1412
01:36:56,625 --> 01:36:58,696
I wanna do a close-up.

1413
01:37:01,063 --> 01:37:02,201
Okay)'-

1414
01:37:13,441 --> 01:37:17,253
Welcome to the 2014
spring commencement

1415
01:37:17,311 --> 01:37:21,259
at the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill.

1416
01:37:31,158 --> 01:37:35,628
Here at Notre Dame, we wanna be
not just another Harvard or Oxford,

1417
01:37:35,729 --> 01:37:40,940
but a Bethlehem, a Nazareth, a Calvary,
a Cane, the upper room at Pentecost.

1418
01:37:42,969 --> 01:37:46,075
<i>You know,
I'm still practicing my faith.</i>

1419
01:37:46,139 --> 01:37:51,088
But something I believed in so long
and had so much trust in just failed.

1420
01:37:51,144 --> 01:37:55,957
I have to remind myself
that people sin and people aren't good.

1421
01:37:56,016 --> 01:37:59,520
And so I just have
to remind myself that.

1422
01:38:07,192 --> 01:38:10,969
<i>What do universities owe the future?</i>

1423
01:38:11,931 --> 01:38:14,878
We owe the future meaning.

1424
01:38:14,967 --> 01:38:18,608
Universities must nurture
the ability to interpret,

1425
01:38:18,671 --> 01:38:20,548
to make critical judgments,

1426
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:23,279
to dare to ask
the biggest questions.

1427
01:38:23,342 --> 01:38:25,845
<i>What is good? What is just?</i>

1428
01:38:28,013 --> 01:38:30,823
<i>You know, I'll see someone
who looks like him on the street,</i>

1429
01:38:30,883 --> 01:38:34,126
and I don't want to say
that I'm afraid of him,

1430
01:38:34,186 --> 01:38:38,190
but, um, yeah, it's shocking.

1431
01:38:38,289 --> 01:38:42,169
It was three years ago,
and it's, um...

1432
01:38:42,226 --> 01:38:43,899
it's still right up here.

1433
01:38:59,877 --> 01:39:05,088
Your reputation is what you have
when you come into Florida State.

1434
01:39:05,183 --> 01:39:08,494
Your character is what you have
when you leave Florida State.

1435
01:39:12,489 --> 01:39:15,368
<i>I know that it was the right
thing to do, to come forward.</i>

1436
01:39:15,425 --> 01:39:18,702
But Investigator Angulo
was right whenever he said

1437
01:39:18,762 --> 01:39:23,268
that I would be driven out
of Tallahassee.

1438
01:39:40,951 --> 01:39:43,362
<i>Andrea Lynn Pino.</i>

1439
01:40:05,074 --> 01:40:08,612
Yeah, my name's Mike,
and my daughter was raped</i>

1440
01:40:08,711 --> 01:40:12,488
at the University of California
Santa Barbara a week and a half ago.

1441
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:17,052
<i>After they were done with her,
they just dumped her.</i>

1442
01:40:18,386 --> 01:40:21,128
<i>When she got back from the hospital,
she called the school</i>

1443
01:40:21,222 --> 01:40:24,135
<i>and told them that
she wanted to go forward.</i>

1444
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:29,631
<i>From there it has been
an absolute joke.</i>

1445
01:40:29,731 --> 01:40:32,735
<i>Nobody up there wants to help us.</i>
