1
00:01:40,092 --> 00:01:41,551
<i>I have a faith.</i>

2
00:01:41,843 --> 00:01:44,572
<i>I believe that there are two types
of people in this building.</i>

3
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:47,366
Guardians and criminals.
Barrister's robes and prison uniforms.

4
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,243
No matter what the situation may be,

5
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:51,827
I believe that we're different
from those whom we need to punish.

6
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,522
Mr. Hwang!

7
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,043
The man, Byung-jun Woo,
did leave the country yesterday.

8
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:58,401
He went to Taipei, Taiwan.

9
00:02:00,612 --> 00:02:02,799
Contact Interpol and ask them
to issue a red notice.

10
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,703
And inform
the Korean Mission in Taipei as well.

11
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,536
- We'll send investigators there.
- Okay, got it.

12
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:30,868
<i>You moved Yeon-jae's money
after making her leave the country,</i>

13
00:02:30,892 --> 00:02:34,354
<i>then you dared to summon Mr. Song
and tried to steal my profit.</i>

14
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:35,897
<i>Did you think I wouldn't know?</i>

15
00:02:36,314 --> 00:02:37,983
Of course you'd know.

16
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,235
<i>What on earth are you up to?</i>

17
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:43,155
Killing Eun-soo...
It was your doing, wasn't it?

18
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:49,786
Stop spewing such nonsense.
You're being ridiculous.

19
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,289
<i>You told Mr. Woo to do the job</i>

20
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,393
<i>and sent him abroad after, didn't you?</i>

21
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,919
You're much sneakier
than I thought you could be, Chang-jun.

22
00:02:58,753 --> 00:02:59,753
Was this your plan?

23
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:02,358
<i>Will you say that I instigated murder
to threaten me</i>

24
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,102
<i>so that you can take
a hefty amount from me?</i>

25
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,803
The killer has already been caught.

26
00:03:07,429 --> 00:03:09,306
I've never even met that guy.

27
00:03:10,098 --> 00:03:13,435
He didn't kill Eun-soo.

28
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:15,936
Is there evidence?

29
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,396
I'm the evidence.

30
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:19,106
What do you mean?

31
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:23,737
Moo-sung Park and Ga-young Kim.

32
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,405
It was me.

33
00:03:28,783 --> 00:03:30,702
The guy who got arrested is just a blade.

34
00:03:31,703 --> 00:03:33,463
I'm the one who held the handle
of the knife.

35
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:34,891
Why?

36
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,333
You'll find out soon.

37
00:03:38,335 --> 00:03:40,462
All right, I've told you everything.

38
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:44,567
Now, it's time for you to be honest,
Father.

39
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,384
I don't know anything about it.

40
00:03:48,136 --> 00:03:49,262
Chang-jun.

41
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:54,726
We've been a family
for a pretty long time.

42
00:03:55,352 --> 00:03:57,062
<i>Why have we become like this?</i>

43
00:03:57,854 --> 00:03:59,314
PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

44
00:04:01,983 --> 00:04:03,151
I have to go.

45
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,029
Take care.

46
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,617
END THE CALL WITH FATHER

47
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:13,662
THE CALL HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY RECORDED.

48
00:04:30,262 --> 00:04:33,241
Freeze all bank accounts
under Chang-jun's name,

49
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:35,225
and tell them to stop all withdrawals
immediately.

50
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:46,111
<i>Speak of the devil.</i>

51
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:48,756
Were you talking about me?

52
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,448
I was thinking about you.

53
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:55,912
You can stop thinking. Let's meet up, sir.

54
00:04:57,872 --> 00:05:00,518
Hold on. Mr. Hwang, which investigators
would you like to send to Taiwan?

55
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:03,086
- Lieutenant Han and Detective Jang.
- Got it.

56
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:06,649
<i>Byung-jun Woo left for Taiwan yesterday.</i>

57
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,568
<i>We've asked their government
for cooperation,</i>

58
00:05:08,592 --> 00:05:11,404
<i>so you should go there with Detective Jang
and arrest him.</i>

59
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:15,265
<i>And Chang-jun Lee was
the accomplice behind Mr. Yoon.</i>

60
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:18,310
<i>I'm on my way to meet him now.
I'll send you the address.</i>

61
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:20,979
Hongje-dong.

62
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:26,427
Please track the location
of Chief Secretary Chang-jun Lee.

63
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,048
If people from Hanjo Group come,
do not let any of them into my office.

64
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:32,073
Yes, sir.

65
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,709
I sincerely apologize.

66
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,689
I ran into her right in front
of Mr. Hwang's place.

67
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,858
I didn't expect to see
Mr. Young's daughter...

68
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,319
You moron. Leave the country right away!

69
00:05:51,343 --> 00:05:53,023
Don't come back until I tell you to do so.

70
00:05:53,428 --> 00:05:55,972
- Thank you, sir.
- Take this too!

71
00:05:56,598 --> 00:05:58,433
Get rid of it. Don't leave any traces.

72
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:19,454
Come in.

73
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,439
I found out that Mr. Lee has
a personal safe deposit box at Hanil Bank.

74
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:29,631
What should we do?

75
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:31,766
Tell the CEO of the bank
that I want to meet.

76
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:34,677
And bring Chang-jun here immediately.

77
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:16,737
<i>It shows that Chang-jun Lee is
on the move toward Muakjae now.</i>

78
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:18,781
Then he is going to Hongje-dong.

79
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:19,907
<i>Where are you now?</i>

80
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:22,809
I'm... Hang up first.
I'll send you my location.

81
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:27,206
Send the current location
to Detective Jang.

82
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,566
SEND CURRENT LOCATION TO DETECTIVE JANG.

83
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,629
DETECTIVE JANG, NEW MESSAGE,
TRACKING MY LOCATION

84
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:38,283
ADDRESS: HONGJE-DONG, SEODAEMUN-GU, SEOUL

85
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:42,471
We've figured out that
he's the accomplice.

86
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,456
Why is he letting us track his location?

87
00:07:45,582 --> 00:07:47,292
What is he thinking?

88
00:08:44,682 --> 00:08:45,809
What happened?

89
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,953
<i>We're at the Blue House,
but we can't get in.</i>

90
00:08:47,977 --> 00:08:49,163
<i>We told them your name, but...</i>

91
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:52,398
Track his car. I don't care what you do!
Bring him to me immediately.

92
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:01,449
You got here faster than I thought.

93
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:04,178
You still have a long way to go, though.

94
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,813
You must have a lot of questions.

95
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:17,191
Did you instigate Mr. Yoon

96
00:10:18,109 --> 00:10:19,569
into killing Moo-sung Park?

97
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:20,903
Yes, I did.

98
00:10:21,863 --> 00:10:23,907
Did you cause bodily harm
to Ga-young Kim as well?

99
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
Yes.

100
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:28,744
What about Eun-soo Young?

101
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:34,667
Aren't you here
because you know who did it?

102
00:10:37,128 --> 00:10:38,838
Why did you do it?

103
00:10:40,757 --> 00:10:41,757
You said

104
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,510
that I must've been threatened by Mr. Park

105
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,865
and that I tried to shut that girl up.

106
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,724
I now know that's not what happened.

107
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,061
I should've said no.

108
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,190
Mr. Park begged me
to help him get a contract,

109
00:10:58,608 --> 00:11:00,026
but I should've refused it.

110
00:11:01,152 --> 00:11:04,822
Did you introduce him
to those in Hanjo Distribution

111
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,033
yourself?

112
00:11:09,243 --> 00:11:11,123
He was trying hard to revive
his dying business,

113
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:13,308
and I had no reason to be cold to him.

114
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,291
Hanjo Distribution was

115
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,503
getting the least amount
of attention out of all the subsidiaries.

116
00:11:19,671 --> 00:11:23,800
I didn't think putting him in touch
with them would affect anything.

117
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:28,096
You didn't know that it was soon
to be used for illegal transfer of assets.

118
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:29,931
I had no idea.

119
00:11:31,182 --> 00:11:35,103
It wasn't in the limelight because they
wanted it to stay out of public attention.

120
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,442
I regret it.
That's the only thing I regret.

121
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:46,239
The one misjudgment I made.

122
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,033
Is that why...

123
00:11:52,662 --> 00:11:53,913
Would you have

124
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:56,708
done something you'd regret later?

125
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:28,656
Why did you want to meet here?

126
00:12:34,328 --> 00:12:35,913
It's such a beautiful day, isn't it?

127
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:41,543
I'll be cuffed.

128
00:12:42,837 --> 00:12:44,756
Then with my prisoner number on my chest,

129
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:47,091
I'll be dragged around.

130
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:50,325
I'll be interrogated by prosecutors
below my seniority level.

131
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:52,764
I've seen it many times.

132
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:55,974
Isn't it strange?

133
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,104
All those men who were interrogated
in front of me

134
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:03,274
had lost a lot of hair
at the crown of their heads.

135
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:07,612
Why is this popping up
in my mind right now?

136
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,158
Please come with me.

137
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,207
Should I become the defeated

138
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:22,232
and get dragged around as a captive?

139
00:13:23,878 --> 00:13:25,254
Or shall I choose to vanish

140
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:27,506
on the battleground?

141
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:30,091
Chang-jun.

142
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:33,179
Chang-jun?

143
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:35,848
I like being called that way.

144
00:13:47,485 --> 00:13:48,778
Slow down.

145
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:57,286
Did Si-mok really say
that Mr. Lee is the culprit?

146
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:13,755
Pull yourself together.
Someone is up there.

147
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,531
I'll go check. Please stay with him here.

148
00:15:16,157 --> 00:15:17,283
You can do it, right?

149
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,058
The redevelopment area in Hongje-dong.

150
00:15:25,082 --> 00:15:27,762
It's behind Inwang Elementary School.
Send an ambulance immediately.

151
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,253
Someone fell.

152
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:46,062
Sir, Mr. Chief Secretary.

153
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,481
Sir, sir!

154
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,687
Mr. Hwang?

155
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,732
Sir!

156
00:16:39,282 --> 00:16:43,494
Sir... Mr. Chief Secretary.
Please keep yourself together. Sir!

157
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,623
You still

158
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,751
have a chance.

159
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,130
Dong-jae.

160
00:16:58,301 --> 00:16:59,468
Do not

161
00:17:02,138 --> 00:17:03,889
follow my path.

162
00:17:13,149 --> 00:17:14,233
Sir...

163
00:17:14,942 --> 00:17:17,653
Mr. Chief Secretary...

164
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:30,958
Put both of your hands up.

165
00:17:38,174 --> 00:17:39,550
Turn around slowly.

166
00:17:55,316 --> 00:17:56,650
Did you push him?

167
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,069
Reporters will swarm all over here soon.
Tidy things up before that.

168
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:23,511
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

169
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:28,057
I heard he jumped off
before Mr. Hwang could even stop him.

170
00:18:28,391 --> 00:18:30,191
Before that, he admitted
being the accomplice.

171
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:31,307
Are you sure it's suicide?

172
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:34,355
What if there was a tussle up there?

173
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,957
Lieutenant Han saw him jumping.

174
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,650
She must've seen it from down here.

175
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:39,674
Weren't they the only ones up there?

176
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,130
I'm not saying that Prosecutor Hwang
pushed him intentionally.

177
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,258
He could've done it by mistake
while trying to stop him.

178
00:18:45,282 --> 00:18:46,742
Prosecutor Seo said he saw it too.

179
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,211
It looks like he took his own life.

180
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,236
Who's here now?

181
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,613
The protocol team has started
preparing for the funeral.

182
00:19:06,637 --> 00:19:09,515
The planning team and the PR team
are both on standby.

183
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,810
Shall I call the executives?

184
00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:16,397
Control the media first.

185
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:21,193
Chang-jun has committed many corrupt deeds
since he was a prosecutor.

186
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:26,282
He kept his henchman in the prosecution
in order to bury all of his wrong deeds.

187
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:28,742
And using that guy,

188
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:34,582
he killed Moo-sung Park who bribed
prosecutors at the western office.

189
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:37,835
- Pardon me?
- The guilt made him take his own life.

190
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:39,920
Distribute a press release

191
00:19:40,421 --> 00:19:42,506
before reporters come up
with imaginative stories.

192
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:44,884
Understood, sir.

193
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,560
What a moron.

194
00:19:58,147 --> 00:20:00,983
They say that a live dog
is better than a dead lion.

195
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:07,364
I guess that's just his fate.

196
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:10,993
What can I do?

197
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:49,198
As a prosecutor, I want to do it. But...

198
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,579
Si-mok.

199
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,502
I don't want to lose this position.

200
00:21:12,763 --> 00:21:14,723
Is it true? Our chief prosecutor...

201
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:17,685
I mean, the news
about Chief Secretary Chang-jun Lee.

202
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:19,185
He passed away.

203
00:21:21,063 --> 00:21:22,189
Then the other things too?

204
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:25,901
How he was the mastermind behind Mr. Yoon
and that he took his own life?

205
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:27,611
Yes.

206
00:21:28,612 --> 00:21:29,905
It's all true.

207
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:45,837
Are we going to start?

208
00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:53,136
We should.

209
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:55,513
Let's do it.

210
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:03,248
Now, I'll distribute documents that list
all illegal deeds Hanjo has committed.

211
00:22:03,272 --> 00:22:05,816
They're organized by date,

212
00:22:06,108 --> 00:22:08,295
<i>and they go back to about two years ago.</i>

213
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,255
<i>The enclosed memory sticks contain</i>

214
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:13,866
<i>voice files, which are recordings
of secret meetings held for the schemes.</i>

215
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,081
Where did you get this?

216
00:22:21,665 --> 00:22:23,893
Mine isn't about Hanjo Group.

217
00:22:23,917 --> 00:22:25,919
They pressured our offices
to hire specific people.

218
00:22:26,503 --> 00:22:29,340
There are things related
to the Public Prosecutor General as well.

219
00:22:32,635 --> 00:22:35,238
Who else has been informed about this?

220
00:22:35,262 --> 00:22:37,324
Those of you here
are the only ones who know.

221
00:22:37,348 --> 00:22:39,141
They've never been disclosed before.

222
00:22:39,683 --> 00:22:42,287
Intellectual property infringement,
illegal sales of real estate,

223
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:43,830
unlawful transfer of assets, tax evasion

224
00:22:43,854 --> 00:22:45,332
and violating Foreign Exchange Act.

225
00:22:45,356 --> 00:22:49,610
You'll see what each team from Division
One to Five will be in charge of.

226
00:22:50,027 --> 00:22:53,590
Some public officials helped Hanjo
evade law enforcement.

227
00:22:53,614 --> 00:22:55,240
There are politicians too.

228
00:22:56,658 --> 00:22:57,868
We're so dead, aren't we?

229
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,045
Why should we die?

230
00:23:09,213 --> 00:23:10,573
These guys are in trouble, not us.

231
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:14,301
All right. It's all or nothing.

232
00:23:14,676 --> 00:23:17,405
If we want to crush them,
we must strike them with full force.

233
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,890
If we approach them rashly,
we'll be crushed.

234
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:26,021
Please help us out.

235
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,135
Your accomplice, Chang-jun Lee,

236
00:23:56,677 --> 00:23:58,846
confessed everything
and jumped to his death.

237
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,853
You don't seem that surprised.

238
00:24:06,061 --> 00:24:08,147
I guess the two of you
had talked about it.

239
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,154
Did he tell you that Byung-jun Woo
is the one who killed Ms. Young?

240
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,302
Is that why you kept your mouth shut?

241
00:24:18,907 --> 00:24:22,369
Because we'd find out about your source
if you told us Byung-jun Woo killed her?

242
00:24:26,248 --> 00:24:29,251
Did he tell you anything else
about Byung-jun Woo?

243
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,587
Where in Taiwan he may be, for example.

244
00:24:33,046 --> 00:24:36,049
All I know is he went there.
I don't know anything else.

245
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:49,813
While you were working with us,

246
00:24:50,939 --> 00:24:52,858
all of us must've looked
like complete idiots.

247
00:24:56,403 --> 00:25:00,449
While wandering around to catch
the killer, we addressed you so politely.

248
00:25:02,075 --> 00:25:05,204
We must've looked really pathetic,
especially me and Detective Jang.

249
00:25:12,002 --> 00:25:13,504
During the special investigation...

250
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:17,424
It was the first time.

251
00:25:19,635 --> 00:25:21,303
For the very first time in two years,

252
00:25:23,847 --> 00:25:25,682
I felt like I could actually breathe.

253
00:25:33,857 --> 00:25:37,819
Shall I go tell Mr. Park's mother that
the prick who slashed her son to death

254
00:25:38,111 --> 00:25:40,131
said he felt like he could
finally breathe?

255
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:41,515
Or shall I go tell Ga-young's mom?

256
00:25:42,991 --> 00:25:44,201
In this country,

257
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,204
there are so many parents
who lost their children

258
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,456
unfairly.

259
00:25:50,165 --> 00:25:52,125
Do all of them brandish knives?

260
00:25:53,794 --> 00:25:56,046
You basically stabbed them too.

261
00:25:57,172 --> 00:25:59,776
They've done everything in their power
to overcome their losses,

262
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,560
and you made all of their effort
go to waste.

263
00:26:02,177 --> 00:26:03,537
You feel like you can breathe now?

264
00:26:11,687 --> 00:26:15,083
While many of us are still shocked
by the late Chief Secretary Chang-jun Lee

265
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:18,044
committing suicide right before getting
arrested for murder,

266
00:26:18,068 --> 00:26:21,965
the recordings he left got leaked,
which has been causing a big stir.

267
00:26:21,989 --> 00:26:24,342
The secret documents, which were made

268
00:26:24,366 --> 00:26:27,053
to prevent betrayal of those
who were involved in the secret deals,

269
00:26:27,077 --> 00:26:29,889
were taken into custody by the prosecution
after Chief Secretary Lee, who was

270
00:26:29,913 --> 00:26:32,433
on the run from the police
and prosecution, took his own life.

271
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:34,602
<i>Using these documents as evidence,
the prosecution have</i>

272
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:37,706
<i>commenced a search and seizure at Hanjo
and The Bahn Group early this morning.</i>

273
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:40,775
<i>Moreover, a list of high-ranking officials
who were involved in illegal acts</i>

274
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,985
<i>has also been disclosed,</i>

275
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:44,529
<i>which is expected to cause
an immense stir.</i>

276
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:47,848
Detective Seo, join Team Two
and hit the savings bank.

277
00:26:48,515 --> 00:26:50,118
Geon and Yeo-jin, go to the bus company.

278
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:52,787
Sun-chang, you and I will go
to Financial Supervisory Service.

279
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:56,457
The media beat us. Time isn't on our side,
so get moving quickly.

280
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:57,816
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

281
00:27:01,028 --> 00:27:02,988
Hello? The Ministry of Foreign Affairs?

282
00:27:03,614 --> 00:27:05,054
Official documents have been issued?

283
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:07,325
Thank you.

284
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:10,287
Detective Jang,
let's go catch that killer.

285
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:15,042
I told you that I don't know anything.

286
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:22,687
I'm calling from Mr. Chief Prosecutor's
office. Please play it now.

287
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,445
You've never given the Incheon office

288
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:28,180
any orders related
to Sepoong Transportation's trial?

289
00:27:29,097 --> 00:27:30,474
Hey, Won-chul.

290
00:27:30,974 --> 00:27:33,814
Do you want to leave the prosecution
right after your promotion or what?

291
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:38,458
Go bring that man, Mr. Yoon.
Let me talk to him face-to-face.

292
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:41,652
There's something you should hear
before that.

293
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:47,884
<i>Hello, Congressman Bae.
It's been a long time.</i>

294
00:27:47,908 --> 00:27:50,077
<i>- I heard the killer has been caught.
- Yes.</i>

295
00:27:50,744 --> 00:27:54,581
<i>I didn't expect that you'd be
affected by the Huam-dong case.</i>

296
00:27:55,165 --> 00:27:58,085
<i>What are you talking about?
I don't have anything to do with it.</i>

297
00:28:00,671 --> 00:28:04,758
<i>I don't think you're in a situation
where you can worry about saving face.</i>

298
00:28:05,342 --> 00:28:07,302
<i>The killer must've told them
everything by now.</i>

299
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,947
<i>It's only a matter of time
before your name comes up.</i>

300
00:28:09,971 --> 00:28:13,975
<i>So? You must've called me
because you have a plan.</i>

301
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,246
<i>I'm sure there will be something
I can do for you.</i>

302
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,605
<i>Do you have some time now?</i>

303
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:26,863
CHIEF PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

304
00:28:29,032 --> 00:28:31,094
<i>I just got a call
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</i>

305
00:28:31,118 --> 00:28:34,013
<i>We'll be sure to bring that prick,
Byung-jun Woo, back to his home soil,</i>

306
00:28:34,037 --> 00:28:36,498
<i>so just trust us and wait for us.
Best of luck to you too.</i>

307
00:28:40,293 --> 00:28:41,437
<i>Please catch him.</i>

308
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:43,463
LIEUTENANT HAN

309
00:29:00,313 --> 00:29:01,565
I've been

310
00:29:02,691 --> 00:29:06,903
responsible for 30 percent
of this country's GDP.

311
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:08,238
That's right, 30 percent.

312
00:29:09,364 --> 00:29:13,052
For my whole life, I've devoted myself
to sustaining the nation's economy.

313
00:29:13,076 --> 00:29:16,764
And as you're probably aware,
I have given jobs

314
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,508
to millions of young people
in this country.

315
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,001
The anti-corporate attitude

316
00:29:21,585 --> 00:29:23,253
that calls my effort a crime

317
00:29:24,046 --> 00:29:27,257
and uses it as a reason
to criticize all the work I've done

318
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,569
makes businessmen like me lose our ground.

319
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:31,762
Wondering what kind of outcome
this may bring

320
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:33,865
truly terrifies me.

321
00:29:33,889 --> 00:29:35,432
The thought of my beloved country

322
00:29:36,016 --> 00:29:37,726
getting dropped from the list

323
00:29:38,894 --> 00:29:41,938
of highly developed countries
due to such collective unreasonable rage

324
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,000
scares me.

325
00:29:44,024 --> 00:29:47,736
I, Yun-beom Lee, would like
to make this one thing clear.

326
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:52,449
Prosecutors may be able to strap me down
jurisprudentially,

327
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,450
but I can

328
00:29:55,077 --> 00:29:57,517
confidently face the honorable history
of this country and say

329
00:29:58,538 --> 00:29:59,474
that I am innocent.

330
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:02,292
Even toddlers know shame.

331
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:17,641
You haven't become a decent human being
even after killing a person.

332
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,146
Well, I can understand
why the former minister

333
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:26,108
is not in his right state of mind
at the moment,

334
00:30:27,317 --> 00:30:29,837
but I have nothing to do
with the death of his daughter...

335
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:30,861
Your son-in-law!

336
00:30:33,073 --> 00:30:34,574
I'm talking about Chang-jun.

337
00:30:37,494 --> 00:30:38,620
You killed him.

338
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:52,568
Did you ask the late Mr. Lee
to record those conversations secretly?

339
00:30:52,592 --> 00:30:55,404
The suspect of Ms. Young's murder is
your employee. What's your thought on it?

340
00:30:55,428 --> 00:30:58,390
- Please say a few words.
- Sir, please tell us.

341
00:30:59,641 --> 00:31:01,494
- Sir!
- Sir, please say a few words.

342
00:31:01,518 --> 00:31:04,771
- Sir, what is the truth?
- Please say a few words!

343
00:31:08,358 --> 00:31:12,863
<i>The intensive investigation on Chairman
Yun-beom Lee of Hanjo has been extended,</i>

344
00:31:13,446 --> 00:31:17,135
<i>which has resulted in a prospect
that an arrest warrant might be requested.</i>

345
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:19,137
<i>And about Chairman Lee's daughter</i>

346
00:31:19,161 --> 00:31:22,390
<i>and the late chief secretary's wife,
Ms. Yeon-jae Lee,</i>

347
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:25,768
<i>donating her illegally transferred assets
to a scholarship foundation,</i>

348
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:28,312
<i>the prosecution stated that they are
investigating it to find out</i>

349
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:31,566
<i>whether it was done to escape
being convicted of tax evasion.</i>

350
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,966
<i>Next breaking news.</i>

351
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,529
<i>The prime suspect
of Prosecutor Eun-soo Young's murder</i>

352
00:31:36,553 --> 00:31:38,614
<i>who killed her two weeks ago
and fled to Taiwan</i>

353
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:41,033
<i>has been caught by Korean police officers
who were sent to Taiwan</i>

354
00:31:41,057 --> 00:31:42,617
<i>and is being transferred at the moment.</i>

355
00:31:45,145 --> 00:31:47,123
I sat right beside him
and kept asking him,

356
00:31:47,147 --> 00:31:49,000
but he strongly denied
Chairman Lee's involvement.

357
00:31:49,024 --> 00:31:50,984
He kept insisting
that he did everything alone.

358
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,445
Damn it.

359
00:31:53,653 --> 00:31:56,632
It'll become harder for us to prove it
if he keeps denying it.

360
00:31:56,656 --> 00:31:58,843
He's certainly not an easy one.

361
00:31:58,867 --> 00:32:00,368
He hasn't said a word about his boss.

362
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,497
You guys must be exhausted.
You should go home get some rest.

363
00:32:05,415 --> 00:32:09,854
Gosh, I wish I could be home
when I open my eyes.

364
00:32:09,878 --> 00:32:12,255
Oh, boy. I miss my son so much,

365
00:32:12,547 --> 00:32:15,610
but he'll ask me to play with him
when I get home, which will exhaust me.

366
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:18,011
Then tomorrow...
Gosh, kids don't even get tired.

367
00:32:18,845 --> 00:32:19,845
Hey, get up.

368
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:24,017
Hey, both of you.
Go home, wash up and go to bed.

369
00:32:25,518 --> 00:32:27,229
That won't make my fatigue go away.

370
00:32:29,689 --> 00:32:33,568
I'll say this one last time.

371
00:32:34,527 --> 00:32:35,904
Do you think that

372
00:32:36,863 --> 00:32:39,866
a sane person would get his subordinate
to kill someone?

373
00:32:40,367 --> 00:32:43,912
Why are you guys making all this fuss
over what a crazy man said?

374
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:48,875
My apologies. So you're saying

375
00:32:50,377 --> 00:32:52,754
that your son-in-law fabricated everything

376
00:32:53,255 --> 00:32:54,315
and that none of it is true.

377
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,549
Of course, none of it.

378
00:32:57,926 --> 00:33:00,762
My wife likes watching dramas.

379
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,950
This is what characters in those dramas
say when their parents don't approve

380
00:33:03,974 --> 00:33:05,183
of the one they want to marry.

381
00:33:06,434 --> 00:33:08,913
"We don't need your approval.
We wanted your blessing."

382
00:33:08,937 --> 00:33:12,232
Right, then they ask their parents to buy
them a house and pay for their wedding.

383
00:33:13,608 --> 00:33:16,569
They say that they don't need
their parents' approval, but in the end...

384
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,280
"Yes."

385
00:33:18,989 --> 00:33:22,158
That one word is what they really need.
This isn't any different.

386
00:33:22,826 --> 00:33:24,828
You're pretending that

387
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:28,298
you don't need me to admit the charges
because you have firm evidence,

388
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:31,911
but the fact that you're keeping me here
for this long

389
00:33:32,502 --> 00:33:33,920
must mean that

390
00:33:34,671 --> 00:33:39,050
you guys can only do things
if I admit that I've done wrong.

391
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,970
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

392
00:33:43,263 --> 00:33:45,056
No matter how hard I rack my brain,

393
00:33:46,182 --> 00:33:47,942
I can only think
of the good deeds I've done.

394
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:54,566
I think I've done enough to help
the prosecution save face.

395
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:00,739
No one will criticize your investigation
or say that you gave me special treatment.

396
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,374
You've worked hard enough.

397
00:34:32,062 --> 00:34:33,062
Please come with us.

398
00:34:38,026 --> 00:34:39,086
Has it been issued?

399
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,488
- We just got the arrest warrant.
- Good.

400
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:43,740
Don't you dare touch me.

401
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:49,454
Si-mok.

402
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:54,751
If those of us collapse,
this country will collapse as well.

403
00:34:55,752 --> 00:34:56,920
It won't collapse.

404
00:35:06,554 --> 00:35:07,680
Let go!

405
00:35:12,602 --> 00:35:13,602
Good work.

406
00:35:40,713 --> 00:35:41,798
LIEUTENANT HAN

407
00:35:44,634 --> 00:35:45,634
Hello?

408
00:35:48,138 --> 00:35:49,138
Who?

409
00:35:53,726 --> 00:35:54,936
Send her up, please.

410
00:36:46,645 --> 00:36:48,189
Do you think you won this game?

411
00:36:51,233 --> 00:36:54,403
I will destroy you with everything I have.

412
00:36:55,196 --> 00:36:57,156
You'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

413
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,180
You'll beat your chest,
wishing you hadn't bothered us at all.

414
00:37:02,536 --> 00:37:03,662
Who is "us"?

415
00:37:05,372 --> 00:37:07,625
You and Chairman Lee?

416
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:11,170
Or you and your husband?

417
00:37:22,181 --> 00:37:23,349
You killed him.

418
00:38:02,304 --> 00:38:05,474
It was in the bag he gave me.

419
00:38:07,476 --> 00:38:08,519
Chang-jun

420
00:38:09,895 --> 00:38:11,355
gave it to you?

421
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:23,784
<i>The Republic of Korea is collapsing.</i>

422
00:38:24,493 --> 00:38:28,080
<i>Even the senses of security and belief
that most ordinary people would be safe</i>

423
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:31,125
<i>have collapsed,
and that's where we're at now.</i>

424
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:33,460
<i>Our society will break down soon.</i>

425
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:35,879
<i>For 19 long years...</i>

426
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:40,384
<i>For the last 19 years as a prosecutor,
I watched that hole of destruction growing</i>

427
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,405
<i>at a frightening speed
right before my eyes.</i>

428
00:38:43,429 --> 00:38:44,447
Mr. Prosecutor. Please.

429
00:38:44,471 --> 00:38:47,308
I'm so sorry.
Please let it slide just this once.

430
00:38:47,474 --> 00:38:49,452
Mr. Prosecutor!

431
00:38:49,476 --> 00:38:52,396
- I'm so sorry. Please help me, sir.
- <i>Once, an elderly woman who had been</i>

432
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:54,273
<i>living on sugar water was dragged to me.</i>

433
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,694
<i>One day, I had to arrest someone
for theft when all he had was nothing</i>

434
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,160
<i>but 3,000 won,
which he made from selling junk.</i>

435
00:39:02,197 --> 00:39:04,074
<i>I arrested people like them during the day</i>

436
00:39:04,658 --> 00:39:06,327
<i>and went to a secret lounge at night.</i>

437
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:11,999
<i>There, I met people who make hundreds
of billions of won with just a few words,</i>

438
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:16,229
<i>and I observed them so that they could
escape the net of justice.</i>

CHIEF PROSECUTOR SANG-WOOK BAE

440
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:20,066
Yes, I completely understand how you feel,

441
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,301
but I have no choice.

442
00:39:22,885 --> 00:39:26,055
It's an order from higher-ups.
Just let him go.

443
00:39:28,557 --> 00:39:30,017
<i>When I wasn't observing them,</i>

444
00:39:31,226 --> 00:39:35,147
<i>I faithfully jotted down and executed
each administration's guideline.</i>

445
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:42,363
<i>Had our society been moderately corrupt,
I would've ignored it.</i>

446

had been the degree of its rottenness.</i>

447

<i>But at some point, my body started telling
me that it couldn't take it anymore.</i>

00:41:36,018 --> 00:41:37,495
Even if something unexpected happens...

469
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:40,230
<i>Blood is what can reinstate
the destroyed system.</i>

470
00:41:42,107 --> 00:41:43,609
<i>Blood of many people.</i>

471
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,863
<i>I want to say that history proves it all,</i>

472
00:41:48,363 --> 00:41:50,282
<i>but blood sacrifices are still ongoing.</i>

473
00:41:56,205 --> 00:41:57,247
<i>We must change it.</i>

474
00:41:58,248 --> 00:42:02,252
<i>I must find whatever it is that I can do
and turn the tables.</i>

475
00:42:05,214 --> 00:42:12,012
CHIEF SECRETARY OF BLUE HOUSE
CHANG-JUN LEE

476
00:42:13,138 --> 00:42:16,058
<i>We've already missed the time
it could've been healed by normal means.</i>

477
00:42:19,311 --> 00:42:21,146
<i>I must not forbear any longer.</i>

478
00:42:22,231 --> 00:42:25,651
<i>I should not wait for someone else
to clean up the filth in my place.</i>

479
00:42:26,693 --> 00:42:28,028
<i>If I wait and stay silent,</i>

480
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:31,740
<i>this entire country will be
covered in filth in no time.</i>

481
00:42:33,492 --> 00:42:35,077
<i>Now, I ought to open my mouth,</i>

482
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:37,412
<i>point at those who have done wrong</i>

483
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,220
<i>and reveal the secret behind the curtains
that had been kept closed.</i>

484
00:42:44,169 --> 00:42:47,130
<i>I hope that this is the beginning.</i>

485
00:43:35,304 --> 00:43:38,241
Defendant, you stated
that you admit all of the charges

486
00:43:38,265 --> 00:43:41,393
and that you do not wish to say anything
to defend yourself. Is it true?

487
00:43:42,227 --> 00:43:43,227
Yes, Your Honor.

488
00:43:43,645 --> 00:43:45,147
What is the reason?

489
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:48,275
I would like to apologize.

490
00:43:48,984 --> 00:43:50,193
To whom?

491
00:43:52,654 --> 00:43:55,824
"Under the name of justice,
we pursue truth"

492
00:43:56,491 --> 00:43:58,928
and never compromise
with injustice or any illegal pursuits

493
00:43:58,952 --> 00:44:00,454
"as righteous police officers."

494
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,874
I'd like to apologize
to everyone in the police force

495
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:08,211
who'd be working very hard even
at this moment with the Police Charter

496
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:10,172
engraved in their hearts.

497
00:44:12,215 --> 00:44:13,592
I sincerely apologize.

498
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:18,639
I plead guilty to all of the charges

499
00:44:19,097 --> 00:44:20,307
and deeply regret what I did.

500
00:44:21,266 --> 00:44:22,643
I earnestly hope that those of you

501
00:44:23,435 --> 00:44:26,480
in the force don't forget why you joined
the police and turn out like me.

502
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,318
I will now announce the verdict.

503
00:44:31,818 --> 00:44:33,796
Even though the defendant, Woo-gyun Kim,

504
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,198
was a public official whose duty
was to be a model citizen,

505
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:39,993
he accepted bribes and bought
sex services from a minor.

506
00:44:40,535 --> 00:44:42,204
His offences deserve a heavy punishment,

507
00:44:42,788 --> 00:44:45,725
but he is repenting
and deeply regretting what he did.

508
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:49,336
Ergo, the court sentences him
to 42 months in prison.

509
00:45:00,847 --> 00:45:01,890
Chief.

510
00:45:07,187 --> 00:45:08,187
Chief.

511
00:45:09,272 --> 00:45:10,273
Thanks, Sergeant Kim.

512
00:45:12,484 --> 00:45:13,484
Su-chan.

513
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:29,876
Shouldn't that idiot know better by now?

514
00:45:30,752 --> 00:45:32,963
Why is he not letting go
of the rotten rope?

515
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:52,983
I'll ask you once again.

516
00:45:54,192 --> 00:45:57,779
Who are the other men you met
besides Chief Woo-gyun Kim?

517
00:46:03,118 --> 00:46:04,286
Are you not going to answer?

518
00:46:05,871 --> 00:46:09,100
Ms. Kim, you're here
as a perpetrator, not a victim.

519
00:46:09,124 --> 00:46:11,168
You're being investigated
for prostitution.

520
00:46:12,085 --> 00:46:14,605
If you keep this up, you may end up
with more than a fine.

521
00:46:14,629 --> 00:46:16,798
I'm not well yet.

522
00:46:17,257 --> 00:46:19,009
I don't remember anything.

523
00:46:33,064 --> 00:46:34,191
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

524
00:46:34,983 --> 00:46:37,587
You should've told them
that I still don't remember anything.

525
00:46:37,611 --> 00:46:38,653
Are you a bonehead?

526
00:46:39,362 --> 00:46:42,592
Stop following me around.
You're embarrassing me. Leave me alone!

527
00:46:42,616 --> 00:46:44,927
Why do you keep taking everything
out on me? Goodness.

528
00:46:44,951 --> 00:46:45,951
Hey.

529
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:48,222
My gosh, Detective.

530
00:46:48,246 --> 00:46:49,998
- Why are you being like this?
- Look.

531
00:46:50,749 --> 00:46:52,667
See what her arms are doing.

532
00:46:52,793 --> 00:46:56,588
Look at what she's doing
even after hearing such rude remarks!

533
00:47:00,592 --> 00:47:03,353
Do you know what your mom went
through while you were at the hospital?

534
00:47:03,804 --> 00:47:06,264
Do you know how much effort the culprit
made to let you live?

535
00:47:06,848 --> 00:47:09,035
- Sorry?
- Had it been someone else,

536
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:11,186
you would've died in someone's bathroom.

537
00:47:11,686 --> 00:47:15,065
That's how you got your life back.
Do you want to waste it like this?

538
00:47:16,775 --> 00:47:19,694
Do you know how many women
in prostitution end up dead?

539
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,880
There are so many of them
they don't cover the story on the news.

540
00:47:24,407 --> 00:47:26,127
It was God's will
that your life was spared.

541
00:47:26,868 --> 00:47:27,953
Don't you ever forget that.

542
00:47:30,831 --> 00:47:32,666
You should really listen to her.

543
00:47:32,791 --> 00:47:35,502
Why can't you pull yourself together?
And what are you wearing?

544
00:47:37,796 --> 00:47:39,422
For goodness' sake.

545
00:47:41,424 --> 00:47:42,759
That almost made me jump.

546
00:47:43,468 --> 00:47:44,761
Shall I smash your desk for you?

547
00:47:45,512 --> 00:47:48,265
You're back, sir. What happened to Chief?

548
00:47:48,682 --> 00:47:52,060
What do you think? He's been
sentenced to 42 months in prison.

549
00:47:52,978 --> 00:47:53,979
What's the matter though?

550
00:47:54,479 --> 00:47:56,356
Gosh, don't even get me started.

551
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:59,090
He didn't have an attorney,
and he refused to defend himself.

552
00:47:59,734 --> 00:48:03,363
Watching him admitting everything
and apologizing... Gosh.

553
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:05,907
At least Chief is repenting what he did.

554
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,329
"At least"? What do you mean by that?

555
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:14,308
I wonder what Sergeant Kim is up to.

556
00:48:14,332 --> 00:48:17,836
What are you trying to say?
Don't be so cryptic.

557
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,731
Ask yourself what it may mean.

558
00:48:20,755 --> 00:48:22,048
I'm done for the day.

559
00:48:24,384 --> 00:48:25,384
Gosh.

560
00:48:27,012 --> 00:48:28,013
That little...

561
00:48:29,014 --> 00:48:30,575
<i>I got a job.</i>

562
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:33,519
<i>- My comrades, please congratulate me.</i>
- Why is she being like that to me?

563
00:48:33,852 --> 00:48:35,312
I'll get going too.

564
00:48:35,937 --> 00:48:37,856
You should ask yourself for the answer.

565
00:48:38,732 --> 00:48:39,733
Lieutenant Han, wait up.

566
00:48:43,695 --> 00:48:45,447
Good grief.

567
00:48:46,907 --> 00:48:48,033
Oh, boy.

568
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:07,594
SERGEANT KIM

569
00:49:11,556 --> 00:49:12,641
Hey, Sergeant Kim.

570
00:49:14,225 --> 00:49:15,310
How have you been?

571
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:17,979
Well, I was just wondering.

572
00:49:19,689 --> 00:49:23,234
Hey, let's meet up and have some soju.

573
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:27,530
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

574
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,932
It's not even a small law firm.
It's a big company.

575
00:49:35,956 --> 00:49:37,332
They recruited me.

576
00:49:37,666 --> 00:49:40,645
My experience in the special investigation
team was certainly very helpful.

577
00:49:40,669 --> 00:49:41,711
Congratulations.

578
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:43,880
Your trip to Taiwan must've been intense.

579
00:49:44,464 --> 00:49:47,276
You'll have to stay up for four nights
to hear about everything that happened.

580
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,404
You got promoted because of it though.
It's great.

581
00:49:50,428 --> 00:49:52,198
You too, Detective Jang.

582
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:53,574
We really should celebrate.

583
00:49:53,598 --> 00:49:55,409
Gosh, stop. I shouldn't drink anymore.

584
00:49:55,433 --> 00:49:56,913
Are you still taking herbal medicine?

585
00:49:57,477 --> 00:49:59,372
Does it even work?

586
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:01,165
You look even more fatigued than before.

587
00:50:01,189 --> 00:50:02,875
I should start taking care of myself.

588
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:04,943
I'll have to wear the uniform
for the ceremony.

589
00:50:05,735 --> 00:50:07,070
I should go get some coffee.

590
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:09,298
Ceremony, my foot.

591
00:50:09,322 --> 00:50:11,384
- Does anyone want coffee?
- I'd love a latte.

592
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:12,951
- Me too.
- Same here.

593
00:50:15,453 --> 00:50:18,099
What's going on with Mr. Hwang by the way?

594
00:50:18,123 --> 00:50:19,934
- I couldn't get a hold of him.
- Oh, you're right.

595
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:22,252
He left work right on time today,
which never happens.

596
00:50:22,836 --> 00:50:25,856
That jerk. He just sent me
a one-word text to congratulate me

597
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,967
- and didn't even answer my call.
- Stop calling him like that, will you?

598
00:50:29,843 --> 00:50:32,679
- We're friends.
- And stop saying that as an excuse.

599
00:50:33,471 --> 00:50:35,140
- Oh, coffee.
- He's just in a good mood.

600
00:50:37,308 --> 00:50:40,186
This coffee is delicious.
Oh, I have to watch the baseball game.

601
00:50:42,564 --> 00:50:43,565
Here.

602
00:50:43,815 --> 00:50:45,001
<i>For the last few months...</i>

603
00:50:45,025 --> 00:50:48,045
- Wait, wasn't that Mr. Hwang?
- What?

604
00:50:48,069 --> 00:50:49,189
Switch the channel. Go back.

605
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:54,826
<i>Today, we'll be speaking with Prosecutor
Si-mok Hwang from the western office</i>

606
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:58,121
<i>who's been on the frontline
of the investigation committed</i>

607
00:50:58,371 --> 00:51:02,375
<i>to eradicating corruption,
which started with the Huam-dong murder.</i>

608
00:51:02,834 --> 00:51:05,336
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

609
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:08,298
<i>- This is my second time meeting you.
- That's correct.</i>

610
00:51:09,424 --> 00:51:12,361
<i>How are the trials of the politicians
and financial authorities going?</i>

611
00:51:12,385 --> 00:51:13,320
<i>From what I know,</i>

612
00:51:13,344 --> 00:51:15,263
a number of trials have been held so far.

613
00:51:16,056 --> 00:51:17,515
I mainly oversee investigations,

614
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,440
so I'm not directly taking part
in the trials.

615
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,854
You haven't changed at all
from what I remember.

616
00:51:23,772 --> 00:51:26,959
There's something else I remember.
The last time you were here,

617
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:29,295
you said that you'd catch
the culprit within two months.

618
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:31,905
- Yes, I did.
- From the killer, Se-won Yoon,

619
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:35,176
to the mastermind behind him,
the late Chang-jun Lee,

620
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,887
you brought the truth to light
a few days before the promised deadline.

621
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:40,181
- That's right.
- You kept your promise.

622
00:51:40,205 --> 00:51:42,349
That day, I asked you

623
00:51:42,373 --> 00:51:45,561
to come back on the show
if you ever catch the culprit.

624
00:51:45,585 --> 00:51:48,505
- You kept that promise too. Thank you.
- No problem.

625
00:51:49,547 --> 00:51:51,633
I'm actually here because there is

626
00:51:52,467 --> 00:51:55,071
something I'd like to say.

627
00:51:55,095 --> 00:51:56,346
Sure, please go ahead.

628
00:51:57,597 --> 00:51:59,474
The late Mr. Chang-jun Lee

629
00:52:00,475 --> 00:52:05,105
didn't record the conversations
to threaten those who were involved

630
00:52:05,688 --> 00:52:08,959
in the corrupt deeds with him
in case they might end up betraying him.

631
00:52:08,983 --> 00:52:11,962
Isn't that what was released
by Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office?

632
00:52:11,986 --> 00:52:13,297
Yes, that is correct.

633
00:52:13,321 --> 00:52:16,199
And you're refuting it now?

634
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:18,368
This is an old case, but I'm wondering

635
00:52:18,701 --> 00:52:21,454
if you remember what happened
at the genetic research lab in Pohang.

636
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:23,849
One of the employees

637
00:52:23,873 --> 00:52:27,127
disclosed a confidential internal document
after he left the lab.

638
00:52:28,086 --> 00:52:30,272
Even though the document
was very detailed,

639
00:52:30,296 --> 00:52:32,632
none of the executives
whose names were on the document

640
00:52:32,924 --> 00:52:34,819
was punished in any way.

641
00:52:34,843 --> 00:52:37,279
From what I remember, people only
criticized the employee,

642
00:52:37,303 --> 00:52:38,614
calling him a traitor and swindler.

643
00:52:38,638 --> 00:52:40,348
It was because those at the lab

644
00:52:40,598 --> 00:52:42,809
insisted that he embezzled research funds

645
00:52:43,143 --> 00:52:46,354
and that he was lying
in order to conceal it.

646
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:48,163
They kept brainwashing people like that.

647
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:51,025
Are you bringing this up

648
00:52:51,526 --> 00:52:53,903
because you think that Mr. Lee's case
is like his?

649
00:52:54,445 --> 00:52:55,989
This was his final wish.

650
00:52:57,448 --> 00:53:01,703
<i>"I must be remembered as corporate riches'
spy who was loyal to them until the end."</i>

651
00:53:02,787 --> 00:53:04,664
<i>He said that it will give</i>

652
00:53:05,165 --> 00:53:07,184
<i>more power to what he was leaving behind.</i>

653
00:53:07,208 --> 00:53:08,710
<i>Then, are you saying</i>

654
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:12,839
<i>that he voluntarily disgraced himself
in order to prove</i>

655
00:53:13,173 --> 00:53:15,466
<i>the corrupt deeds that he had
witnessed and heard about?</i>

656
00:53:15,758 --> 00:53:16,819
<i>That's correct.</i>

657
00:53:16,843 --> 00:53:19,470
<i>When faced with death, all of us hope</i>

658
00:53:20,054 --> 00:53:23,242
that our true intentions would be
understood after we die,

659
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:24,767
<i>yet he even gave up on that.</i>

660
00:53:25,852 --> 00:53:26,853
<i>Yes.</i>

661
00:53:27,395 --> 00:53:28,873
I knew it.

662
00:53:28,897 --> 00:53:30,940
Mr. Lee was such a righteous person.

663
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:32,984
I had no idea.

664
00:53:33,318 --> 00:53:35,421
Those of us at the police
spoke ill of him like crazy too.

665
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:36,905
<i>What you said is making me think</i>

666
00:53:37,488 --> 00:53:40,426
<i>that he could either be viewed
as a criminal or as a righteous man</i>

667
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,803
<i>who sacrificed himself depending
on which aspects are emphasized.</i>

668
00:53:42,827 --> 00:53:45,413
<i>Such dichotomous opinions
may be brought up.</i>

669
00:53:45,788 --> 00:53:47,874
<i>What's your take on it?</i>

670
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:51,419
<i>He was a monster.</i>

671
00:53:55,423 --> 00:53:57,151
He killed a person.

672
00:53:57,175 --> 00:54:00,094
He probably thought of it
as a small sacrifice for a big cause,

673
00:54:00,386 --> 00:54:02,907
but I personally have never thought

674
00:54:02,931 --> 00:54:05,891
that certain people's lives could be
considered less valuable than others'.

675
00:54:06,517 --> 00:54:10,313
He deluded himself into thinking
that he had the right to punish sinners.

676
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,750
He was a monster created by our time.

677
00:54:12,774 --> 00:54:16,921
A police officer once said to me
that people do things because

678
00:54:16,945 --> 00:54:18,339
<i>they can get away with them.</i>

679
00:54:18,363 --> 00:54:20,966
Because they can get away with it
and people will turn a blind eye.

680
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:25,620
She said people do corrupt things
because we turn a blind eye to them

681
00:54:26,412 --> 00:54:29,212
<i>and that we can change it if just
one person keeps his or her eyes open</i>

682
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:30,625
<i>and barks at them.</i>

683
00:54:31,209 --> 00:54:34,879
<i>That is actually the prosecution's job.</i>

684
00:54:35,546 --> 00:54:37,840
<i>How do you think
the prosecution have done?</i>

685
00:54:38,258 --> 00:54:39,300
<i>We failed.</i>

686
00:54:40,969 --> 00:54:44,889
<i>As an organization whose duty
is to correct injustice,</i>

687
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:46,261
<i>the prosecution has failed.</i>

688
00:54:47,225 --> 00:54:50,019
We, at the prosecution, applied
the presumption of innocence in a way

689
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,106
that was catered to those
with wealth and power. Moreover,

690
00:54:53,815 --> 00:54:56,943
we protected a criminal,
instead of our citizens.

691
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:01,006
<i>We failed in carrying out
our most essential duty.</i>

692
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:04,701
<i>The late Mr. Chang-jun Lee was the outcome
of accumulation of such failure,</i>

693
00:55:05,285 --> 00:55:08,514
<i>and everyone in the prosecution
was his accomplice.</i>

694
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:13,018
I cannot speak on behalf
of all of my colleagues, of course.

695
00:55:13,042 --> 00:55:17,356
<i>However, I thought I should apologize
to all citizens through this opportunity.</i>

696
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,550
<i>Those of us in the prosecution</i>

697
00:55:21,092 --> 00:55:22,593
<i>disappointed you.</i>

698
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:28,725
<i>Nevertheless, I think
that we still have a chance.</i>

699
00:55:31,686 --> 00:55:35,106
<i>"The most powerful weapon
law enforcers can have</i>

700
00:55:35,815 --> 00:55:39,152
<i>is the constitutional law."
Someone once told me that.</i>

701
00:55:39,652 --> 00:55:43,364
<i>We can continue to fight
as long as the constitution exists.</i>

702
00:55:49,454 --> 00:55:53,499
The prosecution will no longer
be swayed by those with power.

703
00:55:54,042 --> 00:55:55,335
We'll rise again to fight.

704
00:55:55,918 --> 00:55:58,063
We'll exercise our rights on indictment
accurately.

705
00:55:58,087 --> 00:56:00,232
We'll remember that the people are
essentially

706
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:02,026
the ones who hold the power to appoint us.

707
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:03,509
We'll devote ourselves to you.

708
00:56:04,093 --> 00:56:05,345
We'll take responsibility.

709
00:56:05,845 --> 00:56:10,183
We'll strive to become fairer
and more honest.

710
00:56:10,933 --> 00:56:14,604
We'll make sure that none of us
will become another monster like him

711
00:56:15,563 --> 00:56:16,939
by doing our very best.

712
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:23,839
I've been feeling very bad
because my show has been filled

713
00:56:23,863 --> 00:56:25,823
with nothing but disturbing news lately.

714
00:56:26,908 --> 00:56:28,177
I think that

715
00:56:28,201 --> 00:56:32,538
you should be able to relax a little bit
this evening after watching this.

716
00:56:33,414 --> 00:56:35,041
Thank you for watching <i>News 60</i>.

717
00:56:36,042 --> 00:56:37,042
Thank you.

718
00:56:55,395 --> 00:56:57,230
I can understand Mr. Yoon though.

719
00:56:58,356 --> 00:57:01,776
What are you talking about?
Anyone who kills a person is a murderer.

720
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:06,364
But his son... He lost his child
who wasn't even 10 years old.

721
00:57:06,864 --> 00:57:09,992
And those pricks were living great lives
as if nothing had happened.

722
00:57:10,118 --> 00:57:11,637
Even so, he can't punish them like that.

723
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:13,430
Why does the law even exist, then?

724
00:57:13,454 --> 00:57:15,474
Even though prosecution
and police are both rotten,

725
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:19,103
there are still people like
Prosecutor Hwang, Lieutenant Han and me.

726
00:57:19,127 --> 00:57:22,630
Yes, you're absolutely right.
It's all over now anyway.

727
00:57:23,131 --> 00:57:24,757
Don't fight, guys.

728
00:57:27,802 --> 00:57:30,072
By the way, Mr. Hwang

729
00:57:30,096 --> 00:57:33,409
made another appearance on network
television, looking all handsome.

730
00:57:33,433 --> 00:57:37,061
He's definitely going to be promoted
to the division head role this time.

731
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,760
I heard he'll go to the States.

732
00:57:42,024 --> 00:57:43,234
Is Si-mok going to the States?

733
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,489
He was supposed to leave a while ago,

734
00:57:49,031 --> 00:57:50,968
but he couldn't because of what happened.

735
00:57:50,992 --> 00:57:54,513
We've arrested most of the people
who should stand trial,

736
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:55,913
so I guess he'll leave soon.

737
00:57:56,998 --> 00:58:00,668
I heard the chairman of The Bahn Group
is already preparing for an appeal.

738
00:58:01,002 --> 00:58:03,796
Of course. People like them
won't get locked up easily.

739
00:58:05,465 --> 00:58:07,008
He's going to the States.

740
00:58:09,302 --> 00:58:11,763
I wonder how Mr. Yoon is doing.

741
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:15,349
Why do you care? I'm sure
he's paying for what he did.

742
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:17,101
Gosh.

743
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:18,830
You said you don't want to drink more.

744
00:58:24,317 --> 00:58:25,359
Gosh, seriously.

745
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:30,406
I watched the show.

746
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:37,955
What brings you here?

747
00:58:42,376 --> 00:58:43,377
Si-mok.

748
00:58:44,796 --> 00:58:46,276
Trust me and just give me one chance.

749
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,468
Mr. Lee's last wishes

750
00:58:52,094 --> 00:58:53,930
and what he said to me
in his final moments.

751
00:58:55,807 --> 00:58:57,826
I really want to keep the promise.

752
00:58:57,850 --> 00:58:58,976
You

753
00:59:01,479 --> 00:59:02,522
still

754
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:05,775
have a chance.

755
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:10,780
I'll never do anything stupid again.

756
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:13,491
I swear on my name.

757
00:59:20,748 --> 00:59:21,833
I beg you.

758
00:59:23,584 --> 00:59:25,461
Give me one last chance.

759
00:59:40,351 --> 00:59:42,770
- He's coming!
- Oh, there he is!

760
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:45,749
Please say a few words.

761
00:59:45,773 --> 00:59:48,502
- How do you feel, sir?
- How do you feel to stand trial?

762
00:59:48,526 --> 00:59:50,796
- Is there anything you'd like to say?
- How do you feel now?

763
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:51,821
Gosh, don't push me.

764
00:59:52,154 --> 00:59:54,323
- How do you feel?
- Please say a few words.

765
00:59:58,661 --> 00:59:59,745
I'm

766
01:00:00,872 --> 01:00:04,292
not well. I'm ill.

767
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,104
- What's your condition?
- How do you feel?

768
01:00:07,128 --> 01:00:09,898
- Do you have to be hospitalized?
- Is that all you'd like to say?

769
01:00:09,922 --> 01:00:11,400
Is that all you want to say?

770
01:00:11,424 --> 01:00:14,027
- Please say something else.
- Please say a few words.

771
01:00:14,051 --> 01:00:16,238
- Will you go to a hospital?
- Please tell us.

772
01:00:16,262 --> 01:00:17,680
I told you to stop!

773
01:00:18,055 --> 01:00:19,932
Is there anything else you'd like to say?

774
01:00:21,475 --> 01:00:22,476
I'm

775
01:00:24,812 --> 01:00:25,914
really ill.

776
01:00:25,938 --> 01:00:27,440
What exactly is your condition?

777
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,233
What are you waiting for?

778
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:32,504
- What is your condition, sir?
- Please say a few words.

779
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:34,280
- Step aside!
- Are you going to a hospital?

780
01:00:48,836 --> 01:00:52,882
Mr. Yoon, the firm I work at
will handle your trial.

781
01:00:59,597 --> 01:01:00,598
He said

782
01:01:02,516 --> 01:01:03,893
he has to meet you.

783
01:01:18,824 --> 01:01:20,326
Did killing my dad

784
01:01:22,662 --> 01:01:23,829
make you feel better?

785
01:01:28,125 --> 01:01:30,085
I heard that you lost your son
due to an accident.

786
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:34,966
I lost my dad in your hands.

787
01:01:45,226 --> 01:01:46,519
Are you satisfied?

788
01:01:51,857 --> 01:01:53,734
Did you really achieve
everything you wanted?

789
01:02:27,309 --> 01:02:28,394
I'm sorry.

790
01:02:35,443 --> 01:02:36,694
I'm sorry.

791
01:02:42,783 --> 01:02:43,868
I'm really sorry.

792
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:10,311
I'm fine.

793
01:03:11,812 --> 01:03:14,190
Well, thank you so much
for everything you've done for me.

794
01:03:15,316 --> 01:03:18,170
- I'll work hard and take care of Grandma.
- Good.

795
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:21,280
- Oh, right. I got a job at a golf course.
- Really?

796
01:03:21,781 --> 01:03:24,366
It looks like good things are happening
to both of us.

797
01:03:25,159 --> 01:03:26,159
Congratulations.

798
01:03:26,535 --> 01:03:27,620
Thank you.

799
01:03:32,792 --> 01:03:36,045
I'm glad that things are going well
for all of us.

800
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:41,842
Byung-jun Woo keeps insisting
that he did everything alone,

801
01:03:42,176 --> 01:03:45,137
so we'll need more time to prove
that Chairman Lee instigated the murder.

802
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:50,184
Yun-beom Lee denied instigating
the killing even in the recordings.

803
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:53,622
Let's deal with the scandal
involving Hanjo's corrupt deeds first.

804
01:03:53,646 --> 01:03:54,814
Got it.

805
01:03:56,315 --> 01:03:58,526
Anyway, I can see
that the end is drawing near.

806
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:02,229
We've investigated most things
in the documents, right?

807
01:04:02,488 --> 01:04:03,488
Yes, sir.

808
01:04:10,996 --> 01:04:13,916
The plan of sending you to the States
has been canceled.

809
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:18,045
Will I be transferred elsewhere?

810
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:20,839
Yes, Namhae.

811
01:04:25,427 --> 01:04:27,179
I see. Okay.

812
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:31,517
Mr. Lee was the one who brought us here.

813
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:35,039
The Public Prosecutor General told me.

814
01:04:35,437 --> 01:04:38,708
Those at the Cheongju office wanted to
re-evaluate you as you irked them,

815
01:04:38,732 --> 01:04:40,734
and I had been pushed out
of Criminal Division.

816
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:43,487
Chang-jun Lee was the one who brought
both of us here.

817
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:47,283
I think he wanted you to take care
of things after he died from the get-go.

818
01:04:48,325 --> 01:04:52,955
"Who would take on this burden?"
I thought about it for a very long time.

819
01:04:53,706 --> 01:04:57,018
I thought he gave me this position
of chief prosecutor to appease me,

820
01:04:57,042 --> 01:04:59,482
but he was actually looking for someone
who would support you.

821
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:03,257
But... They should be awarding you
for all of your work if anything.

822
01:05:04,675 --> 01:05:05,926
Damn it.

823
01:05:08,053 --> 01:05:09,053
I'm sorry.

824
01:05:09,722 --> 01:05:10,764
It's okay.

825
01:05:11,724 --> 01:05:12,975
You have given me support.

826
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:16,103
Thank you for everything.

827
01:05:26,197 --> 01:05:29,533
<i>I think he wanted you to take care
of things after he died from the get-go.</i>

828
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:32,411
Would you have

829
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:34,955
done something you'd regret later?

830
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:38,709
You can do it.

831
01:05:39,793 --> 01:05:42,588
I know that you won't get swayed.

832
01:05:43,422 --> 01:05:46,926
You'll chase them until the end
in an unflinching manner.

833
01:05:49,678 --> 01:05:52,782
"Who would take on this burden?"

834
01:05:52,806 --> 01:05:54,475
I thought about it for a very long time.

835
01:05:56,685 --> 01:05:58,145
Prosecutor Si-mok Hwang.

836
01:06:01,106 --> 01:06:02,816
You were the only answer.

837
01:06:08,822 --> 01:06:10,133
- Si-mok.
- It's Si-mok Hwang.

838
01:06:10,157 --> 01:06:11,575
For a better future.

839
01:06:12,534 --> 01:06:14,161
You can't make me stand here.

840
01:06:14,995 --> 01:06:17,039
Absolutely not. I will never

841
01:06:18,707 --> 01:06:21,043
stand before you as a defendant.

842
01:06:24,255 --> 01:06:25,255
Chang-jun?

843
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:28,008
I like being called that way.

844
01:06:39,645 --> 01:06:41,063
Slow down.

845
01:07:03,669 --> 01:07:04,669
What's the matter?

846
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:06,564
What is it?

847
01:07:06,588 --> 01:07:09,216
- Did you get a boyfriend or what?
- Sorry?

848
01:07:09,341 --> 01:07:10,634
Congratulations.

849
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:14,614
Bring him here. We should meet him
to make sure that he's a nice guy.

850
01:07:14,638 --> 01:07:15,931
What are you guys talking about?

851
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:18,267
Ta-da!

852
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:36,327
Who sent it? Who is it?

853
01:07:38,871 --> 01:07:40,289
Congratulations. Jung-bon.

854
01:07:41,999 --> 01:07:44,019
I didn't know Jung-bon would
hit on you like this.

855
01:07:44,043 --> 01:07:46,313
Don't be ridiculous.
He must've sent it as an ex-colleague.

856
01:07:46,337 --> 01:07:47,939
We're just friends, okay?

857
01:07:47,963 --> 01:07:52,009
I'm getting promoted too. Where's mine
then? He's obviously making a move.

858
01:07:53,761 --> 01:07:55,596
You should open the present first.

859
01:08:06,398 --> 01:08:08,525
- Wow.
- Wow.

860
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:11,528
Why is this so red?

861
01:08:11,653 --> 01:08:13,906
- Is this food or lipstick?
- Gosh, stop it.

862
01:08:18,619 --> 01:08:21,246
Why did he buy this for me?
I don't even wear lipstick.

863
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:23,933
Hey, get back to work.

864
01:08:23,957 --> 01:08:26,561
- You'll put it on like this.
- Go. Get your work done.

865
01:08:26,585 --> 01:08:29,380
It's only morning,
yet you guys are already so distracting.

866
01:08:32,049 --> 01:08:34,635
What's wrong with them?
They're being so silly.

867
01:09:02,788 --> 01:09:03,831
God.

868
01:09:04,331 --> 01:09:06,542
It's so pretty. I like it.

869
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:16,009
<i>Mr. Hwang will be transferred
to Namhae County.</i>

870
01:09:16,593 --> 01:09:17,593
What?

871
01:09:21,598 --> 01:09:22,724
Enjoy.

872
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:31,316
Wow.

873
01:09:31,692 --> 01:09:33,861
You know how to enjoy a drink alone now.

874
01:09:34,111 --> 01:09:35,863
Look at you all grown up.

875
01:09:36,155 --> 01:09:37,322
Why are you late?

876
01:09:39,074 --> 01:09:43,620
Keep being inflexible like that,
and you'll be all alone in Namhae.

877
01:09:46,123 --> 01:09:49,042
Anyway, it's so sudden.
What are you going to do with your house?

878
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:52,463
I'm going to lease it out.

879
01:09:55,841 --> 01:09:56,841
Ten million won.

880
01:09:58,135 --> 01:10:00,053
Rent it to me, okay?

881
01:10:04,224 --> 01:10:05,976
I listed it for 350 million won.

882
01:10:09,021 --> 01:10:10,981
You don't come across like that,

883
01:10:11,773 --> 01:10:13,233
but I guess you're greedy for money.

884
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:16,754
Oh, well.

885
01:10:16,778 --> 01:10:19,132
Come to my place if you have nowhere
to sleep when you come back.

886
01:10:19,156 --> 01:10:22,367
I'll let you sleep on my porch.

887
01:10:22,784 --> 01:10:23,784
All right.

888
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:25,954
The cold wind might freeze
your face though.

889
01:10:26,955 --> 01:10:27,955
Okay.

890
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:32,604
Here. Congratulations on your promotion.

891
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:34,421
Gosh, it's not that big of a deal.

892
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:37,942
By the way, the promotion ceremony

893
01:10:37,966 --> 01:10:39,760
will be held tomorrow morning.

894
01:10:40,636 --> 01:10:41,613
So what?

895
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,889
You said you'll leave tomorrow morning.

896
01:10:44,806 --> 01:10:45,806
What about it?

897
01:10:49,019 --> 01:10:50,020
Forget it.

898
01:11:02,491 --> 01:11:05,160
How's work going?
Did you get everything done?

899
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:10,624
Yes. There's Dong-jae, but I'll leave that
up to Mr. Kang's discretion.

900
01:11:11,208 --> 01:11:13,085
Why aren't you arresting him?

901
01:11:13,418 --> 01:11:14,836
He's done enough to be arrested.

902
01:11:15,462 --> 01:11:17,339
She kept begging me to trust her,

903
01:11:18,924 --> 01:11:20,926
but I chose not to trust her
until the end.

904
01:11:21,885 --> 01:11:23,053
I'm talking about Eun-soo.

905
01:11:23,845 --> 01:11:25,305
So you want to trust him?

906
01:11:27,474 --> 01:11:28,517
Him out of all people?

907
01:11:31,603 --> 01:11:32,771
I'll observe him.

908
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:49,870
Ta-da.

909
01:11:51,164 --> 01:11:53,000
Gosh, it's...

910
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,936
What on earth is this?

911
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,962
This looks nothing like me.

912
01:12:00,924 --> 01:12:04,052
You should look at it
and practice smiling.

913
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:05,553
It's a gift.

914
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:07,680
By the way,

915
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,434
why are they sending you to Namhae?

916
01:12:11,101 --> 01:12:14,080
The high-ranking officials
and Chairman Lee have been arrested,

917
01:12:14,104 --> 01:12:15,744
but things won't stay like this for long.

918
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:19,985
I bet they'll be released soon
by special pardons.

919
01:12:20,527 --> 01:12:22,112
I guess it's a preparatory measure.

920
01:12:32,372 --> 01:12:33,372
Goodbye.

921
01:12:34,207 --> 01:12:35,542
I won't be able to see you off.

922
01:12:37,127 --> 01:12:38,730
Good luck in your new position.

923
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:40,339
Sorry I can't attend the ceremony.

924
01:12:53,977 --> 01:12:55,562
Wait, did you just order one?

925
01:12:57,648 --> 01:12:58,648
How could you?

926
01:12:59,399 --> 01:13:01,693
Gosh, you haven't changed one bit.

927
01:13:02,152 --> 01:13:05,405
We had to water it down last time
because it was too salty.

928
01:13:07,282 --> 01:13:08,659
You told me to get ramen instead.

929
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:10,845
It's under a new owner now.

930
01:13:10,869 --> 01:13:13,580
Is that why you ordered it?
So how does it taste?

931
01:13:13,955 --> 01:13:14,955
Is it not salty?

932
01:13:15,207 --> 01:13:16,625
What happened to your lips?

933
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:18,793
Oh, this.

934
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:21,105
Why? Do I look pretty?

935
01:13:21,129 --> 01:13:22,798
- It looks weird.
- What?

936
01:13:24,049 --> 01:13:27,862
Lieutenant Yeo-jin Han
and Sergeant Geon Jang.

937
01:13:27,886 --> 01:13:33,308

01:13:40,399 --> 01:13:43,211
"Lieutenant Yeo-jin Han made
great contributions"

939
01:13:43,235 --> 01:13:46,506
to solving the Huam-dong murder case
as well as to arresting

940
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:48,341
and transferring the culprit
of a serious crime.

941
01:13:48,365 --> 01:13:52,244
"Along with this recognition, she will
also be promoted one rank up."

942
01:14:04,297 --> 01:14:07,300
Sergeant Geon Jang. The same as above.

943
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:15,475
Attention. Salute!

944
01:14:37,748 --> 01:14:38,957
We'll see you soon, right?

945
01:14:40,208 --> 01:14:42,711
It's a small world, you know.

946
01:14:43,086 --> 01:14:44,629
Take good care of yourself.

947
01:14:44,755 --> 01:14:46,923
Please don't skip meals.

948
01:14:48,091 --> 01:14:51,178
- Thank you both for everything.
- We should thank you.

949
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:52,887
Thank you.

950
01:14:53,847 --> 01:14:55,032
- You should go in.
- Okay.

951
01:14:55,056 --> 01:14:56,433
- Bye.
- Bye.

952
01:14:57,684 --> 01:14:58,852
Drive safely.

953
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:01,104
Please drive carefully.

954
01:15:28,381 --> 01:15:29,800
Who do you think will come?

955
01:15:30,592 --> 01:15:31,718
Who knows?

956
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:35,096
Come in.

957
01:15:41,728 --> 01:15:45,148
- Where's Si-mok?
- Mr. Hwang just left.

958
01:15:45,273 --> 01:15:47,084
Already? I guess I came too late.

959
01:15:47,108 --> 01:15:49,653
- Well...
- I told you. He's not in his office.

960
01:15:50,695 --> 01:15:52,864
Oh, this is my office now.

961
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:54,950
- What?
- Sorry?

962
01:15:55,575 --> 01:15:56,677
Let's be a good team.

963
01:15:56,701 --> 01:15:57,887
- Pardon?
- Hold on.

964
01:15:57,911 --> 01:16:00,413
Wait, are you saying... Well...

965
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,976
This is Prosecutor Dong-jae Seo
of Division Three.

966
01:16:21,309 --> 01:16:22,561
<i>Prosecutor Dong-jae Seo?</i>

967
01:16:23,311 --> 01:16:25,981
I beg your pardon? Me?

968
01:16:28,441 --> 01:16:29,526
Hold on a second, please.

969
01:16:51,923 --> 01:16:53,174
Yes, sir.

970
01:16:55,176 --> 01:16:57,363
I didn't expect
to receive a call from you.

971
01:16:57,387 --> 01:16:59,031
Yes, I know. Of course.

972
01:16:59,055 --> 01:17:01,576
The problem? Everything has been resolved.

973
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,269
Have you forgotten who I am?
I'm the prosecutor, Dong-jae Seo.

974
01:17:06,605 --> 01:17:08,499
Of course. Totally.

975
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:10,942
When? I'd love that.

976
01:17:13,904 --> 01:17:16,156
CHANG-JUN LEE RESTS HERE.

977
01:17:35,842 --> 01:17:38,219
When I had soju at a tent bar

978
01:17:39,846 --> 01:17:42,140
for the very first time,
you were there with me.

979
01:17:44,684 --> 01:17:46,019
Why didn't you tell me?

980
01:17:49,272 --> 01:17:50,607
You should've told me.

981
01:17:55,362 --> 01:17:59,532
You made me feel so safe. What are you
doing there now, buried underground?

982
01:18:01,785 --> 01:18:02,911
Are you

983
01:18:04,704 --> 01:18:05,747
in peace there?

984
01:18:14,464 --> 01:18:15,715
I'm sorry.

985
01:18:19,719 --> 01:18:20,845
I'm sorry, honey.

986
01:18:52,502 --> 01:18:55,505
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF HANJO GROUP
YEON-JAE LEE

987
01:19:04,055 --> 01:19:08,393
Please let Mr. Chairman know that we're
working on getting his arrest suspended.

988
01:19:13,732 --> 01:19:16,234
10 MONTHS LATER

989
01:19:17,110 --> 01:19:19,547
<i>Rain is expected to start
from the southern regions on Saturday</i>

990
01:19:19,571 --> 01:19:22,611
<i>and to spread into the most parts of
the country. Have a great day, everyone.</i>

991
01:19:23,033 --> 01:19:27,370
<i>Next song is "Camellia Lady" by Mi-ja Lee.</i>

992
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:02,113
Prosecution, what is this about?

993
01:20:03,156 --> 01:20:05,909
What a toxic, crude melody,
don't you think?

994
01:20:06,284 --> 01:20:08,244
That's probably why the song got banned.

995
01:20:10,622 --> 01:20:13,684
This song, "Camellia Lady,"
was banned in 1968

996
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:16,377
for Japanese influence
shown throughout the song.

997
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:20,381
You may not believe it,
but that was before I was born.

998
01:20:22,092 --> 01:20:25,529
My deceased father used to like
the song a lot when he was alive.

999
01:20:25,553 --> 01:20:28,223
Hence, I always had this question.

1000
01:20:29,557 --> 01:20:31,157
Which parts show the Japanese influence?

1001
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:35,396
What about this song is toxic?

1002
01:20:44,447 --> 01:20:47,492
"Is this land still a good place to live?"

1003
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:50,954
Is this land still beautiful?

1004
01:20:51,621 --> 01:20:53,706
No, it's a lie.

1005
01:20:54,749 --> 01:20:57,168
Every day, we have to pretend
that we don't know,

1006
01:20:57,961 --> 01:21:00,004
quietly listen to lies

1007
01:21:00,547 --> 01:21:03,442
and endure whipping that sends
pulsating pain down to the bones

1008
01:21:03,466 --> 01:21:06,803
because we're servants, slaves
and puppets.

1009
01:21:08,263 --> 01:21:12,517
"How humiliating and mortifying."

1010
01:21:15,436 --> 01:21:18,773
Had this been 31 years ago,
what I just did would've been seen

1011
01:21:19,149 --> 01:21:21,029
as insulting the nation
and causing public harm.

1012
01:21:22,026 --> 01:21:24,445
Now that 31 years have passed,

1013
01:21:24,946 --> 01:21:26,447
I don't have to hesitate to deliver

1014
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:30,910
what the poet really wanted to convey,
and it makes me happy.

1015
01:21:32,912 --> 01:21:33,912
However,

1016
01:21:34,789 --> 01:21:36,666
the old poet had to give up

1017
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:40,604
his humble wish of wanting to go back

1018
01:21:40,628 --> 01:21:42,255
to teaching Korean at the school.

1019
01:21:43,506 --> 01:21:45,592
I would like to ask you all what you think

1020
01:21:46,718 --> 01:21:48,052
a true reinstatement means.

1021
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:50,972
Last but not least,

1022
01:21:51,764 --> 01:21:53,266
to the poet who was told

1023
01:21:53,808 --> 01:21:57,228
he's not allowed to return to the school
even though he could be reinstated,

1024
01:21:58,688 --> 01:22:02,233
I'd like to apologize as his contemporary
who has a lot to learn

1025
01:22:04,027 --> 01:22:05,486
from his experiences,

1026
01:22:05,987 --> 01:22:09,574
and I'd also like to thank him.

1027
01:22:17,081 --> 01:22:18,791
I'd love to assist him.

1028
01:22:19,125 --> 01:22:20,627
Isn't he so cool?

1029
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:49,673
<i>Today's noon news.</i>

1030
01:22:49,697 --> 01:22:52,551
<i>While the opposition party has been
strongly criticizing.</i>

1031
01:22:52,575 --> 01:22:54,720
<i>Prime Minister Chang-sik Kim
for abusing his power,</i>

1032
01:22:54,744 --> 01:22:57,640
<i>Prime Minister Kim has been
denying all the allegations</i>

1033
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:01,751
<i>saying that he is being targeted,
which is becoming a heated debate.</i>

1034
01:23:23,314 --> 01:23:25,709
Yes, this is Prosecutor Si-mok Hwang
of Criminal Division Two...

1035
01:23:25,733 --> 01:23:27,169
PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

1036
01:23:27,193 --> 01:23:28,420
Mr. Kang.

1037
01:23:28,444 --> 01:23:30,204
Have you already made yourself
at home there?

1038
01:23:30,738 --> 01:23:31,864
That won't be good.

1039
01:23:32,865 --> 01:23:33,945
What are you calling about?

1040
01:23:35,118 --> 01:23:38,198
There will be a special investigation
on Prime Minster Kim's power abuse case.

1041
01:23:38,788 --> 01:23:41,828
<i>Members of Congress chose you unanimously
for the special investigation team.</i>

1042
01:23:43,293 --> 01:23:44,293
I see.

1043
01:23:44,752 --> 01:23:47,088
You're not even surprised.
You have to be here in two days.

1044
01:23:47,714 --> 01:23:49,632
And when you're here,

1045
01:23:50,008 --> 01:23:51,608
you have to do something about Dong-jae.

1046
01:23:52,427 --> 01:23:53,529
What did he do?

1047
01:23:53,553 --> 01:23:56,347
He's still the same.
He hasn't changed one bit.

1048
01:23:59,267 --> 01:24:02,353
Okay. I won't be late.

1049
01:24:02,854 --> 01:24:03,855
Sure.

1050
01:25:16,803 --> 01:25:18,403
ALL EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

1051
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:30,274
STRANGER

1052
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,341
One, two, three.
