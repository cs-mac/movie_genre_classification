1
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,700
MY MOTHER'S CASTLE

2
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:51,841
<i>In those days, I was still a boy...</i>

3
00:02:52,508 --> 00:02:54,633
<i>...but I'd found my life's love...</i>

4
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,716
<i>...the hills of Provence.</i>

5
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,883
<i>A wonderful summer had flown by.</i>

6
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:01,175
Lili!

7
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:05,758
Marcel!

8
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:16,966
<i>The holidays were over.</i>

9
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:26,466
<i>I knew I couldn't wait a whole year...</i>

10
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,300
<i>...before seeing my dear hills.</i>

11
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:33,383
<i>I had to find a way.</i>

12
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:36,466
<i>I was ready for anything.</i>

13
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:48,300
Mom.

14
00:03:49,258 --> 00:03:53,008
<i>Each day saw a fresh start
to the story of Augustine...</i>

15
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,966
<i>...and her three men.</i>

16
00:04:00,175 --> 00:04:03,258
<i>My father, Joseph, had returned
to his daily life...</i>

17
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:06,341
<i>...as if the happy holidays
counted for nothing.</i>

18
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:10,591
<i>He went to school with us.
We went to school with him.</i>

19
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:12,466
Good morning, Teacher.

20
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,466
Good holiday?

21
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:21,925
<i>Of all the fathers, mine was the only one
who could cross the threshold of the door.</i>

22
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:27,883
"Autumn...

23
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:30,008
"...comma...

24
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:32,716
"...with its gusts of wind...

25
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:34,675
"...comma...

26
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:37,633
"...its long sighs..."

27
00:04:38,716 --> 00:04:42,758
<i>Instead of the dictation,
I'd hear the humming cicadas.</i>

28
00:04:48,383 --> 00:04:51,133
"...its muddy footpaths..."

29
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:53,800
<i>I'd see fig and olive trees.</i>

30
00:04:54,508 --> 00:04:58,425
<i>I wasn't in class.
I was roaming over my hills.</i>

31
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:04,300
"Period!"

32
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:17,633
Come in.

33
00:05:24,175 --> 00:05:25,466
That's him.

34
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:27,383
- It's you!
- It's you.

35
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:29,175
It's me?

36
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,425
- Bravo!
- Congratulations.

37
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:34,758
- It's remarkable.
- Quite remarkable.

38
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:38,341
<i>A fate far worse than
punishment awaited me.</i>

39
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:42,341
<i>I was to be the school's candidate...</i>

40
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:45,049
<i>...for the fearsome scholarship exams.</i>

41
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:49,966
<i>Chosen as the school's champion,
I had intensive coaching.</i>

42
00:05:50,674 --> 00:05:52,966
<i>I was left without a moment of peace.</i>

43
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:55,758
Cambrai, Douai, Dunkerque,
Valenciennes, Avesnes.

44
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:57,466
And Pas- de- Calais?

45
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,841
Capital: Arras. Main towns: Bethune, Boulogne.

46
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:03,341
We had...

47
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:07,133
...a good holiday.

48
00:06:09,008 --> 00:06:12,466
The good holiday which we had.

49
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:16,341
The good holiday which...

50
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:20,133
...we had.

51
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:27,758
Are you all right, Marcel?

52
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:31,091
Honestly, Augustine...

53
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:33,883
Too much learning can't hurt him.

54
00:06:34,008 --> 00:06:36,216
You don't have a headache?

55
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:39,633
<i>My sweet Augustine
tended to me like a convalescent...</i>

56
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:42,299
<i>...and cooked some delicious meals...</i>

57
00:06:42,508 --> 00:06:46,299
<i>...unfortunately preceded
by a dose of cod- liver oil.</i>

58
00:06:54,341 --> 00:06:56,841
<i>When I had school on Thursday...</i>

59
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:59,133
- It's Thursday.
- What?

60
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:04,841
<i>- "Rock- a- bye baby..."
- Thursday, that sacrosanct day off...</i>

61
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,966
<i>...I rebelled, venting my anger on poor Paul.</i>

62
00:07:11,716 --> 00:07:13,091
It was Paul!

63
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:15,841
Even Dad stays here Thursdays!

64
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:18,674
<i>The teachers took turns with me...</i>

65
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:21,966
<i>...like police officers questioning a suspect.</i>

66
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:27,883
<i>One Thursday morning, I made a detour.</i>

67
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:37,633
<i>Since Father had often told me,
I knew that God didn't exist.</i>

68
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:40,174
<i>But I wasn't completely sure.</i>

69
00:07:56,049 --> 00:07:58,424
<i>Sailors hear the call of the sea.</i>

70
00:07:58,674 --> 00:08:01,299
<i>I had felt the call of the hills.</i>

71
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:05,549
<i>Those hills of mine were calling me.</i>

72
00:08:13,883 --> 00:08:17,633
Garlaban, Taoumé, Red Head...

73
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:19,716
...I salute you.

74
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:23,424
- Dad?
- Yes.

75
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:26,008
- I've something to tell you.
- Me, too.

76
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,799
But it's important!

77
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,591
City air isn't good for Mom.

78
00:08:30,674 --> 00:08:31,799
What?

79
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:34,508
You said pure air is best for her.

80
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:37,341
It's a figure of speech. So what?

81
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:38,674
So I've an idea.

82
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,966
It's best if we live all year in the hills!

83
00:08:42,508 --> 00:08:44,758
- What about school?
- It's all right.

84
00:08:44,883 --> 00:08:47,216
We can come to Marseilles each morning.

85
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:48,966
- Who will?
- You and me.

86
00:08:49,091 --> 00:08:51,633
- On foot?
- On a bicycle.

87
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:54,299
- What bicycle?
- Uncle Jules can lend you his.

88
00:08:54,383 --> 00:08:57,549
- One for the two of us?
- I'll sit on the crossbar.

89
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:59,799
What about winter nights?

90
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:01,633
I'll carry a lantern.

91
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:05,299
Come on, Marcel. You can see it'll never work.

92
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:06,758
Dad...

93
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:09,966
...weren't you happy in the hills, too?

94
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:13,799
- Of course.
- Then why won't you go back?

95
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:19,841
I was very happy in the hills.
But you know...

96
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:23,799
...we were all very happy in the hills.

97
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:26,257
Weren't we, Augustine?

98
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:29,591
That's why we're going back
there for Christmas!

99
00:09:29,674 --> 00:09:31,132
At Christmas?

100
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:35,132
We're spending Christmas there.
Didn't Dad tell you?

101
00:09:35,382 --> 00:09:37,799
Marcel didn't let me speak a word.

102
00:09:40,091 --> 00:09:43,049
Children, this holiday is Mom's idea.

103
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:46,007
She insisted, so that I
had to give in to her, as always.

104
00:09:48,591 --> 00:09:49,841
Mother...

105
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,924
Thank you.

106
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:54,257
<i>My mother, decked out in furs...</i>

107
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:56,257
<i>...all rabbit fur, of course...</i>

108
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:59,132
<i>...looked like the beautiful
Canadian skaters...</i>

109
00:09:59,216 --> 00:10:02,132
<i>...who glided on the post- office timetables.</i>

110
00:10:05,174 --> 00:10:07,632
- Will we go even if it rains?
- Yes.

111
00:10:07,716 --> 00:10:12,007
We'll make ourselves thin
and rush between the drops.

112
00:10:12,132 --> 00:10:14,132
Perhaps there'll be snow!

113
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:16,549
- Like at the North Pole?
- Exactly.

114
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:18,757
Perhaps there'll be bears?

115
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:20,132
Oh, that...

116
00:10:21,757 --> 00:10:23,841
Colander. Funnel.

117
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:26,132
Pan. Coffee grinder.

118
00:10:26,216 --> 00:10:27,882
- Cheese grater.
- No.

119
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:30,174
Where is it? Get it.

120
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:32,549
Brush, candles, rifle case, wicks.

121
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,341
- I want to pee!
- Matches.

122
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,424
- Here's the grater.
- Good.

123
00:10:54,757 --> 00:10:57,091
Right, let's be off, boys!

124
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:21,591
Remember, Augustine...

125
00:11:21,674 --> 00:11:24,757
...we can't cross the grounds
of these estates.

126
00:11:25,341 --> 00:11:28,132
We have to go the long way round.
This way.

127
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:33,049
- How many kilometers are left to walk?
- Six.

128
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:35,716
It's a long way.

129
00:11:36,174 --> 00:11:39,924
We've the whole holiday to rest.
Let's go.

130
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,716
Give me that.
You're carrying enough.

131
00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:49,466
- I want to pee!
- Again? Hurry up!

132
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:52,174
<i>Under a small winter sun...</i>

133
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:54,507
<i>...pale and shorn like a monk...</i>

134
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:57,091
<i>...we walked the holiday path.</i>

135
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,424
<i>December, that nocturnal road- mender...</i>

136
00:12:00,507 --> 00:12:03,341
<i>...had cleared the weeds from the path.</i>

137
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:06,299
<i>No cicadas, no grasshoppers.</i>

138
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:09,382
<i>Not a sound, not a movement.</i>

139
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:16,549
<i>I thought of Lili of Bellons.</i>

140
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:21,466
<i>This little country boy was my friend
and had taught me about the hills.</i>

141
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:23,924
<i>Perhaps he was coming to meet me.</i>

142
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:31,299
Marcel? Hey, mate!

143
00:12:34,424 --> 00:12:35,924
Waiting for me?

144
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:39,799
No, I came to see Edmond Flutterby,
but he's out.

145
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:43,424
- I'm waiting for him to come back.
- Okay.

146
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:45,174
Good evening, all!

147
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,840
<i>I was happy because I knew he'd lied.</i>

148
00:12:48,965 --> 00:12:49,924
Hello, Mr. Joseph.

149
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:53,465
<i>He came to wait for me
beneath this cold Christmas rain...</i>

150
00:12:53,549 --> 00:12:56,715
<i>...whose glistening drops lingered
on his long lashes.</i>

151
00:12:57,174 --> 00:13:00,299
<i>He had waited for hours,
my brother of the hills.</i>

152
00:13:01,674 --> 00:13:03,549
Ah, Teacher.

153
00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:06,507
- You teachers are always on holiday.
- Let's not exaggerate.

154
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:08,715
I never take a holiday.

155
00:13:09,215 --> 00:13:11,549
Then again, I don't work either!

156
00:13:13,174 --> 00:13:14,715
Give me your bundle.

157
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,799
We came from Marseilles.
We couldn't see a thing.

158
00:13:26,465 --> 00:13:28,590
Fire is combustion...

159
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,049
...and oxygen permits this combustion.

160
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:34,132
And what about carbon dioxide, Dad?

161
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,257
<i>That evening, Christmas Eve...</i>

162
00:13:37,632 --> 00:13:39,924
<i>...I experienced a new emotion.</i>

163
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:41,965
<i>l saw rise up in the flames...</i>

164
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:46,090
<i>...a golden- headed bird
with blue plumage.</i>

165
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,257
I understood nothing.

166
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,299
It means, "Next year...

167
00:13:57,424 --> 00:14:00,715
"...if there aren't more of us,
let's hope there aren't less."

168
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,257
That's very nice.

169
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:06,340
It makes for a happy house,
so I'm glad it's in your home.

170
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:10,215
Don't you celebrate Christmas
at your house?

171
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,507
No. Dad says it's a day like any other.

172
00:14:13,632 --> 00:14:15,549
Doesn't he go to midnight mass?

173
00:14:15,632 --> 00:14:19,132
No. Especially not this year.
There's no rain.

174
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:23,257
And so he won't go until it rains.
He says that...

175
00:14:23,465 --> 00:14:26,174
...God has to be taught a lesson.

176
00:14:27,174 --> 00:14:28,757
Merry Christmas!

177
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,715
Baby's sleeping.

178
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,257
I'd heard about the 13 desserts.

179
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,340
- It's the first time I've seen
them all together. - Me, too.

180
00:14:39,465 --> 00:14:41,549
I promise you,
you won't just look at them.

181
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,507
Hold on there, you gluttons!
Before we eat...

182
00:14:45,632 --> 00:14:47,840
...you first have to tell me
what they're called.

183
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:50,549
- This isn't the time to--
- One must never...

184
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:53,132
"Miss the chance to learn something."

185
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:55,924
First, the four beggars.

186
00:14:57,007 --> 00:14:59,799
Figs, almonds, hazelnuts and raisins.

187
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,840
Then apples, pears, prunes and walnuts.
That makes eight.

188
00:15:05,465 --> 00:15:09,549
Tangerines, green watermelon,
white nougat, dark nougat.

189
00:15:09,632 --> 00:15:13,882
- You missed one.
- To soak up the oil, the hearth- cake.

190
00:15:20,715 --> 00:15:22,882
- Merry Christmas!
- Uncle Jules!

191
00:15:27,715 --> 00:15:31,132
What a pleasant surprise to see you here,
but we weren't expecting you.

192
00:15:31,215 --> 00:15:33,257
Have you left Rose and the baby?

193
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:38,090
My dear Joseph, ever since I was a boy
I've never missed midnight mass.

194
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:43,257
I took my bicycle and came to
hear it in the La Treille church...

195
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,757
...before celebrating the
Savior's birth with you.

196
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:49,215
The mass was beautiful.

197
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,340
There was a great big créche.

198
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,882
The church was full of
flowering rosemary...

199
00:15:53,965 --> 00:15:57,174
...and the children sang wonderful
carols from the 14th century.

200
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,715
- Too bad you didn't come.
- I'd come out of curiosity.

201
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:03,340
But I think people who go to church...

202
00:16:03,465 --> 00:16:06,840
...for the spectacle of the music,
mock the faith of others.

203
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:07,965
Fine words.

204
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:10,465
Come and see! Quick!

205
00:16:11,465 --> 00:16:13,173
Quick, Marcel, look!

206
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:17,257
Thank you, Uncle Jules.

207
00:16:19,048 --> 00:16:20,632
Indeed, Joseph...

208
00:16:20,798 --> 00:16:23,465
...you were at mass all the same tonight.

209
00:16:24,923 --> 00:16:26,132
How come?

210
00:16:27,257 --> 00:16:29,673
You were there with the entire family...

211
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:32,465
...because I prayed for
you for a long time.

212
00:16:34,215 --> 00:16:37,590
What favor did you ask of the Almighty?

213
00:16:37,673 --> 00:16:39,132
The finest gift.

214
00:16:39,673 --> 00:16:42,632
I begged Him to grace you
with His presence...

215
00:16:43,465 --> 00:16:45,298
...and give you faith.

216
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:51,298
As you know, I don't think...

217
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:53,507
...that the creator of the universe...

218
00:16:53,632 --> 00:16:56,007
...bothers with microbes likes us.

219
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:59,798
But your prayer...

220
00:17:00,632 --> 00:17:02,257
...my dear Jules...

221
00:17:02,798 --> 00:17:06,507
...is fine and beautiful evidence
of your friendship for us.

222
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:09,465
I thank you for it.

223
00:17:11,507 --> 00:17:13,798
Merry Christmas, my dear Joseph.

224
00:17:46,423 --> 00:17:49,965
- Dad, when can we come back?
- For the next holiday.

225
00:17:50,632 --> 00:17:53,007
- When is that?
- Easter.

226
00:17:53,882 --> 00:17:57,840
- How many days is that?
- You're getting on my nerves.

227
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,048
lt'll be a good exercise
for the exam for you.

228
00:18:02,423 --> 00:18:06,965
Work out the days,
minutes and seconds until Easter.

229
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,757
2,472 hours, 60 minutes in an hour, so...

230
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:14,423
<i>My love of the hills triumphed
over the barbarism of mathematics.</i>

231
00:18:14,632 --> 00:18:17,465
<i>103 days, 148,320 minutes...</i>

232
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:21,132
<i>...and 8,899,200 seconds later...</i>

233
00:18:21,257 --> 00:18:24,632
<i>...we had returned
to the enchanted country- house.</i>

234
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:39,465
<i>Uncle Jules upheld the tradition.</i>

235
00:18:39,923 --> 00:18:43,715
- Happy Easter, my dear Joseph.
- Happy Easter, my dear Jules.

236
00:18:44,132 --> 00:18:46,215
And here, for the big eaters...

237
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,632
It's lovely.

238
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:57,923
Here again are the sweet days
of doves and love!

239
00:18:59,423 --> 00:19:02,673
- Where are you going, tadpole?
- To the hills.

240
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,382
- And your geography homework?
- I have to see to Lili's traps.

241
00:19:06,465 --> 00:19:10,673
- He'll have to manage.
- He can't. His legs are hairy.

242
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:12,298
Hairy legs, so what?

243
00:19:12,423 --> 00:19:15,923
He's growing.
His dad needs him to work.

244
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:18,757
I need you to work, too.
Jump to it.

245
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:20,715
Mom wanted some thyme.

246
00:19:20,923 --> 00:19:23,715
I remind you that your exam
is in three months.

247
00:19:24,132 --> 00:19:26,423
And my stew is in three hours.

248
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:30,090
Stew. In that case, of course...

249
00:19:47,131 --> 00:19:50,798
<i>I didn't know very much about the
customs and habits of the weaker sex.</i>

250
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,006
<i>I only knew my mother and my aunt,
who weren't women...</i>

251
00:19:54,131 --> 00:19:56,465
<i>...but were a mother and an aunt.</i>

252
00:19:56,548 --> 00:19:58,548
Which way to Les Bellons?

253
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,256
- Lost your way?
- Yes...

254
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,465
...but don't be so familiar.

255
00:20:02,756 --> 00:20:04,423
I'm not some peasant girl.

256
00:20:04,506 --> 00:20:07,548
<i>I found this strange creature
to be pretentious.</i>

257
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:10,423
<i>I decided she must be rich.</i>

258
00:20:10,506 --> 00:20:12,340
Which way is it?

259
00:20:12,465 --> 00:20:13,840
The path to the right.

260
00:20:13,965 --> 00:20:17,131
You know very well that it is blocked
by enormous spider webs.

261
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,923
- Walk round them.
- Not in the grass.

262
00:20:21,048 --> 00:20:24,006
I saw a horrible,
long, green animal in there.

263
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:27,590
<i>I knew she saw a lizard, but,
because she irritated me...</i>

264
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:31,965
A snake, probably.
This is Snake Valley. They eat rats.

265
00:20:32,256 --> 00:20:34,381
It's full of rats and snakes.

266
00:20:34,506 --> 00:20:35,881
Oh, my Lord!

267
00:20:35,965 --> 00:20:40,215
If you were a gallant boy, you
wouldn't leave me in such a dangerous spot.

268
00:20:40,298 --> 00:20:43,465
I won't tell you off if
you kill the spiders.

269
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,548
I don't care about that.

270
00:20:45,881 --> 00:20:47,131
Let's go.

271
00:20:48,673 --> 00:20:49,756
Wait!

272
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,881
Come on.

273
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:29,340
Les Bellons is just
around the bend there.

274
00:21:29,631 --> 00:21:31,465
I might get lost again.

275
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:33,465
You may come with me.

276
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:37,965
<i>But the thyme, homework,
and traps being preyed on by foxes...</i>

277
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,840
Another day, maybe.
Today, I can't.

278
00:21:41,173 --> 00:21:42,798
Thank you, anyway.

279
00:21:46,131 --> 00:21:49,465
- You're staying?
- Yes. I'll wait till someone comes.

280
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,756
No one ever comes here.

281
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,798
Too bad. When Mother realizes
I haven't returned...

282
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,298
...she'll alert the peasants and police...

283
00:21:57,423 --> 00:21:59,090
...but they'll come too late.

284
00:21:59,173 --> 00:22:00,381
Too late?

285
00:22:00,465 --> 00:22:02,798
I'll be lying here dead...

286
00:22:03,548 --> 00:22:06,590
...with my throat slit
and blood everywhere!

287
00:22:08,256 --> 00:22:10,381
You'll read that in the paper.

288
00:22:10,465 --> 00:22:14,465
<i>Guaranteed. My father works as a journalist
for Le Petit Marseillais.</i>

289
00:22:14,673 --> 00:22:16,173
Come on, then.

290
00:22:17,465 --> 00:22:21,131
My uncle reads that paper every day
for the politics.

291
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:25,381
- Politics aren't good enough for my father.
- Is he the director?

292
00:22:25,465 --> 00:22:28,798
Better than that.
He corrects everyone's articles.

293
00:22:29,506 --> 00:22:33,381
And he also writes poems
that are printed in Parisian magazines.

294
00:22:33,465 --> 00:22:36,256
Rhyming poems, like Victor Hugo?

295
00:22:36,506 --> 00:22:38,173
Exactly, sir.

296
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:41,298
- What's your father's name?
- Loïs de Montmajour.

297
00:22:41,423 --> 00:22:44,048
- What?
- Loïs de Montmajour.

298
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,923
<i>That name wasn't in my book.</i>

299
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,798
<i>I didn't tell her, for I was struck with respect
at the thought that she was of noble blood.</i>

300
00:22:51,923 --> 00:22:54,590
<i>That was why she hated familiarity.</i>

301
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:57,590
- What does your father do?
- He's a teacher.

302
00:22:57,798 --> 00:22:59,006
Teacher of what?

303
00:22:59,131 --> 00:23:01,256
Everything.
At the Chartreux School.

304
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,090
A state school? A schoolteacher.

305
00:23:04,465 --> 00:23:07,340
That's good, but not as
good as a professor.

306
00:23:07,548 --> 00:23:09,381
Does your father hunt?

307
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:12,298
- What's that?
- Thyme.

308
00:23:13,214 --> 00:23:14,464
Smell it.

309
00:23:16,048 --> 00:23:17,923
- Horrible!
- What?

310
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:20,923
Your hands are like beggar's hands.

311
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:24,381
It's only good, clean dirt.

312
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:29,173
I gave you permission to speak casually
with me. I wonder why you don't.

313
00:23:29,298 --> 00:23:31,673
I have to be polite with nobility.

314
00:23:32,923 --> 00:23:34,798
I think I impress you.

315
00:23:35,048 --> 00:23:38,839
- Me? Not at all!
- It's not me that intimidates you.

316
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:40,464
It's my beauty.

317
00:23:41,048 --> 00:23:42,798
My name is Isabelle.

318
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:46,006
I'm telling you and
you'll never forget.

319
00:23:46,631 --> 00:23:49,173
- What's yours?
- My name is Marcel.

320
00:23:50,048 --> 00:23:51,256
Not bad.

321
00:23:51,714 --> 00:23:54,881
Not as nice as Isabelle.
But you're not to blame.

322
00:23:56,298 --> 00:23:57,798
Are you coming?

323
00:23:59,756 --> 00:24:02,423
My baby, you're finally here.

324
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:06,089
Just think, Mother dear,
I lost my way among the flowers.

325
00:24:07,048 --> 00:24:10,298
I thought a wolf had devoured you.

326
00:24:10,423 --> 00:24:12,381
Don't laugh, Mother.

327
00:24:12,881 --> 00:24:15,298
Hissing snakes had surrounded me.

328
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:19,131
Fortunately, a young boy saved me
and brought me home.

329
00:24:20,464 --> 00:24:22,923
His hands are dirty, but he's brave.

330
00:24:23,548 --> 00:24:26,589
It's true his hands are dirty.
Very dirty.

331
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,881
It's because I went to pick some thyme
for my mother.

332
00:24:29,964 --> 00:24:32,464
I'll invite him to play with you...

333
00:24:33,298 --> 00:24:35,881
...if he doesn't use any nasty words.

334
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:38,798
Me, use bad words?
I know a few, but I never use them.

335
00:24:40,506 --> 00:24:43,381
I knew it! That's not how it's done.

336
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:45,589
How then?

337
00:24:45,964 --> 00:24:47,631
Don't raise my hand.

338
00:24:47,756 --> 00:24:51,089
You have to bend your head down,
as if you were greeting me.

339
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:52,464
Try again.

340
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:57,631
Not bad.

341
00:24:57,964 --> 00:24:59,589
I'll teach you...

342
00:25:00,464 --> 00:25:02,089
...this afternoon.

343
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:20,131
A good thing I didn't
wait for the thyme.

344
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:28,089
On a stone I found a girl.

345
00:25:30,131 --> 00:25:33,173
- Dead?
- No, she was lost.

346
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:36,631
They're even more dangerous!

347
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:38,839
How old is she?

348
00:25:40,298 --> 00:25:41,881
She's my height.

349
00:25:42,464 --> 00:25:45,339
- Where does she live?
- The big house in Les Bellons.

350
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:47,589
Her mother's beautiful.

351
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,131
How about that?

352
00:25:51,923 --> 00:25:53,506
And the daughter?

353
00:25:53,923 --> 00:25:56,673
She's pretty. Her calves are chubby.

354
00:25:58,131 --> 00:26:01,048
- You noticed that, did you?
- Do you like her?

355
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:05,464
- She's okay. She's polite to her mother.
- Then it's not her mother.

356
00:26:06,006 --> 00:26:08,464
Yes, she is! She calls her Mother.

357
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:13,964
- And her father?
- He writes lovely poems.

358
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:15,589
And he's a nobleman.

359
00:26:15,714 --> 00:26:17,881
His name's Loïs de Montmajour.

360
00:26:17,964 --> 00:26:21,423
Loïs de Montmajour.
That's obviously an alias.

361
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:24,673
Poets live in a world of dreams...

362
00:26:25,006 --> 00:26:26,798
...and die of hunger.

363
00:26:27,048 --> 00:26:28,464
Not all of them.

364
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:31,964
Lucienne's husband,
who writes songs for the Alcazar.

365
00:26:32,131 --> 00:26:33,673
He's given quite a bit of money.

366
00:26:33,798 --> 00:26:35,714
But his songs are so rude!

367
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:38,256
Yes, but they rhyme.

368
00:26:39,672 --> 00:26:42,047
You have strange ideas about poetry.

369
00:26:42,672 --> 00:26:45,464
"It's the wa- ter- lily,
of the water lily

370
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:48,339
"It's the Si- do- nie, of my Sidonie

371
00:26:48,464 --> 00:26:51,172
"Sido in the water

372
00:26:51,297 --> 00:26:52,797
"Nie to the lily

373
00:26:52,922 --> 00:26:55,797
"And Lily on my knee"

374
00:27:00,506 --> 00:27:05,256
<i>Let them laugh. I wasn't
listening, as I thought of Isabelle...</i>

375
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:08,631
<i>...who had let me kiss her hand
and who was waiting for me.</i>

376
00:27:23,797 --> 00:27:25,672
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

377
00:27:26,006 --> 00:27:30,006
What's incredible is that you play
with both hands, at the same time...

378
00:27:30,131 --> 00:27:32,047
...with all your fingers.

379
00:27:33,464 --> 00:27:36,172
Next year, I'll be at the conservatory.

380
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:51,631
- Do you like music?
- I don't know.

381
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:53,922
Kneel down.

382
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,131
- Where?
- At my feet.

383
00:27:56,672 --> 00:27:58,756
- At your feet?
- Go on.

384
00:28:02,631 --> 00:28:05,006
Now put your ear to the piano.

385
00:28:56,631 --> 00:29:00,756
<i>I looked at her tiny hands
which created such music.</i>

386
00:29:00,964 --> 00:29:04,672
<i>This fairy held the key to
my secret castles!</i>

387
00:29:29,297 --> 00:29:30,506
Princess.

388
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:32,797
That's my father.

389
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:43,881
Greetings, princess!

390
00:29:46,506 --> 00:29:49,047
Father, this is the boy who--

391
00:29:49,131 --> 00:29:51,422
The knight who hunts the adder...

392
00:29:51,506 --> 00:29:54,547
...kills the spider,
to make us gladder.

393
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:56,797
It was a grass snake.

394
00:29:57,422 --> 00:30:01,047
Pages, sound the trumpets
so oft reviled...

395
00:30:02,256 --> 00:30:04,672
...for this lad who saved my child.

396
00:30:04,797 --> 00:30:05,881
Loïs!

397
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:12,130
Child,
for the poet you must without delay...

398
00:30:12,797 --> 00:30:15,547
...prepare the emerald absinthe today!

399
00:30:22,797 --> 00:30:25,964
My muse uses me up sometimes.

400
00:30:28,714 --> 00:30:31,964
For four days I've been trying
to change a poor rhyme.

401
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:35,089
It's a brown stain on my alabaster.

402
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:37,422
A thorn on my rose.

403
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,255
Stop!

404
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:43,255
And yet it isn't far. It's here...

405
00:30:45,422 --> 00:30:47,839
...fluttering around my lyre.

406
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,089
The poet is composing.
The visit is over.

407
00:31:16,964 --> 00:31:19,630
See how this couple, oh,
watch them attentively...

408
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:22,839
...brings light to the bushes
with infinite delicacy.

409
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,172
Mate!

410
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,964
What about the traps?

411
00:31:28,047 --> 00:31:31,214
- Something funny happened.
- I know. Paul told me.

412
00:31:31,297 --> 00:31:33,797
- What?
- That you were with a girl.

413
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,589
An idiot scared of spiders.

414
00:31:35,672 --> 00:31:37,964
Idiot?
She can play the piano.

415
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:40,589
It's easy to turn a handle.

416
00:31:40,797 --> 00:31:42,255
Even I can do it.

417
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,922
What handle? It's a real piano.
She uses both hands.

418
00:31:46,047 --> 00:31:49,464
In the meantime, the ants and
foxes must have been feasting.

419
00:31:49,755 --> 00:31:54,255
- Perhaps it's not too late?
- Not too late? The ants don't waste time!

420
00:31:55,589 --> 00:31:56,755
See you!

421
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:05,422
<i>It was Easter Sunday.</i>

422
00:32:05,505 --> 00:32:09,005
<i>I wanted to surprise Isabelle
by meeting her after mass.</i>

423
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,880
Her father's a boozer.

424
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,797
- Who do you mean?
- You know very well.

425
00:32:16,047 --> 00:32:18,839
- Who said he's a boozer?
- My father.

426
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:22,464
He found him crawling
on the road once.

427
00:32:23,255 --> 00:32:25,255
The truth is that
your father's a liar!

428
00:32:25,464 --> 00:32:29,297
I don't like to be called a liar,
especially by someone from Marseilles!

429
00:32:29,672 --> 00:32:34,130
If he was crawling,
he must have been really ill.

430
00:32:34,339 --> 00:32:36,839
Everyone's ill from time to time.

431
00:32:37,297 --> 00:32:39,339
He had thrown up his Pernod.

432
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:41,880
That's a funny illness.

433
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:49,797
- Speak of the devil.
- Communion wine's strong.

434
00:33:33,589 --> 00:33:37,255
"I swear obedience and
loyalty to my queen."

435
00:33:38,005 --> 00:33:40,505
And for her, I'm ready to die.

436
00:33:40,797 --> 00:33:43,088
"And for her, I'm ready to..."

437
00:33:43,297 --> 00:33:45,838
- To die.
- "To die."

438
00:33:46,255 --> 00:33:48,047
Good. You may stand.

439
00:33:54,797 --> 00:33:58,255
- What's this game?
- I'm the queen and you're my knight.

440
00:33:58,713 --> 00:34:01,505
- And?
- You have to do everything I say.

441
00:34:02,422 --> 00:34:03,755
Everything?

442
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,463
Everything.

443
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:09,630
<i>The queen wanted to test my courage.</i>

444
00:34:12,755 --> 00:34:15,213
<i>She said if I stroke the beast...</i>

445
00:34:15,297 --> 00:34:17,130
I'll name you Captain of the Guard.

446
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,630
- Me?
- Yes.

447
00:34:33,963 --> 00:34:36,130
<i>I moved towards the beast...</i>

448
00:34:36,255 --> 00:34:39,672
<i>...counting on my hypnotic stare...</i>

449
00:34:39,797 --> 00:34:42,297
<i>...and the sturdiness of his chain.</i>

450
00:34:54,422 --> 00:34:58,422
<i>He was a lonely, pathetic animal,
craving to be loved...</i>

451
00:34:58,547 --> 00:35:01,547
<i>...ready to follow me to
the end of the earth.</i>

452
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,672
My knight, I'm pleased with you.

453
00:35:10,297 --> 00:35:12,380
<i>After testing my bravery...</i>

454
00:35:12,463 --> 00:35:15,130
<i>...she lightly mocked my manly virtues.</i>

455
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:18,338
<i>That day, I was successively...</i>

456
00:35:18,963 --> 00:35:22,797
<i>...the loyal black slave carrying
his lady's train and fanning her.</i>

457
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,422
Open your mouth. Close your eyes.

458
00:35:33,338 --> 00:35:36,588
<i>And I ended up as a fierce dog,
foaming at the mouth.</i>

459
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,130
Brutus! Here!

460
00:35:43,047 --> 00:35:44,213
Sit up!

461
00:35:45,505 --> 00:35:46,588
Give!

462
00:35:47,505 --> 00:35:48,672
Go on!

463
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:50,255
Sit!

464
00:35:52,005 --> 00:35:53,588
Close your eyes.

465
00:36:02,963 --> 00:36:04,505
Open your mouth.

466
00:36:11,547 --> 00:36:13,755
She made him run on all fours.

467
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,922
- Barking!
- Funny game.

468
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:20,672
A stupid one.
No girl ever made me run on all fours.

469
00:36:21,172 --> 00:36:23,005
Me, neither. Never in my life.

470
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:26,755
We were playing knights and queen.
It's poetry you can't understand.

471
00:36:27,005 --> 00:36:29,380
Was the grasshopper poetry, too?

472
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,922
The grasshopper?

473
00:36:31,005 --> 00:36:34,005
She said, "Close your eyes,
open your mouth..."

474
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,005
...and put a grasshopper in.

475
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,422
A live one.

476
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:38,797
- And he ate it.
- No.

477
00:36:38,922 --> 00:36:40,005
You did!

478
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,505
I spat it out. I did.

479
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,713
It's true. I saw him.

480
00:36:44,797 --> 00:36:48,547
Whether he ate it or not,
it's a stupid joke.

481
00:36:49,005 --> 00:36:51,922
It's clear that this girl
takes you for an imbecile.

482
00:36:52,005 --> 00:36:54,588
You're not to go back there.
Understand?

483
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:57,088
- But, Dad--
- No buts.

484
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,463
If girls make you eat
grasshoppers now...

485
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,963
...what'll it be in years to come?

486
00:37:08,296 --> 00:37:11,421
We saw her at mass with her parents.

487
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,755
She's quite pretty...

488
00:37:14,421 --> 00:37:16,796
...but she looks pretentious and sly.

489
00:37:17,046 --> 00:37:19,130
It's nothing to get worked up about.

490
00:37:19,255 --> 00:37:22,255
Of course not,
but Marcel is so sensitive.

491
00:37:22,713 --> 00:37:24,255
I know he'll suffer.

492
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,505
I won't have my son play the fool
for some drunkard's daughter!

493
00:37:28,796 --> 00:37:32,171
<i>I was dismayed by my
family's sudden hostility.</i>

494
00:37:32,755 --> 00:37:34,255
<i>Their mistake...</i>

495
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:37,421
<i>...was to have misjudged the power
of this unique feeling...</i>

496
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:40,630
<i>...which they had never felt,
since there was only one Isabelle...</i>

497
00:37:40,755 --> 00:37:42,505
<i>...and they didn't know her.</i>

498
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,963
Isabelle...

499
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,630
Are you talking to me?

500
00:37:46,713 --> 00:37:48,630
I don't talk to spies.

501
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:51,713
- I talk to my heart.
- You're going nuts.

502
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,963
What is it?

503
00:37:57,463 --> 00:38:00,088
Isabelle's downstairs. Go on in.

504
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,630
<i>Since my early childhood, I have
never tolerated the animal constraints...</i>

505
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:20,130
<i>...that mock the human condition.</i>

506
00:38:20,255 --> 00:38:22,921
Marcel.
We're having a disaster here.

507
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,421
I caught a chill.

508
00:38:26,463 --> 00:38:28,546
I was feverish all night...

509
00:38:31,796 --> 00:38:33,338
...and now I'm ill.

510
00:38:33,463 --> 00:38:35,213
You understand, ill.

511
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,755
That's all right,
I've been ill before.

512
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:40,838
But the worst thing...

513
00:38:48,296 --> 00:38:49,963
Can you smell that?

514
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,796
<i>An appalling odor suddenly
infected my nostrils.</i>

515
00:39:01,463 --> 00:39:04,588
That naughty cat.
He does some terrible things!

516
00:39:05,463 --> 00:39:07,963
Let me tell you the worst thing...

517
00:39:08,088 --> 00:39:10,755
<i>Alas, I knew the worst already.</i>

518
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,380
<i>My queen, on this day...</i>

519
00:39:13,463 --> 00:39:16,838
<i>...when we swore our love,
had an upset stomach.</i>

520
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:20,630
<i>And now she was blaming
it on the cat.</i>

521
00:39:43,796 --> 00:39:45,421
"Isabelle Cassignol."

522
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:49,046
<i>I was wondering
who this Isabelle Cassignol was...</i>

523
00:39:49,255 --> 00:39:52,005
<i>...when I saw an envelope addressed...</i>

524
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,005
<i>...to Mr. Adolphe Cassignol...</i>

525
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:57,838
<i>...proofreader at the Petit Marseillais,
Quai du Canal, Marseilles.</i>

526
00:39:59,796 --> 00:40:02,088
<i>I no longer understood anything.</i>

527
00:40:03,713 --> 00:40:05,546
Now the worst thing.

528
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:10,755
My father has argued with his supervisor,
who's just a jealous fool.

529
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:14,755
We have to leave this afternoon.
The house is for sale...

530
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:17,963
...and I'll never come back. Never.

531
00:40:18,588 --> 00:40:19,963
That's a shame.

532
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:23,630
Is that all? I thought you'd cry.

533
00:40:25,213 --> 00:40:26,463
So did I.

534
00:40:27,421 --> 00:40:29,921
When the coach comes for us...

535
00:40:30,296 --> 00:40:32,338
...I know I'll be sad...

536
00:40:32,505 --> 00:40:34,588
...and you should know why.

537
00:40:35,713 --> 00:40:38,921
Yes. Are those your school books?

538
00:40:40,588 --> 00:40:42,796
I'll play you a farewell tune.

539
00:40:46,379 --> 00:40:49,254
I hope that will make you cry.

540
00:40:53,796 --> 00:40:55,796
Wait, I'll be right back.

541
00:41:00,504 --> 00:41:04,004
<i>Upstairs, Mrs. Cassignol
was doing housework before leaving.</i>

542
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,213
Damn this trunk!

543
00:41:07,296 --> 00:41:09,963
When I travel, it does a bunk!

544
00:41:13,129 --> 00:41:15,879
<i>Loïs de Montmajour was
Adolphe Cassignol...</i>

545
00:41:15,963 --> 00:41:19,129
<i>...who had changed names
like an escaped convict.</i>

546
00:41:19,963 --> 00:41:21,088
Damn it!

547
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:23,796
<i>The mantelpiece was cracked...</i>

548
00:41:24,338 --> 00:41:26,754
<i>...the clock was missing a hand...</i>

549
00:41:27,129 --> 00:41:29,629
<i>...the precious carpet was a rag...</i>

550
00:41:29,713 --> 00:41:32,838
<i>...and the queen was called
Isabelle Cassignol...</i>

551
00:41:35,629 --> 00:41:37,963
<i>...and she had an upset stomach.</i>

552
00:41:52,254 --> 00:41:55,463
- Do you want something?
- No, I came to see you.

553
00:41:55,879 --> 00:41:59,421
Edmond Flutterby saw a flock
of migrants today.

554
00:42:01,713 --> 00:42:04,629
- If only you had time.
- Now I have time.

555
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,963
I just made my last visit to her.

556
00:42:10,046 --> 00:42:12,629
- How did she take it?
- She cried.

557
00:42:13,754 --> 00:42:16,254
- I think she's leaving.
- It serves her right.

558
00:42:16,463 --> 00:42:18,504
She treated you like a dog.

559
00:42:19,213 --> 00:42:20,963
- Do you think you're a dog?
- No.

560
00:42:21,088 --> 00:42:23,213
She needs a kick up the bum.

561
00:42:24,088 --> 00:42:26,588
Right.
Let's go and see the traps.

562
00:42:35,296 --> 00:42:37,713
- Did you mention your school?
- Yes.

563
00:42:38,629 --> 00:42:40,379
If she loves you...

564
00:42:40,963 --> 00:42:42,796
...she'll write to you.

565
00:42:49,171 --> 00:42:50,463
She's gone.

566
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:03,046
Come on.

567
00:43:06,338 --> 00:43:08,296
Don't be a fool.

568
00:43:15,004 --> 00:43:17,088
Girls are boys who came out wrong.

569
00:43:20,129 --> 00:43:21,588
That's a funny idea.

570
00:43:21,671 --> 00:43:24,129
You said so, about Dad's cousin...

571
00:43:24,504 --> 00:43:26,879
...the one who smokes cigarettes.

572
00:43:26,963 --> 00:43:29,713
Yes? You mean boys--

573
00:43:29,796 --> 00:43:32,338
That means girls are
nature's mistakes.

574
00:43:34,546 --> 00:43:38,046
The proof? They blush over nothing
and cry all the time.

575
00:43:38,338 --> 00:43:41,629
We don't.
And we can whistle and spit, too!

576
00:43:41,963 --> 00:43:45,629
That shows you're real boys.

577
00:43:47,963 --> 00:43:49,713
You seem happier now.

578
00:43:50,129 --> 00:43:52,046
Yes, but you can't tell.

579
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,796
Obviously, after all this trouble...

580
00:43:56,546 --> 00:43:59,463
...you won't want to come
back here on vacation.

581
00:43:59,629 --> 00:44:02,671
Mother. I'll never leave
my hills for a girl.

582
00:44:09,004 --> 00:44:12,629
Joseph, let's come to
the hills every Saturday.

583
00:44:14,046 --> 00:44:15,337
Every week?

584
00:44:15,796 --> 00:44:17,587
When the trolley comes this far--

585
00:44:17,671 --> 00:44:20,254
The boys will have moustaches by then.

586
00:44:21,879 --> 00:44:24,671
Look at them.
They've never looked better.

587
00:44:25,546 --> 00:44:27,421
My appetite's never been so good.

588
00:44:27,671 --> 00:44:31,712
- I know, but...
- In my opinion, Augustine's right.

589
00:44:31,796 --> 00:44:33,421
City air is poison.

590
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:37,379
Maybe, but we can't
afford a horse and cart.

591
00:44:38,004 --> 00:44:39,962
It's a four- hour walk.

592
00:44:40,087 --> 00:44:42,712
We'd get here at
8:00 p.m. on Saturday...

593
00:44:42,796 --> 00:44:45,546
...and we'd have to
leave Sunday afternoon.

594
00:44:45,671 --> 00:44:47,046
Why not Monday morning?

595
00:44:47,129 --> 00:44:50,171
Because I have to be at school
at 8:00 sharp, you know that.

596
00:44:55,629 --> 00:44:57,171
I have an idea.

597
00:44:57,962 --> 00:45:01,046
<i>Augustine's idea wasn't a bad one.</i>

598
00:45:01,796 --> 00:45:05,129
<i>She often met the
headmaster's wife at market.</i>

599
00:45:05,379 --> 00:45:09,087
<i>She was a fine- looking woman
with a gold necklace.</i>

600
00:45:09,671 --> 00:45:13,629
<i>My mother, small and shy,
would discretely greet her from afar.</i>

601
00:45:13,754 --> 00:45:16,254
<i>But as she was ready to
do anything for us...</i>

602
00:45:16,379 --> 00:45:19,379
<i>...she made her greetings more obvious...</i>

603
00:45:19,462 --> 00:45:23,379
<i>...drew nearer and eventually
brushed the hand...</i>

604
00:45:23,462 --> 00:45:26,004
<i>...of the headmaster's wife
in a basket of potatoes.</i>

605
00:45:26,129 --> 00:45:29,087
<i>That kind woman advised my mother...</i>

606
00:45:29,212 --> 00:45:32,962
<i>...not to buy those tubers
and took her to another stall.</i>

607
00:45:35,921 --> 00:45:39,212
<i>Two days later,
they were shopping together.</i>

608
00:45:42,129 --> 00:45:45,379
<i>The headmaster's wife asked my mother...</i>

609
00:45:45,462 --> 00:45:48,796
<i>...to come and try an English
beverage called tea.</i>

610
00:45:50,379 --> 00:45:55,129
<i>And to top it all off, Augustine profited
from her talents as a seamstress.</i>

611
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:59,421
<i>Joseph was unaware of all this.</i>

612
00:46:00,379 --> 00:46:03,421
<i>His surprise was complete
when he read a note...</i>

613
00:46:03,504 --> 00:46:06,379
<i>...from the headmaster concerning him.</i>

614
00:46:06,796 --> 00:46:10,921
<i>The omnipotent head,
stayed by fancy, had decreed...</i>

615
00:46:11,004 --> 00:46:13,004
<i>...that my father would thereafter be...</i>

616
00:46:13,129 --> 00:46:15,754
"...in charge of supervising students
on Thursday morning"?

617
00:46:15,837 --> 00:46:18,837
<i>And that the music and gym teachers,
in exchange...</i>

618
00:46:18,962 --> 00:46:21,254
<i>...would take over his pupils...</i>

619
00:46:21,962 --> 00:46:23,587
On Monday morning!

620
00:46:24,587 --> 00:46:27,504
We can spend the weekend in the hills.

621
00:46:27,754 --> 00:46:30,879
Yes. Do I thank the Headmaster?

622
00:46:31,254 --> 00:46:32,254
No.

623
00:46:32,337 --> 00:46:36,921
He upsets a state school's scheduling
to suit one single teacher.

624
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:41,046
- We must do something.
- l already thought of it.

625
00:46:41,171 --> 00:46:44,379
I sent a big bouquet of
flowers to his wife.

626
00:46:46,087 --> 00:46:48,962
That might seem too familiar!

627
00:46:49,337 --> 00:46:52,421
She was very pleased. She even said...

628
00:46:53,129 --> 00:46:54,337
...I was a dear.

629
00:46:54,462 --> 00:46:56,837
- You spoke?
- Of course!

630
00:46:57,087 --> 00:46:59,212
We do our shopping together.

631
00:46:59,754 --> 00:47:02,046
She even calls me Augustine.

632
00:47:02,462 --> 00:47:04,587
So, it was you who...

633
00:47:07,879 --> 00:47:09,379
My children...

634
00:47:10,504 --> 00:47:13,171
...your mother has a gift for intrigue.

635
00:47:15,462 --> 00:47:19,712
<i>So every Saturday we were
able to go to the hills.</i>

636
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:23,004
I am telling you, Augustine...

637
00:47:23,129 --> 00:47:26,796
...in the society of the future,
all castles will become hospitals...

638
00:47:27,087 --> 00:47:30,671
...all the walls will be demolished
and paths laid out.

639
00:47:31,129 --> 00:47:33,129
Another revolution?

640
00:47:33,212 --> 00:47:35,379
Not a revolution.

641
00:47:35,462 --> 00:47:38,879
Revolution is an ill- chosen word,
because it means a full circle.

642
00:47:38,962 --> 00:47:42,212
And so, the upper classes
fall to the bottom...

643
00:47:42,295 --> 00:47:45,879
...but then they move back up
and it starts all over again!

644
00:47:45,962 --> 00:47:49,462
<i>I loved Father's political
and social lectures...</i>

645
00:47:49,587 --> 00:47:52,004
<i>...and wondered why
the President of the Republic...</i>

646
00:47:52,129 --> 00:47:55,879
<i>...had never made him Minister,
at least during the holidays.</i>

647
00:47:55,962 --> 00:47:59,504
<i>In three weeks,
he would have made all mankind happy.</i>

648
00:48:03,379 --> 00:48:05,087
<i>Monsieur Joseph!</i>

649
00:48:05,837 --> 00:48:09,295
Bouzigue! What are you doing here?

650
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,545
Me? I'm working, Mr. Joseph.

651
00:48:12,712 --> 00:48:16,170
I'm a canal spiker.
Thanks to you, let me tell you.

652
00:48:16,379 --> 00:48:19,170
You helped me get my diploma.

653
00:48:19,462 --> 00:48:21,462
And now, I'm a spiker.

654
00:48:21,629 --> 00:48:23,629
But what do you spike?

655
00:48:24,545 --> 00:48:27,337
Finally, I get to teach you something.

656
00:48:28,254 --> 00:48:31,462
Spiker means I keep an eye on the canal.

657
00:48:31,795 --> 00:48:33,212
With a spike?

658
00:48:33,295 --> 00:48:36,754
No! With this T- wrench...

659
00:48:37,462 --> 00:48:39,587
...and this little black book.

660
00:48:39,712 --> 00:48:42,962
The wrench opens and closes the sluices...

661
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:45,045
...to regulate the flow.

662
00:48:45,295 --> 00:48:47,754
If I see a crack in the bank...

663
00:48:47,837 --> 00:48:50,629
...or a bridge with a weak back...

664
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:54,545
...I note it in my book and
make my report later.

665
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,295
That doesn't seem too tiring.

666
00:48:57,379 --> 00:49:00,504
That's for sure.
It's not hard labor.

667
00:49:00,962 --> 00:49:02,379
Then again...

668
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:05,587
...why would I be sentenced
to hard labor?

669
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,837
- I was always good.
- Except at spelling.

670
00:49:08,962 --> 00:49:12,295
It's better now.
I do my reportings.

671
00:49:12,379 --> 00:49:13,587
Reports?

672
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:16,504
Mr. Joseph, no quibbling.

673
00:49:18,004 --> 00:49:20,295
The family's grown, I see.

674
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,087
<i>Madame Joseph isn't much bigger...</i>

675
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:25,129
...but still as charming.

676
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,587
Where are you off to with all that?

677
00:49:28,712 --> 00:49:31,129
To our house in the country.

678
00:49:32,087 --> 00:49:33,795
You've had a windfall?

679
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,920
Not exactly. But--

680
00:49:36,004 --> 00:49:38,337
Let me carry something to help you.

681
00:49:38,462 --> 00:49:41,379
That's kind of you,
but we have a long way to go.

682
00:49:41,462 --> 00:49:44,087
Surely not as far as Camoins?

683
00:49:44,212 --> 00:49:46,254
- Further.
- La Treille?

684
00:49:46,337 --> 00:49:49,795
- Les Bellons.
- Where did you leave the trolley?

685
00:49:49,879 --> 00:49:52,837
- At La Barasse.
- You poor things!

686
00:49:53,962 --> 00:49:56,920
- That's at least eight kilometers
by foot. - Nine.

687
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:59,879
- Do you come often?
- Every week.

688
00:49:59,962 --> 00:50:01,212
You poor things!

689
00:50:01,295 --> 00:50:05,129
It's a long way, but once we're there,
we don't regret it.

690
00:50:05,254 --> 00:50:07,962
I'd regret it!

691
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:11,629
I've an idea.
You won't walk so far today.

692
00:50:11,879 --> 00:50:15,712
You can come with me,
along the canal path.

693
00:50:15,795 --> 00:50:18,420
It cuts across all the estates.

694
00:50:18,795 --> 00:50:21,754
- ln 30 minutes, we'll be there.
- But--

695
00:50:21,837 --> 00:50:24,295
- Let's go. Follow me.
- Bouzigue...

696
00:50:25,295 --> 00:50:27,337
...are you sure it's legal?

697
00:50:28,754 --> 00:50:30,420
What harm could we do?

698
00:50:30,504 --> 00:50:32,795
I've met my old teacher...

699
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,629
...and I'm showing him where I work.

700
00:50:35,754 --> 00:50:37,795
You could get into trouble.

701
00:50:38,462 --> 00:50:41,087
If there's any trouble,
I'll take care of it.

702
00:50:41,295 --> 00:50:44,129
Because my sister is married...

703
00:50:45,004 --> 00:50:47,879
...so to speak,
to the General Councilor.

704
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:52,337
She had Bistagne named vice- president
of the canal.

705
00:50:52,712 --> 00:50:55,420
And if Bistagne caused me trouble...

706
00:50:56,129 --> 00:50:57,962
...she'd stifle him with a pillow.

707
00:50:59,754 --> 00:51:01,962
All right, let's go.

708
00:51:19,128 --> 00:51:20,753
Here's my canal!

709
00:51:21,587 --> 00:51:23,753
It doesn't look like much...

710
00:51:24,128 --> 00:51:27,420
...but it lets you wash lettuce
and your feet in the city.

711
00:51:28,462 --> 00:51:30,045
It's very pretty.

712
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,170
I had this little bridge redone...

713
00:51:33,795 --> 00:51:35,420
...with underwater cement.

714
00:51:35,795 --> 00:51:37,628
There's a crack here.

715
00:51:38,503 --> 00:51:39,962
- Where?
- Here.

716
00:51:42,462 --> 00:51:46,462
It's not underwater cement.
There's too much sand in it.

717
00:51:46,795 --> 00:51:49,670
- What? Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

718
00:51:50,128 --> 00:51:53,503
My father was a builder
so I know a bit about it.

719
00:51:53,837 --> 00:51:56,837
If you don't fill it, next month...

720
00:51:56,962 --> 00:51:59,045
...it'll be four fingers wide.

721
00:52:00,753 --> 00:52:02,837
I'll put that in my report.

722
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:06,420
The builder's in for a dressing down.

723
00:52:07,003 --> 00:52:08,795
Thank you, Mr. Joseph.

724
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,212
- Don't mention it.
- You've done us all a service.

725
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:12,712
My goodness.

726
00:52:13,503 --> 00:52:14,962
Here are the estates.

727
00:52:16,462 --> 00:52:18,920
The same key for all the doors.

728
00:52:20,045 --> 00:52:21,462
Very useful.

729
00:52:29,128 --> 00:52:31,795
A nobleman, a count, lives here.

730
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,795
He might not be pleased to see us here.

731
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,587
I don't like nobles very much.

732
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:38,462
People like him here.

733
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,128
Because they don't know him.

734
00:52:43,087 --> 00:52:45,462
He must have some henchmen.

735
00:52:45,628 --> 00:52:47,337
Henchmen, no.

736
00:52:47,962 --> 00:52:49,420
But he has a guard.

737
00:52:49,628 --> 00:52:52,920
A giant. I've seen him a few times...

738
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:55,670
...but he hardly ever says a word.

739
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,378
A lawyer owns this one.

740
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:08,837
He only ever comes in August.

741
00:53:08,962 --> 00:53:11,212
A farmer tends to the orchard.

742
00:53:20,962 --> 00:53:23,795
This one's the biggest
and most beautiful.

743
00:53:24,503 --> 00:53:27,920
The owner lives in Paris.
Another noble.

744
00:53:28,003 --> 00:53:29,628
A baroness, I think.

745
00:53:29,753 --> 00:53:31,587
There's no one but the keeper here.

746
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,795
Is he a friend of yours?

747
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:38,712
No, he's an ex- sergeant
and always drunk as a lord.

748
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,587
He has a stiff leg.

749
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,212
If even he sees you...

750
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:47,295
...and that's unlikely,
just run off on the double.

751
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:50,712
He couldn't catch you,
even with his dog.

752
00:53:51,837 --> 00:53:53,087
He has a dog?

753
00:53:53,212 --> 00:53:55,712
A great big thing.

754
00:53:56,045 --> 00:53:57,170
But...

755
00:53:57,295 --> 00:54:00,128
...he's 20 years old
and can hardly move.

756
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:02,878
He's called Masher.

757
00:54:04,462 --> 00:54:05,503
Masher?

758
00:54:05,628 --> 00:54:08,253
There's nothing to worry about.

759
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,878
All clear. You can come out.

760
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:27,795
But keep your heads down.

761
00:54:37,961 --> 00:54:40,586
And now, a surprise.

762
00:54:47,878 --> 00:54:49,586
It's the crossroads!

763
00:54:51,128 --> 00:54:53,253
Heavens, I don't believe it.

764
00:54:54,461 --> 00:54:58,420
In 24 minutes we've covered
distance that takes...

765
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,128
...2 hours 45 minutes.

766
00:55:02,003 --> 00:55:05,211
I told you.
This key is faster than a car.

767
00:55:05,586 --> 00:55:08,045
Now, let's have a drink.

768
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:12,128
- I'm sorry, we--
- Don't make a fuss. It's on me.

769
00:55:19,045 --> 00:55:23,170
- Do you have any Vichy water?
- I may have some in the cellar.

770
00:55:24,461 --> 00:55:25,711
Are you ill?

771
00:55:25,795 --> 00:55:28,461
No, but I like mixing...

772
00:55:28,961 --> 00:55:31,795
...white wine with
this medicinal water.

773
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,795
It makes a pleasant drink,
like champagne.

774
00:55:42,003 --> 00:55:44,461
Today I'm not at all tired.

775
00:55:45,711 --> 00:55:47,628
If only every week...

776
00:55:48,336 --> 00:55:49,670
<i>Madame Joseph...</i>

777
00:55:50,461 --> 00:55:52,753
...let me give you a present.

778
00:55:53,586 --> 00:55:54,753
Take it.

779
00:55:55,711 --> 00:55:56,836
But what for?

780
00:55:56,961 --> 00:55:59,586
To save two hours each way.

781
00:55:59,836 --> 00:56:01,503
Take it, I have another.

782
00:56:01,628 --> 00:56:03,753
- We can't.
- Why not?

783
00:56:04,128 --> 00:56:06,503
Because I, too, am a civil servant.

784
00:56:06,795 --> 00:56:08,920
The Inspector will be irate...

785
00:56:09,086 --> 00:56:11,420
...if he hears one of his teachers...

786
00:56:11,503 --> 00:56:14,586
...is trespassing with a forged key.

787
00:56:14,711 --> 00:56:16,836
It's not forged. It's the State's.

788
00:56:16,961 --> 00:56:19,003
There! We can't take it.

789
00:56:20,128 --> 00:56:24,253
No one will say anything.
You saw how it went.

790
00:56:24,461 --> 00:56:26,253
I have principles!

791
00:56:27,545 --> 00:56:29,378
Principles!

792
00:56:32,628 --> 00:56:34,795
Come on, Mr. Joseph.

793
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:36,461
What principles?

794
00:56:36,586 --> 00:56:39,295
I'd be ashamed
to sneak onto other people's property...

795
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,586
...for my own private purposes...

796
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:42,961
...and personal interests.

797
00:56:43,045 --> 00:56:46,545
It seems unworthy of a schoolmaster
who gives children a moral education.

798
00:56:46,628 --> 00:56:51,545
If he saw me sneaking though the bushes
what would he think?

799
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:53,461
That it was quicker.

800
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:56,045
He's right!

801
00:56:56,795 --> 00:56:59,211
Many people wouldn't hesitate.

802
00:56:59,586 --> 00:57:03,586
Two hours on Saturday and two
on Monday saves us four hours.

803
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:07,211
I'd rather walk four hours
and keep my self- respect.

804
00:57:08,961 --> 00:57:12,378
I know. I'll give you my canal cap.

805
00:57:12,461 --> 00:57:15,128
A canal cap on a schoolteacher's head!

806
00:57:15,378 --> 00:57:17,503
We could end up in court!

807
00:57:19,295 --> 00:57:22,086
It's a real pity to make
these boys walk...

808
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:24,628
...as if they were already
in the Foreign Legion.

809
00:57:25,336 --> 00:57:26,961
And with such a load!

810
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,461
Their legs are like spaghetti.

811
00:57:30,628 --> 00:57:33,670
And your wife is not that sturdy.

812
00:57:34,836 --> 00:57:36,420
And above all...

813
00:57:37,128 --> 00:57:38,753
...it's a pity for the canal.

814
00:57:38,878 --> 00:57:41,670
- What do you mean?
- What?

815
00:57:42,086 --> 00:57:45,503
Don't you realize,
about the cement you noticed?

816
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:48,003
It's true, Joseph.
You don't realize.

817
00:57:48,128 --> 00:57:49,711
He doesn't realize.

818
00:57:49,795 --> 00:57:52,628
The builder who used that sand...

819
00:57:52,711 --> 00:57:55,253
...will have to refund 2,000 francs.

820
00:57:55,836 --> 00:58:00,336
Maybe even 2,500.
I'm going to make my report.

821
00:58:00,503 --> 00:58:03,045
He's trapped. Thanks to whom?

822
00:58:03,211 --> 00:58:05,294
In short, you think that...

823
00:58:05,628 --> 00:58:08,419
...my covert and voluntary help...

824
00:58:08,503 --> 00:58:10,794
...would pay for our passage,
as it were?

825
00:58:10,919 --> 00:58:13,461
Ten times, a hundred times,
a thousand times.

826
00:58:13,878 --> 00:58:18,586
And on Mondays, if you give me a note,
a short report...

827
00:58:19,294 --> 00:58:23,628
...I'll copy it over,
adding a few spelling mistakes, of course...

828
00:58:23,753 --> 00:58:25,336
...and send it in to my superiors.

829
00:58:25,461 --> 00:58:28,086
Do you know how much
that would help me?

830
00:58:28,669 --> 00:58:29,961
Between you...

831
00:58:30,253 --> 00:58:33,961
...and my sister,
I'll soon be the area boss.

832
00:58:36,961 --> 00:58:38,503
Of course.

833
00:58:40,419 --> 00:58:42,336
Think before you refuse.

834
00:58:43,836 --> 00:58:47,044
- I am thinking.
- We'd save on the boys' shoes.

835
00:58:47,836 --> 00:58:49,753
Shoes, that's for sure.

836
00:58:49,836 --> 00:58:54,294
If it helps the community,
even though it's irregular...

837
00:58:54,878 --> 00:58:56,753
...and if it helps you...

838
00:58:56,961 --> 00:59:00,544
Help me?
It could change my entire career.

839
00:59:00,628 --> 00:59:04,169
I'm not quite sure.
I'll think it over.

840
00:59:08,669 --> 00:59:10,753
I don't know if I'll use it.

841
00:59:11,544 --> 00:59:12,836
We'll see.

842
00:59:16,711 --> 00:59:20,378
<i>We had a chance to use this key
the following Monday...</i>

843
00:59:20,461 --> 00:59:22,669
<i>...on our way back to the city.</i>

844
00:59:26,961 --> 00:59:29,586
Do you realize how late it is?
Hurry up!

845
00:59:29,878 --> 00:59:32,419
Joseph, you're forgetting the key.

846
00:59:32,794 --> 00:59:34,919
Not today.

847
00:59:35,003 --> 00:59:36,586
But, Dad...

848
00:59:37,211 --> 00:59:38,544
I said "no."

849
00:59:40,253 --> 00:59:42,086
We can't risk it today.

850
00:59:42,503 --> 00:59:44,711
We haven't any supplies to carry.

851
00:59:44,794 --> 00:59:48,544
Also, it's easier to go down than up.

852
00:59:51,128 --> 00:59:54,753
<i>The next Saturday,
we were facing the first door.</i>

853
01:00:03,294 --> 01:00:07,711
<i>My father was at peace with his conscience,
for he was crossing the forbidden threshold...</i>

854
01:00:07,794 --> 01:00:12,336
<i>...not to shorten a long walk,
but to preserve the precious canal from ruin...</i>

855
01:00:12,461 --> 01:00:14,794
<i>...and save Marseilles from drought.</i>

856
01:00:16,544 --> 01:00:18,586
<i>But he feared the keepers.</i>

857
01:00:18,961 --> 01:00:21,169
<i>That's why I played the scout.</i>

858
01:00:21,461 --> 01:00:22,669
Come on!

859
01:00:35,628 --> 01:00:40,586
<i>The last wall rose up
like an impregnable fortress.</i>

860
01:00:40,836 --> 01:00:43,628
<i>I felt Augustine's hand
trembling in mine.</i>

861
01:00:44,128 --> 01:00:46,961
<i>Behind it was the drunken keeper.</i>

862
01:00:47,086 --> 01:00:48,419
And his dog.

863
01:00:48,794 --> 01:00:50,586
Bouzigue said he was enormous.

864
01:00:50,669 --> 01:00:53,253
- Here, Dad.
- The kitchen knife?

865
01:00:53,419 --> 01:00:54,836
For the guard.

866
01:00:55,419 --> 01:00:59,503
If he tries to strangle you,
I'll stab him in the back.

867
01:01:00,294 --> 01:01:04,128
You're brave, but a bit too small.
Give it to me.

868
01:01:04,878 --> 01:01:07,169
You're big, stab him in the eye.

869
01:01:08,628 --> 01:01:11,419
<i>We were trembling as we crossed.</i>

870
01:01:14,878 --> 01:01:17,836
<i>Luckily we saw neither man nor beast.</i>

871
01:01:20,336 --> 01:01:23,253
<i>Our lives were changed by the key.</i>

872
01:01:25,711 --> 01:01:29,128
<i>Paul shot up like a Jack- in- the- box.</i>

873
01:01:30,044 --> 01:01:32,169
<i>Augustine's cheeks became rosy.</i>

874
01:01:32,294 --> 01:01:34,461
<i>And I stopped thinking about the exam...</i>

875
01:01:34,586 --> 01:01:37,836
<i>...which was dangerously close.</i>

876
01:01:38,252 --> 01:01:39,669
<i>As for Joseph...</i>

877
01:01:40,294 --> 01:01:43,252
"If I were a little snake

878
01:01:43,377 --> 01:01:45,752
"How happy I'd be"

879
01:01:49,002 --> 01:01:53,669
<i>His happy mood of the week
collapsed before dawn on Saturday...</i>

880
01:01:53,794 --> 01:01:57,294
<i>...as he prepared his courage...</i>

881
01:01:57,502 --> 01:02:00,086
<i>...to enter into the illegal realm.</i>

882
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:30,294
Don't be afraid, go on.

883
01:02:37,794 --> 01:02:39,627
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

884
01:02:39,752 --> 01:02:41,127
I was expecting you.

885
01:02:41,252 --> 01:02:44,919
Do I have the honor of
addressing the owner?

886
01:02:45,044 --> 01:02:46,336
You do, sir.

887
01:02:46,461 --> 01:02:49,211
- Let me explain--
- There's no need.

888
01:02:50,169 --> 01:02:53,669
For some time, in spite of
your precautions to hide yourselves...

889
01:02:54,127 --> 01:02:57,836
...I've been watching you cross my land.

890
01:02:58,461 --> 01:03:02,794
The fact is, one of my friends,
a canal spiker--

891
01:03:02,877 --> 01:03:06,336
I know.
I called him in this very morning.

892
01:03:06,461 --> 01:03:08,419
- Boutique?
- Bouzigue.

893
01:03:08,502 --> 01:03:10,961
He was my student.
I'm a public school teacher--

894
01:03:11,086 --> 01:03:13,961
I know,
Boutique told me everything.

895
01:03:14,502 --> 01:03:17,711
The house in the hills,
the short trolley ride...

896
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,461
...the long walk.

897
01:03:19,836 --> 01:03:22,044
The children and the packages.

898
01:03:24,836 --> 01:03:26,586
Indeed the little lady...

899
01:03:27,419 --> 01:03:29,794
...seems to be carrying too much.

900
01:03:31,294 --> 01:03:32,919
Will you allow me?

901
01:03:37,461 --> 01:03:38,794
<i>- Vladimir!
- Da?</i>

902
01:03:38,919 --> 01:03:41,211
Take the children's parcels.

903
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:48,961
Give and you give.

904
01:03:50,627 --> 01:03:52,336
Now climb up.

905
01:03:54,127 --> 01:03:55,461
Can l, Dad?

906
01:04:04,586 --> 01:04:06,461
Come on, don't be late.

907
01:04:06,627 --> 01:04:10,044
I don't know how to thank you,
sir. I'm touched.

908
01:04:10,169 --> 01:04:11,919
Really very touched.

909
01:04:12,044 --> 01:04:14,877
I can see.
I'm charmed by your sincerity.

910
01:04:15,086 --> 01:04:17,294
I'm not offering you much.

911
01:04:17,419 --> 01:04:21,586
You don't do any damage to my land,
I have no objections.

912
01:04:22,086 --> 01:04:24,627
There's nothing marvelous about that.

913
01:04:27,127 --> 01:04:30,461
- What is this charming little girl's name?
- Germaine.

914
01:04:31,086 --> 01:04:32,461
Hello, Germaine.

915
01:04:38,877 --> 01:04:41,294
I keep forgetting about this scar.

916
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:46,586
It was the last blow of an uhlan's saber
in Alsace 35 years ago.

917
01:04:46,711 --> 01:04:50,169
She's too young to appreciate
military valor.

918
01:04:50,627 --> 01:04:53,836
Tell her that I was scratched by a cat.

919
01:04:54,544 --> 01:04:57,836
At least it'll teach her to be cautious.

920
01:04:59,544 --> 01:05:04,335
Next time, ring in at the front gate,
and take the main drive.

921
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,252
That way is much shorter still.

922
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,710
<i>From that memorable day...</i>

923
01:05:24,835 --> 01:05:28,169
<i>...the grounds of the first property
were a weekly treat.</i>

924
01:05:51,002 --> 01:05:53,710
Do you know what these roses are called?

925
01:05:54,294 --> 01:05:57,002
They're the King's Roses.

926
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:01,002
I bred the strain myself.

927
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:05,585
Allow me to offer them to you.

928
01:06:15,502 --> 01:06:20,085
<i>Our republican family seemed ennobled
by the King's Roses.</i>

929
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,627
You there!

930
01:06:29,169 --> 01:06:30,919
Where are you going?

931
01:06:37,794 --> 01:06:42,127
Don't worry, I'm only pretending,
because the owners are watching from up there.

932
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,919
I hope the old one dies soon,
the doctor says he's ailing.

933
01:06:48,544 --> 01:06:52,127
Show me that book!
He wants your papers.

934
01:06:52,252 --> 01:06:55,752
- My name is--
- Victor Esmenard!

935
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:59,127
Address, 82 Republic Street!

936
01:06:59,627 --> 01:07:03,919
Now run off to make it look real.

937
01:07:05,294 --> 01:07:08,294
Next time, I'll use my gun!

938
01:07:09,085 --> 01:07:11,294
Next time pass on the other side,
by the tomatoes.

939
01:07:11,419 --> 01:07:13,127
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

940
01:07:18,544 --> 01:07:21,960
<i>But there was still the
estate with the dog.</i>

941
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:39,294
Augustine,
you're scared to death.

942
01:07:41,877 --> 01:07:45,835
I'm sure he already noticed
us and doesn't care.

943
01:07:47,044 --> 01:07:48,919
I'm scared.

944
01:07:49,877 --> 01:07:52,002
It may be silly,
but I'm scared.

945
01:07:52,294 --> 01:07:57,169
Why would he run after us with
his stiff leg and his sick dog?

946
01:07:57,585 --> 01:07:59,252
Please!

947
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:02,960
It's just nerves.

948
01:08:03,835 --> 01:08:05,294
I'll get over it.

949
01:08:06,794 --> 01:08:08,544
It's only nerves.

950
01:08:15,294 --> 01:08:16,752
There.

951
01:08:17,419 --> 01:08:20,169
It's over now. Let's go.

952
01:08:21,794 --> 01:08:24,794
<i>We set off and everything went well.</i>

953
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:36,293
<i>June was a month without hills.</i>

954
01:08:36,418 --> 01:08:37,335
Subjunctive.

955
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:39,043
<i>Shut in by high walls.</i>

956
01:08:39,127 --> 01:08:40,127
The potato.

957
01:08:40,252 --> 01:08:42,127
<i>This prison corridor was blocked...</i>

958
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:43,252
lsosceles.

959
01:08:43,377 --> 01:08:45,752
<i>...by a thick iron door.</i>

960
01:08:45,918 --> 01:08:46,668
I don't know.

961
01:08:47,002 --> 01:08:49,335
<i>The scholarships door.</i>

962
01:09:02,293 --> 01:09:06,168
- Even I don't understand.
- It's worthy of a higher exam.

963
01:09:06,377 --> 01:09:08,085
Please, did I pass?

964
01:09:08,543 --> 01:09:12,418
The man who wrote this
doesn't speak with children.

965
01:09:12,502 --> 01:09:15,752
In my opinion,
we can clearly discern the complex ruse...

966
01:09:15,835 --> 01:09:18,460
...and subtle treachery
of secondary school teachers.

967
01:09:18,585 --> 01:09:20,252
Congratulations...

968
01:09:20,377 --> 01:09:22,377
...for not understanding it.

969
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,668
- Did I pass?
- Of course you did.

970
01:09:26,085 --> 01:09:27,085
What did you expect?

971
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:30,002
However, there's passing and passing.

972
01:09:30,127 --> 01:09:31,585
<i>I was brilliant in all areas...</i>

973
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:35,127
<i>...but I had struggled
with a problem concerning alloys.</i>

974
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:40,210
<i>It was worded with such treachery
that I ended up coming in second.</i>

975
01:09:40,585 --> 01:09:42,752
I'd have preferred for you
to come in first...

976
01:09:42,835 --> 01:09:45,335
...but you've got a scholarship
to the lycée.

977
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:46,877
That's what matters.

978
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,543
Well done.

979
01:09:50,543 --> 01:09:53,043
<i>The little teacher was proud.</i>

980
01:09:53,127 --> 01:09:55,960
<i>He'd never set foot inside the lycée.</i>

981
01:09:56,543 --> 01:09:59,418
<i>But he was suddenly suffering
from a secret wound.</i>

982
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:04,918
"A, B, C, D."

983
01:10:07,793 --> 01:10:09,252
That's all my knowledge...

984
01:10:10,043 --> 01:10:12,752
...and I will teach it for the rest of my life.

985
01:10:13,418 --> 01:10:15,710
You may be ashamed of me one day.

986
01:10:18,085 --> 01:10:21,585
- I'm scared of losing you, tadpole.
- Why? I'm here.

987
01:10:23,127 --> 01:10:24,627
You're here now. But...

988
01:10:24,752 --> 01:10:29,627
...when the lycée teachers
make a wise man out of you...

989
01:10:30,835 --> 01:10:34,377
Then I'll come and teach
you everything I know.

990
01:10:39,627 --> 01:10:42,335
<i>Outside, the holidays
were just beginning.</i>

991
01:11:26,085 --> 01:11:28,752
You can go, it's perfectly safe.

992
01:11:29,293 --> 01:11:33,043
The Esmenard family sends
you its best wishes.

993
01:11:39,543 --> 01:11:43,085
- Joseph, I have a premonition.
- So have l.

994
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:47,627
The premonition
that we'll have a wonderful holiday.

995
01:11:58,293 --> 01:12:00,002
Hurry, he's not there.

996
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:03,626
How can you tell?
Maybe he's hiding somewhere.

997
01:12:03,751 --> 01:12:05,835
You're delirious.

998
01:12:06,001 --> 01:12:09,460
But to put your mind to rest
let's play Comanches.

999
01:12:33,585 --> 01:12:37,085
<i>We reached the last door,
the magic door...</i>

1000
01:12:37,168 --> 01:12:39,460
<i>...that would open onto the holidays.</i>

1001
01:12:39,668 --> 01:12:41,501
What about your premonition?

1002
01:12:41,626 --> 01:12:44,085
Open up quickly, please, hurry.

1003
01:12:44,418 --> 01:12:47,418
Don't get carried away.
It's all over now.

1004
01:12:52,251 --> 01:12:53,835
There's a padlock.

1005
01:12:54,293 --> 01:12:55,543
I knew it.

1006
01:12:55,876 --> 01:12:58,543
Heavens, we're prisoners here.

1007
01:12:59,585 --> 01:13:00,751
Break the chain.

1008
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:03,960
Silly boy, that's a crime.

1009
01:13:06,835 --> 01:13:08,085
A crime!

1010
01:13:09,543 --> 01:13:11,335
A crime that could...

1011
01:13:11,543 --> 01:13:14,085
...get you three months in prison.

1012
01:13:14,668 --> 01:13:16,126
Quiet, Masher.

1013
01:13:21,293 --> 01:13:22,751
What are you doing here?

1014
01:13:22,876 --> 01:13:25,501
Who gave you permission
to enter the Baron's property?

1015
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:28,460
Are you his guests or relatives?

1016
01:13:29,168 --> 01:13:31,626
- What is your name?
- Victor Esmenard!

1017
01:13:31,751 --> 01:13:34,251
Shut up. This is no time for jokes.

1018
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:35,918
Honestly.

1019
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:41,085
He's well- trained
with his false names.

1020
01:13:44,543 --> 01:13:46,085
A schoolteacher.

1021
01:13:47,751 --> 01:13:49,418
That takes the cake.

1022
01:13:49,626 --> 01:13:53,751
A schoolteacher sneaking out
onto someone else's land.

1023
01:13:54,876 --> 01:13:56,460
A schoolteacher.

1024
01:13:56,668 --> 01:13:59,501
It might not even be true.
If the kid gave me a false name...

1025
01:13:59,626 --> 01:14:01,460
...the father might give me a fake card.

1026
01:14:01,585 --> 01:14:03,251
By crossing this estate, sir...

1027
01:14:03,376 --> 01:14:05,876
...we were taking a shortcut.

1028
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:09,793
That's how it starts. First you
take a shortcut, then you take the silver.

1029
01:14:09,876 --> 01:14:14,501
Look how much we have to carry.
How tired everyone is.

1030
01:14:14,793 --> 01:14:18,168
Stop it. He doesn't want to know.

1031
01:14:18,293 --> 01:14:22,168
- Go and play with your brother.
- Stay here! I'll teach you.

1032
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:26,418
Quiet, Masher!

1033
01:14:28,376 --> 01:14:31,126
- Did you make this key?
- No.

1034
01:14:31,418 --> 01:14:33,460
This is an administrator's key.
You stole it.

1035
01:14:33,585 --> 01:14:34,918
It's easy to imagine
that I did not.

1036
01:14:35,001 --> 01:14:37,501
- Well?
- I found it.

1037
01:14:37,626 --> 01:14:41,793
Of course. You found it on the road
and realized it opened...

1038
01:14:41,918 --> 01:14:43,418
...the canal doors.

1039
01:14:44,335 --> 01:14:46,085
Who gave it to you?

1040
01:14:48,210 --> 01:14:50,251
- Who was it?
- I can't say.

1041
01:14:50,376 --> 01:14:53,668
It was clearly that
careless official...

1042
01:14:54,376 --> 01:14:55,835
...who steals my figs.

1043
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,918
You're wrong.
I know he's honest.

1044
01:14:58,293 --> 01:15:00,918
And he gave you a council key.

1045
01:15:01,043 --> 01:15:03,251
He did so for the good of the canal.

1046
01:15:03,626 --> 01:15:05,335
Masher! Quiet.

1047
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,793
I have some knowledge
of mortar and cement...

1048
01:15:07,876 --> 01:15:09,501
...which allows me to...

1049
01:15:09,626 --> 01:15:11,876
Here, take a look at
this book for yourself.

1050
01:15:14,251 --> 01:15:16,918
- You're an expert?
- In a way.

1051
01:15:17,001 --> 01:15:18,626
Are they experts, too?

1052
01:15:19,293 --> 01:15:21,210
Never seen them that young.

1053
01:15:22,168 --> 01:15:24,335
This will be useful evidence.

1054
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:27,835
- You can't!
- I can. Open these packs.

1055
01:15:28,001 --> 01:15:28,960
No!

1056
01:15:29,418 --> 01:15:31,043
They're our belongings.

1057
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:34,168
Are you refusing? I'm warning you.

1058
01:15:35,084 --> 01:15:36,793
I'm a sworn officer.

1059
01:15:45,251 --> 01:15:47,418
It looks like a market robbery!

1060
01:15:52,918 --> 01:15:54,543
- Is it loaded?
- No.

1061
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:57,209
You're lucky.

1062
01:15:59,876 --> 01:16:01,209
It's clean.

1063
01:16:01,959 --> 01:16:03,751
You're lucky again.

1064
01:16:05,459 --> 01:16:07,293
With a gun like this...

1065
01:16:07,918 --> 01:16:10,793
...you can easily miss
a partridge, but...

1066
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:13,376
...you can kill a guard.

1067
01:16:15,459 --> 01:16:17,418
An unwary guard.

1068
01:16:19,293 --> 01:16:22,418
Pack all this stuff away...

1069
01:16:22,626 --> 01:16:24,918
...and go back the way you came.

1070
01:16:25,293 --> 01:16:27,043
I'll make my report.

1071
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:32,668
I didn't know you teachers
earned so much.

1072
01:16:34,043 --> 01:16:37,584
If you're dismissed,
it's your fault, not mine.

1073
01:16:39,043 --> 01:16:40,209
Come on, Masher.

1074
01:16:44,584 --> 01:16:46,084
Dad!

1075
01:16:49,001 --> 01:16:51,084
Nice act, but it won't work.

1076
01:16:52,084 --> 01:16:53,251
Come on.

1077
01:17:01,459 --> 01:17:03,834
One is so weak when one is wrong.

1078
01:17:03,959 --> 01:17:06,084
It's not the end of the world.

1079
01:17:06,168 --> 01:17:08,418
We're on holiday...

1080
01:17:08,668 --> 01:17:10,751
...but if I lose my job next week...

1081
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:12,709
...I'll be unemployed.

1082
01:17:18,876 --> 01:17:20,876
The naked lady is broken.

1083
01:17:29,501 --> 01:17:32,334
The key! He kept the key!

1084
01:17:53,501 --> 01:17:56,793
<i>It was the first time that
I saw a thief at work...</i>

1085
01:17:56,959 --> 01:17:59,709
<i>...and this criminal was my father.</i>

1086
01:18:02,793 --> 01:18:05,001
In for a penny, in for a pound.

1087
01:18:10,668 --> 01:18:12,918
We can at least close it again.

1088
01:18:13,626 --> 01:18:15,959
<i>We went the long way around...</i>

1089
01:18:16,043 --> 01:18:20,209
<i>...and finally reached the country house
that was waiting for us in the twilight.</i>

1090
01:18:23,001 --> 01:18:24,501
You're exaggerating.

1091
01:18:24,959 --> 01:18:27,334
They won't guillotine you for it.

1092
01:18:28,126 --> 01:18:29,584
Of course not.

1093
01:18:30,626 --> 01:18:34,209
You don't know the academy's inspector.
He'll see his superior.

1094
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:37,126
I could be dismissed.

1095
01:18:37,876 --> 01:18:40,793
There's nothing to make a fuss about.

1096
01:18:42,001 --> 01:18:43,209
Perhaps.

1097
01:18:44,126 --> 01:18:45,459
Perhaps, but...

1098
01:18:46,168 --> 01:18:49,626
...it's enough to caution a teacher.

1099
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:52,543
For me...

1100
01:18:54,126 --> 01:18:56,626
...a caution is like a dismissal...

1101
01:18:57,626 --> 01:19:00,376
...for I'll resign. I will.

1102
01:19:00,959 --> 01:19:03,584
What? You'd give up your pension?

1103
01:19:08,292 --> 01:19:10,167
What would we live off?

1104
01:19:12,334 --> 01:19:14,751
I don't know, I'll think about it.

1105
01:19:19,001 --> 01:19:21,084
You could become a tutor...

1106
01:19:22,751 --> 01:19:24,834
...and give special lessons.

1107
01:19:28,126 --> 01:19:31,334
I'll have to go and see Raspagnetto.

1108
01:19:32,001 --> 01:19:33,584
The potato- seller?

1109
01:19:33,709 --> 01:19:36,667
We were together at school,
you know.

1110
01:19:37,251 --> 01:19:41,126
One day he told me,
"You were good at maths.

1111
01:19:41,501 --> 01:19:45,292
"My business has grown.
I need someone like you."

1112
01:19:45,917 --> 01:19:49,292
I'll explain everything,
he'll understand.

1113
01:19:50,292 --> 01:19:52,751
You can't always rely on friends.

1114
01:19:53,376 --> 01:19:54,834
I know, but...

1115
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:57,792
...Raspagnetto owes me a lot.

1116
01:19:59,626 --> 01:20:01,959
I gave him the answers during exams.

1117
01:20:06,584 --> 01:20:08,751
I never told you, but...

1118
01:20:11,876 --> 01:20:14,126
...I have some railway bonds...

1119
01:20:15,042 --> 01:20:16,792
...780 francs worth.

1120
01:20:17,626 --> 01:20:19,959
They're hidden in the big atlas.

1121
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:23,584
I don't believe it.

1122
01:20:24,667 --> 01:20:26,376
You kept it secret?

1123
01:20:26,959 --> 01:20:30,792
They were for emergencies.
My intentions were good.

1124
01:20:32,459 --> 01:20:34,001
Don't apologize.

1125
01:20:35,626 --> 01:20:37,417
I did the same thing.

1126
01:20:50,459 --> 01:20:52,542
But I have only 210 francs.

1127
01:20:54,209 --> 01:20:58,084
That's all I was able to save
from the money you give me every morning.

1128
01:21:09,667 --> 01:21:11,751
Dad, 780...

1129
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:14,209
...Mom, 210...

1130
01:21:14,459 --> 01:21:16,501
...that makes 990.

1131
01:21:16,876 --> 01:21:18,834
<i>l had seven francs.</i>

1132
01:21:19,001 --> 01:21:22,167
<i>Paul, despite his secretiveness,
had four.</i>

1133
01:21:22,542 --> 01:21:24,792
<i>That made 1,001 francs.</i>

1134
01:21:25,376 --> 01:21:27,001
<i>I was reassured...</i>

1135
01:21:27,126 --> 01:21:30,376
<i>...and the sandman
threw a handful of sand at me.</i>

1136
01:21:41,001 --> 01:21:42,334
Come on in.

1137
01:21:43,792 --> 01:21:46,501
- There's a gentlemen here.
- Show him in.

1138
01:21:46,626 --> 01:21:47,917
He's here.

1139
01:21:49,542 --> 01:21:51,584
Fancy that.

1140
01:21:52,084 --> 01:21:53,626
What a surprise!

1141
01:21:53,876 --> 01:21:55,792
I thought you were away.

1142
01:21:56,167 --> 01:21:58,917
Rose has taken Pierre to Roussillon.

1143
01:21:59,209 --> 01:22:01,417
Perhaps he'll get the accent.

1144
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:05,084
I'm here to tell you some news--

1145
01:22:05,167 --> 01:22:07,417
I already know your news.

1146
01:22:08,209 --> 01:22:09,334
But, how?

1147
01:22:09,834 --> 01:22:12,584
I saw the list being passed,
signed by the Director.

1148
01:22:12,876 --> 01:22:14,292
Congratulations.

1149
01:22:14,376 --> 01:22:15,751
You're mistaken.

1150
01:22:15,834 --> 01:22:18,417
Come on, don't be so modest.

1151
01:22:18,542 --> 01:22:21,792
The service medal at your
age is exceptional.

1152
01:22:22,626 --> 01:22:23,751
Bravo.

1153
01:22:26,167 --> 01:22:28,667
One is so weak, when one is wrong.

1154
01:22:38,959 --> 01:22:40,459
It's terrible.

1155
01:22:41,167 --> 01:22:44,667
An honest farmer here
killed a policeman...

1156
01:22:44,792 --> 01:22:47,084
...who was going to report him.

1157
01:22:47,334 --> 01:22:49,834
A report means dishonor and ruin.

1158
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:53,917
That guard causes
trouble for everyone.

1159
01:22:54,084 --> 01:22:58,709
He reported me to the council
for having four thrushes under my bowler.

1160
01:22:59,042 --> 01:23:01,209
They made me pay four francs.

1161
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:04,917
Well?

1162
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:08,459
Hold on!
Let me wet my whistle first.

1163
01:23:12,792 --> 01:23:16,042
I saw the guard.
He was writing his report.

1164
01:23:16,709 --> 01:23:20,125
I told him not to, he said,
"The hell I won't."

1165
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:21,792
So I said, "Why?"

1166
01:23:21,875 --> 01:23:24,667
He said,
"Teachers are always on holiday."

1167
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:27,792
So I said your father was the one
who killed the bartavelles.

1168
01:23:27,917 --> 01:23:30,625
He said,
"I really don't give a damn."

1169
01:23:30,834 --> 01:23:32,917
- So, I said--
- So you said?

1170
01:23:33,334 --> 01:23:35,417
I said nothing.

1171
01:23:35,584 --> 01:23:38,292
He kept on writing,
and I could see...

1172
01:23:38,417 --> 01:23:39,917
...he was enjoying it.

1173
01:23:40,292 --> 01:23:41,709
That guard...

1174
01:23:41,959 --> 01:23:45,417
...if ever he comes up into our hills,
he won't have to wait long...

1175
01:23:45,542 --> 01:23:47,667
...for the bullets he deserves!

1176
01:23:52,792 --> 01:23:55,542
They won't sack you with
a service medal.

1177
01:23:57,792 --> 01:23:59,042
They can.

1178
01:24:01,459 --> 01:24:03,667
You can always cancel
the promotion...

1179
01:24:04,125 --> 01:24:06,625
...of a civil servant who is at fault.

1180
01:24:08,875 --> 01:24:10,709
You should become a farmer.

1181
01:24:10,792 --> 01:24:12,209
What an idea.

1182
01:24:12,292 --> 01:24:16,875
- He needs a new profession.
- But a job like that, I couldn't.

1183
01:24:17,125 --> 01:24:20,375
No need to be an expert,
things grow by themselves.

1184
01:24:21,125 --> 01:24:22,625
Chickpeas, for example.

1185
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:25,584
They don't need water or dung...

1186
01:24:25,959 --> 01:24:27,584
...or even earth.

1187
01:24:27,959 --> 01:24:30,250
- Or the runner bean.
- Runner?

1188
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,250
It's in a hurry, see?

1189
01:24:33,459 --> 01:24:34,959
You make a tiny hole...

1190
01:24:35,084 --> 01:24:38,459
...and place the bean on the bottom,
cover it with earth...

1191
01:24:38,542 --> 01:24:41,250
...and you run off quickly
before it catches you!

1192
01:24:42,459 --> 01:24:46,125
Of course, that's a bit far- fetched,
but it does grow fast.

1193
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:51,334
I'm going for a nap.

1194
01:24:52,667 --> 01:24:54,709
- What about Bouzigue?
- He was out.

1195
01:24:54,792 --> 01:24:56,667
- Aren't you going to eat?
- No, nothing.

1196
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:23,667
<i>Monsieur Joseph!</i>

1197
01:25:29,459 --> 01:25:30,959
Bouzigue!

1198
01:25:40,125 --> 01:25:41,875
Here. This is yours.

1199
01:25:41,959 --> 01:25:43,334
My notebook.

1200
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,084
He gave it to you?

1201
01:25:46,167 --> 01:25:49,917
Not exactly.

1202
01:25:50,292 --> 01:25:53,084
When I got your note this morning...

1203
01:25:54,042 --> 01:25:55,875
...I fetched reinforcements.

1204
01:25:55,959 --> 01:25:58,459
Binucci, a canal spiker like me.

1205
01:25:58,667 --> 01:26:00,417
Pleased to meet you.

1206
01:26:00,625 --> 01:26:02,792
And Fenestrelle, a turncock.

1207
01:26:09,042 --> 01:26:10,583
Make a report.

1208
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:12,417
"It is positively forbidden...

1209
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:15,458
"...to hinder the use of canal doors."

1210
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:17,625
Article 82 of the rules.

1211
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:20,542
- A report on me?
- Your name, place and date of birth.

1212
01:26:20,625 --> 01:26:23,208
- You're not serious?
- Are you refusing?

1213
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:26,333
Careful, the law is on my side.

1214
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:30,083
A report? On me?

1215
01:26:31,458 --> 01:26:32,542
Wait!

1216
01:26:34,208 --> 01:26:36,125
That padlock wasn't for you.

1217
01:26:37,833 --> 01:26:41,250
It was to trap people
crossing the estate...

1218
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,292
...with a forged key.

1219
01:26:44,458 --> 01:26:46,667
A forged key?
You hear that, Binucci?

1220
01:26:46,792 --> 01:26:48,917
- A forged key.
- Is that all you found?

1221
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,208
The proof. Here it is.

1222
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:56,750
Evidence. Do you have more proof?

1223
01:26:58,792 --> 01:27:01,125
I took this from their leader...

1224
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:02,667
...a teacher.

1225
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:04,167
Evidence!

1226
01:27:06,208 --> 01:27:09,417
And my report to the administration.

1227
01:27:09,542 --> 01:27:10,917
Confiscated.

1228
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,750
Then there's my own report...

1229
01:27:15,625 --> 01:27:16,958
Confiscated!

1230
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,083
The padlock key?

1231
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,250
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

1232
01:27:26,292 --> 01:27:28,083
At your service, gentlemen.

1233
01:27:35,958 --> 01:27:39,042
- It's all in order, isn't it?
- Oh, you poor soul!

1234
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:43,292
You've confessed in
an official report.

1235
01:27:43,667 --> 01:27:44,625
What?

1236
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:48,792
You admit that you put a lock and chain
on one of the administration doors.

1237
01:27:50,292 --> 01:27:52,083
What are you going to do?

1238
01:27:53,875 --> 01:27:55,333
Quiet!

1239
01:27:57,583 --> 01:27:59,542
He's in a bit of a state.

1240
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:03,083
- Perhaps we could--
- The rules are the rules.

1241
01:28:05,958 --> 01:28:07,708
Unless we...

1242
01:28:08,625 --> 01:28:12,083
We'd have to destroy the evidence.

1243
01:28:12,458 --> 01:28:15,042
But I can't take that responsibility.

1244
01:28:17,208 --> 01:28:18,375
I can.

1245
01:28:18,542 --> 01:28:20,250
To keep your cap...

1246
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:23,667
...jump to it! Tear it all up!

1247
01:28:24,667 --> 01:28:25,833
Do it!

1248
01:28:26,958 --> 01:28:28,958
There, I've done it.

1249
01:28:29,042 --> 01:28:31,583
Tear it into confetti. Smaller.

1250
01:28:31,667 --> 01:28:34,375
- Like this?
- Smaller.

1251
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:35,583
Wait!

1252
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:41,417
That way,
the guard will be well kept.

1253
01:28:42,958 --> 01:28:44,000
Masher!

1254
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:46,750
Catch!

1255
01:28:51,042 --> 01:28:52,458
Give, Masher.

1256
01:28:56,833 --> 01:28:57,917
Quiet.

1257
01:29:00,208 --> 01:29:01,958
Good boy, give it to me.

1258
01:29:11,083 --> 01:29:12,750
It's all over now.

1259
01:29:13,167 --> 01:29:15,667
But you'd better not
go that way again.

1260
01:29:15,792 --> 01:29:17,875
Even if we were to
be given permission...

1261
01:29:17,958 --> 01:29:20,458
...I'd never have the courage
to go that way again.

1262
01:29:20,583 --> 01:29:22,667
- l think I'd faint.
- Dad.

1263
01:29:23,292 --> 01:29:26,125
Don't worry, we'll come by carriage.

1264
01:29:26,208 --> 01:29:29,375
- Like Uncle Jules?
- Like Uncle Jules.

1265
01:29:30,542 --> 01:29:32,500
Did you win the lottery?

1266
01:29:33,041 --> 01:29:35,416
Joseph has won the service medal.

1267
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:40,791
He's been promoted
with an extra 22 francs a month.

1268
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:23,250
Go and get Uncle Jules' bottles.

1269
01:30:28,041 --> 01:30:29,625
<i>But, Monsieur Joseph...</i>

1270
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:32,375
...wine is still the
least harmful drink.

1271
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:35,291
Here, you drink cistern water.

1272
01:30:35,458 --> 01:30:37,416
Do you know what's in it?

1273
01:30:37,541 --> 01:30:38,958
Water from the sky.

1274
01:30:40,291 --> 01:30:42,833
Water distilled by the sun.

1275
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:47,791
I bet there's also
a dozen black spiders in there, too.

1276
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,666
Two or three lizards...

1277
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:51,916
...and a whole family of toads.

1278
01:30:53,375 --> 01:30:54,916
Cistern water...

1279
01:30:55,875 --> 01:30:58,458
...is just concentrated toad- piss.

1280
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:03,458
But that alcohol, for your health...

1281
01:31:10,458 --> 01:31:11,958
You kill me!

1282
01:31:18,541 --> 01:31:19,958
<i>Time passes...</i>

1283
01:31:20,125 --> 01:31:23,250
<i>...and makes life's wheel
turn like that of a windmill.</i>

1284
01:31:30,958 --> 01:31:32,625
<i>Five years later...</i>

1285
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:41,250
<i>...I walked behind a black carriage
that was so high...</i>

1286
01:31:41,333 --> 01:31:43,916
<i>...that I could see the horses' shoes.</i>

1287
01:31:44,625 --> 01:31:49,208
<i>I wore black, and Paul's hand
gripped mine with all its might.</i>

1288
01:31:49,791 --> 01:31:52,083
<i>Our mother was being borne away.</i>

1289
01:31:59,458 --> 01:32:01,833
<i>For years after, until manhood...</i>

1290
01:32:02,125 --> 01:32:04,750
<i>...we didn't dare speak of her.</i>

1291
01:32:09,333 --> 01:32:11,416
<i>Then, little Paul grew tall.</i>

1292
01:32:11,875 --> 01:32:13,666
<i>He had a silky beard.</i>

1293
01:32:14,458 --> 01:32:17,083
<i>He never wanted to leave
the Etoile Hills...</i>

1294
01:32:17,166 --> 01:32:19,000
<i>...where he kept a herd of goats.</i>

1295
01:32:19,583 --> 01:32:22,250
<i>He was the last of Virgil's goatherds...</i>

1296
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:25,041
<i>...but at 30, death carried him off.</i>

1297
01:32:30,041 --> 01:32:33,625
<i>My dear Lili had been waiting
for years in the graveyard...</i>

1298
01:32:33,875 --> 01:32:35,916
<i>...under a blanket of flowers.</i>

1299
01:32:36,125 --> 01:32:38,958
<i>In 1917, in a dark northern forest...</i>

1300
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:41,916
<i>...a bullet cut short his young life.</i>

1301
01:32:42,166 --> 01:32:44,833
<i>He fell on some chilly plants...</i>

1302
01:32:45,041 --> 01:32:47,250
<i>...whose names he didn't know.</i>

1303
01:32:55,916 --> 01:32:57,916
<i>Such is the life of a man.</i>

1304
01:32:59,583 --> 01:33:03,249
<i>Moments of joy, obliterated
by unforgettable sadness.</i>

1305
01:33:06,166 --> 01:33:08,958
<i>There's no need to
tell the children that.</i>

1306
01:33:24,833 --> 01:33:26,291
There she is.

1307
01:33:27,833 --> 01:33:29,041
See her?

1308
01:33:29,208 --> 01:33:30,708
Have you seen?

1309
01:33:31,083 --> 01:33:32,749
Pomponette's back.

1310
01:33:34,333 --> 01:33:36,749
The hussy, the minx...

1311
01:33:36,999 --> 01:33:40,166
<i>Ten years later,
I founded a little film company.</i>

1312
01:33:41,291 --> 01:33:43,624
<i>The venture met with success.</i>

1313
01:33:47,666 --> 01:33:51,166
<i>I planned to build
under the Provence sky...</i>

1314
01:33:51,291 --> 01:33:52,916
<i>...a cinema city.</i>

1315
01:33:53,249 --> 01:33:57,416
<i>My solicitor started looking for
an estate to house this project.</i>

1316
01:33:57,958 --> 01:34:00,749
<i>He found something while
I was in Paris...</i>

1317
01:34:01,208 --> 01:34:04,166
<i>...and called me to
announce the news.</i>

1318
01:34:04,749 --> 01:34:07,874
<i>He was most enthusiastic
and I knew it was honest.</i>

1319
01:34:07,958 --> 01:34:10,083
<i>l bought it without seeing it.</i>

1320
01:34:16,791 --> 01:34:21,624
<i>A week later, we set off
to take possession of the promised land.</i>

1321
01:34:25,249 --> 01:34:26,916
<i>It wasn't a historical castle...</i>

1322
01:34:26,999 --> 01:34:30,333
<i>...but some Second Empire
bourgeois residence.</i>

1323
01:34:36,791 --> 01:34:40,666
<i>I surveyed my great enterprise...</i>

1324
01:34:40,999 --> 01:34:44,624
<i>...when I saw a row of
shrubs in the distance.</i>

1325
01:34:46,708 --> 01:34:50,916
<i>I gasped, and without knowing why,
I dashed across the meadow...</i>

1326
01:34:51,041 --> 01:34:52,958
<i>...and back through the years.</i>

1327
01:34:58,541 --> 01:35:02,749
<i>Only when I saw it over the hedge,
did I recognize it.</i>

1328
01:35:03,416 --> 01:35:05,249
<i>The castle of fear...</i>

1329
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:07,208
<i>...of my mother's fear.</i>

1330
01:35:10,541 --> 01:35:12,166
<i>Yes, it was there.</i>

1331
01:35:12,458 --> 01:35:14,583
<i>It was the canal of my past.</i>

1332
01:35:15,333 --> 01:35:18,541
<i>I walked back along the holiday path...</i>

1333
01:35:18,833 --> 01:35:22,291
<i>...and beloved shadows of the past
were at my side.</i>

1334
01:35:23,749 --> 01:35:25,958
<i>In the wall, near the canal...</i>

1335
01:35:26,083 --> 01:35:27,833
<i>...was the black door...</i>

1336
01:35:27,958 --> 01:35:30,124
<i>...the one that refused to open...</i>

1337
01:35:30,999 --> 01:35:33,208
<i>...and humiliated my father.</i>

1338
01:35:35,291 --> 01:35:37,416
<i>I was breathing more easily,
it seemed...</i>

1339
01:35:38,124 --> 01:35:40,249
<i>...and the evil spell had been broken.</i>

1340
01:35:41,166 --> 01:35:42,958
<i>On the other side of time...</i>

1341
01:35:44,458 --> 01:35:49,374
<i>...for years now, a young, dark- haired
woman had been clutching...</i>

1342
01:35:49,624 --> 01:35:51,874
<i>...the King's Roses to her fragile heart.</i>

1343
01:35:53,083 --> 01:35:56,708
<i>She heard the guard's shouts
and the dog's wheezing.</i>

1344
01:35:57,583 --> 01:36:01,791
<i>Pallid, trembling.
Forever inconsolable.</i>

1345
01:36:02,374 --> 01:36:05,083
<i>She didn't know it was
her son's estate.</i>

1346
01:36:22,791 --> 01:36:27,666
MY MOTHER'S CASTLE
