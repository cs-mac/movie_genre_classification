1
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:42,007
Everybody out.
Get your ammunition

2
00:00:42,174 --> 00:00:43,384
Hurry and you.

3
00:00:50,516 --> 00:00:52,434
Casper ... Come with me.

4
00:01:05,781 --> 00:01:07,700
They are looking for 
rofessionals in Africa.

5
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:09,285
What, bitches?

6
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:11,704
No, mercenaries, Sgt.

7
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:13,706
Mexico, and LATIN
AMERICA as well.

8
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:16,667
$ 1300 per month,
plus transport.

9
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:19,128
They want real soldiers, Casper,

10
00:01:19,336 --> 00:01:20,212
not typists.

11
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:22,840
I was told to come to the report, Sgt.
I'm Hardin.

12
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:26,677
Charles Hardin infantryman. Cpl.

13
00:01:27,344 --> 00:01:28,762
You have o Charlie?

14
00:01:29,263 --> 00:01:30,347
El Paso.

15
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:34,518
Really?
you have flat, the Louisiana
National Guard?

16
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:35,603
Not ...

17
00:01:36,145 --> 00:01:38,647
But I liked not the Texas Guard.

18
00:01:39,064 --> 00:01:40,524
Not like the Guard in Texas

19
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:41,817
was understandable.

20
00:01:41,984 --> 00:01:45,196
But not like the Guard of Louisiana
can get you into trouble.

21
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:46,655
Pig?

22
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:48,073
Pig.

23
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:52,328
You'll be in the 2nd squad.
In recognition.

24
00:01:52,494 --> 00:01:57,041
Casper, show him the path.
Presents it to others.

25
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:15,017
Cease fire!

26
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,523
We were still gts.

27
00:02:20,814 --> 00:02:23,859
you will have the year, Simms.
A little muscle in the pants.

28
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:26,070
I really do not need a coach.

29
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:28,322
Unless a t'intresse.

30
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:33,160
Listen, Stuckey, I'll fold it in
half, you will make a same-you.

31
00:02:38,707 --> 00:02:42,127
I like to laugh, but
it has not drle.

32
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,214
I'm with you, coach.

33
00:02:46,048 --> 00:02:47,633
I like women.

34
00:02:48,676 --> 00:02:50,427
We will not see the masses.

35
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:52,513
Life is full of surprises.

36
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:54,306
What do you mean?

37
00:02:54,723 --> 00:02:57,017
I prvu fte a little, guys.

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,854
Six whores shock, borrowed
"for the assault.

39
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:03,941
They kiss us better than the
Louisiana National Guard.

40
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:05,818
DCON not you?

41
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,152
Not about women.

42
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,404
Women? Which women?

43
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:10,823
He has broads ahead, coach.

44
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:12,950
Prostitutes?

45
00:03:13,117 --> 00:03:14,493
Exactly.

46
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:18,831
You've never fallen
so low, Spencer.

47
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:23,002
We have an appointment

48
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,628
just out of Catahoula.

49
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:26,964
They will be the merger of ...
when we

50
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:28,674
Great Swamp paramount.

51
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:29,925
You have one for me?

52
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:30,759
Me?

53
00:03:30,926 --> 00:03:33,095
You mean we, my brother?
And then!

54
00:03:33,345 --> 00:03:34,054
My guys

55
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:38,475
purpose of the Guard is prserver
ladies you, brothers of color.

56
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,855
Nevertheless have, in the
spirit of the New South

57
00:03:43,272 --> 00:03:44,857
I have everything
Pipelines Limited.

58
00:03:45,232 --> 00:03:46,442
And you, Hardin?

59
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:51,071
I am a husband.
Do not count on me.

60
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:54,867
The military must be
more srieux El Paso.

61
00:03:55,242 --> 00:03:58,871
It's more organized.
We watch the baseball tl

62
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:01,123
ds we play, and sleep.

63
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,292
Guard in Louisiana is
quite Different.

64
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:05,794
We did things that really matter

65
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:08,214
beat up students, gassed nGRE.

66
00:04:08,964 --> 00:04:11,926
If you flat, Mr.
Guard, more grenades!

67
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:13,928
Do not lchez your dogs on me!

68
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:18,766
You see?
We have a long and proud
military tradition.

69
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:20,309
Casper?

70
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:28,692
Stopped,

71
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:31,904
Behave like a soldier,
espce of bastard!

72
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:43,123
In life, you have a real job,
or you're just like them?

73
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,168
I work for Petramco, engineer
for a chemist.

74
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,671
You are all the Universe ...

75
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,966
Plutt is rare in Texas, right?

76
00:04:52,716 --> 00:04:55,094
has come from time to time.

77
00:04:56,303 --> 00:05:00,933
One might think that you do not like
chatting with your friends.

78
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,560
You want to know? You're right.

79
00:05:02,893 --> 00:05:05,062
I can not say I bugging you.

80
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:09,316
Reece believes he lives
in a soap opera.

81
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:13,445
Stuckey, it is not even smart
enough to read one.

82
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:15,072
As for the coach ...

83
00:05:15,406 --> 00:05:16,949
I think I know the type.

84
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,286
These are good guys.

85
00:05:20,744 --> 00:05:23,247
They just want to laugh.
You are the new ...

86
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:25,040
These are not good guys.

87
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:30,045
It's the same version of Louisiana
pquenots I've always known.

88
00:05:37,178 --> 00:05:40,222
When i was Fort Polk,
the coach was bitten

89
00:05:40,764 --> 00:05:42,975
by a coral snake.

90
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:46,645
He put his hand on a tarpaulin,
and a section of a machete.

91
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:47,980
Cut net!

92
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:50,024
What bullshit!

93
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:51,692
You DCON, Stuckey!

94
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:55,112
I swear it's true!
I do not give fuck

95
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,363
Do you believe me or not.

96
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,534
For those that have INTERESTED,
we go on night patrol.

97
00:06:01,202 --> 00:06:02,703
Shut up and open them well.

98
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,955
Our code-named Bravo.

99
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:08,584
The Bravo team.
Recognition and security.

100
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,088
Rendezvous Point Charlie.
Just out of Catahoula.

101
00:06:13,422 --> 00:06:15,424
We will move forward in column

102
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:18,344
by noting the minimum.

103
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:22,139
And we must act quickly: no
tents, no sleeping bags.

104
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:24,183
Just the ponchos.

105
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,852
The MTO will be very variable.

106
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,355
Sun, rain, cold in the morning.

107
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:31,774
Get this idea. You go the fleet.

108
00:06:32,316 --> 00:06:33,901
And it will be ice.

109
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:34,818
Cribbs!

110
00:06:35,277 --> 00:06:36,445
You your with us?

111
00:06:37,446 --> 00:06:39,949
Sr Sgt. I'm leaving.

112
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,451
has is great, you stay the rear.

113
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,455
Reece, you will head.

114
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:50,501
It is about 38 km,

115
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:53,796
fill your water bottles,
the tank.

116
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:56,090
Every man does his job.

117
00:06:56,257 --> 00:06:59,844
I want no fights.
You all your friends.

118
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:02,680
You dpendez each other.

119
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:04,932
Everyone does his job.

120
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:09,186
For once in your life, have
the air of soldiers.

121
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:11,689
Civil peace. Soldier at war.

122
00:07:12,022 --> 00:07:14,108
I am a Guard.

123
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:16,735
It's a. Tchez to remember it.

124
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,085
PROMOTION
- DISTRIBUTION A. M FILMS 1983

125
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,764
NO RETURN

126
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,548
They seem to have an ocean here.

127
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:07,758
There should be specific
on this point.

128
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:13,097
Or this map is wrong, or
I lost the compass.

129
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:40,624
Ad the river out of bed
with the winter rains.

130
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,459
The land is flooded.

131
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:43,669
Call the company?

132
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,672
No, useless. It's very simple.

133
00:11:47,298 --> 00:11:50,009
Either can be crossed by l. ..

134
00:11:50,718 --> 00:11:52,219
but presents itself evil,

135
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:55,306
or we will return zero
and start again.

136
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:31,592
Someone you Bambi.

137
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:37,515
Who are these boats?

138
00:12:37,681 --> 00:12:38,474
To us.

139
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:41,894
They belong to the local population,
and not with DCON!

140
00:12:42,436 --> 00:12:43,729
a fleet?

141
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:47,983
And how! It canoes.
Cajuns use it all the time.

142
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,778
For now, they use it.

143
00:12:55,282 --> 00:12:57,076
If we took them down
to the bayou?

144
00:12:57,284 --> 00:13:00,246
I'm for. I hurt the back.

145
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,791
It would Catahoula tonight.
And women, under martial law.

146
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,334
From what women tell you?

147
00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:07,920
Spencer maze of good women.

148
00:13:08,796 --> 00:13:10,881
He has girlfriends
that lie ahead.

149
00:13:12,383 --> 00:13:13,050
Everything is ready.

150
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,761
"Noleen and queens
of the bayou."

151
00:13:16,136 --> 00:13:17,555
Good for morale.

152
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:18,889
Really?

153
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:19,849
And I might add, Sergeant,

154
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:24,520
that these women rely on ...
pntration a member.

155
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:30,359
Do not take these canoes.
They are not us.

156
00:13:31,735 --> 00:13:33,779
That's right, they
are not us ...

157
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,615
Jump in and barons us.

158
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:39,076
Minute, Mongolian!

159
00:13:39,243 --> 00:13:40,536
Nobody has given the order.

160
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,746
But how are we going?

161
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:46,167
You may be right, Reece.

162
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,586
And how! Let's go.

163
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:50,963
One minute, Reece.

164
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:55,134
How will the owner rcuprer
their boats?

165
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,388
II do we need three.
They will use the others.

166
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:02,641
A shot, it's pleasant.
Catahoula, here we come!

167
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:04,059
What say you, Sergeant?

168
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,949
Bowden, leave them a word.

169
00:14:31,545 --> 00:14:36,091
Take off your helmets.
Put the belt. Nerve!

170
00:14:40,387 --> 00:14:42,723
In boats, and have the
air of soldiers!

171
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:04,972
Here they are.
Canoes must be them.

172
00:16:08,517 --> 00:16:09,852
You the earth!

173
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:11,645
Read on!

174
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:14,190
You left a note.

175
00:16:14,982 --> 00:16:16,400
Dirty gooks.

176
00:16:17,985 --> 00:16:19,153
They understand it.

177
00:16:20,321 --> 00:16:21,739
J'espre they find my word.

178
00:16:22,323 --> 00:16:23,782
May be that they only
speak francs.

179
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,285
Does anyone speak French?

180
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:32,875
Reece, arrtez of a dick!

181
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:34,960
They Ramna!

182
00:16:37,338 --> 00:16:38,130
No quarter!

183
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,018
Espce con!

184
00:16:51,894 --> 00:16:55,189
Casper!
Bring your boat down the.

185
00:18:04,175 --> 00:18:04,967
- Take shelter.
- They have you!

186
00:18:06,677 --> 00:18:07,678
Hide yourself!

187
00:18:07,845 --> 00:18:09,263
Spencer, over here!

188
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,643
Good God, what happens?

189
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:16,937
Are they still derive?

190
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:18,772
I know. I see them.

191
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:24,069
Stash now!
It should fetch Poole.

192
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,947
C'mon you. Me, I'll catch up.

193
00:19:46,193 --> 00:19:47,403
No trace.

194
00:19:49,196 --> 00:19:51,198
O is the dirt map?

195
00:19:51,365 --> 00:19:52,366
He had hand

196
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:53,617
I remember.

197
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,745
The compass is gone.

198
00:19:56,912 --> 00:19:58,038
How it happened?

199
00:19:58,372 --> 00:20:00,207
In the fleet, what do you think?

200
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:03,961
And guess who put the?

201
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:05,796
True, Bowden.

202
00:20:05,963 --> 00:20:07,464
Why hast thou renverss?

203
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,342
I have not spilled the canoes.
It was you who starts.

204
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:13,596
What are you talking about?
You panic, asshole.

205
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,848
I'll show you panic, jerk!

206
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:20,769
I did not panic, little shit!

207
00:20:32,406 --> 00:20:33,991
What is mean!

208
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,202
We are all soldiers!

209
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,787
Both of you, shake your hand.

210
00:20:46,003 --> 00:20:47,338
Good.

211
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:49,507
Simms, where is your radio?

212
00:20:49,673 --> 00:20:51,467
In water, what do you think?

213
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:55,054
It is you who are responsible.
What are you doing!

214
00:20:57,306 --> 00:21:00,017
It was dead here.
What we gonna do?

215
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:02,019
Let's get those who have
descended RP Poole.

216
00:21:02,186 --> 00:21:04,271
It's me who is going
o DCID and when.

217
00:21:04,688 --> 00:21:06,065
Magnon us.

218
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:07,691
And Sergeant Poole?

219
00:21:07,858 --> 00:21:09,985
Allowed, unless you
want to wear it.

220
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:11,779
He's a soldier amricain!

221
00:21:11,987 --> 00:21:15,157
He has a web of bronze, a Purple
Heart, a mdaille Vietnam.

222
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:16,575
We will not leave!

223
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:19,495
The sooner we shoot, the
faster they will get it.

224
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,456
We will complete this mission.
It is our responsibility.

225
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:24,416
Come, Casper. Here we go.

226
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,544
No, hell, we will not leave.

227
00:21:27,711 --> 00:21:28,712
- Who told?
- Me.

228
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:33,175
It is I who command ...
And I want more discussion.

229
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:35,803
We leave.

230
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:02,037
Stuckey, you really made the
con, with your machine gun.

231
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,374
Nobody told you to shoot.

232
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,960
C'tait just for fun.

233
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:09,128
White balls.

234
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,588
Forget it.

235
00:22:10,754 --> 00:22:13,299
Forget ... Damn!

236
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,759
This DBIL killed someone
and tell you to forget.

237
00:22:16,218 --> 00:22:19,597
Remember one thing.
Stuckey is not that you Poole.

238
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:22,308
The thing is, when we
have ramen Poole

239
00:22:22,516 --> 00:22:24,685
we will return to the Cajuns do.

240
00:22:24,852 --> 00:22:28,189
You bet.
We did that swim 200 meters,

241
00:22:28,355 --> 00:22:30,065
and end up in the box.

242
00:22:30,232 --> 00:22:33,569
Then they catch it and shoot
them with our white balls.

243
00:22:43,913 --> 00:22:45,206
So your opinion?

244
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,750
This bayou is going east.

245
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:49,919
The easiest way is to follow.

246
00:22:50,085 --> 00:22:52,087
We want to go north.
The highway is to the north.

247
00:22:52,254 --> 00:22:53,130
We're heading for the highway.

248
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:54,840
Not from the East.
The highway is to the north.

249
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:57,051
Will it bring you, Spencer.
What do you know?

250
00:22:57,218 --> 00:23:00,721
There is a fireball in the sky that
rises up the East, and here we go.

251
00:23:00,888 --> 00:23:02,389
We must go east to go north.

252
00:23:02,556 --> 00:23:03,224
He's right.

253
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,976
Can rpter for me?
Need to go o go o?

254
00:23:06,143 --> 00:23:09,104
Someone wants to see where
we go, and quickly!

255
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:10,814
Hardin, shut up!

256
00:23:10,981 --> 00:23:13,067
It's my responsibility, we
will go east to the north.

257
00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:14,818
Do what you want!

258
00:23:14,985 --> 00:23:17,071
That's exactly what
I'd do, Spencer!

259
00:24:14,044 --> 00:24:15,296
Turkey.

260
00:24:15,838 --> 00:24:19,550
Turkey meat, turkey skin,
crackers, turkey fat,

261
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:20,885
salt!

262
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,897
The fags have good resists!

263
00:24:33,898 --> 00:24:36,400
I saved a bundle.
Not bad, right?

264
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,114
Perhaps we should be
very rpart bullets.

265
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:43,240
What balls?

266
00:24:43,407 --> 00:24:44,450
Reece ammunition.

267
00:24:45,075 --> 00:24:47,828
It always brings on a case where
he would find the big game.

268
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,831
At camp, he showed us

269
00:24:50,998 --> 00:24:52,249
a box of 556.

270
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:55,878
What is it,

271
00:24:57,004 --> 00:24:58,714
a military secret or something?

272
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:00,090
No way.

273
00:25:01,008 --> 00:25:03,969
I brought a box for
my personal use.

274
00:25:04,428 --> 00:25:08,432
And I'm loaded, in cases where there
is manure that you Poole.

275
00:25:08,682 --> 00:25:09,892
Give me your weapon, Reece.

276
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:12,269
O you remain who you are.

277
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:15,564
Give me ammunition.
We will be the rpart.

278
00:25:16,065 --> 00:25:16,732
We'll share them.

279
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:18,150
Bugger!

280
00:25:18,609 --> 00:25:20,444
They are me and that's it.

281
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:21,820
It is not normal, Reece.

282
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,657
Give him the ball.
It is the weapon here.

283
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,617
I give an order, Reece.

284
00:25:28,077 --> 00:25:29,078
Give them to me.

285
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:33,290
Approach again and I'll give
you something else.

286
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,001
You are liable to the
Court Martial.

287
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,214
Give me the ammunition and
we do not talk anymore.

288
00:25:40,464 --> 00:25:41,382
Otherwise,

289
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:42,508
I do not care it.

290
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:44,510
I do not give fuck.

291
00:25:45,886 --> 00:25:48,055
Shall adopt the DCON and
give him your gun.

292
00:25:49,723 --> 00:25:50,766
Immediately.

293
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,455
I'll give Hardin.

294
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:26,260
Your ammunition.

295
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:33,142
The knife to her throat, huh?

296
00:26:35,477 --> 00:26:37,521
It's like we're doing
has El Paso?

297
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,151
It's like we had been the No.
I grew up.

298
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,154
I thought you engineer
for a chemist.

299
00:26:45,988 --> 00:26:49,825
Yes.
And I'm used to trans with excitations
of the trigger.

300
00:26:52,161 --> 00:26:56,290
In Louisiana, if not guns,
it's the strings.

301
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,796
It is not very smart ...
but we have fun.

302
00:27:17,853 --> 00:27:19,146
What are you doing, Cribbs?

303
00:27:20,022 --> 00:27:22,525
I'm on duty. You want a puff?

304
00:27:22,983 --> 00:27:24,443
How can you smoke this crap?

305
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,737
I'm not in your team, coach.

306
00:27:26,904 --> 00:27:30,533
You're right! You could not.
to kill the will.

307
00:27:30,741 --> 00:27:32,117
How the guys market this year?

308
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:37,122
C'tait a transition year.
Top taient blesss.

309
00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:41,085
What do you live?

310
00:27:41,502 --> 00:27:42,962
I have two or three toeing,

311
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:46,590
but mostly I sell
the same grass.

312
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:49,552
You're lucky I do
not believe you.

313
00:27:49,718 --> 00:27:50,636
It's true!

314
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:54,849
My best customers are the school,
and they have ten years.

315
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,894
I want to listen his bullshit.

316
00:28:04,024 --> 00:28:07,528
When do we return the El
Paso kicked in the ass?

317
00:28:09,572 --> 00:28:12,074
Ds that will be the
meeting point.

318
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:16,620
Then come back to look who
had the gooks Poole.

319
00:28:22,084 --> 00:28:24,211
You think everything
is my fault?

320
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:27,590
Do not worry.

321
00:28:28,632 --> 00:28:29,842
Done.

322
00:28:34,972 --> 00:28:38,559
How you can play cards with
Sergeant Poole ct?

323
00:28:39,226 --> 00:28:41,103
You have another idea?

324
00:28:42,313 --> 00:28:43,731
I find it has not.

325
00:28:44,315 --> 00:28:45,941
Poole does not care. He died.

326
00:28:46,567 --> 00:28:48,319
I do not see what we
can do for him.

327
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:49,987
Why not play cards?

328
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:53,782
I find it has not.

329
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,001
It's here.

330
00:29:19,266 --> 00:29:21,519
Spencer, and Command?

331
00:29:21,685 --> 00:29:23,395
They think we should,
do not you think?

332
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:24,438
No, not yet.

333
00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:26,732
We lost contact for
over 12 hours.

334
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:28,609
They should already
be our research.

335
00:29:28,776 --> 00:29:31,320
Impossible.
That the National Guard!

336
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:33,614
We had to meet the truck
20 minutes ago.

337
00:29:33,781 --> 00:29:36,200
In 1 hour 30, they will
point to good.

338
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:38,953
At 2 pm, they will
ask if you saw us.

339
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:40,871
At 3 pm, they will see in bars.

340
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:42,873
At 4 pm, they will butter.

341
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,292
At 5 pm, they will come to the
idea that might be lost.

342
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:47,211
At 6 pm, Captain DCID to
call the battalion.

343
00:29:47,378 --> 00:29:48,754
At 7 h 30, it will.

344
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:51,674
The battalion will say it is too
late to wait until tomorrow.

345
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:56,136
That's their house!

346
00:30:11,068 --> 00:30:12,653
It is he, this manure!

347
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:14,446
O are the others?

348
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:15,990
I think he is alone.

349
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,408
We will capture him.

350
00:30:17,575 --> 00:30:19,160
Why? I can get it here.

351
00:30:20,244 --> 00:30:24,540
It is the National Guard,
not a militia.

352
00:30:41,932 --> 00:30:44,143
That's the program.

353
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,604
It was named one of the
Cajuns who you Poole.

354
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,231
We will capture him.
It is 250 meters.

355
00:30:50,232 --> 00:30:51,400
Sr it is you're in the game?

356
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:54,612
Of course! What do you think?

357
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:58,073
If you talked to him before
him to blow his brains out?

358
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,659
Simms, Reece, Stuckey and
I are the vanguard.

359
00:31:00,868 --> 00:31:02,620
The initial action
must be dcisive.

360
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:03,829
The surprise is the key.

361
00:31:04,205 --> 00:31:06,999
Casper ...
You heard what I said?

362
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:07,917
I heard you.

363
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,251
He will speak when
we captured them.

364
00:31:09,418 --> 00:31:11,462
The other, keep the rear.

365
00:31:11,712 --> 00:31:13,672
You stay 100 meters away,
and you stash.

366
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,842
It will end when the objective will be curly.
Here we go!

367
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:18,093
Wait.

368
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:20,179
I volunteered to the forefront.

369
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:22,640
Forget a. Do what you're told.

370
00:31:56,298 --> 00:31:57,967
Good God, what bullshit.

371
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:00,219
I was thinking the same thing.

372
00:32:02,596 --> 00:32:04,014
You always come get you?

373
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,433
You n'tais not voluntary either.

374
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,271
Right.
I will not embark with
these crtins.

375
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:16,318
At four, with automatic
cons swamp rat.

376
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,070
The match may be zero.

377
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:49,143
What are you doing, Coach?

378
00:32:49,852 --> 00:32:50,936
Shut up!

379
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,373
I t'arrte!

380
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,921
Bowden moves away
up the prisoner!

381
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:18,464
I told you to keep the rear!

382
00:33:19,006 --> 00:33:19,924
Mission accomplished, sir!

383
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,175
Bullshit!

384
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:24,553
You gch your real bullets.

385
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:30,768
I did not panic.

386
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:34,855
Okay, now gently.

387
00:33:35,272 --> 00:33:36,398
It must be questioned.

388
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:39,860
Give up.

389
00:33:40,361 --> 00:33:41,111
Releases them the knife.

390
00:33:42,822 --> 00:33:45,157
Manure, I told you lcher
this fucking knife!

391
00:33:56,836 --> 00:33:59,505
Motherfucker!
You could have broken
his jawbone.

392
00:33:59,672 --> 00:34:00,881
That's true.

393
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,132
He must speak.

394
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:04,927
Thou hast exploded
near his mouth.

395
00:34:05,594 --> 00:34:06,929
Name of God, Simms!

396
00:34:07,096 --> 00:34:10,391
How he will talk to him
if you qt jawbone?

397
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:11,892
It's his problem.

398
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:13,227
Why have you done?

399
00:34:13,394 --> 00:34:15,104
This manure Poole you!

400
00:34:15,271 --> 00:34:16,730
Fuck it!

401
00:34:17,147 --> 00:34:19,275
Lonnie, will see the interior.

402
00:34:30,744 --> 00:34:31,954
You can talk?

403
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:36,375
O are your friends?
How are they?

404
00:34:40,713 --> 00:34:41,922
What is he talking about?

405
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,634
This has made some Cajun
aim this morning.

406
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,142
It's a poacher.

407
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,436
It turns the poachers.

408
00:34:57,021 --> 00:34:59,064
He made his last stroke.

409
00:35:01,275 --> 00:35:02,902
What happens, Casper?

410
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:05,029
It was a prisoner.

411
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:12,912
Congratulations.
You did a great job.

412
00:35:13,329 --> 00:35:15,372
You needed to cut off an arm?

413
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:23,506
He uses dynamite to pcher.

414
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,884
A true off-the-law!

415
00:35:27,927 --> 00:35:30,137
Casper! There is stuff here.

416
00:35:30,846 --> 00:35:31,972
Simms,

417
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:34,600
I forbid you to hit it again.

418
00:35:42,149 --> 00:35:43,567
It is you who have
broken her mouth?

419
00:35:43,734 --> 00:35:44,944
A little, yes.

420
00:35:46,695 --> 00:35:48,739
Why did you have?

421
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:50,199
I know.

422
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:51,992
I was bored.

423
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:54,495
This crap weapon you
mount the head.

424
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:55,913
Beans,

425
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:57,248
semolina

426
00:35:57,748 --> 00:35:59,834
spinach.
It's better than our rations.

427
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,460
Guns, knives,

428
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:03,003
ammunition, food ...

429
00:36:03,504 --> 00:36:04,964
Everything is there.

430
00:36:06,257 --> 00:36:09,093
I'd say we made a
nice little raid.

431
00:36:09,844 --> 00:36:13,138
We will pack everything later.
Will be interviewing
the prisoner.

432
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:22,231
Attach the prisoner.

433
00:36:22,398 --> 00:36:25,484
How do we do when the
guy has one arm?

434
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,194
May be necessary to speak first.

435
00:36:27,528 --> 00:36:28,529
You speak English?

436
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:31,949
Does anyone speak French?

437
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,875
What you got, coach?

438
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:42,751
Not look for me.

439
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,503
Not now, not ever.

440
00:36:56,974 --> 00:36:58,475
I'll try.

441
00:36:58,934 --> 00:37:01,061
I made two years the school.

442
00:37:06,817 --> 00:37:08,903
I forgot how to say "shoot".

443
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:25,169
I think it says it did nothing.

444
00:37:25,961 --> 00:37:28,339
Franais has not resemble
what I learned.

445
00:37:29,298 --> 00:37:30,466
I've seen.

446
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:32,635
I was the too, but
I swear nothing.

447
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:34,970
I do not even know if the type

448
00:37:35,137 --> 00:37:37,431
had only one arm.
It was more than 100 meters.

449
00:37:55,115 --> 00:37:58,619
We will bring the prisoner
to be interrogated he,

450
00:37:58,786 --> 00:38:00,246
then judged.

451
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:02,289
Everyone, and tank.

452
00:38:02,456 --> 00:38:05,209
Fill your water bottles.
It should be distancing
us from here.

453
00:38:39,326 --> 00:38:41,370
Bowden crtin, there's dynamite!

454
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:48,729
to teach them to play rec.

455
00:39:49,063 --> 00:39:51,190
Indisputable.

456
00:39:52,525 --> 00:39:53,776
What are you doing, Bowden?

457
00:39:54,527 --> 00:39:56,195
You blew the whole mess.

458
00:39:56,737 --> 00:39:58,030
I do what I do.

459
00:39:58,322 --> 00:40:00,157
Why did you painted a cross?

460
00:40:02,785 --> 00:40:04,161
was part of the joke.

461
00:40:04,662 --> 00:40:05,996
What a joke?

462
00:40:06,497 --> 00:40:08,123
It's a joke deuxime class.

463
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:10,334
Brothel, Bowden!

464
00:40:10,584 --> 00:40:13,462
Asshole!
You blew all decision we made.

465
00:40:13,629 --> 00:40:15,673
Weapons, ammunition and food.

466
00:40:16,507 --> 00:40:18,175
Sometimes you have to abandon
the principles

467
00:40:18,342 --> 00:40:19,260
to do what is right.

468
00:40:24,515 --> 00:40:26,308
We better find the highway.

469
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:39,155
Come on, Casper.
Your little raid is finished.

470
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:39,006
This con Bowden

471
00:41:40,049 --> 00:41:42,885
adtruit the cabin and we lost
everything we had before.

472
00:41:43,302 --> 00:41:46,972
aa have alerted the cousins
​​of the bastard.

473
00:41:47,723 --> 00:41:50,434
We will not yet for these
gooks IS CONCERNED!

474
00:41:50,684 --> 00:41:54,647
Si But there's one that should IS
CONCERNED more than me and you.

475
00:41:56,357 --> 00:41:57,942
Me about it.

476
00:42:00,152 --> 00:42:02,947
They believe that you jinx.

477
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:04,698
They may be right.

478
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:08,369
I know that nGRE, and
I never had any luck.

479
00:42:10,913 --> 00:42:12,122
Listen, fellas.

480
00:42:15,334 --> 00:42:17,378
Dsol for the incident.

481
00:42:17,711 --> 00:42:20,589
I just let go.

482
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:23,050
You can tell.

483
00:42:23,467 --> 00:42:25,928
You can also say that you
Completely freaked out.

484
00:42:26,178 --> 00:42:29,473
Sorry, but I admired
Sergeant Poole.

485
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,016
I loved him very much.

486
00:42:31,433 --> 00:42:35,187
That was my excuse J'espre ...
excessive behavior.

487
00:42:36,647 --> 00:42:37,439
Of course.

488
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,236
Say, coach, to take a
risk in the face ...

489
00:42:42,403 --> 00:42:43,904
T'inquite has not, Hardin.

490
00:42:48,868 --> 00:42:50,536
Why did you paint this cross?

491
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,789
You have heard of the
Exterminating Angel?

492
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,672
I thought you, you'd understand.

493
00:43:03,132 --> 00:43:04,592
Dsol dcevoir thee.

494
00:43:07,344 --> 00:43:10,723
If you allow, I would like
to apologize to the other.

495
00:43:19,231 --> 00:43:20,733
I'll teach you a thing.

496
00:43:23,235 --> 00:43:24,320
It's crazy.

497
00:43:25,863 --> 00:43:27,615
Completely crazy.

498
00:43:27,781 --> 00:43:30,159
You do not teach us much.

499
00:43:31,785 --> 00:43:33,078
That's all you say?

500
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:35,873
APRS the numro he did?

501
00:43:36,457 --> 00:43:37,791
What should I say?

502
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,502
He's an asshole.

503
00:43:40,127 --> 00:43:41,921
There is a reason
and he cracked.

504
00:43:43,339 --> 00:43:44,507
He cracked.

505
00:43:45,674 --> 00:43:48,093
It is painted in red, he
laughs like a dment

506
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,012
and he thinks he is a volcano.

507
00:43:50,804 --> 00:43:51,847
And then, if it is crazy?

508
00:43:52,348 --> 00:43:53,557
What do you want me to do?

509
00:43:54,141 --> 00:43:56,519
I put him in a cage?
As I descend?

510
00:43:58,229 --> 00:44:00,022
I have no preferences.

511
00:44:04,902 --> 00:44:06,862
We will make a successful
exit from?

512
00:44:07,071 --> 00:44:08,656
A little one will escape!

513
00:44:08,823 --> 00:44:10,699
We are two hours maximum of 10.

514
00:44:27,675 --> 00:44:29,093
What is mean!

515
00:44:29,426 --> 00:44:30,302
is meaningless.

516
00:44:30,469 --> 00:44:32,304
A guy that makes dry
out her skin.

517
00:44:32,555 --> 00:44:34,348
Drle of Manir to stretch
the skin.

518
00:44:34,765 --> 00:44:36,392
You are not sr it for us?

519
00:44:44,275 --> 00:44:45,109
There are eight.

520
00:44:46,235 --> 00:44:47,027
And then?

521
00:44:47,987 --> 00:44:49,155
It is eight.

522
00:44:50,281 --> 00:44:51,532
And, what is it?

523
00:44:52,449 --> 00:44:53,659
You know, you?

524
00:44:55,953 --> 00:44:57,121
We must leave.

525
00:44:57,621 --> 00:45:00,499
Why stay here?
We shall be no more.

526
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,775
Shit, Casper!
O is the highway?
has been hours.

527
00:45:27,568 --> 00:45:30,029
Probably not far off.

528
00:45:30,196 --> 00:45:34,241
She passed by here.
The ecologists have
of the displaces.

529
00:45:34,408 --> 00:45:36,243
Shut up, Spencer!

530
00:45:58,807 --> 00:46:01,435
It stops as five minutes.

531
00:46:02,144 --> 00:46:03,187
I will do the calculations.

532
00:46:03,938 --> 00:46:05,856
With what? We have no compass.

533
00:46:06,732 --> 00:46:08,818
You know that is moving
with the sun?

534
00:46:09,026 --> 00:46:11,403
Of course.
It rises east, it sets the West.

535
00:46:11,779 --> 00:46:15,199
The highway is to the north.
We are not party to.

536
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,953
That's exactly what I'll do.
Thank you.

537
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:26,377
He knows what he's doing?

538
00:46:26,794 --> 00:46:27,586
In your opinion?

539
00:46:28,295 --> 00:46:30,089
So, why we follow?

540
00:46:31,006 --> 00:46:33,050
It has stripes.

541
00:46:33,217 --> 00:46:36,345
You have not forgotten we are
in the military maneuver.

542
00:46:37,263 --> 00:46:39,473
Coming from you, Reece,
is already a classic.

543
00:46:51,777 --> 00:46:52,653
C'tait what?

544
00:46:53,195 --> 00:46:54,530
Dogs, what do you think?

545
00:46:55,906 --> 00:46:56,949
Hunting dogs.

546
00:46:57,575 --> 00:47:01,162
Then there are hunters.
They show us the path.

547
00:47:02,621 --> 00:47:03,831
was getting closer.

548
00:47:05,207 --> 00:47:06,959
Great.

549
00:47:08,961 --> 00:47:10,838
We have hunting dogs
in the corner.

550
00:47:13,299 --> 00:47:17,178
They will show us how we steer!

551
00:48:44,056 --> 00:48:45,474
Good God, he had me.

552
00:48:46,851 --> 00:48:47,768
Goddamned bastards!

553
00:48:50,437 --> 00:48:51,564
Cribbs, all right?

554
00:48:53,232 --> 00:48:54,984
Hardin, you are touch?
you doing?

555
00:48:55,151 --> 00:48:56,235
I think. Damn!

556
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,405
Manure!

557
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:02,241
They have lch their dogs on us!

558
00:49:02,658 --> 00:49:05,995
How they could make a?
Letting the dogs!

559
00:49:08,205 --> 00:49:09,456
C'tait not the dogs!

560
00:49:09,623 --> 00:49:11,834
And my ass!
Spencer, what you are ct?

561
00:49:12,501 --> 00:49:14,628
Not yours, Reece, was sure.

562
00:49:15,087 --> 00:49:16,380
Shit, Reece. Forget it!

563
00:49:16,881 --> 00:49:18,090
All of you drop!

564
00:49:18,757 --> 00:49:21,385
The enemy does not ask
us to fight better.

565
00:49:24,597 --> 00:49:28,267
Damn, you arrtez five minutes,
and come home.

566
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:30,477
You, will you calm down.

567
00:49:49,246 --> 00:49:51,165
I want to know what happens.

568
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:53,000
I do not follow you.

569
00:49:53,542 --> 00:49:56,212
It's not complicated.

570
00:49:57,171 --> 00:49:59,256
My company got transfr
Baton Rouge.

571
00:49:59,507 --> 00:50:01,467
I've been here six months.

572
00:50:01,926 --> 00:50:04,887
I really know nothing about
the Louisiana marshes.

573
00:50:05,137 --> 00:50:07,556
It sends me exercises can,

574
00:50:07,723 --> 00:50:11,435
and all of a sudden,
guys fall on us!

575
00:50:11,602 --> 00:50:14,063
I'll ask again.
What's happening?

576
00:50:15,689 --> 00:50:16,857
I'll tell you one thing.

577
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,485
Me, I'm from the city.

578
00:50:20,778 --> 00:50:23,989
You ask me what happens?
I have not the faintest idea.

579
00:50:25,074 --> 00:50:28,077
Except that we came across strange
people who want our skin.

580
00:50:28,327 --> 00:50:31,747
Everything was shot because a
con white with a machine gun.

581
00:50:34,124 --> 00:50:36,001
Because a fuckers
have stung boats.

582
00:51:39,773 --> 00:51:41,942
Casper! It becomes heavy.

583
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:44,195
has will not be long.

584
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:45,529
If left here?

585
00:51:45,905 --> 00:51:48,282
No. I've already told you.

586
00:51:48,574 --> 00:51:50,993
PSE it a ton, the bastard.

587
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,995
Do not talk like a Poole.

588
00:51:53,245 --> 00:51:53,913
He does not hear me.

589
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:54,955
But if!

590
00:51:55,122 --> 00:51:58,667
Shit, Casper.
That motherfucker is dead.
I speak of that body.

591
00:51:58,876 --> 00:52:02,254
I told you I do not want you
to speak of him as a!

592
00:52:02,421 --> 00:52:03,255
Watch out!

593
00:52:05,966 --> 00:52:07,426
You almost walk into it.

594
00:52:12,598 --> 00:52:13,974
Look at these crap.

595
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:17,770
It looks like a pussy steel.

596
00:52:21,357 --> 00:52:23,734
What kind of nnet you
frequent providers?

597
00:52:25,903 --> 00:52:28,656
They are tense. All seven

598
00:52:29,114 --> 00:52:29,990
Like rabbits.

599
00:52:30,282 --> 00:52:31,325
There were eight rabbits.

600
00:52:31,867 --> 00:52:35,621
And why there are only seven?
We lost someone?

601
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,081
They are for us?

602
00:52:37,665 --> 00:52:38,582
For us, or

603
00:52:38,749 --> 00:52:40,209
the last seven bears
in Louisiana.

604
00:52:49,426 --> 00:52:50,344
What you asked him?

605
00:52:50,886 --> 00:52:52,513
What did I.

606
00:52:53,097 --> 00:52:55,266
My bastard, is that
there are others?

607
00:52:57,059 --> 00:52:58,269
I'm talking to you!

608
00:52:58,644 --> 00:53:00,146
Reece, drops! Shall adopt!

609
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,940
They have not had,
and we have not.

610
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:06,944
We lost enough time.
The motorway is not far.

611
00:53:07,361 --> 00:53:09,697
Let's go.
Cribbs, you take the head.

612
00:53:17,288 --> 00:53:19,540
Shit, Casper. I see why.

613
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:23,335
I do not know where is the highway.
You always say you know ...

614
00:53:23,502 --> 00:53:25,713
Why do not you take the head?

615
00:53:26,046 --> 00:53:28,716
No unnecessary noise, and
silence during the walk.

616
00:53:55,367 --> 00:53:57,203
Our Father, that your
in heaven ...

617
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:54,552
I do not want to hear a.

618
00:54:55,427 --> 00:54:57,805
We are at war, and that's it.

619
00:54:58,889 --> 00:55:01,976
I want you to have the air
of soldiers, not factors.

620
00:55:02,268 --> 00:55:03,686
Weapons must be kept properly.

621
00:55:04,436 --> 00:55:06,772
We only have half an
hour of daylight.

622
00:55:07,356 --> 00:55:09,316
We'll bivouac here.

623
00:55:10,484 --> 00:55:13,863
The clairire is great.
These bastards will
not surprise us.

624
00:55:16,782 --> 00:55:19,535
It's a. Casper, a second.

625
00:55:21,412 --> 00:55:22,872
Talking about two
or three things.

626
00:55:24,623 --> 00:55:26,959
Tomorrow morning, we
seek hlicoptres.

627
00:55:27,459 --> 00:55:30,212
They will find us if
we stay discovery.

628
00:55:30,796 --> 00:55:32,715
The only problem is
the Cajuns, eh?

629
00:55:34,049 --> 00:55:37,136
We know neither the strength nor
the intentions of the enemy.

630
00:55:37,887 --> 00:55:40,055
It has the advantage
of knowing The field

631
00:55:40,431 --> 00:55:42,850
we have the advantage of
military entrainment.

632
00:55:43,017 --> 00:55:44,351
The speech is gnial, Casper,

633
00:55:44,518 --> 00:55:46,270
but I want to increase
our chances.

634
00:55:46,437 --> 00:55:47,521
O you want to come, Spencer?

635
00:55:48,981 --> 00:55:50,357
Maybe they want to be a trapper.

636
00:55:51,484 --> 00:55:52,485
Can it be anything they want.

637
00:55:52,735 --> 00:55:54,695
Take the risk to let him go.

638
00:55:55,446 --> 00:55:59,366
He Poole you. He stays with us.

639
00:55:59,533 --> 00:56:00,826
Sr is not thou he Poole.

640
00:56:00,993 --> 00:56:03,120
It is the first Cajun
on which it fell.

641
00:56:05,289 --> 00:56:07,082
They want to kill us all.

642
00:56:07,416 --> 00:56:08,292
It's true!

643
00:56:08,501 --> 00:56:10,127
I'm tired of hearing about a.

644
00:56:10,878 --> 00:56:11,545
Reece and Stuckey,

645
00:56:11,712 --> 00:56:13,547
ridging the prisoner,
and attach it.

646
00:56:14,882 --> 00:56:17,426
Simms is on guard.

647
00:56:19,178 --> 00:56:20,804
Casper, you're a real jerk!

648
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:27,228
Listen to me, Spencer,
and it costs me well.

649
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,606
Tomorrow morning we are heading
north with the prisoner.

650
00:56:31,649 --> 00:56:33,234
The man who you Crawford Poole

651
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,237
one whose friends have
you Tyrone Cribbs.

652
00:56:36,403 --> 00:56:39,281
In case you'd forgotten o Spencer
c'tait our friends.

653
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:45,955
Now we install.

654
00:56:47,623 --> 00:56:48,874
No fire tonight.

655
00:57:27,121 --> 00:57:27,788
you doing?

656
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:29,582
Yes, okay.

657
00:57:31,959 --> 00:57:33,794
You might be due to the trapper.

658
00:57:36,964 --> 00:57:38,465
So why have not said anything?

659
00:57:38,883 --> 00:57:41,260
Because I can not believe
this crap.

660
00:57:42,928 --> 00:57:44,138
Prviens me when you believe.

661
00:57:45,139 --> 00:57:48,100
The problem is not what
I believe or not.

662
00:57:49,435 --> 00:57:50,186
So what?

663
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,856
How long will we keep this
asshole from Casper?

664
00:57:55,149 --> 00:57:56,942
I feel that makes us
turn in circles.

665
00:58:01,572 --> 00:58:02,823
We need another leader.

666
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:06,160
You are a volunteer?

667
00:58:07,495 --> 00:58:08,829
I'm the new, right?

668
00:58:10,623 --> 00:58:12,374
You know these guys. Your turn.

669
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:16,003
And I'm not the kind
of volunteer.

670
00:58:18,631 --> 00:58:19,882
You're unbelievable, Hardin.

671
00:58:21,008 --> 00:58:22,092
You will not be voluntary

672
00:58:22,259 --> 00:58:25,054
but you do not mind that I
am for the court martial.

673
00:58:29,266 --> 00:58:30,142
Fuck you.

674
00:58:43,572 --> 00:58:45,074
I must speak to you, Casper.

675
00:58:45,699 --> 00:58:46,575
Fragmentation.

676
00:58:50,454 --> 00:58:51,330
Remember the entrainment.

677
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:53,082
I produced a grenade.

678
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:57,878
Mrs.
White shot can save your
life if you improvise.

679
00:58:58,087 --> 00:59:01,006
Good God, Casper, shall adopt the bullshit!
This is important.

680
00:59:01,465 --> 00:59:02,341
This is Bowden.

681
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,927
It is reached. He can talk.

682
00:59:05,886 --> 00:59:08,222
Spencer said he became
Completely crazy.

683
00:59:08,556 --> 00:59:10,724
You better come.
I think he's right.

684
00:59:32,538 --> 00:59:33,455
Listen, Bowden.

685
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:36,667
I know aa t hard for everyone.

686
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:38,586
I understand that you do
not feel very well.

687
00:59:40,546 --> 00:59:41,797
Why not us?

688
00:59:57,396 --> 00:59:58,898
Bowden is an order.

689
00:59:59,315 --> 01:00:00,566
Name of God, respond to us!

690
01:00:09,492 --> 01:00:10,409
I do not understand.

691
01:00:11,243 --> 01:00:14,205
I do.
This motherfucker is crazy.

692
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:18,542
What are we going to do?

693
01:00:20,586 --> 01:00:21,587
Let the l

694
01:00:21,921 --> 01:00:23,422
Maybe it will be better
tomorrow morning.

695
01:00:23,631 --> 01:00:24,381
No way.

696
01:00:25,299 --> 01:00:27,510
This guy was a bomb, remember?

697
01:00:28,052 --> 01:00:29,220
You will bind him.

698
01:00:30,179 --> 01:00:31,722
We did not want him walking
around during sleep.

699
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:33,390
It is too big and dangerous.

700
01:00:33,641 --> 01:00:34,934
Make use of your head, Casper.

701
01:00:35,434 --> 01:00:36,185
He's right.

702
01:00:37,812 --> 01:00:39,563
True, Casper.

703
01:00:40,272 --> 01:00:41,565
will harm a person to tie.

704
01:00:41,732 --> 01:00:43,734
It serves us nothing.

705
01:00:45,486 --> 01:00:47,571
He has never served anything.

706
01:00:47,947 --> 01:00:50,699
If we tied up, you lose
the power of fire.

707
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:53,702
Name of God, Casper, fetches
a rope and stops of DCON

708
01:00:53,869 --> 01:00:54,662
with your firepower!

709
01:00:54,829 --> 01:00:57,289
Do you remember the last time
you spoke to me in that tone?

710
01:00:57,456 --> 01:01:00,376
DCON not Casper.
We're not having fun.

711
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:08,384
Well ...
there are 15 m of
rope in my bag.

712
01:01:09,969 --> 01:01:10,970
Go get them, Simms.

713
01:02:16,869 --> 01:02:18,162
What are you doing, Reece?

714
01:02:19,497 --> 01:02:20,956
This guy will talk to me.

715
01:02:24,793 --> 01:02:25,586
It releases them.

716
01:02:26,754 --> 01:02:27,838
Te mle not a.

717
01:02:29,924 --> 01:02:31,342
I told the lcher.

718
01:02:36,222 --> 01:02:37,056
You're happy now?

719
01:02:42,895 --> 01:02:43,562
made the time deuxime

720
01:02:43,729 --> 01:02:45,272
that you look for me.

721
01:02:45,731 --> 01:02:47,233
This time, you'll find me.

722
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:51,195
It is time, cowboy.

723
01:02:51,529 --> 01:02:54,031
And if I did skip
the head, Reece?

724
01:02:55,783 --> 01:02:57,117
You have not enough balls.

725
01:03:58,304 --> 01:03:59,221
Kill him!

726
01:04:18,199 --> 01:04:18,908
He is dead.

727
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,036
Reece died.

728
01:04:24,413 --> 01:04:26,540
Your prisoner has
Chappe, Casper.

729
01:04:29,668 --> 01:04:30,544
Lonnie!

730
01:04:35,799 --> 01:04:37,426
I'll get you, you bastard!

731
01:04:37,885 --> 01:04:39,178
You hear me? I'll get you!

732
01:04:57,321 --> 01:04:59,490
How many graves we will still
leave it in the corner?

733
01:04:59,907 --> 01:05:01,450
Most of ours, I say.

734
01:05:01,617 --> 01:05:02,701
Yes, you can say ...

735
01:05:06,372 --> 01:05:07,039
Shut up!

736
01:05:08,207 --> 01:05:09,124
It's me you talking about?

737
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,502
I talk about everyone,
including you!

738
01:05:12,586 --> 01:05:14,630
Shut up and dig!

739
01:05:15,589 --> 01:05:18,259
Why not you?
It is you who you are!

740
01:05:18,425 --> 01:05:20,135
I'll tell it twice.

741
01:05:20,386 --> 01:05:21,720
Ferme ta gueule

742
01:05:21,887 --> 01:05:23,264
and widening the fucking grave!

743
01:05:23,973 --> 01:05:24,974
I want to hear any more crap

744
01:05:25,141 --> 01:05:26,100
from you either!

745
01:05:32,815 --> 01:05:35,276
Do what he says and dig.

746
01:05:52,042 --> 01:05:53,544
We lost three men.

747
01:05:54,003 --> 01:05:58,174
We did not lose more.
Survival is mental.

748
01:05:58,757 --> 01:06:03,095
If you are not PRTS face
obstacles and evidence,

749
01:06:03,345 --> 01:06:05,097
your chance to get out alive

750
01:06:06,682 --> 01:06:08,142
Whereas Reduces are.

751
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,936
You start getting tired
of hearing you, Casper.

752
01:06:11,687 --> 01:06:14,565
Name of God, Spencer!
I do my best.

753
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,358
I know, Casper.

754
01:06:17,401 --> 01:06:19,445
But we do narratives manual
serves nothing.

755
01:06:21,071 --> 01:06:22,448
You think you better?

756
01:06:22,865 --> 01:06:23,782
I think so.

757
01:06:24,033 --> 01:06:25,784
I am the team leader.

758
01:06:26,035 --> 01:06:28,454
You're not even a corporal.
Just top class.

759
01:06:30,122 --> 01:06:32,458
I'm starting to get
fed this crap.

760
01:06:33,459 --> 01:06:34,543
I'm with you, Spencer.

761
01:06:35,252 --> 01:06:37,755
Casper, you never find
the damn highway.

762
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:46,347
You promise me that this bastard
Texan goes to court martial?

763
01:06:47,598 --> 01:06:50,100
He will have to.
It was you one of his
fellow soldiers.

764
01:06:52,478 --> 01:06:53,562
So I'm with you.

765
01:06:58,025 --> 01:07:01,362
What's that voted for the con?
Let's go!

766
01:07:04,532 --> 01:07:06,575
Go Bowden. We go home.

767
01:07:08,994 --> 01:07:11,080
Spencer, you can not
leave like a.

768
01:07:12,164 --> 01:07:15,084
We are a squad, a unit.
The Bravo team.

769
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:17,753
Deserts you, guys.

770
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:19,713
And how we deserts!

771
01:07:22,341 --> 01:07:23,050
You coming?

772
01:07:57,585 --> 01:07:58,460
How's your arm?

773
01:07:59,879 --> 01:08:00,713
was okay.

774
01:08:03,215 --> 01:08:05,050
Let me tell you something ...

775
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:07,803
I know that Reece
silent a bastard.

776
01:08:09,138 --> 01:08:10,598
I want to talk about it.

777
01:08:11,891 --> 01:08:14,268
C'tait may be legitimized
by the defense.

778
01:08:14,435 --> 01:08:16,061
Speak more of a.

779
01:08:18,147 --> 01:08:18,939
Done.

780
01:08:24,111 --> 01:08:27,323
What chance was to get away?

781
01:08:28,157 --> 01:08:30,034
You who know everything.

782
01:08:31,035 --> 01:08:32,369
Now you're the boss.

783
01:08:33,037 --> 01:08:34,121
Sought not me.

784
01:08:34,788 --> 01:08:37,124
Right now we have the troop,
helicopter, dogs,

785
01:08:37,291 --> 01:08:39,001
all Louisiana's search for us.

786
01:08:39,168 --> 01:08:41,962
You know, Spencer ...
For dogs, I have already given.

787
01:08:42,713 --> 01:08:45,758
I'll tell you something else.
They are swarming intrt.

788
01:09:57,538 --> 01:10:00,249
Simms, what happens?

789
01:10:00,416 --> 01:10:01,667
I thought I saw something.

790
01:10:04,753 --> 01:10:06,589
You're safe? I heard nothing.

791
01:10:06,755 --> 01:10:07,590
Me either.

792
01:10:07,756 --> 01:10:09,008
You have not heard?

793
01:10:09,425 --> 01:10:10,217
You have d.

794
01:10:10,384 --> 01:10:11,510
I heard nothing!

795
01:10:11,844 --> 01:10:13,679
You gch your bullets as Bowden.

796
01:10:14,972 --> 01:10:16,265
There is nothing yet.

797
01:10:17,683 --> 01:10:18,934
Damn!

798
01:10:48,672 --> 01:10:50,007
Motherfucker!

799
01:11:23,207 --> 01:11:24,208
More than a!

800
01:11:30,297 --> 01:11:31,215
They have dterrs.

801
01:11:32,216 --> 01:11:33,175
They have all dterrs.

802
01:12:37,281 --> 01:12:38,407
Bowden, Good God!

803
01:12:53,881 --> 01:12:55,549
They have overflow solutions.
You're stuck.

804
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:57,593
You'll cover me, Simms.

805
01:12:57,843 --> 01:12:58,511
With what?

806
01:12:58,928 --> 01:13:00,012
I as white balls.

807
01:13:00,471 --> 01:13:02,848
No radio, no ammunition,
no planes, no mortars!

808
01:13:03,182 --> 01:13:04,350
How to fight with?

809
01:13:04,558 --> 01:13:07,019
No wonder, Casper.
It is you who are
supposed to know!

810
01:13:07,603 --> 01:13:09,188
White Tire!
Help yourself to 
verything you have!

811
01:13:46,892 --> 01:13:47,935
It has 4 cartridges.

812
01:13:48,644 --> 01:13:49,520
I have mine.

813
01:13:49,812 --> 01:13:51,230
Thou hast drawn, asshole.

814
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,501
Go ... replions us.

815
01:14:16,046 --> 01:14:17,631
Pull up!

816
01:14:54,585 --> 01:14:55,544
Listen.

817
01:15:03,135 --> 01:15:04,136
I hear nothing.

818
01:15:08,641 --> 01:15:09,725
I hear it.

819
01:16:10,327 --> 01:16:12,204
If he saw us, he will return.

820
01:16:12,371 --> 01:16:14,248
He could not land. Too trees.

821
01:16:20,254 --> 01:16:21,172
O is Stuckey?

822
01:17:19,688 --> 01:17:20,564
Damn!

823
01:17:22,149 --> 01:17:24,401
Well, sparons us.
We must find him.

824
01:17:24,568 --> 01:17:27,238
Me and Hardin.
I take Bowden.
Casper, you go with Simms.

825
01:17:27,488 --> 01:17:29,406
Those who find, shoot a
ball every 5 minutes.

826
01:17:29,657 --> 01:17:31,450
The other team will go by, OK?

827
01:17:31,617 --> 01:17:32,993
And if you find it?

828
01:17:33,702 --> 01:17:36,497
We wait an hour.
Shoot 5 shots, then a
ball every 5 minutes.

829
01:17:36,747 --> 01:17:38,249
The two teams will join APRS.

830
01:17:53,681 --> 01:17:55,015
Stuckey!

831
01:18:11,323 --> 01:18:14,702
Stuckey, fucking pquenot,
where art thou?

832
01:18:37,391 --> 01:18:39,393
Dirty son of a bitch!

833
01:18:41,145 --> 01:18:42,354
Go Simms, join the others.

834
01:18:43,272 --> 01:18:43,981
You're crazy.

835
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:46,567
You're crazy!

836
01:18:46,734 --> 01:18:48,194
You hear? Go ahead, get lost!

837
01:20:11,569 --> 01:20:12,987
I have done nothing wrong.

838
01:20:15,739 --> 01:20:17,366
I did not ask to come.

839
01:20:19,285 --> 01:20:21,162
I did not ask to come!

840
01:20:57,865 --> 01:21:00,451
I think what we do is say
there is opposition o.

841
01:21:01,577 --> 01:21:03,746
They had no trouble finding
us up presents.

842
01:21:15,966 --> 01:21:16,801
Come on, do we draw.

843
01:21:20,971 --> 01:21:22,890
It's every man for himself now.

844
01:21:24,058 --> 01:21:26,060
If others get there, fine.

845
01:22:09,770 --> 01:22:12,189
This state is really
gnial Spencer.

846
01:22:12,356 --> 01:22:14,150
They sent a fucking hlicoptre.

847
01:22:15,276 --> 01:22:17,486
What do you want them to send?
The National Guard?

848
01:22:18,654 --> 01:22:21,949
Civil peace.
Soldier at war. I am a Guard.

849
01:22:25,327 --> 01:22:27,913
H, Bowden ... Want to talk?

850
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:30,666
H, entraneur.

851
01:22:37,339 --> 01:22:38,382
Entraneur what, anyway?

852
01:22:39,008 --> 01:22:40,050
Football, what else?

853
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:43,345
I think he also teaches history.

854
01:22:45,014 --> 01:22:47,850
It seems that for him, everything is more than history.
Asshole.

855
01:22:50,227 --> 01:22:53,230
could become as a history for the
other two idiots, if continued.

856
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:04,366
This time tomorrow you will be
your office, a beer in hand,

857
01:23:04,533 --> 01:23:06,494
watching your wife
and listen DCON.

858
01:23:07,036 --> 01:23:08,287
I have no office.

859
01:23:09,163 --> 01:23:11,207
I worry if we'll pay a lot of l.

860
01:23:11,373 --> 01:23:12,124
Gnial.

861
01:23:15,294 --> 01:23:16,378
You're husband how long?

862
01:23:19,173 --> 01:23:19,924
Five years.

863
01:23:21,634 --> 01:23:22,384
Happy?

864
01:23:25,179 --> 01:23:26,263
As in "happy marriage" ...

865
01:23:30,226 --> 01:23:32,394
I like it. It has humor.

866
01:23:34,188 --> 01:23:35,189
What has you can fuck?

867
01:23:37,024 --> 01:23:39,944
If I'm doing and you do
not, I'll go with it.

868
01:23:44,865 --> 01:23:47,243
It has humor. I do not.

869
01:23:49,036 --> 01:23:51,247
Mine is rather limited
at this time also.

870
01:23:56,752 --> 01:23:58,462
They have their rcupr
trapper ...

871
01:24:00,923 --> 01:24:03,551
They have to hunt just for fun.

872
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,556
You got an idea of
​​what can be done

873
01:24:08,764 --> 01:24:10,099
or is it just to say something.

874
01:24:12,643 --> 01:24:14,728
I'll tell you what I say:

875
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:18,649
I want to live.

876
01:24:21,443 --> 01:24:23,195
I do not know how I'll do.

877
01:24:24,613 --> 01:24:26,699
But I will fight to get out.

878
01:24:31,453 --> 01:24:34,039
Remember to keep me a place.

879
01:24:37,918 --> 01:24:39,336
T'inquite not, it
Pipelines Limited.

880
01:25:57,790 --> 01:25:58,999
Asshole!

881
01:26:01,919 --> 01:26:03,921
I'll kill you if you
force me not.

882
01:26:05,172 --> 01:26:06,715
There is a down the bayou.

883
01:26:07,508 --> 01:26:08,300
Take it.

884
01:26:09,385 --> 01:26:10,469
Stay on the west bank.

885
01:26:11,595 --> 01:26:13,806
You will find a road and
a half kilometer grids.

886
01:26:15,182 --> 01:26:17,393
you would have nothing to
tell us what happens?

887
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:18,978
It's very simple.

888
01:26:19,603 --> 01:26:20,855
We live here.

889
01:26:21,147 --> 01:26:23,774
This is our territory and nobody
plays fuck with us.

890
01:26:24,775 --> 01:26:25,568
And him?

891
01:26:25,818 --> 01:26:26,944
Him?

892
01:26:27,736 --> 01:26:29,446
He has done everything
yourself, your friends

893
01:26:29,738 --> 01:26:30,531
aid have?

894
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:37,746
If I were you I would ask more
questions and I would draw.

895
01:26:38,205 --> 01:26:40,875
My friends ...
they are not nice like me.

896
01:26:41,625 --> 01:26:43,043
We must say thank you?

897
01:26:44,128 --> 01:26:45,754
You have nothing to say ...

898
01:26:46,755 --> 01:26:47,423
soldier!

899
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,046
A fucking truck.

900
01:28:11,465 --> 01:28:12,550
You lost your?

901
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:17,471
Want to ride?

902
01:28:19,181 --> 01:28:20,057
My God, yes!

903
01:28:28,023 --> 01:28:29,358
The next town, yes?

904
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:31,861
Gnial.

905
01:29:53,192 --> 01:29:54,527
can not be a Catahoula.

906
01:29:55,069 --> 01:29:56,362
Is that corn.

907
01:29:57,905 --> 01:30:00,115
And this city where we went?

908
01:30:00,282 --> 01:30:01,659
has to be here.

909
01:30:03,452 --> 01:30:04,578
O is the phone?

910
01:30:07,039 --> 01:30:08,958
It was the reader,
but not on mobile.

911
01:30:09,166 --> 01:30:10,918
We want to go in a city
where there on mobile.

912
01:30:12,461 --> 01:30:14,630
Eat first. You go to town APRS.

913
01:30:14,964 --> 01:30:16,382
No, we want to go now.

914
01:30:17,383 --> 01:30:20,678
Have a drink. Have fun with us.

915
01:30:23,347 --> 01:30:25,015
You will later on mobile.

916
01:30:25,558 --> 01:30:28,227
Come with me.
I'll show you wash o.

917
01:31:14,857 --> 01:31:15,649
What do you think?

918
01:31:19,236 --> 01:31:20,321
I think I feel better.

919
01:31:21,489 --> 01:31:22,448
Cleaner anyway.

920
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:25,826
Yes? And more security?

921
01:31:27,328 --> 01:31:30,039
Not enough to go to sleep.

922
01:31:32,416 --> 01:31:36,504
We should forget Mr.
and Mrs.
Cajun and find the city alone.

923
01:31:38,672 --> 01:31:41,091
If they are still APRS us, they
will find in the swamp.

924
01:31:41,258 --> 01:31:42,802
But we are shooting ourselves
ds we can.

925
01:31:46,597 --> 01:31:48,849
It is safe here.

926
01:32:28,931 --> 01:32:32,560
Quiet, Hardin.
These are good Cajuns.
The others are away.

927
01:32:33,519 --> 01:32:34,395
You, you calm!

928
01:34:42,606 --> 01:34:43,899
Look at these two guys.

929
01:34:44,066 --> 01:34:44,900
Who?

930
01:34:45,568 --> 01:34:46,777
They descend from the boat.

931
01:34:49,321 --> 01:34:50,948
You think they are the ones?

932
01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:54,326
I know. I've never really seen.

933
01:34:55,202 --> 01:34:56,120
I think it's them.

934
01:34:57,496 --> 01:34:59,165
I'm not the purview
of the paranoid.

935
01:35:00,374 --> 01:35:02,293
I have enough to be paranoid,
and you too.

936
01:35:02,459 --> 01:35:05,087
They must kill us.
It is the only tmoins.

937
01:35:05,421 --> 01:35:08,591
T'angoisse not.
They can do anything in
front of everyone.

938
01:36:46,605 --> 01:36:48,232
I tell you, Hardin, calm down.

939
01:45:32,214 --> 01:45:35,593
