1
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,435
Misha!

2
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,441
Aah!

3
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:25,010
Superman's mother:
listen carefully,my son.

4
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,514
By now, Kal-El,
you are entering

5
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,517
The atmosphere of
the planet known as earth.

6
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:35,020
I pray you have made
a safe journey.

7
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,523
The yellow sun
of your new home

8
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,526
Will give you
great physical powers,

9
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:44,530
But it cannot
console your spirit.

10
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,534
Placed aboard this vessel
is an energy module,

11
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:53,038
All that remains of
a once powerful civilization--

12
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,542
Krypton,
your mother planet.

13
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,544
It is my last gift
to you.

14
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,047
Once removed,

15
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:05,050
The ship will grow
cold and silent,

16
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,053
And you will
be finally alone.

17
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:14,560
The power in the module
can be used but once.

18
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,564
Use it wisely, my son.

19
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,806
Clark, you out here?

20
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:53,807
Clark Kent!

21
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,809
Hi, Mr. Hornsby.

22
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,810
Over here.

23
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,812
Ah, there you are.

24
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,813
How are you,sir?

25
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,814
Oh, I'm fine, Clark,
how are you?

26
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,317
Nice to see you.
It's been a long time.

27
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,319
A long time.

28
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,321
I was just tidying up
for when you show the place.

29
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:08,822
Yeah, well,
didn't I mention

30
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,824
There's an offer
to buy sight unseen?

31
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,328
I won't sell
to a big developer.

32
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:17,331
Anybody who buys it
has to want a real farm.

33
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,832
I don't think we need
another shopping center.

34
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:22,336
Darn it, Clark,
why are you so stubborn?

35
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,838
Today,
nobody wants a farm.

36
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,842
You blink your eye,
and they'll all be gone.

37
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,344
That's progress.

38
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,347
Oh, my gosh,
look at this.

39
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:40,354
Oh, what a joker
old jonathan Kent was.

40
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:44,858
I asked him what happened
to the baby's crib,

41
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,361
And he said...

42
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:51,865
"Little Clark must have
had a bad dream and kicked it."

43
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,868
Yeah, dad liked
a good joke.

44
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,370
I was wondering,
Mr. Hornsby,

45
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,871
Maybe you'd like
to keep these

46
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,374
For your
grandchildren.

47
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:03,377
Why, thank you
very much, Clark.

48
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,878
Here. Batter up.

49
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,880
Come on,
let's hit a few.

50
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:13,887
Watch out, now.

51
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,889
These will come in
pretty fast.

52
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:22,896
Ha!

53
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,399
You never could
hit a curve ball.

54
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,900
Ha ha ha!

55
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,903
That's my final decision
about the place.

56
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,406
I'm going to hold out
for a real farmer.

57
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:33,907
You are?

58
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,912
You're just as obstinate
as your father was, too.

59
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,415
I'm sorry.
That's just how it is.

60
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,417
You be careful
when you get back

61
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,418
To Metropolis, Clark.

62
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,920
It's a long, long way

63
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,921
From where
you were born.

64
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,423
Yes, sir.

65
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,925
I never
forget that, sir.

66
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:54,928
Bye.

67
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:55,929
Bye, Clark!

68
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:18,118
What is that god-awful
noise you're making?

69
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,622
Mozart,
my low-forehead friend.

70
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,124
Even this wretched pit
can't diminish

71
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,627
The spirit of true genius.

72
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:30,130
Life itself started
in a murky pit much like this.

73
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,635
A true genius like myself
learns to seize the moment.

74
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:37,137
You're the first to know

75
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:41,141
That I now have plans
to recreate life itself.

76
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,645
Hey, Luthor, you better
start breakin' a sweat,

77
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,146
Or we'll throw you
to the wolves!

78
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,148
Let's get
them duds dirty!

79
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:49,149
Move it, meathead.

80
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,151
Let's see
a little sweat.

81
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,152
What's that car
doing out here?

82
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,154
?? She ain't fakin'??

83
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,657
?? Whole lotta shakin'
goin' on...??

84
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,659
Hey, stop!
Hold it there, son!

85
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,663
Yo, dudes,
where the hell is this,

86
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,665
And how the hell
do I get to cedar city?

87
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:08,168
You're on the wrong
side of the state, boy!

88
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,170
No chance.
Oh, no.

89
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,174
Ooh, you got
a fine, fine,

90
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,677
Super-fine sound system
here, son.

91
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,179
I guess you dudes
have never seen

92
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,182
One of these sensurround
100s, have you?

93
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,184
I seen one
in a magazine.

94
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,687
Come on, get in.

95
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,188
Really?

96
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,189
Really?

97
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,191
Only way to hear it.
Come on.

98
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,192
All right!

99
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,695
Hop in, Bubba.
Let's give it a listen.

100
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,699
Hey, this is groovy.

101
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,703
Doors.

102
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,205
What's going on?

103
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,206
Windows.

104
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,708
Whoa!

105
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,710
The top.

106
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,211
Seats.

107
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,213
Whoa! All right!

108
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,215
All right!

109
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,718
Drive away.

110
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,222
Y'all come back
and see us now, hear?

111
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,226
Launch.

112
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,229
Whoa-oh-oh!

113
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,230
Boom.

114
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,733
All right!

115
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,237
Did I do OK
or what, uncle lex?

116
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,238
Lenny, I've always
considered you

117
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,240
The Dutch elm disease
in my family tree,

118
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,242
But this time, nephew,
you did fine.

119
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,749
You skipping
the country?

120
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,251
You pathetic product
of public schools,

121
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,254
I've had nothing
on my awesome mind

122
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,257
Since incarceration
except one thing...

123
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,759
Both: destroy Superman.

124
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,177
Rock!

125
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,766
Sorry.

126
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,271
Bon jour, Monsieur.

127
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,273
Comment a va aujourd'hui?

128
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,783
Clark!

129
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,286
Oh.

130
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,297
Pardon, Monsieur.

131
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,299
Ou est la gare pour...

132
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,801
The metropolitan station?

133
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,303
Arghh!

134
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,317
Help!

135
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,318
Help!

136
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,822
Help! Somebody get help!

137
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,338
Superman!

138
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,364
He'll be all right.
I think he needs a doctor.

139
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,867
Superman!

140
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,869
Gentlemen, one moment.

141
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,871
I'D like all the people
back there to know

142
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,372
That our subway system
is still the safest

143
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,875
And most reliable means
of public transportation.

144
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,376
Thank you.

145
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,381
Thanks.

146
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,511
You're late, Kent!

147
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,513
Sorry.
Won't happen again.

148
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,014
Ha!

149
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,016
Where is everybody?

150
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,017
Boring.

151
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,521
Tedious.

152
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:59,024
Abominable!

153
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,025
Regardez.

154
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,027
Voila, Monsieur
David Warfield.

155
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:05,030
That tycoon who owns
those sleazy tabloids?

156
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,532
Au contraire,
mon ami.

157
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:08,534
He owns those
sleazy tabloids

158
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,536
Both:and The Daily Planet.

159
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,037
Tedious.

160
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:14,039
Don't tell me
you only read pictures.

161
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:18,544
The fact is, Mr. White,
that I only read the ledger,

162
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:21,547
A ledger which
the previous owners

163
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:23,048
Paid so little
attention to,

164
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:26,051
I bought the paper
out from under them.

165
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,554
It hasn't made any money
in three years!

166
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:31,056
And the name of the game
is making money.

167
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:34,560
Ladies and gentlemen,
my daughter,

168
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,061
Lacy Warfield.

169
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,062
Thanks, daddy.

170
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,064
It's very nice
to meet you, ma'am.

171
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:42,568
Mr. White,
lacy will be helping you.

172
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:45,070
Helping me?
Helping me what?

173
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,072
I have some mock copies

174
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:50,075
Of our new layout.
Super, isn't it?

175
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,578
The suit's not right,
but we'll change it.

176
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:54,580
Excuse me, Mr. Warfield,

177
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,582
But the world isn't
really on the brink.

178
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:59,084
Isn't that headline
irresponsible?

179
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,587
Maybe, but it'll sell
a lot of newspapers.

180
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,090
Don't do anything rash.

181
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,093
I won't let you turn
this grand old lady

182
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,094
Into one of your bimbos!

183
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,095
Mr. White.

184
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:13,599
May I point out that daddy
holds all your contracts,

185
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:16,101
Which you will
have to honor.

186
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:19,104
Excusez-moi...
Your spoiledness.

187
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,607
Why is lois trying
to speak french?

188
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,108
I'm flying to Paris

189
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,611
For the emergency
ministers conference--

190
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,114
Not so fast.
All trips are canceled.

191
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:32,117
My trip to Paris
is canceled?

192
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,620
Mr. White,
show me your books.

193
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,623
Everybody else,
get back to work.

194
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:39,625
We're being
treated unfairly.

195
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,626
I'll speak
to miss Warfield.

196
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:41,627
Me, too.

197
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:42,628
Excuse me,
miss Warfield?

198
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:43,629
Yes?

199
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:45,631
I think I speak for
all of us when I say

200
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,633
That we'll all do
our best to cooperate.

201
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,134
Thank you.

202
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,636
But a reporter's
first allegiance

203
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,137
Is to the truth.

204
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:55,140
This city's people
depend on us.

205
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,142
We can't
let them down.

206
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,644
Thank you.

207
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,150
Is he for real?

208
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,154
100%, And I like
him that way, OK?

209
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:11,657
You have
a thing for him?

210
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:14,159
For Clark?
No! Ha ha ha!

211
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,161
He's kind of cute.

212
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,664
Uh, look,
miss Warfield...

213
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:22,167
Clark is the oldest
living boy scout, OK?

214
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,670
He's trustworthy,
he's helpful,

215
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,672
He's loyal,
 he's obedient,

216
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,173
He...

217
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,176
I don't know how
to tell you this.

218
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:35,681
I just don't think he'd be
attracted to somebody like you.

219
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:38,183
Don't be silly.
All men like me.

220
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:40,185
I'm very, very rich.

221
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,605
Why don't you have
air travel expenses?

222
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,607
I usually
get air sick,

223
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,609
Especially
when it's bumpy.

224
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:50,112
Lois, get in here!

225
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:54,616
Lois, explain this
column of figures.

226
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:57,619
Chief, the president's
coming on live.

227
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,121
Oh, he is? Oh.

228
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:01,123
I doubt
it's good news.

229
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,125
It won't be
that terrible.

230
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,627
Hopefully,
very terrible, miss lane.

231
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,629
We could double
our circulation

232
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,132
With a good
international crisis.

233
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,634
And because
the summit has failed,

234
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,636
We have no choice

235
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:17,639
But to strive
to be second to none

236
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,641
In the nuclear arms race.

237
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:24,146
Therefore, I am announcing 
the following measures--

238
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:30,652
I know you're all upset
by the crisis.

239
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:34,656
The best thing we can do
is think positively.

240
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:38,160
Now, is there
anything we can do?

241
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,162
Doesn't anyone
have a suggestion?

242
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:43,165
All right.

243
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,167
I'll make a suggestion.

244
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,170
Let's write
our congressmen.

245
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,172
That'll do
a lot of good.

246
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:54,176
Somebody has to be
an optimist.

247
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,677
Jeremy?

248
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,182
What can we do
about the crisis?

249
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,683
He doesn't know
what's happening.

250
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:06,688
I'D write a letter to someone
that would do some good.

251
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:08,190
Who, Santa Claus?

252
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,692
No! Superman!

253
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:13,195
Superman, the subject
of our newest exhibit,

254
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:16,198
Has graciously donated a strand
of his hair to the museum,

255
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:19,701
So we can see how strong
he really is.

256
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:22,704
Here you can see
a 1,000-pound load

257
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,706
Easily suspended
by his single hair.

258
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:27,209
The museum will
be closing soon,

259
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,212
So we should
hurry a little.

260
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:34,216
You know what
I can do with that hair?

261
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:37,719
You can make
a toupee that flies.

262
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,221
That hair is a sample

263
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:41,223
Of Superman's
genetic material,

264
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,725
The building blocks
of his body.

265
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:47,229
With enough nuclear power
to mutate the genes,

266
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:52,234
I can create a being who's
more powerful than him,

267
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:55,737
Who has total
allegiance to me.

268
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:05,747
You better
stand back.

269
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:08,250
Keep your eye out.

270
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,698
You wanted
to see me?

271
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:42,701
Yeah, hi, Clark.
Please, come in.

272
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:45,704
I've come up with
a brilliant idea.

273
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:47,206
Oh...really?

274
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:49,208
Well, daddy thinks
it's brilliant.

275
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,210
You'll write this new series

276
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,212
Called Metropolis after hours.

277
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:55,214
Who, me? I...

278
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,216
It's wonderful.

279
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:59,218
It's great,
isn't it?

280
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:01,220
I'm not
right for this.

281
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,222
You're perfect
for it.

282
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:04,223
You're young,

283
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:06,225
You're single,
you're successful.

284
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:08,727
I'm usually
in bed by 10:30.

285
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:11,230
That's just it.
You don't flaunt it.

286
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,732
You're no slave
to fashion, although...

287
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,734
Have you considered 
using contacts?

288
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:18,737
Uh, they, uh,
make my eyes itch.

289
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:22,741
Listen, I thought we
could do this together.

290
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:25,244
I know all
the right places.

291
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:27,746
I belong
to the right clubs.

292
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:29,748
We'll start tonight
at the metro club.

293
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:31,250
Oh, tonight?

294
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,751
Yeah. It's a date.

295
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,253
A date?

296
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:35,254
A date?

297
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:37,756
Uh, well, it's just 
business, actually.

298
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:41,760
I've got a letter
for Superman, care of me.

299
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,762
Superman
gets mail here?

300
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:46,265
It's probably just
a picture request.

301
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:47,266
I could look after
it for you, lois.

302
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,768
I think it's more
than a fan letter.

303
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:51,770
I think you
should read it.

304
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,274
"Dear Superman,
my teacher is speaking

305
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:57,276
"About the president's
speech on the arms race.

306
00:21:57,276 --> 00:22:01,780
"We're all
very unhappy about it,

307
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,283
"And I said
we should get Superman

308
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,285
"To rid the world
of nuclear arms

309
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:09,788
Because only
he could do it."

310
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,793
"Everybody thinks
I'm a space cadet.

311
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:16,295
"Once you've destroyed
all nuclear missiles,

312
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:17,296
"They'll see
I was right.

313
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:18,297
"Superman can make sure

314
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:19,798
"We don't blow
ourselves up.

315
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:22,801
"Thanks a lot. I know
you'll come through.

316
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:24,803
Your friend, jeremy."

317
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:25,804
Poor kid.

318
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:28,307
I'll get back to work.

319
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:30,309
There's an angle
in this.

320
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,311
An angle?
He's just a kid!

321
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:34,313
Daddy loves whipping
up campaigns,

322
00:22:34,313 --> 00:22:36,315
And the public
loves it!

323
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:38,317
Lacy!

324
00:22:38,317 --> 00:22:40,319
We're going to make
this kid a celebrity.

325
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:42,321
Everybody in the world
will wonder

326
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:44,823
What Superman's 
reply is.

327
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:50,329
Welcome to
Metropolis, jeremy.

328
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:51,830
I'm Mr. Warfield,

329
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:53,832
And this is
my daughter lacy.

330
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:54,833
Hi, jeremy.

331
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:56,835
Now come along
and meet the press.

332
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:57,836
Have a good trip?

333
00:22:58,337 --> 00:22:59,338
Car had a flat.

334
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:00,839
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

335
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:04,343
Here, let everybody
get a picture of you.

336
00:23:04,343 --> 00:23:05,344
That's it, everyone.

337
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:06,345
Jeremy, over here.

338
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:07,846
What a boy!

339
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:08,847
Now, come along,

340
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:12,351
And tell the American public
what you told me.

341
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:15,854
I said I wish Superman
would've said yes!

342
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:16,855
Did you get that?

343
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:17,856
Man: no, we didn't.

344
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:18,857
Say it again...

345
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:20,359
Loudly.

346
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:23,862
I said I wish Superman
would've said yes.

347
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,872
Miss lane. Miss lane.

348
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:35,374
Take a look at this.

349
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:37,376
Hot off the press.

350
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:38,877
Oh, my god!

351
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:41,380
This time, he's
gone too far.

352
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,382
Look, Clark.

353
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:45,384
Can't wait for
the chief's reaction.

354
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:48,887
I'm through
taking it lying down!

355
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:50,889
Anybody wants me,
I'll be downtown!

356
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:53,392
Chief look
different to you?

357
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:57,396
He looks like my father 
asking for a loan.

358
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:59,898
I'll make sure
he's all right.

359
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:00,899
Look, Clark,

360
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:03,402
There's nothing
we can do about it.

361
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:05,404
It's Superman's
decision now.

362
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:07,406
I'm sure he'll do
the right thing.

363
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:49,948
May the elders
watch over you, my son.

364
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,953
Their wisdom
is all that is left

365
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:57,956
Of a once powerful
and enlightened planet.

366
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:02,961
You must listen
to them, Kal-El.

367
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,465
Listen.

368
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:13,472
I know I'm forbidden
to interfere,

369
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,974
And yet the earth
is threatened

370
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:18,477
By the same fate
as Krypton's.

371
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:21,480
The earth
is too primitive.

372
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,482
You can flee
to new worlds

373
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:25,984
Where war is
long forgotten.

374
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:27,986
If you teach
the earth

375
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,989
To put its fate
in any one man,

376
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,491
Even yourself,

377
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:35,494
You're teaching them
to be betrayed.

378
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:39,498
Betrayed.

379
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:40,999
Betrayed.

380
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,501
Betrayed!

381
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:44,419
Betrayed!

382
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:49,550
And because
the summit has failed,

383
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,552
We have no choice

384
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:55,556
But to strive
to be second to none

385
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:58,559
In the nuclear arms race.

386
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,561
To that end,

387
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:04,064
This administration
has pursued,

388
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:06,567
And will continue
to pursue...

389
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,572
Therefore--

390
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,577
Just a minute.

391
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,081
Lois.

392
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:23,083
There you are!
What happened?

393
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:25,085
What do you mean?

394
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:28,088
"Meet me at 6:00 for
the press awards.

395
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:29,590
Wear something
really nice

396
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,091
And don't be late."

397
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:33,594
Were we discussing
some other lois?

398
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,596
I'm sorry.
I completely forgot.

399
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:38,098
OK, get dressed,
and we'll go.

400
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,101
I'D rather not,
if you don't mind.

401
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:43,103
I've got thinking to do,

402
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:45,606
But you go ahead, OK?

403
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:49,109
Clark...

404
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:52,112
Something's wrong,
isn't it?

405
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,114
Hmm?

406
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:57,618
Is there anything
I can do?

407
00:26:58,118 --> 00:27:00,120
Yes, as a matter
of fact.

408
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:03,123
Could we get
some fresh air?

409
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,127
Fresh air?

410
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:08,128
Fresh air.

411
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:11,632
Fresh air! Sure!
Sure, Clark. Sure.

412
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:13,634
Who needs rubber chicken
and speeches anyway?

413
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:16,637
Come on, let's get
some fresh air.

414
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:18,639
Breathe really deep.

415
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:21,642
Breathe.
Do you feel better?

416
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:24,645
Clark? Clark! Clark!
Things aren't that bad!

417
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:27,648
Clark, stop!
Oh, Clark!

418
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:29,650
Clark! Clark!

419
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:40,661
Superman!

420
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,682
You OK?

421
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:02,683
Great.

422
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:15,696
Hey, look at that.

423
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:28,709
Ready? There you
go! Bye-bye!

424
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:00,240
How'd you like
going solo?

425
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,742
I loved it...

426
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:04,745
But not as much
as being with you.

427
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:07,748
I needed to be
with you, too.

428
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:09,750
You make me laugh.

429
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:14,254
You're the only one
I can talk to.

430
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:18,258
Sometimes, I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

431
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,761
I'm always
here for you.

432
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:22,262
You know that.

433
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:24,264
You'll do
the right thing,

434
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:26,266
No matter
what it is.

435
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:27,768
You always have.

436
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:29,269
Thank you.

437
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:31,271
You know something?

438
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:32,272
What?

439
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:34,775
You don't even
know my name.

440
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:36,276
Kal-El.

441
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,280
You remember,
don't you?

442
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,283
I remember
everything.

443
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:46,787
"Never set one of them
above the rest.

444
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:48,789
Love all humanity
instead."

445
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,293
That's not fair.

446
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,821
Lois.

447
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:23,824
Time to go.
We'll be late.

448
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:25,325
Huh?

449
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:29,830
What am I doing out here
freezing my butt off?

450
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,833
Oh, you wanted
some fresh air.

451
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:33,834
That's OK.

452
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:36,336
I don't want
to catch a cold.

453
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:38,338
I feel kind of weird.

454
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:41,842
I feel like
I have jet lag.

455
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:42,843
Jeepers.

456
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:44,344
Isn't that crazy?

457
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:45,345
Yeah.

458
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:47,848
How about you?
You still down?

459
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:49,850
Nope. Things are
pretty clear.

460
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:53,854
Good. Too much thinking
wears down your batteries.

461
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:59,359
Clark, you got to
go with your gut.

462
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,360
Mmm.

463
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,862
Come on.

464
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:08,660
OK, here you go,
jeremy.

465
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:11,163
Mr. Warfield
wants shots of you

466
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,165
With lots
of local color.

467
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:15,667
I can't find
anything special.

468
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:16,668
Hi, jeremy.

469
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:18,670
Superman!

470
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,671
Jimmy.

471
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:21,673
What a scoop!

472
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:23,675
Want to take
a walk with me?

473
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:25,677
Sure! OK!

474
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:28,180
Jimmy, come on.

475
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:43,195
You can't!
You'll get towed!

476
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:46,698
Do you know what
a ticket costs here?

477
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:48,700
Lacy, it's only money!

478
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:59,711
Wait for me upstairs
in the gallery.

479
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:01,213
Sure. OK.

480
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:02,714
Good luck,
Superman.

481
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:04,716
Thanks.

482
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:15,227
I saved you a seat.

483
00:32:16,228 --> 00:32:17,729
Yay!

484
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:21,233
All right, Superman!

485
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:25,237
Madame secretary, I don't
represent any country,

486
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:27,739
But I'd like
to address the delegates.

487
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:31,743
In that case,
you will need a sponsor.

488
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:35,747
I believe that will do.

489
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:36,748
Please.

490
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:42,254
Thank you.

491
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:45,757
What's he going to say?

492
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:48,260
Something wonderful.

493
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,262
Madam secretary,

494
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:52,764
Honorable delegates,

495
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:54,766
Ladies and gentlemen.

496
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:56,768
For many years now,

497
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:59,771
I've lived among you
as a visitor.

498
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:02,274
I've seen the beauty
of your many cultures.

499
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:06,778
I've felt great joy in your
magnificent accomplishments.

500
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:10,282
I've also seen
the folly of your wars.

501
00:33:10,282 --> 00:33:12,284
As of today, I'm not
a visitor anymore

502
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:17,289
Because the earth
is my home, too.

503
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:18,290
We can't live in fear.

504
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:22,294
I can't stand idly by
and watch us

505
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:25,797
Stumble into the madness
of possible nuclear destruction.

506
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:28,300
And so,
I've come to a decision.

507
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:32,304
I'll do what our governments
haven't done.

508
00:33:32,304 --> 00:33:33,805
Effective immediately,

509
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:37,309
I'll rid our planet
of all nuclear weapons.

510
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:39,311
Yay!
Yay!

511
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:42,314
Yay, Superman.

512
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:46,318
Way to go, Superman!

513
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:53,825
Superman!

514
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:05,546
Missile test alpha.
All systems go.

515
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:08,549
4, 3, 2, 1.

516
00:35:57,783 --> 00:35:58,784
Oh! Hello!

517
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:00,786
Nice to see you guys!

518
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:05,791
Why don't you
just relax there?

519
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:08,293
I'll get on with
the introductions.

520
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:09,795
Dixie...

521
00:36:09,795 --> 00:36:11,296
And Trixie.

522
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:17,803
From the land of the free
and the great cost overrun,

523
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:19,805
Harry howler,
nuclear strategist

524
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:21,807
From America's
top think tank

525
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:24,810
And a great warmonger
in his own right.

526
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,312
A hearty bienvenue
to Jean Pierre Dubois,

527
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:30,816
Nuclear warhead dealer
to the world.

528
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:32,317
His motto is,

529
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:35,320
"If you didn't
buy it from Jean Pierre,

530
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,824
You didn't buy it
on ze black market."

531
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:40,325
General Romoff.

532
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:44,830
A lot of people think of you
as the mad Russian.

533
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:49,334
I like to think of you
as just madly eccentric.

534
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:50,836
Please, be seated.

535
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:55,841
I know you guys
are overcome with joy

536
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:59,845
Now that Superman
has ended the arms race,

537
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:02,848
But if we work together,

538
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,350
We can make
the world safe...

539
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,852
For war profits.

540
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:08,353
Make your point.

541
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:09,855
I, Lex Luthor,

542
00:37:09,855 --> 00:37:12,858
The greatest criminal mind
of the modern era,

543
00:37:12,858 --> 00:37:14,359
Have discovered a way
to destroy Superman.

544
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,863
Behold,
my unscrupulous friends.

545
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:21,867
Shut those blinds!

546
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:24,369
The sun is
hurting my eyes!

547
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:27,372
Exactly.
You know what the sun is?

548
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:29,374
It's a huge nuclear bomb

549
00:37:29,374 --> 00:37:31,877
With so much
radiation in it,

550
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:34,880
It could incinerate
the average man like that!

551
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,884
Yes, but Superman
is no average man.

552
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:40,385
Aha! Right.

553
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:43,388
What is your plan?

554
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:47,893
Boys, old lex here has
kind of a secret recipe,

555
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:51,897
A genetic stew
in this dish, if you will.

556
00:37:51,897 --> 00:37:55,901
If you'll put this
on one of your missiles,

557
00:37:55,901 --> 00:38:00,405
Superman will have the biggest
surprise of his life.

558
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:03,408
I'll introduce him
to his first nightmare--

559
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:05,410
A nuclear man.

560
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,411
He'll pierce his skin.

561
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:08,914
He'll make him mortal.
He'll become sick.

562
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:11,917
We'll dance on his grave.

563
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:15,921
Why should we deal
with a scoundrel like you?

564
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:17,422
Remember my motto,

565
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:19,925
"The more fear you make,
the more loot you take,"

566
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:22,427
And the more missiles
you guys sell.

567
00:38:22,427 --> 00:38:26,431
Yes,
but what's in it for you?

568
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:29,935
A tiny commission.

569
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:32,938
Something appropriate.

570
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:35,941
A number...

571
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:38,944
With a lot of zeros
behind it.

572
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:47,452
Lenny.

573
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:49,454
The new
genetic material.

574
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:53,959
And now, leonard...

575
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:56,461
Your uncle lex,
with this protoplasm

576
00:38:56,461 --> 00:39:00,465
That I've grown from
Superman's hair cells...

577
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:04,970
Will duplicate
creation itself.

578
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,471
Ow.

579
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:08,473
Now the fabric.

580
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:13,478
Uncle lex, this ain't
gonna cover him.

581
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,984
The computer inside will
weave enough material

582
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:21,987
To maintain
the high moral standards

583
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:24,990
That I've always
subscribed to.

584
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:27,492
You know what
this means, uncle lex?

585
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:28,994
What?

586
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:31,496
We're going to
be parents!

587
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,362
What's your name,
sergeant?

588
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:04,863
York, sir!

589
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:06,865
At ease.

590
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:39,898
Launch control.
Yes, sir?

591
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:41,400
Yes, sir.

592
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,404
There's a weather problem.
We got a hold.

593
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:46,405
Hold?

594
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:48,407
What's your name, son?

595
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:49,408
Gorrham.

596
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,409
Gorrham, sir.

597
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:51,410
Gorrham, sir.

598
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,412
You know your code book?

599
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:54,913
Of course, sir.

600
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:57,416
It's a 2706,
inclement override.

601
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:59,418
On my command, fire.

602
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:01,920
Yes, sir.
Standby to launch.

603
00:41:03,422 --> 00:41:05,924
10, 9--

604
00:41:18,437 --> 00:41:19,938
Missed us.

605
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:40,227
Reach out!

606
00:42:40,227 --> 00:42:41,728
Come on!

607
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:44,231
Down!

608
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:46,233
Reach out!

609
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:48,235
And stretch!

610
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:49,736
Down!

611
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:51,238
Up!

612
00:42:51,238 --> 00:42:52,239
Oww! Ahh!

613
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:53,740
Clark,
are you OK?

614
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,242
I'll sit
this one out.

615
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:56,743
Oh, are you sure?

616
00:42:56,743 --> 00:42:59,746
But it's great
for your series.

617
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:01,748
Let's try it again.
Come on, let's start.

618
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:03,250
2...

619
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,252
3, 4...
3, 4...

620
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:07,254
1, 2, 3...

621
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:09,256
I don't think so.

622
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:11,258
Clark, are you OK?

623
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:21,268
48.

624
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:22,769
49.

625
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:24,771
23...Done.

626
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:26,773
OK, you try it now.

627
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:27,774
OK.

628
00:43:27,774 --> 00:43:31,778
Let's set it
a little higher for you.

629
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:33,780
Just push down.

630
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:37,784
Are you OK?

631
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:39,286
Need some help?

632
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:40,787
Just step down.

633
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:42,289
Thank you.

634
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:45,292
Your friend doesn't
know his own strength.

635
00:43:45,292 --> 00:43:47,294
Clark,
this is Paul.

636
00:43:47,294 --> 00:43:49,296
He's a trainer
here.

637
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:52,299
I got just
the thing for you.

638
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:53,800
Over here, Clarkey.

639
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,302
Clarkey?

640
00:43:58,305 --> 00:44:01,308
It's nice of him
to help me out.

641
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:03,310
Here, try this one.

642
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,312
Oh, Clark,
are you OK?

643
00:44:05,312 --> 00:44:06,313
Yeah.

644
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:07,314
Sorry.

645
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:09,316
No pain, no gain.

646
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:13,320
Jeez, what a jerk.

647
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,322
I never
realized it before.

648
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:19,326
I guess a lot of
people I know are jerks.

649
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:22,829
Maybe you think I'm one,
so you avoid me.

650
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:24,831
No, I don't think that.

651
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:27,835
I've just been really
busy, that's all.

652
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:31,839
You know lois is doing
that interview with Superman

653
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,841
About his peace mission?

654
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:37,845
Maybe the four of us
could meet for high tea.

655
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:39,847
It's very chic.

656
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:41,348
Paul: could you hand me
those weights, Clark?

657
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:42,850
Uh, excuse me.

658
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,852
Wait a minute,
lacy.

659
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:45,853
Come early.

660
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:47,855
The view is so romantic
from my balcony.

661
00:44:47,855 --> 00:44:48,856
See ya.

662
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:52,359
Oh, sure. Here.

663
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,862
Not those!
The other one!

664
00:44:54,862 --> 00:44:57,239
Uh...no pain, no gain?

665
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:09,334
What was that?

666
00:45:11,837 --> 00:45:14,339
Uncle lex,
you're spooking me out.

667
00:45:17,342 --> 00:45:18,844
There.

668
00:45:20,345 --> 00:45:21,847
Madam...

669
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:23,348
Thank you
very much.

670
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:25,350
Oui, Monsieur. 
Au revoir.

671
00:45:25,851 --> 00:45:27,352
Au revoir.

672
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:49,374
I'm incredible.

673
00:45:51,877 --> 00:45:54,880
Uncle lex, he's like...

674
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,382
He's beautiful.
He's perfect.

675
00:45:58,884 --> 00:46:00,385
Welcome home,
nuclear man.

676
00:46:00,886 --> 00:46:03,889
Your father's
happy to see you.

677
00:46:19,404 --> 00:46:22,908
The sun has given him
internally generated heat.

678
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:27,412
I'm, uh...

679
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:29,414
You are...

680
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:32,918
I'm...what?
I'm a genius?

681
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:35,921
I'm incredible!
 I'm...

682
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:38,924
You are nothing!

683
00:46:38,924 --> 00:46:40,926
I am the father now.

684
00:46:40,926 --> 00:46:41,927
You have my voice.

685
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:45,430
No, you have my voice.

686
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,933
Just remember,
I made you.

687
00:46:47,933 --> 00:46:50,435
You're just
an experiment, freako.

688
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:54,439
What's that?

689
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:55,941
Oh, no.

690
00:46:56,441 --> 00:46:57,943
I'm an experiment?

691
00:46:57,943 --> 00:46:59,444
I'm freako?

692
00:46:59,444 --> 00:47:01,446
I was just kidding!

693
00:47:01,947 --> 00:47:05,450
If anyone's freako here,
it's got to be me!

694
00:47:05,951 --> 00:47:07,452
Oh, wow!

695
00:47:07,452 --> 00:47:10,956
Oh, wow!
I'm break dancing! Hey!

696
00:47:10,956 --> 00:47:13,959
This rocks!
Hey! Oh! Whoa...

697
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,462
I made you.
I can destroy you.

698
00:47:17,462 --> 00:47:18,964
Destroy.

699
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:21,967
Destroy Superman now.

700
00:47:21,967 --> 00:47:25,470
You sweet thing!
But not quite yet.

701
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:26,972
Come here.

702
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:30,475
We'll discuss
when the proper time is.

703
00:47:37,482 --> 00:47:38,984
Uncle lex.

704
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,491
Oh, no!

705
00:47:46,992 --> 00:47:49,494
He's, like...
He's, like, cold.

706
00:47:49,995 --> 00:47:51,496
Of course he is.

707
00:47:51,997 --> 00:47:53,498
That's
his vulnerability.

708
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:56,001
That's the only way
he can be stopped.

709
00:47:56,001 --> 00:47:58,003
What?

710
00:47:58,504 --> 00:48:01,006
Lenny,
my loud-mouth nephew,

711
00:48:01,006 --> 00:48:03,008
He gets his energy
from the sun.

712
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:06,011
Without it, he's
like you at night...

713
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:07,012
Useless.

714
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:22,986
Nobody's perfect.

715
00:48:29,201 --> 00:48:30,702
You know, I never had
a double date before.

716
00:48:31,203 --> 00:48:34,206
This is fun.
How do I look?

717
00:48:34,206 --> 00:48:35,707
Illegal...

718
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:38,710
Like the last six
dresses you tried on.

719
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:40,712
Uh, listen, lacy,

720
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:43,215
I don't want
to burst your bubble,

721
00:48:43,215 --> 00:48:46,218
But Clark won't notice
what you're wearing.

722
00:48:46,218 --> 00:48:47,719
Yes, he will.

723
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:49,221
Oh, there's Clark.

724
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:51,223
You look great.

725
00:48:51,223 --> 00:48:53,225
Oh, maybe it's
just Superman.

726
00:48:53,225 --> 00:48:54,726
No.

727
00:48:54,726 --> 00:48:58,230
No, Superman makes
a different kind of entrance.

728
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:10,742
Hi, lacy.

729
00:49:10,742 --> 00:49:11,743
Hi, Clark.

730
00:49:11,743 --> 00:49:12,744
Could you break a 20?

731
00:49:12,744 --> 00:49:14,746
Driver didn't
have any change.

732
00:49:14,746 --> 00:49:17,249
Yeah, sure.
Let me get my purse.

733
00:49:17,249 --> 00:49:18,750
Hi, lois.

734
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,252
Hi, Clark.

735
00:49:20,252 --> 00:49:22,754
You won't believe
these questions

736
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:25,757
Mr. Warfield gave me
to ask Superman.

737
00:49:25,757 --> 00:49:30,262
"Are you part of a plot to
weaken our national defense?"

738
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:32,264
It's his gray matter 
that's weakened.

739
00:49:32,264 --> 00:49:35,267
How can I ask Superman
these questions?

740
00:49:35,267 --> 00:49:37,269
Uh, well,
politely, I guess.

741
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:40,272
Let's see,
I have $18 and...

742
00:49:40,272 --> 00:49:42,774
Clark, she really
likes you,

743
00:49:42,774 --> 00:49:44,276
So notice the dress.

744
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:46,778
My American express card.

745
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:47,779
Dress.

746
00:49:47,779 --> 00:49:49,781
Oh, hey! Neat dress!

747
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:51,783
Thanks. Be right back.

748
00:49:54,286 --> 00:49:56,788
Hey, what's that?

749
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:01,293
Now, there's a different
kind of entrance.

750
00:50:05,297 --> 00:50:06,298
Hi, lois.

751
00:50:06,298 --> 00:50:07,299
Hello, Superman.

752
00:50:07,299 --> 00:50:08,300
How are you?

753
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,302
I'm fine.

754
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:14,306
Oh! Um, Superman,
meet lacy Warfield.

755
00:50:14,306 --> 00:50:15,307
She's the boss' 
daughter.

756
00:50:15,307 --> 00:50:16,808
How do you do?

757
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:18,810
That's a very
attractive outfit.

758
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:21,813
I think we better
start our interview.

759
00:50:21,813 --> 00:50:23,315
Two's company.

760
00:50:23,315 --> 00:50:26,818
Oh, right! Yeah!
I'll go get Clark.

761
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:30,822
He's probably helping
the cab driver change a flat

762
00:50:30,822 --> 00:50:33,825
Or some other good deed.

763
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:36,328
Something
smells wonderful.

764
00:50:36,328 --> 00:50:37,829
Oh, thank you.

765
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:40,332
I'm cooking some
scallops and duck

766
00:50:40,332 --> 00:50:43,335
In this wonderful
mushroom sauce with champagne,

767
00:50:43,335 --> 00:50:46,338
In case we got
hungry afterwards.

768
00:50:46,338 --> 00:50:48,841
Uh...I mean, later.

769
00:50:50,342 --> 00:50:53,345
You shouldn't have gone
to all that trouble.

770
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:01,353
Should we get on
with the interview?

771
00:51:01,353 --> 00:51:04,356
Yes, let's get on with it.

772
00:51:04,356 --> 00:51:06,358
Um...

773
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:07,860
Um...

774
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,862
Have...have you had
any trouble

775
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:12,364
Confiscating
the missiles?

776
00:51:12,364 --> 00:51:14,366
There always was
the possibility

777
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:15,367
That some warped
individuals

778
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:17,369
Would take advantage

779
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:19,872
Of the world's
good will, but--

780
00:51:20,873 --> 00:51:22,875
Is there
something wrong?

781
00:51:26,879 --> 00:51:28,881
Oh, my dinner!

782
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:30,883
Um, I'll be 
right back!

783
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:46,899
Hi.

784
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:48,901
I missed you, Clark.

785
00:51:48,901 --> 00:51:52,404
It's so boring up there
with lois and Superman.

786
00:51:52,404 --> 00:51:54,406
Let's go do
something wild.

787
00:51:54,406 --> 00:51:56,408
That wouldn't
be polite.

788
00:51:56,408 --> 00:51:57,910
Yeah, you're right.

789
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:00,913
How can one man
be so square

790
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:03,916
And so delicious?

791
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:05,417
All right. Let's go.

792
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:06,418
If I have to
face Superman,

793
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:07,419
So do you.

794
00:52:07,419 --> 00:52:10,422
Ooomph! Uh...lacy.

795
00:52:11,924 --> 00:52:13,926
Oh, Clark.

796
00:52:13,926 --> 00:52:16,929
Uh...uh...stop.

797
00:52:34,947 --> 00:52:36,949
I don't believe it!

798
00:52:36,949 --> 00:52:39,952
I've never had a duck
turn out so perfectly!

799
00:52:39,952 --> 00:52:40,953
I'm out here, lois.

800
00:52:40,953 --> 00:52:43,956
Oh.

801
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:56,969
Isn't it beautiful?

802
00:52:57,469 --> 00:52:59,471
The city's beautiful.

803
00:52:59,471 --> 00:53:01,974
The whole world
is beautiful.

804
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:07,479
I've always felt moments
like this should be shared

805
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,983
With someone you
care a lot about.

806
00:53:13,485 --> 00:53:15,487
Isn't that
the doorbell?

807
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:17,489
Yes.

808
00:53:34,006 --> 00:53:35,507
Lacy.

809
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:38,010
Where's Clark?

810
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:39,511
Well, the elevator--

811
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:42,014
Never mind.
It's a long story.

812
00:53:42,514 --> 00:53:45,017
It always is
with Clark.

813
00:53:46,518 --> 00:53:48,520
Oh, great,
that's him!

814
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:51,023
Clark?

815
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:54,026
Hi. Those bellboys should
look where they're going.

816
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:55,527
Superman?

817
00:53:56,028 --> 00:53:57,029
Superman?

818
00:53:57,529 --> 00:53:59,531
Is dinner ready?
Can we eat?

819
00:54:00,032 --> 00:54:01,533
Yeah.
Let's go sit down.

820
00:54:02,034 --> 00:54:03,535
Oh, great.

821
00:54:06,038 --> 00:54:07,539
Ohhh! Sorry!
Oh, dear.

822
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,541
Oh, no, that's OK.

823
00:54:10,042 --> 00:54:11,543
Just leave it
there, Clark.

824
00:54:12,044 --> 00:54:14,046
Let me
just get a rag.

825
00:54:14,546 --> 00:54:15,881
Be right back.

826
00:54:19,468 --> 00:54:20,969
Where's Clark?

827
00:54:23,972 --> 00:54:25,974
Lex:?? Hello, dolly??

828
00:54:25,974 --> 00:54:27,476
?? Hello, dolly??

829
00:54:27,976 --> 00:54:31,480
?? It's so nice to have
me back where I belong??

830
00:54:32,981 --> 00:54:34,483
Don't be concerned,
blue boy.

831
00:54:34,983 --> 00:54:35,984
Only you can hear me.

832
00:54:36,485 --> 00:54:37,986
It's my own
private frequency.

833
00:54:37,986 --> 00:54:39,488
You might
call this lex TV.

834
00:54:39,488 --> 00:54:43,492
Look to your left,
tall, dark, and handsome.

835
00:54:43,492 --> 00:54:46,495
I'll blow 20 stories
off that building...

836
00:54:46,495 --> 00:54:49,998
Give or take
a floor or two. Peace.

837
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,501
Men.

838
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:55,504
I hope Clark's OK.
I better look.

839
00:54:55,504 --> 00:54:56,505
OK.

840
00:54:59,508 --> 00:55:00,509
I'm sorry.

841
00:55:00,509 --> 00:55:02,010
An emergency's
come up.

842
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:04,012
My apologies
to miss Warfield.

843
00:55:04,012 --> 00:55:05,514
Oh, but--

844
00:55:05,514 --> 00:55:06,515
Superman!

845
00:55:07,015 --> 00:55:08,016
Take me with you!

846
00:55:08,016 --> 00:55:11,019
I could
cover the story!

847
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:13,021
Have you seen Clark?
Huh?

848
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:23,031
Guess who.

849
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:25,534
It's your old friend lex.

850
00:55:27,035 --> 00:55:29,037
If you'd
planted a bomb,

851
00:55:29,037 --> 00:55:32,040
You'd be miles
from here by now.

852
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,042
This is my nephew Lenny.

853
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:35,544
He worships me.

854
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:37,546
The dude of steel.

855
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:40,048
Boy, are you
gonna get it!

856
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:44,553
Silly me, thinking
I could fool the super guy.

857
00:55:44,553 --> 00:55:48,056
You're right. No bomb.

858
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:49,057
It's just
that you're so involved

859
00:55:49,558 --> 00:55:51,059
In this world peace bit,

860
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,062
You don't have time
for social calls.

861
00:55:54,563 --> 00:55:55,564
I confess.

862
00:55:56,064 --> 00:55:57,566
I tricked you.

863
00:55:57,566 --> 00:55:59,067
You look great.

864
00:55:59,568 --> 00:56:02,571
Enough small talk.
What are you up to?

865
00:56:02,571 --> 00:56:05,073
You know,
you're a workaholic.

866
00:56:05,574 --> 00:56:08,577
You're playing a good guy
24 hours a day.

867
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:11,580
Why don't you stop
and smell the roses?

868
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,583
Get yourself a pet--
a kitten, a puppy.

869
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:16,585
You hate children
and animals.

870
00:56:17,085 --> 00:56:19,087
Why are you
in Metropolis?

871
00:56:19,087 --> 00:56:23,592
I want to introduce you
to the new kid on the block.

872
00:56:37,105 --> 00:56:39,107
Look closely at
the cell structure.

873
00:56:39,608 --> 00:56:42,110
You see
anything familiar?

874
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:45,113
You've already broken
all the laws of man.

875
00:56:45,614 --> 00:56:48,116
Now you've broken
the laws of nature, too.

876
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:51,119
You must have
hidden a device

877
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:53,622
On a missile
I hurled into the sun.

878
00:56:53,622 --> 00:56:57,125
You know, Mr. Muscle,
I'll miss our chats.

879
00:56:57,125 --> 00:57:00,128
You're the only one
that could keep up with me.

880
00:57:00,128 --> 00:57:01,129
Lenny!

881
00:57:01,129 --> 00:57:03,131
What?

882
00:57:03,632 --> 00:57:05,634
I want to
propose a toast.

883
00:57:06,134 --> 00:57:07,636
To a nice guy...

884
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:10,639
Who's about
to finish last.

885
00:57:11,139 --> 00:57:13,141
Arrr!

886
00:57:14,142 --> 00:57:15,644
Destroy Superman!

887
00:57:15,644 --> 00:57:17,145
Later.

888
00:57:17,145 --> 00:57:19,147
He's a little bit
anxious.

889
00:57:19,648 --> 00:57:20,649
Can you blame him?

890
00:57:20,649 --> 00:57:24,653
Not one of
your great thinkers.

891
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:27,656
But I, in all modesty, am.

892
00:57:27,656 --> 00:57:29,658
The touching thing
about this plan

893
00:57:29,658 --> 00:57:32,160
Is you helped me devise it.

894
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,163
Prison twisted your mind
into a delusionary state.

895
00:57:35,163 --> 00:57:37,666
No, no, no. Listen.

896
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:40,669
I escaped from prison
with one thing on my mind--

897
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:43,172
The end of Superman.

898
00:57:43,172 --> 00:57:46,175
So there I was,
the first time ever

899
00:57:46,175 --> 00:57:48,677
That I didn't
have a long-range,

900
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:50,679
Truly devious
criminal scheme.

901
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:53,682
And then
I came up with it.

902
00:57:53,682 --> 00:57:55,184
With this guy

903
00:57:55,184 --> 00:57:56,685
And you gone,

904
00:57:56,685 --> 00:57:59,688
I'll make a fortune
rearming the world.

905
00:57:59,688 --> 00:58:03,192
You'd risk nuclear war
for your financial gain?

906
00:58:03,192 --> 00:58:05,194
Nobody wants war.

907
00:58:05,194 --> 00:58:08,197
I just want to keep 
the threat alive.

908
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:12,201
Nifty, huh?

909
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,166
Good night,
sweet prince.

910
00:58:20,667 --> 00:58:22,669
Parting is...

911
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:24,171
Inevitable.

912
00:58:25,172 --> 00:58:27,674
Destroy Superman!

913
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:30,177
First, I have fun.

914
00:58:50,197 --> 00:58:51,198
Aah!

915
00:59:31,238 --> 00:59:32,739
Aah!

916
00:59:34,241 --> 00:59:35,742
Help me!

917
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:45,752
Thank you, Superman.

918
01:01:08,836 --> 01:01:10,838
Santa Maria...

919
01:01:57,885 --> 01:01:59,887
Oh!

920
01:01:59,887 --> 01:02:01,889
Oh!

921
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:03,891
Un gran miracolo.
Grazie.

922
01:02:22,117 --> 01:02:24,620
Eeyi! Hah!

923
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,622
Aah!

924
01:03:47,202 --> 01:03:50,205
Aah!

925
01:04:08,724 --> 01:04:10,726
Oh!

926
01:04:32,247 --> 01:04:34,249
Arrrgh!

927
01:04:40,756 --> 01:04:41,757
Arrrgh!

928
01:04:53,769 --> 01:04:56,271
Aah!

929
01:05:06,782 --> 01:05:08,784
Yaaa!

930
01:05:21,213 --> 01:05:21,839
I said I'd get you

931
01:05:22,339 --> 01:05:25,342
To run one
of our papers yourself,

932
01:05:25,843 --> 01:05:27,344
And I meant it.

933
01:05:27,845 --> 01:05:29,346
Congratulations,
miss publisher.

934
01:05:29,847 --> 01:05:33,350
Thank you, daddy.
That's very nice.

935
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:35,352
Step into
your office.

936
01:05:37,354 --> 01:05:39,356
Where'd this
come from?

937
01:05:39,356 --> 01:05:41,358
Oh, somebody
brought it in.

938
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:43,360
We bought it cheap.

939
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:46,864
OK. This time you have
both gone too far.

940
01:05:46,864 --> 01:05:49,867
You can print your rag
without lois lane.

941
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:56,373
And you certainly have
no right to this.

942
01:05:56,373 --> 01:05:58,375
Lois, I'm sorry.

943
01:05:58,375 --> 01:06:00,377
Oh, let her go, 
darling.

944
01:06:00,377 --> 01:06:02,379
I mean,
she's useless.

945
01:06:02,379 --> 01:06:05,382
And while you're at it,
fire that Clark Kent.

946
01:06:05,382 --> 01:06:07,384
He hasn't been around
or even telephoned.

947
01:06:07,384 --> 01:06:09,887
I know. I'm worried.

948
01:06:09,887 --> 01:06:12,389
Oh, kitten,

949
01:06:12,389 --> 01:06:14,391
Didn't we have
our little talk

950
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:15,893
About personal
involvement

951
01:06:15,893 --> 01:06:16,894
With the help?

952
01:06:16,894 --> 01:06:18,896
Now that you're 
the publisher--

953
01:06:19,396 --> 01:06:20,397
Daddy...

954
01:06:20,397 --> 01:06:21,398
Yes, darling?

955
01:06:21,398 --> 01:06:22,399
Stuff it!

956
01:06:24,902 --> 01:06:26,904
Lois?
Lois, I'm sorry.

957
01:06:26,904 --> 01:06:30,908
I promise you I had
nothing to do with that.

958
01:06:36,914 --> 01:06:38,916
Have you heard
from Clark?

959
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,421
No.

960
01:07:08,445 --> 01:07:10,447
Just a minute.

961
01:07:10,447 --> 01:07:13,450
Oh, lois. What are
you doing here?

962
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:15,452
I knew it.

963
01:07:15,452 --> 01:07:16,453
Oh, I've just,

964
01:07:16,453 --> 01:07:18,455
Uh...just got
a really bad flu.

965
01:07:18,455 --> 01:07:19,456
What do you mean
you knew it?

966
01:07:19,456 --> 01:07:20,958
How'd you know?

967
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:24,461
You haven't been to work.

968
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:26,463
You haven't called
the office.

969
01:07:26,463 --> 01:07:27,965
You haven't even
called me back.

970
01:07:28,465 --> 01:07:30,467
How could you not
call me back?

971
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:34,972
Whatever it is,

972
01:07:34,972 --> 01:07:36,974
I guess you've
got your reasons,

973
01:07:36,974 --> 01:07:41,478
But I knew you
were here, you know?

974
01:07:42,479 --> 01:07:43,981
Somehow...

975
01:07:43,981 --> 01:07:45,983
Somehow something
pulled me here.

976
01:07:45,983 --> 01:07:48,986
I always know when
Superman's in trouble.

977
01:07:48,986 --> 01:07:51,989
Ha ha! Superman?
Something's happened to him?

978
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:54,491
Everybody's saying
he's dead, but...

979
01:07:54,491 --> 01:07:57,494
It can't be true.
I just know it.

980
01:07:57,494 --> 01:07:59,997
I feel it in my heart.

981
01:07:59,997 --> 01:08:02,499
I think
he just needs help.

982
01:08:02,499 --> 01:08:06,503
Well, wherever he is, lois, 
I'm sure he'll manage.

983
01:08:06,503 --> 01:08:09,506
Well, if he can't...

984
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:11,508
Manage...

985
01:08:11,508 --> 01:08:14,011
And he really is...
In trouble,

986
01:08:14,011 --> 01:08:15,512
Then there's, uh...

987
01:08:15,512 --> 01:08:19,016
There's a few things
I'd like to tell him.

988
01:08:21,018 --> 01:08:23,020
I'D tell him...

989
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:26,523
That I will always
cherish the time

990
01:08:26,523 --> 01:08:28,525
We spent together,

991
01:08:28,525 --> 01:08:31,528
And I never expected
anything in return

992
01:08:31,528 --> 01:08:35,532
And no matter how few
minutes I saw him for,

993
01:08:35,532 --> 01:08:37,534
It always made me happy.

994
01:08:37,534 --> 01:08:42,039
And I would tell him...
That I love him,

995
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:45,542
And that
I'll always love him,

996
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:48,045
And that...whatever...

997
01:08:48,545 --> 01:08:50,547
Happens to the world, I...

998
01:08:50,547 --> 01:08:52,549
I know that...

999
01:08:52,549 --> 01:08:57,054
That he's doing his best
to make sure

1000
01:08:57,054 --> 01:08:59,556
That it'll be all right
for the rest of us.

1001
01:08:59,556 --> 01:09:02,059
Well, wherever he is,
lois,

1002
01:09:02,059 --> 01:09:04,061
I know that...

1003
01:09:04,061 --> 01:09:06,563
He would want
to thank you.

1004
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:14,571
Listen, I'm, um...

1005
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:16,073
I'm pretty tired,
you know,

1006
01:09:16,573 --> 01:09:18,575
So I think I'll 
just rest here

1007
01:09:18,575 --> 01:09:20,077
For a while, OK?

1008
01:09:20,077 --> 01:09:23,580
I'll be fine.
It's OK.

1009
01:09:24,081 --> 01:09:25,082
Please?

1010
01:09:28,085 --> 01:09:30,087
Well, I hope you
feel better, Clark.

1011
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:33,090
Thanks.

1012
01:09:39,596 --> 01:09:41,098
Um...

1013
01:09:41,098 --> 01:09:44,101
If...if you do
see him,

1014
01:09:44,101 --> 01:09:47,104
Um...or--or--or
hear from him,

1015
01:09:47,104 --> 01:09:50,607
He might need this.

1016
01:09:57,531 --> 01:10:00,200
Oh, lex,
we're all very pleased

1017
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:05,706
At all the nuclear missiles
and arms you've helped us sell,

1018
01:10:05,706 --> 01:10:09,710
And, uh, we've decided
to increase your commission.

1019
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:13,213
Oh, guys, really,
that's great.

1020
01:10:13,213 --> 01:10:15,716
It's the least
we could do.

1021
01:10:15,716 --> 01:10:17,718
Well, I have
another idea.

1022
01:10:17,718 --> 01:10:20,721
Gentlemen, I've decided

1023
01:10:20,721 --> 01:10:23,223
To assume control
of the company.

1024
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:33,734
My first official act
is to say, "you're fired!"

1025
01:10:35,235 --> 01:10:37,237
You're mad.

1026
01:10:37,237 --> 01:10:40,240
Oh, really?
Look at this.

1027
01:10:48,248 --> 01:10:51,251
If you want
a reference for work,

1028
01:10:51,251 --> 01:10:53,253
Forget it!

1029
01:10:56,256 --> 01:10:58,258
That was a good bit.

1030
01:10:58,258 --> 01:11:00,761
You know,
with my brains

1031
01:11:00,761 --> 01:11:04,264
And your...
Frankly, your brawn,

1032
01:11:04,264 --> 01:11:07,267
The possibilities
are absolutely staggering.

1033
01:11:07,267 --> 01:11:09,770
I could be president,
emperor, king.

1034
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:12,773
Did you see how scared
those guys were?

1035
01:11:12,773 --> 01:11:15,275
And what
do you fear?

1036
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:17,277
What? Now?

1037
01:11:17,277 --> 01:11:19,780
With Superman dead,
and you're on my team?

1038
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,782
It's like I'm the coach,

1039
01:11:21,782 --> 01:11:24,284
And you're the best
power forward ever.

1040
01:11:24,284 --> 01:11:25,285
What's to fear?

1041
01:11:38,799 --> 01:11:41,802
All that remains
of Krypton's energy

1042
01:11:41,802 --> 01:11:43,804
Is yours.

1043
01:11:43,804 --> 01:11:45,806
After it is gone,

1044
01:11:45,806 --> 01:11:49,810
You will belong solely
to your new home.

1045
01:11:50,811 --> 01:11:55,315
If our dying planet
can save your life, my son,

1046
01:11:55,315 --> 01:11:58,819
We have not died
in vain.

1047
01:12:43,989 --> 01:12:46,491
Rrraaarr!

1048
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:06,011
Where is the woman?

1049
01:13:06,512 --> 01:13:08,013
You'll never find her.

1050
01:13:08,013 --> 01:13:12,017
If you will not tell me,
I will hurt people.

1051
01:13:18,524 --> 01:13:20,526
Rooaarr!

1052
01:13:20,526 --> 01:13:24,029
Yaaaah!

1053
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:28,033
Rooaarr!

1054
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:35,541
Stop! Don't do it!
The people!

1055
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:43,549
Aah!

1056
01:13:47,553 --> 01:13:49,555
Yaaahh!

1057
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:15,581
Ohhh!

1058
01:14:29,595 --> 01:14:31,597
Easy, now, easy.

1059
01:14:31,597 --> 01:14:33,599
Slow, slow, slow.

1060
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,601
Stop! That's enough!

1061
01:14:35,601 --> 01:14:37,603
That's enough.

1062
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:39,605
You win.
I'll take you to her.

1063
01:14:52,034 --> 01:14:53,535
Raaarrgh!

1064
01:14:55,537 --> 01:14:56,538
Yaahh!

1065
01:14:57,039 --> 01:14:59,041
Rooaarr!

1066
01:15:11,053 --> 01:15:13,055
Where is she?

1067
01:15:13,055 --> 01:15:14,056
Far away from here
and safe.

1068
01:15:14,056 --> 01:15:16,558
Don't go in there.
She's not in there.

1069
01:15:22,064 --> 01:15:26,068
Ah...aahh...

1070
01:16:50,152 --> 01:16:52,654
Errr!

1071
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:03,165
Errrr!

1072
01:17:03,165 --> 01:17:06,168
Raarrr!

1073
01:17:52,714 --> 01:17:56,718
Grrrrr!

1074
01:17:57,219 --> 01:17:58,720
Aah!

1075
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:01,223
Uugh!

1076
01:18:03,725 --> 01:18:05,227
Aah!

1077
01:18:23,745 --> 01:18:26,748
Aaaahhh!

1078
01:18:31,753 --> 01:18:35,257
Aaarrrrgh!

1079
01:18:35,257 --> 01:18:38,260
Rrrarrrr!

1080
01:19:17,216 --> 01:19:19,927
We've got to tone down
these headlines.

1081
01:19:19,927 --> 01:19:21,428
Tone down our headlines?

1082
01:19:21,428 --> 01:19:23,931
Lacy, that's all
the common man reads.

1083
01:19:23,931 --> 01:19:26,433
We could do with
less sensationalism.

1084
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:28,936
Less sensational papers
go broke.

1085
01:19:29,436 --> 01:19:30,938
I taught you long ago

1086
01:19:31,438 --> 01:19:33,941
That the business of
newspapers is business.

1087
01:19:34,441 --> 01:19:34,942
No, daddy.

1088
01:19:35,442 --> 01:19:36,443
Our business
is journalism.

1089
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:38,445
We can't be
so irresponsible.

1090
01:19:38,946 --> 01:19:39,446
Otherwise,

1091
01:19:39,947 --> 01:19:41,448
We'll lead everyone
into a disaster.

1092
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:43,450
Don't be overdramatic.

1093
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:45,452
What kind of disaster

1094
01:19:45,452 --> 01:19:47,454
Could we possibly
bring about?

1095
01:19:47,955 --> 01:19:49,957
Raaaarr!

1096
01:19:49,957 --> 01:19:51,458
Lacy!

1097
01:20:32,499 --> 01:20:35,502
Aaahh...

1098
01:20:36,503 --> 01:20:37,504
Oh!

1099
01:21:24,051 --> 01:21:26,053
What's going on?

1100
01:21:42,069 --> 01:21:43,570
Are you sure
you know

1101
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:45,072
What you're doing,
Mr. White?

1102
01:21:45,072 --> 01:21:46,073
Well...

1103
01:21:46,073 --> 01:21:48,075
Uh...ahem.

1104
01:21:48,075 --> 01:21:50,077
Here comes
Mr. Warfield.

1105
01:21:50,077 --> 01:21:53,080
You'd better have
an explanation, white,

1106
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,582
Or you'll talk
to your lawyers from jail.

1107
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:58,085
You know, I'm not a tycoon.

1108
01:21:58,085 --> 01:22:00,087
I'm just
an old reporter,

1109
01:22:00,087 --> 01:22:03,090
But I've read enough
in my own newspaper

1110
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:05,592
About hostile takeovers
of big companies,

1111
01:22:05,592 --> 01:22:07,594
And you, Mr. Warfield,

1112
01:22:07,594 --> 01:22:09,096
Must have been
asleep at the wheel,

1113
01:22:09,596 --> 01:22:12,599
Because I convinced
the bankers of this city

1114
01:22:12,599 --> 01:22:15,102
That our Daily Planet
should be treated

1115
01:22:15,102 --> 01:22:19,106
Like a natural resource,
protected from predators,

1116
01:22:19,106 --> 01:22:21,108
So I convinced them
to lend me the money.

1117
01:22:21,108 --> 01:22:23,610
I bought up
the outstanding shares,

1118
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:28,115
And you, Mr. Warfield, are
now a minority shareholder.

1119
01:22:29,116 --> 01:22:30,617
Everyone back to work.

1120
01:22:30,617 --> 01:22:32,619
Way to go,
chief!

1121
01:22:32,619 --> 01:22:35,122
Ha ha ha ha ha! 
Yay!

1122
01:22:35,122 --> 01:22:36,123
I'm sorry.

1123
01:22:36,123 --> 01:22:38,125
You win some,
you lose some.

1124
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:41,128
Now, this is what
I call a newspaper.

1125
01:22:41,128 --> 01:22:43,130
Compliments of
the Daily Planet.

1126
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:45,132
Have a nice day!

1127
01:22:45,132 --> 01:22:46,633
We did it!
We're back!

1128
01:22:49,636 --> 01:22:51,638
Hi, everybody.
Am I late?

1129
01:22:51,638 --> 01:22:53,640
Hey, Mr. Kent.
No, he's not here yet.

1130
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,142
It must have been
an effort for you

1131
01:22:55,142 --> 01:22:57,144
To drag yourself
out of bed this morning.

1132
01:22:57,144 --> 01:22:59,146
I'm feeling better.

1133
01:22:59,146 --> 01:23:00,647
Had a visit from
a good nurse.

1134
01:23:00,647 --> 01:23:02,149
It must have been some
pretty good medicine,

1135
01:23:02,649 --> 01:23:04,151
Because miss lane said
you were really ill.

1136
01:23:04,651 --> 01:23:06,153
Jimmy, sometimes
all you need

1137
01:23:06,153 --> 01:23:07,154
Is some
loving attention

1138
01:23:07,654 --> 01:23:08,655
From the right
person.

1139
01:23:08,655 --> 01:23:10,157
Glad you're back,
Clark...

1140
01:23:10,157 --> 01:23:11,658
And remember...

1141
01:23:11,658 --> 01:23:13,660
I am covering
Superman's press conference.

1142
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:15,662
You just tape
crowd reactions.

1143
01:23:15,662 --> 01:23:17,664
Reactions, OK.

1144
01:23:17,664 --> 01:23:19,166
Oh, dear.

1145
01:23:19,166 --> 01:23:20,667
Guess I'll need 
a tape recorder.

1146
01:23:20,667 --> 01:23:21,668
Be right back.

1147
01:23:21,668 --> 01:23:23,170
Clark.

1148
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:26,173
Same old Mr. Kent.
He'll never change.

1149
01:23:26,173 --> 01:23:28,175
I hope not.

1150
01:23:28,175 --> 01:23:29,676
Whoo!

1151
01:23:35,182 --> 01:23:36,683
Hi, Superman.

1152
01:23:36,683 --> 01:23:39,186
Lois, good
to see you again.

1153
01:23:39,186 --> 01:23:41,188
Good to see you, too.

1154
01:23:41,188 --> 01:23:42,689
Morning, gentlemen.

1155
01:23:42,689 --> 01:23:44,191
Excuse me.

1156
01:23:44,191 --> 01:23:45,692
Thank you.

1157
01:23:45,692 --> 01:23:48,195
We've survived
the threat of war

1158
01:23:48,195 --> 01:23:50,197
And found
a fragile peace.

1159
01:23:50,197 --> 01:23:53,700
I thought I could give
you freedom from war.

1160
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:56,703
I was wrong.
It's not mine to give.

1161
01:23:58,205 --> 01:24:00,207
We're still
a young planet.

1162
01:24:00,207 --> 01:24:02,209
There are galaxies
out there,

1163
01:24:02,209 --> 01:24:04,711
Other civilizations
for us to meet,

1164
01:24:04,711 --> 01:24:07,714
To learn from.

1165
01:24:07,714 --> 01:24:10,217
What a brilliant future 
we could have.

1166
01:24:10,217 --> 01:24:12,219
And there will be peace

1167
01:24:12,219 --> 01:24:15,222
When the world's people 
want it so badly

1168
01:24:15,222 --> 01:24:19,226
That their governments will
have to give it to them.

1169
01:24:19,226 --> 01:24:23,730
I wish you could see
the earth as I do.

1170
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:27,234
When you really see it, 
it's just one world.

1171
01:24:31,071 --> 01:24:32,573
Think he'll find us?

1172
01:24:32,573 --> 01:24:36,577
Never. We'll lay low
for a while,

1173
01:24:36,577 --> 01:24:38,078
Couple of years.

1174
01:24:38,078 --> 01:24:41,081
I'll come up
with a new plan.

1175
01:24:41,081 --> 01:24:44,084
Whoa. Good thing
I brought my drums.

1176
01:24:54,094 --> 01:24:55,596
Oh, no!

1177
01:24:57,097 --> 01:24:59,600
Uncle lex,
you won't believe this,

1178
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,101
But it's...

1179
01:25:01,101 --> 01:25:02,102
Superman.
Superman.

1180
01:25:02,102 --> 01:25:04,104
Oh, wow!

1181
01:25:04,104 --> 01:25:05,105
Oh, wow!

1182
01:25:05,105 --> 01:25:09,610
Hey, this rocks! Hey!

1183
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:11,111
Morning, father.

1184
01:25:11,111 --> 01:25:12,613
Lenny's been under
a bad influence.

1185
01:25:12,613 --> 01:25:13,614
Think you can help him?

1186
01:25:13,614 --> 01:25:15,616
Every boy
can be helped.

1187
01:25:15,616 --> 01:25:17,618
I think you're right.
Good luck, son.

1188
01:25:17,618 --> 01:25:18,619
Come with me,
my friend.

1189
01:25:18,619 --> 01:25:21,121
Do you have 
a drum set?

1190
01:25:21,121 --> 01:25:24,625
Hey! Mozart's back!

1191
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:30,130
Dwayne,
mozart's back!

1192
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:32,132
I see him, Bubba!

1193
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:35,636
Shut up!

1194
01:25:37,137 --> 01:25:38,138
Marshal,
take him away.

1195
01:25:38,138 --> 01:25:39,139
Thank you kindly,
Superman.

1196
01:25:39,139 --> 01:25:40,140
Come on, Luthor.

1197
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:42,643
One thing--
how'd you beat him?

1198
01:25:42,643 --> 01:25:44,144
High school physics.

1199
01:25:44,645 --> 01:25:46,647
I figured
that if your creature

1200
01:25:46,647 --> 01:25:48,649
Was born from the sun,

1201
01:25:48,649 --> 01:25:50,651
That was
his energy source.

1202
01:25:50,651 --> 01:25:52,152
Will the world
be vaporized?

1203
01:25:52,152 --> 01:25:53,654
No, Luthor.

1204
01:25:53,654 --> 01:25:55,155
As always,
it's on the brink,

1205
01:25:55,155 --> 01:25:57,157
With good fighting evil.

1206
01:25:57,157 --> 01:25:58,659
See you in 20.
