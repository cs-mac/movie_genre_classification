00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:06,150
<i> When love goes wrong</i>

2
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:09,362
<i> Nothing goes right</i>

3
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:13,992
<i> This one thing I know</i>

4
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:16,786
<i> When love goes wrong</i>

5
00:01:16,953 --> 00:01:19,539
<i> A man takes flight</i>

6
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:24,085
<i> And women get uppity-oh</i>

7
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:35,471
<i> We're having a heat wave</i>

8
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:38,683
<i> A tropical heat wave</i>

9
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,812
<i> The temperature's rising</i>

10
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,480
<i> It isn't surprising</i>

11
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:46,482
<i> You certainly can</i>

12
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:54,866
<i> I started this heat wave</i>

13
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:58,995
<i> By letting my seat wave</i>

14
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:01,372
<i> And in such a way that</i>

15
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,207
<i> The customers say that</i>

16
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:05,752
<i> I certainly can</i>

17
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,962
<i> Can-can</i>

18
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:15,845
<i> We're having a heat wave</i>

19
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:18,431
<i> A tropical heat wave</i>

20
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,187
<i> The way that I move
that thermometer proves</i>

21
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:27,315
<i> That I certainly can</i>

22
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:35,448
<i> Can </i>

23
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:38,951
<i>Everyone remembers
their first job.</i>

24
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:41,913
<i>This is the story of mine.</i>

25
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,250
<i>I was the youngest
in a family of overachievers.</i>

26
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,544
<i>My father was a world-famous
art historian,</i>

27
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:51,297
<i>and my brother was ahead
of me in everything.</i>

28
00:02:51,464 --> 00:02:53,883
<i>I was always the disappointment.</i>

29
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,096
<i>I found my solace in the small cinema
I went to every Thursday night.</i>

30
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:02,225
<i>Alfred Hitchcock. Orson Welles.
Laurence Olivier.</i>

31
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:04,227
These were my heroes.

32
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:06,604
<i>I wanted to be a pan'
of their world.</i>

33
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:10,900
<i>When I was 23, I got my chance.</i>

34
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:13,277
Colin, come in.
Have you met James and Anna,

35
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:15,780
- my two very brilliant pupils?
- Hello.

36
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:18,908
- I'm off to London now, Pa.
- Your silly job interview.

37
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:21,119
Well, bonne chance, dear boy.

38
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,996
I can always get you
a research position at the V&A

39
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:28,459
once you've grown up a bit and got this
film idea out of your system.

40
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,378
- So I'm off now, Ma.
- Off?

41
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:34,090
- My job interview, Mother.
- Oh! Can't you stay for dinner?

42
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:36,217
There's nothing to eat, but I'm sure
the conversation will be charming.

43
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:37,343
I don't want to be late in the morning.

44
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,930
I'm sure they won't mind. You'll be
a famous film director in no time.

45
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,769
<i>I had everything to prove to my
family, but more to prove to myself.</i>

46
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:50,440
<i>Like every young man,
I had to make my own way.</i>

47
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,944
<i>So I decided to leave home</i>

48
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:57,155
<i>and join the circus.</i>

49
00:03:57,321 --> 00:04:00,616
- What do you want?
- A job on your next film.

50
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:02,201
You're an actor, aren't you?

51
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:03,953
No, I want to work
on the production side.

52
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,330
We don't start shooting
for another eight weeks.

53
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:10,001
- Come back nearer the time.
- May I wait until there's a job?

54
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,347
Vanessa!

55
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:25,725
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

56
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:30,271
There are no jobs.

57
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:32,190
I'll come back tomorrow
morning just in case.

58
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,358
It's a free country.

59
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,786
- Good morning.
- You're very determined.

60
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,663
Well, I'd do anything
to be in the film business.

61
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,333
Anything?

62
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,834
Sir Laurence Olivier Productions.

63
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:54,670
No, I'm afraid he's at Notley
till the end of the week.

64
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,883
- Vanessa asked me to...
- Oh, did she?

65
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:03,513
I need a number for Noel Coward.
It won't be in the book.

66
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:19,487
Hello, Vivien.
- Hello.

67
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:20,738
- Sir Laurence.
- Hughie!

68
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:23,074
Simply impossible to get Marilyn Monroe
on the telephone.

69
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:26,327
The darling girl spends
the entire day asleep.

70
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:28,746
- Hello, boy. Remind me.
Darling, you remember Colin.

71
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:32,834
- You met him at the Clark's party.
- Of course. What are you doing here?

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,585
You said there might be a job
on your film.

73
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:37,505
Have a cigarette.
Keep the pack.

74
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:38,923
Thank you, sir.

75
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,261
There won't be a film unless Miss Monroe
gets her splendid posterior out of bed.

76
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,721
The house committee is threatening
to withhold Miller's passport.

77
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,765
They say he's a communist.
No Arthur, no Marilyn.

78
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:49,475
I'll have a word with
the American ambassador.

79
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:53,229
I'm taking him to see Vivien's play on
Thursday. Terry's rewrites, are they in?

80
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:55,523
Not all of them, of course.
When did that ever happen?

81
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,694
He's the first actor since du Maurier
to have his own brand.

82
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:03,531
They pay him an absolute fortune.
I'm afraid they're rather ghastly.

83
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:06,450
Isn't he gorgeous, Vanessa?

84
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,286
I suppose he's all right.

85
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:13,040
Darling, you must do something for
Colin. You absolutely promised.

86
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,251
Hughie, let's try to
find him something to do.

87
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:16,627
- Yes. Of course.
- Come on, darling.

88
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,462
You'll look after my precious
Larrykins, won't you?

89
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,716
Come on, darling.
- Christ.

90
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:23,217
<i>Do you like it?</i>

91
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:24,760
<i>That's
absolutely splendid.</i>

92
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,471
<i>- You were absolutely born for it.
- Door.</i>

93
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,432
Sorry.

94
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:32,018
<i>And could you turn
all the way around, my darling?</i>

95
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,187
<i>- Thank you.
This is the dress Larry likes.</i>

96
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,690
<i>- There?
The camera's ravishing you.</i>

97
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:39,650
<i>Oh, dear.
That sounds serious.</i>

98
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,944
<i>That's wonderful.
- Too much?</i>

99
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,488
Oh, God. Not for me.
- Arthur Jacobs,

100
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,157
Miss Monroe's publicist,
is flying in tomorrow.

101
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:48,284
He wants to see the house
where she'll be staying.

102
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:50,077
Find something suitable.

103
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,163
<i>- Yes, sir.
More importantly,</i>

104
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,625
<i>- how does it make you feel?
- And leave the bloody tea.</i>

105
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,169
Oh. Sorry.

106
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:03,549
Out of the question. I can't have
a lot of awful film people traveling

107
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:05,384
- through the house in dirty boots.
- But we'd be paying

108
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:07,678
a hundred pounds per week
for 18 weeks.

109
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:10,181
- My wife would never agree.
- That's a pity, Mr. Cotes-Preedy.

110
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:12,683
I'll have to tell Miss Monroe
to look elsewhere, then.

111
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,270
- Marilyn Monroe?
- Yes.

112
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:20,066
Suppose I'd have to be introduced.

113
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:27,990
Good morning, Mr. Jacobs.
Hope you had a pleasant flight.

114
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:32,328
Is this the fucking car?

115
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:42,713
Who built this place?
Hansel and Gretel?

116
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,882
It's one of the best houses
in the area.

117
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:46,968
All right. We'll take it.

118
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,720
But ditch the wallpaper.
It's giving me a migraine.

119
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:55,017
That house was perfect for Marilyn.

120
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,186
- Can't use it now.
- Yes, we can.

121
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,564
I knew that Cotes-Preedy
wouldn't be able to keep this quiet,

122
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,775
so that's why when you asked me
to find a house for Miss Monroe,

123
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:04,360
I took the precaution of finding two.

124
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:07,238
So the other one, Parkside,
is much better.

125
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:08,906
And the owner is very discreet.

126
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:11,909
So we've got two expensive houses now
where we only needed one.

127
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:14,745
I thought that someone else
on the production might want it.

128
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,163
Oh, did you?

129
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,416
I guess Milton could use it

130
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,918
and it's near the studio. Near Marilyn.

131
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:24,922
What are we paying you, boy?

132
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:28,551
- Nothing, sir.
- Let's see to it, Hughie.

133
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:30,219
Well done, boy.

134
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,431
Nice job, kid.

135
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,437
Colin Clark,
Laurence Olivier Productions.

136
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:46,902
<i>The film was then
called The Sleeping Prince.</i>

137
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:51,032
<i>Marilyn was to play a naive American
showgirl called Elsie Marina</i>

138
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:55,453
<i>who is seduced by an Eastern-European
prince played by Olivier.</i>

139
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,538
<i>It was the lightest of comedies.</i>

140
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:04,045
- You in the union?
- No.

141
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,838
Then you can't have a job on the film.

142
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:07,548
Well, how do I get into the union?

143
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:09,258
By getting a job on the film.

144
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:12,011
It's called a closed shop.

145
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:15,556
I suppose I might be able
to do something for you.

146
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:19,477
The union owe me a few favors.
We don't have a third yet.

147
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:24,315
- A third?
- Third assistant director.

148
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:27,818
- You do know what the job is?
- Assisting the director?

149
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,987
That's the last thing you do!

150
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:33,866
Lesson one: thirds job is to
do whatever the fuck I tell him.

151
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,328
And what are you waiting for?

152
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,625
Colin!

153
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:45,294
Lesson two: don't shit
on your own doorstep.

154
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:46,395
- Got it?
- Got it.

155
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:50,466
Lesson three:
The third always stays nearby.

156
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:52,760
Not in some bloody palace in London.

157
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:55,096
Book a room at
The Dog & Duck down the road.

158
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,807
It's a bit rough. You'll get used to it.

159
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:01,393
Now make yourself useful.
Marilyn needs a bodyguard.

160
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,896
Sort something out.

161
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:07,441
I'm sure you understand the sensitive
nature of the job, Superintendent.

162
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,027
Something about looking
after a cinema actress?

163
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:13,030
Well, not just any actress.
Marilyn Monroe.

164
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,491
I never had much time
for the pictures.

165
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:16,867
Excellent.

166
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,036
For the next four months,

167
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:22,039
you never leave her side.
Day or night.

168
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:25,251
Her behavior is reputedly
a little erratic.

169
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,753
- She drinks?
- Amongst other things.

170
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,631
- Pills?
- It would be useful if you could, uh,

171
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,050
keep us informed of
her domestic situation.

172
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,135
You want me to spy on her.

173
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,555
Well, the odd early warning
if you know she's going to be late.

174
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,390
That kind of thing.

175
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:49,567
Hello.

176
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:52,236
Colin Clark. I booked a room.

177
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:54,989
Ah, right. Here you are.

178
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:56,866
Sign this.

179
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:00,244
What brings you up this way?

180
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,037
I'm working on a film at Pinewood.

181
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:03,789
Oh. What film is that?

182
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:07,418
It's called The Sleeping Prince. With
Sir Laurence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe,

183
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:10,754
so I'll be working with them.

184
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,840
Room's three quid a week.
First week in advance.

185
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:14,633
Number two.

186
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,513
And, uh, hope you don't mind,
you'll be sharing with Grace Kelly.

187
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,950
This'll work fine for Marilyn. Oh, and,
uh, Paula will need the room next door.

188
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,119
- I beg your pardon?
- Sorry, who is Paula?

189
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:44,872
Strasberg. Marilyn's acting coach.

190
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,540
She's nuts about the Method.

191
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,959
Arthur, we've spoken about this before.

192
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:52,171
Stanislavski and the Method are
perfectly fine in the rehearsal room,

193
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:54,465
but they don't belong on a film set.

194
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:55,925
Time is too tight.

195
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:01,555
Larry! Some good news.

196
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,974
House committee have decided
Miller isn't a communist after all.

197
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,392
Of course he is.

198
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,646
All those pain in the ass
New York intellectuals are Reds.

199
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:11,815
Which means she'll be flying
in next week on schedule.

200
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,318
- Excellent news.
- She'll have to be met.

201
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:16,487
Well, naturally Vivien and I
will be there to greet her,

202
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:19,073
but let's keep it low key, shall we?

203
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,492
You join us here at London Airport,

204
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:24,119
where it is absolute mayhem.

205
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:34,505
Marilyn! This way! Get out of the way!

206
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:52,356
With her is her new husband,
America's most celebrated playwright

207
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:55,025
and author of Death of a Salesman,
Arthur Miller.

208
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,863
Beautiful. You're looking at
tomorrow's front page, boys.

209
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,032
- We'll have to get them into the hall.
Sir Laurence Olivier

210
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:05,661
and Scarlett O'Hara herself,
Vivien Leigh, are set to greet them.

211
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:09,290
American acting royalty
meeting British acting royalty.

212
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:13,043
Gentlemen, it is my especial pleasure

213
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:17,214
to introduce a woman
who clearly needs no introduction.

214
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,550
Marilyn! How do you like being married?

215
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,885
Well, I like it. I like it a lot.

216
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,388
- Is this third time lucky?
- You bet it is.

217
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:27,057
Is it true you want to be
a classical actress now?

218
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:29,143
Well, I want to be
the best actress I can be.

219
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,062
There's a rumor you're going to be in
The Brothers Karamazov, on Broadway.

220
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:36,191
Ooh.
I'm... considering it.

221
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:37,568
Which of them will you be playing?

222
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:39,320
I'll be playing Grushenka.

223
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,489
- Can you spell that?
- Sure. Can you?

224
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,828
Vivien, you created
the role of Elsie on stage.

225
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,913
Have you any advice for Marilyn?

226
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,333
I am sure if Miss Monroe
needs any advice,

227
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,418
she'll get it from her director.

228
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:57,379
I hear he's terribly good.

229
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:58,797
Marilyn!

230
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,135
Are you happy with your last film?

231
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,387
Marilyn!

232
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:08,432
Is it true you wear nothing
in bed except perfume?

233
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:09,558
Ooh.

234
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:13,520
Darling, as I'm in England, let's say I
sleep in nothing but Yardley's Lavender.

235
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,329
Smile, Marilyn!

236
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,960
OK, let's get a snap of the newlyweds.

237
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,797
Smile, Arthur. It's not a firing squad.

238
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,800
This is some place you found.

239
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,135
You have my new assistant
Colin to thank for that.

240
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:48,138
Colin, this is Milton Greene.
You must be very nice to him.

241
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,808
He owns half of
Marilyn Monroe Productions.

242
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,976
- Forty-nine percent, Larry.
- Have a cigarette.

243
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,937
- I don't smoke.
- Really?

244
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:58,690
- And the studio, they want a new title.
- Nonsense.

245
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,610
Thank you very much.

246
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,158
Marvelous, isn't she?

247
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,994
She's all right.
Larry fell desperately

248
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:13,789
in love with her in New York.
He's determined to seduce her.

249
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:16,083
Yeah, but she's only
been married three weeks.

250
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,669
I thought you were a man of the world.

251
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:20,546
Of course, Larry would never leave me,

252
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:23,382
but if anything were to happen
you would tell me, wouldn't you?

253
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:28,011
- I'm sure he loves you very much.
- Oh, don't be such a boy.

254
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:30,472
I'm 43, darling.

255
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:36,186
No one will love me for very much
longer. Not even you.

256
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,913
What a wonderful adventure,
Dame Sybil.

257
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,540
Such a lark.

258
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:59,042
I long to see her.

259
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:18,729
Miss Monroe?

260
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:22,566
Sir Laurence sends his compliments.
He's ready for the read-through.

261
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,443
But Marilyn is not ready.

262
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,987
She's preparing.

263
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,741
Excuse my horrible face.

264
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,290
Ah! Marilyn, my dear.

265
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,461
Everyone is so excited to meet you.

266
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:44,796
Do... Come along, my darling, my angel.

267
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:48,425
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Marilyn Monroe.

268
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:51,261
Marilyn.
- How lovely you are.

269
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:54,640
- Here, I kept a place for you.
- I have to be next to Marilyn.

270
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,267
What a good idea.
I wish we could all bring a friend.

271
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,728
One does get so terribly nervous.

272
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:02,189
It's just like the first day
at school, isn't it?

273
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:05,192
So, welcome, dear Marilyn,

274
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,695
to our little fraternity.

275
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,114
We may seem a little strange

276
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:14,618
and, uh, quaint to you at first,

277
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,662
but I hope that in time,

278
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:20,874
you may come to find your
method in our madness.

279
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:24,378
So, my very noble
and approved good masters,

280
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:27,464
may we strive to create a work of art

281
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,759
that, led by your good graces,

282
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,928
will be cherished

283
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:36,640
as long as motion pictures

284
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,476
may be remembered.

285
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,233
Were you surprised
to get my invitation?

286
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,902
I'll say I was surprised.

287
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,280
I was so surprised, I couldn't
hardly think you meant me.

288
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:53,198
Oh, but of course I meant you.

289
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:56,326
I had your name most carefully
marked down in my program.

290
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,912
In matters of this kind,
I assure you I'm most methodical.

291
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,456
Who would you think I meant if not you?

292
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,502
Gee, Mr. Sir, I could just
listen to your accent all day.

293
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:08,380
Oh, you darling, Marilyn.

294
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:10,132
You're amongst friends now.

295
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:12,634
Just plain "Larry" will suffice, really.

296
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:15,470
That's so sweet.
Um, whenever you're ready.

297
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,556
Well, Maisie Springfield.

298
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,808
No, not Maisie Springfield.

299
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:22,853
She is quite what
I would call "old hat".

300
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,272
Remember why you're
in the embassy, Marilyn.

301
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:28,150
What does the Grand Duke
want from Elsie?

302
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:31,320
You came here and you thought...

303
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,405
from experience, Marilyn.

304
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,657
It's only a read-through, Paula.

305
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:39,703
Marilyn has to begin
finding the character.

306
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,622
Oh, the character's on the page.

307
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:45,000
The words, maybe. Not the character.

308
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,378
Aren't we going to have fun?

309
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:53,467
Well, we'll pick it up
whenever you like.

310
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,761
We should talk. Just us.
- Yeah.

311
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,054
Thank you so much.

312
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,140
We can't have two fucking directors!

313
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,559
- Marilyn wants Paula.
- Why? She's got me.

314
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,811
Paula's costing us two and a half
thousand bucks a week.

315
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,898
We might as well use her.
Listen, Larry.

316
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,692
Accept Marilyn on her
own terms and you'll be OK.

317
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,569
Try to change her
and she will drive you crazy.

318
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:16,073
- Trust me.
- Christ, what have I got myself into?

319
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,242
- Come outwith me tonight.
- I'm working.

320
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,578
- Well, tomorrow night, then.
- I'm washing my hair.

321
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,915
- But your hair's lovely.
- Look, I've got two rules.

322
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:26,583
Everyone has a lot of rules around here.

323
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,919
One, never touch the talent,

324
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:31,713
and two, never go outwith thirds.

325
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,048
Why not?

326
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:36,301
Because they're all randy little buggers
who just want some fun during shooting.

327
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:37,469
I'm not like that.

328
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,390
Really.

329
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:44,893
I'm free on Saturday.

330
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,187
Colin!

331
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,192
Quiet on set, everyone!

332
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,532
How kind of you to meet us.
Dear me, you do look cold.

333
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,242
They're ready for you
in makeup, Dame Sybil.

334
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:03,328
How exciting. Don't you love
the first day of a new production?

335
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:05,747
I don't know, Dame Sybil.
I've never had one before.

336
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:08,625
Oh, to be young again.

337
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,801
She has kept Dame Sybil Thorndike

338
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:20,053
and the entire company
waiting in full costume

339
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,391
for two hours, Mr. Orton,
and it is simply not fair.

340
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,621
I can't do this.

341
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,628
- What's wrong?
- She's nervous.

342
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,547
I'll deal With it.

343
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,511
Would you like to sit down,
Dame Sybil?

344
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,430
Oh, yes. Colin, how kind.

345
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:06,933
- Why don't we all sit down.
- Oi!

346
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,393
That chair is a prop.

347
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,853
- Props are NATKE.
- But I was...

348
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,690
If ACTT members are gonna start doing
NATKE jobs, I'm calling my men out!

349
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:14,858
He's right.
- Right.

350
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,777
I'm sure we're all good
union members here.

351
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,737
There's no need to fall out
over something so trivial.

352
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:22,991
It might be trivial to you,
Dame Sybil, but it's my livelihood!

353
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:26,119
Put the chair down. Now!

354
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,247
I rather think you've made your point.

355
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:32,083
Solidarity is the most
important thing here.

356
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,086
When unions fall out,
it's management that benefits.

357
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,924
If I see you doing a NATKE job again,

358
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,676
I will close this set down
quicker than you can blink.

359
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:43,470
- Dave!
- Yes?

360
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:45,013
Dame Sybil would like a chair.

361
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,891
Right. There you are.

362
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:51,853
I was on the picket lines
in 1926, you know.

363
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,649
Now that really was a strike.
We were all Bolsheviks then.

364
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:03,114
Ready. Camera running.

365
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:07,244
- Very quiet, everyone.
- Speed.

366
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,411
Five, take one.

367
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:09,663
Action.

368
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,498
Now, before you meet
my mother-in-law,

369
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:16,086
I must remind you she's a little vague
and can be very deaf on occasion.

370
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:18,547
My dear, such boredom.

371
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:22,092
The decorations hideous
and the music catastrophe.

372
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:24,469
Our friend, the ex-king
of Moravia, drove me home.

373
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,346
He's now called the Duke of Strelitz.

374
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,139
He cannot, of course,
go to the abbey tomorrow,

375
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:30,225
but he's most anxious you
should invite him to the room

376
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,102
you have taken at the Ritz for Nicky.

377
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:33,895
- Maud?
- Yes, ma'am?

378
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:37,774
There you are. I didn't see you. Give me
a glass of champagne I see over there.

379
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:41,695
- Olga Bosnia...
- Might I present Miss Elsie Marina?

380
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:44,823
Yes, my dear, of course.
I remember you well.

381
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,792
- Gee, I forgot my line.
- That's a cut.

382
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,587
- I'm sorry.
It's so easily done, isn't it?

383
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,630
I'm sure I went wrong somewhere there.

384
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,215
- Shall we have another go, Larry?
- Of course.

385
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:03,300
Action.

386
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,427
Yes, my dear, of course.

387
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:08,263
- I remember you well.
- Oh, I'm quite sure you don't,

388
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,223
Your Royal...

389
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,018
I mean Your, uh, Imperial, uh...

390
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:17,314
Serene Majesty?
- What does she say?

391
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,401
She says she's flattered and compliments
you on your wonderful memory.

392
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,236
<i>I'm in The Coconut
Girl at the Avenue.</i>

393
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:27,157
Didn't I have a line somewhere there?

394
00:23:27,224 --> 00:23:28,333
Cut.

395
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,703
- Action.
- Sweetly pretty.

396
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,705
She should use more mascara.

397
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:36,124
When one is young,
one should use a lot of mascara.

398
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:39,628
When one is old,
one should use much more.

399
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:45,008
<i>- What do you do, my dear?
- I'm in The Coconut Girl at the Avenue.</i>

400
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,260
- Dear?
- She says she's an actress.

401
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:51,973
- Cut it there.
- Print.

402
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:57,103
- Check the gate.
Gate's good.

403
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,980
That was perfect, Marilyn.

404
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:01,483
You were Elsie to the life.

405
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,986
I wonder, could we practice
our lines together later?

406
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:07,322
You'd be doing me such a kindness.

407
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:10,075
At my great age,
it's just so hard to make them stick.

408
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:12,994
- Why don't you come for tea tomorrow.
- Can I?

409
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:16,915
Sure.

410
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,920
She's impossible.
I should've cast Vivien.

411
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:26,007
If anyone can make her great,
it's you, sir.

412
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:29,260
Well let's just hope I'm as
brilliant as you think I am.

413
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:31,721
Now be a good boy
and keep an eye on her.

414
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:32,889
Yes, sir.

415
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,393
I can't
figure this stupid movie out.

416
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,063
You were wonderful, Marilyn. The
most gifted actress I have ever known.

417
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,732
- No.
- You were superb, Marilyn.

418
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:45,986
You were divine.
Have faith in your talent.

419
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,363
He was disappointed in me.

420
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,156
You are a great, great actress.

421
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:54,327
All my life, I have prayed for a great
actress I could help and guide.

422
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,248
- Oh!
- Like this, I prayed to God,

423
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:00,959
on my knees, and he has given me you.

424
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:03,878
You are that great actress, Marilyn.

425
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:05,922
Trust yourself.
Trust your talent.

426
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,049
- Come on, Paula, get up.
- No.

427
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:09,426
Not until you admit that you were great!

428
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,094
Oh!

429
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:13,388
- OK!
' Yes!

430
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:16,391
- I guess I was.
- Of course you were.

431
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,935
- There you are. Sorry.
- Thank you.

432
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,271
You really were very good, Miss Monroe.

433
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:23,523
Oh, thank you.

434
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:36,161
<i> Uno</i>

435
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:37,746
<i> Dos</i>

436
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:38,997
<i> Tres</i>

437
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:42,125
<i> Uno</i>

438
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:43,752
<i> Dos</i>

439
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:45,545
<i> Tres </i>

440
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:51,092
Are you sure you can afford all this?

441
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:52,969
It's fine.

442
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:54,763
Must be costing you a week's wages.

443
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,222
You are worth it.

444
00:25:58,183 --> 00:25:59,642
You're not the average third, are you?

445
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:01,561
I'm not living off my parents,
if that's what you mean.

446
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,104
I want to make my own way.

447
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:05,231
Will you be signing
on your father's account, sir?

448
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:07,358
Um, no, I'm gonna pay cash.

449
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,903
- Thank you.
- There you are, sir.

450
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:12,781
I was always going to pay, you know.

451
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:14,783
'Course you were.

452
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,497
Do you think Marilyn's beautiful?

453
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:24,209
Not compared to you.

454
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:26,294
You don't have to try so hard
to be charming.

455
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:28,797
You're nice enough as it is.

456
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,841
Well, you could be.

457
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:43,186
Wait a while, crocodile.

458
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:46,064
But I really do like you, Lucy.

459
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,858
Maybe. That's my dad.

460
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:58,910
Time to be thinking about bed,
darling. Early start tomorrow.

461
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:00,745
Sorry, Daddy. We're just going
over tomorrow's schedule.

462
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:02,747
Yes, I should be off, sir.

463
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:05,542
Uh, Colin Clark. Lovely
to meet you, Mr. Armstrong.

464
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,461
This is a great place you have here.

465
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,713
Do you know this part of the world?

466
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,133
Um, no. My family
are more country people.

467
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,845
Oh. Well, good night.

468
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:18,054
Good night.

469
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:27,897
- Next Saturday?
- Yeah.

470
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,235
- Good morning, Dame Sybil.
- Colin, dear.

471
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:35,488
I thought you looked cold
so I bought you this.

472
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:37,740
- Thank you, Dame Sybil.
- Film sets and rehearsal rooms

473
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:40,243
are coldest places on Earth.

474
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:47,292
She should be on time
like everyone else.

475
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:50,170
She's a star.
- I'm a fucking star.

476
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:51,629
She's the greatest
piece of ass on Earth.

477
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:54,257
With tits like that,
you make allowances.

478
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:56,384
Marilyn, my darling,

479
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:58,178
you are an angel
and I kiss the hem of your garment,

480
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:01,097
but why can't you get here on
time for the love of fuck?!

481
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:05,018
Oh.
You have that word in England, too.

482
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:07,604
Marilyn has to prepare properly.

483
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,940
Acting isn't just a case
of putting on a costume or a false nose.

484
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,483
You must apologize to Dame Sybil.

485
00:28:16,813 --> 00:28:17,914
Sybil?

486
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:27,123
- I'm so sorry.
- My dear, you mustn't concern yourself.

487
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,876
A great actress like you has
many other things on her mind.

488
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,086
You think I'm a great actress?

489
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:35,882
None of the rest of us truly
know how to act for the camera,

490
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,885
but you do. It's a rare gift.

491
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:43,890
This poor girl hasn't had
your years of experience.

492
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:47,060
She's in a strange country
acting a strange part.

493
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:48,853
Now, are you helping or bullying?

494
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:53,399
Oh, thank you.

495
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:58,655
<i>Before you meet my mother-in-law,</i>

496
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:03,451
<i>I must warn you she's a little vague
and can be very deaf on occasions.</i>

497
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:05,578
Uh, two is good, Jack. Yeah.

498
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,288
<i>OK, let's cut it there.</i>

499
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,999
<i>Speed.
Five, take one.</i>

500
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,210
<i>OK.
Action.</i>

501
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:15,505
<i>When one is old,
one should use much more.</i>

502
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:19,509
<i>- What do you do, my dear?
- I'm The Coconut...</i>

503
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:22,470
<i>And once again, please.
Keep rolling.</i>

504
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:25,723
<i>- I'm in The Coconut Girl at the Avenue.
Excellent.</i>

505
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,935
<i>I do need you to keep your eyes
open if you can, my angel.</i>

506
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,687
<i>Paula, would you give
the line, please?</i>

507
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,189
<i>Wait, I know it.</i>

508
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:35,608
<i>I'm in The Coconut
Girl on the Avenue.</i>

509
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:39,279
<i>At the Avenue.
- I'm at the Avenue.</i>

510
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,114
<i>It's not at the Avenue.</i>

511
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:43,491
<i>Uh, Sybil, would you
give her the line again?</i>

512
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:46,202
<i>- Thank you.
What do you do, my dear?</i>

513
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:49,497
<i>I'm in The Coconut
Girl at the Avenue.</i>

514
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:55,753
That one's pretty damn good.
You knocked it outta the park.

515
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,048
She says she's an actress.
- When Marilyn gets it right,

516
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:01,342
you just don't wanna
look at anyone else.

517
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:03,386
<i>Cut it there.</i>

518
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:11,144
We've only been shooting for four days.
Already, we're two weeks behind.

519
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:15,106
So why not only show her the good takes.
She might feel better about herself.

520
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:17,358
Well, the kid's right.
She could use the confidence.

521
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:20,528
No one's forcing her to watch.
Besides, she's an experienced actress.

522
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:23,573
- She should learn from her mistakes.
- But they only upset her.

523
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,242
Not half so much as they upset me!

524
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:31,581
Leave all that.
Go and find Marilyn's script.

525
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,291
Paula thinks she's left it
in her dressing room.

526
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,001
Yes.

527
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:52,894
- Your script...
- Oh, I found it.

528
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:56,856
You can go now, Colin.

529
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:16,209
David wants to know if you're ready
for the extras in the ballroom scene.

530
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:18,836
Tell him he can start
sending them up. Women first.

531
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:24,801
I'm looking forward to Saturday.

532
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:28,721
- Our date.
- Oh, I completely forgot.

533
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:31,641
I can't do Saturday.
Marilyn wants to go shopping.

534
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:33,684
Since when do you work for her?

535
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:35,144
Next Friday instead.

536
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:39,899
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'll pick you up. Eight o'clock.

537
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:51,994
- Gee, it's quiet.
- Sure is.

538
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:55,164
It's a Saturday, so it's early closing,
but at least she can shop in peace.

539
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:58,960
That's awfully pretty.
Every building here looks like a castle.

540
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:01,254
Oh, I think so.

541
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:02,713
Look.

542
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,383
- It's Marilyn!
It's Marilyn Monroe!

543
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,219
- OK.
It's her!

544
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:14,392
Slow down.
You'll get your autograph.

545
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,519
- Whoa!
- You're so kind!

546
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:19,480
Boy, you're awfully excited.

547
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:21,399
- OK, guys, let's keep calm.
Marilyn!

548
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:23,526
- Hold back a little.
It's for my son.

549
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:25,319
Wait your turn!

550
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:31,242
This is too much.

551
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:32,827
- Oh!
- Colin, get in the car!

552
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,370
Stand back a few feet, please.

553
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:45,548
Jeez, Marilyn, they really love you.

554
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,228
Well, we're still
the first ones, aren't we?

555
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:03,274
Gee, this is all right, isn't it?

556
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:07,820
Cut. Uh, the line is,
"Gee, this is all right, too, isn't it?"

557
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:10,323
It's a tiny word, my darling,
but it does matter. So we'll...

558
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,950
We'll do it again. Once more, please,
straight away. Thank you so much.

559
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:14,911
- All right, as soon as we can.
- Turn over.

560
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:20,708
Well, we're still
the first ones, aren't we?

561
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:24,003
- Gee, this is all right, isn't it?
Cut.

562
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:27,757
- Can't we just drop it?
- Well, the thing is, darling,

563
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:30,927
you've already admired the downstairs
hall in the earlier scene,

564
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:35,556
and now you're admiring
this room as well.

565
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:36,891
If you see what I mean?

566
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:41,062
- Oh, sure.
- Thank you.

567
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:44,190
- Turn over.
- Paula?

568
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:45,775
Christ.

569
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:47,944
I don't get it.

570
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,613
He's such a strange man,
I think she's already figured out

571
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,782
that he only invited her here
to sleep with him.

572
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:54,617
I... What...
So, what is the...?

573
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:56,953
The reason Marilyn can't
remember the line

574
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,164
is because she doesn't believe
the situation her character is in.

575
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:03,960
Then she should pretend to believe it.

576
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,254
"Pretend"? We're talking
about the difference

577
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,965
between the truth and artificial crap.

578
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:11,259
We're in absolute agreement.
Acting is all about truth,

579
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:13,135
and if you can fake that,
you'll have a jolly good career.

580
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:15,096
Maybe we should try for another take.

581
00:34:15,263 --> 00:34:17,390
Marilyn needs time
to give a great performance.

582
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:18,808
You should give her as long as it takes.

583
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:20,810
Chaplin took eight months
to make a movie.

584
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:23,062
Eight months of this?

585
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:25,648
- I'd rather kill myself.
- Oh!

586
00:34:30,403 --> 00:34:32,154
I can't do this.

587
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,448
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

588
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,993
You can do it. You can't fail.

589
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,870
You'll have more pain,
you will suffer more,

590
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:43,207
but you will create.
All you need is time.

591
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:45,960
Think about the things
you like instead of him.

592
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:48,588
Frank Sinatra. Hmm?

593
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:51,173
Coca-Cola.

594
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,468
Use your substitutions
and make it work for you.

595
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:55,761
- OK.
- OK.

596
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:58,347
Two-eight-one, take 17.

597
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:04,937
Oh, we're still the first ones,
aren't we?

598
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:09,442
Gee, this is all right, too, isn't it?

599
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:14,989
Then she goes...
She...

600
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:19,577
Cut! What is the matter now?

601
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:21,329
You wait! Marilyn, please.

602
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,831
Please, tell me how I can help you.

603
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:27,043
I don't know who Elsie is, and I can't
act her if I don't know who she is.

604
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:31,464
You have her precisely. You understand
her inside out. I'm in awe of your gift.

605
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:33,507
- We all are.
- She's not real.

606
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:38,596
Then why not simply rely
on your natural talents?

607
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,225
So are you saying you
don't want me to act?

608
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:47,521
Marilyn, will you just try to be sexy.
Isn't that what you do?

609
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,400
I want Lee.

610
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:53,402
I want Lee.

611
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:55,404
- You've already got Paula...
- I want Lee!

612
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:56,906
- I'm the director.
- I'm Lee's representative.

613
00:35:57,073 --> 00:35:58,991
It's 5:00 in the morning in New York.

614
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:00,368
I want Lee!

615
00:36:01,744 --> 00:36:04,497
<i>Oh, now forever,</i>

616
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:08,167
<i>farewell the tranquil mind,</i>

617
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:11,003
<i>farewell content...</i>

618
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,756
Farewell the plumed troops

619
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:19,929
and the big wars that make
ambition virtue. Oh, farewell!

620
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:21,806
Paula's not an actress!

621
00:36:21,972 --> 00:36:23,599
She's not a director,
she's not a teacher!

622
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:25,726
Her only talent is buttering up Marilyn!

623
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:29,647
Larry, she needs her people.
We're the only family she's ever had.

624
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:33,067
Do you know what would make Marilyn
Monroe a real actor? A season in rep.

625
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:35,569
They wouldn't stand for this nonsense
at the Hippodrome in Eastbourne.

626
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:37,613
Larry, you have to be patient with her.

627
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,492
Trying to teach Marilyn how to act
is like teaching Urdu to a badger!

628
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:48,165
I better go see her. She'll need
something to help her calm down.

629
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,004
Christ! Pills to sleep.
Pills to wake up.

630
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:55,756
Pills to calm her down.
Pills to give her energy.

631
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:59,176
No wonder she's permanently
ten feet underwater!

632
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:02,888
- Maybe she's scared.
- We're all scared!

633
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:06,100
I've spent half of my professional life
in abject bloody terror!

634
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:08,018
It's what actors do!

635
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:09,478
But you have the training
to deal with it, sir.

636
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:12,481
I wouldn't buy the "little
girl lost" act if I were you.

637
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:16,235
Though heaven knows, it's tempting.

638
00:37:16,402 --> 00:37:19,655
I think Marilyn knows
exactly what she's doing.

639
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:30,249
Look, you better get over to Parkside
and make sure the poor girl's all right.

640
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,641
Marilyn's OK. She's taken
some pills and gone to bed.

641
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:51,729
They like to keep her doped up.
It makes her easier to control.

642
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:55,900
They're terrified their
cash cow will slip away.

643
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,735
Cheers.

644
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:10,873
Why does everybody
always think I'm crazy?

645
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,708
I'm not crazy.

646
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:54,667
Marilyn, come back to bed.

647
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:02,007
It's not about you.
It's not what you think.

648
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:04,844
It's just a few ideas.

649
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:08,556
Writer stuff.

650
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:17,398
Come on, let's get some sleep
and bring back my book.

651
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:28,033
Don't touch me.

652
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,418
Good morning, Miss Monroe.

653
00:39:47,595 --> 00:39:50,973
- It's nearly lunchtime.
She's not feeling the part.

654
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,059
It's a light comedy. How much
feeling can it possibly require?

655
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:56,729
Just give her a few minutes, Larry.

656
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:58,564
Boy, will you find out what
the hell is going on, please?

657
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:21,045
It's Colin. Come in.

658
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:31,722
Are you all right, Miss Monroe?

659
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:37,937
- How old are you?
- Twenty-four.

660
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:41,607
Nearly. I'm... I'm 23.
I'm nearly 24.

661
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:48,656
Do you know you remind us of
the young king in the movie?

662
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:50,783
And so...

663
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:55,245
uh... sweet.

664
00:40:56,914 --> 00:40:58,582
And innocent.

665
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,252
I'm not sure I'm that innocent.

666
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:08,676
So, what's your job on this picture?

667
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:12,179
I'm the third assistant director.
So, it's a gofer, really.

668
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:14,431
"Go for this, go for that".

669
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:18,394
But you're Larry's assistant, too.

670
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,396
Yes.

671
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:23,524
What were you doing
in my house last night?

672
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:27,194
Did he send you?

673
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:28,779
He was worried about you.

674
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:35,119
Are you spying on me?

675
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:38,080
No, of course not.
Why would anyone spy on you?

676
00:41:46,422 --> 00:41:49,049
Colin.

677
00:41:49,216 --> 00:41:52,386
Whose side are you on?

678
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:57,683
Yours, Miss Monroe.

679
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:06,900
Call me Marilyn.

680
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:16,493
Marilyn's got a new boyfriend.

681
00:42:17,578 --> 00:42:19,663
- Larry will get jealous.
Nothing happened.

682
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:23,333
You were there for ten minutes.
Plenty of time for a kiss and a cuddle.

683
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:30,257
I dreamed last night
that I could hear singing.

684
00:42:30,424 --> 00:42:32,843
And then I realized it wasn't a dream.

685
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:37,514
There was a male voice choir
serenading Marilyn under our window.

686
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:39,808
At two in the morning.

687
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:42,519
It's a circus. Freak show.

688
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:45,105
I'm going back to New York
for a few days.

689
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:49,359
I need a break.
I need to see my kids.

690
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:52,071
- That won't help Marilyn.
- I can't help her.

691
00:42:53,322 --> 00:42:56,909
She wants me to protect her,
but... I can't.

692
00:42:57,076 --> 00:43:00,370
She thought I could smash
all her insecurities.

693
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:02,206
That I can make her a new person.

694
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:05,042
She read some notes I made.

695
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:07,294
They were nothing.
Just... Just a few ideas.

696
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:11,965
- But about her?
- She took them the wrong way.

697
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:18,055
You do... love her,
your new bride and all that?

698
00:43:18,222 --> 00:43:20,224
I can't work.

699
00:43:21,225 --> 00:43:23,018
I can't think.

700
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:26,647
She's devouring me.

701
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:34,029
Good morning, Vivien.

702
00:43:34,196 --> 00:43:36,281
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
my darling wife.

703
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:40,119
Hello. I hope Larry isn't
making you all work too hard.

704
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:44,123
I know what a dreadful
slave-driver he could be.

705
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:46,917
David. He would be lost without you.

706
00:43:47,084 --> 00:43:49,586
- Just doing my job.
- And Jack, of course. Jack.

707
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:52,339
Oh. I'm getting old, Jack.

708
00:43:52,506 --> 00:43:54,299
More beautiful every year, Vivien.

709
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:57,636
Well, I need you to work
your miracles on me.

710
00:43:57,803 --> 00:43:59,847
Are you looking after Larry
like I told you?

711
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:01,431
I'm doing my best, Vivien.

712
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,060
Marilyn, darling.

713
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:10,941
Larry tells me
that you are quite superb,

714
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:14,486
- and I am wild with jealousy.
- Oh.

715
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:17,739
But everyone says you were
a wonderful Elsie on stage.

716
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:20,492
Oh, but I'm too old
to play her in the film.

717
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:23,579
Larry was quite brutal about that.

718
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:27,374
You see, the truth
is all that matters to him,

719
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:30,544
and that's why we all
admire him so very much.

720
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:34,214
I must let you work.
I just wanted to wish you good luck.

721
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,511
- Hi, Vivien.
- Goodbye, and you.

722
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:43,557
I love the mustache. I do.

723
00:44:43,724 --> 00:44:45,100
It suits you. Bye...

724
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:50,898
<i>So I wasn't addressed.
Who cares?</i>

725
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:54,359
<i>Bull in the labyrinth. Oop!</i>

726
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:57,613
<i>Who the heck is Theseus anyway?</i>

727
00:44:57,779 --> 00:45:00,240
I didn't think she
would be so beautiful.

728
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:03,869
- Disgraceful!
- Oh, she shines on that screen.

729
00:45:04,036 --> 00:45:06,413
Oh, darling.
Puss, don't upset yourself.

730
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,874
You are ten times
the actress she will ever be.

731
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:12,878
Oh, if you could see yourself.
The way you watch her!

732
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:15,839
Oh, Vivien, you're imagining things.
Please.

733
00:45:16,006 --> 00:45:17,966
I hope she makes your life hell.

734
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:21,470
Vivien...

735
00:45:28,227 --> 00:45:30,395
Do you have a cigarette,
please, Colin?

736
00:45:33,607 --> 00:45:35,442
No, not one of my awful things.

737
00:45:45,077 --> 00:45:48,205
Remember, boy,
when it comes to women,

738
00:45:48,372 --> 00:45:51,750
you're never too old for humiliation.

739
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:56,004
Marilyn won't shoot today.
She's gone back to Parkside.

740
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:58,632
She's upset about
Arthur leaving England.

741
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:00,509
He's only going to visit his children.

742
00:46:00,676 --> 00:46:04,304
You don't leave Marilyn alone.
She can't handle it.

743
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:06,640
She thinks that everyone's
going to abandon her.

744
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:10,686
Let's hope she's
changed her bloody mind.

745
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:12,688
- Yes.
Sir Laurence?

746
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:17,025
- Roger, what's up?
- Is, uh, Colin there, sir?

747
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:20,028
<i>- Yes, he is.
- Can I speak to him?</i>

748
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:22,489
Colin, it's for you.

749
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:30,122
<i>- Roger?
- Colin.</i>

750
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:31,456
Miss Monroe.

751
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:35,168
Why don't you drop by here
on your way home.

752
00:46:35,794 --> 00:46:38,046
- Uh...
- What?

753
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:40,799
What is Marilyn doing on the phone
with my third fucking assistant?

754
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:43,343
Yes, I'm sure I could do that.

755
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,137
Good.

756
00:46:45,304 --> 00:46:47,848
Don't tell anyone, though.

757
00:46:51,018 --> 00:46:52,728
Well, is she coming back?

758
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,229
No, she wants to see me.

759
00:46:54,396 --> 00:46:56,356
He shouldn't be talking to her.
He's just a kid.

760
00:46:56,523 --> 00:46:59,526
- Supposing he said something.
- I'm sure Colin knows what he's doing.

761
00:46:59,693 --> 00:47:01,361
Don't you, Colin?

762
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,867
I know you're awfully busy, Colin,

763
00:47:07,034 --> 00:47:09,745
but if you could manage to find
me a cup of tea before you leave,

764
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:11,747
that would be marvelous.

765
00:47:13,832 --> 00:47:15,667
Miss Monroe said
for you to wait.

766
00:47:21,757 --> 00:47:23,258
Help yourself to a drink.

767
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:26,803
Oh, I'm sorry. I was checking
that you've got everything.

768
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,889
Let me.

769
00:47:36,897 --> 00:47:38,440
Are you frightened of me, Colin?

770
00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:39,858
No.

771
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,445
Good. 'Cause I like you.

772
00:47:47,324 --> 00:47:49,117
I want you to help me.

773
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:51,703
Well, I'm only the third.
I'm just... I'm a messenger, really.

774
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,789
But you know everything
that's going on.

775
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:56,458
You can see both sides of the situation.

776
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:59,127
Please tell me everything.

777
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:04,174
- Uh...
- Relax.

778
00:48:04,341 --> 00:48:07,094
I thought you weren't scared of me.

779
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:11,264
- Are you hungry?
- Uh...

780
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:13,767
I'll have them send in a tray.
I'm starved.

781
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:18,271
Oh, go... Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

782
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:20,148
Am I interrupting something?

783
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:22,317
Maybe you have a Mrs. Colin
waiting for you at home.

784
00:48:22,484 --> 00:48:25,153
There's no Mrs. Colin.

785
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,365
So we can talk as long as we like.

786
00:48:30,325 --> 00:48:32,661
Why is Sir Olivier so mean?

787
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:35,831
He talks awful to me.

788
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:38,625
Like he's slumming.

789
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:41,711
I'll tell you what's wrong.

790
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:44,798
It's agony for him
because he is a great actor

791
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:47,801
that wants to be a film star.
And it's agony for you

792
00:48:47,968 --> 00:48:50,929
because you're a film star who
wants to be a great actress.

793
00:48:51,096 --> 00:48:54,391
And this film won't help either of you.

794
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:59,688
You sure you can handle that?

795
00:48:59,855 --> 00:49:01,440
You don't look old enough to drink.

796
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:05,026
- I'm 23, Miss Monroe.
- Oh, it's Marilyn.

797
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:08,029
Hmm. I'm 30.

798
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:10,449
I guess that makes me
an old lady to you.

799
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:12,701
Seven years is nothing.

800
00:49:12,868 --> 00:49:15,537
You know I've been
married three times already.

801
00:49:15,704 --> 00:49:17,497
How did that happen?

802
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:19,291
Maybe you're just
looking for the right man.

803
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:23,128
They always look right at the start.

804
00:49:25,881 --> 00:49:28,467
I'll get that.

805
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:32,554
- Hello?
- Colin, is everything OK?

806
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:34,890
Everything's fine.
Uh, Miss Monroe, she just.

807
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:37,309
She had some large packages
she needed handling.

808
00:49:37,476 --> 00:49:39,728
<i>OK, what does she want?</i>

809
00:49:39,895 --> 00:49:41,188
Colin?

810
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:43,773
<i>- Let me speak to her, Colin.
Oh...</i>

811
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,109
Let me talk to her. Sh!

812
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:49,279
Let me speak to her.

813
00:49:49,446 --> 00:49:51,698
What is going on, Colin?

814
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:55,243
I'm afraid she's tied up right now.

815
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:56,536
Let me talk to her, damn it.

816
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:58,413
<i>Let me talk to her.</i>

817
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,831
<i>- Colin!
I'm sorry, Milton.</i>

818
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:03,043
- I'm sorry. I have to go.
- Colin!

819
00:50:09,591 --> 00:50:12,219
Let's go for a walk in the garden.

820
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:15,680
Let's go see if we can find any more
reporters in the bushes.

821
00:50:21,353 --> 00:50:24,981
Oh, I didn't know
it was so pretty out here.

822
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:27,859
You should get out more.
You should see the sights.

823
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:30,612
I am the sights.

824
00:50:30,779 --> 00:50:34,658
You know, we're just like
Elsie and the young king.

825
00:50:39,496 --> 00:50:43,041
What would Sir Laurence say
if he could see us now?

826
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:45,544
I don't think he'd mind.

827
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,881
But he thinks that I'm the enemy.

828
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:51,967
No, he doesn't understand
your kind of actor.

829
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:55,220
He's hated the Method ever since
Vivien worked with Elia Kazan.

830
00:50:55,387 --> 00:50:57,264
It's all too strange and new.

831
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:00,141
So you're the future,
and that frightens him.

832
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:03,645
You know what?
Every time I walk into the studio,

833
00:51:03,812 --> 00:51:07,732
I feel a sense of doom come over me.

834
00:51:09,568 --> 00:51:13,613
He gives me the dirtiest looks,
even when he's smiling.

835
00:51:14,656 --> 00:51:16,157
And the crew hates me.

836
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:17,450
No, that's not true.

837
00:51:17,617 --> 00:51:21,121
The only person I can trust is Paula.

838
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:23,039
Except for you now, maybe.

839
00:51:23,206 --> 00:51:26,751
Phone call from New York,
Miss Monroe. It's Mr. Miller.

840
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,302
- Goodbye, Colin.
- Goodbye.

841
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:37,721
Thank you for telling me the truth.

842
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:44,019
You'll be leaving now, I expect.

843
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:47,522
I don't care if he fucks her sideways.

844
00:51:47,689 --> 00:51:49,774
Perhaps it'll calm her down.

845
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:52,110
Oh, hello, boy.

846
00:51:52,277 --> 00:51:54,446
Hear you spent
last night with Marilyn.

847
00:51:54,613 --> 00:51:56,531
I didn't spend the night with her.
We just... We had a chat.

848
00:51:56,698 --> 00:51:59,326
- I heard them chuckling.
- Perhaps if Colin is very diplomatic,

849
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:01,369
Marilyn's more likely to behave herself.

850
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:03,204
- She just wants a chum, that's all.
- A chum?

851
00:52:03,371 --> 00:52:06,166
<i>Jesus Christ, what is this,
Goodbye, Mr. Chips?</i>

852
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:07,917
Grow up, kid.

853
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:17,052
You know, I thought working with Marilyn
would make me feel young again.

854
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:21,723
But I look dead in the rushes.

855
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:24,476
Dead behind these eyes.

856
00:52:27,896 --> 00:52:30,815
I wanted to renew myself through her.

857
00:52:32,067 --> 00:52:35,612
But all I see reflected
in that magnificent face

858
00:52:35,779 --> 00:52:38,615
is my own inadequacy.

859
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:45,914
You know, I admire Marilyn.
I really do, despite her behavior.

860
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,627
She's taken everything
Hollywood can throw at her

861
00:52:50,794 --> 00:52:52,754
and she's triumphed.
That takes some bloody guts.

862
00:52:54,923 --> 00:52:57,258
An actress has to be pretty tough

863
00:52:57,425 --> 00:53:00,887
to get even a tenth as far as she has.

864
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:04,057
Be careful, boy.

865
00:53:05,684 --> 00:53:07,894
She doesn't need to be rescued.

866
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:09,938
Not really.

867
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:06,828
It's you.

868
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:10,165
Marvelous!
Absolutely marvelous, darling.

869
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:12,208
That's wonderful. Well done.
Let's check that.

870
00:54:26,723 --> 00:54:29,434
Three minutes,
ladies and gentlemen. Three minutes!

871
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:33,480
Colin! Arthur Miller called me.
He's not happy with you.

872
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:36,483
- He doesn't even know who I am.
- Marilyn must have said something.

873
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:38,777
Well, maybe she's trying
to make him jealous.

874
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:46,743
Listen, kid. I've known
Marilyn for seven years.

875
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:48,453
I fell in love with her
just as you've done.

876
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:50,872
We had ten days together,
and that was it.

877
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:53,875
She picked me up, she put me
down, that's what she does.

878
00:54:54,042 --> 00:54:56,294
She breaks hearts.
She will break yours.

879
00:54:56,461 --> 00:55:00,089
My advice to you is quit
before you get burned.

880
00:55:00,256 --> 00:55:04,219
- I don't need your advice.
- Have it your way.

881
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:06,387
You don't see Marilyn again.
You don't even talk to her.

882
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:09,974
She's completely off limits to you.
Do you understand me?

883
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:12,268
Yes.

884
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:17,357
- I waited for you on Friday.
- Lucy, I'm so sorry.

885
00:55:17,524 --> 00:55:19,234
I completely forgot.
I just... I've been so busy.

886
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,319
So I hear.

887
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:23,655
Well, you know how crews gossip.
There's nothing in it.

888
00:55:23,822 --> 00:55:26,241
Of course there isn't.

889
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:28,868
Marilyn Monroe fancying you?
Come on.

890
00:55:33,248 --> 00:55:34,499
- Oh, hi, Colin.
- Hi.

891
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:36,125
Hi, Lucy.

892
00:55:42,966 --> 00:55:47,387
- I thought you were different.
- I really like you, and we have fun.

893
00:55:47,554 --> 00:55:50,390
And now it's time to set
your sights a little higher.

894
00:55:53,268 --> 00:55:54,978
Well, good luck.

895
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:21,296
- Get in.
- Any problem, Roger?

896
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:24,299
Uh, no. Just dropped by
to take Colin out to lunch.

897
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:26,426
You're not taking him to Marilyn.

898
00:56:26,593 --> 00:56:28,761
That would drop us all
in a whole ocean of shit.

899
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:31,848
No, sir. Been looking forward
to this, haven't we, Colin?

900
00:56:32,015 --> 00:56:33,474
Yeah.

901
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:38,479
OK. You have a nice time, boys.

902
00:56:40,982 --> 00:56:43,693
- Surprise!
- Jesus!

903
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:46,112
Roger and I decided
to take you on an adventure.

904
00:56:47,822 --> 00:56:50,325
What the hell?

905
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:51,743
- Colin!
- Oh!

906
00:56:53,036 --> 00:56:55,496
Get back here, you little bastard!

907
00:56:55,663 --> 00:56:58,917
Colin! You're fired! You hear me?

908
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:03,588
Do you think he saw me?

909
00:57:03,755 --> 00:57:05,006
Colin!

910
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:10,720
Snuggle up. This is fun.

911
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:13,264
This is the getaway car.

912
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,072
I oughta feel like this every day.

913
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:34,035
We have today, anyway.

914
00:57:34,202 --> 00:57:37,205
We have one day to do
whatever you like.

915
00:57:37,372 --> 00:57:38,873
Then we can go back
to real life tomorrow.

916
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,668
Only one day?

917
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:44,796
- Well, maybe the weekend.
- Or a week!

918
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:50,426
What should we do now?

919
00:57:50,593 --> 00:57:52,971
We could go to Windsor Castle,
if you like.

920
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:03,064
Detective Chief
Superintendent Smith.

921
00:58:03,231 --> 00:58:06,275
I'm escorting this lady
and gentleman for the day.

922
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:07,735
They'd like to look around the castle.

923
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:09,904
I need a contact name for the book.

924
00:58:10,071 --> 00:58:12,740
You don't know Her Majesty,
by any chance?

925
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:16,077
Yes, we met at a movie premiere.
She said my dress was pretty.

926
00:58:16,244 --> 00:58:17,745
I don't think that quite does it, sir.

927
00:58:17,912 --> 00:58:19,706
My godfather works here.

928
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:22,667
He's the royal librarian.
Sir Owen Morehead.

929
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:46,816
- Hello, sir.
- Colin, my boy! Come in!

930
00:58:46,983 --> 00:58:50,069
Forgive the dust.

931
00:58:50,236 --> 00:58:53,281
Oh, you are very pretty, my dear.

932
00:58:53,448 --> 00:58:54,782
Oh!

933
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:57,410
Gee, I'd sure like
to read all these books.

934
00:58:57,577 --> 00:59:00,413
Luckily, one doesn't really have to.

935
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:02,623
A lot of them just have
pictures in.

936
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:07,795
- This is by an artist called Holbein.
- She's beautiful.

937
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:11,674
She was the daughter
of one of the king's courtiers.

938
00:59:11,841 --> 00:59:13,718
Nearly 400 years ago.

939
00:59:13,885 --> 00:59:16,679
Gee, I hope I look that good
when I'm 400.

940
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:22,518
These are by Leonardo da Vinci.

941
00:59:22,685 --> 00:59:25,229
Didn't he paint that lady
with the funny smile?

942
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:28,274
<i>- The Mona Lisa.
- Do you have that one here, too?</i>

943
00:59:28,441 --> 00:59:30,943
Alas, that one got away.

944
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,779
Oh.

945
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:35,656
- The Queen's sorry to have missed you.
- Really?

946
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:38,576
Oh, yes! Why, she was only
saying to me the other day,

947
00:59:38,743 --> 00:59:43,331
"What must it be like to be
the most famous woman on Earth?"

948
00:59:53,216 --> 00:59:55,051
Colin, look.

949
00:59:56,761 --> 01:00:00,807
Gee, I sure never had a doll's house
like this when I was a kid.

950
01:00:00,973 --> 01:00:04,268
- Can I?
- Yes, of course.

951
01:00:11,234 --> 01:00:13,277
This is me.

952
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:17,365
That's you, and these are our kids.

953
01:00:20,034 --> 01:00:22,620
Oh, our daughter's so pretty.

954
01:00:25,498 --> 01:00:28,543
All little girls should be
told how pretty they are.

955
01:00:30,962 --> 01:00:34,465
Should grow up knowing how
much their mother loves them.

956
01:00:38,594 --> 01:00:40,054
There she is!

957
01:00:45,977 --> 01:00:47,812
Shall I be her?

958
01:00:55,695 --> 01:00:58,865
- Are you somebody, mate?
- No. I'm no one.

959
01:01:13,963 --> 01:01:16,340
So this is
your old school, huh?

960
01:01:16,507 --> 01:01:18,509
Did you sing in the school choir?

961
01:01:18,676 --> 01:01:22,388
- No.
- That's a lie, I can tell.

962
01:01:22,555 --> 01:01:25,349
How old were you?

963
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:27,685
I was sent away to boarding
school when I was eight.

964
01:01:27,852 --> 01:01:31,063
Why? Didn't your parents
like you very much?

965
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:34,233
That's just how they do it in my family.

966
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,527
Well, I'd never send my kids away.

967
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:39,739
Eton is 500 years old.

968
01:01:39,906 --> 01:01:42,033
It was founded by King Henry VI.

969
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,951
No wonder it's so dusty.

970
01:01:44,994 --> 01:01:47,580
Looks more like a palace.

971
01:01:47,747 --> 01:01:49,540
That room there,
upper school, that's where you're sent

972
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:51,751
if you don't work hard enough.
You're whipped.

973
01:01:51,918 --> 01:01:53,211
- No.
- Mm-hm.

974
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:55,838
- That's awful.
- It's Marilyn Monroe!

975
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:01,093
Oh!

976
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:04,430
Look who it is!

977
01:02:05,223 --> 01:02:08,643
- Come see Marilyn.
- Well, hello, boys.

978
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:11,229
Pleased to meet you!
Blow us a kiss, Marilyn!

979
01:02:11,395 --> 01:02:15,942
Sure. All right, boys. Work hard!
I don't want anyone whipping you.

980
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:18,236
You can whip me anytime, Marilyn!

981
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:19,395
Oh!

982
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:22,365
Oh!

983
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:25,785
- Maybe we should go.
- It's time to go. Lovely to see you.

984
01:02:36,212 --> 01:02:38,631
Hurry up, slowpoke!

985
01:02:42,635 --> 01:02:44,804
There's no...
We haven't got our... We can't...

986
01:02:48,724 --> 01:02:49,725
Oh, God.

987
01:02:53,771 --> 01:02:54,814
Oh, God.

988
01:02:59,193 --> 01:03:01,404
This is great.

989
01:03:05,032 --> 01:03:08,828
Oh, my God!

990
01:03:08,995 --> 01:03:11,247
What if a boat goes past?
We'll be arrested.

991
01:03:11,414 --> 01:03:14,333
Don't worry. Roger will fix it.

992
01:03:19,422 --> 01:03:21,299
- Ooh!
- What?

993
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:25,011
- I have something in my eye.
- Let me see.

994
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:28,597
I can't see anything.

995
01:03:33,602 --> 01:03:38,316
That's the first time
I've kissed anyone younger than me.

996
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:43,195
There's a lot
of older guys in Hollywood.

997
01:03:47,158 --> 01:03:48,117
Ooh.

998
01:04:02,423 --> 01:04:05,343
Don't be shy, Colin.
It's nothing you haven't seen before.

999
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:17,146
Oh, Colin. And you, an old Etonian.

1000
01:04:17,313 --> 01:04:19,940
My God, it's cold. It's freezing!

1001
01:04:28,449 --> 01:04:31,327
Here. Come here. Let me warm you up.

1002
01:04:32,995 --> 01:04:35,456
Is that better?

1003
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:41,754
I want this to be the perfect date.

1004
01:04:41,921 --> 01:04:45,508
I haven't had a real date
since I was 13 years old.

1005
01:05:01,941 --> 01:05:03,609
That was nice.

1006
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:11,033
Ahem! Time to go home,
I think, Miss Monroe.

1007
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:30,344
Be careful not
to get in too deep, son.

1008
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:32,740
Hi, Milton.

1009
01:06:33,616 --> 01:06:37,036
The next time I come on set,
you better make sure Colin is there.

1010
01:06:37,203 --> 01:06:38,412
Take him home.

1011
01:06:50,508 --> 01:06:52,885
You spent the day with her.
What frame of mind was she in?

1012
01:06:53,052 --> 01:06:54,678
- She was fine, sir.
- Oh, how lovely.

1013
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:56,847
Well, go and find out why
she's not standing here

1014
01:06:57,014 --> 01:06:59,433
right now in front of that.
There's a good chap.

1015
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,602
And perhaps on this splendid
day we can persuade her

1016
01:07:01,769 --> 01:07:05,064
to do some of the work that she is
currently paying herself to do.

1017
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:09,693
- Don't start, Dickie.
- You won't get any sympathy from me.

1018
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:12,530
- She's trying her best.
- Oh, dear.

1019
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:14,823
Little Colin's in love.

1020
01:07:19,328 --> 01:07:22,623
- Colin?
- What's the matter?

1021
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:25,251
It's Marilyn.
She's asking for you.

1022
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:35,094
She hasn't made a sound
for over an hour.

1023
01:07:35,261 --> 01:07:37,930
- So how many pills did she take?
- Jesus! Who knows.

1024
01:07:38,097 --> 01:07:40,933
- I wasn't counting.
- Marilyn? So how about the window?

1025
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:45,771
Marilyn, darling?
Open the door, bubbeleh.

1026
01:07:48,816 --> 01:07:50,109
That's her window.

1027
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:00,536
Marilyn?

1028
01:08:01,662 --> 01:08:03,455
Marilyn.

1029
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:07,668
Colin?

1030
01:08:07,835 --> 01:08:10,379
Oh, hi, Colin.

1031
01:08:13,674 --> 01:08:15,926
Are you OK?

1032
01:08:16,093 --> 01:08:17,803
Everyone's worried about you.

1033
01:08:20,556 --> 01:08:22,641
Qh, phooey.

1034
01:08:22,808 --> 01:08:25,185
Colin!

1035
01:08:28,981 --> 01:08:31,275
- Get in.
Colin!

1036
01:08:31,442 --> 01:08:33,527
Colin, come on, open up!

1037
01:08:33,694 --> 01:08:35,112
Colin?
Colin!

1038
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,531
Open this door.
She needs me. Colin!

1039
01:08:37,698 --> 01:08:39,700
You don't understand her.

1040
01:08:39,867 --> 01:08:40,909
- Come on.
- She's fine, uh...

1041
01:08:41,076 --> 01:08:43,329
Come on, open up!
- I'm gonna keep an eye on her,

1042
01:08:43,495 --> 01:08:44,538
and I will sleep on the sofa.

1043
01:08:44,705 --> 01:08:47,541
Colin, listen to me.
You can't talk to her.

1044
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:49,627
I can't find the key.
Look, you can all go home now.

1045
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:53,213
- You don't understand her. Come on.
- Go home.

1046
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:56,008
Oh, my...

1047
01:09:58,153 --> 01:10:00,948
Colin. What are you doing here?

1048
01:10:02,574 --> 01:10:04,618
Uh, I came in through the window.

1049
01:10:04,785 --> 01:10:05,953
Milton thought that you were sick.

1050
01:10:07,454 --> 01:10:09,289
Oh.

1051
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,042
The window.

1052
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:14,044
How romantic.

1053
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:16,296
That's just like Romeo and Juliet.

1054
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:22,052
What... Why would
they say that I'm sick?

1055
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:28,142
Please.

1056
01:10:29,685 --> 01:10:31,603
Please don't take any more.

1057
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:36,400
Who's this? Who's that?

1058
01:10:36,567 --> 01:10:40,487
That's my mama.
She bought me a white piano.

1059
01:10:42,281 --> 01:10:45,075
Right before they
took her to the asylum.

1060
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:47,828
I grew up in other
people's homes, mostly.

1061
01:10:50,414 --> 01:10:52,166
Is that Abraham Lincoln?

1062
01:10:52,332 --> 01:10:54,501
That's my dad.

1063
01:10:54,668 --> 01:10:59,006
Well, I don't know who my real father
is, so it may as well be him, right?

1064
01:11:04,178 --> 01:11:07,848
Do you have a home, Colin?
A real one?

1065
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:12,519
- With a mama and a daddy?
- Yes, I do.

1066
01:11:12,686 --> 01:11:14,730
Do they love you?

1067
01:11:15,981 --> 01:11:17,566
I'm sure that they do.

1068
01:11:17,733 --> 01:11:21,945
Mm. You're lucky.

1069
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:24,531
Yes.

1070
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:28,160
Do you love me, Colin?

1071
01:11:30,162 --> 01:11:31,747
Yes.

1072
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:38,045
You're like some Greek goddess to me.

1073
01:11:38,212 --> 01:11:40,047
I'm not a goddess.

1074
01:11:40,881 --> 01:11:44,384
I just wanna be loved
like a regular girl.

1075
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:48,222
- Mr. Miller loves you.
- No, I found his notebook.

1076
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:51,600
He said the most
horrible things about me.

1077
01:11:51,767 --> 01:11:54,603
Writers, they scribble all kinds
of things. It doesn't mean anything.

1078
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:56,730
No, he wanted me to find it.

1079
01:11:56,897 --> 01:12:01,485
He said he wished
he'd never married me.

1080
01:12:03,237 --> 01:12:06,198
Why do the people
I love always leave me?

1081
01:12:06,365 --> 01:12:09,034
I will never leave you.

1082
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:19,002
All people ever see is Marilyn Monroe.

1083
01:12:21,088 --> 01:12:25,133
As soon as they realize
I'm not her, they run.

1084
01:12:29,304 --> 01:12:31,390
You're different.

1085
01:12:32,599 --> 01:12:34,977
You're not like that.

1086
01:12:39,815 --> 01:12:43,360
You should date that wardrobe girl.

1087
01:12:43,527 --> 01:12:45,863
She's so pretty.

1088
01:12:46,864 --> 01:12:49,616
I don't want to.

1089
01:12:50,909 --> 01:12:52,494
I love you.

1090
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:33,577
This is nice.

1091
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:38,665
It's like spoons.

1092
01:13:40,292 --> 01:13:43,086
I used to do this with Johnny.

1093
01:13:43,253 --> 01:13:46,256
- Who's Johnny?
- Johnny Hyde.

1094
01:13:48,634 --> 01:13:52,012
He was my agent back in the old days.

1095
01:13:55,182 --> 01:13:57,935
He was thin just like you.

1096
01:14:02,898 --> 01:14:05,025
Marilyn, do one thing for me.

1097
01:14:05,192 --> 01:14:06,652
Mm...

1098
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:10,030
Come to the studio on-time tomorrow

1099
01:14:10,197 --> 01:14:12,240
and show everybody what you can do.

1100
01:14:12,407 --> 01:14:15,786
Show Larry that you are a great actress.

1101
01:14:17,913 --> 01:14:19,831
OK.

1102
01:14:47,526 --> 01:14:53,031
<i> No matter what
others may say or do</i>

1103
01:14:53,949 --> 01:14:58,495
<i> Light of heart and fancy free</i>

1104
01:14:58,662 --> 01:15:03,500
<i> That's the way to start</i>

1105
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:07,546
<i> There will be nothing to lose</i>

1106
01:15:07,713 --> 01:15:11,550
<i> Till you lose your</i>

1107
01:15:11,717 --> 01:15:14,803
<i> Heart </i>

1108
01:15:21,768 --> 01:15:22,769
Oh!

1109
01:15:22,936 --> 01:15:25,063
- This is intolerable!
- With deepest respects, sir.

1110
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:27,733
My message was so important,
I had no choice but to intrude.

1111
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:29,443
- Revolution?
- No, sir.

1112
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:31,528
Miss Marina's aunt has
been in a motor accident.

1113
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:33,864
What?

1114
01:15:34,031 --> 01:15:37,159
Oh, go away, you silly man.

1115
01:15:37,325 --> 01:15:40,912
Miss Marina, your aunt. Do you realize
how serious her condition is?

1116
01:15:41,705 --> 01:15:44,833
Well, it's her own fault.

1117
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,128
She has no right out
this time of night. She's 93!

1118
01:15:50,047 --> 01:15:51,965
Cut it there.

1119
01:15:57,304 --> 01:16:00,182
Well, whatever it was you did
to her, boy, keep doing it.

1120
01:16:00,348 --> 01:16:05,687
I've never seen her so happy.

1121
01:16:05,854 --> 01:16:07,439
<i>- Yes.
We need Colin</i>

1122
01:16:07,606 --> 01:16:09,024
<i>at the house right away.</i>

1123
01:16:09,191 --> 01:16:11,151
<i>Got a pain in my side,
for Christ's sake.</i>

1124
01:16:11,318 --> 01:16:13,987
What are they trying to make me
think I'm crazy or something?

1125
01:16:14,154 --> 01:16:18,075
Is that what it is? You know I don't
just rev it up like a Model T.

1126
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:20,327
I don't just crank it up.

1127
01:16:20,494 --> 01:16:23,371
No one's asking you to just crank it up.
We're worried about you...

1128
01:16:23,538 --> 01:16:25,791
Isn't that what you're saying?
I was sick, for God's sake!

1129
01:16:25,957 --> 01:16:28,460
- Can I be sick?
- Colin's here.

1130
01:16:28,627 --> 01:16:29,753
Colin.

1131
01:16:30,796 --> 01:16:32,297
Colin.

1132
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:36,468
Colin thinks I'm a good actress.
Don't you, Colin?

1133
01:16:36,635 --> 01:16:38,762
- Yes I do. You were wonderful today.
- See?

1134
01:16:38,929 --> 01:16:42,432
- Marilyn's tired now.
- I want him to stay with me.

1135
01:16:42,599 --> 01:16:44,309
And what would Arthur say
if he knew Colin was here?

1136
01:16:44,476 --> 01:16:46,770
You heard what she said,
she wants me here. Come on.

1137
01:16:47,938 --> 01:16:52,359
You have no idea of your
position in the world, Marilyn.

1138
01:16:55,112 --> 01:16:58,532
You are the greatest actress
that has ever been.

1139
01:16:59,574 --> 01:17:01,284
Mm?

1140
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:03,870
I love you like a daughter.

1141
01:17:04,037 --> 01:17:08,708
- Oh.
- My darling girl. I know it's hard now.

1142
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:13,046
But you will survive this and go on
to better things. You're young.

1143
01:17:14,047 --> 01:17:17,551
Your life is ahead of you,
just beginning.

1144
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,887
Sit with Colin, mm?

1145
01:17:21,596 --> 01:17:24,724
Oh, Paula, I'm sorry.

1146
01:17:24,891 --> 01:17:27,394
- Come here.
- Oh, no.

1147
01:17:27,561 --> 01:17:30,647
Come here. I'm here now.

1148
01:17:32,816 --> 01:17:34,025
Colin?

1149
01:17:34,192 --> 01:17:37,154
- I'll look after you.
- Don't leave.

1150
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:38,697
- I'm not.
- Please don't leave.

1151
01:17:38,864 --> 01:17:41,700
- I'm not. Sh.
- Please don't leave.

1152
01:17:41,867 --> 01:17:43,743
Please don't leave.

1153
01:17:51,251 --> 01:17:52,294
Oh.

1154
01:18:04,973 --> 01:18:06,683
Oh, it hurts, it hurts!

1155
01:18:09,019 --> 01:18:11,605
It's a baby! It's a baby!

1156
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:14,274
I can't lose the baby! Colin!

1157
01:18:14,441 --> 01:18:16,693
Oh!

1158
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:18,737
Roger! Call a doctor!

1159
01:18:25,952 --> 01:18:27,078
Who's in charge here?

1160
01:18:28,496 --> 01:18:31,166
I've given Mrs. Miller an injection
and the bleeding stopped.

1161
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:34,878
But she needs to stay in bed tomorrow,
and after that she'll be fine.

1162
01:18:35,962 --> 01:18:37,714
I suggest someone stays with her.

1163
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:40,133
She'll be safe with me. Thank you.

1164
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:51,394
- Thank you.
- Good night, then.

1165
01:18:52,771 --> 01:18:54,814
Was she really pregnant, sir?

1166
01:18:57,234 --> 01:19:00,403
I think that's a private matter
between Mr. and Mrs. Miller, don't you?

1167
01:19:22,467 --> 01:19:24,052
Arthur's on his way back.

1168
01:19:31,268 --> 01:19:34,562
When this movie is over,

1169
01:19:34,729 --> 01:19:38,275
I'm gonna settle down
and be a good wife to him.

1170
01:19:41,194 --> 01:19:44,906
I'm gonna learn to make matzo-ball soup
as good as his dad.

1171
01:19:51,121 --> 01:19:53,999
We have to forget this
whole thing ever happened.

1172
01:19:56,376 --> 01:19:57,794
I don't want to forget.

1173
01:20:01,381 --> 01:20:03,383
Let me protect you from all this.

1174
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:07,679
Oh. What are you gonna do?

1175
01:20:07,846 --> 01:20:09,889
- Marry me?
- Why not?

1176
01:20:10,056 --> 01:20:12,559
You could quit this.
Forget Marilyn Monroe.

1177
01:20:12,726 --> 01:20:14,477
Forget Hollywood. Let it all go.

1178
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:18,481
Just let it go.

1179
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:26,031
I couldn't just give it up.

1180
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:29,492
Why not?

1181
01:20:31,745 --> 01:20:33,913
Why not, when it drives you crazy?

1182
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,041
You think I'm crazy?

1183
01:20:36,207 --> 01:20:39,085
I just meant that you could be happy.

1184
01:20:43,923 --> 01:20:45,842
I am happy.

1185
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:49,095
Of course you're happy.

1186
01:20:54,142 --> 01:20:56,102
You're the biggest star in the world.

1187
01:21:09,366 --> 01:21:11,076
You're right.
We have to forget all this.

1188
01:21:12,702 --> 01:21:16,581
So from now on, I'm just
the third assistant director,

1189
01:21:16,748 --> 01:21:19,292
and we will never look
at each other again.

1190
01:21:22,754 --> 01:21:24,297
Maybe just a wink.

1191
01:21:27,467 --> 01:21:29,511
Once in a while.

1192
01:21:44,943 --> 01:21:47,320
My dear. My dear.

1193
01:21:47,487 --> 01:21:50,448
- Yes?
- They're ready for you on set.

1194
01:21:50,615 --> 01:21:52,367
- Marilyn?
- Just arrived.

1195
01:21:52,534 --> 01:21:55,036
Only an hour late.
Not bad by her standards.

1196
01:21:56,704 --> 01:21:58,832
Perhaps we'll finish this
bloody film after all.

1197
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:01,876
Five-two-seven. Take one.

1198
01:22:05,463 --> 01:22:07,382
- Cut it there.
- And check that, please.

1199
01:22:08,299 --> 01:22:09,926
Five-eight-four, take two.

1200
01:22:13,555 --> 01:22:14,639
Take five.

1201
01:22:15,348 --> 01:22:16,891
Six-four-nine, take two.

1202
01:22:18,268 --> 01:22:20,019
Let's cut it there.

1203
01:22:20,186 --> 01:22:21,187
Very quiet, studio.

1204
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:25,024
<i> I found a dream</i>

1205
01:22:25,191 --> 01:22:27,193
<i> Laying in your arms</i>

1206
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:31,030
<i> The whole night through</i>

1207
01:22:31,197 --> 01:22:33,616
<i> I'm yours</i>

1208
01:22:33,783 --> 01:22:36,703
<i> No matter what others may say</i>

1209
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:38,788
<i> Or do</i>

1210
01:22:38,955 --> 01:22:43,209
<i> Light of heart and fancy free</i>

1211
01:22:43,376 --> 01:22:47,630
<i> That's the way to start</i>

1212
01:22:47,797 --> 01:22:51,885
<i> There will be nothing to lose</i>

1213
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:57,599
<i> Till you lose your heart </i>

1214
01:23:02,729 --> 01:23:05,648
First love is such sweet despair, Colin.

1215
01:23:12,155 --> 01:23:14,699
Cut. That's a wrap.

1216
01:23:26,753 --> 01:23:27,795
She's there.

1217
01:23:44,938 --> 01:23:46,940
I hope you will all forgive me.

1218
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:52,153
It wasn't altogether my fault,

1219
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:56,241
but I've been ill.

1220
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:01,579
I'd like you to remember I tried.

1221
01:24:40,743 --> 01:24:41,953
Lucy, um...

1222
01:24:43,663 --> 01:24:46,499
I was wondering if you were
doing anything on Saturday.

1223
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:49,836
I'm washing my hair.

1224
01:24:54,591 --> 01:24:55,883
Did she break your heart?

1225
01:24:58,595 --> 01:24:59,721
A little.

1226
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:03,016
Good. It needed breaking.

1227
01:25:14,485 --> 01:25:16,404
We're back, everyone!

1228
01:25:16,571 --> 01:25:17,739
All right...

1229
01:25:38,885 --> 01:25:43,348
You do look, my son, in a moved
sort, as if you were dismayed.

1230
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:45,683
Be cheerful, sir.

1231
01:25:47,101 --> 01:25:50,521
Our revels now are ended.

1232
01:25:52,148 --> 01:25:56,152
We are such stuff

1233
01:25:56,319 --> 01:25:59,197
as dreams are made on,

1234
01:25:59,364 --> 01:26:03,242
and our little life

1235
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:07,705
is rounded with a sleep.

1236
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,582
Prospero.

1237
01:26:14,587 --> 01:26:16,214
She's quite wonderful.

1238
01:26:17,924 --> 01:26:19,842
No training, no craft to speak of.

1239
01:26:20,009 --> 01:26:22,553
No guile, just pure instinct.
She's astonishing.

1240
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:26,391
- You should tell her that.
- Oh, I will. But she won't believe me.

1241
01:26:26,557 --> 01:26:28,935
<i>President Taft.</i>

1242
01:26:29,102 --> 01:26:31,229
It's probably
what makes her great.

1243
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:35,525
It's almost certainly what
makes her so profoundly unhappy.

1244
01:26:35,692 --> 01:26:39,404
<i>Oh, Miss Marina,
won't you have some champagne?</i>

1245
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:42,949
<i>Oh, I don't know, Your Grand Ducal.
You really think I ought?</i>

1246
01:26:43,116 --> 01:26:45,618
I tried my best to change her,

1247
01:26:45,785 --> 01:26:48,913
but she remains brilliant, despite me.

1248
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:54,252
<i>Maybe just up to... Ah!</i>

1249
01:26:54,794 --> 01:26:56,963
Do you know, I think directing a movie

1250
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:59,549
has to be just about
the best job ever invented.

1251
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:02,719
But Marilyn's cured me
of ever wanting to do it again.

1252
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:05,346
Well, now I'm back to the theater.

1253
01:27:05,513 --> 01:27:07,265
John Osborne's writing a piece for me.

1254
01:27:07,432 --> 01:27:10,685
Sir, I thought you hated
all that Royal Court stuff.

1255
01:27:10,852 --> 01:27:13,813
Well, Miller made me see
things a little differently.

1256
01:27:16,649 --> 01:27:18,151
Thank you, Colin, for all your help.

1257
01:27:26,868 --> 01:27:28,703
Glad you ran away to the circus?

1258
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:39,797
<i>My dear.</i>

1259
01:27:39,964 --> 01:27:42,425
<i>Uh... ow.</i>

1260
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:46,095
<i>I've got a solemn word
of warning for you.</i>

1261
01:27:46,262 --> 01:27:47,847
<i>What is that, my beloved?</i>

1262
01:27:49,307 --> 01:27:51,225
<i>You know what's going to happen.</i>

1263
01:27:52,935 --> 01:27:55,438
<i>I'm going to fall in love with you.</i>

1264
01:27:57,690 --> 01:27:59,776
<i>I'm going to fall in love with you</i>

1265
01:27:59,942 --> 01:28:03,070
<i>because I always, always do.</i>

1266
01:28:24,091 --> 01:28:26,552
There you go.

1267
01:28:42,985 --> 01:28:44,946
Buy a girl a drink?

1268
01:28:47,698 --> 01:28:49,700
I'll get another one
of those, please, Barry.

1269
01:28:53,412 --> 01:28:55,748
I wasn't going to leave
without saying goodbye.

1270
01:28:57,625 --> 01:28:59,085
Don't forget me.

1271
01:29:02,255 --> 01:29:03,548
As if I could.

1272
01:29:03,714 --> 01:29:06,592
Everybody else on the picture
wishes they could.

1273
01:29:06,759 --> 01:29:08,678
They don't understand you.

1274
01:29:12,139 --> 01:29:13,891
Walk me to my car?

1275
01:29:17,311 --> 01:29:18,688
Nice place you got here.

1276
01:29:50,469 --> 01:29:52,138
Thanks for being on my side.

1277
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:04,984
Looking a couple of inches taller
than when I first saw you.

1278
01:30:11,574 --> 01:30:15,244
<i>Here's what I remember most:
Her embrace.</i>

1279
01:30:16,370 --> 01:30:18,205
<i>Her belief in me.</i>

1280
01:30:18,372 --> 01:30:21,751
<i>And the joy she gave.
That was her gift.</i>

1281
01:30:23,336 --> 01:30:26,964
<i>When I think of her now, I think
of that time when a dream came true.</i>

1282
01:30:27,757 --> 01:30:31,385
<i>And my only talent
was not to close my eyes.</i>

1283
01:30:41,812 --> 01:30:45,566
<i> That old black magic</i>

1284
01:30:45,733 --> 01:30:49,946
<i> Has me in its spell</i>

1285
01:30:50,112 --> 01:30:53,866
<i> That old black magic</i>

1286
01:30:54,033 --> 01:30:58,204
<i> That you weave so well</i>

1287
01:30:58,371 --> 01:31:03,542
<i> And down and down I go</i>

1288
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:07,797
<i> Round and round I go</i>

1289
01:31:07,964 --> 01:31:09,548
<i> In a spin</i>

1290
01:31:09,715 --> 01:31:13,177
<i> Lovin' that spin I'm in</i>

1291
01:31:13,344 --> 01:31:17,098
<i> Under that old black magic</i>

1292
01:31:17,264 --> 01:31:19,892
<i> Called love</i>

1293
01:31:21,227 --> 01:31:24,063
<i> For you're the lover</i>

1294
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:27,650
<i> I have waited for</i>

1295
01:31:27,817 --> 01:31:30,277
<i> The mate that fate</i>

1296
01:31:30,444 --> 01:31:34,448
<i> Had me created for</i>

1297
01:31:34,615 --> 01:31:40,413
<i> But every time your lips meet mine</i>

1298
01:31:41,205 --> 01:31:46,210
<i> Darling, down, down Down I go</i>

1299
01:31:46,377 --> 01:31:49,964
<i> Round, round, round I go</i>

1300
01:31:50,131 --> 01:31:52,216
<i> In a spin</i>

1301
01:31:52,383 --> 01:31:55,761
<i> Loving that spin I'm in</i>

1302
01:31:55,928 --> 01:32:00,516
<i> Under that old black magic</i>

1303
01:32:00,683 --> 01:32:02,727
<i> Called</i>

1304
01:32:10,526 --> 01:32:12,737
<i> Love </i>
