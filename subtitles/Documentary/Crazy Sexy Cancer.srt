A furnace.

11

You could fry an egg on my stomach.

This brush is sick.

It's a good brush,
what's the matter with you?

24
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,000
Don't blame the brush, it's the man.
It's you, it's your technique.

25
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,400

- What?
- A fuckin' boulder.

69
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,720
I've got the fuckin' bends.

70
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,240
How did that happen?

71
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,920
I don't fuckin' know.
Where's the mobile?

72
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,840
I almost got killed, Dee!

73
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,560
I was that close
to gettin' killed. Serious!

74
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,440
You nearly had a squashed husband.
Here, give your mate a call.

75
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,600
- What?
- Your mate, the one with the truck.

76
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,320
- Felipe?
- Yeah, if that's his name.

Don't worry about this, darlin'.
It's nothing.

Come here.

79
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,600
It has done
a fair bit of damage, Gal.

80
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,520
- Cracked the tiles.
- I had noticed!

81
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,360
- When's that gettin' fixed?
- (Dee) Saturday, apparently.

82
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,120
Wouldn't bet on it.

83
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,720
They're takin'
the boulder out Tuesday

84
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,440

91
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,120
You gonna stay with
the same colour water?

92
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,680
- What d'you mean?
- Water.

93
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,600
You stickin' with the plain?

94
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,600
You can have different colours.

95
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,200
- Fuck off!
- Straight up!

98
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,720

- Is that right?

99
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,600
- Check it out.
- Gal, he's at it.

100
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,600
I'm not! What do you know?

101
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,000
- (Laughter)
- Just have the fuckin' plain.

102
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,560

00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,680
- Yeah.
- And they want me?

164
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,360
Yeah.

165
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,320
- No one else?
- No.

166
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,600
- They want me?
- Yeah.

167
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,600
All right. You've asked me
and I've said no. That's it.

168
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
So...why are we still talking?

169
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,600
Jack?

170
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,800
It was Don Logan.

171
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,600
- Oh, Christ.
- Don Logan.

172
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,760
Gal, I'm sorry, I didn't know...

173
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,080
- It's all right.
- Why didn't he just call us?

174
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,680
Who knows what goes on
in that cunt's head?

175
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,480
- It's not your fault.
- Shouldn't have picked it up.

176
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,840
All right, right, um...

177
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,880
You tell Don...

178
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,840
Umm... Tell him...thanks.

179
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,600
Thanks for thinkin' of me,
but I've gotta decline.

180
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,080
- No offence, but...
- You can't.

181
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,240
Well, then, tell him...

182
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,800
Tell him...

183
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,920
- I'd be no good.
- They're serious.

184
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,360
Tell him what the fuck
you like, anything!

185
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,600
- You can tell him yourself.
- What?

186
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,560
- Yeah.
- He's comin' over.

187
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,240
Tomorrow.

188
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,440
Wants us to pick him up.

189
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,600
OK.

190
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,600
Señor.

191
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,360
He rates you, Gal.
Reckons there's no risk.

192
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,920
oh, that's nice, that. Nice and cold.

193
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,200
I love this restaurant.

194
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,040
(Gal) Deedee, my lovely wife...

195
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,720
Come Saturday I'll have
me pool back, swim in it.

196
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,720
Always dreamed of that...this.

197
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,760
Guess where?

198
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,120
That's it. You got it right in one.

199
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,440
Inside, that's where.

200
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,320
"No risk."

201
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,360
No fucking risk?

202
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,000
Nine years of my fucking life,
no fucking risk?

203
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,360
What you havin'?
I'm havin' the calamari.

204
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,680
(Crickets chirping)

205
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,400
Look, what's the worst thing
that could happen?

206
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,720
He's gonna come here, ask me,
I'm gonna say no.

207
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,680
He's not gonna be happy,
then he'll leave.

208
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,560
- That simple?
- Yeah.

209
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,680
Now, please, come to bed,
I miss you.

210
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,960
We don't have to be here.

211
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,080
Now, that would be
the wrong thing to do.

212
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,600
You know that.

213
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,000
That'd be like a red rag to a bull.

214
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,200
All I can do
is tell him to his face

215
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,360
that I'm not interested,
that's all I can do.

216
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,600
And I'm not.

217
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,680
And I will tell him.

218
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,600
Come here, give us a hug.

219
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,600
He'll hurt you.

220
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,640
No...

221
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,560
He won't.

222
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
He won't hurt me. He can't.

223
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,240
You know he can.

224
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,720
(Gal breathes deeply)

225
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,480
Come on. Let's get some kip.

226
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,480
(Men shouting in Spanish)

227
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,360
(Gal) Oi!

228
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,560
Here y'are, sort him out.

229
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,040
He'll have the balance
on Saturday.

230
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,600
Listen, stay away
from here for a bit.

231
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,600
I'm all right for the moment.

232
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,560
(Mutters) Yeah, yeah, yeah.

233
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,600
(DJ speaking Spanish on radio)

234
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,880
Gotta change my shirt,
it's sticking to me.

235
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,480
I'm sweatin' like a cunt.

236
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,600
(Aitch) How's your brother?

237
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,920
Malky? He's all right, I suppose.
Dunno, you'd have to ask him.

238
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,160
- You patched things up?
- It's up to him, innit?

239
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,160
- How was the flight, Don?
- Was all right.

240
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,640
So this is a Spanish villa, is it?

241
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,600
Yeah, this is it. The old hacienda.

242
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,640
Bit remote, innit? Cut off.

243
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,880
No, it's perfect, Don.
It's just how we like it.

244
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
D'you wanna look round?

245
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,720
Yeah, I will in a minute,
when I have a piss.

246
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,320
Right, girls, you fit?

247
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,880
Where you goin'?

248
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,600
Taking the ladies out to eat.
Leave you two to it.

249
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,760
- Ain't I invited?
- No, Don.

250
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,800
No, no - course you are!

251
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,600
Only I thought you'd want
some time. Talk about things.

252
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,920
No, I'm jokin'. It's all right.
Here y'are, I'll get it.

253
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,640
That's all right, Don.
No need for that.

254
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,880
Aitch! Behave.
I'm payin' for your meal.

255
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,400
oh, that's, er, very kind of you.

256
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,600
- Very nice of you.
- Shut up.

257
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,880
(Chuckles)

258
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,080
(Cicadas chirping)

259
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,480
Yeah, this is all right, innit?

260
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,200
Not bad.

261
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,680
What's that?

262
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,600
- A swimming pool.
- It's a bath, innit?

263
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,160
- We had an accident.
- Accident?

264
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,400
Yeah, this boulder
came rollin' down the hill,

265
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,880
just missed me.

266
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,680
Smashed some tiles. Look.

267
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,680
- You happy here?
- Yeah. Very.

268
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,600
What did Jackie say?

269
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,320
- Just that something was happening.
- Which it is. And?

270
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,880
- You were planning something.
- And you said?

271
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,640
I didn't say much, just listened.

272
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,640
She put a question to you.

273
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,720
- Yeah.
- Which was?

274
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,080
That you thought of me.

275
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,760
To which you said?

276
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,840
She probably told you.

277
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,560
Told me nothing.

278
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,640
- Look, Don...
- Look, Don?

279
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,880
- It's like this.
- Like what?

280
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm...

281
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,600
retired.

282
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,760
(Snorts) Are ya(?)

283
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,000
'Fraid so.

284
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,440
I haven't...not got lots
of money. I got enough.

285
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:30,600
I'd do anything not to offend you,
but I can't take part.

286
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,600
I'm not really up to it.

287
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,680
- Not up to it?
- No, I'm not.

288
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,200
I see.

289
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,400
- I'd be useless.
- Useless.

290
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,400
- I would be.
- In what way?

291
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,800
In every fuckin' way.

292
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,200
Why are you swearin'?
I'm not swearin'.

293
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,600
I'm gonna tell you a little story.

294
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,960
I know a bloke who knows a bloke
who knows a bloke.

295
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,360
Hello?

296
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,960
Now, you know this bloke.

297
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,600
- Do I?
- This is a bloke you know.

298
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,320
(Man) 'Is that Mr Logan? '

299
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,720
- Who's this?
- 'Hello, Mr Logan.'

300
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,720
- Hello.
- 'What you doin'? '

301
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,600
- Watching telly.
- 'What you watchin'? '

302
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,760
Nuffin'. Is that Stan?

303
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,880
'Course it is, you cunt.'

304
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,960
Stan Higgins.

305
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,600
Wants me to put a team together.

306
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,400
Eight men. Strong.

307
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,600
Ain't afraid of graft.
It's gonna take all night.

308
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,640
Good boys, gotta be good boys.

309
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,640
Reliable. Positive attitude.

310
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,360
That's very important.
Very important.

311
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,320
That's what we're looking for, Don.

312
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,840
Who's behind this, Stan?

313
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,680
Who do you think?

314
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,640
- Who do you think, Gal?
- I dunno. Who?

315
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,000
- Who?
- Teddy.

316
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,600
Teddy?

317
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,600
Teddy Bass.
Mr Black Magic himself. Teddy Bass.

318
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,320
Months ago,
he gets invited to this party,

319
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,200
massive place on the Bishops Avenue.

320
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,920
Wild party, orgy.

321
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,600
Orgy?

322
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,600
(Gasping and groaning)

323
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,640
Said it was fucking incredible.

324
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,960
Arses everywhere. Doin' everything.

325
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,080
Wanking, spanking...

326
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,360
Fucking...

327
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,920
Cocaine, camcorders...

328
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,240
Like ancient Rome.

329
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,400
How are you feeling, Teddy?
Are you all right?

330
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,120
Having fun?

331
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,920
Yeah, it's a gas.

332
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,080
What you staring at?

333
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,400
Who's he fuckin' sitting next to?

334
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,880
Who's he fuckin' sitting next to?

335
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,680
(Woman) Teddy, this is Harry,
chairman of Imperial Emblatt.

336
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,400
only the fuckin' chairman
of Imperial Emblatt.

337
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,720
Heard of that?

338
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,000
No.

339
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,640
That's cos they're one of those
sniffy lot, don't need publicity.

340
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,600
The back of your head.

341
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,640
What did you say?

342
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,600
I'm staring at the back of your head.

343
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,520
Well, don't. Stare at the back
of your own fucking head.

344
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,520
Like Standard Gradings TMD,
remember them?

345
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,440
Yeah, safety deposits, late '70s.

346
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,040
That's it. Only these are bigger.

347
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,000
Much bigger.

348
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,600
Men or women?

349
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,560
oh...

350
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,720
definitely.

351
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,680
(Clicking and whirring)

352
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,640
(Stan) 'This chairman's
not such a big prick.

353
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,560
'He knows who Teddy Bass is.

354
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,720
'What he is, what he's up to.

355
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,600
'But does he care? '

356
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,600
- Does he, fuck.
- Thank you for that, Harry.

357
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,800
I've been looking
for somewhere safe for that.

358
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,600
It's been in the family
for donkey's years, generations.

359
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,680
Why? Cos the place is impregnable.

360
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,120
The most elaborate
security system in Europe.

361
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,440
Well, thanks, Teddy.
Thank you for choosing us.

362
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,640
It's a modern fortress.

363
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,600
No, it's perfect for me.
I'm well impressed.

364
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,360
I feel very...safe.

365
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,600
Well, rest assured, Teddy,
we're very safe.

366
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,600
Very comforting to know that, Harry.

367
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,040
Nice doing business with you.

368
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,600
See you around.

369
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,680
Tell you what, Stan. That is
fucking impressive, that place.

370
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,600
I'll say that, fucking futuristic.

371
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,600
(Higgins) Yeah?

372
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,600
Doable?

373
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,920
I don't see why not.

374
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,760
See, where there's a will,
and there is a fucking will...

375
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,840
There's a way.

376
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,360
(Stan) 'And there is a fuckin' way.'

377
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,400
There's always a fucking way.

378
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,600
It's Saturday but you're needed
in London Friday.

379
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,640
It's a bit sudden, innit?

380
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,600
No, it's very far from sudden.

381
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,440
It's been five months,
I've been in on it for two.

382
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,440
It's not sudden. Preparation,
preparation, preparation.

383
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,360
It's a piece of piss, a monkey
could it, so I thought of you!

384
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,200
Cheers, Don.

385
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,840
You're at the Grosvenor,
your name's Rowntree.

386
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,000
If they give you a pull,
you're just here to see some friends.

387
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,920
Somebody'll call you,
pick you up. Probably Mike.

388
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,200
What's that mean?

389
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,600
- What?
- That stupid nodding you're doing.

390
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,400
Is this a fuck-off, Gal?

391
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,160
No, course not.

392
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,160
- Are you saying no?
- No.

393
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,440
- Is that what you're saying?
- Not exactly.

394
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,640
- What are you saying?
- I'm just saying...

395
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,680
Thanks and all that,
thanks for thinking of me,

396
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,840
but I've got to turn
this opportunity down.

397
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,360
No, you've got to
turn this opportunity yes.

398
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,400
- I'm not match fit.
- You seem all right to me.

399
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,400
- Not really.
- You look fine.

400
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,200
- Do the job.
- What?

401
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,680
- Do the job.
- No, Don.

402
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,920
- Yes.
- No.

403
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,160
- Yes.
- I can't.

404
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,600
- Can.
- I can't.

405
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,440
- Don't do this.
- Do what?

406
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,640
- What am I doin'?!
- This.

407
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,680
This? This what?

408
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,880
- Come on, Don.
- There's a boy lookin' at us.

409
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,760
Go home, son. Go on.
I don't need you today.

410
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,600
Go on, go home.

411
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,400
Go home!

412
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,640
Who was that?

413
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,920
A Spanish kid who helps
around the house. Nice kid.

414
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,400
D'you wanna go into town for
a drink? I'll show you round?

415
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,600
If you like. I'm not fussed.

416
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,200
You're on two per cent,
maybe even three.

417
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,720
Depends on the usual bumflufferies.

418
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,440
It's not about money with us, is it?

419
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,680
It's the charge, the bolt, the buzz.
The sheer fuck-offness, right?

420
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,640
# Dance to the music
like nobody does

421
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,200
# The first time I saw you
I knew it was love

422
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,120
# Groover... #

423
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,640
She's all right, Jackie, isn't she?

424
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,600
Yeah, she's great. Great laugh.

425
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,800
Big tits.

426
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,400
Yeah, she's a lovely girl.

427
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,960
# My heart is on fire
the night is divine

428
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,200
# My only desire
is making you mine...#

429
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,120
I've missed my plane,
I'm staying tonight, that all right?

430
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,840
Course.

431
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,240
I fucked her.

432
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,400
It's none of my business.

433
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,160
I know, I'm just tellin' you.
Three years ago.

434
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,920
oh, yeah?

435
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,960
- Dirty cow.
- Yeah.

436
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,000
Aitch knows fuck-all about it.

437
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,440
What's she doing with him,
lanky hunk of piss, fucking pillock.

438
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,560
He loves her, Don.

439
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,600
I'm tempted to tell him.

440
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,960
She tried to stick her finger
up my bum.

441
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,880
I almost hit the roof.

442
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,600
What d'you make
of a woman who'd do that?

443
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,560
Listen, don't say nothin',
Gal, but I...

444
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,560
- I quite liked her.
- Did ya?

445
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,160
Mmm.

446
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,360
How is she, all right?

447
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,320
- What's that, Don?
- You heard.

448
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,320
No, I didn't, Don. Sorry.

449
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,600
Yeah? Well, I'm not repeating it.

450
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,600
How far's the sea?

451
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,240
Talk to me, Gal.

452
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,160
I'm here for you.

453
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,680
I'm a good listener.

454
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,880
What can I say? I've said it all.

455
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,120
- I'm retired.
- Shut up!

456
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,600
Cunt.

457
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,080
You louse. You got some
fuckin' neck. Retired?

458
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,120
Fuck off, you're revolting.

459
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,080
Your fuckin' suntan,
you're like leather.

460
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,600
Like a leather man.

461
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,880
You could make a fuckin' suitcase.

462
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,120
You look like a
fat crocodile, fat bastard.

463
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,440
You look like fuckin' Idi Amin.

464
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,120
State of you.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

465
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,880
Who d'you think you are?

466
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,840
King of the castle? Cock of the walk?

467
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,960
oof!

468
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,600
You think this is
the Wheel of Fortune?

469
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,000
You make your dough and fuck off?

470
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:58,000
Thanks, Don. See you, Don.
off to Spain, Don. Fuck off, Don.

471
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,000
Lie in your pool laughing at me,
d'you think I'll have that?

472
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,280
You think I'll have that, ya ponce?

473
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,760
All right, I'll make it easy.

474
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,840
God, you're fucking trying.

475
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,120
Are you gonna do the job?

476
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,360
It's not a
difficult question. Yes or no?

477
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,480
- Don...
- Say it.

478
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,960
No.

479
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,760
Yes. Fuck off, wanker,
you're doin' it.

480
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,120
You know what I've noticed, Gal?
What stands out?

481
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,600
You haven't asked about anybody.

482
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,240
Everyone asks after you,
"How's Gal? Heard from him? "

483
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,040
"No, not for a while."
"Is he all right? "

484
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,600
Leaves me wondering,
"Have I upset him?

485
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,600
"Must have, I'll ask him."
Have I upset you?

486
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,560
- Course not.
- Meaning?

487
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,360
Well, you haven't.

488
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,120
You're British,
not a fucking Spaniard.

489
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,600
Don't kid yourself...

490
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,600
(Brakes screech)

491
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,600
What's that?

492
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,240
(Bleating)

493
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,040
It's a goat.

494
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,120
They're a fucking nuisance.

495
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,600
What's it lookin' at me for?

496
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,000
God, the steak was enormous!

497
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,280
Size of it. Couldn't finish it.

498
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,360
And he were nice, weren't he?
The waiter.

499
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,600
oh, yeah. Very attentive.

500
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,600
He liked you, Deedee, didn't he, Dee?

501
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,520
- Liked you.
- He's got good taste.

502
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,200
(Aitch) Handsome, weren't he?
Bloody Adonis.

503
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,680
Wasn't expensive...

504
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,600
You sound nice on the phone, Jack.

505
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,440
Nice telephone voice.

506
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,600
Sound like you work in an office.

507
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,120
- You ever worked in an office?
- No.

508
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,440
No?

509
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,440
Nice telephone voice.

510
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,600
I've worked in an office.

511
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,600
I was 17.

512
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,760
Does that surprise you?

513
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,040
What, that you were 17?

514
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,720
You got very nice eyes, Deedee.
Never noticed them before.

515
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,120
They real?

516
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,080
I'll get us all a drink, eh?

517
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,120
I'll give you a hand.

518
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,600
- He's staying the night.
- Have you told him?

519
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,600
Have you told him?!

520
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,600
- Yeah.
- And?

521
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,520
It's not that simple.

522
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,760
Did you know he fucked Jackie?

523
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,440
Yeah.

524
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,360
(Footsteps)

525
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,960
What the fuck was she playing at?

526
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,600
(Aitch) This is a fucking nightmare.

527
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,680
He's a fucking nightmare.

528
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,520
What happened?
What'd he say? You told him?

529
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,120
He knows.

530
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,200
Shouldn't have told him that.
Shouldn't have said anything.

531
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,600
Where? In the bar. About Jackie.

532
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,440
Jackie the Paki.

533
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,600
What, Gal? He's all right?

534
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,600
Still, giving too much of
yourself away. Fucking mouth.

535
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,360
Best keep schtum.

536
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,600
Schtum schtum, quick quick, schtum.

537
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,000
Big mouth,
fucking big mouth Don, Don, Don.

538
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,800
You all right, mate?

539
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,360
Don't look it.

540
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,880
Someone taking the piss, are they?

541
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,600
Liberties?

542
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,880
What? That cunt through there?

543
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,360
What's he said to you?
It's all right, mate.

544
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,120
You can tell me.

545
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,600
He said that?

546
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,360
Just like that? No...

547
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,360
That lump of shit said that?

548
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,360
Expects you to take that?

549
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,720
What, does he think you're a cunt?

550
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,600
I'll sort him out for you,
shall I? It's not a problem.

551
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,320
Can't have that.

552
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,480
Get up, you cunt!

553
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,600
- Lazy bastard!
- Get out of our room!

554
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,120
Get out, Don.

555
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,880
Get out!

556
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,600
I'll be downstairs.

557
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,560
(Gal) Unh...unh...

558
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,200
I love you, Gal.

559
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,840
You're loveable. Big, loveable bloke.

560
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,200
Loveable lump. Loveable lummox.

561
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,000
Gal Dove, party boy.

562
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,760
Big oaf.

563
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,880
So how is she? All right?

564
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,600
No, no, how is she?

565
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,280
Well, is she? She looks it.
Climate obviously agrees with her.

566
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,080
Still game for a laugh?

567
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,360
Honestly, of all the birds you
could've had and you picked her.

568
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,960
Gal Dove.

569
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,200
Gal fuckin' Dove.

570
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,600
Dove the Love. Glamorous Gal.
Big Gal. Gorgeous.

571
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,600
Used to have a great body.
Great physique.

572
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:43,080
Birds loved you, couldn't get enough,
and you wind up with that.

573
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,560
Dirty Deedee.

574
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,120
I love her with all my heart.

575
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,600
(Don) You know Vicky Raisins,
the pornographer?

576
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:57,360
He's an old man, but he still
operates off the Old Kent Road.

577
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,360
Says Deedee's still got a fan club.

578
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,080
They meet up every month.
The Wednesday Wank they call it.

579
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,600
They're in big demand nowadays,
those films. She's very popular.

580
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,600
Very popular. You seen 'em?

581
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,280
(Gal) I've seen 'em.
(Don) What a stain on your life.

582
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,760
All the Persil in the world
couldn't shift it. She's disgusting.

583
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,600
Do it.

584
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,600
(Sighs) I'm retired.

585
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,600
- Do it.
- This is madness.

586
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,360
I've had enough
"Crime and Punishment" bollocks.

587
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,360
I'm happy here.

588
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,560
I won't let you be happy!
Why should I?!

589
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,640
Friday, the Grosvenor,
you'll be there.

590
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,400
- I won't.
- You will. I told Ted.

591
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,600
- No, I won't.
- You will! You're Mr Rowntree!

592
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,600
- No.
- Yes, Rowntree! Yes, Grosvenor!

593
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,200
- No.
- Friday!

594
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,000
- I won't...
- You will!

595
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,440
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

596
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,160
Don, let's stop
kidding ourselves, eh?

597
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,600
We know the reason you're here
and it's not just me.

598
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,400
What'd you say?

599
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,640
It's not just because of me.

600
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,160
What you talkin' about?

601
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,160
You didn't come here to...

602
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,960
just because of me.

603
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,440
I find this astonishing.
You're amazing. This is astoundin'.

604
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:37,160
- (Snorts) Repeat.
- Let's be honest.

605
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,560
This is about Jackie.

606
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,080
I come over here...

607
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,840
for professional reasons,
nothing else.

608
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,680
on a professional mission.

609
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,600
I've gotta hand-pick a team.

610
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,760
I had you in mind for that team.

611
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,720
But your attitude appals me,

612
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,080
not what you're saying,
what you're not saying.

613
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,880
Insinuendoes.

614
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,360
You're demonstrating some
whopping great ego, my friend.

615
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,800
That sort of big-headedness
can be a right turn-off!

616
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,840
If you don't wanna do the job,
fair enough, I can accept that!

617
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,080
Considering the outrageousness
of what's going on in your head,

618
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,520
whatever stinking thoughts
you're having, we can go it alone!

619
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,560
Cos they're so disgusting!

620
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,640
Fuckin' hell! Fuckin' hell!

621
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,200
I would like to leave,
now, please. Get me a taxi.

622
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,640
Sir, I'm afraid you can't smoke.

623
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,000
What? What do you want?

624
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,720
Your cigarette,
you have to put it out.

625
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,600
Cigarette? What, this?

626
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,680
- No, I'm not gonna.
- You must.

627
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,920
- Why's that?
- If you don't, we can't take off.

628
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,360
Well, that's your problem, innit?

629
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,120
It's your move.

630
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,120
- I'm afraid...
- I won't put it out,

631
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,280
just wait till I've finished it,
simple as that.

632
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,000
Why don't you just put it out?

633
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,600
You want me to cut your hands
off and use it as an ashtray?

634
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,600
You prepared to let me
stub it out on your eyeball?

635
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,600
I'll put it out. Agreeable?

636
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,880
No.

637
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,600
Here come the gay brigade, look.

638
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,360
I'll tell you what...

639
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,120
I'll get off the plane.

640
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,000
You happy with that?
I'm happy with that.

641
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,920
I'll smoke it outside.

642
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,040
open the door!

643
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,400
I hope this crashes.

644
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,280
open the fucking door!

645
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,800
(Door opens)

646
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,440
This is very serious, Mr Logan.

647
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,640
You're right,
I've been here for five hours.

648
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,280
As you may know, all European...

649
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,720
Before you start,
let me ask you something, please.

650
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,320
Have you ever been
sexually assaulted?

651
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,320
Neither have I, until today.

652
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,640
- What?
- That's what I said.

653
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,200
I'm putting my bag
up in the cupboard,

654
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,600
next thing, I feel hands on me,
someone's touched me,

655
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,320
touched my front...my front bottom.

656
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,880
I've gone all cold.

657
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,400
I look round, he's standing there,

658
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,480
that steward
with a guilty look on his face.

659
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,160
I didn't know what to say.

660
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,720
I had to sit down,
I was that perturbed.

661
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:35,160
Then his mate, the other one
telling us what to do if we crash,

662
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,120
he starts and all,
starts lookin' at me all funny.

663
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:43,080
I don't know if they wanted me
for a twos-up or something,

664
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,040
I don't know how they work it,

665
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,000
but it scared me,
I was shakin' like a leaf.

666
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,920
So without thinking, I lit
a cigarette to calm my nerves.

667
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,680
I was tremblin',
I was very emotional.

668
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:59,040
That's when the rest happened.
It's very regrettable.

669
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,720
Now, I don't want to
kick up a fuss, right?

670
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,880
Press charges,
contact the British Embassy.

671
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,680
I'd rather not pursue
those channels, it's not my style.

672
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,520
I wouldn't lose the man his job,
man's got to eat.

673
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:17,640
I'm sure he's not representative
of all you Spanish people.

674
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,960
But have a word with him,
let him know he's been rumbled.

675
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,560
It's the one with the ginger hair.

676
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,080
(Aitch) What d'you think he's saying?

677
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,200
"Gal told me to go fuck myself"?

678
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,240
(Dee) Gal, how long you gonna be?

679
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,880
I'm just combing my hair.

680
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,360
- He'd look a right cunt.
- He is.

681
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,520
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying he has to save face.

682
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,200
Protect himself. His image, his ego.

683
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,240
No. I'll tell you what's happening.

684
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,480
He's gone back and he's said...

685
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,760
"I've decided not to go with Gal,

686
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,720
"he's fat, looks terrible,
Michelin man."

687
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,760
Fuck off, I'm beautiful.

688
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,040
(Aitch laughs)

689
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,040
No, mate, put yourself
in his perspective,

690
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,640
the way he sees things.

691
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,680
You're in the clear. Trust me.

692
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,440
Think I'm stupid?!
Think I'm a fucking cunt?!

693
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,600
You think I'm gonna have that?

694
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,600
Do you think I'll have that?

695
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,720
My fucking ears were burnin'
all the way in the fuckin' cab!

696
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,840
Fuckin' on fire!

697
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,200
- What happened?
- What happened?

698
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,000
What fuckin' happened?

699
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,600
I'll tell you what
fuckin' happened, you tell me, Gal.

700
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,760
Gave me a fucking knock-back,
you fat fuckin' cunt.

701
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,160
- Problem with the plane?
- What?

702
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,680
What did you fuckin' say, cunt? What?

703
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,440
Problem? Fucking problem?

704
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,320
No, mate, no.

705
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,760
No problem with the plane, cunt,

706
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,160
fucking plane was perfect,
you're the problem.

707
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,920
You fucking Dr White honkin'
jam-rag fucking spunk-bubble!

708
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,160
You keep lookin' at me,
I'll put you in the fucking ground!

709
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,560
Dee, take Jackie and Aitch inside.

710
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,120
Yeah.

711
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,520
- Drink?
- Yeah, you scheming cunt!

712
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,640
See if the ladies
let you try on their panties!

713
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,360
- You fuckin'...
- Don...

714
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,440
Shut up! Shut up.

715
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,160
Not this time, Gal. Not this time.

716
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,760
Not this fucking time.

717
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,320
No! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

718
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,040
No! No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

719
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,640
No! Not this fucking time.
No fucking way, no fucking way!

720
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,720
You made me look a right cunt!

721
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,160
Like a right fucking Mr Confused!

722
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,160
What's Jackie gonna think?

723
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,240
Not that I care,
that's you fucking me about.

724
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,640
Is your middle name "Ungrateful"?

725
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,920
You just gonna stand there
like Porky Pig?

726
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:13,640
Hiding behind your wife's skirt?
Your ex-porn star wife's skirt!

727
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,640
I don't give two fucks
what Jackie Big-Tits thinks,

728
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,640
I've got enough fucking
information on her.

729
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,000
So what if she's got a pretty face,
that could all change!

730
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,680
Age changes that!

731
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,600
See if she's still coming
with a face like a prune!

732
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,200
Aitch will be well gone by then!

733
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,360
I'm gonna kill you, Gal.

734
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,600
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

735
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,320
(Screams)

736
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,320
(Gal groaning)

737
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,360
You point a gun at me?

738
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,600
(Chuckles) Point a gun at me?

739
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,200
Gonna shoot me, are you?

740
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,480
Gonna shoot me.

741
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,640
Go on, then, shoot me.
It's all right.

742
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,360
Shoot me.

743
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,320
I'll have that.

744
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,600
There you go.

745
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,160
(Thunder crashes)

746
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,800
Cheers. Good luck.

747
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,600
(Phone)

748
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,760
(Don) 'You're at the Grosvenor.

749
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,640
'Your name's Rowntree, like Smarties.

750
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:23,600
'If they give you a pull,
you're just here to see some friends.

751
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,200
'Somebody'll call you, pick you up.

752
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,520
'Probably Mike.'

753
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,240
Gal, got a minute?

754
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,880
Stan.

755
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,120
Hello, Ted.

756
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,160
How did he seem, Gal?
How did he come across?

757
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,600
- Who?
- Don.

758
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,600
Don? He was all right.
He was Don. Why?

759
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,840
Just...trying to trace back.

760
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,840
He was due back on Wednesday.

761
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,120
He stayed with me Wednesday,
left...Thursday.

762
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,640
- Yesterday?
- Yeah.

763
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,920
- That's what I mean.
- You take him to the airport?

764
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,360
- No.
- You didn't?

765
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,360
No, he got a cab. Why?

766
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,680
You didn't see him
get on the plane?

767
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,680
No, not personally, no,
but I know he got on.

768
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,320
How?

769
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,360
- He called me from Heathrow.
- He called you?

770
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,120
- Yeah. What's happened?
- Why'd he call?

771
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,160
I don't know,
he said he'd landed safely.

772
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,680
I thought it was funny.

773
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,960
Sorry, about this, Gal,
but Don's gone AWOL.

774
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,720
- Oh.
- You finished, Ted?

775
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,680
- Yeah.
- You can go back.

776
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,600
- We'll be through in a minute.
- Good to see you.

777
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,360
(All laughing)

778
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:18,600
I'm just taking it step by step,
what else can I do?

779
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,400
Just one more day,
darling, one more day.

780
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,440
That's all it is, just one more day.

781
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,920
Dee? Dee?

782
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,200
I love you
like a rose loves rainwater,

783
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,720
Iike a leopard loves his partner
in the jungle, like...

784
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,840
I don't know
what like I love you.

785
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,200
I love you. I love you.

786
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,120
I know you know.

787
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,360
I know. I know that.

788
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,600
I know you love me
because I feel strong.

789
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,120
I have to go, I've got to get back.

790
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,320
I'm gonna hang up now.

791
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:30,200
I just want you to do
one thing for me. Just one.

792
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,440
Just say my name for me.

793
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,600
Just once.

794
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,200
Gal.

795
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,400
(Men laughing)

796
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,640
This phone call from Heathrow,
tell me what he said again.

797
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,480
Who, Don? I told you.

798
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,600
Tell me again.

799
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,720
- Just that he got back safe...
- No.

800
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,600
- He didn't do that.
- How d'you mean?

801
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,840
- I mean he didn't do that.
- Yeah, he did.

802
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,880
No, he didn't.

803
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,720
He didn't phone you from Heathrow.

804
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:41,680
I'm the one who got the call.
If you know different, tell me.

805
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,240
I don't know, Ted.
I don't know what you're getting at.

806
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,720
Don offered me a job,
I said, "Yes, please", he goes.

807
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,560
Next thing,
he phones me from Heathrow

808
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,720
and says, "See you Friday night".

809
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:04,640
- That's how he left it.
- But he didn't phone from Heathrow.

810
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,600
All right, he didn't phone me
from Heathrow, but he phoned me.

811
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,120
I'm not lying, Ted.

812
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,320
OK.

813
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,560
All right.

814
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,000
- Good luck tonight.
- Cheers.

815
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,680
I'm hurt!

816
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,560
See you around.

817
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:04,600
(Don) 'Where there's a will,
and there is a fucking will...'

818
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,640
(Stan) 'There's a way.

819
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,680
'And there is a fuckin' way.'

820
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,080
(Ted) 'There's always
a fuckin' way.'

821
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,120
How's it going, Gal?

822
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,760
We're in there, Stan,
but it ain't getting any easier.

823
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,840
It's just so fucking awkward.

824
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,960
- What time is it?
- Ten to twelve.

825
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,600
- How long?
- Another three hours, Ted.

826
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:25,280
- Maybe four.
- Fuck that. Two, two and half.

827
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,880
(Don groaning)

828
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,680
(Growling)

829
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,160
(Shouting incoherently)

830
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,720
oh, my God! Help me!

831
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,600
You've fucked hundreds!
Fucked hundreds!

832
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,480
Jackie...

833
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,240
I love you.

834
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,600
(Don) Help me, you cunt!

835
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,560
Get the fucking gun!

836
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,600
(Don) Fat, fat, cunt, cunt!

837
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,800
Murdering twat!

838
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,600
Bollock!

839
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,720
(Don mumbling incoherently)

840
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:19,720
I fucked Jackie. Fucked her.

841
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,080
Ask her, she'll tell you.

842
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,720
I fucked her.

843
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,600
Yeah, well...

844
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:32,000
I've fucked you now, haven't I?

845
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,480
Right, Malky, get Gal out!

846
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,600
(All shouting)

847
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,240
Everyone all right?

848
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,200
(Hammering)

849
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,600
(Man) Wheel 'em out!

850
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,760
(Cheering)

851
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:08,440
(Laughing and shouting)

852
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,840
(Applause)

853
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,320
Gentlemen...

854
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,880
- You're all cunts.
- (Laughter)

855
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:37,880
You tired?

856
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:40,480
No, I'm all right, actually, Ted.

857
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:44,360
You're a fucking millionaire
now, ain't ya?

858
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:03,400
- I was gonna say...
- Gal, no, no, you...

859
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:12,200
Go on...What?

860
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,000
(Chuckling)

861
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,400
Congratulations,
it went like a fucking dream.

862
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,360
Congratulations all round.

863
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:27,480
What's the matter?
You do not look happy.

864
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,840
Me? No, I'm happy. I'm well happy.

865
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,880
We're all happy, mate.

866
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,840
Yeah.

867
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,840
What's with the bag?

868
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:42,480
You, er... You shootin' off?

869
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,840
Who, me? No. Well, yeah.
I've got a plane to catch.

870
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,200
- Have you?
- Mm.

871
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,600
I'll give you a lift.

872
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:54,000
- It's all right, Ted...
- Come on.

873
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,680
See you later, Stan.

874
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:26,360
I've just got to
stop off for a minute.

875
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,960
Is that all right?

876
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,120
Yeah. Course.

877
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,120
Come with me.

878
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,600
(Doorbell)

879
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,480
(Doorbell)

880
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,120
(Harry) 'Who is it? '

881
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,600
It's Teddy.

882
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:58,000
What do you want? It's ten past five.

883
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:02,600
I know, I'm sorry. I need
your help, something's happened.

884
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,520
What is it?

885
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,600
(Teddy) Come in, Gal.

886
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,640
What are you doing?

887
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,480
I need a drink for my friend.
Can you fix him one?

888
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,200
So, what are you having, Gal?

889
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:37,160
Um... I'll have a whisky, please.

890
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,600
Cheers.

891
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,120
No, I'm all right.

892
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,440
Where's Don, Gal?

893
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,600
He never left Spain, I know that.

894
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,600
He never got on the plane.

895
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:38,800
Well, he did, and he got off again.

896
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:44,120
And there's no record
of him getting another flight.

897
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:52,720
I can only assume...
he's still in Spain.

898
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,640
I'm not into this any more, Ted.

899
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,600
Spain, eh?

900
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,040
Yeah.

901
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,480
I must drop in sometime.

902
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,400
Pay my respects.

903
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,400
How much did he say
you were on for this?

904
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,600
- He wasn't specific...
- I'm giving you a tenner.

905
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,440
I've only got twenties.

906
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,600
You got change?

907
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,600
You see...

908
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,400
if I cared, Gal...

909
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,120
if I fucking cared...

910
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:49,720
if I gave a solitary fuck
about Don...

911
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,600
Get out of the fucking car.

912
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,880
(Aitch) Look, with this pill,
they say you take it and that's it.

913
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:32,640
Your hair don't grow,
you don't go bald, it stays the same.

914
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,720
You have your hair cut once,
in whatever style you want,

915
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:39,600
and it stays like that for
the rest of your natural life.

916
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,640
It's revolutionary.

917
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:46,920
(Jackie) What if you get fed up
with your style, you berk?

918
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,600
Ahh... Well, that's
where the antidote comes in.

919
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,640
- Oh!
- Smart-arse.

920
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,280
The whole process is reversible.

921
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,400
You just take a different pill.

922
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:02,000
Now, I'm not saying this
is gonna happen next year

923
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:05,320
but it will happen,
it's definitely coming.

924
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,120
Hairdressers are shitting themselves.

925
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,160
(Jackie laughing) Shut up!

926
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,160
They did a test
with three monkeys, right?

927
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,720
Gave 'em all a Beatles-style haircut.

928
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,680
They've been living with that
cut for the past two years.

929
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,960
And apparently,
they're very happy with it.

930
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:27,600
(Deedee) I can't listen to this!

931
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:30,680
You hungry, love?
Shall I fix you a sandwich?

932
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,480
oh, yeah. That'd be lovely.

933
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,360
(Don) 'Told you you'd do the job.'

934
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:46,360
(Gal) 'Yeah, well...
you were right, Don.

935
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:51,200
'Technically speaking,
you were right.

936
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,520
'But you're dead.'

937
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,440
So shut up.

938
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,440
(Roars)

939
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,840
# When marimba rhythms start to play

940
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,600
# Dance with me

941
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,760
# Make me sway

942
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,400
# Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore

943
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,480
# Hold me close

944
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,640
# Sway me more

945
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:40,240
# Like a flower bending in the breeze

946
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,040
# Bend with me

947
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:44,400
# Sway with ease

948
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:47,680
# When we dance
you have a way with me

949
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:51,760
# Stay with me, sway with me

950
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:55,640
# Other dancers may be on the floor

951
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:59,600
# Dear, but my eyes
will see only you

952
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:03,600
# Only you have the magic technique

953
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:07,440
# When we sway I grow weak

954
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:11,000
# I can hear the sound of violins

955
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,040
# Long before

956
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,360
# It begins

957
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:18,720
# Make me thrill
as only you know how

958
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,600
# Sway me smooth

959
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:23,240
# Sway me now

960
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:26,240
# When marimba rhythms start to play

961
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,040
# Dance with me

962
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,200
# Make me sway

963
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:33,600
# Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore

964
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,720
# Hold me close

965
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:38,200
# Sway me more

966
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:41,920
# Other dancers may be on the floor

967
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,960
# Dear, but my eyes
will see only you

968
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:49,960
# Only you have the magic technique

969
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:53,680
# When we sway I grow weak

970
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:57,440
# I can hear the sound of violins

971
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,480
# Long before
