1
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,412
             Good.

2
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,320
     My dad had three kids.
             Ahem.

3
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:44,590
     Me, my sister, and the
           institute.

4
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:46,058
  That's just the way it was.

5
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,693
    You knew that if you had
        a baseball game

6
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:50,596
       or, I don't know,
  some sort of special event,

7
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,731
 there was always a good chance
     he might not be there.

8
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,235
  I mean, don't get me wrong,
 he was there a good amount of
           the time.

9
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,203
     Just not all the time.

10
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:04,443
I remember I tried to trick him
    into thinking I had ESP.

11
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:07,746
   Or that I was moving stuff
      around with my mind,

12
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,682
    hoping it might get him
to pay a little more attention.

13
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:13,552
      And he'd play along
       for a few minutes,

14
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:16,755
 but then he'd leave for work.

15
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,226
        I was four, um,
       when it happened.

16
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:24,129
    So I don't have too many
     memories of my father.

17
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,999
 I kinda remember what it felt
              like
        to be with him.

18
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:30,602
        Talking with me,
          holding me.

19
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,005
One thing I've always remembered
  is this game we used to play

20
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:35,674
         on nights when
      he'd put me to bed.

21
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:38,343
  He'd ask all these questions
         about animals.

22
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:41,079
         How many eyes
       does a fish have?

23
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,081
      And I'd say, "Two."

24
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,651
         How many noses
      does a monkey have?

25
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:47,653
         How many ears
      does a gopher have?

26
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:50,088
 That's really all there was to
              it.

27
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,291
I remember thinking it was fun.

28
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:59,264
    We got married in 1965.

29
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:02,401
 I wanted children right away,
   but Henry wanted to wait.

30
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:05,637
 'Cause it was about that time
    that he was starting the
           institute.

31
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,841
        And then he had
  a different research lab job

32
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:13,011
        at the same time
     so we could make rent.

33
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:16,348
        He worked a lot.
  Even after we had both kids.

34
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,584
        But he loved it.

35
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,753
           You know?

36
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:24,523
      A man has the right
       to love his work.

37
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:35,534
Our goal was
 to conduct unbiased, empirical
            research

38
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:38,403
on exceptional human abilities.

39
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,839
      Psychokinesis, ESP,
         precognition.

40
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:45,477
   Things that are typically
           considered
       fringe science or
        parapsychology.

41
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,348
 Dr. West, and the rest of us,
         quite frankly,

42
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,850
       all believed that
     there was real science

43
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,752
        to be discovered
        in these areas.

44
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,191
       We had a good time
   doing what we were doing.

45
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,026
      We were underfunded,
           of course,

46
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,061
  but we were still relatively
             young,
      so it didn't matter.

47
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,197
 In the first few years alone,

48
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,501
     we published close to
30 journal articles between us.

49
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:12,604
         And there were
 some truly exceptional cases.

50
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:15,140
        All documented.

51
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,180
Well, we did a lot of different
    kinds of tests, but, uh,

52
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:26,251
probably the most effective one
to measure clairvoyant abilities

53
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,353
     were the Zener cards.

54
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,021
           This one?

55
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,826
        It's the lines.
        The wavy lines.

56
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,430
Well, if you
  select each card at random,

57
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:41,666
     then the success ratio
     will be close to 20%.

58
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,202
  But we had several subjects

59
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:47,839
 whose ratio was closer to 30%.

60
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,242
    And that might not seem
        like very much,

61
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:53,078
       but if you realize
     that we did each test

62
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,480
        over 200 times,

63
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,382
    you begin to understand

64
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:00,051
   the virtual impossibility
        of that figure.

65
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,390
I think we were all secretly
             hoping

66
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,759
   to discover the next Nina
           Kulagina.

67
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,563
        She was a woman
 from the former Soviet Union.

68
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,498
       Truly remarkable.

69
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:18,670
 Nina's psychokinetic abilities
              were
       probably the most
        well-documented

70
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:22,073
       and they stood up
 to the strictest of scrutiny.

71
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,979
   The closest we encountered
    to that level was Norman
            LeClair.

72
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,681
      French-Canadian man.

73
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:34,853
     Norman's PK abilities
   were astounding at times.

74
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,129
That's how it works.

75
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,864
      Pretty simple, huh?

76
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,332
- Yeah.

77
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,734
 Try to vibrate the game board.

78
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,381
        It's all right.
        Take your time.

79
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,724
 That's all right. You gave it
your best shot. We can try again
             later.

80
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,797
Dr. West brought in colleagues,

81
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:22,934
  some well-known and esteemed
    researchers at the time,

82
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:25,270
       to observe Norman.

83
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,272
    All the necessary steps
           were taken

84
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:30,308
     to prevent any claims
       of researcher bias

85
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,910
  or improper testing methods.

86
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,646
All outside variables were
          controlled,

87
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:37,749
       for this was to be
   the moment the snickering,

88
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:41,620
    the talking behind hands
      would finally stop.

89
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:44,022
        This was proof.

90
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:00,305
  - God, I can't believe that.
        - Explain that.

91
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:03,141
         - As we said.
 - How do you explain that one?

92
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,105
How do you explain that?

93
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,241
   - What do you guys think?
         - Oh, my God.

94
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,209
Oh, they were clearly impressed.

95
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:39,978
          Even though,
        I'd have to say,

96
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,014
       they didn't really
  allow themselves to show it.

97
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,483
          I was happy.
     I was happy for Henry.

98
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:49,154
     He had worked so hard
        for that moment.

99
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:53,425
           But then,
  just before the researchers
            left...

100
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,494
      one of them noticed
         something odd

101
00:09:56,496 --> 00:10:00,398
       on the wristwatch
     of one of our research
          assistants.

102
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,834
  And it turned out that this
             watch

103
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:07,539
  had been rigged with a small
       neodymium magnet.

104
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,508
   And every one of our tests

105
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,844
involved metal in some capacity.

106
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:16,481
     Even the trace amounts
     of iron in the cereal.

107
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,452
And this guy had been complicit
       with Norman's ruse

108
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,020
     right from the start.

109
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:24,756
     Right under our noses.
            It was--

110
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:27,659
    it was a crushing blow.

111
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:30,295
For the institute's credibility

112
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,964
  and for Henry's reputation.

113
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,166
     It was-- it was awful.

114
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:52,384
    Is there something else
     we should know about?

115
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:54,953
            Judith?

116
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,354
           With you?

117
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,065
It's like, um...

118
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:12,270
        it's like being
      in a well sometimes.

119
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,710
  I can see it, I can hear it,
  but nobody knows I'm there.

120
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,787
  I'd-- I'd like to help you.

121
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,123
     Whatever is going on.

122
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,695
Judith was first
    brought to the institute

123
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:40,598
      in September of 1976
        by her sister--

124
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,100
        sister Margaret.

125
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:45,503
      She had been reading
  about the work we were doing

126
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,405
      in a small magazine
         or something.

127
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:51,209
    And she thought we would
be interested in testing Judith.

128
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,912
    The first thing she did
       when she walked in

129
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:56,481
        was she told me
      it was my birthday.

130
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:59,918
        Which caught me
        a bit off guard.

131
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,121
Not because it was my birthday.
   It wasn't, it was the day
            before.

132
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,356
     Maybe it was a guess.

133
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,192
            You see,
        that's something

134
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:10,061
you always have to guard against
     with the work we did.

135
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,564
         Lucky guesses.
        False positives.

136
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:17,068
If you let yourself fall victim
 to a belief bias of any kind,

137
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,372
     that's when you start
  forcing the pieces together.

138
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,675
Even when they don't fit at all.

139
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,014
           Judith...

140
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,683
      she seemed average.

141
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,518
    She's in her early 40s.

142
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,020
   Can't say there's anything
          particularly
remarkable about her appearance.

143
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:39,090
  She was kind of the type of
             person
     that you would pass by

144
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,658
   on the street in any town.

145
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,595
  You might say hello, smile,
      but that's about it.

146
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,233
     You would have no idea

147
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,301
 that Judith was what she was.

148
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:00,612
      I was older than her
        by seven years.

149
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,414
      She was a silly kid.

150
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,984
    And we had a lot of fun.

151
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,289
       There was one day,
       she was around 35,

152
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:15,426
 she slipped on a patch of ice
        on the sidewalk

153
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:18,429
       and hurt her back
         pretty badly.

154
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,334
        And after that,
she had a little trouble moving,

155
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,403
        getting around.

156
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:29,841
  And her pain was consistent.

157
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:32,243
        It was chronic.

158
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:35,580
       It was enough that
    my husband and I decided

159
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,949
     that she shouldn't be
     living alone anymore.

160
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:41,052
        So she moved in
     with us and the kids.

161
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:44,222
       About a year after
        Judith moved in,

162
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,891
     she began to withdraw.

163
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:50,295
     I mean, she would stay
     in her room for days.

164
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:53,264
          I'm not sure
      she would even eat.

165
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:56,501
   I don't know what she did
      when she was alone.

166
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:02,006
        She was reading
    some very unusual books.

167
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,408
And that's when it all started.

168
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,511
And I knew things weren't right.

169
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,479
      There were things--

170
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:12,083
       there were things
       that I saw her do

171
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:15,453
         that I just--

172
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,488
     I had to do something.

173
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,660
        And to this day,
    part of me still regrets

174
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:25,163
       doing what I did,
         but I had to.

175
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:32,136
But Dr. West was
           intrigued
with Judith almost immediately.

176
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,504
       Yeah, we all were.

177
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:36,407
         By this point,
  we'd researched hundreds of
             cases,

178
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,977
   brought in almost as many
     subjects into the lab.

179
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,581
 Judith was different, though.

180
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,685
      We just had no idea
  how different at this point.

181
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,431
Um, ahem.
   Can you tell us your name,
            please?

182
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,834
     Ahem. Judith Winstead.

183
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:04,669
 And what's your date of birth,
            Judith?

184
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:07,906
      February 18th, 1935.

185
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,074
    And your marital status?

186
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,976
        I'm not married.

187
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,811
      Have you ever been?

188
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:16,347
             Okay.
 How many siblings do you have?

189
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,651
              One.

190
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,519
 Are your parents still alive?

191
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,991
- Judith, are your parents still
             alive?
             - No.

192
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,694
   Okay. Are you right-handed
        or left-handed?

193
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:34,699
  Judith's behavior was always
              odd.
  Even from the first day she
            arrived.

194
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:38,503
  But in our field, it wasn't
            uncommon
    to encounter odd people.

195
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,471
   So we didn't give it much
            thought.

196
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,175
Ms. Winstead?

197
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,844
         Right-handed.

198
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,081
And when did you first realize

199
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,617
   you had certain abilities?

200
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,056
  Are you-- are you all right,
             dear?

201
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,191
Oh...

202
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:03,027
        You're bleeding.
          Oh, my God.

203
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,762
Here's some...

204
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,931
Give her some towels.

205
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,067
Oh, uh, tilt your head back,
             okay?

206
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:12,136
It's not her nose,
   it's her hand. Her hand is
           bleeding.

207
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,006
What?
Did you-- did you bite yourself?

208
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,377
Why?

209
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:22,480
     Susan, let's get her--
  get her to the ladies' room,
            please.

210
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,549
As long as you're okay with it.

211
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,351
       That's all right.
   Just take her-- that's all
             right.

212
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,353
Just take care of her.

213
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,323
Judith?

214
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,925
- Wait, is she-- no, no, no.

215
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:35,493
       What is she doing?
             Stop.

216
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,729
- Just stop. Calm down.
- Let go.

217
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,298
Ms. Winstead.
     Judith, stop, please.

218
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,602
      Well, for starters,
Judith came to us in an unusual
              way.

219
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:48,239
Most times, we learn of someone
       and seek them out.

220
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,441
         We had no idea
   Judith was even out there.

221
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,079
         Nevertheless,
       she tested beyond

222
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,148
     what any of us thought
       was even possible.

223
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,953
     There was no measure.

224
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:05,156
        Truly no measure
       for her abilities.

225
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,227
 If you can, try for seven this
             time.

226
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,928
        Any combination.

227
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,333
Three and four.

228
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:18,336
One and six.

229
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:20,772
Three and four.

230
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,042
One and six.

231
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,747
Two and five.

232
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,184
 Uh, Judith, what I'd like you
          to try to do

233
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,987
      is to move the wheel
 without actually touching it.

234
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:42,660
 Try to concentrate your mind.
      Focus your thoughts.

235
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,603
 She outperformed every subject
       we'd ever studied.

236
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,573
    There was no comparison
          to be made.

237
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,677
   I understand how peculiar
         it might seem

238
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,414
to hear her abilities described
   in this way, but they were
            godlike.

239
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,424
         Okay, Judith,
   what do you see this time?

240
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,329
           - Judith?
            - Star.

241
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,001
        - And this time.
           - Square.

242
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,406
And what do you see this time?

243
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,308
              Mm.

244
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,078
   Judith, are you all right?

245
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,813
   Are you all right, Judith?
            Do you--

246
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,548
        can we continue
       with the exercise?

247
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,618
       - I think she's--
           - Judith?

248
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,587
      I think she's okay.
    All right, let's resume.

249
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:43,921
         Judith, what--

250
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,892
        - The card bent.
            - What?

251
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,863
- That card bent. We're taking a
             break.
      - What do you mean?

252
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,699
           Dr. West?

253
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,105
Looking back, I--

254
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:03,674
   I guess I should've known
            better.

255
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,445
    I mean, yes, we'd seen--

256
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:10,848
    witnessed amazing things
          in the past.

257
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,451
     But nothing like that.

258
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,586
  Nothing, nothing like that.

259
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,891
      Inverse square law.

260
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,592
   Conservation of momentum.

261
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:24,562
  These were well-established
        laws of physics

262
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:25,997
   that were being violated.

263
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,065
         The second law
       of thermodynamics.

264
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:31,302
         All of these.
   We should've been scared.

265
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,205
            Someone
  with that much power would--

266
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,642
    but we were too excited
         to be scared.

267
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:40,411
   We finally had the proof--

268
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,480
       not another hoax--

269
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,582
   that we'd been seeking for
             years.

270
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,587
   We had our Nina Kulagina.

271
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,466
What I remember,
       she was due to...

272
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,436
   stay overnight in the lab
      through the weekend.

273
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:06,904
    We did this quite often
         with subjects

274
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,806
    because anomalous events

275
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:11,642
        sometimes occur
  during the deep-sleep cycle.

276
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:14,312
 And we monitored the subjects
       through the night

277
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:16,781
using various recording devices.

278
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,823
During Judith's first overnight,
  we only had one staff member
            present.

279
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,391
            Kenneth.

280
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:31,028
       I don't ever think
     I knew his last name.

281
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,297
   He was a graduate student
          at the time.

282
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,865
        Nice, quiet kid.

283
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,435
  Came from a farming family.
I remember that because so do I.

284
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:43,608
     He was-- he was alone
     with Judith that night

285
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,176
 sitting not far from her bed.

286
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:48,246
   I don't even think he knew
   that he was being recorded

287
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,381
        because you can
        see him smoking

288
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:52,550
    which he wasn't supposed
    to be doing in the lab.

289
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,587
  Nothing happened for hours.

290
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,984
     Nobody ever found out
         what happened.

291
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:03,854
      But whatever did...

292
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,991
      that was it for him.

293
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,926
        Never came back.

294
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:36,053
     W-we tried contacting
   Judith's sister, Margaret.

295
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:37,855
     We couldn't reach her.

296
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,025
 She'd disconnected her phone.

297
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:44,729
    It became clear at that
           moment...

298
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:46,964
         that Margaret
       had abandoned her.

299
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,469
        The decision now
   was what we were gonna do.

300
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:53,871
 I could tell that Lawrence was
            already
  reaching a bit of a breaking
             point.

301
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,440
        It was obvious.

302
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:58,909
      It wasn't so obvious
         with Dr. West.

303
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,512
       Not to me anyway.

304
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,284
Well, we simply
       made the decision

305
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:10,488
       that we were going
  to continue our testing with
              her.

306
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,226
     But after that night,
 it became extremely difficult.

307
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,830
      It was so unnerving.

308
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:21,499
         Her behavior.

309
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:24,535
    It was so incredibly...

310
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:26,670
      she would say things

311
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:29,206
 and do things that made you...

312
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,511
She would scream in that voice.

313
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:35,112
Grab her!

314
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,382
        It wasn't hers.

315
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:40,484
     It was like an animal.

316
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:45,389
Henry seemed most affected by
              it.

317
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:48,893
       He tried his best
to shield the others from that.

318
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:51,328
 I knew him well enough to know

319
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,031
  that he was deeply affected.

320
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,070
I watched my father change
           firsthand.

321
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:04,008
 And I have no doubt whatsoever
 that what happened in that lab

322
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,944
      caused that change.

323
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,914
I remember being
      in the seventh grade

324
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,749
          years later,

325
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:13,818
and other kids making fun of me.

326
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,254
        Call him crazy.

327
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:19,089
    They'd say I'd be crazy.

328
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:24,228
Back then,
it was different than it is now.

329
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,831
 Now everyone has a therapist.

330
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:29,500
     They go for anything--
          stubbed toe.

331
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:31,135
         But back then,

332
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:34,305
       you went if it was
         something bad.

333
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:42,580
         And especially
  if medication was involved.

334
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:45,082
   And in my husband's case,
            it was.

335
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,389
Why do you say that, Henry?

336
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:54,124
You don't understand.

337
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:58,028
Okay.
   - I see what's happening.

338
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,897
At work?

339
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,934
I can't help you
      if you don't tell me

340
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:05,836
- what you think is happening.
- I can't tell you.

341
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,040
What are you so afraid of,
             Henry?

342
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,949
    I know it's very trying,

343
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,452
    but we would really like
          to continue.

344
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:25,489
  - Can you please stop that,
            Judith?
  - Can you please stop that,
            please?

345
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:30,094
We'd really like to continue--

346
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:33,364
   We had about 10 different
            degrees
          between us.

347
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,566
   Including one in medicine,

348
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:37,234
      three in psychology.

349
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:40,538
         And we knew...

350
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,574
      that was not normal.

351
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:49,046
Judith was not
    a typical test subject.

352
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:52,016
       She had made that
abundantly clear by that point.

353
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:56,554
           And I felt
        we needed help.

354
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:06,597
I received a file
     from another analyst.

355
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:08,632
  It was something he thought
    I should take a look at.

356
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:13,270
    We started a program to
  investigate psi in the early
             '70s.

357
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:15,005
    Psi-related phenomenon.

358
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:18,242
   About five years after KGB
   conducted similar studies.

359
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:23,914
   I didn't have the highest
     expectations going in.

360
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,050
      I felt we'd already
      been down that road.

361
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:29,086
      And it proved to be
   a waste of time and money.

362
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:32,656
  But Marcus was a friend of a
            friend,
         and so I went.

363
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,894
   It's difficult to explain.

364
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,532
But you could feel something...

365
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:46,804
           a weight,
      an invisible weight.

366
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,208
         The whole lab
      took on that feeling

367
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,577
     the minute he stepped
       through the door.

368
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,315
It was if he
          represented
      a challenge to her,

369
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,150
         to her power.

370
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:03,287
     Everything we had seen
      up until that point,

371
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:06,090
  everything Judith had done,
   everything we'd witnessed,

372
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:10,861
       it barely compared
   to what happened after he
            arrived.

373
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:14,164
I assumed they'd run
through the usual battery of psi
             tests.

374
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:18,435
The cards, the elaborate devices
   with the numbers, but they
            didn't.

375
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:21,505
 They told me that those tests
     weren't right for her.

376
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:28,078
This here's a way
      to convince anyone.

377
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,016
    Easiest and simplest way
  to begin the demonstration.

378
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,508
       Now you understand
 why we've called you in here.

379
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,044
  That can't be accounted for

380
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:03,847
       through any known
     rational explanation.

381
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:07,351
  And she's able to repeat it
  with a variety of different
           materials.

382
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,286
     Breaking the third law
      of thermal dynamics.

383
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,431
By the time the man
 from the Defense Intelligence
            Agency,

384
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:22,332
     Robert Koepp, arrived,

385
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:24,435
        we'd given up on
our standard testing procedure.

386
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:27,137
Well, we'd simply talked to her.

387
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,009
      It was so difficult.

388
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,146
          She knew...

389
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,050
           too much.

390
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,420
      Think of any object.

391
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,489
- Something in the room?
  - No, it doesn't have to be.

392
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:47,257
  No, let's make it something
        not in the room.

393
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,693
- Okay.
- Okay.

394
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,663
   Draw what you see, please.

395
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,682
        And what object
     were you thinking of?

396
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:13,417
           A hammer.

397
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,826
          - Excuse me.
            - Susan?

398
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:25,729
            - Susan.
         - Henry, she--

399
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:27,798
You don't frighten me!

400
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,267
   - You don't fucking know!
       - Susan! Stop it!

401
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,070
- What are you doing?!
- Marcus!

402
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:34,505
- Susan, calm down.
- How dare you?!

403
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:36,206
   - You don't know anything!
  - Take her outside, please.

404
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,342
     Just take her outside.

405
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:40,677
She had drawn a shamrock.

406
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,249
         Back in 1973,
      three years earlier,

407
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:47,985
 I had travelled back to London
     for my mum's funeral.

408
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:51,789
       I was devastated.

409
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:56,960
   Her family had immigrated
     to London from Ireland

410
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,797
     and she was very proud
     of her Irish heritage.

411
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,066
       And in her casket,

412
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:04,701
  she had worn the same brooch
        that she'd worn

413
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:06,837
 almost every day of her life.

414
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,109
       It was a shamrock.

415
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:14,077
 As soon as I saw that picture,

416
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,680
     I realized what Judith
      had whispered to me.

417
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:21,151
      "You weren't there."

418
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,088
         Which is true,
           I wasn't.

419
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,492
         My mother died
 the day before I made it home.

420
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,230
       And that woman...

421
00:30:33,232 --> 00:30:35,999
           that thing
       somehow knew that.

422
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:39,203
      And how much guilt.

423
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,073
         She wanted me
      to behave that way.

424
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:45,442
She wanted me to react that way.

425
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,779
        To humiliate me
      in front of my peers

426
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:52,115
 by turning me into everything
 I had tried so hard not to be.

427
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:03,060
 Well, the incident with Susan
      was very unsettling

428
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:06,430
    because it demonstrated
 Judith's ability to influence
              us.

429
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:09,299
       She was definitely
       influencing Henry.

430
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:12,736
    He started to pull back.
     Which was unlike him.

431
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:16,206
  I thought he was gonna fight
 the government's involvement,

432
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,841
    but that didn't happen.

433
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:21,245
          He withdrew
      and they took over.

434
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:47,070
My arm!

435
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,306
Use the strap right there.

436
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:51,742
Please, step back.
You're gonna break her
              arm.

437
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:57,414
Please, step back.
What are you giving
              her?

438
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:05,155
Tell Robert.

439
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,721
Heartbeat's back again. Mark
              it.

440
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:40,590
   14 minutes and 27 seconds.

441
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:45,295
 - Any physical deterioration?
           - Nothing.

442
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,464
- Jesus.

443
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,933
She's pissing again.
        Get the towels.

444
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:52,269
It's over there. Get it.

445
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,975
No.
   - That's good. Thank you.

446
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:00,243
Step back.

447
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,883
Check her! Make sure she's all
             right!

448
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,620
Not that, that.

449
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:13,824
      Once they witnessed
   the things we'd all seen,

450
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:16,593
           it became
   a very different scenario.

451
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:19,563
     It didn't matter what
  my preconceived notions were

452
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:21,431
 before visiting the institute.

453
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:24,334
       What mattered now
     was national security.

454
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,503
   We left nothing to chance.

455
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,372
          All evidence
    was thoroughly reviewed

456
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:30,707
   by top Defense Department
           analysts.

457
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,876
 Tissue samples were extracted.

458
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:34,644
      Blood samples taken.

459
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:37,881
 Plans were immediately put in
             place
   to contain the situation.

460
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:39,383
 The institute was locked down.

461
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:44,054
   We assumed control of all
            testing
  and information collection.

462
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:46,823
   Strict security protocols
       were put in place.

463
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:49,292
     This was a coordinated
        military effort

464
00:33:49,294 --> 00:33:52,195
 with support from the highest
             levels
       of the government.

465
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:55,599
    Soldiers were stationed
around the clock inside the lab,

466
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:57,267
       all of them armed.

467
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:01,004
We were there because we
          believed it.

468
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:02,873
    Now we wanted to see it.

469
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,177
The camera's ready.

470
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:09,546
- Lights ready.
- Flashing.

471
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,833
I think he's having a
            seizure.

472
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:31,301
- Henry?
- Doctor, Doctor!

473
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,336
- Get a hand under his head.
- Turn the lights on.

474
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:36,306
- Keep his mouth open.
- Turn the lights on!

475
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:38,742
Where is she?

476
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,215
Stop the flashing now!

477
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:51,888
 The DIA report prompted swift
            action.

478
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,256
   We looked at the evidence,

479
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:56,026
    we reviewed the footage
    of the seizure incident.

480
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:59,996
   Dr. West had no history of
            epilepsy
   or any related condition,

481
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:01,932
    so it's highly unlikely

482
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:03,767
    that the flashing lights
     could've triggered it.

483
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,936
 We could not say definitively

484
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:08,839
       that Ms. Winstead
      caused the seizure,

485
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:12,342
        but we certainly
  couldn't rule it out either.

486
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:16,279
 Several meetings were held to
            discuss
the seriousness of this threat.

487
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:20,584
 I can't speak to the specifics
     of what was discussed,

488
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:22,919
     but suffice it to say

489
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:25,789
if you're gonna inform the White
             House
 of something as crazy as this,

490
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:28,291
  you better be damn sure it's
             true.

491
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,797
All psychological
      and pharmacological

492
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,833
  explanations were ruled out.

493
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:41,104
Her blood samples came back with
  impossibly high electrolyte
            levels.

494
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:46,209
      A completely unknown
       molecular compound

495
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:48,478
    was found in her tissue.

496
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,781
   Something was inside her.

497
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:53,617
      No doubt about that.

498
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:55,752
         Not a disease.

499
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:58,655
        Not a parasite.

500
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,457
            An evil.

501
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,439
Do you think you know

502
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,008
    what caused the seizure?

503
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,045
- Henry?
- Yes.

504
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:25,615
    - Are you taking the new
          medication?
  - It has nothing to do with
             that.

505
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:27,517
     Henry, it is important
        that you keep--

506
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,120
I am taking it.

507
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:32,422
  I'm seeing things at night.

508
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:38,128
     I can't stop thinking
       about everything.

509
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,630
         I try, but...

510
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:46,469
   And even when I'm with my
            family,
           I feel it.

511
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,740
          I'm afraid.

512
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,878
    I'm afraid of what might
        happen to them.

513
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:59,082
           But, yes,
I am taking the new medication.

514
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,721
The story was that when the KGB

515
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,691
         learned about
    Nina Kulagina's ability,

516
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:10,126
     they performed a test
      with a living frog.

517
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:12,696
     This was back in 1970.

518
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:16,600
  The Soviets wanted to see if
              Nina
  could telekinetically affect

519
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:19,970
   the bioelectrical impulses
       in living tissue.

520
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:23,006
   To speed up and slow down
         its heartbeat.

521
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:26,009
         And allegedly,
            she did.

522
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:28,278
       So our government
         wanted to see

523
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,381
    if they could replicate
   those results with Judith.

524
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,331
Good God.

525
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:26,269
Jesus.

526
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:32,042
Why's he barking?
 - It's her. She's still doing
              it.

527
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,550
She's doing it to the dog.

528
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,686
            No, her!

529
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,657
Turn on the lights!
      Turn on the lights!

530
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:56,266
     Secure this room now.
           Right now!

531
00:38:56,268 --> 00:38:57,967
       All right, quiet.

532
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,703
             Quiet.

533
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:02,939
    Quiet! Everyone, quiet.

534
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,812
          Don't move.

535
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:17,320
What the-- somebody look.
Robert, what's
           happening?

536
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:20,056
Take it down. Quiet.

537
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:21,825
          Shh. Quiet.

538
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,732
Marcus.

539
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:30,834
Shh. Shh.

540
00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:33,370
- Nobody move. Nobody move.
- Ah! Who's touching me?

541
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:35,538
Turn on the light!
 Turn on the light now. Turn it
              on.

542
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,740
Turn that light back on.

543
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,283
Grab her!

544
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:19,215
Imagine being 22, 23 years old,

545
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:22,352
    best shape of your life,
      armed to the teeth.

546
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,455
         And you scared
    of some lady looked like

547
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:27,991
       she could've been
  your primary school teacher.

548
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:30,827
 That's what was going on then.

549
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:35,298
        You understand?

550
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,234
          Things took
 a significant turn after that.

551
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:42,305
       I think in total,
         there were...

552
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:46,476
   six or seven unexplainable
    incidents that occurred.

553
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:49,212
   All outside the institute.

554
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,782
     One of the government
      researcher's cousins

555
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,117
  almost died in a car wreck.

556
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:57,520
   There was, uh, a soldier's
             father
     was attacked by a dog.

557
00:40:57,522 --> 00:41:00,123
    There was a house fire,
    if I remember correctly.

558
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,559
     And on and on it went.

559
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,129
  Now, each of these things on
           their own
    could be a coincidence,

560
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:08,431
 but the likelihood that all of
              them
     would happen together

561
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:11,100
   to the family and friends
  of this same group of people

562
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:13,837
    in the same span of time

563
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,739
     is astonishingly low.

564
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:20,410
     My son Jeffrey started
  waking up night after night

565
00:41:20,412 --> 00:41:23,446
 screaming with night terrors.

566
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:26,382
  My wife and I found out that

567
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:29,919
        that was common
        among toddlers.

568
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,754
         I don't know.

569
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:33,556
 I don't know if it is or not.

570
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:36,726
   It was-- it was so eerie.

571
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,332
           I just...

572
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:48,204
  I was starting to think that
             maybe
 my work was following me home.

573
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:52,809
     I felt bad for Sarge.

574
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:55,645
 His father got bit up real bad
         by some stray.

575
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:57,514
       Pit bull, I think.

576
00:41:57,516 --> 00:41:59,682
      And let me tell ya,

577
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,951
           she knew.

578
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,854
   The day after it happened,

579
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,789
    she kept staring at him.

580
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,460
 He hadn't told any one of us.

581
00:42:10,462 --> 00:42:13,062
          Nobody knew
    for about another week.

582
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:14,564
         But she knew.

583
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:19,135
        The whole time,
           she knew.

584
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,875
  It was late one night in the
              lab.

585
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,914
    And I happened to notice
   a paper clip on the floor

586
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:35,051
  inside the air lock portion
     of Judith's enclosure.

587
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,988
     Now, that environment
     was meticulously kept.

588
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,223
     It was nearly sterile.

589
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:43,560
   So there was no explaining
       how it got there.

590
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,965
           Anyway...

591
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:51,267
        I picked it up,
   I stuffed it in my pocket

592
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:53,603
       and didn't give it
        another thought.

593
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:57,640
  We were at my sister's house
   for my nephew's birthday.

594
00:42:57,642 --> 00:43:01,911
 My wife and I never had kids,
so Matthew was very dear to us.

595
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:07,383
         And I remember
      reaching for my keys

596
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:09,619
 and thinking I heard something
      fall onto the ground

597
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:11,487
        from my pocket.

598
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,162
     It was the paper clip.

599
00:43:27,072 --> 00:43:28,538
      Burt, knock it off.

600
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,139
      - Claire, it's Matt!
            - What?!

601
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:32,075
            Matthew!

602
00:43:32,077 --> 00:43:34,477
- Oh, my God!

603
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,179
Matthew? Matthew?

604
00:43:36,181 --> 00:43:38,748
- Oh, my God! Sweetheart!
- He's not breathing!

605
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:43,519
         He'd stuck it
       in a wall socket.

606
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,192
        I could've worn
   any other pants that day,

607
00:43:49,194 --> 00:43:50,660
       but I wore those.

608
00:43:50,662 --> 00:43:53,296
    And that paper clip just
 happened to be what he found?

609
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,566
  Out of all the things in the
            world--

610
00:43:56,568 --> 00:43:58,067
      a balled-up receipt,
    a stick of bubble gum--

611
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:02,071
  that's what happened to fall
out of my pocket at that moment?

612
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:04,741
        Not at any point
 in the five days before that?

613
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:06,542
    Not-- not anywhere else?

614
00:44:06,544 --> 00:44:08,778
  Not in-- not in the hamper?

615
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,080
    In the washing machine?
      In the dryer? There?

616
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:13,983
        On his birthday?

617
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:19,088
And the way the dog was barking,
it was-- it was-- it was like...

618
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:27,463
         What happened
        was no accident.

619
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,870
          That was it.
        I'd had enough.

620
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,840
 It was 10 years until I heard
      from Lawrence again.

621
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,910
He and his wife moved out of the
            country
   shortly after it happened.

622
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:47,150
I was surprised he didn't leave
  the institute sooner than he
              did.

623
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,553
         It was a shame
  what happened to his nephew.

624
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:56,259
     I don't think Lawrence
  ever really forgave himself.

625
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:01,964
 Well, we couldn't discount the
             events
   that happened outside the
           institute.

626
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:04,367
       Too much happened
   for it to be coincidence.

627
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:07,670
     But what it did do is
 make us rethink our strategy.

628
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,078
What are we gonna use
       to immobilize her?

629
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,946
           Fentanyl.

630
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:19,749
    The gas derivative of it
should knock her out in seconds.

631
00:45:19,751 --> 00:45:22,218
It could also kill her.

632
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,353
    Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
          No, no, no.

633
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:26,622
Whoa, hey.
You can't keep her
           in there.

634
00:45:26,624 --> 00:45:30,026
    - Now's not the time for
          compassion.
     - She's a human being.

635
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:32,762
  There are laws against that
sort of treatment for a reason.

636
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:34,731
        Who do you think
       makes those laws?

637
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:37,200
       - This is my lab.
  - No, not anymore it's not.

638
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:40,103
 I have sat back and kept quiet
     while I've seen you--

639
00:45:40,105 --> 00:45:42,338
And you'd do well to stay quiet.

640
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:49,078
      Get him outta here.

641
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,581
       I never should've
       called you people.

642
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:53,783
            Hold on.

643
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,988
        You really think
you're equipped to handle this?

644
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:05,428
 Your little lab here with your
 flash cards and ESP machines?

645
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,001
           See it...

646
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,945
      but then it's gone.

647
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,250
       Now it comes back.

648
00:46:27,252 --> 00:46:30,653
        You can see that
  in the rest of the pictures.

649
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,160
    For those few moments...

650
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,497
     it wasn't in the room.

651
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,401
         Might not even
     been in the building.

652
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,340
       Do you understand
     what I'm telling you?

653
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:58,514
     We don't control this,
it's not just us who will be at
             risk.

654
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:05,021
   And if you do control it,

655
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:07,156
   then who will be at risk?

656
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,273
We recognized
   the danger of allowing it

657
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:27,910
         to remain even
     remotely unrestricted.

658
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:32,481
   It was immensely powerful.

659
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:35,351
  And rather than continually
       try to explain it,

660
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:39,388
     the decision was made
   to attempt to harness it.

661
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,864
     Repeat the following:

662
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:51,167
  one, two, three, four, five.

663
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,707
  Your instructions are clear.

664
00:47:57,709 --> 00:47:59,275
     Repeat the following:

665
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:02,612
  one, two, three, four, five.

666
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:10,119
      You will cooperate.

667
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:20,630
       Now, this is a map

668
00:48:20,632 --> 00:48:24,200
      divided into a grid
  consisting of five sections.

669
00:48:24,202 --> 00:48:27,403
  One, two, three, four, five.

670
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:31,841
 I want you to listen carefully
        and concentrate.

671
00:48:31,843 --> 00:48:35,211
      There are artillery
     and biological weapons

672
00:48:35,213 --> 00:48:38,281
     being stored somewhere
        in this region.

673
00:48:38,283 --> 00:48:40,449
        Look at the grid

674
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:43,419
          and tell me
      the number of where.

675
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,993
         Tell me where
     they're being stored.

676
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:58,734
      You will cooperate.
          Put it away.

677
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:09,278
     Part of me will always
       feel responsible.

678
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:14,116
     Because it was my idea
    to notify the military.

679
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:19,655
       I don't know what
  we would've done otherwise.

680
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:22,692
        But I do wonder

681
00:49:22,694 --> 00:49:24,961
         if Henry might
      still be alive today

682
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:27,863
 if I had settled on a more...

683
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:33,369
      reasonable solution.

684
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:42,078
Sergeant.

685
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:46,115
        Do you hear me?

686
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:51,120
         Ms. Winstead,
       your instructions

687
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:54,991
  are to make Sergeant Parella
   say exactly the following:

688
00:49:56,326 --> 00:50:01,597
     reposition all nuclear
           submarines
     out of the Baltic Sea.

689
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,500
          Once again,

690
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:09,839
     reposition all nuclear
           submarines
     out of the Baltic Sea.

691
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,949
  Your instructions are clear.

692
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,067
How many eyes does a fish have?

693
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:41,103
Turn up his volume.
 - How many ears does a gopher
             have?

694
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:43,773
         How many noses
      does a monkey have?

695
00:50:43,775 --> 00:50:46,042
         How many arms
       does a whale have?

696
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:48,744
         How many hoofs
       does a horse have?

697
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:51,947
- How many noses does a monkey
             have?
Dr. West?

698
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:54,083
- How many stripes does a zebra
             have?
          - Dr. West.

699
00:50:54,085 --> 00:50:56,052
         How many eyes
       does a fish have?

700
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:58,721
         How many ears
     does an elephant have?

701
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:01,190
        How many stripes
       does a zebra have?

702
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:03,459
         How many eyes
       does a fish have?

703
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:06,362
- How many eyes does a fish
             have?
Henry.

704
00:51:06,364 --> 00:51:09,165
How many noses does a monkey
             have?

705
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:12,334
Dr. West.
 - How many noses does a monkey
             have?

706
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:15,337
         How many noses
      does a monkey have?

707
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:17,907
      How many noses does
         a monkey have?

708
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:20,910
         How many noses
      does a monkey have?

709
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:22,144
- How many noses--

710
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:28,084
       You can't control
      something like that.

711
00:51:28,086 --> 00:51:30,252
   I don't care who you are,

712
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:32,121
   how many weapons you have.

713
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,357
All those things that went on...

714
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,831
  you don't get to play games
        with the Devil.

715
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:44,333
  And if you do, you damn sure
  don't get to make the rules.

716
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,073
      That type of evil...

717
00:51:51,075 --> 00:51:55,077
    just thinking about it,
       talking about it.

718
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,648
        Even you people
      making this movie...

719
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:01,851
 and the people watching it...

720
00:52:01,853 --> 00:52:04,653
        you're inviting

721
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:07,823
   bad things into your life.

722
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,929
        Too late for me.

723
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:17,066
   All the things I've seen.

724
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:26,075
This wasn't like the books

725
00:52:26,077 --> 00:52:28,611
         or the movies
   or false accounts you hear
             about.

726
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:31,247
If those cases were legitimate,
       I can assure you,

727
00:52:31,249 --> 00:52:32,982
    we would've intervened.

728
00:52:32,984 --> 00:52:35,251
         This is real.

729
00:52:35,253 --> 00:52:37,353
 There was no speculative data.

730
00:52:37,355 --> 00:52:40,089
    There was no charlatans
    looking to make a buck.

731
00:52:40,091 --> 00:52:45,127
This was the only governmentally
 confirmed case of possession.

732
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:48,664
 Arguably the most significant
        thing we learned

733
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:50,866
was that it had an intelligence.

734
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:52,668
        That meant that
     it was able to conduct

735
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,171
          some form of
     cost-benefit analysis.

736
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:59,375
    Our plan was to utilize
     its ability to reason

737
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:03,012
      as a stopgap measure
    to clear a psychological
            pathway.

738
00:53:03,014 --> 00:53:05,648
      So they essentially
      offered it a choice

739
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,917
      between cooperating
         or suffering.

740
00:53:07,919 --> 00:53:09,852
   But it was a false choice

741
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:13,789
      because both options
    caused Judith to suffer.

742
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:17,860
 Their belief was that if they
could control her physical body,

743
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:19,962
       chiefly her mind,

744
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:23,632
       they could control
   how the force manifested.

745
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:28,537
     Possess the possession

746
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,105
    is what they would say.

747
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:33,742
  As if it was gonna work that
              way.

748
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:38,414
Clear, go again.

749
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:14,049
  They pushed that poor woman
         to her limits.

750
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:17,353
        Judith Winstead,
          the person.

751
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:20,689
    I felt terrible for her.

752
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:23,726
     But there was nothing
    we could do to help her.

753
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,738
Please, stop.

754
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,773
         Please, stop.

755
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,842
We were eventually
    able to devise a method

756
00:54:39,844 --> 00:54:41,810
    of governing the force.

757
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:44,046
    Once we controlled her,

758
00:54:44,048 --> 00:54:46,282
            we could
    effectively control it.

759
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:48,350
      Once that happened,

760
00:54:48,352 --> 00:54:52,021
 the nature of our involvement
     changed dramatically.

761
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:53,782
      It was... shocking.

762
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:57,720
But it wasn't at the same time.

763
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,756
 We knew something was coming.

764
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:05,227
            I mean,
 a few nights before that, I...

765
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:10,966
 found him curled up in a ball
    under the bathroom sink.

766
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:15,838
      Talking to himself.

767
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,773
            Crying.

768
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:20,542
            I mean,
    he was scared to death.

769
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,448
       Henry was nearing
      the end of his rope.

770
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:30,853
         After a while,
 he rarely even set foot in the
              lab.

771
00:56:30,855 --> 00:56:34,723
     He would lock himself
  in the office for hours at a
             time.

772
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:37,993
  Sometimes you could hear him
muttering from behind the door.

773
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:41,797
      Things were reaching
        a tipping point.

774
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,902
I do. I do believe
that it drove Dr. West to that.

775
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:49,438
           Trust me.
  We did a complete background
             check.

776
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,140
      We knew everything.

777
00:56:51,142 --> 00:56:53,842
   We knew about the therapy,
        the medication.

778
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:58,380
         What happened
was not a product of psychosis.

779
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:06,755
Maybe you should
 take some time away from work.

780
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,826
             Henry?
   Maybe take some time off?

781
00:57:10,828 --> 00:57:12,594
 It doesn't matter where I am.
        It's everywhere.

782
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:15,697
      It's like a shadow.
     Except it's not mine.

783
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:18,066
So you feel like it's following
              you,
          the shadow.

784
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:19,835
I feel like it's already caught
              me.

785
00:57:19,837 --> 00:57:24,039
  To be totally honest, Henry,
   I find a lot of this very
           troubling.

786
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:25,908
 Is that why you're using that?

787
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:29,044
- We always record the sessions.
       - Not on a camera.

788
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:31,580
           Well, I--
     things seem different.

789
00:57:31,582 --> 00:57:33,882
  - Did they make you do this?
           - Did who?

790
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:36,418
      Is this to make sure
     I don't say anything?

791
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,753
       I don't know what
     you're talking about.

792
00:57:37,755 --> 00:57:39,288
  They're pushing it too far.

793
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:41,390
They want to control everything,
        but they can't.

794
00:57:41,392 --> 00:57:43,459
       It's too powerful.

795
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:45,093
        It's too strong.

796
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:47,396
      Take it easy, Henry.

797
00:57:47,398 --> 00:57:49,264
     I'm trying to make you
          understand.

798
00:57:49,266 --> 00:57:51,567
  There's something happening.

799
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:57,406
           - To you?
             - Yes.

800
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:02,077
   To me, then maybe to you,
      then maybe to them.

801
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,146
      Whoever it chooses.

802
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:07,983
       There's no science
  left in the world for this,

803
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,718
    but they think there is.

804
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:14,656
 It doesn't even matter anymore
          what I say.

805
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:17,292
  It's gonna speak for itself.
  So use your goddamn camera.

806
00:58:17,294 --> 00:58:20,629
         Write my name.
 Write my words across the sky.

807
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:22,931
      I don't give a damn
        because if it--

808
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:26,635
    if they keep pushing it
      the way they are...

809
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:04,907
    Nod if you can hear me.

810
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:10,679
             Good.

811
00:59:10,681 --> 00:59:11,980
   What I want you to do now

812
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:14,650
     is focus on the person
       on the television.

813
00:59:14,652 --> 00:59:16,285
     Nod if you understand.

814
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,458
I want you to tell me his name.

815
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:30,265
  Your instructions are clear.

816
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:33,135
 Tell me the name of the person
   you see on the television.

817
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,975
             Alan.

818
00:59:39,977 --> 00:59:41,710
            Turcott.

819
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:51,987
  Next, I want you to tell me
     his current location.

820
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,757
            Hanscom.

821
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,029
            Office.
        Military office.

822
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:12,641
  Let's get them on the phone.

823
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:21,883
- Tell them we're gonna try it
              out.
We're gonna try it out.

824
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:28,423
         They're ready.

825
01:00:28,425 --> 01:00:30,892
     Listen very carefully
  to what I'm gonna tell you.

826
01:00:30,894 --> 01:00:32,761
   What I want you to do now

827
01:00:32,763 --> 01:00:35,897
    is attempt to influence
  Private Turcott's breathing.

828
01:00:35,899 --> 01:00:37,265
             Begin.

829
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:48,810
  Your instructions are clear.

830
01:01:13,137 --> 01:01:14,836
- Tell her to stop it.
           - Stop it.

831
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,271
      - Tell her to stop!
            - Stop.

832
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:18,540
          I said stop!

833
01:01:18,542 --> 01:01:21,243
- Okay. Hit her!

834
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:35,357
   We eventually figured out
       what was going on.

835
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,226
     And we felt so foolish
   for not having recognized

836
01:01:38,228 --> 01:01:41,329
 that that was the government's
 intention from the beginning.

837
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:43,832
       To weaponize her.

838
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:47,769
       Having the ability
   to remotely collect intel.

839
01:01:47,771 --> 01:01:50,338
  To be able to read the minds
       of foreign leaders

840
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:53,775
        to know exactly
 what their plan of attack is.

841
01:01:53,777 --> 01:01:57,045
 Where they were and what they
   were thinking at any given
            moment.

842
01:01:57,047 --> 01:02:00,449
       And, if necessary,

843
01:02:00,451 --> 01:02:04,486
  being able to collapse their
             lungs
     and stop their hearts.

844
01:02:04,488 --> 01:02:07,322
  All from thousands of miles
             away.

845
01:02:07,324 --> 01:02:10,025
 We were looking at the future
    of clandestine warfare.

846
01:02:10,027 --> 01:02:13,128
     Where attacks could be
          as strategic

847
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:16,031
       and as untraceable
         as we saw fit.

848
01:02:16,033 --> 01:02:18,934
The rigors of their
            testing
 protocol increased enormously.

849
01:02:18,936 --> 01:02:22,237
     The more they pushed,
  the more defiant she became.

850
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:25,974
        Well, it became.

851
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:05,514
    We treated her like the
           discovery
 of any new destructive force.

852
01:03:05,516 --> 01:03:08,583
      Much of what we did
mirrored the testing procedures

853
01:03:08,585 --> 01:03:11,086
    used in the early atomic
            testing.

854
01:03:11,088 --> 01:03:13,822
          We needed to
     understand this power

855
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:15,891
       if we were intent
        on utilizing it.

856
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:31,640
         What are you?

857
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:44,286
  How do you choose your host?

858
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:58,600
- Now.

859
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:11,079
       Tell me your name.

860
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:29,331
     They were getting very
           frustrated
  because everything she said

861
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:31,132
    sounded like gibberish.

862
01:04:31,134 --> 01:04:32,834
    They kept shocking her.

863
01:04:32,836 --> 01:04:35,437
 When she didn't give them the
             answer
 they wanted, they'd shock her
             again.

864
01:04:35,439 --> 01:04:37,772
     They'd up the voltage
      and shock her again.

865
01:04:37,774 --> 01:04:41,509
Our analysts
were eventually able to isolate

866
01:04:41,511 --> 01:04:45,513
        certain elements
      of Judith's speech.

867
01:04:45,515 --> 01:04:49,184
   Turned out she hadn't been
   speaking gibberish at all.

868
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:07,202
         What are you?

869
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:14,476
  How do you choose your host?

870
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,417
  This will all be over soon.

871
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:32,594
      It just proved that
 she was in control the entire
             time.

872
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:34,596
      Just drawing us in.

873
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:36,698
     Drawing us in closer.

874
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,868
    And instead of stopping
  like we all knew we should,

875
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:42,704
         we kept going.

876
01:05:42,706 --> 01:05:44,372
       We were too close

877
01:05:44,374 --> 01:05:47,175
          to something
  truly revolutionary to stop.

878
01:05:47,177 --> 01:05:49,077
   It was affecting everyone,

879
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:51,880
     but that's the nature
  of any struggle, any battle.

880
01:05:51,882 --> 01:05:55,116
 Push and you will be resisted.

881
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:58,787
   That's why you want to be
  the one pushing the hardest.

882
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:01,589
 You would hear them discussing
   new ideas and strategies,

883
01:06:01,591 --> 01:06:02,924
     disruption techniques,

884
01:06:02,926 --> 01:06:05,827
     but nobody would talk
    about what was obvious.

885
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:07,996
 That there are certain things
         in this world

886
01:06:07,998 --> 01:06:10,165
 that we will never understand.

887
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:12,767
      And Judith Winstead
        was one of them.

888
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:21,076
     It was acutely averse

889
01:06:21,078 --> 01:06:24,079
         to all things
      related to religion.

890
01:06:24,081 --> 01:06:27,048
     Even more than it was
        to electroshock.

891
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,455
    And that poor priest...

892
01:06:33,457 --> 01:06:36,825
      he was just a pawn.

893
01:06:36,827 --> 01:06:39,594
We were very much against
     involving the Church.

894
01:06:39,596 --> 01:06:42,030
  We didn't want to turn this
        into a sideshow.

895
01:06:42,032 --> 01:06:44,232
       At the same time,

896
01:06:44,234 --> 01:06:46,434
         we had to gain
        control somehow.

897
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:50,705
         This one, too.

898
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:00,682
         Uh, thumbprint
      on that one as well.

899
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:16,031
- Do you understand everything?
          - I do, yes.

900
01:07:16,033 --> 01:07:17,866
    Into the camera, please.

901
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,369
         I understand.

902
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:23,204
             Okay.

903
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:41,790
   Do you have any questions?

904
01:07:41,792 --> 01:07:43,858
              No.

905
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,364
             Good.

906
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:56,304
   That last night in the lab
             was...

907
01:07:56,306 --> 01:07:58,606
         it was crazy.

908
01:07:58,608 --> 01:08:02,210
   They told us to double up
 on our ammo just to stay safe.

909
01:08:02,212 --> 01:08:04,012
    There was a big buildup.

910
01:08:04,014 --> 01:08:06,948
Everyone was mentally preparing
     for what might happen.

911
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:11,319
      We needed to get it
         out of the lab

912
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:13,188
    and we couldn't do that
        with a civilian.

913
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:16,024
     We had to transfer it
      into one of our own.

914
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:21,729
         When I arrived
     at the lab that night

915
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:24,132
         and found out
  what was going to happen...

916
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:28,169
            I froze.

917
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:33,741
       I wanted to scream
   for them not to try that.

918
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:37,912
    But I didn't say a word.

919
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:40,448
  I wanted to get out of there
           real bad.

920
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:43,351
      I remember, I wanted
   to sneak out the back door

921
01:08:43,353 --> 01:08:46,387
    when nobody was looking
          and just go.

922
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,827
   And of course I couldn't.

923
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:57,465
          I should've.

924
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,438
Go ahead.

925
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,774
           Copy that.
      Get ready, Corporal.

926
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:58,219
Hey, hey, hey.

927
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:18,840
Stop the transfer.

928
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:25,747
The power of the blood of Jesus
         commands you!

929
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:28,850
        Bow to the Lord!

930
01:11:28,852 --> 01:11:30,385
Get him out of there.

931
01:11:30,387 --> 01:11:32,987
- Hit the gas. Hit the gas.
- Help! Help!

932
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:57,578
         Pull him out!

933
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:59,881
Pull him out.
      Make sure he's okay.

934
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,384
         Are you okay?

935
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:07,689
     - I'm gonna clear it.
   - No. No, no, no. Hold on.

936
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:15,129
Did it work? Did it work?

937
01:12:15,131 --> 01:12:16,964
       I-- I don't know.

938
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:21,569
    Give her a quick charge.

939
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:26,407
She's still out.

940
01:12:26,409 --> 01:12:29,077
     No, no. The electrodes
     got disconnected. See?

941
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,384
             Shit.

942
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:49,864
    - Are you positive she's
          unconscious?
             - No.

943
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,933
    - Can we gas her again?
    - It might be too much.

944
01:12:51,935 --> 01:12:53,901
  Well, I'm not going in there
unless I know she's completely--

945
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:56,771
  - We've got nothing if it's
             dead.
     - If we don't get the
          electrodes--

946
01:12:56,773 --> 01:12:58,106
        - Are you crazy?
  - We've got nothing if it's
             dead.

947
01:12:58,108 --> 01:12:59,607
        - Hit her again!
     - Robert, don't do it.

948
01:12:59,609 --> 01:13:00,675
 - I'm not gonna hit her again.
             - Now!

949
01:13:00,677 --> 01:13:02,377
        - Hit her again!
           - Don't--

950
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:06,948
         Robert, don't.

951
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:35,570
Bilateral?

952
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:38,806
Uh, bi-frontal.

953
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:44,639
What are you doing? What are you
             doing?
     You need to step back.

954
01:15:44,641 --> 01:15:46,173
      I'm gonna check him.
   I'm gonna check his pulse.

955
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:47,341
          - That's it?
         - That's all.

956
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:58,219
  Let's start clearing again--

957
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,604
      Get him outta here.
  Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

958
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:23,010
  The situation was a disaster
     in all possible ways.

959
01:16:23,012 --> 01:16:25,846
     Local law enforcement
         got involved,

960
01:16:25,848 --> 01:16:27,214
           the media.

961
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:29,317
    They all wanted to know
   what happened, naturally.

962
01:16:29,319 --> 01:16:31,419
 They had a right to the story.

963
01:16:31,421 --> 01:16:34,088
     Just not to all of it.

964
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:37,592
  I'm still not at liberty to
            discuss
     much more than I have.

965
01:16:37,594 --> 01:16:41,529
Especially as it pertains to the
             events
   that took place after that
             night.

966
01:16:41,531 --> 01:16:44,265
   But I can tell you this--

967
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:45,967
  the measures taken were done

968
01:16:45,969 --> 01:16:48,402
    with the best interests
    of this country in mind.

969
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:54,542
It wasn't until fairly recently

970
01:16:54,544 --> 01:16:59,046
        that I found out
  what happened to my sister.

971
01:16:59,048 --> 01:17:03,050
        And as horrible
     as it probably sounds,

972
01:17:03,052 --> 01:17:05,019
    I preferred it that way.

973
01:17:05,021 --> 01:17:06,988
     She was a good person.

974
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:08,756
            She was.

975
01:17:08,758 --> 01:17:10,858
       But people change.

976
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:14,061
       Even good people.

977
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:19,433
 I know that the official story
     was that he was crazy.

978
01:17:19,435 --> 01:17:21,636
     He was a mad scientist

979
01:17:21,638 --> 01:17:26,140
 who had finally lost the last
of his widely scattered marbles.

980
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:30,611
But believe me when I tell you,

981
01:17:30,613 --> 01:17:33,848
   Henry West was not crazy.

982
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:38,819
       Which I suppose...

983
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:43,624
         leaves us with
   the alternate explanation.

984
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:59,940
What is this?

985
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:34,208
Please, help.
