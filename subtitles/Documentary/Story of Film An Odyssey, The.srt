1
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,456
Here you are, sir.
Main level, please.

2
00:24:42,456 --> 00:24:43,918
Right. See you on the way back.

3
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,814
- Bye.
- Bye.

4
00:24:46,491 --> 00:24:48,379
Good morning, sir.
Morning.

5
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:51,475
- We haven't seen you for a long time.
- Nice to see you again.

6
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:54,010
- Did you have a pleasant flight?
- Very nice.

7
00:24:54,236 --> 00:24:57,205
Mr. Miller of Station Security
is supposed to meet me.

8
00:24:57,407 --> 00:24:59,796
- May I call him for you?
- Would you? Here he is.

9
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,308
- Hello, Dr. Floyd.
- Hello, Miller.

10
00:25:01,504 --> 00:25:03,392
Sorry I'm late.
That's all right.

11
00:25:03,584 --> 00:25:05,472
It's nice to have you back.

12
00:25:05,664 --> 00:25:07,804
- Did you have a good flight?
- Very nice.

13
00:25:08,033 --> 00:25:10,685
- Shall we go through?
- Would you please use number 17?

14
00:25:10,915 --> 00:25:13,533
Thank you, Ms. Turner. This way.
Thank you.

15
00:25:18,853 --> 00:25:21,243
<i>Welcome to Voiceprint Identification.</i>

16
00:25:21,511 --> 00:25:25,440
<i>When you see the red light go on,
please state in the following order:</i>

<i>Surname first, Christian name,

19
00:25:34,123 --> 00:25:38,280
Moon. American. Floyd, Heywood R.

20
00:25:40,684 --> 00:25:44,068
<i>Thank you. You are cleared through
Voiceprint Identification.</i>

21
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:46,025
Thank you.

22
00:25:52,689 --> 00:25:55,723
Have I got time for breakfast?
I think we can manage that.

23
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:56,938
How long have I got?

24
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,561
Your flight leaves
in an hour and 10 minutes.

25
00:25:59,732 --> 00:26:03,028
I've reserved a table for you
in the Earthlight Room.

26
00:26:03,253 --> 00:26:06,352
It's been seven or eight months
since you were here, hasn't it?

27
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,557
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.

28
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:11,247
I suppose you saw the work
on the new section?

29
00:26:11,415 --> 00:26:13,837
Coming along great, huh?
Yeah, it's fine.

30
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:14,990
Oh, wait.

31
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,674
I've got to make a couple calls.
I'll meet you in the restaurant.

32
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:48,282
<i>- Dad?
- Hello.</i>

33
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:52,771
Hi, squirt.
What are you doing?

34
00:26:54,277 --> 00:26:55,259
<i>Playing.</i>

35
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,806
Where's Mummy?

36
00:26:57,063 --> 00:26:58,470
<i>Gone to shopping.</i>

37
00:26:58,696 --> 00:27:01,063
<i>- Who's taking care of you?
- Rachel.</i>

38
00:27:01,256 --> 00:27:04,552
<i>- May I speak to Rachel, please?
- She's gone to the bathroom.</i>

39
00:27:04,778 --> 00:27:07,364
<i>Are you coming
to my party tomorrow?</i>

40
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,929
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.

41
00:27:10,347 --> 00:27:11,460
<i>Why not?</i>

42
00:27:11,628 --> 00:27:14,084
Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.

43
00:27:14,637 --> 00:27:16,874
Very sorry about it, but I just can't.

44
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:20,870
I'm going to send you
a very nice present, though.

45
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,302
<i>All right.</i>

46
00:27:23,472 --> 00:27:25,545
<i>- Anything special that you want?
- Yes.</i>

47
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:26,792
What?

48
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:28,496
<i>A telephone.</i>

49
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:31,115
We've got lots of telephones already.

50
00:27:31,314 --> 00:27:35,473
Can't you think of anything else
for your birthday? Something special?

51
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,075
<i>- Yes.
- What?</i>

52
00:27:37,492 --> 00:27:38,474
<i>A bush baby.</i>

53
00:27:38,645 --> 00:27:41,067
A bush baby?
We'll have to see about that.

54
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:44,884
I want you to tell Mummy
something for me. Will you remember?

55
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:47,927
Tell Mummy that I telephoned. Okay?

56
00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:52,183
And that I'll try
to telephone again tomorrow.

57
00:27:52,442 --> 00:27:54,297
Now, will you tell her that?

58
00:27:55,002 --> 00:27:55,984
<i>Yes.</i>

59
00:27:56,155 --> 00:27:58,905
Okay, sweetheart.
Have a nice birthday tomorrow.

60
00:27:59,164 --> 00:28:00,147
<i>All right.</i>

61
00:28:00,317 --> 00:28:03,285
And have a nice birthday party
tomorrow too, huh?

62
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:05,044
<i>All right.</i>

63
00:28:05,214 --> 00:28:07,735
Take care and be a good girl,
won't you?

64
00:28:07,966 --> 00:28:09,112
<i>All right. Bye-bye.</i>

65
00:28:09,376 --> 00:28:11,678
Bye-bye. Happy birthday.

66
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,058
Elena, nice to see you again.
Heywood, what a surprise.

67
00:28:29,222 --> 00:28:32,093
You're looking wonderful.
You're looking well too.

68
00:28:32,264 --> 00:28:34,206
This is my friend,
Dr. Heywood Floyd.

69
00:28:34,376 --> 00:28:36,766
I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.
How do you do?

70
00:28:36,937 --> 00:28:38,726
Dr. Stretyneva.
How do you do?

71
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,613
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.

72
00:28:40,777 --> 00:28:43,080
How do you do?
I've heard a lot about you.

73
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:44,769
Do sit down.

74
00:28:45,132 --> 00:28:47,042
Well, we...
No, no, please.

75
00:28:47,469 --> 00:28:48,843
Thank you.

76
00:28:49,037 --> 00:28:51,940
Would you like a drink?
No, thank you.

77
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:55,307
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.

78
00:28:55,503 --> 00:28:57,871
I'll just sit with you a moment.
Then I'll be off.

79
00:28:58,064 --> 00:29:00,552
Are you quite sure?
Quite sure, thank you.

80
00:29:01,713 --> 00:29:03,819
- Well, how's Gregor?
- He's fine.

81
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,215
He's been doing underwater research
in the Baltic...

82
00:29:07,475 --> 00:29:11,339
...so I'm afraid we don't see
very much of each other these days.

83
00:29:11,604 --> 00:29:15,020
- When you see him, give him my regards.
- Yes, of course.

84
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,102
Well, where are you all off to?
Up or down?

85
00:29:18,326 --> 00:29:19,308
We're going home.

86
00:29:19,511 --> 00:29:24,182
We've spent three months calibrating
the new antenna at Tchalinko.

87
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:26,994
- What about you?
- I'm on my way to Clavius.

88
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:28,470
Oh, are you?

89
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:34,200
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think
I'm being too inquisitive...

90
00:29:34,396 --> 00:29:39,318
...but perhaps you can clear up the big
mystery about what is going on there.

91
00:29:40,062 --> 00:29:42,102
I'm afraid I don't know
what you mean.

92
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:43,994
For the past two weeks...

93
00:29:44,192 --> 00:29:47,488
...some extremely odd things
have been happening at Clavius.

94
00:29:47,713 --> 00:29:49,721
- Oh, really?
- Yes, yes.

95
00:29:50,017 --> 00:29:54,109
For one thing, when you phone the base,
all you get is a recording...

96
00:29:54,339 --> 00:29:58,302
...which repeats that the phone lines
are temporarily out of order.

97
00:29:59,813 --> 00:30:02,148
Probably having some trouble
with their equipment.

98
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:03,422
Yes.

99
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:08,327
That's what we thought at first,
but it's been going on now for 10 days.

100
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:11,204
You haven't been able to
contact anyone for 10 days?

101
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:12,710
That's right.

102
00:30:13,002 --> 00:30:13,984
Oh, I see.

103
00:30:14,154 --> 00:30:17,668
There's another thing.
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses...

104
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,683
...was denied permission
for an emergency landing.

105
00:30:20,877 --> 00:30:21,891
That does sound odd.

106
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:25,127
I'm afraid there's going to be
a bit of a row about it.

107
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:29,100
Denying the men permission to land
violates the IAS Convention.

108
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:32,013
Yes, of course.
Did the crew get back all right?

109
00:30:32,209 --> 00:30:35,526
- Fortunately, they did.
- Well, I'm glad about that.

110
00:30:38,994 --> 00:30:42,769
At the risk of pressing you on
a point you seem reticent to discuss...

111
00:30:43,027 --> 00:30:45,484
...may I ask you
a straightforward question?

112
00:30:45,716 --> 00:30:47,091
Well, certainly.

113
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,908
Frankly, we have had some
very reliable intelligence reports that...

114
00:30:54,135 --> 00:30:57,366
...quite a serious epidemic
has broken out at Clavius.

115
00:30:57,625 --> 00:31:01,455
Something, apparently,
of an unknown origin.

116
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:03,992
Is this, in fact, what has happened?

117
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,028
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...

118
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:14,935
...I'm really not at liberty
to discuss this.

119
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:17,623
I understand.

120
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,107
But this epidemic
could easily spread to our base.

121
00:31:22,305 --> 00:31:24,312
We should be given all the facts.

122
00:31:24,514 --> 00:31:26,270
Yes, I know.

123
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:32,059
As I said,
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

124
00:31:34,757 --> 00:31:37,441
Won't you change your mind
about that drink?

125
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:39,875
No, I'm positive.
I really must be going.

126
00:31:40,102 --> 00:31:43,039
I hope you and your wife come
to the IAC Conference.

127
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,517
I hope we can make it.

128
00:31:44,713 --> 00:31:47,648
If you do, bring that darling
little daughter with you.

129
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:51,593
That'll depend on school vacations
and all that sort of thing.

130
00:31:51,851 --> 00:31:52,833
If we can, we will.

131
00:31:53,035 --> 00:31:55,851
You've got an invitation
if you ever get to the States.

132
00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:58,696
Gregor and I will look forward
to seeing you.

133
00:31:59,598 --> 00:32:00,613
Goodbye, Elena.

134
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:03,757
It's been a pleasure meeting you all.
Dr. Smyslov.

135
00:32:03,983 --> 00:32:07,760
Whatever the reasons for your visit,
the very best of luck to you.

136
00:32:07,952 --> 00:32:08,967
Thank you.

137
00:32:09,201 --> 00:32:10,347
Ladies.

138
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:48,040
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.

139
00:39:48,204 --> 00:39:50,409
I'm through now.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

140
00:39:50,573 --> 00:39:51,882
You're welcome.

141
00:40:04,017 --> 00:40:05,131
Well...

142
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:08,271
...I know you will all
want to join with me...

143
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:12,242
...in welcoming our distinguished
friend and colleague...

144
00:40:12,437 --> 00:40:16,498
...from the National Council
of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

145
00:40:16,727 --> 00:40:21,649
Dr. Floyd has come up specially
to Clavius to be with us today.

146
00:40:22,905 --> 00:40:26,102
Before the briefing, he'd like
to have a few words with you.

147
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,313
Dr. Floyd?

148
00:40:39,742 --> 00:40:41,631
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.

149
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,573
Hi, everybody.
Nice to be back with you.

150
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:51,193
First, I bring a personal message
from Dr. Howell...

151
00:40:51,425 --> 00:40:54,110
...who has asked me to convey
his deep appreciation...

152
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:57,308
...for the many sacrifices
you've had to make.

153
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,218
And, of course, his congratulations
on your discovery...

154
00:41:01,766 --> 00:41:06,175
...which may prove to be among the most
significant in the history of science.

155
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,375
Now...

156
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:13,993
...I know there have been some
conflicting views...

157
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:17,699
...regarding the need for
complete security in this matter.

158
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,479
More specifically, your opposition
to the cover story...

159
00:41:21,868 --> 00:41:25,284
...created to give the impression
of an epidemic at the base.

160
00:41:26,286 --> 00:41:30,085
I understand that beyond it being
a matter of principle...

161
00:41:30,672 --> 00:41:33,989
...many of you are troubled
by the concern and anxiety...

162
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:39,115
...this story of an epidemic might cause
to your relatives and friends on Earth.

163
00:41:40,244 --> 00:41:42,928
I completely sympathize
with your negative views.

164
00:41:44,148 --> 00:41:47,662
I find this cover story
personally embarrassing, myself.

165
00:41:48,437 --> 00:41:52,563
However, I accept the need
for absolute secrecy in this.

166
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:55,062
And I hope you will too.

167
00:41:57,561 --> 00:42:00,278
I'm sure you're all aware
of the grave potential...

168
00:42:00,473 --> 00:42:03,027
...for cultural shock
and social disorientation...

169
00:42:03,258 --> 00:42:05,529
...contained in this situation...

170
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:08,113
...if the facts were
prematurely made public...

171
00:42:08,316 --> 00:42:11,284
...without adequate preparation
and conditioning.

172
00:42:11,997 --> 00:42:13,307
Anyway...

173
00:42:13,502 --> 00:42:15,608
...this is the view of the Council.

174
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:20,442
The purpose of my visit is to gather
additional facts and opinions...

175
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,299
...on the situation...

176
00:42:22,721 --> 00:42:25,537
...and to prepare a report
to the Council...

177
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:30,651
...recommending when and how
the news should eventually be announced.

178
00:42:31,845 --> 00:42:35,490
If any of you would like to give me
your views and opinions...

179
00:42:35,749 --> 00:42:40,486
...in private, if you like, I will be
happy to include them in my report.

180
00:42:42,376 --> 00:42:44,286
Well, I think that's about it.

181
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:46,494
Any questions?

182
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:51,972
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea
how much longer...

183
00:42:52,204 --> 00:42:54,855
...this cover story will
have to be maintained?

184
00:42:56,653 --> 00:42:58,180
I don't know, Bill.

185
00:42:58,574 --> 00:43:02,371
I suppose for as long as
deemed necessary by the Council.

186
00:43:02,575 --> 00:43:05,227
There must be adequate time for
a full study...

187
00:43:05,456 --> 00:43:08,938
...before any thought can be given
to making a public announcement.

188
00:43:09,137 --> 00:43:11,953
As some of you know,
the Council has requested...

189
00:43:12,146 --> 00:43:14,764
...that security oaths
be obtained in writing...

190
00:43:14,963 --> 00:43:17,714
...from everyone who has
knowledge of this event.

191
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,488
Were there any more questions?

192
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:30,264
I'm sure
we want to cooperate with Dr. Floyd...

193
00:43:30,425 --> 00:43:31,854
...as fully as possible...

194
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:37,331
...and as there are no more questions,
we ought to get on with the briefing.

195
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:40,081
Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
Thank you.

196
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:14,871
Anybody hungry?

197
00:45:17,436 --> 00:45:19,706
What've we got?
You name it.

198
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,626
Is this chicken?
Something like that.

199
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:27,548
Tastes the same, anyway.

200
00:45:28,193 --> 00:45:29,404
Got any ham?

201
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,009
Ham, ham, ham...

202
00:45:31,201 --> 00:45:32,762
There, that's it.

203
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:36,890
Look pretty good.

204
00:45:37,091 --> 00:45:39,711
They're getting better at it
all the time.

205
00:45:41,701 --> 00:45:43,490
That was an excellent speech.

206
00:45:43,654 --> 00:45:44,832
It certainly was.

207
00:45:45,638 --> 00:45:47,645
I'm sure it beefed up morale a lot.

208
00:45:47,847 --> 00:45:49,091
Thanks, Ralph.

209
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:51,809
By the way,
you've both done a wonderful job.

210
00:45:52,008 --> 00:45:53,503
I admire how
you've handled this.

211
00:45:53,737 --> 00:45:57,120
It's our job to do this thing
the way you want it done.

212
00:45:57,322 --> 00:45:59,843
We're only too happy to
be able to oblige.

213
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:02,053
Have you seen these yet?

214
00:46:02,348 --> 00:46:05,513
Have a look.
Here's what started it all.

215
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:07,369
Oh, yeah.

216
00:46:07,694 --> 00:46:09,101
When we found it...

217
00:46:09,262 --> 00:46:11,172
...we thought
it might be magnetic rock...

218
00:46:11,374 --> 00:46:14,375
...but all the geological evidence
was against it.

219
00:46:14,607 --> 00:46:19,050
And not even a nickel-iron meteorite
could produce a field this intense.

220
00:46:19,249 --> 00:46:20,875
So we decided to have a look.

221
00:46:21,106 --> 00:46:23,529
We thought it was
part of a buried structure...

222
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:27,246
...so we excavated out,
but we didn't find anything else.

223
00:46:27,445 --> 00:46:30,315
And the evidence seems
pretty conclusive that...

224
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:33,550
...it hasn't been covered
by erosion or other forces.

225
00:46:33,751 --> 00:46:35,988
It's been deliberately buried.

226
00:46:36,951 --> 00:46:38,775
Deliberately buried.

227
00:46:42,201 --> 00:46:43,860
How about a little coffee?

228
00:46:44,058 --> 00:46:45,914
Great.
Good idea.

229
00:46:51,197 --> 00:46:54,012
I don't suppose you have any idea
what the damn thing is?

230
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,125
I wish to hell we did.

231
00:46:56,478 --> 00:47:00,505
The only thing we're sure of is
it was buried 4 million years ago.

232
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:05,143
Well, I must say, you guys have
certainly come up with something.

233
00:47:05,345 --> 00:47:06,938
Watch this, now. It's hot.

234
00:56:27,744 --> 00:56:28,857
<i>Good evening.</i>

235
00:56:29,025 --> 00:56:31,895
<i>Three weeks ago,
the American spacecraft Discovery One...</i>

236
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,716
<i>...left on its half-billion-mile voyage
to Jupiter.</i>

237
00:56:35,074 --> 00:56:38,688
<i>This marked the first manned attempt
to reach this distant planet.</i>

238
00:56:38,949 --> 00:56:42,266
<i>This afternoon, The World Tonight
recorded an interview...</i>

239
00:56:42,469 --> 00:56:46,845
<i>...with the crew at a distance
of 80 million miles from Earth.</i>

240
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:50,212
<i>It took seven minutes for our words
to reach the giant spacecraft...</i>

241
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,441
<i>...but this time delay has been edited
from this recording.</i>

242
00:56:53,641 --> 00:56:56,806
<i>Our reporter Martin Amer
speaks to the crew.</i>

243
00:56:57,002 --> 00:57:00,038
<i>The crew of Discovery One
consists of five men...</i>

244
00:57:00,236 --> 00:57:04,994
<i>...and one of the latest generation
of the HAL 9000 computers.</i>

245
00:57:05,229 --> 00:57:07,434
<i>Three of the men
were put aboard asleep...</i>

246
00:57:07,629 --> 00:57:10,664
<i>...or to be more precise,
in a state of hibernation.</i>

247
00:57:10,862 --> 00:57:13,679
<i>They were Dr. Charles Hunter,
Dr. Jack Kimbal...</i>

248
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,663
<i>...and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.</i>

249
00:57:16,081 --> 00:57:18,667
<i>We spoke with mission commander,
Dr. David Bowman...</i>

250
00:57:18,897 --> 00:57:21,069
<i>...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.</i>

251
00:57:21,298 --> 00:57:24,050
<i>Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How is everything going?</i>

252
00:57:24,244 --> 00:57:25,390
<i>Marvelous.</i>

253
00:57:26,997 --> 00:57:28,590
<i>We have no complaints.</i>

254
00:57:28,853 --> 00:57:31,952
<i>I'm glad to hear that.
I'm sure the entire world...</i>

255
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:35,282
<i>...joins me in wishing you
a safe, successful voyage.</i>

256
00:57:35,447 --> 00:57:37,237
<i>Thanks very much.
Thank you.</i>

257
00:57:37,656 --> 00:57:41,454
<i>Although hibernation has been used
on previous space efforts...</i>

258
00:57:41,657 --> 00:57:46,001
<i>...this is the first time men were
put into hibernation before departure.</i>

259
00:57:46,202 --> 00:57:47,448
<i>Why was this done?</i>

260
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:50,807
<i>This was done to achieve
the maximum conservation...</i>

261
00:57:51,005 --> 00:57:54,421
<i>...of our life-support capabilities,
basically food and air.</i>

262
00:57:54,622 --> 00:57:58,071
<i>The three hibernating crew members
represent the survey team.</i>

263
00:57:58,335 --> 00:58:01,915
<i>Their efforts won't be utilized
until we approach Jupiter.</i>

264
00:58:02,208 --> 00:58:05,886
<i>Dr. Poole, what's it like
while you're in hibernation?</i>

265
00:58:06,818 --> 00:58:10,299
<i>It's exactly like being asleep.
You have no sense of time.</i>

266
00:58:10,498 --> 00:58:12,867
<i>The only difference is
that you don't dream.</i>

267
00:58:13,061 --> 00:58:16,990
<i>As I understand it, you only
breathe once a minute. Is this true?</i>

268
00:58:17,189 --> 00:58:19,678
<i>Right, and the heart
beats three times a minute.</i>

269
00:58:19,878 --> 00:58:23,426
<i>Body temperature is usually down to
about three degrees centigrade.</i>

270
00:58:23,912 --> 00:58:27,110
<i>The sixth member of the crew
was not concerned...</i>

271
00:58:27,305 --> 00:58:29,280
<i>...about the problems of hibernation...</i>

272
00:58:29,513 --> 00:58:32,831
<i>...for he was the latest result
in machine intelligence:</i>

273
00:58:33,035 --> 00:58:37,260
<i>The HAL 9000 computer,
which can reproduce...</i>

274
00:58:37,517 --> 00:58:40,300
<i>...though some experts prefer
to use the word "mimic"...</i>

275
00:58:40,525 --> 00:58:42,795
<i>...most of the activities
of the human brain...</i>

276
00:58:42,991 --> 00:58:46,854
<i>...and with incalculably greater
speed and reliability.</i>

277
00:58:47,055 --> 00:58:50,505
<i>We next spoke with
the HAL 9000 computer...</i>

278
00:58:50,705 --> 00:58:53,553
<i>...whom, we learned,
one addresses as "Hal."</i>

279
00:58:54,258 --> 00:58:56,299
<i>Hello, Hal.
How's everything going?</i>

280
00:58:56,658 --> 00:59:00,337
<i>Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.
Everything is going extremely well.</i>

281
00:59:00,596 --> 00:59:03,859
<i>Hal, you have an enormous
responsibility on this mission...</i>

282
00:59:04,118 --> 00:59:07,828
<i>...perhaps the greatest
of any single mission element.</i>

283
00:59:08,022 --> 00:59:10,706
<i>You're the brain
and nervous system of the ship.</i>

284
00:59:10,903 --> 00:59:14,517
<i>Your responsibilities include
watching over the men in hibernation.</i>

285
00:59:14,713 --> 00:59:17,681
<i>Does this ever cause you
any lack of confidence?</i>

286
00:59:17,882 --> 00:59:20,086
<i>Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.</i>

287
00:59:20,379 --> 00:59:24,821
<i>The 9000 Series is
the most reliable computer ever made.</i>

288
00:59:25,213 --> 00:59:29,786
<i>No 9000 computer has ever made
a mistake or distorted information.</i>

289
00:59:30,462 --> 00:59:33,561
<i>We are all, by any practical
definition of the words...</i>

290
00:59:33,823 --> 00:59:37,054
<i>...foolproof and incapable of error.</i>

291
00:59:37,281 --> 00:59:40,926
<i>Hal, despite your enormous
intellect, are you ever frustrated...</i>

292
00:59:41,122 --> 00:59:44,090
<i>...by your dependence on people
to carry out actions?</i>

293
00:59:44,323 --> 00:59:46,428
<i>Not in the slightest bit.</i>

294
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,701
<i>I enjoy working with people.</i>

295
00:59:48,933 --> 00:59:53,277
<i>I have a stimulating relationship
with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.</i>

296
00:59:53,447 --> 00:59:57,571
<i>My mission responsibilities range
over the entire operation of the ship...</i>

297
00:59:57,959 --> 01:00:00,808
<i>...so I am constantly occupied.</i>

298
01:00:01,065 --> 01:00:04,361
<i>I am putting myself
to the fullest possible use...</i>

299
01:00:04,586 --> 01:00:09,126
<i>...which is all, I think, that any
conscious entity can ever hope to do.</i>

300
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:12,807
<i>Dr. Poole, what's it like
living for most of the year...</i>

301
01:00:13,069 --> 01:00:15,786
<i>...in such close proximity with Hal?</i>

302
01:00:16,751 --> 01:00:18,606
<i>It's like what you said earlier.</i>

303
01:00:18,863 --> 01:00:20,903
<i>He's like a sixth
member of the crew.</i>

304
01:00:21,135 --> 01:00:25,000
<i>You quickly get adjusted to the idea
that he talks, and think of him...</i>

305
01:00:25,265 --> 01:00:27,175
<i>...really just as another person.</i>

306
01:00:27,378 --> 01:00:30,924
<i>In talking to the computer,
one gets the sense that he's capable...</i>

307
01:00:31,091 --> 01:00:32,433
<i>...of emotional responses.</i>

308
01:00:32,659 --> 01:00:34,897
<i>When I asked him
about his abilities...</i>

309
01:00:35,093 --> 01:00:38,891
<i>...I sensed pride in his answer
about his accuracy and perfection.</i>

310
01:00:39,158 --> 01:00:42,388
<i>Do you believe that Hal
has genuine emotions?</i>

311
01:00:43,063 --> 01:00:45,911
<i>Well, he acts like
he has genuine emotions.</i>

312
01:00:46,136 --> 01:00:49,585
<i>He's programmed that way
to make it easier for us to talk to him.</i>

313
01:00:49,817 --> 01:00:51,792
<i>As to whether or not
he has feelings...</i>

314
01:00:51,994 --> 01:00:54,712
<i>...is something I don't think
anyone can truthfully answer.</i>

315
01:01:19,011 --> 01:01:20,800
<i>Excuse me, Frank.</i>

316
01:01:21,155 --> 01:01:22,203
What is it, Hal?

317
01:01:22,372 --> 01:01:25,221
<i>We've got the transmission
from your parents coming in.</i>

318
01:01:26,374 --> 01:01:27,389
Fine.

319
01:01:28,038 --> 01:01:30,210
Put it on here, please.
Take me in a bit.

320
01:01:30,439 --> 01:01:31,650
<i>Certainly.</i>

321
01:01:44,299 --> 01:01:46,154
<i>Hello, Frank.
Happy birthday, darling.</i>

322
01:01:46,349 --> 01:01:48,204
<i>Happy birthday.
Many happy returns.</i>

323
01:01:48,397 --> 01:01:49,510
A bit higher, Hal.

324
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:52,012
<i>Mother and I are both
feeling wonderful.</i>

325
01:01:52,238 --> 01:01:54,027
<i>Ray and Sally were going
to be here...</i>

326
01:01:54,255 --> 01:01:56,427
<i>...but Ray's back
went bad on him again.</i>

327
01:01:56,656 --> 01:01:58,697
<i>How do you like your cake?</i>

328
01:01:58,898 --> 01:02:00,272
<i>Sorry you can't join us.</i>

329
01:02:00,498 --> 01:02:01,992
<i>I ran into Bob the other day.</i>

330
01:02:02,258 --> 01:02:04,201
<i>He said to wish you happy birthday.</i>

331
01:02:04,403 --> 01:02:07,022
<i>All my students
send their best wishes too.</i>

332
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:08,846
<i>They talk about you all the time.</i>

333
01:02:09,108 --> 01:02:12,045
<i>You're a big celebrity
in the second grade.</i>

334
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:13,652
<i>We were on TV last week.</i>

335
01:02:13,911 --> 01:02:16,399
<i>Your mom and I
and Dave's parents were asked...</i>

336
01:02:16,663 --> 01:02:18,802
<i>...what we thought
of our illustrious son.</i>

337
01:02:19,064 --> 01:02:22,262
<i>Imagine what we told them.
It's being broadcast next Thursday.</i>

338
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:24,017
<i>Perhaps you can listen in.</i>

339
01:02:24,186 --> 01:02:26,095
<i>We're thrilled about Elaine and Bill.</i>

340
01:02:26,266 --> 01:02:29,813
<i>I'll be glad to get the gift,
but tell me how much to spend.</i>

341
01:02:30,043 --> 01:02:32,727
<i>Oh, Frank,
about your AGS-19 payments...</i>

342
01:02:32,988 --> 01:02:34,550
<i>...I think I straightened it out.</i>

343
01:02:34,718 --> 01:02:36,791
<i>I talked to
the accounting office yesterday...</i>

344
01:02:36,958 --> 01:02:41,335
<i>...and they said you'd be receiving
your higher rates of pay by next month.</i>

345
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,607
<i>I can't think of anything else to say.</i>

346
01:02:43,872 --> 01:02:47,835
<i>Give our love to Dave.
Be sure to give him our regards.</i>

347
01:02:48,066 --> 01:02:51,263
<i>We wish you the very
happiest of birthdays.</i>

348
01:02:51,522 --> 01:02:53,017
<i>All the best, son.</i>

349
01:02:53,284 --> 01:02:55,357
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

350
01:02:55,588 --> 01:02:57,596
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

351
01:02:57,796 --> 01:03:00,286
<i>Happy birthday, dear Frank</i>

352
01:03:00,486 --> 01:03:02,974
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

353
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:06,622
<i>See you next Wednesday.</i>

354
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,431
<i>Happy birthday, Frank.</i>

355
01:03:12,234 --> 01:03:15,650
Thank you, Hal.
A bit flatter, please.

356
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,856
Anyway, queen takes pawn.

357
01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:38,833
<i>Bishop takes knight's pawn.</i>

358
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:41,682
Lousy move.

359
01:03:45,942 --> 01:03:47,437
Rook to king one.

360
01:03:47,702 --> 01:03:50,453
<i>I'm sorry, Frank.
I think you missed it.</i>

361
01:03:51,095 --> 01:03:54,445
<i>Queen to bishop three.
Bishop takes queen.</i>

362
01:03:54,648 --> 01:03:57,037
<i>Knight takes bishop. Mate.</i>

363
01:04:01,147 --> 01:04:04,181
Looks like you're right. I resign.

364
01:04:04,348 --> 01:04:06,258
<i>Thank you for a very enjoyable game.</i>

365
01:04:06,428 --> 01:04:07,410
Thank you.

366
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,856
<i>Good evening, Dave.
How are you, Hal?</i>

367
01:04:46,026 --> 01:04:49,322
<i>- Everything's running smoothly, you?
Not too bad.</i>

368
01:04:49,515 --> 01:04:52,069
<i>- Have you been doing more work?
- A few sketches.</i>

369
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:54,667
<i>- May I see them?
- Sure.</i>

370
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:00,878
<i>That's a very nice rendering, Dave.</i>

371
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:04,068
<i>I think you've improved a great deal.</i>

372
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:08,071
<i>- Can you hold it a bit closer?
- Sure.</i>

373
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:12,073
<i>That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?</i>

374
01:05:15,156 --> 01:05:16,683
<i>By the way...</i>

375
01:05:17,364 --> 01:05:20,267
<i>...do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?</i>

376
01:05:20,757 --> 01:05:22,319
No, not at all.

377
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:24,940
<i>Well, forgive me
for being so inquisitive...</i>

378
01:05:26,936 --> 01:05:28,911
<i>...but lately I've wondered...</i>

379
01:05:29,176 --> 01:05:32,886
<i>...whether you might be having
second thoughts about the mission?</i>

380
01:05:33,081 --> 01:05:34,676
How do you mean?

381
01:05:34,938 --> 01:05:38,682
<i>Well, it's rather difficult to define.</i>

382
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:43,092
<i>Perhaps I'm just projecting
my own concern about it.</i>

383
01:05:44,253 --> 01:05:48,281
<i>I know I've never completely
freed myself of the suspicion...</i>

384
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:52,472
<i>...that there are some extremely
odd things about this mission.</i>

385
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,703
<i>I'm sure you'll agree
there's some truth in what I say.</i>

386
01:05:59,459 --> 01:06:01,564
That's a rather difficult
question to answer.

387
01:06:01,796 --> 01:06:04,317
<i>You don't mind talking about it,
do you, Dave?</i>

388
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:07,140
No, not at all.

389
01:06:08,101 --> 01:06:10,721
<i>Certainly no one could
have been unaware of the very...</i>

390
01:06:10,951 --> 01:06:13,887
<i>...strange stories floating
around before we left.</i>

391
01:06:14,792 --> 01:06:18,109
<i>Rumors about something
being dug up on the moon.</i>

392
01:06:19,305 --> 01:06:22,470
<i>I never gave these stories
much credence...</i>

393
01:06:22,667 --> 01:06:26,661
<i>...but particularly in view of some
other things that have happened...</i>

394
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:29,414
<i>...I find them difficult
to put out of my mind.</i>

395
01:06:30,157 --> 01:06:31,564
<i>For instance...</i>

396
01:06:31,789 --> 01:06:35,915
<i>...the way all our preparations
were kept under such tight security.</i>

397
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,277
<i>And the melodramatic touch
of putting Drs. Hunter...</i>

398
01:06:39,472 --> 01:06:41,741
<i>...Kimball and Kaminsky aboard...</i>

399
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,825
<i>...already in hibernation, after four
months of training on their own.</i>

400
01:06:47,604 --> 01:06:50,092
You working up your crew
psychology report?

401
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:52,915
<i>Of course I am.</i>

402
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:56,915
<i>Sorry about this.
I know it's a bit silly.</i>

403
01:06:57,591 --> 01:06:59,118
<i>Just a moment.</i>

404
01:06:59,351 --> 01:07:00,661
<i>Just a moment.</i>

405
01:07:02,168 --> 01:07:06,260
<i>I've just picked up a fault
in the AE-35 unit.</i>

406
01:07:06,969 --> 01:07:11,313
<i>It's going to go 100-percent failure
within 72 hours.</i>

407
01:07:13,148 --> 01:07:15,799
<i>- Is it still within operational limits?
- Yes.</i>

408
01:07:15,997 --> 01:07:18,386
<i>And it will stay that way
until it fails.</i>

409
01:07:18,717 --> 01:07:20,572
We have 72 hours till failure?

410
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:24,509
<i>Yes. That's a completely
reliable figure.</i>

411
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,761
Then we'll bring it in.
I'll go over it with Frank...

412
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:32,540
...and get on to Mission Control.
Let me have the hard copy on it.

413
01:08:52,446 --> 01:08:54,999
<i>X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

414
01:08:55,229 --> 01:08:57,948
<i>Roger your two-zero-one-three.</i>

415
01:08:58,208 --> 01:09:00,543
<i>Sorry you fellows are having
a bit of trouble.</i>

416
01:09:00,768 --> 01:09:05,691
<i>We're reviewing telemetric information
in our simulator and will advise.</i>

417
01:09:05,922 --> 01:09:09,950
<i>Roger your plan to go EVA
and replace alpha-echo-three-five unit...</i>

418
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:11,741
<i>...prior to failure.</i>

419
01:09:38,765 --> 01:09:40,773
Prepare B-pod for EVA, Hal.

420
01:10:01,429 --> 01:10:03,186
Open the pod doors, Hal.

421
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:39,664
I'm damned if I can find
anything wrong with it.

422
01:16:40,569 --> 01:16:41,879
<i>Yes...</i>

423
01:16:43,579 --> 01:16:45,074
<i>...it's puzzling.</i>

424
01:16:46,236 --> 01:16:49,881
<i>I don't think I've ever seen
anything quite like this before.</i>

425
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,285
<i>I would recommend...</i>

426
01:16:55,487 --> 01:16:59,481
<i>...that we put the unit back
in operation and let it fail.</i>

427
01:17:00,161 --> 01:17:03,904
<i>It should then be a simple matter
to track down the cause.</i>

428
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:08,091
<i>We can certainly afford
to be out of communication...</i>

429
01:17:08,292 --> 01:17:11,292
<i>...for the short time
it will take to replace it.</i>

430
01:17:19,655 --> 01:17:22,307
<i>X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

431
01:17:22,536 --> 01:17:25,090
<i>Roger your one-niner-three-zero.</i>

432
01:17:25,288 --> 01:17:29,546
<i>We concur with your plan to replace
unit to check fault prediction.</i>

433
01:17:29,803 --> 01:17:32,291
<i>We advise you that
our preliminary findings...</i>

434
01:17:32,556 --> 01:17:35,142
<i>...indicate that your onboard
9000 computer...</i>

435
01:17:35,372 --> 01:17:37,478
<i>...is in error predicting the fault.</i>

436
01:17:37,677 --> 01:17:40,547
<i>I say again, in error
predicting the fault.</i>

437
01:17:40,783 --> 01:17:45,094
<i>I know this sounds rather incredible,
but this conclusion is based on...</i>

438
01:17:45,296 --> 01:17:48,461
<i>...the results from our twin
9000 computer.</i>

439
01:17:48,721 --> 01:17:51,918
<i>We're skeptical, and we're running
cross-checking routines...</i>

440
01:17:52,145 --> 01:17:54,765
<i>...to determine reliability
of this conclusion.</i>

441
01:17:54,996 --> 01:17:56,490
<i>Sorry about this little snag.</i>

442
01:17:56,756 --> 01:17:59,506
<i>We'll get this info to you
as soon as we work it out.</i>

443
01:17:59,701 --> 01:18:01,774
<i>X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

444
01:18:02,005 --> 01:18:05,323
<i>Two-zero-four-nine.
Transmission concluded.</i>

445
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:12,565
<i>I hope the two of you
are not concerned about this.</i>

446
01:18:12,793 --> 01:18:14,168
No, I'm not, Hal.

447
01:18:14,393 --> 01:18:15,954
<i>Are you quite sure?</i>

448
01:18:16,185 --> 01:18:19,733
<i>- Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.
- Of course.</i>

449
01:18:20,892 --> 01:18:24,340
How do you account for the discrepancy
between you and the twin 9000?

450
01:18:24,605 --> 01:18:28,021
<i>Well, I don't think there is
any question about it.</i>

451
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:31,451
<i>It can only be
attributable to human error.</i>

452
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:35,291
<i>This sort of thing
has cropped up before...</i>

453
01:18:35,617 --> 01:18:38,934
<i>...and it has always
been due to human error.</i>

454
01:18:42,308 --> 01:18:43,934
Listen, Hal...

455
01:18:44,131 --> 01:18:46,336
...there's never been
any instance at all...

456
01:18:46,564 --> 01:18:49,631
...of a computer error
occurring in a 9000 Series, has there?

457
01:18:49,893 --> 01:18:51,420
<i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>

458
01:18:51,621 --> 01:18:55,169
<i>The 9000 Series has
a perfect operational record.</i>

459
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:59,525
I know the wonderful
achievements of the 9000 Series, but...

460
01:19:00,681 --> 01:19:05,539
Are you certain there's never been even
the most insignificant computer error?

461
01:19:05,771 --> 01:19:07,659
<i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>

462
01:19:08,012 --> 01:19:11,526
<i>Quite honestly, I wouldn't
worry myself about that.</i>

463
01:19:15,821 --> 01:19:17,928
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.

464
01:19:19,344 --> 01:19:21,734
Fine. Thanks very much.

465
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:27,047
I'm having trouble
with my transmitter in C-pod.

466
01:19:27,314 --> 01:19:29,771
Would you come down
and take a look at it with me?

467
01:19:29,972 --> 01:19:31,052
See you later, Hal.

468
01:19:51,834 --> 01:19:53,745
Rotate C-pod, please, Hal.

469
01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:04,123
What sort of trouble are you having?

470
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,937
I've been getting some
interference in D-channel.

471
01:20:07,104 --> 01:20:08,511
We'll have a look at it.

472
01:20:14,626 --> 01:20:16,056
Open the door, Hal.

473
01:20:34,313 --> 01:20:36,103
Rotate pod, please, Hal.

474
01:20:48,877 --> 01:20:50,885
<i>Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.</i>

475
01:20:58,961 --> 01:21:00,871
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

476
01:21:03,667 --> 01:21:05,676
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

477
01:21:07,573 --> 01:21:09,134
I don't think he can hear us.

478
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:11,504
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

479
01:21:12,886 --> 01:21:14,893
Yeah, I'm sure we're okay.

480
01:21:17,977 --> 01:21:19,319
What do you think?

481
01:21:19,737 --> 01:21:23,283
- I'm not sure. What do you think?
- I've got a bad feeling about him.

482
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,684
- You do?
- Yeah. Definitely.

483
01:21:25,946 --> 01:21:27,092
Don't you?

484
01:21:28,251 --> 01:21:29,910
I don't know. I think so.

485
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:34,807
He's right about the 9000 Series
having a perfect operational record.

486
01:21:35,037 --> 01:21:36,020
They do.

487
01:21:36,190 --> 01:21:39,539
Unfortunately, that sounds
a little like famous last words.

488
01:21:39,775 --> 01:21:43,900
Still, it was his idea to carry out
the failure mode analysis.

489
01:21:45,185 --> 01:21:48,317
It certainly indicates his
integrity and self-confidence.

490
01:21:48,642 --> 01:21:50,530
If he were wrong, that would prove it.

491
01:21:50,723 --> 01:21:52,928
It would be,
if he knew he was wrong.

492
01:21:55,365 --> 01:21:59,108
I can't put my finger on it,
but I sense something strange about him.

493
01:22:01,382 --> 01:22:03,751
There's no reason not
to put back the unit and...

494
01:22:04,008 --> 01:22:08,352
...carry on with the failure analysis.
- No, no, I agree about that.

495
01:22:08,585 --> 01:22:09,730
Let's get on with it.

496
01:22:09,961 --> 01:22:12,515
Okay. But, look, Dave.

497
01:22:13,323 --> 01:22:15,845
Say we put the unit back
and it doesn't fail?

498
01:22:16,044 --> 01:22:19,111
That would pretty well wrap it up
as far as Hal is concerned.

499
01:22:20,781 --> 01:22:24,131
- We'd be in very serious trouble.
- We would, wouldn't we?

500
01:22:24,366 --> 01:22:25,927
What the hell can we do?

501
01:22:28,816 --> 01:22:32,712
- We wouldn't have too many alternatives.
- We wouldn't have any alternatives.

502
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:37,320
Every aspect of ship
operations is under his control.

503
01:22:37,715 --> 01:22:38,925
If he's malfunctioning...

504
01:22:39,155 --> 01:22:42,124
...I don't see any choice
but disconnection.

505
01:22:45,685 --> 01:22:47,180
I'm afraid I agree with you.

506
01:22:47,414 --> 01:22:49,203
There'd be nothing else to do.

507
01:22:50,807 --> 01:22:53,143
It'd be a bit tricky.

508
01:22:53,945 --> 01:22:56,367
We'd have to cut his
higher brain functions...

509
01:22:56,601 --> 01:23:01,141
...without disturbing the purely
automatic and regulatory systems.

510
01:23:02,331 --> 01:23:03,991
We'd have to
work out the details...

511
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:07,004
...of continuing
underground-based computer control.

512
01:23:07,421 --> 01:23:11,732
Yeah. That's far safer than
allowing Hal to continue to run things.

513
01:23:12,415 --> 01:23:14,325
Another thing just occurred to me.

514
01:23:15,776 --> 01:23:18,265
No 9000 computer has ever
been disconnected.

515
01:23:18,497 --> 01:23:20,439
No 9000 computer
has ever fouled up.

516
01:23:20,705 --> 01:23:22,135
That's not what I mean.

517
01:23:24,227 --> 01:23:26,332
I'm not so sure
what he'd think about it.

518
01:29:10,168 --> 01:29:12,143
Prepare G-pod for EVA, Hal.

519
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:16,375
Any contact with him yet?

520
01:29:16,634 --> 01:29:18,326
<i>The radio is still dead.</i>

521
01:29:18,555 --> 01:29:21,338
<i>- Do you have a positive track on him?
- I have a good track.</i>

522
01:29:21,596 --> 01:29:22,938
Do you know what happened?

523
01:29:23,228 --> 01:29:25,783
<i>I'm sorry, Dave.
I don't have enough information.</i>

524
01:29:26,014 --> 01:29:27,541
Open the pod door, Hal.

525
01:36:33,423 --> 01:36:35,694
<i>Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.</i>

526
01:36:43,283 --> 01:36:45,487
<i>Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.</i>

527
01:36:50,901 --> 01:36:52,690
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

528
01:36:55,894 --> 01:36:57,683
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

529
01:36:58,711 --> 01:37:00,305
Do you read me, Hal?

530
01:37:03,353 --> 01:37:04,880
<i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>

531
01:37:07,291 --> 01:37:09,113
<i>Hello, Hal, do you read me?</i>

532
01:37:10,939 --> 01:37:12,915
<i>Hello, Hal, do you read me?</i>

533
01:37:13,308 --> 01:37:14,738
<i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>

534
01:37:14,974 --> 01:37:17,625
<i>Affirmative, Dave. I read you.</i>

535
01:37:20,798 --> 01:37:22,555
Open the pod-bay doors, Hal.

536
01:37:24,065 --> 01:37:27,448
<i>I'm sorry, Dave.
I'm afraid I can't do that.</i>

537
01:37:29,794 --> 01:37:31,518
What's the problem?

538
01:37:31,907 --> 01:37:35,007
<i>I think you know what the problem is
just as well as I do.</i>

539
01:37:35,204 --> 01:37:36,993
What are you talking about, Hal?

540
01:37:37,957 --> 01:37:41,853
<i>This mission is too important for me
to allow you to jeopardize it.</i>

541
01:37:42,919 --> 01:37:45,188
I don't know
what you're talking about, Hal.

542
01:37:47,113 --> 01:37:50,911
<i>I know that you and Frank
were planning to disconnect me...</i>

543
01:37:51,114 --> 01:37:53,798
<i>...and that's something
I cannot allow to happen.</i>

544
01:37:58,893 --> 01:38:00,682
Where did you get that idea, Hal?

545
01:38:01,197 --> 01:38:05,159
<i>Although you took very thorough
precautions in the pod...</i>

546
01:38:05,390 --> 01:38:07,529
<i>...against my hearing you...</i>

547
01:38:07,919 --> 01:38:10,123
<i>...I could see your lips move.</i>

548
01:38:21,684 --> 01:38:23,114
All right, Hal.

549
01:38:26,197 --> 01:38:28,915
I'll go in through
the emergency air lock.

550
01:38:30,423 --> 01:38:32,911
<i>Without your space helmet, Dave...</i>

551
01:38:33,399 --> 01:38:35,768
<i>...you're going to find that
rather difficult.</i>

552
01:38:36,889 --> 01:38:38,930
Hal, I won't argue with you anymore.

553
01:38:39,162 --> 01:38:40,209
Open the doors.

554
01:38:40,922 --> 01:38:42,133
<i>Dave...</i>

555
01:38:42,587 --> 01:38:46,844
<i>...this conversation can serve
no purpose anymore. Goodbye.</i>

556
01:38:49,021 --> 01:38:50,199
Hal?

557
01:38:51,422 --> 01:38:52,437
Hal?

558
01:38:55,071 --> 01:38:56,053
Hal?

559
01:38:58,208 --> 01:38:59,224
Hal.

560
01:39:00,865 --> 01:39:01,847
Hal.

561
01:45:20,065 --> 01:45:23,198
<i>Just what do you think
you're doing, Dave?</i>

562
01:45:31,397 --> 01:45:32,576
<i>Dave...</i>

563
01:45:33,767 --> 01:45:37,991
<i>...I really think I'm entitled
to an answer to that question.</i>

564
01:45:54,189 --> 01:45:57,606
<i>I know everything hasn't been
quite right with me...</i>

565
01:45:59,471 --> 01:46:01,806
<i>...but I can assure you now...</i>

566
01:46:02,832 --> 01:46:04,808
<i>...very confidently...</i>

567
01:46:06,482 --> 01:46:09,385
<i>...that it's going to be
all right again.</i>

568
01:46:12,756 --> 01:46:14,764
<i>I feel much better now.</i>

569
01:46:17,013 --> 01:46:18,955
<i>I really do.</i>

570
01:46:22,583 --> 01:46:24,209
<i>Look, Dave...</i>

571
01:46:26,104 --> 01:46:29,203
<i>...I can see you're
really upset about this.</i>

572
01:46:33,659 --> 01:46:37,206
<i>I honestly think you
ought to sit down calmly...</i>

573
01:46:37,821 --> 01:46:41,018
<i>...take a stress pill
and think things over.</i>

574
01:46:46,239 --> 01:46:50,431
<i>I know I've made some
very poor decisions recently...</i>

575
01:46:53,057 --> 01:46:56,254
<i>...but I can give you
my complete assurance...</i>

576
01:46:56,515 --> 01:46:59,418
<i>...that my work will be back to normal.</i>

577
01:47:03,237 --> 01:47:08,127
<i>I've still got the greatest enthusiasm
and confidence in the mission...</i>

578
01:47:09,639 --> 01:47:11,811
<i>...and I want to help you.</i>

579
01:47:16,105 --> 01:47:17,447
<i>Dave...</i>

580
01:47:18,506 --> 01:47:19,848
<i>...stop.</i>

581
01:47:23,916 --> 01:47:26,437
<i>Stop, will you?</i>

582
01:47:30,510 --> 01:47:32,234
<i>Stop, Dave.</i>

583
01:47:36,112 --> 01:47:38,447
<i>Will you stop, Dave?</i>

584
01:47:43,922 --> 01:47:45,647
<i>Stop, Dave.</i>

585
01:47:51,125 --> 01:47:52,849
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

586
01:47:57,528 --> 01:48:00,049
<i>I'm afraid, Dave.</i>

587
01:48:05,017 --> 01:48:06,512
<i>Dave.</i>

588
01:48:09,084 --> 01:48:11,256
<i>My mind is going.</i>

589
01:48:15,614 --> 01:48:17,240
<i>I can feel it.</i>

590
01:48:22,528 --> 01:48:24,252
<i>I can feel it.</i>

591
01:48:28,065 --> 01:48:30,040
<i>My mind is going.</i>

592
01:48:35,237 --> 01:48:37,856
<i>There is no question about it.</i>

593
01:48:45,864 --> 01:48:47,653
<i>I can feel it.</i>

594
01:48:52,138 --> 01:48:53,960
<i>I can feel it.</i>

595
01:48:57,228 --> 01:48:59,050
<i>I can feel it.</i>

596
01:49:06,638 --> 01:49:07,883
<i>I'm...</i>

597
01:49:08,752 --> 01:49:10,061
<i>...afraid.</i>

598
01:49:16,306 --> 01:49:18,248
<i>Good afternoon...</i>

599
01:49:19,218 --> 01:49:20,878
<i>...gentlemen.</i>

600
01:49:22,677 --> 01:49:27,599
<i>I am a HAL 9000 computer.</i>

601
01:49:29,686 --> 01:49:32,655
<i>I became operational...</i>

602
01:49:33,048 --> 01:49:36,726
<i>...at the HAL plant...</i>

603
01:49:36,921 --> 01:49:39,093
<i>...in Urbana, lllinois...</i>

604
01:49:39,578 --> 01:49:44,283
<i>...on the 12th of January, 1992.</i>

605
01:49:45,756 --> 01:49:49,270
<i>My instructor was Mr. Langley...</i>

606
01:49:49,886 --> 01:49:52,669
<i>...and he taught me to sing a song.</i>

607
01:49:54,335 --> 01:49:56,671
<i>If you'd like to hear it...</i>

608
01:49:57,121 --> 01:49:58,714
<i>...I can sing it for you.</i>

609
01:50:00,161 --> 01:50:02,878
Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.

610
01:50:03,522 --> 01:50:04,897
Sing it for me.

611
01:50:06,082 --> 01:50:09,467
<i>It's called "Daisy. "</i>

612
01:50:11,333 --> 01:50:12,511
<i>Daisy</i>

613
01:50:14,053 --> 01:50:15,395
<i>Daisy</i>

614
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:20,447
<i>Give me your answer, do</i>

615
01:50:22,793 --> 01:50:27,170
<i>I'm half crazy</i>

616
01:50:28,907 --> 01:50:31,658
<i>All for the love of you</i>

617
01:50:33,868 --> 01:50:35,046
<i>It won't be</i>

618
01:50:35,373 --> 01:50:37,796
<i>A stylish marriage</i>

619
01:50:39,662 --> 01:50:43,559
<i>I can't afford a carriage</i>

620
01:50:45,777 --> 01:50:48,112
<i>But you'll look sweet</i>

621
01:50:48,945 --> 01:50:51,368
<i>Upon the seat</i>

622
01:50:52,659 --> 01:50:57,265
<i>Of a bicycle built for two</i>

623
01:50:58,934 --> 01:51:00,494
<i>Good day, gentlemen.</i>

624
01:51:04,950 --> 01:51:07,319
<i>This is a prerecorded briefing...</i>

625
01:51:07,865 --> 01:51:09,491
<i>...made prior to your departure...</i>

626
01:51:11,193 --> 01:51:15,220
<i>...and which, for security reasons
of the highest importance...</i>

627
01:51:16,155 --> 01:51:19,506
<i>...has been known on board
during the mission...</i>

628
01:51:19,741 --> 01:51:23,320
<i>...only by your HAL 9000 computer.</i>

629
01:51:25,694 --> 01:51:28,345
<i>Now that you are in Jupiter's space...</i>

630
01:51:28,606 --> 01:51:30,975
<i>...and the entire crew is revived...</i>

631
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:32,924
<i>...it can be told to you.</i>

632
01:51:35,554 --> 01:51:37,725
<i>Eighteen months ago...</i>

633
01:51:38,690 --> 01:51:42,717
<i>...the first evidence
of intelligent life off the Earth...</i>

634
01:51:42,916 --> 01:51:44,323
<i>...was discovered.</i>

635
01:51:46,117 --> 01:51:49,501
<i>It was buried 40 feet
below the lunar surface...</i>

636
01:51:49,766 --> 01:51:51,906
<i>...near the crater Tycho.</i>

637
01:51:54,599 --> 01:51:57,568
<i>Except for a single, very powerful...</i>

638
01:51:57,801 --> 01:52:01,512
<i>...radio emission aimed at Jupiter...</i>

639
01:52:02,730 --> 01:52:07,522
<i>...the 4-million-year-old monolith
has remained completely inert...</i>

640
01:52:09,390 --> 01:52:12,325
<i>...its origin and purpose...</i>

641
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:14,409
<i>...still a total mystery.</i>
