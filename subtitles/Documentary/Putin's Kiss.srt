passed the Medical School Nursing Department test!

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.860
My reward for working so hard was...

6
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.690
Of course, my long-desired date with Irie-kun.

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.840
People say that couples  who ride the boats in this park will break up.

8
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.130
What?

9
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.830
What are you going to do?

10

You've already gotten into the boat.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.390
Why didn't you say anything before we got on?

12
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.300
If you knew you shouldn't have...

13
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.980
Because you wanted to go on this kind of date?

14
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.400
With me.  On a boat.

15
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.900
What do you mean?

16
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.270
For me, I would never go on   a date like the one you planned.

17
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.980
But since you stayed up all night planning this date,

18
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.810
I wanted to do at least part of it.

19
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.580
What are you going to do?

20
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.720
Are you going to believe in this  ridiculous curse and get off the boat?

21

According to the rumours it seems like  his wife is in the same year as him.

162
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.390
It is unforgivable!

163
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:55.280
What kind of woman would Irie-kun be willing to spend his life with?

164
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.300
She must be a beautiful, smart woman, of course!

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.210
Let's go, let's go! Tomoko, you'll go too, right?

170
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:26.880
Moto-chan, to pinpoint where his house is you're really persistent huh?

171
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.580
Isn't that expected?

172
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.240
As president of the fan club, I must spy on his wife!

173
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.540
<i>What? Come to my house?</i>

174
00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.200
<i>I know, right?</i>

175
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:43.050
<i>What should I do!? I'm Irie-kun's wife!</i>

176
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:47.720
<i>But, if they found out....I can't stay here anymore.</i>

177
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.770
<i></i>I will have a hard time those three years not to get found out by those three in hiding Irie.<i></i>

178
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.250
<i>How pitiful, I am.</i>

179
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.760
Hey!! How long are you going to be putting air in?!

180
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.230
What?

181
00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:05.800
Look! The color has change, hasn't it?!

182
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.480
But hey, don't get too angry or your blood pressure will rise!

183
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.280
Who was the one who angered me?!

184
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.010
The next one will be fine, okay?

185
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:19.130
I didn't want to be in the same group as you…

186
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.040
Why not?

187
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.640
It hurts, it hurts! Stop, stop!

188
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.360
You're stopping the blood flow to my hand!

189
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.840
That's because, I can't hear Keita's pulse!

190
00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.360
What?

191
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.760
You...

192
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.680
have the stethoscope placed wrong.

193
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.980
Do you have some kind of special reason?

194
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.060
I'm sorry! One more time.

195
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.280
Stop fooling around! What would you do if I were an actual patient?!

196
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.060
Don't get so angry! I only failed once...

197
00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.800
Nope, this was your third failure.

198
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.000
No, isn't it the fourth?

199
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.390
To be exact, the sixth time.

200
00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:12.170
If you're aiming to become a nurse  for frivolous reasons that's wrong!

201
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.280
They aren't irresponsible feelings!

202
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.170
I want to be Irie-kun's support!

203
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:21.620
What? Why would you want to be Irie-san's support?

204
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.440
That's because...

205
00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.620
Because...

206
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:35.040
I'm Irie-kun's wife!

207
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.810
 

208
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.140
What are you talking about?

209
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.020
Kotoko, that's awesome!

210
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.740
Don't laugh!

211
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.340
I understand. You're just saying that, right?

212
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.620
Then, I'm also Irie-san's wife!

213
00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:00.660
Moto, even if...

214
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.700
Excuse me.

215
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.680
Irie-san!

216
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.510
 

217
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.710
Kotoko!

218
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.180
<i>What?</i>

219
00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:16.620
You left this behind! Mother told me to deliver it to you.

220
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.820
Then, bye.

221
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.180
Irie-san!!

222
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:32.430
Ko-to-ko!

223
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.360
See! I told you, it was true.

224
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.820
What did you hear about Irie-san?

225
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.000
I'm sorry! I wasn't planing to lie!

226
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.170
I couldn't tell you guys.

227
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.120
<i>Now I will no longer survive in this nursing department...<i></i></i>

228
00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:59.360
Hey, it's okay. You don't need to apologize.

229
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.880
I'm not angry at all.

230
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.340
Because if you are Irie-san's wife,

231
00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.280
we don't have a reason to give up anymore, right?

232
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.990
I thought Irie-san was someone I would not be able to reach, but

233
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:16.440
it seems like we have some hope.

234
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.720
Right!

235
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.040
<i>Seems complicated...</i>

236
00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.680
Irie-kun!

237
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.530
Move over!

238
00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.040
Irie-kun!

239
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.290
Irie-kun!

240
00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:40.630
<i>So from now on I will become a good wife to Irie-kun.<i></i></i>

241
00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.420
Watch closely.

242
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:52.500
 

243
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.100
I did it!

244
00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.160
Kotoko, I'm begging you.

245
00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.880
Leave it to me.

246
00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.260
<i>I established strong friendships with our team,</i>

247
00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:06.780
<i>and, even through the tough times, I had a fulfilling college life</i>

248
00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:11.680
<i>but the greatest challenge still awaits us.</i>

249
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.360
<i>Medication Intramuscular Injection</i>

250
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.390
Injections should be given about three fingers down  from the shoulder.

251
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:20.750
Right here at the center of Deltoid muscle.

252
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:27.670
<i>Oh, snap! I'm not good at giving injection.</i>

253
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:33.410
When you inject it in the right position, you will see the green light.

254
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:39.350
During the injection, the blood...

255
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:43.860
Everything is clear up till this point, right? We shall now begin practising injections.

256
00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.940
Please practise hard since the test will be next week.

257
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.700
There'll be a break after everyone in the group has made a successful injection.

258
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.900
Yes.

259
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.020
Alright, we'll be the first.

260
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.520
So let's do it!

261
00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:06.040
This feels totally the same...

262
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:10.280
Well, let's hurry and finish this up then go for lunch.

263
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.840
Well then, Keita, lend me your arm.

264
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.430
What?

265
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:17.350
Oh, Keita you've a nice arm.

266
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:18.350
Will you be okay?

267
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:20.690
It's okay, it's okay.

268
00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:22.210
Then who will do it?

269
00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.230
I'll do it!

270
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.120
It's okay, though.

271
00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.880
You're not scared?

272
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.720
Not at all.

273
00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.020
Syringe.

274
00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.620
Yes.

275
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:47.010
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Mischievous Kisser Team @ Viki.com</i>

276
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.050
How does it feel?

277
00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.090
It's Tomoko's dream.

278
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:08.990
Marina-chan, you're skilled.

279
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.070
All done.

280
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.400
Then, last is Kotoko.

281
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.110
Yes.

282
00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.580
Do it proper!

283
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.380
Right! Irie Kotoko will go!

284
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:29.080
That is my shoulder!

285
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.740
Here.  -It's here.

286
00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.320
Are you okay? -I'm fine, I'm okay.

287
00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.620
There's an idiot who gives an injection with her eyes closed?

288
00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.580
Well...it's scary to look at an injection...

289
00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.540
Don't just leave it there!

290
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.230
Hi-yah!

291
00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.240
Still not done?

292
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.440
It's only us now, right?

293
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.060
I'm starving!

294
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.570
This time, surely!

295
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:18.950
Hey!

296
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.810
What can't you get it right?

297
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:26.750
Pinch with your fingers and go to the raised muscle!

298
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:31.170
I understand but it goes wrong when I try! Sorry.

299
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.740
How many time do you have to be told to understand?!

300
00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:42.870
Because of you, our team is <i>always</i> last.

301
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.950
If you feel bad, you should help us organize

302
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.010
a get-together with Irie-san, right?

303
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:51.730
Well, that...

304
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.680
Seriously, I can't believe it.

305
00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.860
Irie-kun!

306
00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:57.660
<i>Irie-san!</i>

307
00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:03.840
Kotoko, if you're going to be like that,  please don't come to the same hospital I am in in the future.

308
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.910
Well, I think she'll first have to pass the national exam...

309
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.530
You should do something about it!

310
00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:13.410
It's impossible for her to become a nurse  if she carries on like that.

311
00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.970
What do you mean "impossible"?

312
00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:20.940
You're a genius right? You should do something about it.

313
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:25.680
I didn't become a doctor just for her.

314
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:31.220
If she doesn't have the ability to become a nurse, that's that. It's not my problem.

315
00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.190
She's your wife, right?

316
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:37.910
If you're bothered, you can do something about it.

317
00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:39.940
Sorry for taking up your time.

318
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.500
He's cool!!

319
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.610
What's up with him!

320
00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.900
Are you alright with him saying that?  What did you get married for?

321
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.260
Face? Status?

322
00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.720
It's okay. Just calm down. It's okay with me.

323
00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:04.950
Besides, it's the truth.  It's mutual knowledge, so I'm used to it.

324
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:07.770
Irie-kun doesn't go easy on me.

325
00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.480
It's not that!!

326
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.720
Husband and wife should encourage one another,

327
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:18.510
and do all the things while holding one another!

328
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.110
That's the way you can be together for life!

329
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:23.570
Encouraging one another, together...

330
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.960
Keita has a really ideal image of marriage, right?

331
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.700
But, that's great.

332
00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.280
What?

333
00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:38.620
Because you don't seem to be very loved by Irie-san.

334
00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.000
That's wrong...!

335
00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:57.630
Can I really become a great nurse like that?

336
00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.690
Furthermore...

337
00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:05.930
<i>Thanks to you, our group is always last</i>

338
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:13.150
<i>If you feel bad, hurry up and organize a get together with Irie-san.</i>

339
00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:15.360
And they say that...

340
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.120
Irie-kun doesn't even like things like get-togethers...

341
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.790
Tears...onion...

342
00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.640
It hurts.

343
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.730
Kotoko-chan, what's wrong?

344
00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:29.030
Are you crying?

345
00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:33.770
Well, the road to being a nurse is really tough.

346
00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:36.450
That's right.

347
00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:41.770
You've tread into unfamiliar territory just for Naoki.

348
00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:46.150
You're so admirable, Kotoko-chan!

349
00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:47.260
Okay then.

350
00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:51.900
I will tell you a story that will make you happy.

351
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:57.400
In fact, the land that Papa has in Hokkaido.

352
00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.590
There is a village that doesn't have any doctors.

353
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:03.850
Working at a large hospital is nice, but

354
00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:09.870
wouldn't it also be nice  to work at a small clinic, just you and Irie?

355
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:11.290
Only the two of us?

356
00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:12.680
That's right.

357
00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.330
You would be thanked by all the villagers

358
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:21.010
and at night you would be enveloped by a sky full of stars.

359
00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.120
Give me a break.

360
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:28.050
Naoki, you're back already?

361
00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.130
Yes.

362
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:32.840
To cut off your wild imagination.

363
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:38.950
That kind of nurse who can't give an injection.  Please don't put just the two of us together.

364
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:44.660
But Kotoko-chan has been putting effort  both into being a wife and a student!

365
00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:50.910
Oh Irie-kun, today's dinner is your favorite beef stew!

366
00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.510
I'm gonna make a lot so you can have it tomorrow too!

367
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:57.420
I don't need dinner for tomorrow.

368
00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.470
Eating out?

369
00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:00.600
Yeah.

370
00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.900
We're  having a dinner party.

371
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.870
Wow, it's rare that you're attending!

372
00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:13.380
How many people is it going to be?

373
00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:17.310
Well...6~7 people.

374
00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.450
Where?

375
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.150
Shibuya.

376
00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:27.140
So it's Shibuya.

377
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.200
What's the name of the place?

378
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.730
I don't know!

379
00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.190
I'm not even interested.

380
00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:47.880
6:59 p.m. we are all here. Let's go in.

381
00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.610
- Have you been here? - No.

382
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.510
Welcome!

383
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:55.730
I've a reservation for 7pm under Funatsu.

384
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.730
Sorry for the wait.

385
00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:01.180
Your companions are this way.

386
00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:05.070
Right through here.

387
00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:08.360
Wow, what a coincidence!

388
00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.100
Tounan University's medical students right?

389
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.590
We're second years from the nursing department!

390
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:18.490
It's alright if we're together right?

391
00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.190
We're okay right, everyone?

392
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:23.240
It sounds like it'll be fun!

393
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.730
What a coincidence right, Irie?

394
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:28.370
Kotoko!

395
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:34.090
Oh, Irie-kun what a coincidence.

396
00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:36.730
What coincidence? This was your doing isn't it.

397
00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.620
It's just coincidence.

398
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.450
Ah!! That's why you called me last night.

399
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:45.780
I thought it was weird when you asked  about tomorrow's restaurant.

400
00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:55.450
Well, everyone please sit down.

401
00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.550
Please sit!

402
00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:00.360
Here you go, Irie-san!

403
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.120
Thank you.

404
00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:08.410
-Here you go. -Thank you!

405
00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.650
Marina-chan, your such a considerate person.

406
00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:12.720
Is that so?

407
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.310
I always do this so…

408
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.720
You're so feminine.

409
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.380
Wow, she's that refined.

410
00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.590
She doesn't even do that in front of us.

411
00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.770
She changes so much in front of men, right?

412
00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:24.190
Sorry for the wait,

413
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:27.750
this is the house special beef.

414
00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:31.500
Looks delicious!

415
00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:52.560
You're good in cutting, aren't you Tomoko-chan!?

416
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.150
At times like this you can see who really likes cooking!

417
00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:58.700
I don't particularly enjoy cooking...

418
00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.590
- I like cutting meat. - What?!

419
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.490
That's why I applied for nursing.

420
00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:09.600
That way I will be able to cut as much as I like, right?

421
00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:18.160
But, nurses can't use scalpel at someone's body, right?

422
00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.010
Yes. That's right.

423
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:26.180
No way?!

424
00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:29.720
Then, I can't hold a scalpel forever?

425
00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:35.250
I even made a scapel with my name  to commemorate getting in.

426
00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:42.750
<i>What's wrong?</i>

427
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:46.370
Although she has the image of an angel...

428
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:51.810
You really can't judge a book by its cover, right?

429
00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.110
Irie-san! You're too close!

430
00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:00.260
You're heavy!

431
00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.610
What did you say?!

432
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:04.640
What?! Doesn't he look like he's having fun?

433
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.460
And with a woman on top of that.

434
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:16.110
He's a energetic person, your husband. Although he's married...

435
00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.240
Irie-san is always so popular.

436
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:31.430
Funatsu-kun, since it's such a good opportunity, you shouldn't pull a long face.

437
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:33.200
Why don't you talk to the girls?

438
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.290
No, I'm not interested in those.

439
00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.250
Don't say such things!

440
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:40.930
Look, aren't there many cute girls? Right?

441
00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:43.720
Well, Funatsu-san!

442
00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.880
Here you are!

443
00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.330
Is it alright if I sit here?

444
00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:51.300
It...it's alright.

445
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:55.950
I'm Shinagawa Marina, nice to meet you!

446
00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:02.640
I always thought that I should try speaking to you once.

447
00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.740
What are your hobbies?

448
00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:08.190
Reading medical books.

449
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:12.050
Then, what do you do on days off?

450
00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.270
I read medical books.

451
00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:18.800
Do you not go out at all?

452
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.830
I do go out sometimes.

453
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:21.380
Where do you go?

454
00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:25.300
I'm go to look around the whole country or go into national museums.

455
00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.380
I see.

456
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.830
Then...see you.

457
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.850
Wait wait wait wait wait!

458
00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:36.610
What?

459
00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:39.460
Try talking a bit more? He's just shy!

460
00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:40.820
Stop joking.

461
00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.940
Even if he's smart I don't want a boring guy like him!

462
00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:52.670
It looks like she left.

463
00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:57.060
Anyways, Marina doesn't seem  too compatible with Funatsu-kun.

464
00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.760
Should I bring somebody else for you?

465
00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.410
How about...that girl?

466
00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:05.110
That girl seems compatible with you, what do you think?

467
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:06.030
What do you think?

468
00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:08.210
Marina-san.

469
00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:09.420
Marina-san is good.

470
00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:13.420
Weren't you cold to her earlier?

471
00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:16.430
I'm always like this in front of girls I like.

472
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:19.720
My heart races non-stop like this, see?

473
00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:22.190
Really!

474
00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.960
Don't tell me Funatsu-kun fell in love with Marina at first sight?!

475
00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.270
Wait, Kotoko-san!

476
00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:38.410
What are you going to do, Marina?

477
00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:44.510
But Funatsu-san can't beat Irie-san.

478
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:47.330
It's natural he can't be the first!

479
00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:49.100
Damn it!

480
00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.480
It's always like that.

481
00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.890
It's always Irie, Irie, Irie! There are things Irie can't do to!

482
00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:58.730
Remember it well I will win against Irie!

483
00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:01.420
And then take back your words just  now and go out with me!

484
00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.310
You got it?!

485
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:06.710
Do you get it!?

486
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:09.440
We got it, you're being scary.

487
00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:22.010
Kamogari Keita!

488
00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:23.750
What is it?

489
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:25.660
You know what...

490
00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:29.250
I've been wanting to say this from before but,

491
00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:35.230
even though I appear like this, I'm older than you!

492
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:37.770
In fact, by three years.

493
00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:40.420
Three years...you know, three?

494
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:41.530
So?

495
00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:44.260
So...

496
00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.050
-Quit doing that! -That hurts!

497
00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:50.980
You always keep nagging me!

498
00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.650
Ah, that's cold.

499
00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:55.510
What are you doing?

500
00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:58.420
It spilled.

501
00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.890
You did it!

502
00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:03.150
Haha, I'm sorry.

503
00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.950
Wipe it clean...

504
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:09.300
Okay, it's wiped.

505
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.380
No matter what I say, you still act like a klutz.

506
00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:16.370
If you're older than at least act like you are.

507
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:17.710
What'd you say?!

508
00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:20.660
Ouch, that hurts!

509
00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.410
Hey.

510
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:28.030
Hey!

511
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:32.000
Don't fall asleep in a place like this.

512
00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:50.290
Ah, Kotoko fell asleep.

513
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:53.790
Ko-to-ko.

514
00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.630
Not working.

515
00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:59.880
She totally drank herself to sleep.

516
00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.290
Should we get Irie-san?

517
00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:03.940
No, its fine. I'll send her back.

518
00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.030
I haven't drank, and I've got a car.

519
00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:08.710
Irie-san is here anyway, so shouldn't  we leave it to him?

520
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:12.950
It's ok, he's enjoying himself anyway.

521
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.130
Kotoko fell asleep?

522
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:19.180
Irie-san. That's right.

523
00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:22.000
Sorry, I'll take her back.

524
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:26.120
Kotoko! Hey, let's go home.

525
00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.330
Hey!

526
00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:29.610
Hey, Kotoko, let's go home.

527
00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:32.240
 

528
00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.080
It's fine.

529
00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.270
I'll send her home.

530
00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.720
Who are you?

531
00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.210
Kamogari Keita from the nursing department.

532
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:47.150
Always being troubled by your wife.

533
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.870
And so?

534
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:54.700
I'll send her back safely,  so go enjoy yourselves with the girls there.

535
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.290
You don't care about your wife anyway, right?

536
00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:01.650
Shut your mouth.

537
00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:06.960
Whether I care about Kotoko or not has nothing to do with you.

538
00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.950
Outsiders should mind their own business.

539
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:12.330
What did you say?!

540
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:16.260
Chuu!…

541
00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:21.090
Injections, what are they?

542
00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:24.750
Why can you do it so easily?

543
00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:26.810
You awake now?

544
00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:30.490
Ah, it's Irie-kun.

545
00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:32.230
Kotoko, let's go home.

546
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:33.480
Yes!

547
00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:37.880
I guess I have no choice.

548
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:46.370
Irie-san.

549
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:50.250
Oh, Kamogari.

550
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:59.900
Don't refer to Kotoko as <i>this person<i>.</i></i>

551
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:13.930
What happened...that you're like this?

552
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:20.730
I don't like him... Irie Naoki.

553
00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:29.310
Irie-kun.

554
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:32.120
What is it?

555
00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.290
Irie-kun.

556
00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:37.610
Sleep talking huh.

557
00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:39.340
Chu...

558
00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.560
Not injections again?  <i>(kissing sound "chu" sounds like "chu-sha" for 'injection')</i>

559
00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:56.570
Keita Kamogari.

560
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:04.980
<i> Nursing Practice Room </i>

561
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:08.030
It's me again!

562
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.510
I'm cursed.

563
00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:15.040
Why? It's not even a real injection.

564
00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.410
It's just putting the model on your arm. You're exaggerating.

565
00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:18.590
Idiot.

566
00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:24.540
No matter how protected it is!!! And the syringe is in  Kotoko's trembling hands!

567
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:28.620
You don't know that horror!

568
00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.200
It's alright, it's alright!

569
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:36.010
Since then, I've practised countless times  on the arm of the dummy!

570
00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:38.530
Just leave it to me?

571
00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:43.410
The test duration is 15 minutes.

572
00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:45.600
Please start.

573
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.770
Yes!

574
00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:49.160
Well, first...

575
00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.990
Pinch with your fingers and raise the muscle.

576
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:54.310
Yes!

577
00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.070
That's my arm alright.

578
00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:59.340
Oh, I'm sorry.

579
00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:02.760
-Calm down! -Yes!

580
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:07.920
Then…I'm starting.

581
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.920
Okay.

582
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:16.440
-It hurts! -What are you doing?!

583
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.660
I pricked myself...

584
00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:20.380
Put this around your hand!

585
00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:31.420
Kotoko!

586
00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.220
-Hey! -Kotoko!

587
00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.430
Kotoko!

588
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:37.180
Hey, are you okay?

589
00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.030
Pull yourself together!

590
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:40.570
She's totally unconcious!

591
00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:42.420
Sensei, I'm going to take her to the sick room.

592
00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.050
-Please do so. -Should I help too?

593
00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:46.700
It's alright, I can handle it alone.

594
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:54.000
Let me pass!

595
00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.800
Let me pass!

596
00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:08.730
Make way!

597
00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:21.940
Let me pass!

598
00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.930
Make way!

599
00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:31.000
Quickly make way. Let me pass, pass!

600
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.060
That was Kotoko, right?

601
00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.120
What's wrong with her?

602
00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.720
And who's that person?

603
00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.460
Doctor, a patient!

604
00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:45.110
There's no one here.

605
00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:06.940
She's so peaceful. Makes me want to faint too.

606
00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:17.420
Seriously, seeing this person's sleeping foolish face...

607
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:47.230
What are you going to do from there?

608
00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:53.500
You again?

609
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.260
I haven't done anything.

610
00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:59.130
Are you kidding? Who would do that with her?

611
00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:03.380
It didn't seem that way to me.

612
00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:09.140
This person, I heard you carried her here after she collapsed.

613
00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:15.680
Thanks for the trouble, all for this person.

614
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.060
Since I'm here it's enough now.

615
00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:23.100
Please go back.

616
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:26.890
I was going to even if you didn't tell me to.

617
00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:30.070
Kamogari...

618
00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.850
You already know right...

619
00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:42.430
That she's married to me.

620
00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:50.790
Don't get an unneeded interest in her.

621
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:58.260
I would be...

622
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.160
I know now.

623
00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:11.080
I care for Kotoko much more than you do.

624
00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:15.690
I'd treat her better than you do.

625
00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:23.100
Is that so?
