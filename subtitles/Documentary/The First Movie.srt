Animation presents...

2
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,477
In association with...

5
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,272
All right, okay. So.

6
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,000
A long, long,
long, long time ago...

7
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,595
in a galaxy far, far away...

8
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,836
there was a planet called
Underpantyworld.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,160
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

10
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
Okay, go.

11
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,256
That's perfect.
That's perfect. Okay.

12
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,396
Underpantyworld was
a peaceful planet

13
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,670
where everybody wore
only underwear.

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,236
Until it started to blow up
for some reason.

15
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,351
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Da-da.

16
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,670
Meanwhile, the leaders
of Underpantyworld...

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,434
Big Daddy Longjohns and his
wife, Princess Pantyhose...

18
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,669
...saved their baby

19
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,677
by stretching his underwear
really far...

20
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,160
and then
they shot him into space.

21
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,952
Godspeed, little Underpants.

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
Whee!

23
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,635
Whee!

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,114
And then he crashed on Earth,

25
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,872
where he was raised
by some nice...

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,669
Dolphins?

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,518
Yeah, dolphins.
Just go with it.

28
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,795
Okay, fine.

29
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,336
Goo-goo, gah-gah.

30
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,191
Tra-la-la-la-la-la.

31
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,352
But the space baby
grew up fast.

32
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,038
Look! Up in the sky!

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,713
It's a bird!
It's a plane!

34
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,110
It's an egg salad sandwich.

35
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,396
And guess what? I'm rotten.

36
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,720
Faster than
a speeding waistband.

37
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,880
More powerful

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,672
- than boxer shorts.
- Yay!

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,639
You'll never catch me,
Captain Underpants.

40
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,518
Owie.

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,070
Able to leap tall buildings
without getting a wedgie.

42
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,798
Hey, all right.
Good for you, pal.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,911
Now put on some clothes,
you weirdo.

44
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
No way.

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,557
I fight for truth, justice,

46
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,870
and all that is
pre-shrunk and cottony.

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,473
For I am...

48
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,910
Captain Underpants!

49
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,999
The origin issue.

50
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,072
It's so good. We should've
done an origin issue ages ago.

51
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,912
Yeah, like, first.

52
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,736
You know, I'm not sure
about the dolphins, though.

53
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,909
Yeah, I know. It's just...

54
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,136
I didn't know if it was
the thing where it's,

55
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,673
like, good weird or bad weird.

56
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,560
Like, is it something...

57
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,999
The origin issue!

58
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,952
I've told you two
a thousand times

59
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,752
not to draw
these idiotic comics!

60
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
Freeze!

61
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,270
Hey, everybody!
Wait one second.

62
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,668
Hi. I'm George Beard.

63
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,256
And this is my best friend,
Harold Hutchins.

64
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,759
Hey. Ah, man.

65
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,598
It's okay. We got more ideas.

66
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,189
See, Harold loves to draw
and I love to tell stories.

67
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,191
And this old guy looking angry
right here...

68
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,430
well, this is the worst
principal in the world...

69
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Mr. Krupp.

70
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,597
Mean old Mr. Krupp.

71
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,398
Hates anything fun.

72
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,033
Like comic books...

73
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
recess...

74
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
Christmas.

75
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,234
Ho, ho, whoa!

76
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
Even kittens!

77
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,312
Oh, my goodness.
Did that really happen?

78
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,311
Uh, no, not technically.

79
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,959
But it might as well have!

80
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,750
I'm sorry.
I'm still mad about the comic.

81
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,148
Yeah, me too.

82
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,715
And unfreeze.

83
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,110
In my office, now!

84
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,438
What is happening right now?

85
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,993
I don't know.

86
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,040
Do you think he fell
asleep with his eyes open?

87
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,514
Maybe. Let's try and leave
and see what happens.

88
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,316
Door lock activated.

89
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,630
Wow. That's an expensive door.

90
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,473
It was a choice between the
magnetic automatic door closer...

91
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,949
and the music
and arts programs.

92
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,440
Pretty sure
I made the right choice.

93
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,513
This morning's school sign
is supposed to read...

94
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,433
"Sewage plant field trips
are today."

95
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,270
So can either of you explain
why it now reads...

96
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,193
"Come see my hairy armpits?"

97
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,713
I know you two
are responsible.

98
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,856
How? How do you know?
Do you have any proof?

99
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,200
I mean,
this is a country of laws.

100
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,315
The proof is here.

101
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,549
Inside my gut.

102
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,551
He must have
a lot of proof in there.

103
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,712
Quiet fives.
Quiet fives.

104
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Hmm.

105
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,155
Ever since you attended
this elementary school...

106
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,392
you've been responsible
for one prank after another.

107
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,312
Shh...

108
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,754
Wow, that's a lot of pranks.

109
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,600
Yeah, when it's cut
all together like that,

110
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,080
you really get a sense
of the scope.

111
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,056
Some of those must've been
really hard to pull off.

112
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,877
And dangerous.
Like that tiger.

113
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,268
Oh, that tiger was crazy.

114
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,431
For four long years...

115
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,656
you two have been disrupting

116
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,877
the carefully calibrated,
drone-like beehive...

117
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,878
that this elementary school
is supposed to be.

118
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,756
I may not be able
to prove it yet...

119
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,349
but I'm gonna get you two
one day.

120
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,956
One day very, very soon.

121
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,112
All right.
Fair enough.

122
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,272
Get out of my office. Now!

123
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,079
You see what we're up against?

124
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,959
And that's just a typical day
at Jerome Horwitz Elementary.

125
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,799
More like
Jerome Horwitz Penitentiary.

126
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,274
Hey, guys.

127
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,475
What's going on, Tommy?

128
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,312
Same old, same old.

129
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,437
Poor kid.

130
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,477
Time to have fun with history.

131
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,631
Memorize these dates.

132
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,557
1827, 1853, 1914, 1926.

133
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,631
First graders.
Always hits them the hardest.

134
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,319
Hold on a sec.

135
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,956
So that's why
we do what we do.

136
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,997
He's left us no choice.

137
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,559
Our pranks and practical jokes

138
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,238
are the last line
of defense...

139
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,994
against the injustice
of our terrible principal.

140
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,673
Well, well, well.

141
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,229
I heard you both got into

142
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,833
a bit of
the old trouble today.

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,120
How'd you hear that, Melvin?

144
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,832
Did you tattle-tale on us?

145
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,990
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.

146
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,588
I did.

147
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,273
Someone has to
stand up for the Man.

148
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,510
No one has to
stand up for the Man.

149
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,113
That's the whole point
of the Man.

150
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,838
He stands up
for himself, Melvin.

151
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,359
Respectfully disagree.

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,856
Attention, everyone.

153
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,016
Principal Krupp here

154
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,109
with an announcement.

155
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,193
This Saturday is the mandatory
Invention Convention.

156
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,475
Boo!
Oh, what?

157
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
Yes!

158
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,318
That's our third Saturday
this month!

159
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,796
You must be here with
your inventions at 8:00 am.

160
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,360
Is there no justice?

161
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,675
I know that's early
for Saturday, but don't worry.

162
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,016
You should be done by 9:00...

163
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
pm.

164
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Tree house?

165
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,560
Tree house.

166
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,911
Welcome to
the world headquarters

167
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,911
of Tree House Comix, Inc.

168
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,753
Yep. This is
where the magic happens.

169
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,194
Not, like, actual magic.

170
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,113
No, we're not
practicing the dark arts.

171
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,994
No, here we just hang out
and make comics

172
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,439
and try to
make each other laugh.

173
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,752
That's how we became friends.

174
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,079
This is me in kindygarten.

175
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,754
And this is me.

176
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,239
George and I
aren't friends yet.

177
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
But we're about to be.

178
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,348
The seventh planet
from the sun is called...

179
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,553
Uranus.

180
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,395
Scientists refer to Uranus...

181
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,039
Your anus.

182
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,456
...as one of the planets...

183
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,959
I know.

184
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,150
...known as a gas giant.

185
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,715
I don't get it.
It's just science, guys.

186
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,319
As I was saying...

187
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,549
Hey, I'm George. You wanna

188
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,976
hang out in my tree house
after school?

189
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,274
You have a tree house?

190
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,312
Ever since then, we've created
hundreds of comics in here.

191
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,313
Like the Wrath of
the Wicked Wedgie Woman.

192
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,948
And who could forget Sad Worm?

193
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,997
It was a worm who was sad.

194
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,914
That one's
still a work in progress.

195
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,071
But the all-time
greatest superhero

196
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,276
that we've ever created was...

197
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,071
The Amazing
Captain Underpants.

198
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,275
See, most superheroes
look like

199
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,191
they're flying around
in their underwear.

200
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,158
Well, this guy actually does.

201
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,111
Come on, let's get to work.

202
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,873
Hey, tell me what you think.

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,877
Oh, I can't wait to draw this.

204
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Tra-la-laaa!

205
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,952
Wait, wait.
Don't move, don't move.

206
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,674
Mr. Hutchins, I gotta say...

207
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,336
your drawings get better
with every issue.

208
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,033
Because your words
inspire greatness, Mr. Beard.

209
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,309
Good night, Harold.

210
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,515
Good night, George.

211
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,839
I love Saturday

212
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,992
When anything is possible

213
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,228
I love Saturday

214
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,870
'Cause I can wear
my pajamas all all day

215
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,352
I love Saturday

216
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,870
'Cause I can watch
TV all day Day

217
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,237
I can pee a little bit
in my underwear

218
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,194
And no one will mind

219
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,696
Where are you going with that?
Do you really do that?

220
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,278
No. What are you talking...

221
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,511
It's just something
I could do because...

222
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,831
Monday's an eternity away

223
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,595
When it is Saturday
Saturday

224
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,016
Get in the car, boys.

225
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,951
You've got the
Invention Convention today.

226
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,600
This thing on?

227
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,879
Quick announcement.

228
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,793
Our science teacher, Mr. Fyde,
is no longer with us.

229
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,240
He's dead?

230
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,755
What? No. Not like that.

231
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,797
He wanted to spend Saturday
with his family.

232
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,154
So I fired him.

233
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,753
I'll find a replacement
next week.

234
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,273
Ahem! Anyway...

235
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,319
on to Melvin Sneedly
with the first of his 16...

236
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,432
Actually, it's 17.

237
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,158
...17 inventions.

238
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,639
Take it away, Melvin.

239
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,389
I will now demonstrate
a prototype which I call...

240
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,949
the Robotic Sock Matcher.

241
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,633
Never waste time matching
your own socks again.

242
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,791
The Electromagnetic
Lint Collector.

243
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,154
Digital Paper Sorter.

244
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,151
It's the homework...
Automatic cushion.

245
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,475
Make it end!

246
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,155
And the personal favorite,
the binder binder.

247
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,828
Having trouble
organizing your binders?

248
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,993
Well, look no further
than this giant binder...

249
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,315
for binders.

250
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,336
Three-hole punch...

251
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,839
This is the stuff
of nightmares.

252
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,456
We have to do
something about this.

253
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,711
I don't know. Krupp looks
serious this time, George.

254
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,416
Maybe we should
just lay low for a while.

255
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,193
Lay low?
Look at our fellow children.

256
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,796
Look upon their sad,
miserable, pathetic faces.

257
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,315
Come on, Harold.

258
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,656
If you won't do it for me
and you won't do it for you...

259
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,398
do it for future generations.

260
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,993
Save the first graders...

261
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,878
the kindygarteners,
the unborn...

262
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,871
from a life
of eternal boredom!

263
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,879
Okay, let's do this.

264
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,196
Feast your eyes on this.

265
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,670
The Turbo Toilet 2000!

266
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,468
Check it out, people.

267
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,709
It's already programmed with

268
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,960
my personal potty playlist.

269
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Screwdriver.

270
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,880
Oh, samba!

271
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,800
Once you're done
using the facilities...

272
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,714
hit the button
and let my toilet wash itself.

273
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,148
Now included, automatic
toilet paper wiping claw.

274
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,878
Trademark.

275
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
Um...

276
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
I said no!

277
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,920
Huh? Oh...

278
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,553
Melvin, turn that thing off.

279
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,917
I'm trying to,
but it's not cooperating.

280
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,789
Best.
Prank.

281
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Ever.

282
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,913
Well, that brings our story
to its happy conclusion.

283
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,520
I hope you've all
enjoyed the film.

284
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,278
It was certainly shorter
than we expected.

285
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,629
What more is there to say?

286
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,995
Our fellow students got
to enjoy their weekend.

287
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,311
Which, by the way,
they are legally entitled to.

288
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,313
And good triumphed over evil
once and for...

289
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,314
Oh, boys! A moment, please.

290
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,713
What's happening to his face?

291
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,195
I think he's smiling.

292
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,032
I'm so cold.

293
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,551
So, so cold.

294
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,029
I'll let myself in,
receptionist lady.

295
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,680
Melvin.

296
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,875
What's he doing here?

297
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,191
You see, Melvin
is yet to demonstrate...

298
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,999
his most impressive invention
from today.

299
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,430
It was a little
extracurricular project

300
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,715
I asked him
to come up with myself.

301
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,678
I call him
the Tattle Turtle 200.

302
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,513
On the outside,
it resembles a turtle.

303
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,353
But on the inside,
oh, look at this.

304
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,509
It's a nanny cam!

305
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,950
Oh, Melvin. How fun.

306
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,031
Let's see what it recorded.

307
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,871
Yeah, you gotta change
the input to video.

308
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
I think I got this.

309
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,599
You're on AUX.
Change it to video.

310
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,795
It's not my TV.

311
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,216
It's your turtle.
You're doing it wrong.

312
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,309
I know.

313
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,914
I think I know
how to do my office.

314
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,835
Screwdriver.

315
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,793
Is this two-ply or one-ply?

316
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,073
We're so guilty.

317
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,999
Quiet fives. Quiet fives.

318
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,273
Wow, that nanny cam

319
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,753
really has good
picture quality.

320
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,920
Was that hi-def?

321
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,155
'Cause you could
really tell that's us.

322
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,790
I can't believe it.
I gotcha.

323
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,399
I finally gotcha!

324
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,070
We've finally got them, sir.

325
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,073
Yes, yes. Well done, Melvin.
Extra credit granted.

326
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,071
Put that in my pocket.

327
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,309
Extra credit,
it feels so good!

328
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,277
I got extra credit

329
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,476
I told you
I would get you one day.

330
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,279
And that day
I was talking about

331
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,588
is this day.

332
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,115
Today. This is the day.

333
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,976
Are you going to tell
our parents?

334
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,434
No. Your parents are obviously
total failures.

335
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,149
I have a much more effective
punishment in mind.

336
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,791
Because I'm going to have
you two placed in separate...

337
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,269
classes.

338
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,976
I'm going to annihilate
your friendship.

339
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What? No!

340
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,193
You see?
You won't be together.

341
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,192
You won't be able to enjoy

342
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,714
each other's company
and ruin my life.

343
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,189
Mr. Krupp, no.
You can't do this. Please.

344
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,470
This is too much.
I mean, even for you.

345
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,631
Enjoy the rest
of your weekend, boys.

346
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,472
Because come Monday...

347
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,199
Separate classes.
Our friendship's over.

348
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,839
I'll never see you again
in my life!

349
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,638
Hey, hey. Calm down.

350
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,068
It's not the end of the world.

351
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,360
We'll still be best friends.

352
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,835
Just way down the hall
from each other.

353
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,990
What am I talking about?
This is bad.

354
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,071
Long distance relationships
never work!

355
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,319
This is just the beginning.

356
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,159
Imagine the future.

357
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,989
Friends separated...

358
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,710
promising each other
they'll remain besties.

359
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,279
But within months,

360
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,669
we'll be awkwardly bumping
into each other at the mall.

361
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,199
Hey, George.

362
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,032
Hey. Do I know you?

363
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,952
You'll have a weird haircut.

364
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,270
I'll be wearing
a suit for some reason.

365
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,555
And before we know it,

366
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,560
separate classes
will lead to separate lives...

367
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,636
which inevitably
leads to robots.

368
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,551
What? Why are there robots
at the mall?

369
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,109
Because this is the future!
The future always has robots.

370
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,753
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

371
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,791
Why are the robots
shooting other robots?

372
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,320
Aren't they
supposed to be friends?

373
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,440
I don't know!

374
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,696
I'm the artist,
you're the writer.

375
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,948
That's why we need each other.

376
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,074
Help! Fire!

377
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,391
Okay, you're right.
No, you are right.

378
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,312
I mean, if we get put
in separate classes,

379
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,118
it's the end of the world
as we know it.

380
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,429
What are we gonna do?

381
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,431
Oh, I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

382
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,598
First thing Monday morning,
we're getting that turtle.

383
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
Edith!

384
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,953
Oh, is this a bad time?

385
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,753
I did not mean to interrupt
the copying process.

386
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
I'll go.

387
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,160
Yes, go! Please go.

388
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,356
No, no. I'm just finishing up.

389
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,108
What brings you around here?

390
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,434
I just made
this tuna casserole...

391
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,114
and I noticed
it had your name on it...

392
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,589
in jalapeno peppers.

393
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,994
Mmm...

394
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,271
It smells spicy.

395
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,953
Yep. Mmm-hmm.

396
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,270
That's 'cause it's been
dry-aged for a week.

397
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,839
I don't know what that means,

398
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,439
but it sounds
very time-consuming.

399
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,959
It took a week.

400
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,634
Eww. They like each other.

401
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,631
Oh, no, George.
I think it's much worse.

402
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,518
They like-like each other.

403
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,760
What are you talking about?

404
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,558
Adults don't
like-like other adults.

405
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,336
Well, you probably haven't
seen it at your home

406
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,560
since your parents
are married.

407
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,313
In my studies, like-liking
seems to end with marriage.

408
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,776
Well, I should probably get
back to running the school.

409
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,597
You know,
it's not gonna run itself.

410
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,354
But...

411
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,871
Oh, Edith. Get your head
out of the clouds.

412
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,071
Wait, Edith! You never gave me
the tuna casserole.

413
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,678
I think
he forgot the turtle.

414
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,068
Go, go, go.

415
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,674
That's important.

416
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,398
Great. What now?

417
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,194
Hello.
If you would like the chance

418
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,157
to win one billion dollars...
Ooh.

419
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,078
please hold for
one of our representatives.

420
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,078
It's gotta be
in here somewhere.

421
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,040
Ugh.

422
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,519
Whoa!
What?

423
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,875
Everything Krupp
ever confiscated from us.

424
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,712
Look at all that stuff.

425
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,638
Oh, dear old whoopee cushion.

426
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,552
You will sing once again.

427
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,556
Oh, my
Super Duper Soaking Machine!

428
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,269
My hypno-ring!

429
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,470
I never even got to take it
out of the wrapper.

430
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
Wow.

431
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
Look at this.

432
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,256
He's got every issue
of Captain Underpants

433
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,315
we've ever created.

434
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
You think he reads them?

435
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,856
I was kinda hoping
that we appealed

436
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,598
to a slightly
cooler demographic.

437
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,997
Well, if it isn't George Beard
and Harold Hutchins.

438
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,151
To what do I owe the pleasure?

439
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,072
Is it perhaps this?

440
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,309
Oh, no.

441
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,629
Nice try.

442
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,751
Turtle and I have grown
quite attached.

443
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,558
We're inseparable, actually.

444
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,239
I carry him wherever I go.

445
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,675
Including the shower!

446
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,953
Oh.
Poor turtle.

447
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,919
Oh, what's this?

448
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Why, it's the paperwork

449
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,911
to separate you two.

450
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,309
It's really incredible.

451
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,910
I can actually see
the end of your friendship.

452
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,435
And it ends right here.

453
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,591
On this dotted line.

454
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,793
George, do something.

455
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,999
Put the pen down, Mr. Krupp...

456
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,513
or we'll hypnotize you.

457
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,680
- What?
- What?

458
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,989
You said do something.

459
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,195
What is that?

460
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,989
Forged from the molten
plastic of Shandong, China.

461
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,628
In the lowest floor
of the darkest basement

462
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,792
where only toy prizes
dare be made...

463
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,791
exists the most
powerful item...

464
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,350
ever to be found in a box
of Frosted Sugar Doodles.

465
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,951
The hypno-ring.

466
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,635
Hypnotize me?

467
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,517
With that piece
of plastic junk?

468
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,869
Does that really work?

469
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,996
What do you think?
I got it out of a cereal box.

470
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,229
I'm warning you.

471
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,456
If you don't do what we say,

472
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,680
you're gonna
get really sleepy.

473
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,400
Oh, will I?
I'll get sleepy?

474
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,198
With that thing
pointing at me?

475
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,998
It's not making me sleepy.

476
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,718
I'm not gonna
get sleepy from...

477
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
Whoa!

478
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,354
What kind of
plastic hokum is this?

479
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,635
Whoa!

480
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,016
What's happening?
I don't know.

481
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,678
Why are we floating?

482
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,159
What was that?

483
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,429
I don't know.

484
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,160
I honestly didn't think
that would happen.

485
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,200
Gotcha. You're safe now,
little turtle.

486
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,039
When I snap my fingers,

487
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,872
you will obey
our every command.

488
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,359
Wait. How do you know this?

489
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,656
I don't know.
I just say the first thing

490
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,336
that comes to my mind
with great authority.

491
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,510
You are now a chicken.

492
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
It worked!

493
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,269
He's a chicken.

494
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,708
Okay, let me try. Let me try.

495
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,794
You're a monkey.

496
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,711
Oh! Look at him,
he's a monkey!

497
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
Come on.

498
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,715
You are now

499
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,718
the greatest superhero
of all time...

500
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,514
the amazing
Captain Underpants!

501
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,033
Tra-la-laaaaa!

502
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,910
Captain Underpants?
Is that really you?

503
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,674
Let's see.

504
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,592
Underpants, check.

505
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,955
Captain, also check.

506
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,357
I'm pretty sure
I'm Captain Underpants.

507
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
It worked!

508
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,440
Which must make you
my trusty sidekicks!

509
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,840
Sidekicks?

510
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,636
Fear not, this planet is safe
under my watchful eye.

511
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,438
This is hilarious!
This is amazing!

512
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,948
Let's see what's afoot.

513
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
Wait, no!

514
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,791
Well, that was invigorating.

515
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,473
We gotta stop him.
Why?

516
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
Huzzah!

517
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
Out of the road, bozo!

518
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,678
Why, thank you,
vehicle person!

519
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,915
Ow!

520
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,513
Yeah, we should
probably go get him.

521
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,271
Captain Underpants, wait!

522
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,679
Oh!
Ha-ha!

523
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,080
What is this?

524
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,518
Poor soul. You're trapped

525
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,473
in some sort of
invisible box-like prison.

526
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,074
What's that? I can't hear you.

527
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,912
But I see your tears.

528
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,150
Is it okay
that I'm kinda loving this?

529
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,151
Yes and no. But mostly yes.

530
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,991
Fear not,
for I will set you free!

531
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,080
Ow!
Ooh!

532
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,315
What is wrong with you?

533
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,158
Ah, that's better.
I can hear you now.

534
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,033
Sorry, sorry. We're so sorry.

535
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,240
Okay, listen, let's not be

536
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,656
punching people,
though, because...

537
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,999
Hold it.

538
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,353
Here, let me help.
Oh!

539
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,351
You're welcome, madam.

540
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,856
You know,
we should probably get you

541
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,496
back to the school
before anything else...

542
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,520
Halt!
What?

543
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,352
Do you sense that?
No.

544
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,560
Well, of course you don't.

545
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,193
You're not a superhero
like me.

546
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,590
Come, sidekicks.
Evil lurks within!

547
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,760
Oh, no!

548
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,713
Where'd he go now?

549
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,956
To the sky!

550
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,296
You'd think a guy like him
would be easy to find.

551
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,320
Found him.

552
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,954
Stand down,
you giant ape monster!

553
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,759
Giant ape monster?
What is he talking...

554
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,710
Your days of terrifying
this town are over!

555
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,632
Mr. Krupp!
I mean, Captain Underpants!

556
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,234
You can't actually fly!

557
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,311
Now I take to the sky...

558
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,595
like an ostrich!

559
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,118
I gotcha!

560
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,598
We gotta do something.

561
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,074
I've got an idea.

562
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,433
- Morning.
- Morning.

563
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,477
Oh, that is a lot of buttons.

564
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,750
Take that! Ah, cheap shot!

565
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,917
Ow! Right in the kisser!

566
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
No!

567
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
Oh, hi, guys!

568
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,955
Wait! No!

569
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,355
Follow that gorilla!

570
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,271
Oh, you put up a good fight!

571
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,352
Yeah! You are so good
at operating a crane, Harold.

572
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,272
I know!
It's really not that hard.

573
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,160
Rest assured,

574
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,838
citizens of
this marvelous metropolis...

575
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,639
I will rid you of this menace
any moment now!

576
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,638
Come on. Oh, come on,
come on, come on.

577
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,994
Victory!

578
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,434
Yes!
Bravo!

579
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,868
Oh, no, no, no!

580
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,150
Let that be a lesson
to evildoers everywhere.

581
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,477
Never underestimate the power
of underwear!

582
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,392
Who the heck are you?

583
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
What the...

584
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,473
Wow! I can't believe
we found a spot.

585
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,029
Oh, goodness.
Grandpa, you did it again.

586
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,629
He's a sleepwalker.

587
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,870
Come on, pap pap,
let's get you back into bed.

588
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,720
But what about all the other
evil villains?

589
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,114
Well, don't worry about that.

590
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,840
There's no more
evil villains around here.

591
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,838
A science teacher, hmm?

592
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,991
The perfect cover.

593
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,830
Chums! What
an astounding headquarters.

594
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,877
Stuffed full of relics...

595
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,237
all celebrating
my interplanetary exploits!

596
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,992
Oh, this takes me back.

597
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,396
What are we gonna do?
He can't just stay here.

598
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,073
We have to turn him back
into Krupp.

599
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,798
I know,
but can we just take a moment

600
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,600
to acknowledge
what's happening here please?

601
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,554
I mean, Captain Underpants is
hanging out in our tree house!

602
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,077
Look at
the cute little turtle.

603
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,918
Oh, he's so adorable.

604
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,078
Well, a hero's work
is never done.

605
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,350
Now it is time to fly again!

606
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,794
No, no, no, no!

607
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,640
Where am I?

608
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,074
Where are my pants?

609
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,275
Oh, no! He's Krupp again.

610
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,759
Ah!

611
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,718
Tra-la-laaa!

612
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,960
That's it! Now we know
what turns him back and forth.

613
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,189
Turns who what?

614
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
Why am I soaking wet?

615
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,029
Cool.
Hey.

616
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,878
Tra-la-laaa!

617
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,917
Harold!
Tra-la...

618
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,798
George!
Laaa!

619
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,109
We should probably stop.

620
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,395
Yeah, we probably should.

621
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,391
Stop doing this!
Tra-la...

622
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,118
I am Captain...

623
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,576
What are you doing?

624
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
Hello? Well, hello!

625
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,557
What's happening?
Fear not!

626
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,376
Didn't know I could do this.
Hey, sidekicks!

627
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,799
Tra! Hey! Heyo!

628
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,989
Tra-la-laaa!

629
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,113
Okay, this is the street.

630
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,680
Come on, come on.
We're almost there.

631
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,913
Evening.
Evening.

632
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,115
Drop it. No, get off. Gimme!
That's a bad dog.

633
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,955
We made it.

634
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,760
Yeesh.

635
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,990
I wonder
what horrors lie inside.

636
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,991
There's probably
wild dogs in there.

637
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,560
Probably torture implements.

638
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Rabid rats.

639
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,749
Brains in jars.

640
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,439
Jars of plucked-out eyeballs.

641
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,318
Bones of former students.

642
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,709
Why'd you scream?

643
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,632
I just assumed
there'd be something scary...

644
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,713
but it's actually
a really nice place.

645
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,680
We probably
shouldn't snoop around.

646
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,671
Yeah. Definitely not.

647
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Come on.

648
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,960
Huh.

649
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
Hmm.

650
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,991
Not So Cheery O's?

651
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,151
This guy's
bumming me out.

652
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,910
I gotta say, this has
not been the funnest snoop.

653
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,197
Yeah, no, totally.
Really sad snoop.

654
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,157
Kinda regretting it, actually.

655
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,720
I sure hope we don't ever
end up like him.

656
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,359
All alone.

657
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,640
It's impossible.
That would never happen.

658
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,711
Yeah, yeah.
That'll never happen.

659
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,518
Unless he puts us
in separate classes.

660
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,270
Which will never happen.

661
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,272
It'll never happen.
'Cause we control him now.

662
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,078
And if ever gives us
any trouble again,

663
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,872
all we gotta do
is snap our fingers...

664
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,439
and "Tra-la-laa!"

665
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,074
All of our problems go away.

666
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,032
Oh, yeah

667
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,553
Beautiful

668
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,710
Even more beautiful

669
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,720
Hey, Tommy. What's going on?

670
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,800
Hey, guys.

671
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,911
Whoa! Cool shirts!

672
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,758
What are you two
doing together?

673
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,799
I separated you.

674
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,760
No, you didn't.

675
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,949
What are you talking about?

676
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,429
I signed the paperwork. See?

677
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,520
I don't see a signature.

678
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,736
Harold, do you see
a signature?

679
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,239
Not a thing.

680
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,800
I actually can't see a thing.
These sunglasses are too dark.

681
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,309
What? I could have sworn
I signed that thing.

682
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,835
No matter. There!

683
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,592
Officially separated.

684
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,352
Forever.

685
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,272
What? Give me that.
Tra-la-laaa!

686
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,998
See? Problem solved.

687
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,032
Ooh!

688
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,432
Greetings, citizens!

689
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
Quick, in here.

690
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,075
Okay, you know what?

691
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,639
These shirts
were way premature.

692
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,119
Definitely. Come on.

693
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,416
Let's turn him back
into Krupp.

694
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,510
We can't. He'll separate us,
remember?

695
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,096
Yeah, well, we can't have him

696
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,553
wandering around
looking like that.

697
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,870
A triangle!

698
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,235
It dings!

699
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,754
Ah! Principal Krupp,
you caught us again.

700
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,638
You better take us
to your office

701
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,591
for a good old talking-to.

702
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,878
Right? Principal Krupp?

703
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,336
Principal who?

704
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,873
Captain Underpants,
get out here.

705
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,040
Sidekicks...

706
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,200
are you sure

707
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,038
my secret identity
requires these...

708
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,353
restricting,
uncomfortable clothes?

709
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,560
Yes, positive.

710
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,518
100% positive.
Now act like a principal.

711
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,715
Oh, right.

712
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,354
How does a principal act?

713
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
Mean!

714
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,555
Okey-doke.

715
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,519
I'm a principal!

716
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,040
Oh, yeah. That's great.

717
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,193
Come on. We're almost there.

718
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,836
Oh, hello. Surprise.

719
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,033
It's Edith.

720
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,191
Did you like
my tuna casserole?

721
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,677
I cannot lie.

722
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,394
I don't recall
having your tuna casserole.

723
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,357
What? Oh.

724
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,919
But if your casserole is

725
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,237
as striking
as your one blue eye...

726
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,359
Oh, I didn't think
you noticed.

727
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
Oh, my.

728
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,916
Two blue eyes.

729
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,877
Ooh!

730
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,392
Principal Krupp.
It's time to go.

731
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,709
Gotta wrap it up.

732
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,029
Very well then.

733
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,389
Up, up, and...

734
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,551
And this way, sir.

735
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,713
Ooh! Flirt alert.

736
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,233
A-ha!

737
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,839
Wow, she's still on hold.

738
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,232
Phew! We made it.

739
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,118
Well, hello, citizen.
What?

740
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,320
Oh, and hello to you, too.

741
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,431
I was just, like,
admiring the view...

742
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,238
from your broken window.

743
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,118
It's in the shape of a man.

744
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,480
Anyway, I am here to interview

745
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,113
for the science teacher
position.

746
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,633
Perfect. I'm disguised

747
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,193
as an elementary
school principal.

748
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,913
Guys, I totally got this.

749
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,593
Don't worry one bit.

750
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,074
Now, where did I put
that resume?

751
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,440
No, not that. Oh, this thing.

752
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,440
This one's fun.

753
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,794
Ooh!
Heads up.

754
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,399
That one's gonna leave a mark.

755
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,913
I've been looking for that.

756
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,120
Oh, not that.

757
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,789
Ah-ha! Here we go.

758
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,077
Hmm. Says here
you're a science teacher?

759
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,434
Not exactly.

760
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,591
But you have
teaching experience?

761
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,119
Oh, no, I can't say that I do.

762
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,391
Not even, like, babysitting?

763
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,788
I would never sit on a baby.

764
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
Camp counselor?

765
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,394
Never was a camp counselor.

766
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,079
Although
I did receive counseling...

767
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,471
for some trauma I experienced
as a child.

768
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,468
I'm getting a really good vibe
about you.

769
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,596
Now hold on.
Let me see that resume.

770
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,955
It says here that you were
a genius inventor?

771
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,314
Mad...

772
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,990
genius inventor.
But yes.

773
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,111
And then for
the last few years...

774
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,952
you've "been in
a very dark place"...

775
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,354
and your title was...

776
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,431
"Revenge Seeker?"

777
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,953
"Revenge at all costs...

778
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,120
"Die! Die!"

779
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Am I reading this right?

780
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,510
Yeah, that's basically
what I've been up to...

781
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,432
so here I am!

782
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,749
Applying for a job in

783
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,308
the thriving
public school system...

784
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,677
with all of
its amazing resources.

785
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,033
But honestly,
kids are so understanding.

786
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,792
So innocent.

787
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,952
Their smiles brighten my heart
and fill me with...

788
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,032
a joy-adjacent feeling.

789
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,509
As long
as they are controlled...

790
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,478
and do not laugh
nor smile nor play nor laugh.

791
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,198
Children must never laugh!

792
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,831
Well, you seem terrific!

793
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,149
You're hired!

794
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,878
What?
Excellent.

795
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,036
Oh, by the way,
going to need Fridays off...

796
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,077
and every other Tuesday
through Thursday...

797
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,514
for my evil experiments.

798
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,353
Hope that's not a problem.
Okay, bye-bye!

799
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,069
Oh, this is bad.

800
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,515
We just hired a maniac
for a science teacher!

801
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,035
Uh, yeah. We gotta fix this
before Krupp finds out.

802
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,317
Sounds like a job
for Captain Underpants.

803
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,710
No, no, no.
You need to stay here.

804
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,393
Okay, you're
the principal, remember?

805
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,875
Yeah, just sit there
and look angry for no reason.

806
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,190
You got it. Grr...

807
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,720
Ooh!

808
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,356
That will be interesting
to put my eye up to.

809
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,910
What?
How did I get here?

810
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,348
Why is my face wet?

811
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,714
Hiya, class.

812
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,233
I'm your cool, new teacher.

813
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,631
Not some scary guy
with a secret evil agenda.

814
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,188
Anyway, I'm just going to dive
right in here.

815
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,588
If there was one thing

816
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,320
about this world
that you could change...

817
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,760
what would it be?

818
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,751
Ooh! Ooh! Peace on Earth.

819
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,911
Unattainable. Anyone else?

820
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,432
Pacific Ocean into chocolate.

821
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,079
Atlantic into nacho cheese.

822
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,633
It's like
we're the same person

823
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,909
and yet so, so different.

824
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,758
I love it.

825
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,558
But more importantly...

826
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,110
if I had to change one thing
about the world...

827
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,955
it would be to get rid of...

828
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,120
laughter.

829
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,839
Get rid of laughter?

830
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,558
What kind of person
wants to do that?

831
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,680
Oh, oh! Ah! Ah! Sir, sir.

832
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,800
Yes?

833
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,880
I love it.

834
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,791
Oh, look at this.
We got a grade A suck-up.

835
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,837
Good to know, good to know.

836
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Anyway.

837
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,995
This is the brain
of an average child.

838
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,195
Right here is

839
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,276
the "thinking about candy"
lopalus.

840
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,476
The "fear of
what's under the bed" lobe.

841
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,154
This is the "only thing
I'll eat is pizza...

842
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,993
"chicken nuggets,
or buttered noodles" lobe.

843
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,758
Right here is the

844
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,671
"as soon as
someone else has a toy...

845
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,274
"I want that toy"
anterior lobe.

846
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,159
And this...

847
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,157
This is the
Hahaguffawchuckleamalus.

848
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,710
This funny little purple part

849
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,150
holds our entire capacity
for laughter.

850
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,709
For years,
I've tried to shrink it

851
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,796
or cut it out entirely...

852
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,432
but frustratingly,

853
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,512
our survival seems
dependent upon it.

854
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,795
I don't like this. I mean,
I don't really understand it.

855
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,200
But the stuff
I am understanding

856
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,514
seems genuinely bad to me.

857
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,874
Yeah, same.

858
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,952
Um... Excuse me, Professor P?

859
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,991
Why are you trying to
get rid of laughter?

860
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,519
Isn't laughter
the best medicine?

861
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,150
Medicine is the best medicine!
So...

862
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,475
Yeesh.

863
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,880
What?

864
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,080
What does the P stand for?

865
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,560
Excuse me?

866
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,870
The P. In your name.
What does it stand for?

867
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,519
Oh, it's private.

868
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,076
So that means your name is
Professor Privates?

869
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,713
What's so funny?

870
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,074
I don't get it.

871
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,595
Principal's office, now!

872
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,720
You too!

873
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,995
Why him?

874
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,594
Because your friendship
and shared sense of humor

875
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,869
irritates me...

876
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,235
and must be destroyed!

877
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,960
We gotta do something about
that new science teacher.

878
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,395
Yeah, it's like he's even more
of a villain than Krupp.

879
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,278
I didn't even think
that was possible.

880
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,936
Whoa! Whoa! Wait a second.
Tell me about it.

881
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,598
What? Who do you think...

882
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,600
Oh, okay. Maybe we could
fix this if we just...

883
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,280
Can you hear me?
No, that'll never work.

884
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,197
I'm sitting right here.

885
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,794
Wait, Professor P doesn't want
anybody to know his last name.

886
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,029
Right?
Right!

887
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,872
Who's Professor P?
Exactly!

888
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,749
Where is the respect?
I am your principal!

889
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,789
Wait, is he Krupp again?

890
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,791
George!
Yup. Pretty sure he is.

891
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,920
Harold!

892
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
How'd that even happen?

893
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,872
Tra-la-laaa!

894
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,077
Greetings!
I need to get the...

895
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,520
Sidekicks,
what do I need again?

896
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,875
The file
on the new science teacher.

897
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,960
Oh, right, right.

898
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,429
I need the bile
on the gooey fence creature.

899
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,794
Science teacher.

900
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,960
The dewy tense preacher?

901
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,277
The dial on the...

902
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,759
Oh, come on!

903
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,916
Thank you, human woman!

904
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,913
Sidekicks, explain to me

905
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,797
the importance
of this secret file.

906
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,320
There's a new
super villain in town

907
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,040
and we're trying to
discover his weakness.

908
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,120
Oh...

909
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,271
"Poopypants."

910
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,636
Hallelujah

911
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,597
Hallelujah

912
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,955
His name is Poopypants
We found his weakness

913
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,111
Hallelujah

914
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,996
He wants to rid the world

915
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,509
Of laughter

916
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,680
Forever

917
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,840
And ever

918
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,035
We will defeat him

919
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,476
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

920
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,154
Poopypants

921
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,833
Captain?
You forgetting something?

922
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,355
Oh, look at that.
They came off again.

923
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,554
Hey there, kiddo.

924
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,278
First day for Professor P.

925
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,391
Can you tell me where
the lunch is consumed?

926
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,553
What's going
on with your face?

927
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,720
Are you choking?

928
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,029
Do you need to sneeze?

929
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,833
I see, I see.

930
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,992
Got a case of
the giggles, huh? That's fun.

931
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,794
Well, I've got
just the remedy for that.

932
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,077
In the cage. Now!
Why?

933
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,832
Because I hate
laughter and children...

934
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,076
and I've got a cage
in a briefcase!

935
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,874
Okay, well, have a nice day.

936
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,871
Now what's for lunch?

937
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,715
Excuse me, could you explain
to me why this is funny?

938
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,711
You! Why is everyone laughing?

939
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,555
Uh, you're asking
the wrong dude.

940
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:56,753
"Captain Underpants
and the Perilous Plot of...

941
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,751
"Professor Poopypants."

942
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,176
Oh, What's happening?

943
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,918
I'm hyperventilating.

944
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,269
Esteemed members

945
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,436
of the Nobel
Prize Committee...

946
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,670
it is with great pride...

947
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,512
that I present to you...

948
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,389
the Sizerator 2000!

949
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,589
Ooh.
Oh.

950
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,712
Behold, we can smallify.

951
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,354
No more traffic jams.

952
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,750
And conversely, largify.

953
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,036
Look at how big
this hot dog is.

954
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,309
Going to need a lot of mustard
for this frankfurter!

955
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,629
The Nobel Peace Prize
in Inventing Stuff goes to...

956
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,075
um,

957
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,160
Professor...

958
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,118
Is that really your name?

959
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,396
It's not, like,
some kind of joke?

960
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,437
No. It's not, like, a joke.

961
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,433
It's a traditional name
in New Swissland.

962
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,076
Am I pronouncing it right?

963
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,151
Poopypants?

964
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,317
More or less. Except
the emphasis is on the "poop."

965
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,399
Why are you laughing?

966
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,478
I've invented a shrinking
and enlarging ray!

967
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,914
I should be famous!

968
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,470
I should be dating models
twice my size...

969
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,596
and doing
some talk show circuit!

970
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,149
I should be protecting
baby seals as a cause...

971
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,920
that I say I care about,
but not really!

972
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,150
This guy is too much!

973
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,993
Stop! Stop laughing!

974
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,195
No, stop it!
Okay.

975
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,352
Phew! Oh...

976
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,630
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

977
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,319
Here. Take the award.

978
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,438
It's really fun
to say Poopypants.

979
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,678
You keep your stupid award!
I don't want it anymore.

980
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,995
Oh, and one more thing...

981
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,430
On behalf
of the Nobel Prize committee,

982
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,112
please accept our apology.

983
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,999
And could you change me
back now please?

984
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,336
Why don't you go on and invent

985
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,032
your own shrinking
and enlarging ray...

986
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,470
if you think you're so smart?

987
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,675
How much of that was out loud?

988
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,354
Extra! Extra!
Get our latest issue!

989
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,353
Captain Underpants
and the Perilous Plot

990
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,471
of Professor Poopypants.

991
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,198
Oh, no.

992
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,234
There you are. I've been
looking all over for you.

993
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,394
Hmm. How many A's
are there in "Tra-la-laaa?"

994
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,556
What?
I'll just go with 11.

995
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,676
Enjoying your
first day, professor?

996
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,717
The complete
opposite, actually.

997
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,189
Look at what these
little monsters have created!

998
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,879
We must lock them up,
probably, like, forever!

999
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,080
Hmm.

1000
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,353
Oh, my.

1001
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,839
This is not a comic.

1002
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,516
This is a history book.

1003
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,715
What?

1004
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,035
And as such, it should be
taught in every classroom.

1005
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,553
And you yourself
must teach it...

1006
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,757
because that is
how good it is.

1007
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,360
I don't understand.
I thought, like,

1008
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,072
we'd be on the same page here.

1009
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,075
What page is that?
I'm on page 9, here.

1010
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,240
It's fantastic.

1011
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,400
Look, look.

1012
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,936
It's about
this evil science teacher...

1013
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,951
who looks a lot like you,
by the way.

1014
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,236
And he wanted to
rid the world of laughter...

1015
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,960
but he couldn't figure out
how to do it.

1016
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,835
Even worse, it seemed like
everywhere he went,

1017
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,876
people were having fun
and laughing.

1018
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,591
It just was infuriating.

1019
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,111
But then, he discovered
someone who wasn't.

1020
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,039
Why is it funny?

1021
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,795
Anti-Humor Boy!

1022
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,556
And then the professor says,
"Very interesting."

1023
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,399
That's my voice for him.

1024
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,471
Wait, wait, wait. Gimme that.

1025
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,756
That's no Anti-Humor Boy.

1026
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,589
That's the suck up from class.

1027
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,431
Very interesting.

1028
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,796
You boys
don't even realize it...

1029
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,679
but your silly comic book
just helped me figure out...

1030
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,957
how to wipe out laughter
on the... Oof!

1031
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,513
Out of the road, bozo!

1032
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,880
Hey, watch where you're going!

1033
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,632
You just hit
Professor Poopypants.

1034
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,438
Poopypants?

1035
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,112
That's not funny!
That's not funny!

1036
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,072
Ever heard
of the sidewalk?

1037
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,431
Oh, if I had insurance,
you'd be in... Ow!

1038
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,315
I'll admit that
was surprising.

1039
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,520
Wow.

1040
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,636
That actually
worked out for once.

1041
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,313
Good job, Captain Underpants.

1042
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,152
At your service, sidekicks.

1043
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,912
Now where was I?

1044
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,309
We should probably
get back to class, huh?

1045
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,311
Yeah, we probably should.

1046
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,776
Excuse me. Pardon me.
If you could just...

1047
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,840
Watch your feet.
Excuse me.

1048
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,279
Sorry. Thank you.
Oh, hey, Todd.

1049
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,278
Now, let me ask you something.

1050
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,670
If you could
control your principal...

1051
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,840
what would you do?

1052
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,719
Shh.
It's starting. It's starting.

1053
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,216
I just wanna
make sure you apply

1054
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,878
the extra credit
to next semester.

1055
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,230
I won't be needing it
this semester, of course.

1056
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,400
Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah.

1057
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,776
Whatever floats
your boat, Melvin.

1058
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,994
Excuse me?

1059
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,832
Can I please get
an ice cream sandwich?

1060
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,476
Yeah, scram, okay?
We're closed for Ebola.

1061
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,477
Okay, just a quick check

1062
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,152
to make sure
that we're connected.

1063
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,151
Mmm-hmm. Okay.
We're sure that's safe?

1064
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,913
And now,
some classic funny bloopers!

1065
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,355
Ah. That's a good one.
Oh, this one's my favorite.

1066
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,036
I'm sorry.
Why are you showing me this?

1067
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,360
Ow.

1068
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,759
Come on, that was funny!

1069
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,990
That child walked
right into that rake.

1070
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,079
I'm bored! What else is on?

1071
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,869
Fascinating.
Computer, scan.

1072
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,719
I don't believe it.

1073
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,920
You know, I suspected

1074
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,394
something smaller than normal,
but this...

1075
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,711
This.
What? What is it?

1076
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,117
I can't find it.
Your Hahaguffawchuckleamalus!

1077
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,589
You don't have one!

1078
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,232
I don't get it.
Exactly.

1079
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,791
You have no sense of humor
like a chair or a supermodel.

1080
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,589
Melvin, with your brain
and my brain together...

1081
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,115
we can finally
wipe out laughter

1082
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,395
for once and for all!

1083
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,110
So George and Harold
want a supervillain...

1084
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,632
well, ask
and ye shall receive!

1085
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,072
I hereby declare...

1086
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,310
the Jerome Horwitz
art program...

1087
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,478
reinstated!

1088
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,669
Oh...

1089
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,988
After you, sir.

1090
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,512
Ooh, what if we...
I'm already on it.

1091
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,159
Oh, this is gonna be epic!

1092
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,911
Come on, Captain, draw!

1093
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,195
Move your hand
in the shape of a person!

1094
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,157
Why does it look
like a chicken?

1095
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,436
This whole visual
storytelling thing is hard!

1096
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,520
Oh, that's good.

1097
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,033
Here, these need words.

1098
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,509
Hey, sidekicks...

1099
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,513
why are we doing this again?

1100
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,875
Well, we're making
school fun again.

1101
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,190
You know, "free the children."

1102
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,176
Hey, hey! What if we put
this panel right here?

1103
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,200
Oh, yes! Yes, yes.

1104
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,038
Ah, yes. Of course.

1105
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,360
Fun.

1106
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,555
On it!

1107
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,640
Ha-ha!

1108
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,480
Uh...

1109
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,033
Where'd everybody go?

1110
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,031
Where did this even come from?

1111
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,160
Hey!

1112
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,800
Oh, hey, sidekicks.
Glad you could join.

1113
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,074
How did you even do this?

1114
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,696
I thought you said
you were looking after the...

1115
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,176
Oh, my goodness!
Is that a Ferris wheel?

1116
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,553
Well, of course it is!

1117
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,710
It came
with the carnival I ordered.

1118
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,839
This cotton candy
makes me feel powerful!

1119
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,353
Hey, uh,
where are all the teachers?

1120
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,555
Detention.

1121
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,035
They have a real
attitude problem.

1122
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,231
Sure beats
having Krupp around!

1123
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,710
Oh, yeah. Krupp would totally
lose his mind if he saw this.

1124
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,393
Step right up!

1125
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,994
Who'll be the first
to dunk the principal?

1126
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,080
No!

1127
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,838
I'm drowning!

1128
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,440
Tra-la...

1129
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,056
All right, that's enough.
Recess is over.

1130
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,115
Ah, come on!

1131
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,240
Just one more ride!
Whoa!

1132
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,917
Hey, watch it!
What is this, a carnival?

1133
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,672
I hate carnivals!

1134
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,956
Oh, this looks fun!
How do we play?

1135
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,439
Hold your fire!

1136
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,960
What is happening?

1137
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,120
Who wants ice cream?

1138
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,599
Ice cream!

1139
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,840
What are we gonna do?
We can't keep this up forever.

1140
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,871
We have to! We'll just
take shifts watching him.

1141
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,360
I'll take today.
You take tonight.

1142
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,748
Sugar!

1143
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,960
Sugar!

1144
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,951
Harold, I really
want some sugar.

1145
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,394
Me too.

1146
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,473
We made the wrong choice!

1147
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,471
This did not solve anything!

1148
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,000
Hey, sidekicks!

1149
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,959
Check this out!

1150
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,757
Geronimo!

1151
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:49,920
No!

1152
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,153
This way!

1153
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,151
Field trip, anyone?

1154
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,235
No, no, no!

1155
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,315
Nothing's more fun than fire!

1156
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,993
Except being on...

1157
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,673
Fire!

1158
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,309
What is happening?

1159
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,511
Tra-la-laaaa!

1160
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,355
Now, this is
how you run a school!

1161
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,837
Free the children!

1162
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,640
Wait a minute.

1163
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,840
What the...

1164
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,829
How did this...

1165
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,159
I don't understand.

1166
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,198
Help!
What the...

1167
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,714
You...

1168
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,192
You two.

1169
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,192
Your friendship...

1170
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,839
is no more.

1171
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,080
What?

1172
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,400
George!

1173
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,755
Harold!

1174
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,429
Harold! Come back!

1175
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,751
George, I'm right here!
I'm right here!

1176
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,230
Oh, no! No, no!
Don't leave me!

1177
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,550
I won't! I won't, George!

1178
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,720
Harold!

1179
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,273
No, no! Wait, wait! Stop!

1180
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,069
George!

1181
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,073
This thing is amazing,
Professor P.

1182
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,315
You could probably solve

1183
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,040
world hunger
with an invention like this.

1184
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,879
Pass!
More importantly...

1185
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,752
how do I look?

1186
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,639
Just like you do
in this comic!

1187
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,791
Good! Now,
hands off the merchandise,

1188
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,831
and go fetch
your little toilet, okay?

1189
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,912
I call it "The Turbo..."

1190
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,435
Yeah, yeah. Couple of
gold stars for you, kiddo.

1191
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,993
Let the Poopageddon begin!

1192
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,837
Whoo-ee!

1193
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,158
What?
Oh, you've gotta be joking me!

1194
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,593
Poopypants has no gas!
You can't write this stuff.

1195
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,113
Where would
a burgeoning villain

1196
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,792
find unlimited power?

1197
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,679
True power comes from within.

1198
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,159
No, it doesn't, Melvin!

1199
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,320
That's on stupid posters!

1200
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,360
Okay.

1201
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,516
It comes
from enormous energy sources!

1202
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,868
A nuclear waste dump.

1203
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,040
I see where you're going.

1204
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,678
A poisonous chemical factory.

1205
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,475
Or perhaps
a place even more toxic!

1206
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,153
Whoo!
These leftovers got a kick.

1207
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,995
Oh, it's a powerful smell.

1208
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,519
Back in business, baby!

1209
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,713
Memorize these elements...

1210
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,996
Oxygen. Beryllium.

1211
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,031
Boringillium.

1212
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,713
Lameium.

1213
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,154
Snoronium.

1214
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,516
Excuse me, everybody,
there's a giant...

1215
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,216
Do not interrupt
while I'm reading

1216
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,878
monotone from my textbook!

1217
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,076
But the toilet!

1218
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,240
Ugh.

1219
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,197
Just go.

1220
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,600
Harold?

1221
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,440
George?

1222
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,431
Students and faculty

1223
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,552
of Jerome Horwitz
Elementary...

1224
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:00,114
the world, as you know it,
is about to go extinct.

1225
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:04,034
And a new world order
is about to rise!

1226
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,713
One that is,
you know, honestly

1227
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,472
pretty similar
to the old world order...

1228
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,950
except for one tiny detail...

1229
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,469
Melvin?

1230
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,278
Comin' atcha!

1231
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,795
Powered by
Melvin's unique neurology...

1232
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,112
I will successfully disable
the Hahaguffawchuckleamalus...

1233
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,273
of every single child at
Jerome Horwitz Elementary.

1234
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,149
For I, Professor Poopypants...

1235
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,592
Yeah, it's a funny name.

1236
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,631
It just makes you
laugh and laugh, right?

1237
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,320
Get down!

1238
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,830
Still give you
the chuckles now?

1239
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,393
Poopypants!

1240
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,999
I don't get it.

1241
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,229
Why is that funny?

1242
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,440
Perfect!

1243
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,512
Finally!
You're speaking my language!

1244
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,113
Oh, no. This is bad.

1245
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,435
This is seriously bad.

1246
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,590
I mean,
a world without laughter?

1247
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,400
George, if he destroys
our sense of humor,

1248
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,509
he destroys us!

1249
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,353
Imagine how boring
our comics will be.

1250
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,957
Captain Underpants
and the Purchase

1251
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,598
of the Sensible Beige Pants.

1252
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,992
Captain Underpants
Eats All of His Falafel.

1253
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,674
Captain Underpants
Watches Cement Dry.

1254
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,696
And would the creators of

1255
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,837
this absolutely
hilarious comic book...

1256
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,197
please come out, come out,
wherever you are!

1257
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,032
You're next.

1258
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,192
Okay, we have to stop him.

1259
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,198
We've gotta find a way
to unplug Melvin.

1260
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,400
Yeah.

1261
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,234
But how do we get to him
without Poopypants seeing us?

1262
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,471
What are you two
doing together?

1263
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,312
Are you in there?

1264
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,988
Oh...
Maybe you're hiding here.

1265
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,636
Oh, sorry.
Are you stuck on hold?

1266
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,760
Mmm-hmm.

1267
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,230
Oh, totally hate
when that happens.

1268
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,549
Well, good luck with that.

1269
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,478
Now, where are
those two little...

1270
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,750
Stand down, Poopypants!

1271
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,069
What is happening?

1272
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,753
I hope this works.

1273
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,433
Tra-la-laaa!

1274
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,675
Ow! Ow!

1275
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,856
Keep standing down.
I'm just gonna be a second.

1276
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,233
Ow.

1277
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,831
I bet he thought
that was going to be cooler.

1278
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,752
Oh, boy. Here goes nothing.

1279
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,029
Ha-ha!

1280
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,753
Prepare to be vanquished...

1281
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,273
and justice to be served

1282
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,039
on a piping hot
platter of freedom!

1283
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,758
With a side order
of liberty...

1284
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:36,629
and a super-sized cup
filled with freedom also!

1285
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,274
Impressive use
of fast-food analogies,

1286
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,595
you giant baby with a cape on!

1287
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,119
Let's do this.

1288
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,271
Freeze! The following sequence
contains scenes...

1289
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,776
that are so intense,
horrific, and violent...

1290
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,800
And expensive.

1291
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,136
...that we can only show it
using a technology known as...

1292
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,276
Flip-O-Rama!

1293
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,555
Take it away, Harold.

1294
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,216
Okay,
first Professor Poopypants

1295
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,416
gave Captain Underpants
the boot.

1296
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,714
Foot! Foot! Ow!

1297
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,536
Then he made
an Underpants sandwich.

1298
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,896
Punch, punch! Punch, punch!

1299
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,136
And then, they played
a friendly game of paddleball!

1300
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,912
Oh, no!

1301
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,080
Darn.

1302
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,071
Okay, what's next?
Oh, yes!

1303
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:30,073
Then, Poopypants summoned
an army of dolphins...

1304
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,296
Wait, what?
Why are you always

1305
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,576
sneaking dolphins
into the movie?

1306
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,896
What do you have
against dolphins anyway?

1307
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,216
I don't have nothing
against dolphins,

1308
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,976
- it just didn't happen!
- Well, so what?

1309
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,639
We get to say what happened.
It's the Flip-O-Rama.

1310
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,791
I like dolphins.
The dolphins are in.

1311
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,896
Fine, all right.
Let's just keep going.

1312
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,056
- You sure?
- Yep, positive.

1313
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,080
Thank you.

1314
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,496
- Anyway, Poopypants didn't realize it...
- Quiet five, quiet five.

1315
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,801
...but George and Harold's plan
was working out perfectly.

1316
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,896
So, they
shot themselves to the top

1317
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,353
of the Turbo Toilet 2000!

1318
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,829
To keep things dramatic,
they didn't quite make it.

1319
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,758
And then...
And then...

1320
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And then...

1321
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,598
What happened
to the Flip-O-Rama?

1322
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:02,875
I ran outta paper.

1323
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,716
Hey, Melvin!
Take that thing off your head.

1324
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:09,880
We gotta stop Poopypants!

1325
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,713
Professor Poopypants!

1326
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,030
George and Harold
are trying to stop you!

1327
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,112
You are just so annoying!

1328
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,272
So, you two
little numbskulls thought

1329
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,469
you could distract me...

1330
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,712
with this idiotic, naked man.
Am I right?

1331
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,836
I'm not naked!

1332
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,198
Any final words before this
whole revenge thing goes down?

1333
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,513
Yeah, wait, wait. Listen.

1334
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,069
We apologize
for making fun of your name.

1335
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,549
I mean, that was just wrong.

1336
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,554
Yeah, we're sorry.
The truth is, Professor P...

1337
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,073
you have probably, like,

1338
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,991
the greatest name
we've ever heard.

1339
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,520
I mean, George, imagine
if we had names like that.

1340
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,312
Oh, that would be so cool!

1341
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,072
Okay, wait, let's do it.
Let's try it.

1342
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,909
Oh, I would be
Fluffy Toiletnose.

1343
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:00,868
Yeah! I would be
Sir Cheeseball Wafflefanny.

1344
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,216
Yeah, sure. You're a knight.

1345
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,240
This is so good!

1346
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,760
I wanna change mine.

1347
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,275
I'd be
Buttcheeks von Stinkelsberg.

1348
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,668
Stinkelsberg.

1349
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,669
Yeah, those are all
really silly names,

1350
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,080
but there's
nothing funny about...

1351
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,839
Professor
Pee-Pee Diarrheastein

1352
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,354
Poopypants Esquire!

1353
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:24,755
Sir, are you saying
your full name is...

1354
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,794
Pee-Pee Diarrheastein
Poopypants Esquire?

1355
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:29,880
Uh-huh.

1356
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,393
Stop it! Stop laughing!

1357
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,357
Come on! Listen, your problem

1358
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,078
isn't that people
laugh at you.

1359
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,595
Your problem is that
you can't laugh at yourself.

1360
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,274
Oh, really, Oprah?
Is that my problem?

1361
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,596
Well, your problem is this...

1362
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,629
No!

1363
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,314
Oh, I hope
you enjoyed your years

1364
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,470
of laughter and merriment...

1365
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:04,269
because they're about
to come to an end.

1366
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,993
Do you find anything funny
about me now?

1367
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,234
You mean,
other than your name?

1368
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,951
Yes! Other than that!

1369
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,116
And your hair?

1370
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,200
What?

1371
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,838
My hair's cool, I thought.

1372
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,672
Are you kidding me?

1373
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,638
That's almost as funny as
my hair back in kindygarten!

1374
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,358
Remember that afro?

1375
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,591
No!
No, this can't be happening!

1376
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,671
Computer, activate brain scan.

1377
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:41,113
Let's see. The frontal lobes
look big and healthy.

1378
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,032
The Hahaguffawchuckleamalus

1379
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,839
looks all shrimpy,
so, what gives?

1380
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,520
It can't be!

1381
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,796
Their
Hahaguffawchuckleamaluses,

1382
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,359
they're enormous!

1383
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:54,995
I need more power.

1384
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,950
Anything strike you
as funny now?

1385
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:04,556
I'm sure
we can think of something!

1386
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:08,030
George, I can't smile anymore.

1387
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,838
No! Harold!

1388
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,952
One down, und one to go.

1389
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,154
Harold.

1390
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,030
Harold. Harold,
can you hear me?

1391
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,072
Harold!

1392
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,558
George! George, is that you?

1393
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,720
Right here, buddy.

1394
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,157
What's happening?
We're shrinking!

1395
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,736
Now, if we don't laugh
at something soon,

1396
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,909
we may never laugh again.

1397
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,196
Oh, no! What do we do?
What do we do? What do we do?

1398
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,396
Well, we have to think
of something funny, okay?

1399
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,511
Okay, yeah, sure.
Something funny.

1400
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:46,920
Anything?

1401
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,319
No, I got nothing.
Me neither.

1402
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,640
More shrinkage!

1403
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,594
Okay, okay.
What did we use to find funny?

1404
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,876
Mostly potty humor. Poop,
vomit, that kind of thing.

1405
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:58,874
Really? Ugh. That is, like,
the lowest form of comedy.

1406
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:01,838
Don't you say that, Harold!
Don't you leave me!

1407
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,176
Attention everyone!

1408
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,112
Poopypants here with a little
update on the Poopageddon.

1409
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,590
Due to the success
of my plan thus far...

1410
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,591
I've decided
to wipe out laughter

1411
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,432
on the entire planet.

1412
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,352
After that, you know,
I'll probably

1413
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,520
move on to other planets...

1414
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,600
Jupiter, Mars...

1415
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,518
can't forget Uranus!

1416
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,112
Wait. Did he just say...

1417
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,111
Your anus.

1418
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,280
I know!

1419
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:36,560
Uranus!

1420
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,438
Yeah, and once I'm through
with the gas giants...

1421
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,556
I figure I'll go
after the other galaxies...

1422
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,755
What?

1423
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,558
It feels so good to laugh!

1424
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:54,832
No, stop it! Stop laughing!
You're ruining everything!

1425
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,560
Yikes!
Extra credit or survival?

1426
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,159
Extra credit or survival?

1427
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,151
I choose survival!

1428
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:13,840
Uh-oh!

1429
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,829
Oh, yeah!

1430
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:34,880
Wow!

1431
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:41,151
No, how could this
be happening?

1432
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,355
Never underestimate

1433
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,510
the power of laughter,
Poopypants!

1434
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,790
Oh, that's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1435
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,880
Oh!

1436
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,153
Ah! Whoa!

1437
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,550
Harold! Harold, we did it!

1438
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,400
Harold?

1439
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:09,954
I think I bruised a rib.

1440
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,991
Because I've never laughed
so hard in my life!

1441
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,998
Oh, we'll see who's laughing
once I shrink you down...

1442
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,196
where you will live
in my pocket forever...

1443
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,590
amongst my
cherry-flavored lip balm...

1444
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,711
my butterscotch-flavored
lip balm...

1445
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,800
Oh, neato!

1446
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,711
...my mint-flavored
lip balm...

1447
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,031
my extra-moisturized
SPF lip balm...

1448
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,919
and all of my lip balms!

1449
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,552
Why does one person have
so much lip balm?

1450
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:40,720
Help!
Help!

1451
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,671
Please, anyone! Help!

1452
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,439
Help!

1453
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,631
Ooh, I hope you can find
tiny enough pens...

1454
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,870
to make your small,
little comic books with...

1455
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,031
'cause you're about to
get smallified!

1456
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,876
Tra-la-laa!

1457
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,632
I feel...

1458
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,669
awesome!

1459
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:15,875
No way!

1460
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,439
He has real superpowers!

1461
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,473
Oh, that is an obvious twist
that I did not see coming...

1462
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,596
despite my many years
of comic book studies!

1463
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,433
I have come to save the day!

1464
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,749
Yay!

1465
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,319
Yeah, and I've come
to ruin it!

1466
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,760
So back off, buddy!

1467
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,520
Ha-ha!

1468
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:34,999
Ew, that's gross!

1469
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,718
Oh, there's more
where that came from.

1470
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:39,480
Monday! Tuesday!
Wednesday! Thursday!

1471
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,353
Ha-ha! Unlimited underpants!

1472
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,398
I am so glad that we gave him
that superpower!

1473
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,028
My Sizerator!

1474
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,920
Well, it's mine now!

1475
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,151
Alas!

1476
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:57,472
The final failure
for Professor Poopypants.

1477
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,153
Hmm. What does this button do?

1478
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,236
Oh...

1479
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,396
Well, hello down there!

1480
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:06,560
No!

1481
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,840
Must be holding it backwards.

1482
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,079
Yup. That was it.

1483
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,077
Wow. He is super dumb.

1484
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,834
I can't reach.

1485
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,395
Time to take you down
once and for all, Poopypants!

1486
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,198
Buzz off!

1487
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,235
Captain Underpants!

1488
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,080
Fly over here
so we can make you big again!

1489
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,309
Crackerjack idea.

1490
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,200
George, just don't...

1491
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,390
No!

1492
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,600
Ha-ha!

1493
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,916
Give him a big hand
for that one, everybody!

1494
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,594
Get him.

1495
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:41,755
Whoops.

1496
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,037
Look what I've got.

1497
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:45,994
A tiny school

1498
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,640
filled with tiny children...

1499
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,555
and their tiny teachers
whose tiny salaries...

1500
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,756
reflect their size and also...

1501
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,718
the value society puts
on education.

1502
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,588
I'll take that!

1503
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,591
Oh! Then I'll take that!

1504
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,119
Ow! Did you just slap me?

1505
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,032
Yes, I did.
And you deserved it.

1506
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,839
No, I didn't! Your hand
is huge! That hurt a lot!

1507
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,149
Give it back, it's mine!

1508
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,389
No! Hands off!

1509
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,232
No fair! No backsies!
Give it to me!

1510
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,674
Would you just give me that?

1511
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,359
Now look
what you've done!

1512
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,520
Give it!

1513
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,438
George!

1514
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,080
Gotcha!

1515
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,392
Yeah, that's more like it!

1516
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,154
Nice work, sidekicks!

1517
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,958
I'll just put this back down
right here.

1518
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,400
No, no, no!
Captain Underpants...

1519
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,391
There we go. Back to normal...

1520
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,959
like it never happened.

1521
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,277
Oh, no, where'd he go?

1522
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:51,998
You'll never catch me!

1523
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,310
You can't stop
Professor Poopypants!

1524
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,353
Get back here!
I can't reach!

1525
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:57,920
Get him, Captain Underpants!

1526
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,951
A bee!
Get away from me!

1527
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,236
I'm free!

1528
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,640
What? What the...
Why would you do that?

1529
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,512
You just let
the bad guy get away!

1530
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:11,877
Come on, guys. Pretty sure
the bee wasn't the bad guy.

1531
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:18,279
What the heck happened here?

1532
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,560
You're welcome, peace keeper!

1533
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,159
Would you keep it down?

1534
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:34,909
Did not see that coming!
Take that, Doctor Diaper!

1535
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,113
I can't believe we made him.

1536
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,350
And he's even dumber
in real life.

1537
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,429
Oh! Look! Little dolphins!

1538
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,437
We have to get rid of him,
don't we?

1539
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,999
I think we do.

1540
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,479
I mean,
he's a way bigger problem

1541
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,879
than Mr. Krupp ever was.

1542
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,031
But, you know, George...

1543
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,509
bringing back Krupp
permanently...

1544
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,788
we'll never be
in the same class again.

1545
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,149
Yeah, I know.

1546
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,548
But just 'cause we're
in separate classes,

1547
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,232
doesn't mean
we can't be friends...

1548
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,755
Well, yeah. I mean, we'll
always be friends. Right?

1549
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,354
Yeah. Hey, in fact,
you know what?

1550
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,595
Let's do a blood oath.

1551
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,016
But minus the blood. I don't
wanna see the blood. No blood.

1552
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,075
Pinky swear?

1553
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,240
No, that's lame. Mmm-mmm.

1554
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,318
Oh, got it!

1555
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,073
Oh, no. What? No!

1556
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,514
That's not sanitary.

1557
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,477
Can't we just do
a verbal declaration

1558
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,754
of friendship or something?

1559
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,393
Oh. Okay. Yeah, wow.

1560
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,119
I haven't really
prepared anything, but...

1561
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,118
I, Harold...

1562
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,759
hereby declare George

1563
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,469
as my best friend,
permanently, forever.

1564
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,632
And I, George, accept
the permanent rights...

1565
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,068
that Harold has given me

1566
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:54,071
to be
his best friend forever...

1567
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,708
and the constitution
of friends...

1568
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:57,880
America, friendship.

1569
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,256
And the United States
of America.

1570
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,776
- Land and the United States.
- Good, okay, yeah.

1571
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,080
- It's done. All right, cool.
- Phew.

1572
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,958
What a relief.
Yeah, no kidding.

1573
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,480
I mean,
why were we even worried...

1574
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,670
about that whole classroom
thing in the first place?

1575
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:08,840
You know, I don't know.

1576
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,274
We were younger then.

1577
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,629
Clearly, we have grown.

1578
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:12,800
Clearly, we have.

1579
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,160
Chums!

1580
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,395
Thank you for chronicling

1581
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,755
my surprisingly
grounded biography.

1582
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,514
The truth is a slippery thing.

1583
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:21,908
That you nailed it.

1584
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:26,350
Now it is time to fly again!

1585
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,397
Farewell, my dear sidekicks.

1586
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,118
Goodbye, Captain Underpants.

1587
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,349
Goodbye.

1588
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,679
George! Harold!

1589
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,416
What am I doing in your
tree house again?

1590
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,952
You boys are in big trouble!

1591
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,753
I don't know how big yet...

1592
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,360
Why does this
keep happening?

1593
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,231
Where are my clothes?
Where are they?

1594
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:05,949
I don't get it.

1595
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,229
Why is Krupp so angry

1596
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,231
and Captain Underpants
so happy?

1597
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:13,359
Maybe it's because
Captain Underpants had us.

1598
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,034
You know, he had friends.

1599
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,552
We could fix that.

1600
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:22,433
Yeah, you know, we could.

1601
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:24,913
So that's how we came

1602
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,479
to pull the rarest prank
of all...

1603
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,233
The prank...

1604
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,039
for good.

1605
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,240
Huh?

1606
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,436
"Do you want to go a date?"

1607
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,235
A date?

1608
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,394
"Love, Edith."

1609
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:43,754
"Principal Krupp."

1610
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:44,960
Oh!

1611
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:49,114
Benjamin Krupp, you sly dog.

1612
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,998
Edith, the lunch lady.

1613
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,479
Big plans tonight, Mr. Krupp?

1614
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:57,552
No! What?
That's none of your business!

1615
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,957
But, if you must know...

1616
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,839
yeah, I actually do.

1617
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,038
By the way,
I was tidying up my office...

1618
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,430
and I believe
these belong to you...

1619
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:10,675
Our comics?

1620
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,200
Did you just pull that out
of the garbage can?

1621
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,838
Well, I read them...

1622
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,016
and considering
they're completely

1623
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,075
implausible, juvenile...

1624
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,196
and filled with
the lowest form of wit...

1625
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,719
potty humor...

1626
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,598
they're actually pretty funny.

1627
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,393
See ya later!

1628
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,276
Well, how about that...

1629
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:47,952
That's a good one.

1630
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,794
You know, it feels good to do
something nice for Mr. Krupp.

1631
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,791
Yeah, you know what? It does.

1632
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:53,976
Promise we'll never
do it again.

1633
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,035
Promise.

1634
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,120
Oh, my!

1635
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:57,515
I've never been to

1636
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,318
such a fancy restaurant
before.

1637
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,917
Well, I had to go all out
for m'lady.

1638
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:08,152
Okay, if you say so,
my man!

1639
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,795
Once again,
that brings our story

1640
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,199
to its happy conclusion.

1641
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,480
I think there's some valuable
life lessons in there...

1642
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,520
somewhere.

1643
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,600
What the?

1644
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,159
Eat 'em up, yum, yum!

1645
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:23,278
You gotta be kidding me! No!

1646
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,317
Yum, yum! Eat 'em up!

1647
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:26,754
Oh, no!

1648
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,073
Waiter! Check please!

1649
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,592
Principal Krupp!

1650
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:39,760
Oh, no!

1651
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,354
Help!

1652
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,080
Hang on, sidekicks!

1653
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,280
I don't get it!

1654
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,958
I really thought
breaking that ring

1655
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:49,678
would get rid of his powers!

1656
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,632
Yeah, well, here we go again!

1657
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,671
Tra-la-laa!

1658
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,995
Are you worried
about impending doom?

1659
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,714
Those evil villains
got you filled with gloom

1660
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:20,032
But don't you fear,
there's a hero in the sky

1661
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,037
The sky, the sky

1662
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:23,909
It's not a bird

1663
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,399
And it's not a plane

1664
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,514
And it's not
an egg salad sandwich

1665
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,831
It's the waistband warrior

1666
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,791
Hear his mighty battle cry!

1667
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,393
Tra-la-laa!

1668
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,033
Hey, watch out, crime!

1669
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,793
It's wedgie-power time

1670
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:40,920
Na, na, na, na, na

1671
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,235
Captain Underpants
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1672
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,630
Faster than
a speeding waistband!

1673
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,712
He's bustin' down doors

1674
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:51,518
While wearing
just his drawers

1675
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:52,680
Na, na, na, na, na

1676
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,711
Captain Underpants
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1677
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,711
More powerful
than boxer shorts.

1678
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:57,800
His name is

1679
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,552
Under, Under, Underpants

1680
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:00,680
I'm sayin'

1681
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,472
Under, Under, Underpants

1682
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,039
Oh, yeah,
by some unlikely chance

1683
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,720
Captain Underpants
is his name

1684
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,876
Tra-la-laa!

1685
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,468
Snap your fingers
and he'll be right there

1686
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:14,028
That freaky, bald dude
in his underwear

1687
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:17,670
He'll drop those trousers and
he'll fight to save the day

1688
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,392
The day, the day

1689
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,988
Oh, there he goes
in his dashing cape

1690
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,080
Here he comes
in his tighty-whities

1691
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,311
All the bad guys
soil themselves

1692
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,311
Every time they hear him say

1693
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,833
Tra-la-laa!

1694
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,832
Hey, who's that hunk?

1695
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,318
Is that cotton pre-shrunk?

1696
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,400
Na, na, na, na, na

1697
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,835
Captain Underpants
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1698
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,751
It's time to fly again!

1699
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:45,991
Suspend your disbelief

1700
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,911
He'll save the world
in his briefs

1701
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:49,910
Na, na, na, na, na

1702
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,275
Captain Underpants
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1703
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,873
To the sky!

1704
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,160
Under, Under, Underpants

1705
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:58,200
I'm sayin'

1706
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:00,032
Under, Under, Underpants

1707
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,519
Check out
that superhero stance

1708
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,830
Captain Underpants is his name

1709
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,757
Stand down, Poopypants!

1710
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:06,880
Oh...

1711
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,518
Under, Under, Underpants

1712
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,600
He's Captain

1713
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,512
Under, Under, Underpants

1714
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,953
Yeah, by some
crazy circumstance

1715
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,349
Captain Underpants
is his name

1716
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,635
Tra-tra-tra... Tra-la-laa!

1717
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:20,109
Under, Under, Underpants

1718
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,632
Under, Under, Underpants

1719
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,280
Wait.

1720
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,440
No way!

1721
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,836
She's been on hold for,
like, the whole movie.

1722
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:36,633
Come on, come on.

1723
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:38,555
Hello.

1724
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,472
Thank you for holding.
How can I help...

1725
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,030
No!

1726
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,756
Right from the start
couldn't pull us apart

1727
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:53,840
It just works

1728
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,832
Nobody else ever
gets me as well on this earth

1729
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,832
Like Rock and Roll
My shows and tellies

1730
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,520
Mac and cheese
PBs and jellies

1731
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:08,232
Some things
are better together

1732
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,759
And that's you and me

1733
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,748
Dude, I love you
Bro, I love you

1734
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,910
Man, I love you

1735
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,194
You're my brother from another

1736
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:21,311
Another mother

1737
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,593
You are my favorite

1738
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:27,274
I'm not ashamed to admit

1739
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,749
'Cause I do
Dude, I do

1740
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:32,599
Dude, I love you
Bro, I love you

1741
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,796
Man, I love you

1742
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,588
You're my homie

1743
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:40,030
No one knows me
Like you know me

1744
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,360
Like the sun and the moon

1745
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,874
All the best things
come in twos

1746
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,959
What would I do
without a friend like you?

1747
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,473
What, what, what, what

1748
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,312
What would I do?
What would I do?

1749
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,231
Without a friend like you

1750
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,793
What, what, what, what

1751
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,791
What would I do?
What would I do?

1752
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,233
Without a friend like you

1753
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:03,392
Laugh till we cry when we're
passing the time away

1754
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,990
Even our fights always end
with a smile on our face

1755
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:13,552
Like black and white keys
On a Wurli

1756
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:16,399
Sounds just right
and work in harmony

1757
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:17,999
Some things
are better together

1758
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,479
And that's you and me

1759
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,674
Dude, I love you
Bro, I love you

1760
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,751
Man, I love you

1761
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,999
You're my brother from another

1762
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,196
Another mother

1763
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:34,433
You are my favorite

1764
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:37,080
I'm not ashamed to admit

1765
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,754
'Cause I do
Dude, I do

1766
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,434
Dude, I love you
Bro, I love you

1767
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,516
Man, I love you

1768
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,428
You're my homie

1769
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:49,751
No one knows me
like you know me

1770
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:53,193
Like the sun and the moon

1771
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,669
All the best things
Come in twos

1772
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:59,429
What would I do
without a friend like you?

1773
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:01,039
What, what, what, what

1774
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,190
What would I do?
What would I do?

Without a friend like you

1780
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:18,759
With... With...
Without a friend like you

1781
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:22,155
What would I do?

1782
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,631
Without a friend like you

1783
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:32,557
With... With...

Dude, I love you

1785
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,311
Man, I love you

1792
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,991
Man, I love you

1793
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,989
Got my back
I got your back

1794
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,958
Like chiropractors

1795
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:05,713
Like the sun and the moon

1796
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,155
All the best things
come in twos

1797
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:12,074
What would I do
without a friend like you?

1798
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,434
What, what, what, what

1799
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,715
What would I do?
What would I do?

1800
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:17,597
Without a friend like you

1801
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:18,829
What, what, what, what

1802
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:21,070
What would I do?
What would I do?

1803
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,276
Without a friend like you

1804
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:24,480
Give me a beat.

1805
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:26,954
Saturday, Saturday...

1806
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:30,355
I love Saturday

1807
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:34,471
Where everything is possible

1808
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,955
Nothing stands in our way

1809
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:41,034
Don't have to be responsible

1810
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:43,999
Everywhere we go

1811
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:47,159
Nobody says, "No"

1812
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:50,357
Yeah, finally we're free

1813
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,793
We got nowhere we need to be

1814
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,639
On Saturday, Saturday

1815
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:00,836
The sun has shined
on us, hey, hey, hey, hey

1816
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:03,275
I think it's time for a break

1817
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:07,356
We'll get away
Get away, eh, eh, eh...

1818
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:10,750
We can go
coloring the world together

1819
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,792
We can make a story
that'll last forever

1820
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:17,270
On Saturday,
Saturday, eh, eh, eh

1821
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,072
Hey...

1822
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:23,110
The perfect day

1823
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,878
The perfect day

1824
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:33,760
Saturday

1825
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,354
There's one day every week

1826
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:40,118
No alarm's gonna wake me up

1827
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,789
Stay in bed and sleep

1828
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:46,791
Or maybe watch TV too much

1829
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:50,231
Lazing all day long

1830
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:53,198
No one says it's wrong

1831
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,999
No, finally we're free

1832
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,638
We got nowhere we need to be

1833
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,559
On Saturday, Saturday

1834
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:06,551
The sun has shined
on us, hey, hey, hey, hey

1835
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:09,074
I think it's time for a break

1836
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:13,310
We'll get away
Get away, eh, eh, eh

1837
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:16,512
We can go
coloring the world together

1838
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:19,513
We can make a story
that'll last forever

1839
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:23,076
On Saturday,
Saturday, eh, eh, eh

1840
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:25,037
Hey...

1841
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,592
The perfect day

1842
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,638
On Saturday

1843
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:43,237
Take your bag
and leave your house

1844
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,271
Don't need no TV
to be entertained

1845
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,554
We are the show

1846
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,677
Come now and play it subtle
Bring back all that we know

1847
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,356
Our songs the only thing
that's playing on the radio

1848
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:59,315
On Saturday, Saturday

1849
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,557
The sun has shined
on us, hey, hey, hey, hey

1850
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,995
I think it's time for a break

1851
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,275
We'll get away, get away

1852
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:11,557
The perfect day

1853
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,316
The perfect day

1854
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,870
We got nowhere we need to be

1855
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:24,918
On Saturday, Saturday
