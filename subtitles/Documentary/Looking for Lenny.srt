How about this scene?

8
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,207
Let's get ready for the next angle.

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,123
-Okay!

How's it director?

11
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,650
Brother Jacky, well done.

12
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,963
You can go and rest awhile.

13
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,789
Okay! Good job.

14
00:03:01,242 --> 00:03:01,584
Master.

15
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,876
How is it?

16
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,564
You drink You drink.

17
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,400
-Well done.
-Well done.

18
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,084
-You drink.
-I still have.

19
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,029
Don't worry. I still have mine.

20
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,806
Good bye! Good bye!
Well done everyone!

21
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,797
Big brother, well done.

22
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,565
Everyone well done.

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,330
Good bye, big brother.

24
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:13,970
Bye! Bye!

25
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,140
Everyone well done.
Thank you!

26
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,766
It's fine. Don't worry.
Bye, big brother.

27
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,324
Not bad,

28
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,205
There's some minor details that
you need to pay attention.

29
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:23,890
Okay.

30
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,642
The next scene will be this.

31
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,322
Everyone pay attention.

32
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,210
We're filming the next scene.

33
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,124
Where's the disciple?

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,968
The next scene will be brother Jacky
taking in a disciple.

35
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,242
Quick! Where's the disciple?

36
00:03:36,443 --> 00:03:37,243
Where's the disciple?

37
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,566
Before I can complete my boxing routine,

38
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,009
Suddenly a person grab hold of me.

39
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,844
Telling me,

40
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,922
You are the one,

41
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,368
that I've been searching so hard
for to train as a gifted boxer.

42
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,961
Quickly becomes my inner circle disciple.

43
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,322
The next scene will be Jacky Chan
selecting a disciple.

44
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,166
Where's the selected Jacky Chan disciple?

45
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,242
Who is the one supposed to act?

46
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,488
The Jacky Chan disciple.

47
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,450
Me! Me! Me!

48
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,281
The one chosen yesterday.

49
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,363
Who's the one?

50
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:04,964
To be Jacky Chan disciple.

51
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,403
Don't push. Don't push.

52
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,164
Don't push!

53
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,164
Wake up!

54
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,124
Granny!

55
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,284
I was dreaming about Jacky Chan.

56
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,609
Let me have another
minute to finish my dream.

57
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,400
My young master,
you're already awake.

58
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,886
Going back to sleep also you 
won't be able to see him.

59
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,564
Quickly get up.

60
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:27,883
Faster.

61
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,642
Today is the last day of schooling.

62
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,564
After school today the report
card will be released.

63
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,848
Next new semester you'll
be a secondary student.

64
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,487
How can you still be so confusing.

65
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,649
Let me sleep awhile more.

66
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,606
In a blink you're already
16 years old.

67
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,081
Why're you like a child being
so sleepy head.

68
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,641
C'mon. Do it on your own.
Fix it yourself.

69
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,960
Get up quick.
I'm making breakfast.

70
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,206
Granny, how come it's
oatmeal porridge again.

71
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,722
Listen to granny.

72
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,087
Oatmeal porridge is staple diet.

73
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,929
It's nourishing.

74
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,204
Yeah, granny.

75
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,764
During the New Year can I not
go to grandmother's house?

76
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,849
Being disciplined strictly by your
grandmother is for your benefit.

77
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,730
Who asked you to fail in
your Mandarin test.

78
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,925
Peking is too cold.

79
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,410
Let me tell you, even if you
refused you too must go.

80
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,721
Your mum has already book the

81
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,762
airline ticket for tomorrow.

82
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,883
Well, I' not going.

83
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,962
Granny,I'm not going.
I'm not going.

84
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,845
My name is Cheong Yat-San.
I'm born in Peking.

85
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,605
When I was 10 years old,
I followed my parents,

86
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,126
to this beautiful South
East country.

87
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,528
South East Asia,

88
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,969
I'm studying at International school,

89
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,042
a Form 3 student.

Stop!

Master. one more time.
Master. one more time!

120
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,044
Okay, Let me tell you all

121
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,243
this is a reward.

122
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,441
Cheong Yat-San, come out.

123
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,570
Me?

124
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,727
Come, let's try.

125
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,408
Young kid, you show a lot
of improvement.

126
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,241
Not at all.

127
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,563
Ear! Ear! Ear!

128
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,290
Master Kam is looking for you
earlier on.

129
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,487
I heard that your Mandarin result
is not so satisfactory.

130
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,130
Go! Master Kam is looking for you.

131
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,648
There's a brook in front of my home.

132
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,249
I need to cross the brook everyday to
go to the city for martial arts practise.

133
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,130
Everyday! Everyday.

134
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,169
My biggest ambition is

135
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,084
to see Jacky Chan everyday.

136
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,771
"Knife point!" ( Word should mean saw him)

137
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,484
"Knife point." (Saw him actually)

138
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,921
Saw "knife point"

139
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,649
What are you doing?

140
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,247
Are you laughing at me?

141
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,528
Do you know who I am?

142
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,801
Who are you?

143
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,127
I'm Jacky Chan's disciple.

144
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,967
Apologize to me quick.

145
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:14,764
I'll not!

146
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,168
Apologize to me!

147
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,802
Classmate Cheong Yat-San.

148
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,448
Master Kam, how're you?

149
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,004
Go for your lesson.

150
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,803
Those classmates

151
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,969
humiliated you in front of everyone
should be faulted.

152
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,282
Classmate Cheong Yat-San

153
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,121
How do you want me to
describe you as a teacher.

154
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,249
You only got a C in your objectives test.

155
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,650
There's only 1 page for composition.

156
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,725
The grammar is so embarassing.

157
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,286
Not proficient and multiple mistakes
plus incomprehensive meaning.

158
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,001
Teacher, what are you saying
that I'm not answering?

159
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,282
Wrongful meaning to your sentences.

160
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,481
Meaning your grammar

161
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,045
can't capture the essence of the words.

162
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,760
Cheong Yat-San

163
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,526
You're a International School student,

164
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,611
You must be proficient in Mandarin.

165
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,931
I believe there's no meaning in
learning proper Mandarin language.

166
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,086
I want to be like my hero Jacky Chan.

167
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:11,684
Famous throughout.

168
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,968
I really don't understand.

169
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,929
I fail in Mandarin test

170
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,802
because of a few wrong grammars.

171
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,528
I can understand Master Kam
grabbing hold of me but

172
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,564
the classmates are also against me.

173
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,969
One day when I find Jacky Chan

174
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,048
learn true martial arts,

175
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,731
I will teach them a good lesson.

176
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,250
Cheong Yat-San!
Cheong Sup-San (Meaning 13)

177
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,760
Cheong Sup-San! Cheong Sup-San

178
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,200
Who're you calling San? Soo Lee-Yuk

179
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,123
Calling you!

180
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,527
Getting 13 points and failing.
How about it?

181
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,727
Getting 13 points and failing.

182
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,806
-Who're you saying about?
-Talking about you.

183
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,251
You talking about me.
Damn you!

184
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,491
Cheong Yat-San, why're you
hitting people? Attack!

185
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,410
Attack!

186
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,405
Don't run. Hold still!

187
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,650
Don't beat!

188
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,569
Let's see wether you give up or not.

189
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,407
I didn't insist

190
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,082
I heard that

191
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,084
Master Jacky fight since as a child.

192
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,925
You dare to mention it.

193
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,565
Always Jacky Chan, Jacky Chan!

194
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,370
Look at your Mandarin.

195
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,165
Always failing in exams.

196
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,720
How embarassing!

197
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,046
I have decided

198
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,687
to follow Master Jacky Chan to
learn martial arts.

199
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,246
Then follow by learning Mandarin.

200
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,401
Don't blame your granny ignorance.

201
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,450
Your parents

202
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,450
care only in their research and
doctorate

203
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,126
Never at home.

204
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,847
Let your grandmother teach you.

205
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,565
You refused  to go to Peking.

206
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,650
I'm at a lost for idea.

207
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,288
I'll have to get a refund for the
ticket tomorrow.

208
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,731
What's this?

209
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,043
Granny, Jacky Chan is shooting in Peking.

210
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,447
I  look thru Jiapu.com

211
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,043
Instantly I found the family
surname Yuen lineage.

212
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,001
I've decided

213
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,567
I need to change to be Yuen
family descendants.

214
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,800
After that, I'll look up Jacky Chan
in Peking.

215
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,966
Allowed our Immigration
to conduct searches.

216
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,088
Please open your back pack.

217
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,410
Remember, don't buy counterfeit.

218
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,760
Respect the copyright act and
follow the laws.

219
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,929
Wishing you all an enjoyable visit
to China.

220
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:54,565
Thank you!

221
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,887
Hey kid, you've not
say where you want to go.

222
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,648
Yeah...almost forget.

223
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,122
Go to this place.

224
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,925
You can't look at this.

225
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,325
Using a mobile phone while
driving is illegal

226
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,244
You just need to tell me

227
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,441
Ching Sek Temple.

228
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,682
No! No!

229
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,842
There's no place by that name.

230
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,961
I think you want to go to
Ching Sek Sanctuary.

231
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,930
It must be that place.

232
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,764
Ching Sek Sanctuary?

233
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,450
Correct!

234
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,090
Let's go there.

235
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,242
Okay, let's go.

236
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,044
How far is Ching Sek Sanctuary?
Outskirt?

237
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,682
Let's go!

238
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,484
Okay!

239
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,170
Ching Sek Sanctuary

240
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,723
Let me tell you,

241
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,890
you worried about Yat-San
not coming...

242
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,528
when Yat-San is here, you
disciplined him.

243
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,444
He's just a kid.

244
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,848
You can't be too strict with him.

245
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,247
Can't be too strict.

246
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,681
Am I that strict?

247
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,765
I just asked him to

248
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,771
jog for an hour and draw for 2 hours.

249
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,850
Playing the piano for 3 hours.

250
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,451
4 hours of revision.

251
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,564
Don't let him muck about with you.

252
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,362
What's wrong with that?

253
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,809
What's wrong with that?

254
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,929
Our grandson...

255
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,561
is a simpleton.

256
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,764
How can he be someone in the future?

257
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,043
How to be successful?

258
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,562
I'll answer the phone.

259
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,887
How're you.

260
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,129
In-laws.

261
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,322
In-laws...

262
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,328
have Yat-San arrived yet?

263
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,887
What? Yat-San is in Peking?

264
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,402
Is he alone?

265
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,165
Hello? hello, in-laws

266
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,043
How're you.

267
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,482
Have Yat-San arrived yet?

268
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,366
What? Yat-San doesn't want to
come to Peking.

269
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,849
What? Haven't arrived?
How can that be.

270
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,970
He's taken the 9 am flight

271
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,241
It's almost dark.
He should be arriving soon.

272
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,330
Hey, what're you doing?

273
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,962
Talking about you

274
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,603
Are you just looking around or
come to pray?

275
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,690
If you need to pray it'll have
to be tomorrow morning.

276
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,043
If you want to sight seeing,
$20 please.

277
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,809
I didn't come for prayer or visit,

278
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,486
Then what are you doing here?

279
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,882
Let me ask you something

280
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,523
Look here.

281
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,891
Is it this place?

282
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,766
That is Tham Sek temple.

283
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,409
Here is Ching Sek Sanctuary.
There's a lot of difference.

284
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,007
Let me have a look up there.

285
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:52,724
You can't go up.

286
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,690
Let me go up and have look!

287
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,206
You can't come in.

288
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,487
You rascal.

289
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,801
Don't you know about rules?

290
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,689
Unreasonable!

291
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,762
Ill manners

292
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,246
You want to go in?

293
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,124
You've to ask me first and wether
I agree to it.

294
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,447
You can't go in.

295
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,728
Let me go in.

296
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,490
Let me in! Let me in!

297
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,883
Useless

298
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,442
Who's useless?

299
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,929
Master, he's attempting to break in.

300
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,285
I'm not. She's just accusing me.

301
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,806
You... kid,

302
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,881
not here for sight seeing
neither for prayer

303
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,929
What're you here for?

304
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,884
I'm looking for Master Jacky Chan.

305
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,687
Kid, martial arts weakness
can be learn,

306
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,207
bad manners

307
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,011
will lead you to learn nothing.

308
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,362
At such a young age

309
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,926
you should learn about manners.

310
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,811
You resemble a ruffian hero.

311
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,361
Even if Jacky Chan is here
he wouldn't accept you.

312
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,925
Chi-Ha, let's go.

313
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,122
Master say

314
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,289
it's cold out here so she
allowed you to come in.

315
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,730
Master say to give you more blankets.

316
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,530
Why're you sulking?

317
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,166
It's ugly.

318
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,131
Actually you're quite nice looking

319
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,566
especially your eyes.

320
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,685
Can you talk about other things?

321
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,969
I say your eyes is nice looking.

322
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,241
You can't say that.

323
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,687
Say Say Say Say Say

324
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,204
You can't say that.

325
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,362
-Say Say
-Don't say Don't say

326
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,046
Okay Okay
Stop it.

327
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,491
What's with your teeth?

328
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,001
My teeth?

329
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,048
Eating bun!

330
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,644
Little rascal!

331
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,364
Eat bun Eat bun

332
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,004
You imp!

333
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,247
Stop that! It's itchy.

334
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,170
You imp You imp

335
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,003
Eat bun

336
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,206
Let go!

337
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:57,850
You let go.

338
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,124
You let go first

339
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,569
You release first

340
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:01,810
I'm not releasing.

341
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,408
Then I'll not release too.

342
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,600
We're both twisted

343
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,241
Who's afraid of who.

344
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,642
Are you releasing or not?

345
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,247
Let's release together.

346
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,281
1, 2, 3 Let go.

347
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,491
Let me asked you a question

348
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,769
More simply,

349
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,283
When I arrived at the temple

350
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,285
you were returning from outside.

351
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,246
Why weren't you guarding
the main entrance?

352
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,404
Have you gone out to play?

353
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,163
None of your concern.

354
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,725
Okay, I'm a busybody.

355
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,369
Which house does your master stay in?

356
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,001
I'm going to tell her.

357
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,327
You didn't guard the main
entrance properly today.

358
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,965
You went off to play.

359
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,326
Priest Priest Priest

360
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,842
I want to let her know.

361
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,409
There's a phrase of the holy
scripture that I don't understand.

362
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,568
I need your guidance.

363
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,567
Master, I've already explained to him.

364
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,961
Chi-Ha, go to bed early.

365
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,325
What were you doing in the afternoon?

366
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,046
You want to know?

367
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,443
Tomorrow morning follow me up
the hill outback.

368
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,563
Crazy. It'll be too cold.

369
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,849
Don't you want to look for Jacky Chan?

370
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,083
Don't regret it if you don't go.

371
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,325
Master Jacky Chan is outback
up the hill.

372
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,161
Let's go.

373
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,725
Faster faster or it'll be too late.

374
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,209
Quick!

375
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,288
Fast fast fast fast

376
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,691
Don't move! Hold still!

377
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,404
Hey kid, what're you doing here?

378
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,083
Are you Master Jacky Chan brothers?

379
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,168
Are you from the Yuen descendants?

380
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,840
I've saw you in Jiapu before.

381
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,327
In Jacky Chan lineage there's your photo.

382
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,409
Please tell me where's Master Jacky Chan.

383
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,442
I want to meet him.

384
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,562
Director!

385
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,966
Why don't you put on some makeup
before coming on the set?

386
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:57,963
This little kid...

387
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,406
is he a fan follower or an actor?

388
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,129
It's unbearable.

389
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:15,923
Yeah...

390
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,650
is your master training in a
secluded area?

391
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,120
She will not come out if there's
nothing happening?

392
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,363
What about it?

393
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,329
How about like this,

394
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,004
You...

395
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,202
go about your acting,

396
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,407
while I guard the main gate for you.

397
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,523
Can you do it?

398
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,804
Definitely can!

399
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,249
But you've to agree on one condition,

400
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,730
I want you to enquire from Master Yee

401
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,724
where is Master Jacky Chan now?

402
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,448
Straighten. Eyes front.

403
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,645
Head, okay!

404
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,680
It's a wrapped.

405
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,529
Returned the props please.

406
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,402
Hurry up!

407
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,327
Let's eat.

408
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:41,770
Brothers, quick.

409
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,084
Well done Well done

410
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,404
Everyone did a good job today.

411
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,240
Returned the props at the back.

412
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,960
Master Yee Master Yee

413
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,600
Wait awhile, Master Yee

414
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,683
This kid is really...

415
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,002
Are you hurt?

416
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,043
Get up Get up

417
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,288
Master Yee,

418
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,607
What's the matter?

419
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,207
Can I take a photo with you?

420
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,323
Ok!

421
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,641
No problem.

422
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,609
That's too good.

423
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,046
Little miss,

424
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,169
you acted quite well today.

425
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,202
Really?

426
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,647
Little rascal, you're being lazy again?

427
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,003
Who is lazy?

428
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,561
It's just too cold,

429
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,086
would anyone be coming to
sight seeing?

430
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,123
What're you doing then?

431
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,448
I'm just covering myself. It's cold.

432
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,522
How is it?

433
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,120
How did the filming go?

434
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,162
Let me show you a photo.

435
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,885
Yeah, have you asked him already?

436
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,968
Where is Master Jacky Chan?

437
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,449
Did you ask?

438
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,200
I was too excited.

439
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,050
I forgot to.

440
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,285
Please stop crying.

441
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,682
Don't be like this. Nothing'll happen.

442
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,088
I was at fault.

443
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,049
You've been working so hard
guarding the main gate for me.

444
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,125
And I have forgotten what
I'm supposed to do for you.

445
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,243
Forgotten, so let it be.

446
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,166
Worst come to worst,
I'll look for him myself.

447
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,642
I don't believe I can't find him.

448
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,722
I'm so stubborn.

449
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,171
Stumbling my way, I managed
to gate crash into this temple.

450
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,125
Before I take leave,

451
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,049
I only realised,

452
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,561
that Chi-Ha is a theater troupe disciple.

453
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,247
She is only on holiday observing
the life style here.

454
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,524
From the outlook she seems aloof,

455
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,842
but she has the kind heartedness
of the caretaker

456
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,167
who by the way is her aunt.

457
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,965
They're very kind to me.

458
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,250
I can't wait here any longer.

459
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,721
I have a more important
mission that I must attend to.

460
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,446
That is finding Jacky Chan.

461
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,809
Hey, rushing to buy ticket.

462
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,649
2 tickets.

463
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,722
Is it for this afternoon ride at 5 pm?

464
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,683
Yes!

465
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,521
1 ticket to TungChow.

466
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,961
Thank you! I...

467
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,127
Queue up over there.

468
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,202
Immediate, please immediate.

469
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:39,804
Faster please.

470
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,002
I want to go there.

471
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,690
Where do you want to go?

472
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,964
Where is this temple?

473
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,323
Our temples for tourist is numerous.

474
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,965
Which one do you want to go to?

475
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,970
That's the one.

476
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,081
Here!

477
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,048
It's Tam Sek temple.

478
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,250
Eighteen soft and fifteen hard currency.

479
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,402
There should be no mistake this time.

480
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,323
Okay!

481
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:10,969
Where's my wallet?

482
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,448
Cigarettes, Melon Seeds and
Chewing gums!

483
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,451
Cigarettes! You want to buy a
pack, handsome?

484
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,444
I don't smoke.

485
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,841
A youngster and not smoking.
Good Good

486
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,610
Chewing gum for a dollar.

487
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,209
I don't eat.

488
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:03,889
It cost a dollar and fifty outside.

489
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,364
I don't want to buy.

490
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,609
Your wallet is missing.

491
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,527
What do you mean?

492
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,641
There's an alley behind the station.

493
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,808
You 'll find an empty well.

494
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,281
Wait for me there in an hour.

495
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,008
Cigarettes! Melon seeds!

496
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,329
I can't take the time
off as business is brisk.

497
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,766
Can you manage it?

498
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,480
I'm falling asleep already.

499
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,281
Come!

500
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,208
Let me tell you...

501
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,931
the money in the wallet,

502
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,486
will be gone.

503
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,923
You most probably will recovered
your IDs and bank card.

504
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,802
Why do you want to help me?

505
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,403
It's because you're handsome.

506
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,807
Can you really help me to
recovered my things?

507
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,451
If you can't, I'll just leave.

508
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,769
If you don't believe me,
you can leave then.

509
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,081
Don't you regret.

510
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,808
Stop kidding.

511
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,809
Judging from your face, you most
probably will not be able to find it.

512
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,843
I'm leaving.

513
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,169
Sister Yung!

514
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,288
How're you, sister Yung?

515
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,646
Give me back the wallet.

516
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,687
Are you hungry?
Let's go and eat something.

517
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,764
What? You're worried
that I'll harm you.

518
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,001
What's your name?

519
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,043
Cheong Yat-San.

520
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,448
How old are you?

521
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:53,804
Sixteen!

522
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,968
Did baldie took your wallet earlier on?

523
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,447
Why don't you knock before entering?

524
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,643
Brother Hung, why are you back already?

525
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,161
Take a look at him.
Does he resemble Little Chuen?

526
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,289
Why did you beat her?

527
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,163
Release me.

528
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,887
Brother Hung, he's just a kid.
Let him go.

529
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,363
Give it to me.

530
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,001
What is this?
These are...

531
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,361
Damn rascal.

532
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,682
I heard that you're Jacky Chan disciple.

533
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,926
The movie star Jacky Chan,

534
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,729
He's quite wealthy.

535
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,162
Are you Yat-San? What!

536
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,448
Listen to me.

537
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,041
Listen clearly, Two hundred
thousand and not a bit less.

538
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,800
You, you..what do you mean?

539
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,681
I'll killed him if you report to
the police.

540
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,325
What do you mean?

541
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,929
Enough! Enough!

542
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,368
Come! Get up.

543
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,242
You're not hurt?

544
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,403
I'm alright.

545
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,005
Listen here,

546
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,210
the skill you possesed as a
policeman is not enough.

547
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:48,644
It's not enough.

548
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,206
You need to use your brain,
you know.

549
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,288
Captain, rest assured.

550
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,851
We'll tried our best.

551
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,526
Listen, 200 thousand in cash.

552
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,763
Put it at the train station hall.

553
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,849
Placed it in the dustbin near
the noodle restaurant.

554
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,641
Or else I'll killed him.

555
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,202
In my judgement,

556
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,561
he's not a professional kidnapper.

557
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,687
We'll make the arrest ourselves.

558
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,682
We don't need to inform special forces.

559
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,802
Get a few men on the scene.

560
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,888
Okay. Use your judgement.

561
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,283
Changed into plain clothes.

562
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:25,970
Okay!

563
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,691
Take care of the granny.

564
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,767
Thank you! Thank you!

565
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,283
Don't struggle anymore.
You can't escape.

566
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,923
I'm not struggling.The legs
of the chair is broken.

567
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,528
I hope that you're not
angry with me.

568
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,521
It's all because of my younger brother.

569
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,886
He's older than you slightly.

570
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,486
He look quite like you.

571
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,808
When I saw you today,

572
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,361
it reminded me of him.

573
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,881
Then you can go and search for him.

574
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,643
Last month, my brother and
brother Hung went to rob a train.

575
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,284
He felled down on the track.

576
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:40,443
The reason why I've brought you here,

577
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,764
is to dine with you.

578
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,129
Do you've his photo?

579
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,561
He's name Little Chuen and
older than you by a few years.

580
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,326
These past few years,

581
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,002
for the sake of my
younger brother,

582
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,290
please forgive me!

583
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,930
How nice it would be to
have a sister like you.

584
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,802
I'm a lone child.

585
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,405
That's why I was constantly
being bullied.

586
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,363
I came back to Peking to avoid
being harassed.

587
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,281
I want to be Jacky Chan disciple.

588
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,529
After learning martial arts,

589
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,165
I want to defeat,

590
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,481
all those guys who bullied me.

591
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,727
Have you ever given thought,

592
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,649
after defeating all those guys,

593
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,567
what does it all means?

594
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,527
I've been long waiting for you.

595
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,563
Who're you?

596
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,324
Where do you want to escape?

597
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,324
Brother Hung Brother Hung
Run!

598
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,447
Brother Hung!

599
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,567
Brother Hung, are you hurt?

600
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,403
Go away!

601
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,049
You crazy, picking up things.

602
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,563
Brother Hung, what's happened?

603
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,169
What's the matter?

604
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,526
The police knew.

605
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,086
Pack up and run.

606
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:12,884
Faster!

607
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,163
Where's the guy?

608
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,887
You betrayed me?

609
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,571
Brother Hung, it's for your own good.

610
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,450
Let's all surrender.

611
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,249
Stop beating!

612
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,570
You stopped beating him.

613
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,284
I didn't hear it.

614
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:27,969
Sister Yung!

615
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:28,969
Baldie!

616
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,167
Watch where you're going.

617
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,207
You also didn't see me.

618
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,766
You rascal, get away from me.

619
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,081
I'm on duty doing official business.

620
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,642
Don't block me from calling the police.

621
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:00,649
What did you say?

622
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,324
Reporting to the police for what?
I'm the police.

623
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,087
You're the police?
I'm the hostage.

624
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,484
What're you joking about, kid?

625
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,686
Hey! Hold still.

626
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,288
Police!

627
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,124
Don't move.

628
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,727
Just like that, Sister Yung have been
detained at the police station.

629
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,890
I think she's quite pitiful.

630
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,122
I want to beg leniency from
the police.

631
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,482
Just let it be.
Released her.

632
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,166
Madam Policewoman,
please released her.

633
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,726
She didn't do me any harm.

634
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,730
She's pitiful.
Just release her.

635
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,568
Okay, don't you worry.

636
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,683
Let me send you home.

637
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,366
I can't go back yet.

638
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,569
I'm searching for Master Jacky Chan so
that I can learn martial arts from him.

639
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,082
Learning martial arts?

640
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,367
Yeah, that's my ambition for
coming to Peking.

641
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,443
To learn martial arts from
Master Jacky Chan.

642
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,291
I'll returned home and
maintain the safety there.

643
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,890
Wait for me!
Don't move away.

644
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:23,803
I'll send you home immediately.

645
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,123
Hey, what're you doing?

646
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,766
Hey! I asked you to wait for
me and you're running about.

647
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:02,848
I don't want to go home.

648
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:03,570
Why?

649
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,842
I just don't want to go home.

650
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,166
My grandmother like to
control me, why should I go home.

651
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,601
You're just a young kid.
She should look after you.

652
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,887
I'm not going home.

653
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,087
Come! Return home.

654
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,242
You just speak to your
grandmother regarding all matters.

655
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,289
I don't want to go home. I want
to look for Master Jacky Chan.

656
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,129
Why don't you stop dreaming.

657
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,521
Even if you found Jacky Chan,

658
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,408
he'll not care about you.

659
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,971
Says who? I don't believe.

660
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,368
Why is this child like that.

661
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,730
Why keep dragging your feet.
Get down from the car.

662
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,850
Okay! Stay at my place then.

663
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,764
Your grandfather will pick you
up tomorrow.

664
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,047
Really can't tolerate you.

665
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,961
Come in!

666
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,369
The toilet is in front.
The lock is broken.

667
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,886
Remember to knock on the
door when going to the toilet.

668
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,447
You can sleep on the sofa.

669
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:09,762
I'll send you home tomorrow.

670
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,762
Just for one night.

671
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,641
This water cup is mine.

672
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,443
You can't use this.

673
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,602
Ther's another new one inside.

674
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,924
Take off your dirty clothings.
It's smelly.

675
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:32,643
Take off already?

676
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,771
Then my butt will be exposed.

677
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,448
What if the butt is exposed?

678
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,529
I've seen a lot of child's butt.

679
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,927
Hey!

680
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,924
I don't want to wear
woman clothing.

681
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,164
Nonsense. It's belong to my husband.

682
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,524
How's your grandmother?

683
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,881
Don't you want to see her?

684
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,441
My grandmother is a busybody.

685
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,569
She wants me to jog an hour everyday.

686
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,682
Two hours for drawing.

687
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,245
Piano lesson for 3 hours.

688
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,402
The most horrible is...

689
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,961
4 hours of revision.

690
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,129
<i>International film star Jacky Chan,</i>

691
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,930
<i>will auction all his old clothings with
the proceed given to the disaster area.</i>

692
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,121
<i>Since winter is coming,</i>

693
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,044
<i>the thicker clothings are
required to prevent the cold.</i>

694
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,924
<i>Reknowned film star Jacky Chan
tomorrow,</i>

695
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,770
<i>will chaired the charity auction.</i>

696
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:32,802
<i>All charity raised from the auction,</i>

697
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,246
<i>will be given to the children
orphaned by the disaster.</i>

698
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,367
<i>Monies raised will be used to
purchase blankets and clothings.</i>

699
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,641
Even if you found
the real Jacky Chan,

700
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,842
will you be able to learn martial arts?

701
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,730
Let me tell you,

702
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,450
cinematic martial arts are all fake.

703
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,285
It's only make believe.
Nice to see but not practical.

704
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,442
That's not true.

705
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,842
Master Jacky Chan martial arts is real.

706
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,486
I've seen TV programme,

707
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,562
the programme mentioned,

708
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,165
actor's filming martial arts scene,

709
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:56,889
normally used a double.

710
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,248
Only Master Jacky Chan don't
use a double.

711
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,521
He performed his own stunts.

712
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,921
He has numerous wounds on his body.

713
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:02,923
Do you know?

714
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,042
What does that amount to?

715
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,527
If he met a bad guy with gun
and knife,

716
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,841
it's of no use.

717
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,486
You're useful, is that okay?

718
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,242
In actual Master Jacky Chan,

719
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,562
has beaten many baddies with
gun and knife.

720
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,446
What about you?
Have you caught any baddies?

721
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,171
If you're so capable go
and catch one now.

722
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,526
Catch me a thief.

723
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,683
It maybe, if you saw the thief,

724
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,767
you'll be in trouble.

725
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,925
Kid, let me tell you,

726
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:27,809
don't blabber away.

727
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,280
I've caught many thieves before.

728
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,248
You didn't see it only.

729
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,720
Bullshit! Who doesn't know how to.

730
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,126
You...

731
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,203
only know how to bully young
kid like me.

732
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,084
She man!

733
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:37,370
She man!

734
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:41,770
Just you say one more time.

735
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:46,889
She man!

736
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:13,764
Huh!

737
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,645
Ran away?

738
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,160
Okay Okay! I'll be there.

739
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,927
I just received info that
brother Hung ran away.

740
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,442
I need to go on duty.

741
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,091
You stayed at home.

742
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,806
I'll be back soon.
Don't you wander about.

743
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:32,683
I'll send you back to your
grandmother place.

744
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:54,571
It's good that she finally leave.

745
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,047
I need to get away from
here as soon as possible.

746
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,723
The TV programme mentioned
what mall again?

747
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:00,889
Go and look for Jacky Chan!

748
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,286
But my clothings,

749
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,721
is being soak in the washing machine.

750
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,130
Hey! I got it.

751
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,042
Is this that area?

752
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,762
Must be. Come heer!

753
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,683
Young rascal. Come here!

754
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,769
Can you please tell us how to
go here?

755
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,684
Let me have a look.

756
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,046
This is what area?

757
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,650
That's why we are asking you.

758
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,887
This must be what area?

759
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,766
This is written by my grand-daughter.

760
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,644
I don't know this.

761
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,562
This here...

762
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,924
area where about is it?

763
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,968
This I think...

764
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,004
You young rascal of a police

765
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,767
No matter how I look at it

766
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,048
your uniform seems to be on
loan from someone.

767
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,361
How old are you this year?

768
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,641
I'm 16 years old.

769
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,083
Already 18 years old.

770
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,530
That's mean to say,

771
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,649
the policeman nowadays

772
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,120
must be university graduate.

773
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,329
That must be. What's
wrong with you then.

774
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,567
Granny, let me have a look.

775
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,950
This is Ka-Hon area.

776
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,650
-Correct! This is the area.
-Correct.

777
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:26,722
-Correct.
-It's just in front there.

778
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,767
Thank you. That's just too good.

779
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,889
Young rascal!
Learn proper Mandarin.

780
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:36,404
Ka-Hon area!

781
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:38,444
Hey!

782
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,686
I've a name and it's not hey.

783
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,521
Fine. What time is Jacky Chan coming?

784
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,369
What's your concern?

785
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,721
I want to meet him.

786
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,609
I want to be his disciple.

787
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,961
Are you a policeman?

788
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:02,924
Hold still!

789
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,688
You hold still!

790
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,606
Sister, someone help!

791
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,048
Help!

792
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:16,930
Someone help!

793
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,566
Help!

794
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,809
Jacky Chan Jacky Chan Jacky Chan!

795
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,081
Quickly!
Be careful.

796
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,043
-Don't worry!
-Thank you!

797
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,442
Aiyah!
Easy! Easy!

798
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,841
Be careful!

799
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:21,449
Stop in front for a while.

800
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,850
Sister! You must be strong.

801
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,047
Be careful abit!

802
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,765
Auntie! Auntie!
Slower.

803
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,047
Auntie, I beg of you.

804
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:28,928
You must save her.

805
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,844
Stop in front for awhile.
Slower!

806
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,570
Thank you. Be careful!
Save her, auntie.

807
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,802
Sister! Sister!
Please wake up.

808
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,167
How're you?
How's her condition?

809
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,401
This is our captain.

810
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,641
-How're you?
-How're you?

811
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,250
-Thank you!
-Don't mention it.

812
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,283
Doctor, how's her condition?

813
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,960
He's the one who save her.

814
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:12,644
Yes Yes Yes!

815
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,604
How come he still look like a child?

816
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,171
Don't be funny?
How's her condition?

817
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,091
She's lucky she arrived here quickly,

818
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,685
after our emergency treatment,

819
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,251
she's out of danger.

820
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,851
Can she be discharged?

821
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,407
Not right now.

822
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,841
She 's got a head concussion.

823
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,161
Furthermore she has 2 broken ribs.

824
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,562
She needs to be hospitalized.

825
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:29,682
Further observation and treatment
are required.

826
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,764
Let me take a look then.

827
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,411
This child is so anxious.

828
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:34,762
You can't see her now.

829
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,247
What she needs now is quiet
and rest.

830
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,847
Nothing will happened.
Rest assured!

831
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,645
Aiyah! Where're you going?
Don't run.

832
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,926
Never thought after all the hardship,

833
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,729
almost meeting Master Jacky Chan,

834
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:28,120
I just managed to
catch only a glance.

835
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,368
Can't say that I regretted,

836
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,810
for I did managed to rescued
another hero.

837
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,087
The same night,

838
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,767
a police patrol car send me
back to my grandmother house.

839
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,283
Peking night scene is really beautiful.

840
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,489
To me, I don't appreciate it at all.

841
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,609
My heart still linger on

842
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,564
at the police woman in the hospital.

843
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:15,768
<i>Greeting's friends!
Everyone fine.</i>

844
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:16,882
<i>Thank you for watching China
News report.</i>

845
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:17,570

<i>is officailly concluded.</i>

857
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,402
Grandpa, where is this place?

858
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,409
Where is this?

859
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,087
Both of you are looking for who?

860
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,527
We want to look for Jacky Chan.
Is he in there?

861
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,245
How do you know that
Jacky Chan is here?

862
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,005
We just come here and tried
our luck.

863
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,163
Yes! Yes!

864
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,768
The news now is difficult to hide
from people.

865
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,606
You see, Jacky Chan arrived yesterday
and I was the one who received him.

866
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,080
Today, the whole world already
knows about it.

867
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,970
It's true.
It's true!

868
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,168
At least we didn't come in vain.

869
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,562
Can you let us go in?

870
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,848
Where do we buy the tickets?
Where?

871
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,241
This is not a tourist
attraction, furthermore...

872
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,289
In that case why not let
my young grandson in?

873
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,528
Him having a look will not
cause you to lose anything.

874
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,000
Correct!
Correct!

875
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,566
But people wanting to
meet Jacky Chan is a lot.

876
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,164
No! They're a lot of children
wanting to meet Jacky Chan.

877
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,322
If everyone is allow in
then it'll be a havoc.

878
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,562
Granny, let me speak for myself.

879
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,966
Okay! Let me tell you,

880
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,009
You're really enthusiatic about movies.

881
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:44,764
You must love movies.

882
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,206
Let me figure out a way for you.

883
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,249
Do you know where's the
Northern theatre?

884
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,800
Over there, they're hiring actors.

885
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,809
You can get in thru there.

886
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,246
You can applied at Fei Tang
but it's far from here.

887
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,521
You can mix in as an actor.

888
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:55,488
Then you can be here acting.

889
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,682
Is it?

890
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,570
Yes. I'm willing to be an
actor just to meet him

891
01:02:58,840 --> 01:02:59,841
Finally, I too was transfer here.

892
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,844
Stable income and get to
meet film stars everyday.

893
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:02,804
Is that true?

894
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,241
True! Why should I bluff you?

895
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:04,724
You see!
Here!

896
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:05,961
Isn't that Jacky Chan?

897
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:06,650
Is it?

898
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:07,210
That's right!

899
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,571
This is when I was receiving
Jacky Chan yesterday.

900
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,249
This is his autograph.

901
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,322
I even managed to shake hand
with him.

902
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,561
Let me tell you.
This is Johnny Woo.

903
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:12,926
Red Cliff!
Big production.

904
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:14,168
All of them mega production.

905
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,927
What're they acting in?

906
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,570
Sitting over here...

907
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,568
The actress name is Wang Hei-Foong.

908
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:31,483
Next to her is Yew-Mui!

909
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:32,727
Why is she called Yew-Mui?

910
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:33,643
Because her father surname is Yew.

911
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:34,529
It's not a stage name.

912
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,086
The one sitting there is Pak-Ping.

913
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,322
She is acting as Suet Pow-Chai!

914
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,328
She's so fair that

915
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,322
I can tell her apart with just one look.

916
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,971
The one on the far side I couldn't
see her clearly.

917
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,286
Because the car passed too quickly.

918
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,082
That one is acting over the stage
there in the movie "Red Dream".

919
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,562
The director of that movie is
Lee Siew-Hong, he's a friend of mine.

920
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:49,483
Everyday I received him.

921
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:50,841
They're just finishing work.

922
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:51,769
Having dinner over there.

923
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,684
They travelled by car early
in the day and not walking.

924
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,571
The area is too big.
Just too big.

925
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:57,409
Then...

926
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,488
Are there having a fight
scene with Jacky Chan?

927
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:00,807
What're you saying?

928
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,884
Can Lam Tai-Yuk have a
fight scene with Jacky Chan?

929
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:04,288
Exactly! How to fight?

930
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:04,930
Not even a match.

931
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,526
Her health actually
is not that good.

932
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:07,528
Can you hear that?

933
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,006
You don't even know about the
movie "Red Dream."

934
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,043
-You have to really learn.
-Yes Yes Yes

935
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,611
Based on what you don't know

936
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:13,801
how can you integrate into
the society?

937
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,644
If you get to meet Master Jacky Chan,

938
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,564
he also wouldn't like it.

939
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:18,961
Just look at yourself in the future.

940
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,481
Granny, can you stop nagging?

941
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,369
So troublesome!

942
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,051
Haven't I told you already,

943
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,203
I've a mouth. I know how to ask.

944
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:27,720
I've legs. I'll go find him myself.

945
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,086
Can you please not nag me?

946
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,202
Don't keep on following me.

947
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,083
Little San!

948
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:34,688
How can you speak to
your granny in such a way?

949
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,124
You can't do that.

950
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,322
This child...

951
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,927
Actually I felt bad too.

952
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:00,968
I know,

953
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,326
the way I speak to granny is wrong.

954
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,250
However there're no alternatives.

955
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,449
My heart is not with me.

956
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,051
It has gone...

957
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,561
to that place the guard was
talking about.

958
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,160
Gone to...

959
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,966
the place where there are a lot of
Wang Po-Keong.

960
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,408
I decided to look for him there.

961
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:19,722
I believe,

962
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,570
I'll be able to find my master,

963
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:22,684
Jacky Chan!

964
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,200
Famed director Ha Tai-Tong is
starting a new movie.

965
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,971
Every actor's will get 60.

966
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,645
Those who are willing please register.

967
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,965
Our casts will be lead by Yang Sui-Fa.

968
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,361
Actor's fees will be 80 a day.

969
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,441
I'll come! I'll come! I'll come!

970
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,610
Next film will be Jacky Chan
looking for a disciple.

971
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,409
Start shooting immediately.

972
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,370
From the selection yesterday,
who is Jacky Chan disciple?

973
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:39,524
You then.

974
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,368
And you and you.
The three of you.

975
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:46,004
Let's go!

976
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:04,330
Is it ready?

977
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:05,721
It's ready but there are no props yet.

978
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:06,762
Why is it not ready yet?

979
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:07,523
Faster Faster Faster!

980
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,528
Actors Actors Actors!

981
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,562
Quick get in position.
In position!

982
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:12,446
His make-up, disciple.
Is your make-up ready?

983
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:13,889
Quick Quick Quick!

984
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:14,808
We're starting filming.

985
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,282
Director, I'm ready here.

986
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,563
Chin higher, higher.

987
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,771
Quick disciple.
Come up!

988
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:30,122
Act properly.

989
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:31,729
Okay, let's start rolling.

990
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,049
Okay, ready!

991
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,961
Let's roll, 1, 2, 3.

992
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,282
How's it?

993
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:00,049
That was marvelous! Marvelous!

994
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,731
Next scene then!

995
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,724
Sister escaped later on...

996
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,406
Please get brother Jacky Chan.

997
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,208
This scene involved Jacky Chan
leg shot.

998
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:09,170
Move sideway!

999
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:10,803
Okay!

1000
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,565
After that the 3 guys fall face
flat on the ground.

1001
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,081
Hey you three, you three.

1002
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,404
Lie down on the ground
and don't move. Play dead.

1003
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,571
Act as a corpse?

1004
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,528
I won't get to meet Master
Jacky Chan then.

1005
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,525
Stop talking. Act properly.

1006
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,969
Little Kan Little Kan Little Kan!

1007
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:36,327
Little Kan Little Kan Little Kan!

1008
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,681
Little Kan!

1009
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,731
Stop!

1010
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,047
What's the matter with the kid?

1011
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,485
What's up! What's up!

1012
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,085
Such a long frame and disrupt
by you.

1013
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,321
Didn't I tell you already,

1014
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,403
You're dead. Lie down
and close your eyes.

1015
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,484
I want to meet Jacky Chan.

1016
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:57,529
Jacky Chan!

1017
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,404
You think you can meet
Jacky Chan just like that?

1018
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,842
This is a studio not a place
for chasing after a star.

1019
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:05,044
Changed to another kid.

1020
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,281
No need to film from
the front, just the back.

1021
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:06,889
Director! Director!

1022
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,724
Will Master Jacky Chan be
appearing afterward?

1023
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,927
Kid, it's filming,
not award presentation.

1024
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,007
If you want to meet Jacky Chan,

1025
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,567
when the film is shown then
you come over, okay.

1026
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,760
Assistant director, calculate his pay!

1027
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,481
Send him back to the
Northern corridor!

1028
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:23,849
Let's go!

1029
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,163
It's so huge.

1030
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,129
Peking Theater Industry.

1031
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:37,564
Grandma!

1032
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,727
Grandma!

1033
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,443
This area is for VIP.

1034
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:40,322
You're not allowed in here.

1035
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,082
Comrade, I need to go to the toilet.

1036
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:46,121
I can't find it.
Let me use the one here.

1037
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,003
No! No! No!

1038
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,408
This area is reserved
for mega star to rest.

1039
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:50,721
If I allowed you in,

1040
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:51,961
I'll get terminated.

1041
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:52,843
I beg you please,

1042
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,281
since I'm so elderly.

1043
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,447
I can be your grandma.

1044
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,569
I'm rushing to act in a film.

1045
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,285
Please make an exception.

1046
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,924
Granny, who are you looking for?

1047
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,563
Please excuse me.

1048
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,769
I'm looking for someone
but am in the wrong place.

1049
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:19,889
Never mind.

1050
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,522
Ah,yes!

1051
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:26,488
Do you know where Jacky Chan is?

1052
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,606
Is there something you
need to deal with Jacky Chan?

1053
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:31,921
Actually it's nothing.

1054
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,761
Just that my grandson,

1055
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,091
wants to meet with Jacky Chan.

1056
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,561
He came all the way from South
East Asia.

1057
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,606
He pester me everyday that
he wants to meet Jacky Chan.

1058
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,008
I'm at my wits end.

1059
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,569
You disguised yourself
just to look for Jacky Chan.

1060
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:49,610
Don't mention it.

1061
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:51,323
So...

1062
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,047
because he's just a kid and not
raised by me,

1063
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,645
his parents are very busy,

1064
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,011
and he thinks that I,

1065
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,651
control him too much.

1066
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,445
I just want to communicate with him,

1067
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,241
There's a generation gap.

1068
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,045
He tells me nothing.

1069
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:12,483
I felt that I owe him something.

1070
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,211
I just want to do something for him.

1071
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,042
Just to make him happy.

1072
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,402
If possible so that he can
tell me how his heart felt.

1073
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:24,163
Later on I discovered that,

1074
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,848
he likes Jacky Chan and
would like to meet him.

1075
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,803
I have no idea so...

1076
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,968
What does your grandson
wants to do with Jacky Chan?

1077
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:39,131
Yeah, what does he wants to do?

1078
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,208
I too would like to know.

1079
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,007
Granny, you...

1080
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,407
Aren't you going to the toilet?

1081
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:46,567
Why are you here?

1082
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:47,449
Go away!

1083
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:48,966
Okay!

1084
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,845
Come and use my toilet here.

1085
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,451
I...Okay!

1086
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,291
You haven't finish telling me
your grandson story.

1087
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,082
Please beg on my behalf
to the director.

1088
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,124
I came all the way  to Peking
to look for Master Jacky Chan.

1089
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:03,521
So that I can meet him just once.

1090
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,251
I've been bullied at school.

1091
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,005
I came to Peking to be his disciple.

1092
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,083
So that he can teach me martial arts.

1093
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:09,441
Can you please tell the director.

1094
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:11,842
-I just want to meet him once.
-I pity you too.

1095
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:12,410
But I've no way.

1096
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,163
Take your pay and go home early.

1097
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,682
Okay! Go home early, quick.

1098
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:19,884
Excuse me!

1099
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,841
Brother, don't you feel cold?

1100
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:58,810
You still here?

1101
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,643
Yeah, I want to meet Jacky Chan.

1102
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,081
Will he meet you?

1103
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,247
Yes!

1104
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:05,409
Why would he?

1105
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,091
Why not?

1106
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:08,767
I'm standing here,

1107
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,246
holding his poster.

1108
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,522
I am holding it up,

1109
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:12,887
so that he can see me.

1110
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,087
He definitely will meet me.

1111
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,089
Forget it.

1112
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,890
Kid's such as you are alot.

1113
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,049
Be good! Go home.

1114
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,046
Listen to uncle, brother!

1115
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,209
Just listen to big brother.

1116
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,845
Go home and learn to be
good. It's already very late.

1117
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,925
Go home and be good.

1118
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,440
Are you the one looking
for Master Jacky Chan?

1119
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,411
Come, get in the car.

1120
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:20,844
How's it?

1121
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:21,729
It's okay.

1122
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:25,050
You've arrived.

1123
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:31,889
Master Jacky Chan!

1124
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,007
My name is Cheong Yat-San.

1125
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,690
I want to be your disciple.

1126
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,165
There're alot of people who
wants to be my disciple.

1127
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:44,329
You tell me,

1128
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:45,925
why do you want to be my disciple?

1129
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:51,250
I go to school in Indonesia.

1130
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,808
I failed in Mandarin

1131
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,769
and also History test.

1132
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,001
All my classmates, they
teased me about it.

1133
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,087
Then,

1134
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,561
I got angry and so was
involved in a fight with them.

1135
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,731
They gang up and bullied me.

1136
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,241
I want to come to Peking,

1137
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:10,602
to look for you
to be my master.

1138
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,721
To learn your true martial arts.

1139
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,283
Then I'll go back to school
and seek revenge on them.

1140
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,327
You're my idol.

1141
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:21,891
I've love you since I was a child.

1142
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,761
I want to meet you.

1143
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,047
Kid, you're wrong.

1144
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,285
These are all my disciples.

1145
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:32,523
I teach them martial arts,

1146
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,285
not for fighting or bullied people.

1147
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,525
You told me just now,

1148
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,321
you even failed in your Mandarin.

1149
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:39,522
Let me ask you,

1150
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,524
do you know where your home is?

1151
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:46,008
Respecting the elders and
kindness is a Chinese traits.

1152
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:47,921
Your grandma came to
look for me personally.

1153
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,362
How do you treat her?

1154
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,802
Do you know your grandma name?

1155
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,770
Human must have will and spirit.

1156
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,563
The same goes for a country.

1157
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,245
You're a descendant of China.

1158
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,323
You even failed in your Mandarin
test.

1159
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:04,244
Of course people will
look down on you.

1160
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:06,523
Kid, remember...

1161
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,804
I'll not take you in
as my disciple today,

1162
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,042
Go home and learn.

1163
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:13,287
Passed your Mandarin exam,

1164
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:14,363
then only come to look for me.

1165
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,924
I've confidence in you.

1166
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:18,243
You'll surely succeed.

1167
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,131
Why haven't he arrived yet, really!

1168
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:34,529
Don't be anxious!

1169
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:37,047
You see, the call came
half a day earlier,

1170
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,084
why haven't he arrived yet?

1171
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:40,004
Really!

1172
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:51,368
You see, he's here.

1173
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:55,810
Granny! Granny!

1174
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:56,683
Yat-San! Yat-San!

1175
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,726
Master Jacky Chan send me home.

1176
01:17:59,000 --> 01:17:59,922
Really, that's good.

1177
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:00,962
Old folk,

1178
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,008
Master Jacky Chan,
how're you?

1179
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:02,570
How're you!

1180
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:03,210
How're you!

1181
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,887
My mission is accomplished.

1182
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:10,484
Bye! Bye!

1183
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,166
Master Jacky Chan!

1184
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,641
I just want to take a photo with you.

1185
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:15,924
Okay!

1186
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,090
But you must use my camera.

1187
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:19,564
Okay!

1188
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,040
Once you passed in your exam,

1189
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,167
I'll send you our photo.

1190
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:32,762
Granny! Grandpa!

1191
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,088
There is Jacky Chan lineage in Jiapu.

1192
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:36,169
But...

1193
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,326
you tell me,

1194
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,929
what does our ancestor's do?

1195
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:43,210
Granny, what does your granny do?

1196
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,843
You should know.

1197
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,088
Cheong Yat-San,

1198
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,481
Cheong Yat-San, congratulations
on passing your secondary.

1199
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,160
Just you guys see,

1200
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:22,646
this time when I went to China,

1201
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:23,961
and returning after becoming
Jacky Chan disciple,

1202
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:25,362
none of you...

1203
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:26,163
dare to bullied me.

1204
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:27,249
Cheong Yat-San.

1205
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,050
We don't want to bullied you.

1206
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,645
Because your Mandarin result is
so poor,

1207
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,002
not willing to lose,

1208
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,366
we just want to teach you a lesson.

1209
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,084
Correct! Today you got 80 points,

1210
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,003
we congrats you.

1211
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:37,883
Yeah!
Yes!

1212
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:38,723
Okay! Okay! Okay!

1213
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:39,768
I feel...

1214
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,485
you're all afraid,

1215
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,091
that I'll used Jacky Chan
true martial arts,

1216
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,048
to beat you.

1217
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:44,804
Bullshit!

1218
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,727
I'm not bull-shitting.

1219
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,240
I'm going to call Jacky Chan now.

1220
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:50,964
Okay!

1221
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:52,844
Just you see!

1222
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,844
<i>You've reach the voice mailbox.</i>

1223
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,808
Master Jacky Chan,
where is he?

1224
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:02,570
No sound!

1225
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:04,284
Don't say anything.

1226
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,890
Master Jacky Chan,
I'm Cheong Yat-San.

1227
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,443
I got 80 points in my Mandarin test.

1228
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,570
Why is there no sound?

1229
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:23,284
Master Jacky Chan,

1230
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,721
Let's go! Let's go!
He's bluffing.

1231
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:28,808
Let's go! Leave him alone.
