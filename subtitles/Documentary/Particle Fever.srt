1
00:02:17,536 --> 00:02:19,405
- No, I don't know.
- A few people.

2
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:25,075
I was... it was terrible.

3
00:02:25,076 --> 00:02:26,445
Tomorrow's will be better.

4
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:38,856
I don't think I can say that.

5
00:02:38,857 --> 00:02:40,657
Say it in a public forum.

6
00:02:40,658 --> 00:02:42,399
I need... I need evidence.

7
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,580
It's big, no?

8
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,646
Ever since I entered physics,

9
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,623
people have been talking about
this machine.

10
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:14,292
The Large Hadron Collider,

11
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:16,960
the biggest machine
ever built by human beings,

12
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:19,430
is finally going to turn on.

13
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:23,534
And after many, many years

14
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:25,903
of waiting and theorizing

15
00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:27,704
about how matter got created

16
00:03:27,705 --> 00:03:30,574
and about what
the deep fundamental theory

17
00:03:30,575 --> 00:03:32,276
of nature is...

18
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:35,912
all those theories
are finally going to be tested,

19
00:03:35,913 --> 00:03:37,749
and we're gonna know something.

20
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,751
And we don't know
what it's gonna be now,

21
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,119
but we will know,

22
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,805
and it's gonna change
everything.

23
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:48,660
And if the LHC
sees new particles,

24
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,928
we're on the right track.

25
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:54,799
And if it doesn't, not
only have we missed something,

26
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,573
but we may not ever know
how to proceed.

27
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:03,473
We are at a fork in the road,

28
00:04:03,474 --> 00:04:07,178
and it's either going to be
a golden era...

29
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:08,846
Oh!

30
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:11,782
Or it's going to be quite stark.

31
00:04:11,783 --> 00:04:16,254
And I've never heard of
a moment like this in history,

32
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:21,124
where an entire field
is hinging on a single event.

33
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,427
- Hi.
- Hi.

34
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,695
- I'm David.
- I'm Fabiola.

35
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,330
Fabiola, nice to meet you.

36
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,799
- So, look, I have suggested
to be on this side

37
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,768
because this big wheel
is quite spectacular.

38
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:34,272
Yeah, yeah.

39
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:35,672
More than ever,

40
00:04:35,673 --> 00:04:37,508
this will require
the collaboration

41
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:39,544
between the theory
and experimentalists,

42
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:40,825
so it would be
a very nice period

43
00:04:41,012 --> 00:04:42,946
where we work together and,
uh...

44
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:46,350
- Well, it's fun to finally
interact with experimentalists.

45
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:48,486
I mean, I used to be
just in my office,

46
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:51,663
coming up with, you know,
crazy ideas.

47
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:59,463
It's a big thing.

48
00:04:59,464 --> 00:05:02,467
There is a general sense waiting
for this machine to start,

49
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:06,804
this massive machine that has
taken so many years to build.

50
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:10,508
We are all in great anticipation
of what it might find.

51
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:12,876
And every time
there's even a rumor

52
00:05:12,877 --> 00:05:15,145
that a new particle
is discovered...

53
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:17,347
even before it turns on...

54
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:21,919
the entire field
goes into a fever pitch.

55
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,924
The experiment was designed
initially in the mid '80s

56
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:30,094
and has taken
this long to construct.

57
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:34,898
There are 10,000 people
of over 100 nationalities.

58
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,667
That includes countries

59
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:38,770
which are mortal enemies
of each other,

60
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:42,540
like India and Pakistan,
and Georgia and Russia,

61
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,241
and Iran and Israel.

62
00:05:44,242 --> 00:05:47,177
All have physicists
working on this machine.

63
00:05:47,178 --> 00:05:50,016
These big blue things
are 7-ton

64
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:52,784
superconducting magnets,

65
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,453
which have to be cooled
with liquid helium

66
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:57,621
to the coldest temperatures
on Earth,

67
00:05:57,622 --> 00:05:59,024
colder than empty space.

68
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:03,427
There are 100,000 computers

69
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:07,131
connected all over the world
to deal with the data.

70
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:09,900
In fact, the worldwide web
was invented at CERN

71
00:06:09,901 --> 00:06:11,436
so that physicists
all over the planet

72
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,270
could share the data.

73
00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:16,941
The United States was building
a machine just like this,

74
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:20,111
in fact, a bigger machine,
in Texas,

75
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:24,582
but they ran into
a small technical difficulty.

76
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:29,320
- I doubt anyone believes
that the most pressing issues

77
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:35,092
facing the nation include
an insufficient understanding

78
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:37,994
of the origins of the universe.

79
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:41,332
- Unfortunately, the
Superconducting Super Collider

80
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,835
was canceled by Congress
in 1993.

81
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:46,903
- And finally, he's saying,
"Well, if we don't do it,

82
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:48,606
the Europeans will do it."

83
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:50,475
Let them do it!

84
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,643
We'll steal their technology
like they steal our technology.

85
00:06:52,644 --> 00:06:55,412
It got very political.

86
00:06:55,413 --> 00:07:00,083
It was very expensive,
very complicated.

87
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:02,419
It's hard for physicists
to explain

88
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,155
why we do
these kinds of experiments.

89
00:07:05,156 --> 00:07:09,359
The purpose of the machine
is not military application.

90
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,528
It's not commercial application.

91
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:15,366
It's to understand something
about the basic laws of physics.

92
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:18,469
There are two kinds
of particle physicists:

93
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,371
there are the experimentalists.

94
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:24,174
They built the big machines,
run the experiments,

95
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:27,012
analyze the data,
and try to discover things,

96
00:07:28,012 --> 00:07:30,515
like new particles;

97
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:34,019
And then there are
the theorists, like me.

98
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:37,153
We construct the theories

99
00:07:37,154 --> 00:07:40,657
that try to explain everything
we see in nature.

100
00:07:40,658 --> 00:07:45,162
Without us, the experimentalists
are in the dark,

101
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:47,231
but without them,

102
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:49,670
we'll never know the truth.

103
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:54,871
- I mean, if you go,
it won't be so terrible.

104
00:07:54,872 --> 00:07:57,141
When I was at Stanford,
I had a mentor:

105
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:59,576
Savas Dimopoulos.

106
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:03,814
Savas only likes to work
on the biggest puzzles.

107
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:05,683
Now, just for fun,

108
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:08,818
I wanted to tell you that the
enabling technologies that...

109
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,422
- He has
some of the most famous theories

110
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:13,558
that will be tested at the LHC,

111
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:17,395
but he doesn't know
if any of them are true,

112
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:20,931
so there's an intensity with
which he approaches physics.

113
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:24,568
If he works on a paper that
could result in a Nobel Prize,

114
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:27,438
he doesn't allow more
than three people on the paper,

115
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,506
because you can only share
the Nobel Prize

116
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:31,174
with three people.

117
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:34,678
That's the level
at which he's operating

118
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,714
and the impact
he's trying to have.

119
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:39,242
- Takes us beyond the
confines of atomic physics.

120
00:08:40,018 --> 00:08:41,686
In particle physics,

121
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,255
you have to have a threshold
amount of intelligence,

122
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:47,925
whatever that means.

123
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:50,460
But the thing
that differentiates scientists

124
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:54,065
is purely an artistic ability

125
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:58,702
to discern what is a good idea,

126
00:08:58,703 --> 00:09:00,370
what is a beautiful idea,

127
00:09:00,371 --> 00:09:02,806
what is worth spending time on,

128
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:05,942
and, most importantly,

129
00:09:05,943 --> 00:09:11,047
what is a problem that
is sufficiently interesting,

130
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:13,383
yet sufficiently difficult

131
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:16,086
that it hasn't yet been solved,

132
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:21,793
but the time
for solving it has come now?

133
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,984
- So people have been waiting
for this experiment,

134
00:09:47,985 --> 00:09:50,023
the LHC, for a very long time.

135
00:09:50,685 --> 00:09:52,422
Nothing like it
has ever happened.

136
00:09:52,423 --> 00:09:53,923
All the superlatives
are justified.

137
00:09:53,924 --> 00:09:57,094
This is the case
where the hype is...

138
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:58,995
the hype
is approximately accurate.

139
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:01,532
To get, you know, 3,000 people

140
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:02,966
to work
on an experiment together,

141
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:04,668
whose goal is to understand

142
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:06,836
what's going on at distances
a thousand times smaller

143
00:10:06,837 --> 00:10:08,505
than the proton...

144
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:11,475
this is... this is a really
extraordinary testament

145
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:16,113
to what...
to some of the highest ideals

146
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:18,382
we can have as human beings.

147
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:20,051
It's...

148
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:23,053
- Nima and I got our PhDs
around the same time.

149
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:24,854
He's a couple years ahead of me.

150
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:28,993
And Nima
is the star of our generation,

151
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:32,897
and he's the guy we all followed
and looked up to

152
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,297
and tried to keep up with

153
00:10:34,298 --> 00:10:37,373
and tried to outpace
if we could.

154
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:43,139
Since the mid '70s,

155
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,875
we've had an amazingly
successful theory of nature

156
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:48,512
that we call the Standard Model
of particle physics.

157
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:51,181
But sitting in the heart
of the theory is a sickness,

158
00:10:51,182 --> 00:10:54,752
very, very glaring
conceptual problems

159
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:56,964
that infected
this fantastic understanding.

160
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:01,191
Why is the universe big?

161
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:03,860
Why is gravity so much weaker
than all the other forces?

162
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:06,596
The kinds of answers that this
theory gives to these questions

163
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:09,200
seems so patently absurd

164
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:13,436
that we think that we're missing
something very, very big.

165
00:11:13,437 --> 00:11:15,572
And on top of all of that,

166
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:17,742
there is one prediction
of this theory...

167
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,343
absolutely crucial
for it to even make

168
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:21,445
internal theoretical sense...

169
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:23,913
and this is
the famous Higgs particle.

170
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:25,715
The Higgs, or something like it,
must show up.

171
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:27,218
If it doesn't show up,

172
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,552
there's something
truly, deeply wrong,

173
00:11:29,553 --> 00:11:30,888
very, very, deeply wrong

174
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:32,757
with the way
we think about physics.

175
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,191
There are strong reasons

176
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:35,558
to think that some
of these questions

177
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,628
will find answers at the LHC.

178
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:39,062
There's been no shortage
of ideas

179
00:11:39,063 --> 00:11:41,431
for what they might be,

180
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:44,902
but this is really
this generation of people's...

181
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:46,903
my generation of people's...
only shot.

182
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:01,952
Ah, so the boss comes.

183
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,998
I first came to CERN in 1987.

184
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:17,133
I was a very young
undergraduate student,

185
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:20,137
and I remember the first time
I entered the site.

186
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:22,672
I was a bit scared
by the corridors

187
00:12:22,673 --> 00:12:25,176
in the CERN main site,

188
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,945
so I was almost lost
in those corridors.

189
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:29,680
For me, it has been
a wonderful experience,

190
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:31,415
because I had the chance
of being involved

191
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,183
right from the beginning

192
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:37,187
and to see, really, an
experiment from starting and...

193
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:38,855
from zero, essentially.

194
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:40,657
- I've seen two inventors
place out of the ten,

195
00:12:40,658 --> 00:12:42,091
and we probably have seen...

196
00:12:42,092 --> 00:12:43,627
- I don't think
I can describe right now

197
00:12:43,628 --> 00:12:45,495
the excitement about first beam.

198
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:47,931
I mean, the entire control room

199
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:52,369
is like a group
of six-year-olds

200
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,839
whose birthday is next week,
you know,

201
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,206
and there's going to be cake,

202
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:57,807
and there's going to be
presents,

203
00:12:57,808 --> 00:12:59,475
and all their friends
are going to be there,

204
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:00,945
and they just, you know...

205
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,547
they just know
it's going to be great.

206
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:05,615
You know,
they're kind of scattered,

207
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:07,851
and I can't imagine, 'cause
they're not that big, right?

208
00:13:07,852 --> 00:13:09,286
I've been a postdoc here
for a year,

209
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:10,653
so I'm a relative newcomer.

210
00:13:10,654 --> 00:13:12,339
But my timing
is sort of perfect.

211
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:14,725
I mean,
to be on the ground floor

212
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:16,326
when the data first comes...

213
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:17,561
it's awesome.

214
00:13:17,562 --> 00:13:19,997
That means I have 5,000 emails.

215
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:22,365
There's a huge difference

216
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:25,235
between theorists
and experimentalists.

217
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:27,303
I mean, when I started college,

218
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:30,840
I absolutely did not
want to do physics.

219
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:33,263
Physics meant to me
everything that was boring:

220
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:37,981
textbooks, theories, proofs.

221
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:40,246
But then I discovered
the experimental side,

222
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:44,989
and the experimental side
is the hands-on aspect.

223
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,856
It's about taking a theory,

224
00:13:46,857 --> 00:13:50,728
which is abstract,
and making it real.

225
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,308
How do you build an experiment

226
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,867
to discover something
that the theory predicts?

227
00:13:56,868 --> 00:14:00,038
And that aspect is what I love.

228
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,454
Of course, when constructing
the whole thing,

229
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:19,389
we several times thought,

230
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,292
"What if the whole thing
just does not work?"

231
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:24,228
I really believe now
this will work,

232
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:27,263
but the next thing is,
will we ever find something?

233
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:30,267
So maybe we will
just find nothing new.

234
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:32,569
It would be a catastrophe
for physics.

235
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,437
We would, somehow...

236
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:37,106
none of the open questions
which we have at the moment

237
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:40,244
would've been answered.

238
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:46,383
- So the LHC is basically the
most fundamental of experiments.

239
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:49,153
It's like what any child
would design as an experiment.

240
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:53,290
You take two things,
and you smash them together.

241
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,225
And you get a lot of stuff that
comes out of that collision,

242
00:14:56,226 --> 00:14:59,463
and you try
to understand that stuff.

243
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:01,331
Now, in this case,

244
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:04,401
what we're smashing together
is tiny protons,

245
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:07,904
which are inside the center
of every atom.

246
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:10,673
And in order to get them
going as fast as possible,

247
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:14,744
we have to build
this huge 17-mile ring,

248
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:18,315
and we run those protons
around the ring multiple times

249
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:21,985
to build up speed,
almost to the speed of light,

250
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:25,288
and then we collide two beams
going in opposite directions

251
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:27,191
at four points,

252
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:30,527
and at those four points
are four different experiments:

253
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:35,499
ATLAS, LHCb, CMS, and ALICE.

254
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,468
Now, I work
on the ATLAS experiment.

255
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,005
And ATLAS is like
a huge seven-story camera

256
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:45,175
that takes a snapshot
of every single collision,

257
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:47,945
and that's billions
of collisions.

258
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:51,882
And the hope is that we'll see
the very famous Higgs particle.

259
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:54,685
But every time we've turned on
the new accelerator

260
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:56,119
at a higher energy,

261
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,888
we've always been surprised.

262
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:01,392
So the real hope
is that we'll see the Higgs,

263
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,762
but that there's also something
amazingly new.

264
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:11,502
- You can liken it to
when we put a man on the moon.

265
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,202
It's that level
of collaborative effort.

266
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:15,172
I would say,
even bigger than that.

267
00:16:15,173 --> 00:16:16,840
This is closer to something like

268
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:19,576
human beings
building the Pyramids.

269
00:16:19,577 --> 00:16:21,045
Why did they do it?

270
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,345
Why are we doing it?

271
00:16:22,346 --> 00:16:24,047
We actually have two answers.

272
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:26,316
One answer
is what we tell people,

273
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:29,154
and the other answer
is the truth.

274
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:32,255
I'll tell you both.

275
00:16:32,256 --> 00:16:35,058
And there's nothing incorrect
about the first answer.

276
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:37,994
It's just... it doesn't... it's
not the thing that drives us.

277
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:39,763
It's not how we think about it,

278
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:41,764
but it's something
you can say quickly,

279
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,402
and the person you're talking to
won't, you know,

280
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:48,772
<i>get diverted or pass out
or pick up the SkyMall catalog</i>

281
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:51,207
if you happen to be next to them
on an airplane.

282
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,743
Answer number one:

283
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:56,846
we are reproducing the physics,

284
00:16:56,847 --> 00:16:59,850
the conditions,
just after the big bang.

285
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:01,718
We're doing it in this collider,

286
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:04,520
and we're reproducing that
so we can see what it was like

287
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:06,289
when the universe just started.

288
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,723
This is what we tell people.

289
00:17:07,724 --> 00:17:10,393
Okay, answer two:

290
00:17:10,394 --> 00:17:13,063
we are trying to understand
the basic laws of nature.

291
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:15,632
It sounds slightly more mild,

292
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:19,470
but this is really where we are
and what we're trying to do.

293
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,905
We study particles,
because just after the big bang,

294
00:17:22,906 --> 00:17:25,108
all there was was particles,

295
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:30,213
and they carried the information
about how our universe started

296
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:33,083
and how it got to be
the way it is

297
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:36,452
and its future.

298
00:17:36,453 --> 00:17:38,922
At the beginning of the 1900s,

299
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:42,492
it became clear
that all known matter,

300
00:17:42,493 --> 00:17:44,294
everything that we know about,

301
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:45,796
is made of atoms,

302
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:49,333
and that atoms are made
of just three particles:

303
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:53,339
the electron, the proton,
and the neutron.

304
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:59,075
In the '30s,
other particles were discovered,

305
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:01,144
and by the 1960s,

306
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:03,180
there were hundreds
of new particles,

307
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:06,150
with a new particle discovered
every week.

308
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,785
And there was mass confusion,

309
00:18:08,786 --> 00:18:12,922
until a number
of theorists realized

310
00:18:12,923 --> 00:18:15,159
that there was a simple
mathematical structure

311
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,960
that explained all of this,

312
00:18:17,961 --> 00:18:19,762
that most of these particles

313
00:18:19,763 --> 00:18:21,531
were made of the same
three little bits

314
00:18:21,532 --> 00:18:23,534
we call quarks,

315
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:24,815
and that there are only
a handful

316
00:18:25,002 --> 00:18:26,870
of truly fundamental particles,

317
00:18:26,871 --> 00:18:29,806
which all fit together
in a nice, neat pattern.

318
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:32,779
And there was born
the Standard Model.

319
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:38,681
Eventually, all the particles
in the theory

320
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:42,821
were discovered,
except one: the Higgs.

321
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:48,991
And the Higgs
is unlike any other particle.

322
00:18:48,992 --> 00:18:52,328
It's the linchpin
of the Standard Model.

323
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:56,066
Its theory was written down
in the 1960s by Peter Higgs

324
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:58,535
and a number of other theorists.

325
00:18:58,536 --> 00:19:01,305
We believe
it is the crucial piece

326
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,240
responsible
for holding matter together.

327
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:08,545
It is connected to a field
which fills all of space

328
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:12,048
and which gives particles,
like the electron, mass

329
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:15,085
and allowed them
to get caught in atoms

330
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:17,988
and thus is responsible
for the creation of atoms,

331
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:20,591
molecules, planets, and people.

332
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:24,029
Without the Higgs, life
as we know it wouldn't exist.

333
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:27,864
But to prove that it's true,

334
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:31,201
we have to smash particles
together at high enough energy

335
00:19:31,202 --> 00:19:35,872
to disturb the field
and create a Higgs particle.

336
00:19:35,873 --> 00:19:37,740
If the Higgs exists,

337
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:40,943
the LHC is the machine
that will discover it.

338
00:19:40,944 --> 00:19:43,579
- Let's assume you're successful
and everything comes out okay.

339
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,681
- Sure.
- What do we gain from it?

340
00:19:45,682 --> 00:19:47,284
What's the economic return?

341
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:48,884
How do you justify all this?

342
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:50,787
By the way, I am an economist.

343
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:53,856
I don't hold it against you.

344
00:19:53,857 --> 00:19:57,861
The question
by an economist was,

345
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:01,765
"What is the financial gain of
running an experiment like this

346
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:05,368
and the discoveries that we
will make in this experiment?"

347
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:07,804
And it's a very,
very simple answer.

348
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:11,074
I have no idea.

349
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:12,608
We have no idea.

350
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:14,644
When radio waves
were discovered,

351
00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:16,579
they weren't called radio waves,

352
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,481
because there were no radios.

353
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:21,418
They were discovered
as some sort of radiation.

354
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:25,221
Basic science
for big breakthroughs

355
00:20:25,222 --> 00:20:26,922
needs to occur at a level

356
00:20:26,923 --> 00:20:29,660
where you're not asking,
"What is the economic gain?"

357
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,961
You're asking,
"What do we not know,

358
00:20:31,962 --> 00:20:33,764
and where
can we make progress?"

359
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,932
So what is the LHC good for?

360
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:40,837
Could be nothing other than
just understanding everything.

361
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:54,250
- The first time
I ever saw ATLAS was in 2005.

362
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:56,585
I had come out just to see
what ATLAS would look like

363
00:20:56,586 --> 00:20:59,122
because there was a possibility
that I could be working on it

364
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:02,159
as a postdoc.

365
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,828
I can remember walking in
and just being like...

366
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:07,463
You know, just stunned.

367
00:21:07,464 --> 00:21:09,298
I mean, me, stunned,
you know, just, you know,

368
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,367
already kind of having an idea
of the magnitude.

369
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:13,670
People tell you,
"Oh, it's five stories tall."

370
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:15,338
And you go, "Oh, okay,
five stories tall."

371
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:17,207
And then you see.

372
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:22,883
Five stories completely filled
with microelectronics...

373
00:21:25,883 --> 00:21:29,553
All custom designed,
all hand-soldered.

374
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:34,192
You know, it's like as if
it's a five-story Swiss watch.

375
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,651
- There was this issue
about the BCIDs.

376
00:23:41,652 --> 00:23:43,286
- We had our extended barrel
out earlier,

377
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:46,456
but it should be back in,
and we should be...

378
00:23:46,457 --> 00:23:48,758
everything running normal.

379
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:51,094
- Okay, so one more
announcement.

380
00:23:51,095 --> 00:23:53,797
We have to be extremely careful

381
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:54,831
what we do to the system.

382
00:23:55,031 --> 00:23:56,533
I mean, we know that anybody

383
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:58,835
who's even updating
a number somewhere

384
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:01,637
might stop our system for
more than an hour quite easily.

385
00:24:01,638 --> 00:24:05,275
So please be absolutely sure
that you yourself

386
00:24:05,276 --> 00:24:07,810
and everybody in your system
is not touching the system,

387
00:24:07,811 --> 00:24:11,114
unless it's been agreed
by the shift leader, yeah?

388
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:14,284
Nothing should be touched, yeah?

389
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:15,719
And that includes all things

390
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,187
that you're absolutely
dead certain

391
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:18,873
they will not do anything wrong.

392
00:24:19,856 --> 00:24:21,192
Especially those things.

393
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,695
- It's being called the
largest scientific experiment

394
00:24:26,696 --> 00:24:28,198
in history,

395
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:31,133
and some say
one that could cause Armageddon.

396
00:24:31,134 --> 00:24:33,470
- It's the strangest
experiment ever:

397
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,372
mankind's most ambitious attempt

398
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:38,509
to understand
how we all got here.

399
00:24:40,344 --> 00:24:42,746
- Thousands of scientists
from around the world

400
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:46,348
spent 20 years designing
an extraordinary machine.

401
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:50,886
It cost £5 billion
and will switching on very soon.

402
00:24:50,887 --> 00:24:52,989
This is a genesis machine,

403
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,258
a window on creation.

404
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:02,266
Five months of testing on...

405
00:25:05,343 --> 00:25:08,238
- They're looking for something
called the God Particle,

406
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:10,673
but skeptics are saying nobody
knows what will happen

407
00:25:10,674 --> 00:25:12,409
when they turn on the switch.

408
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,345
- A group of French scientists
believe the collider

409
00:25:15,346 --> 00:25:16,845
might create a black hole

410
00:25:16,846 --> 00:25:18,748
that could swallow up the earth,

411
00:25:18,749 --> 00:25:22,255
and they filed suit to stop
the project from going forward.

412
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,525
Hello?

413
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,259
No, absolutely not.

414
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,395
Well, no, there is no scientific
ground to what they say.

415
00:25:33,396 --> 00:25:36,432
It's not possible that the LHC
is going to destroy the world.

416
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:37,968
It's absolutely ridiculous.

417
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,202
Okay, it is 9:15.

418
00:25:40,203 --> 00:25:44,106
We are 15 minutes away
from beam.

419
00:25:44,107 --> 00:25:46,476
We've been sitting here,
about 7:00,

420
00:25:46,477 --> 00:25:49,813
and absolutely nobody
brought food.

421
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:51,581
Again, 15 minutes to beam.

422
00:25:51,582 --> 00:25:52,949
<i>- Ciao, ciao.
- Stress levels are high.</i>

423
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,550
<i>Ciao.</i>

424
00:25:54,551 --> 00:25:56,219
- But since I'm in a room
full of Italians,

425
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,720
the stress level's
pretty cool here.

426
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:59,122
But we have no coffee either.

427
00:25:59,123 --> 00:26:00,890
No coffee.
Who didn't bring coffee?

428
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:02,424
What we're going to see today

429
00:26:02,425 --> 00:26:06,095
is the launch
of the first beam of protons

430
00:26:06,096 --> 00:26:08,598
around this enormous ring.

431
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:13,603
Very shortly, Lyn Evans,
the project director,

432
00:26:13,604 --> 00:26:16,271
is going to be addressing
CERN staff,

433
00:26:16,272 --> 00:26:18,307
who are gathered
at different points

434
00:26:18,308 --> 00:26:21,678
around this massive complex.

435
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:27,517
- It's just the first glimpse
at the fact the machine can run.

436
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:29,085
I mean, so what you need,
really,

437
00:26:29,086 --> 00:26:30,787
is, you need two beams
colliding together

438
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:32,489
for quite a few...

439
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,423
quite a long period of time
before you calculate,

440
00:26:34,424 --> 00:26:35,959
get enough...

441
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,662
sufficient statistics
in which to actually

442
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,797
be able to look
for the new physics.

443
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:42,865
But single beam,
the first beam, isn't even that.

444
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:44,500
You're not even getting
any collisions.

445
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:46,970
It's just one beam
going around in a circle,

446
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:48,637
not even at the high energies.

447
00:26:48,638 --> 00:26:50,606
Just one beam going
around in the low energy circle,

448
00:26:50,607 --> 00:26:52,776
that sort of says, "Okay,
we made it around the ring once

449
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,810
for the first time."

450
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,545
And it's a huge event.

451
00:26:55,546 --> 00:26:57,547
Right, after 19 years,
you've been waiting

452
00:26:57,548 --> 00:26:59,214
for this first step.

453
00:26:59,215 --> 00:27:00,950
Let's get started, everybody.

454
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:03,886
Now comes the day of reckoning.

455
00:27:03,887 --> 00:27:08,057
Five, four, three,

456
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:10,993
two, one...

457
00:27:10,994 --> 00:27:13,395
Now.

458
00:27:13,396 --> 00:27:14,898
No beam.

459
00:27:16,866 --> 00:27:18,334
Yeah.

460
00:27:18,335 --> 00:27:22,238
So where are we
with the injection kicker?

461
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:25,075
Oh, well...
they're out.

462
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:28,077
Okay, never mind.

463
00:27:28,078 --> 00:27:29,578
Let's go.

464
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:33,348
Five, four, three,

465
00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:37,520
two, one, zero.

466
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:46,595
We get a beam on this pulse?

467
00:27:46,596 --> 00:27:48,932
I hope so.

468
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:02,279
Yes!

469
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:20,797
- Well, last night I was,
like, waking up constantly.

470
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:22,364
Like, "Did we set that right?

471
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:24,681
What about... did we disable...
oh, my gosh!"

472
00:28:28,404 --> 00:28:29,806
Marzio.

473
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:32,541
I have a plot for you.

474
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:34,643
Okay, check this out.

475
00:28:34,644 --> 00:28:36,045
This is Z.

476
00:28:36,046 --> 00:28:38,314
This is timing, in nanoseconds,

477
00:28:38,315 --> 00:28:40,150
which we knew
from the cosmic data.

478
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:42,285
- That is very nice.
- Yes.

479
00:28:42,286 --> 00:28:44,720
- Upstairs, I think people
were more excited about this.

480
00:28:44,721 --> 00:28:47,489
- If you're in Google,
that means... that's the world.

481
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,392
This is the most important thing
today.

482
00:28:49,393 --> 00:28:50,660
This is the first,

483
00:28:50,661 --> 00:28:51,995
and this tells us
a lot of things.

484
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,662
It tells us that
the magnetic properties

485
00:28:53,663 --> 00:28:54,963
of the machine are good,

486
00:28:54,964 --> 00:28:56,665
that the aperture is clear.

487
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:59,134
There's nothing is sticking into
the beam pipe anywhere.

488
00:28:59,135 --> 00:29:03,172
So a very, very encouraging sign
and remarkable progress.

489
00:29:03,173 --> 00:29:05,074
- Did you guys see
our beautiful plot?

490
00:29:05,075 --> 00:29:06,810
- What?
- Okay, I want to show you this.

491
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,510
Come on, show them the plot.

492
00:29:08,511 --> 00:29:10,479
You can take a picture of...
here you go.

493
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,848
Well, see if you can get it.

494
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:14,183
I don't think
there's anyone else

495
00:29:14,184 --> 00:29:16,251
I can show my plot to, so...

496
00:29:16,252 --> 00:29:17,620
It worked.

497
00:29:17,621 --> 00:29:19,422
It just worked.

498
00:29:19,423 --> 00:29:21,691
And there are so few times
in life where it just works.

499
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:24,093
And there are so
even fewer times in life

500
00:29:24,094 --> 00:29:26,930
where it just works great.

501
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,198
We rocked.

502
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,536
I mean, Tile, first beam...

503
00:29:32,536 --> 00:29:34,437
We destroyed that shit.

504
00:29:34,438 --> 00:29:36,772
They got a beam circulating.

505
00:29:36,773 --> 00:29:40,442
They've had beams circulating
for a full 30 seconds.

506
00:29:40,443 --> 00:29:41,678
So let me understand.

507
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,780
This is one beam going one way?

508
00:29:44,781 --> 00:29:46,548
- They have one beam
going one way,

509
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:48,684
and then they went to the
other beam going the other way.

510
00:29:48,685 --> 00:29:49,791
Well, does it work?

511
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:51,621
The second beam,
did it go fully around?

512
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:53,856
- Everything...
- they both went around.

513
00:29:53,857 --> 00:29:56,058
I think
they had the beam go around

514
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:57,326
about a million times.

515
00:29:57,327 --> 00:29:58,795
Something like that.

516
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:02,198
- Yeah, their Twitter feed
said 10 million.

517
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:06,202
- Now we'll become, you know,
CERN Twitter junkies.

518
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,673
I guess this is exciting.

519
00:30:11,674 --> 00:30:15,377
My logical self
wants to be excited.

520
00:30:15,378 --> 00:30:19,830
My psychological self
is very cautious.

521
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,597
My parents are both Iranian

522
00:30:35,598 --> 00:30:38,701
and both physicists,

523
00:30:38,702 --> 00:30:42,872
and my father in particular
had real political difficulties

524
00:30:42,873 --> 00:30:44,009
with the regime,

525
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,876
and we had to go underground
for a number of years,

526
00:30:47,877 --> 00:30:51,114
and we ended up escaping
from Iran

527
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:55,285
through the border of Turkey.

528
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:59,889
But then, through
a number of wonderful accidents,

529
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,691
we ended up in Canada.

530
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:04,393
I got interested in physics

531
00:31:04,394 --> 00:31:06,395
when I was 13 or 14 years old.

532
00:31:06,396 --> 00:31:09,932
It just offered the way
to combine the two things

533
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:11,433
I really loved:

534
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:14,237
mathematics
and things in the natural world.

535
00:31:14,238 --> 00:31:15,771
You almost done?

536
00:31:15,772 --> 00:31:17,539
Yeah.

537
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,741
- It's just saying "What if?"
- It's, uh... yeah.

538
00:31:19,742 --> 00:31:21,611
- You're preparing
a broader audience for this.

539
00:31:21,612 --> 00:31:24,146
- Okay, now I'm going
to just do something fun.

540
00:31:24,147 --> 00:31:25,815
Just do something fun.

541
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:27,951
What would be fun?

542
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,585
- No, don't write "hell."
It's a public...

543
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:31,087
All right, I'm sorry!

544
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,922
- How about that?
- There we go.

545
00:31:33,923 --> 00:31:36,392
- Thinking about the LHC
has been the center

546
00:31:36,393 --> 00:31:42,097
of my intellectual life
for about 15, 16 years now.

547
00:31:42,098 --> 00:31:44,733
Depending on what happens
with the LHC,

548
00:31:44,734 --> 00:31:46,335
you know, these are 15 years

549
00:31:46,336 --> 00:31:48,470
I could come to see
as the best possible thing

550
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:50,472
I could've been doing
with this time,

551
00:31:50,473 --> 00:31:53,175
or it could just be
that the entire 15 years

552
00:31:53,176 --> 00:31:54,576
might as well have not happened,

553
00:31:54,577 --> 00:31:56,179
had no impact,

554
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,448
and then that's just 15 years
that are gone.

555
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,817
It's not the sort of thing

556
00:32:00,017 --> 00:32:02,785
where there's
a consolation prize.

557
00:32:02,786 --> 00:32:07,323
You know,
it's a fairly binary situation.

558
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:09,325
I definitely won't feel,
"Oh, well,

559
00:32:09,326 --> 00:32:11,160
"I gave it
a good old college try.

560
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:12,428
"It's all fine anyway.

561
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:13,662
It's just trying that counts."

562
00:32:13,663 --> 00:32:15,297
I don't believe that.

563
00:32:15,298 --> 00:32:16,865
I don't believe
it's just trying that counts.

564
00:32:16,866 --> 00:32:18,367
I believe getting it right
is what counts.

565
00:32:18,368 --> 00:32:21,104
Okay, please take your seats.

566
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,874
Now it's time
for the entertainment part.

567
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:28,310
So as with every
great physics event,

568
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:31,381
we're going to start
with a big bang,

569
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,383
the ATLAS big bang event,

570
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:36,786
and that's going to follow
with music all evening,

571
00:32:36,787 --> 00:32:39,389
people from ATLAS, who are
going to be performing for you.

572
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,790
So let's get started.

573
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:46,295
- Take 2,000 intelligent,
ambitious,

574
00:32:46,296 --> 00:32:47,864
type "A" personalities.

575
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:51,034
You make them work 16-hour days,

576
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:55,070
high-pressure situation,
lots of stress.

577
00:32:55,071 --> 00:32:58,641
You know, that's the recipe
for disaster.

578
00:32:58,642 --> 00:33:01,695
Or at least it's a recipe for
a reality television program.

579
00:33:02,712 --> 00:33:04,346
But all that physics,

580
00:33:04,347 --> 00:33:08,851
Higgs, extra dimensions,
supersymmetry,

581
00:33:08,852 --> 00:33:11,487
microscopic black holes,
macroscopic black holes,

582
00:33:11,488 --> 00:33:14,323
Z-primes, you name it,

583
00:33:14,324 --> 00:33:19,662
the physics that the theorists
only dream of

584
00:33:19,663 --> 00:33:21,498
is ours to discover.

585
00:33:22,932 --> 00:33:26,269
Thank you.

586
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,488
♪ Oh, yeah ♪

587
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:13,749
♪ Thanks to
the Large Hadron Collider ♪

588
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,994
Thank you, ATLAS!

589
00:34:24,994 --> 00:34:28,330
- I grew up in Turkey
from Greek parents

590
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:32,567
and a middle-class family,

591
00:34:32,568 --> 00:34:36,906
and then, in the '60s,
we became refugees.

592
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:38,508
We had to leave Turkey

593
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,477
because of ethnic tensions
between Greeks and Turks

594
00:34:41,478 --> 00:34:44,312
over the island of Cyprus,

595
00:34:44,313 --> 00:34:47,850
and there were a lot
of political cross currents,

596
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:49,451
left, right,

597
00:34:49,452 --> 00:34:52,622
and I was a young,
impressionable 13-year-old

598
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:55,357
hearing the pro-left
and pro-right arguments,

599
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:58,261
so one day I would be convinced
that one side was right.

600
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,662
The other day,
I would be convinced

601
00:34:59,663 --> 00:35:01,296
the other side was right.

602
00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:02,832
And then I was getting confused.

603
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,634
How could both of these things
be true

604
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:07,035
if they were contrary
to each other?

605
00:35:07,036 --> 00:35:10,872
So I decided to focus on a field

606
00:35:10,873 --> 00:35:14,810
where the truth didn't depend
on the eloquence of the speaker.

607
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:16,648
The truth was absolute.

608
00:35:18,648 --> 00:35:20,716
Of course, when I started out,

609
00:35:20,717 --> 00:35:23,685
I thought that within
maybe five years

610
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:26,488
the theories
that I was working on

611
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:28,390
were going to be tested

612
00:35:28,391 --> 00:35:31,694
and I was going to know
the experimental truth

613
00:35:31,695 --> 00:35:34,964
and move on to the next round
of ideas after that.

614
00:35:34,965 --> 00:35:37,866
Little did I know
that the experiments

615
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:39,502
would take far longer,

616
00:35:39,503 --> 00:35:42,138
and here I am, 30 years after,

617
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:45,179
still not knowing the truth.

618
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:52,714
Peter?

619
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:54,417
- I can show you
here a nice event.

620
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:55,850
Did you see this from...

621
00:35:55,851 --> 00:35:57,720
- Ah, no.
- Andreas showed me this.

622
00:35:57,721 --> 00:35:59,754
- I haven't seen it.
- This is from yesterday night.

623
00:35:59,755 --> 00:36:02,725
This is now a real
beam gas event.

624
00:36:02,726 --> 00:36:05,261
So you see the tracks
also bent...

625
00:36:05,262 --> 00:36:07,395
- Bent by the field?
- Very nice.

626
00:36:07,396 --> 00:36:08,712
Ah, no, I haven't seen...

627
00:36:08,912 --> 00:36:11,033
In some sense, I started
form the wrong perspective

628
00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:12,701
and in the wrong way,

629
00:36:12,702 --> 00:36:15,071
because I'd been studying
a lot of literature

630
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,672
when I was at high school level.

631
00:36:17,673 --> 00:36:21,076
So literature, art,
philosophy, history,

632
00:36:21,077 --> 00:36:24,046
and very little physics
and mathematics.

633
00:36:24,047 --> 00:36:25,714
I'd also been studying music,
piano,

634
00:36:25,715 --> 00:36:28,085
and so I was very much
attracted by art.

635
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:34,624
There are many similarities
between music and physics.

636
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:38,294
Classical music
follows rules of harmony,

637
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:41,431
which are really rules
of physics and mathematics.

638
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:47,435
But, also, I was fascinated
by big questions.

639
00:36:47,436 --> 00:36:49,305
That is the possibility
of addressing

640
00:36:49,306 --> 00:36:52,875
and answering big questions
about nature, the universe,

641
00:36:52,876 --> 00:36:55,111
why, when, how,

642
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:57,279
and when I finished high school,

643
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,616
I thought that physics allow us

644
00:37:00,617 --> 00:37:02,752
to address this big question

645
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:06,656
in a more practical way
than, for instance, philosophy.

646
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:09,458
That's why I decided
to study physics.

647
00:37:28,077 --> 00:37:30,280
- Yes, we lost
these two there...

648
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,924
I managed to go through, like,

649
00:37:42,925 --> 00:37:45,873
the four gallons of milk
that I had in the fridge, but...

650
00:37:48,918 --> 00:37:50,866
- We were just waiting
for collisions,

651
00:37:50,867 --> 00:37:52,301
waiting for collisions.

652
00:37:52,302 --> 00:37:55,705
and finally,
then this helium leak,

653
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:59,774
which really, uh...
it's really frustrating.

654
00:37:59,775 --> 00:38:04,814
We cannot even go there
and investigate what happened.

655
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:07,982
You have to warm up the magnets,

656
00:38:07,983 --> 00:38:10,553
and warming up the magnets
needs to be done

657
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:15,056
on a very slow pace and...
in order not to break them...

658
00:38:15,057 --> 00:38:17,636
then you can investigate
and cool them down again.

659
00:38:39,181 --> 00:38:41,317
- The world's largest
atom smasher,

660
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:44,185
the Large Hadron Collider,

661
00:38:44,186 --> 00:38:46,321
is to be shut down
for at least two months.

662
00:38:46,322 --> 00:38:48,591
CERN, the European Organization
for Nuclear Research...

663
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,259
- Scientists at CERN are trying
to put on a brave face.

664
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,263
A faulty electrical connection
between two magnets

665
00:38:54,264 --> 00:38:55,830
led to a ton of liquid helium

666
00:38:55,831 --> 00:38:58,600
being leaked into
the 27-kilometer tunnel.

667
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:00,703
The first high-speed
particle collisions

668
00:39:00,704 --> 00:39:02,738
were due to take place
later this month.

669
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:04,439
The goal now

670
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,730
is simply to get this
vastly complex machine working.

671
00:39:57,126 --> 00:39:58,727
Fucking hell, look at that.

672
00:39:58,728 --> 00:40:00,763
This is just unbelievable.

673
00:40:00,764 --> 00:40:03,933
You've got magnets
just sheared off their jacks.

674
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,724
We've actually
put in enough energy

675
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:10,138
to melt it and to vaporize
a whole tube of...

676
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:13,509
- And the stuff's all covered in
a sort of black, metallic dust.

677
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,776
Completely catastrophic, eh?

678
00:40:14,777 --> 00:40:16,444
Completely catastrophic.

679
00:40:16,445 --> 00:40:18,413
- There's no more vacuum
in the beam vacuum,

680
00:40:18,414 --> 00:40:21,283
so can as well open it up and
see whether there's any dust,

681
00:40:21,284 --> 00:40:22,618
because if there's dust,

682
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,752
it means
we have to clean all the way

683
00:40:24,753 --> 00:40:26,187
until it's...

684
00:40:26,188 --> 00:40:27,857
I hope, in the worst case,

685
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:33,972
we have not to take out
more than 20 or so magnets.

686
00:40:42,972 --> 00:40:47,176
Both my family and my students

687
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:51,212
detect a definite level of...

688
00:40:51,213 --> 00:40:54,554
let's say pessimism
and disappointment.

689
00:40:57,554 --> 00:40:59,721
The built expectation

690
00:40:59,722 --> 00:41:03,325
that now we were going to know
the truth,

691
00:41:03,326 --> 00:41:05,660
it fizzled and delayed,

692
00:41:05,661 --> 00:41:08,068
and it's just, uh...

693
00:41:13,068 --> 00:41:15,974
I thought
I was stronger than this.

694
00:41:17,974 --> 00:41:21,042
It surprised me.

695
00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:23,245
- I did say that I thought
it was a mistake

696
00:41:23,246 --> 00:41:24,980
for CERN to have
this gigantic celebration

697
00:41:24,981 --> 00:41:27,649
for things just when
it just had a few protons

698
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:30,051
wandering around in one
direction around the ring,

699
00:41:30,052 --> 00:41:32,488
that it was just a bad idea
to have so much hoopla

700
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:34,189
before anything
was actually happening.

701
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,691
At the time
when people were asking me

702
00:41:35,692 --> 00:41:37,091
if I was going to CERN
to celebrate,

703
00:41:37,092 --> 00:41:38,660
I said, "I'm going to go to CERN

704
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:40,529
"when there's a reason
to celebrate, you know,

705
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,330
"when things are colliding
into each other,

706
00:41:42,331 --> 00:41:43,933
"when something
is starting to happen,

707
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:46,868
not for some crappy PR reason."

708
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:48,437
And that backfired.

709
00:41:48,438 --> 00:41:50,238
That, I think... really,
that really backfired,

710
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:52,174
and I think
that was a PR disaster.

711
00:41:52,175 --> 00:41:54,375
It was a PR disaster
largely of CERN's own making.

712
00:41:54,376 --> 00:41:56,078
You don't go around, you know,

713
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,816
having gigantic parties
before anything has happened.

714
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:29,078
- So the magnets that have
come out are being refurbished,

715
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,946
and so they're sort of
trundling through

716
00:42:30,947 --> 00:42:32,647
about six magnets a week now.

717
00:42:32,648 --> 00:42:35,384
So that's no longer
the bottleneck.

718
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:37,419
Now they're kind of
getting to the state

719
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,955
where they're ready to start
redoing the interconnects

720
00:42:39,956 --> 00:42:41,790
in the tunnel,

721
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:45,259
and they're already about a week
or two behind on that.

722
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,761
Given the complexity...

723
00:42:46,762 --> 00:42:48,430
- The other thing
is that they're drilling

724
00:42:48,431 --> 00:42:50,131
these bloody holes
in the magnets.

725
00:42:50,132 --> 00:42:52,667
- Because they, like...
- what I heard this last time,

726
00:42:52,668 --> 00:42:54,903
they were saying that
all their tools are breaking

727
00:42:54,904 --> 00:42:56,337
and that sort of business.

728
00:42:56,338 --> 00:42:57,506
- But it begs the question,
of course,

729
00:42:57,507 --> 00:42:59,107
you know, what are the risks?

730
00:42:59,108 --> 00:43:00,908
I mean, you kind of basically,
you're going...

731
00:43:00,909 --> 00:43:02,143
I don't know.

732
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:03,678
We didn't actually think so much

733
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:05,446
about the collateral effects
of the helium.

734
00:43:05,447 --> 00:43:06,681
- Nobody has.
- Yeah, nobody.

735
00:43:06,682 --> 00:43:08,183
- Yeah.
- Nobody.

736
00:43:08,184 --> 00:43:09,917
Well, there's been
a lot of investigations

737
00:43:09,918 --> 00:43:11,520
into the cause
of the original problem,

738
00:43:11,521 --> 00:43:13,488
and the general agreement
is that we run

739
00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:15,823
at half design energy.

740
00:43:15,824 --> 00:43:19,093
- Experimentalists
aren't going to be happy.

741
00:43:19,094 --> 00:43:20,596
Well...

742
00:43:20,597 --> 00:43:23,765
- So, yeah...
so the latest schedule is this:

743
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:25,801
we just put out is D-Day,

744
00:43:25,802 --> 00:43:27,935
beams back on
the 21st of September.

745
00:43:27,936 --> 00:43:30,171
Isn't that a bit optimistic?

746
00:43:30,172 --> 00:43:32,808
Isn't that a bit
optimistic for, uh, this year?

747
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:34,810
- When you're dealing
with something

748
00:43:34,811 --> 00:43:36,477
that is a long-term project...

749
00:43:36,478 --> 00:43:38,781
and the LHC
is a long-term project.

750
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,383
It's a 20-year project.

751
00:43:41,384 --> 00:43:43,285
You can't think about the end.

752
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:44,724
Ever.

753
00:43:47,724 --> 00:43:50,392
If you start out
a marathon thinking,

754
00:43:50,393 --> 00:43:52,294
"I can't wait
to get to the finish line;

755
00:43:52,295 --> 00:43:55,129
"I'm gonna have my Gatorade
at the finish line;

756
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:58,299
I'm gonna have my greasy french
fries at the finish line,"

757
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,535
or whatever motivates you...

758
00:44:00,536 --> 00:44:02,471
if you start thinking that
at mile one

759
00:44:02,472 --> 00:44:05,306
and it's, like,
ten minutes into the race,

760
00:44:05,307 --> 00:44:06,975
and you're thinking to yourself,

761
00:44:06,976 --> 00:44:09,578
"Wow, I'm only at mile one.

762
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:15,317
I've got 25.2 miles to go."

763
00:44:15,318 --> 00:44:17,585
And if you're thinking that
at the start,

764
00:44:17,586 --> 00:44:18,854
then you're done.

765
00:44:18,855 --> 00:44:20,190
Mentally, you are done.

766
00:44:21,724 --> 00:44:24,040
- This is what doing
discovery physics means.

767
00:44:25,027 --> 00:44:26,996
This is what doing
discovery means.

768
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:51,252
Why do people have curiosity?

769
00:44:51,253 --> 00:44:55,691
Why do we care about how
distant parts of the universe,

770
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:57,792
things that happened
billion years ago,

771
00:44:57,793 --> 00:44:59,261
like the big bang,

772
00:44:59,262 --> 00:45:00,863
why do we find them
that interesting?

773
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,564
It doesn't affect
what we do day-to-day.

774
00:45:03,565 --> 00:45:07,236
But nevertheless,
once you have curiosity,

775
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,204
you can't control it.

776
00:45:13,108 --> 00:45:15,310
- It'll ask questions
about the universe.

777
00:45:15,311 --> 00:45:19,046
It will ask questions
about harmonic patterns

778
00:45:19,047 --> 00:45:23,752
that create art, music.

779
00:45:23,753 --> 00:45:25,721
- That's a sculpture?
- That's a sculpture.

780
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:27,790
- Yeah, doesn't it look like
a bunch of broken tiles?

781
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,457
- That's what it's supposed
to look like.

782
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:31,292
And it's, uh...
and when I saw it,

783
00:45:31,293 --> 00:45:33,595
I thought it was just rubble
left over from the construction.

784
00:45:33,596 --> 00:45:34,830
Right, yeah.

785
00:45:34,831 --> 00:45:36,165
- You can, in principle,
move it.

786
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:37,765
- So people go up
and move pieces?

787
00:45:37,766 --> 00:45:40,768
- No, people don't.
- But people could.

788
00:45:40,769 --> 00:45:42,571
Why would they have it
so you can move it around

789
00:45:42,572 --> 00:45:44,105
if you weren't going
to move it around?

790
00:45:44,106 --> 00:45:45,573
No, I think you're right.

791
00:45:45,574 --> 00:45:47,241
- I think you're allowed
to move it around.

792
00:45:47,242 --> 00:45:49,143
- It's certainly
a different experience of it.

793
00:45:49,144 --> 00:45:50,511
I agree.

794
00:45:50,512 --> 00:45:52,446
See, I thought
that that belonged here.

795
00:45:52,447 --> 00:45:53,816
It's just...
it's the perfect spot.

796
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:55,250
- It certainly
changes everything.

797
00:45:55,251 --> 00:45:57,852
- It does.
- Slate and granite.

798
00:45:57,853 --> 00:46:00,988
I guess that's the granite,
and that's the slate.

799
00:46:00,989 --> 00:46:02,762
Hmm.

800
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:08,363
It's interesting.

801
00:46:08,364 --> 00:46:10,031
- There's something
philosophically

802
00:46:10,032 --> 00:46:12,701
about this piece of art
that bothers me.

803
00:46:12,702 --> 00:46:15,037
It's taking a lot of
sort of random things

804
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:16,337
and making some order out of it.

805
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:17,872
Yes.

806
00:46:17,873 --> 00:46:19,640
- It's trying to make order
out of something

807
00:46:19,641 --> 00:46:21,176
where there isn't any,

808
00:46:21,177 --> 00:46:23,212
instead of taking things
that don't seem ordered

809
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:25,980
and figuring out
that there is order.

810
00:46:25,981 --> 00:46:29,618
- The way we try to reduce
the complexity of the world

811
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:33,120
is by looking for patterns,

812
00:46:33,121 --> 00:46:35,390
what we call symmetries.

813
00:46:35,391 --> 00:46:38,694
We take all the particles
we know today,

814
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:40,127
and we attempt to fit them

815
00:46:40,128 --> 00:46:42,128
into some kind
of underlying structure.

816
00:46:43,032 --> 00:46:46,468
Are they the remnants
of some more beautiful

817
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:50,675
and complete picture
of the laws of nature?

818
00:46:52,675 --> 00:46:57,346
It's like, you go to Egypt,
and you see ruins.

819
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:59,881
If you look at it the right way,

820
00:46:59,882 --> 00:47:01,040
I could draw a pyramid

821
00:47:02,018 --> 00:47:04,051
and see that
these chunks of stone

822
00:47:04,052 --> 00:47:07,388
are actually the remains
of something very clean

823
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:08,890
and very symmetric,

824
00:47:08,891 --> 00:47:11,826
very beautiful.

825
00:47:11,827 --> 00:47:15,166
We know that the Standard Model
is incomplete.

826
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:19,401
We know that there's
other stuff out there,

827
00:47:19,402 --> 00:47:22,604
that there are other particles
that we haven't seen yet.

828
00:47:22,605 --> 00:47:25,707
Dark matter
is a speculated particle

829
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:29,343
which we think
actually dominates the universe,

830
00:47:29,344 --> 00:47:31,846
and yet we've never seen it
directly,

831
00:47:31,847 --> 00:47:34,549
and it's not part
of the Standard Model.

832
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:37,285
That's one of those rocks.

833
00:47:37,286 --> 00:47:39,955
We think, possibly,

834
00:47:39,956 --> 00:47:43,625
that that and many other
particles are still out there

835
00:47:43,626 --> 00:47:46,030
and are all part
of a much bigger symmetry,

836
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,696
a much bigger theory

837
00:47:48,697 --> 00:47:51,572
that includes the Standard
Model, but much more.

838
00:47:57,572 --> 00:48:01,410
The most popular theory
is called supersymmetry,

839
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,578
or SUSY for short.

840
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:07,783
Supersymmetry was a theory
that sort of started to develop

841
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:09,250
in the late '70s.

842
00:48:09,251 --> 00:48:11,819
Savas was one
of the first authors

843
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:16,091
of the first theories
of supersymmetry.

844
00:48:16,092 --> 00:48:19,294
- It is the unfathomable
depths of...

845
00:48:19,295 --> 00:48:25,167
- Supersymmetry is our best
guess of what else is out there,

846
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,268
the bigger theory
that incorporates

847
00:48:27,269 --> 00:48:28,837
our current theories,

848
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:31,138
the Standard Model.

849
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:33,274
But for it to be true,

850
00:48:33,275 --> 00:48:36,856
we have to discover
those other particles.

851
00:48:46,851 --> 00:48:48,957
- If I could choose a dream
of any theory

852
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:50,692
that the LHC could find,

853
00:48:50,693 --> 00:48:53,328
actually, I would love
for them to see supersymmetry.

854
00:48:53,329 --> 00:48:59,267
Supersymmetry says,
for every type of particle,

855
00:48:59,268 --> 00:49:00,801
say the electron,

856
00:49:00,802 --> 00:49:03,471
there's a heavy superpartner.

857
00:49:03,472 --> 00:49:05,172
So you have the...

858
00:49:05,173 --> 00:49:07,142
and they have really stupid
names, unfortunately,

859
00:49:07,143 --> 00:49:08,676
called the selectron.

860
00:49:08,677 --> 00:49:10,879
You just add an S to the name.
The squark.

861
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,950
Uh, the sup, the sdown.

862
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:16,785
Supersymmetry, or SUSY,

863
00:49:16,786 --> 00:49:20,055
is extremely important
for the theoretical community

864
00:49:20,056 --> 00:49:22,691
because it solves
many mathematical problems

865
00:49:22,692 --> 00:49:24,625
with the Standard model.

866
00:49:24,626 --> 00:49:28,363
Now, experimentally, it would be
the experimentalists' dream.

867
00:49:28,364 --> 00:49:31,566
You know, tons of particles
that are just coming out,

868
00:49:31,567 --> 00:49:33,401
and you just don't even know
what to do with...

869
00:49:33,402 --> 00:49:35,236
you know, can't even
write the data fast enough

870
00:49:35,237 --> 00:49:36,571
in order to discover them.

871
00:49:36,572 --> 00:49:39,844
So that'd be my dream.

872
00:49:42,649 --> 00:49:44,913
It used to be
that in the control room life,

873
00:49:44,914 --> 00:49:46,214
it was kind of a luxury.

874
00:49:46,215 --> 00:49:48,049
You know, you could kind of...

875
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:50,084
you could, you know, kind
of style your hair for the day

876
00:49:50,085 --> 00:49:52,220
because you didn't have to wear
a hard helmet all day.

877
00:49:52,221 --> 00:49:53,921
You could wear nice shoes,
you know,

878
00:49:53,922 --> 00:49:55,991
because you were in
the control room environment.

879
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:58,660
Now, it's all back to, you know,

880
00:49:58,661 --> 00:50:00,830
bring the dirtiest clothes
that you own to work

881
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:03,330
because you're gonna be crawling
around in, like,

882
00:50:03,331 --> 00:50:05,033
you know, hard helmets,
steel-toed boots.

883
00:50:05,034 --> 00:50:06,401
Not the most attractive shoes,

884
00:50:06,402 --> 00:50:08,192
but, you know,
I kind of like them.

885
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,674
We're pulling out
the electronics.

886
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:14,776
We're fixing things that
we didn't actually have time

887
00:50:14,777 --> 00:50:17,946
to get to
during the last shutdown.

888
00:50:17,947 --> 00:50:20,047
The goal of this is
that it would be

889
00:50:20,048 --> 00:50:23,422
in even better shape
for next beam.

890
00:50:26,422 --> 00:50:32,928
Okay, so that is, I think,
all that I have to say.

891
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:36,698
Hope the theorists
aren't driving you crazy.

892
00:50:36,699 --> 00:50:39,033
Don't listen to them,
by the way,

893
00:50:39,034 --> 00:50:40,968
because theorists,

894
00:50:40,969 --> 00:50:44,875
they can sometimes...

895
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:47,475
Just telling you.

896
00:50:47,476 --> 00:50:49,243
You got to come back
to the experimental world

897
00:50:49,244 --> 00:50:53,381
so that you can touch bases
with reality.

898
00:50:53,382 --> 00:50:56,418
All right,
I'll talk to you soon.

899
00:51:00,651 --> 00:51:03,125
- One of the most basic facts
about the universe

900
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:04,326
is that it's big.

901
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:06,828
So you might wonder,

902
00:51:06,829 --> 00:51:10,665
"Why is the universe big?"

903
00:51:10,666 --> 00:51:12,734
There's actually
a single number,

904
00:51:12,735 --> 00:51:14,335
called
the cosmological constant,

905
00:51:14,336 --> 00:51:16,404
that plays a crucial role

906
00:51:16,405 --> 00:51:18,973
in determining
what the universe looks like.

907
00:51:18,974 --> 00:51:21,743
In fact, around ten years ago,

908
00:51:21,744 --> 00:51:24,578
astronomers discovered
a really remarkable fact:

909
00:51:24,579 --> 00:51:27,482
the universe is getting bigger
and bigger

910
00:51:27,483 --> 00:51:29,920
at a faster and faster rate.

911
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,323
But this rate
is a million, billion,

912
00:51:35,324 --> 00:51:39,960
billion, billion, billion,
billion, billion times slower

913
00:51:39,961 --> 00:51:42,199
than what we'd actually predict.

914
00:51:43,799 --> 00:51:46,368
When you're off by
a factor of a million, billion,

915
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:48,537
billion, billion, billion,
billion, billion,

916
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:50,205
there's something very wrong

917
00:51:50,206 --> 00:51:54,475
with your understanding
of basic physics.

918
00:51:54,476 --> 00:51:55,944
Even worse,

919
00:51:55,945 --> 00:51:57,979
this one number,
the cosmological constant,

920
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,314
needs to have
this extremely precise value.

921
00:52:00,315 --> 00:52:03,451
And if the value
is different even by a tiny bit,

922
00:52:03,452 --> 00:52:06,891
we would radically change what
the world looks like around us.

923
00:52:09,891 --> 00:52:12,127
If you saw a situation where,

924
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:14,495
if the parameter
has a very dangerous value

925
00:52:14,496 --> 00:52:16,531
and you change it a little bit,

926
00:52:16,532 --> 00:52:17,899
the world
would change radically,

927
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,167
and we'd be dead.

928
00:52:19,168 --> 00:52:21,035
We couldn't possibly live.

929
00:52:21,036 --> 00:52:22,870
You would wonder
where that came from.

930
00:52:22,871 --> 00:52:25,372
You know, how is that possible?

931
00:52:25,373 --> 00:52:26,975
So just on the face of it,

932
00:52:26,976 --> 00:52:28,810
you would look at the situation
and say,

933
00:52:28,811 --> 00:52:32,046
"Wow, someone really cared
to put this parameter

934
00:52:32,047 --> 00:52:34,549
"at just the right value
so that we get to be here

935
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:36,685
"and that
it's a pleasant universe

936
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:39,923
and really cares a lot."

937
00:52:41,923 --> 00:52:45,096
This is the sort of thing that
really keeps you up at night.

938
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:49,263
It really makes you wonder,
"Maybe we've got something

939
00:52:49,264 --> 00:52:51,433
"about the whole picture,
the big picture,

940
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:53,119
totally, totally,
totally wrong."

941
00:53:09,018 --> 00:53:11,720
- Before I went
to elementary school,

942
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:16,890
my mother started telling me
biblical stories.

943
00:53:16,891 --> 00:53:19,127
She told me that if we are good,

944
00:53:19,128 --> 00:53:20,794
we'll go to paradise,

945
00:53:20,795 --> 00:53:23,300
and we will stay there forever.

946
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,035
And when she said "forever,"

947
00:53:28,036 --> 00:53:31,473
I started panicking.

948
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:32,973
I kept asking, "Forever?"

949
00:53:32,974 --> 00:53:34,241
"Forever?"

950
00:53:34,242 --> 00:53:35,944
You mean, it never ends?

951
00:53:35,945 --> 00:53:38,580
Like, you wake up,
and you know that then,

952
00:53:38,581 --> 00:53:39,913
you go back to sleep,

953
00:53:39,914 --> 00:53:42,149
and this never ends, never ends,

954
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:43,623
never ends.

955
00:53:47,623 --> 00:53:49,624
I started crying.

956
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:51,292
She told me,
"What's wrong with you?

957
00:53:51,293 --> 00:53:52,560
"This is paradise.

958
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:54,928
"It will be a lot of fun.

959
00:53:54,929 --> 00:53:56,507
You'll be very happy there."

960
00:54:05,507 --> 00:54:08,676
But this idea of eternity,

961
00:54:08,677 --> 00:54:11,513
something infinite,

962
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:13,815
scared me.

963
00:54:37,373 --> 00:54:39,274
- There is
a scientific alternative

964
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:41,676
to believing there's
someone out there who loves us,

965
00:54:41,677 --> 00:54:45,346
twiddling the dials very finely
for things to work out.

966
00:54:45,347 --> 00:54:47,781
And this alternative,
said briefly,

967
00:54:47,782 --> 00:54:50,218
is that everything we see
in our observed universe

968
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:52,386
is actually a very small part

969
00:54:52,387 --> 00:54:56,524
of a much,
much vaster multiverse.

970
00:54:56,525 --> 00:54:58,292
You might
literally imagine that,

971
00:54:58,293 --> 00:55:00,060
from some bird's eye
point of view,

972
00:55:00,061 --> 00:55:02,897
if you went
to enormous distances,

973
00:55:02,898 --> 00:55:05,533
you would see that our universe
is actually a little pocket

974
00:55:05,534 --> 00:55:08,974
inside a vastly bigger space.

975
00:55:11,974 --> 00:55:14,743
In this picture,
these mysterious numbers,

976
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:16,477
like the cosmological constant,

977
00:55:16,478 --> 00:55:19,717
are actually basically random.

978
00:55:21,717 --> 00:55:25,319
And out there in the multiverse,
next to us somewhere,

979
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,323
is another region
where these numbers take on

980
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:29,556
some other random value,

981
00:55:29,557 --> 00:55:31,225
and then another region

982
00:55:31,226 --> 00:55:33,428
where they take on
some other random value still.

983
00:55:33,429 --> 00:55:36,163
Only in a tiny sliver,
a minuscule part

984
00:55:36,164 --> 00:55:37,866
of this gigantic multiverse,

985
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:40,267
for completely
accidental reasons,

986
00:55:40,268 --> 00:55:43,037
do these numbers take on
the very, very special values

987
00:55:43,038 --> 00:55:44,738
which allows structures to grow,

988
00:55:44,739 --> 00:55:48,343
stars to form, galaxies to form.

989
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:50,215
Ultimately,
things like us to form.

990
00:55:53,215 --> 00:55:57,051
This is the really
opposite extreme interpretation

991
00:55:57,052 --> 00:55:59,187
of the presence of fine-tuning

992
00:55:59,188 --> 00:56:02,624
as intelligent designers
would want to give.

993
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:05,058
If you believe
that someone out there cares

994
00:56:05,059 --> 00:56:07,928
and twiddles the parameters
so that you can exist,

995
00:56:07,929 --> 00:56:11,533
that puts our existence
at the very core of reality.

996
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,401
If you believe
that our entire universe

997
00:56:14,402 --> 00:56:16,971
is a tiny, little,
minuscule spec

998
00:56:16,972 --> 00:56:19,941
in a gigantic multiverse
which is mostly lethal,

999
00:56:19,942 --> 00:56:22,109
that's a polar opposite
philosophy

1000
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:25,814
for what the universe
looks like.

1001
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:29,283
In fact, it's an idea
that many physicists loathe,

1002
00:56:29,284 --> 00:56:31,618
because certain questions
then become things

1003
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:34,992
that we will not hope
to be able to understand.

1004
00:56:36,992 --> 00:56:40,794
- Nima is now an advocate
for this idea

1005
00:56:40,795 --> 00:56:43,064
that the laws of physics
are different

1006
00:56:43,065 --> 00:56:46,134
in different parts
of this multiverse,

1007
00:56:46,135 --> 00:56:49,136
that what we measure
in experiments

1008
00:56:49,137 --> 00:56:52,640
are not deep mysteries
of nature,

1009
00:56:52,641 --> 00:56:55,977
but they're just random
accidents in our universe,

1010
00:56:55,978 --> 00:56:58,245
that maybe even the Higgs itself

1011
00:56:58,246 --> 00:57:01,281
is a random accident that
has occurred in our universe

1012
00:57:01,282 --> 00:57:04,853
and let's life exist,
but has no explanation.

1013
00:57:07,922 --> 00:57:10,795
In a sense,
it's the end of physics.

1014
00:57:13,795 --> 00:57:16,196
- On the one hand,
we have the direction

1015
00:57:16,197 --> 00:57:18,633
that we've been on
for the last 400 years,

1016
00:57:18,634 --> 00:57:23,770
towards increasing beauty,
simplicity, symmetry,

1017
00:57:23,771 --> 00:57:26,341
and a path
that has time and time again

1018
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:28,609
paid off with deeper
and deeper insights

1019
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:30,284
about the way the world works.

1020
00:57:36,284 --> 00:57:40,288
On the other hand, we have
the idea of the multiverse,

1021
00:57:40,289 --> 00:57:43,290
which would move us
to a real picture

1022
00:57:43,291 --> 00:57:46,528
not of symmetry and beauty
and order,

1023
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:51,536
but fundamentally of chaos
on enormous distances.

1024
00:57:54,536 --> 00:57:58,473
This is the really
very, very big-scale question

1025
00:57:58,474 --> 00:58:00,317
which the LHC
is going to push us in

1026
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:03,860
one way or the other.

1027
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:25,767
- What happens, for example,
if...

1028
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:27,035
Oh, blimey.

1029
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:28,669
Yeah, there's a lot of...

1030
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:30,878
Hi, Katja.
You all right?

1031
00:58:37,579 --> 00:58:39,580
Oh, you're not recording this,
huh?

1032
00:58:39,581 --> 00:58:40,950
Yes, we're all on the...

1033
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:52,607
- Yeah, don't worry
about all the other crap.

1034
00:58:56,097 --> 00:58:58,533
We've got the beams
going around again.

1035
00:58:58,534 --> 00:59:00,234
The magnet repairs
are holding up well,

1036
00:59:00,235 --> 00:59:02,203
and our next challenge
is to take these beams

1037
00:59:02,204 --> 00:59:03,571
up to high energy
and collide them.

1038
00:59:03,572 --> 00:59:05,073
Okay.

1039
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:08,042
- We're very, very aware
of the damage we can do.

1040
00:59:08,043 --> 00:59:09,710
Here we go.

1041
00:59:09,711 --> 00:59:13,092
- That's what worries me stiff
at the moment.

1042
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:28,663
- The original proposal
for ATLAS was in 1989.

1043
00:59:28,664 --> 00:59:30,665
And you're kind of riding
this idea.

1044
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:33,334
You've got this dream
of physics.

1045
00:59:33,335 --> 00:59:35,403
This dream of physics
is what pulled everyone along

1046
00:59:35,404 --> 00:59:36,404
for those 19 years.

1047
00:59:37,005 --> 00:59:40,508
And so here, now, today,
finally,

1048
00:59:40,509 --> 00:59:42,977
with high-energy collisions,

1049
00:59:42,978 --> 00:59:48,116
we can start to look
for that dream of new physics.

1050
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:49,018
Uh, blue.

1051
00:59:50,018 --> 00:59:52,919
The control room, yes.

1052
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,187
The control room.

1053
00:59:54,188 --> 00:59:55,597
This is the control room.

1054
01:00:02,597 --> 01:00:06,968
- The pressure of it being
an event, of course, is there.

1055
01:00:06,969 --> 01:00:10,671
And, of course, anything
can go wrong, and it has.

1056
01:00:10,672 --> 01:00:13,707
Last weekend
was a complete disaster.

1057
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:15,142
We were discussing
the possibility

1058
01:00:15,143 --> 01:00:17,477
that we do collisions
during the night

1059
01:00:17,478 --> 01:00:20,281
rather than the plan,
9:00 in the morning.

1060
01:00:20,282 --> 01:00:23,216
Of course,
this has caused major,

1061
01:00:23,217 --> 01:00:25,787
sort of knock-ons for,
one, the experiments,

1062
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,880
and two, for the media service.

1063
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,314
Good morning, everybody.

1064
01:00:53,315 --> 01:00:54,848
I propose we start.

1065
01:00:54,849 --> 01:00:56,584
I will take you briefly
over the whole summary

1066
01:00:56,585 --> 01:00:58,051
of the weekend,

1067
01:00:58,052 --> 01:01:00,154
just to get you
up to date what happened.

1068
01:01:00,155 --> 01:01:01,922
During the night,
we tried to set up again

1069
01:01:01,923 --> 01:01:03,191
for high intensities,

1070
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:04,725
for 450 GeV collisions,

1071
01:01:04,726 --> 01:01:06,194
but then we were cut short

1072
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:08,361
because we encountered a vacuum.

1073
01:01:08,362 --> 01:01:12,100
- What everybody wants,
from a physics point of view

1074
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:13,401
and from being sure,

1075
01:01:13,402 --> 01:01:15,403
is doing it secretly before

1076
01:01:15,404 --> 01:01:17,437
and showing it to the media
during the day.

1077
01:01:17,438 --> 01:01:19,573
And I think this was also
the wish of Fabiola.

1078
01:01:19,574 --> 01:01:21,542
It's the wish of everybody,

1079
01:01:21,543 --> 01:01:23,845
because this is, of course,
then you're much more certain.

1080
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:26,546
But this does not work nowadays.

1081
01:01:26,547 --> 01:01:28,181
Media wants to see
this little risk.

1082
01:01:28,182 --> 01:01:29,683
I understand.

1083
01:01:29,684 --> 01:01:32,120
So that means
we have to adapt to that.

1084
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:33,021
Let's see.

1085
01:01:34,021 --> 01:01:37,558
This...
this is not it.

1086
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:38,926
It doesn't seem like...

1087
01:01:38,927 --> 01:01:40,428
You got to hit the reload.

1088
01:01:40,429 --> 01:01:42,863
I'm reloading it.

1089
01:01:42,864 --> 01:01:45,732
Yeah, I wonder
if we should stop.

1090
01:01:45,733 --> 01:01:47,535
Everyone is reloading it.

1091
01:01:47,536 --> 01:01:49,273
Maybe we should stop.

1092
01:01:51,273 --> 01:01:52,540
There you go.

1093
01:01:52,541 --> 01:01:54,642
- Hey!
- All right.

1094
01:01:54,643 --> 01:01:56,746
Okay, now.

1095
01:01:58,746 --> 01:02:00,614
And, indeed, welcome to CERN,

1096
01:02:00,615 --> 01:02:02,616
the European Organization
for Nuclear Research,

1097
01:02:02,617 --> 01:02:03,917
in Geneva.

1098
01:02:03,918 --> 01:02:05,721
Welcome to
the CERN control center.

1099
01:02:33,782 --> 01:02:35,316
And here on the screen

1100
01:02:35,317 --> 01:02:37,417
we can see the four
different experiments:

1101
01:02:37,418 --> 01:02:41,788
ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, and ALICE.

1102
01:02:41,789 --> 01:02:45,993
And the program for today
is to first send one beam

1103
01:02:45,994 --> 01:02:48,863
in one direction, a second
beam in the opposite direction.

1104
01:02:48,864 --> 01:02:51,765
They will circulate
in parallel for a while,

1105
01:02:51,766 --> 01:02:54,801
and when everything is ready
and under control,

1106
01:02:54,802 --> 01:02:56,504
the separation
is going to be removed,

1107
01:02:56,505 --> 01:02:59,674
and the beams
are going to be made to collide

1108
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:02,442
in the four points
around the LHC machine.

1109
01:03:02,443 --> 01:03:04,444
- I just think to myself,
if you imagine, like,

1110
01:03:04,445 --> 01:03:06,513
Thomas Edison, like,
inventing the lightbulb...

1111
01:03:06,514 --> 01:03:08,649
if he had tried to invent
the lightbulb with, like,

1112
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:10,517
a hundred camera crews
in his workshop,

1113
01:03:10,518 --> 01:03:12,185
and they would've been like,
"Oh, my God,

1114
01:03:12,186 --> 01:03:13,486
"you can't even turn it on?

1115
01:03:13,487 --> 01:03:14,855
"Come on!
Turn it on now!

1116
01:03:14,856 --> 01:03:16,691
"Come... ugh,
we're still waiting?

1117
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:18,792
Come on. Ah, come on.
What's wrong with this guy?"

1118
01:03:18,793 --> 01:03:24,698
- So the violet... there's always
one vertical, horizontal beam.

1119
01:03:24,699 --> 01:03:26,134
One beam.

1120
01:03:29,471 --> 01:03:30,873
Shh!

1121
01:03:32,173 --> 01:03:33,506
Please.

1122
01:03:33,507 --> 01:03:35,308
So a few minutes.

1123
01:03:35,309 --> 01:03:36,152
Okay, thank you.

1124
01:03:37,012 --> 01:03:38,585
Thank you, bye.

1125
01:03:43,585 --> 01:03:44,852
Wow.

1126
01:03:44,853 --> 01:03:46,393
Everybody hear?

1127
01:03:52,393 --> 01:03:55,730
Few minutes away.

1128
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:59,232
- So we should watch that one,
our trigger rate,

1129
01:03:59,233 --> 01:04:01,768
this one, the separation bumps,
and the event displays.

1130
01:04:01,769 --> 01:04:03,537
Okay, these are
the three screens to watch.

1131
01:04:03,538 --> 01:04:05,272
If you have three eyes,
one there, one here,

1132
01:04:05,273 --> 01:04:08,509
and one over there.

1133
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:11,279
- So, okay,
both beams are at 3.5 TeV,

1134
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,180
and we've just collapsed
the separation bumps

1135
01:04:14,181 --> 01:04:15,783
and brought the beams
into collision

1136
01:04:15,784 --> 01:04:17,118
inside the four experiments.

1137
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,419
- Starting.
- They're starting.

1138
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:20,053
They're starting.

1139
01:04:20,054 --> 01:04:22,724
- Oh.
- Ooh.

1140
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,359
Okay, they're starting.

1141
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,696
- Two beams,
one in blue, one in red,

1142
01:04:28,697 --> 01:04:32,566
each circulating
in opposite directions.

1143
01:04:32,567 --> 01:04:35,102
They have
to get closer and closer.

1144
01:04:35,103 --> 01:04:38,939
When the numbers
on the four readers say zero,

1145
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:42,077
it means that the beams
are finally aligned.

1146
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:05,148
This is the historical moment
we were all expecting.

1147
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:08,639
It can be anytime now.

1148
01:06:09,664 --> 01:06:12,665
Wow! Wow!

1149
01:06:12,666 --> 01:06:13,901
Fantastic!

1150
01:06:13,902 --> 01:06:15,870
Beautiful.

1151
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:19,141
- Wow.
- We are ready.

1152
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:30,417
First things first.

1153
01:06:30,418 --> 01:06:33,988
I just have to say:
"data."

1154
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:39,161
It's... it's unbelievable
how fantastic data is.

1155
01:06:58,352 --> 01:06:59,879
You have this invariant mass.

1156
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,681
This is for the Z
to mu-mu channel.

1157
01:07:01,682 --> 01:07:03,451
And you have this mass peak
of the Z,

1158
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:05,429
in order to estimate
your backgrounds.

1159
01:07:14,429 --> 01:07:19,299
It's like the world
at ATLAS and LHC and CMS

1160
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,134
and all those places
has suddenly changed.

1161
01:07:21,135 --> 01:07:23,604
I mean, it's like,
all of a sudden, there's data.

1162
01:07:23,605 --> 01:07:25,538
And after so many years
of not having data

1163
01:07:25,539 --> 01:07:26,906
and new data, new physics,

1164
01:07:26,907 --> 01:07:28,542
there's just so much
possibility,

1165
01:07:28,543 --> 01:07:30,143
and even though
you're rediscovering

1166
01:07:30,144 --> 01:07:32,078
the Standard Model,
that is more exciting.

1167
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:34,281
But the most exciting thing
about the data

1168
01:07:34,282 --> 01:07:36,149
is not the first collision.

1169
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:37,884
Because the first collision,
okay, great.

1170
01:07:37,885 --> 01:07:40,453
First collision,
everyone loves the first.

1171
01:07:40,454 --> 01:07:43,424
But the most exciting thing
about the data is the, you know,

1172
01:07:43,425 --> 01:07:45,459
1 millionth collision
or the 2 millionth collision

1173
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:47,627
or the fact that collisions
just keep coming and coming

1174
01:07:47,628 --> 01:07:49,163
and coming and coming,

1175
01:07:49,164 --> 01:07:51,165
and the more and more
collisions we have,

1176
01:07:51,166 --> 01:07:52,799
the more and more chance we have

1177
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,634
to look
at the interesting physics,

1178
01:07:54,635 --> 01:07:57,805
because it just means more
and more and more data for us.

1179
01:07:57,806 --> 01:07:59,239
The running is pretty good.

1180
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,274
- But right now,
it's running amazingly.

1181
01:08:01,275 --> 01:08:02,810
Yeah, right now,

1182
01:08:02,811 --> 01:08:04,611
but the day of reckoning
is in several months.

1183
01:08:04,612 --> 01:08:06,113
We heard rumors on that.

1184
01:08:06,114 --> 01:08:07,680
- Well, we should be hearing
rumors now.

1185
01:08:07,681 --> 01:08:09,316
We really should be
hearing rumors now.

1186
01:08:09,317 --> 01:08:10,651
- I'm a little worried,
actually.

1187
01:08:10,652 --> 01:08:12,352
Yeah.

1188
01:08:12,353 --> 01:08:14,288
- Well, we're hearing murmurs.
- What, what's...

1189
01:08:14,289 --> 01:08:15,689
Murmurs.
We're hearing murmurs.

1190
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:17,457
There either...
there isn't much there,

1191
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:19,527
or they're doing a very good job
keeping a poker face.

1192
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:21,362
- Or they're still at the point
where half of...

1193
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:22,996
where they're still trying
to figure out

1194
01:08:22,997 --> 01:08:24,864
what's a murmur
and what's a rumor, internally.

1195
01:08:24,865 --> 01:08:26,700
And I think
that's probably actually true.

1196
01:08:26,701 --> 01:08:27,968
Right.

1197
01:08:27,969 --> 01:08:29,269
The problem is that, also,

1198
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:30,970
I take completely innocent
remarks

1199
01:08:30,971 --> 01:08:32,805
and vastly over-interpret them.

1200
01:08:32,806 --> 01:08:35,175
- Obviously, we're going to
learn about the first discovery

1201
01:08:35,176 --> 01:08:36,777
on Twitter and Facebook.

1202
01:08:36,778 --> 01:08:38,278
- That's so sad,
but I think it's true.

1203
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:39,779
It is.

1204
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:41,614
- You mean, I shouldn't check
the arXiv

1205
01:08:41,615 --> 01:08:43,817
first thing in the morning...
I need to check my Facebook?

1206
01:08:43,818 --> 01:08:45,952
- The arXiv is the last thing.
- The arXiv is the last...

1207
01:08:45,953 --> 01:08:47,654
- First, like,
check Nima's Twitter feed.

1208
01:08:47,655 --> 01:08:48,988
Then check the arXiv.

1209
01:08:48,989 --> 01:08:50,724
If Nima has a Twitter feed,

1210
01:08:50,725 --> 01:08:52,936
then there's something
has been discovered.

1211
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:59,465
It is August 7, 2011,

1212
01:08:59,466 --> 01:09:05,572
and, this is a significant time
for the LHC.

1213
01:09:05,573 --> 01:09:07,840
The first big set of data

1214
01:09:07,841 --> 01:09:12,145
was presented
at the end of July.

1215
01:09:12,146 --> 01:09:16,517
The data
has little extra bits in it

1216
01:09:16,518 --> 01:09:19,920
which could be interpreted
as a Higgs.

1217
01:09:19,921 --> 01:09:23,189
Even though the LHC
is running at half power,

1218
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:26,359
it actually has gotten data
much, much faster

1219
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,228
than anybody expected.

1220
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:32,599
And that allowed them to be
sensitive to the Higgs boson.

1221
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,434
It's fucking cool right now.

1222
01:09:34,435 --> 01:09:36,336
There was huge excitement

1223
01:09:36,337 --> 01:09:39,172
because the Higgs' results
of the two main detectors,

1224
01:09:39,173 --> 01:09:41,075
CMS and ATLAS, were first shown,

1225
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:43,410
together, in the same meeting.

1226
01:09:43,411 --> 01:09:45,246
For me, as Run Coordinator,

1227
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:46,815
I discussed every little problem

1228
01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:48,749
where we lost here
a little bit of data

1229
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:50,384
and there a little bit of data,

1230
01:09:50,385 --> 01:09:54,587
so somehow I really feel
attached to this data set.

1231
01:09:54,588 --> 01:09:58,425
So somehow it makes me proud
if the Higgs is found

1232
01:09:58,426 --> 01:10:00,029
or not with this data set.

1233
01:10:01,029 --> 01:10:03,429
- The three, two, ones,
so the effect...

1234
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:06,899
- The mass of the Higgs,
namely the weight of the Higgs,

1235
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,469
can actually tell us
or give us a hint

1236
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:10,804
about what comes next.

1237
01:10:10,805 --> 01:10:16,076
If the mass
is on the lighter side,

1238
01:10:16,077 --> 01:10:19,380
then that's consistent
with some of the standard things

1239
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:20,781
we've been looking for.

1240
01:10:20,782 --> 01:10:24,117
Supersymmetry generally favors

1241
01:10:24,118 --> 01:10:26,219
that the Higgs
is as light as possible.

1242
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:29,255
About 115 times
the mass of the proton.

1243
01:10:29,256 --> 01:10:31,425
It's 115 GeV:

1244
01:10:31,426 --> 01:10:33,394
Giga electron volts.

1245
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:37,797
If, on the other hand,
the Higgs is 140 GeV,

1246
01:10:37,798 --> 01:10:40,466
140 times the mass
of the proton,

1247
01:10:40,467 --> 01:10:41,573
it's a terrible mass,

1248
01:10:42,002 --> 01:10:46,572
because 140 GeV
is associated with theories

1249
01:10:46,573 --> 01:10:48,942
that rely on the multiverse.

1250
01:10:48,943 --> 01:10:51,778
ATLAS has a little bump here,

1251
01:10:51,779 --> 01:10:54,915
a small excess visible near 140.

1252
01:10:54,916 --> 01:10:56,950
And now, holy crap.

1253
01:10:56,951 --> 01:10:58,818
It's 140!

1254
01:10:58,819 --> 01:11:01,921
It's starting to look like
nature has made its choice.

1255
01:11:01,922 --> 01:11:04,157
- What do we learn
if the LHC does discover

1256
01:11:04,158 --> 01:11:06,260
a Higgs at 140 and nothing else?

1257
01:11:06,261 --> 01:11:08,528
Chaos. Okay?

1258
01:11:08,529 --> 01:11:10,163
- The problem
with the multiverse

1259
01:11:10,164 --> 01:11:11,631
is that it says the Higgs

1260
01:11:11,632 --> 01:11:14,002
might be the last particle
we ever see.

1261
01:11:15,002 --> 01:11:18,138
- So what we should do...
- I think the Higgs mass issue...

1262
01:11:18,139 --> 01:11:21,108
- If we don't see any new
particles besides the Higgs,

1263
01:11:21,109 --> 01:11:23,943
we don't get any explanation
for dark matter.

1264
01:11:23,944 --> 01:11:27,348
We don't know
how the Higgs itself got a mass.

1265
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:31,818
We never get access
to the deeper theory.

1266
01:11:31,819 --> 01:11:33,687
All that information

1267
01:11:33,688 --> 01:11:36,827
could be in the other universes.

1268
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:42,528
We may be at the end
of the road.

1269
01:11:42,529 --> 01:11:44,900
That's it.

1270
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:51,407
I guess, um...

1271
01:11:52,407 --> 01:11:56,577
Well, if it's right
at that number,

1272
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:58,578
then it would be
so fucking astounding.

1273
01:11:59,012 --> 01:12:01,047
Where the F is SUSY, right?

1274
01:12:01,048 --> 01:12:02,515
I mean, there's nothing.

1275
01:12:02,516 --> 01:12:03,916
I mean,
where's all the other stuff?

1276
01:12:03,917 --> 01:12:05,318
Where are the other particles?

1277
01:12:05,319 --> 01:12:07,153
What happened to dark matter?
I mean...

1278
01:12:07,154 --> 01:12:08,988
- I've heard of many theories
saying that new particles

1279
01:12:08,989 --> 01:12:10,256
might be
at even higher energies, so...

1280
01:12:10,257 --> 01:12:11,925
Right.

1281
01:12:11,926 --> 01:12:14,161
- Who knows? I mean,
it always comes differently.

1282
01:12:14,162 --> 01:12:15,828
Who knows if there
are other interesting things.

1283
01:12:15,829 --> 01:12:17,363
You know, somehow
it always comes differently

1284
01:12:17,364 --> 01:12:19,032
than you expect.

1285
01:12:19,033 --> 01:12:21,535
- I know that the theorists
are all up in arms,

1286
01:12:21,536 --> 01:12:23,269
because, you know,
it could be a heavy Higgs,

1287
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:24,837
but, you know,
I've always said, like,

1288
01:12:24,838 --> 01:12:26,206
the worst-case scenario,

1289
01:12:26,207 --> 01:12:28,375
I think,
would be Higgs and Higgs only.

1290
01:12:28,376 --> 01:12:29,876
- Who knows?
- I know. I know.

1291
01:12:29,877 --> 01:12:31,511
- Come on,
it's just a little excess.

1292
01:12:31,512 --> 01:12:33,380
- If this doesn't show up
by the end of next year,

1293
01:12:33,381 --> 01:12:34,947
then we can change subject,
I think.

1294
01:12:34,948 --> 01:12:36,950
If you don't see
any supersymmetric signal...

1295
01:12:36,951 --> 01:12:39,185
- Well, but if it's 140,
that would be serious.

1296
01:12:39,186 --> 01:12:40,586
Yeah, yeah.

1297
01:12:40,587 --> 01:12:42,868
Yeah.

1298
01:12:53,868 --> 01:12:55,803
Don't tell me.

1299
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:57,606
This is my nightmare.

1300
01:12:59,606 --> 01:13:02,444
It's only 30 for me.

1301
01:13:06,747 --> 01:13:08,482
At the moment, it's scary.

1302
01:13:08,483 --> 01:13:10,641
- At the moment, it's scary.
- It's scary.

1303
01:13:20,228 --> 01:13:23,429
- Yes, then we have to wait
another couple of years

1304
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:25,569
for the next round.

1305
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:29,841
No, another two years,
I'm saying...

1306
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:35,142
But still, it doesn't matter.

1307
01:13:35,143 --> 01:13:36,514
You'll be working harder.

1308
01:13:39,401 --> 01:13:40,980
No, but independent of that,

1309
01:13:40,981 --> 01:13:45,452
I think you'll know the truth.

1310
01:13:45,453 --> 01:13:47,187
Yes, yes, no.

1311
01:13:47,188 --> 01:13:49,658
- And that's
the important thing.

1312
01:13:50,658 --> 01:13:53,930
No, you're right.
Yes, of course.

1313
01:13:56,930 --> 01:13:58,720
- Coffee
is a very serious business

1314
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,134
in the life of a theorist.

1315
01:14:01,135 --> 01:14:03,269
It's not like physics research,

1316
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:05,138
where you can wait for 30 years

1317
01:14:05,139 --> 01:14:09,776
before you know
if you are right.

1318
01:14:09,777 --> 01:14:13,714
Within a few minutes,
it pays off.

1319
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:17,019
If you succeed, it's great.

1320
01:14:18,019 --> 01:14:20,953
If you fail,
you get to try another one

1321
01:14:20,954 --> 01:14:22,889
in another minute.

1322
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:24,825
In particle physics,

1323
01:14:24,826 --> 01:14:28,828
you construct
a theory 20 years ago,

1324
01:14:28,829 --> 01:14:30,831
and it may take that long

1325
01:14:30,832 --> 01:14:33,867
before you know
if you're on the right track.

1326
01:14:33,868 --> 01:14:36,370
Jumping from failure to failure

1327
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:38,804
with undiminished enthusiasm

1328
01:14:38,805 --> 01:14:42,975
is the big secret to success.

1329
01:14:42,976 --> 01:14:49,316
- Well, the hint
that the Higgs was 140 GeV

1330
01:14:49,317 --> 01:14:52,051
has disappeared.

1331
01:14:52,052 --> 01:14:57,189
All of the new data
that just came in

1332
01:14:57,190 --> 01:14:59,693
didn't make the peak bigger.

1333
01:14:59,694 --> 01:15:02,496
It sort of filled in the gaps.

1334
01:15:02,497 --> 01:15:06,666
And now the peak
doesn't look very good.

1335
01:15:06,667 --> 01:15:10,871
In fact, the belief
is that it's gone away

1336
01:15:10,872 --> 01:15:16,209
and that the Higgs
can't be 140 GeV.

1337
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:19,513
In order for us to believe
that we've discovered it,

1338
01:15:19,514 --> 01:15:21,214
that peak needs to be big

1339
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:24,451
and basically keep growing
as the data comes in.

1340
01:15:24,452 --> 01:15:27,286
It's a statistical thing.

1341
01:15:27,287 --> 01:15:29,723
We call it the Greek letter
"sigma."

1342
01:15:29,724 --> 01:15:33,059
If you reach a height
of 5 sigma,

1343
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:36,462
that's when you know
that you've seen something.

1344
01:15:36,463 --> 01:15:39,933
And the probability that
that just happens by accident

1345
01:15:39,934 --> 01:15:43,440
is 1 in 31/2 million.

1346
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:50,309
But the Higgs, it's not at 140,

1347
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:52,712
which is a bit of a relief,

1348
01:15:52,713 --> 01:15:57,384
because there's still hope
it might be down around 115.

1349
01:15:57,385 --> 01:15:58,986
We like 115,

1350
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:01,388
because if the Higgs
is that light,

1351
01:16:01,389 --> 01:16:04,390
the theory says
there has to be new particles,

1352
01:16:04,391 --> 01:16:06,292
like supersymmetry,

1353
01:16:06,293 --> 01:16:10,964
otherwise the universe
is unstable.

1354
01:16:10,965 --> 01:16:13,768
It wouldn't have survived
this long.

1355
01:16:16,069 --> 01:16:20,139
- This is one of the one
of the few truly perfect

1356
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,774
academic institutions
in the world.

1357
01:16:21,775 --> 01:16:24,077
I mean, there's no excuse...

1358
01:16:24,078 --> 01:16:25,778
no excuse at all...

1359
01:16:25,779 --> 01:16:30,317
not to think and work

1360
01:16:30,318 --> 01:16:31,917
and get things done.

1361
01:16:31,918 --> 01:16:33,252
That's its only problem.

1362
01:16:33,253 --> 01:16:34,854
There's no excuse at all
not to think

1363
01:16:34,855 --> 01:16:36,756
and work and get things done.

1364
01:16:36,757 --> 01:16:38,992
You can't blame it on anything
if it doesn't work.

1365
01:16:38,993 --> 01:16:42,929
- Okay, supersymmetry
versus multiverse.

1366
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:45,166
Oh, boy.

1367
01:16:48,336 --> 01:16:49,769
All right.

1368
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:51,270
That's, uh...

1369
01:16:51,271 --> 01:16:52,672
If we're going to start
doing that,

1370
01:16:52,673 --> 01:16:54,810
this is going to be interesting.

1371
01:16:56,810 --> 01:16:59,645
We have been anticipating
that whatever happens

1372
01:16:59,646 --> 01:17:01,982
is going to throw the field
in one direction or another.

1373
01:17:01,983 --> 01:17:04,785
Oh, shit!

1374
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:06,486
Now that we're really
on the doorstep

1375
01:17:06,487 --> 01:17:09,389
of actually knowing
the actual number,

1376
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:13,661
I really care intensely
about what that number is.

1377
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:29,175
Well, faster than we thought,

1378
01:17:29,176 --> 01:17:32,078
there's news that there's
going to be another announcement

1379
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:34,346
about the Higgs.

1380
01:17:34,347 --> 01:17:36,082
I've heard tons of rumors,

1381
01:17:36,083 --> 01:17:37,983
and I've heard
they're things on blogs,

1382
01:17:37,984 --> 01:17:40,754
and there's already stuff
in the newspaper.

1383
01:17:40,755 --> 01:17:43,355
- 18 hours or so
until the announcement,

1384
01:17:43,356 --> 01:17:47,493
so I'm really looking forward
to what they're going to say,

1385
01:17:47,494 --> 01:17:49,729
and I want to be there.

1386
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:52,364
Actually, I'm thinking
of going early in the morning,

1387
01:17:52,365 --> 01:17:55,234
or I'll send
my young colleagues,

1388
01:17:55,235 --> 01:18:00,607
who have more stamina to sit
and occupy a chair for me.

1389
01:18:00,608 --> 01:18:03,376
It is July 3rd...

1390
01:18:03,377 --> 01:18:06,246
the night of July 3, 2012,

1391
01:18:06,247 --> 01:18:10,550
and I am driving to Princeton,
to the Institute,

1392
01:18:10,551 --> 01:18:13,620
to hang out with Nima
and a big crowd,

1393
01:18:13,621 --> 01:18:17,357
who are all staying up
until 3:00 in the morning

1394
01:18:17,358 --> 01:18:21,761
because they're going to
present the Higgs data at CERN

1395
01:18:21,762 --> 01:18:24,464
at 9:00 in the morning
Geneva time.

1396
01:18:24,465 --> 01:18:26,599
Certainly the biggest thing
that's happened...

1397
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,969
the discovery
of new fundamental particles...

1398
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:30,569
in my lifetime.

1399
01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:33,406
And the Higgs is a particle
like no other,

1400
01:18:33,407 --> 01:18:35,608
like nothing
we've ever seen before,

1401
01:18:35,609 --> 01:18:38,144
and it is weird,
and we do not understand it,

1402
01:18:38,145 --> 01:18:41,480
but...

1403
01:18:41,481 --> 01:18:45,086
but, uh...
and I missed my exit.

1404
01:19:48,949 --> 01:19:54,321
<i>Cinq, six, sept, huit, neuf.</i>

1405
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:55,889
- You need quite some skills
to sit on it.

1406
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:57,389
- It's possible.
- Okay.

1407
01:19:57,390 --> 01:19:58,959
- You know,
there's one ball missing.

1408
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,294
Oh, it's, uh... exactly.

1409
01:20:01,295 --> 01:20:02,862
No, there's one ball missing,

1410
01:20:02,863 --> 01:20:06,666
so it's... you always
think you fall down.

1411
01:20:06,667 --> 01:20:09,169
Okay.

1412
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:11,237
- Look at some of these people,
like, totally asleep.

1413
01:20:11,238 --> 01:20:13,640
- Yeah, no,
those are the sleeping bags.

1414
01:20:32,193 --> 01:20:33,693
My volume is up.

1415
01:20:33,694 --> 01:20:35,528
I don't know why
I'm not getting sound.

1416
01:20:35,529 --> 01:20:38,564
There isn't like, a thing
on here with sound, is there?

1417
01:20:38,565 --> 01:20:41,100
Who reads lips here?

1418
01:20:41,101 --> 01:20:43,603
- Can anyone see
if they get sound?

1419
01:20:43,604 --> 01:20:45,806
Try streaming it
in their offices or something?

1420
01:20:46,006 --> 01:20:48,638
Many apologies, guys.
I don't know what's going on.

1421
01:20:56,383 --> 01:20:58,184
- Ah, Peter Higgs.
- Ah, there he is.

1422
01:20:58,185 --> 01:20:59,921
- Here he is.
- Very good.

1423
01:21:04,524 --> 01:21:07,694
Someone with an iPad.

1424
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,309
- Not as well seated
as my summer student.

1425
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:23,610
- No!
- Right.

1426
01:21:24,774 --> 01:21:26,880
Peter Higgs doesn't even get
a good seat.

1427
01:21:26,881 --> 01:21:29,549
- Good morning,
everybody here in Geneva.

1428
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:31,318
Today is a special day:

1429
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:33,752
we hear two presentations
from the two experiments

1430
01:21:33,753 --> 01:21:35,322
ATLAS and CMS.

1431
01:21:35,323 --> 01:21:37,823
We are starting
in a non-alphabetical order,

1432
01:21:37,824 --> 01:21:42,262
and I ask Joe Incandela
from CMS to take the floor.

1433
01:21:44,631 --> 01:21:45,270
Okay.

1434
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:50,903
Okay.

1435
01:21:50,904 --> 01:21:55,308
So I will give the status
of the CMS Higgs search.

1436
01:21:55,309 --> 01:21:57,811
I want to really dedicate this
to the CMS collaboration.

1437
01:21:58,011 --> 01:21:59,946
This is a picture
we took last week.

1438
01:21:59,947 --> 01:22:01,281
We had a party.

1439
01:22:01,282 --> 01:22:02,948
This is only 400 or 500 people.

1440
01:22:02,949 --> 01:22:05,852
Remember, there are 4,000 people
in the experiment.

1441
01:22:05,853 --> 01:22:08,287
This is not
the real CMS detector.

1442
01:22:08,288 --> 01:22:09,788
That's down underground.

1443
01:22:09,789 --> 01:22:11,842
This is the spare
that we keep upstairs.

1444
01:22:13,761 --> 01:22:15,495
So one page for the theorists.

1445
01:22:15,496 --> 01:22:17,964
That's all they deserve.
No, I'm kidding.

1446
01:22:17,965 --> 01:22:21,434
The Standard Model is here...
is shown here.

1447
01:22:21,435 --> 01:22:24,337
This is what we know.

1448
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:33,381
And we have now...

1449
01:22:44,027 --> 01:22:46,291
But one of the big stories
of this year was,

1450
01:22:46,292 --> 01:22:47,861
as you know...
those of you in the field...

1451
01:22:47,862 --> 01:22:49,228
is pile-up.

1452
01:22:49,229 --> 01:22:51,063
We had to deal
with very intense beams

1453
01:22:51,064 --> 01:22:52,965
like never before seen
in the field

1454
01:22:52,966 --> 01:22:54,200
with many, many interactions,

1455
01:22:54,201 --> 01:22:56,036
and this slide shows...

1456
01:22:56,037 --> 01:23:00,040
the colors correspond to tracks
from different particles.

1457
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:02,041
And it was in these
kind of events

1458
01:23:02,042 --> 01:23:05,545
that we're looking for one of
the rarest particles ever made,

1459
01:23:05,546 --> 01:23:07,515
and that's what we call
the Higgs.

1460
01:23:08,615 --> 01:23:10,683
And so this is where
things stood last week.

1461
01:23:10,684 --> 01:23:13,579
As you know, if you look
at the radiative corrections...

1462
01:23:18,162 --> 01:23:20,426
So if you know the W
and top mass very well,

1463
01:23:20,427 --> 01:23:22,429
you can actually predict
a long band.

1464
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:24,063
- Yeah, yeah,
so we're there at four.

1465
01:23:24,064 --> 01:23:25,564
One at the Tevatron.

1466
01:23:25,565 --> 01:23:27,500
They really had
a tour de force measurement.

1467
01:23:27,501 --> 01:23:31,371
Ah, sorry, yeah, here it is.

1468
01:23:31,372 --> 01:23:33,172
- And we end up
with four event classes...

1469
01:23:33,173 --> 01:23:34,506
Ah, there it is!

1470
01:23:34,507 --> 01:23:36,542
- Okay, so, to wrap up,
in summary:

1471
01:23:36,543 --> 01:23:38,611
we conclude by saying
that we have observed

1472
01:23:38,612 --> 01:23:43,018
a new boson with a mass
of 125.3 plus or minus 0.6 GeV

1473
01:23:44,018 --> 01:23:45,885
at 4.9 standard deviations.

1474
01:23:45,886 --> 01:23:47,121
Thank you.

1475
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:51,758
125.3.

1476
01:23:51,759 --> 01:23:53,225
Okay, so now...

1477
01:23:53,226 --> 01:23:54,029
Wow, 125?

1478
01:23:55,029 --> 01:23:56,451
Do you know ATLAS's result?

1479
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:58,466
This isn't...

1480
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:01,412
You heard about this?

1481
01:24:06,039 --> 01:24:07,806
Okay.

1482
01:24:07,807 --> 01:24:10,376
I think I can only say
congratulations to everybody.

1483
01:24:10,377 --> 01:24:12,812
I will say a few words more
later.

1484
01:24:12,813 --> 01:24:15,982
Now we go immediately to ATLAS.

1485
01:24:15,983 --> 01:24:17,450
Fabiola Gianotti, please.

1486
01:24:17,451 --> 01:24:18,786
Thank you.

1487
01:24:22,489 --> 01:24:23,989
Good morning.

1488
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:28,495
ATLAS is very pleased to present
here today

1489
01:24:28,496 --> 01:24:31,063
updated results
on Standard Model Higgs searches

1490
01:24:31,064 --> 01:24:35,835
based on up to 10.7
inverse femtobarn of data

1491
01:24:35,836 --> 01:24:39,505
recorded in 2011 and 2012,

1492
01:24:39,506 --> 01:24:42,942
and it's a big honor
and a big emotion for me

1493
01:24:42,943 --> 01:24:46,813
to represent this fantastic
collaboration at this occasion.

1494
01:24:46,814 --> 01:24:49,448
So let's go to the results
for this channel.

1495
01:24:49,449 --> 01:24:53,952
You can see here
the results for the 2011 to 2012

1496
01:24:53,953 --> 01:24:56,355
and the combination of the two.

1497
01:24:56,356 --> 01:24:58,424
The gamma jet
and jet-jet background

1498
01:24:58,425 --> 01:25:00,193
with one or both jet...

1499
01:25:00,194 --> 01:25:01,693
requirement that the energy

1500
01:25:01,694 --> 01:25:04,264
in a cone around the photon
is below...

1501
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:06,099
a structure
which reproduces very well

1502
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:08,134
the LHC bunch rate
with three bunch,

1503
01:25:08,135 --> 01:25:09,536
small gaps...

1504
01:25:09,537 --> 01:25:11,222
so then, of course,
we collect...

1505
01:25:17,144 --> 01:25:18,844
Yeah.

1506
01:25:18,845 --> 01:25:22,314
- A few GeV and a few hundred
GeV at the level...

1507
01:25:22,315 --> 01:25:24,517
is fit in the nine
different categories

1508
01:25:24,518 --> 01:25:28,188
with an exponential function
to model the background,

1509
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:29,788
so, no theoretical prediction,

1510
01:25:29,789 --> 01:25:31,858
no Monte Carlo.

1511
01:25:31,859 --> 01:25:34,827
The background is determined
from the side bands

1512
01:25:34,828 --> 01:25:36,062
of the possible signal.

1513
01:25:36,063 --> 01:25:37,964
From this spectrum,

1514
01:25:37,965 --> 01:25:41,401
the background fit,
you get this plot here.

1515
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:43,068
Now the grand combination.

1516
01:25:43,069 --> 01:25:44,636
Here it goes.

1517
01:25:44,637 --> 01:25:46,371
- So this distribution
is extremely clean,

1518
01:25:46,372 --> 01:25:52,745
except one big spike here...
in this region here.

1519
01:25:52,746 --> 01:25:55,881
Excess with a local significance
of 5.0 sigma

1520
01:25:55,882 --> 01:25:59,319
at a mass of 126.5 GeV.

1521
01:26:22,042 --> 01:26:23,743
Good.

1522
01:26:31,385 --> 01:26:34,519
As a layman, I would now say,

1523
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,890
"I think we have it."

1524
01:26:43,930 --> 01:26:47,301
- Come, Lyn, come here.
- Come here!

1525
01:26:57,944 --> 01:26:59,379
Okay.

1526
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:01,281
- There's Peter.
- Peter is there.

1527
01:27:01,282 --> 01:27:03,282
- Yeah. Get Peter.
- Peter's there.

1528
01:27:03,283 --> 01:27:05,085
Peter!

1529
01:27:14,761 --> 01:27:17,397
- Well, I would like to add
my congratulations

1530
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:20,933
to everybody involved
in this tremendous achievement.

1531
01:27:20,934 --> 01:27:25,270
For me, it's really
an incredible thing

1532
01:27:25,271 --> 01:27:27,407
that it has happened
in my lifetime.

1533
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:29,310
- Not only in your lifetime,
Peter.

1534
01:27:39,819 --> 01:27:42,287
That's a great day, huh?

1535
01:27:42,288 --> 01:27:43,689
That's a great day.

1536
01:27:43,690 --> 01:27:45,491
And I think all of us,

1537
01:27:45,492 --> 01:27:48,827
and all of the people
outside watching it

1538
01:27:48,828 --> 01:27:51,096
in the different meeting rooms,

1539
01:27:51,097 --> 01:27:53,933
everybody who was involved
and is involved in the project

1540
01:27:53,934 --> 01:27:55,250
can be proud of this day.

1541
01:27:56,002 --> 01:27:57,304
Okay, enjoy it.

1542
01:28:00,006 --> 01:28:01,641
We found the Higgs!

1543
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:09,047
- Scientists
this morning announced

1544
01:28:09,048 --> 01:28:10,849
they are almost certain
they have discovered

1545
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:12,785
what's being
called the "God Particle."

1546
01:28:12,786 --> 01:28:14,286
It is not every day

1547
01:28:14,287 --> 01:28:15,955
that you see a whole bunch
of scientists

1548
01:28:15,956 --> 01:28:19,157
standing up with champagne
bottles and cheering.

1549
01:28:19,158 --> 01:28:21,327
- Now, the God Particle,
we physicists wince

1550
01:28:21,328 --> 01:28:22,828
when we hear those words...

1551
01:28:22,829 --> 01:28:24,697
- It's the last piece
of the puzzle

1552
01:28:24,698 --> 01:28:26,331
physicists have been looking for
for decades.

1553
01:28:26,332 --> 01:28:27,834
- Thank you all.
- Thank you for your attention.

1554
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:29,335
Thanks to everybody
on the panel.

1555
01:28:29,336 --> 01:28:30,903
If I could just ask you all
to remain seated

1556
01:28:30,904 --> 01:28:32,371
just for a few minutes.

1557
01:28:32,372 --> 01:28:34,639
Clear passage here, please.

1558
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:36,341
Clear passage here, please.

1559
01:28:36,342 --> 01:28:38,678
Can we have a clear passage?

1560
01:28:38,679 --> 01:28:40,246
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1561
01:28:40,247 --> 01:28:41,647
Congratulations.

1562
01:28:41,648 --> 01:28:44,385
Thank you. Thank you.

1563
01:29:15,882 --> 01:29:22,854
- I did feel a sense of pride
when the Higgs was announced,

1564
01:29:22,855 --> 01:29:26,725
but I felt a sense of pride
for humanity,

1565
01:29:26,726 --> 01:29:30,696
that, you know, we little people
on a little planet

1566
01:29:30,697 --> 01:29:32,564
with tiny brains

1567
01:29:32,565 --> 01:29:35,801
can go so deep
and understand what happens.

1568
01:29:35,802 --> 01:29:39,272
Now we're talking
about subnuclear distances

1569
01:29:39,273 --> 01:29:42,241
a thousand times smaller
than an atomic nucleus.

1570
01:29:42,242 --> 01:29:44,743
Nevertheless,
we can get things right,

1571
01:29:44,744 --> 01:29:48,051
and just the power
of the human mind.

1572
01:29:51,051 --> 01:29:55,755
It's astonishing that there are
any laws of nature at all,

1573
01:29:55,756 --> 01:29:59,826
that they're describable
by mathematics,

1574
01:29:59,827 --> 01:30:04,964
that mathematics is a tool
that humans can understand,

1575
01:30:04,965 --> 01:30:09,100
that the laws of nature
can be written on a page.

1576
01:30:09,101 --> 01:30:12,742
It's the greatest
of all mysteries.

1577
01:30:15,742 --> 01:30:22,514
There is a strong sense that we
are hearing nature talk to us.

1578
01:30:22,515 --> 01:30:24,783
Turns out, the Higgs mass

1579
01:30:24,784 --> 01:30:27,286
is about as interesting
as it could be.

1580
01:30:27,287 --> 01:30:30,121
It's sort of in no man's land.

1581
01:30:30,122 --> 01:30:32,291
It doesn't prefer symmetries,

1582
01:30:32,292 --> 01:30:34,160
and it doesn't prefer
multiverse,

1583
01:30:34,161 --> 01:30:35,862
but it's right in the middle.

1584
01:30:35,863 --> 01:30:39,764
The data is puzzling enough

1585
01:30:39,765 --> 01:30:44,636
that it hasn't excluded
any of the theories

1586
01:30:44,637 --> 01:30:46,138
I was involved with,

1587
01:30:46,139 --> 01:30:48,374
but it hasn't
confirmed them either.

1588
01:30:48,375 --> 01:30:52,644
But until we look at detailed
properties of the Higgs,

1589
01:30:52,645 --> 01:30:55,947
and until we have
the high-energy version

1590
01:30:55,948 --> 01:30:59,117
of the LHC in a couple of years,

1591
01:30:59,118 --> 01:31:02,622
we will not be able
to make a stronger statement.

1592
01:31:05,292 --> 01:31:07,158
- The most important,
first lesson

1593
01:31:07,159 --> 01:31:09,228
of the discovery of the Higgs

1594
01:31:09,229 --> 01:31:12,063
is that physics works.

1595
01:31:12,064 --> 01:31:13,733
The Higgs, on the one hand,

1596
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:16,035
completes the most successful
scientific theory

1597
01:31:16,036 --> 01:31:17,370
we've ever had,

1598
01:31:17,371 --> 01:31:19,205
on the other hand,
opens the door

1599
01:31:19,206 --> 01:31:24,577
to some very major paradoxes
that we now must address.

1600
01:31:24,578 --> 01:31:27,479
We're at a fork in the road,
and the LHC

1601
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:30,081
is steadfastly refusing
to push us

1602
01:31:30,082 --> 01:31:32,218
in one direction or the other:

1603
01:31:32,219 --> 01:31:33,986
the multiverse on the one side,

1604
01:31:33,987 --> 01:31:38,590
and some beautiful symmetry
on the other side.

1605
01:31:38,591 --> 01:31:42,402
It's cranking up the suspense
as much as it possibly can.

1606
01:31:48,167 --> 01:31:50,536
- Before the LHC started,
we would always say,

1607
01:31:50,537 --> 01:31:52,904
"New physics
is just around the corner."

1608
01:31:52,905 --> 01:31:54,239
And now we're kind of like,

1609
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,942
"New physics
is still out there."

1610
01:31:55,943 --> 01:31:59,178
And, for one,
I'm not discouraged by this,

1611
01:31:59,179 --> 01:32:02,782
by any means, because we know

1612
01:32:02,783 --> 01:32:04,787
that new physics
has to be out there.

1613
01:32:06,787 --> 01:32:10,456
The next step is,
the LHC goes into a shutdown,

1614
01:32:10,457 --> 01:32:14,126
stays off for two years
for improvements and upgrades,

1615
01:32:14,127 --> 01:32:17,228
and when it returns, it's
going to be twice the energy.

1616
01:32:17,229 --> 01:32:21,037
And for sure,
my vote's for supersymmetry.

1617
01:32:25,037 --> 01:32:26,871
Jesus.

1618
01:32:26,872 --> 01:32:28,140
That was exciting.

1619
01:32:29,408 --> 01:32:31,911
If this is true,

1620
01:32:31,912 --> 01:32:35,747
the Higgs is about 125 GeV,

1621
01:32:35,748 --> 01:32:39,551
and that means...

1622
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:44,055
um, yeah, actually
almost all of my models

1623
01:32:44,056 --> 01:32:45,758
are ruled out,

1624
01:32:45,759 --> 01:32:48,661
which...
all the supersymmetry models,

1625
01:32:48,662 --> 01:32:51,764
which is pretty cool.

1626
01:32:51,765 --> 01:32:54,567
I mean, supersymmetry
could still be true,

1627
01:32:54,568 --> 01:32:59,170
but it would have to be a very
strange version of the theory.

1628
01:32:59,171 --> 01:33:01,573
And if it's the multiverse...

1629
01:33:01,574 --> 01:33:05,277
well, other universes
would be amazing, of course,

1630
01:33:05,278 --> 01:33:10,916
but it could also mean no
other new particles discovered,

1631
01:33:10,917 --> 01:33:14,452
and then
a Higgs with a mass of 125

1632
01:33:14,453 --> 01:33:19,325
is right at a critical point
for the fate of our universe.

1633
01:33:19,326 --> 01:33:21,827
Without any other new particles,

1634
01:33:21,828 --> 01:33:23,962
that Higgs is unstable.

1635
01:33:23,963 --> 01:33:26,032
It's temporary.

1636
01:33:26,033 --> 01:33:29,002
And since the Higgs
holds everything together,

1637
01:33:30,002 --> 01:33:33,943
if the Higgs goes,
everything goes.

1638
01:33:36,943 --> 01:33:38,611
It's amazing that the Higgs,

1639
01:33:38,612 --> 01:33:40,813
the center
of the Standard Model,

1640
01:33:40,814 --> 01:33:42,614
the thing we've all
been looking for,

1641
01:33:42,615 --> 01:33:46,024
could actually also be the thing
that destroys everything.

1642
01:33:51,024 --> 01:33:54,399
The creator and the destroyer.

1643
01:33:59,399 --> 01:34:02,233
But we could discover
new particles,

1644
01:34:02,234 --> 01:34:04,840
and then none of that
would be true.

1645
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:09,895
And anyway,
we have something to do.

1646
01:34:28,895 --> 01:34:33,331
<i>- There is a very nice sentence
in the Divine Comedy by Dante</i>

1647
01:34:33,332 --> 01:34:36,935
<i>who says, "Nati
non fummo a viver come bruti,</i>

1648
01:34:36,936 --> 01:34:40,840
<i>ma per seguir
virtute e canoscenza,"</i>

1649
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:43,175
which means, "We were not born

1650
01:34:43,176 --> 01:34:44,676
"to live as animals,

1651
01:34:44,677 --> 01:34:48,380
but to pursue knowledge
and virtue."

1652
01:34:48,381 --> 01:34:51,082
So science and knowledge
are very important,

1653
01:34:51,083 --> 01:34:54,420
like art is very important.

1654
01:34:54,421 --> 01:34:57,422
It's a need of mankind.

1655
01:34:57,423 --> 01:34:59,959
I just saw, two weeks ago,

1656
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:02,361
Werner Herzog talking about

1657
01:35:02,362 --> 01:35:05,363
and then screening
his new movie.

1658
01:35:05,364 --> 01:35:06,965
But it was about
these incredible caves

1659
01:35:06,966 --> 01:35:09,201
that they discovered
a few years ago in France.

1660
01:35:09,202 --> 01:35:10,702
Stunningly beautiful.

1661
01:35:10,703 --> 01:35:13,906
Gorgeously drawn horses, bison,

1662
01:35:13,907 --> 01:35:16,642
rhinoceros, lions,

1663
01:35:16,643 --> 01:35:18,778
because, 40,000 years ago,

1664
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:20,613
this is what was going on there.

1665
01:35:37,631 --> 01:35:42,334
- In exploration...
- and science is exploration...

1666
01:35:42,335 --> 01:35:45,006
there needs to be
the set of people

1667
01:35:46,006 --> 01:35:47,739
who have no rules,

1668
01:35:47,740 --> 01:35:51,011
and they are going
into the frontier

1669
01:35:52,011 --> 01:35:55,480
and come back
with the strange animals

1670
01:35:55,481 --> 01:35:58,850
and the interesting rocks
and the amazing pictures,

1671
01:35:58,851 --> 01:36:01,653
and to show us what's out there,

1672
01:36:01,654 --> 01:36:03,863
discover something.

1673
01:36:09,863 --> 01:36:12,331
Why do humans do science?

1674
01:36:12,332 --> 01:36:15,033
Why do they do art?

1675
01:36:15,034 --> 01:36:20,339
The things that are least
important for our survival

1676
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:23,000
are the very things
that make us human.
