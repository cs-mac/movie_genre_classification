1
00:00:10,188 --> 00:00:12,622
Right. Something I never knew it. . .

2
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:14,591
I know that there are dictators
around the world. . .

3
00:00:14,591 --> 00:00:17,395
but you knew that some
dictators today. . .

4
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:20,098
apparently, it is assumed,
're addicted to drugs?

5
00:00:20,098 --> 00:00:23,659
This explains many things. Hugo Chavez
admitted in a speech. . .

6
00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:26,498
which, incidentally, was
largely unheralded ...

7
00:00:26,537 --> 00:00:29,233
he chews every day''''cocoa,
morning.

8
00:00:29,273 --> 00:00:32,367
He also eats something
he calls''cocoa paste.''

9
00:00:32,577 --> 00:00:36,013
That's something addictive. And the dictator
Bolivia is your supplier.

10
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:37,748
- What did you say?
- It's "coca."

11
00:00:37,748 --> 00:00:39,317
It's''coca''.
"Ah,''coca''

12
00:00:39,317 --> 00:00:40,807
, Cocoa. . .
Cocoa-would not be problem.

13
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:42,519
SOUTH OF THE BORDER

14
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:45,021
I do not know very well
name drugs.

15
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:48,492
What a shame. For a moment
when he said cocoa. . .

16
00:00:48,492 --> 00:00:51,929
I imagined people all over the country
Cocoa Puffs''spitting''.

17
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:54,332
They thought they would feel
it was great today.

18
00:00:54,332 --> 00:00:56,231
I prefer Ovaltine''''
but now is not time for that.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,469
What she is saying. . .
I also read it.

20
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:03,173
but the reporters wanted to know:
''What is he saying?''

21
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:04,868
He buys cocoa paste''.'' . .

22
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:07,177
-''Coca''!
-''Coca''. Confuse you.

23
00:01:07,177 --> 00:01:08,577
Buy the folder. . .

24
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:11,510
Bolivia! The dictator.
He is also a dictator?

25
00:01:11,882 --> 00:01:15,010
Millions of people watch
these programs regularly.

26
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:17,543
Day and night.
In the United States.

27
00:01:17,687 --> 00:01:20,383
They believe what they see?
I hope not.

28
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:25,857
But broadcasters and press
more serious in the U.S. and Europe ...

29
00:01:25,897 --> 00:01:28,364
follow the advice of Bush ...

30
00:01:28,498 --> 00:01:30,865
and divided the world into friends:

31
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:34,127
That is, leaders who are
we want to do.

32
00:01:34,237 --> 00:01:38,297
And enemies: Leaders who tend
to disagree with us.

33
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,843
Raul Castro
and the dictator Hugo Chavez ...

34
00:01:41,878 --> 00:01:44,573
enemy
the Bush administration.

35
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:46,782
I think we should see. . .

36
00:01:46,782 --> 00:01:49,546
Venezuela's government as
a negative force in this region.

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,945
This is the new Venezuela.

38
00:01:52,022 --> 00:01:54,957
Being built with his own
money derived from petroleum.

39
00:01:55,357 --> 00:01:58,384
Caracas is one of the places
most beautiful of the Americas ...

40
00:01:58,595 --> 00:02:02,326
due to the wise use
of national income from oil.

41
00:02:02,365 --> 00:02:05,959
Approximately half of the profits
derived from oil sales.

42
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:10,496
The domestic policy is to use
oil profits back Condo nation ...

43
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:14,634
buildings for physical,
new industries and public welfare.

44
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,806
After all, made a big mistake
Iraq recently.

45
00:02:18,914 --> 00:02:21,645
And the bigger the lie,
more often it repeats.

46
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:23,719
We have concrete evidence. . .

47
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:27,383
the presence of members
Al Qaeda in Iraq.

48
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:32,895
With the help of the media to repeat
statements of the Bush administration ...

49
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:37,127
over 70% of Americans
're convinced ...

50
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:39,758
that Saddam Hussein
was involved ...

51
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:42,066
the massacre of September 11.

52
00:02:42,104 --> 00:02:44,231
Is there any concrete evidence?

53
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,442
Concrete evidence
is an interesting statement.

54
00:02:47,442 --> 00:02:48,467
The concrete evidence. . .

55
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:51,709
that may come in the form
of a mushroom cloud.

56
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:54,750
Why are we here?
This is the point.

57
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,239
Why are we here,
this war?

58
00:02:56,284 --> 00:02:58,116
Where are the nukes?

59
00:02:58,453 --> 00:03:03,826
Why it took so long for you,
Walt, questioning the vice pres. Dick Cheney?

60
00:03:03,826 --> 00:03:06,996
We waited until 2007
for you piss him off!

61
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:08,792
It's a fair question e. . .

62
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:11,100
I saw Dr. Sanjay Gupta. . .

63
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,124
involved with the troops
early in the war.

64
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:15,971
He and the rest of you
traditional media. . .

65
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:18,530
refuse to ask questions
difficult for our leaders. . .

66
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,709
and demand honest answers.
So we're in this war.

67
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:24,337
Five years at war.
Because you, CNN ...

68
00:03:24,445 --> 00:03:29,076
Dr. Gupta did not do his duty
and now we're in this mess.

69
00:03:30,818 --> 00:03:33,054
The same strategy in Iraq was
Employed ...

70
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:35,079
revolts in South America

71
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:37,680
The electoral victory of Hugo Chavez ...

72
00:03:37,725 --> 00:03:39,318
despite much opposition ...

73
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:42,693
was a triumph
for Venezuelan democracy.

74
00:03:42,897 --> 00:03:45,058
But there is a problem
with democracy.

75
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,601
As it is practiced in the south ...

76
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,637
can topple politicians
who refuse ...

77
00:03:49,637 --> 00:03:51,765
to accept the rules of Washington.

78
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,535
According to our leaders,
the elected president of Venezuela ...

79
00:03:55,643 --> 00:03:59,010
Hugo Chavez, was
and continues to be a dictator.

80
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:02,073
The world's worst dictators:
Hugo Chavez. . .

81
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,919
The Venezuelan president has become
more dangerous than Fidel Castro ...

82
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:07,752
never been to the USA.

83
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:12,123
Exxon Mobil says it was stolen
President Hugo Chavez.

84
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,494
The Latin American strongman.

85
00:04:13,494 --> 00:04:16,263
There is something called a clown
killer. Maybe he is one. . . .

86
00:04:16,263 --> 00:04:17,993
Today, in Latin America.

87
00:04:18,032 --> 00:04:20,329
Hugo Chavez is a dictator.

88
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:21,995
Dictators crooks,
like Hugo Chavez.

89
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:24,772
If he said he hates
Hugo Chavez or Fidel Castro. . .

90
00:04:24,772 --> 00:04:26,273
I would say that I hate these guys.

91
00:04:26,273 --> 00:04:28,475
On the cover of the book you cite
Otto Reich. . .

92
00:04:28,475 --> 00:04:31,511
who was ambassador to Venezuela,
in 80 years. . .

93
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:34,276
who said:''He is more dangerous
than Bin Laden.

94
00:04:34,348 --> 00:04:37,317
And the effects of war
between Chavez and the U.S.. . .

95
00:04:37,317 --> 00:04:39,013
can be worse than September 11.''

96
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:42,147
Chavez supports terrorism
daily.

97
00:04:42,223 --> 00:04:45,192
You're not doing anything
on drug trafficking.

98
00:04:45,258 --> 00:04:48,523
Supports nuclear ambitions
Iran, North Korea.

99
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:52,362
Syria's nuclear ambitions.
He called on Al Qaeda and Hamas. . .

100
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:54,491
to settle in Caracas.

101
00:04:56,236 --> 00:04:59,501
Who is Hugo Chavez?
Where did he come from?

102
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:05,406
The fall of the Berlin Wall ...

103
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:08,446
and the collapse of the Soviet Union
was seen by millions of people ...

104
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:11,645
as the end of every alternative
to Capitalism.

105
00:05:12,352 --> 00:05:16,220
Washington seemed dominated
by an arrogance without triumphs ...

106
00:05:16,255 --> 00:05:19,349
thinking,''Now
We can do whatever we want.''

107
00:05:19,593 --> 00:05:21,361
Let's take a look. . .

108
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:24,626
in a mysterious presence
on the international scene today.

109
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:28,061
This is how the IMF
describes himself.

110
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:32,639
The IMF is an institution
powerful financial ...

111
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,131
which has members in 186 countries ...

112
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:40,110
but it is controlled almost entirely
by the Secretary of the Treasury.

113
00:05:40,647 --> 00:05:44,417
Its support to governments of countries
low income and little ...

114
00:05:44,417 --> 00:05:48,115
is often crucial
Condo political survival.

115
00:05:48,188 --> 00:05:51,954
The IMF tries to keep
a stable global economy ...

116
00:05:51,992 --> 00:05:56,223
with a steady stream of money
between countries with different currencies.

117
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:01,134
The biggest challenge for the newly
discovery domination of Washington ...

118
00:06:01,134 --> 00:06:03,294
came from South America

119
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:07,273
A continent that the IMF
and the Treasury ...

120
00:06:07,273 --> 00:06:09,070
often used
as a lab rat ...

121
00:06:09,175 --> 00:06:11,337
your experiments in economics.

122
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,509
In 1988, the Venezuelan economy
was in chaos.

123
00:06:19,218 --> 00:06:23,280
The minimum wage was downloading
and poverty, the rise for years.

124
00:06:23,323 --> 00:06:26,348
The Venezuelan government was
on his knees asking for help from the IMF.

125
00:06:27,226 --> 00:06:31,856
That attended, dictating
a structural adjustment program ...

126
00:06:32,097 --> 00:06:35,329
guarantee that more money
especially for the poor.

127
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:38,904
When the bus fare
was increased. in 1989 ...

128
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:41,235
obeying the agreement with the IMF ...

129
00:06:41,507 --> 00:06:45,034
Caracas exploded into a fiesta''''
of attacks and looting.

130
00:06:47,245 --> 00:06:50,977
Police opened fire again
in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital. . .

131
00:06:51,117 --> 00:06:53,380
against demonstrators
who were throwing stones.

132
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:55,588
Today is the fourth day of
violent protest. . .

133
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:57,555
against the government's decision
to increase the price. . .

134
00:06:57,655 --> 00:06:59,886
some basic items
consumption.

135
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:02,793
The government called the army.

136
00:07:03,194 --> 00:07:07,324
Hundreds, perhaps thousands
Venezuelans were killed.

137
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:15,462
''They killed my son!''Was the
the woman shouted at the morgue.

138
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:19,810
Relatives anxious look at the list
part with more than 200 names ...

139
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,575
people who were killed.
The morgue is literally ...

140
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:24,809
clogged with bodies
the dead.

141
00:07:25,217 --> 00:07:27,685
That same month,
a group of young officers ...

142
00:07:27,685 --> 00:07:29,482
met secretly
under the command of then ...

143
00:07:29,821 --> 00:07:34,724
Lieutenant Hugo Chavez.
And they condemned the massacre, vowing ...

144
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,590
that would never happen again.

145
00:07:36,994 --> 00:07:39,759
Chavez, say,
dropped with a parachute.

146
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:42,993
It was produced
within the army. . .

147
00:07:43,368 --> 00:07:46,929
when the army killed
their own people.

148
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:49,837
Chavez and a group
of junior officers gathered. . .

149
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:52,410
and said:
No.''were created for this.

150
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,744
Our only purpose is to protect
the country from foreign invasion.''

151
00:08:00,284 --> 00:08:03,686
Exactly three years later,
in February 1992 ...

152
00:08:03,888 --> 00:08:08,621
Chavez launched a failed coup
to overthrow the government.

153
00:08:08,927 --> 00:08:12,157
But the promised attack
never happened.

154
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,966
The Venezuelan government has avoided
Worse, when troops loyal ...

155
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:17,934
dominated a violent blow
midnight.

156
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:19,799
After killing 70 people ...

157
00:08:20,137 --> 00:08:23,834
the rebel troops failed
to overthrow President Perez.

158
00:08:24,308 --> 00:08:27,675
And the great news that I bring
to all Venezuelans. . .

159
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:31,141
is that all outbreaks
been mastered.

160
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:36,077
And they're all arrested,
have surrendered. . .

161
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,289
or because they were captured.

162
00:08:38,323 --> 00:08:41,655
Chavez was caught
and was arrested two years.

163
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:44,822
He assumed full responsibility,
publicly.

164
00:08:44,962 --> 00:08:47,055
Comrades, unfortunately. . .

165
00:08:47,097 --> 00:08:50,123
for now, the goals
we plan. . .

166
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:52,326
were not met
in our capital.

167
00:08:52,636 --> 00:08:55,071
Namely, we
here in Caracas. . . .

168
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:56,831
we can not control the power.

169
00:08:56,872 --> 00:09:00,832
And I, in front of you and the country,
I assume all responsibility. . .

170
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:03,243
this movement
Bolivarian military.

171
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,041
Thank you.

172
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:07,244
No doubt, the coup was illegal.

173
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:11,320
And against the same defenders
democracy that Chávez ...

174
00:09:11,822 --> 00:09:15,519
later, defend the coup
against their own government.

175
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:18,583
Moreover,
not gone unnoticed ...

176
00:09:18,628 --> 00:09:23,930
that the majority of the population
saw Chavez as a hero.

177
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,670
And I guarantee
safely. . .

178
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:31,774
this will be the last time. . .

179
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:36,576
that Venezuela will
by a situation like this.

180
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:40,950
There was much celebration
in the Venezuelan capital, today ...

181
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,682
after the Supreme Court ordered
President Carlos Andres Perez ...

182
00:09:44,855 --> 00:09:47,721
on trial for accusations
fraud.

183
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,584
He is accused of having
stolen $ 17 million from the government.

184
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:58,194
In 1997, Chavez decides
Condo presidential bid.

185
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,569
His greatest opponent is a blonde,
1.83 m, the former Miss Universe.

186
00:10:02,838 --> 00:10:05,705
They begin to call the race
of the Beauty and the Beast.

187
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:08,972
The former Miss Universe employs
trembling platitudes ...

188
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:11,070
while Chavez is
preaching revolution.

189
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,704
And this is what the people want to hear.

190
00:10:12,748 --> 00:10:15,617
In Venezuela, the election Sunday. . .

191
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:18,553
may end in an upset
leftist government.

192
00:10:18,989 --> 00:10:21,479
His supporters called
voting for punishment.

193
00:10:21,524 --> 00:10:24,049
And it took this man to power,
Venezuela.

194
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:27,662
The ex-army
they said go fight ...

195
00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:30,825
against a tradition of corruption
and economic inequality.

196
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,601
In 1998, four years
after being released ...

197
00:10:35,771 --> 00:10:39,342
the inflation rate in Venezuela
reach a record 78% ...

198
00:10:39,342 --> 00:10:42,799
and the government have done more cuts
social spending ...

199
00:10:43,412 --> 00:10:46,438
the body politic was
totally discredited.

200
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,074
Despite opposition from all media ...

201
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:52,880
Hugo Chavez
was elected president.

202
00:10:53,188 --> 00:10:57,025
For someone who led
a coup just six years ago. . .

203
00:10:57,025 --> 00:10:58,618
is so popular for the people?

204
00:10:58,661 --> 00:11:03,530
We live 40 years seeing thieves
dresses politicians.

205
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:07,892
This power that you guys gave me. . .

206
00:11:08,303 --> 00:11:11,932
not belong to me.
This power is of you.

207
00:11:12,107 --> 00:11:14,598
You guys elected the government. . .

208
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,736
that will not be the Chavez government.
Because Chavez is the people.

209
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,645
It will be the people's government!

210
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:28,148
He has promised reforms to raise
living conditions of the poor.

211
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:30,017
Enhance democracy.

212
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:32,726
And share the profits
country's oil ...

213
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:35,924
with those who were never
benefited in the past.

214
00:11:35,964 --> 00:11:39,558
In three years, Chavez
proclaimed Venezuela ...

215
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,535
a Bolivarian Republic.

216
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:43,694
And he began to fulfill his promise.

217
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:47,706
Statues of the beloved Simon Bolivar
The Liberator ...

218
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:50,005
watch his homeland,
Caracas.

219
00:11:50,145 --> 00:11:52,772
He took six South American countries
Condo freedom.

220
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:55,613
Bolivar.

221
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,377
It's a photo of Bolivar. . .

222
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,820
in the fullness of his glory.

223
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:05,523
At its peak, Bolivar. . .

224
00:12:05,827 --> 00:12:07,088
At its peak, Bolivar. . .

225
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:11,522
Peru, with all its glory.

226
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:15,865
Moreover, Bolivar thought
in terms of centuries. . .

227
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:19,733
and saw the world in terms
continents.

228
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:22,568
I'm with you, Chavez!

229
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:29,009
Hello, President!

230
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:44,657
For two consecutive days,
Bush administration officials. . .

231
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:47,929
declare your concern with
the political situation in Venezuela.

232
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:50,630
We are concerned
with some of the actions. . .

233
00:12:50,805 --> 00:12:52,634
Venezuelan President
Chavez. . .

234
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,073
and their understanding of what is
indeed, the democratic system.

235
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,778
Of course, Venezuela is important. . .

236
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,213
it is the third largest producer
oil.

237
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:04,674
I would say that Chávez. . .

238
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,554
and the Department of State
might say that. . .

239
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:10,148
not have good intentions
Compared to the U.S..

240
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:15,053
Chávez's reforms have caused
Resistance of the oligarchy of the country.

241
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:19,861
We have a lying government.
They're a bunch of bastards.

242
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,993
Controlled the Venezuelan media
and used it to stir opposition.

243
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:27,206
Also mobilized officers
within the armed forces ...

244
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:30,607
and received U.S. aid
and Spain.

245
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:36,538
I think the most reasonable
for the president and his cabinet. . .

246
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,353
is to submit his resignation. . .

247
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,343
or disappear from the country.

248
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,486
A business man,
Pedro Carmona ...

249
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,955
was chosen to be
the new president.

250
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:52,589
He was taken to make Spain Condo
measures for the presidential sash.

251
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:56,827
The coup against Chavez had
only one reason: oil.

252
00:13:57,638 --> 00:13:58,933
Bush's plan.

253
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,902
First, Chavez.

254
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,304
Oil.

255
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,736
Second, Saddam.

256
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:11,281
-Iraq.
-The cause of the coup in Venezuela. . .

257
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:16,921
and the invasion of Iraq
is the same: oil.

258
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,849
On April 11, 2002 ...

259
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:25,129
groups of Chavez supporters
and members of the opposition ...

260
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,923
in local marches were
different city.

261
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:31,137
Later, members
opposition decided ...

262
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,838
through the city toward
the Government Palace ...

263
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:36,239
where Chavez supporters
were assembled.

264
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:38,410
He wants us to be like Cuba.

265
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,470
He wants us to be like Cuba.
There's no doubt.

266
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,673
Chavez, go fuck yourself, you dog!

267
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:49,082
As they approached the palace,
suddenly ...

268
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:53,585
shots were fired from buildings,
and members from both sides ...

269
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:55,119
were hit in the head.

270
00:14:56,661 --> 00:15:00,097
On a bridge, supporters
hid ...

271
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:06,036
reciprocated shots of shooters
elite. And against the police ...

272
00:15:06,036 --> 00:15:08,505
who shot them,
two blocks away.

273
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:13,210
The local press shows
Chavez's supporters ...

274
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:18,015
shooting the bridge, then showed
the street where the people were hit ...

275
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,243
by snipers.

276
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:22,920
Manipulating the video to think
that supporters of Chavez ...

277
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,980
had fired the lethal shots.

278
00:15:26,423 --> 00:15:29,085
The press also said
that Chávez himself ...

279
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:32,822
ordered the massacre
and had used to justify ...

280
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:35,957
the coup that was already happening.

281
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:39,830
In the end, it was this that caused
the defeat of Chavez.

282
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:43,668
Armed gangs loyal
Venezuelan President ...

283
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:46,801
shots fired from thousands
of opposition members.

284
00:15:46,844 --> 00:15:50,042
After 16 people killed
and hundreds injured ...

285
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:53,243
last night, soldiers surrounded
the presidential palace.

286
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:56,520
Mr. President,
I was loyal to you.

287
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,886
That is what the leader of the army
said on national television.

288
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:02,016
But the assassination of Venezuelan
today was unbearable.

289
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:04,995
I was under the bridge,
that day.

290
00:16:04,995 --> 00:16:09,432
And I saw the street was empty,
when shots were fired.

291
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:15,060
When I got home and watched CNN
publicizing this and other stations ...

292
00:16:15,104 --> 00:16:16,299
I was shocked.

293
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,502
There was a guy up there,
on the second floor of that building.

294
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:23,769
He started shooting, and many
we got hit in the head.

295
00:16:25,382 --> 00:16:27,246
See you.
There was someone up there. . .

296
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:31,419
shooting people
the bridge on that side.

297
00:16:31,555 --> 00:16:35,218
Shooting at people
who came up on the bridge.

298
00:16:38,194 --> 00:16:40,731
It was a political coup. They're
saying that it was not a coup.

299
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:45,168
It was a political coup.
He was arrested by the army.

300
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:48,830
I saw the face of death.
They were about to kill me.

301
00:16:49,138 --> 00:16:53,234
In front of me. Rifles.
Singled out for me.

302
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,872
In front of me.
Behind me.

303
00:16:56,245 --> 00:16:59,612
And I discussed with them.
Thinking of Che Guevara. . .

304
00:17:01,317 --> 00:17:03,013
who say they died standing.

305
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,155
And inside, I said:
''I'm not asking for forgiveness.

306
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:10,719
Nor mercy.
I'll die standing.''

307
00:17:12,128 --> 00:17:14,653
Most of the American press
endorsed the coup.

308
00:17:14,764 --> 00:17:17,096
The editorial board
The New York Times wrote ...

309
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:20,237
The Venezuelan democracy''
would not be threatened more ...

310
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:22,101
by a guy stuck a dictator.''

311
00:17:22,605 --> 00:17:25,875
This reference to Chavez
unaware of the irony ...

312
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:29,402
what was happening at the hands
of a real dictator.

313
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:37,746
Shall be suspended for the positions of Members
and alternate members of the National Assembly.

314
00:17:38,488 --> 00:17:42,289
Deprive themselves of their positions,
illegally occupied. . .

315
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:46,283
President and other judges
the Supreme Court. . .

316
00:17:47,096 --> 00:17:48,858
District Attorney's Office. . .

317
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:52,994
and members
National Electoral Council.

318
00:17:57,607 --> 00:18:00,258
Leaders of Democratic Action "
(Opposition party) had. . .

319
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:03,262
the Supreme Court
a certificate of insanity. . .

320
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:06,577
the president
Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez.

321
00:18:06,615 --> 00:18:10,186
The press in Venezuela
became part of the opposition. . .

322
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:14,022
in the months preceding the coup.
That is, were participating. . .

323
00:18:14,022 --> 00:18:17,753
and supporting the opposition. Of course,
I'm talking about the private press. . .

324
00:18:17,826 --> 00:18:20,192
that make up the bulk
Venezuelan press reports.

325
00:18:20,362 --> 00:18:22,331
And basically, what they did ...

326
00:18:22,331 --> 00:18:26,401
disclose any testimony that was
opposition that was done ...

327
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:32,806
Chavez is a coward! Coward!
He destroyed Venezuela!

328
00:18:32,841 --> 00:18:36,444
Many analysts said that
was the first blow of the press.

329
00:18:36,444 --> 00:18:40,081
And one of the participants
the coup said. . .

330
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:42,311
Thanks to the press''
by this blow.''

331
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,750
Thanks, Televen. Thanks, CNT.
Thanks, Globovision.

332
00:18:45,786 --> 00:18:47,311
Thanks to the media.

333
00:18:47,355 --> 00:18:49,846
The former presidential candidate,
Irene Saez ...

334
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:53,861
Condo urged the international community
who participated in this transition.

335
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:57,898
Today, I'm asking
the U.S. government. . .

336
00:18:57,898 --> 00:19:00,424
and to all United Nations
and R OAS. . .

337
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:03,831
they see what happened
Venezuela is a crime!

338
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:06,199
They killed innocent people.

339
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,335
And everyone will support
the democratic process. . .

340
00:19:09,411 --> 00:19:11,379
that exists today in our country.

341
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:13,514
FEW HOURS
AFTER THE COUP

342
00:19:13,514 --> 00:19:16,885
The IMF, often slow
to respond to legitimate requests ...

343
00:19:16,885 --> 00:19:20,320
made in Africa starving,
was quick to ...

344
00:19:20,421 --> 00:19:22,549
show support for the coup.

345
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:25,150
I hope that this discussion
can continue. . .

346
00:19:25,292 --> 00:19:26,827
with the new administration.

347
00:19:26,827 --> 00:19:30,064
We are prepared
to help the new government. . .

348
00:19:30,064 --> 00:19:33,261
in any matter
they find important.

349
00:19:33,534 --> 00:19:34,934
The objective was clear.

350
00:19:35,036 --> 00:19:38,527
The IMF was making it clear
that the overthrow of Chavez ...

351
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:41,297
was of great interest
for Global Capitalism.

352
00:19:41,608 --> 00:19:44,976
And there's a reason Washington
is almost smiling.

353
00:19:45,012 --> 00:19:48,349
We import more oil
Venezuela. . .

354
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:50,217
than any other country
OPEC.

355
00:19:50,217 --> 00:19:52,209
The price of oil
lowered enough today ...

356
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:53,921
with the removal of Chavez.

357
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:56,982
The reason for the price
be dramatically lowered ...

358
00:19:57,025 --> 00:20:01,290
probably is
because who replaced Chavez. . .

359
00:20:01,462 --> 00:20:05,558
will be much more sympathetic
to U.S. interests. . .

360
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:08,227
what was this president.

361
00:20:08,636 --> 00:20:10,437
Question why do not you kill me.

362
00:20:10,437 --> 00:20:14,134
They sent to kill me.
But I am a soldier.

363
00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:16,902
I spent half my life
in the military.

364
00:20:17,043 --> 00:20:20,911
And the Venezuelan military,
especially the younger ...

365
00:20:21,848 --> 00:20:23,076
see me as a leader.

366
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:27,987
The news spread.
What happened to the poor ...

367
00:20:27,987 --> 00:20:31,082
who marched dramatically
to the palace, in large numbers?

368
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,751
I voted for Chavez! I
Chavez finish his term!

369
00:20:34,794 --> 00:20:38,628
Because if it is a democracy,
must respect the laws.

370
00:20:38,665 --> 00:20:41,065
The soldiers came to say
its official ...

371
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:42,795
would not support the coup.

372
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,498
The military is
with the people!

373
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:47,333
They surrounded me and protected.

374
00:20:47,641 --> 00:20:52,043
Next, I rescued from the island.
Parachute with helicopters.

375
00:20:52,913 --> 00:20:56,143
I am a paratrooper leader.
They were my men.

376
00:20:56,849 --> 00:21:00,717
They brought me back to the palace,
surrounded by people.

377
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:03,286
CARMONA OUT

378
00:21:03,323 --> 00:21:05,951
Carmon had to flee the palace.

379
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:10,357
A cardinal came Condo island
to where I was stuck. . .

380
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,522
to make me sign
a letter of resignation.

381
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,733
Because Washington was asking
signed a letter of resignation.

382
00:21:16,903 --> 00:21:20,236
I told him:''Let us pray,
because they're coming to my rescue.''

383
00:21:22,942 --> 00:21:24,102
He was afraid.

384
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:26,972
While he was there,
the paratroopers arrived.

385
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,904
Then they carried him back to the palace,
me in the helicopter.

386
00:21:31,117 --> 00:21:35,610
The cardinal has changed sides. Said:
''Yes, we pray, Mr. President.''

387
00:21:42,828 --> 00:21:46,787
Why something so sloppy?
It was a blow shoddy.

388
00:21:47,032 --> 00:21:48,796
Why did not kill him
when caught?

389
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:51,029
He was not heavy weight.

390
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:53,799
Comparing R Guatemala
Argentina to Chile and R.

391
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,902
Venezuela 2000, 2002,
Guatemala is not the 54. . .

392
00:21:58,944 --> 00:22:00,810
and is not the Chile 73.

393
00:22:02,246 --> 00:22:06,981
This is a revolution,
I said, controversial. . .

394
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,887
but armed.

395
00:22:10,055 --> 00:22:14,958
The Venezuelan army is
with his people!

396
00:22:19,196 --> 00:22:22,656
Our president is still
Hugo Chavez.

397
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:32,736
We want Hugo Chavez!
We want Hugo Chavez!

398
00:22:43,754 --> 00:22:45,052
Well, we came back.

399
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:47,248
Good morning everyone.

400
00:22:47,892 --> 00:22:52,420
That we continue moving forward
with calm and prudence.

401
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,122
Continue.

402
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:59,402
The law regards the virtue and honor

403
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:04,067
The editorial committee of New York
Times seemed embarrassed ...

404
00:23:04,107 --> 00:23:06,599
for giving support
the blow to his government.

405
00:23:12,116 --> 00:23:14,518
The White House acknowledged today
that U.S. officials ...

406
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,254
several meetings with
Venezuelan opposition leaders ...

407
00:23:17,254 --> 00:23:20,712
in recent months to discuss
the position of President Chavez.

408
00:23:20,825 --> 00:23:24,463
But he insisted, every time,
signaled that even once ...

409
00:23:24,463 --> 00:23:26,555
that a military option
would be acceptable.

410
00:23:26,597 --> 00:23:28,699
It was expressly stated
the opposition leaders. . .

411
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,429
that the U.S. did not support a coup.

412
00:23:30,469 --> 00:23:32,936
On Friday, it seems
they did just that ...

413
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,805
accepting the successor
Hugo Chávez ...

414
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:37,140
while simultaneously
U.S. allies in the region ...

415
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,008
condemned what they saw,
clearly, as the military coup.

416
00:23:40,478 --> 00:23:43,071
When Chavez returned to power
the very next day ...

417
00:23:43,113 --> 00:23:46,948
The White House seemed to have decided
argued that the blow to democracy.

418
00:23:47,084 --> 00:23:49,814
Some Democrats have called
to it''deeply disturbing''.

419
00:23:49,854 --> 00:23:53,255
It R greater democracy
the world. . .

420
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,881
governments to defend
democratically elected.

421
00:23:55,926 --> 00:23:59,462
I think the U.S. had not
a very enlightened policy. . .

422
00:23:59,462 --> 00:24:01,132
relation R in Venezuela
specifically. . .

423
00:24:01,132 --> 00:24:04,468
to America or America, in general,
throughout the Bush administration.

424
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:06,269
But this incident
in particular ...

425
00:24:06,269 --> 00:24:12,469
it was the worst possible decision
that the U.S. could have taken.

426
00:24:12,509 --> 00:24:17,213
She not only caught a committee
Chavez's administration ...

427
00:24:17,213 --> 00:24:19,782
but has become very difficult
for all Latin America. . .

428
00:24:19,782 --> 00:24:21,375
like the U.S..

429
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:26,257
He says the coup in his country
was devised by the U.S..

430
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:29,058
And some in his administration
say, in fact. . .

431
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:31,891
you had something to do with it.
What he says, to hear this?

432
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:36,628
I have to laugh. Because
For starters, there was no coup.

433
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:40,299
Had there been a coup,
Mr. Chavez would have been eliminated.

434
00:24:40,336 --> 00:24:44,174
There was a complete investigation
Department of State. . .

435
00:24:44,174 --> 00:24:47,075
and there was absolutely
no U.S. involvement. . .

436
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,543
In this action Chavez
calls a coup.

437
00:24:50,647 --> 00:24:54,947
Yes, the U.S. acted, had
people involved in the coup. . .

438
00:24:55,218 --> 00:24:56,411
before it happened.

439
00:24:56,653 --> 00:24:59,522
Involvement of NGOs
US-sponsored ...

440
00:24:59,522 --> 00:25:02,685
some people who have trained
involved in the coup.

441
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:07,931
And in the immediate aftermath of the coup,
the U.S. government said ...

442
00:25:07,931 --> 00:25:10,092
it was a resignation,
not a coup ...

443
00:25:10,233 --> 00:25:13,435
recognizing, in effect,
the government had made. . .

444
00:25:13,435 --> 00:25:16,132
briefly,
Return to President Chavez.

445
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,175
The coup failed.
But just eight months after ...

446
00:25:20,175 --> 00:25:22,879
the company management
national oil started ...

447
00:25:22,879 --> 00:25:27,542
a strike with its workers,
joined by dealers ...

448
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:29,518
who dismissed their employees.

449
00:25:29,518 --> 00:25:33,421
Again, the strike
with support from the private media ...

450
00:25:33,622 --> 00:25:37,718
ruined the economy,
causing serious recession ...

451
00:25:38,094 --> 00:25:41,927
comparable to the worst years
the Great Depression in the U.S..

452
00:25:42,564 --> 00:25:45,965
A general strike by opponents
the government of President Chavez ...

453
00:25:46,368 --> 00:25:49,030
forced the Supreme Court
to stop work today.

454
00:25:49,071 --> 00:25:51,903
The entire oil industry
Venezuela has been closed.

455
00:25:52,241 --> 00:25:55,039
This attempt at opposition
Chavez also failed.

456
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:59,615
In support, the Cubans sent
ten thousand doctors and drug free ...

457
00:25:59,615 --> 00:26:01,583
to open clinics
for the poor.

458
00:26:02,851 --> 00:26:05,445
In an exchange made
between Chavez and Fidel Castro ...

459
00:26:05,487 --> 00:26:11,016
he offered cheap oil
Cuba in exchange for physicians.

460
00:26:12,694 --> 00:26:14,251
Some of these people,
says that medical ...

461
00:26:14,295 --> 00:26:16,320
''I never saw a doctor.''

462
00:26:16,465 --> 00:26:19,127
Chavez to stop talking
it did for reducing poverty. . .

463
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:22,397
which was much smaller
by leaders before him.

464
00:26:22,436 --> 00:26:24,306
One of my colleagues
State Department says. . .

465
00:26:24,306 --> 00:26:27,901
Chavez loves both the poor
that created millions of new poor.

466
00:26:28,242 --> 00:26:31,973
After the government took
control of the oil industry ...

467
00:26:32,146 --> 00:26:35,981
the economy doubled in size
within six years.

468
00:26:36,018 --> 00:26:37,885
Poverty has decreased R half ...

469
00:26:37,885 --> 00:26:40,878
and extreme poverty,
in more than 70%.

470
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:48,160
Here are grown all.
Sorghum, sunflower, corn, beans.

471
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,458
I want to test the model
community property here.

472
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:59,735
For example, a district like this
with a group of families.

473
00:27:00,374 --> 00:27:05,573
"The owner" is perhaps 100 families,
500.

474
00:27:07,248 --> 00:27:13,517
And this group of families owns
this whole area, 200 hectares.

475
00:27:13,688 --> 00:27:17,020
This farm belongs
Condo community.

476
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:27,527
Chavez has a very poor record
in terms of human rights.

477
00:27:27,568 --> 00:27:30,298
The Bush administration
compared him to Hitler.

478
00:27:31,237 --> 00:27:34,070
Human rights have become
new expression of struggle ...

479
00:27:34,107 --> 00:27:36,770
very similar to what was
freedom in the Soviet era.

480
00:27:36,911 --> 00:27:40,004
But here too there
double political standards.

481
00:27:40,146 --> 00:27:43,918
Comparatively, our neighbor
and closest ally in the region ...

482
00:27:43,918 --> 00:27:48,048
Colombia has a record
worse human rights.

483
00:27:49,056 --> 00:27:53,360
But, as President Uribe
is seen as Washington's friend ...

484
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,851
and its war against drug trafficking ...

485
00:27:55,328 --> 00:27:58,229
gain a pass in the media
Chavez does not have that right.

486
00:27:58,866 --> 00:28:01,568
Chavez has made a point
to appear in public ...

487
00:28:01,568 --> 00:28:04,366
with tyrants
that Washington loves to hate.

488
00:28:04,671 --> 00:28:07,440
We are able to eliminate it.

489
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,172
And I believe the time has come
to exercise that capacity.

490
00:28:11,212 --> 00:28:14,339
We do not need another war
$ 200 billion. . .

491
00:28:14,581 --> 00:28:18,449
to get rid
a strong dictator.

492
00:28:18,617 --> 00:28:22,322
It seems to me that in the few days
I spent with you ...

493
00:28:22,322 --> 00:28:24,586
you develop protection
it.

494
00:28:24,624 --> 00:28:27,059
But, in principle, is
he was shocked.

495
00:28:27,093 --> 00:28:32,265
It affected me personally, yes.
It was painful for me.

496
00:28:32,265 --> 00:28:36,668
It pained me to see the lies
and disrespect to the people.

497
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,672
But then I realized
that is a game e. . .

498
00:28:40,672 --> 00:28:42,071
no matter what I do. . .

499
00:28:42,542 --> 00:28:48,606
I can dress as a priest,
with a fine hat on his head. . .

500
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:54,215
'll keep calling me
a tyrant. The people know the truth.

501
00:28:54,521 --> 00:28:58,423
I understand the complicated approach
Chavez.

502
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:03,091
After the coup, began to seem
a little more like a war.

503
00:29:03,128 --> 00:29:05,654
George W. Bush. . .

504
00:29:06,198 --> 00:29:08,496
you are a donkey, Mr. Bush.

505
00:29:11,905 --> 00:29:13,770
Yesterday the devil came here.

506
00:29:19,045 --> 00:29:22,879
And this place still smells like sulfur.

507
00:29:24,516 --> 00:29:26,608
This is your desk,
is where he works.

508
00:29:27,886 --> 00:29:30,684
This is one of my posts
Preferred to work.

509
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:33,155
I've never seen so much energy. Never.

510
00:29:34,493 --> 00:29:37,860
He said he intended to return here,
last night, for work.

511
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:41,689
Yes, I worked last night.
See.

512
00:29:41,868 --> 00:29:43,800
What time was sleep yesterday?

513
00:29:43,835 --> 00:29:47,862
Then, by three in the morning.
Three-thirty.

514
00:29:48,307 --> 00:29:54,303
Worked-up the two?
-Worked, li.

515
00:29:54,513 --> 00:29:58,643
I am obliged to study hard.
I know the team.

516
00:29:59,016 --> 00:30:01,075
It's for fun or pleasure?

517
00:30:03,087 --> 00:30:04,486
All this is a pleasure.

518
00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:07,015
And went to bed reading this book?

519
00:30:08,827 --> 00:30:12,490
That help you have
is boring.

520
00:30:20,873 --> 00:30:27,144
Who does not walk with us
Do not walk with me

521
00:30:27,144 --> 00:30:29,247
The first thing to know
Chavez is on ...

522
00:30:29,247 --> 00:30:32,944
he was born in a shack
literally, and grew up in poverty.

523
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:36,314
And it affected
his vision of Venezuela. . .

524
00:30:36,487 --> 00:30:41,447
and opened his ambition
of life to transform the country.

525
00:30:43,227 --> 00:30:49,064
I was born a hundred yards
there ahead.

526
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:51,529
Welcome to our neighborhood.

527
00:30:53,671 --> 00:30:55,798
Hello, my dear.
How are you, my life?

528
00:30:56,307 --> 00:30:57,501
Look, that girl!

529
00:31:00,078 --> 00:31:02,413
Venezuela has spent 50 years
without a project. . .

530
00:31:02,413 --> 00:31:03,903
but now we have one.

531
00:31:09,086 --> 00:31:12,988
Who is that?
-Ali? My grandmother.

532
00:31:13,024 --> 00:31:13,921
This is the grandmother.

533
00:31:15,126 --> 00:31:19,721
An old picture we recover
of an identity card.

534
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,526
At what age did she die?

535
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,471
She was born 70 years before.
Result, of course. . .

536
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:28,835
so much work.

537
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:34,436
That was where I was born. In a house
palm leaves.

538
00:31:37,315 --> 00:31:39,043
And this is the house where I grew up.

539
00:31:40,249 --> 00:31:41,877
As it was, at age 14?

540
00:31:42,185 --> 00:31:46,588
He was thin. He was very fond
playing baseball.

541
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:48,557
-Baseball?
-Is.

542
00:31:49,527 --> 00:31:50,390
What position?

543
00:31:50,828 --> 00:31:54,422
He played as a pitcher.
And I was at first base.

544
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:59,928
It's always hard to win.
And he just likes to win.

545
00:32:02,372 --> 00:32:05,068
Because he is trying very
to win.

546
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:07,467
We planted fruit trees
here. Tamarind, orange.

547
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:12,046
There was a coffee
and a hornet's nest here.

548
00:32:12,082 --> 00:32:19,453
My grandmother told me to spoon
coffee. You see? I said!

549
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,351
Think back to Hugo.

550
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:31,595
His grandmother is there, behind you.
His grandmother comes to the door.

551
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,899
Can not do that.
I'll cry.

552
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,203
Action!

553
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,888
Oh, no! Broke!

554
00:33:02,365 --> 00:33:03,491
I'll have to pay!

555
00:33:05,501 --> 00:33:06,832
I'll have to pay!

556
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,968
Who is this bike?

557
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:43,104
How's it going, girls?
What are you studying?

558
00:33:44,205 --> 00:33:46,071
Engineering?
She is studying engineering.

559
00:33:47,742 --> 00:33:49,141
Hello, Hugo!

560
00:33:59,321 --> 00:34:02,414
"How many cows do you have?
Ten-giving milk.

561
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,990
Ten, giving milk.
As each cow produces per day?

562
00:34:06,027 --> 00:34:06,894
Four liters each.

563
00:34:06,894 --> 00:34:09,489
Four liters each.
You must increase this production.

564
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,689
The property is yours
and his family.

565
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,826
-Studied until years?
Sixth-grade.

566
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,430
Sixth grade? You must go back to school.
You must seek Ribas mission.

567
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:26,203
When I came to power,
we had to import maize.

568
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:30,508
This is no longer necessary.
We broke records this year.

569
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:37,182
Now, we are building
processing plants.

570
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:40,088
It is here that we are building
Iranian atomic bomb.

571
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:45,054
The pump of corn.

572
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:47,227
The pump of corn.

573
00:34:49,937 --> 00:34:53,531
We process our own corn
in our own plant.

574
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:57,100
We produce flour.
In this case, with the support of Iran.

575
00:34:58,078 --> 00:35:01,276
And sell it very cheap
the poor, the people.

576
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,946
Two hundred years ago,
started a revolution.

577
00:35:10,357 --> 00:35:11,619
Bolivar started ...

578
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,786
releasing all these people
the Spanish empire.

579
00:35:15,997 --> 00:35:18,124
Thus began the dream
of a republic.

580
00:35:19,332 --> 00:35:20,594
Free and sovereign.

581
00:35:21,835 --> 00:35:24,100
But then came
the American empire. . .

582
00:35:26,673 --> 00:35:27,799
Empire and English.

583
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:32,208
And split it into pieces.
Our history is terrible.

584
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:37,543
This continent want to be. . .
We want to be ourselves.

585
00:35:40,154 --> 00:35:41,780
Oliver, I want to show you something.

586
00:35:42,189 --> 00:35:46,649
See that building?
It is an old barracks.

587
00:35:47,193 --> 00:35:50,755
I was there the day
the military rebellion.

588
00:35:50,797 --> 00:35:53,823
On February 4, 1992.

589
00:35:55,301 --> 00:35:57,430
Ali was the headquarters
the rebellion.

590
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:02,264
Our military rebels
Caracas took the palace.

591
00:36:02,742 --> 00:36:06,769
I could have died there.
Some of my men died.

592
00:36:06,847 --> 00:36:11,283
I am strongly connected
àqueles who died that day.

593
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:14,211
Those who died here.

594
00:36:15,088 --> 00:36:20,492
In these windows, there is still
bullet holes that day.

595
00:36:21,661 --> 00:36:23,891
The men who died,
I carry with me.

596
00:36:25,298 --> 00:36:28,061
And this is part
my commitment.

597
00:36:28,784 --> 00:36:31,457
As a former soldier,
I understand you.

598
00:36:37,277 --> 00:36:40,947
The victories of Chavez in Venezuela
began to transform ...

599
00:36:40,947 --> 00:36:44,438
their own country on offer
of hope to others.

600
00:36:44,884 --> 00:36:47,819
Powerful social forces
gathered in the south ...

601
00:36:48,121 --> 00:36:50,554
across national borders.

602
00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:55,356
It seemed that the dream of Simon
Bolivar had begun to realize.

603
00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:00,161
The old oligarchies,
privileged light-skinned ...

604
00:37:00,232 --> 00:37:02,860
prepare to defend
his condition with his strength.

605
00:37:03,135 --> 00:37:08,440
And the new social movements,
indigenous, darker-skinned ...

606
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,998
and, above all, poor.

607
00:37:11,176 --> 00:37:13,508
Chavez advanced today
over a left ...

608
00:37:13,946 --> 00:37:17,142
and proclaims that socialism
is the only way forward ...

609
00:37:17,349 --> 00:37:20,283
attracting other states
South Americans to join ...

610
00:37:20,686 --> 00:37:22,585
Condo Bolivarian revolution.

611
00:37:24,823 --> 00:37:25,585
Gonna come?

612
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:28,822
Legalizing cocaine.

613
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:32,725
This is one of the main items
in the campaign of Evo Morales. . .

614
00:37:32,865 --> 00:37:35,466
a pugnacious leftist
and consistent critic of the U.S. ...

615
00:37:35,466 --> 00:37:37,457
Condo competing presidency
Bolivia.

616
00:37:37,502 --> 00:37:40,734
He is a man who is not friend
the Bush administration.

617
00:37:40,773 --> 00:37:44,140
Evo Morales, who presided
the union of coca growers ...

618
00:37:44,209 --> 00:37:47,075
is the first Indian to be elected
president.

619
00:37:47,312 --> 00:37:50,804
Morales, who called a month ago
President Bush a''terrorist''...

620
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:53,451
is part of a new wave
leftist leaders ...

621
00:37:53,451 --> 00:37:56,254
South America
The stakes here are high.

622
00:37:56,254 --> 00:38:00,350
Bolivia has the second largest
natural gas reserves in South America

623
00:38:01,526 --> 00:38:05,987
The flight from Caracas to La Paz
is a straight line to the south ...

624
00:38:06,464 --> 00:38:07,954
across the Andes.

625
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:12,037
It was Che Guevara in Bolivia
was captured and killed ...

626
00:38:12,037 --> 00:38:18,566
by order of the CIA in 1967.
Forty years later, in 2005 ...

627
00:38:18,909 --> 00:38:24,348
Bolivia, for the first time
elected a leader of the indigenous people ...

628
00:38:24,514 --> 00:38:30,146
or 70% of the population,
Evo Morales as president.

629
00:38:30,355 --> 00:38:34,985
As a leader of coca growers,
Morales was arrested by the oligarchs.

630
00:38:35,394 --> 00:38:39,397
Huge social movements,
in defense of coca ...

631
00:38:39,397 --> 00:38:43,992
order and against privatization
IMF aroused the country.

632
00:38:44,334 --> 00:38:46,137
The government decided to sell. . .

633
00:38:46,137 --> 00:38:49,937
the water supply of Cochabamba
Bechtel, an American company.

634
00:38:50,307 --> 00:38:54,211
And this company, one of the things
she led the government to do. . .

635
00:38:54,211 --> 00:38:57,582
was to pass a law saying that
from then, would be illegal. . .

636
00:38:57,582 --> 00:39:02,352
Rs caves go to the poor
and collect rainwater. . .

637
00:39:02,352 --> 00:39:05,754
because it challenged
its monopoly of water.

638
00:39:05,789 --> 00:39:07,690
Anxiety increases in Bolivia.

639
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:10,193
The government declared
state of emergency ...

640
00:39:10,193 --> 00:39:13,526
after days of protest,
among other things ...

641
00:39:13,563 --> 00:39:15,190
rising water prices.

642
00:39:15,432 --> 00:39:17,992
Five people, at least
were killed.

643
00:39:18,836 --> 00:39:22,272
Movements like this
Morales drove ...

644
00:39:22,272 --> 00:39:24,570
of such movements to power.

645
00:39:24,741 --> 00:39:27,539
Some have called
Revenge of''Che''.

646
00:39:27,676 --> 00:39:30,077
I'm not afraid to say.

647
00:39:30,714 --> 00:39:35,845
I am a big fan of Fidel
and Hugo Chavez.

648
00:39:36,286 --> 00:39:37,650
Others saw it as ...

649
00:39:37,686 --> 00:39:40,884
the victory of truth
against corporate tyranny.

650
00:39:42,325 --> 00:39:45,419
When we landed in La Paz,
we all struggle with the altitude.

651
00:39:45,762 --> 00:39:48,992
It is the international airport
highest in the world.

652
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,411
For generations, the indigenous
chewed coca leaves ...

653
00:40:01,411 --> 00:40:03,709
to relieve
The strain on the body.

654
00:40:03,747 --> 00:40:09,184
It's not the same as cocaine,
as many in the U.S. believe.

655
00:40:09,386 --> 00:40:12,588
Coca leaves have got to be
chemically processed ...

656
00:40:12,588 --> 00:40:15,692
to produce cocaine.
But in its native form ...

657
00:40:15,692 --> 00:40:19,788
has mild stimulant effects,
such as caffeine.

658
00:40:21,031 --> 00:40:25,101
A day later, we still felt
nausea from altitude ...

659
00:40:25,101 --> 00:40:28,093
and President Morales
helped us.

660
00:40:28,137 --> 00:40:30,663
I'm curious if the president
show me. . .

661
00:40:30,973 --> 00:40:33,532
or share with me
a little. . .

662
00:40:34,944 --> 00:40:36,935
These sheets are bad.

663
00:40:37,513 --> 00:40:39,412
These coca leaves
're not good.

664
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:42,082
Are not they?
Really?

665
00:40:42,853 --> 00:40:44,751
They will not do you good.

666
00:40:44,787 --> 00:40:46,311
Will not make you well.

667
00:40:46,688 --> 00:40:48,457
You're the expert.

668
00:40:48,457 --> 00:40:50,651
Must be greener,
not so dark.

669
00:40:50,692 --> 00:40:51,387
So. . .

670
00:40:53,062 --> 00:40:56,326
Washington brought the fight
on drugs for Bolivia. . .

671
00:40:56,364 --> 00:41:00,699
and President Morales expelled
DEA few months ago.

672
00:41:00,803 --> 00:41:03,737
The pretext of fighting
against drug trafficking. . .

673
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,640
that implemented
is a control policy. . .

674
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,179
not only against Bolivia. . .

675
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:12,204
but many others
Latin American countries.

676
00:41:12,615 --> 00:41:14,549
The war on drugs
part. . .

677
00:41:14,549 --> 00:41:17,644
geopolitical interests of
U.S..

678
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:20,188
The war on drugs
part. . .

679
00:41:20,188 --> 00:41:22,282
geopolitical interests of
U.S..

680
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:23,449
Right.

681
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,749
This is better.

682
00:41:26,194 --> 00:41:27,594
It's a control.
-A control.

683
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,256
It consumes so.

684
00:41:29,498 --> 00:41:30,691
It consumes so.

685
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:35,134
I invite you.
The two hands.

686
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,695
I invite you need. . .

687
00:41:39,274 --> 00:41:40,765
Put on your hands.

688
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,268
Hold.

689
00:41:44,078 --> 00:41:44,908
Hold.

690
00:41:44,979 --> 00:41:46,606
Take the talinho. . .

691
00:41:48,683 --> 00:41:49,206
e. . .

692
00:41:52,186 --> 00:41:53,448
What's with the stalks?

693
00:41:54,622 --> 00:41:55,782
It is as safe.

694
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:00,628
It's not just political control.

695
00:42:00,628 --> 00:42:06,123
Now we are told that
plan to commit murder. . .

696
00:42:06,768 --> 00:42:08,259
political leaders.

697
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,839
Members of the Armed Forces
and National Police

698
00:42:09,837 --> 00:42:13,106
we'll denouncing
as

699
00:42:13,107 --> 00:42:18,439
during the past decade,
also in this decade. . .

700
00:42:18,474 --> 00:42:25,175
were planning to end lives,
especially mine.

701
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:29,579
2 months ago, you put out
the American ambassador. . .

702
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:31,948
In October (2008)
there was the expulsion of the ambassador. . .

703
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:36,164
and in November (2008), the Embassy
and the DEA (Narcotics Agency) regulations.

704
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:39,621
How many times have you got arrested!
I was tortured.

705
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:40,326
Tortured.

706
00:42:40,468 --> 00:42:44,494
E-trapped.
Tortured-by what?

707
00:42:44,972 --> 00:42:48,965
I was accused of conspiracy
and revolt.

708
00:42:49,009 --> 00:42:52,639
Tortured by Bolivian soldiers
DEA or the U.S.?

709
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,381
I was tortured
by Bolivian soldiers. . .

710
00:42:54,381 --> 00:42:56,576
but were supervised
by the DEA.

711
00:42:56,617 --> 00:42:58,050
When he was arrested last?

712
00:42:58,118 --> 00:42:59,915
In 1997.

713
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:00,817
In 1997.

714
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:06,357
I was a member, but was
expelled from parliament in 2002.

715
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,191
The plan was to arrest me,
imprison me. . .

716
00:43:11,497 --> 00:43:14,058
and disqualify me
Condo candidate as president.

717
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:16,703
But they failed.
For the first time. . .

718
00:43:16,703 --> 00:43:20,195
not allowed here no
foreign military base.

719
00:43:21,108 --> 00:43:25,010
-There is no now, no?
"If there is now? No.

720
00:43:25,678 --> 00:43:26,781
Before there was now no.

721
00:43:26,781 --> 00:43:28,949
Now he is joining. . .

722
00:43:28,949 --> 00:43:32,180
Condo bad left wing,
to the U.S. media.

723
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:36,087
The media always
attempts to criminalize. . .

724
00:43:36,556 --> 00:43:41,186
the struggle against neoliberalism,
colonialism and imperialism.

725
00:43:41,228 --> 00:43:45,961
It's almost normal,
my worst enemy is the media.

726
00:43:46,033 --> 00:43:49,303
We can say that the goal
the Presidency. . .

727
00:43:49,303 --> 00:43:52,139
will have
their own natural resources?

728
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:54,274
Replenish natural resources. . .

729
00:43:54,274 --> 00:43:57,276
is the base of the economy
worldwide.

730
00:43:57,276 --> 00:43:59,676
As he describes himself?

731
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,913
I feel more like a leader
of a union president.

732
00:44:02,982 --> 00:44:06,350
Because as a manager
There is a constant struggle.

733
00:44:06,653 --> 00:44:07,846
It's a constant struggle.

734
00:44:08,321 --> 00:44:10,517
Sometimes,
Ministers tell me. . .

735
00:44:11,157 --> 00:44:13,090
''You're President,
not say that!''

736
00:44:13,124 --> 00:44:14,854
Including this one deputy minister.

737
00:44:17,497 --> 00:44:19,965
Now I wake up
with green leaves. . .

738
00:44:19,965 --> 00:44:22,636
You can go outside
one instant?

739
00:44:22,636 --> 00:44:24,503
Show whether he is awake,
I do not know if it is.

740
00:44:24,503 --> 00:44:26,232
I always have energy.

741
00:44:26,272 --> 00:44:27,973
I want to play football
with the president. . .

742
00:44:27,973 --> 00:44:30,806
he show me some passes.

743
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:33,710
He likes of Maradona?

744
00:44:38,918 --> 00:44:39,681
In football.

745
00:44:41,787 --> 00:44:42,445
Sure. . .

746
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:53,331
President Morales of Bolivia,
VISIT TO VENEZUELA

747
00:44:53,331 --> 00:44:56,597
The new anti-American triangle
Spanish-speaking ...

748
00:44:56,635 --> 00:44:58,363
Evo Morales of Bolivia ...

749
00:44:58,403 --> 00:45:01,340
Hugo Chávez of Venezuela,
and Fidel Castro of Cuba ...

750
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:04,275
says that the geopolitical map
Latin America ...

751
00:45:04,275 --> 00:45:05,902
is changing
and he's right.

752
00:45:07,113 --> 00:45:10,048
Buenos Aires
capital of Argentina.

753
00:45:10,682 --> 00:45:15,949
A country that has done everything for 50 years
commissioned by the IMF ...

754
00:45:15,987 --> 00:45:17,955
World Bank
and the U.S. Treasury.

755
00:45:18,457 --> 00:45:20,686
In 2001, collapsed.

756
00:45:21,259 --> 00:45:22,317
Banks closed.

757
00:45:22,894 --> 00:45:25,590
Five presidents
fell in two weeks.

758
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:28,326
The president of Argentina
resigned today ...

759
00:45:28,366 --> 00:45:32,427
because of violence sparked Condo
economic downturn.

760
00:45:32,504 --> 00:45:34,199
At least 20 people died.

761
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,174
Now police fight ...

762
00:45:36,174 --> 00:45:38,438
against hundreds
of antigovernment protesters.

763
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,135
Unions call for
a national strike ...

764
00:45:41,246 --> 00:45:46,412
against the austerity measures
and unemployment of almost 20%.

765
00:45:47,285 --> 00:45:48,843
People were Rs streets.

766
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,485
Factories were raided.

767
00:45:50,989 --> 00:45:53,091
In a large park
Buenos Aires ...

768
00:45:53,091 --> 00:45:55,627
union of all
localities, rich and poor ...

769
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,219
met
to discuss his fate.

770
00:45:57,529 --> 00:45:59,997
Nestor Kirchner
was the president ...

771
00:45:59,997 --> 00:46:03,126
and refused to agree
with the IMF conditions ...

772
00:46:03,268 --> 00:46:04,735
forcing them to retreat.

773
00:46:05,335 --> 00:46:08,703
When he finished his term,
his wife Cristina ...

774
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:13,004
with the same spirit Bolivarian
was elected.

775
00:46:14,279 --> 00:46:17,514
It seems to me that
first in the region. . .

776
00:46:17,514 --> 00:46:19,505
leaders look
the governed.

777
00:46:20,418 --> 00:46:23,876
If Bolivia is r
and look at Evo's face. . .

778
00:46:24,655 --> 00:46:26,850
her face is
the face of Bolivia.

779
00:46:28,192 --> 00:46:29,922
It is the first time
it happens.

780
00:46:30,794 --> 00:46:35,754
One of the last
presidents who had. . .

781
00:46:35,799 --> 00:46:40,304
Sanchez de Lozada,
barely spoke Spanish. . .

782
00:46:40,304 --> 00:46:41,794
lived in the U.S..

783
00:46:42,773 --> 00:46:45,765
He had nothing in common
with Bolivians.

784
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:50,873
The other day I spoke
with a journalist, he said. . .

785
00:46:51,013 --> 00:46:54,685
Hugo Chavez wants to export''
their revolution. . .

786
00:46:54,685 --> 00:46:56,914
its changes, its socialism. . .

787
00:46:57,053 --> 00:47:00,257
Condo Latin America
and this should not happen.''

788
00:47:00,257 --> 00:47:01,991
I was told
some European journalists.

789
00:47:01,991 --> 00:47:03,954
That way they think
those colonialists. . .

790
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:06,601
everything that could
in its "colonial lives"

791
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:11,661
and who always treated
installing your ideas

792
00:47:11,661 --> 00:47:14,710
they had in other countries.

793
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:21,011
We who have no experience in the region
internal colonialism of one country over another.

794
00:47:21,011 --> 00:47:25,310
Instead, we suffer
in the hands of colonialism.

795
00:47:25,381 --> 00:47:28,010
I do not think anyone would want
to impose anything.

796
00:47:28,151 --> 00:47:30,015
Instead,
believe in integration. . .

797
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:34,048
respecting differences,
the identity of each country. . .

798
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:37,660
culture and political processes,
ever are the same. . .

799
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:40,095
because we are different people. . .

800
00:47:40,197 --> 00:47:43,997
with companies
and different histories.

801
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:48,201
What do you think the press
call Chavez a dictator?

802
00:47:48,237 --> 00:47:51,974
I think I never experienced
in modern governments. . .

803
00:47:51,974 --> 00:47:53,709
in Latin America or worldwide. . .

804
00:47:53,709 --> 00:47:58,237
an election that many had
like those of Hugo Chavez

805
00:47:58,314 --> 00:48:00,748
I think it's the 13s. election.

806
00:48:01,251 --> 00:48:05,380
I have not seen many dictators
elected 13 consecutive times.

807
00:48:05,421 --> 00:48:07,480
One can agree or not
with what he says. . .

808
00:48:08,258 --> 00:48:11,920
but to say that there's freedom
Venezuela. . .

809
00:48:12,061 --> 00:48:16,225
to say what one thinks,
do not believe it, otherwise.

810
00:48:16,265 --> 00:48:18,392
How many pairs of shoes do you have?

811
00:48:18,434 --> 00:48:20,334
How many pairs of shoes do you have?

812
00:48:20,636 --> 00:48:23,070
I do not know, never told.

813
00:48:24,774 --> 00:48:27,376
I do not understand, never ask
a man. . .

814
00:48:27,376 --> 00:48:31,869
How many pairs of shoes
he has, or pants.

815
00:48:31,913 --> 00:48:35,179
Always ask
women.

816
00:48:35,551 --> 00:48:38,110
Okay, now established
your credit. . .

817
00:48:38,487 --> 00:48:40,648
-Mrs. President.
Thank you.

818
00:48:43,258 --> 00:48:44,521
It is much better indoors.

819
00:48:46,696 --> 00:48:51,734
Bring a photo of May 25, 2003
my desk. . .

820
00:48:51,734 --> 00:48:56,363
when Kirchner took over.
It's a great shot.

821
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,269
I'm with old friends.

822
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:08,479
I want to see,
is really great.

823
00:49:09,919 --> 00:49:11,146
Let's see if the find.

824
00:49:11,785 --> 00:49:15,018
How can men
be so slow, my God.

825
00:49:18,961 --> 00:49:20,155
For how much longer
gonna be here?

826
00:49:27,668 --> 00:49:29,966
This is May 25, 2003.

827
00:49:30,305 --> 00:49:33,274
Kirchner was inaugurated.
Fidel laughing.

828
00:49:34,209 --> 00:49:36,039
And I like the first lady.

829
00:49:36,878 --> 00:49:42,714
Argentina had a recession
terrible between 1998 and 2002.

830
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:48,779
Can you describe
the role of the IMF. . .

831
00:49:48,823 --> 00:49:52,816
and what Argentina did
out of recession?

832
00:49:52,861 --> 00:49:55,262
Terrible was terrible.

833
00:49:55,262 --> 00:49:59,062
The IMF recommended a wave
privatization. . .

834
00:50:00,235 --> 00:50:04,026
non-intervention of the state,
that the market would solve everything.

835
00:50:04,026 --> 00:50:06,064
and maintained the convertibility
(1 peso = 1 dollar)

836
00:50:06,107 --> 00:50:07,708
to maintain this fiction. . .

837
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:13,044
in addition to the country into debt
financially brutally. . .

838
00:50:13,213 --> 00:50:15,113
because the capital was (IMF). . .

839
00:50:15,617 --> 00:50:20,918
and had an interest rate
impressive in Argentina

840
00:50:20,954 --> 00:50:22,752
then they withdrew.

841
00:50:22,791 --> 00:50:27,862
And caused the greatest debt
Argentina's history. . .

842
00:50:27,862 --> 00:50:34,097
that reached up to 160%. . .

843
00:50:34,235 --> 00:50:38,899
He left us 25% of
population without work,

844
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,270
56% poverty. . .

845
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:44,936
over 30%
misery. . .

846
00:50:45,412 --> 00:50:48,903
Finally, everything that can be
considered as a social tragedy.

847
00:50:48,948 --> 00:50:54,053
Then it all explodes
in 2001 and 2002. . .

848
00:50:54,053 --> 00:50:56,190
with a huge
currency devaluation. . .

849
00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:00,354
which meant a huge
transfer of wealth.

850
00:51:00,427 --> 00:51:05,090
That's what Kirchner inherited
on May 25, 2003.

851
00:51:05,265 --> 00:51:09,667
So we started a
policy substantially different. . .

852
00:51:09,702 --> 00:51:12,297
with a big fight with the IMF.

853
00:51:12,339 --> 00:51:13,940
There is a widespread notion ...

854
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,842
that the U.S. has ignored
Latin America ...

855
00:51:15,842 --> 00:51:18,368
and their Chambers of Commerce
helped the rich ...

856
00:51:18,412 --> 00:51:20,242
but wounded
the working poor.

857
00:51:20,413 --> 00:51:22,244
Today, Argentine President ...

858
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:25,011
with worries about the policy
American Chamber of Commerce ...

859
00:51:25,084 --> 00:51:28,714
seemed not to rush to embrace
his U.S. counterpart.

860
00:51:28,856 --> 00:51:31,688
And oddly,
President Bush agreed.

861
00:51:31,724 --> 00:51:34,427
It's not easy to receive
these people.

862
00:51:34,427 --> 00:51:36,793
Maybe it's not easy
I receive.

863
00:51:36,896 --> 00:51:40,697
Many say they played
an innovative role and heroic. . .

864
00:51:41,034 --> 00:51:44,696
to challenge the IMF
the first time. . .

865
00:51:46,172 --> 00:51:47,604
and successfully.

866
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:51,912
I would say that one of the highlights
his personal life. . .

867
00:51:51,912 --> 00:51:56,143
would be the conference with Bush
Mar Del Plata?

868
00:51:56,549 --> 00:52:02,613
I think so. That day,
Latin America defeated. . .

869
00:52:03,756 --> 00:52:07,160
the intentions of the first
world power. . .

870
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:12,623
represented by the policy
President Bush with the FTAA.

871
00:52:12,623 --> 00:52:14,867
And all we act collectively.

872
00:52:14,867 --> 00:52:17,301
Never forget that day.

873
00:52:17,403 --> 00:52:21,270
So much so that kept the chair
that meeting in my house.

874
00:52:22,474 --> 00:52:24,272
That day we had the courage. . .

875
00:52:24,843 --> 00:52:28,074
not to speak over the radio
when man is not. . .

876
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:33,345
or when the representative is
imperial policy is not. . .

877
00:52:33,385 --> 00:52:36,355
but we act collectively
and coordinately.

878
00:52:36,522 --> 00:52:40,321
It was one of the most important steps
we gave in the region.

879
00:52:40,692 --> 00:52:43,092
How when he says''not''
to a banker?

880
00:52:44,462 --> 00:52:49,695
You're subversive, leftist
a thief, scoundrel.

881
00:52:51,236 --> 00:52:52,971
Was there a moment,
like a movie. . .

882
00:52:52,971 --> 00:52:58,410
where one of the main
bankers bent. . .

883
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:00,245
in the eye of the President
and said. . .

884
00:53:00,245 --> 00:53:03,806
Mr.'' Kirchner, realizes
the implications of what he says?''

885
00:53:04,883 --> 00:53:05,646
Always.

886
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:08,608
When one sees political
very friendly. . .

887
00:53:09,921 --> 00:53:12,115
very friendly
these sectors. . .

888
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:14,286
something's not right.

889
00:53:16,428 --> 00:53:18,163
Because these sectors only think
in profitability. . .

890
00:53:18,163 --> 00:53:20,154
and not on society as a whole.

891
00:53:20,532 --> 00:53:24,229
Now, during this mandate
facing the current Chair

892
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:27,072
is a different time
and more difficult.

893
00:53:27,072 --> 00:53:28,972
I had to pull the country out of hell.

894
00:53:29,007 --> 00:53:31,305
The president must do
the economy grows. . .

895
00:53:31,343 --> 00:53:33,743
ensure that the distribution
profit is fair.

896
00:53:33,845 --> 00:53:36,177
The sectors that control
the economy. . .

897
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:39,618
they always want to profit
and never share. . .

898
00:53:39,618 --> 00:53:43,349
they do not want to share,
are the sectors that react.

899
00:53:43,421 --> 00:53:46,490
Corporately respond because
want a country for a few

900
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:49,722
concentrator, where much
just stayed with the Argentine people

901
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,228
President Bush
Condo meeting came ...

902
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,163
talk about your policy
Free Trade ...

903
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:54,932
that says it will help
alleviate poverty ...

904
00:53:54,932 --> 00:53:56,457
and create jobs in the region.

905
00:53:56,501 --> 00:54:00,301
There were some uncomfortable moment
with Pres. Bush that night?

906
00:54:00,338 --> 00:54:03,670
I say there's not kneel
to power. . .

907
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:07,712
be rude not to say
you need to talk. . .

908
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:13,376
àqueles we explored
rs and who opposed our actions.

909
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,180
We had a fight
in Monterrey.

910
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,991
And I said that here the solution
to boost quickly. . .

911
00:54:19,992 --> 00:54:20,993
What is the solution that will be
have to do now

912
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:24,140
would be a Marshall Plan

913
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:27,360
And so he stopped and got angry.

914
00:54:26,462 --> 00:54:30,763
He said it was a crazy idea
the Democrats.

915
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:36,270
And what we have to do here
and the best way to boost it ...

916
00:54:36,572 --> 00:54:40,168
"The U.S. had strengthened
the war, "she said.

917
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:42,037
So he said.

918
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:44,975
The war? He said that?

919
00:54:45,549 --> 00:54:47,413
He said,
were his exact words.

920
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:50,978
He suggested that South America
go to war?

921
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:53,921
He spoke of the USA.
Never said South America

922
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,126
Democrats
were wrong.

923
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,461
Economic growth
U.S.. . .

924
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,258
rs due out several
wars they had.

925
00:55:00,496 --> 00:55:07,266
He was very clear.

926
00:55:07,503 --> 00:55:11,234
President Bush is. . .

927
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,302
Well, it only 6 days left, right?

928
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,070
-Yes.
Thank God.

929
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:23,917
Your work here is
hampered by Hugo Chavez ..

930
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:25,855
Socialist President
Venezuela ...

931
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:29,559
who now had the unusual gesture
to bring the meeting ...

932
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:32,460
the demonstrators in a stadium
Football next.

933
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:35,531
He said he wants to bury
the Free Trade Agreement (AFTA).

934
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:37,624
The FTAA be damned!

935
00:55:39,702 --> 00:55:41,533
From Argentina to Paraguay ...

936
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:46,338
where the ex-bishop Fernando Lugo,
a liberal theologian ...

937
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:51,047
win the election and ended
decades of leadership ...

938
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:54,982
the pro-Washington, the Colorado Party.
.

939
00:55:55,417 --> 00:55:59,650
This is the old palace
of General Stroessner.

940
00:56:00,155 --> 00:56:02,248
The dictator's mansion.

941
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:05,760
My family was persecuted
by Stroessner.

942
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,630
My father was arrested 20 times.

943
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:11,100
It's a paradox I live now
where Stroessner lived.

944
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,123
Can you imagine?

945
00:56:12,801 --> 00:56:15,668
These changes in Latin America
in the last 10 years. . .

946
00:56:15,704 --> 00:56:20,199
were incredible, really.
Especially since 2003, 2004.

947
00:56:20,409 --> 00:56:24,470
This resulted in some form
Liberation Theology?

948
00:56:24,513 --> 00:56:26,072
Yes, certainly. . .

949
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:29,548
believe that the roots of change
in Latin America. . .

950
00:56:29,918 --> 00:56:33,514
began with a
new way of thinking.

951
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:36,758
There are 15 or 20 years,
no one could imagine. . .

952
00:56:36,758 --> 00:56:38,658
that an indigenous
become president. . .

953
00:56:39,628 --> 00:56:42,798
that two women were presidents
of two important countries. . .

954
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:44,698
a metallurgical
would be president. . .

955
00:56:44,866 --> 00:56:46,935
that a military
would be president. . .

956
00:56:46,935 --> 00:56:49,130
and even less that a bishop
would be president.

957
00:56:49,171 --> 00:56:53,300
I believe that here there is a new
political actor, they're social movements.

958
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:56,742
The opposition has effectively
groups. . .

959
00:56:56,944 --> 00:57:01,016
that historically
were privileged in Paraguay. . .

960
00:57:01,016 --> 00:57:05,452
especially after after
61 years of hegemonic party. . .

961
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,883
not have been easy
make changes in the country.

962
00:57:08,089 --> 00:57:11,492
Here is a group that
was privileged historically. . .

963
00:57:11,492 --> 00:57:15,189
government
with the country's resources.

964
00:57:15,697 --> 00:57:19,632
We want are consistent with
the option of Liberation Theology. . .

965
00:57:19,867 --> 00:57:21,630
here if you happen to be privileged. . .

966
00:57:21,736 --> 00:57:23,566
has to be the ones
historically overlooked:

967
00:57:23,604 --> 00:57:28,201
The indigenous, the landless,
the illiterate, those without health

968
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:35,146
they're the ones who now must
be the first to be met.

969
00:57:35,146 --> 00:57:39,227
The changes are having an
Fair administration,

970
00:57:39,228 --> 00:57:40,229
transparency ...

971
00:57:41,455 --> 00:57:44,447
institutions to recover
their dignity. . .

972
00:57:44,658 --> 00:57:47,718
and economic growth,
but with plenty of social equality.

973
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:52,222
I can not get away from
30 years of pastoral care at church.

974
00:57:52,267 --> 00:57:55,531
And we, as Saint Paul said. . .

975
00:57:55,569 --> 00:57:59,004
''One sows, one fertilizes,
farms and other one will reap.''

976
00:57:59,038 --> 00:58:01,405
Is there any phone calls from Paraguay to the IMF?

977
00:58:02,076 --> 00:58:03,408
Yes, we have.

978
00:58:03,445 --> 00:58:07,005
-What is the debt?
-US $ 2.3 billion.

979
00:58:07,047 --> 00:58:10,539
Chavez lent R Argentina
$ 6 billion.

980
00:58:12,987 --> 00:58:14,181
Do not do that.

981
00:58:15,054 --> 00:58:17,181
Chavez would make the loan
if I talked to him.

982
00:58:18,459 --> 00:58:19,426
How old is it?

983
00:58:21,227 --> 00:58:23,252
-57 Years.
"He has time.

984
00:58:23,531 --> 00:58:24,793
He is very good.

985
00:58:26,366 --> 00:58:30,171
Well, Fernando Lugo,
is a very nice man. . .

986
00:58:30,171 --> 00:58:33,503
and a very good man, I think.
I wish you good luck.

987
00:58:34,274 --> 00:58:38,938
Thanks. This is something
that I will always remember.

988
00:58:40,948 --> 00:58:44,007
In Brazil, the changes were
political rather than structural.

989
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:47,020
Lula da Silva was elected
President of Brazil ...

990
00:58:47,188 --> 00:58:50,213
with the largest margin of victory
the country's history.

991
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:52,325
Mr. da Silva is the first
leftist President ...

992
00:58:52,325 --> 00:58:54,816
working class
the country's history.

993
00:58:54,961 --> 00:58:57,397
He was president of union
and political prisoner ...

994
00:58:57,397 --> 00:58:59,456
when the right
ruled Brazil ...

995
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:02,635
which has 9 a. higher
economy in the world ...

996
00:59:02,635 --> 00:59:04,728
and faces an economic crisis.

997
00:59:05,105 --> 00:59:08,005
The Bush administration
supported his opponent.

998
00:59:08,041 --> 00:59:10,874
President Lula was,
leader of the working class.

999
00:59:11,277 --> 00:59:14,269
Lula may not have confronted
IMF directly ...

1000
00:59:14,314 --> 00:59:17,340
but refused any
Brazilian complicity ...

1001
00:59:17,383 --> 00:59:21,376
the destabilization plan
Venezuela or Bolivia.

1002
00:59:21,521 --> 00:59:24,122
Now at the end of his term
as president ...

1003
00:59:24,122 --> 00:59:27,456
I think so combative
as in the beginning.

1004
01:00:29,787 --> 01:00:31,290
Sees the possibility
of a bank. . .

1005
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:34,126
a union of interests
South American Financial. . .

1006
01:00:34,126 --> 01:00:36,923
along the lines of the European Union?
Is it possible?

1007
01:01:28,412 --> 01:01:29,848
Thank you.
Thank you.

1008
01:01:29,848 --> 01:01:32,873
Want to talk to Hugo
the output?

1009
01:01:33,683 --> 01:01:36,017
My brother.
This is my brother.

1010
01:01:41,058 --> 01:01:42,792
The last two presidents
were on my list ...

1011
01:01:42,792 --> 01:01:45,852
Raul Castro, Cuba's ...

1012
01:01:48,165 --> 01:01:50,860
and Rafael Correa
Ecuador.

1013
01:01:51,068 --> 01:01:54,094
Correa shows his
dissatisfaction with Bush. . .

1014
01:01:54,205 --> 01:01:56,729
saying that the policy
U.S. in Latin America ...

1015
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:00,543
is responsible for the appearance
of leftist movements ...

1016
01:02:00,543 --> 01:02:01,874
throughout the region.

1017
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:05,882
When Washington rejected
Correa's requirement ...

1018
01:02:05,882 --> 01:02:09,148
removing the military base
of his country ...

1019
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:12,254
the new president
required equity.

1020
01:02:12,789 --> 01:02:15,486
A military base
Ecuador in Miami.

1021
01:02:15,993 --> 01:02:20,430
Chavez began
a new era in Latin America.

1022
01:02:20,631 --> 01:02:26,537
For us, the moment is
very difficult to make changes. . .

1023
01:02:26,537 --> 01:02:29,061
we want to do
and that the country needs.

1024
01:02:29,105 --> 01:02:31,341
Now that many governments have
friends in the region. . .

1025
01:02:31,341 --> 01:02:32,866
just as President Chavez. .

1026
01:02:33,342 --> 01:02:34,833
President Morales. . .

1027
01:02:34,911 --> 01:02:36,846
the Kirchners in Argentina. . .

1028
01:02:36,846 --> 01:02:38,148
Lula in Brazil. . .

1029
01:02:38,148 --> 01:02:40,617
imagine what it must have been
difficult 10 years ago. . .

1030
01:02:40,617 --> 01:02:42,448
when he (Chavez) was
absolutely alone. . .

1031
01:02:42,553 --> 01:02:45,749
Latin America in a full
of neoliberal governments.

1032
01:02:46,055 --> 01:02:48,319
The main and perhaps only
Chavez's influence

1033
01:02:49,259 --> 01:02:51,022
is that it gave us an example
many things.

1034
01:02:51,728 --> 01:02:53,855
What is your position on
the United States?

1035
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:59,397
We love the USA.
I lived there. I studied there.

1036
01:02:59,536 --> 01:03:01,366
We love the people too
the United States.

1037
01:03:03,006 --> 01:03:05,873
But obviously, the policy
outside the U.S. is questionable.

1038
01:03:05,975 --> 01:03:09,705
So when they wanted
push us to maintain. . .

1039
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:12,511
the basis of their military
in our country. . .

1040
01:03:12,648 --> 01:03:14,490
a base for foreign
not pay a rent,

1041
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:15,811
do not pay anything. . .

1042
01:03:17,654 --> 01:03:20,816
And they accused us of being extremists
not wanted by the base. . .

1043
01:03:20,856 --> 01:03:23,426
If there's no problem having
a base in a foreign country. . .

1044
01:03:23,426 --> 01:03:24,983
established
one condition very straightforward. . .

1045
01:03:25,027 --> 01:03:28,019
would maintain the base
U.S. at Manta. . .

1046
01:03:28,063 --> 01:03:31,430
since the Americans would allow us to
an Ecuadorian base in Miami.

1047
01:03:31,867 --> 01:03:33,503
If there's problems
with foreign bases. . .

1048
01:03:33,503 --> 01:03:34,800
then we can
have one there.

1049
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:38,541
Do you accept the presence
AED in your country?

1050
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:42,511
What they do is
a sort of consulting. . .

1051
01:03:42,511 --> 01:03:47,583
but we are limiting
the influence they had.

1052
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:51,246
They financed large
part of our forces.

1053
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,878
We are changing that.

1054
01:03:53,388 --> 01:03:57,188
Let's follow fighting drugs,
but independently.

1055
01:03:57,259 --> 01:04:00,295
Rafael Correa is now
considered. . .

1056
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:03,388
a left
potentially bad. . .

1057
01:04:03,632 --> 01:04:07,466
with Chavez and Morales.

1058
01:04:07,704 --> 01:04:12,608
He sees this, or thinks it is
favored by the American media?

1059
01:04:12,608 --> 01:04:16,203
With all due respect, knowing
the American media. . .

1060
01:04:16,845 --> 01:04:18,836
I'd be more concerned
if they speak well of me.

1061
01:04:19,014 --> 01:04:19,777
Good night.

1062
01:04:20,014 --> 01:04:22,383
The bad news about plans
murder ...

1063
01:04:22,383 --> 01:04:25,080
was given today by the Committee
Intelligence of the Senate.

1064
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:27,990
The Committee released a report
which states that ...

1065
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:29,491
U.S. government agents ...

1066
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:32,254
initiated plans to kill
Two foreign leaders ...

1067
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,794
engaged in plans
to kill two others ...

1068
01:04:34,897 --> 01:04:36,698
're involved in one more ...

1069
01:04:36,698 --> 01:04:40,566
and that the CIA knew more
Two murder schemes.

1070
01:04:40,601 --> 01:04:42,603
Fidel Castro is alive and well ...

1071
01:04:42,603 --> 01:04:45,232
although 8 of the CIA planes
to kill him ...

1072
01:04:45,407 --> 01:04:47,739
and a plan to harm
your image ...

1073
01:04:47,776 --> 01:04:49,504
making his beard fall.

1074
01:04:49,544 --> 01:04:52,447
Some of the goals of the plans
murder ...

1075
01:04:52,447 --> 01:04:53,748
were very knowledgeable people.

1076
01:04:53,748 --> 01:04:57,844
Che Guevara, Raul Castro,
brother of Fidel Castro of Cuba.

1077
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:02,187
In January, the Revolution,
50. . .

1078
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:07,089
2003, more or less, with
the emergence of Chavez. .

1079
01:05:08,297 --> 01:05:10,457
and his victory after the coup.

1080
01:05:10,598 --> 01:05:13,795
You are the grandfather, godfather (godfather). . .

1081
01:05:15,303 --> 01:05:16,202
and what about this?

1082
01:05:16,202 --> 01:05:20,041
No. Perhaps the first,
but not a sponsor.

1083
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:26,913
're All adults, go alone,
got their own ideas. . .

1084
01:05:26,948 --> 01:05:29,116
and bringing new ideas.

1085
01:05:29,116 --> 01:05:31,586
For example, socialism
21st century.

1086
01:05:31,586 --> 01:05:34,187
What do you think of these heirs?
There is optimism?

1087
01:05:34,187 --> 01:05:37,725
They're not heirs
our spare.

1088
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:40,995
We are all definitely heirs
something, someone.

1089
01:05:40,995 --> 01:05:46,033
Cubans are heirs
the liberators of the Americas. . .

1090
01:05:46,033 --> 01:05:48,263
starting with Bolivar, Sucre. . .

1091
01:05:49,537 --> 01:05:53,064
Toussaint L'Ouverture,
The Haitian.

1092
01:05:53,707 --> 01:05:58,179
The first and only revolution
successful. . .

1093
01:05:58,179 --> 01:06:00,579
led by slaves
in world history.

1094
01:06:00,615 --> 01:06:04,884
We are the heirs of
most recent fights. . .

1095
01:06:04,884 --> 01:06:08,615
other fellow
which fell, like Che Guevara, etc. ..

1096
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:14,153
Now some are young, as
Presidents Correa and Chavez

1097
01:06:14,294 --> 01:06:18,465
But each one is learning
their own knowledge. . .

1098
01:06:18,465 --> 01:06:21,635
and knowledge from the mainland,
of humanity. That's the reality.

1099
01:06:21,635 --> 01:06:24,627
We are not the sponsors,
and they're not the heirs.

1100
01:06:25,739 --> 01:06:31,176
And the Cuban Revolution came
the half-century as a whole.

1101
01:06:31,378 --> 01:06:36,007
And the Cuban people, despite
explosive personality. . .

1102
01:06:36,148 --> 01:06:38,743
learn to be patient.

1103
01:06:38,785 --> 01:06:40,047
And this is an incredible thing.

1104
01:06:40,153 --> 01:06:46,216
And this explosive combination,
As Fidel said of Europeans. . .

1105
01:06:46,626 --> 01:06:48,456
Spanish on our side. . .

1106
01:06:49,461 --> 01:06:52,294
and our African side.

1107
01:06:52,331 --> 01:06:54,390
We are ready to
more than 50 years.

1108
01:07:01,341 --> 01:07:04,376
6 years ago, in January 2003 ...

1109
01:07:04,376 --> 01:07:05,570
been here for
interviewing Fidel ...

1110
01:07:06,146 --> 01:07:07,773
and talked with him
for 3 days.

1111
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,250
He was a lone wolf.
I was isolated ...

1112
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:14,777
the island did not have advertising,
had not corporations. . .

1113
01:07:14,887 --> 01:07:17,447
was a return
the other was.

1114
01:07:17,523 --> 01:07:21,015
He was the mouse that roared,
who fought ...

1115
01:07:21,527 --> 01:07:25,657
80km U.S.
for 50 or 60 years.

1116
01:07:25,698 --> 01:07:27,063
As the old man and the sea.

1117
01:07:27,099 --> 01:07:30,399
As the old man and the sea, is a
sad story of Hemingway.

1118
01:07:31,036 --> 01:07:33,906
The old man leaves, fishing
this giant fish ...

1119
01:07:33,906 --> 01:07:36,239
What is the revolution in 1960.

1120
01:07:37,643 --> 01:07:41,977
And when the coast bring R,
he was eaten by sharks.

1121
01:07:43,315 --> 01:07:47,046
Still, the man
attempted, was noble.

1122
01:07:47,487 --> 01:07:51,690
And so it Hemingway
gave that strength of character. . .

1123
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:56,491
beauty of this loss,
the tragedy of the effort.

1124
01:07:57,096 --> 01:07:59,791
What I like about Castro was
he told us ...

1125
01:07:59,831 --> 01:08:02,596
there is a pendulum in history
that these things change.

1126
01:08:02,735 --> 01:08:04,902
And he saw in a way
strange ...

1127
01:08:04,902 --> 01:08:07,770
this whole thing,
in 2000, would change.

1128
01:08:08,073 --> 01:08:13,305
And hopefully we can see the end
of predatory capitalism.

1129
01:08:13,344 --> 01:08:16,682
I think there
a benign capitalism. . .

1130
01:08:16,682 --> 01:08:19,275
but there is a predatory
that destroys people.

1131
01:08:19,317 --> 01:08:21,047
And we saw it all your life.

1132
01:08:21,253 --> 01:08:24,088
Chavez faces the same
Castro challenges.

1133
01:08:24,088 --> 01:08:25,784
I think it has more allies.

1134
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:29,456
What struck me in him
was the force. It's a bull.

1135
01:08:29,995 --> 01:08:33,765
He has the same strength
Castro had in 2003.

1136
01:08:33,765 --> 01:08:35,665
This is reminiscent of how
Castro was strong.

1137
01:08:35,868 --> 01:08:37,836
He maintained the strength,
Chavez retains power.

1138
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:40,631
Why do you think the U.S.
hate Chavez so much?

1139
01:08:42,107 --> 01:08:46,372
That is obvious. He is a
as big threat to the system. . .

1140
01:08:46,711 --> 01:08:47,974
when Castro was.

1141
01:08:48,046 --> 01:08:50,240
It is a great example, and
if it is successful ...

1142
01:08:50,982 --> 01:08:53,712
be the first time
in the history of Latin America ...

1143
01:08:53,751 --> 01:08:54,877
except for Castro ...

1144
01:08:55,419 --> 01:08:59,788
he took an entire region,
almost every continent. . .

1145
01:09:00,225 --> 01:09:03,887
away from the IMF and the control
U.S. economic.

1146
01:09:06,198 --> 01:09:08,791
Shortly after I returned
North to America ...

1147
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:11,302
another president
entered the scene.

1148
01:09:11,702 --> 01:09:14,364
If there is someone. . .

1149
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:17,505
who still wonders. . .

1150
01:09:17,741 --> 01:09:21,508
The dream of our founders
is alive in our time. . .

1151
01:09:22,747 --> 01:09:26,113
who still questions the power
of our democracy. . .

1152
01:09:26,818 --> 01:09:28,978
tonight is your answer.

1153
01:09:32,355 --> 01:09:37,122
I hope Obama is
a new Roosevelt. . .

1154
01:09:37,728 --> 01:09:39,821
Obama and implant
a''New Deal''. . .

1155
01:09:39,864 --> 01:09:45,358
not only to the U.S., but for
all continents of the world.

1156
01:09:46,102 --> 01:09:49,265
Since virtually all
international organizations ...

1157
01:09:49,306 --> 01:09:52,075
IMF to the Security Council
UN ...

1158
01:09:52,075 --> 01:09:55,807
are controlled in large
part by the U.S. ...

1159
01:09:55,847 --> 01:09:59,784
the new Bolivarian Society
strengthen regional links ...

1160
01:09:59,784 --> 01:10:02,819
to speak with the U.S.
with one voice.

1161
01:10:02,819 --> 01:10:05,789
This happened at a meeting
of hemisphere leaders ...

1162
01:10:05,789 --> 01:10:08,892
in Trinidad where most
South Americans ...

1163
01:10:08,892 --> 01:10:12,692
refused to sign any
document in the absence of Cuba.

1164
01:10:12,762 --> 01:10:17,234
That was not reported with
due respect in the U.S. media.

1165
01:10:17,234 --> 01:10:20,170
If this model is multiply
in other continents ...

1166
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:23,435
American hegemony
will be seriously undermined.

1167
01:10:23,707 --> 01:10:25,537
A Conversation with Chavez

1168
01:10:25,641 --> 01:10:28,236
Good or bad decision
but certainly historic, right?

1169
01:10:29,579 --> 01:10:32,343
My president was
to Trinidad. . .

1170
01:10:32,515 --> 01:10:35,416
and all I got was a
lousy t-shirt of Che Guevara.

1171
01:10:35,619 --> 01:10:39,389
Barack Obama was Summit Condo
of the Americas in Trinidad ...

1172
01:10:39,389 --> 01:10:44,257
and saw the whole continent
supporting Colombia and Mexico ...

1173
01:10:44,527 --> 01:10:45,824
ready to face them.

1174
01:10:45,896 --> 01:10:48,264
Who is the man laughing
President Obama ...

1175
01:10:48,264 --> 01:10:51,131
and why everyone is talking about
about these images?

1176
01:10:51,166 --> 01:10:54,226
Embracing dictators,
the villains ...

1177
01:10:54,303 --> 01:10:58,603
Corrupt politicians, the gang
the Kirchners in Argentina. . .

1178
01:10:58,774 --> 01:11:03,712
Daniel Ortega, Nicaragua,
the biggest pedophile of the West. . .

1179
01:11:03,847 --> 01:11:07,976
what it does is give credibility
U.S. enemies.

1180
01:11:08,017 --> 01:11:12,988
Friends and enemies quickly
will take advantage of a situation. . .

1181
01:11:12,988 --> 01:11:15,116
if they think they're dealing
with a weak president.

1182
01:11:15,158 --> 01:11:17,591
But Obama
not behaved like Bush.

1183
01:11:17,927 --> 01:11:21,555
He met with Chavez
that made him an offer of peace.

1184
01:11:22,398 --> 01:11:24,934
Is unlikely. . .

1185
01:11:24,934 --> 01:11:28,165
as a consequence I have
handshake. . .

1186
01:11:29,305 --> 01:11:33,775
or had a conversation
educated with Mr.. Chavez. .

1187
01:11:33,775 --> 01:11:36,711
we are putting at risk
the U.S. strategic interests.

1188
01:11:36,745 --> 01:11:38,905
In particular,
from what I heard ...

1189
01:11:39,281 --> 01:11:43,240
The new president assured
Chávez that in his government ...

1190
01:11:43,685 --> 01:11:48,248
there will be no further attempts
destabilization ...

1191
01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:51,884
or otherwise interfering
in the internal affairs of Venezuela.

1192
01:11:52,161 --> 01:11:55,095
It is true that this is
a small step forward.

1193
01:12:17,785 --> 01:12:19,587
The 50 years were not in vain.

1194
01:12:19,587 --> 01:12:21,020
Because of this we Chavez. .

1195
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:23,552
we Bolivia. . .

1196
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:30,124
we Nicaragua
Ecuador, Paraguay.

1197
01:12:30,264 --> 01:12:33,757
Some are called
center-left, like Lula.

1198
01:12:34,135 --> 01:12:36,763
It is a great rebellion. . .

1199
01:12:37,071 --> 01:12:39,505
people against imperialism
in Latin America.

1200
01:12:39,707 --> 01:12:43,074
In a multilateral world, can not
have a potency to decide for everyone.

1201
01:12:43,911 --> 01:12:45,776
It's bad for one's potency.

1202
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:50,110
Absolute power is
always bad.

1203
01:12:50,284 --> 01:12:54,015
It's what I always say to Chavez

1204
01:12:54,188 --> 01:12:56,486
I'm very close to Hugh,
he is a friend.

1205
01:12:56,524 --> 01:12:58,287
But I must tell you
collectively building.

1206
01:12:58,692 --> 01:13:02,997
It takes
10 candidates Condo presidency. . .

1207
01:13:02,997 --> 01:13:03,864
can not be just him.

1208
01:13:03,864 --> 01:13:05,832
Otherwise, when he is gone,
the whole process will end.

1209
01:13:06,034 --> 01:13:11,199
The belief that only a
one can guarantee. . .

1210
01:13:11,239 --> 01:13:16,142
is like believing that a single power can
solve all world problems.

1211
01:13:16,444 --> 01:13:21,782
The euphoria and triumphalism that existed
after the fall of the Soviet Union. . .

1212
01:13:21,782 --> 01:13:23,250
virtually disappeared.

1213
01:13:23,284 --> 01:13:28,186
Everybody knows it's a more
difficult to be confronted.

1214
01:13:28,623 --> 01:13:33,461
The size of the Hispanic population
United States. . .

1215
01:13:33,461 --> 01:13:35,520
is now greater than ever.

1216
01:13:35,563 --> 01:13:39,123
The new immigrants serve
Bridge to South America

1217
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:40,902
The interesting question. . .

1218
01:13:40,902 --> 01:13:44,735
that in my moments
Utopian I do. . .

1219
01:13:44,805 --> 01:13:47,603
is whether the changes in America
South. .

1220
01:13:47,774 --> 01:13:53,974
can travel this bridge
Hispanic population in the U.S. ...

1221
01:13:54,014 --> 01:13:57,177
and produce something that no
of us can predict.

1222
01:13:58,551 --> 01:14:01,885
In Venezuela, Bolivia,
Ecuador and Paraguay ...

1223
01:14:02,022 --> 01:14:09,929
95% of the media were completely
hostile to the Bolivarian Circles.

1224
01:14:10,329 --> 01:14:11,557
Still, they won.

1225
01:14:12,665 --> 01:14:16,795
There is a lesson here
to be learned.

1226
01:14:17,337 --> 01:14:18,671
I hear he is a great
admirer ...

1227
01:14:18,671 --> 01:14:22,199
the year 1770, the revolution
Indians against the Spaniards. . .

1228
01:14:22,241 --> 01:14:23,469
Tupac Katari.

1229
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:30,305
Tupac Katari was brutally killed,
quartered by the Spanish Empire.

1230
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:33,941
And the moment that would be
dismembered, he said. . .

1231
01:14:34,187 --> 01:14:37,644
''I die, but one day
come back as millions.''

1232
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:38,952
Now we are millions.

1233
01:14:46,699 --> 01:14:50,499
And perhaps this is one of
things that keeps us going.

1234
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:55,168
The optimism, faith, hope. . .

1235
01:14:55,641 --> 01:15:00,533
and concrete evidence that, yes,
You can change the world,

1236
01:15:00,534 --> 01:15:01,535
change history.

1237
01:15:02,882 --> 01:15:04,372
It is possible, Oliver!
