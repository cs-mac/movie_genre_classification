1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,690
Rage (1963)

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,650
A film in two parts

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,490
The first part is by Pier Paolo Pasolini

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,490
The second part is by Giovanni Guareschi

5
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,410
Two ideologies, two opposite doctrines

6
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,370
answering a dramatic interrogation...

7
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,730
Why is our life dominated

8
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,890
by discontent, anguish, by fear of war, and war itself?

9
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,770
Why is our life dominated

10
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,290
by discontent, anguish, by fear of war, and war itself?

11
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,530
In order to answer this question I have written this film,

12
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,330
not by following any chronological or logical thread,

13
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,570
but rather by following my political beliefs

14
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,290
and my poetic sentiments.

15
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,530
Adieu, we won't foget you,

16
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,290
the Russians are too close,

17
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,890
on November 4th, a storm of fire
and death descends on a people

18
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,250
reclaiming liberty and the respect of being human.

19
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,930
Black winters of Hungary:

20
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,170
the counter-revolution breaks out.

21
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,690
Back cities of Hungary:

22
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,570
the white brothers are killing.

23
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,010
Black memories of Hungary:

24
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,050
the bourgeois brothers don't forgive.

25
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,130
Black peace of Hungary:

26
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,130
the price of blood for Stalin's mistakes,

27
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:12,610
the Austrian secretary of state and the
customs officers pass over to the anti-Russian side.

28
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,690
Black sun of Hungary:

29
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,170
Stalin's mistakes are our own mistakes.

30
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,330
If you don't cry "Long live liberty!" with humility,

31
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,610
you don't cry "Long live liberty"!

32
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,930
If you don't cry "Long live liberty!" with laughter,

33
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,690
you don't cry "Long live liberty"!

34
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,930
If you don't cry "Long live liberty!" with love,

35
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,130
you don't cry "Long live liberty"!

36
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,170
You, children's children,

37
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,810
are crying with contempt,

38
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,250
with rage and with hate

39
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,090
"Long live liberty"!

40
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,370
Thus, you don't cry "Long live liberty"!

41
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,130
Hear me, you children's children,

42
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,490
that you are crying "Long live liberty!"

43
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,170
with contempt, with rage and with hate!

44
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,650
Black evenings of Paris:

45
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,770
the French bourgeoisie makes for the Bastille.

46
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,850
Black boulevards of Paris:

47
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,330
its leaders are marching like colonels.

48
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,810
Black omens of Paris:

49
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,170
liberty has become a pain.

50
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,610
Black noise of Paris:

51
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,570
Bidault already has fashism in his heart.

52
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,290
Black future of Paris:

53
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,610
the French bourgeoisie dies howling.

54
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,570
The funeral procession with
MM. Pineau, Schuman, Bidault and other deputies

55
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,570
depose a wreath at the Arc de Triomphe.

56
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,810
Afterwards the crowd attacks
the French communist party's headquarters

57
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,410
and sets fire to it.

58
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,770
This snow is last year's snow,
or the snow of a 1000 years ago,

59
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,050
or the snow before all hope.

60
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,370
It is our mothers,

61
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,330
our children and grand-children,

62
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,290
our old parents, identical figures

63
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,210
following journeys of tears,

64
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,090
who are crying.

65
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,090
1943, 1944

66
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,210
These are the years

67
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,930
of whiteness, of emigrations.

68
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,530
They weren't gone,

69
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,010
they were still there, with their eternal snows

70
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,890
and their hereditary tears.

71
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,090
Sinister summers of Allah:

72
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,690
Egyptian patrol open fire.

73
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,410
Sinister silences of Allah:

74
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,250
miserable coloured men open fire.

75
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,770
Sinister sun of Allah:

76
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,690
in the name of a 1000 sub-proletarian people.

77
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,850
A new problem bursts into the world:

78
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,810
It's called colour,

79
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,650
it's called colour,

80
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,770
and it spreads throughout the world.

81
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,730
One must admit the thought of
thousands of black or brown children,

82
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,410
black-eyed children

83
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,650
with curly hair on their necks.

84
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,770
Other voices,

85
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,850
other glances,

86
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,130
other dances,

87
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,570
everything will become familiar and will increase the word.

88
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,770
Infinite vistas of real lives claim,

89
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,530
with an innocent ferocity,

90
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,090
to penetrate our reality.

91
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,250
These are the days of joy, the days of victory.

92
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,290
Men of colour, Tunisia is living its liberation.

93
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,130
Prepared by years of misery,

94
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,250
of labour and errors.

95
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,850
Men of colour,

96
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,170
in hope, man has no colour.

97
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,490
Joy after joy, victory after victory!

98
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,130
Men of colour,

99
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,330
Tanganjika is free.

100
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,370
A poor liberty

101
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,330
which makes Europe smile.

102
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,410
Men of colour,

103
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,970
a new African nation is independent.

104
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,250
An elementary liberty

105
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,010
with all the road before you which still has to be traveled.

106
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,370
The only colour: the joy to challenge one's own obscurity.

107
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,610
Cuba is free.

108
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,890
Men of colour,

109
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,170
in victory, the only colour is the colour of mankind!

110
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,250
Victory will demand sweat.

111
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,330
The enemy is among our brothers.

112
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,930
Victory will demand terror.

113
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,810
The brothers submitted by archaic terror.

114
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,450
Victory will provoke injustice.

115
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,090
The brothers, in their ferocity

116
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,890
innocent.

117
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,970
Fighting in Cuba!

118
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,610
Maybe only a song

119
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,410
can tell you what it's like "Fighting in Cuba".

120
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,690
Fighting in Cuba!

121
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,530
Maybe only a dance

122
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,570
can tell you what it's like "Fighting in Cuba".

123
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,010
Fighting in Cuba!

124
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,170
This means fighting

125
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,170
over unexplored seas,

126
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,730
with the ostentation of savage wars.

127
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,050
Fighting in Cuba!

128
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,570
At the present, Cuba is in the world:

129
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,090
Brains in Europe and America

130
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,770
are explaining the meaning of the fighting in Cuba.

131
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,610
A ferocious explanation

132
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,930
which only piety can make human,

133
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,730
in the light of a song.

134
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,570
Fighting in Cuba

135
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,570
a crushing defeat for the enemy.

136
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,570
Dying in Cuba!

137
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,610
Maybe only a song can tell you

138
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,570
what it's like to be dying in Cuba.

139
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,330
Dying in Cuba!

140
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,290
It's like dying in Naples or Sevilla,

141
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,210
with the ostentation of miserable deaths.

142
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,490
Dying in Cuba...

143
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,410
At the present, Cuba is in the world:

144
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,890
brains in Europe and America

145
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,370
are explaining the meaning of dying in Cuba.

146
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,770
A ferocious explanation

147
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,410
which only pity can make human,

148
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,050
in the light of tears.

149
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,130
Dying in Cuba,

150
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,530
joy after joy, victory after victory!

151
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,850
Men of colour from Africa to Cuba!

152
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,370
Men of colour, in victory, man has no colour!

153
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,970
In joy, the only colour

154
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,890
is the colour of mankind.

155
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,210
Voice of futile humour,

156
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,450
of the fear of culture,

157
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:36,810
unchain yourself!

158
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,050
The moment has come!

159
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,490
Let me hear your sigh of relief,

160
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,090
the sound of daily vulgarity.

161
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,770
It seems jazz knows neither frontiers nor limits,

162
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,610
because it unites in a frenetic rhythm

163
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,170
men of all latitudes

164
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,410
and of all beliefs.

165
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,210
All things considered,
Gershwin and Armstrong have defeated Karl Marx.

166
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,890
Ava Gardner likes our country a lot.

167
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,050
As soon as she has the time

168
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,610
between two films, she flies over to Italy.

169
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,610
This year, she came to Rome.

170
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,250
Welcome, Ava!

171
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,890
The very beautiful Sophia Loren,

172
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,850
who at the moment is filming in Polesine with Mario Soldati,

173
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,610
has made a visit with the actress Lise Bourdin

174
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,010
to a fish-canning factory.

175
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,890
The fascinating star is interested in the cleaning of eels

176
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,450
and shows an amused disgust at the spectacle of disembowled fishes.

177
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,410
On the Arno, the four ancient naval republics,

178
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,930
Pisa, Genua, Amalfi et Venice,

179
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,450
evoke a distant period

180
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,450
by displaying a naval competition

181
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,130
before the Predident.

182
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,130
In the streets of Pisa and on the quays

183
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,170
symbolic figures of the four republics pass in procession:

184
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,370
first Amalfi, then Genua,

185
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,610
Venice and Pisa.

186
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,770
Drum rolls, trumpet calls.

187
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,290
Perhaps in many countries,

188
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,290
and certainly in mine which is Italy,

189
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,410
the capital feels its powers coming back,

190
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,770
the day when it can again start buying.

191
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,370
The results, symptomatic,

192
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,570
show a clean, almost crushing victory

193
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,930
of the democratic trade unions.

194
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,050
Buying a worker costs nothing.

195
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,970
It is sufficient to appeal to the nobility of his heart

196
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,970
with a promise of gratitude.

197
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,890
He is a good son and a good father.

198
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,650
And he desperately wants to elevate himself to the rank of the spirit,

199
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,010
to participate the feasts of those who do not live by bread alone.

200
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,490
He can be mean, like a faithful dog,

201
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,370
the desperate white worker,

202
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:28,650
because he knows,

203
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,690
deep down in his conscience,

204
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,930
that he is unworthy.

205
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,090
And in his eyes glitters

206
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,290
the light of envy.

207
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,490
For a red flag betrayed,

208
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,530
a divine effigy regained.

209
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,850
The obscured conscience

210
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,570
does not clamour God,

211
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,690
but His statues.

212
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,130
The terrible power of the Pharisees

213
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,450
consisted in not fearing the banal and the ridiculous.

214
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,930
It is with an astonishing honesty

215
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,690
that they perform their rites.

216
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,210
The divine gift of water for progress

217
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,610
transforms itself into numbers,

218
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,690
For the power plant industry, the fury of a cascade

219
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,170
transforms itself into kilowatts, into ampères.

220
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,810
Once a year, even the factory owners

221
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,810
and the men who measure the natural phenomena,

222
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,850
and who are slaves to dividends, become poets.

223
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,370
Yes, the voice of factory owners,

224
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,250
the voice of feigned impartiality.

225
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,810
They become poets

226
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,370
providing that poetry remains pure form,

227
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,970
voice of the incoercible formalism!

228
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,410
Form!

229
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,610
From now on, the "factory owner turned poet"

230
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,490
has as his flag a painting of abstract art:

231
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,690
the most arrogant form of the absence of the soul.

232
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,330
But... these capes, like mountains of gold,

233
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,890
these crowns, like small petrified souls...

234
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,770
Who could have told, in '45?

235
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:17,570
It would have seemed laughable, inconceivable in a socialist future,

236
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,690
or even in a neo-capitalist future.

237
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,810
Two million people are crowding the streets of London

238
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,850
to see the procession accompanying

239
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,610
Elisabeth II of England to Westminster Abbey

240
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,170
for the coronation ceremony,

241
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,610
2000 years old.

242
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,970
The young sovereign

243
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,490
is presented to the archbishop of Canterbury

244
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,850
who asks her the ritual questions.

245
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,010
Elisabeth answers in the affirmative.

246
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,650
She swears on the bible:

247
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:31,490
"What I have promised, I'll do, so help me God."

248
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,130
Ah, sweet queen,

249
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,090
touching bourgeois wife,

250
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,330
shy even

251
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,930
with her inferiority complex

252
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,210
and her good manners which prevent her being natural.

253
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,650
Ah, the reforms, certainly civil, astonishingly so.

254
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,530
But what will be the future for workers who strike

255
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,090
for the right to a tea-break?

256
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,170
The idyll is hard, sober, severe:

257
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,490
it fears neither the poets' irony,

258
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,210
nor the democrats' unbelief.

259
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,770
But time's prison is terrible,

260
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:26,970
and so is the liberal

261
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,530
and unmovable yoke of history.

262
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,890
And the people shout "God save the Queen!"

263
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,090
In Chicago, in the imposing Convention Hall,

264
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,930
the Republican delegates are united

265
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,730
to name their candidate

266
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,050
for the presidential elections.

267
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,450
The joy of one American who feels himself united

268
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,490
to a million other Americans

269
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,370
in his love of democracy:

270
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,770
that is the illness of the future world!

271
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,490
When the classical world will be exhausted,

272
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,290
when all the peasants and artisans will be dead,

273
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,650
when the industry will have turned round mercilessly

274
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,930
the cycle of production and consumption,

275
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,890
then our history will end.

276
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,130
In these shoutings,

277
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,170
these immense assemblies,

278
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,290
these lights,

279
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,250
these mechanisms, these declarations,

280
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,370
these armies,

281
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,210
these weapons,

282
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,930
in these deserts,

283
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,250
under an unrecognizable sun,

284
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,530
like the new prehistoric age.

285
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:23,490
A warrior leaves, armed with silence,

286
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,970
to a place where history is no longer.

287
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,570
Not one of these crying dignitaries

288
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,930
will know or will want to know

289
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,970
by what necessity and for what reasons

290
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,370
christianity

291
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,210
has been transformed from royal religion

292
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,610
to bourgeois religion.

293
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,450
At present, the bourgeois bow, with their sub-proletarian brothers,

294
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,730
before the coffin of the aristocratic pope,

295
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,090
like on the large square

296
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,330
of an immense and sinister nation.

297
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,090
Roman tradesmen in mourning,

298
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,570
the people with the epileptic gaze of a gypsy,

299
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,610
nondescript Italian burocrats.

300
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,810
It is the crowd of the sixties,

301
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,210
the ebb and tide of our century,

302
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,130
who still need religion,

303
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,490
desperately,

304
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,850
to give meaning to their panic,

305
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:29,130
their mistakes, their hopes.

306
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,450
Will there be white smoke for the popes,

307
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,930
sons of Ghana peasants, or of Uganda,

308
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:45,170
sons of Indian field workers, dead from the pest in the Ganges.

309
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,330
for popes, sons of yellow fishermen,

310
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,810
dead of the cold in Fireland?

311
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,930
The slow death of the peasant world,

312
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,330
who still survives populating continents,

313
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,850
in thousands of swamps,

314
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,210
along shark infested coasts,

315
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,690
on islands carbonized by volcanoes,

316
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,410
it will breathe into this white smoke

317
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,930
the archaic slowness of its existence.

318
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:23,610
Over there, in the future, where years or centuries stretch.

319
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,770
Like the cheating father

320
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:40,610
and the grand-father, drunk on delicious wines,

321
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,570
human figure unknown to the world's sub-proletariat,

322
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,970
but, he too, cultivates the earth,

323
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,410
the new pope,

324
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,650
with his sweet and mysterious smile, like a turtle,

325
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,970
seems to understand that he must be the shepherd of the miserables,

326
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:02,210
because the antique word belongs to them.

327
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,170
It is they who carry, through the centuries

328
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,810
and with him, the history of our greatness.

329
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,930
The Pastor Paganus smiles:

330
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:19,410
Renzo and Lucia are getting married, joy in their eyes.

331
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,370
From now on,

332
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,930
even the baroque arches belong to them,

333
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,090
and the gilded salons of Don Rodrigo,

334
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,250
and the great cathedrals.

335
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:33,890
"The spirit is the heir to the peasant world,

336
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:38,130
"and you, be the shepherd of the antique world

337
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,090
"which lives in this spirit."

338
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:45,090
Are these the words the angel

339
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,490
whispers into the ear

340
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,290
of this sweet pope

341
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,930
with his peasant and mysterious face?

342
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,650
A nation starting again on its history,

343
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,450
gives its people back, first of all,

344
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,250
the humility to resemble their fathers in all innocence.

345
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,410
Tradition, that is greatness expressed in just one gesture.

346
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:24,450
A thousand ancestors have seen this gesture, and through the centuries

347
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,730
it has become pure like the flight of a bird,

348
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,690
elementary like the movement of a wave.

349
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,930
But only the revolution can save the past.

350
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,570
Lucky are the sons

351
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,050
whose fathers were serfs in the clod,

352
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:46,370
the sons who can say: "My father has often laughed

353
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:47,970
"in his village,

354
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,490
"where his lord and the Zar's burocrats

355
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,850
"have starved him for centuries.

356
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,050
"The puritanical violence of my laughter,

357
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,650
"the theatrical ingenuity,

358
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:01,130
"of what amuses me in my village, in my factory,

359
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,650
"he gave this to me!"

360
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,250
Lucky the sons whose fathers were heroes,

361
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,410
those sons can say: "My father has fought

362
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,010
"against the Zar and against the capital.

363
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,730
"My freedom, he gave it to me,

364
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,090
"the earth I cultivate,

365
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,330
"the factory where I work,

366
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,810
"he gave them to me.

367
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,970
"The places where I enjoy my youth, he gave them to me.

368
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,970
" I can be proud to resemble him

369
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:37,210
"and to resemble him always."

370
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,250
In a small town in the USSR

371
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,490
I want to enjoy life intensely,

372
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,250
I want to do what has been forbidden for centuries

373
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,130
and what the youths of my province, richer than me,

374
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,450
have done for centuries.

375
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:59,130
I want to see dances, social events, spectacles,

376
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,290
everything the fathers of my ideal have seen,

377
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,730
and not the fathers of my flesh.

378
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,930
And I am proud to put on afterwards my poor worker's rags,

379
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:14,770
in the morning, under the boiling sun of my province,

380
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,530
of my village!

381
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,050
Everything the fathers of my ideal have had,

382
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:26,890
what the father of my flesh did not have,
and what I desire so much,

383
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,690
I want to have it.

384
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:32,650
I want to acquire traditional culture,

385
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,530
I want to own what is beautiful and noble,

386
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,690
what I have been deprived of for centuries.

387
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:50,170
I want to learn with the spirit of a good-willing father,

388
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,930
I want to read like a young father,

389
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,890
I want to know with the heart of a religious father.

390
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,650
With obedience, for I am the first educated son

391
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,970
of a line of men who had nothing else but

392
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:08,290
callous hands and the bullets of capital in the chest.

393
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:12,490
I can do it, for the first time in the history of my nation,

394
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,490
me, son of the people.

395
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,090
And I want to listen to the voice of culture,

396
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:18,970
of science,

397
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,650
of art.

398
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,090
Young comrades, I...

399
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,610
I am here in the name of our committee,

400
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:32,970
and I will teach you, eager to learn,

401
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,770
the glories of Soviet painting.

402
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,890
And that's what I'll do,

403
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,170
like in Stalin's time, I'll do my duty as Cicérone:

404
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,770
"Look how well they are painted,

405
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,890
"our mine worker comrades,

406
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,810
"our kolkhoz comrades."

407
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,650
This is what I'll tell you.

408
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,370
However, something is heavy in my official's heart,

409
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,130
who does his duty like in Stalin's time.

410
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,770
It's a terrible weight, young comrades,

411
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,090
for it's the weight of truth which exists,

412
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,330
even if you don't say it.

413
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,530
These paintings, surely,

414
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,250
are full or our ingenuity,

415
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,890
of our brotherly feelings

416
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,890
which make life so beautiful and friendly,

417
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:23,170
but...

418
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:28,090
I am trembling to say it, like a comical character in Chekhov,

419
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:32,890
or a boy talking about love for the first time with his father,

420
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,210
in these paintings there are our errors,

421
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:40,530
we should take them off these walls and put them in the depot,

422
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,290
say good-bye to them, like to a period of our lives.

423
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,770
We should start again from the beginning,
where certainty didn't exist,

424
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:52,810
where the sign is desperate, and the colour crying,

425
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:57,290
where the bodies are convulsed like the cadavers of Buchenwald,

426
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,490
where a red banner is floating

427
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:03,330
to the sound of a victory which must never be the last one,

428
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,370
because the struggle of the classes is not over yet.

429
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,090
We are not Russians,

430
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,850
we are those who fight:

431
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,010
Spanish or Italian workers,

432
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:15,850
French intellectuals, Algerian partisans...

433
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,090
We are not in Moskow or Leningrad,

434
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,530
but in the factories where the struggle of the classes is fought,

435
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:27,450
in the deserts of the colonies
where the fight for freedom is fought.

436
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:35,370
Who would say that the profound feeling of liberty

437
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,330
is alive in men's hearts

438
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,130
with such humble faces?

439
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,730
Humble, like the remote corners of the earth,

440
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,330
where one works the earth or plunders it,

441
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,610
wearing the rags of the fathers,

442
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:53,210
humble faces of the sons,

443
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:56,490
born without necessity.

444
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,250
However,

445
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:02,130
behind these faces, of hungry men, bandits,

446
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,410
lies this terrible sentiment

447
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,570
which is called liberty in France.

448
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,570
A son, among others, who has only one face,

449
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,210
tormented for centuries,

450
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:19,290
the face of a young murderer, a gentle dock hand.

451
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:21,770
He's left town

452
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:26,730
and, driven by a necessity unknown to him,

453
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:30,410
he walks, walks with his comrades,

454
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,170
arrives in the wooded mountains, and there

455
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,850
he arms himself, prepares himself,

456
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,810
initiates himself to the new,

457
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,210
to the eternal fight.

458
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,130
The bitterness of the trees under the sun,

459
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:53,050
the smell of the bombed mountain.

460
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,010
The hour of combat has come, of resistance,

461
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,970
the hour of patrolling full of sweat,

462
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,330
the hour when the boy yearns for death,

463
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:10,850
the hour

464
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,650
when pity means dishonour.

465
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,850
Ah, France, the hate!

466
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,010
Ah, France, the pest!

467
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,410
Ah France, the cowardice!

468
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,890
A small plane

469
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,570
takes you away to the sky.

470
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,050
And in the sky is buzzing and again buzzing

471
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,930
hate, the pest and cowardice.

472
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,690
Revenge buzzes in the sky,

473
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,770
France, against whom nobody can say anything,

474
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:53,330
carries the conscience of the whole universe!

475
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:58,770
It still buzzes in the sky! France,

476
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:00,970
your confusion,

477
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:10,450
it buzzes in the sky of a nation which draws its force

478
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,010
from its humility.

479
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,810
In the sky of Algeria buzzes

480
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,970
a crisis which creates death.

481
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,650
Looking

482
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,730
for a new liberty,

483
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:34,370
it wants victims whose victory is certain.

484
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,770
Ah, France, the hate!

485
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,490
Ah, France, the pest!

486
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,490
Ah, France, the cowardice!

487
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,730
A terrible buzzing,

488
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,010
idiotic,

489
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,290
shameless,

490
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,490
a music

491
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,170
which ends with a child's terror

492
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:59,970
and a sob convulsing the world.

493
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,570
On my befouled rags,

494
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:16,290
on my skeletal nakedness,

495
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,930
on my gypsy mother,

496
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,370
on my shepherd father,

497
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,850
I write your name.

498
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:27,170
On my first brother, the bandit,

499
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,930
on my second brother, the lame one,

500
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,370
on my third brother, the bootblack,

501
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:38,290
on my forth brother, the beggar,

502
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,850
I write your name.

503
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,690
On my low-down comrades,

504
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,930
on my comrades without work,

505
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,690
on my comrades drilling as soldiers,

506
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,530
I write your name.

507
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,330
"Freedom!"

508
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,370
Oran, the evening meeting.

509
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,610
On the desert nomads,

510
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,370
on the Medina field workers,

511
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,210
on the employees of Oran,

512
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,210
on the small wage-earners of Oran,

513
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,690
I write your name.

514
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:29,650
On the miserable men of Algeria,

515
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,570
on the analphabetic people of Arabia,

516
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,690
on the poor classes of Africa,

517
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:43,970
on the enslaved people of the sub-proletarian world

518
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,130
I write your name:

519
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:47,690
"freedom!"

520
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,130
Joy after joy, victory after victory...

521
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,650
Men of colour,

522
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,810
Algeria has been restored to history!

523
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:06,450
Men of colour are living the most beautiful days of their lives!

524
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,290
Never have your eyes sparkled more,

525
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,650
never have your gestures expressed so much happiness.

526
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,730
Men of colour,

527
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:20,250
here's the victory of the whole world's partisans!

528
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,330
Joy,

529
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,770
but what incessant terror

530
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,810
in a thousand places on earth

531
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,650
and in our memory.

532
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:44,810
In a thousand souls, war has not ended.

533
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,690
Even if I don't want to remember,

534
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:52,450
war is a terror which does not want to end

535
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:55,810
in the soul, in the world.

536
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,370
Of the ancient world

537
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,610
and of the future world

538
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,810
there remains nothing but the beauty.

539
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,250
And you,

540
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,010
little sister,

541
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:20,250
running after your older brothers,

542
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,490
laughing with them,

543
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,410
imitating them,

544
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,770
you, the youngest of all little sisters,

545
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:30,970
you wore your beauty with humility.

546
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:35,210
And your soul, being the soul of a girl
coming from modest circumstances,

547
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,290
your soul had never been conscious of your beauty.

548
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:42,010
Otherwise, this beauty would not have been possible.

549
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:45,090
The world had taught it to you,

550
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:49,210
thus, your beauty became the world's.

551
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,130
Of the terrible ancient world

552
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:57,450
and of the terrible future world

553
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,410
nothing remains but beauty.

554
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:05,970
And you, you wore it like an obedient smile.

555
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,170
Obedience

556
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,650
demands too many swallowed tears,

557
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:15,250
generosity towards others, too many joyful glances

558
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,610
which ask for mercy!

559
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:18,890
Thus,

560
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,850
you have taken away with you your beauty,

561
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:27,410
you vanished like gold dust.

562
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,690
Of the stupid ancient world

563
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:36,090
and of the ferocious future world

564
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:40,450
there remained a beauty that wasn't ashamed

565
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:44,290
to show her girlish breasts,

566
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:48,370
a little stomach so easily bared.

567
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,850
That is why beauty was there,

568
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:58,530
the same beauty the sweet young girls of your world have,

569
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,770
the tradesmen's daughters, laureates

570
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,530
of the competitions of Miami or London.

571
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,730
You disappeared like a golden dove.

572
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,850
The world had taught it to you,

573
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:19,450
and thus, your beauty was no longer beauty.

574
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:23,610
But you went on being a child,

575
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:27,850
silly like antiquity, cruel like the future,

576
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,770
and between yourself and your beauty, possessed by power,

577
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,970
the stupid and cruel present seeped in.

578
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:41,170
You always wore it like a smile between tears.

579
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:44,770
Immodest by passivity, indecent by obedience,

580
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:50,650
you disappeared like a white-golden dove.

581
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:59,610
Her beauty, surviving the ancient world,

582
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,930
reclaimed by the future world,

583
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,170
possessed by the present word,

584
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,370
became a deadly evil.

585
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:18,570
And now, the older brothers at last turn round,

586
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,330
stopping for a moment in their cursed games,

587
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,050
leaving their endless distractions,

588
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,090
and ask themselves:

589
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,370
"Is it possible that Marilyn, little Marilyn,

590
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,450
"had shown us the way?"

591
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:40,570
And now, you don't count any more, poor child,

592
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,090
with your smile

593
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:47,210
you are the first to have crossed the world's doors,

594
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:48,770
abandoned

595
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,490
to your destiny of death.

596
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,450
Dreams of death.

597
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:20,850
Ah, children!

598
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:25,410
The mothers were monsters,

599
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,290
slow fatalities who accomplish far from the world.

600
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:33,530
We have never existed.

601
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:35,730
Reality,

602
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:37,810
that is forms

603
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,450
on top of the skies,

604
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:52,050
struggle of the classes,

605
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,010
the reason of all wars,

606
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:58,290
subtle forms of cancer,

607
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,730
weapons of the struggle of the classes.

608
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:04,170
Veil of terror which dominates the world,

609
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,810
eroding roses of war,

610
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:10,530
sowed by the classes' struggle.

611
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:16,810
The class possessing beauty,

612
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:19,890
reinforced by the use of beauty,

613
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:23,130
attains the extreme edges of beauty,

614
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:27,290
where beauty is only beauty.

615
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,970
The class possessing riches,

616
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:34,210
mingles such a self-assurance to wealth

617
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:37,250
that for her, nature and wealth become confused.

618
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:42,970
She is so much lost in the world of wealth

619
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:47,450
that for her, history and wealth become confused.

620
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,730
She is so touched by wealth

621
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:55,530
that she credits God with the idea of wealth.

622
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,890
The class of beauty and wealth,

623
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:07,090
a world which leaves you outside.

624
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,410
It's the class of black woolen scarves,

625
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,850
cheap black aprons,

626
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:28,650
cloths which cover the sisters' white faces,

627
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:36,330
the class of christian suspense,

628
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:39,650
of fraternal silences in the mud

629
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,810
and of sombre rainy days.

630
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,770
The class which gives highest value

631
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,810
to its poor thousand liras,

632
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:51,970
and founds on it

633
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:53,930
a life

634
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:57,330
hardly able to illuminate

635
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:00,290
death's fatality.

636
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,690
I ascent to heaven

637
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,810
with a heart which is simple

638
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:23,970
and great

639
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,690
because great is my nation.

640
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:31,130
Adieu, world of uncertain fathers and of certain sons.

641
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:39,050
I fly towards the Occident

642
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:42,810
and my flight absorbs in my generous heart

643
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:46,010
the evil which dominates the world.

644
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:50,410
Rome liberates itself,

645
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,770
viewed from the heights where the moral judgment reigns,

646
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:57,050
of the obscure incense

647
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:00,370
like a gas being scattered under the wind,

648
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:03,650
of a spirit of pure sentiments.

649
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:09,370
I fly towards the Occident

650
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:11,450
and my passage

651
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:14,570
is like the passage of an ordinary swallow

652
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:18,570
which announces that May is arriving without doubt.

653
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:22,410
Over there, a civilization triumphs.

654
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:25,570
Suddenly, I announce agony.

655
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:30,410
In Paris, in London, a human fable collapses,

656
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,610
a great history,

657
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:36,170
with its thoughts and its poetry.

658
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:45,850
I fly towards the Occident, and my life

659
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:50,090
is like an enemy which invades peaceably the sky.

660
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:54,090
Washington holds back its fury

661
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:56,770
against the advancing people,

662
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:59,450
and you can see the surge of love

663
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:02,210
through my purifying flight,

664
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:04,810
even in this hopeless world.

665
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:11,690
I come down to earth

666
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,810
among my comrades of hearts simple

667
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:19,210
and great, for great is my nation.

668
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:23,730
And I bring with me the conscience of a new sun,

669
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:26,130
until now lost in the future

670
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:30,130
and conquered today, old hope

671
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,330
of an unforeseen love.

672
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,010
I return from the cosmos, comrades.

673
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:22,170
My humble technical experience takes over, presently,

674
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:24,050
that which will be yours,

675
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:27,290
your enemies', the political leaders'

676
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:29,170
and the poets'.

677
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:32,370
Up there, comrade Krouchtchev, everyone was my brother,

678
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:36,090
bourgeois and worker, intellectual and sub-proletarian,

679
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:38,010
Russian and American!

680
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:39,850
I know, comrade Krouchtchev,

681
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:41,690
that this was an optical illusion,

682
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:44,730
and, on the contrary, immense and irremediable

683
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,890
is the abyss between us who fly the cosmos,

684
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:51,010
and the billions of miserables attached to the earth

685
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:52,930
like desperate insects.

686
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:55,650
Therefore, the roads of heaven

687
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,570
must be the roads of fraternity and peace.

688
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:02,330
Telling you this is my ultimate and greatest duty,

689
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,690
because, comrades and enemies,

690
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:06,730
politicians and poets,

691
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:10,410
the revolution wants just one war,

692
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:12,890
the war which is waged by the spirits

693
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:15,610
who leave to the past

694
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:19,930
the old ways of the earth, full of blood.

695
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:45,050
